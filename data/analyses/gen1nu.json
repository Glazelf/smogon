    "overview": "<p>With the best ways to super effectively hit Psychic-types in the game, STAB Twineedle and Pin Missile, Beedrill seems like it would be a worthwhile choice. It can operate as a late-game sweeper once opposing bulky Pokemon have been taken out or the opposing team is weakened. Once it has set up Swords Dance and Agility, it is able to 2HKO threats such as Nidoqueen and Venomoth, even OHKOing Mr. Mime and Exeggcute after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>However, Beedrill has some horrid flaws that cannot be overlooked. Mainly, its stat spread is outright terrible, with its horrid defenses alongside five weaknesses leaving it unable to take hits from common threats. It's slow and unable to hit very hard without setting up, which it usually cannot do due to it being 2HKOed by most of the metagame. Because of this frailty, it is forced to set up on a foe that is unable to attack for two turns, such as one that's frozen or sleeping. It also has a terrible offensive movepool, only getting Bug-type STAB moves, the ubiquitous Hyper Beam, and nothing else. Because of this poor coverage, it gets walled by many Pokemon and gets destroyed in return. Overall, Beedrill is a horrible Pokemon in the RBY NU metagame and usually has no impact on a serious game. Many other Pokemon — such as Pinsir and Kingler — can take better advantage of the support it requires.</p> ",

Swords Dance is necessary for Beedrill to be able to sweep weakened teams. Getting both moves off is hugely important for this set to function. Twineedle is able to do severe damage to notable threats after a Swords Dance, most importantly OHKOing Mr. Mime and Exeggcute. Hyper Beam lets Beedrill finish off frail Pokemon, such as Primeape, Rapidash, and Electrode.</p> <p>Beedrill often has trouble reliably setting up often, so sleepers like Poliwhirl and Exeggcute are great for it. Bulky Pokemon like Golem and Kabutops that resist Bug need to be weakened or knocked out if Beedrill hopes to sweep. Thus, Water- and Electric-types like Dewgong, Kabutops, and Electrode can be effective partners.</p> "}],

Although its base 80 Speed is fast for a Wrap user, it still falls short of a multitude of top-tier threats, such as Nidoking, Mr. Mime, and Charizard. Despite its defensive typing letting it pivot into Toxic, which cripples other wrappers, it is abysmal overall: Arbok not only fails to resist notable offensive types, but is also quite vulnerable to a multitude of popular Ground- and Psychic-types like Golem, Exeggcute, and Mr. Mime. Although Arbok boasts higher Speed, Defense, and Attack than Dragonair, the latter’s Agility, Thunder Wave, and superior typing mean it will usually be the better choice.

Pokemon that can stomach Psychic- and Ground-type attacks, such as Exeggcute and Blastoise, are also appreciated so Arbok can paralyze foes throughout a match.

Uniquely, Golbat is the only Pokemon that is immune to both Toxic and Earthquake, giving it a small defensive niche due to its ability to support teammates that dislike taking Toxic, as well as its ability to switch in on Pokemon such as Golem. In addition, it is the only Flying-type to also have access to Confuse Ray, and it has access to Screech.

Confuse Ray provides Golbat opportunities to use Screech, especially in situations against paralyzed Pokemon, and increases its damage alongside Screech. Confuse Ray is also useful in disrupting wrappers and setup sweepers.

Substitute can be used to reduce the need for prediction, allowing Golbat to scout and potentially even get more opportunities to use moves such as Confuse Ray and Screech. Hyper Beam instead of Double-Edge also profits off of the extra damage that Screech provides, although the opposing Pokemon can simply switch out and force Golbat to recharge. However, a previously-setup Substitute can improve this situation by leaving it invulnerable during the recharge turn. Finally, Toxic can be used to interrupt partial trapping from the likes of Dragonair and Moltres more consistently than Confuse Ray.

Swords Dance has the added benefit of reapplying an opposing Pokemon's Speed drop from paralysis, which helps if Parasect has been used to absorb paralysis itself. Hyper Beam is surprisingly powerful at +2, with a chance to OHKO Mr. Mime and Raticate; it can also KO Venomoth, Dragonair, Fearow, Electrode, and Porygon if they have taken even slight chip damage.

While Slash may seem enticing for immediate power, it only lands a critical hit 46.88% of the time because of Parasect’s horrendous Speed stat, making it unviable. STAB Mega Drain lets Parasect 3HKO Golem and Kabutops while regaining some HP, but its utility outside of this is questionable. Toxic can be used over Stun Spore to incapacitate Dragonair and Fire Spin users like Rapidash, Moltres, and Charizard, but whether Parasect gets the opportunity to do this without being KOed or forced out the next turn is another matter.</p> "

If paired with Toxic users like Blastoise, then Onix can quickly pile on damage with Bind, which can work especially well in tandem with other partial trappers like Moltres.</p> "}],

  "Kingler": {
    "overview": "<p>Swords Dance Kingler is the strongest wallbreaker and a potent sweeper in RBY NU. At +2, Hyper Beam can OHKO threats like Mr. Mime, Rapidash, and Poliwhirl. Additionally, Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam will KO any Normal-neutral foe in the tier. Rock-types are washed away by Crabhammer, a very powerful STAB move that will almost always score a critical hit. Crabhammer easily OHKOes Golem and 2HKOes Kabutops. Kingler also has decent physical bulk, avoiding 2HKOs from some strong physical attacks such as Golem's Earthquake and opposing +2 Kingler's Body Slam. This allows Kingler to emergency check such threats.</p> <p>However, Kingler is very slow for RBY NU, outsped by a myriad of prominent offensive threats in the tier. This means it requires extensive paralysis support from teammates to safely sweep and is ruined by getting paralyzed itself. Also, while Crabhammer's sheer power makes up for Kingler's low Special offensively, even neutral special attacks such as Mr. Mime's Psychic 2HKO it. Kingler's weakness to Electric means it is forced out by certain threats such as Thunderbolt Nidoking and Clefable.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Kingler should generally not run any other moves than the four listed in the set. It can attempt to run Stomp over Body Slam to flinch foes, but Stomp is much weaker than Body Slam and makes Kingler even more reliant on its team to spread paralysis. Blizzard may sound decent, but it does not actually hit anything harder than Kingler's Normal-type moves due to Kingler's low Special. Substitute might sound enticing; however, while Kingler may have decent physical bulk, it is once again held back by its bad Special, which causes Substitute to usually be a waste. Also, Substitute does not address Kingler's crippling weakness to Thunder Wave.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Attacks</strong>: Electrode, Nidoking, and Mr. Mime outspeed Kingler and can 2HKO it with Thunderbolt, with Electrode even having a chance to OHKO, further bolstered by its high critical hit rate. Magneton, while slower than Kingler, can almost always take a boosted Hyper Beam from full health and will always OHKO Kingler in return. Clefable is slower than Kingler and takes heavy damage from boosted Body Slam, but it can threaten to 2HKO Kingler.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Thunder Wave users such as Clefable and Mr. Mime can dash any chance of Kingler sweeping late-game. Getting paralyzed means Kingler can no longer outspeed some of the slowest Pokemon in RBY NU or outspeed faster paralyzed foes.</p> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers</strong>: Kingler's poor Special means even moderately strong special attacks like Mr. Mime's Psychic 2HKO it. Even Moltres's Fire Blast, which Kingler resists, will always 3HKO it. Its low Speed exacerbates this issue, as it can't outspeed most of the threats that threaten to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Burns: All the Fire Blast users in NU mean that Kingler, as a Water-type, will inevitably switch into a few of them. However, Fire Blast's 30.1% chance to burn can greatly hinder Kingler's sweeping prowess if it gets unlucky, forcing Kingler to use Swords Dance to negate the burn Attack drop. However, a burned Kingler can still use Crabhammer unhindered.</p> ",

Crabhammer OHKOing Golem and slamming Kabutops is particularly fantastic.</p> <p>Kingler's low Speed means it highly appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Mr. Mime and Clefable. Kingler also appreciates teammates that can switch into Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt, such as Golem and Nidoking.

Its Speed also makes it faster than some of the tier's other offensive threats, such as Nidoking and Pinsir. However, it just has too many flaws to really make use of its unique traits.</p> <p>Firstly, all of Hitmonlee's attacking moves are either Normal-type or Fighting-type. This lack of coverage makes it difficult for Hitmonlee to damage a lot of Pokemon outside of those weak to High Jump Kick. This goes especially for Gastly, which is immune to all of Hitmonlee's competitively viable moves besides Seismic Toss. Next, its Speed is only base 87, meaning it falls short when compared to other offensive threats in the tier such as Mr. Mime, Poliwhirl, and Charizard. Therefore, Hitmonlee needs extensive paralysis support to work, and it's just not worth it when other Pokemon like Golem get more mileage out of such a strategy. Finally, its paper-thin defenses mean it has little chance of surviving any interactions. This is especially true against common Flying-, Psychic-, and Poison-type Pokemon, since they resist High Jump Kick. Pretty much the entire metagame can OHKO or 2HKO Hitmonlee regardless of whether or not they can hit it super effectively.

Body Slam is used for some much-needed coverage and consistency, allowing Hitmonlee to deny switch-ins and spread paralysis without support from teammates. For Hitmonlee's final moveslot, there are a few options. Counter can net some surprise KOs from Normal-type attacks like Charizard's Slash, or even a teammate's Explosion in the niche scenario where Hitmonlee is brought in right afterward to deal massive damage to a potential switch-in. Seismic Toss lets Hitmonlee actually damage Gastly and force it to use Explosion earlier.

Teammates such as Mr. Mime, Venomoth, and Porygon can be very useful in that regard, as they can spread status without much trouble.

It's even one of only two Pokemon in the game with access to Sludge, giving it a decent Poison-type STAB move that lets it spread poison efficiently. Sludge can cripple a variety of wrappers such as Dragonair, Rapidash, and Pinsir, the latter of which is hit super effectively. Its Poison typing also helps guard your team against this, letting it switch in on Toxic to protect your own wrappers.</p> <p>However, that's all the good things one can say about Weezing.

The combination of Fire Blast and Thunderbolt lets Weezing hit almost the entire tier for at least neutral damage; Fire Blast is of particular note for giving Weezing an answer to Exeggcute, while Thunderbolt 2HKOes Poliwhirl and Flying-types like Fearow and Aerodactyl. The last moveslot is largely subjective; Hyper Beam KOes Mr. Mime and Raticate from around half HP, while Sludge is more reliable while coming with a very high poison chance.</p> <p>While its movepool is tiny, Weezing can be customized to some degree. Thunder can be used for a boost in power at the cost of consistency, letting Weezing 2HKO Blastoise, Charizard, Kabutops, and Seadra. While Weezing is efficient at spreading status thanks to Fire Blast and Sludge, Toxic is a valid option to consistently prevent wrappers like Dragonair, Rapidash, and Charizard from taking over games. Finally, Rest can theoretically give more bang for your buck with Weezing's bulk, but its defensive typing makes it difficult to actually wake up. Weezing is best used on offensive teams that can benefit from the holes its Explosion tears in teams; thus, Pokemon like Moltres and Kingler make good partners. Additionally, a Pokemon that can remove Golem such as Blastoise or Seadra can help; otherwise, Weezing tends to let it in for free.

This competition further extends to Pokemon like Kingler, which possesses similar qualities while having reliable counterplay to Rock-types in Crabhammer. Worse still, Pinsir's Speed, while good, is still not quite enough; Fire-types revenge kill it, as do Venomoth, Fearow, and tier-king Mr. Mime.
