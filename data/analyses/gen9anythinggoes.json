        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Dugtrio is a consistent trapper that distinguishes itself from Gothitelle by being able to revenge kill some premier threats like Koraidon, Miraidon, Chi-Yu, and Iron Bundle. Stone Edge hits Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle for maximum damage. Tera Fairy + Tera Blast allows it to trap and OHKO unboosted Koraidon, Choice Band Chien-Pao that isn't locked into Ice Shard, and weakened offensive Great Tusk and Walking Wake. Additionally, it can dispatch Choice item Koraidon, Walking Wake, and Miraidon locked into Outrage or Draco Meteor. Memento gives setup opportunities to teammates on a trapped Pokemon Dugtrio can't do much against, such as Great Tusk, while Final Gambit trades it for more damage on Iron Bundle, Koraidon, and unboosted Tera Fairy Miraidon. Choice Scarf Dugtrio is used on balance teams but has no defensive utility and fails to beat Double Dance Miraidon, Iron Bundle in Electric Terrain, Swords Dance + Flame Charge Koraidon, and Swords Dance Chien-Pao. Thus, it is crucial to pair it with checks to these threats such as Iron Treads, Clodsire, Toxapex, Alomomola, and Dondozo. Pelipper and Corviknight are solid walls that can also pivot Dugtrio in, establishing opportunities for it to trap Pokemon. Miraidon, Walking Wake, Iron Bundle, Chien Pao, and offensive Great Tusk appreciate Dugtrio getting rid of the Pokemon that check or revenge kill them. Dugtrio can also fit on stall teams since it traps strong threats and prevents them from getting multiple KOs, including Gothitelle, which is a major hindrance to bulkier structures.</p> "

From there, it can attempt a reverse sweep. Ditto's EVs and IVs minimize Speed and maximize bulk: this helps against opposing Ditto by triggering its own Imposter latest to make the foe run out of PP first, as well as minimizing Struggle damage. Tera Fairy elevates Ditto against a Choice Scarf Miraidon or Koraidon that will likely attack Ditto with a Dragon-type move. Ditto eases the pressure on the defensive backbone of a team by revenge killing some common threats, so it is advised to fit more offensive wallbreakers on the team like Chien-Pao, Miraidon, Koraidon, and Iron Bundle. However, Ditto still fails to revenge kill bulkier sweepers like Double Dance Miraidon, Bulk Up Koraidon and Great Tusk, and Quark Drive and Protosynthesis users like Iron Valiant, Iron Bundle, and Flutter Mane. Additionally, most sweepers can take advantage of Ditto with a surprise Terastallization, such as Tera Fire Koraidon, Tera Fairy Miraidon, and Tera Water Gholdengo. Thus, backup checks to them like defensive Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, Clodsire, Alomomola, and Toxapex are appreciated.

Hurricane nails Koraidon and Great Tusk if they try to set up on Pelipper. Knock Off allows it to cripple common switch-ins like Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Clodsire. Alternatively, Surf is a fairly strong STAB move in rain that punishes Tera Fire Koraidon and Chi-Yu, and it still pressures passive switch-ins. With minimum Speed to be slower than Ting-Lu and Corviknight, U-turn gives safe entry to a teammate of its choice. U-turn also lets it escape Gothitelle, harming it and preserving momentum, as it tries to hard switch in. Tera Fairy is used to defeat a Koraidon locked into Outrage or Wild Charge, which would otherwise break through Pelipper, and also to deal with Thunderbolt from Gothitelle, Crunch from Chien-Pao, and Dark Pulse from Chi-Yu in a pinch. Miraidon and Iron Bundle are the biggest threats to Pelipper, able to switch into it multiple times fairly easily. Hence, it is mandatory to pair Pelipper with appropriate checks like Clodsire, Blissey, and Iron Treads, which will additionally set entry hazards to stop them from switching in for free. Clodsire especially gives solid support by tanking rain-boosted Water-type moves from Iron Bundle, Tera Water Miraidon, and Walking Wake. Physical attackers like Swords Dance Koraidon and Chien-Pao can easily break through Pelipper, so it is advised to have backup checks to them like Great Tusk, Skeledirge, and Garganacl. These threats can also be checked offensively with Palafin, Floatzel, Iron Bundle, Walking Wake, and Miraidon, which also make the most out of Pelipper's rain. Dugtrio can trap and eliminate Miraidon and Iron Bundle once they are weakened; also, Pelipper lets Dugtrio get many trapping opportunities thanks to its slow U-turn pivoting. Pelipper is prone to losing its item to Knock Off, so it is essential to pair it with entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Corviknight.</p> "

Psyshock is chosen over Psychic to more effectively remove Blissey and Clodsire. Trick is a decent midground option that cripples Pokemon Gothitelle might not otherwise beat, like Tera Steel Ting-Lu and Corviknight, but it comes at the cost of greatly reducing Gothitelle's wallbreaking potential, so it should generally be used sparingly. Tera Fairy is used to trap Miraidon, Walking Wake, and Koraidon locked into their Dragon-type STAB moves, and it lets Gothitelle revenge kill weakened Chi-Yu and Chien-Pao locked into a Dark-type STAB move. Alternatively, Tera Grass allows it to 2HKO Ting-Lu and Iron Treads while weakening strong attacks from Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads. Gothitelle fits best on balance teams, where it can make powerful teammates like Miraidon, Koraidon, Iron Bundle, and Chien-Pao into wincons, since it removes many of their common checks. Gothitelle is frail and dislikes hard switching into the walls it seeks to remove, so it greatly appreciates pivots such as Flip Turn Iron Bundle and U-turn users such as Miraidon, Koraidon, and Corviknight. After Gothitelle has picked up a KO, many offensive Pokemon force it out, so standard defensive backbones consisting of Pokemon like Toxapex, Iron Treads, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Skeledirge are vital.</p> "

Haze shuts down attempts of boosting past Toxapex from the likes of Swords Dance Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit. Toxic punishes strong attackers that can threaten Toxapex such as Miraidon, Iron Bundle, and Great Tusk, and it can hinder walls for Toxapex's teammates. Toxic Spikes can instead be used in conjunction with Pokemon that prevent hazard removal, such as Gholdengo and Annihilape, to pester the opposing team long-term. Infestation can trap and deal chip damage, notably to Pokemon like Corviknight, Iron Treads, and opposing Toxapex, which are immune to Toxic. Alternatively, Baneful Bunker lets Toxapex scout foes like Miraidon, Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and Choice Specs Iron Bundle while possibly poisoning them, at the risk of letting them set up on it. Rocky Helmet somewhat offsets Toxapex's passive nature by dealing chip damage and wearing down Pokemon like Koraidon and Chien-Pao, potentially putting them into KO range from a partner and dissuading them from freely using U-turn and Crunch, respectively. Tera Fairy makes Toxapex immune or resistant to attacks like Choice Band Koraidon's Outrage and Choice Band Chien-Pao's Crunch while also making Toxapex neutral to super effective hits from Iron Bundle, Great Tusk, Dugtrio, and Gothitelle. Toxapex is useful on many team styles thanks to its great bulk and Regenerator. Pokemon that are susceptible to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf Koraidon and Ice Shard Chien-Pao, like Miraidon, opposing Koraidon, and Iron Bundle, appreciate Toxapex facing these threats for them. Another notable mention is Gothitelle, which benefits from Infestation's trapping ability, allowing it to switch in and trap defensive Pokemon without fear of them switching out the same turn. Toxapex benefits from being paired with Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Corviknight, which are able to check Miraidon, Iron Bundle, and Great Tusk for it.</p> "

Torch Song is Skeledirge's most reliable STAB move and gives it the potential to snowball late-game into a sweeper. Will-O-Wisp prevents physical attackers like Koraidon, Great Tusk, and Chien-Pao from setting up on it and also annoys passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Alomomola. Earth Power punishes Miraidon and Chi-Yu as they switch in while also letting it beat Garganacl and Tera Fire Koraidon.

Fairy is Skeledirge's preferred Tera Type, granting it a valuable immunity to Koraidon's Outrage and allowing it to absorb otherwise supereffective attacks like Crunch from Chien-Pao and Earthquake or Headlong Rush from Great Tusk. Skeledirge fits best on balance teams that appreciate its ability to neuter Koraidon and can effectively handle the numerous Pokemon that can threaten Skeledirge, such as Great Tusk, Miraidon, and Iron Bundle.

Dazzling Gleam can hit Dark-types such as Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Grimmsnarl super effectively. Tera Blast with Tera Fighting also allows Espathra to nail Dark-types, including Chi-Yu—unlike Dazzling Gleam—as well as Steel-types like Iron Treads and Kingambit. Substitute blocks status moves such as Clodsire and Toxapex's Toxic, and it makes Espathra harder to revenge kill. Roost keeps Espathra healthy, making it less susceptible to common priority moves such as Chien-Pao's Ice Shard. Protect allows Espathra to accumulate a turn of Leftovers recovery and a Speed increase from Speed Boost, which also boosts Stored Power. Electric Seed increases Espathra's Defense, complementing Calm Mind's Special Defense boosts, and contributes towards Stored Power's Base Power. Leftovers synergizes with Substitute and Protect by providing passive recovery. Tera Fairy lets Espathra resist Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao and Kingambit and boosts Dazzling Gleam. Tera Fighting similarly provides a resistance to Dark-type attacks, in addition to making Tera Blast useful, at the cost of leaving Espathra completely reliant on Terastallizing to hit Dark-types. The Speed EVs given allow +2 Speed Espathra to outspeed Iron Bundle in Electric Terrain, which activates its Quark Drive, while the special bulk ensures Espathra survives Choice Scarf Miraidon's Electro Drift and fast Walking Wake's Draco Meteor at +1 Special Defense. The Defense EVs notably let Espathra survive Choice Scarf Tera Fire Koraidon's Flare Blitz when paired with Electric Seed. Espathra appreciates being on more offensive teams, as it is frail and likely cannot threaten to sweep more than once. Since it summons Electric Terrain, Miraidon is an essential partner if Espathra is running Electric Seed. The two Pokemon can also weaken Iron Treads, Clodsire, and Whirlwind Ting-Lu for each other. Fighting-type teammates such as Koraidon and Great Tusk can threaten the Dark- and Steel-types that resist Espathra's Stored Power. Suicide leads in Glimmora, Froslass, and Cloyster can set up entry hazards to weaken opposing Pokemon for Espathra, and they fit well on the offensive teams it finds itself on. Grimmsnarl can effectively double Espathra's poor bulk thanks to Light Screen and Reflect.</p> "

Alternatively, Counter can be used to eliminate defensive Great Tusk, Choice Scarf Koraidon Choice locked into Dragon Claw, and Chien-Pao Choice locked into Crunch. Water Absorb is preferred, as it makes Clodsire immune to Hydro Pump from Iron Bundle and Water-type STAB moves from Walking Wake while also making it so it doesn't ignore the Special Attack drop from Miraidon's Draco Meteor, which Unaware doesn't allow. With Tera Steel and Water Absorb, Clodsire acts as a good Iron Bundle and Walking Wake check while taking Draco Meteor from Miraidon, Psyshock from Flutter Mane, and Ice-type STAB moves from Chien-Pao better.

Gholdengo's ability and typing make it immune to Defog, Rapid Spin, Mortal Spin, and status moves, giving it a niche over other special attackers. Trick is useful to cripple special walls like Blissey, Iron Treads, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu by locking them into unfavorable moves, thus supporting teammates like Miraidon and Iron Bundle. Focus Blast targets Chi-Yu, Kingambit, and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Recover may be used to grant Gholdengo longevity, while Nasty Plot helps it function as a cleaner in the late-game. Tera Water gives it a better defensive typing by allowing it to deal better with Choice Scarf Koraidon. Tera Ghost gets rid of Gholdengo's Ground-type weakness while retaining immunity to Rapid Spin and strengthens Shadow Ball. Lastly, Tera Fighting weakens otherwise super effective hits from Chien-Pao and Kingambit to allow Gholdengo to revenge kill them while also boosting Focus Blast to deal more damage to Ting-Lu, Chi-Yu, and Iron Treads. Gholdengo works best with entry hazard setters and defensive walls such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads, as well as strong attackers like Chien-Pao, Miraidon, Koraidon, and Iron Bundle, that appreciate Gholdengo's ability to revenge kill, block hazard removal, and cripple walls.

Icicle Crash is the preferred Ice-type STAB move due to its higher power, flinch chance to potentially beat walls like Corviknight and Garganacl, and avoidance of adverse contact effects like Baneful Bunker and Rocky Helmet; however, Ice Spinner is more consistent and can also remove Electric Terrain. Ice Shard gives Chien-Pao a powerful way to revenge kill opposing offensive threats, notably threatening Flutter Mane, Koraidon, Miraidon, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk. Sucker Punch is also an option, as it hits Choice Scarf Chi-Yu and Iron Bundle much harder while still threatening Flutter Mane and Miraidon. In the last slot, Sacred Sword hits Garganacl and OHKOes Kingambit and Chi-Yu, which would otherwise switch in fairly safely and force Chien-Pao out. Alternatively, running Ice Shard and Sucker Punch together is also an option, allowing Chien-Pao to pressure both Iron Bundle and Koraidon effectively while also ensuring that it beats other Chien-Pao consistently. An Adamant nature is preferable as it guarantees a 2HKO on Toxapex after Stealth Rock with Crunch while also getting favorable rolls against Corviknight and Ting-Lu, although Jolly is also viable in order to speed tie with unboosted Miraidon, Koraidon, and Flutter Mane. Chien-Pao's best Tera type is Dark, which drastically boosts Crunch, making it much easier for it to break through Alomomola, Corviknight, and Toxapex while guaranteeing an OHKO on Iron Bundle with Sucker Punch. Tera Ice is also viable, notably netting an OHKO against Miraidon and a good chance to OHKO Koraidon with Ice Shard. Chien-Pao fits well on all manner of balance teams, pairing extremely well with Miraidon thanks to their ability to effectively pressure each other's checks, with Chien-Pao threatening Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads while Miraidon threatens Corviknight, Alomomola, and Toxapex. Gothitelle is also a great teammate that can trap and remove Chien-Pao's checks, notably beating Toxapex and Alomomola. Due to its frailty and its tendency to be forced out after locking into a move, Chien-Pao needs a sturdy defensive backbone to support it, so balance staples like Corviknight, Ting-Lu, Toxapex, and Skeledirge can all be good teammates for their ability to handle Pokemon like Koraidon, Great Tusk, and Miraidon which might attempt to take advantage of Chien-Pao.</p> "

Sucker Punch is the preferred priority move option, allowing it to OHKO Flutter Mane without a boost, as well as Iron Bundle and Miraidon after a Swords Dance. Alternatively, Ice Shard OHKOes Koraidon, Miraidon, and Flutter Mane at +2 Attack after Stealth Rock. Heavy-Duty Boots is the best item on this set, but Life Orb and Focus Sash are solid picks on hyper offense builds and other teams with good entry hazard control. Life Orb lets Chien-Pao get some crucial OHKOs at +2 Attack, notably against Miraidon and Koraidon with Ice Shard and Corviknight and Toxapex with Crunch. Tera Dark makes its Dark-type moves stronger while shedding the weaknesses from its Ice typing, notably reducing Stealth Rock damage and weakening Iron Head and Body Press from Corviknight as well as Torch Song from Skeledirge. Chien-Pao fits best on offensive teams and flourishes with other wallbreakers like Miraidon, Koraidon, Iron Bundle, and offensive Great Tusk. On bulkier builds, teammates like defensive Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads set entry hazards while checking fast Pokemon like Koraidon and Miraidon. If forgoing Heavy-Duty Boots, it is essential to pair Chien-Pao with lead entry hazard setters like Glimmora and Froslass on offensive teams and Iron Treads and Great Tusk on bulkier teams, as they additionally prevent opposing entry hazards from going up.</p> "

Whirlwind lets Ting-Lu deter setup attempts by Tera Fairy Miraidon or simply force out foes to inflict entry hazard damage. Alternatively, Protect can be used for more Leftovers recovery and scouting attacks, although it must be used carefully to avoid Chien-Pao, Koraidon, and Miraidon getting a free turn to set up. Ghost is the preferred Tera type to block Rapid Spin from Iron Treads and Great Tusk, as well as removing Ting-Lu's weaknesses to Iron Bundle's and Koraidon's STAB moves, which lets it effectively check them. Alternatively, Tera Steel grants immunity to Toxic, makes Ting-Lu a solid check to Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane, and eases the matchup against Double Dance Tera Fairy Miraidon. Ting-Lu is most effectively paired with Pokemon like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Alomomola that can handle physical attackers, notably Koraidon, Chien-Pao, Iron Treads, and Great Tusk, that force it out. Ting-Lu isn't a particularly consistent Miraidon check, notably struggling against Calm Mind and Choice Specs Miraidon sets, so backup checks such as Iron Treads and Clodsire can also be very useful. If Ting-Lu is running Spikes, spinners like Iron Treads and Great Tusk can be tremendously valuable, removing enemy entry hazards while leaving your own Spikes intact. It also greatly appreciates teammates such as Miraidon, Koraidon, Iron Bundle, and Chien-Pao that can pressure opposing hazard removers, and in turn they appreciate Ting-Lu's hazards chipping down their checks. Gholdengo and Annihilape can also be good teammates because they outright block or severely punish hazard removal, respectively.</p> "

Dark Pulse allows Chi-Yu to immediately threaten Fire-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Garganacl, 2HKOing or OHKOing them without sun. Fire Blast can reach important damage thresholds, such as 2HKOing Blissey, without the Special Attack drop that accompanies Overheat, with Psychic instead preventing Toxapex from scouting Chi-Yu's move. Tera Fire turns Chi-Yu's 2HKOs against Pokemon like Toxapex and Double Dance Miraidon into OHKOs under sun, and it guarantees 2HKOs on even the bulkiest defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Garganacl, OHKOing them in sun and with minor chip damage. A Modest nature is preferred, but a Timid nature can be considered if Jolly Great Tusk is an issue. Koraidon is an incredible partner, setting sun and bringing Chi-Yu in with U-turn; in exchange, Chi-Yu greatly threatens all of Koraidon's checks. Pivots such as Corviknight and the aforementioned Koraidon are greatly appreciated, as they can let Chi-Yu switch in without worrying about its poor bulk. Entry hazard removal from Great Tusk, Corviknight, or Iron Treads is very helpful due to Chi-Yu's weakness to Stealth Rock and its tendency to switch out after a KO. Chi-Yu is often forced out by faster Pokemon like Miraidon and Koraidon, so defensive switch-ins to them like Clodsire, Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight are good partners.</p> "
