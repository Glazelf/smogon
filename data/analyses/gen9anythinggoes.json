        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Dugtrio is a consistent trapper that distinguishes itself from Gothitelle by being able to revenge kill some premier threats like Koraidon, Miraidon, Chi-Yu, and Iron Bundle. Stone Edge hits Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle for maximum damage. Tera Fairy + Tera Blast allows it to trap and OHKO unboosted Koraidon, Choice Band Chien-Pao that isn't locked into Ice Shard, and weakened offensive Great Tusk and Walking Wake. Additionally, it can dispatch Choice item Koraidon, Walking Wake, and Miraidon locked into Outrage or Draco Meteor. Memento gives setup opportunities to teammates on a trapped Pokemon Dugtrio can't do much against, such as Great Tusk, while Final Gambit trades it for more damage on Iron Bundle, Koraidon, and unboosted Tera Fairy Miraidon. Choice Scarf Dugtrio is used on balance teams but has no defensive utility and fails to beat Double Dance Miraidon, Iron Bundle in Electric Terrain, Swords Dance + Flame Charge Koraidon, and Swords Dance Chien-Pao. Thus, it is crucial to pair it with checks to these threats such as Iron Treads, Clodsire, Toxapex, Alomomola, and Dondozo. Pelipper and Corviknight are solid walls that can also pivot Dugtrio in, establishing opportunities for it to trap Pokemon. Miraidon, Walking Wake, Iron Bundle, Chien Pao, and offensive Great Tusk appreciate Dugtrio getting rid of the Pokemon that check or revenge kill them. Dugtrio can also fit on stall teams since it traps strong threats and prevents them from getting multiple KOs, including Gothitelle, which is a major hindrance to bulkier structures.</p>"

Rock Blast gives Cloyster a way to OHKO Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao. Tera Ghost prevents opposing spinners from removing the hazards Cloyster sets and provides an immunity to Fighting-type attacks, such as Koraidon's Close Combat and Breloom's Mach Punch. Cloyster fits on hyper offense teams where its Spikes weaken foes for setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Koraidon, Double Dance Miraidon, Iron Moth, and Swords Dance Chien-Pao. Cloyster has no way to remove opposing hazards, so partners such as Hatterene and Great Tusk can act as a form of hazard control, letting Cloyster and its teammates, such as Chien-Pao and Breloom, maintain their Focus Sashes. Cloyster also struggles to make progress against Toxapex, Gholdengo, and Kingambit, so partners that can threaten them such as Great Tusk, Kingambit, Chien-Pao, Hatterene, and Taunt Koraidon are appreciated. Grimmsnarl also pairs well with Cloyster by providing dual screens support, which lets Cloyster and its teammates set up much more easily. Gholdengo can also keep Cloyster's Spikes on the field, and in return, Cloyster takes on Ting-Lu for it. Chien-Pao and Koraidon are especially noteworthy partners, since they appreciate its Spikes and can overwhelm Toxapex for Cloyster.</p>"

Ditto's EVs and IVs minimize Speed and maximize bulk: this helps against opposing Ditto by triggering its own Imposter latest to make the foe run out of PP first, as well as minimizing Struggle damage.

Thunder Wave can cripple the Pokemon that Blissey checks and punish foes attempting to switch in and threaten it, such as Koraidon and Chien-Pao. Tera Ground provides an immunity to Miraidon's Electric-type attacks, notably denying Parabolic Charge variants from healing. Alternatively, Tera Water can be used to resist Fire- and Water-type attacks from Chi-Yu and Walking Wake at the cost of making Blissey unable to check Miraidon. Tera Fire maintains the ability to take on Chi-Yu but instead trades the Water resistance for a lack of weakness to Miraidon's Electric-type moves. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Blissey from being worn down by entry hazards, whereas Utility Umbrella is an option on teams with sufficient hazard control to reduce the damage it takes from Chi-Yu, Walking Wake, and Iron Bundle's sun and rain-boosted attacks. Blissey functions best on balance and stall teams, where it should be paired with physical walls such as Toxapex, Corviknight, Alomomola, Skeledirge, and Dondozo, which can take on threats like Koraidon, Chien-Pao, Great Tusk, Breloom, and Kingambit for it. Blissey is unable to handle Choice Specs and Life Orb Miraidon sets by itself without Tera Ground, so secondary checks in Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads are also viable teammates.

Alternatively, Surf is a fairly strong STAB move in rain that punishes Tera Fire Koraidon and Chi-Yu, and it still pressures passive switch-ins. With minimum Speed to be slower than Ting-Lu and Corviknight, U-turn gives safe entry to a teammate of its choice. U-turn also lets it escape Gothitelle, harming it and preserving momentum, as it tries to hard switch in. Tera Fairy is used to defeat a Koraidon locked into Outrage or Wild Charge, which would otherwise break through Pelipper, and also to deal with Thunderbolt from Gothitelle, Crunch from Chien-Pao, and Dark Pulse from Chi-Yu in a pinch. Miraidon and Iron Bundle are the biggest threats to Pelipper, able to switch into it multiple times fairly easily. Hence, it is mandatory to pair Pelipper with appropriate checks like Clodsire, Blissey, and Iron Treads, which will additionally set entry hazards to stop them from switching in for free. Clodsire especially gives solid support by tanking rain-boosted Water-type moves from Iron Bundle, Tera Water Miraidon, and Walking Wake. Physical attackers like Swords Dance Koraidon and Chien-Pao can easily break through Pelipper, so it is advised to have backup checks to them like Great Tusk, Skeledirge, and Garganacl. These threats can also be checked offensively with Palafin, Floatzel, Iron Bundle, Walking Wake, and Miraidon, which also make the most out of Pelipper's rain. Dugtrio can trap and eliminate Miraidon and Iron Bundle once they are weakened; also, Pelipper lets Dugtrio get many trapping opportunities thanks to its slow U-turn pivoting.

Spore shuts down slower defensive Pokemon, like Corviknight, Toxapex, and Pelipper, offering Breloom free opportunities to use Swords Dance. Close Combat can be used instead on Life Orb sets, as it puts Miraidon into Mach Punch range if it tries to switch in, OHKOes Corviknight at +2. Focus Sash is the preferred item, as it gives more opportunities for Breloom to set up and allows it to avoid revenge killing attempts, but Life Orb can be used instead, notably OHKOing Miraidon and Koraidon with +2 Tera Fighting Mach Punch and improving Breloom's ability to revenge kill Koraidon and Great Tusk. Tera Fighting increases Mach Punch damage, and it lets Breloom survive an Ice Shard from Chien-Pao. Breloom fits best on offensive teams as a wallbreaker and sweeper that especially threatens balance teams. Entry hazard support from Glimmora, Cloyster, or Froslass is appreciated to put offensive Pokemon into Mach Punch KO range. Toxic Spikes may seem like poor synergy because poison prevents Spore, but Spore's main targets—Corviknight, Toxapex, and Pelipper—are unaffected by Toxic Spikes, and the increased damage on Miraidon and Koraidon is helpful. Hatterene is a good partner, as it prevents entry hazards, preserving Breloom's Focus Sash. Kingambit is a powerful sweeper that helps to handle Flutter Mane and Ice Shard Chien-Pao, which can stop Breloom from sweeping. Fast allies like Koraidon, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao can force in slower Pokemon, like Toxapex and Corviknight, for Breloom to exploit, and they also put pressure on Gholdengo and Skeledirge, which effectively wall Breloom. Miraidon prevents Breloom from using Spore on grounded Pokemon, so ways to threaten it—such as Chien-Pao or Flutter Mane—are greatly appreciated.</p>"

Tera Fairy provides Kyogre with a much-needed immunity to Dragon-type moves from Koraidon and Miraidon and a resistance to Koraidon's Low Kick. Tera Ghost is used so that Kyogre can avoid being revenge killed by Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus and Low Kick from Koraidon. Tera Water alleviates prediction by letting Origin Pulse 2HKO Giratina-O and letting Water Spout achieve feats such as OHKOing Miraidon and Toxapex, OHKOing Arceus-Water with a layer of Spikes, and 2HKOing Calm Eternatus even if it uses Recover.

It comes in most often on the metagame's abundant Ground-type Pokemon, most notably Arceus-Ground, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T, all of which are forced out by Kyogre. Ice Beam is a necessary coverage move, as it deals super effective damage to many of Kyogre's checks such as Miraidon, Koraidon, Giratina-O, Wo-Chien, Eternatus, and Clodsire. Thunder can be used to remove other Pokemon that resist Origin Pulse, those being Toxapex, Arceus-Water, and opposing Kyogre. In addition to coverage, Kyogre has a serviceable selection of utility options. Calm Mind further bolsters Kyogre's fantastic Special Attack, enabling it to 2HKO defensive answers such as Wo-Chien, Clodsire, and Eternatus using Ice Beam. Thunder Wave aims primarily to cripple Koraidon, slowing down Choice Scarf variants enough for teammates such as Zacian-C and Calyrex-S, which appreciate Speed control being neutralized. Paralyzed Koraidon that do not use a Choice Scarf, however, become slower than Kyogre itself. Thunder Wave also slows down Arceus formes enough for Kyogre to outspeed them, improving its matchup against Calm Mind Arcues-Fairy in particular. Substitute is useful for scouting switches, and lets Kyogre avoid status moves such as Toxic from Toxapex, Eternatus, and Clodsire and Leech Seed from Wo-Chien. Leftovers supports Kyogre's longevity, allowing it to continually switch in throughout the game. Alternatively, Mystic Water helps Kyogre break through bulky neutral targets, including various Arceus formes. 12 Speed EVs allow Kyogre to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T. Tera Fairy grants Kyogre a full immunity to Dragon-type attacks from threats like Koraidon and Miraidon, as well as providing a resistance to Koraidon's Fighting-type moves. Tera Poison offers an immunity to Toxic, as well as valuable resistances to Fighting, Fairy, and Grass. These resistances are helpful against Koraidon, Arceus-Fairy, and Calyrex-S, respectively. Tera Poison also allows Kyogre to absorb Toxic Spikes. However, being a Poison-type causes Kyogre to become vulnerable to Calyrex-S's Psychic-type STAB attacks. Finally, Tera Grass flips Kyogre's weaknesses to Calyrex-S's Grass Knot and Miraidon's Electric-type attacks to resistances. Tera Grass also offers a resistance to Ground, halting Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground and making it safer for Kyogre to switch in to Ground-type attacks. It is worth noting that Tera Grass makes Kyogre particularly weak to Koraidon, as U-turn and Flare Blitz become super effective. Kyogre is seen primarily on bulky offense structures that benefit from its ability to put pressure on defensive cores. It appreciates teammates that can switch into and wear down Koraidon, such as Landorus-T and Toxapex. Kyogre also appreciates support from Pokemon with pivot moves like Landorus-T, Koraidon, and Miraidon, which can help it safely get into the game. Additionally, defensive counterplay for Miraidon is neccessary, as it would otherwise threaten to OHKO Kyogre. Some teammates that can fill this niche are Ting-Lu, Wo-Chien, and Arceus-Ground. Offensive partners that can lure in their passive defensive checks, such as Koraidon, Miraidon, Calyrex-S, and Zacian-C, offer Kyogre ample opportunity to switch in. Calyrex-S in particular serves as an excellent offensive teammate. Its Psychic-type STAB moves give it the upper hand against Kyogre's defensive checks in Toxapex, Clodsire, and Eternatus. In turn, Kyogre is able to switch in on and threaten Calyrex-S's passive defensive checks in Ting-Lu and Arceus-Dark. Additionally, Encore variants of Calyrex-S are able to punish Arceus for attempting to revenge kill Kyogre with Extreme Speed.</p>"

Toxapex and Skeledirge handle Pokemon like Zacian-C and Koraidon for Giratina-O; in return, it handles Ground-types and helps check Arceus. Giratina-O appreciates Ting-Lu and Arceus checking Calyrex-S for it; Ting-Lu also checks Miraidon and helps check Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Calyrex-S likes Giratina-O being able to deal with its two main switch-ins, Arceus and Ting-Lu, by checking the former and removing the latter's Spikes. Because it lacks recovery, Giratina-O can get overwhelmed by the Pokemon it checks when facing hyper offense teams, so it appreciates revenge killers such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Choice Scarf Koraidon.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Giratina-O has a unique role due to great natural bulk, valuable immunities to Normal-, Ground-, and Fighting-type attacks, and a stellar offensive presence. Dragon Tail is the preferred Dragon-type STAB move due to the utility it gives for checking threats like Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground and Extreme Killer Arceus, as well as racking up extra damage with the Spikes that Giratina-O loves. Will-O-Wisp cripples Ting-Lu—preventing it from accruing HP with Leftovers—and scares away offensive Pokemon like Arceus, Koraidon, and Zacian-C. Alternatively, Outrage provides greater brute force to muscle through Ting-Lu and Arceus, and Thunder Wave can cripple would-be checks like Arceus-Fairy. Tera Steel resists many common attacks aimed at Giratina-O: Ice Beam from Kyogre and Arceus-Ground, Dragon-type moves from Koraidon and Miraidon, Play Rough from Zacian-C, and Judgment from Arceus-Fairy. The given EV spread always lives Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and +2 Life Orb Arceus's Shadow Claw; 12 Speed EVs outspeeds uninvested Landorus-T to use Will-O-Wisp before Taunt. Giratina-O fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate it deterring Choice Scarf Koraidon's Low Kick and Flare Blitz and checking Arceus, Arceus-Ground, and Kyogre while still being a powerful attacker. Ting-Lu is a major nuisance for Giratina-O, as it is able to come in quite safely and set Spikes, though it must fear Dragon Tail with multiple layers of Spikes, so teammates that can threaten it like Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, and Koraidon are good partners. Entry hazard support from Landorus-T and your own Ting-Lu is greatly appreciated, chipping checks like Ting-Lu and defensive Arceus formesand weakening offensive threats like Koraidon and Arceus-Ground into Shadow Sneak's KO range. Ting-Lu and Landorus-T also support Giratina-O defensively; the former checks Miraidon, Eternatus, and Terastallized Calyrex-S; the latter checks Zacian-C and helps against Arceus and Arceus-Ground. Arceus is a good offensive partner that can overwhelm shared checks with Giratina-O like defensive Arceus formes while taking advantage of Calyrex-S that are forced to Terastallize from the threat of a Shadow Sneak OHKO. Koraidon is another good partner that helps pressure Ting-Lu, check Kyogre, and overwhelm their shared checks. Zacian-C checks Arceus-Fairy and helps handle Arceus while not letting up on offensive pressure.</p>"

Swords Dance can be used to break past Pokemon like Landorus-T, Giratina-O, Toxapex, and defensive Arceus formes and limit revenge killers like Koraidon, while Dragon Dance is a more niche option that lets Arceus outspeed Calyrex-S, Zacian-C, and opposing Arceus formes. Shadow Claw hits Ghost-types like Giratina-O, Skeledirge, and Calyrex-S and provides good neutral coverage. Recover can provide Arceus with more opportunities to set up and makes it harder to revenge kill; alternatively, Earthquake hits Skeledirge harder, as well as hitting Toxapex and Zacian-C, and Taunt can deny opposing recovery, status-inducing moves, and Haze from Pokemon like Arceus formes, Skeledirge, and Toxapex, respectively. Silk Scarf has no drawbacks, but unlike Life Orb, it means +2 Extreme Speed needs a layer of Spikes to 2HKO defensive Arceus formes, OHKO Miriadon, and 2HKO Zacian-C. Additionally, Life Orb lets +2 Extreme Speed OHKO Koraidon after a layer of Spikes, +1 Earthquake OHKO Zacian-C, and unboosted Earthquake 2HKO Skeledirge and Toxapex. Tera Normal OHKOes Koraidon with +2 Extreme Speed and enables Silk Scarf Arceus to achieve the damage thresholds Life Orb sets can. Tera Ghost makes Arceus harder to revenge kill by opposing Arceus and Koraidon and lets Life Orb-boosted Shadow Claw OHKO defensive Giratina-O after Stealth Rock at +2, OHKO Zacian-C after some chip damage at +2, and 2HKO Skeledirge. Tera Fire makes Arceus immune to Will-O-Wisp, helping against Skeledirge and opposing Arceus formes, and lets it resist Zacian-C's STAB moves, Arceus-Fairy's Judgment, and Calyrex-S's Grass Knot. Arceus fits well on offense and bulky offense teams, being able to revenge kill dangerous threats and clean up late-game. Thanks to Arceus's Normal typing, it's immune to Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, which can help against Choice Specs sets, Koraidon and Zacian-C pair well with Arceus, as they help overwhelm shared checks with Arceus like Landorus-T, Toxapex, and defensive Arceus formes. Pokemon such as Calyrex-S, Miraidon, and Kyogre also threaten its checks and make good teammates. On bulky offense teams, Landorus-T and Ting-Lu make good partners, as Landorus-T can switch into Pokemon that can revenge kill Arceus like Zacian-C and Koraidon, chipping them with Rocky Helmet in the process, and Ting-Lu crucially sets Spikes and helps check Calyrex-S, which offensive Arceus does poorly. On hyper offense teams, Pokemon like Grimmsnarl, Glimmora, and Ribombee support Arceus, and Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Ground can take advantage of Koraidon and Zacian-C for it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Extreme Killer Arceus is a stellar revenge killer, wallbreaker, and cleaner that also crucially checks Calyrex-S thanks to its great defensive profile; this phenomenal combination of traits makes Arceus one of the best Pokemon in the AG metagame, and it should be seriously considered on every team. Swords Dance is the preferred setup move to break through checks like Giratina-O and Landorus-T and limit revenge killers like Koraidon and Zacian-C, while Bulk Up is an alternative on hyper offense with dual screens support from Pokemon like Grimmsnarl, making Arceus a brutal sweeper that stifles common forms of counterplay like Koraidon, Zacian-C, and opposing Extreme Killer Arceus. Shadow Claw OHKOes Calyrex-S, hits Giratina-O, and provides good neutral coverage. The longevity Heavy-Duty Boots provides lets Arceus more reliably check Calyrex-S and more safely set up. Leftovers is an alternative to Heavy-Duty Boots, making Arceus harder to stop once set up. Tera Ghost turns the tables on Koraidon, lets Arceus consistently beat opposing Extreme Killer Arceus, and greatly improves Shadow Claw's damage against Giratina-O and Skeledirge, while Tera Normal boosts Arceus's power to ridiculous levels; at +2, Extreme Speed OHKOes Koraidon after Stealth Rock and 2HKOes Zacian-C. Tera Fire and Steel are more defensive options, blocking status and improving the matchup against threats like Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, and Calyrex-S as well as opposing Extreme Killer Arceus in the case of Steel. 236 HP EVs always survive a hit from Choice Specs Miraidon. Alternatively, a spread with 124 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Def / 124 Spe and an Adamant nature outspeeds Timid Kyogre and always avoids a 2HKO from Life Orb Calyrex-S's Psyshock. Arceus can struggle to break through Giratina-O, Skeledirge, Toxapex, and defensive Arceus formes, so teammates that can take advantage of them, like Calyrex-S and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, or weaken them, like Koraidon and Zacian-C, make for good partners. Choice Scarf Koraidon can also revenge kill Pokemon Arceus cannot like Zacian-C and Calyrex-S. Encore Calyrex-S can switch into any of Arceus's moves besides Shadow Claw and use Encore, so Ting-Lu is a great partner to help check it. Koraidon and Zacian-C highly threaten Arceus, so strong counterplay to them, like Landorus-T on offense or Toxapex or Skeledirge on balance, is crucial.</p>"

Alternatively, Judgment can be ran to ignore Will-O-Wisp's burn to effectively hit the likes of Skeledirge and Giratina-O, allowing Arceus-Dark to switch into Will-O-Wisp from them. Judgment also does decent damage to Terastallized Calyrex-S and Toxapex. Taunt shuts down Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Toxapex from setting up entry hazards, namely that of Spikes and Toxic Spikes, prevents setup sweepers from setting up, and blocks recovery, which Judgment variants appreciate. Tera Poison gives Arceus-Dark a much-needed resistance to Koraidon's Low Kick, Zacian-C's Play Rough, and Calyrex-S's Grass Knot while also letting it absorb tedious Toxic Spikes. Arceus-Dark fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, which appreciate its ability to check Extreme Killer Arceus and soft check Calyrex-S. Arceus-Dark struggles with physical attackers such as Koraidon and Zacian-C, so checks to them such as Landorus-T, Skeledirge, and Toxapex are appreciated. Since Arceus-Dark can't run Heavy-Duty Boots, it fails to effectively check Calyrex-S in the long run, so Ting-Lu and Arceus help check Calyrex-S more effectively throughout the game, which is appreciated.

Will-O-Wisp prevents Pokemon like Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Zacian-C from safely switching in on Arceus-Fairy. Taunt prevents Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Toxapex from setting up entry hazards and opposing Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, and Tera Fire physical attackers such as the aforementioned Will-O-Wisp targets.Both Tera Fire and Tera Water give Arceus-Fairy key resistances to attacks like Koraidon's Flare Blitz and Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade, with Tera Water additionally helping against Kyogre's STAB moves and Tera Fire improving the matchup against opposing Arceus-Fairy. Tera Poison removes Arceus-Fairy's Steel-type weakness, lets it block Toxic from Pokemon like Eternatus and Toxapex, and lets it absorb Toxic Spikes. On hyper offense teams, Arceus-Fairy appreciates Pokemon like Calyrex-S, Arceus-Ground, Swords Dance Koraidon, and Extreme Killer Arceus, which benefit from it countering their checks in Ting-Lu and Landorus-T. On more balance-oriented teams, physical attackers such as Koraidon and Zacian-C can overwhelm Arceus-Fairy, so defensive checks to them in Landorus-T, Toxapex, and Skeledirge are appreciated.

Tera Water gives Arceus-Fairy a resistance to attacks like Koraidon's Flare Blitz, Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade, and Choice Scarf Kyogre's Water Spout, making it harder to revenge kill and giving it more opportunities to set up. Tera Poison removes Arceus-Fairy's Steel weakness, provides it with an immunity to Toxic from foes like Toxapex and Eternatus, and lets it absorb bothersome Toxic Spikes. Tera Ground removes Arceus-Fairy's weakness to Behemoth Blade and lets +1 Earth Power OHKO Zacian-C and Toxapex. Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy fits on balance, bulky offense, and hyper offense teams that appreciate its ability to block Koraidon's Scale Shot and be a dangerous setup sweeper. Unlike bulkier Arceus-Fairy sets, Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy is unable to switch into Koraidon, and Pokemon like Zacian-C and Choice Specs Calyrex-S can revenge kill it, so on balance and bulky offense teams, it appreciates teammates such as Toxapex, Skeledirge, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu checking these foes. On hyper offense teams, teammates like Calyrex-S and Arceus can take advantage of Zacian-C and opposing Calyrex-S for Arceus-Fairy. Hyper offense teams can also run an entry hazard lead like Glimmora or Ribombee to weaken Pokemon for Arceus-Fairy with Spikes or let it outspeed foes such as Choice Specs Calyrex-S, Zacian-C, and Choice Scarf Koraidon via Sticky Web, respectively.

Additionally, Arceus-Fairy threatens common defensive staples such as Ting-Lu, Arceus-Dark, and Landorus-T with Judgment. Defensive Arceus-Fairy is particularly difficult to switch into, as Will-O-Wisp can cripple Zacian-C, which would otherwise be able to switch in safely on Arceus-Fairy. Taunt prevents entry hazards from being set and stops Clodsire, Eternatus, and Toxapex from using Toxic; it also prevents recovery, giving Arceus-Fairy the upper hand against other Arceus formes and stopping its checks such as Clodsire and Eternatus from taking advantage of forcing it out. Alternatively, Calm Mind, which can be used against the many Pokemon Arceus-Fairy forces out, turns it into a dangerous setup sweeper and troubles special wallbreakers that could otherwise muscle through it, such as Kyogre, Miraidon, and Calyrex-S. 16 Speed EVs allow for Arceus-Fairy to outrun neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon, such as Kyogre and Giratina-O. Tera Poison complements Calm Mind well, as it allows Arceus-Fairy to set up on Poison-types such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Eternatus that otherwise check it. Tera Poison also maintains a useful resistance to Koraidon's Fighting-type moves and lets Arceus-Fairy remove Toxic Spikes, but the weaknesses it gives are often exploited by Calyrex-S and Arceus-Ground. Tera Water offers crucial resistances to Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade and Koraidon's Flare Blitz, as well as a resistance to Kyogre's STAB moves, but it creates weaknesses to Miraidon's Electric-type attacks and Kyogre's Thunder. Arceus-Fairy is an outstanding choice on balance and bulky offense teams, which benefit from its defensive utility and remarkable offensive capabilities. Calyrex-S highly appreciates support from Arceus-Fairy, as Arceus-Fairy beats several of its checks in Ting-Lu, Arceus, Wo-Chien, and Arceus-Dark, as well as beating Pokemon that can revenge kill it in Giratina-O and Choice Scarf Koraidon. In turn, Calyrex-S can break through Arceus-Fairy's Poison-type defensive checks. Powerful Ground-type Pokemon, such as Arceus-Ground and Groudon, make great teammates for Calm Mind variants of Arceus-Fairy, since they threaten many of Arceus-Fairy's biggest obstacles in Eternatus, Clodsire, and Toxapex. Landorus-T, defensive variants of Arceus-Ground, Skeledirge, and Groudon can switch in to one of Arceus-Fairy's biggest offensive threats in Zacian-C. Ting-Lu is a valuable defensive teammate for Arceus-Fairy, as it can check powerful special wallbreakers such as Miraidon, Calyrex-S, and Eternatus. Kyogre is an exceptional teammate for Calm Mind variants of Arceus-Fairy, as it helps to wear down the pair's mutual defensive checks in Eternatus, Clodsire, and Toxapex. Kyogre can also switch in easily on Skeledirge, which Arceus-Fairy would otherwise struggle against.</p>"

On the other hand, Tera Water lets Arceus-Ground resist Water-type attacks from Arceus-Water and Choice-locked Kyogre, allowing it to set up on them with relative ease, resists Flare Blitz from Koraidon, and Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C. Tera Poison allows Arceus-Ground to resist Judgment from Arceus-Fairy, Low Kick from Koraidon, and Grass Knot from Calyrex-S; absorb tedious Toxic Spikes; and become immune to Toxapex's and Eternatus's Toxic.

Taunt shuts down Skeledirge and Toxapex while preventing Ting-Lu from phazing Arceus-Ground. Substitute eases prediction versus Terastallization while also blocking status from the aforementioned Pokemon. Recover lets Arceus-Ground set up on Pokemon such as Landorus-T and have a longer term presence throughout the game but is generally outclassed by the prior two options.

Non-Taunt variants of Arceus-Water can, however, be used as setup fodder by opposing Calm Mind Arceus formes, so teammates that can deal with them—such as Ting-Lu as a defensive check that can phaze them with Whirlwind, revenge killing options such as Zacian-C and Koraidon, and Calyrex-S with Encore—are appreciated.</p>"

Psyshock is chosen over Psychic to more effectively remove Blissey and Clodsire. Trick is a decent midground option that cripples Pokemon Gothitelle might not otherwise beat, like Tera Steel Ting-Lu and Corviknight, but it comes at the cost of greatly reducing Gothitelle's wallbreaking potential, so it should generally be used sparingly. Tera Fairy is used to trap Miraidon, Walking Wake, and Koraidon locked into their Dragon-type STAB moves, and it lets Gothitelle revenge kill weakened Chi-Yu and Chien-Pao locked into a Dark-type STAB move. Alternatively, Tera Grass allows it to 2HKO Ting-Lu and Iron Treads while weakening strong attacks from Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads. Gothitelle fits best on balance teams, where it can make powerful teammates like Miraidon, Koraidon, Iron Bundle, and Chien-Pao into wincons, since it removes many of their common checks. Gothitelle is frail and dislikes hard switching into the walls it seeks to remove, so it greatly appreciates pivots such as Flip Turn Iron Bundle and U-turn users such as Miraidon, Koraidon, and Corviknight. After Gothitelle has picked up a KO, many offensive Pokemon force it out, so standard defensive backbones consisting of Pokemon like Toxapex, Iron Treads, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Skeledirge are vital.</p>"

However, Alomomola is quite passive, succumbs to Koraidon and Chien-Pao after they have boosted their Attack or Terastallized, and is easily trapped by Gothitelle. Whirlpool's passive damage makes up for Alomomola's poor offenses and prevents double switches from the opponent. Play Rough hits Koraidon and Chien-Pao decently hard, and it prevents Miraidon from switching into Alomomola relatively freely. Minimum Speed investment ensures that Corviknight cannot exploit Alomomola to get off a slower U-turn to gain momentum. Tera Fairy resists Koraidon's Fighting-type STAB moves as well as Chien-Pao's Crunch, and it is immune to Dragon-type attacks such as Koraidon's Outrage and Choice-locked Miraidon and Walking Wake's Draco Meteor. Rocky Helmet prevents passivity by punishing Pokemon like Koraidon, Great Tusk, and Chien-Pao. Alomomola appreciates being paired with special walls that can check Pokemon like Miraidon, Iron Bundle, and Flutter Mane for it, such as Clodsire, Blissey, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu. The latter two also especially benefit from Alomomola's Wish due to their lack of reliable recovery. Skeledirge and Gholdengo are also effective partners since they check Breloom for Alomomola.

        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Calyrex-S is an astounding, self-sufficient wallbreaker and sweeper that outspeeds all non-Choice Scarf Pokemon, has the potential to snowball out of control, and fits on a variety of teams. Grass Knot 3HKOes Ting-Lu and provides good neutral coverage against foes such as Arceus and Arceus-Dark. Encore punishes Extreme Killer Arceus and Calm Mind Arceus formes for using a Normal-type or status move, while Psyshock hits Pokemon like Eternatus, Clodsire, and Tera Poison Ting-Lu. Tera Blast is a more niche option for the fourth moveslot that OHKOes Pokemon like Arceus and Wo-Chien at +2 with Tera Fighting. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Calyrex-S repeatedly switch in and fire off attacks, likely allowing it to outlast its checks. At +2, Tera Grass-boosted Grass Knot OHKOes Arceus after slight chip damage and OHKOes Ting-Lu; Tera Grass also allows Calyrex-S to take attacks like Arceus's Shadow Claw, Ting-Lu's Payback, and Arceus-Ground's Earthquake. Tera Ghost lets Astral Barrage achieve feats such as OHKOing Koraidon with a layer of Spikes, OHKOing Zacian-C after Rocky Helmet damage from a teammate, OHKOing defensive Arceus formes at +2, and 3HKOing Terastallized Ting-Lu. All Koraidon sets threaten Ting-Lu and Arceus, the primary switch-ins to Calyrex-S, and Choice Scarf Koraidon can use U-turn to safely pivot Calyrex-S in against Pokemon like Skeledirge, while Scale Shot Koraidon appreciates Encore Calyrex-S taking advantage of Arceus aiming to revenge kill it with Extreme Speed. Calyrex-S pairs well with checks to Arceus and Choice Scarf Koraidon, such as Landorus-T, Toxapex, and Skeledirge. It also appreciates Ting-Lu checking other Choice Scarf users such as Miraidon and opposing Calyrex-S; moreover, Ting-Lu, like Landorus-T, can trade entry hazards with opposing Ting-Lu that switch into Calyrex-S. Calyrex-S, Miraidon, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground can weaken Ting-Lu for each other, potentially enabling one of them to sweep.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Calyrex-S is an incredibly effective wallbreaker with limited defensive counterplay and immense versatility. Trick cripples Calyrex-S's common switch-ins, Ting-Lu and Arceus, and forces Arceus to lock into Shadow Claw. Grass Knot offers good neutral coverage and the ability to hit the omnipresent Ting-Lu. Psyshock is preferred over Psychic because it hits Calm Mind Arceus formes harder, whereas Psychic always 2HKOes Arceus. Tera Ghost boosts Astral Barrage's damage to horrific levels, making it capable of OHKOing defensive Arceus formes after minor chip damage, and the lessened Ghost- and Dark-type weaknesses let Calyrex-S live Arceus's Shadow Claw and Arceus-Dark's Foul Play. Tera Grass instead boosts Grass Knot to be on par with Astral Barrage; it easily 2HKOes Arceus and Arceus-Dark and OHKOes Ting-Lu with two layers of Spikes. Calyrex-S's self sufficiency as a wallbreaker and tendency to overwhelm its checks make it very easy to fit on a variety of teams. Offensive teams appreciate its massive power and the utility provided from it outspeeding and OHKOing most offensive threats and can provide it ample opportunities with U-turn from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Koraidon. Balance teams appreciate its self-sufficient nature while providing it with refuge from revenge killers, like Choice Scarf Koraidon and Giratina-O, with Pokemon like Toxapex and defensive Arceus formes. Koraidon is a great partner that threatens Ting-Lu and Arceus—which would otherwise deter Calyrex-S from using Astral Barrage—and can use U-turn to safely pivot Calyrex-S in against its own counters that Calyrex-S terrifies, like Skeledirge and Toxapex. Miraidon and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground appreciate Calyrex-S beating down Ting-Lu with repeated attacks, making them incredibly difficult for most teams to handle.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Calyrex-S is an amazing revenge killer and late-game cleaner found on balance and bulky offense teams due to it outspeeding the entire metagame, including Scale Shot Koraidon and other Choice Scarf users. Grass Knot deals significant damage to Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground. Psychic allows Calyrex-S to OHKO Koraidon, unlike Psyshock, while also helping out with Extreme Killer Arceus. Trick is used to cripple switch-ins such as Ting-Lu and Extreme Killer Arceus, providing utility especially in matchups where Speed is less important. Tera Ghost boosts the power of Astral Barrage, allowing Calyrex-S to OHKO Zacian-C after some chip damage and 2HKO defensive Arceus formes, and it lets Calyrex-S survive Shadow Claw from Extreme Killer Arceus and Payback from Ting-Lu due to the reduced weaknesses. Tera Grass is an alternative option to 2HKO Ting-Lu with Grass Knot. Calyrex-S appreciates offensive teammates such as Koraidon, Zacian-C, and Extreme Killer Arceus, which can threaten its checks such as Ting-Lu, opposing Arceus, and Arceus-Dark; in return, it threatens their checks such as Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Landorus-T. Miraidon and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground are also excellent teammates for Calyrex-S, as all three weaken each other's checks, potentially leading to one of them cleaning up late-game. Choice Scarf Calyrex-S also frees up an item slot for Koraidon, allowing it to run Swords Dance or Choice Band sets. Partners that can bring Calyrex-S into the field with U-turn, such as Miraidon, Koraidon, and Landorus-T are preferred. Teammates that are able to check Extreme Killer Arceus for Calyrex-S, which can otherwise revenge kill it, such as Landorus-T, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and defensive Arceus formes, are also appreciated.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Life Orb Calyrex-S is the single best wallbreaker in AG, boasting an unrivaled Speed tier and unresisted coverage, outside of Wo-Chien. Nasty Plot, when paired with Psychic, lets Calyrex-S OHKO most Arceus formed after a single boost. Encore is an alternative to take advantage of Arceus by locking it into Extreme Speed and setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Arceus formes. Grass Knot primarily pressures Ting-Lu and Arceus formes. Psyshock is an alternative to Psychic that's stronger against Eternatus and Calm Mind Arceus formes. Tera Grass makes Calyrex-S's Grass Knot much more spammable, letting it 2HKO Arceus formes and more easily break past Ting-Lu, lose a weakness to Shadow Claw from Arceus and Payback from Ting-Lu, and resist Ground-type coverage from Arceus-Ground and Ting-Lu. Calyrex-S is a superb wallbreaker, so partners such as Miraidon and Calm Mind Arceus formes appreciate it forcing progress against special walls in Ting-Lu and Arceus. Calyrex-S can be pressured by a surprise Terastallization from Pokemon such as Giratina-O and Arceus, so having a solid defensive core with Arceus formes and Landorus-T or Toxapex is appreciated to check them. Calyrex-S is also forced out by Choice Scarf users such as Koraidon, Miraidon, Kyogre, and other Calyrex-S, so having checks to them such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, Eternatus, and Arceus, respectively, are appreciated. Entry hazard support from the aforementioned Pokemon and Glimmora also makes it easier for Calyrex-S to break through defensive structures. Hyper offense leads such as Grimmsnarl and Ribombee can support Calyrex-S by making it harder to revenge kill. Finally, Calyrex-S is completely walled by Wo-Chien, so teammates that can take advantage of it such as Koraidon, Zacian-C, Taunt Miraidon, and Arceus-Fairy are appreciated. Koraidon can pivot in Calyrex-S into Koraidon’s checks, such as Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Landorus-T.</p>"

It can switch into these powerful Swords Dance sweepers, beating them or halting their sweep. Torch Song allows it to potentially sweep a weakened team late-game. Earth Power is an option that chips Miraidon and Eternatus as well as giving it a super effective hit against Tera Fire Zacian-C and Koraidon. Fairy is the ideal Tera type, giving Skeledirge an immunity to Koraidon's Dragon-type attacks and removing its weaknesses to Ground- and Ghost-type attacks from foes like Arceus-Ground, Calyrex-S, and Giratina-O. Tera Flying is a niche option that further improves its matchup against Arceus-Ground while avoiding super effective Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C. Skeledirge is a good fit on balance teams that appreciate it checking common setup threats and carrying teammates that make up for its shortcomings and bad matchups. Skeledirge is very vulnerable to Miraidon, Kyogre, Calyrex-S, and Arceus-Ground, so it appreciates teammates like Ting-Lu, Eternatus, Wo-Chien, and Giratina-O to handle these powerful attackers. Likewise, Skeledirge pairs well with fast attackers and priority users such as Calyrex-S, Choice Scarf Koraidon, and Extreme Killer Arceus, which can threaten the foes that force Skeledirge out and revenge kill Pokemon it checks if it is overwhelmed.</p>"

Dazzling Gleam can hit Dark-types such as Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Grimmsnarl super effectively. Tera Blast with Tera Fighting also allows Espathra to nail Dark-types, including Chi-Yu—unlike Dazzling Gleam—as well as Steel-types like Iron Treads and Kingambit. Roost keeps Espathra healthy, making it less susceptible to common priority moves such as Chien-Pao's Ice Shard. Substitute blocks status moves such as Clodsire and Toxapex's Toxic, and it makes Espathra harder to revenge kill. Protect allows Espathra to accumulate a turn of Leftovers recovery and a Speed increase from Speed Boost, which also boosts Stored Power. Electric Seed increases Espathra's Defense, complementing Calm Mind's Special Defense boosts, and contributes towards Stored Power's Base Power. Leftovers synergizes with Substitute and Protect by providing passive recovery. Tera Fairy lets Espathra resist Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao and Kingambit and boosts Dazzling Gleam. Tera Fighting similarly provides a resistance to Dark-type attacks, in addition to making Tera Blast useful, at the cost of leaving Espathra completely reliant on Terastallizing to hit Dark-types. The Speed EVs given allow +2 Speed Espathra to outspeed Iron Bundle in Electric Terrain, which activates its Quark Drive, while the special bulk ensures Espathra survives Choice Scarf Miraidon's Electro Drift and fast Walking Wake's Draco Meteor at +1 Special Defense. The Defense EVs notably let Espathra survive Choice Scarf Tera Fire Koraidon's Flare Blitz when paired with Electric Seed. Espathra appreciates being on more offensive teams, as it is frail and likely cannot threaten to sweep more than once. Since it summons Electric Terrain, Miraidon is an essential partner if Espathra is running Electric Seed. The two Pokemon can also weaken Iron Treads, Clodsire, and Whirlwind Ting-Lu for each other. Fighting-type teammates such as Koraidon and Great Tusk can threaten the Dark- and Steel-types that resist Espathra's Stored Power. Suicide leads in Glimmora, Froslass, and Cloyster can set up entry hazards to weaken opposing Pokemon for Espathra, and they fit well on the offensive teams it finds itself on. Grimmsnarl can effectively double Espathra's poor bulk thanks to Light Screen and Reflect.</p>"

Flip Turn allows Palafin to generate momentum for its team by pivoting out on its checks, bar Clodsire, to bring in a teammate that can threaten them. Zen Headbutt 2HKOes Toxapex, OHKOes Clodsire, and OHKOes Koraidon after one layer of Spikes. Jet Punch is a useful tool that can deal with faster offensive Pokemon such as Tera Fairy Miraidon, Chien-Pao, Great Tusk, and Flutter Mane, turning Palafin into a potent cleaner late-game. Tera Water boosts Wave Crash to impressive levels of damage in rain, allowing it to achieve feats such as 2HKOing Toxapex, Pelipper, and Alomomola, 2HKOing Dondozo after Stealth Rock, and OHKOing Miraidon. Pelipper is an excellent partner for Palafin, as it sets rain and checks Koraidon—whose sun weakens Palafin's Water-type moves. Miraidon is another good teammate, as it threatens the bulky Water-types that check Palafin, such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Dondozo, and safely brings in Palafin via U-turn, while Palafin threatens Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Iron Treads for Miraidon. Similarly, Iron Bundle can pivot Palafin in with U-turn and target Water-types for it with Freeze Dry while Palafin threatens special walls for Iron Bundle. Iron Bundle also offensively checks faster Pokemon that resist Water like Miraidon and Koraidon for Palafin, and it benefits from the rain support Palafin is often paired with. Palafin also appreciates being paired with checks to Miraidon, Iron Bundle, and Walking Wake—which resist Jet Punch and OHKO Palafin in return—such as Iron Treads, specifically for the former, and Clodsire and Blissey for all three. Dugtrio can also be utilized to trap Clodsire and Toxapex as well as faster threats such as Miraidon and Koraidon, freeing up Palafin to wallbreak with its most common defensive checks removed and without fear of being revenge killed.</p>"

U-turn lets Cyclizar regenerate its health back from low ranges, while pivoting in teammates. Rapid Spin lets Cyclizar act as a form of entry hazard removal for its team, but this is generally an emergency removal option. Choice Scarf is generally preferred, since it lets Cyclizar use Shed Tail on usually faster threats like Iron Bundle, non-Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon, Flutter Mane outside of sun, and Chien-Pao lacking Ice Shard. Sitrus Berry, especially when paired with dual screens, provides Cyclizar with a way to recover enough HP to use Shed Tail after taking a hit such as Great Tusk's Headlong Rush, Air Balloon Flutter Mane's Moonblast, or Miraidon's Dazzling Gleam. Tera Fairy lets Cyclizar use Shed Tail against the likes of Koraidon, Miraidon, and Great Tusk by providing a resistance to their Dragon- and Fighting-type coverage. Tera Ghost gives Cyclizar a Fighting-type immunity, granting it the ability to use Shed Tail in front of Choice Scarf Koraidon leads. Cyclizar supports its teammates on hyper offense teams by passing them a Substitute, which lets them avoid status and set up more easily, especially under dual screens. As such, Grimmsnarl is a great partner for making it easier for Cyclizar to pass Substitutes with Shed Tail and for teammates such as Swords Dance Koraidon and Double Dance Miraidon to set up and sweep. Espathra especially enjoys Shed Tail, as a Substitute and dual screens support gives it the longevity to reliably use Calm Mind multiple times. Taunt variants of Koraidon also appreciate Cyclizar using Shed Tail, as it can thwart phazing attempts from Ting-Lu and prevent Toxic Spikes—which bypasses Substitutes—being set up by Toxapex. Great Tusk and Annihilape are also good partners for Cyclizar. Bulk Up variants of Great Tusk are able to take on Koraidon and appreciate Substitute blocking Toxic, giving Great Tusk leeway to set up.

Memento is used to remove any boosts obtained by Pokemon trying to set up on Glimmora while also gaining momentum. Mud Shot is used to deter setup from the likes of Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, and Calm Mind Arceus formes. Tera Steel enables Glimmora to spinblock opposing Glimmora.

With Curse, Dondozo can spiral out of control and gain good sweeping potential. Sleep Talk can be used as an alternative with Rest to stop Pokemon from freely switching into Dondozo during its sleep turns. Miraidon's substantial presence makes Rest unreliable, so Protect can be used instead to scout for Choice item users such as Miraidon, Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and Iron Bundle. With Leftovers, Dondozo can recover much-needed health constantly. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers such as Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and Great Tusk, so they can't attack for free. Tera Fairy allows Dondozo to resist Dark- and Fighting-type moves from Chien-Pao and Koraidon, respectively, while also gaining immunity to Dragon-type moves from the latter.

Rage Fist's Base Power scaling lets Annihilape break through Pokemon with high Defense or Unaware, such as Alomomola or Skeledirge. Drain Punch hits Dark-types that resist Rage Fist and helps keep Annihilape healthy. The given EV spread maximizes Leftovers recovery and lets Annihilape outspeed Gothitelle, which would otherwise cripple it with Trick; the remaining EVs are put into Special Defense, helping it survive hits from Chi-Yu, Iron Bundle, and Miraidon.

Spikes and Toxic Spikes give Clodsire a way to exert offensive pressure, alongside Earthquake which punishes Miraidon and Zacian-C on switch-in. Poison Jab can be used over Toxic or Toxic Spikes to potentially punish Taunt variants of Arceus-Fairy, but it is generally outclassed by the other options.

Tera Steel flips Clodsire's weakness to Ice- and Psychic-type attacks such as Kyogre's Ice Beam and Calyrex-S's Psyshock, while making Clodsire more reliable into Miraidon's Draco Meteor. Tera Dark makes Clodsire weaker to Arceus-Fairy and Miraidon, but checks Calyrex-S without a Fighting- or Fairy-type move, as well as Calm Mind Arceus-Ground.

Swords Dance-boosted Kowtow Cleave allows Kingambit to 2HKO Toxapex and Landorus-T. Iron head hits Arceus-Fairy and other Tera Fairy Pokemon such as Toxapex and Skeledirge. Dread Plate is the preferred item of choice because it boosts Kingambit's Dark-type moves, allowing Sucker Punch to more effectively clean up late-game. Alternatively, Leftovers provides Kingambit with more longevity throughout the game, allowing it to potentially outlast its checks. 132 Speed EVs allow Kingambit to outspeed Skeledirge. Tera Dark boosts Kingambit's Dark-type moves to horrifying levels, allowing it to OHKO Landorus-T, Eternatus, offensive Arceus-Ground, and Miraidon at +2, and OHKO Toxapex with 1 layer of Spikes at +2. +2 Tera Dark Sucker Punch with 5 allies fainted allows Kingambit to achieve amazing feats, such as OHKOing Extreme Killer Arceus and offensive Arceus-Ground, as well as 2HKOing Koraidon and Zacian-C after 1 layer of Spikes. On the other hand, Tera Flying lets Kingambit set-up against Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Arceus-Ground, Landorus-T, and Koraidon. Tera Fire makes Kingambit immune to Will-O-Wisp from Skeledirge, Giratina-O, and defensive Arceus formes and gives it a much-needed resistance to attacks like Koraidon's Flare Blitz and Zacian-C's STAB moves. Kingambit struggles with Toxapex, Landorus-T, and defensive Arceus formes, so offensive checks to them such as Arceus-Ground, Calyrex-S, and Miraidon are appreciated. Kingambit also struggles with Koraidon and Arceus-Ground, so checks to them such as Toxapex, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu are appreciated. Teammates such as Arceus, Koraidon, and Zacian-C weaken physical walls like Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Landorus-T for Kingambit. Arceus in particular shares the burden of checking Calyrex-S alongwith Kingambit. Glimmora as a suicide lead can set up entry hazards, which Kingambit appreciates to break through defensive Arceus formes.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Great Tusk is a strong wallbreaker owing to its high Attack stat and decent bulk, which lets it hard switch into numerous Pokemon and threaten them. Knock Off is used to cripple walls like Pelipper, Alomomola, Corviknight, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and defensive Great Tusk, which can otherwise comfortably switch into Great Tusk. Rapid Spin lets it remove entry hazards and also outspeed the entire unboosted metagame at +1 Speed. An Adamant nature is preferred for maximum power; however, it can outspeed Timid Gholdengo and Chi-Yu with a Jolly nature. Tera Ground significantly boosts Headlong Rush, notably making it OHKO Toxapex and Koraidon while 2HKOing Alomomola. It also removes Great Tusk's weakness to Fairy-type attacks, notably Dazzling Gleam from Miraidon and Moonblast from Flutter Mane. Alternatively, Tera Fighting lets it break through Corviknight with more ease and be less weak to Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle. Koraidon is a phenomenal teammate, as it sets sun to activate Protosynthesis, and it can also bring Great Tusk in via U-turn. Similarly, Miraidon and Iron Bundle can also pivot into Great Tusk, which lets it threaten all their checks. Standard defensive teammates like Clodsire, Corviknight, Toxapex, and Iron Treads are appreciated for helping Great Tusk check offensive threats, and offensive Great Tusk needs this help more than defensive variants. Gothitelle is a great teammate, as it can comfortably trap and remove every Pokemon that checks Great Tusk. Other strong wallbreakers like Choice Specs Iron Bundle, Chi-Yu, and Choice Band Chien-Pao appreciate Great Tusk's support, as it can switch into their checks and force them out, as well as removing entry hazards for them.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Great Tusk is a defensive staple in the metagame due to its high physical bulk and solid utility thanks to Stealth Rock and the ability to remove them from its side using Rapid Spin. Knock Off cripples Ting-Lu and opposing Great Tusk by blocking their passive recovery from Leftovers and removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Pelipper and Rocky Helmet from Toxapex and Alomomola. Alternatively, Play Rough deals high damage to Chien-Pao and Koraidon. Leftovers offers much-needed passive recovery, while Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers such as Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and opposing Great Tusk, especially stopping Koraidon from freely pivoting against Great Tusk into teammates like Chi-Yu and Walking Wake. 40 Speed EVs allows Great Tusk to outspeed Chi-Yu at +1. Tera Fairy makes Great Tusk immune to Dragon-type moves from Koraidon and Miraidon. With Tera Water, Great Tusk resists Ice-type moves from Chien-Pao and Flare Blitz from Koraidon. Tera Ghost grants an immunity to Fighting-type moves from Koraidon and Rapid Spin from opposing Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Koraidon is a great teammate, as it can set up sun for Great Tusk, while it, in return, threatens or cripples walls that check Koraidon, making it easier for Koraidon to deal with them. Great Tusk gets easily pressured by special attackers such as Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, and Miraidon, so special walls such as Corviknight, Blissey, and Clodsire are appreciated as teammates.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Great Tusk's high Attack stat and powerful STAB moves make it a premier revenge killer with Choice Scarf, capable of threatening OHKOes on Miraidon, Iron Bundle, and Chien-Pao. Knock Off and Rapid Spin capitalize on Great Tusk's ability to force switches, potentially crippling the likes of Corviknight, Pelipper, and Alomomola and removing entry hazards in a pinch. Moreover, Knock Off is very useful for popping Gholdengo's Air Balloon. Stone Edge is an alternative to Rapid Spin, enabling a 2HKO on Pelipper and Tera Flying Kingambit. Tera Ground amps up Headlong Rush against foes such as Tera Fairy Miraidon and Annihilape, as well as 2HKOing common Tera Fairy walls like Toxapex and Skeledirge. Tera Fighting boosts Close Combat instead, securing a 2HKO on Corviknight. Tera Fighting also retains a handy resistance to Chien-Pao and Kingambit's Sucker Punch while eliminating an exploitable weakness to Chien-Pao's Ice Shard. Both Tera types provide the necessary boost to OHKO Koraidon and 2HKO Alomomola after Stealth Rock damage. Great Tusk boasts perfect offensive synergy with Miraidon by pressuring Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu. In return, Miraidon scares out Corviknight, Pelipper, and Alomomola. Koraidon pairs nicely with Great Tusk as well, activating Protosynthesis, threatening Corviknight, and overwhelming shared checks in Pelipper, bulky Great Tusk, and Alomomola. In exchange, Great Tusk frightens Toxapex and Skeledirge. Gothitelle traps and removes Corviknight, Pelipper, Alomomola, bulky Great Tusk, and Dondozo, facilitating a late-game sweep. Similarly, special attacking partners like Iron Bundle, Chi-Yu, Walking Wake, and Flutter Mane greatly pressure the aforementioned checks. Great Tusk requires defensive support to fall back on, as it is incapable of revenge killing Choice Scarf and Flame Charge Koraidon, boosted Chien-Pao with Ice Shard, Iron Bundle under Electric Terrain, Flutter Mane under sun, and Choice Scarf and Agility Miraidon, so Toxapex and Clodsire are solid teammates. Lastly, Choice Scarf Great Tusk is easily exploitable once it's locked into Rapid Spin, so Corviknight is a convenient partner that offers additional entry hazard removal with Defog and helps check Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Iron Bundle.</p>"

      "Offensive Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Bulk Up pushes Great Tusk's physical stats into the stratosphere, magnifying its capabilities as a wincon that can brute force through traditional checks like Corviknight and defensive Great Tusk lacking Bulk Up. While boasting less firepower than Headlong Rush, Earthquake has more PP and avoids defense drops, Toxapex's Baneful Bunker, and Rocky Helmet damage from defensive Great Tusk and Alomomola. Boosted Close Combat hits Corviknight for massive amounts of damage and OHKOes Breloom lacking Focus Sash. Alternatively, boosted Knock Off OHKOes offensive Air Balloon Gholdengo and cripples Pelipper and Dondozo. Rapid Spin allows Great Tusk to outpace the entire unboosted metagame after one use and remove entry hazards from Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Substitute can set up a buffer against revenge killers—especially special variants such as Miraidon, Iron Bundle, and Flutter Mane—in the process of boosting past a check like Corviknight. It also allows Great Tusk to avoid status, easing setup against Pokemon such as Toxapex and Clodsire. Tera Ground powers up Great Tusk's main STAB move, notably securing an OHKO on Iron Bundle with Headlong Rush and Toxapex with +1 Earthquake. Tera Steel grants resistances to Ice-, Flying-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type moves instead, potentially flipping the matchup against Chien-Pao, Brave Bird Corviknight, Flutter Mane, and Miraidon. It also allows Headlong Rush variants to avoid Baneful Bunker's poison. Paired with Knock Off, Tera Steel can even allow Great Tusk to overwhelm Pelipper lacking Surf. A Jolly nature may be used to outspeed Modest Chi-Yu, but is generally inferior to an Adamant nature due to a noticeable drop in power. Great Tusk fits well on both balance and offensive teams as a threatening wincon that can compress entry hazard removal. It is imperative to pair Great Tusk with teammates that can take advantage of obstacles like Pelipper, Alomomola, and Dondozo; Breloom on hyper offense, Gothitelle and Walking Wake on balance, and Miraidon and Iron Bundle on both archetypes can help in this regard. Similarly, Koraidon and Chien-Pao can lure in or overwhelm these shared obstacles on both balance and hyper offense; the former also activates Great Tusk's Protosynthesis. Focus Sash Breloom especially appreciates Great Tusk removing entry hazards, overwhelming Corviknight, and potentially luring Air Balloon Gholdengo in and punishes it with Knock Off. Great Tusk requires a defensive backbone on balance teams against the likes of Miraidon, Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, and Flutter Mane. A core consisting of Clodsire, Toxapex, and Corviknight can help check these threats. Defog Corviknight is especially crucial in case Rapin Spin is forgone for Substitute. Moreover, both Clodsire and Toxapex can absorb Toxic Spikes, alleviating a lot of pressure from Rapid Spin variants.</p>"

Its Fairy typing additionally lets it pivot into Miraidon's and Walking Wake's Draco Meteor and force them out with Moonblast. Psyshock is crucial coverage, denting Clodsire, Iron Moth, and opposing Assault Vest Flutter Mane. Thunderbolt targets common switch-ins to Moonblast in Toxapex and Corviknight. Tera Fire Mystical Fire secures a 2HKO on Iron Treads, which becomes an OHKO in sun. Shadow Ball may be run instead to 2HKO Skeledirge and check Espathra and opposing Flutter Mane more reliably. Tera Fire also grants resistances to Chi-Yu's Fire-type moves, Iron Bundle's Ice-type moves, Gholdengo's Make It Rain, and Iron Moth's Fiery Dance. Tera Fairy can be run over Tera Fire to OHKO Miraidon, 2HKO Ting-Lu, and gain a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. The given EV spread lets Flutter Mane avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage and outspeed Chi-Yu. Flutter Mane fits best on balance and bulky offensive teams as a non-passive means of checking Iron Bundle. Miraidon, Koraidon, Great Tusk, and Chien-Pao synergize superbly as offensive teammates, appreciating Flutter Mane's ability to stifle Iron Bundle for a while. Alongside Miraidon, Flutter Mane can quickly overwhelm shared checks in Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Clodsire while also denting Toxapex and Corviknight a lot harder with Thunderbolt, courtesy of Electric Terrain. Similarly, Koraidon's Orichalcum Pulse activates Protosynthesis and boosts Mystical Fire, drastically raising Flutter Mane's damage output. In addition, Koraidon, Great Tusk, and Chien-Pao can all take advantage of Iron Treads, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Flutter Mane is exceptionally frail on the physical side, so proper support against Chien-Pao, Koraidon, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk is a must. Moreover, Flutter Mane cannot hold off Iron Bundle indefinitely and fails to check Miraidon and Walking Wake safely. A defensive backbone consisting of Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clodsire can help check these threats. Clodsire and Iron Treads can also hold off the dangerous Double Dance Miraidon, which can otherwise use Flutter Mane as setup bait.</p>"

U-turn generates momentum for Slither Wing's team against Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge, and it importantly allows Slither Wing to avoid being trapped by Gothitelle. Close Combat OHKOes Iron Bundle and Chi-Yu and 2HKOes Miraidon, which are thresholds Body Press fails to reach. Will-O-Wisp cripples Great Tusk—meaning Slither Wing is not reduced to Bulk Up fodder by non-Substitute sets—Annihilape, Breloom, and Kingambit, and it additionally punishes Pokemon such as Toxapex and Corviknight for switching in. Tera Water resists Fire-type attacks from Koraidon and Chi-Yu, Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle, and Water-type attacks from Iron Bundle and Palafin, allowing for a last-ditch counterattack with either Will-O-Wisp or Close Combat. The given EVs outspeed Adamant Breloom with the remainder put in physical bulk. On its own, Slither Wing struggles to take on Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and special threats including Miraidon, Flutter Mane, and Walking Wake, so checks to them—such as Toxapex and Clodsire, which can handle all of them between the pair—are essential teammates. Entry hazard removal from Great Tusk or Iron Treads is also greatly appreciated, since even Heavy-Duty Boots variants are susceptible to opposing Great Tusk's Knock Off. The former Pokemon can also use Knock Off to remove opposing Rocky Helmet, allowing U-turn to be spammed more freely. Toxapex, Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu especially enjoy Slither Wing's ability to check Great Tusk and Breloom for them. Koraidon is a notable partner, as its sun increases Morning Sun's recovery and activates Slither Wing's Protosynthesis.

Occa Berry weakens Overheat and Mystical Fire from Miraidon and Flutter Mane, respectively. Alternatively, Leftovers can be used for greater longevity. 16 Defense IVs ensure that Iron Treads's Special Defense is boosted in Electric Terrain, allowing it to more effectively check Miraidon. Tera Fairy provides a resistance to Koraidon's Close Combat, neutrality to Miraidon and Flutter Mane's coverage moves, and immunity to Miraidon's Draco Meteor. Tera Water instead lets Iron Treads resist Fire-type attacks from the aforementioned Miraidon and Flutter Mane, Water-type attacks from Palafin-H and Iron Bundle, as well as Iron Bundle's Ice Beam. Iron Treads is able to support offensive teammates that are susceptible to entry hazards such as Choice Specs Iron Bundle and Choice Band Chien-Pao thanks to Rapid Spin, and it can also aid Miraidon and Koraidon by switching into Fairy- and Dragon-type moves aimed at them.

Substitute also enables Iron Bundle to easily outplay Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao and Kingambit, as well as safely scout for opposing Terastallization.

Leech Seed reduces Wo-Chien's passivity while allowing teammates to heal after switching in. Ruination hits foes like Arceus-Fairy, Ting-Lu, and Giratina-O. Foul Play is a stronger alternative against physical attackers like Arceus and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground that also does a decent chunk of damage to Koraidon and Zacian-C and allows Wo-Chien to punish physical attackers that have Taunt. Knock Off gives Wo-Chien more of a niche due relevant Pokemon that learn it being rare, and it is useful against foes like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T. However, Arceus formes, which can absorb Knock Off without losing their items, are quite omnipresent. Protect lets Wo-Chien safely rack up Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery. Alternatively, Taunt shuts down setup and entry hazard Pokemon such as Arceus formes and Ting-Lu on the switch. Tera Poison gives Wo-Chien key resistances to attacks like Koraidon's Low Kick, Zacian-C's Play Rough, Double Dance Miraidon's Dazzling Gleam, and the omnipresent U-turn from foes like Landorus-T, Koraidon, and Miraidon while also offering an immunity to Toxic and letting Wo-Chien absorb Toxic Spikes. However, Tera Poison also makes Wo-Chien weak to Ground-type moves from Arceus-Ground and Psychic-type moves from Calyrex-S, respectively. Wo-Chien fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to check Calyrex-S and Arceus-Ground while offering good recovery via Leech Seed to teammates. Wo-Chien benefits from teammates such as Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Landorus-T, which check Koraidon and Zacian-C for it. Special attackers in Arceus-Fairy, Substitute Kyogre, and Eternatus trouble Wo-Chien, so offensive checks to them such as Zacian-C, Choice Scarf Koraidon, Arceus, and Calyrex-S are appreciated. Water Absorb Closdire as a defensive teammate checks Arceus-Fairy, Kyogre, and Eternatus while setting up hazards.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Chien-Pao is one of the most formidable wallbreakers in AG thanks to its incredible Speed tier, outpacing almost the entire metagame, and massive firepower. Icicle Crash is the preferred Ice-type STAB move due to its higher power, flinch chance to potentially beat walls like Corviknight and Garganacl, and avoidance of adverse contact effects like Baneful Bunker and Rocky Helmet; however, Ice Spinner is more consistent and can also remove Electric Terrain. Ice Shard gives Chien-Pao a powerful way to revenge kill opposing offensive threats, notably threatening Flutter Mane, Koraidon, Miraidon, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk. Sucker Punch is also an option, as it hits Choice Scarf Chi-Yu and Iron Bundle much harder while still threatening Flutter Mane and Miraidon. In the last slot, Sacred Sword hits Garganacl and OHKOes Kingambit and Chi-Yu, which would otherwise switch in fairly safely and force Chien-Pao out. Alternatively, running Ice Shard and Sucker Punch together is also an option, allowing Chien-Pao to pressure both Iron Bundle and Koraidon effectively while also ensuring that it beats other Chien-Pao consistently. An Adamant nature is preferable as it guarantees a 2HKO on Toxapex after Stealth Rock with Crunch while also getting favorable rolls against Corviknight and Ting-Lu, although Jolly is also viable in order to speed tie with unboosted Miraidon, Koraidon, and Flutter Mane. Chien-Pao's best Tera type is Dark, which drastically boosts Crunch, making it much easier for it to break through Alomomola, Corviknight, and Toxapex while guaranteeing an OHKO on Iron Bundle with Sucker Punch. Tera Ice is also viable, notably netting an OHKO against Miraidon and a good chance to OHKO Koraidon with Ice Shard. Chien-Pao fits well on all manner of balance teams, pairing extremely well with Miraidon thanks to their ability to effectively pressure each other's checks, with Chien-Pao threatening Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads while Miraidon threatens Corviknight, Alomomola, and Toxapex. Gothitelle is also a great teammate that can trap and remove Chien-Pao's checks, notably beating Toxapex and Alomomola. Due to its frailty and its tendency to be forced out after locking into a move, Chien-Pao needs a sturdy defensive backbone to support it, so balance staples like Corviknight, Ting-Lu, Toxapex, and Skeledirge can all be good teammates for their ability to handle Pokemon like Koraidon, Great Tusk, and Miraidon which might attempt to take advantage of Chien-Pao.</p>"

Swords Dance allows Chien-Pao to break through walls such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Corviknight. Ice Spinner can be considered over Icicle Crash due to its perfect accuracy, but it is a slightly weaker contact move that cannot flinch. Sucker Punch is the preferred priority move option, allowing it to OHKO Flutter Mane without a boost, as well as Iron Bundle and Miraidon after a Swords Dance. Alternatively, Ice Shard OHKOes Koraidon, Miraidon, and Flutter Mane at +2 Attack after Stealth Rock. Heavy-Duty Boots is the best item on this set, but Life Orb and Focus Sash are solid picks on hyper offense builds and other teams with good entry hazard control. Life Orb lets Chien-Pao get some crucial OHKOs at +2 Attack, notably against Miraidon and Koraidon with Ice Shard and Corviknight and Toxapex with Crunch. Tera Dark makes its Dark-type moves stronger while shedding the weaknesses from its Ice typing, notably reducing Stealth Rock damage and weakening Iron Head and Body Press from Corviknight as well as Torch Song from Skeledirge. Chien-Pao fits best on offensive teams and flourishes with other wallbreakers like Miraidon, Koraidon, Iron Bundle, and offensive Great Tusk. On bulkier builds, teammates like defensive Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads set entry hazards while checking fast Pokemon like Koraidon and Miraidon. If forgoing Heavy-Duty Boots, it is essential to pair Chien-Pao with lead entry hazard setters like Glimmora and Froslass on offensive teams and Iron Treads and Great Tusk on bulkier teams, as they additionally prevent opposing entry hazards from going up.</p>"

An incredible defensive profile allows Ting-Lu to be a consistent, valuable check to Calyrex-S, Miraidon, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Taunt prevents Arceus formes from setting up or healing and shuts down Toxapex. Ruination reduces Ting-Lu's passivity and hits Giratina-O and Landorus-T. Earthquake hits Miraidon and prevents Zacian-C from safely switching in, while Payback OHKOes Calyrex-S and—with Ting-Lu's low Speed—consistently has 100 Base Power. Whirlwind can be used over Taunt or Ruination on teams that are more vulnerable to setup sweepers like Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Fissure is a niche alternative over Ruination that helps with Taunt Arceus formes and is more of a threat to setup Pokemon. Tera Grass, Poison, and Steel all allow it to resist Calyrex-S's Grass Knot and offer varying defensive utility, with Tera Grass helping with Kyogre and Arceus-Ground, Tera Poison helping with Koraidon and Toxic Spikes, and Tera Steel helping with Arceus and Miraidon. Ting-Lu's defensive utility and the pressure brought by its entry hazards are appreciated by nearly every team bar hyper offense. Ting-Lu is vulnerable to strong physical attackers like Zacian-C and Koraidon, so teammates that can check them, like Landorus-T on bulky offense teams and Toxapex and Skeledirge on balance teams, make for natural partners. Extreme Killer Arceus is a great partner that helps check Calyrex-S and appreciates Ting-Lu's Spikes bringing opposing Pokemon into Extreme Speed range. Zacian-C is another attacker that loves Spikes weakening its targets and checks Arceus-Fairy in return.</p>"

Overheat is its strongest STAB move, which allows it to OHKO the bulkiest Pokemon like Blissey and Ting-Lu especially when boosted by Tera Fire and sun. Dark Pulse lets it pressure Fire-resistant foes like Miraidon, Toxapex, Pelipper, Alomomola, and Garganacl more easily. Fire Blast is a stronger option than Flamethrower that doesn't drop Special Attack, which lets Chi-Yu break through Garganacl and Blissey after minimal chip damage when boosted by sun and Tera Fire. Alternatively, Psychic may be used to deal greater damage to Toxapex and Koraidon. Tera Fire is mandatory to boost Chi-Yu's strength and let it spam its Fire-type moves more freely. Choice Scarf Chi-Yu is unreliable at breaking stall teams, so it is necessary to pair it with wallbreakers that perform this role such as Choice Band Chien-Pao, offensive Great Tusk, Gothitelle, and Swords Dance + Life Orb Koraidon. Koraidon in particular is mandatory to have as a teammate, as it sets sun, which makes up for the power lost by opting for Choice Scarf on Chi-Yu. Additionally, it also creates many opportunities for Chi-Yu to switch in safely thanks to U-turn and Chi-Yu's ability to exploit common Koraidon checks. Defensive partners like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Clodsire, and Toxapex can set and remove entry hazards for Chi-Yu, allowing it to freely switch in multiple times and break teams more easily, and they also check strong revenge killers like Choice Scarf Koraidon, Miraidon, and Quark Drive-boosted Iron Bundle.</p>"

Dark Pulse allows Chi-Yu to immediately threaten Fire-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Garganacl, 2HKOing or OHKOing them without sun. Fire Blast can reach important damage thresholds, such as 2HKOing Blissey, without the Special Attack drop that accompanies Overheat, with Psychic instead preventing Toxapex from scouting Chi-Yu's move. Tera Fire turns Chi-Yu's 2HKOs against Pokemon like Toxapex and Double Dance Miraidon into OHKOs under sun, and it guarantees 2HKOs on even the bulkiest defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Garganacl, OHKOing them in sun and with minor chip damage. A Modest nature is preferred, but a Timid nature can be considered if Jolly Great Tusk is an issue. Koraidon is an incredible partner, setting sun and bringing Chi-Yu in with U-turn; in exchange, Chi-Yu greatly threatens all of Koraidon's checks. Pivots such as Corviknight and the aforementioned Koraidon are greatly appreciated, as they can let Chi-Yu switch in without worrying about its poor bulk. Entry hazard removal from Great Tusk, Corviknight, or Iron Treads is very helpful due to Chi-Yu's weakness to Stealth Rock and its tendency to switch out after a KO. Chi-Yu is often forced out by faster Pokemon like Miraidon and Koraidon, so defensive switch-ins to them like Clodsire, Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight are good partners.</p>"

Alternatively, Knock Off removes items from switch-ins like Skeledirge and Corviknight, but its outclassed by Psyshock on most teams. Tera Fairy powers up Iron Valiant's Moonblast while maintaining its resistance to Chien-Pao and Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Breloom's Mach Punch, as well as maintaining its immunity to Dragon-type moves.

Miraidon is a fantastic partner because it sets Electric Terrain for Iron Valiant. Additionally, Miraidon can pivot into Iron Valiant so it can threaten its checks.

Tera Fairy is great defensively, letting Miraidon set up on Pokemon such as Koraidon, Giratina-O, Arceus-Ground, and opposing Miraidon; it also lets Dazzling Gleam 2HKO Ting-Lu with a layer of Spikes and Arceus-Ground at +1. Tera Dragon is used to remove Miraidon's Ground weakness and boost Dragon Pulse's damage, letting it 2HKO Clodsire and Ting-Lu and OHKO offensive Arceus-Ground at +1 after a layer of Spikes. 92 Speed EVs let Miraidon outpace Choice Scarf Calyrex-S after Agility. Miraidon fits best on bulky offense and hyper offense teams, which try to overwhelm the opposing team. Dual screens let Miraidon set up more easily and make it harder to revenge kill, so Grimmsnarl is a great teammate on hyper offense teams. Miraidon also appreciates entry hazards from Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Glimmora, which can put Pokemon into its KO range. Miraidon can struggle to break through walls such as Clodsire and Ting-Lu, so it pairs well with other offensive Pokemon such as Calyrex-S, Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, and Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy, which can pressure the aforementioned walls for Miraidon. In return, Miraidon can weaken the same walls for these teammates to pick up on. Koraidon and Zacian-C threaten Ting-Lu and lure in physically defensive walls such as Toxapex and Skeledirge for Miraidon to set up against; Miraidon, Koraidon, and Zacian-C can also weaken defensive Arceus-Ground for each other.</p>"

      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>Agility Miraidon is a potent wallbreaker and late-game cleaner thanks to its incredible Special Attack and decent natural bulk. Dragon Pulse is chosen over Draco Meteor because of Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop, which would end a sweep haphazardly. Solar Beam, when paired with Koraidon's sun, hits Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground. Tera Grass powers up Solar Beam enough to OHKO Ting-Lu after one layer of Spikes while resisting Ground-type moves from both Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground. The given EV spread outspeeds Choice Scarf Calyrex-S after an Agility, lives Zacian-C's Play Rough without Intrepid Sword active, and lives Choice Specs Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. Miraidon fits well on offensive teams as a strong wallbreaker and cleaner; partners like Calyrex-S, Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, and offensive Eternatus appreciate Miraidon luring Ting-Lu or at least forcing it to Terastallize. Pokemon that can Terastallize to beat Miraidon—such as Ting-Lu, Tera Grass Calyrex-S, and Tera Ground Zacian-C—are issues for it. Therefore, Miraidon pairs well with Pokemon that can take advantage of these, such as Extreme Killer Arceus and the aforementioned Calyrex-S. Extreme Killer Arceus can revenge kill Miraidon, so partners such as Landorus-T, Zacian-C, and Encore Calyrex-S are appreciated for maintaining offensive momentum. Koraidon is a mandatory partner for setting sun and easily pivoting Miraidon in on its checks such as Landorus-T, Skeledirge, and Toxapex.</p>"

        "description": "<p>A good Special Attack stat, good typing, and Choice Specs make Walking Wake a devastating wallbreaker. Hydro Steam is a powerful STAB option that is extremely difficult to switch into under sun, especially with the Protosynthesis boost. It notably 2HKOes Toxapex, Miraidon, and Koraidon, as well as OHKOing Corviknight and Iron Bundle. Draco Meteor OHKOes Dragon-types such as Koraidon, Miraidon, and opposing Walking Wake, preventing them from switching in, while also 2HKOing Water Absorb Clodsire and OHKOing Toxapex in sun. Flamethrower lets Walking Wake deal with Tera Steel Clodsire. Hydro Pump provides a strong Water-type STAB move outside of sun, and it can also be used with Pelipper's rain, boosting Walking Wake's damage output to massive levels. Alternatively, Dragon Pulse can be used for greater consistency than Draco Meteor, but note that it doesn't 2HKO Clodsire. Tera Water boosts Walking Wake's Hydro Steam to an insane level, allowing it to 2HKO Blissey and OHKO Assault Vest Flutter Mane in sun. Tera Water also lets Walking Wake survive Moonblast from Flutter Mane, Dragon Claw from Koraidon, and Freeze-Dry from Iron Bundle in a pinch. Because Walking Wake can be easily revenge killed, it fits best on balance teams alongside walls such as Clodsire, Corviknight, and Toxapex. Physical attackers like Koraidon and Chien-Pao are good teammates, as they pressure Walking Wake's checks in Blissey and Water Absorb Clodsire. Koraidon in particular sets sun for Walking Wake, and it potentially lets Walking Wake in safely through U-turn, allowing it to pressure Koraidon's checks in Skeledirge, Pelipper, and Toxapex.</p>"
