        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Chi-Yu is one of the metagame's most devastating wallbreakers. Beads of Ruin and a high Special Attack stat let it consistently force a KO whenever it comes in. Overheat allows Chi-Yu to OHKO or 2HKO even bulky resistant foes, with Flamethrower having perfect accuracy and not dropping Chi-Yu's Special Attack. Dark Pulse allows Chi-Yu to immediately threaten Fire-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Garganacl, 2HKOing or OHKOing them without sun. Fire Blast can reach important damage thresholds, such as 2HKOing Blissey, without the Special Attack drop that accompanies Overheat, with Psychic instead preventing Toxapex from scouting Chi-Yu's move. Tera Fire turns Chi-Yu's 2HKOs against Pokemon like Toxapex and Double Dance Miraidon into OHKOs under sun, and it guarantees 2HKOs on even the bulkiest defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Garganacl, OHKOing them in sun and with minor chip damage. A Modest nature is preferred, but a Timid nature can be considered if Jolly Great Tusk is an issue. Koraidon is an incredible partner, setting sun and bringing Chi-Yu in with U-turn; in exchange, Chi-Yu greatly threatens all of Koraidon's checks. Pivots such as Corviknight and the aforementioned Koraidon are greatly appreciated, as they can let Chi-Yu switch in without worrying about its poor bulk. Entry hazard removal from Great Tusk, Corviknight, or Iron Treads is very helpful due to Chi-Yu's weakness to Stealth Rock and its tendency to switch out after a KO. Chi-Yu is often forced out by faster Pokemon like Miraidon and Koraidon, so defensive switch-ins to them like Clodsire, Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight are good partners.</p> "
