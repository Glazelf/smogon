From there, it can attempt a reverse sweep. Ditto's EVs and IVs minimize Speed and maximize bulk: this helps against opposing Ditto by triggering its own Imposter latest to make the foe run out of PP first, as well as minimizing Struggle damage. Tera Fairy elevates Ditto against a Choice Scarf Miraidon or Koraidon that will likely attack Ditto with a Dragon-type move. Ditto eases the pressure on the defensive backbone of a team by revenge killing some common threats, so it is advised to fit more offensive wallbreakers on the team like Chien-Pao, Miraidon, Koraidon, and Iron Bundle. However, Ditto still fails to revenge kill bulkier sweepers like Double Dance Miraidon, Bulk Up Koraidon and Great Tusk, and Quark Drive and Protosynthesis users like Iron Valiant, Iron Bundle, and Flutter Mane. Additionally, most sweepers can take advantage of Ditto with a surprise Terastallization, such as Tera Fire Koraidon, Tera Fairy Miraidon, and Tera Water Gholdengo. Thus, backup checks to them like defensive Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, Clodsire, Alomomola, and Toxapex are appreciated. These teammates additionally check wallbreakers like Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, and Great Tusk.</p> "

Hurricane nails Koraidon and Great Tusk if they try to set up on Pelipper. Knock Off allows it to cripple common switch-ins like Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Clodsire. Alternatively, Surf is a fairly strong STAB move in rain that punishes Tera Fire Koraidon and Chi-Yu, and it still pressures passive switch-ins. With minimum Speed to be slower than Ting-Lu and Corviknight, U-turn gives safe entry to a teammate of its choice. U-turn also lets it escape Gothitelle, harming it and preserving momentum, as it tries to hard switch in. Tera Fairy is used to defeat a Koraidon locked into Outrage or Wild Charge, which would otherwise break through Pelipper, and also to deal with Thunderbolt from Gothitelle, Crunch from Chien-Pao, and Dark Pulse from Chi-Yu in a pinch. Miraidon and Iron Bundle are the biggest threats to Pelipper, able to switch into it multiple times fairly easily. Hence, it is mandatory to pair Pelipper with appropriate checks like Clodsire, Blissey, and Iron Treads, which will additionally set entry hazards to stop them from switching in for free. Clodsire especially gives solid support by tanking rain-boosted Water-type moves from Iron Bundle, Tera Water Miraidon, and Walking Wake. Physical attackers like Swords Dance Koraidon and Chien-Pao can easily break through Pelipper, so it is advised to have backup checks to them like Great Tusk, Skeledirge, and Garganacl. These threats can also be checked offensively with Palafin, Floatzel, Iron Bundle, Walking Wake, and Miraidon, which also make the most out of Pelipper's rain. Dugtrio can trap and eliminate Miraidon and Iron Bundle once they are weakened; also, Pelipper lets Dugtrio get many trapping opportunities thanks to its slow U-turn pivoting. Pelipper is prone to losing its item to Knock Off, so it is essential to pair it with entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Corviknight.</p> "

Torch Song is Skeledirge's most reliable STAB move and gives it the potential to snowball late-game into a sweeper. Will-O-Wisp prevents physical attackers like Koraidon, Great Tusk, and Chien-Pao from setting up on it and also annoys passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Alomomola.

Taunt is also an option to shut down recovery attempts and status moves altogether, while Flip Turn can be used to pivot out on Iron Bundle's checks and gain momentum. Tera Ice, in addition to powering up Ice Beam and Freeze-Dry, resists opposing Freeze-Dry, while Tera Water Hydro Pump 2HKOes Ting-Lu and specially defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock.

Icicle Crash is the preferred Ice-type STAB move due to its higher power, flinch chance to potentially beat walls like Corviknight and Garganacl, and avoidance of adverse contact effects like Baneful Bunker and Rocky Helmet; however, Ice Spinner is more consistent and can also remove Electric Terrain. Ice Shard gives Chien-Pao a powerful way to revenge kill opposing offensive threats, notably threatening Flutter Mane, Koraidon, Miraidon, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk. Sucker Punch is also an option, as it hits Choice Scarf Chi-Yu and Iron Bundle much harder while still threatening Flutter Mane and Miraidon. In the last slot, Sacred Sword hits Garganacl and OHKOes Kingambit and Chi-Yu, which would otherwise switch in fairly safely and force Chien-Pao out. Alternatively, running Ice Shard and Sucker Punch together is also an option, allowing Chien-Pao to pressure both Iron Bundle and Koraidon effectively while also ensuring that it beats other Chien-Pao consistently. An Adamant nature is preferable as it guarantees a 2HKO on Toxapex after Stealth Rock with Crunch while also getting favorable rolls against Corviknight and Ting-Lu, although Jolly is also viable in order to speed tie with unboosted Miraidon, Koraidon, and Flutter Mane. Chien-Pao's best Tera type is Dark, which drastically boosts Crunch, making it much easier for it to break through Alomomola, Corviknight, and Toxapex while guaranteeing an OHKO on Iron Bundle with Sucker Punch. Tera Ice is also viable, notably netting an OHKO against Miraidon and a good chance to OHKO Koraidon with Ice Shard.

Gothitelle is also a great teammate that can trap and remove Chien-Pao's checks, notably beating Toxapex and Alomomola.

Parabolic Charge is an alternative to Electro Drift on sets with Substitute in order to recover health while also making Miraidon a good late-game cleaner. Tera Dragon lets Miraidon OHKO Ting-Lu and Clodsire using Draco Meteor after a single Calm Mind boost. Entry hazard removal options such as Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads are great teammates, as Miraidon can wear down quickly due to Life Orb recoil and hazards; those teammates can also soak up offensive pressure from Pokemon such as Iron Bundle, Koraidon, and Flutter Mane, respectively. Corviknight can also pivot Miraidon in, giving it a great opportunity to set up. Physical attackers such as Great Tusk, Koraidon, and Chien-Pao are good teammates, as they can easily force out special walls such as Blissey, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu, making it easier for Miraidon to sweep.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Miraidon can break through all of its checks owing to its excellent stats and stellar movepool, making it the strongest wallbreaker in Anything Goes. Overheat hits Iron Treads and also eases predictions against defensive cores such as Corviknight + Great Tusk. Tera Dragon boosts Draco Meteor, notably allowing Miraidon to 2HKO Ting-Lu while also getting rid of its weakness to Dugtrio. A Timid nature allows Miraidon to Speed tie against Koraidon and Chien-Pao, but Modest may be used to further boost its strength. Miraidon is threatened by revenge killers like Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, and Choice Scarf users like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Great Tusk, so special walls like Clodsire and Blissey and physical walls like Toxapex, Great Tusk, and Alomomola are used to soak the offensive pressure. Dugtrio can trap Iron Bundle, Clodsire, and Iron Treads, as well as opposing Miraidon and Koraidon locked into Dragon-type moves with Tera Fairy.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Miraidon is a powerful cleaner and revenge killer, forcing out many of the tier's most powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Band Koraidon, Choice Specs Miraidon, and Great Tusk while threatening to sweep late-game after its checks have been removed. Overheat is a nice midground option that lets Miraidon take out Corviknight and Iron Treads while threatening Ground-types without risking being locked into a move that has immunities. U-turn takes advantage of Miraidon's ability to threaten most of the metagame to generate momentum for its teammates. Miraidon's preferred Tera type is Fairy, which allows it to force a 50/50 against opposing Choice Scarf Miraidon and Koraidon. Tera Fairy also removes Miraidon's Ice-weakness, allowing it to survive hits from Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao. Alternatively, Tera Dragon can be used to substantially increase the damage done by Draco Meteor, allowing Miraidon to heavily damage Ting-Lu and more effectively break Clodsire. Tera Electric is a third option, maximizing the power of Electro Drift once opposing Ground-types have been removed. Choice Scarf Miraidon fits well on many balance teams that appreciate the revenge killing that it offers. It pairs especially well with Pokemon that can wear down its Ground-type checks, notably Chien-Pao, Great Tusk, and other Miraidon. Defensively, balance staples like Clodsire, Corviknight, Iron Treads, Ting-Lu, and Toxapex are greatly appreciated, as they can deal with Pokemon like opposing Miraidon, Great Tusk, Koraidon, and Chien-Pao that can potentially come in for free after Miraidon has picked up a KO. Gothitelle is also an especially good partner thanks to its ability to trap and remove many of Miraidon's most effective checks, notably beating Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Blissey, clearing the way for it to sweep late-game. Similarly, Dugtrio is also a decent partner, as it can trap and eliminate opposing Choice Scarf Miraidon and Koraidon that have locked into Dragon Moves and Choice Band Chien-Pao that hasn't locked into Ice Shard while also beating Blissey, Clodsire, and chipped Iron Treads.</p> "

        "name": "Double Dance",
        "description": "<p>Double Dance Miraidon is one of the most potent sweepers and wincons in the AG metagame. It outspeeds the entire metagame after using Agility, and can muscle through defensive Pokemon after a boost or two from Calm Mind. Parabolic Charge greatly improves Miraidon's longevity, and Electric Terrain makes up for its low Base Power, notably letting Miraidon outheal Blissey's Seismic Toss after two Calm Mind boosts. Dazzling Gleam hits Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and opposing Dragon-types for super effective damage. Tera Fairy enables setup on the Ice-, Ground-, and Dragon-type attacks that would otherwise threaten it, boosts the power of Dazzling Gleam, and limits revenge killing attempts from Koraidon, Miraidon, Chien-Pao, and Iron Bundle. The given EV spread allows Miraidon to outspeed Quark Drive-boosted Iron Bundle after an Agility and maximizes Leftovers recovery; the rest is put into Special Attack and Defense. Gothitelle and Dugtrio are phenomenal partners for their ability to trap Clodsire and Iron Treads, removing defensive counterplay to Miraidon. Chien-Pao and Great Tusk are able to bait in physically defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Alomomola for Miraidon to set up on and greatly threaten Clodsire and Iron Treads. With dual screens support from Grimmsnarl, Miraidon is able to set up on more Pokemon, and revenge killing it becomes even more difficult. Toxic Spikes is a major hindrance, so Poison-types like Toxapex and Clodsire, or hazard removal from Iron Treads or Corviknight is greatly appreciated.</p> "
