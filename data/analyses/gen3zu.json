Paired with its above-average Speed tier, it a frightening lead, particularly versus slower leads like Snorunt, Cyndaquil, and Spoink. Sleep Powder's nigh-perfect accuracy allows Butterfree to put switch-ins or opposing leads to sleep, which makes them deadweight for most of the game. Psychic is Butterfree's strongest move, and thanks to the rarity of viable Dark- and Steel-types, it is almost drawback-free. Hidden Power Grass allows Butterfree to OHKO offensive Rhyhorn while also threatening Ground-types such as Cubone and Water-types like Seaking and Staryu. Giga Drain is an option to provide Butterfree a form of recovery that helps complement Morning Sun's low PP, though it also has low PP and is weaker. Morning Sun provides Butterfree with reliable recovery and allows it to keep itself healthy throughout the match. Butterfree can opt to use Stun Spore alongside Sleep Powder in order to neuter faster threats such as Aipom, Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Elekid. If Stun Spore is used over Morning Sun, Butterfree appreciates the limited recovery that Leftovers and Giga Drain provide.</p> <p>Butterfree fits best on offensive and balanced teams that appreciate the free turns that Sleep Powder provides. Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves pair up nicely with Butterfree such as Spoink, Seaking, and Chinchou. Chinchou is worth noting due to its additional resistances to Ice and Electric. Its access to Thunder Wave means Butterfree and Chinchou can also spread status easily. Wallbreakers such as Aipom, Castform, and Elekid all appreciate the opportunity to switch in on sleeping Pokemon. Aipom can act as an offensive pivot for Butterfree, as it threatens Butterfree's checks with Double-Edge and Brick Break. Likewise, Castform is worth mentioning, as it can tank special moves from Butterfree's checks and deal heavy damage in return. Setup sweepers such as Croconaw, Growlithe, Cubone, and Spoink appreciate the setup opportunity that Sleep Powder and Stun Spore provides them. Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhyhorn, Aron, Magnemite, and Nosepass can switch into the STAB moves of faster physical attackers that threaten Butterfree such as Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Aipom.</p> "

Focus Punch is Aipom's strongest coverage option against Rock- and Steel- types, though if locked into Focus Punch, Aipom is extremely exploitable, and non-Choice Band sets still don't OHKO many Rock- and Steel-types. Aipom can run a dedicated SubPunch set to more easily use Focus Punch, but then Aipom cannot use Baton Pass, which it is forbidden to use with Substitute. An Adamant nature could be used for more power, though no longer outspeeding Delibird or tying with threats such as Taillow usually makes this not worth it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types: Rock- and Steel-types such as Nosepass, bulky Magnemite and Aron can easily switch into Double-Edge and force Aipom out. Rhyhorn and Lileep deserve a special mention, as the former is exceptionally dangerous if Aipom lets it get a free Substitute, while the latter has Recover. However, Brick Break still does sizable damage to most Rock- and Steel-types, especially with Choice Band, then OHKOing or 2HKOing all but Lileep and Nosepass. Toxic also cripples the Rock-types meant to check it.</p> <p><strong>Shuppet: Shuppet is immune to Aipom's common attacks bar Shadow Ball, and it can set up a Substitute while forcing it out. However, it must be wary of status and Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Though only Voltorb, Luvdisc, and Elekid naturally outspeed Aipom, they can easily force it out, especially after it has been chipped into their KO ranges. Additionally, setup sweepers such as Bagon and Cyndaquil, and weather sweepers such as Seaking and Sunflora, can outspeed and often even OHKO Aipom under optimal conditions.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: The high amount of recoil from Double-Edge wears Aipom down very quickly, especially when compounded with Spikes and Toxic.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Choice Band Aipom's powerful Double-Edge and blistering fast base 85 Speed make it an excellent lead, mid-game wallbreaker, and cleaner. Brick Break serves as crucial coverage to hit Double-Edge's most common switch-ins, Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhyhorn and Magnemite, super effectively. Shadow Ball targets Shuppet, the only Ghost-type in the tier, but if that isn't a concern, Aipom can run Return instead to reduce the need for taking Double-Edge recoil. Finally, Baton Pass can scout switches, allowing Aipom's team to maintain momentum, something particularly important if Choice Band Aipom is used as a lead.</p> <p>Choice Band Aipom best fits on offense and balance teams looking for a formidable progress-maker. In return, it appreciates physical and special walls such as Koffing, Lileep, and Dustox: they can switch into threats that either outspeed Aipom or exploit its Choice lock to switch in, such as Elekid and Rhyhorn, respectively. Additionally, while it does possess Brick Break to hit Rock- and Steel-types, Choice Band Aipom enjoys support from special wallbreakers such as offensive Chinchou and Growlithe to deal with those threats, as they minimize its need for prediction. Aipom, in return, handles troublesome special walls. Toxic support also works very well against Rock-types, notably hindering Aipom's hardest counter, Lileep. Choice Band Aipom breaking through special walls also makes it a good partner for Elekid, which in turn threatens Pokemon that Speed tie Aipom, such as opposing Aipom, Taillow, and Staryu. Finally, other physical wallbreakers such as Taillow and Pidgeotto work very well with Aipom, as they can weaken each other's checks while offering a backup if the other faints.</p> "

Taunt, Thunder Wave, and Toxic most notably deny Endure setup from opposing leads, with the former also stopping Spikes and recovery from walls, Thunder Wave paralyzing targets to help slower teammates, and Toxic allowing it to outright break past walls. Double-Edge is Aipom's strongest attack, allowing it to OHKO many leads such as Snorunt and Cyndaquil, while Brick Break lets it hit Rock- and Steel-types for significant damage. Baton Pass lets Aipom scout switches and gain momentum, making it extremely hard to pin down and KO due to its high Speed. Silk Scarf allows Aipom to somewhat maintain its role as a wallbreaker if it is not running Toxic, though Leftovers can be used instead to increase its longevity by offsetting some of the recoil from Double-Edge.</p> <p>Lead Utility Aipom best fits on offense and balance teams as a versatile lead, bringing respectable offensive presence and utility later in the game. If it's not running Toxic, physical and special wallbreakers such as Rhyhorn and Chinchou are essential, as they break through walls Aipom struggles to beat, such as Nosepass and Lileep. Even with Toxic, it still appreciates these teammates, as Koffing remains an issue. Walls like Dustox and Koffing can switch into threats that can outdamage Aipom, like the aforementioned walls and also offensive threats such as Elekid and Rhyhorn, threatening to status them or weaken them into KO range of Aipom's attacks. Finally, if Aipom's running Thunder Wave, slow wallbreakers such as Rhyhorn, Cubone, and Croconaw appreciate their targets being made slower, as do walls such as Lileep and Nosepass.</p> "
