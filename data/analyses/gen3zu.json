    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Koffing can opt to use Explosion, as most Rock- and Steel-types are too threatened by Hidden Power Grass and Flamethrower to safely switch in. Fire Blast is an option over Flamethrower to OHKO Naughty Delibird; however, Koffing appreciates the extra PP that Flamethrower provides. Taunt can be used to prevent opposing defensive Pokemon and setup sweepers from taking advantage of Koffing.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Spoink, Staryu, and Growlithe can all threaten Koffing with their STAB attacks. Staryu is worth noting because it can absorb Koffing's Will-O-Wisp with Natural Cure and use Recover to mitigate any damage.</p> <p><strong>Magnemite: Magnemite's immunity to Koffing's STAB moves and base 95 Special Attack allow it to reliably check Koffing forgoing Fire-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Poison-types</strong>: Grimer and Dustox are able to take advantage Koffing's overall passiveness. Dustox's reliable recovery, Psychic-type coverage, and considerable bulk allows it to threaten Koffing. Grimer can use Koffing as setup fodder if it lacks Haze or Taunt.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Levitate in conjunction with stellar bulk allow Koffing to switch into all of Rhyhorn's moves reliably, making Koffing an excellent defensive pivot. Leftovers and Koffing's low base HP enable it to stay healthy by using Pain Split. Sludge Bomb threatens offensive Pokemon such as Aipom, Pidgeotto, and Taillow; it also discourages special attackers such as Elekid and Growlithe from switching in. Hidden Power Grass answers Ground-types such as Rhyhorn and Cubone more effectively. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Aipom, Cubone, and Pidgeotto. Alternatively, Flamethrower prevents Magnemite from taking advantage of Koffing's passiveness.</p> <p>Koffing fits best on balance and defensive teams due to its passive nature. Koffing pairs well with Pokemon that struggle with Rhyhorn such as Aipom, Pidgeotto, and Tailow. Castform checks common Pokemon that Koffing tends to struggle with such as Staryu, Elekid, and Dustox. Pokemon that appreciate a Ground-type immunity such as Chinchou, Elekid, and Magnemite all pair well with Koffing. Koffing struggles against special attackers such as Elekid, Staryu, and Growlithe so specially defensive pokemon such as Delcatty, Dustox, and Sunflora are integral in providing support. Delcatty is worth noting, as it can Wish pass to help remedy Koffing's lack of reliable recovery. Koffing struggles with other bulky Poison-types like Grimer and Dustox, so physical attackers like Rhyhorn, Aipom, and Cubone pair well with it.</p> "

This means Koffing can choose to play a more supportive role alongside its potency as a physical wall. Memento allows Koffing to safely bring in setup sweepers and wallbreakers against a foe. Alternatively, Koffing can choose to use Destiny Bond, which can force out faster threats that may not OHKO it. Destiny Bond can also force trades with threats like Aipom and Elekid. Koffing can opt to use Toxic in order to threaten defensive Pokemon such as Lileep. Haze can be used to shut down opposing setup sweepers that may abuse Koffings passiveness, such as Growlithe and Spoink.</p> <p>Rain and sun sweepers such as Seaking, Horsea, and Sunflora all appreciate Memento support to set up their respective weather. Setup sweepers such as Croconaw, Growlithe, and Spoink all appreciate the setup opportunity that Memento provides. Pokemon that struggle with physical attackers, such as Castform, Delcatty, and Sunflora, all appreciate Koffing's physical bulk.
