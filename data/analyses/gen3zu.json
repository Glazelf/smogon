Paired with its above-average Speed tier, it a frightening lead, particularly versus slower leads like Snorunt, Cyndaquil, and Spoink. Sleep Powder's nigh-perfect accuracy allows Butterfree to put switch-ins or opposing leads to sleep, which makes them deadweight for most of the game. Psychic is Butterfree's strongest move, and thanks to the rarity of viable Dark- and Steel-types, it is almost drawback-free. Hidden Power Grass allows Butterfree to OHKO offensive Rhyhorn while also threatening Ground-types such as Cubone and Water-types like Seaking and Staryu. Giga Drain is an option to provide Butterfree a form of recovery that helps complement Morning Sun's low PP, though it also has low PP and is weaker. Morning Sun provides Butterfree with reliable recovery and allows it to keep itself healthy throughout the match. Butterfree can opt to use Stun Spore alongside Sleep Powder in order to neuter faster threats such as Aipom, Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Elekid. If Stun Spore is used over Morning Sun, Butterfree appreciates the limited recovery that Leftovers and Giga Drain provide.</p> <p>Butterfree fits best on offensive and balanced teams that appreciate the free turns that Sleep Powder provides. Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves pair up nicely with Butterfree such as Spoink, Seaking, and Chinchou. Chinchou is worth noting due to its additional resistances to Ice and Electric. Its access to Thunder Wave means Butterfree and Chinchou can also spread status easily. Wallbreakers such as Aipom, Castform, and Elekid all appreciate the opportunity to switch in on sleeping Pokemon. Aipom can act as an offensive pivot for Butterfree, as it threatens Butterfree's checks with Double-Edge and Brick Break. Likewise, Castform is worth mentioning, as it can tank special moves from Butterfree's checks and deal heavy damage in return. Setup sweepers such as Croconaw, Growlithe, Cubone, and Spoink appreciate the setup opportunity that Sleep Powder and Stun Spore provides them. Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhyhorn, Aron, Magnemite, and Nosepass can switch into the STAB moves of faster physical attackers that threaten Butterfree such as Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Aipom.</p> "

Pidgeotto faces competition from another Normal / Flying type, Taillow, who has a better Speed and a useful ability in Guts. However, Pidgeotto has better attack and bulk. It avoids OHKOs from walls such as Dustox and Delcatty after Double-Edge recoil, as well as outright OHKOs from powerful attacks: Double-Edge from non-Choice Band Aipom and Castform, for example, and Aerial Ace from Choice Band Delibird. Return can be used over Double-Edge to help Pidgeotto stay healthy, but it will be harder to get targets into KO range.

Hidden Power Fighting can threaten Pokemon that don't mind Pidgeotto's STAB combination such as Rhyhorn, bulky Magnemite, and specially defensive Lileep. Steel Wing can be used to ease prediction versus Shuppet, or if you are using Hidden Power Flying over Aerial Ace for the power.
