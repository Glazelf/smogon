        "description": "<p>Nidoking is a powerful wallbreaker that is able to take advantage of its wide movepool and access to Sheer Force. With a god's Special Attack, it is able to break through common special walls like Heatran, Necrozma-DM, and Tapu Fini. Life Orb enhances Nidoking's damage output even further without drawback. Sludge Wave is its most powerful attack against neutral targets while also dealing super effective damage to common specially defensive Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Clefable. Earth Power hits Heatran and Necrozma-DM for heavy damage, although specially defensive variants of Necrozma-DM are not OHKOed and can deal significant damage back. Ice Beam can be used to OHKO Landorus-T and is Nidoking's best option to hit Giratina, while Fire Blast OHKOes Ferrothorn and deals heavy damage or OHKOes Corviknight. Flamethrower can be used to ensure you are not PP stalled by Corviknight. Thunderbolt hits Ho-Oh, Kyogre, and Slowking for super effective damage, although Substitute can be used to ease predictions. Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature make sure Nidoking can outspeed non-max speed Rotom-W and Ho-Oh, although a Modest nature can be used to increase damage output even further while still outpacing Necrozma-DM without a boosting nature.</p> <p>Nidoking needs a god with high Special Attack, like Mewtwo, Pheromosa, or Rayquaza, in order to function properly. Its ability to open up holes in the opposing team's defensive core makes it a great partner for fast cleaners like Kartana and Tapu Koko. Nidoking has trouble breaking through Gastrodon, Lunala, and Ho-Oh if not carrying Thunderbolt. Kartana can help improve these matchups with its ability to threaten Gastrodon and Lunala and by removing Ho-Oh's Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off. When using Substitute, Nidoking has to sacrifice coverage and oftentimes the ability to beat certain Pokemon, so teammates that can help with this lack of coverage are appreciated. Due to its relatively low bulk and lack of recovery, sturdy defensive partners like Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W are appreciated. All three of these offer pivoting support, allowing Nidoking to enter the field safely. Entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Heatran also make good teammates, accumulating chip damage on potential checks.</p> "

Transformation copies donated stats, allowing Ditto to still outspeed Speed receivers and hit as hard as Attack receivers. Imposter's also useful against stall teams by effectively giving infinite PP and copying recovery moves. Ditto prefers having its Choice Scarf removed against stall teams to switch moves and maximize its PP stall capabilities. 252 HP EVs boost the only stat Ditto retains after Imposter activates, while 252 Special Attack EVs and a Quiet nature boost its Future Sight after transforming into a Pokemon like Slowking.</p> <p>Ditto almost exclusively finds its place on stall teams to handle offensive setup threats that its teammates struggle to handle. It struggles to switch in directly against most foes, so slow pivot moves make for great support. Examples include Teleport from Slowbro or Slowking and U-turn from Corviknight. Entry hazards prevent Ditto from switching in repeatedly, so teammates that can reliably remove them such as Mandibuzz and Ho-Oh are appreciated. Unaware users like Pyukumuku, Quagsire, and Clefable or Clear Smog users like Gastrodon and Amoonguss can handle bulky setup Pokemon with recovery, such as Calm Mind Galarian Slowking and Bulk Up Buzzwole, which outlast Ditto one-on-one. An ally with Regenerator, such as the aforementioned Slowbro or Ho-Oh, in tandem with Ditto can outstall defensive Regenerator Pokemon, effectively forcing them out. A defensive god with a high HP stat like Giratina theoretically complements Ditto well, but Ditto is able to go in any teamslot, especially the Attack and Special Attack slots, which stall teams don't benefit from much anyway. While the HP increase is beneficial, another bulky Pokemon can often take better advantage of it, usually Skarmory.</p> "

Skarmory can also set Stealth Rock, but the limited distribution of Spikes makes Skarmory's access to that move more valuable. Taunt is an option to prevent setup and Defog, but Skarmory's low Speed makes it an unreliable option. Skarmory can also forgo Body Press or Brave Bird to run four utility moves, but this makes it exceedingly passive. Skarmory can also run a specially defensive set, but this set is generally outclassed by Corviknight.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire- and Electric-types: Even physical Fire- and Electric-types like Victini, Zeraora, and Dracozolt can reliably 2HKO Skarmory with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Skarmory is vulnerable to Taunt, as it cannot recover, phaze, or set Spikes in front of Taunt users like Yveltal and Alolan Persian.</p> <p><strong>Pivots: Physical pivots like Landorus-T can draw Skarmory in and pivot to a special attacker that forces it out.

        "description": "<p>Skarmory is the most reliable Spiker in the metagame and one of the sturdiest physical walls. With its amazing defensive typing, access to reliable recovery, and sky-high Defense, it is the perfect candidate for the HP teamslot. Skarmory is able to comfortably wall most physical threats, including Dhelmise, Bisharp, Excadrill, and Weavile. Body Press works off of its high Defense stat and threatens many of the Pokemon it walls, like Excadrill, but Brave Bird is an option for better neutral coverage and the ability to hit Ghost-types, especially Dhelmise, at the cost of taking recoil. Spikes punishes switch-ins and takes advantage of the free turns Skarmory generates. Iron Defense allows Skarmory to check setup sweepers as well, boosting alongside them while also powering up Body Press; Whirlwind is another option in the last moveslot to phaze set-up foes that Skarmory cannot KO. Rocky Helmet lets Skarmory punish physical attackers even more heavily, especially pivots that can otherwise wear down Skarmory, while Leftovers provides extra recovery. Maximum Defense investment is required to check the high-powered attackers common in Godly Gift and has the nice side effect of also powering up Body Press.</p> <p>Skarmory is a good option for stall and balance teams looking for a catch-all physical wall. Since most Uber Pokemon have a high base HP, Skarmory can work with a wide range of Gods, but some of the best fits are Giratina, Yveltal, and Kyurem-W. Wallbreakers like Victini and Zeraora appreciate Skarmory's Spikes, which help wear down their checks, and its ability to switch into would-be revenge killers that force them out, such as Landorus-T. Since Skarmory's Special Defense is poor, it appreciates bulky teammates like RegenVest Tangrowth and Gastrodon to sponge special hits aimed at it. Due to its Electric and Fire weaknesses, Skarmory is unable to wall Victini, Zeraora, and Dracozolt; reliable switch-ins to these foes like Hippowdown and Quagsire make good partners, especially since Skarmory covers their Grass weaknesses.</p> "

Entry hazards, like Ferrothorn's Spikes and Heatran's Stealth Rock, compound damage throughout the game, putting Pokemon like Buzzwole and Slowking in Garchomp's KO range late-game. Magnezone can trap and eliminate Corviknight and Skarmory, making it a great partner. Special attackers that invite Heatran and Galarian Slowking in, especially those with a pivot move like Tapu Koko or Tornadus-T, are also great options. Pokemon such as Weavile and Kartana work with Garchomp to overwhelm shared checks, allowing one to sweep. The latter can also break past physically defensive Unaware walls like Clefable and Quagsire, which Garchomp can't get past. Dual screens support from the likes of Alolan Ninetales and Grimmsnarl helps Garchomp set up safely and remedies its Defense drop from Scale Shot. Scale Shot's inconsistency can make bulky Flying-type Pokemon, namely Ho-Oh and Landorus-T, troublesome, making teammates that can take advantage of them like Urshifu-R and Cloyster valuable. Psychic Surge from Tapu Lele can prevent priority attacks like Weavile's Ice Shard from exploiting Scale Shot's Defense drop.</p> "
