        "description": "<p>RegenVest Toxapex is a staple on balance and bulky offense teams, using its excellent stats and support movepool to act as an excellent pivot that provides much role compression. Flip Turn, in combination with 0 Speed IVs and a Sassy nature, allows Toxapex to switch into threats like Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Iron Moth, and Volcarona and then switch out into a teammate, whereas Mortal Spin allows it to act as a fantastic entry hazard remover. Clear Smog removes boosts from threats like the aforementioned Volcarona, Nasty Plot Darkrai, and Swords Dance Iron Valiant, while Scald dissuades most physical attackers from switching into it looking to take advantage of its lower physical defense. The given EV spread allows Toxapex to survive two uses of Astral Barrage from Choice Specs Gengar and then pivot out, with the remaining 68 EVs dumped into Defense. Although Toxapex is a wonderful special wall, certain threats like Latios, Raging Bolt, and Thundurus-T take advantage of it; hence, a secondary wall like Tyranitar is strongly recommended. Toxapex notably allows Subsitute users like Urshifu-R and Volcarona to take advantage of its passivity and inability to threaten them behind a Substitute to use it as setup fodder, so offensive teammates that can pressure these Substitute users like Ogerpon-W and Salamence are greatly appreciated. Toxapex's defensive utility and pivoting capabilities are appreciated by wallbreakers and pivots like Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Urshifu-R, and Latios, as it's able to switch in, sponge a hit, and pivot out. Toxapex is also appreciated by physical walls like Skarmory and Gliscor, with these walls being able to switch into physical threats like Ogerpon-W and Iron Boulder, while Toxapex switches into the special threats they are afraid of like Heatran and Greninja.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Due to its access to Prankster, dual screens, Parting Shot, and Taunt, Grimmsnarl distinguishes itself as the most reliable dual screens setter on hyper offense teams. Dual screens support gives setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scizor, and Iron Valiant an easier time setting up and makes revenge killing them significantly harder. Parting Shot gives Grimmsnarl a way to pivot the aforementioned Pokemon in. Grimmsnarl can also use Memento, which further drops the stats of foes, although it doesn't allow Grimmsnarl to set up screens afterwards. Taunt stops would-be setup sweepers like Swords Dance Iron Hands and blocks opposing Pokemon like Glimmora from setting up entry hazards. Alternatively, Thunder Wave cripples faster offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant, whereas Ceaseless Edge sets up Spikes while not being too passive. Tera Ghost allows Grimmsnarl to block Rapid Spin attempts from Pokemon such as Iron Treads and Great Tusk, although it is inadvisable to waste Tera on Grimmsnarl, as your setup sweepers may require it.</p>"
