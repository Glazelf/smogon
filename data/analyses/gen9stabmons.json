        "description": "<p>Azumarill is a premier Belly Drum sweeper armed with Huge Power, a strong priority move in Jet Punch, which can be pushed to its maximum power with Tera, and wall breaking capabilities with Surging Strikes. Azumarill's Water / Fairy typing frequently gives it safe opportunities to setup Belly Drum against Dragon- and Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Weavile. Hyper Drill is a neutral coverage move that can hit Toxapex for massive damage and doesn't trigger Baneful Bunker. Other physical attackers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon appreciate Azumarill's ability to break through physically defensive walls such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk. Azumarill is prone to chip damage from Garchomp or Rocky Helmet Toxapex, so having an attacker that can deal with both like Iron-Valiant is advised. Azumarill also can have a tough time getting in and setting up a Belly Drum, so pairing it with screens support via Grimmsnarl, Shed Tail from Cyclizar, or pivots such as Corviknight is recommended.</p> "

Tyranitar also has the option of running Parting Shot to pivot on its would be switch-ins. Knock Off removes items like Covert Cloak from Pokemon like Toxapex and Gholdengo, which would otherwise block Salt Cure.

Threats to Tyranitar include Annihilape, Iron Valiant, Palafin, Gholdengo, and Great Tusk. Tera Water checks Palafin and Gholdengo, while Tera Flying and Fairy check Great Tusk and Iron Valiant. Heavy-Duty Boots avoids entry hazard damage, which can be useful with Tera Flying, while Leftovers increases Tyranitarâ€™s longevity. Tyranitar prefers bulky teammates like Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Rotom-C to patch up its Ground weakness. Physically defensive Toxapex is appreciated to handle the likes of Palafin and Iron Valiant and covers for Tyranitar's Fighting, Water, and Fairy weaknesses while also providing entry removal with Mortal Spin. Offensive Gholdengo is a good teammate, as it blocks entry hazard removal while also being able to throw off powerful attacks and spread status with Infernal Parade and Thunder Wave. Powerful offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Palafin can more easily break holes with the chip damage provided by Tyranitar.</p> "

While Scald offers more PP and reliability, Steam Eruption OHKOes Great Tusk after Stealth Rock and improves Rotom-W's overall offensive presence. Will-O-Wisp hinders physical attackers more reliably than Scald. Alternatively, Apple Acid breaks down defensive Pokemon such as Garganacl, while Haze neutralizes slow setup sweepers such as Scizor and Freeze-Dry hits Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp super effectively. Roost provides consistent recovery, while Strength Sap makes Rotom-W more effective against physical attackers such as Great Tusk and Chien-Pao, but leaves it unable to recover against Gholdengo. The given Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed Jolly Azumarill and uninvested Great Tusk, but more Speed can be run to handle certain threats; 224 Speed outspeeds Palafin, while 240 Speed with a Timid nature outpaces Gholdengo. Tera Steel allows Rotom-W to more easily pivot into Toxapex and take on Dragon-types such as Garchomp. Alternatively, Tera Electric strengthens Volt Switch and makes Rotom-W less vulnerable to Salt Cure. Rotom-W appreciates partners that can pivot such as Ting-Lu, Slither Wing, and Corviknight. Physical walls like Garganacl and Skeledirge after Terastallizing can take on many of the physical attackers that Rotom-W cannot handle, such as Roaring Moon. Powerful offensive Pokemon such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Treads appreciate Rotom-W's ability to pivot them into battle.</p> "

Dual screens support gives setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scizor, Iron Valiant, and Belly Drum Azumarill an easier time setting up and makes revenge killing them significantly harder. Parting Shot gives Grimmsnarl a way to pivot the aforementioned Pokemon in. Grimmsnarl can also use Memento, which further drops the stats of foes, although it doesn't allow Grimmsnarl to set up screens afterwards. Taunt stops would-be setup sweepers like Swords Dance Iron Hands and blocks opposing Pokemon like Glimmora from setting up entry hazards. Alternatively, Thunder Wave cripples faster offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant, whereas Ceaseless Edge sets up Spikes while not being too passive. Tera Ghost allows Grimmsnarl to block Rapid Spin attempts from Pokemon such as Iron Treads and Great Tusk, although it is inadvisable to waste Tera on Grimmsnarl, as your setup sweepers may require it. Azumarill deserves a special mention as a Grimmsnarl partner, as its Water typing and access to moves like Jet Punch and Tidy Up make it a good Ting-Lu and Tyranitar answer, which would otherwise use Grimmsnarl as setup bait for Stealth Rock and Spikes due to being immune to Taunt.</p> "

In addition, thanks to its ability, its well-distributed stats, and Shore Up, it is able to check many attackers such as Iron Moth, Ceruledge, and Garganacl. Spikes should be used if reliability and lack of PP are a concern, especially on stall teams. Precipice Blades maximizes damage against Toxapex and other Ground-weak Pokemon like Iron Hands; however, Earthquake is a fine option if accuracy is a concern. There are multiple options for the last moveslot: Parting Shot lets Ting-Lu safely bring in offensive teammates via a slow pivot, Foul Play gives it a better matchup against setup sweepers like Salamence, Whirlwind phazes setup sweepers that Ting-Lu can't handle like non-Taunt Annihilape, and Knock Off can remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots from pivots like Tyranitar. Covert Cloak prevents Ting-Lu from being poisoned from Mortal Spin users like Toxapex, while Leftovers gives to it more passive recovery. Both Tera Ghost and Tera Poison allow Ting-Lu to surprise Fighting-types like Iron Hands; Tera Poison grants it an immunity to Toxic and lets it resist Grass-type attacks, while Tera Ghost allows it to spinblock. Alternatively, Tera Fairy and Tera Water provide great resistances to Roaring Moon and Palafin, respectively. Ting-Lu fits in a variety of teams, ranging from bulky offense to stall. Offensive teammates such as Iron Valiant, Palafin, and Iron Hands appreciate that Ting-Lu can both set Spikes and act as a slow pivot with Parting Shot. These three Pokemon also beat Great Tusk, one of Ting-Lu's biggest checks, as it is able to beat it with Fighting-type moves and remove its entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Dondozo are able to check Pokemon that Ting-Lu can't, which include Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Mimikyu. Ting-Lu struggles to make progress with entry hazards up, so entry hazard removal from the likes of Great Tusk, Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Corviknight is recommended.</p> "
