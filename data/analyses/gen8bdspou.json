Between its good STAB combination, wide variety of coverage moves, and the large number of Pokemon threatened by its strong attacks, such as Heatran and Clefable, it naturally performs well against balance and stall teams. However, Nidoking can struggle against more offensive teams thanks to its underwhelming Speed tier and weakness to common offensive typings like Water, Ground and Psychic. Furthermore, even in good matchups it can feel a bit prediction reliant, as the opponent can pivot around its moves into a faster threat.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Ice Beam mainly hits Gliscor and Garchomp, but it is generally a good middle ground-option to hit Dragon- and Ground-types in general, such as Dragonite, Donphan, Latios and Latias. Flamethrower is used to OHKO Scizor and Skarmory, as well as ease prediction against Steel-types. A Timid nature allows Nidoking to outspeed Timid Heatran, Jolly Feraligatr and Adamant Lucario, but the power boost Modest provides can be appealing to some teams.</p> <p>Nidoking mainly fits on balance and bulky offense, as it is a useful tool for dismantling bulkier teams. Due to its poor defensive profile, Nidoking can struggle to get onto the field; therefore, it appreciates pivoting support from teammates such as Rotom-W and Scizor. The former can even switch into Water types that might give Nidoking trouble, while the latter can do the same for Psychic types. It also pairs well with more offensive pivots, like Choice Band Infernape, who can pressure Blissey, the best answer to Nidoking. Entry Hazards can amplify Nidoking's wallbreaking potential, and as such, setters like Heatran and Skarmory are great partners. Dragon-types like Dragonite and Latios enjoy the pressure Nidoking puts on Clefable and Steel-types.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nidoking can run Focus Punch over Flamethrower to lure in and heavily damage Blissey, leaving it unable to answer it anymore. However, the lack of any use beyond this specific matchup makes the reliability of Flamethrower more valuable for most teams. Toxic Spikes can help wear down some of its checks like the afromentioned Blissey, as well as Slowking, while supporting its teammates. However, this can limit Nidoking's wallbreaking capabilities. A Focus Sash set with Stealth Rock is another option, as Nidoking beats Gliscor, one of the best defoggers in the tier, and can get something done even in unfavorable matchups. However, dropping Life Orb leaves Nidoking unable to net some important KOs, such as against Scizor and Rotom-W. Nidoking can also run Thunderbolt as another useful coverage option to hit bulky Water types that might otherwise give it trouble, like Milotic and Slowking, but those targets aren't common enough to warrant the move's usage most of the time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Due to its average speed and middling bulk, a lot of fast Pok√©mon can easily revenge kill Nidoking, such as Latios, Garchomp, Weavile, and Starmie. Crawdaunt and Azumarill can OHKO it with Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Blissey: Blissey is by far the best answer to Nidoking, easily tanking all its moves aside from the rare Focus Punch while sporting reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled. While it can be overwhelmed through team support, it is often a hard stop to anything Nidoking does.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Some Water-types, like Slowking or Milotic, can switch into most of Nidoking's attacks and threaten it back with their Water STAB moves. Choice Scarf Rotom-W can switch into anything but Sludge Wave, outspeed it and threaten it with Hydro Pump.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Alakazam is a premier wallbreaker in BDSP OU, tearing holes through slower teams lacking a hard counter. Alakazam's high Speed tier lets it outspeed other prominent threats such as Infernape and Starmie, forcing them out with its superb coverage. Furthermore, Magic Guard gives Alakazam a myriad of benefits, such as preventing it from being worn down by entry hazards, preserving its Focus Sash, and mitigating Life Orb recoil. Furthermore, counterplay to Alakazam differs depending on what item it is running; using a Life Orb denies nearly all defensive counterplay options through its sheer power, while running a Focus Sash prevents Alakazam from being instantly revenge killed, which is often enough for it to break apart more offensive teams. However, Alakazam is not without its flaws, as its physical bulk is extremely poor, causing it to be revenge killed easily and limiting its setup opportunities. Moreover, its reliance on Focus Blast to deal with Dark- and Steel-types means just one miss can ruin it. Additionally, while Alakazam has a strong offensive presence, it rarely ever threatens to OHKO foes without a boost, meaning if Focus Sash has been broken or it is known to be using a Life Orb, multiple Pokemon can just tank a hit from it and OHKO it back.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Recover gives Alakazam the chance to heal off weak hits and use passive Pokemon like non-Calm Mind and non-Thunder Wave Blissey as complete setup fodder while restoring its Focus Sash should it get chipped. However, Alakazam's pitiful bulk makes this option rarely relevant in practice. Dazzling Gleam gives Alakazam a consistent option to hit Dark-types without Focus Blast's chance to miss; however, it is much weaker and leaves Alakazam helpless against some Steel-types. If Shadow Ball is replaced, Alakazam becomes unable to break Jirachi and opposing Alakazam, making Dazzling Gleam a much worse option regardless of what move is dropped. Encore can lock Pokemon into a non-damaging move, giving Alakazam or its teammates free setup turns; however, it is inconsistent and can very rarely be used. Taunt is usable on hyper offense teams to prevent entry hazards or dual screens from going up from slower leads like Azelf and Skarmory while preventing the likes of Scizor and Skarmory from recovering. It can also deny Defog from Scizor and Gliscor, helping teammates like Lucario and Feraligatr sweep more easily.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Scizor walls Focus Sash variants of Alakazam, while Life Orb variants require getting a sequence correct and landing multiple Focus Blasts, making Scizor as close to a counter as you can get. Heatran can switch into Alakazam's Psychic-type STAB moves and Shadow Ball a few times and force it out; however, it can lose if Alakazam uses Nasty Plot or Focus Blast as it switches in. Similarly, Jirachi can switch into Alakazam's Psychic-type STAB move and Focus Blast; however it loses if Alakazam sets up with Nasty Plot or hits it with Shadow Ball on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killing: Faster Pokemon like Weavile and Choice Scarf Garchomp can revenge kill Alakazam, although they are unable to safely switch into it directly. Beat Up and Dual Chop, respectively, bypass Alakazam's Focus Sash if it has one, making them much more consistent at checking it. Priority such as Dragonite and Lucario's Extreme Speed and Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet easily remove Alakazam due to its poor physical bulk; however, they are unable to switch into it. To add onto that, Focus Sash variants of Alakazam can live one hit from full HP and potentially KO these Pokemon back. As such, this requires Alakazam to either be chipped or scouted first in order to consistently revenge kill it.</p> ",

        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<p>Psychic is Alakazam's STAB move of choice due to its higher Base Power; however, Psyshock allows Alakazam to break through special walls such as Gastrodon and Blissey much more easily, especially with a Life Orb. Focus Blast lets Alakazam nail the Steel- and Dark-types that would otherwise wall it such as Tyranitar, Scizor, and Heatran. Shadow Ball deals with opposing Psychic-types such as opposing Alakazam, and Jirachi, which can switch into Focus Blast and Alakazam's Psychic-type STAB move. Magic Guard benefits Alakazam no matter which item it is running; if running Life Orb, Magic Guard prevents its recoil; if running Focus Sash, Magic Guard preserves it in the face of entry hazards. Life Orb can be used to wallbreak much more effectively, notably allowing Alakazam to 2HKO Scizor with Focus Blast after Stealth Rock chip. Focus Sash in turn provides a one-time safety net for Alakazam to setup for free or revenge kill something safely.</p> <p>Alakazam fits best on offense and bulky offense teams, as both archetypes are fast-paced enough to take advantage of Alakazam punching holes in opposing walls while still maintaining the ability to safely bring it in multiple times. Due to Alakazam's frailty, it greatly appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon such as Gliscor, Rotom-W, and Scizor to bring it in safely. Stealth Rock support from the aforementioned Gliscor, Heatran, and Garchomp are extremely useful, as they allow Alakazam to break through its checks more easily. Azelf is a solid partner, as it can form an exceptionally potent Psychic Spam core, weakening their shared checks. The likes of Weavile, Nidoking, and Nasty Plot Rotom-W work well with Alakazam to wallbreak for each other. A strong defensive core is also appreciated alongside Alakazam, as it invites in powerful revenge killers like Weavile. Focus Sash Alakazam works exceptionally well on hyper offense teams with partners such as Feraligatr, Azumarill, and Lucario, as it provides a one-time countermeasure to opposing sweepers and can clean weakened teams due to its high Speed tier, all while Focus Sash prevents it from being revenge killed by priority. Clefable also can assist Scizor in checking the likes of Garchomp and Weavile on balance teams, as Scizor can get easily overwhelmed.</p> "

Azumarill is generally a strong option for hyper offense and standard offense teams, since Aqua Jet is handy in the priority-heavy BDSP OU metagame, and it switches into offensive foes such as Feraligatr, Weavile, and Infernape to quickly wreak havoc. However, it needs support to stay healthy %mdash;especially if using Belly Drum‚Äî and to handle certain threats. Its low Speed leaves it vulnerable defensively despite its decent bulk and Aqua Jet, and it needs help to pressure the common Breloom and Rotom-Wash, which massively threaten it in return. Azumarill's main set, Belly Drum + Sitrus Berry, also struggles to beat Unaware Clefable, a common defensive glue Pokemon that it can't 2HKO. Still, Azumarill usually only needs one window of opportunity to either sweep or put a dent in the opposition.</p> ",

This spread improves its bulk while still outspeeding defensive Skarmory. Facade is a niche alternative to Superpower for Choice Band Azumarill that allows it to still be functional if it is burned.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Defensive Tangrowth can switch into Choice Band Azumarill, but it has to scout Azumarill's set, since Belly Drum lets Play Rough OHKO it. Breloom falls to Play Rough but resists Aqua Jet and outspeeds Azumarill, letting it revenge kill Azumarill with Seed Bomb or Bullet Seed. It can also use Spore and then set up. Shaymin forces Azumarill out with Seed Flare and can stomach +6 Aqua Jet; however, it cannot switch into Choice Band Play Rough unless it has Defense investment.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-W: Rotom-W can cripple Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp, resists Aqua Jet, and easily threatens massive damage with Volt Switch or Thunderbolt. While Rotom-W doesn't like to take a Play Rough on the switch, Azumarill can only outspeed even uninvested Rotom-W with a suboptimal Jolly nature.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Quagsire with Unaware can avoid 2HKOs from Belly Drum Azumarill and stall it out with Toxic barring Waterfall flinches, but it does struggle against the Choice Band set, which cleanly 2HKOes it. Empoleon can phaze Belly Drum Azumarill one time, but it fares much better against the Choice Band set, as it can take all its attacks besides Superpower. Milotic naturally outspeeds Azumarill and wipes out its Belly Drum boost with Haze. Milotic struggles against the Choice Band set, though, since Play Rough 2HKOes unless Marvel Scale is active. Azumarill, regardless of the set, fears a Scald burn when facing bulky Water-types in general.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Most offensive threats can damage Belly Drum Azumarill enough that it either can't set up or enters KO range for most priority moves. Azumarill's most notable revenge killers are Latias, and Starmie, which can safely take a +6 Aqua Jet, even with chip damage, and OHKO Azumarill. Focus Sash Alakazam can also check Azumarill in a pinch, being able to deal with the Choice Band set with two Psychic hits, provided Azumarill isn't locked into Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Faster Priority: Lucario, Dragonite, and offensive Scizor can pick off weakened Azumarill with priority before it can use Aqua Jet.

        "description": "<p>This set is designed for Azumarill to clean up late-game or heavily cripple the opposition. Once set-up Aqua Jet is its go-to move for most situations thanks to its priority. Sitrus Berry helps Azumarill beat priority revenge killers and take a hit while setting up. Mystic Water is an alternative to strengthen Aqua Jet and give a small chance to 2HKO Unaware Clefable with Waterfall. Azumarill can set up against a Latias Choiced locked into Draco Meteor or Surf, or on a Garchomp locked into Outrage. After setting up, Azumarill does need to worry about phazers like full-health Skarmory and maximally physically defensive Empoleon, but it can blow past chipped Skarmory and other Empoleon sets.</p> <p>Azumarill works best on hyper offense teams, where it can immediately threaten a sweep after a turn of setup. This set does get checked by Unaware Clefable, which is a common blanket check for the numerous setup sweepers in the tier, so a teammate like Lucario that can deal with it is great. Azumarill will need teammates that can handle Shaymin and Breloom, since both can take an Aqua Jet at +6 and threaten it with an OHKO. The most important tip with using this set is to, before sweeping, use teammates to wear down or take out Pokemon that avoid the OHKO from +6 Aqua Jet. For example, Choice Scarf users such as Infernape can wear down Starmie, and Latias with U-Turn. Scizor's U-Turn threatens to OHKO those threats and can get Azumarill into the game safely without losing momentum. Alakazam and Weavile both threaten Starmie, and Latias with their superior Speed. Garchomp is another great teammate for Azumarill to provide Stealth Rock and also deal with Magnezone, which outspeeds Azumarill and threatens it before Belly Drum. Azelf, and suicide lead Skarmory support Azumarill and its hyper offense teammates with dual screens and entry hazards. Focus Sash Alakazam, Breloom, and Dragonite are notable late-game cleaners that appreciate Azumarill's wallbreaking ability, which makes their roles easier.</p> "

Scizor is also vulnerable to the common Magnezone, which can trap and easily deal heavy damage to it. Scizor has a quadruple weakness to Fire, allowing Pokemon such as Garchomp, Clefable, and Togekiss to run Fire-type coverage, bait in Scizor, and OHKO it.

Blissey requires strong physical walls to check the variety of Pokemon that threaten it. Unaware Clefable is a good check to setup sweepers like Azumarill, Feraligatr, and Dragonite, and Gliscor, Slowbro, and Skarmory are effective against Lucario. Tangrowth checks Breloom, in particular, and offers a backup answer to Lucario. Tangrowth and defensive Shaymin help against Water-type wallbreakers Crawdaunt, Feraligatr, and Azumarill. Skarmory is a particularly effective partner, checking Weavile, Mamoswine, Lucario, and Feraligatr, while offering the entry hazard support missing from Calm Mind Blissey. For Choice Band wallbreakers like Infernape, Mamoswine, and Azumarill, Slowbro is an effective check, though it needs a partner that resists Fairy-type attacks like Skarmory to consistently check Azumarill. Gliscor again makes a good partner, offering Defog support and checking Lucario and Infernape, though most variants will get 2HKOed by Choice Band Flare Blitz. Another option would be Poliwrath, which is one of the few true counters to the stallbreaking menace Crawdaunt and a check to Feraligatr. Specially defensive Scizor fills the necessary role of Alakazam switch-in and appreciates not having to endure other special assaults. Other essential support includes an entry hazard remover like Gliscor or Starmie, a Ground-type to keep Volt Switch users from freely gaining momentum, and a Heatran switch-in like like Slowbro or Gliscor. Heatran should be scouted first, however.</p> "

Surf is Latios's best coverage option, dissuading Heatran from switching in on its STAB attacks and breaking through Scizor after minor chip damage. Dragon Pulse lacking Draco Meteor's drawbacks makes it useful against frailer targets that do not require Draco Meteor's sheer power to break through, and locking into a Dragon-type move is oftentimes much more favorable than Psychic. Sleep Talk, on the other hand, allows Latios to switch into Breloom's Spore and force it out, letting Latios check it in the short term.</p> <p>Choice Specs Latios fits on offensive teams that don't mind its decreased longevity and greatly appreciate its wallbreaking.

However, Lucario relies heavily on Stealth Rock and Spikes support to bring foes like Latios, Infernape, and Skarmory into range of its boosted attacks. Furthermore, Lucario's frailty, compounded with Life Orb recoil, puts it on a timer when it tries to sweep, especially if it has to eat a hit in order to set up.

Meteor Mash separates Lucario from other setup sweepers, as it is uniquely capable of hitting Unaware Clefable super effectively. Meteor Mash is also incredibly useful for picking off weakened Gliscor while potentially giving Lucario the boost it needs to sweep. After a Swords Dance boost, Extreme Speed easily OHKOes faster Pokemon that would normally force Lucario out, notably OHKOing Infernape and Latios after Stealth Rock. An Adamant nature is near-required to OHKO Latios with Extreme Speed at +2 after Stealth Rock; however, a Jolly nature can be used if outspeeding Timid Rotom-W is necessary. Justified lets Lucario come in on a predicted Knock Off from Tangrowth or Throat Chop from Weavile to get an Attack boost, which all but ensures its sweep.</p> <p>Lucario fits best on hyper offense teams that can break holes for it to potentially sweep late-game. Lead Skarmory is an excellent partner, as Lucario needs Stealth Rock on the field to guarantee an OHKO on Latios, Infernape, and Starmie with +2 Extreme Speed. The Spikes Skarmory provides is also beneficial, chipping Pokemon like Garchomp and Tangrowth into range of its boosted attacks. Lucario should be paired with wallbreakers that can soften up the enemy team for it to an eventually sweep like Breloom, Dragonite, Feraligatr, and Alakazam. Breloom is particularly good, as it can give Lucario a free setup opportunity with Spore, while Alakazam notably forces Latios out. Azelf is an interesting teammate option that can keep opposing entry hazards off the field with its fast Taunt and weaken foes like Gliscor and Latios with Psychic and U-turn, respectively. Azelf can also run a lead set to support Lucario, setting up either Stealth Rock or dual screens, both of which ease Lucario's sweeping attempts. Water-types like Feraligatr, Cloyster, and Azumarill can set up on and force out Gliscor, which is the most common switch-in to Lucario. Lucario greatly appreciates speed control in the form of Sticky Web or paralysis spam, as these playstyles enable Lucario to pick up KOs with Close Combat on normally faster foes that can tank +2 Extreme Speed like Garchomp and Jolly Mamoswine.</p> "

Gliscor provides a very good Heatran and Magnezone check while also defogging for Tangrowth, while Tangrowth makes up for Gliscor's weakness to Water-types like Azumarill, Feraligatr, and Rotom-W. Clefable provides an excellent Weavile check and can lure in Swords Dance Scizor and KO it with Flamethrower, as Tangrowth tends to struggle with it. Rotom-W checks Heatran, Mamoswine, Weavile, and Swords Dance Scizor while pivoting Tangrowth in with Volt Switch. Starmie spins entry hazards away, allowing Tangrowth to stay healthy in the face of the powerful physical attackers it needs to check. Tangrowth also pairs very well with fellow Regenerator Pokemon Slowbro, making a Regenerator corethat covers each other's weaknesses thanks to the type synergy; for example, Slowbro checks Infernape, while Tangrowth checks Crawdaunt and Feraligatr.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W is one of the best defensive pivots in the tier due to its access to numerous utility options such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Volt Switch and its solid defensive stats and typing. Its auspicious typing, combined with Levitate, allows it to check common threats such as Scizor, Weavile, Feraligatr, and Mamoswine. It is easily able to maintain offensive momentum by threatening Ground-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Mamoswine with Will-O-Wisp or Hydro Pump. It can also act as a potent stall breaker with Nasty Plot and Trick combined with Choice Scarf, leaving common stall Pokemon that would otherwise beat like Clefable, Blissey, and Tangrowth exploitable by itself and hard-hitting teammates like Swords Dance Breloom and Swords Dance Garchomp. Choice Scarf Rotom-W is also a great revenge killer, able to OHKO threats like Crawdaunt and Belly Drum Azumarill or, in a pinch, save the day with a burn on Swords Dance sweepers like Garchomp and Lucario. Its great offensive potential and defensive utility make it a staple on bulky offense teams. However, Rotom-W has a poor HP stat, which, when combined with its lack of reliable recovery, leaves it susceptible to being worn down by hazards and status throughout the course of a match. Because of this vulnerability to chip damage, it is unable to consistently check threats like Scizor, Feraligatr, and Mamoswine in the long term. Rotom-W's Speed tier without its Choice Scarf leaves much to be desired, and sets lacking Thunder Wave are walled by Latias.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Due to Rotom-W's limited offensive movepool, there is very little possible move variation. Reflect can be run on the defensive set to act as a stronger check to Feraligatr, Azumarill, and Mamoswine. More Speed investment can be used on the Leftovers set, letting it outspeed Pokemon like Scizor, Mamoswine, and Nidoking. However, with lower defensive investment, it is a less reliable answer to threats like Feraligatr and Weavile. It also loses its ability to consistently act as a slow pivot. A specially defensive spread can be used to more reliably answer Starmie and Heatran. However, this makes it less able to check physical attackers, namely Feraligatr and Mamoswine.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Rotom-W is unable to do any meaningful damage to Tangrowth outside of burning it. Poison Heal Breloom can use Rotom-W to set up Substitute. However, non-Poison Heal Breloom does not like switching into Will-O-Wisp, and Rotom-W can simply pivot on Breloom with Volt Switch regardless of its set.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Although it has to exercise caution while switching in, Garchomp can threaten to OHKO Rotom-W with Outrage after some minor chip damage. However, Garchomp dislikes tanking a Hydro Pump and being burnt by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Rotom-W's low HP stat and a lack of reliable recovery leave it heavily susceptible to being worn down by hazards. Will-O-Wisp from opposing Rotom-W is also a major threat, as it becomes a far less consistent check to the likes of Scizor, Feraligatr and Mamoswine.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Gastrodon is one of the best counters to Rotom-W, as it is immune to Volt Switch and does not mind getting burned, and can burn Rotom-W back with Scald. It can even afford to run Sticky Hold to deny Trick from Choice Scarf variants. Blissey takes little from anything Rotom-W can throw at it and can either use it as set up fodder with Calm Mind or wear it down with Seismic Toss. However, Blissey is absolutely crippled by Trick.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Hydro Pump is used to hit Ground-types like Garchomp, Gliscor, and Mamoswine that attempt to block Volt Switch. Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-W cripple physical attackers like Azumarill, Feraligatr, and Scizor. Thunder Wave debilitates Pokemon that rely on their high Speed like Weavile and Alakazam, making them easier to revenge kill. Protect can be used to scout Choice item users like Azumarill while also being able to rack up extra Will-O-Wisp damage and gain more recovery from Leftovers. Alternatively, Discharge can be used for a second Electric STAB that has a nasty 30% paralysis rate, and a higher base power that allows it to KO threats like Belly Drum Azumarill. However, it indirectly inhibits Will-O-Wisp, as if Discharge paralyzes a strong physical attacker like Scizor or Tyranitar, it can prove to be a liability. Both Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave can be run at the same time to give Rotom-W more flexibility in terms of spreading status, but this is not generally recommended. 8 Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt.</p> <p>This set fits on bulky offense and balance teams where it acts as a slow pivot, safely bringing in strong offensive teammates while checking Heatran, Mamoswine, and Feraligatr. Heatran is a good partner, dealing with Pokemon that check Rotom-W like Tangrowth and Clefable while also providing Stealth Rock support. In return, Heatran appreciates Rotom-W's ability to beat Water- and Ground-types like Slowbro, Mamoswine, and Gliscor. Scizor can check Latios and Latias while appreciating Rotom-W checking Heatran and forming a VoltTurn core. Strong offensive Pokemon like Alakazam, Breloom, and Garchomp are able to take advantage of the offensive momentum Rotom-W generates while also appreciating Rotom-W's ability to chip foes, softening them up for the late-game.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Rotom-W reliably revenge kills Azumarill and Crawdaunt and outspeeds and threatens common threats like Feraligatr and Weavile. Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to gain momentum while bringing in teammates safely. Hydro Pump is effective at thwarting Ground-types that are immune to Volt Switch such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Mamoswine while also threatening Pokemon such as Tyranitar. Trick cripples passive walls such as Clefable, Tangrowth, and Blissey. It also greatly annoys setup sweepers like Garchomp and Breloom. Will-O-Wisp is an option that lets Rotom-W cripple Garchomp, Scizor, Weavile, and Feraligatr while also threatening Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Tyranitar. Nasty Plot allows Rotom-W to become a potent wallbreaker after it sheds its Choice Scarf due to its good bulk making it difficult to revenge kill and good STAB coverage.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-W best fits on offense, bulky offense, and balance teams that appreciate its role compression as a Ground-immune offensive pivot and revenge killer that can maintain momentum. Scizor is an excellent teammate since it makes an excellent VoltTurn core with Rotom-W and it checks strong special attackers like Alakazam, which would otherwise overwhelm and force Rotom-W out. Gliscor is another great partner, as it also creates a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W and provides Stealth Rock and Knock Off support to allow Rotom-W to better wear down Blissey. In return, Rotom-W checks Water- and Ice-types like Feraligatr, Azumarill, Weavile, and Mamoswine for Scizor and Gliscor. Heatran is another excellent partner, as it checks Pokemon that can force out Rotom-W, such as Tangrowth and Latios, while also providing Stealth Rock support. In return, Rotom-W is able to come in on Ground-types such as Garchomp and Mamoswine. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Gliscor and Starmie is great for Rotom-W, as it increases Rotom-W's longevity. Since Choice Scarf Rotom-W is unable to consistently check Water-types like Azumarill and Feraligatr, additional checks to them such as Tangrowth and Shaymin are appreciated.</p> "
