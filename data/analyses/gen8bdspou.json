  "Weavile": {
    "overview": "<p>Weavile is an excellent wallbreaker in BDSP OU by virtue of its great offensive typing and sheer power. Its amazing Speed tier is one of its biggest advantages, as it is faster than the entire unboosted metagame, allowing it to outspeed the likes of Latios, Alakazam, and Garchomp. All of these assets make it a near unstoppable wallbreaker, able to burst through common checks such as Scizor and Azumarill with Assurance and Poison Jab, respectively. However, Weavile's susceptibility to Stealth Rock and frailty mean it requires solid entry hazard removal and slow pivoting to bring it in safely in order for it to wallbreak. Its frailty also makes it prone to strong priority from Infernape, Breloom, and Lucario, rendering its high Speed useless. Furthermore, it can still get walled by Pokemon like physically defensive Scizor, Skarmory, and Poliwrath, although the former is uncommon and the latter two are rarely seen outside of stall.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A set utilizing Swords Dance alongside Never-Melt Ice or a Life Orb can also be used in order to clean in late-game scenarios more easily, although its lack of longevity with a Life Orb, alongside its difficulty in setting up, make it a suboptimal choice outside of certain hyper offense structures. Brick Break or Focus Punch can be run to nail Heatran and Lucario without requiring Stealth Rock chip damage; however, the former option is extremely weak and doesn't do enough to Heatran to justify using it, and the latter is extremely inconsistent and prediction reliant.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-type Pokemon such as Scizor and Heatran can pivot into and force out Weavile, as they resist its Ice-type STAB moves and don't take too much from Throat Chop; the former is able to heal off any damage it takes with Roost, while the latter threatens Weavile with a Flame Body burn. However, they both quickly falter to Assurance after taking entry hazard damage and Beat Up. Skarmory outright walls Weavile, as it takes negligible damage from all of Weavile's attacks and can heal with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Azumarill and physically defensive Clefable can comfortable switch into Weavile's Dark-type STAB move and either resist or can heal off its Icicle Crash. However, the former is easily worn down due to its lack of recovery, and the latter barely lives 2 Icicle Crashes and doesn't even OHKO Weavile, making both fairly shaky checks. Furthermore, both fear a stray Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Both Infernape and Lucario can switch into Weavile a few times and force it out with their STAB moves due to their typings; however, their mediocre bulk and lack of recovery make them far from consistent. Breloom is unable to safely switch into Weavile due to it fearing Weavile's Ice-type STAB moves; however, it forces Weavile out with Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Priority moves such as Infernape and Breloom's Mach Punch, Scizor's Bullet Punch, Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet, and Lucario and Dragonite and Lucario's Extreme Speed are extremely threatening to Weavile, as they take advantage of its poor physical bulk while ignoring its high Speed. Infernape, Breloom, and Scizor easily OHKO Weavile without any prior damage; however, the rest require minor chip damage, such as Stealth Rock, to KO it.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Throat Chop is Weavile's strongest Dark-type STAB option, as well as its most spammable move, taking advantage of the tier's lack of formidable Dark-resistant Pokemon. Icicle Crash deals with the few Pokemon that can switch into Weavile's Throat Chop, such as Togekiss and Clefable, as well as allowing Weavile to consistently force out the likes of Gliscor and Garchomp. Ice Shard lets it revenge kill faster boosted Pokemon and Choice Scarf users such as +1 Dragonite, Garchomp, and Latias. Assurance is Weavile's best option for its last moveslot, as it can KO Scizor and Heatran after Stealth Rock as well as heavily dent Skarmory. Poison Jab is another option that lets Weavile chunk Fairy-types such as Azumarill and Clefable much harder, although it doesn't have much use outside of that. Beat Up can also be run on more offensive teams; this works extremely well with teammates that have high Attack stats, providing Weavile with an extremely powerful STAB option that lets it break past would-be checks such as Skarmory and Heatran with ease and kill Focus Sash Alakazam.</p> <p>Weavile works best on bulky offense teams that can provide it with sufficient pivot support and entry hazard removal to enable it to wallbreak successfully. Pokemon like Rotom-W, Scizor, and Gliscor that can easily bring Weavile in safely via slow pivoting are solid partners. Solid entry hazard removal such as Rapid Spin from Starmie and Defog from Scizor and Gliscor are amazing alongside Weavile, as they vastly improve its longevity. A strong defensive backbone formed from Pokemon such as Latias, Slowbro, and Tangrowth is helpful to absorb the strong priority moves directed at Weavile such as Mach Punch and Extreme Speed. Magnezone, specifically, is a stellar partner, as it removes Steel-types such as Scizor and Skarmory, making Weavile much harder to deal with defensively. Other physical attackers such as Garchomp and Breloom work well with Weavile, as they can overwhelm their shared checks together.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Magnezone's powerful ability Magnet Pull lets it eliminate or heavily chip defensive Steel-types in Skarmory and Scizor, which many teams rely on to check some of the tier's most powerful offensive Pokemon like Latios and Weavile. It is an incredibly strong attacker in its own right, firing off powerful Flash Cannons and Thunderbolts that pressure most of the tier. However, Ground-types can switch into Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, sapping all of of Magnezone's momentum. Magnezone's reliance on Choice Specs means that, once it has successfully trapped and KOed its Steel-type target, it is forced to switch out or be sacrificed, often costing the team momentum. This is exacerbated by Volt Switch failing to pressure specially defensive Scizor, one of Magnezone's main targets. Magnezone's low Speed leaves it forced out by many of the tier's numerous offensive Pokemon, and it is unable to trap some Steel-types like Jirachi and invested Heatran effectively due to their bulk. Additionally, both Scizor and Skarmory can run a Shed Shell to render Magnezone's niche null and void.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If trapping opposing Steel-types is not needed, Magnezone can drop Magnet Pull for Analytic to become an even more fearsome special wallbreaker. However, there are many other special wallbreakers, namely Latios, Alakazam, Starmie, and even Azelf, that offer more utility, a better Speed tier, and better coverage, making this option niche at best.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Shed Shell: Both Scizor and Skarmory can run Shed Shell to negate Magnet Pull, rendering Magnezone's niche null and void. However, Shed Shell can be removed by Knock Off from teammates.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Gliscor, Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Donphan can revenge kill Magnezone if it is locked into an Electric-type move and block Volt Switch; however, they loathe switching into Flash Cannon. Gastrodon, on the other hand, is a particularly good Magnezone check, as it can easily switch into all of Magnezone's moves due to its typing and special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Blissey: Blissey can switch into Magnezone and effectively force it out with Seismic Toss. However, switching into repeated Volt Switches will leave Blissey unable to check other special attackers.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Many offensive Pokemon outspeed Magnezone and force it out. Latios resists Thunderbolt and Volt switch and can hit Magnezone with a powerful Surf. Infernape resists Flash Cannon and forces Magnezone out with Close Combat and Flare Blitz. Breloom resists Thunderbolt and Volt Switch and can use Magnezone to set up or fire off a Spore. Lucario forces Magnezone out with Close Combat and can set up if it's locked into Flash Cannon. Dragonite OHKOes Magnezone with Earthquake and heavily pressures it with Fire Punch. None of these Pokemon appreciate switching into Magnezone's powerful attacks, however.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Magnezone's game plan is fairly straightforward: trap a Steel-type and either KO or heavily damage it with Thunderbolt. Volt Switch is useful for keeping momentum while KOing targets if Skarmory's Sturdy is broken or if Scizor has been chipped into its range as well as for pivoting on specially bulky Pokemon like Latias and Blissey. Flash Cannon hits incoming Ground-types like Gliscor and Garchomp that attempt to block Magnezone's Volt Switch. Tri Attack is a generally good middle-ground move to hit Ground-types and Water-types without the need to predict, as well as for hitting Electric-types like Rotom-C and Raikou neutrally. Explosion is instead useful for generating momentum on offensive teams once Magnezone is no longer needed, heavily damaging a foe and getting in a teammate for free. Discharge is an option to fish for a paralysis on specially defensive Heatran and Latios. A Timid nature is preferred so that Magnezone outspeeds offensive Adamant Scizor and defensive Rotom-W; however, a Modest nature can be used to KO Scizor with less chip damage.</p> <p>Many Pokemon appreciate Magnezone eliminating Steel-type foes like Skarmory and Scizor. Latios is perhaps its best partner, as many teams rely on Scizor to check Latios. Physical wallbreakers like Dragonite, Garchomp, Azumarill, and Weavile, which need Skarmory out of the picture to effectively function, make for excellent choices as well. Azumarill and Weavile can also take advantage of the Ground-types like Donphan and Gliscor Magnezone invites in, while Dragonite and Garchomp appreciate Magnezone threatening Clefable, Togekiss, and Rotom-W. Knock Off users like Donphan, Gliscor, and Tangrowth can bait in Scizor and Skarmory and remove a potential Shed Shell from them, ensuring that Magnezone can successfully trap them; they also are good defensive answers to Ground-types like Garchomp and Gliscor, which force Magnezone out once it has trapped something. Stealth Rock from Gliscor and Clefable ensures that Sturdy won't let Skarmory set an entry hazard on Magnezone before falling. Magnezone works well with U-turn users that bait in Skarmory and Scizor like Gliscor and Scizor.</p> "
