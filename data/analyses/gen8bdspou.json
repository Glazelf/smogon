Between its good STAB combination, wide variety of coverage moves, and the large number of Pokemon threatened by its strong attacks, such as Heatran and Clefable, it naturally performs well against balance and stall teams. However, Nidoking can struggle against more offensive teams thanks to its underwhelming Speed tier and weakness to common offensive typings like Water, Ground and Psychic. Furthermore, even in good matchups it can feel a bit prediction reliant, as the opponent can pivot around its moves into a faster threat.</p> ",

Flamethrower is used to OHKO Scizor and Skarmory, as well as ease prediction against Steel-types. A Timid nature allows Nidoking to outspeed Timid Heatran, Jolly Feraligatr and Adamant Lucario, but the power boost Modest provides can be appealing to some teams.</p> <p>Nidoking mainly fits on balance and bulky offense, as it is a useful tool for dismantling bulkier teams. Due to its poor defensive profile, Nidoking can struggle to get onto the field; therefore, it appreciates pivoting support from teammates such as Rotom-W and Scizor. The former can even switch into Water types that might give Nidoking trouble, while the latter can do the same for Psychic types. It also pairs well with more offensive pivots, like Choice Band Infernape, who can pressure Blissey, the best answer to Nidoking. Entry Hazards can amplify Nidoking's wallbreaking potential, and as such, setters like Heatran and Skarmory are great partners. Dragon-types like Dragonite and Latios enjoy the pressure Nidoking puts on Clefable and Steel-types.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nidoking can run Focus Punch over Flamethrower to lure in and heavily damage Blissey, leaving it unable to answer it anymore. However, the lack of any use beyond this specific matchup makes the reliability of Flamethrower more valuable for most teams. Toxic Spikes can help wear down some of its checks like the afromentioned Blissey, as well as Slowking, while supporting its teammates. However, this can limit Nidoking's wallbreaking capabilities. A Focus Sash set with Stealth Rock is another option, as Nidoking beats Gliscor, one of the best defoggers in the tier, and can get something done even in unfavorable matchups. However, dropping Life Orb leaves Nidoking unable to net some important KOs, such as against Scizor and Rotom-W. Nidoking can also run Thunderbolt as another useful coverage option to hit bulky Water types that might otherwise give it trouble, like Milotic and Slowking, but those targets aren't common enough to warrant the move's usage most of the time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Due to its average speed and middling bulk, a lot of fast Pokémon can easily revenge kill Nidoking, such as Latios, Garchomp, Weavile, and Starmie. Crawdaunt and Azumarill can OHKO it with Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Blissey: Blissey is by far the best answer to Nidoking, easily tanking all its moves aside from the rare Focus Punch while sporting reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled. While it can be overwhelmed through team support, it is often a hard stop to anything Nidoking does.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Some Water-types, like Slowking or Milotic, can switch into most of Nidoking's attacks and threaten it back with their Water STAB moves. Choice Scarf Rotom-W can switch into anything but Sludge Wave, outspeed it and threaten it with Hydro Pump.</p> "

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Defensive Clefable is a staple for bulkier teams, as it blanket checks a myriad of setup sweepers such as Feraligatr, Garchomp, and Azumarill courtesy of its ability Unaware. Furthermore, its amazing Fairy typing allows it to pivot into Dragon-type STAB moves from the aforementioned Garchomp, Latias, and Dragonite, forcing them out. With Thunder Wave to debilitate the likes of Heatran or Flamethrower to punish other Steel-types, Clefable isn't easy to safely pivot into. Its access to utility moves such as Wish, Aromatherapy, and Stealth Rock makes it extremely customizable to support a team's needs. Calm Mind also turns it into a solid wincon for slower teams and makes it overall less passive. However, Clefable's reliance on Wish + Protect to sustain itself long-term renders it extremely passive and easily exploitable by prominent threats such as Magnezone and Nidoking. Furthermore, its overall bulk is fairly mediocre, meaning strong unboosted attacks such as Choice Band Infernape's Flare Blitz and Choice Specs Latias's Psychic completely demolish it. Moreover, it is easily chipped down by entry hazards, which make it a shaky blanket check if the team lacks sufficient entry hazard removal. However, Clefable is hard to pass up on due to its success against a lot of prominent sweepers, and its minor issues are easily fixed by its partners, making it a top-tier choice on more balanced teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Moonlight might seem tempting as an immediate recovery option that doesn’t require Protect; however, its extremely limited PP make it detrimental in the long term. A Magic Guard set utilizing a Life Orb can turn Clefable into a potent attacker, making use of its amazing coverage options such as Focus Blast for Heatran, Ice Beam for Gliscor, and Thunderbolt for Skarmory. Despite that, being forced to run Moonlight for recovery makes Clefable much easier to overwhelm, and this set loses much of the defensive utility that Unaware brings over Magic Guard. Aromatherapy is an option if teams desperately need a cleric; however, it bothering Gliscor and having very specific usage make it a mediocre option. A set with Stored Power and Calm Mind or Cosmic Power can sweep unprepared teams, but it is extremely matchup dependent, as it is walled by Dark-types and easily pressured by status. Cosmic Power + Charge Beam is a similar option, but it forfeits a lot of Clefable's defensive capabilities and is extremely inconsistent. Lastly, a specially or mixed defensive set can also be used to take hits such as Latias's and Alakazam's Psychics better, although Clefable's partners often naturally take such hits for it, and these sets make Clefable much more easily overwhelmed by the likes of Feraligatr and Azumarill.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Offensive Steel-types such as Magnezone, Jirachi, Heatran, and Lucario easily force Clefable out, but they are easily worn down and the latter three hate Thunder Wave. Clefable is normally unable to break past Scizor, but Scizor dislikes being paralyzed and Calm Mind sets can break past it in the long term. Further, all of these Steel-types bar Heatran fall to Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Entry hazards easily put Clefable into range of being overwhelmed by the foes it is supposed to check. If Clefable gets statused, it becomes much easier to break through as well, as burn chip damage negates the passive Leftovers recovery, paralysis makes its Wish + Protect much more inconsistent, and Toxic prevents it from stonewalling setup sweepers.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Due to its mediocre bulk, Clefable can easily be broken through by powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Band Infernape, Life Orb Garchomp, and Choice Specs Latias.</p> <p><strong>Taunt / Trick / Whirlwind User: Due to Clefable's passiveness, it is easily shut down by Taunt from Pokemon like Heatran and Gliscor. Trick + Choice Scarf from the likes of Rotom-W also makes it much easier to take advantage of, and Choice Scarf prevents it from consistently healing. Lastly, phazing from the likes of Whirlwind Skarmory prevents Clefable from recovering properly.</p> ",

Furthermore, it also turns Clefable into a potent wincon that cleans up weakened teams.

Blissey is one of its best partners because together, they deal with all the relevant special attackers, with Blissey safely pivoting into Pokemon like Choice Specs Latias and Nidoking that can overwhelm Clefable. In return, Clefable deals with the likes of Focus Sash + Nasty Plot Alakazam, which breaks through Blissey. Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Rotom-W are also amazing partners, as they deal with Pokemon like Choice Band Weavile, Life Orb Garchomp, and Choice Band Infernape that break through Clefable. Gliscor and Starmie can absorb a stray Toxic or Spore directed at Clefable and remove entry hazards to keep it healthy, as well as dealing with Lucario for it. Lastly, Tangrowth and Celebi can pivot into Pokemon that easily overpower Clefable such as Choice Band Breloom and Azumarill, form a solid defensive core to check Crawdaunt, and make Life Orb Garchomp easier to play around.</p> "

Alakazam's high Speed tier lets it outspeed other prominent threats such as Infernape and Starmie, forcing them out with its superb coverage. Furthermore, Magic Guard gives Alakazam a myriad of benefits, such as preventing it from being worn down by entry hazards, preserving its Focus Sash, and mitigating Life Orb recoil. Furthermore, counterplay to Alakazam differs depending on what item it is running; using a Life Orb denies nearly all defensive counterplay options through its sheer power, while running a Focus Sash prevents Alakazam from being instantly revenge killed, which is often enough for it to break apart more offensive teams. However, Alakazam is not without its flaws, as its physical bulk is extremely poor, causing it to be revenge killed easily and limiting its setup opportunities. Moreover, its reliance on Focus Blast to deal with Dark- and Steel-types means just one miss can ruin it. Additionally, while Alakazam has a strong offensive presence, it rarely ever threatens to OHKO foes without a boost, meaning if Focus Sash has been broken or it is known to be using a Life Orb, multiple Pokemon can just tank a hit from it and OHKO it back.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Recover gives Alakazam the chance to heal off weak hits and use passive Pokemon like non-Calm Mind and non-Thunder Wave Blissey as complete setup fodder while restoring its Focus Sash should it get chipped. However, Alakazam's pitiful bulk makes this option rarely relevant in practice. Dazzling Gleam gives Alakazam a consistent option to hit Dark-types without Focus Blast's chance to miss; however, it is much weaker and leaves Alakazam helpless against some Steel-types. If Shadow Ball is replaced, Alakazam becomes unable to break Jirachi and opposing Alakazam, making Dazzling Gleam a much worse option regardless of what move is dropped. Encore can lock Pokemon into a non-damaging move, giving Alakazam or its teammates free setup turns; however, it is inconsistent and can very rarely be used. Taunt is usable on hyper offense teams to prevent entry hazards or dual screens from going up from slower leads like Azelf and Skarmory while preventing the likes of Scizor and Skarmory from recovering. It can also deny Defog from Scizor and Gliscor, helping teammates like Lucario and Feraligatr sweep more easily.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Scizor walls Focus Sash variants of Alakazam, while Life Orb variants require getting a sequence correct and landing multiple Focus Blasts, making Scizor as close to a counter as you can get. Heatran can switch into Alakazam's Psychic-type STAB moves and Shadow Ball a few times and force it out; however, it can lose if Alakazam uses Nasty Plot or Focus Blast as it switches in. Similarly, Jirachi can switch into Alakazam's Psychic-type STAB move and Focus Blast; however it loses if Alakazam sets up with Nasty Plot or hits it with Shadow Ball on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killing: Faster Pokemon like Weavile and Choice Scarf Garchomp can revenge kill Alakazam, although they are unable to safely switch into it directly. Beat Up and Dual Chop, respectively, bypass Alakazam's Focus Sash if it has one, making them much more consistent at checking it. Priority such as Dragonite and Lucario's Extreme Speed and Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet easily remove Alakazam due to its poor physical bulk; however, they are unable to switch into it. To add onto that, Focus Sash variants of Alakazam can live one hit from full HP and potentially KO these Pokemon back. As such, this requires Alakazam to either be chipped or scouted first in order to consistently revenge kill it.</p> ",

Focus Blast lets Alakazam nail the Steel- and Dark-types that would otherwise wall it such as Tyranitar, Scizor, and Heatran. Shadow Ball deals with opposing Psychic-types such as opposing Alakazam, and Jirachi, which can switch into Focus Blast and Alakazam's Psychic-type STAB move. Magic Guard benefits Alakazam no matter which item it is running; if running Life Orb, Magic Guard prevents its recoil; if running Focus Sash, Magic Guard preserves it in the face of entry hazards. Life Orb can be used to wallbreak much more effectively, notably allowing Alakazam to 2HKO Scizor with Focus Blast after Stealth Rock chip. Focus Sash in turn provides a one-time safety net for Alakazam to setup for free or revenge kill something safely.</p> <p>Alakazam fits best on offense and bulky offense teams, as both archetypes are fast-paced enough to take advantage of Alakazam punching holes in opposing walls while still maintaining the ability to safely bring it in multiple times. Due to Alakazam's frailty, it greatly appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon such as Gliscor, Rotom-W, and Scizor to bring it in safely. Stealth Rock support from the aforementioned Gliscor, Heatran, and Garchomp are extremely useful, as they allow Alakazam to break through its checks more easily. Azelf is a solid partner, as it can form an exceptionally potent Psychic Spam core, weakening their shared checks. The likes of Weavile, Nidoking, and Nasty Plot Rotom-W work well with Alakazam to wallbreak for each other. A strong defensive core is also appreciated alongside Alakazam, as it invites in powerful revenge killers like Weavile. Focus Sash Alakazam works exceptionally well on hyper offense teams with partners such as Feraligatr, Azumarill, and Lucario, as it provides a one-time countermeasure to opposing sweepers and can clean weakened teams due to its high Speed tier, all while Focus Sash prevents it from being revenge killed by priority. Clefable also can assist Scizor in checking the likes of Garchomp and Weavile on balance teams, as Scizor can get easily overwhelmed.</p> "

Starmie’s great coverage allows it constantly force switches, activating Analytic. However, Starmie’s unboosted power is somewhat lacking due to its average base 100 Special Attack, leaving it reliant on Analytic to find a way around special walls like Blissey and Jirachi. In addition to this, Hydro Pump, while providing crucial damage output, is unreliable due to its accuracy, making Starmie somewhat inconsistent. Its typing, while providing tangible defensive merit, does not compensate for its vulnerability to repeated hits from offensive Pokemon.

However, Starmie generally prefers Scald and Hydro Pump due to the former threatening checks with a burn and the latter having much more power.

Due to the absence of Fire Punch, Magnezone is particularly valuable as it traps defensive Skarmory and prevents it from phasing Dragonite with Whirlwind. More generally, Lucario and Nidoking are powerful wallbreakers that are able to effectively damage Fairy- and Steel-types such as Scizor and Unaware Clefable that would otherwise prevent Dragonite from sweeping. Also, Pokemon such as Latias and Alakazam like Dragonite's ability to severely damage shared checks like Weavile and Scizor for their own sweeping attempt.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Azumarill graces BDSP OU as either a terrifying, hard-to-scout Belly Drum sweeper or a strong wallbreaker with Choice Band. Huge Power, STAB priority in Aqua Jet, and a rarely-resisted STAB combination back up its offense, while its Water / Fairy typing helps it switch into prominent Dragon-types and some offensive threats. Azumarill is generally a strong option for hyper offense and standard offense teams, since Aqua Jet is handy in the priority-heavy BDSP OU metagame, and it switches into offensive foes such as Feraligatr, Weavile, and Infernape to quickly wreak havoc. However, it needs support to stay healthy —especially if using Belly Drum— and to handle certain threats. Its low Speed leaves it vulnerable defensively despite its decent bulk and Aqua Jet, and it needs help to pressure the common Breloom and Rotom-Wash, which massively threaten it in return. Azumarill's main set, Belly Drum + Sitrus Berry, also struggles to beat Unaware Clefable, a common defensive glue Pokemon that it can't 2HKO. Still, Azumarill usually only needs one window of opportunity to either sweep or put a dent in the opposition.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Belly Drum Azumarill can run an alternative EV spread of 92 HP / 252 Atk / 164 Spe with an Adamant nature. This spread improves its bulk while still outspeeding defensive Skarmory. Facade is a niche alternative to Superpower for Choice Band Azumarill that allows it to still be functional if it is burned.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Defensive Tangrowth can switch into Choice Band Azumarill, but it has to scout Azumarill's set, since Belly Drum lets Play Rough OHKO it. Breloom falls to Play Rough but resists Aqua Jet and outspeeds Azumarill, letting it revenge kill Azumarill with Seed Bomb or Bullet Seed. It can also use Spore and then set up. Shaymin forces Azumarill out with Seed Flare and can stomach +6 Aqua Jet; however, it cannot switch into Choice Band Play Rough unless it has Defense investment.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-W: Rotom-W can cripple Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp, resists Aqua Jet, and easily threatens massive damage with Volt Switch or Thunderbolt. While Rotom-W doesn't like to take a Play Rough on the switch, Azumarill can only outspeed even uninvested Rotom-W with a suboptimal Jolly nature.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Quagsire with Unaware can avoid 2HKOs from Belly Drum Azumarill and stall it out with Toxic barring Waterfall flinches, but it does struggle against the Choice Band set, which cleanly 2HKOes it. Empoleon can phaze Belly Drum Azumarill one time, but it fares much better against the Choice Band set, as it can take all its attacks besides Superpower. Milotic naturally outspeeds Azumarill and wipes out its Belly Drum boost with Haze. Milotic struggles against the Choice Band set, though, since Play Rough 2HKOes unless Marvel Scale is active. Azumarill, regardless of the set, fears a Scald burn when facing bulky Water-types in general.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Most offensive threats can damage Belly Drum Azumarill enough that it either can't set up or enters KO range for most priority moves. Azumarill's most notable revenge killers are Latias, and Starmie, which can safely take a +6 Aqua Jet, even with chip damage, and OHKO Azumarill. Focus Sash Alakazam can also check Azumarill in a pinch, being able to deal with the Choice Band set with two Psychic hits, provided Azumarill isn't locked into Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Faster Priority: Lucario, Dragonite, and offensive Scizor can pick off weakened Azumarill with priority before it can use Aqua Jet. Choice Band Dragonite can even take a Play Rough from Choice Band Azumarill, 2HKOing in return with Extreme Speed.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set is designed for Azumarill to clean up late-game or heavily cripple the opposition. Once set-up Aqua Jet is its go-to move for most situations thanks to its priority. Sitrus Berry helps Azumarill beat priority revenge killers and take a hit while setting up. Mystic Water is an alternative to strengthen Aqua Jet and give a small chance to 2HKO Unaware Clefable with Waterfall. Azumarill can set up against a Latias Choiced locked into Draco Meteor or Surf, or on a Garchomp locked into Outrage. After setting up, Azumarill does need to worry about phazers like full-health Skarmory and maximally physically defensive Empoleon, but it can blow past chipped Skarmory and other Empoleon sets.</p> <p>Azumarill works best on hyper offense teams, where it can immediately threaten a sweep after a turn of setup. This set does get checked by Unaware Clefable, which is a common blanket check for the numerous setup sweepers in the tier, so a teammate like Lucario that can deal with it is great. Azumarill will need teammates that can handle Shaymin and Breloom, since both can take an Aqua Jet at +6 and threaten it with an OHKO. The most important tip with using this set is to, before sweeping, use teammates to wear down or take out Pokemon that avoid the OHKO from +6 Aqua Jet. For example, Choice Scarf users such as Infernape can wear down Starmie, and Latias with U-Turn. Scizor's U-Turn threatens to OHKO those threats and can get Azumarill into the game safely without losing momentum. Alakazam and Weavile both threaten Starmie, and Latias with their superior Speed. Garchomp is another great teammate for Azumarill to provide Stealth Rock and also deal with Magnezone, which outspeeds Azumarill and threatens it before Belly Drum. Azelf, and suicide lead Skarmory support Azumarill and its hyper offense teammates with dual screens and entry hazards. Focus Sash Alakazam, Breloom, and Dragonite are notable late-game cleaners that appreciate Azumarill's wallbreaking ability, which makes their roles easier.</p> "

Scizor pivots Azumarill in and tends to invite in Heatran and Infernape, which Azumarill performs well against. Rotom-W and Gliscor are notable defensive pivots that Azumarill works well with thanks to their Will-O-Wisp support and Electric immunity, respectively.

It can be a slow defensive pivot, thanks to U-turn, a defensive Swords Dance cleaner late-game, or a dangerous offensive Swords Dance sweeper; the former two even can be compressed onto the same set. However, Scizor finds itself too reliant on Bullet Punch to deal damage, which allows Steel-resistant Pokemon such as Skarmory, Heatran, and Lucario to take advantage of it. Scizor is also vulnerable to the common Magnezone, which can trap and easily deal heavy damage to it. Scizor has a quadruple weakness to Fire, allowing Pokemon such as Garchomp, Clefable, and Togekiss to run Fire-type coverage, bait in Scizor, and OHKO it. Furthermore, defensive Scizor is setup fodder against the likes of Feraligatr, Dragonite, and Nasty Plot Rotom-W.</p> ",

A 252 HP / 156 Def / 100 SpD set with Shed Shell as the item can be used, strictly on balance, to semi-check Latios and escape Magnezone's Magnet Pull.

Slowbro and Milotic wall defensive Scizor forever and can use Scald to burn it, with Slowbro even capable of 2HKOing it with Flamethrower.

Starmie and Rotom-W are amazing with Scizor, as they threaten Infernape, Heatran, Skarmory, and Lucario. Additionally, Rotom-W and Gliscor are slow pivots and can form potent VoltTurn cores with it. Dangerous wallbreakers like Garchomp, Infernape, and Crawdaunt benefit from Scizor's slow U-turn allowing them free entry. Weavile, Alakazam, and Mamoswine also benefit from this, as they struggle to enter the field at times. Scizor finds it hard to deal with Magnezone Ground-types like Gliscor and Garchomp provide reliable counterplay against it.

Similarly, Feraligatr takes care of these Fire-types, and it also forcibly chips bulky Water-types despite lacking priority.

    "overview": "<p>Garchomp is a fantastic offensive Pokemon between its massive Attack stat, great Speed tier that lets it outrun much of OU, powerful STAB combination, and impressive natural bulk, which lets it trade favorably with other offensive Pokemon and find easy setup opportunities with Swords Dance. Coverage moves in Fire Blast and Stone Edge bolster its offensive presence even further, allowing it to crush would-be answers like Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Togekiss. Garchomp even has access to Stealth Rock and a useful ability in Rough Skin, which both make it even more effective at wearing down the opposition for itself and its teammates, providing utility outside of its amazing wallbreaking. All of this combines to make Garchomp a fantastic wallbreaker, potential wincon, and offensive utility Pokemon in one package. However, Garchomp is hindered by common Ice- and Dragon-type moves from Weavile, Mamoswine, and Latias, and its Speed tier, while great, is still beat by prominent offensive threats such as Starmie, Infernape, and Latias. Furthermore, its standard sets can struggle to break through healthy defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro, Clefable, Togekiss, but these flaws are nowhere near enough to dethrone it as one of the best Pokemon around.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Garchomp can use both Swords Dance and Stealth Rock at the same time, compressing its wallbreaking and utility capabilities into a single set; however, this comes at the expense of coverage, which limits how threatening it can be in some matchups. A set with Swords Dance, Substitute, and a Salac Berry can potentially break games open by stopping offensive teams from revenge killing Garchomp, sweeping through teams with ease, but it has the same problem of taking up a coverage moveslot. Choice Band Garchomp boasts impressive immediate power, but Life Orb's power boost is usually more than enough for it to wallbreak effectively, and Choice Band requires much more precise play, as Garchomp's STAB moves have common immunities.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Weavile and Starmie both outspeed and threaten to cleanly OHKO Garchomp, but neither can comfortably switch into its attacks. Latias does the same and can potentially switch in on a predicted Earthquake. Mamoswine, while not actually faster, can OHKO Garchomp with a priority Life Orb-boosted Ice Shard. Life Orb Alakazam can KO a weakened Garchomp, and Focus Sash Alakazam can beat Garchomp lacking Dual Chop one-on-one at the expense of its Focus Sash, if needed.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fairy-type Pokemon: Physically defensive Clefable can handle Swords Dance Garchomp one-on-one if it switches in safely thanks to Unaware, and it totally walls Choice Scarf Garchomp while healthy—however, it must be used carefully, as Life Orb-boosted Earthquake will 2HKO it after Stealth Rock damage. Togekiss entirely walls standard Garchomp sets, but it must be wary of Stone Edge. Both can also guarantee the removal of a Garchomp that is locked into using Outrage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-type Pokemon: A healthy Slowbro can survive a boosted Earthquake from Swords Dance Garchomp and OHKO it back with Ice Beam after minimal prior damage, although this will fail against Yache Berry sets. Rotom-W can punish Choice Scarf Garchomp for using Earthquake; defensive Rotom-W sets also force Swords Dance Garchomp to lock into Outrage, and Choice Scarf Rotom-W hinders it with a burn or Trick. However, Rotom-W can't consistently switch into Garchomp's Dragon-type moves and is easily worn down, making it an inconsistent check. Milotic can handle Choice Scarf Garchomp quite well, but it can't stand up to Swords Dance or Life Orb variants. A healthy Azumarill or Feraligatr can usually tank a hit from an unboosted Garchomp and OHKO it back in a pinch.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Tangrowth and Skarmory easily take either of Garchomp's STAB attacks, and the former can put it to sleep in a pinch, while the latter can phaze Garchomp with Whirlwind.

Lucario should be paired with wallbreakers that can soften up the enemy team for it to an eventually sweep like Breloom, Dragonite, Feraligatr, and Alakazam.

        "description": "<p>Knock Off allows Tangrowth to hit dangerous special attackers and cripple them by getting rid of Heatran and Latias's items while OHKOing Alakazam outright. Earthquake expands on Tangrowth's coverage, allowing it to hit Magnezone, Heatran, and Jirachi, while Sleep Powder allows it to put its switch-ins out of commission, further discouraging the opponent from pivoting around it. Sludge Bomb allows Tangrowth to check opposing Grass-types like Breloom, Shaymin, and Rotom-C, this is particularly important against Breloom, as Tangrowth is immune to Spore. It also allows Tangrowth to spread poison around to rack up incremental damage. Tangrowth's lack of an item makes it an excellent Knock Off absorber; it is forced to not run an item because it otherwise can't take a Swords Dance boosted Knock Off from Life Orb Crawdaunt.</p> <p>Tangrowth generally pairs up with fellow defensive Pokemon that patch its weaknesses. Blissey checks Latias and other special attackers. Gliscor provides a very good Heatran and Magnezone check while also defogging for Tangrowth, while Tangrowth makes up for Gliscor's weakness to Water-types like Azumarill, Feraligatr, and Rotom-W. Clefable provides an excellent Weavile check and can lure in Swords Dance Scizor and KO it with Flamethrower, as Tangrowth tends to struggle with it. Rotom-W checks Heatran, Mamoswine, Weavile, and Swords Dance Scizor while pivoting Tangrowth in with Volt Switch. Starmie spins entry hazards away, allowing Tangrowth to stay healthy in the face of the powerful physical attackers it needs to check. Tangrowth also pairs very well with fellow Regenerator Pokemon Slowbro, making a Regenerator corethat covers each other's weaknesses thanks to the type synergy; for example, Slowbro checks Infernape, while Tangrowth checks Crawdaunt and Feraligatr.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W is one of the best defensive pivots in the tier due to its access to numerous utility options such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Volt Switch and its solid defensive stats and typing. Its auspicious typing, combined with Levitate, allows it to check common threats such as Scizor, Weavile, Feraligatr, and Mamoswine. It is easily able to maintain offensive momentum by threatening Ground-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Mamoswine with Will-O-Wisp or Hydro Pump. It can also act as a potent stall breaker with Nasty Plot and Trick combined with Choice Scarf, leaving common stall Pokemon that would otherwise beat like Clefable, Blissey, and Tangrowth exploitable by itself and hard-hitting teammates like Swords Dance Breloom and Swords Dance Garchomp. Choice Scarf Rotom-W is also a great revenge killer, able to OHKO threats like Crawdaunt and Belly Drum Azumarill or, in a pinch, save the day with a burn on Swords Dance sweepers like Garchomp and Lucario. Its great offensive potential and defensive utility make it a staple on bulky offense teams. However, Rotom-W has a poor HP stat, which, when combined with its lack of reliable recovery, leaves it susceptible to being worn down by hazards and status throughout the course of a match. Because of this vulnerability to chip damage, it is unable to consistently check threats like Scizor, Feraligatr, and Mamoswine in the long term. Rotom-W's Speed tier without its Choice Scarf leaves much to be desired, and sets lacking Thunder Wave are walled by Latias.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Due to Rotom-W's limited offensive movepool, there is very little possible move variation. Reflect can be run on the defensive set to act as a stronger check to Feraligatr, Azumarill, and Mamoswine. More Speed investment can be used on the Leftovers set, letting it outspeed Pokemon like Scizor, Mamoswine, and Nidoking. However, with lower defensive investment, it is a less reliable answer to threats like Feraligatr and Weavile. It also loses its ability to consistently act as a slow pivot. A specially defensive spread can be used to more reliably answer Starmie and Heatran. However, this makes it less able to check physical attackers, namely Feraligatr and Mamoswine.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Rotom-W is unable to do any meaningful damage to Tangrowth outside of burning it. Poison Heal Breloom can use Rotom-W to set up Substitute. However, non-Poison Heal Breloom does not like switching into Will-O-Wisp, and Rotom-W can simply pivot on Breloom with Volt Switch regardless of its set.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Although it has to exercise caution while switching in, Garchomp can threaten to OHKO Rotom-W with Outrage after some minor chip damage. However, Garchomp dislikes tanking a Hydro Pump and being burnt by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Rotom-W's low HP stat and a lack of reliable recovery leave it heavily susceptible to being worn down by hazards. Will-O-Wisp from opposing Rotom-W is also a major threat, as it becomes a far less consistent check to the likes of Scizor, Feraligatr and Mamoswine.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Gastrodon is one of the best counters to Rotom-W, as it is immune to Volt Switch and does not mind getting burned, and can burn Rotom-W back with Scald. It can even afford to run Sticky Hold to deny Trick from Choice Scarf variants. Blissey takes little from anything Rotom-W can throw at it and can either use it as set up fodder with Calm Mind or wear it down with Seismic Toss. However, Blissey is absolutely crippled by Trick.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Hydro Pump is used to hit Ground-types like Garchomp, Gliscor, and Mamoswine that attempt to block Volt Switch. Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-W cripple physical attackers like Azumarill, Feraligatr, and Scizor. Thunder Wave debilitates Pokemon that rely on their high Speed like Weavile and Alakazam, making them easier to revenge kill. Protect can be used to scout Choice item users like Azumarill while also being able to rack up extra Will-O-Wisp damage and gain more recovery from Leftovers. Alternatively, Discharge can be used for a second Electric STAB that has a nasty 30% paralysis rate, and a higher base power that allows it to KO threats like Belly Drum Azumarill. However, it indirectly inhibits Will-O-Wisp, as if Discharge paralyzes a strong physical attacker like Scizor or Tyranitar, it can prove to be a liability. Both Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave can be run at the same time to give Rotom-W more flexibility in terms of spreading status, but this is not generally recommended. 8 Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt.</p> <p>This set fits on bulky offense and balance teams where it acts as a slow pivot, safely bringing in strong offensive teammates while checking Heatran, Mamoswine, and Feraligatr. Heatran is a good partner, dealing with Pokemon that check Rotom-W like Tangrowth and Clefable while also providing Stealth Rock support. In return, Heatran appreciates Rotom-W's ability to beat Water- and Ground-types like Slowbro, Mamoswine, and Gliscor. Scizor can check Latios and Latias while appreciating Rotom-W checking Heatran and forming a VoltTurn core. Strong offensive Pokemon like Alakazam, Breloom, and Garchomp are able to take advantage of the offensive momentum Rotom-W generates while also appreciating Rotom-W's ability to chip foes, softening them up for the late-game.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Rotom-W reliably revenge kills Azumarill and Crawdaunt and outspeeds and threatens common threats like Feraligatr and Weavile. Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to gain momentum while bringing in teammates safely. Hydro Pump is effective at thwarting Ground-types that are immune to Volt Switch such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Mamoswine while also threatening Pokemon such as Tyranitar. Trick cripples passive walls such as Clefable, Tangrowth, and Blissey. It also greatly annoys setup sweepers like Garchomp and Breloom. Will-O-Wisp is an option that lets Rotom-W cripple Garchomp, Scizor, Weavile, and Feraligatr while also threatening Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Tyranitar. Nasty Plot allows Rotom-W to become a potent wallbreaker after it sheds its Choice Scarf due to its good bulk making it difficult to revenge kill and good STAB coverage.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-W best fits on offense, bulky offense, and balance teams that appreciate its role compression as a Ground-immune offensive pivot and revenge killer that can maintain momentum. Scizor is an excellent teammate since it makes an excellent VoltTurn core with Rotom-W and it checks strong special attackers like Alakazam, which would otherwise overwhelm and force Rotom-W out. Gliscor is another great partner, as it also creates a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W and provides Stealth Rock and Knock Off support to allow Rotom-W to better wear down Blissey. In return, Rotom-W checks Water- and Ice-types like Feraligatr, Azumarill, Weavile, and Mamoswine for Scizor and Gliscor. Heatran is another excellent partner, as it checks Pokemon that can force out Rotom-W, such as Tangrowth and Latios, while also providing Stealth Rock support. In return, Rotom-W is able to come in on Ground-types such as Garchomp and Mamoswine. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Gliscor and Starmie is great for Rotom-W, as it increases Rotom-W's longevity. Since Choice Scarf Rotom-W is unable to consistently check Water-types like Azumarill and Feraligatr, additional checks to them such as Tangrowth and Shaymin are appreciated.</p> "
