Not all goes swimmingly for Kyogre, however; VGC 2022's abundance of viable Electric-types in Regieleki, Thundurus, and Zapdos and Kyogre's centralizing nature means it has a large target on its back at all times. Grass-types like Venusaur, Amoonguss, Rillaboom, and Ferrothorn can also sponge its Water- and Electric-type attacks and threaten it back.</p> <p>For Kyogre users looking to avoid these pitfalls, pair it with Grass- and Ground- types like Amoonguss, Landorus-T, and Venusaur, which works well even when not used alongside Groudon, to help check the Electric-types. Teammates like Incineroar, Zapdos, and Tornadus can help put pressure on Grass-type foes. Kyogre's damage output is severely limited by damage reduction like Light Screen and Snarl, as well as ways to override rain like Groudon's Drought or Calyrex-I's Max Hailstorm. Kyogre can reverse these overrides with Max Geyser to reset its rain, however.

Weakness Policy punishes Electric- and Grass-type attacks looking to beat down Kyogre by sharply raising its Special Attack, giving it the ability to OHKO the likes of Dynamax Venusaur and Thundurus in retaliation. Scald can be used in place of Origin Pulse for perfect accuracy and the chance to burn, but deals considerably less damage overall.

When it comes to supporting Kyogre, it and Whimsicott are effectively as good as each other, but there are a few reasons why one would use Tornadus for this role over Whimsicott, the first being its stronger offensive presence. Tornadus's Hurricane is perfectly accurate when paired with Kyogre's rain, and it's able to pressure Grass-types like Rillaboom, Venusaur, and Kartana, which Whimsicott fails to do. Tornadus can also act as a Dynamax user in desperate situations and fire off powerful Max Airstreams to continue boosting its Speed. Icy Wind is another vital tool in the Speed race; it can slow down foes and potentially allow Tornadus to delay using Tailwind by a turn, which can make all the difference in fast-paced Tailwindversus Tailwind matchups. Protect and Focus Sash are both chosen to help Tornadus's longevity, as the more moves it can use to gain a Speed advantage for its team, the better.

These attributes make Thundurus a phenomenal pairing alongside the metagame's best Restricted Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Calyrex-S. However, Defiant Thundurus isn't very strong, and it can struggle against teams with dual screens Grimmsnarl and bulky Pokemon like Gastrodon, Groudon, and Zacian-C. Moreover, Defiant Thundurus's reliance on Dynamax can make it difficult to justify bringing alongside other Pokemon reliant on Dynamaxing. Thundurus can also run an support set with valuable Prankster speed control and Eerie Impulse to severely hinder common special attackers like Kyogre, Zapdos, and Calyrex-S. Support Thundurus weakening many special attackers makes it pair well with a variety of Pokemon; Kyogre appreciates Thundurus weakening Venusaur and Regieleki, and Zacian-C and Groudon appreciate Kyogre and Zapdos being weakened. However, Prankster Thundurus faces tough competition from Prankster Grimmsnarl, which can help defend against both physical and special attackers with Prankster dual screens.

    "overview": "<p>Calyrex-I is the strongest Ice-type in VGC 2022, boasting massive Attack and respectably solid bulk, which makes it an offensive juggernaut that's quite difficult to remove quickly. As One, its ability, has two great applications: shutting off resistance Berries like Yache Berry and Shuca Berry, ensuring it can't be stopped from picking up crucial KOs, and allowing it to quickly snowball through teams after a KO, something it can especially take advantage of with its signature spread move, Glacial Lance. Its high number of weaknesses makes it a great holder of Weakness Policy, though on the other hand, its pitiful two resistances combined with those six weaknesses greatly cut into its great natural bulk. Base 50 Speed is also incredibly slow, the slowest of any viable Restricted Pokemon in VGC 2022, which makes it reliant on Trick Room support from the likes of Mimikyu or Porygon2 to maximize its offensive capabilities. Additionally, Incineroar can give it a particularly rough time, switching into Glacial Lance and lowering its Attack with Intimidate.</p> ",

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Glacial Lance is a very safe move for Calyrex-I to use repeatedly, as most teams do not have many Pokemon resistant to Ice. Max Hailstorm is a useful way for Calyrex-I to disrupt opposing weather such as Groudon's sun or Kyogre's rain.</p> </li> <li> <p>High Horsepower complements Glacial Lance very well, hitting the likes of Incineroar, Zacian-C, and Solgaleo. When Dynamaxed, Calyrex-I can OHKO most Incineroar with Max Quake if it didn't take an Intimidate Attack drop. The Special Defense boosts Max Quake accumulates are also very helpful for taking on strong special attackers like Kyogre and Regieleki.</p> </li> <li> <p>While Calyrex-I is typically paired with a Trick Room-setting ally like Mimikyu or Porygon2, it is also an effective user of Trick Room itself thanks to its excellent bulk. It particularly thrives at getting late-game Trick Room up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Weakness Policy pairs well with partners like Mimikyu and Dusclops, which can quickly activate it by hitting Calyrex-I with Shadow Sneak. The Attack boost counteracts Incineroar's Intimidate drops or achieves certain OHKOs, like Max Hailstorm OHKOing Charizard and Yveltal while they're Gigantamaxed or Dynamaxed. White Herb negates an Intimidate drop from Incineroar, which is often used to slow down Calyrex-I's onslaughts during Trick Room. Babiri Berry is primarily used to survive a +1 Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs is theoretically best for a Trick Room sweeper, though an Adamant nature with 31 Speed IVs is fine as well, since it will still underspeed neutral-nature Incineroar and attack it in Trick Room before being hit with Parting Shot.</p> </li> </ul> "
