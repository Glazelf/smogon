  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Venusaur's Ability in Chlorophyll, great coverage, and access to powerful residual damage with G-Max Vine Lash make it a top non-Restricted Pokemon in the VGC 2022 metagame. Venusaur also has access to fast Sleep Powder which can shut down much of the metagame. Groudon is commonly its partner in crime as its Drought sets sun activating Venusaur's Chlorophyll. Groudon also patches up Venusaur's Fire-type weakness against Pokemon such as Incineroar and Rotom-H, and Venusaur, in turn, checks Water-types such as Kyogre and Tapu Fini. However, Groudon and Venusaur share common weaknesses to Pokemon such as Kyurem-W and Calyrex-I, so Zacian-C is a good partner to check these Pokemon better.</p> ",

When Dynamaxed, it becomes G-Max Vine Lash, which puts on even bigger pressure with its residual damage, able to finish off weakened opponents or Pokemon that rely on Focus Sash. Frenzy Plant provides a stronger G-Max Vine Lash with the downside of being less flexible outside of Dynamax.</p> </li> <li> <p>Weather Ball is used in conjunction with Groudon or Torkoal's Drought, becoming a powerful coverage move against opposing Steel-types. It turns into Max Flare under Dynamax, allowing Venusaur to OHKO Zacian-C with Life Orb and hit opposing Venusaur extremely hard.</p> </li> <li> <p>Earth Power is used to hit Incineroar and Zacian-C super effectively without relying on Weather Ball for the latter. It turns into Max Quake under Dynamax and boosts Venusaur's and its ally's Special Defense, letting it better take on strong special attackers such as Dialga and Palkia. Sludge Bomb hits Grimmsnarl and boosts Venusaur's Special Attack under Dynamax via Max Ooze.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sleep Powder is used to nullify threats and can potentially give Venusaur the upper hand in unfavorable matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Modest nature is preferred because Venusaur does not need to outpace Regieleki under sun; however, a Timid nature can be used to grant it this luxury.</p> </li> <li> <p>With Life Orb, Venusaur can severely dent opposing teams with G-Max Vine Lash. The boost also allows it to OHKO Zacian-C with Max Flare and 2HKO Assault Vest Incineroar with Max Quake. Coba Berry protects Venusaur from the metagame's various Max Airstream users such as Landorus-T and Yveltal. Focus Sash allows Venusaur to survive one hit from Pokemon like Calyrex-S and Kyurem-W, letting it support teammates such as Groudon and Charizard with Sleep Powder when it doesn't want to Dynamax.</p> </li> </ul> "

  "Zacian-Crowned": {
    "overview": "<p>Zacian-C is arguably VGC 2022's best Restricted Pokemon due to its high Speed, allowing it to outpace the entire metagame outside of Calyrex-S and Regieleki, its sky-high offensive presence, and Behemoth Blade, which allows it to check or outright OHKO many of the metagame's top Dynamax options such as Venusaur and Calyrex-I. Its Speed and immediate power make Zacian-C great at cleaning up weakened teams and pair well offensively with other Restricted Pokemon such as Palkia, Kyogre, Groudon, and Calyrex-S. Zacian-C does struggle against some of the format's common threats such as Groudon, Kyogre, and, most importantly, Incineroar; however, it often takes fairly minimal support for Zacian-C's few checks to be handled. For example, Defiant Thundurus checks Kyogre and benefits from Landorus-T's and Incineroar's Intimidate. Groudon and Kyogre are good restricted partners for Zacian-C, as the former checks Incineroar, Thundurus, and Regieleki and offers additional support against Kyogre with Drought, while the latter checks common Zacian-C answers like Incineroar and Landorus-T.</p> ",

Running three attacks with Fighting coverage over Substitute is viable; however, Substitute is generally more valuable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Zacian-C can afford to invest in its bulk without compromising its sweeping capabilities too much, and it gains benefits such as living Modest Life Orb Venusaur's Max Quake and -1 Life Orb Calyrex-I's Max Quake. Moreover, bulk investment is especially good alongside common damage mitigation tactics such as dual screens Grimmsnarl and Intimidate Incineroar. 236 HP investment gives Zacian-C an optimal number for Substitute. This being said, Zacian-C's EV spread is extremely flexible, as it can also viably run maximum Speed and Attack investment with a Jolly nature, especially on hyper offense teams where its bulk is less valuable.</p> </li> </ul> "
