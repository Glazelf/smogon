    "overview": "<p>Venusaur's Ability in Chlorophyll, great coverage, and access to powerful residual damage with G-Max Vine Lash make it a top non-Restricted Pokemon in the VGC 2022 metagame. Venusaur also has access to fast Sleep Powder which can shut down much of the metagame. Groudon is commonly its partner in crime as its Drought sets sun activating Venusaur's Chlorophyll. Groudon also patches up Venusaur's Fire-type weakness against Pokemon such as Incineroar and Rotom-H, and Venusaur, in turn, checks Water-types such as Kyogre and Tapu Fini. However, Groudon and Venusaur share common weaknesses to Pokemon such as Kyurem-W and Calyrex-I, so Zacian-C is a good partner to check these Pokemon better.</p> ",

When Dynamaxed, it becomes G-Max Vine Lash, which puts on even bigger pressure with its residual damage, able to finish off weakened opponents or Pokemon that rely on Focus Sash. Frenzy Plant provides a stronger G-Max Vine Lash with the downside of being less flexible outside of Dynamax.</p> </li> <li> <p>Weather Ball is used in conjunction with Groudon or Torkoal's Drought, becoming a powerful coverage move against opposing Steel-types. It turns into Max Flare under Dynamax, allowing Venusaur to OHKO Zacian-C with Life Orb and hit opposing Venusaur extremely hard.</p> </li> <li> <p>Earth Power is used to hit Incineroar and Zacian-C super effectively without relying on Weather Ball for the latter. It turns into Max Quake under Dynamax and boosts Venusaur's and its ally's Special Defense, letting it better take on strong special attackers such as Dialga and Palkia. Sludge Bomb hits Grimmsnarl and boosts Venusaur's Special Attack under Dynamax via Max Ooze.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sleep Powder is used to nullify threats and can potentially give Venusaur the upper hand in unfavorable matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Modest nature is preferred because Venusaur does not need to outpace Regieleki under sun; however, a Timid nature can be used to grant it this luxury.</p> </li> <li> <p>With Life Orb, Venusaur can severely dent opposing teams with G-Max Vine Lash. The boost also allows it to OHKO Zacian-C with Max Flare and 2HKO Assault Vest Incineroar with Max Quake. Coba Berry protects Venusaur from the metagame's various Max Airstream users such as Landorus-T and Yveltal. Focus Sash allows Venusaur to survive one hit from Pokemon like Calyrex-S and Kyurem-W, letting it support teammates such as Groudon and Charizard with Sleep Powder when it doesn't want to Dynamax.</p> </li> </ul> "

  "Kyogre": {
    "overview": "<p>Kyogre is one of the most devastating Restricted Pokemon available in VGC 2022 thanks to its high Special Attack, supported by Drizzle boosting its Water-type moves, superb natural bulk, and access to two powerful spread moves in Water Spout and Origin Pulse. It has naturally strong matchups into the majority of the metagame, with standouts including Incineroar, Zacian-C, Landorus-T, and Groudon. Its base 90 Speed also leaves it in a wonderful spot, as Kyogre can operate under almost any speed control, with faster sets working well under Tailwind and Max Airstream support from Tornadus, Thundurus, and Zapdos, while slower, bulkier sets thrive under Trick Room from Calyrex-I, Mimikyu, and Porygon2. Not all goes swimmingly for Kyogre, however; VGC 2022's abundance of viable Electric-types in Regieleki, Thundurus, and Zapdos and Kyogre's centralizing nature means it has a large target on its back at all times. Grass-types like Venusaur, Amoonguss, Rillaboom, and Ferrothorn can also sponge its Water- and Electric-type attacks and threaten it back.</p> <p>For Kyogre users looking to avoid these pitfalls, pair it with Grass- and Ground- types like Amoonguss, Landorus-T, and Venusaur, which works well even when not used alongside Groudon, to help check the Electric-types. Teammates like Incineroar, Zapdos, and Tornadus can help put pressure on Grass-type foes. Kyogre's damage output is severely limited by damage reduction like Light Screen and Snarl, as well as ways to override rain like Groudon's Drought or Calyrex-I's Max Hailstorm. Kyogre can reverse these overrides with Max Geyser to reset its rain, however. Pokemon like Palkia, Lapras, and Gastrodon can completely wall Kyogre; to muscle past these, Kyogre should look to teammates like Play Rough Zacian-C, Regieleki, or Energy Ball Amoonguss.</p> ",

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>When Kyogre is at full HP, it should be using Water Spout in almost all cases, as the devastatingly strong and perfectly accurate attack is capable of OHKOing Zacian-C and Calyrex-S with ease at full power. Water Spout also serves as the base for Kyogre's Max Geyser, a powerful single target attack not reliant on its HP. Origin Pulse makes for a suitable alternate Water attack, as it also offers strong spread damage, though its shaky accuracy can be worrying.</p> </li> <li> <p>Thunder lets Kyogre hit opposing Water-types like Lapras, Blastoise, and other Kyogre for super effective damage. It can also use Max Lightning, which sets Electric Terrain, powering up subsequent Electric attacks and keeping it safe from Amoonguss's Spore. Ice Beam allows it to hit Grass-types for super effective damage as well as Palkia, Dialga, and Kyurem-W neutrally, though Max Hailstorm's effect of replacing rain with hail isn't nearly as useful in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mystic Water is Kyogre's best boosting item, since, unlike Choice Specs, it allows Kyogre to change moves and, unlike Life Orb, it doesn't drain any of its HP, crucial for keeping its Water Spout consistently strong. However, Life Orb makes Kyogre a monumental threat when Dynamaxed, giving it the strongest possible Max Geyser and boosting its other moves as well.</p> </li> </ul> "

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T stands out as VGC 2022's best non-Restricted Ground-type attacker, an important role in a metagame dominated by Incineroar, Zacian-C, Regieleki, and many more Pokemon weak to Ground. Intimidate and Fly, for Max Airstream, are both great for its utility. These tools make it a popular check to Groudon and Venusaur cores, as it can hit Venusaur hard and stand up well to almost anything Groudon can throw at it. If it can successfully set up a Swords Dance, it can also sweep entire teams with a well-timed Dynamax. However, Landorus-T is very, very reliant on Dynamax to get much accomplished, as Fly is nearly useless on its own, and Earthquake and Rock Slide are relatively weak without several Attack boosts, so plan accordingly and be careful when bringing Landorus-T with another Pokemon reliant on Dynamax. Landorus-T also struggles against the metagame's numerous Water- and Ice-types like Kyogre, Kyurem-W, Calyrex-I, and Lapras, which can OHKO it even whileit's Dynamaxed. Therefore, partners like Zacian-C and Regieleki are vital to ensuring it can sweep effectively.</p> ",

Life Orb grants Landorus-T high immediate power; however, the damage output can drastically suffer when playing against double Intimidate cores. Lum Berry acts as a powerful safety net against Spore from Amoonguss, Sleep Powder from Venusaur, and Burning Jealousy from Incineroar and Torkoal, but it is weaker versus Intimidate and doesn't offer a power boost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Landorus-T needs a Jolly nature to outrun Calyrex-S and Zacian-C after a Max Airstream boost.</p> </li> </ul> "
