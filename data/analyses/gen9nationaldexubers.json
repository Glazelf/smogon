        "description": "<ul> <li>Ho-Oh shines as an entry hazard control option that can cripple and scout a sizable portion of the metagame with little risk while also keeping itself healthy with Regenerator. Its Fire / Flying typing and solid mixed bulk enable it to come into a variety of foes such as Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fairy, and Mega Salamence. Its typing specifically grants it an immunity to burns from the likes of Giratina-O and Arceus-Dark and Toxic Spikes from Eternatus.</li> <li>Sacred Fire acts as a solid STAB option that also lets Ho-Oh apply pressure on Steel-types—which are immune to Toxic—like Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C while also potentially crippling foes with a burn, rendering it difficult to switch into.</li> <li>Toxic allows Ho-Oh to cripple switch-ins such as Zygarde, Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Giratina-O, opposing Ho-Oh, and support Arceus formes without Refresh.</li> <li>Whirlwind provides a phazing option to disrupt setup sweepers such as Necrozma-DM and Zygarde.</li> <li>The physical bulk avoids an OHKO from Zacian-C's Wild Charge at +2 Attack, and it also allows Ho-Oh to more comfortably handle foes such as Necrozma-DM, Mega Salamence, and physically offensive Arceus formes.</li> <li>Tera Grass helps against foes such as Marshadow, Arceus-Ground, and especially Zygarde, as Zygarde's Thousand Arrows hits the entire metagame for neutral or super effective damage otherwise. Tera Grass also makes it a good check for Water-types such as Palkia-O, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Tera Ground gives Ho-Oh the option to outplay foes that try to hit it with super effective Rock- and Electric-type coverage like Marshadow and Flutter Mane and also eases the matchup against Eternatus and Zekrom.</li> <li>Tera Dark provides Ho-Oh with the capability to easily check Psychic-, Dark-, and Ghost-types like Mega Mewtwo Y, Ultra Necrozma, Yveltal, and Lunala. With it, Ho-Oh can also ignore Taunt from Grimmsnarl, allowing it to remove dual screens with Defog.</li> <li>By Terastallizing, Ho-Oh minds Stealth Rock significantly less, which can be crucial if it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots, with Tera Ground in particular giving the most longevity via resisting the Rock-type. However, it also becomes vulnerable to other entry hazards such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</li> <li>Ho-Oh's utility and defensive traits let it fit well on balance and more defensive team structures that appreciate a hazard control option, pivot, and phazer.</li> <li>Avoid keeping Ho-Oh on targets that can use Knock Off to remove its Heavy-Duty Boots. Otherwise, Ho-Oh will be forced to either compromise its longevity and utility or Terastallize.</li> <li>Ho-Oh should be preserved at good health if the other team has strong threats that it's meant to check, such as Arceus-Ground and Zygarde. When handling setup sweepers, it's more consistently reliable for Ho-Oh to use Whirlwind than to inflict a burn with Sacred Fire. However, this strategy shouldn't be relied on too much late-game, as Whirlwind fails when only a single foe remains.</li> <li>As it's tasked with answering many different threats, Ho-Oh can get overwhelmed if heavily relied on. Therefore, Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Poison, and Necrozma-DM help Ho-Oh as secondary answers to foes such as Zacian-C.</li> <li>Pokemon such as Marshadow, Zacian-C, Eternatus, and Primal Groudon often run super effective coverage that can KO Ho-Oh; as such, it appreciates allies that can come into them, which include Giratina-O, Arceus-Ground, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Ho-Oh appreciates hazard setters because Sacred Fire, Toxic, and Whirlwind can force a lot of switches and thus deal massive amounts of chip damage, so Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Eternatus are great allies in this regard.</li> </ul>"

Therefore, Pokemon that Primal Groudon struggles against, like Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground, are appreciated as teammates.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre also has average physical bulk and is threatened by strong physical attackers like Marshadow and Zacian-C. Therefore, defensive checks like Yveltal, Zygarde-C, and Ho-Oh are also beneficial as teammates. Yveltal and Ho-Oh can also remove entry hazards, a big obstacle for Primal Kyogre.</li> </ul>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Defensive Primal Kyogre is an oppressive force against bulkier teams, as it is able to shrug off weak attacks and passive damage that significantly hinder wallbreaker sets. Additionally, its base 180 Special Attack in conjunction with Scald and Ice Beam enables Primal Kyogre to trade with many offensive threats such as Arceus-Ground and Mega Salamence, even without offensive investment. These traits make Primal Kyogre an essential component of the defensive backbone on many balance teams.</li> <li>Aside from powering up Primal Kyogre's attacks, Calm Mind enables Primal Kyogre to turn the tables on some switch-ins that typically check wallbreaker sets, such as Eternatus, Ferrothorn, and Ditto, by turning them into setup fodder. It can also be used to gain a free boost on Primal Groudon that switches in to sacrifice itself to entry hazards and reset the weather.</li> <li>Sleep Talk can be used instead of Calm Mind to alleviate some of Primal Kyogre's issues against offensive teams where it would otherwise be unable to use Rest. However, this does come at the cost of diminished utility against defensive teams, as Primal Kyogre is reliant on Calm Mind to break through Pokemon such as Giratina and Chansey.</li> <li>Scald is Primal Kyogre's STAB move of choice due to its higher PP, accuracy, and ability to hinder physical attackers such as Arceus and Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Ice Beam provides Primal Kyogre the ability to hit Primal Groudon, which is its primary switch-in on most teams. While it only 4HKOes Primal Groudon, it will be quickly worn down due to its vulnerability to all entry hazards and its lack of reliable recovery. Furthermore, Ice Beam prevents Primal Kyogre from being set up on by the many threatening Dragon-types of the tier, such as Ultra Necrozma, Eternatus, and Mega Salamence. Ice Beam also plays a role in enabling Primal Kyogre to function as a wincon against stall teams, as it would otherwise run out of Scald PP.</li> <li>Rest is primarily used against bulkier balance and stall teams to help accumulate Calm Mind boosts, as most of the Pokemon found on these teams cannot meaningfully damage it. Rest generally should not used against more offensive teams, as the two free turns are highly exploitable and will likely be leveraged by Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Xerneas, and Arceus to boost into a range where they are able to sweep. As such, Primal Kyogre is better off attempting to trade with or weaken a Pokemon on more offensive teams.</li> <li>This EV spread allows Primal Kyogre to survive some very powerful attacks that one would assume would knock it out. For example, Primal Kyogre is 2HKOed by +1 Mega Salamence's Double Edge and +1 Zacian-C's Wild Charge and 3HKOed by uninvested Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades. Additionally, unboosted Primal Kyogre is 3HKOed by Xerneas's Moonblast before Geomancy and Life Orb Yveltal's Dark Pulse with this EV spread.</li> <li>Defensive Primal Kyogre generally should not be used early-game, though it can be used as a lead against hyper offense teams, as Scald provides the chance to OHKO dedicated leads such as Shuckle, Smeargle, and Glimmora due to its burn chance, preventing them from setting multiple entry hazards. Primal Kyogre generally struggles against more offensive structures due to its limited hit-taking capabilities and often trades against a singular Pokemon at best. Defensive Primal Kyogre usually finds its first entry point mid-game, and it can use Ice Beam to heavily chip Primal Groudon that switches in for the benefit of teammates such as Xerneas and Zacian-C. Against balance teams, Primal Kyogre plays a critical role in dismantling or weakening the defensive backbone of the opposing team to allow more offensively inclined teammates such as Power Herb Eternatus and Arceus-Ground to sweep.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre has the tendency to be overwhelmed by powerful attackers, especially Swords Dance Primal Groudon, which capitalizes on the free turn where Primal Kyogre is forced out. Zygarde, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Dark can check powerful physical attackers while also appreciating Primal Kyogre's ability to deal with Ho-Oh especially since Zygarde specifically can be frustrated by Ho-Oh's phazing. Additionally, due to Primal Kyogre's middling matchup into offensive structures, Marshadow and Ditto make good teammates due to their ability to revenge kill many of the most threatening Pokemon found on these structures, such as Ultra Necrozma and Zacian-C.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre also appreciates both entry hazard support and removal, as both Primal Kyogre and Pokemon that threaten it are pushed into KO range with the presence of entry hazards. Consequently, Ho-Oh and defensive Primal Groudon with Overheat are excellent teammates. Ho-Oh is the best Defogger and defensive pivot in the tier and also phazes many Pokemon that may view Primal Kyogre as a setup opportunity, such as Xerneas and Zacian-C. Primal Groudon provides entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock or Spikes.</li> <li>Although Primal Kyogre will not sweep stall teams by itself, it requires little support to achieve a gamestate where it is able to do so. As in other matchups, Primal Kyogre generally does not have an early-game presence, as it relies on teammates such as Overheat Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh to set and remove entry hazards. Overheat Primal Groudon eases the burden on Primal Kyogre against stall teams, as it 2HKOes Dondozo, a staple on stall teams, after Stealth Rock. Additionally, Primal Kyogre requires some help against Confide Chansey. Consequently, Eternatus is an excellent teammate, as Pressure in conjunction with bulk allows it to absorb Confide and Seismic Toss, which allows Primal Kyogre to make progress.</li> </ul>"

Spikes is an option that deals more damage to Rock-resistant foes, like Arceus-Ground and Zygarde.</li> <li>Precipice Blade 2HKOes neutral targets like Primal Kyogre, and it has a solid chance to OHKO Eternatus as well as a small chance to OHKO opposing offensive Primal Groudon after one layer of Spikes.</li> <li>Rock Tomb hits Ho-Oh and Yveltal for super effective damage and is a great tool to cripple Speed-boosting foes like Mega Salamence, Ultra Necrozma, and Scale Shot and Dragon Dance Zygarde. Overheat is an option that hits neutral and Fire-weak targets like Arceus-Ground, Tera Grass Ho-Oh, and Ferrothorn for heavy damage.</li> <li>Toxic cripples common switch-ins to Primal Groudon such as Arceus-Ground, Zygarde, and Arceus-Dark and puts them on a timer. Roar can be used instead to phaze setup sweepers that would try to use Primal Groudon as setup fodder, like Dragon Dance and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, Dragon Dance and trapper Zygarde, and Mega Salamence. If entry hazards are up, it can also be used to rack up damage against the opposing team.</li> <li>The given EV spread lets Primal Groudon survive two Low Kick from Choice Band Marshadow as well as a +2 Earthquake from Adamant Necrozma-DM. A Careful nature can be run to survive two Modest Dynamax Cannon from Eternatus. A Sassy nature can be used for the same role if it's using Overheat, and it still outruns uninvested Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>This set fits best on bulky offensive teams that need a solid entry hazard setter that is not passive against common Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Yveltal.</li> <li>Tera Grass Ho-Oh can help Primal Groudon to deal with Primal Kyogre, which can be somewhat tricky for Primal Groudon to handle alone. Most of the time, trading HP against the opposing Primal Groudon is not wanted, so solid answers to it like Zygarde and Giratina-O are welcome additions. Good answers to Arceus-Ground are also recommended, such as defensive Primal Kyogre and the aforementioned Ho-Oh.</li> </ul>"

Heat Crash is an alternative that provides a perfectly accurate Desolate Land-boosted STAB option that hits certain foes harder than Precipice Blades, such as Ferrothorn, though running it leaves Primal Groudon unable to hit foes such as Giratina-O for neutral damage. However, most Fire-resistant Flying-types, like Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence, still take heavy damage from Heat Crash.</li> <li>The given EV spread maximizes Primal Groudon's Attack while providing just enough Speed to outspeed Choice Scarf Yveltal after using Rock Polish, with the rest being dumped into HP to increase its bulk.</li> <li>Primal Groudon best fits on offense teams looking for a powerful threat that can act as a sweeper or wallbreaker depending on the situation. Typically, it should use Swords Dance against defensive teams and Rock Polish against offensive teams. Primal Groudon's ability, typing, and bulk also let it check some foes in a pinch, like Primal Kyogre and Arceus.</li> <li>Entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S can help chip Primal Groudon's checks, such as Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground, into KO range. Grimmsnarl can provide dual screens support to help Primal Groudon set up, sometimes even allowing it to set up both Swords Dance and Rock Polish. Both of those teammates carry Taunt, which can stop the opposing team from setting up hazards, making it easier for Primal Groudon to set up.</li> <li>Offensive teammates such as Mega Salamence and Zacian-C can help Primal Groudon's team maintain offensive pressure, either by breaking holes for it or by taking advantage of the holes it makes.</li> <li>Certain physically bulky Ground-types, such as Arceus-Ground and Zygarde-C, can beat Primal Groudon one-on-one and sometimes even set up alongside it.

Second, it acts as a deterrent, dissuading these threats from setting up until Arceus-Dark has been sufficiently weakened.</li> <li>Toxic is the preferred status move for Arceus-Dark, primarily to cripple common switch-ins such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Fairy. Will-O-Wisp presents a viable alternative for hitting Zacian-C and Marshadow, which is particularly relevant given Zacian-C's resistance to Foul Play.</li> <li>Refresh is a solid choice when Arceus-Dark is utilized as a primary Knock Off and status absorber for the team, since it can reliably  switch into Toxic Yveltal or Eternatus. However, in other scenarios, it's not recommended since it would render Arceus-Dark too passive against the aforementioned threats.</li> <li>Taunt allows Arceus-Dark to greatly limit most of the entry hazard setters in the tier, namely Primal Groudon, Defensive Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn. Additionally, it can neutralize status spreaders like Toxic Yveltal, Ferrothorn, and Giratina-Origin, while also restricting the former's ability to use Defog. Taunt Arceus-Dark is also one of the best checks to Zygarde-C, as it can completely shut down its ability to spread paralysis and set up.</li> <li>Defog serves as a good filler move when Arceus-Dark acts as hazard control over common Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Giratina-O. Stealth Rock can be a viable option to free up teammates to fulfill other roles; for example, it alows Primal Groudon to run more offensive sets such as Swords Dance, or fit Spikes on defensive set. In addition, Arceus-Dark's typing and movepool allow it to set up Stealth Rock on common Defoggers such as Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and most opposing Arceus formes, all of which are threatened by Arceus-Dark's status moves. Arceus-Dark's EV spread enables it to be faster than common base 90 Speed foes and also facilitates its role as a revenge killer against offensive Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. Alternatively, investing in Speed with EVs of 248 HP / 164 Def / 96 Spe and a Timid nature allows Arceus-Dark to outspeed Pokémon like Yveltal, Zekrom, and Rayquaza, and still survive a Life Orb Low Kick from Marshadow.</li> <li>Tera Poison lets Arceus Dark acts as an emergency check to boosted Marshadow and Tera Fighting Zacian-C, making it possible to safely revenge kill them. Moreover, by becoming a Poison-type, Arceus-Dark becomes immune to Toxic, making it possible for non-Taunt versions to beat Toxic Yveltal one-on-one. However, Tera Poison makes Arceus-Dark extremely vulnerable to Photon Geyser Ultra Necrozma, Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Deoxys-A, thus trainers should think twice before Terastallizing Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Utility Arceus-Dark is an excellent fit for balance and defensive teams, offering a check to Zygarde-C and and other common physical sweepers such as Ultra Necrozma. Depending on the set used, some precautions should be taken with Arceus-Dark. Non-Refresh sets need to scout for Toxic before switching into Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Similarly, it is important to scout for Glare Zygarde since Arceus-Dark doesn't enjoy being paralyzed.</li> <li>Stealth Rock from Arceus-Dark itself or a teammate  like Primal Groudon can wear down Fairy-types such as Arceus-Fairy that can switch into Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Since Necrozma-DM, the premier Toxic absorber of the tier, is heavily threatened by Foul Play, Arceus-Dark can often freely use Toxic on a predicted switch-in.</li> <li>Primal Groudon and Swords Dance Arceus can overwhelm Arceus-Dark. To improve its matchup against these threats, teammates like Zygarde-C, Ferrothorn, and Ditto can provide valuable support.</li> <li>Defensive Primal Groudon serves as a great partner for Arceus-Dark, threatening Eternatus, which walls Arceus-Dark. A similar role is accomplished by Ho-Oh, especially sets carrying Thunder Wave, which can make Arceus-Dark faster than it. Additionally, Ho-Oh appreciates Arceus-Dark's ability to deal with Knock Off Necrozma-DM and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM is another partner that benefits from Arceus-Dark's ability to cripple Primal Groudon and Yveltal, and it provides a Fairy resistance and Toxic immunity in return.</li> <li>Cleric support from Pokemon such as Magearna and Chansey can mitigate non-Refresh Arceus-Dark's weakness to status conditions.</li> </ul>"

Primal Groudon is a good partner, as it is able to beat Pokemon like Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy that would be hard for Yveltal to break, while Yveltal can break through Giratina-O and Zygarde for Primal Groudon in return; Yveltal is also able to come in on the Ground-type moves that would threaten Primal Groudon, barring Thousand Arrows from Zygarde, while Primal Groudon comes in on the Fairy- and Electric-type moves that threaten Yveltal, such as Zacian-C's Play Rough and Primal Kyogre's Thunder. Ho-Oh can remove Stealth Rock for Yveltal, which improves its longevity. Necrozma-DM is able to handle Fairy- and Ice-types such as Calyrex-I and Arceus-Fairy, and Yveltal can come into the Ghost-, Dark-, and Ground-type moves that Necrozma-DM struggles with, such as Marshadow's Spectral Thief, opposing Yveltal's Dark Pulse, and Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades.</li> <li>Powerful physical sweepers such as Zacian-C, Mega Salamence, Arceus-Ground, and Ultra Necrozma appreciate Yveltal removing common physical walls such as Zygarde, Giratina, Primal Groudon, and Dondozo, while they handle the special walls such as Ho-Oh and Chansey in return; Zacian-C in particular can break through opposing Yveltal and Arceus-Dark with Play Rough, letting Yveltal spam Dark Pulse more easily.</li> <li>Hazard hyper offense teams using suicide leads such as Deoxys-S, Smeargle, Shuckle, and Glimmora appreciate Yveltal stopping Defog attempts from Ho-Oh, Giratina, and support Arceus formes with Taunt, as well as removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Ho-Oh, defensive Eternatus, and Giratina with Knock Off.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Necrozma-DM's incredible stats in both formes, excellent offensive movepool, and powerful boosting option in Dragon Dance make it one of NatDex Ubers's premier sweepers.</li> <li>Earthquake targets Steel-types such as opposing Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C and also hits Primal Groudon for super effective damage.</li> <li>Stone Edge OHKOes Ho-Oh, which can tank any of +1 Necrozma-DM's other moves except Light That Burns the Sky and either phaze it or use Sacred Fire to hit it pre-Ultra Burst for super effective damage and threaten both formes with a burn. Sunsteel Strike targets Fairy-types such as Arceus-Fairy, and it's especially powerful when it has STAB pre-Ultra Burst. Outrage is an alternative, offering Ultra Necrozma a powerful STAB attack that can hit Dark-types like Yveltal and Arceus-Dark for huge damage, but leaving Necrozma locked into the move makes it a niche option.</li> <li>Light That Burns the Sky provides +1 Ultra Necrozma with the means to OHKO foes such as offensive Arceus formes and defensive Ho-Oh, though Necrozma-DM cannot use it before or on the turn it Ultra Bursts.</li> <li>The given EV spread lets Ultra Necrozma always survive Choice Band Marshadow's Shadow Sneak from full HP. An Adamant nature provides Necrozma-DM with better damage ranges against foes such as Arceus formes, though Jolly lets Ultra Necrozma outspeed foes like offensive Arceus formes unboosted.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM best fits on offense teams looking for an exceptionally powerful sweeper that can set up on common offensive threats like Zacian-C.</li> <li>Choosing when to Ultra Burst is essential to letting Necrozma-DM sweep. Doing so provides Ultra Necrozma with the ability to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and many boosted threats when at +1, such as the likes of Zacian-C and +2 Rock Polish Primal-Groudon, foes a +1 Necrozma-DM fails to outspeed. However, Necrozma-DM's defensive profile becomes considerably worse when it Ultra Bursts, losing bulk, Prism Armor, and many of its resistances, notably exchanging its resistances to Fairy and Ice for weaknesses. However, the loss of its weaknesses to Fire and Ground, notably gaining a resistance to the former, does help Necrozma-DM better take on foes such as Primal Groudon. Gaining a resistance to Water also allows Ultra Necrozma to have an easier time handling Primal Kyogre. Additionally, the increase in Necrozma-DM's power, notably against foes weak to its moves thanks to Neuroforce, and access to Light That Burns the Sky make Ultra Necrozma a more potent wallbreaker.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM enjoys support from entry hazard setters like Deoxys-S, which can wear down foes such as Arceus-Dark and Primal Groudon. Dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl are notably helpful for allowing Necrozma-DM to set up very easily on common attackers like Zacian-C and Eternatus.</li> <li>Fellow wallbreaking and sweeping teammates such as Zacian-C and Arceus can help break holes in the opposing team for Necrozma-DM by eliminating or weakening foes such as Arceus-Dark and Ho-Oh, or they can sweep using the holes it creates breaking through bulky foes such as Primal Groudon and support Arceus formes.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM is a ferocious wallbreaker and cleaner that finds a home on bulky offense and balance teams. Necrozma-DM is able to leverage its bulk, typing, ability, and the possbility of bluffing the threat of Ultra Necrozma to force a switch or absorb an incoming attack such as Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades or Arceus-Dark's Foul Play and then use Dragon Dance.</li> <li>If Ho-Oh is sufficiently covered, Stone Edge can be substituted for Photon Geyser. This move still hits Ho-Oh hard while enabling Necrozma-DM to beat Dondozo, which would otherwise wall it. It has the added benefit of OHKOing Eternatus without the need to spend a turn stat boosting.</li> <li>Solganium Z allows Necrozma-DM to OHKO common switch-ins such as Arceus-Dark, Yveltal, and Zygarde with +1 Searing Sunraze Smash mid-game, clearing the way for its teammates.</li> <li>The extra bulk provided by 132 HP EVs allows Necrozma-DM to avoid OHKOs from some hits it otherwise wouldn't while still hitting important Speed benchmarks. For example, Necrozma-DM will survive Life Orb Marshadow's Poltergeist after Stealth Rock, defensive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades after a single layer of Spikes, and defensive Primal Kyogre's +1 Scald. With 124 Speed EVs, Necrozma-DM has the ability to outspeed uninvested base 90s with a neutral nature such as defensive Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. At +1 Necrozma-DM outspeeds fully invested Yveltal. At +2 Necrozma-DM outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame, only fearing priority moves such as Marshadow's Shadow Sneak or Yveltal's Sucker Punch.</li> <li>Alternatively, investing in 236 Speed EVs allows Necrozma-DM to outspeed fully invested base 120s at +1 such as Arceus-Ground and Mega Salamence. If Necrozma-DM uses Dragon Dance on the switch-in, it retains the ability to OHKO Mega Salamence with Searing Sunraze Smash with minimal chip after Intimidate removes Necrozma-DM's Attack boost.</li> <li>Due to a lack of recovery, Necrozma-DM needs to be cognisant of its HP, as any chip is permanent. Necrozma-DM frequently absorbs large hits while setting up or revenge killing certain threats, and taking chip may render it unable to do so. For example, Necrozma-DM always survives defensive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades after a layer of Spikes but can be OHKOed if Stealth Rock is also on the field.</li> <li>Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM should not be used to fulfill the defensive duties typically associated with Necrozma-DM such as switching into an unscouted Zacian-C, though it can revenge kill them. It excels when used as a secondary check to them, with teammates such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon serving as primary checks.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM struggles heavily against offensive Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and physical Arceus-Ground. Offensive Primal Groudon is able to OHKO Necrozma-DM with its STAB moves. Marshadow is always able to revenge kill Necrozma-DM with Shadow Sneak and OHKO it with Poltergeist. Physical Arceus-Ground OHKOes Necrozma-DM with Tectonic Rage and can threaten to sweep if given the opportunity to use Dragon Dance. Zygarde is an excellent teammate on balance teams that can switch into all three of these Pokemon and provides valuable paralysis support, which allows Necrozma-DM to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Giratina-O is a good teammate on bulky offense teams that can switch into Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground. Necrozma-DM also appreciates the Defog and status support provided by Giratina-O.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy provides a Dark switch-in on balance teams, which helps mitigate the downside of misfiring Searing Sunraze Smash into the wrong target. It is a good check to Life Orb Yveltal, which is otherwise very threatening to balance teams and can revenge kill Necrozma-DM with Sucker Punch. Arceus-Fairy can also provide Stealth Rock and status support in the form of Will-O-Wisp and Toxic to chip opposing Pokemon into range of Necrozma-DM's attacks such as Primal Groudon, Zacian-C, and Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul>"

This also means that Meteor Beam Eternatus will generally get a single opportunity to set up and make progress.</li> <li>Dynamax Cannon is the premier STAB move of choice for Eternatus, and it's preferred over Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse because despite its low PP, it has high Base Power and no drawbacks, and it also keeps key KOs. For example, after a Meteor Beam boost, Eternatus can 2HKO specially defensive Primal Groudon with Dynamax Cannon as well as 2HKO Primal Kyogre with the move after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb is important to remove Fairy-types like Arceus-Fairy, which can otherwise easily survive what Eternatus throws at them and use it as setup fodder. Spreading poison with this move is also useful to hinder some of its soft checks, like Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Ground, and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Flamethrower covers Steel-types like Necrozma-DM, which takes pitiful damage from Dynamax Cannon and Meteor Beam and can force Eternatus out by setting up with Dragon Dance or crippling it with Thunder Wave. Fire Blast can be used for its higher Base Power in order to take out defensive Necrozma-DM as well as Zacian-C at +1.</li> <li>A Timid nature is crucial in order to outrun unboosted Ultra Necrozma and certain threats like Arceus, Mega Salamence, and Marshadow. It also Speed ties with opposing offensive Eternatus.</li> <li>Tera Dragon further increases Dynamax Cannon's damage output, allowing Eternatus to menace key threats. For example, +1 Tera Dragon Dynamax Cannon can 2HKO Tera Water Zygarde-C and can OHKO it prior to Power Construct after a layer of Spikes. It also 2HKOes Ho-Oh and OHKOes Marshadow, and it additionally OHKOes defensive Arceus-Ground after a layer of Spikes.</li> <li>Tera Dragon also suppresses Eternatus's weaknesses associated with its Poison typing, letting Eternatus survive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades, Ultra Necrozma's Photon Geyser, and Arceus-Ground's Judgment.</li> <li>Tera Fire turns the tables against Zacian-C, allowing Eternatus to not only survive any hits from it but also OHKO Zacian-C with Fire Blast without a boost. Tera Fire Eternatus can also benefit from its new resistance to Fairy-type attacks to serve as a check in a pinch to other Fairy-types like Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Meteor Beam Eternatus fits best on offensive teams that are looking for a mid- to late-game wallbreaker and cleaner with sufficient Speed to outrun common threats to offensive teams like unboosted Ultra Necrozma and Xerneas. Cleaners like Double Dance Primal Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus as well as wallbreakers like offensive Calm Mind Primal Kyogre and Ultra Necrozma appreciate the support of Eternatus chipping their shared checks like Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O.</li> <li>Sticky Web support from teammates like Smeargle, Shuckle, and Ribombee further increases Eternatus's ability to threaten common anti-offense Pokemon like Dragon Dance Ultra Necrozma, allowing it to outrun and remove them.</li> </ul>"
