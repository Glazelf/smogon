        "description": "<ul> <li>Ho-Oh shines as an entry hazard control option that can cripple and scout a sizable portion of the metagame with little risk while also keeping itself healthy with Regenerator. Its Fire / Flying typing and solid mixed bulk enable it to come into a variety of foes such as Xerneas, Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fairy, and Mega Salamence. Its typing specifically grants it an immunity to burns from the likes of Giratina-O and Arceus-Dark and Toxic Spikes from Eternatus.</li> <li>Sacred Fire acts as a solid STAB option that also lets Ho-Oh apply pressure on Steel-types—which are immune to Toxic—like Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C while also potentially crippling foes with a burn, rendering it difficult to switch into.</li> <li>Toxic allows Ho-Oh to cripple switch-ins such as Zygarde, Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Giratina-O, opposing Ho-Oh, and support Arceus formes without Refresh.</li> <li>Whirlwind provides a phazing option to disrupt setup sweepers such as Necrozma-DM, Zygarde, and Xerneas.</li> <li>The given EV spread avoids an OHKO from Xerneas's Thunder after a Geomancy and maximizes physical bulk to avoid an OHKO from Zacian-C's Wild Charge at +2 Attack, and it also allows Ho-Oh to more comfortably handle foes such as Necrozma-DM, Mega Salamence, and physically offensive Arceus formes.</li> <li>Tera Grass gives Ho-Oh the option to consistently phaze Xerneas after a Geomancy independently of coverage by granting it a resistance to Electric-type moves and a neutrality to Rock-type moves for Hidden Power Rock variants. Such typing also helps against foes such as Marshadow, Arceus-Ground, and especially Zygarde, as Zygarde's Thousand Arrows hits the entire metagame for neutral or super effective damage otherwise. Tera Grass also makes it a good check for Water-types such as Palkia-O, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Tera Ground gives Ho-Oh the option to outplay foes that try to hit it with super effective Rock- and Electric-type coverage like Marshadow, Xerneas, and Flutter Mane and also eases the matchup against Eternatus and Zekrom.</li> <li>Tera Dark provides Ho-Oh with the capability to easily check Psychic-, Dark-, and Ghost-types like Mega Mewtwo Y, Ultra Necrozma, Yveltal, and Lunala. With it, Ho-Oh can also ignore Taunt from Grimmsnarl, allowing it to remove dual screens with Defog.</li> <li>By Terastallizing, Ho-Oh minds Stealth Rock significantly less, which can be crucial if it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots, with Tera Ground in particular giving the most longevity via resisting the Rock-type. However, it also becomes vulnerable to other entry hazards such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</li> <li>Ho-Oh's utility and defensive traits let it fit well on balance and more defensive team structures that appreciate a hazard control option, pivot, and phazer.</li> <li>Avoid keeping Ho-Oh on targets that can use Knock Off to remove its Heavy-Duty Boots. Otherwise, Ho-Oh will be forced to either compromise its longevity and utility or Terastallize.</li> <li>Ho-Oh should be preserved at good health if the other team has strong threats that it's meant to check, such as Xerneas. When handling setup sweepers, it's more consistently reliable for Ho-Oh to use Whirlwind than to inflict a burn with Sacred Fire. However, this strategy shouldn't be relied on too much late-game, as Whirlwind fails when only a single foe remains.</li> <li>As it's tasked with answering many different threats, Ho-Oh can get overwhelmed if heavily relied on. Therefore, Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Poison, and Necrozma-DM help Ho-Oh as secondary answers to foes such as Xerneas and Zacian-C.</li> <li>Pokemon such as Marshadow, Zacian-C, Eternatus, and Primal Groudon often run super effective coverage that can KO Ho-Oh; as such, it appreciates allies that can come into them, which include Giratina-O, Arceus-Ground, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Ho-Oh appreciates hazard setters because Sacred Fire, Toxic, and Whirlwind can force a lot of switches and thus deal massive amounts of chip damage, so Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Eternatus are great allies in this regard.</li> </ul>"

Heat Crash is an alternative that provides a perfectly accurate STAB option boosted by Desolate Land that hits certain foes harder than Precipice Blades, such as Ferrothorn and Xerneas, though running it leaves Primal Groudon unable to hit foes such as Giratina-O for neutral damage. However, most Fire-resistant Flying-types, like Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence, still take heavy damage from Heat Crash. *The given EV spread maximizes Primal Groudon's Attack while providing just enough Speed to outspeed Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal after using Rock Polish, with the rest being dumped into HP to increase its bulk.</li> <li>Primal Groudon best fits on offense teams looking for a powerful threat that can act as a sweeper or wallbreaker depending on the situation. Typically, it should use Swords Dance against defensive teams and Rock Polish against offensive teams. Primal Groudon's ability, typing, and bulk also let it check some foes in a pinch, like Primal Kyogre, Xerneas, and Arceus.</li> <li>Entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S can help chip Primal Groudon's checks, such as Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground, into KO range. Grimmsnarl can provide dual screens support to help Primal Groudon set up, sometimes even allowing it to set up both Swords Dance and Rock Polish. Both of those teammates carry Taunt, which can stop the opposing team from setting up hazards, making it easier for Primal Groudon to set up.</li> <li>Offensive teammates such as Mega Salamence and Zacian-C can help Primal Groudon's team maintain offensive pressure, either by breaking holes for it or by taking advantage of the holes it makes. *Certain physically bulky Ground-types, such as Arceus-Ground and Zygarde-C, can beat Primal Groudon one-on-one and sometimes even set up alongside it. Primal Kyogre is effective at handling these foes, while Flying-types like Yveltal and Mega Salamence can switch into them in a pinch.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Dark Pulse is Yveltal's main attacking option. With Dark Aura and a Life Orb, it allows Yveltal to 2HKO many of the tier's defensive options, such as Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Zygarde.</li> <li>Oblivion Wing has solid neutral coverage with Dark Pulse, being able to hit the Fairy-, Fighting-, and Dark-types that would switch into Dark Pulse, such as Xerneas, Arceus-Dark, and opposing Yveltal.</li> <li>Taunt shuts down opposing setup, such as Xerneas's Geomancy and Arceus's Swords Dance, entry hazards, such as Primal Groudon's Stealth Rock, and status moves, such as Ho-Oh's Toxic; when combined with Oblivion Wing, it allows Yveltal to win duels against many Pokemon that would otherwise be able to take on Yveltal's attacks, such as support Arceus formes and defensive Eternatus.</li> <li>Knock Off cripples Pokemon, such as Ho-Oh, Chansey and Xerneas, by removing their item, while Sucker Punch allows Yveltal to punish faster Pokemon such as Deoxys-A, Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Mewtwo Y, making it a solid revenge killer.</li> <li>Tera Dark boosts Dark Pulse's power to ridiculous feats, such as being able to 2HKO specially defensive Eternatus, defensive Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh, as well as boosting Sucker Punch and Knock Off's damage. Tera Flying can also be used to increase Oblivion Wing's power, letting it hit Arceus-Dark, opposing Yveltal, and Xerneas harder, which in return gives Yveltal more longevity.</li> <li>Yveltal should be used as an offensive check to Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and Necrozma-DM. Switching into resisted moves such as Marshadow's Spectral Thief and Lunala's Moongeist Beam or attacks Yveltal is immune to such as Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades and Ultra Necrozma's Photon Geyser allows Yveltal to stay healthy throughout a game, which is important, as Yveltal can get worn down from Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil. Oblivion Wing is best suited for use when Yveltal is at low HP, as it should mostly be using Dark Pulse for damage otherwise.</li> <li>Although much of the tier is 2HKOed by Yveltal, most of the metagame is able to 2HKO Yveltal as well, even with neutral moves, such as Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike and Eternatus's Dynamax Cannon.</li> <li>Yveltal should avoid status as much as possible; Toxic from Ho-Oh and Giratina-O ruins its longevity in longer games, paralysis from Zygarde's Glare and Necrozma-DM's Thunder Wave limits its Speed so it's more likely to be KOed by faster threats, and burns from Ho-Oh and Arceus-Dark weaken the strength of Knock Off and Sucker Punch, the latter being problematic against more offensive teams where priority may be necessary for revenge killing.</li> <li>Due to Xerneas not running maximum Speed on its Geomancy sets, it could be worth it for Yveltal to use Taunt to prevent it from setting up, but this is risky and should be only used as a last resort since Yveltal is OHKOed by Xerneas's Moonblast.</li> <li>Yveltal's immediate power allows it to be an early-game wallbreaker for its team, which is good for offensive structures.</li> <li>Specially offensive Yveltal fits best on offensive teams. Primal Groudon is a good partner, as it is able to beat Pokemon like Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy that would be hard for Yveltal to break, while Yveltal can break through Giratina-O and Zygarde for Primal Groudon in return; Yveltal is also able to come in on the Ground-type moves that would threaten Primal Groudon, barring Thousand Arrows from Zygarde, while Primal Groudon comes in on the Fairy- and Electric-type moves that threaten Yveltal, such as Xerneas's Moonblast and Primal Kyogre's Thunder. Ho-Oh can remove Stealth Rock for Yveltal, which improves its longevity, and it can also prevent Xerneas from sweeping as easily. Necrozma-DM is able to handle Fairy- and Ice-types such as Calyrex-I and Arceus-Fairy, and Yveltal can come into the Ghost-, Dark-, and Ground-type moves that Necrozma-DM struggles with, such as Marshadow's Spectral Thief, opposing Yveltal's Dark Pulse, and Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades.</li> <li>Powerful physical sweepers such as Zacian-C, Mega Salamence, Arceus-Ground, and Ultra Necrozma appreciate Yveltal removing common physical walls such as Zygarde, Giratina, Primal Groudon, and Dondozo, while they handle the special walls such as Ho-Oh and Chansey in return; Zacian-C in particular can break through opposing Yveltal and Arceus-Dark with Play Rough, letting Yveltal spam Dark Pulse more easily.</li> <li>Hazard hyper offense teams using suicide leads such as Deoxys-S, Smeargle, Shuckle, and Glimmora appreciate Yveltal stopping Defog attempts from Ho-Oh, Giratina, and support Arceus formes with Taunt, as well as removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Ho-Oh, defensive Eternatus, and Giratina with Knock Off.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM is a ferocious wallbreaker and cleaner that finds a home on bulky offense and balance teams. Necrozma-DM is able to leverage its bulk, typing, ability, and the possbility of bluffing the threat of Ultra Necrozma to force a switch or absorb an incoming attack such as Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades or Arceus-Dark's Foul Play and then use Dragon Dance.</li> <li>If Ho-Oh is sufficiently covered, Stone Edge can be substituted for Photon Geyser. This move still hits Ho-Oh hard while enabling Necrozma-DM to beat Dondozo, which would otherwise wall it. It has the added benefit of OHKOing Eternatus without the need to spend a turn stat boosting.</li> <li>Solganium Z allows Necrozma-DM to OHKO common switch-ins such as Arceus-Dark, Yveltal, and Zygarde with +1 Searing Sunraze Smash mid-game, clearing the way for its teammates.</li> <li>The extra bulk provided by 132 HP EVs allows Necrozma-DM to avoid OHKOs from some hits it otherwise wouldn't while still hitting important Speed benchmarks. For example, Necrozma-DM will survive Life Orb Marshadow's Poltergeist after Stealth Rock, defensive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades after a single layer of Spikes, and defensive Primal Kyogre's +1 Scald. With 124 Speed EVs, Necrozma-DM has the ability to outspeed uninvested base 90s with a neutral nature such as defensive Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. At +1 Necrozma-DM outspeeds fully invested Yveltal and Xerneas. At +2 Necrozma-DM outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame, only fearing priority moves such as Marshadow's Shadow Sneak or Yveltal's Sucker Punch.</li> <li>Alternatively, investing in 236 Speed EVs allows Necrozma-DM to outspeed fully invested base 120s at +1 such as Arceus-Ground and Mega Salamence. If Necrozma-DM uses Dragon Dance on the switch-in, it retains the ability to OHKO Mega Salamence with Searing Sunraze Smash with minimal chip after Intimidate removes Necrozma-DM's Attack boost.</li> <li>Due to a lack of recovery, Necrozma-DM needs to be cognisant of its HP, as any chip is permanent. Necrozma-DM frequently absorbs large hits while setting up or revenge killing certain threats, and taking chip may render it unable to do so. For example, Necrozma-DM always survives defensive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades after a layer of Spikes but can be OHKOed if Stealth Rock is also on the field.</li> <li>Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM should not be used to fulfill the defensive duties typically associated with Necrozma-DM such as switching into an unscouted Xerneas or Zacian-C, though it can revenge kill them. It excels when used as a secondary check to them, with teammates such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon serving as primary checks.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM struggles heavily against offensive Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and physical Arceus-Ground. Offensive Primal Groudon is able to OHKO Necrozma-DM with its STAB moves. Marshadow is always able to revenge kill Necrozma-DM with Shadow Sneak and OHKO it with Poltergeist. Physical Arceus-Ground OHKOes Necrozma-DM with Tectonic Rage and can threaten to sweep if given the opportunity to use Dragon Dance. Zygarde is an excellent teammate on balance teams that can switch into all three of these Pokemon and provides valuable paralysis support, which allows Necrozma-DM to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Giratina-O is a good teammate on bulky offense teams that can switch into Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground. Necrozma-DM also appreciates the Defog and status support provided by Giratina-O.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy provides a Dark switch-in on balance teams, which helps mitigate the downside of misfiring Searing Sunraze Smash into the wrong target. It is a good check to Life Orb Yveltal, which is otherwise very threatening to balance teams and can revenge kill Necrozma-DM with Sucker Punch. Arceus-Fairy can also provide Stealth Rock and status support in the form of Will-O-Wisp and Toxic to chip opposing Pokemon into range of Necrozma-DM's attacks such as Primal Groudon, Zacian-C, and Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul>"
