        "description": "<p>Ditto's one and only role in Ubers is to copy the opponent's Pokemon in order to function as the premier revenge killer in the metagame, able to steal the target's stat boosts on top of having a Speed boost from its Choice Scarf. It is undeniably one of the best Pokemon in the metagame for that very reason, as there are many Pokemon that can set up with ease, and Ditto is able to copy their boosts and beat most of them one-on-one. Ditto can also be useful against bulkier teams, as its PP refreshes every time it is switched out, so it can help in cases of PP wars. As Ditto is frail, you want it to be sent in safely versus offensive threats, so pairing it with the likes of Corviknight or other pivots can be a good idea. Although it is the best revenge killer the metagame has to offer, it still has its flaws in doing so against moves like Substitute and Imprison, as well as opposing Choice Scarf users and bulky setup sweepers. Also, keep in mind you cannot use Imposter on opposing Ditto that have already copied a Pokemon, and that Ditto negates the Speed reduction when it copies the opposing Pokemon while Sticky Webs are on your side.</p> "
