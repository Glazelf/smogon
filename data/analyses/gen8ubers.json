    "overview": "<p>Dugtrio's sole purpose in Ubers is trapping Eternatus. With Special Defense investment, Dugtrio is able to take a Dynamax Cannon even after Stealth Rock, meaning it can easily dispatch Eternatus after coming in with a smart double switch, on a teammate's U-turn, or when Eternatus is forced to recover. Reliably removing Eternatus lets strong sweepers and wallbreakers such as Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Marshadow wreak havoc. Additionally, your own Eternatus can increase the pressure of Toxic Spikes without opposing Eternatus to absorb it. Dugtrio's trapping ability also makes it generally useful for picking off weakened Pokemon, and it has some nifty utility options, such as Memento to give a party member a free turn to set up. However, Dugtrio is very weak and therefore struggles against more offensive builds, and it is generally outclassed by more powerful Choice Scarf users such as Calyrex-S and Galarian Darmanitan. It is extremely frail and relies on teammate support, double switches, and revenge killing to come on to the battlefield. As such, Dugtrio is an extremely niche pick that functions best on teams that are dedicated to sweeping once Eternatus is removed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Band can be used for greater power, and it makes targets such as Blissey and Cosmic Power Eternatus much easier to trap. However, the lessened Speed makes Dugtrio lose a lot of utility against offensive Pokemon, and it risks being outsped by its main target, Eternatus. Sucker Punch can be used for its priority, although it is generally not as useful as the moves listed above. The main target would be Choice Scarf Calyrex-S; however, as a Ghost-type, it cannot be trapped. Rock Slide can flinch and is more accurate than Stone Edge; however, Dugtrio generally needs all the power it can get.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Teams Without Eternatus: Dugtrio doesn't have a check in the traditional sense thanks to Arena Trap trapping foes. However, it is almost useless if there's no Eternatus for it to trap. Offensive teams in particular enjoy the opposing revenge killer being unable to significantly damage most of their sweepers.</p> <p><strong>Draco Meteor Eternatus</strong>: While rare, Eternatus that has Draco Meteor can OHKO Dugtrio. Dugtrio could still KO a weakened Eternatus or come in on one that has already used Draco Meteor, but Draco Meteor does severely limit its ability to trap Eternatus.</p> <p><strong>Cosmic Power Eternatus</strong>: If Eternatus has set up Cosmic Power, it will usually have the bulk to tank repeated Earthquakes from Dugtrio. However, Eternatus needs to make sure it has enough HP to do this. Also, if Eternatus is forced to use Recover by one of Dugtrio's teammates, it puts itself at risk of being trapped without being able to set up a Cosmic Power on the switch.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Earthquake always 2HKOes specially defensive Eternatus. Stone Edge hits Flying-type Pokemon like Yveltal and Ho-Oh for good damage and has good offensive synergy with Earthquake. Memento is a great move to allow a free turn of setup for one of Dugtrio's teammates. It can also be used in an emergency to stop a setup sweeper in its tracks. For the last moveslot, Toxic can be used to cripple a threat that Dugtrio can't do much damage to, such as Groudon or Zygarde. Beat Up is an interesting option to easily dispatch SubSeed Calyrex-S, which, while rare, can wreak havoc on an unprepared team. Stealth Rock can fit an entry hazard on teams that have a hard time fitting one. Locking into Stealth Rock is not a big concern thanks to Arena Trap preventing a setup sweeper from coming in. The given EVs allow Dugtrio to outspeed +1 positive nature base 90s, such as Zekrom, and always survive a Dynamax Cannon from an uninvested Eternatus after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Dugtrio needs teammates that thrive when Eternatus is gone. Kyogre is the most notable example, as Eternatus is the main answer to its powerful Water Spouts in the tier. Kyogre can significantly damage Eternatus on the switch, forcing it to either use Recover or attack; in either instance, Dugtrio can come in and KO Eternatus. A similar concept can be done with Pokemon such as Dracovish, Ho-Oh, and Marshadow. In general, hitting Eternatus with a strong attack to force it to use Recover is the best way to get Dugtrio on the field, as this prevents Cosmic Power sets setting up on Dugtrio switching in. Bulky teammates such as Buzzwole and Zarude provide nice defensive utility for your team, and both have the potential to sweep with Bulk Up once Eternatus has been eliminated. Toxic Spikes Eternatus makes for a fantastic partner, as the opposing team will have no way to absorb Toxic Spikes with their own Eternatus down. Additionally, Toxic Spikes can somewhat help with Dugtrio's weaknesses against offensive teams. Eternatus can also switch into Kyogre, which Dugtrio can attract. Dugtrio appreciates pivots to let it come into battle safely. U-turn users such as Yveltal and Corviknight and Teleport users such as Blissey can do this.</p> "

Knock Off users such as Yveltal especially like Spikes because they can remove Heavy-Duty Boots, which helps them sweep later on.

Ditto also has a minor niche of being able to PP stall some bulkier defensive threats like Blissey by repeatedly switching in, using a recovery move, and switching out.

However, Mewtwo is always forced out by Calyrex-S and offers very little defensively, which makes it hard to fit onto teams and bring in repeatedly throughout a game.

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stallbreaker Mewtwo with Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, Recover, and Psystrike or Ice Beam can be used, but it is difficult to justify a teamslot on when this set doesn't reliably answer any of the biggest threats in the metagame and freely lets in Calyrex-S. Taunt can be used on certain hyper offense teams that want to avoid letting Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Yveltal use Defog, but these structures tend to have a notable weakness to Calyrex-S already, and Mewtwo makes this weakness significantly worse. Thunder provides fantastic damage on Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and physically defensive Kyogre, but the inconsistency is frustrating, so it should only be used with Kyogre as a teammate. Focus Blast is an option that can hit Tyranitar and Heatran, which easily deal with Mewtwo otherwise, but doesn't hit anything else in the tier for meaningful damage that Fire Blast doesn't cover already. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for PP and accuracy reasons, but the difference in power is fairly noticeable, and Nasty Plot sets require Fire Blast for the roll to OHKO Necrozma-DM at +2.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Calyrex-S: Calyrex-S will always force out Mewtwo, and it is not something that any team appreciates giving free turns to.</p> <p><strong>Lunala</strong>: Lunala walls any Mewtwo lacking Shadow Ball and can recover easily while wearing it down through Life Orb recoil and potential Ghost-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Heatran and Tyranitar</strong>: Heatran and Tyranitar wall every move on the most common Mewtwo sets and only get beaten by the somewhat niche Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Defensive Ho-Oh can pivot into Mewtwo to rack up Life Orb recoil and threaten it with Thunder Wave, and it can easily deal with Expert Belt Mewtwo.

These three moves should be used on every offensive Mewtwo, but the fourth move is more customizable depending on what the rest of the team prefers. Nasty Plot turns Mewtwo into a terrifying sweeper that can OHKO most of the metagame with just the three coverage moves above, but it will still be forced out by common Pokemon like Calyrex-S and Marshadow. Shadow Ball lets Mewtwo dent Lunala for teammates like Groudon and Zekrom and prevents Calyrex-S from switching in on Mewtwo to force it out. Life Orb gives a much-needed power boost, allowing Mewtwo to run Timid to outspeed almost the entire metagame and at worst Speed tie with Eternatus. The recoil eats into Mewtwo’s already mediocre bulk, which limits its effectiveness in longer games, but Recover helps offset that if run. Expert Belt can be run over Life Orb, but the decrease in damage output means that Modest is the nature of choice to give favorable rolls against Pokemon like Necrozma-DM and Yveltal.

Because of Mewtwo’s weakness to opposing Calyrex-S, teammates that can check it like Yveltal, Zarude, and Ho-Oh are required, and having more than one Calyrex-S check is a good idea given how weak Mewtwo is to it. Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory are helpful, as Mewtwo can easily force switches to rack up residual damage, and both of them can come in and set Spikes easily on Necrozma-DM, which Mewtwo doesn't appreciate facing without being boosted already. Groudon both can set Stealth Rock and power up Mewtwo's Fire Blast via Drought, which really helps it threaten Necrozma-DM. Groudon can also help weaken Pokemon like Yveltal, as Yveltal is a fairly common form of counterplay to Groudon. Pokemon with pivoting moves that can bring Mewtwo in freely like U-turn Yveltal and Galarian Darmanitan are appreciated as partners, as Mewtwo struggles to come in by itself frequently.

    "overview": "<p>Lugia possesses some of the greatest bulk in the metagame backed up by one of the best defensive abilities in Multiscale. Its access to reliable recovery, a great Speed tier, and an extensive support movepool ensures that it can keep itself healthy with relative ease and effectively check various threats such as Zygarde, Groudon, and Rayquaza. Its walling capabilities, however, are entirely dependent on Multiscale, which makes Lugia very hard to utilize considering it must be kept at full health or else risk being taken down by the multitude of fast and strong wallbreakers in the metagame. Lugia also despises all status ailments and must avoid them at all costs, making cleric support with Lugia important and making it a natural fit on stall teams. While Heavy-Duty Boots is a godsend to rid Lugia of its weakness to Stealth Rock, it also means it lacks passive recovery and can't switch in on certain Pokemon it would otherwise beat, such as Landorus, in fear of Knock Off. Lugia's defensive typing also leaves much to be desired, giving it weaknesses to the extremely common Ghost- and Dark-type attacks. It also cannot deal with the best offensive and defensive threats in the metagame, being completely outclassed by Necrozma-DM and Lunala, both of which share Lugia's Psychic-type but have a much better secondary typing in Steel and Ghost, respectively. On more dedicated stall builds, Giratina is bulkier and can provide more for its team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Defog allows Lugia to remove entry hazards so that it can free up a moveslot for another teammate, but since Necrozma-DM, the best Stealth Rock setter in the metagame, doesn't really care about Lugia, it's not advised.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Yveltal: Yveltal can often outspeed Lugia and shut it down via Knock Off, Toxic, or Taunt. It doesn't want to switch in on a status move, however.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Calyrex-S can consistently 2HKO Lugia even through Multiscale, takes little damage from Ice Beam, and can cure itself of status with Aromatherapy. Marshadow can break through Lugia's defenses as well. Giratina can status Lugia with either Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, while Giratina-O can opt for a strong Ghost-type STAB move to deal a ton of damage.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM: Necrozma-DM can hit through Multiscale thanks to Sunsteel Strike, set up Stealth Rock in front of Lugia without fear of much, remove Lugia's Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off, or cripple Lugia with Thunder Wave or the rare Toxic. Offensive variants can set up with Dragon Dance in front of Lugia and chunk it with a boosted attack.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>:Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Magearna can come in on Lugia and utilize their utility moves for free, whether that's setting up entry hazards, removing them, or providing cleric support, respectively. The former two can even threaten to status Lugia.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Multiscale is the only reason Lugia is even remotely viable, so any way to consistently break it effectively cripples Lugia.

Whirlwind allows Lugia to phaze out foes like Zygarde that are trying to set up. Ice Beam hits Ground- and Dragon-type foes for a considerable amount of damage, OHKOing Rayquaza after Stealth Rock and 3HKOing Zygarde-C while Lugia shrugs off their attacks. Toxic is Lugia's main way of dealing with the majority of the metagame; it should be used liberally against foes that are not Steel- or Poison-type to whittle them down and stall them out with Lugia's fantastic bulk. Thunder Wave is an option to incapacitate wallbreakers that try to switch in on Lugia, such as Calyrex-S and Urshifu-S, or the aforementioned Steel- and Poison-types, like Necrozma-DM and Eternatus. 96 Speed EVs are utilized so that Lugia can outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured base 90s like Kyogre and Groudon, as well as maximum Speed Necrozma-DM.</p> <p>Lugia requires heavy team support, as it is extremely passive and is only seen on more stall-oriented builds. A switch-in to Yveltal is paramount, as it outspeeds Lugia and can cripple it with Knock Off, Taunt, or Toxic. Defensive Xerneas and Eternatus are great teammates, able to deal with anything Yveltal throws their way while also acting as consistent answers to Marshadow, a wallbreaker that Lugia cannot deal with. Ghost-types in general are a problem for Lugia, especially Calyrex-S. As such, Yveltal acts as a good answer to them. Lugia struggles against the premier Steel-types of the metagame in Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn, so teammates that can beat them are appreciated. Physically defensive Eternatus can use Flamethrower to beat them both, shrugging off their hits and PP stalling them with Pressure. Ho-Oh can threaten them with Sacred Fire and can also remove entry hazards for Lugia with Defog if Lugia's Heavy-Duty Boots are removed. It also serves as a switch-in to Calyrex-S and Marshadow, scouting their sets. In return, Lugia can deal with Zygarde and Rayquaza, both of which give Ho-Oh trouble. Cleric support is necessary in case Lugia gets statused, so Blissey and Chansey make perfect teammates, removing status and acting as emergency switch-ins to Ghost-type attacks. Status absorbers such as Rest Zygarde and Giratina also work.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Heavy-Duty Boots rids Ho-Oh of its most crippling flaw, its Stealth Rock weakness, making it a critical defensive Pokemon in the metagame. Thanks to Regenerator, its huge Special Defense, and good defensive typing, Ho-Oh is an important glue Pokemon for teambuilding, as it compresses a myriad of roles into one. Ho-Oh is able to check Xerneas lacking Ingrain, Marshadow without a Rock-type move, and be great backup check to Calyrex-S. It is able to consistently switch into Necrozma-DM, the most common Stealth Rock setter in the tier, and use Defog, giving its team good entry hazard control. Offensively, Ho-Oh is no slouch either, as the Choice Band set is underprepared for and is able to punch serious holes into the vast majority of teams. Ho-Oh has become such a metagame-defining force that it's often specifically prepared for in teambuilding; Ho-Oh’s massive weakness to Rock-type attacks can be easy to exploit, and it must constantly be on the lookout for Knock Off and Toxic users.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Curse sets are an option, but they generally just get statused or phazed. They are also easy to revenge kill due to their lowered Speed. Roost provides a more consistent source of recovery, although it is generally not needed thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots and Regenerator. Pressure is an option in combination with Roost to PP stall opposing Pokemon, but the opportunity cost of not having Regenerator is a severe detriment. Life Orb sets can be used similarly to how the Choice Band set is used, with the freedom to choose moves. Do note that, even with Regenerator, Life Orb and Brave Bird recoil can add up quickly.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-type Moves</strong>: Rock-type moves are often thrown on sets for the sole purpose of taking out Ho-Oh. Meteor Beam Eternatus, Rock Tomb Marshadow, Power Gem Dialga, and Stone Edge Necrozma-DM are a few examples of Pokemon you need to keep in mind when using Ho-Oh.</p> <p><strong>Eternatus: Eternatus doesn’t mind burns and can stall out defensive sets. Physically defensive sets can typically stomach Choice Band Ho-Oh, but specially defensive sets have to be extremely careful around it.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C</strong>: Defensive Zygarde-C with Rest will take anything Ho-Oh throws at it and status it in return. However, offensive Zygarde-C sets must be wary of status or a Choice Band Brave Bird on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Kyogre</strong>: Kyogre can come in on Sacred Fire or Defog and then proceed to use its strong attacks.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: Zekrom hates status from Ho-Oh, but it is resistant to Ho-Oh’s STAB attacks and can threaten it with a powerful Bolt Strike.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off + Stealth Rock</strong>: Ho-Oh is limited if Stealth Rock has been set up, as it then needs to be wary of Knock Off from Pokemon like Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth. Certain Stealth Rock setters, such as Groudon and Tyranitar, do not mind Ho-Oh switching in. Stealth Rock heavily limits Choice Band Ho-Oh.</p> <p><strong>Toxic: While the threat of Toxic is lowered thanks to Regenerator, its damage can add up, especially in late-game scenarios. The residual damage can prevent Ho-Oh from checking threats it otherwise could. Eternatus, Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, and opposing Ho-Oh all can badly poison Ho-Oh.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is the standard Ho-Oh set. Sacred Fire is a great STAB attack, and it has an impressive 50% burn chance. However, you should be careful about using it, as its PP is low—and even lower against Eternatus switch-ins. Ho-Oh is a great user of Defog, as it is able to repeatedly come into Necrozma-DM. Toxic is a good option to stall out Pokemon that don’t particularly mind burns or are immune to them, such as Yveltal and opposing Ho-Oh. Thunder Wave is a great option for Eternatus, which is a very common switch-in that is immune to Toxic and not bothered by burns. Whirlwind is to phaze Xerneas, although it also has its uses for other setup sweepers such as Zygarde-C, Cosmic Power Eternatus, and Calyrex-S. However, you need to watch out for Ingrain Xerneas. Brave Bird is a strong secondary STAB option that hits Fire-resistant Pokemon like Eternatus and Kyogre much harder, and it helps with Sacred Fire's low PP. The given EV spread allows Ho-Oh to always survive a +2 Xerneas's Thunder, with the leftover EVs put into Defense to better deal with physical attackers such as Marshadow. If you run Thunder Wave, a spread of 248 HP / 192 Def / 52 SpD / 16 Spe should be used to let Ho-Oh outspeed Choice Specs Calyrex-S after paralysis.</p> <p>Smart switching is the key to using this set, both in terms of Regenerator recovery and scouting for status or Rock-type coverage moves. Marshadow, Xerneas, and Calyrex-S are too threatening to leave Ho-Oh as your only check to them. Choice Band Marshadow can 2HKO with Poltergeist or Spectral Thief, while Xerneas can threaten to KO Ho-Oh with a boosted Thunder if Ho-Oh has taken damage, or use Ingrain to prevent Ho-Oh from phazing it. Choice Specs Calyrex-S will 2HKO Ho-Oh outright. As such, Pokemon such as Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, Zarude, Buzzwole, Lunala, and Tangrowth make good defensive partners. Necrozma-DM can provide a solid defense against Ice-Types, Offensive Eternatus, and Xerneas, as well as give Stealth Rock and status support, while Yveltal will keep Calyrex-S at bay. Lunala, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth also offer good defense against Groudon, Zekrom, and Zygarde-C, while the latter two offer a good pivot against Marshadow. Eternatus and Blissey are excellent teammates for their ability to switch into Kyogre. All of the aforementioned Pokemon appreciate Ho-Oh's ability to serve as a backup check to the tier's biggest sweepers, as well as Defog. Zarude in particular likes Ho-Oh’s ability to Defog, as Zarude often replaces Yveltal on teams, and in return, Zarude can role compress a Calyrex-S check and Ground-type check into one. Ho-Oh can consistently switch into entry hazard setters such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn and force them out, even if they hit it with Knock Off. However, if Ho-Oh hard switches into these Pokemon every time, it can becomd predictable and be taken advantage of by double switches. Ho-Oh must be wary of alternative setters of Stealth Rock, such as Groudon and Tyranitar. Having a secondary Defog user, such as Yveltal, can be useful for providing more security against such Pokemon, as well as against Sticky Web and other offensive playstyles, depending on your team structure. Alternatively, Ho-Oh can be used to free up moveslots on Pokemon such as Yveltal and Necrozma-DM, who now don’t need to run Defog or check Xerneas, respectively.</p> "

Earthquake rounds out Ho-Oh's coverage and is its strongest option against Eternatus and Zekrom. The last move is flexible. Whirlwind is generally preferred, as it gives Ho-Oh more defensive utility in phazing opposing Ho-Oh and Zygarde-C in a pinch. Flare Blitz does massive damage and is stronger than Sacred Fire; it also makes up for Sacred Fire’s low PP. Defog can be used in emergency situations to clear away Stealth Rock. The given EVs allow Ho-Oh to survive a +2 Xerneas Thunder, with the remaining EVs put into Attack to maximize Ho-Oh’s power. 16 Attacks EVs can be moved to Speed to make Ho-Oh faster than a paralyzed Calyrex-S. It's not advisable to go much faster than this, though, because Choice Band Ho-Oh functions best as an offensive tank, and it would rather not lose significant breaking power or the ability to check special threats.</p> <p>While this set is immensely strong, the major flaw is its vulnerability to Stealth Rock. Because of this, Choice Band Ho-Oh is usually a Pokemon that teams specifically build around. At least two Defog users are recommended: Yveltal, Lunala, Xerneas, Giratina, and Corviknight are good possible partners. Xatu is notable for having Magic Bounce and being able to switch into Stealth Rock setters such as Necrozma-DM repeatedly. Additionally, teammates that can lure and break through defensive Zygarde-C are appreciated. Groudon is a good partner for this, and it can also provide sun to make Ho-Oh even stronger and to lower Thunder's accuracy. Teammates that like Eternatus being gone, such as Marshadow, synergize well, as this set often breaks through Eternatus.</p> "

While base 90 Speed is not great, especially by Ubers's standards, Kyogre still outspeeds and breaks past common walls with its strong moves, and it outspeeds offensive threats once equipped with a Choice Scarf. Nevertheless, Kyogre often struggles to beat some of the extremely common Dragon-types that run rampant in Ubers such as Eternatus and Zekrom as well as the rarer Grass-types in Ferrothorn and Zarude, and it also finds Blissey problematic.

Ice Beam lets Kyogre deal with the Dragon- and Grass-types that resist its STAB moves, especially Eternatus, which can outspeed Kyogre and reliably recover any lost HP. Thunder is perfectly accurate under Kyogre's rain, allows it to beat opposing Kyogre, chunks Palkia, and has a respectable chance to paralyze the foe.

Defensively, Groudon's typing and excellent physical bulk let it check physical threats such as Zekrom. Good bulk, an immunity to Thunder Wave, and several boosting options in Rock Polish, Bulk Up, and Swords Dance allow Groudon to decimate many common defensive cores, and these traits give it an easy time setting up on common Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM. Groudon does have trouble getting past the few checks it does have, although even these can be dealt with with the right coverage move. Groudon's main flaws are that its attacks often have low accuracy and it has no reliable recovery, meaning it can be worn down over time by status, Knock Off, and repeated attacks; additionally, if it lacks Rock Polish, Groudon is slow and prone to being picked off by faster threats such as Calyrex-S.</p> ",

Rock Slide’s flinch chance can be situationally useful on teams that heavily utilize paralysis. Overheat can be run over Heat Crash, since it will still OHKO Tangrowth and Buzzwole, and it has the advantage of not needing a boost to do so.

        "description": "<p>This set makes use of Groudon's naturally high physical bulk to provide more support for its team, as well as being a terrifying wallbreaker in its own right. Without Rock Polish, Groudon can run another coverage option or a status move to help deal with its normal checks, such as Zarude, Buzzwole, Tangrowth, and Lunala. Bulk Up gives a better matchup against Zygarde than Swords Dance, and it gives Groudon superior physical bulk after boosting. Swords Dance facilitates a more defensive EV spread that gives Groudon more bulk without boosting that can be used to lure in and defeat Foul Play Yveltal and better check physical attackers in a pinch. The last moveslot is very flexible. Heat Crash is a great coverage option to KO Buzzwole, Zarude, Tangrowth, Skarmory, and Corviknight, which would otherwise wall Groudon. Notably, Heat Crash under sun will typically do just as much damage as Precipice Blades will to a neutral target, easing Groudon's accuracy issues. Toxic is useful to break down Lunala and Zygarde over time. Thunder Wave provides nice team support and helps patch up Groudon's low Speed. 240 HP EVs improve Leftovers recovery; Leftovers and higher HP investment give this set more bulk to check Zekrom and other physical attackers, and they prolong Groudon's sweeping potential. Maximum Attack investment ensures Groudon will hit hard as possible after a Bulk Up, being able to OHKO Tangrowth with Heat Crash. 16 Speed EVs work well alongside Thunder Wave or paralysis support to outspeed paralyzed Calyrex-S. Another option is to run a spread of 224 HP / 108 Atk / 160 Def / 16 Spe with an Impish nature; it is preferred for Swords Dance sets, notably giving Groudon the bulk to survive a Foul Play from Yveltal even after it has used Swords Dance. The Attack investment is used to always KO specially defensive Yveltal with Stone Edge.</p> <p>Other paralysis spreaders like Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Zygarde are good teammates to help make up for Groudon's poor Speed. This Groudon will often inflict status onto or KO Yveltal, so Pokemon that can sweep with Yveltal gone, such as Calyrex-S, are great teammates. If you are running Heat Crash, physical attackers that appreciate Tangrowth or Buzzwole being gone, such as Zekrom and Marshadow, make good partners. Clerics such as Xerneas, Calyrex-S, Blissey, and Clefable will be able to keep Groudon status free, which is especially relevant if Groudon is trying to break through Lunala or Zygarde. This set can struggle to break through defensive Zygarde, so switch-ins to Zygarde such as Lunala, Buzzwole, and Xerneas are great partners.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Precipice Blades and Stone Edge give Groudon great neutral coverage. Rock Polish makes Groudon faster than everything in the metagame bar Choice Scarf Calyrex-S. Swords Dance makes Groudon incredibly strong and gives it the power to break through most physical walls. For example, +2 Life Orb Groudon has an 81.3% chance to OHKO defensive Zygarde, giving it no chance to transform into Zygarde-C. Life Orb gives Groudon great power with or without Swords Dance. However, Lum Berry can be run to better protect Groudon from status such as poison from Eternatus's Toxic Spikes, burn from Lunala's Will-O-Wisp, and paralysis from Zygarde's Glare. Also, the lack of recoil prevents opponents from switching around to get chip damage on it, which can be critical to defeating a damaged Groudon in a pinch. The given EV spread outspeeds uninvested Yveltal and Xerneas.</p> <p>This set is fairly straightforward to use, and it works well on offensive teams. Groudon will appreciate offensive teammates that can help break down its few checks. Zekrom is fantastic for this, luring in and severely damaging Tangrowth or Buzzwole with Draco Meteor. Marshadow is another good physical partner, as its strong Spectral Thief will take out Lunala. In return, Groudon can KO Zygarde. Xerneas and offensive Eternatus have good synergy with Groudon as well, as Groudon can come in on Necrozma-DM, which they attract in. For hyper offense teams, Froslass and Aerodactyl lay down entry hazards and prevent the opponent from laying their own with Taunt. Grimmsnarl is another fantastic hyper offense partner, switching into Calyrex-S, which may try to revenge kill Groudon, and setting up dual screens, making Groudon terrifyingly hard to KO.</p> "

It also provides a good check to some dangerous setup sweepers such as Zekrom and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM. Precipice Blades will still do decent damage generally, even without Attack investment. Stone Edge and Rock Slide are great coverage options, and they notably make the most common Defoggers in the tier, Yveltal and Ho-Oh, very afraid of switching into Groudon. Toxic gives Groudon a decent way of punishing switch-ins such as Zygarde and Yveltal. Dragon Tail can be used to phaze foes and rack up entry hazard damage. It particularly punishes Zygarde nicely. Thunder Wave is another option that can cripple switch-ins, but you need to watch out for Zygarde. 16 Speed EVs are run to outspeed a paralyzed Calyrex-S.</p> <p>This set’s biggest flaws are its lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to status. Because of this, you will want to pair it with a cleric like Xerneas or Blissey. Blissey can even provide Thunder Wave support and check Kyogre. Ferrothorn is good to heal Groudon with Leech Seed and provide Spikes support, which helps Dragon Tail sets. Ferrothorn can also switch into Kyogre, which often switches into Groudon. Necrozma-DM has good synergy with this set, as it appreciates Groudon's sun support for Moonlight, and Groudon can provide extra insurance against physical wallbreakers such as Zekrom and Marshadow. This pairing also frees up a moveslot on Necrozma-DM that is normally reserved for Stealth Rock. For example, it could run Knock Off to cripple Ho-Oh, which then cannot use Defog in front of Groudon due to fear of a Rock-type move, thus severely limiting its presence for the rest of the game and keeping Stealth Rock on the field.</p> "

It can also switch into Dracovish spamming Fishious Rend, safely switch into defensive Necrozma-DM not running Knock Off, and counter special Palkia and Dialga that are not running Choice Specs. However, Gastrodon is a more passive switch-in to Kyogre compared to other options like Eternatus and Ferrothorn and lets it freely use Rest; unlike Gastrodon, other special walls are able to switch in and shut down Kyogre by using it as an opportunity to heal, inflict status, or set entry hazards. Gastrodon is also susceptible to all entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, if not running Heavy-Duty Boots. When not facing Kyogre or Dracovish, Gastrodon is extremely underwhelming and offers little defensive value.</p> ",

Ferrothorn is especially an issue, as it comfortably takes all of Gastrodon's attacks and gets a free chance to use Knock Off or set Spikes. It can also take Gastrodon out with its Grass-type STAB move and recover any small amount of damage it takes with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Blissey, Ho-Oh, and Eternatus can repeatedly sponge any of Gastrodon's attacks and threaten it with Toxic. Blissey and Eternatus can also use Gastrodon to set Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, respectively, as well.</p> <p><strong>Xerneas: Defensive Xerneas can use Gastrodon as an opportunity to provide cleric support, while Geomancy Xerneas can threaten it with a boosted Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Swords Dance Groudon, Choice Band Marshadow, and Choice Band Urshifu-S all force Gastrodon out with their powerful attacks.

Clear Smog is necessary to prevent Calm Mind Kyogre from boosting significantly and powering through Gastrodon. Earthquake hits Eternatus and Toxapex trying to heal or set up Toxic Spikes, and it also catches Zekrom and Dialga for respectable damage. Alternatively, Ice Beam prevents Zygarde-C from using Substitute and setting up on Gastrodon with Coil or Dragon Dance, while Icy Wind conveniently lowers the Speed of switch-ins, such as Calyrex-S and Xerneas to allow Gastrodon's partners to switch in more safely. A Sassy nature is preferred when running Earthquake, while Calm is preferred when Ice Beam or Icy Wind is chosen. Leftovers provides some much appreciated passive recovery, but Heavy-Duty Boots can help mitigate Gastrodon's weakness to Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Gastrodon covering Kyogre and Dracovish frees up Eternatus to run offensive sets. Gastrodon being a Kyogre counter and general switch-in to Water- and Electric-type moves is great for Ho-Oh, which often loses momentum to Kyogre switching into Defog or a weakened Sacred Fire. In return, Ho-Oh is a switch-in for Grass types like Ferrothorn, Zarude, and Tangrowth. Other partners like Ferrothorn and Skarmory can set Spikes to pressure threats to Gastrodon and force Yveltal to use Defog, which drains the opponent's momentum.</p> "

Ice Shard can also be situationally useful in keeping opposing offensive setup sweepers in check, most notably Zekrom and Zygarde. Weavile has incredibly low bulk by Ubers standards, though, and can be incredibly difficult to bring in repeatedly as a result. Its Dark typing can make it difficult to fit onto teams because it cannot check Calyrex-S effectively, forcing stacking weaknesses to common Pokemon like Xerneas. It offers very little to teams defensively and can be difficult to justify over similarly fast offensive Pokemon like Marshadow and Mewtwo, which offer similar offensive pressure, but with more defined defensive niches. Weavile also has to rely on Triple Axel's unreliable accuracy for damage output, which is never ideal.</p> ",

Wide Lens is an option over Heavy-Duty Boots to make Triple Axel more reliable, but this does make Weavile much weaker to entry hazards.

Triple Axel, although unreliable, is Weavile's strongest attack and situationally shuts down Focus Sash users like Slurpuff and Substitute users like Zygarde. Knock Off hits most of the Ice-resistant Pokemon that reside in Ubers, most notably hitting Necrozma-DM. It's also useful to clean late-game because of Triple Axel's notoriously low accuracy. Ice Shard lets Weavile pick off some weakened faster Pokemon in the tier, including setup sweepers like Zekrom and Zygarde. Pressure is useful to deplete the PP of common attacks, most notably Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and Eternatus's Dynamax Cannon.

Its ability Pressure greatly limits the effectiveness of passive entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Toxapex, doubling the PP cost of their entry hazard moves and giving Giratina more effective Defog PP. However, because it relies on status and doesn't have a reliable recovery move, Giratina is a really passive Pokemon and thus fits only on stall teams. It also faces competition with Lunala as a defensive Ghost-type, which is faster, has reliable recovery with Roost, and has a far superior ability in Shadow Shield, making it a much better check to dangerous setup sweepers like Groudon and Zekrom. Finally, its poor typing makes it weak to commonly used types, namely Fairy, Dark, Dragon, and Ghost.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragon Tail is an alternative to Roar, as it does not let Taunt shut down Giratina, but it fails to break most Substitutes, notably those of Kyogre, Zygarde-C, and Xerneas, making it setup fodder against them.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Eternatus: Eternatus completely walls Giratina, being immune to Toxic and not caring much about burn, and in return can severely damage Giratina with its STAB Dragon-type moves. In fact, it can even act as a status absorber thanks to its own Pressure, and thus it can keep coming in constantly on Giratina. Finally, the offensive variant can easily set up with Meteor Beam and then OHKO Giratina with a boosted Dynamax Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Yveltal's Dark typing, Taunt, and powerful super effective STAB moves heavily threaten Giratina. However, it is put on timer if afflicted by Toxic and doesn't appreciate Will-O-Wisp, especially its physical set. Alternatively, Zarude can use Giratina lacking Roar as setup fodder, using Jungle Healing to heal itself from damage and Giratina's status before tearing it apart with a boosted Darkest Lariat.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Other than Eternatus, the many Dragon-types are all threatening for Giratina; this includes both physical and special attackers, including Zekrom, Dracovish, Reshiram, Palkia, and Giratina-O. They can all be crippled by status moves but can in return massively damage Giratina with their STAB Dragon-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Calyrex-S, Marshadow, Lunala, and Giratina-O severely menaces Giratina with their strong STAB Ghost-type moves. While Lunala, Marshadow, and Giratina-O are heavily crippled by status, Calyrex-S isn't thanks to Aromatherapy, and it can cripple Giratina with Trick and a Choice item.</p> <p><strong>Xerneas: Xerneas can set up with Geomancy without fearing much from Giratina, and then it is able to massively damage the whole team with boosted Moonblast. The defensive sets also fear nothing Giratina can go for, with Rest and Aromatherapy to support itself and its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Clerics and Status Absorbers</strong>: Being mostly dependent on residual damage from its status moves, Giratina is greatly hampered by clerics like Clefable and Blissey, the former being able to threaten Giratina with STAB Moonblast. Defensive Kyogre and bulky variants of Zygarde-C can also use Giratina lacking Roar as setup fodder thanks to Rest. Finally, Giratina struggles to punish bulky Poison-types such as Toxapex and Eternatus, which can't be poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Magic Coat: Running mostly no offensive moves, Giratina is nullified by Taunt and Magic Coat users like Yveltal, Grimmsnarl, and Slurpuff; Grimmsnarl and Slurpuff are not affected by Dragon Tail, ignoring Giratina completely to set either dual screens or Sticky Web, while Yveltal can threaten it with Dark Aura-boosted Dark-type moves.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Giratina's main selling point is its effectiveness as a Defogger. With its sheer bulk, it can switch into many threats and use Defog without fear of being taken down instantly. Toxic and Will-O-Wisp wear down and cripple many threats Giratina can switch in on, such as Ho-Oh, Groudon, and Necrozma-DM. Burn can annoy common switch-ins like Yveltal and Eternatus, additionally nullifying the latter's Black Sludge recovery. Will-O-Wisp cannot be absorbed by Steel- and Poison-types Pokemon like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Eternatus, and it especially cripples physical threats like offensive Necrozma-DM, Groudon, and Zekrom. Roar can be used to phaze Pokemon that would use Giratina's passiveness to set up, such as Zygarde-C, Kyogre, and Groudon. It can also rack up damage with entry hazard support. Giratina can be a good status sponge thanks to Pressure and Rest. Pressure also depletes the PP off entry hazard moves and force switches alongside Giratina's status moves and ability to sponge status, giving free momentum to use Defog. You want to keep Giratina healthy as long as possible so it can take many boosted attacks and handle sweepers with either Roar or status.</p> <p>Giratina struggles to work efficiently alone; as a result, it fits on stall teams exclusively. A reliable cleric, such as Blissey or Clefable, is mandatory to not leave it completely useless when it uses Rest. Blissey can switch into many attackers Giratina cannot check or that take advantage of it sleeping, including Eternatus, Xerneas, Calyrex-S, and Kyogre. Clefable can also absorb status and is a good answer to the Dark-type attackers in the metagame. To take advantage of other stall teams, Eternatus is also a good choice, forming a bulky Pressure core with Giratina to PP stall rapidly. While Giratina is a good Defog user, it can't do much while it is asleep, so it works better with a secondary Defog user. Ho-Oh fits well because it provides an offensive answer to Steel-types, punishes Yveltal, Lunala, and Calyrex-S, and can spread status. It also stays very healthy over a long period even while statused thanks to Regenerator. Due to its crippling Ghost and Dark weaknesses, Giratina fits well with a bulky Dark-type, such as Tyranitar or Yveltal; both can take many attacks from both opposing Yveltal and Calyrex-S, Tyranitar is able to set Stealth Rock and threaten them in return with Rock Blast and Foul Play, and Yveltal can cripple them with Knock Off and be Giratina's secondary Defog user while recovering reliably with Roost. Toxapex is able to provide entry hazards that Giratina can benefit from with Roar while checking Marshadow and Dracovish.</p> "

Levitate makes Giratina-O a good check to Ground-types such as Groudon, Landorus, and Landorus-T. Even though its bulk is great, however, Giratina-O has no reliable recovery and is vulnerable to chip damage from Stealth Rock and status. As a base 90 Speed Pokemon, Giratina-O can be outsped by defensive staples like Ho-Oh, and the special set is outsped by non-invested offensive threats like bulky Groudon and Kyogre. It also faces competition as a Ghost-type from Lunala and Calyrex-S; Lunala is a Defogger that possesses better bulk with Shadow Shield and reliable recovery, which let it better check threats like Zekrom, while Calyrex-S hits harder, can severely cripple Yveltal with Trick, and sweeps weakened teams better with As One and Astral Barrage.</p> ",

However, lead Excadrill can almost never set Stealth Rock again if they are cleared, heavily diminishing its value as opposed to bulky entry hazards setters such as Necrozma-DM that can come in several times in a battle. This means that lead Excadrill is limited to hyper offense teams that can punish Defoggers. When not being used as a lead, its mediocre bulk means that careful switching is needed to get it into battle. Furthermore, the limited duration of sand means that it usually can only stay in for a few turns before needing to switch out. Running Sand Rush Excadrill means that you are also required to use Tyranitar on your team, which constrains teambuilding.</p> ",

Rare sights in Dialga and Giratina do not care about Thunder Wave due to running defensive sets and can set up entry hazards or remove Sticky Web with Defog, respectively. Notable Dragon-types that don’t check Galvantula well include Palkia and Rayquaza due to their Electric neutrality.</p> <p><strong>Faster Leads: Pokemon such as Aerodactyl and Froslass can prevent Sticky Web from going up by using Taunt while setting their own entry hazards.

    "overview": "<p>Reshiram possesses a good offensive typing, great offensive stats, and an acceptable Speed tier, making it an extremely potent wallbreaker. It takes advantage of the prevalence of defensive Steel-types to blow holes through foes. However, Reshiram's typing is often a detriment defensively. Reshiram is susceptible to all entry hazards and weak to Stealth Rock, making it extremely easy to chip down. Its neutrality to Water means that other Dragon-types such as Eternatus and Palkia can fit onto teams much more easily. Similarly, Ho-Oh can take on Xerneas's Moonblast much better, leaving Reshiram's defensive capabilities completely overshadowed. All in all, Reshiram's biggest problem is the opportunity cost of running it on a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots removes Reshiram's weakness to entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock. However, Reshiram prefers to maximize its damage with Life Orb. Reshiram can utilize Choice Scarf or Choice Specs to become a revenge killer or an even scarier wallbreaker, but being locked into Blue Flare or Draco Meteor leaves it easily checked by Kyogre and Xerneas, respectively. Toxic is an option to wear down some of Reshiram's checks, such as Tyranitar and Ho-Oh, for both Reshiram and its teammates, but the chance to OHKO Ho-Oh with Stone Edge instead is usually too good to pass up. Fighting-type coverage in Body Press or Focus Blast helps Reshiram take on Blissey and Tyranitar. Body Press 2HKOes both Pokemon after Stealth Rock, while Focus Blast can OHKO Tyranitar with some prior chip damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, limit Reshiram, as it gets chipped down extremely easily.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Calyrex-S, Choice Scarf Kyogre, and offensive Eternatus can all force Reshiram out by threatening to OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Kyogre: Kyogre can set up rain to weaken Blue Flare's power, and bulkier sets can stomach a Draco Meteor. Offensive variants don't like the heavy damage that Draco Meteor inflicts on them, though.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey can take any one of Reshiram's attacks and recover its lost HP with Soft-Boiled while Reshiram aimlessly wastes its PP. It has to be wary of the rare Body Press, however.</p> <p><strong>Lunala</strong>: Lunala can both outspeed Reshiram and take on any of its hits, recovering off all the damage it has taken with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can safely take on Reshiram's attacks and threaten it with Rock Blast or cripple it with Thunder Wave, but its lack of reliable recovery forces it to be cautious as to when it switches in, and it gets nailed by uncommon Fighting-type coverage.</p> ",

Draco Meteor is also extremely powerful and hits the foes that resist Blue Flare, such as Eternatus, Tyranitar, and Kyogre. Roost allows Reshiram to recover in front of the Steel-types that it threatens out. Stone Edge OHKOes Ho-Oh with a roll or with prior damage. Maximum Speed with a Naive nature ensures that Reshiram Speed ties with other base 90s, giving it more opportunities to get its strong attacks off.</p> <p>Reshiram fits best on more offensive teams, playing the role of stallbreaker. It appreciates entry hazard support to soften its checks: Spikes from Cloyster or Froslass can put specially defensive Necrozma-DM and Geomancy Xerneas in OHKO range of Blue Flare. It also puts Zekrom in OHKO range of -2 Draco Meteor. Groudon is a fantastic partner for Reshiram, setting up sun to boost its Blue Flare, setting up Stealth Rock, answering Ground- and Rock-type attacks thrown its way, and paralyzing foes so that Reshiram can outspeed them. In return, Reshiram can threaten opposing Groudon and Zygarde with its attacks. Outside of hyper offense, Defog support from Yveltal or Ho-Oh is paramount, as Reshiram is extremely easy to chip down between its weakness to Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil. Yveltal in particular can use Taunt to stop entry hazards from being set up.</p> "

Moreover, Zekrom can be tailored to beat some of its checks, leaving the opponent to guess what move rounds out its moveset. Zekrom is also a potent stallbreaker thanks to its signature ability, Teravolt, which allows it to break walls such as Multiscale Lugia and Shedinja. However, without a Speed boost, Zekrom is easily outsped and disposed of by the multitude of Fairy- and Dragon-types in the metagame. Even with a Speed boost, it contests with common Choice Scarf users that either Speed tie with it such as Kyogre or outspeed it such as Calyrex-S and Yveltal, and Ditto, all of which OHKO it.</p> ",

Similarly, Magnet Rise lets Zekrom completely invalidate any Ground-type move thrown its way, but most Ground-types can still deal with it such as Roar or Toxic from Groudon and Thousand Arrows from Zygarde-C hitting regardless. Weather Ball with a Naive nature is an option when paired up with Groudon to hit the various Grass-types that wish to switch in like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn, but it requires Zekrom to come in while sun is still up and is also very prediction heavy. Outrage blows past Zygarde prior to Power Construct activating and has a much higher damage output against all targets, but the abundance of Fairy-types in the metagame means Zekrom being locked into it will end with it getting KOed the very next turn. A damage-reducing Berry in either Roseli or Shuca to sponge a Fairy- or Ground-type move respectively will let Zekrom take an otherwise super effective move, thus limiting the chances the opponent has of revenge killing it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Groudon: Groudon can take on Zekrom's physical hits with ease and threaten it out with its Ground-type attack.

Sludge Wave is an option to prevent Xerneas from using Geomancy in front of Landorus, leaving Xerneas vulnerable to priority or even OHKOing it if Stealth Rock is up. Thanks to the pressure Landorus applies on the opposite team, it can also easily set up Stealth Rock. As far as Superpower is concerned, it allows Landorus to hit special walls like Blissey and Ferrothorn hard. Explosion is a useful option on hyper offense teams with Sticky Web, preventing the foe from using Defog or Rapid Spin.

        "description": "<p>Sticky Web is a great enabler for slower threats in Ubers. Yawn forces the opponent to think twice before trying to clear Sticky Web with their spinner or Defogger, as the risk of falling asleep is far too great and deters setup sweepers such as Double Dance Groudon and Geomancy Xerneas. Magic Coat lets Slurpuff have a fighting chance against Taunt users such as Yveltal and Grimmsnarl while also bouncing back status moves and opposing entry hazards. It also deters Sticky Web setters. Misty Explosion is a surefire way to stop the opponent from removing Sticky Web, sacrificing Slurpuff in order for the foe's move to not have a target. It also gives Slurpuff's teammates a safe switch in once it's been KOed. Endeavor is an option over Yawn, taking an enemy down to Slurpuff's HP number and thus setting up an incoming sweeper to threaten once Slurpuff is KOed. Focus Sash is extremely important, synergizing with Unburden to allow Slurpuff to get a final Yawn or Endeavor off, as it outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame. A Naive nature with the provided EVs and IVs minimizes Slurpuff's bulk to help it activate Focus Sash, notably ensuring that Life Orb Yveltal's Oblivion Wing does exactly that.</p> <p>Slurpuff fits best on hyper offense teams. With its ability to deter or even bounce back Stealth Rock with Magic Coat, Focus Sash sweepers such as Rayquaza and Calyrex-S shine through. Calyrex-S can also provide spinblocking support against Excadrill and Pheromosa to keep Sticky Web up. Slower wallbreakers that are usually held back by their Speed such as Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM and Choice Specs Kyogre appreciate Sticky Web limiting the opportunities for them to be revenge killed. Teammates that can deter Defoggers help Slurpuff achieve its goal. Zekrom can threaten both Yveltal and Ho-Oh, while Meteor Beam Eternatus can lure them in and proceed to OHKO them. Similarly, fast Taunt Yveltal can stop the move from ever coming out.</p> "

Xerneas has fairly high natural bulk with a good typing, letting it also potentially wall many dangerous wallbreakers such as Zekrom, Zygarde, and Marshadow. Most of Xerneas's offensive power comes from Geomancy, though, meaning that if it is phazed or otherwise forced out, its effectiveness offensively is severely hurt, and defensive sets without it struggle to break through most walls in general.</p> ",

Defensive Xerneas can run Heavy-Duty Boots as the item, benefitting from it long term against entry hazard chip damage. The lack of recovery is quite noticeable, though, as Xerneas really likes recovering without having to use Rest. Xerneas can also opt to run a Choice Scarf set with Moonblast, Aromatherapy, Thunder Wave, and Defog, making it a fast revenge killer and support Pokemon with cleric and hazard control abilities. This set doesn't have the power backing of Geomancy or the bulk of defensive sets, though, making it harder to fit on teams overall.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM: Necrozma-DM is the premier Steel-type in the tier, and one of the best Xerneas checks.

Defensive Xerneas also is completely unable to break through these Pokemon, allowing them to easily take advantage of it.</p> <p><strong>Phazing</strong>: With offensive Xerneas's reliance on Geomancy for breaking many common defensive Pokemon, phazing effectively neutralizes it as a threat.

Knock Off gives more coverage and makes Necrozma-DM very difficult for bulky teams to deal with; defensive Pokemon such as Lunala, Tangrowth, Ho-Oh, Ferrothorn, and opposing Necrozma-DM that may try to stop this set can get crippled for the rest of the game. Stone Edge is an alternative that lets it get past Yveltal and especially Ho-Oh. Moonlight and Leftovers allow Necrozma-DM to use its good bulk to boost several times. The EVs ensure that it outspeeds all Calyrex-I, which it checks decently with this set, as well as paralyzed Calyrex-S. With Dragon Dance, it will outspeed all base 100 Pokemon at +1 and non-Choice Scarf Calyrex-S at +2. A bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 136 SpD / 120 Spe can be used to better check Xerneas and offensive Eternatus, especially if your team lacks an alternative check such as Ho-Oh or Blissey. Do note that the lack of Attack investment is quite noticeable.</p> <p>This set works best on teams with other bulky teammates that already cover some of the roles that defensive Necrozma-DM would normally cover. In return, Necrozma-DM can still provide some of its defensive roles and also function as a strong wallbreaker. Since it lacks Stealth Rock, a teammate such as Groudon, Blissey, Clefable, Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, or Landorus can provide an entry hazard. An additional Xerneas check, such as Ho-Oh or Blissey, is a great teammate, since this set lacks the bulk to take on Geomancy Xerneas consistently. Clerics such as Calyrex-S, Clefable, and Blissey make great partners, as this set can often get statused early in the game. Pairing Necrozma-DM with a strong physical partner such as Groudon, Zekrom, or Marshadow lets both break down checks for each other. Finally, paralysis spreaders such as Ho-Oh, Blissey, Zygarde, and Groudon are terrific teammates, as this set benefits from the Speed drop and paralysis chance, especially in tandem with Iron Head.</p> "

Particularly, hyper offense teams like its ability to limit some typical anti-offense Pokemon, such as Xerneas and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan. Sunsteel Strike is therefore your mandatory STAB attack to OHKO the former more often. Stone Edge is used mainly to KO Ho-Oh and Yveltal when boosted. From there, Earthquake gives good neutral coverage and hits Pokemon such as Eternatus and Zekrom extremely hard. The EV spread and nature give Necrozma-DM enough Speed to beat Adamant Marshadow after a Dragon Dance. At +2, it will also outspeed non-Choice Scarf Calyrex-S. A viable alternative is to run 136 HP / 252 Atk / 120 Spe with an Adamant nature, which outspeeds fully invested base 100 Speed Pokemon after a Dragon Dance. Weakness Policy limits the offensive options against this set from the opposing team and also gives easy setup opportunities against Pokemon like Eternatus. On the other hand, Lum Berry lets Necrozma-DM 2HKO Lunala without fear of being burned and avoid paralysis from opposing Necrozma-DM. It also allows it to 2HKO Tangrowth without fear of Sleep Powder.</p> <p>This set loves strong wallbreakers for teammates, as it's much better at cleaning up weakened teams than breaking through cores and overcoming common defensive Pokemon such as Kyogre, Zygarde, Zarude, Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, Lunala, and Groudon by itself. Offensive teammates such as Zekrom and Groudon make fantastic partners, as both can both lure in and KO Tangrowth with their coverage options. Zekrom will make quick work of Kyogre, while Double Dance Groudon, Rayquaza, and Xerneas are all good options to overpower Zygarde. Marshadow will be able to OHKO Lunala and most Ferrothorn.</p> "

In exchange, this set can check Pokemon such as Zekrom and offensive Necrozma-DM sets. Notably, this set is also perhaps the best check to the powerful physical Ice-types of the tier, Galarian Darmanitan and Calyrex-I. Stealth Rock provides Necrozma-DM with its usual supporting role, but be mindful that this set has little to stop Yveltal or Ho-Oh from using Defog on it. Earthquake is used to hit Zekrom and opposing Necrozma-DM hard, with Sunsteel Strike preferred over Iron Head because paralysis isn't on this set. Iron Head could be run for its higher PP against SubSeed Calyrex-I and works well with paralysis support from teammates. Finally, Moonlight is critical to keeping this set healthy, especially since Rocky Helmet has been chosen over Leftovers to better help Necrozma-DM damage Zekrom and other physical attackers. Leftovers could be used to better check SubSeed Calyrex-I and is preferred if using Necrozma-DM on a team with Kyogre, which weakens Moonlight with rain.</p> <p>As mentioned above, Blissey is a great teammate, since it covers the roles that specially defensive Necrozma-DM normally would like checking Xerneas and offensive Eternatus. Since this set can handle Zekrom relatively well, it will work best on teams that don't have another Zekrom answer. Be mindful that, depending on the circumstances, Zekrom and offensive Necrozma-DM can still win against this set, so a revenge killer like Calyrex-S or Marshadow is a good partner.

While its Speed allows it to safely take on most walls, it gets outsped by opposing wallbreakers such as Landorus, Palkia, and Eternatus.

Icicle Spear is useful for breaking Substitutes from Pokemon like Zekrom and Zygarde-C.</p> <p>As Calyrex-I hates entry hazards, Defoggers such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and defensive Xerneas support it well; Yveltal also provides momentum in the form of a slow U-turn. A switch-in to Ghost- and Dark-types that force Calyrex-I out, such as Yveltal or Xerneas, is appreciated. In return, Calyrex-I is able to pressure their switch-ins, Eternatus and Necrozma-DM, sufficiently. Offensive partners such as Xerneas appreciate their shared checks such as Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM being weakened. Eternatus is a solid blanket check to Ho-Oh, Kyogre, and Marshadow, which all force Calyrex-I out if it predicts incorrectly.</p> "
