        "description": "<p>Mega Charizard X is a ferocious wallbreaker and setup sweeper, aiding Fire teams in matchups like Dragon, Fire, and Electric. Tough Claws-boosted Flare Blitz fires off nuclear-powered attacks, heavily denting walls such as Mandibuzz, Gliscor, and Mega Sableye. Dragon Claw, also powered up by Tough Claws, threatens Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Kommo-o. Earthquake threatens switch-ins like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Heatran, while Roost increases Mega Charizard X's longevity and mitigate recoil damage from Flare Blitz. Alternatively, Thunder Punch may be used to deal more damage to Slowbro, Pelipper, and Tapu Fini while still retaining super effective coverage against Toxapex. Volcarona is an exceptional teammate, as it threatens physical walls such as Slowbro, Toxapex, and Hippowdon after a Quiver Dance. Torkoal supports Mega Charizard X with sun to boost Flare Blitz's power and remove rain, Stealth Rock to wear down switch-ins, and Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards. Rotom-H sets up Reflect and Light Screen to ease Mega Charizard X's setup process and offers pivoting with Volt Switch. Choice Scarf Blacephalon is a great late-game cleaner and is appreciated to wear down troublesome walls like Skeledirge and Slowbro as well as cripple Toxapex and Porygon2 with Trick. Heatran traps and withers down Toxapex with Magma Storm and prevents Stealth Rock from being set up using Taunt. Cinderace provides entry hazard control with Court Change and brings Mega Charizard X in using U-turn.</p> "

The given EV spread allows Mega Altaria to survive Mega Lopunny's Triple Axel. Choice Specs Kyurem is a great teammate, as it breaks past the likes of Toxapex, Corviknight, and Dondozo for Mega Altaria. Garchomp sets up Stealth Rock and Spikes, wearing down Mega Altaria's switch-ins. Kommo-o breaks past Steel-types like Skarmory, Aegislash, and defensive Celesteela as well as other troublesome walls like Toxapex and Hippowdon for Mega Altaria.

Fire Blast can be used over Fiery Dance for more immediate damage output. Giga Drain deals with Water- and Ground-types, most notably Swampert, Gastrodon, and Rotom-Wash.

Hidden Power Ground hits Heatran, allowing Volcarona to break Steel's immunity-based defensive core that can otherwise give Bug teams problems. Alternatively, Psychic can be used to damage bulky Poison-types, like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, that can wall physical attackers like Heracross and Buzzwole. These physical attackers, in addition to Lokix and Scizor, are able to break through specially defensive walls, like Chansey and Mantine, that Volcarona struggles against.

Bug Buzz covers the Psychic and Dark matchups very well and allows it to hit Roaring Moon, Ting-Lu, and Latias, which would otherwise be a challenge to deal with. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Volcarona from being worn down by entry hazards, most notably Stealth Rock, which would otherwise stop Volcarona from being able to set up safely. Psychium Z lets Volcarona OHKO Toxapex with a +1 Shattered Psyche and beat otherwise troublesome threats like +1 Kommo-o, Iron Hands, and Clodsire. Cinderace and Mega Charizard X are especially good partners due to their ability to break through special walls such as Blissey, Clodsire, and Galarian Slowking with relative ease. Entry hazard removers such as Torkoal, Rotom-H, and Court Change Cinderace are near necessities if Volcarona is running Psychium Z. Torkoal and Rotom-H can also provide excellent utility in the form of Stealth Rock and dual screens, respectively, to help Volcarona sweep more easily. Volcanion is also an excellent partner for Volcarona that, thanks to its Water immunity, can act as a strong pivot into Pokemon like Azumarill and Mantine, which could revenge kill it or clear Quiver Dance boosts with Haze.</p> "
