Tough Claws-boosted Flare Blitz fires off nuclear-powered attacks, heavily denting walls such as Mandibuzz, Gliscor, and Mega Sableye. Dragon Claw, also powered up by Tough Claws, threatens Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Kommo-o. Earthquake threatens switch-ins like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Heatran, while Roost increases Mega Charizard X's longevity and mitigate recoil damage from Flare Blitz. Alternatively, Thunder Punch may be used to deal more damage to Slowbro, Pelipper, and Tapu Fini while still retaining super effective coverage against Toxapex. Volcarona is an exceptional teammate, as it threatens physical walls such as Slowbro, Toxapex, and Hippowdon after a Quiver Dance. Torkoal supports Mega Charizard X with sun to boost Flare Blitz's power and remove rain, Stealth Rock to wear down switch-ins, and Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards. Rotom-H sets up Reflect and Light Screen to ease Mega Charizard X's setup process and offers pivoting with Volt Switch. Choice Scarf Blacephalon is a great late-game cleaner and is appreciated to wear down troublesome walls like Skeledirge and Slowbro as well as cripple Toxapex and Porygon2 with Trick. Heatran traps and withers down Toxapex with Magma Storm and prevents Stealth Rock from being set up using Taunt. Cinderace provides entry hazard control with Court Change and brings Mega Charizard X in using U-turn.</p> "

Reversing the momentum of fast offensive threats such as Iron Valiant, Mega Charizard X, and Excadrill allows Ditto to force counterplay against offensive teams. Ditto can also take advantage of entry hazard setters and removers, such as Ferrothorn, Kleavor, and Zapdos, using their own longevity or utility against them. In order to take advantage of Pok√©mon that use either Return or Frustration, such as Mega Altaria or Mega Pinsir, Ditto likes to run 128 Happiness instead of 252 or 0. Walls like Blissey and Porygon2 appreciate Ditto being able to prevent threats such as Baxcalibur and Spectrier from using them as setup fodder, while Ditto appreciates both defensive switch-ins and slow pivots via their use of Teleport. Mega Lopunny is a staple on Normal teams that accents Ditto's role expertly; many of the offensive threats and setup sweepers that revenge kill Mega Lopunny, such as Mega Charizard X, Kommo-o, and Galarian Moltres, are usually very weak to their own sets or coverage. Mega Lopunny can lure a threat in and pivot with U-turn, allowing Ditto to come in safely and transform. Ditto appreciates Mega Lopunny's Speed tier and fast pivot with U-turn, as well as potentially setting up Ditto with Encore Sets to stop foes from using Substitute or setting up completely. Hisuian Zoroark makes for another stellar teammate for Ditto, as Hisuian Zoroark disguised as a passive Pokemon, such as Blissey, or another offensive threat, such as Diggersby or Mega Lopunny, can lead to Hisuian Zoroark wallbreaking and netting KOs on vital foes, making it easier for Ditto to sweep once it has transformed. While Ditto is immune to Sticky Web, it is susceptible to other hazards such as Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, so forms of hazard control such as Staraptor or Cyclizar are appreciated. Staraptor is another defensive option, while Cyclizar can enable Ditto to utilize Transform with a Substitute from Shed Tail. Smeargle on more offense-oriented teams' pairs well with Ditto, as Smeargle can set hazards with Stone Axe or Ceaseless Edge and spread status with Nuzzle, Mortal Spin, or Spore, allowing Ditto to exploit the opposing team easier. Smeargle will usually give up Sticky Web when paired with Ditto so as to not hinder Ditto's revenge killing prowess.</p> "

Heat Wave beats Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Iron Treads, and Ferrothorn, thus making it an incredible asset in the Steel and Grass matchups. Hidden Power Ice cleanly OHKOes Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp; alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be used if reliably eliminating Gastrodon and Swampert is more important. Volt Switch lets Zapdos switch out of its checks like Tyranitar and Blissey, keeping momentum in favor of Zapdos's team. As dangerous as Zapdos is, it is highly susceptible to Stealth Rock; hence, Rotom-W is a great partner that can use Defog while also helping Zapdos beat Ground-types thanks to Hydro Pump. Iron Hands and Zeraora help Zapdos wallbreak by wearing down special walls like Heatran, Blissey, and Clodsire.

Iron Hands provides the coverage and bulk against Pokemon like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Volcarona, and SubRoost Kyurem that Rotom-W can't deal with while also putting a lot of pressure on Normal teams, as Rotom-W can Volt Switch against Blissey into Iron Hands and force Blissey to tank a hit or switch out. Alolan Raichu gives Rotom-W's slow Volt Switch a lot of value as it is strong but frail, being able to deal with Ice-types like Baxcalibut with Focus Blast and Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Clodsire with Psyshock. Magnezone provides a valuable Poison immunity while also checking other threats like Tapu Lele, Meowscarada, and Alolan Ninetales.</p> "

Alternatively, Toxic cripples walls like Mantine and Rotom-W, as well as Pokemon that fancy switching into Heatran such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Substitute pairs well with Toxic and allows Heatran to be massively annoying against types like Steel, Electric, and Psychic by capitalizing on the many switches it forces in these matchups. Thanks to their typing and bulk, Corviknight and Celesteela are excellent teammates to check Ground- and Fighting-types like Mamoswine and Great Tusk for Heatran. Setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Z-Happy Hour Jirachi appreciate Heatran wearing down teams with burn and Toxic. Iron Treads removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin and deals with Mega Charizard Y, Zeraora, and Cinderace with its Choice Scarf set.

Entry hazard removers such as Torkoal, Rotom-H, and Court Change Cinderace are near necessities if Volcarona is running Psychium Z. Torkoal and Rotom-H can also provide excellent utility in the form of Stealth Rock and dual screens, respectively, to help Volcarona sweep more easily. Volcanion is also an excellent partner for Volcarona that, thanks to its Water immunity, can act as a strong pivot into Pokemon like Azumarill and Mantine, which could revenge kill it or clear Quiver Dance boosts with Haze.</p> "

Rock Slide is another option to hit Volcarona, as it is dangerous once set up, as well as Mantine, Zapdos, and Araquanid; however, using it is very situational and forces Landorus to use an unpreferred nature. Gravity allows Landorus to ease the Flying and Steel matchups and easily spam Earth Power, increasing its potential to new heights and also supporting its teammates like Choice Band Sand Rush Excadrill.

Shadow Claw notably allows Mimikyu to threaten Psychic teams even under Psychic Terrain, while Drain Punch deals more damage to Steel-types such as Iron Treads, Magnezone, and Excadrill and can mitigate Life Orb recoil. Shadow Sneak enables Mimikyu to revenge kill weakened foes and pick off faster threats like Blacephalon, Gengar, and Victini. Disguise almost always allows Mimikyu to set up a Swords Dance or revenge kill faster foes that Shadow Sneak cannot deal enough damage to. Mega Sableye is heavily appreciated due to its ability Magic Bounce, which adds to Mimikyu's longevity by bouncing back entry hazards and status moves aimed at it. Wallbreakers like Gholdengo wear down bulkier teams by checking walls such as Corviknight, Mega Venusaur, and Toxapex, which lets Mimikyu have an easier time cleaning up late-game. Blacephalon and Skeledirge threaten the Steel-types Mimikyu struggles against, like Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Mega Scizor. They can also cripple troublesome walls such as Toxapex and Gastrodon with Trick and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Hisuian Zoroark is deeply valued for its Ghost-type immunity, as it can catch Gholdengo and Gengar off guard.</p> "

Flamethrower takes care of Steel-type Pokemon neutral to Drain Punch like Mega Scizor and Corviknight. Taunt allows Kommo-o to block status moves from defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Swampert, and Gliscor, preventing them from resetting its boosts with Haze or statusing it with Toxic. Alternatively, Clangorous Soul powers up Kommo-o without using its Z-Move, letting its Clangorous Soulblaze outright OHKO Toxapex and Hippowdon, at the cost of longevity. Bulletproof is Kommo-o's preferred ability to better handle Gholdengo or Aegislash in the Steel matchup. Unboosted Kommo-o's average Speed tier leaves it outsped by threats to Fighting teams like Tornadus-T and Tapu Lele, so Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion are great partners to assist it against them. Iron Valiant's Fairy typing and wide coverage movepool lets it deal with opposing Dragon-types, and it forms a wallbreaking core with Kommo-o by pressuring the likes of Mega Sableye and Ting-Lu. Cobalion and Great Tusk provide Stealth Rock, which maximizes Kommo-o's opportunities to wallbreak after using Clangorous Soulblaze. Great Tusk can also remove entry hazards for Kommo-o with Rapid Spin, and Cobalion has the added bonus of checking Fairy-types like Mega Diancie. Mega Gallade can pressure Poison-, Ground-, and Flying-types like Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T for Kommo-o.

Drain Punch threatens Steel- and Normal-types like Heatran, Blissey, and Porygon-2 as well as increasing Kommo-o's longevity, making it harder for revenge killers to shut it down after using its Z-Move. Additionally, Drain Punch is Kommo-o's best move to hit Ditto, as it copies its ability Soundproof. Flamethrower targets Fighting-resistant or -immune Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Aegislash. Taunt is preferred to shut down phazers like Haze Toxapex and Hippowdon and bulky walls like Porygon2 and Clodsire, which can inconvenience Kommo-o with Toxic. Meanwhile, Clangorous Soul allows for more boosts and breaking power, notably enabling Clangorous Soulblaze to OHKO the aforementioned Hippowdon and Toxapex. Furthermore, Clangorous Soulblaze allows Kommo-o to set up on Fairy-types and Soundproof Pokemon like Alolan Ninetales, Trace Porygon2, and opposing Kommo-o. Soundproof prevents revenge killing attempts from Ditto or opposing Kommo-o, and a Naive nature permits Kommo-o to outpace Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Lopunny, and Zeraora after obtaining the omni-boost. Mega Altaria is a wonderful teammate, as it helps weaken and clean up opposing Dragon teams; In return, it appreciates Kommo-o dealing with the aforementioned Steel-types. Kyurem aids in matchups against Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Mantine, and Dragonite, as well as Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Tapu Fini, and Mega Altaria. Choice Scarf Latias and Roaring Moon provide speed control; the former offers healing and setup opportunities with Healing Wish, while the latter checks Psychic-types like Deoxys-S, Victini, and Latias. Garchomp offers entry hazards support to pressure and chip down Kommo-o's switch-ins and aids in the Steel matchup with Earthquake. Hisuian Goodra is a huge help in the Fairy matchup, taking on Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Mega Diancie. Mega Latios threatens Flying-type threats with its BoltBeam coverage; in addition, when paired with Garchomp, it puts a lot of pressure on Poison teams, which Kommo-o tends to struggle against. Cyclizar provides entry hazard control with Rapid Spin and extra protection for Kommo-o with Shed Tail, encouraging the use of Clangorous Soul over Taunt. Baxcalibur is excellent in the Dark and Flying matchups, dispatching threats like Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Enamorus with its Swords Dance or Dragon Dance set, and it also ravages Poison teams with Galarian Slowking, which Kommo-o might not be able to handle. In return, Kommo-o removes the aforementioned Steel- and Normal-types that can easily wall Baxcalibur or use it to reverse sweep, specifically Ditto.</p> "

Close Combat synergizes well with Kleavor's STAB moves, crushing Steel-types like Iron Treads. U-turn allows Kleavor to pivot out of Great Tusk and Skarmory to bring in teammates like Araquanid or Volcarona. Night Slash banishes Ghost-types like Gholdengo, Knock Off softens walls like Corviknight and Porygon2 for its teammates, and X-Scissor takes down Slowbro to make way for Mega Pinsir. Araquanid and Galvantula are excellent teammates, as these set up Sticky Web to patch up Kleavor's unassuming speed, even when using a Choice Scarf, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Blacephalon. Additionally, they also help in dealing with pesky Fire- and Flying-types like Volcarona and Landorus, respectively. Physical setup sweepers benefit from Kleavor's ability to set hazards offensively, Knock Off items from walls, and deal with Skeledirge and Slowbro, which often wall Mega Pinsir, Scizor, and Mega Scizor. In return, they deal with Fighting- and Fairy-types like Great Tusk and Mega Diancie. Quiver Dance Volcarona appreciates Skeledirge removed, as this lets it clean up Ghost teams at +1; it can also be brought in against passive walls like Slowbro and Skarmory. Forretress provides Rapid Spin and loves Kleavor's ability to set Stealth Rock, as this allows it to run other hazards like Toxic Spikes or Volt Switch to better support the team. Lokix provides great offensive support with its access to priority in First Impression and Sucker Punch to finish off teams weakened by Kleavor through entry hazards and repeated Knock Offs.

U-turn pivots Sneasler out of switch-ins such as Skeledirge, Aegislash, and Gliscor, bringing in Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Mega Gallade. Switcheroo further punishes walls like Corviknight if the extra speed is unneeded.

Night Slash can also be the final move for Sneasler, as it notably hits Gholdengo and Aegislash, but pivoting out of these threats is usually the better option. Choice Scarf Sneasler is a late-game cleaner, so wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as the aforementioned Kommo-o and Mega Gallade are appreciated, as these deal with Corviknight, Gliscor, and Toxapex. Kommo-o also benefits from Sneasler dealing with Fairy-types, as this allows Kommo-o to use Clangorous Soulblaze.

Flower Trick's guaranteed critical hit is also very useful in the Fairy matchup and lets Meowscarada revenge kill Azumarill and a weakened Tapu Lele behind Reflect. U-turn allows Meowscarada to maintain an advantage against its defensive checks like Corviknight by being able to pivot into its teammates like Scovillain. Knock Off is a tool to cripple Meowscarada's defensive switch-ins like Toxapex and Klefki in addition to the aforementioned Corviknight. Play Rough is a strong coverage option to threaten opposing Dragon-type Pokemon like Kommo-o, Kyurem, and Latios, which Grass teams tend to struggle against. Low Kick is a less frequent option but lets Meowscarada OHKO Bisharp while threatening Heatran with a 2HKO; however, Play Rough is preferred to have an easier time against Dragon teams. Meowscarada has an easier time revenge killing foes with entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Cradily. Ferrothorn appreciates Meowscarada's ability to check Fighting-types like Mega Gallade, Iron Valiant and Galarian Zapdos with STAB Play Rough. Hisuian Lilligant is also a fantastic offensive partner for Meowscarada.

Hisuian Lilligant also makes the Steel matchup easier for Grass; its ability to threaten Heatran is appreciated by Meowscarada, while Meowscarada can threaten Gholdengo with Knock Off, which Lilligant cannot beat. Mega Venusaur is also a mandatory defensive partner for Meowscarada; its Bug neutrality and bulk allows it to act as a consistent check to Mega Scizor, which easily switches into any move of Meowscarada, and Venusaur is able to check it with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Venusaur also checks opposing Fairy-types for Meowscarada like Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Iron Valiant, while Meowscarada is able to threaten the Psychic-types that force out Mega Venusaur such as Latios, Mega Alakazam, and Victini.

Whimsicott's Fairy typing also allows Meowscarada and its teammates not to be overwhelmed by Dragon-types like Garchomp, and it can encore Calm Mind Mega Latias.

Its STAB Moonblast is one of its best qualities, being able to easily beat Mega Sableye and OHKO most opposing Fighting- and Dragon-types such as Buzzwole and Mega Altaria.
