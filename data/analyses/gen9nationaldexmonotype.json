        "description": "<p>Mega Altaria's unique typing and offensive potential allow it to serve as a valuable setup sweeper that checks threats like Kommo-o, Roaring Moon, Iron Hands, and Keldeo. Pixilate-boosted Return checks the aforementioned Dragon-types as well as Fighting- and Dark-types such as Terrakion, Mega Sableye, and Mandibuzz. Earthquake is essential coverage, as it hits Steel- and Fire-types like Heatran and Magnezone and—in conjunction with Return—eases the Dark and Electric matchups. Roost increases Mega Altaria's longevity so it can continuously Dragon Dance throughout the match or use its bulk to switch into threats. The given EV spread allows Mega Altaria to survive Mega Lopunny's Triple Axel. Choice Specs Kyurem is a great teammate, as it breaks past the likes of Toxapex, Corviknight, and Dondozo for Mega Altaria. Garchomp sets up Stealth Rock and Spikes, wearing down Mega Altaria's switch-ins. Kommo-o breaks past Steel-types like Skarmory, Aegislash, and defensive Celesteela as well as other troublesome walls like Toxapex and Hippowdon for Mega Altaria. Roaring Moon threatens obstacles such as Mega Diancie, Choice Specs Greninja, and Skeledirge.</p> "

Scald threatens physical attackers such as Dragonite, Mega Lopunny, and Mimikyu with a burn. Thanks to Gastrodon's bulk, it is able to stack multiple layers of Spikes to wear down opposing teams. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used, freeing a moveslot from a teammate such as Garchomp or Hippowdon. Toxic puts troublesome walls such as Mantine, Ting-Lu, and Araquanid on a timer. Earthquake may be used alongside a Relaxed nature to break Calm Mind Keldeo's Substitute. All of Gastrodon's teammates appreciate its ability to switch into Water-type attacks. Unaware Clodsire checks Grass-types such as Meowscarada and Tapu Bulu as well as setup sweepers Gastrodon can't beat like Volcarona and Galarian Moltres. Iron Treads removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin so Gastrodon can better perform its defensive duties. Wallbreakers like Landorus and Great Tusk appreciate Gastrodon's entry hazard support so that they can net more damage. Mamoswine acts as a secondary Ice-type switch-in that checks the likes of SubRoost Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales, relieving pressure off of Gastrodon.</p> "

At +2 Attack, All-Out Pummeling OHKOes troublesome walls such as physically defensive Celesteela and Corviknight. Spirit Break notably breaks Mega Sableye, enabling Iron Valiant to greatly pressure Dark and Ghost teams. Knock Off deals with Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Aegislash, allowing Iron Valiant to heavily dent Steel. It also removes important items from Clodsire, Klefki, and Toxapex. Shadow Sneak can be used over Knock Off to pick off weakened foes like Spectrier and Blacephalon. lron Valiant loves Klefki's ability to set dual screens and Spikes, as this allows Iron Valiant to set up more easily and deal with bulkier cores better. Tapu Lele sets Psychic terrain, neutralizing Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, and it also deals with Poison-types Iron Valiant has a hard time with, such as Mega Venusaur and Toxapex. Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain activates Iron Valiant's Quark Drive, letting it outspeed the likes of Mega Lopunny and Mega Swampert under rain. Tapu Bulu improves the Water and Ground matchups and removes bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo. Mega Diancie and Azumarill love Iron Valiant's ability to soften walls, as it allows them to clean up late-game.</p> "
