        "description": "<p>Iron Valiant's combination of stats, typing, and coverage makes it an excellent wallbreaker for Fairy teams, capable of outrunning Mega Diancie, Nihilego, and Iron Treads. At +2 Attack, All-Out Pummeling OHKOes troublesome walls such as physically defensive Celesteela and Corviknight. Spirit Break notably breaks Mega Sableye, enabling Iron Valiant to greatly pressure Dark and Ghost teams. Knock Off deals with Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Aegislash, allowing Iron Valiant to heavily dent Steel. It also removes important items from Clodsire, Klefki, and Toxapex. Shadow Sneak can be used over Knock Off to pick off weakened foes like Spectrier and Blacephalon. lron Valiant loves Klefki's ability to set dual screens and Spikes, as this allows Iron Valiant to set up more easily and deal with bulkier cores better. Tapu Lele sets Psychic terrain, neutralizing Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, and it also deals with Poison-types Iron Valiant has a hard time with, such as Mega Venusaur and Toxapex. Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain activates Iron Valiant's Quark Drive, letting it outspeed the likes of Mega Lopunny and Mega Swampert under rain. Tapu Bulu improves the Water and Ground matchups and removes bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo. Mega Diancie and Azumarill love Iron Valiant's ability to soften walls, as it allows them to clean up late-game.</p> "
