        "description": "<p>Mega Charizard X is a ferocious wallbreaker and setup sweeper, aiding Fire teams in matchups like Dragon, Fire, and Electric. Tough Claws-boosted Flare Blitz fires off nuclear-powered attacks, heavily denting walls such as Mandibuzz, Gliscor, and Mega Sableye. Dragon Claw, also powered up by Tough Claws, threatens Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Kommo-o. Earthquake threatens switch-ins like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Heatran, while Roost increases Mega Charizard X's longevity and mitigate recoil damage from Flare Blitz. Alternatively, Thunder Punch may be used to deal more damage to Slowbro, Pelipper, and Tapu Fini while still retaining super effective coverage against Toxapex. Volcarona is an exceptional teammate, as it threatens physical walls such as Slowbro, Toxapex, and Hippowdon after a Quiver Dance. Torkoal supports Mega Charizard X with sun to boost Flare Blitz's power and remove rain, Stealth Rock to wear down switch-ins, and Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards. Rotom-H sets up Reflect and Light Screen to ease Mega Charizard X's setup process and offers pivoting with Volt Switch. Choice Scarf Blacephalon is a great late-game cleaner and is appreciated to wear down troublesome walls like Skeledirge and Slowbro as well as cripple Toxapex and Porygon2 with Trick. Heatran traps and withers down Toxapex with Magma Storm and prevents Stealth Rock from being set up using Taunt. Cinderace provides entry hazard control with Court Change and brings Mega Charizard X in using U-turn.</p> "

Its Flying typing also grants an invaluable Ground immunity for Electric teams. Hurricane is Zapdos's most powerful move, threatening a variety of Pokemon that resist or are immune to Electric such as Mega Venusaur and Gastrodon. Heat Wave beats Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Iron Treads, and Ferrothorn, thus making it an incredible asset in the Steel and Grass matchups. Hidden Power Ice cleanly OHKOes Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp; alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be used if reliably eliminating Gastrodon and Swampert is more important. Volt Switch lets Zapdos switch out of its checks like Tyranitar and Blissey, keeping momentum in favor of Zapdos's team. As dangerous as Zapdos is, it is highly susceptible to Stealth Rock; hence, Rotom-W is a great partner that can use Defog while also helping Zapdos beat Ground-types thanks to Hydro Pump. Iron Hands and Zeraora help Zapdos wallbreak by wearing down special walls like Heatran, Blissey, and Clodsire. Regieleki and Alolan Raichu can take advantage of Zapdos weakening teams and removing Ground-types so that they can clean up with their deadly Rising Voltage later in the game.</p> "

Knock Off hinders Chansey and Porygon2 for Mega Sableye's wallbreaking teammates and eases the matchup against Landorus and Nidoking. Due to Sableye's meager HP and need for longevity, Recover's a must-have utility option, further enabling Metal Burst. Protect allows Sableye to Mega Evolve safely, ensuring it can utilize Magic Bounce later into the game. Metal Burst retaliates against Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie, while Dazzling Gleam eliminates Mega Sableye's passivity in front of Hydreigon and Roaring Moon. Will-O-Wisp in conjunction with Prankster renders physical attackers like Mega Gallade, Dragonite, and Mamoswine less threatening. The given EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Life Orb Nidoking's Earth Power, assuming Mega Sableye uses Knock Off after the first Earth Power. Mimikyu threatens Dark-types such as Mandibuzz, Galarian Moltres, and opposing Mega Sableye. Spectrier breaks past walls like Toxapex, Gliscor, and Tapu Fini and appreciates Mega Sableye burning offensive threats to strengthen its setup potential. Gholdengo checks Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, and Iron Valiant as well as preventing foes from removing entry hazards set by Froslass and Galarian Corsola. Blacephalon handles opposing Gholdengo and utilizes Choice Scarf to clean through Steel, Ghost, and Psychic teams once Heatran, Mega Sableye, and Galarian Slowking, respectively, are removed. Skeledirge has great synergy with Mega Sableye, appreciating the prevention of opposing Stealth Rock and in return walling Volcarona, Mega Lopunny, and Alolan Ninetales.</p> "

Mega Diancie punishes opponents trying to set up entry hazards against Klefki and beats Fire-types such as Heatran and Mega Charizard Y.

Diamond Storm does considerable damage to special walls like Blissey and Alolan Muk and can also provide a Defense boost.

Earth Power deals heavy damage to Steel-type Pokemon like Heatran and Iron Treads and is paired nicely with Mystical Fire to damage Skarmory and Corviknight. On a hyper offensive team, Mega Diancie runs four attacks for coverage. With Shuckle's Sticky Web up, its good Speed tier becomes more devastating and outspeeds Pokemon like Mega Gallade and Zeraora. Mega Diancie also pairs well with Omastar and Terrakion, as Omastar takes care of the Ground matchup with a well-timed Shell Smash, while Terrakion's access to Earthquake and Close Combat takes care of most Steel-types. On bulky offense, Mega Diancie prefers to run Spikes, as the chip damage sets up a potential late-game cleanup from more offensive Pokemon on the team like Terrakion and Nihilego.

Stealth Rock can be used to allow Mega Diancie to set its own hazard, but four attacks are recommended given Mega Diancie's wide coverage. Klefki provides Spikes and dual screens support which allows Mega Diancie to OHKO threats like Gholdengo, and it can also carry Thunder Wave to let Mega Diancie outspeed and take out threats like Mega Gallade and Spectrier. Tapu Koko takes on Water-types and aids in the Steel matchup by forcing out Corviknight and Celesteela. Tapu Bulu counters Ground- and Water-types like Great Tusk and Urshifu-R, while Tapu Lele takes on Poison-types and prevents priority moves from Azumarill and Mega Scizor. Iron Valiant is a great partner for the Steel matchup, but it also benefits from Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain to outspeed and take out faster threats such as Zeraora and Greninja.

Greninja checks Ground-types like Clodsire, Garchomp, and Landorus and aids in the Flying matchup. Urshifu-R checks Pokemon like Kyurem and Hydreigon, which take advantage of Toxapex.
