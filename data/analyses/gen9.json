However, the loss of coverage against targets such as Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo is noticeable. Tera Normal turns Extreme Speed into an incredibly powerful STAB priority move capable of shredding offensive teams after a single boost, and a timely typing change also removes Dragonite's weaknesses to Ice, Fairy, and Dragon, which can buy a free turn to set up. An Adamant nature is preferred since it maximizes the power of Extreme Speed, which often makes makes Speed stats irrelevant, but a Jolly nature can also be used to outspeed the Normal-immune Dragapult after a Dragon Dance, which is especially useful if Dragonite is running Ice Spinner.</p> <p>Offensive Dragon Dance Dragonite regularly serves as a potent win con on offensive teams that can also act as a revenge killer against fast and frail threats. Multiscale Dragonite's considerable bulk, as well as Ghost immunity with Tera Normal provides significant defensive utility for offensive teams. In particular, teams using frail offensive Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and Iron Valiant appreciate the defensive utility Dragonite brings. In return, these Pokemon can help wallbreak for a late-game Dragonite sweep. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, or Garchomp is appreciated to weaken Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and Iron Valiant into range of boosted Extreme Speed. Dual screens support from Grimmsnarl and Shed Tail support from Orthworm are potential options that can supplement Dragonite's already great bulk and virtually guarantee the ability to acquire multiple boosts. Since Dragonite struggles against bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo and Skeledirge, a teammate that can switch into and check these Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, is appreciated. Rotom-W can cripple these physical walls with Trick, gain momentum against them with Volt Switch, and absorb Will-O-Wisp from Skeledirge.</p> "

          "description": "<p>With the combination of its solid natural bulk, valuable typing, reliable recovery in Roost, and Multiscale, Dragonite can accrue multiple Dragon Dance boosts and become a dangerous bulky setup sweeper. It can set up on common Pokemon such as Great Tusk lacking Bulk Up or Ice Spinner, non-Will-O-Wisp Volcarona, and even super effective attacks from Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult thanks to Multiscale. Extreme Speed alongside Tera Normal lets Dragonite clean up late-game, OHKOing faster threats like Meowscarada and potentially Chien-Pao and Cinderace at +1. It also outprioritizes Chien-Pao's Ice Shard and Meowscarada's Sucker Punch as well as Grimmsnarl's Prankster-boosted Reflect and Thunder Wave. Earthquake covers Normal-resistant and -immune Pokemon, including foes like Dragapult, non-Air Balloon Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Kingambit. 144 HP EVs allow Dragonite to survive Tera Fairy Iron Valiant's Moonblast at +1 through Multiscale and Tera Fairy Espathra's Dazzling Gleam after minor chip damage breaking Multiscale. Aside from strengthening Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Tera Normal sheds off its weaknesses to give it setup opportunities against would-be threats like Chien-Pao, Dragapult, and Hatterene. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Multiscale intact by ignoring Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Bulky Dragon Dance Dragonite fits well on bulky offense. A defensive backbone consisting of Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Gholdengo, and Corviknight is valuable to check threats like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao, respectively, which would threaten Dragonite prior to boosting; in return, Dragonite can answer threats like Roaring Moon, Cinderace, and Volcarona for them. Garchomp, Glimmora, and Ting-Lu can reliably set entry hazards, which rack up chip damage onto walls such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Garganacl and puts revenge killers like Iron Valiant and Chien-Pao into guaranteed KO range of +1 Tera Normal Extreme Speed. Wallbreakers such as Breloom, Chien-Pao, and Great Tusk can punch holes early-game and overwhelm Dragonite's checks, such as Corviknight, Dondozo, Skeledirge, and defensive Great Tusk. Moreover, Breloom can incapacitate foes with Spore to give setup opportunities for Dragonite, while Great Tusk can use Knock Off to cripple Corviknight and Dondozo and pop Gholdengo's Air Balloon. Other setup sweepers are great partners; Volcarona can threaten Corviknight, use Tera Steel Rotom-W as setup fodder, and spread burns with Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp against physical attackers such as Iron Valiant, Iron Hands, and Roaring Moon to further support Dragonite.</p> "

Against either option, Encore can turn Dragonite practically invincible allowing it to reside on the field indefinitely in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire Spin</strong>: This allows Dragonite to defeat almost any Pokemon universally by simply making full use of its longevity. Trapping an Encore locked Pokemon in the field is also highly valuable. Fire Spin is used instead of Wrap because it affects Ghost-types and doesn't trigger chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore and Thunder Wave</strong>: Encore is most effective against slower foes. Thunder Wave allows Dragonite to lock a much wider variety of Pokemon into their moves, while also giving it more opportunities to keep Multiscale up via potential paralysis.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute adds to Dragonite's longevity. Baiting a status move such as Toxic or Yawn, blocking it with Substitute, and locking the move in with Encore guarantees Dragonite an active Substitute while defeating the opposing Pokemon. Most notably, managing to leave a Substitute against Garganacl's Salt Cure or Corviknight's U-turn gains a lot of momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draco Meteor: Draco Meteor is a powerful move that can catch opposing Dragon-types off- guard and snatch a surprise KO. This Dragonite set has more than enough capability to run the timer out, so guaranteeing the number advantage is significant. It is also a significantly better offensive option against opposing Dragonite, which can avoid Encore via the use of Extreme Speed, raise its own Speed with Dragon Dance, and ignore Thunder Wave with the common Lum Berry.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Fairy</strong>: Due to Dragonite’'s low Speed compared to other Dragon-types, it has a difficult time without a Fairy Tera type.</li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: In order to make the most use of Encore, max Speed is recommended.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Bold</strong>: A more defensive spread lets Dragonite preserve Terastallization against certain physical attackers, which makes it a noteworthy choice. In particular, max Defense Dragonite can use Roost to mitigate the damage from Choice Band Meowscarada without needing to Terastallize, and Substitute can survive Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers Generally, Leftovers preserves Dragonite’'s longevity best, as it cancels out the damage from Sandstorm and makes timer stall easier. However, the increased usage of entry hazard setter Garchomp makes Heavy-Duty Boots a strong option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet: Rocky Helmet makes it easier for Dragonite to defeat Pokemon such as opposing Dragonite, Kingambit, and Meowscarada, and its residual damage can be used to execute a win condition, especially for sets that choose not to run Fire Spin.</p> </li> </ul> "

Earthquake helps Dragonite eliminate Normal-resistant Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Heatran. Roost improves Dragonite's longevity and enables it to acquire multiple boosts against passive opponents. Roost lets Dragonite check Volcarona and rain sweepers such as Barraskewda throughout the entire match. Ice Spinner is another choice that clears the priority-blocking Psychic Terrain and hits Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Dragapult super effectively. Fire Punch can be used to hit bulky Steel-types not weak to Ground such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. An Adamant nature is usually preferred to maximize Extreme Speed's damage output, but a Jolly nature enables Dragonite to outspeed Tapu Koko and the Normal-immune Dragapult after a single Dragon Dance. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures that Dragonite will always retain Multiscale even if entry hazards are up, but if the team's entry hazard control is good, Silk Scarf is another option that boosts Extreme Speed's power. Dragonite fits well on offensive teams as a priority-using revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk and Garchomp can help chip down bulky targets such as opposing Great Tusk into range of its attacks. Tapu Lele poses a serious threat to Dragonite, as not only does its Psychic Terrain block Extreme Speed on grounded targets, but with a Choice Scarf it can also outspeed and deal massive damage to Dragonite even after setup, especially if Dragonite has not Terastallized yet. Gholdengo is a good partner, as it can switch in on and threaten Tapu Lele and prevent the opponent from removing entry hazards. Dragonite often struggles against Unaware users such as Dondozo and Skeledirge, so Pokemon that can grab momentum against them are appreciated teammates. Rotom-W and Tapu Koko can come relatively freely on Dondozo and threaten it with a Volt Switch while Heatran and Mega Diancie can switch into and set up Stealth Rock against Skeledirge. Strong wallbreakers like Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, and Zamazenta all take advantage of Pokemon that Dragonite tends to struggle with, such as Dondozo, allowing it to sweep more easily late-game.</p> "

U-turn allows it to serve as a pivot: easily switching it out of checks such as Gholdengo, Urshifu-R, and Mega Charizard Y, it brings in teammates like Tapu Koko and Dragapult to deal with them. Close Combat can be used to dispose of Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran much more quickly, greatly denting them on the switch. The given EV spread allows Mega Scizor to survive two Close Combats from Mega Lopunny after Stealth Rock and outspeed uninvested Heatran, with the HP and Special Defense EVs helping it check Tapu Lele and Espathra. Mega Scizor's pivot support is extremely valuable to Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Zamazenta, which all also appreciate how well it exploits defensive Pokemon such as Clodsire, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T. Rotom-W forms a strong VoltTurn core with Mega Scizor as well, with both pivoting out on their checks and racking up solid chip damage over time. Nasty Plot Tornadus-T appreciates Mega Scizor pressuring specially defensive walls and offensive Pokemon like Weavile and Clodsire, letting it go all-in as an offensive wallbreaker with ease. Mega Scizor wearing down Rotom-W and Heatran is also particularly useful for Tornadus-T, as these Pokemon can heavily damage or cripple Tornadus-T in one way or another. Mega Scizor being completely countered by Gholdengo mandates a Pursuit trapper like Weavile or Kingambit to pressure it. Skeledirge also hard counters Mega Scizor, encouraging the aforementioned teammates as well as Garganacl and Heatran.</p> "

          "description": "<p>This set takes on a much more offensive role, using its solid defensive typing for easy entry points against Pokemon like Weavile, Kingambit, and Espathra, setting up, and threatening the vast majority of the metagame with its strong Technician-boosted attacks. Close Combat KOes Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn, as well as providing a strong neutral hit against Rotom-W. Dual Wingbeat hits Clodsire and Toxapex for reliable neutral damage, hits Zamazenta super effectively, and breaks Substitute against Shed Tail hyper offense teams and Dragon Dance Dragapult. Knock Off is an alternative to hit Gholdengo reliably and remove items like Leftovers from Rotom-W and Heavy-Duty Boots from Tornadus-T, Skeledirge, and Volcarona. This allows a teammate or Mega Scizor to wear them down much more easily. Knock Off is especially relevant in Rotom-W's case, as removing Leftovers makes it easier to put into KO range of +2 Close Combat. Running Knock Off makes Toxapex a much worse matchup, however, so Pokemon like Great Tusk and Tapu Koko that can pressure it are appreciated. Sand Tomb can be used to reliably beat Clodsire, Toxapex, and Gholdengo, preventing them from reliably checking it. Offensive Mega Scizor fits much better on hyper offense teams, which appreciate its incredibly valuable—though short-term—defensive utility. Grimmsnarl is a perfect teammate, providing dual screens to let it set up against foes like Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Landorus-T; it also pivots Mega Scizor in and appreciates it baiting in Gholdengo, which prevents Grimmsnarl from pivoting as effectively. Gholdengo itself is also a notable partner, as it appreciates Mega Scizor dispatching the most popular Dark-types in Weavile and Kingambit. Entry hazards from suicide leads like Landorus-T and Garchomp allow Mega Scizor to clean late-game, as its foes must be chipped before any sweeping is done. Entry hazards particularly help in wearing down checks like Urshifu-R and bulkier Garchomp sets. Mega Scizor struggles against bulky Steel-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-W and Volcarona; Dragonite and Dragapult can take care of the latter, switching into Volcarona to set up as it switches into Mega Scizor, whereas Great Tusk can remove Leftovers from the former, making it easier for Mega Scizor to dispatch with +2 Close Combat. Physically defensive Unaware walls in Skeledirge and Dondozo completely wall Mega Scizor, so offensive Pokemon that can bait in or wear down these foes, including Calm Mind Espathra and Iron Valiant, make for solid partners.</p> "

Its physical bulk combined with Scald lets it check and potentially cripple foes such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, and Great Tusk. Hurricane is an alternative to Defog on teams that use Tornadus-T for entry hazard control, which offers better neutral coverage and the ability to hit foes such as Tangrowth and Tera Grass Heatran. Pelipper also operates as a slow pivot with U-turn, which is greatly appreciated by the team's wallbreakers to ensure that they can enter the field safely. Tera Ground offers an Electric immunity for threats such as Tapu Koko, whereas Tera Steel offers a strong defensive typing, letting Pelipper check Pokemon like Extreme Speed Dragonite in a pinch. As the premier rain setter, Pokemon that rely on rain to boost their power or operate effectively within it, such as Mega Swampert, Floatzel, Barraskewda, and Urshifu-R, make for common teammates. Mega Swampert offers a valuable Electric immunity for Pelipper, checking foes such as Tapu Koko. Tornadus-T can provide entry hazard control with Defog, letting Pelipper enter the field and summon rain without having to fear taking hazard damage. Ferrothorn takes advantage of Pelipper's typing and ability to form a solid defensive core and provide a robust blanket check for opposing rain. In return, Pelipper alleviates Ferrothorn's massive Fire weakness by setting rain, and it can check threats that Ferrothorn fails to cover, such as Mega Lopunny.</p> "

Clodsire, the most noteworthy special wall in the format, can fall to an Analytic-boosted Flash Cannon or Steel Beam when carrying Choice Specs.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: A Fairy-type Tera Blast is very useful against common Dragon-types, most notably Garchomp and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting: Gaining a resistance to Dark allows Magnezone to surprise and defeat Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass: Grass has excellent defensive and offense synergy with Magnezone, especially through its utility against Ground-type attackers and Spore immunity. Most notably, Tera Blast Grass can OHKO max SpD Hippowdon with Choice Specs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying: Flying has wonderful defensive synergy with Magnezone, reversing its Ground and Fighting weaknesses, and lets Tera Blast hit Grass-types harder.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Offensively, Water serves a similar role to Grass, letting Tera Blast nail Ground-types. Water lacks a Ground resistance or a Spore immunity, but it gives Magnezone a much-appreciated Fire resistance for Pokemon like Skeledirge. Much like in the case of Grass, Tera Blast Water can OHKO Hippowdon, while also having the possibility of KOing Unaware Clodsire, although the risk it runs when considering Water Absorb should be noted.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel: The boost from Tera Steel makes Steel Beam absurdly powerful, with Analytic letting Choice Specs Magnezone OHKO even offensive Multiscale Dragonite!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Modest: Running at least some Speed investment lets Magnezone outspeed critical Pokemon like Azumarill, Corviknight, Skeledirge, and Kingambit. 252 EVs give Magnezone a chance at outspeeding slow Mimikyu, Dragonite, Gholdengo, and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 252 SpA / 60 Spe with Modest: Magnezone's excellent typing means you often switch it into attacks, especially if you aren’t using Sturdy as an ability. This spread sacrifices some of Magnezone's Speed to raise its capabilities as a pivot. However, reducing the Speed EVs below 60 is not recommended, as it is the minimum required line to outspeed an uninvested Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs gives Magnezone a devastating amount of power, with even Clodsire having trouble handling it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: The increase in special bulk helps Magnezone against the myriad of choice item special attacking Dragon-types, like Hydreigon and Dragapult.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Analytic: A Magnezone boosted by both Choice Specs and Analytic is incredibly hard to switch into, making it easier for Magnezone to generate momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: With Sturdy's guaranteed survivability and Magnezone's high damage output, Magnezone will very likely take down at least one Pokemon per game. Sturdy also helps Magnezone play around Dondozo, as it can safely come in on Fissure and use Volt Switch against it, which renders Yawn moot. However, if Magnezone switches into a Yawn and not Fissure, it should be noted that Dondozo often runs Protect to block Volt Switch and ensure Magnezone falls asleep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Magnet Pull</strong>: Magnet Pull ensures Magnezone can eliminate Corviknight. In the case Magnezone uses Fighting as its Tera Type, Magnet Pull also allows it to beat both Kingambit and Tera Steel Hydreigon with more reliability.</p> </li> </ul> "

Fire Blast can be slotted over Flamethrower to hit much harder, notably OHKOing most variants of Gholdengo, but Flamethrower is usually better because of its consistency. Volcarona can utilize Giga Drain with Tera Grass to hit a plethora of Water-type Pokemon like Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Urshifu-R hard, in addition to Ground- and Rock-types such as Great Tusk and Garganacl. Hidden Power Ground and Tera Ground help Volcarona bypass checks like Toxapex and Heatran after slight chip damage while also removing Volcaronra’s glaring Rock weakness. Psychic with Tera Psychic allows Volcarona to break through Clodsire and Toxapex more reliably, but it is inferior to either of the previously mentioned Tera types due to its greater vulnerability to being revenge killed, and it leaves Volcarona completely stonewalled by Heatran. Flame Body can threaten to burn physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Zamazenta, crippling them. Maximum Speed investment and a Timid Nature lets Volcarona outrun Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R after a boost. Modest can be run to hit walls like Clodsire and Toxapex harder, but it leaves Volcarona much more vulnerable to the aforementioned Choice Scarf users. Volcarona’s defensive utility is appreciated by allies such as Urshifu-R and Kingambit, as it can check dangerous Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta in a pinch. Bulky Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp can use it as setup fodder—with the latter additionally threatening Volcarona’s longevity with Toxic—so allies that can handle them such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W are great partners to support Volcarona in its sweep. Heatran and Toxapex wall Volcarona if it doesn’t have Hidden Power Ground, so teammates like that can check them such as Garchomp and the aforementioned Rotom-W are much appreciated. Heatran also makes for a great ally, as it can eliminate or cripple Toxapex, Clodsire, and Skeledirge, which clears the way for Volcarona to clean up late-game.</p> "

The given Speed EVs allow Volcarona to outspeed Dragapult after a Quiver Dance, with the rest invested in HP and Defense so that it will always be 3HKOed by Zamazenta and defensive Great Tusk’s Earthquake. Volcarona struggles with status conditions, as they can hinder its ability to check threats like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant in the long term, thus status absorbers like Gliscor and Toxapex make good partners; the former provides Defog support, a Knock Off absorber, and a Heatran check, and the latter helps prepare Volcarona’s sweep with Knock Off and status inducement.

This allows it to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Dragapult and Zamazenta and pivot around powerful attackers such as Iron Valiant. Scald and Knock Off allow Toxapex to meaningfully threaten foes and make progress by either causing crippling status or removing the foe's item respectively, while Toxic takes advantage of Toxapex's excellent bulk and Regenerator, putting foes on a timer for its teammates. Haze removes boosts from the likes of Dragon Dance Dragapult and Espathra. Other options such as Toxic Spikes and Baneful Bunker can be explored over either Toxic or Haze, with the intent to cripple offensive teams or maximize Toxapex's ability to scout and pivot, respectively. However, removing Toxic leaves Toxapex worse off against common Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Rotom-W, while removing Haze makes it harder to handle setup sweepers. Although Toxapex rarely Terastallizes, Tera Dragon ensures Rotom-W's Volt Switch never outdamages Regenerator while also removing its Ground and Electric weaknesses against the likes of Great Tusk and Tapu Koko. The EV spread maximizes Toxapex's physical Bulk while allowing it to survive two Scorching Sands from Mega Charizard Y. Toxapex fits best on defensively oriented teams, which don't mind its passivity and can make up for any of its defensive shortcomings. Toxapex pairs well with Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Clodsire, which can handle setup sweepers that Toxapex falters to such as Kingambit and Gholdengo. In return, Toxapex sponges various weaker attacks using Regenerator from the likes of Gastrodon and Rotom-W. Toxapex dislikes losing its item, as it can easily be pushed into KO range against wallbreakers such as Zamazenta and Dragapult alongside entry hazards. As such, Pokemon that can generally withstand Knock Off well, such as Flyinium Z Tornadus-T and Gliscor, pair excellently with it. Tornadus-T in particular makes for a great partner, as it can use Regenerator alongside Toxapex, pivoting between each other to handle Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Garganacl. Toxapex appreciates extra insurance against strong special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. As such, Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Heatran pair well, especially since Toxapex can switch into the Shadow Balls and Focus Blasts aimed that them respectively.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Possessing OU's highest unboosted Speed tier makes Choice Specs Dragapult a very remarkable special wallbreaker, revenge killer, and offensive pivot. It outspeeds and threatens common offensive threats like Cinderace, Iron Moth, and even boosted foes like Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. Moreover, it's immune or resistant to common priority attacks like the aforementioned Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Breloom's Mach Punch, and Slither Wing's First Impression, which makes it much harder to revenge kill. It is also able to switch into and check Rotom-W. A coverage move in either Flamethrower or Thunder lets Dragapult nail Corviknight, with the former also hitting other Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads, while the latter pressures Toxapex and Tera Water Garganacl. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to bypass Grimmsnarl's dual screens, Orthworm's Shed Tail, and Substitute users like Gholdengo, which gives it an edge against hyper offense teams. Tera Ghost maintains an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and strengthens Shadow Ball—its most spammable attack—notably guaranteeing the 2HKO on Corviknight and Assault Vest Iron Treads after Terastallizing. Tera Fairy prevents Dragapult from being picked off by opposing Dragapult and Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Meowscarada. Finally, Tera Dragon turns Draco Meteor into an even more powerful nuke. This takes advantage of the lack of prominent bulky Steel- and Fairy-types in the metagame, notably chunking answers to Ghost-types like Purifying Salt Garganacl and Ting-Lu and 2HKOing Unaware Clodsire.</p> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult fits perfectly on bulky offense and VoltTurn teams. Physical wallbreakers like Chien-Pao and Great Tusk appreciate Dragapult's U-turn bringing them in safely, and they are able to pressure its switch-ins like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Garganacl. Entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Great Tusk allow Dragapult to pivot throughout the game unperturbed; the former can also pivot it in safely via U-turn, letting it threaten Gholdengo, which tends to switch into Corviknight to block its Defog. Furthermore, Corviknight and Great Tusk provide the necessary defensive backbone to switch into boosted threats such as Roaring Moon, as well as revenge kill attempts from Sucker Punch users like Kingambit and Chien-Pao. Gholdengo forms a Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can overwhelm a shared check in Ting-Lu, use non-Calm Mind Blissey as setup fodder, and either cripple Tera Water Garganacl with Trick or straight up dent Tera Fairy variants. Entry hazards from Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Garganacl can quickly put foes into Dragapult's KO range, especially as it tends to force a lot of switches; in return, Dragapult spinblocks foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch. Setup sweepers like Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Swords Dance Chien-Pao appreciate Dragapult wallbreaking early-game for them to clean up late-game easily.</p> "

          "name": "Choice Band",
          "description": "<p>Choice Band Dragapult utilizes its near-unresisted STAB moves, its blistering Speed stat, and its excellent Attack stat to function as a strong physical wallbreaker. The choice for the second move depends on what Tera type Dragapult chooses. Tera Dragon Dragapult uses Phantom Force for a Ghost-type STAB move, but Tera Ghost uses Tera Blast, since, unlike Phantom Force, it is not a two-turn move. Sucker Punch allows Dragapult to revenge kill weakened sweepers such as opposing Dragapult, as well as Iron Moth and Tera Flying Roaring Moon after some chip damage. However, be careful when using Sucker Punch, since opponents can predict it and set up. An Adamant nature gives Dragapult extra wallbreaking power, at the cost of being outsped by threats like Chien-Pao. Alternatively, a Jolly nature allows Dragapult to outspeed the entirety of the unboosted metagame. With Tera Dragon, Dragapult's Dragon Darts becomes harder to switch into; it 2HKOes walls Dragapult normally struggles with such as Ting-Lu. Tera Dragon Dragapult is also less susceptible to Sucker Punch, albeit at the cost of losing its immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is a fantastic partner, since it's able to check Dark-types such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Hazard removal from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for good partners, since Dragapult's lack of longevity makes it difficult to switch in when hazards are up. Great Tusk and Corviknight are able to beat both Scizor and opposing Great Tusk, while Cinderace can threaten bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight. Dragapult benefits from entry hazards from the likes of Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, since it can more effectively wallbreak with entry hazards up. Other pivots such as Scizor and Rotom-W appreciate that Dragapult's U-turn can bring them in. In return, Scizor can revenge kill Ice-types such as Chien-Pao, while Rotom-W can check both Corviknight and defensive Great Tusk. Paralysis support from Rotom-W can shutdown offensive Pokemon like opposing Dragapult and Roaring Moon. Lastly, Gholdengo makes for a good teammate, since it can spinblock and deny Defog and can help Dragapult overwhelm shared checks like Kingambit and Ting-Lu.</p> "

          "name": "Utility",
          "description": "<p>Unlike its more offensively oriented Choice item sets, this Dragapult set goes for a more multifunctional approach. Dragapult's unmatched Speed tier, in conjunction with STAB Dragon Darts, allows it to snipe key offensive threats such as Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Cinderace with some prior chip damage. This often means that Dragapult will force a lot of switches which can be capitalized on with Will-O-Wisp to spread status and power up Hex. Will-O-Wisp also allows Dragapult to avoid Sucker Punch, which can come in handy against Cinderace, Kingambit, and Meowscarada. With a burn and Stealth Rock up, Hex 2HKOs Defensive Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Dondozo, allowing Dragapult to pick apart balanced cores. Finally, U-Turn rounds out the set, letting Dragapult keep momentum up even against hard counters like Ting-Lu and Garganacl. 252 Speed EVs with a Hasty nature ensure that Dragapult outspeeds the entire unboosted tier. 76 Attack EVs ensure an OHKO on Roaring Moon with Dragon Darts, while the rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack. Although Dragapult does not typically find itself needing to Terastallize very often, Ghost is most commonly used to power up Hex even further. For example, Tera Ghost Hex does a minimum of 84% to a burnt Defensive Great Tusk. In a pinch however, Terastallization can be used defensively to avoid OHKOs like from Chien-Pao's Ice Shard.</p> <p>Because of the amount of utility it provides, Dragapult appreciates plentiful chip damage from its teammates, as it lacks immediate power. All forms of entry hazards are greatly appreciated due to Dragapult's ability to force out the opponent, so entry hazard setters like Garganacl, Great Tusk, Glimmora and Ting-Lu form good teammates. Stealth Rock is particularly important since it secures important 2HKOs with Hex. Among the entry hazard setters, Garganacl has fantastic synergy with Dragapult, as it is able to set up Stealth Rock while also chipping down foes with Salt Cure. Partners that can spread status such as Rotom-W and Skeledirge are also excellent teammates. Since Ting-Lu and Garganacl stonewall this set, teammates that scare them out such as Offensive Great Tusk and Banded Meowscarada are great partners. Tera Flying Covert Cloak Gholdengo forms a particularly potent Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can turn common counters to Dragapult such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl into setup fodder. Physical sweepers like Chien-Pao and Kingambit appreciate having their counters like Corviknight and Great Tusk crippled with burns and have solid type synergy with Dragapult. Due to this set being most potent in the mid- to late-game, it's more at home in teams with solid defensive backbones that can sponge hits. Defensive pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Hatterene, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Amoonguss can all soak damage for Dragapult from common checks like Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit while setting up entry hazards, spreading status, or dealing chip damage, allowing Dragapult to clean up later in the game.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Dragapult is one of the most dangerous setup sweepers in the tier due to its blazing Speed and immense power. After a Dragon Dance, Dragapult outspeeds all Choice Scarf and Booster Energy users, such as Kartana, Greninja, and Iron Valiant, making it extremely hard to stop if it sets up successfully. Ghostium Z-powered Phantom Force enables a boosted Dragapult to blast through bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Heatran after slight chip damage. Dragapult's typing gives it opportunities to switch in and set up against certain Pokemon such as Volcarona, non-Ice Spinner Dragonite, and Urshifu-R locked into a Fighting-type move. Substitute is the preferred option in the last moveslot to ease prediction and facilitate setup while also avoiding priority. Substitute also allows Dragapult to play mind games with Kingambit. Fire Blast is another option that allows Dragapult to deal massive damage to physically defensive Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, both of which can survive a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare at full health. Clear Body is the preferred ability to avoid stat drops from Intimidate, but Infiltrator can also be used to improve the matchup against dual screens and Shed Tail teams. A Jolly nature lets Dragapult outspeed Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko prior to setting up. Dragon Dance Dragapult fits best on offensive teams, where it can function as a potent late-game cleaner with its Z-Move. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Glimmora can help chip bulky foes such as Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit into range of Dragapult's attacks. Gholdengo can block attempts to remove entry hazards, as well as pressure certain physical walls that give Dragapult a hard time, such as Ferrothorn. Dragapult can struggle with bulky physical walls such as Dondozo, Garganacl, and post-Tera Skeledirge, so powerful special wallbreakers that can take advantage of these Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y, are greatly appreciated. Tapu Lele also provides Psychic Terrain, which thwarts revenge killing attempts from priority moves. A late-game cleaner such as Dragonite or Booster Energy Iron Valiant can take advantage of the holes Dragapult left behind in the enemy defensive core.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Despite Hex Dragapult's lack of immediate offensive presence, it can be a very annoying threat; it excels in getting around many of Dragapult's normal checks and counters, pivoting to dangerous teammates, and spreading status. Against common checks like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Toxapex, it can bring in Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Great Tusk, and Tapu Koko, respectively, to punish the opponent. Will-O-Wisp boosts Hex to monstrous levels and threatens to pacify physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Kingambit. Dragon Darts is a strong physical move to better hit special walls like Clodsire, forcing it to recover lest Dragapult's teammates like Iron Valiant break through. With Tera Ghost, it can muscle through specially defensive Toxapex after burn and entry hazard damage with Hex, though Tera Fairy helps it tank hits from opposing Dragapult and Dark-type moves like Pursuit, and it can still check Zamazenta. Infiltrator allows it to check threats behind Substitutes, most notably Iron Defense Zamazenta and Shed Tail receivers like Dragonite. Dragapult struggles to break through Heatran, so Pokemon that can pressure it such as Garchomp and Rotom-W are great partners. It also must be careful around Pursuit trappers like Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar, as even after a burn they heavily chip it; teammates like Urshifu-R, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk are thus mandatory to threaten said trappers. Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y very much appreciate Dragapult crippling and weakening Kingambit and Tyranitar, respectively, as this aids in the process of removing them. In return, Dragapult can clean up the opposing team after its checks are gone. Pivots like Rotom-W and Corviknight bring Dragapult in, with the former checking Heatran and forming a nice VoltTurn core with it, and the latter tanking Dragon- and Fairy-type moves for it. Entry hazards and Knock Off from the likes of Ferrothorn and Great Tusk weaken the opposition for Dragapult to clean, notably its checks like Toxapex and Clodsire.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Dragapult is a menacing wallbreaker, being able to threaten many teams with its STAB Shadow Ball and Draco Meteor. The former in particular is very spammable, as only a limited pool of Pokemon can switch into it. U-turn takes advantage of this limited pool, pressuring Shadow Ball switch-ins like Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar while bringing in teammates such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Flamethrower hits Kingambit for massive damage, while Hydro Pump helps against Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu. Finally, Thunder pressures would-be checks, such as Toxapex. Ghost is the best Tera type for Dragapult, as it propels its Shadow Ball to a near-unstoppable level, making it even more spammable. Dragon boosts Draco Meteor's damage while making Dragapult less susceptible to Pursuit, while Tera Fairy purely helps it defensively: not only does it not fear Pursuit, but it's also not weak to Ice Shard or Sucker Punch from Weavile and Kingambit, respectively. Finally, it gives Dragapult a Dragon immunity, which allows you to beat Dragon Dance Dragapult after it burns the Z-Move. Dragapult must be wary of Pursuit from Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit, as they can both shrug off multiple Shadow Balls and remove it from the game. However, it can pivot around its checks, so Pokemon that can take advantage of and remove them make great partners, such as Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant. The latter two also share checks with Dragapult, like Clodsire and Toxapex, meaning they can overwhelm these checks. Dragapult also greatly appreciates Knock Off support from Tornadus-T, Weavile, or Ferrothorn, as its checks such as Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Garganacl all rely a lot on their items. Finally, since checks such as the aforementioned Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit are very susceptible to Spikes, Dragapult appreciates its setters such as Ting-Lu, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon.</p> "

Teammates that can reliably set entry hazards long-term such as Fur Coat or Regenerator Garchomp and Regenerator Ting-Lu are great partners, as they greatly appreciate Skeledirge's ability to deter hazard-removing attempts. Pokemon that check the likes of Greninja and Noivern such as Sand Stream Garganacl and specially defensive Desolate Land Volcarona make for great defensive partners alongside Skeledirge. Strong wallbreakers such as Great Tusk and Cinderace appreciate Skeledirge’s ability to keep entry hazards up by preventing Corviknight's Defog—and potentially risk a spinblock against Great Tusk and Iron Treads—allowing them to further pressure the opposing team. 12 Speed EVs let Skeledirge outspeed and either damage or burn Corviknight.</p> "

Salt Cure wears down common switch-ins such as Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Rotom-W, and Hatterene, as well as passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Corviknight, and forces them to burn recovery PP more often. Recover keeps Garganacl healthy throughout a game to check Pokemon like Ceruledge and Iron Moth and makes it more sustainable as a wincon. Purifying Salt prevents it from being crippled by Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Clodsire. It also provides a handy Ghost resistance, letting Garganacl potentially switch in on predicted Ghost-type moves from Pokemon like Dragapult and Skeledirge. Leftovers provides valuable passive recovery, reducing Garganacl's reliance on Recover. Maximum Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature maximize Garganacl's bulk, making it easier for Garganacl to switch in on Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Dragapult and use them as setup fodder. Tera Water provides incredibly valuable resistances, letting Garganacl potentially check Gholdengo and Scizor while retaining its ability to pivot in on Fire-types like Cinderace. Tera Fairy allows Garganacl to turn the tables on Great Tusk and Sacred Sword Chien-Pao while also preventing Breloom from revenge killing it. However, this does remove its resistance to Fire, making it more susceptible to Pokemon like Skeledirge and Ceruledge. Tera Ghost prevents Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk from reliably revenge killing Garganacl, letting it use them as setup fodder. It does negate the Ghost resistance provided by Purifying Salt, however, so another switch-in to Dragapult's Shadow Ball should be used.</p> <p>Checks to strong wallbreakers like Iron Valiant, Breloom, and Chien-Pao are good teammates; examples include the likes of Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. While Garganacl is given a Ghost resistance from Purifying Salt, it cannot fully check Dragapult and Gholdengo prior to Terastallization, with the latter completely countering it if it uses Covert Cloak. As such, Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire make for great teammates. Pokemon like Corviknight and Scizor appreciate Garganacl checking Fire-types like Ceruledge and Skeledirge. Corviknight is notable in that it also forms a strong defensive core with Garganacl, checking Meowscarada for it. Entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Corviknight are appreciated, as Garganacl is heavily pressured by entry hazards and cannot set up reliably if it is worn down. Frail, offensive Pokemon like Cinderace and Chien-Pao appreciate chip damage being forced onto their checks and having a strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on. Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Iron Valiant can pave the way for Garganacl to clean late-game, wearing down or significantly pressuring its checks in Gholdengo, Meowscarada, and Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk.</p> "

Once you gain enough Defense or Special Defense boosts that Scovillain's Substitute can tank an attack without breaking, it tends to be easy to win the game. Note, however, that Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers's animation make Scovillain very vulnerable to losing via timer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: With enough Moody boosts, Scovillain's Flamethrower tends to be enough to break through an entire team. There are very few Pokemon that are immune or quadruply resistant to Fire, and Flamethrower has good PP and accuracy, which makes it an easy pick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: Unlike Flamethrower, Giga Drain gets shrugged off by a lot of Pokemon, even at +6, notably Corviknight and Dragonite. However, an attacking move that helps recover HP lost from Substitutes helps it gain gives Scovillain more mileage off of Moody. Giga Drain is also notable to more reliably defeat Dondozo, one of the Unaware Pokemon that would give Scovillain a lot of trouble otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leech Seed: Leech Seed combined with Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers helps Scovillain restore HP while collecting Moody boosts, as well as chipping Pokemon it'd otherwise have trouble against, such as Clodsire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain: Ingrain is an alternative recovery option that makes Scovillain impervious to phazing moves. When purely considering recovery, it's more reliable than the inaccurate 90% accurate Leech Seed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast with Tera Fairy is an excellent option that helps remedy Scovillain's Dragon susceptibility, particularly making the Infiltrator Dragapult and Roaring Moon matchup easier.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Water: The Water resistance helps Scovillain beat Dondozo. Even though Dondozo ignores Scovillain's Defense boosts via Unaware, with Tera Water, Scovillain's Substitute can tank a Wave Crash.

The HP is adjusted to make maximum use of Leftovers, with the resulting stat having a remainder of 1 when divided by 16.

Both Roost and Substitute are alternatives that let Espathra capitalize on the switches it forces, and they give it more Calm Mind setup opportunities. They also block Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao and Kingambit. With Tera Fairy, Espathra resists Dark-type attacks alongside powering up Dazzling Gleam. Tera Blast can be run over Dazzling Gleam with Tera Fighting, as it checks Steel-types such as Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Corviknight while also removing its Dark and Ghost weaknesses.</p> <p>Espathra functions best as a late-game cleaner on hyper offense teams. Dual screens support from teammates such as Grimmsnarl is appreciated, due to its poor defensive typing. Common entry hazard setters, such as Glimmora, Great Tusk, and Garganacl, provide Espathra with chip damage, which is vital in ensuring an OHKO on Iron Valiant and Choice Band Chien-Pao. Support from Great Tusk and Iron Treads is also appreciated, as they can check Gholdengo, something Espathra struggles with. Similarly, they also can provide entry hazard removal, which supports it even further. Teammates such as Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and Dragon Dance Dragonite can wear down Pokemon such as defensive Gholdengo and Kingambit to the point where Espathra can clean late-game. Orthworm is a fantastic partner, providing Shed Tail support, alongside entry hazards, the latter of which gives Espathra more setup opportunities. Pokemon such as Breloom and Volcarona can provide utility for Espathra with Spore and Will-O-Wisp, giving it opportunities to set up. Espathra struggles with strong priority moves such as Extreme Speed from Dragonite, Ice Shard and Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao, Bullet Punch from Scizor, and Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Espathra also can be difficult to set up, as it has a rather low power level prior to boosting, and it tends to over-rely on Terastallization in order to sweep, due to its poor defensive typing.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Calm Mind Espathra is one of the most threatening Pokemon on hyper offense teams, able to quickly spiral out of hand when teams lack hard counters to it. With Speed Boost + Calm Mind, even resistant foes fall to Stored Power once it gets a few turns to set up, like Tapu Lele and Heatran. Dazzling Gleam allows Espathra to hit Dark-types such as Weavile, Mega Tyranitar, and Kingambit. Tera Blast is a solid alternative with Tera Water to hit Mega Tyranitar, Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Kingambit much harder, but at the cost of requiring Terastallization to be effective. Roost prevents Espathra from being worn down quickly, and it allows it to easily accrue boosts on Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Mega Diancie. Substitute lets it avoid crippling status from Toxapex, Heatran, and Gastrodon, allowing it to use them as setup fodder. Lastly, Protect lets Espathra safely accrue boosts and Leftovers recovery, and it can notably beat chipped Dragapult head-on without prior boosts. Water is the primary Tera type for its amazing defensive use, notably letting Espathra tear through rain teams with ease, unable to be revenge killed by Barraskewda and Floatzel's Aqua Jet. Water also lets it resist Scizor's Bullet Punch, and the Dark and Ghost neutralities help against Pokemon like Dragapult and Kingambit. Steel trades away the Water resistance and Tera Blast utility for an immunity to Toxic, as well as resisting Mega Scizor's U-turn and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, preventing them from revenge killing Espartha. The given EV spread allows Espathra to outspeed Dragapult at +1, with the remaining EVs in bulk letting it set up more easily. Dual screens greatly facilitate Espathra, allowing it to easily set up on offensive Pokemon, making both Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl amazing partners, with the former also setting Electric Terrain to activate Espathra's Electric Seed. Cyclizar's Shed Tail allows Espathra to avoid status from the likes of Toxapex, Heatran, and Rotom-W, as well as phazing from Garchomp's Dragon Tail. Dedicated entry hazard leads such as Landorus-T, Annihilape, and Glimmora also work really well with Espathra, as they quickly wear down Espathra's checks like Kingambit and Ting Lu into KO range of its attacks. Fellow setup attackers such as Mega Gyarados, Volcarona, and Dragonite break down teams to facilitate a late-game sweep with Espathra. Espathra is greatly bothered by Dark-types such as Mega Tyranitar, Kingambit, Tera Dark Clodsire, and Ting-Lu, making Ghost-types such as Dragapult and Gholdengo great partners alongside it, as they wear down their shared checks. Iron Valiant is a notable partner with Electric Seed sets, as it's also able to take advantage of Electric Terrain via Quark Drive, as well as pressuring Clodsire and Gholdengo, dissuading the former from Terastallizing.</p> "

Liquidation is Dondozo's STAB move of choice due to its lack of recoil, but Wave Crash's power has some merit against foes like Ting-Lu, Skeledirge, and Clodsire. While weaker, Waterfall is another option that has more PP than Liquidation, allowing Dondozo to perform better against stall; however, its use case is rare. Body Press makes use of Dondozo's massive Defense stat and punishes Pokemon like Tera Normal Dragonite and Kingambit. Rest + Sleep Talk provides Dondozo with good sustainability without making it too passive, while Yawn is an option that forces out sweepers Dondozo cannot consistently deal with, like mixed Iron Valiant. On Yawn sets, Leftovers over Heavy-Duty Boots can be beneficial, as Dondozo is vulnerable when it is asleep without Sleep Talk. Grass is the preferred Tera type for eliminating Dondozo's original weaknesses; this is particularly helpful against Meowscarada and Iron Hands. Dragon, however, is an option that keeps Dondozo's resistance to Fire intact, albeit making it weak to Fairy-types like Azumarill and Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Clodsire and Ting-Lu pair perfectly with Dondozo, playing into its desire to outlast foes long-term with chip damage in the form of entry hazards, status, or Ruination. Both also check special attackers like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo, which Dondozo tends to struggle with. Garganacl deserves a special mention as a teammate due to its ability to wear down foes with Salt Cure; it, in turn, appreciates Dondozo taking on Great Tusk and Kingambit. Hatterene provides Dondozo teams with an excellent sweeper and appreciates Dondozo taking care of physical wallbreakers like Chien-Pao. It also can help by blocking opposing entry hazards with Magic Bounce, letting Dondozo more comfortably tank a Knock Off from Great Tusk or Iron Treads. Similarly, entry hazard removal from Corviknight or Great Tusk is also helpful; Corviknight also deals with Meowscarada, which can force Dondozo to Terastallize early. Gholdengo can help pressure opposing Dondozo while dealing with Espathra and Iron Valiant.</p> "

Liquidation is preferred over Wave Crash due to its lack of recoil; however, Wave Crash is an option if a stronger STAB move is desired. Waterfall has higher PP than Liquidation, but it is usually a weaker option. Body Press makes use of Dondozo's naturally high Defense stat and Curse's boosts, while Protect lets Dondozo accumulate Leftovers recovery. However, these two moves can be dropped for the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk, which affords Dondozo greater longevity at the cost of relying on Sleep Talk to call the right move. Leftovers is preferred over Heavy-Duty Boots, as Dondozo will be on the field for many turns in a row to adequately set up with Curse; however, if a team requires it to play more defensively, Heavy-Duty Boots is fine choice. Grass is Dondozo's Tera type of choice, removing its original weaknesses while giving it an important resistance to Ground. Maximum investment in special bulk allows Dondozo to become nigh-unbreakable once it sets up.</p> <p>Entry hazard removal is key for Dondozo if it does not run Heavy-Duty Boots; good options include Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Corviknight. Though Dondozo can have quite the offensive presence once it sets up, it is best to run it alongside consistent wallbreakers like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Chien-Pao, which can help break open holes for it to sweep late-game. Similarly, entry hazards from teammates like Garchomp and Glimmora can facilitate Dondozo's sweep. Trick users like Meowscarada and Gholdengo can cripple Dondozo checks like Clodsire and Skeledirge, causing them to lose to Dondozo over the course of the game. While Dondozo is a great sweeper, it is far from consistent at generating setup opportunities; accordingly, it is best to pair it with another bulky sweeper like Iron Defense Garganacl or Hatterene, which can weaken or bait out answers to bulky sweepers like Trick users and Unaware Clodsire.</p> "

Bulk Up makes it harder for foes such as Great Tusk and Dragonite to break through it, as well as allowing it to break through defensive Pokemon like Buzzwole and Mega Scizor. Taunt prevents status, recovery, and set up from Pokemon like Skeledirge, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T while also forcing foes to damage Annihilape, boosting the power of Rage Fist. Rage Fist lacks no switch-in once boosted up and allows Annihilape to demolish Pokemon that wouldn't mind it unboosted, such as Gholdengo and Mega Scizor. It also notably invalidates Unaware, enabling it to break through Pokemon like Clodsire and Skeledirge. Drain Punch provides Annihilape with some additional recovery, preventing it from being worn down quickly. Rest combined with Chesto Berry can be used over Taunt, as it provides Annihilape with a one-time way to recover HP and status, as well as being the premier way to heal from strong incoming hits, but it can be easily exploited if the foe is able to chip down Annihilape enough. Tera Water is the premier option, as it boosts Annihilape's defensive profile, giving it resists to moves like Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Fairy is another option that gives Annihilape nice resistances to moves like Mega Lopunny's Close Combat and an immunity to Draco Meteor or Dragon Darts from Dragapult. Tera Fire gives Annihilape an immunity to Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon like Skeledirge and Rotom-W while giving it a Fairy resistance as well, preventing the likes of Mega Diancie and Iron Valiant from revenge killing it.

The other EVs maximize its special bulk, letting it take hits comfortably from Pokemon like Heatran and Volcarona. Dual screens setters like Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl let Annihilape tank hits more easily. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Ferrothorn, and Heatran to wear down Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele is appreciated.

Annihilape being a Defog deterrent due to Defiant, as well as its bulk and Final Gambit picking up easy KOs also strengthens this niche. Final Gambit lets Annihilape safely bring in a teammate while dealing massive damage due to its large HP stat. Taunt denies other entry hazards from being set up by Pokemon like Ting-Lu and preventing the use of Defog from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Tornadus-T on the switch. Defog can also activate Defiant, giving Annihilape way more offensive output for Rage Fist and making it easier to pick up a KO. Annihilape won't be Terastallizing often, but Tera Ghost can be used to boost the power of Rage Fist in scenarios where it is boosted, and it gives Annihilape neutralities to moves like Mega Diancie's Moonblast and Tornadus-T's Hurricane or Bleakwind Storm. Annihilape fits on hyper offense exclusively, so Pokemon that benefit from entry hazards being simultaneously denied and set up, such as Espathra and Dragonite, are good partners. Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Mega Diancie are very big problems for Annihilape, so partners like Gholdengo and Mega Scizor are very valuable. Final Gambit removing Pokemon like Great Tusk and Tornadus-T can also be a big help to teammates like Kingambit and Dragonite.</p> "

Stealth Rock lets Great Tusk compress even more roles, chipping away at the opposition. If another Stealth Rock user is already on the team, however, Body Press can take advantage of its high Defense stat and better threaten the likes of Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon. Body Press also lets Great Tusk catch Rotom-W with greater chip damage than Knock Off does on the switch. Knock Off provides valuable item removal, getting rid of Leftovers from Pokemon like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Volcarona and Dragonite. Additionally, Knock Off is Great Tusk's only initial way to hit Air Balloon Gholdengo, which can't OHKO this defensive set. Rapid Spin, besides clearing entry hazards, also allows Great Tusk to outspeed faster foes like Focus Sash Glimmora and Gholdengo. Tera Fighting gets rid of Great Tusk's Ground typing, giving it a better matchup against Pokemon like Chien-Pao while also strengthening Body Press if it is used. Alternatively, Tera Steel can give Great Tusk valuable resistances to Fairy, Grass, and Ice, turning the tables on Hatterene and Chien-Pao. Leftovers greatly increases Great Tusk's longevity; however, Rocky Helmet can be used to wear down Pokemon like Scizor and Cinderace over time.</p> <p>After Great Tusk sets Stealth Rock, Corviknight effortlessly switches in and uses Defog to remove entry hazards, so Pokemon like Cinderace, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W that handle it are great partners. With no good way to hit Flying-types and Pokemon that use Tera Flying, Great Tusk can be set up on very quickly, most notably against the likes of Dragonite and Roaring Moon;even though the former dislikes Knock Off. Therefore, checks to these such as Dondozo and Corviknight are appreciated. A different Stealth Rock setter like Garganacl or Ting-Lu lets Great Tusk comfortably run Body Press without losing out on anything major. Ting-Lu also forms a potent entry hazard-stacking core with Great Tusk via Spikes. Further, it takes on the special attackers that Great Tusk struggles with, like Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Volcarona. Great Tusk is forced out by wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Quaquaval, so teammates that can check them like Amoonguss and Toxapex are welcome. Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Ceruledge, and Iron Moth appreciate the entry hazard removal that Great Tusk provides. Great Tusk's defensive qualities greatly help frail wallbreakers like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao, as these Pokemon need strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on very often.</p> "

          "description": "<p>The combination of high Attack, powerful STAB moves, a decent movepool, and well-rounded physical bulk allows Great Tusk to function as a strong physical wallbreaker. It can support teams offensively with Knock Off and Rapid Spin as well as defensively through its ability to check Kingambit, Cinderace, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Its dual STAB moves are able to OHKO or severely damage several key offensive Pokemon in the metagame such as Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Tera Normal Dragonite. Knock Off allows Great Tusk to remove Leftovers from walls such as Corviknight and Dondozo. It can also remove important items from more offensive Pokemon, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite, Volcarona, and bulky pivot Roaring Moon, and it can provide coverage against Air Balloon Gholdengo, which otherwise checks this set. Ice Spinner hits Dragon-types that Headlong Rush isn't as strong against like bulky Garchomp and Dragonite. Alternatively, Rapid Spin can be run if the team is still in need of entry hazard removal. With Tera Fighting, Close Combat becomes much stronger, guaranteeing OHKOs against offensive Scizor sets. Tera Fighting also improves Great Tusk's matchups against Dondozo, Rotom-W, and opposing Great Tusk, and it removes its weakness to Ice, allowing it to better handle Chien-Pao. With Tera Steel, Great Tusk can better handle Ice- and Fairy-types such as Chien-Pao and Hatterene, and it can also shrug off attacks it normally can't, such as Meowscarada's Flower Trick and Dragapult's Draco Meteor. When running Great Tusk on sun teams, an alternate EV spread making Speed its highest stat can be considered due to Protosynthesis boosting Speed; this allows Great Tusk to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon like Dragapult, Chien-Pao, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p> <p>Rotom-W, Skeledirge, and Torkoal make for good teammates, since their status spreading can help weaken foes and help Great Tusk wallbreak more efficiently. Rotom-W is able to paralyze faster Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and boosted Quaquaval, allowing Great Tusk to outspeed them. Skeledirge is able to spread burn, capitalize on foes afflicted with status with a boosted Hex, and check Iron Valiant sets lacking Shadow Ball. Lastly, Torkoal is able to force switches thanks to Yawn, spread status with Lava Plume, and set up sun to make Great Tusk an even scarier wallbreaker. Great Tusk appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Garganacl and Ting-Lu, since it can wallbreak more easily thanks to the chip damage they provide. Great Tusk is able to keep their hazards up in exchange while simultaneously removing hazards set by foes. Sweepers that are vulnerable to hazards like Iron Moth and Tera Flying Roaring Moon appreciate Great Tusk being able to remove hazards and beat walls such as Ting-Lu, allowing them to sweep more easily late-game. Lastly, other offensive Pokemon such as Kingambit and Dragonite make for good partners, since Great Tusk is able to weaken or cripple their common checks in Iron Valiant.</p> "

Rapid Spin lets Great Tusk provide entry hazard removal for the team in games where it would not be able to win with Bulk Up, while allowing it to boost its Speed in games where it can sweep with Bulk Up. Body Press is another option that gives Great Tusk a way to more immediately hit Dark-types such as Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Ting-Lu. Tera Water turns Great Tusk's Water and Ice weaknesses into resistances, allowing it to better take hits from Azumarill, Chien-Pao, Quaquaval, and Floatzel. On the other hand, Tera Steel lets Great Tusk take on Grass-type attacks such as Breloom's Bullet Seed and Meowscarada's Flower Trick, Flying-type attacks like Roaring Moon's Acrobatics, and if need be, Fairy-type attacks such as Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Bulk Up Great Tusk appreciates specially defensive teammates like Toxapex and Garganacl that can help play around fast special attackers such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult. In return, Garganacl and Toxapex appreciate the presence of a Terastallized Great Tusk as they can get overwhelmed by Chien-Pao and Belly Drum Azumarill. Teammates such as Gholdengo, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult can help break through physically defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Skeledirge that Bulk Up Great Tusk can struggle against. Gholdengo in particular is a great partner, as it can struggle against Cinderace and Dragonite, both of which Great Tusk covers.</p> "

Earthquake can be used for a no-drawback STAB move, but the lack in power is certainly noticeable. Close Combat allows Great Tusk to annihilate Pokemon like Kingambit, and Ferrothorn, and it does a nice chunk to Rotom-W on the switch.

Mystical Fire hits Steel-types such as Klefki and Iron Treads. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to punish specially defensive switch-ins like Dragalge, Blissey, and Clodsire. Flutter Mane can run Power Gem to pressure Fire teams, OHKOing foes like Volcarona and Torkoal, and it also benefits from Protosynthesis allowing it to outspeed Scovillain under the sun. Additionally, Flutter Mane usually goes with either Thunderbolt or Energy Ball. Both are useful against Water teams, with the former helping against Toxapex and Pelipper while the latter deals with Gastrodon and Quagsire. Choice Specs further enhances Flutter Mane's wallbreaking power, allowing it to overwhelm foes such as Ting-Lu after some chip damage.</p> <p>On Fairy teams, Flutter Mane is a menacing wallbreaker that excels at taking down slower foes such as Hydreigon, Skeledirge, and Corviknight. When paired with Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane forms an offensive core that's able to alternate between Fairy-, Ghost-, and Fighting-type STAB to take down a wide range of enemies. Flutter Mane can handle Psychic-type foes such as Espathra and Hatterene, while Iron Valiant takes care of Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Flutter Mane can fall back on either Hatterene or Tinkaton when faced with an unfavorable matchup. Both of these Pokemon provide dependable defensive options and some type of entry hazard control, but Hatterene is particularly useful due to it breaking down walls like Dondozo and Clodsire. Flutter Mane also pairs well with setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Mimikyu, as it is able to poke holes in the opponent's team, allowing them to clean late-game. In return, Azumarill can take care of priority users, such as Ceruledge and Chien-Pao. In terms of support options, Flutter Mane can rely on Fairy's Prankster users, Klefki and Grimmsnarl, to set up dual screens, therefore allowing it to withstand hits such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Grimmsnarl can then bring in Flutter Mane relatively safely thanks to Parting Shot. Klefki's Spikes and Tinkaton's Stealth Rocks also support Flutter Mane in breaking its checks such as Iron Hands and Ting Lu. Entry hazard stacking proves particularly useful against less bulky teams, as it highly limits their capacity to scout Flutter Mane without having to sacrifice a member in the process.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gholdengo utilizes its high Special Attack and its great offensive typing to become a fast revenge killer. Gholdengo can effectively hit offensive threats such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Espathra with its STAB moves. Trick allows Gholdengo to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Dodonzo, Corviknight, and Clodsire. Its typing also allows it to switch into foes such as Iron Valiant and Iron Hands in a pinch, as it either resists or is immune to most of their attacks. Focus Blast is ideal for Gholdengo to hit Kingambit and other foes such as a weakened Ting-Lu, but Nasty Plot can be run instead to take advantage of stopping defensive Pokemon with Trick and having a free turn to set up and do a great amount of damage. Recover can also be run, taking a more defensive approach to give Gholdengo a free turn to heal. Gholdengo prefers Fighting as a Tera type, as it removes its prior weaknesses, meaning it is not threatened by Chien-Pao's and Kingambit's Sucker Punch, or Skeledirge's Torch Song. It also boosts the power of Focus Blast, reliably removing the latter. To counter different foes, Gholdengo can instead opt for Tera Flying to have better ground against Great Tusk and Iron Treads.</p> <p>Teammates such as Kingambit and Iron Valiant appreciate Gholdengo's offensive pressure, as it can help against shared checks such as Great Tusk and Amoonguss. With this role, Gholdengo prefers to have a clean switch after a teammate has fainted in order to pressure the opponent. Similarly, entry hazard setters such as Garchomp, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu appreciate Gholdengo for its Good as Gold ability and its Ghost typing, preventing all forms of hazard removal excluding Court Change. Gholdengo is mainly vulnerable to priority moves such as Kingambit's and Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch. Dragonite also presents an issue for it with Multiscale in conjunction with Earthquake, not to mention it can set up twice in front of Gholdengo. This can be avoided with a carefully timed Trick or help from defensive Great Tusk and Skeledirge. Similarly, depending on its Choice lock, Roaring Moon and Cinderace can take advantage of Gholdengo with Crunch and Sucker Punch, respectively. As a result of this, Garchomp and Garganacl pair well with Gholdengo, acting as a defensive backbone with type advantage and great bulk. Iron Valiant can be a great revenge killer against these threats with great Speed and coverage.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its great typing and Good as Gold, Gholdengo is a setup sweeper that's notably difficult to deal with. Having an additional Ground immunity with Air Balloon further improves Gholdengo's already great typing, letting it switch in on Pokemon that otherwise threaten it, such as Garchomp and Iron Treads. This is especially useful against the latter, as Air Balloon strengthens Gholdengo's ability to block entry hazard removal. Maximum Speed investment is for outspeeding Dragonite and uninvested Great Tusk. 252 Special Attack EVs and Nasty Plot makes Gholdengo's STAB moves very threatening against neutral foes. Fighting and Dark Tera types give Gholdengo the option to Terastallize defensively; notably, Tera Fighting lessens the impact of moves like Crunch from Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon. Tera Dark is useful in a pinch to resist attacks such as Shadow Ball from Dragapult and opposing Gholdengo.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Glimmora are the most profitable teammates for Gholdengo, as its ability and typing ensure that their entry hazards stay around as long as Gholdengo does. Hyper offense staples such as Chien-Pao and Iron Valiant benefit greatly from the constant presence of entry hazards to break down bulkier cores; in return, Gholdengo gets teammates that synergize with its role as a wallbreaker, applying heavy pressure throughout a game to Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Rotom-W. Offensive Pokemon that outspeed and OHKO Gholdengo, such as Cinderace, Chien-Pao, Roaring Moon, and Knock Off variants of Great Tusk, threaten to completely shut down Gholdengo; defensive teammates like Garganacl, Dondozo and Skeledirge can help mitigate some of these weaknesses.</p> "

Its chance to flinch can also help Chien-Pao break down walls, like Corviknight, in a pinch. Ice Spinner, while marginally weaker, may be preferred due to its perfect accuracy. Crunch is another powerful STAB option that conveniently pairs well with Icicle Crash, as it is able to hit common Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Dondozo and Gholdengo. Ice Shard lets Chien-Pao revenge kill sweepers like Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant; Sucker Punch is more powerful, but it can leave Chien-Pao vulnerable to status spreaders like Rotom-W and Hex Dragapult and to sweepers that can take advantage of Chien-Pao if it is Choice-locked into it.

An Adamant nature grants Chien-Pao enough power to 2HKO physically defensive Dondozo with Crunch after Terastallization, though Jolly prevents it from being outsped by threats like Roaring Moon and Cinderace.</p> <p>Chien-Pao's typing leaves it vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, which will greatly limit the number of times it can switch in and launch attacks. For this reason, hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight are great partners for it; they also can cover several of Chien-Pao's checks, such as Scizor and Kingambit. Hazards greatly aid Chien-Pao's ability to clean teams late-game, so hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Garchomp and the aforementioned Great Tusk make for great teammates. Defensive teammates like Corviknight and Dondozo can support Chien-Pao by handling Pokemon that offensively check it, such as Scizor. Pivots like Rotom-, Cinderace, and Dragapult, make for solid teammates, as they give Chien-Pao the ability to prey on their common switch-ins like Amoonguss and Clodsire.</p> "

          "description": "<p>By virtue of its high Speed and Attack, excellent offensive STAB combination, and unique ability Sword of Ruin, Chien-Pao is one of the tier's defining wallbreakers and late-game cleaners. Icicle Crash is preferred over Ice Spinner as it avoids Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin chip and boasts higher power and a chance to flinch. However, Ice Spinner can also be used as a guaranteed safe option if your team cannot afford missing. Sacred Sword offers good coverage that hits important metagame threats that resist Chien-Pao's STAB combination, such as Kingambit. Tera Dark is the preferred option to eliminate Chien-Pao's Stealth Rock weakness and power up Crunch and Sucker Punch to monstrous levels, enabling Life Orb Chien-Pao to cleanly 2HKO Toxapex. Tera Ice is an alternative that boosts Ice Shard enough to always OHKO Dragapult after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>All-out attacking Chien-Pao is best used as a midgame wallbreaker on offensive teams that can take advantage of its high damage output and wide coverage to punch holes in the opposing defensive core. Late-game cleaners that can take advantage of Chien-Pao's wallbreaking capabilities include Iron Valiant and Dragon Dance Dragonite. Chien-Pao can struggle with bulky Water-types such as Dondozo, Azumarill, and physically defensive Quaquaval. Rotom-Wash is a good partner that can switch into these Water-types and either gain momentum with Volt Switch or cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. If running Life Orb over Heavy-Duty Boots, entry hazard control from Great Tusk or Hatterene is greatly appreciated. Great Tusk and Hatterene can also use their great physical bulk and quadruple resistance, respectively, to switch into Fighting-type attacks aimed at Chien-Pao.</p> "

Earthquake is a strong, consistent coverage option that hits Kingambit, Garganacl, Iron Hands, and Clodsire super effectively. Roost, on the other hand, gives Roaring Moon access to reliable recovery, which gives it more setup opportunities throughout the game even if its Booster Energy is already used up. Acrobatics has fantastic coverage, as it hits Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Breloom super effectively and should always be run alongside Tera Flying to maximize its power. Iron Head is a viable alternative to Acrobatics and should always be run alongside Tera Steel, as it deals with Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Hatterene simultaneously. Tera Flying removes all of Roaring Moon's baseline weaknesses bar Ice, gives it a resistance to Fighting- and Bug-type attacks, a Ground immunity, and a STAB boost to Acrobatics. Tera Steel, though more niche, allows Roaring Moon to resist Hatterene's Dazzling Gleam, Chien-Pao's Ice-type attacks, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Tera Normal Dragonite's Extreme Speed. A Jolly nature is typically run to outspeed Booster Energy Iron Valiant after a Dragon Dance, but Adamant is a decent alternative, particularly on teams that allow Roaring Moon to obtain more than one Dragon Dance boost. After a Dragon Dance, Adamant Roaring Moon can more easily OHKO defensive variants of Gholdengo and Great Tusk.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Roaring Moon best functions on offensive teams, pairing well with setup sweepers that can wear down each other's checks. Espathra appreciates Roaring Moon's ability to pressure opposing Steel-types, Iron Valiant can opt out of running Psyshock, since Roaring Moon breaks past Clodsire for it, and Breloom can more effectively utilize its STAB moves and Spore once Roaring Moon eliminates Gholdengo. Dondozo and Tera Fairy Skeledirge are major threats to Roaring Moon due to their ability to ignore its boosts with Unaware, while strong priority users like Chien-Pao, Dragonite, and Breloom can revenge kill Roaring Moon thanks to its low Defense. Ting-Lu can force Roaring Moon out with Whirlwind, and Choice Band Iron Hands survives a boosted Earthquake from full health and can OHKO Roaring Moon with Close Combat. Espathra can muscle past Dondozo, Skeledirge, and Iron Hands thanks to Stored Power, while Iron Valiant offers more immediate damage against the aforementioned threats and Ting-Lu due to its excellent mixed coverage. Offensive Great Tusk and Technician Breloom can help wear down Ting-Lu with their super effective STAB moves, and Breloom's Technician-boosted Bullet Seed can also break past Dondozo. Grimmsnarl's ability to set up dual screens allows Roaring Moon to set up multiple Dragon Dances and survive attacks from Chien-Pao and Dragonite. Orthworm is a niche option that sets entry hazards and provides a slow Shed Tail to get Roaring Moon in safely behind a Substitute, allowing for much easier setup opportunities against opposing status users like Rotom-W and protecting it from priority moves from Chien-Pao, Dragonite, and Breloom.</p> "

Its Quark Drive-boosted Speed from Booster Energy turns it into a potent late-game cleaner, letting it outspeed would-be revenge killers like Dragapult, Chien-Pao, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, which is further enforced by its unique typing that resists Sucker Punch from Kingambit and Chien-Pao. However, it can also be used to revenge kill boosted threats like Baxcalibur and Dragonite in a pinch, especially since Iron Valiant can take on the latter's +1 Tera Normal Extreme Speed from full health. Tera Fairy boosts Iron Valiant's Moonblast while still retaining its defensive profile to take on Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Tera Electric amplifies Thunderbolt's damage, notably allowing it to 2HKO would-be checks like Toxapex, specially defensive Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl, and offensive Gholdengo after Stealth Rock, as well as preventing Iron Valiant from being revenge killed by Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> <p>Mixed Iron Valiant is commonly seen on offense and bulky offense teams. Due to the lack of a damage boosting item or setup move, it can still fall short of threatening bulky Pokemon like Amoonguss, and without Shadow Ball or Knock Off, Skeledirge and defensive Gholdengo as well; thus, Pokemon that can deal with them such as Great Tusk, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit make good teammates. Particularly, the aforementioned Pokemon can overwhelm a shared check in Corviknight and are generally effective as early-game wallbreakers that can open up Iron Valiant to clean up late-game easily. Entry hazards from teammates like Garchomp, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora can chip down foes like Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Tera Grass Dondozo. A sturdy defensive backbone with the likes of Corviknight and Ting-Lu can help check offensive threats that threaten Iron Valiant out, such as a boosted Roaring Moon, opposing Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo. Pivots like Dragapult, Scizor, and Rotom-W can compensate for Iron Valiant's lack of bulk by bringing it in safely on foes like Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Blissey, respectively; the latter can also cripple Amoonguss with either Trick or Will-O-Wisp. Gholdengo is a great partner, as it reliably prevents the much-needed entry hazards from being removed by Rapid Spin and Defog, threatens Skeledirge and Tera Fairy Garganacl, and appreciates Iron Valiant dealing with foes like Corviknight and Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon in return.</p> "

After a Quark Drive boost, Iron Valiant outspeeds and OHKOes a plethora of premier offensive threats in the tier, such as Chien-Pao, Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Thunderbolt allows Iron Valiant to damage Corviknight and bulky Water-types like Dondozo, Azumarill, Toxapex, and Tera Water Garganacl, while Psyshock scores a 2HKO on any Clodsire looking to stop Iron Valiant's sweep. With Calm Mind, Iron Valiant can switch roles from an endgame sweeper to a powerful wallbreaker. After one Calm Mind, Moonblast 2HKOes defensive Garganacl, and +1 Tera Electric Thunderbolt 2HKOes specially defensive Slowking and OHKOes Corviknight. Tera Fairy powers up Moonblast, which can now 2HKO Garganacl and Hatterene. Tera Electric boosts the power of Thunderbolt, which secures important 2HKOs on specially defensive Dodonzo, Corviknight, and Toxapex, lets Iron Valiant survive Scizor's Bullet Punch, and grants Iron Valiant an immunity to paralysis from Hatterene's Nuzzle.</p> <p>Iron Valiant relies heavily on its super-effective coverage moves for damage output. As a result, it struggles to make progress against Pokemon like Volcarona, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo. Thus, teammates like Clodsire and Ting-Lu are good defensive partners for Iron Valiant, with the added benefit of being able to set up entry hazards. Iron Moth has strong offensive synergy with Iron Valiant, being able to threaten Amoonguss, Iron Treads, and Tera Fairy Garganacl, while also being able to chip down special walls like Clodsire. On offense teams, Iron Valiant complements powerful wallbreakers like Chien-Pao, Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and Kingambit, since they can overwhelm defensive cores and open up the path for Iron Valiant to sweep. Finally, Iron Valiant is highly reliant on Booster Energy to sweep, as it cannot normally outspeed common revenge-killers like Chien-Pao, Dragapult, Cinderace, and Meowscarada. Therefore, it is important to time when to switch in to Iron Valiant to ensure defensive counters like Skeledirge and Volcarona are either removed or heavily damaged so it can sweep or break through the opposing team effectively. Along these lines, it is important to conserve Iron Valiant's health, since it can survive key priority moves such as Extreme Speed from Tera Normal Dragonite after a Dragon Dance and Ice Shard from Choice Band Chien-Pao. Therefore, Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads, are great teammates for Iron Valiant.</p> "

Otherwise, it makes dealing with Tera Fairy Skeledirge and Tera Fairy Koraidon or Miraidon more difficult.</li> <li>Koraidon can use Tera Fire to power up Flame Charge and avoid a burn from Skeledirge, while Tera Steel Koraidon helps prevent revenge killing attempts from Choice Scarf Dragon-types like Miraidon and opposing Koraidon.

It also appreciates having Terastallization available for the defensive benefits.</li> <li>Entry hazard leads pair best with Koraidon to fuel hyper offense teams. Pokemon like Masquerain, Froslass, and Glimmora do this the best, while Grimmsnarl provides good support with dual screens.</li> <li>Other setup sweepers like Miraidon, Chien-Pao, and Flutter Mane are also great teammates, as they can break through walls to facilitate a Koraidon sweep, or Koraidon can do the same for them depending on the matchup.</li> <li>Offensive Great Tusk appreciates the sun provided by Koraidon while also removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin, which is especially important if Toxic Spikes are set up or if Koraidon Terastallizes into a Fire-type.</li> </ul> "

Tera Fighting similarly boosts Close Combat to the point where it has a chance to 2HKO the best defensive Fighting-resistant Pokemon in Toxapex and Pelipper; after minimal chip damage, they are always 2HKOed.
