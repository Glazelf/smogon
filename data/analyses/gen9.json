The given moves offer the most utility in the rare situations Chansey is not transformed, like phazing Substitute users, pivoting, acting as a cleric, and removing Chansey's Toxic Orb. Offensive threats such as Zacian-C and Poison Heal users such as Arceus-Fairy appreciate the information Imposter Chansey provides through scouting, with Poison Heal users also acting as Knock Off absorbers. Imposter Chansey appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon like Dondozo and RegenVest Ting-Lu for safe scouting; these Pokemon can also provide Knock Off support, aiding against Judgment users like Miraidon that can otherwise defeat Imposter Chansey. Tera Normal gives Chansey a STAB boost on Judgment, improving its matchup into Pokemon like Miraidon, while Tera Fire and Tera Ghost are useful against Zacian-C and trapping moves, respectively.</p> "

Haze can also reset its partner's stat drops from the likes of Intimidate, Parting Shot, and Snarl, or attacks that lower the user's stats.</p> </li> <li> <p>Taunt allows it to also disrupt support Pokemon such as Lilligant, Talonflame, and Amoonguss, as well as crippling Pokemon such as Iron Defense Garganacl.

Protect allows it to scout the opponent and block Fake Out. Perish Song is an interesting option that gives Murkrow a win condition alongside its supportive roles and can force switches before that.</p> </li> <li> <p>Eviolite gives Murkrow the bulk needed to stay on the field and disrupt the opponent with Haze and Taunt.

Dragon Tail forces switches and potentially create a favorable situation for Garchomp and helps rack up even more entry hazard damage. As Garchomp does not have any reliable recovery, Leftovers is the preferred option on Fur Coat to give it Garchomp longevity, but Heavy-Duty Boots is great for opposing hazard-stack matchups. Fur Coat makes Garchomp it significantly better at handling targets such as Aerilate Dragonite and Adaptability Kingambit; however, Regenerator provides far better longevity, letting Garchomp set entry hazards multiple times. Due to Garchomp mainly being an entry hazard setter, it greatly appreciates teammates such as Good as Gold Skeledirge to keep the entry hazards up in the face of Defog and Rapid Spin. Garchomp also works well with offensive threats such as Sheer Force Iron Valiant, as the entry hazards can wear down Iron Valiant's checks into KO range. Garchomp struggles to check common attackers like Dragapult and Iron Valiant, so secondary checks like physically defensive Clodsire are appreciated.</p> "

Sturdy also helps Magnezone play around Dondozo, as it can safely come in on Fissure and use Volt Switch against it, which renders Yawn moot.

Note that Hydreigon should not be Terastallized against Armarouge to maintain the Fire resistance and Psychic immunity, as it is still weak to Aura Sphere when Terastallized. Opposing Tera Fire Hydreigon never OHKOes Tera Steel Hydreigon with Life Orb Heat Wave when spread damage is accounted for, allowing Hydreigon to retaliate with Snarl.

Knock Off removes items such as Covert Cloak and Leftovers, and Scald burns provide chip damage on foes.

Heavy-Duty Boots, notably eases Dondozo's pivoting, while Rocky Helmet punishes contact moves such as U-turn and V-create.

Tera Fire allows Dondozo to resist Magical Torque and Grass-type moves from Zacian-C, and it maintains Dondozo's resistance to Fire-type moves such as V-create.

          "description": "<p>Chi-Yu's strong base stats and excellent STAB coverage make it a flexible offensive threat. Choice Specs provides maximum wallbreaking power, notably allowing it to OHKO Ice Scales Corviknight and physically defensive Ting-Lu with Desolate Land + Overheat, whereas Choice Scarf gives it the Speed to clean late-game and chase out faster threats like Dragapult and Chien-Pao. Desolate Land provides the most damage amplification and comes with an immunity to Water, whereas No Guard enables Chi-Yu to liberally spread burns with Inferno. Psychic is useful coverage to hit Clodsire and Iron Moth super effectively; alternatively, Will-O-Wisp allows Desolate Land sets to reliably spread burn, however Chi-Yu's poor bulk means it can be dangerous to use. Chi-Yu's best fit is on balance and offense teams that appreciate its high damage output, as well as its good matchups against common special walls like Ice Scales Corviknight and RegenVest Iron Treads. Bulky pivots, like the aforementioned Corviknight and Iron Treads, make particularly good Chi-Yu partners because both can clear entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock.</p> "

Chi-Yu generally prefers to run Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid entry hazard damage, but Life Orb can be run on Sheer Force sets for extra power. Chi-Yu also has several Fire-type STAB moves to choose from: Fire Blast is the most powerful, Flamethrower is the most consistent option, and Inferno is used on No Guard sets to punish switch-ins like Garganacl and Ting-Lu with a burn. Chi-Yu does struggle against special walls like Clodsire and Blissey, so physically offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Iron Hands make good teammates. Chi-Yu is also physically frail, so it appreciates teammates like Corviknight and Avalugg that can switch into strong physical attacks and Wish passers like Florges and Scream Tail that can help it stay healthy.</p> "
