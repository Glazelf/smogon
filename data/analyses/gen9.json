          "description": "<p>Thanks to its superb coverage and high Special Attack stat, Mega Charizard Y is a terrifying wallbreaker. Drought + Solar Beam allows Mega Charizard Y to subdue Water-types such Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini, further restricting its defensive counterplay. Fire Blast is preferred to hit as hard as possible, though Flamethrower's perfect accuracy and greater PP make it worth consideration. Weather Ball is an interesting option, as it presents a challenge to rain teams by dealing considerable damage to Pelipper on the switch, but it comes at the cost of Mega Charizard Y losing its primary STAB move outside of sun. Scorching Sands pressures Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, while Focus Blast threatens Mega Tyranitar. Mega Charizard Y's tremendous wallbreaking prowess allows late-game sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult, Dragonite, and Volcarona to take advantage of Unaware walls that have been compromised, such as Skeledirge and Clodsire. Mega Charizard Y's sun support benefits Protosynthesis users such as Great Tusk. Mega Charizard Y appreciates entry hazard control from teammates such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Kartana, as it is extremely susceptible to Stealth Rock. It also struggles to break bulky Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Mega Latias as well as special walls like Clodsire and Hippowdon. Weavile, Tyranitar, and Kingambit subsequently form strong offensive cores with Mega Charizard Y, as they are able to Pursuit trap its aforementioned checks, with the former being able to deal with Hippowdon as well. Mega Charizard Y's middling Speed tier and unremarkable physical bulk leave it prone to being revenge killed by faster threats such as Dragapult, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko. Therefore, bulky switch-ins such as Assault Vest Tangrowth, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T make for good teammates.</p> "

Volt Switch lets Voltorb deal solid damage while preserving itself and capitalizing on the switches it forces with its Speed. Thunderbolt deals a stronger blow, invaluable against bulky Water-types like Mareanie, Quaxly, and Shellos, and is valuable for cleaning up weakened fast threats. Tera Blast, once Voltorb has Terastallized, gives it the heralded BoltBeam coverage and turns the tables on would-be checks like Toedscool, Mudbray, Diglett, and Wattrel. Because of Voltorb's limited coverage and the prominence of Ground-types, Voltorb often depends on Terastallization (or the threat of it) to function well in a match. Voltorb leans on a few utility options for its fourth move due to its limited movepool; Protect stops Nymble's First Impression from revenge killing it and can scout defensive Terastallizations, especially Tera Water on Toedscool. Taunt prevents setup and entry hazards from the likes of Pawniard, Surskit, and Glimmet, and Thunder Wave neutralizes setup sweepers and faster threats that Voltorb cannot OHKO. Voltorb pairs well with teammates that can switch into its Ground-type checks when it has not Terastallized. Toedscool is a natural partner thanks to its bulk, Ground resistance, and ability to remove entry hazards for Terastallized Voltorb, given its new Stealth Rock weakness. Drifloon's Ground immunity also supports Voltorb well. As a pivot, Voltorb appreciates the support of other pivots to continually put your opponent on the back foot. Nymble has a powerful STAB U-turn and often invites in Mareanie, which Voltorb can pressure. Wingull not only checks Ground-types with its dual STAB types and Ground immunity, but also appreciates Voltorb handling the bulky Water-types that check it.</p> "

The given moves offer the most utility in the rare situations Chansey is not transformed, like phazing Substitute users, pivoting, and acting as a cleric. Offensive threats such as Zacian-C and Miraidon appreciate the information Imposter Chansey provides through scouting. Imposter Chansey appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon like Dondozo and RegenVest Ting-Lu for safe scouting; these Pokemon can also provide Knock Off support, aiding against Judgment users like Miraidon that can otherwise defeat Imposter Chansey. Tera Normal gives Chansey a STAB boost on Judgment, improving its matchup into Pokemon like Miraidon, while Tera Fire and Tera Ghost are useful against Zacian-C and trapping moves, respectively.</p> "

Extreme Speed is an excellent move for any physical sweeper, due to its high power and initiative over other priority users such as Kingambit. Earthquake provides coverage against bulky foes such as Toxapex, Garganacl, and Clodsire. Fire Punch OHKOes Scizor and 2HKOes physically defensive Corviknight after a Dragon Dance and Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Ice Spinner hits opposing Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Dragapult super effectively, notably OHKOing Dragapult after a Dragon Dance. Heavy-Duty Boots + Roost improves Dragonite's longevity and possibly enables it to retain Multiscale and obtain multiple boosts; preserving Multiscale is particularly useful for surviving Draco Meteor from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult. However, the loss of coverage against targets such as Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo is noticeable. Tera Normal turns Extreme Speed into an incredibly powerful STAB priority move capable of shredding offensive teams after a single boost, and a timely typing change also removes Dragonite's weaknesses to Ice, Fairy, and Dragon, which can buy a free turn to set up. An Adamant nature is preferred since it maximizes the power of Extreme Speed, which often makes makes Speed stats irrelevant, but a Jolly nature can also be used to outspeed the Normal-immune Dragapult after a Dragon Dance, which is especially useful if Dragonite is running Ice Spinner.</p> <p>Offensive Dragon Dance Dragonite regularly serves as a potent win con on offensive teams that can also act as a revenge killer against fast and frail threats. Multiscale Dragonite's considerable bulk, as well as Ghost immunity with Tera Normal provides significant defensive utility for offensive teams. In particular, teams using frail offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant appreciate the defensive utility Dragonite brings. In return, these Pokemon can help wallbreak for a late-game Dragonite sweep. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, and Garchomp is appreciated to weaken Pokemon such as Iron Valiant into range of boosted Extreme Speed. Dual screens support from Grimmsnarl and Shed Tail support from Orthworm are potential options that can supplement Dragonite's already great bulk and virtually guarantee the ability to acquire multiple boosts. Since Dragonite struggles against bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo and Skeledirge, a teammate that can switch into and check these Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, is appreciated. Rotom-W can cripple these physical walls with Trick, gain momentum against them with Volt Switch, and absorb Will-O-Wisp from Skeledirge.</p> "

          "description": "<p>With the combination of its solid natural bulk, valuable typing, reliable recovery in Roost, and Multiscale, Dragonite can accrue multiple Dragon Dance boosts and become a dangerous bulky setup sweeper. It can set up on common Pokemon such as Great Tusk lacking Bulk Up or Ice Spinner, non-Will-O-Wisp Volcarona, and even super effective attacks from Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult thanks to Multiscale. Extreme Speed alongside Tera Normal lets Dragonite clean up late-game, OHKOing faster threats like Meowscarada and potentially Cinderace at +1. It also outprioritizes Meowscarada's Sucker Punch as well as Grimmsnarl's Prankster-boosted Reflect and Thunder Wave. Earthquake covers Normal-resistant and -immune Pokemon, including foes like Dragapult, non-Air Balloon Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Kingambit. 144 HP EVs allow Dragonite to survive Tera Fairy Iron Valiant's Moonblast at +1 through Multiscale. Aside from strengthening Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Tera Normal sheds off its weaknesses to give it setup opportunities against would-be threats like Dragapult and Hatterene. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Multiscale intact by ignoring Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Bulky Dragon Dance Dragonite fits well on bulky offense. A defensive backbone consisting of Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Gholdengo, and Corviknight is valuable to check threats like Dragapult and Iron Valiant, which would threaten Dragonite prior to boosting; in return, Dragonite can answer threats like Roaring Moon, Cinderace, and Volcarona for them. Garchomp, Glimmora, and Ting-Lu can reliably set entry hazards, which rack up chip damage onto walls such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Garganacl and puts revenge killers like Iron Valiant into guaranteed KO range of +1 Tera Normal Extreme Speed. Wallbreakers such as Breloom and Great Tusk can punch holes early-game and overwhelm Dragonite's checks, such as Corviknight, Dondozo, Skeledirge, and defensive Great Tusk. Moreover, Breloom can incapacitate foes with Spore to give setup opportunities for Dragonite, while Great Tusk can use Knock Off to cripple Corviknight and Dondozo and pop Gholdengo's Air Balloon. Other setup sweepers are great partners; Volcarona can threaten Corviknight, use Tera Steel Rotom-W as setup fodder, and spread burns with Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp against physical attackers such as Iron Valiant, Iron Hands, and Roaring Moon to further support Dragonite.</p> "

It is also a significantly better offensive option against opposing Dragonite, which can avoid Encore via the use of Extreme Speed, raise its own Speed with Dragon Dance, and ignore Thunder Wave with the common Lum Berry.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Fairy</strong>: Due to Dragonite’'s low Speed compared to other Dragon-types, it has a difficult time without a Fairy Tera type.</li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: In order to make the most use of Encore, max Speed is recommended.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Bold</strong>: A more defensive spread lets Dragonite preserve Terastallization against certain physical attackers, which makes it a noteworthy choice. In particular, max Defense Dragonite can use Roost to mitigate the damage from Choice Band Meowscarada without needing to Terastallize, and Substitute can survive Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Heavy-Duty Boots Generally, Leftovers preserves Dragonite’'s longevity best, as it cancels out the damage from Sandstorm and makes timer stall easier. However, the increased usage of entry hazard setter Garchomp makes Heavy-Duty Boots a strong option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet: Rocky Helmet makes it easier for Dragonite to defeat Pokemon such as opposing Dragonite, Kingambit, and Meowscarada, and its residual damage can be used to execute a win condition, especially for sets that choose not to run Fire Spin.</p> </li> </ul> "

Earthquake helps Dragonite eliminate Normal-resistant Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Heatran. Roost improves Dragonite's longevity and enables it to acquire multiple boosts against passive opponents. Roost lets Dragonite check Volcarona and rain sweepers such as Barraskewda throughout the entire match. Ice Spinner is another choice that clears the priority-blocking Psychic Terrain and hits Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Dragapult super effectively. Fire Punch can be used to hit bulky Steel-types not weak to Ground such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. An Adamant nature is usually preferred to maximize Extreme Speed's damage output, but a Jolly nature enables Dragonite to outspeed Tapu Koko and the Normal-immune Dragapult after a single Dragon Dance. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures that Dragonite will always retain Multiscale even if entry hazards are up, but if the team's entry hazard control is good, Silk Scarf is another option that boosts Extreme Speed's power. Dragonite fits well on offensive teams as a priority-using revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk and Garchomp can help chip down bulky targets such as opposing Great Tusk into range of its attacks. Tapu Lele poses a serious threat to Dragonite, as not only does its Psychic Terrain block Extreme Speed on grounded targets, but with a Choice Scarf it can also outspeed and deal massive damage to Dragonite even after setup, especially if Dragonite has not Terastallized yet. Gholdengo is a good partner, as it can switch in on and threaten Tapu Lele and prevent the opponent from removing entry hazards. Dragonite often struggles against Unaware users such as Dondozo and Skeledirge, so Pokemon that can grab momentum against them are appreciated teammates. Rotom-W and Tapu Koko can come relatively freely on Dondozo and threaten it with a Volt Switch while Heatran and Mega Diancie can switch into and set up Stealth Rock against Skeledirge. Strong wallbreakers like Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, and Zamazenta all take advantage of Pokemon that Dragonite tends to struggle with, such as Dondozo, allowing it to sweep more easily late-game.</p> "

U-turn allows it to serve as a pivot: easily switching it out of checks such as Gholdengo, Urshifu-R, and Mega Charizard Y, it brings in teammates like Tapu Koko and Dragapult to deal with them.

Close Combat KOes Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn, as well as providing a strong neutral hit against Rotom-W. Dual Wingbeat hits Clodsire and Toxapex for reliable neutral damage, hits Zamazenta super effectively, and breaks Substitute against Shed Tail hyper offense teams and Dragon Dance Dragapult. Knock Off is an alternative to hit Gholdengo reliably and remove items like Leftovers from Rotom-W and Heavy-Duty Boots from Tornadus-T, Skeledirge, and Volcarona. This allows a teammate or Mega Scizor to wear them down much more easily. Knock Off is especially relevant in Rotom-W's case, as removing Leftovers makes it easier to put into KO range of +2 Close Combat. Running Knock Off makes Toxapex a much worse matchup, however, so Pokemon like Great Tusk and Tapu Koko that can pressure it are appreciated. Sand Tomb can be used to reliably beat Clodsire, Toxapex, and Gholdengo, preventing them from reliably checking it. Offensive Mega Scizor fits much better on hyper offense teams, which appreciate its incredibly valuable—though short-term—defensive utility. Grimmsnarl is a perfect teammate, providing dual screens to let it set up against foes like Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Landorus-T; it also pivots Mega Scizor in and appreciates it baiting in Gholdengo, which prevents Grimmsnarl from pivoting as effectively. Gholdengo itself is also a notable partner, as it appreciates Mega Scizor dispatching the most popular Dark-types in Weavile and Kingambit. Entry hazards from suicide leads like Landorus-T and Garchomp allow Mega Scizor to clean late-game, as its foes must be chipped before any sweeping is done. Entry hazards particularly help in wearing down checks like Urshifu-R and bulkier Garchomp sets. Mega Scizor struggles against bulky Steel-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-W and Volcarona; Dragonite and Dragapult can take care of the latter, switching into Volcarona to set up as it switches into Mega Scizor, whereas Great Tusk can remove Leftovers from the former, making it easier for Mega Scizor to dispatch with +2 Close Combat. Physically defensive Unaware walls in Skeledirge and Dondozo completely wall Mega Scizor, so offensive Pokemon that can bait in or wear down these foes, including Iron Valiant, make for solid partners.</p> "

          "description": "<p>With Swords Dance, Scizor serves as a deadly wallbreaker and revenge killer for offensive teams. Close Combat is crucial to 2HKO defensive Rotom-W and defensive Great Tusk, as well as blow through Steel-types such as Kingambit, Orthworm, and Iron Treads. Tera Blast paired with Tera Electric has a good chance to 2HKO Dondozo and can OHKO Toxapex, Alomomola, Corviknight, and offensive Gholdengo after a Swords Dance. Tera Electric also removes Scizor's Fire weakness, improving its matchup against Volcarona and Iron Moth, and grants it crucial resistances to Roaring Moon's Acrobatics and Iron Valiant's Thunderbolt. Alternatively, Quick Attack with Tera Normal gives Scizor a tool to pick off offensive Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch, such as Volcarona, Quaquaval, and Greninja. 180 Speed EVs allow Scizor to outspeed defensive Great Tusk and Rotom-W, while 76 HP EVs improve its bulk enough to survive Tera Flying Acrobatics from Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Scizor is best utilized on fast, offensive teams that appreciate its ability to wear down common defensive cores and keep opposing sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Baxcalibur, and Booster Energy Iron Valiant in check. Glimmora and Great Tusk can set entry hazards to help chip Pokemon like Garchomp and defensive Gholdengo into range of Scizor's attacks. Grimmsnarl and Orthworm can ease Scizor's sweep by setting up screens or passing it a Substitute through Shed Tail, respectively, and appreciate falling back on Scizor to handle threats such as Iron Valiant. Special attackers like Iron Moth, Gholdengo, Greninja, and Iron Valiant can deal with the physical walls that check Scizor, such as Dondozo, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk. Scizor's ability to lure Dondozo and take it out with Tera Blast makes it an excellent partner for other physical sweepers that struggle with it, such as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur. Conversely, Breloom is an excellent partner for Quick Attack Scizor that handles Dondozo and appreciates Scizor keeping Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Dragapult in check.</p> "

Ferrothorn takes advantage of Pelipper's typing and ability to form a solid defensive core and provide a robust blanket check for opposing rain.

Bullet Seed hits various defensive Pokemon, such as Clodsire, Dondozo, and Garganacl, for significant damage.

With Tera Fire, Tera Blast lets Breloom lure in and dispatch Gholdengo and Amoonguss, the tier's predominant Spore absorbers.

Mach Punch, in conjunction with Technician, allows Breloom to pick off faster threats such as Greninja, Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Baxcalibur. Lastly, Bulldoze OHKOes Gholdengo and 2HKOes Skeledirge, while Spore lets Breloom incapacitate a switch-in and generates opportunities to take down counters later in the battle, and Rock Tomb OHKOes Volcarona while reliably hitting Dragonite and still 2HKOing Skeledirge. Tera Fighting allows Breloom to 2HKO Amoonguss after Stealth Rock with Close Combat and revenge kill threats such as Cinderace from higher health with Mach Punch. Alternatively, Tera Grass turns Bullet Seed into a powerful nuke that can break down common switch-ins like Gholdengo and generally increase its damage output, turning Breloom into a very potent stallbreaker. Tera Fire, on the other hand, gives Breloom the option to use Tera Blast in the final slot, which destroys Gholdengo and Amoonguss and allows Breloom to take a hit from, and OHKO in return, offensive Volcarona.</p> <p>Breloom fits well on bulky offense teams that can give it opportunities to come into play and capitalize on its wallbreaking prowess. Due to Breloom's low defenses and Speed, it appreciates being paired with pivots like Rotom-W and Dragapult that can help it enter battle safely. Ting-Lu and Great Tusk can set entry hazards to help Breloom break through pivots such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. Great Tusk in particular appreciates its tendency to force in Gholdengo and pop its Air Balloon, while teammates such as Garganacl, Toxapex, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo can deal with Breloom's faster offensive checks, such as Dragapult, Volcarona, and Iron Valiant. On more hyper offensive teams, Breloom is best paired with sweepers like Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Baxcalibur that appreciate its ability to wear down key defensive threats such as Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo. On these teams, leads such as Glimmora can set hazards to aid Breloom's wallbreaking capabilities.

          "description": "<p>Equipped with a Choice Scarf, Rotom-W provides excellent utility as a fast pivot thanks to its Volt Switch, devastating status moves, and high-Base Power STAB move in Hydro Pump. Volt Switch keeps up momentum during the game, and it can super effectively hit Corviknight, Dondozo, Toxapex, and Greninja, which Rotom-W now outspeeds thanks to its Choice Scarf. Hydro Pump is the strongest move it has, meaningfully hurting a wide range of Pokemon, and it punishes Ground-types such as Greak Tusk, Clodsire, and Garchomp that attempt to block Volt Switch. Rotom-W can outspeed the entire unboosted metagame with its Choice Scarf, allowing it to reliably hit Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Garganacl. Trick is essential to cripple walls that can recover from Rotom-W's attacks, like Toxapex and Tera Fairy Garganacl. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple threats such as Dragapult, Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur, especially since Choice Scarf Rotom-W outspeeds them. Will-O-Wisp is just as useful as Thunder Wave, disarming physical threats like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, Breloom, and Meowscarada. Tera Steel gives Rotom-W an immunity to Toxic from Clodsire and Toxapex, as well as a resistance to Meowscarada's Flower Trick, Breloom's Bullet Seed, Iron Valiant's Moonblast, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. On top of this, Levitate makes Steel's Ground weakness into an immunity; notably, EdgeQuake can't hit Tera Steel Rotom-W neutrally. Alternatively, Tera Water takes a more offensive approach, boosting the power of Hydro Pump to 2HKO Gholdengo, and it can potentially OHKO physically defensive Garganacl and Clodsire.</p> <p>Rotom-W sits comfortably on balance and bulky offense teams. It pairs well with defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Amoonguss, which use their Grass resistances and/or recovery to sponge hits like Breloom's Bullet Seed, Meowscarada's Flower Trick, and Ting-Lu's Ruination. Rotom-W pressures entry hazard removers like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Cinderace, which helps hazard setters. Great Tusk is a great example, since it also removes hazards to ease Rotom-W's pivoting. More offensive partners like Iron Valiant, Cinderace, and Dragapult love Rotom-W crippling bothersome walls like Ting-Lu and Amoonguss with Trick. In turn, they can effectively check Breloom, Meowscarada, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Choice Specs Dragapult, which can all cause trouble for Rotom-W. When Rotom-W pivots against Corviknight, Dondozo, Toxapex, and Greninja as they switch out, frail attackers such as Meowscarada, Cinderace, and Iron Valiant can safely come in to pressure the incoming Amoonguss, opposing Rotom-W, and Gholdengo.</p> "

Garchomp, notably, is vulnerable to sleep and is heavily damaged by Leaf Storm. Dondozo is similarly 2HKOed if it doesn't run Assault Vest, even after a Commander boost, and also susceptible to sleep.</p> </li> <li> <p>As Torkoal excels on Trick Room teams, Lilligant will often end up teaming with Trick Room Pokemon. Indeedee's Psychic Terrain and Farigiraf's Armor Tail protect Lilligant from priority moves such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed, and both appreciate Lilligant's ability to disable Dark-type Pokemon such as Kingambit with Sleep Powder. After You lets Guts Hariyama turn the tables on faster Pokemon, and it protects Lilligant in return with Wide Guard and Fake Out. Annihilape appreciates Sleep Powder giving it free turns to use Bulk Up so it can sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p>Talonflame and Murkrow can preempt Lilligant despite Chlorophyll with priority Tailwind, Taunt, and Quash. Similarly, Lilligant hates it when other weather setters hit the field due to its sudden drop in Speed.</p> </li> </ul> ",

Wide Lens is an option to shore up Sleep Powder's and Leaf Storm's consistency, but it leaves Lilligant vulnerable to OHKOs from most strong attackers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Timid Lilligant is usually superior due to it outrunning Pokemon like Timid Gholdengo in Tailwind. Modest Lilligant can nab potential OHKOs on the likes of Maushold, bulky Rotom-W, and Tera Ground Garchomp, however, while having a very high chance of 2HKOing Garchomp before Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lilligant will rarely Terastallize but still has decent options. Tera Water lets it survive a Fire-type attack without giving it too many weaknesses. Tera Flying allows it to pair with an Earthquake user and continue to provide support. Tera Blast with Tera Ground covers Steel- and Fire-types such as Armarouge, Ceruledge, and Gholdengo but is generally not worth it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Helping Hand gives Lilligant a good priority move to use in Trick Room, boosting Torkoal's spread damage to staggering levels. Quiver Dance allows Lilligant to maintain speed control outside of sun and gives its offense more bite. Energy Ball gives Lilligant a more consistent attack than Leaf Storm and is the attack of choice with Quiver Dance, but its unboosted damage leaves a lot to be desired.

Its defensive prowess, coupled with Regenerator, provides it the sustainability to soak up hits while supporting its team. Due to its effectiveness, Amoonguss finds itself on a large variety of team styles, from Trick Room to hyper offense. Setup attackers such as Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Swords Dance Iron Hands appreciate its redirection and healing capabilities, and they make up for its near-nonexistent offenses. Amoonguss's Grass / Poison typing provides resistances to key attackers such as Palafin-H and Iron Hands but leaves it weak to Fire- and Ice-types like Chi-Yu and Chien-Pao. Further, its passivity diminishes its utility against status-immune Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Garganacl. Finally, opposing Grass-types such as Meowscarada, Abomasnow, and Tera Grass Iron Hands and Safety Goggles users such as Farigiraf and Sylveon are immune to Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, invalidating its support options.</p> ",

Occa Berry allows Amoonguss to survive a Heat Wave from Choice Specs Chi-Yu and Eruption from Charcoal Torkoal.

It can set up Stealth Rock while being a solid defensive answer to Pokemon such as Drifloon, Deerling, and both forms of Zorua, or it can use Swords Dance and Defiant to become a top-tier sweeper with Sucker Punch. Low Sweep threatens opposing Pawniard, OHKOing after Stealth Rock damage, while also providing Speed control against common switch-ins like Crabrawler. Alternatively, teams that don't fear opposing Pawniard can opt for Night Slash, a consistent source of STAB damage that threatens bulky Water-types and pairs best with Swords Dance. Flying and Ghost are both strong defensive Tera types that address Pawniard's key weaknesses; Tera Flying is a better choice against Diglett, whereas Tera Ghost is better against Fighting-types and doesn't add a Stealth Rock weakness. Tera Dark as an offensive option is more niche, but on Swords Dance + Night Slash sets, it can easily invalidate common Pawniard checks such as Quaxly and Mareanie. One of the best partners for Pawniard is Toedscool, as it is similarly versatile and counters the Pokemon Pawniard struggles with, such as bulky Water-types, Fuecoco, Diglett, and Mudbray. Other great partners are Ghost-types like Drifloon and Hisuian Zorua, as they exploit Fighting-types like Mankey and Crabrawler, which easily KO Pawniard. Most teammates appreciate Pawniard's versatility: Crabrawler, Toedscool, and Drifloon all heavily appreciate its defensive utility, as it switches into these Pokemon's common checks like Hisuian Zorua and Deerling. Pawniard also shines on teams without Glimmet that need a reliable Stealth Rock user, as well as Sticky Web teams that want a potent set-up sweeper and something to deter Drifloon's Defog.</p> "

It is one of the best checks to Gholdengo and also pairs well with it, forming a fundamentally powerful core when used with Tailwind support from Murkrow. Armarouge and Garchomp also synergize well with Hydreigon, covering for Steel-types, which it may not be able to damage effectively depending on its Tera type. Hydreigon can, however, struggle against damage reduction such as Snarl and Light Screen, with the latter coming especially from Grimmsnarl, which can easily take its STAB moves and OHKO it back with Spirit Break if Hydreigon is not Terastallized. Repeated usage of Draco Meteor can also make Hydreigon deal unimpressive amounts of damage, but this can be counteracted with Haze from Murkrow, allowing it to continue dealing devastating damage.</p> </li> </ul> ",

          "description": "<p>Offensive Volcarona is an extremely threatening late-game sweeper due to its access to Quiver Dance alongside its powerful STAB moves, great offensive coverage, and excellent utilization of Terastallization both defensively and offensively to dramatically limit its counterplay. Flamethrower is a strong, consistent STAB move with more PP than Fiery Dance that can always OHKO offensive Great Tusk after a Quiver Dance, but Fiery Dance can allow Volcarona to quickly snowball should it accrue additional boosts with it. Bug Buzz is a similarly consistent attack that hits Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon super effectively and offers strong neutral coverage against threats like Garchomp and Dondozo. Bug Buzz also bypasses opposing Substitutes, which improves its matchup against teams that rely on Orthworm's Shed Tail. Giga Drain grants Volcarona some additional longevity and allows it to hit Water-types like Dondozo, Azumarill, and Quaquaval very hard. Tera Blast offers powerful, diverse coverage depending on Volcarona's choice of Tera type. Substitute is worth considering to block status effects from the likes of Toxapex and Nuzzle Hatterene, prevent revenge killing attempts, and ease setup opportunities, especially against teams featuring Sucker Punch users like Kingambit and Meowscarada. Moreover, Substitute alongside Giga Drain and Tera Grass allows Volcarona to reliably beat Clodsire one-on-one, as Clodsire cannot break Volcarona's Substitute with a single Earthquake and Giga Drain outheals damage taken from Substitute. Heavy-Duty Boots is almost mandatory to run on Volcarona, as the item removes its otherwise-crippling weakness to all forms of entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock. Flame Body improves Volcarona's defensive utility by deterring contact moves from Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and Kingambit. Tera Ground grants Volcarona an Electric immunity and turns its crippling Rock weakness into a resistance while giving Volcarona's Tera Blast Ground-type coverage to deal with Toxapex, Clodsire, and opposing Fire-types like Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Tera Fire Kingambit. Alternatively, Tera Fairy provides a Dragon immunity and an overall strong defensive typing and allows Volcarona's Tera Blast to threaten Dragon-types like Baxcalibur, Dragapult, Dragonite, and Garchomp as well as Fighting-types like Quaquaval and Iron Hands. If it opts to drop Tera Blast or Substitute and Giga Drain, Volcarona can utilize many other Tera types: Tera Fire or Bug to strengthen its existing STAB moves, Tera Psychic alongside Psychic to enable maximum damage against Toxapex and Fighting-types and offer a significant chance to 2HKO Clodsire, Tera Steel for an immunity to Poison and a generally strong defensive profile, and even Tera Rock alongside Tera Blast to lure in and eliminate opposing Volcarona while still hitting Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Dragonite super effectively.</p> <p>Volcarona is a very powerful win condition for offensive teams and greatly appreciates any sort of support that helps facilitate its sweep. Offensive Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Glimmora are fantastic teammates for Volcarona. Great Tusk and Garchomp provide entry hazard support and can wear down checks like Garganacl and Clodsire, while Glimmora trades immediate power for the ability to stack multiple entry hazards. Lead Meowscarada also makes for an effective teammate due to its ability to reliably set up Spikes while disrupting passive threats like Toxapex and Clodsire, drastically limiting Grimmsnarl leads, and preventing setup from offensive staples like Dragonite, Kingambit, and opposing Volcarona with its fast Taunt. In return, Volcarona can threaten Corviknight, preventing its Defog from removing entry hazards. Volcarona greatly appreciates dual screens support from Grimmsnarl and Shed Tail support from Orthworm to open up more setup opportunities. Orthworm in particular completely walls Clodsire, turning it into free opportunities to use Shed Tail. Iron Valiant, Choice Band Breloom, and Choice Band Dragapult can help wear down or remove walls like Clodsire, specially defensive Skeledirge, and Garganacl, allowing Volcarona to more easily finish the job against them or to sweep outright. Volcarona is very limited by its moveslots and therefore appreciates teammates that provide the coverage Volcarona itself cannot always run; Tera Fairy Volcarona appreciates strong Ground-type attacks from Great Tusk and Garchomp to remove Clodsire, Skeledirge, and Toxapex, while Tera Grass and Tera Ground Volcarona appreciate Choice Band Dragapult's ability to pressure Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp, as well as opposing Volcarona, with Dragon Darts. Other sweepers like Kingambit and Tera Normal Dragonite are effective teammates for offensive Volcarona, as they can use their great bulk and powerful priority to beat strong physical attackers like Dragapult, Baxcalibur, and Cinderace that Volcarona itself may not be able to set up against or eliminate. In cases where Volcarona itself cannot sweep, it can still use its power and coverage to enable another teammate's sweep. For example, Iron Valiant appreciates Tera Ground and Tera Psychic Volcarona's ability to wear down or eliminate Toxapex and Clodsire, allowing it to more freely spam its powerful Moonblast late-game, while Dragonite appreciates Volcarona's ability to deal with Corviknight.</p> "

Fire Blast can be slotted over Flamethrower to hit much harder, notably OHKOing most variants of Gholdengo, but Flamethrower is usually better because of its consistency. Volcarona can utilize Giga Drain with Tera Grass to hit a plethora of Water-type Pokemon like Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Urshifu-R hard, in addition to Ground- and Rock-types such as Great Tusk and Garganacl. Hidden Power Ground and Tera Ground help Volcarona bypass checks like Toxapex and Heatran after slight chip damage while also removing Volcaronra’s glaring Rock weakness. Psychic with Tera Psychic allows Volcarona to break through Clodsire and Toxapex more reliably, but it is inferior to either of the previously mentioned Tera types due to its greater vulnerability to being revenge killed, and it leaves Volcarona completely stonewalled by Heatran. Flame Body can threaten to burn physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Zamazenta, crippling them. Maximum Speed investment and a Timid Nature lets Volcarona outrun Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R after a boost. Modest can be run to hit walls like Clodsire and Toxapex harder, but it leaves Volcarona much more vulnerable to the aforementioned Choice Scarf users. Volcarona’s defensive utility is appreciated by allies such as Urshifu-R and Kingambit, as it can check dangerous Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta in a pinch. Bulky Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp can use it as setup fodder—with the latter additionally threatening Volcarona’s longevity with Toxic—so allies that can handle them such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W are great partners to support Volcarona in its sweep. Heatran and Toxapex wall Volcarona if it doesn’t have Hidden Power Ground, so teammates like that can check them such as Garchomp and the aforementioned Rotom-W are much appreciated. Heatran also makes for a great ally, as it can eliminate or cripple Toxapex, Clodsire, and Skeledirge, which clears the way for Volcarona to clean up late-game.</p> "

Will-O-Wisp makes Volcarona more utility-oriented, threatening physical attackers like Zamazenta and Dragonite with a burn more reliably, crippling them. However, the lack of coverage leaves Volcarona walled easily by most Fire-resistant Pokemon. The given Speed EVs allow Volcarona to outspeed Dragapult after a Quiver Dance, with the rest invested in HP and Defense so that it will always be 3HKOed by Zamazenta and defensive Great Tusk’s Earthquake. Volcarona struggles with status conditions, as they can hinder its ability to check threats like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant in the long term, thus status absorbers like Gliscor and Toxapex make good partners; the former provides Defog support, a Knock Off absorber, and a Heatran check, and the latter helps prepare Volcarona’s sweep with Knock Off and status inducement. Volcarona can be easily exploited by setup sweepers like Garchomp, Dragapult, Mega Tyranitar, and Dragonite, and so checks like Rotom-W, Kingambit, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Lele can help to alleviate these matchups.</p> "

Its naturally high Speed tier is invaluable to outpace and threaten fast foes such as Iron Valiant and Sandy Shocks. Aside from hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types like Bronzong and Gholdengo, Dark Pulse's lack of immunities makes it a spammable attack that can be used to muscle past neutral Pokemon such as Corviknight with flinches. Ice Beam covers a large portion of the metagame, including Dragon, Ground, Grass, and Flying teams, decimating prominent foes like Hydreigon, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Iron Jugulis. It's also Greninja's hardest hitting attack against Skuntank, which is important in the Poison matchup. Extrasensory pressures Poison- and Fighting-types like Toxapex and Assault Vest Iron Hands and prevents Greninja from being picked off by Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot rounds out its coverage, significantly damaging Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Water-types such as Gastrodon and Dondozo.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja appreciates being paired with other wallbreakers like Barraskewda and Quaquaval that can handle Normal and Steel teams. They break through bulky Pokemon like Blissey and Kingambit that Greninja struggles with; they are also potent late-game cleaners that enjoy Greninja's ability to threaten Storm Drain Gastrodon and their physically defensive checks like Amoonguss, Toxapex, Slowbro, and Dondozo. Moreover, Barraskewda under rain excels at tearing down fast offensive teams that Greninja can struggle with, as it can threaten out Meowscarada, boosted Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Iron Moth. Quaquaval can also run Rapid Spin to let Greninja enter the field multiple times to wallbreak without worry, preventing it from being chipped down into KO range of priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Baxcalibur's Ice Shard. Pivot support from Slowking is helpful to bring Greninja in safely on foes like Dragalge and Gastrodon, letting it fire off attacks freely. Defensive teammates such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Gastrodon, and Quagsire can switch into potential revenge killers like Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Dragapult, and Slither Wing, respectively; notably, Gastrodon and Quagsire also provide entry hazards to take advantage of the countless switches that Greninja forces, putting the likes of Ting-Lu, Toxapex, and Assault Vest Iron Hands into Greninja's KO range, as well as switch into and check Electric-types such as Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks and Assault Vest Iron Hands.</p> "

It can switch into and counter Pokemon like Volcarona, Cinderace, and Greninja, scout for Choice item users like Dragapult, Breloom, and Iron Valiant, and absorb Toxic Spikes from Glimmora and opposing Toxapex. Surf forces damage onto Toxic-immune foes such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, Iron Moth, and Kingambit. Toxic shuts down Pokemon such as Dragonite, Volcarona, Baxcalibur, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W, and if Toxapex should run Toxic Spikes, it matches up well against offensive teams that contain setup sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk. Any attempts of boosting past Toxapex gets shut down easily by Haze, which combined with poison damage prevents Toxapex from being used as setup fodder by Pokemon such as Substitute Baxcalibur and Calm Mind Hatterene. Covert Cloak is an option to ignore Garganacl's Salt Cure, Dragapult and Gholdengo's Shadow Ball drops, and Greninja's Dark Pulse flinches, but Leftovers's longevity reduces Toxapex's reliance on Recover, and it is used over Black Sludge in case Toxapex decides to Terastallize. Tera Steel improves Toxapex's matchup against non-Earthquake Roaring Moon and Meowscarada while still maintaining an immunity to poison. Alternatively, Tera Fairy fares better against Dragapult, Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. The given EVs allow Toxapex to survive two Choice Band Meowscarada's Flower Trick from full health.</p> <p>Toxapex fits nicely on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate a sturdy defensive backbone. Teammates like Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl are terrific defensive partners that covers Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Tera Electric Iron Valiant, respectively. Corviknight and Great Tusk in particular provide a backup check to multiple combinations of physical attackers like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Kingambit that attempt to overwhelm Toxapex. They also remove entry hazards, which would mitigate Toxapex's Regenerator and force it to use Recover more often; in return, Toxapex covers Pokemon such as Cinderace for the former and Greninja for the latter. Bulky setup sweepers like Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo can take advantage of Toxic Spikes slowly chipping down checks such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Particularly, Skeledirge and Gholdengo can make use of Hex easily to take advantage of Toxapex spreading poison, as well as threaten Hatterene, which can block Toxapex's Toxic Spikes and use non-Haze variants as setup fodder. Offensive partners like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit compensate for Toxapex's overall passivity; in return, they appreciate Toxapex switching into their revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Scizor, and Iron Valiant, respectively.</p> "

This allows it to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Dragapult and Zamazenta and pivot around powerful attackers such as Iron Valiant. Scald and Knock Off allow Toxapex to meaningfully threaten foes and make progress by either causing crippling status or removing the foe's item respectively, while Toxic takes advantage of Toxapex's excellent bulk and Regenerator, putting foes on a timer for its teammates. Haze removes boosts from the likes of Dragon Dance Dragapult and Espathra. Other options such as Toxic Spikes and Baneful Bunker can be explored over either Toxic or Haze, with the intent to cripple offensive teams or maximize Toxapex's ability to scout and pivot, respectively. However, removing Toxic leaves Toxapex worse off against common Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Rotom-W, while removing Haze makes it harder to handle setup sweepers. Although Toxapex rarely Terastallizes, Tera Dragon ensures Rotom-W's Volt Switch never outdamages Regenerator while also removing its Ground and Electric weaknesses against the likes of Great Tusk and Tapu Koko. The EV spread maximizes Toxapex's physical Bulk while allowing it to survive two Scorching Sands from Mega Charizard Y. Toxapex fits best on defensively oriented teams, which don't mind its passivity and can make up for any of its defensive shortcomings. Toxapex pairs well with Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Clodsire, which can handle setup sweepers that Toxapex falters to such as Kingambit and Gholdengo. In return, Toxapex sponges various weaker attacks using Regenerator from the likes of Gastrodon and Rotom-W. Toxapex dislikes losing its item, as it can easily be pushed into KO range against wallbreakers such as Zamazenta and Dragapult alongside entry hazards. As such, Pokemon that can generally withstand Knock Off well, such as Flyinium Z Tornadus-T and Gliscor, pair excellently with it. Tornadus-T in particular makes for a great partner, as it can use Regenerator alongside Toxapex, pivoting between each other to handle Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Garganacl. Toxapex appreciates extra insurance against strong special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. As such, Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Heatran pair well, especially since Toxapex can switch into the Shadow Balls and Focus Blasts aimed that them respectively.</p> "

Slowking has the added benefit of being another slow pivot as well, while Ting-Lu forms a strong entry hazard core with Corviknight and threatens Gholdengo.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Calm Mind Hatterene is an excellent option on balance teams to deny entry hazards from being set up. With Magic Bounce, it can switch into and reflect entry hazards from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Blissey. From there, it can begin setting up Calm Mind to pose a greater threat itself and overwhelm the opponent's defensive answers to it. Draining Kiss acts as pseudo-recovery and can help Hatterene heal off damage it's taken from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk. Psyshock allows Hatterene to deal high damage to special walls such as Blissey and Clodsire and win potential setup wars against other Hatterene and Volcarona. Stored Power fulfills a similar role to Psyshock in enabling Hatterene to break through special walls and other Calm Mind users and can also help Hatterene defeat various Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Dondozo, but it requires Hatterene to set up multiple Calm Minds before it becomes truly potent. Mystical Fire deals high damage to many of Hatterene's common switch-ins such as Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Kingambit and has the nice bonus of lowering the target's Special Attack, which is particularly useful against Gholdengo that aren't running Covert Cloak. Nuzzle is another option to cripple switch-ins with paralysis, which can act as useful speed control for Hatterene's teammates. Tera Water nullifies all of Hatterene's weaknesses, which can grant it more opportunities to use Calm Mind against its checks such as Gholdengo, while Tera Fire can similarly neutralize all of Hatterene's weaknesses and comes with additional benefits such as boosting the damage of its Mystical Fire and letting it check Iron Valiant and Volcarona better. However, Tera Fire also comes with notable downsides, namely giving Hatterene a weakness to Ground-type moves and Stealth Rock, which can hinder its matchups against common entry hazard setters. The EV spread allows Hatterene to move reliably switch into physical attacks from common entry hazard setters while also outspeeding Toxapex and Garganacl.</p> <p>Hatterene's ability to discourage the use of entry hazards will be appreciated by almost any team. Pokemon vulnerable to entry hazards and those that frequently pivot in and out of battle such as Meowscarada, Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Dragapult enjoy Hatterene's support. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight are also good partners, as Hatterene's presence can ease the burden placed on them to remove entry hazards and grants the team greater flexibility in dealing with entry hazard setters. Furthermore, while Hatterene can switch into entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, it can be worn down quickly from their repeated Ground-type attacks. Great Tusk and Corviknight can reduce Hatterene's need to switch in as often by acting as alternative switch-ins. Due to relying on Leftovers and Draining Kiss for recovery, Hatterene can struggle to stay healthy, particularly if it loses its Leftovers to Knock Off or is hit by Salt Cure, so it is recommended to have teammates that can switch into these moves. Corviknight can switch into Knock Off from hazard setters such as Meowscarada and Great Tusk, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo can neutralize Salt Cure. Pokemon holding Rocky Helmet such as Corviknight can be troublesome for Hatterene, as they will wear Hatterene down when it uses Nuzzle or Draining Kiss. Covert Cloak users, especially Gholdengo, are similarly irritating for Hatterene due to nullifying the secondary effect of its Nuzzle or Mystical Fire. Knock Off support from Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and Iron Valiant is thus appreciated to remove these items from the opponent's Pokemon. Hatterene's weakness to Steel- and Ghost-type attacks can be exploited by strong attackers such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Kingambit. Kingambit and Tera Water Garganacl can reliably switch into Gholdengo and Dragapult, while Great Tusk and Dondozo can counter Kingambit.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Possessing OU's highest unboosted Speed tier makes Choice Specs Dragapult a very remarkable special wallbreaker, revenge killer, and offensive pivot. It outspeeds and threatens common offensive threats like Cinderace, Iron Moth, and even boosted foes like Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. Moreover, it's immune or resistant to common priority attacks like the aforementioned Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Breloom's Mach Punch, and Slither Wing's First Impression, which makes it much harder to revenge kill. It is also able to switch into and check Rotom-W. A coverage move in either Flamethrower or Thunder lets Dragapult nail Corviknight, with the former also hitting other Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads, while the latter pressures Toxapex and Tera Water Garganacl. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to bypass Grimmsnarl's dual screens, Orthworm's Shed Tail, and Substitute users like Gholdengo, which gives it an edge against hyper offense teams. Tera Ghost maintains an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and strengthens Shadow Ball—its most spammable attack—notably guaranteeing the 2HKO on Corviknight and Assault Vest Iron Treads after Terastallizing. Tera Fairy prevents Dragapult from being picked off by opposing Dragapult and Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Meowscarada. Finally, Tera Dragon turns Draco Meteor into an even more powerful nuke. This takes advantage of the lack of prominent bulky Steel- and Fairy-types in the metagame, notably chunking answers to Ghost-types like Purifying Salt Garganacl and Ting-Lu and 2HKOing Unaware Clodsire.</p> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult fits perfectly on bulky offense and VoltTurn teams. Physical wallbreakers like Chien-Pao and Great Tusk appreciate Dragapult's U-turn bringing them in safely, and they are able to pressure its switch-ins like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Garganacl. Entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Great Tusk allow Dragapult to pivot throughout the game unperturbed; the former can also pivot it in safely via U-turn, letting it threaten Gholdengo, which tends to switch into Corviknight to block its Defog. Furthermore, Corviknight and Great Tusk provide the necessary defensive backbone to switch into boosted threats such as Roaring Moon, as well as revenge kill attempts from Sucker Punch users like Kingambit and Chien-Pao. Gholdengo forms a Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can overwhelm a shared check in Ting-Lu, use non-Calm Mind Blissey as setup fodder, and either cripple Tera Water Garganacl with Trick or straight up dent Tera Fairy variants. Entry hazards from Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Garganacl can quickly put foes into Dragapult's KO range, especially as it tends to force a lot of switches; in return, Dragapult spinblocks foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch. Setup sweepers like Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Swords Dance Chien-Pao appreciate Dragapult wallbreaking early-game for them to clean up late-game easily.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Choice Band Dragapult utilizes its near-unresisted STAB moves, its blistering Speed stat, and its excellent Attack stat to function as a strong physical wallbreaker. The choice for the second move depends on what Tera type Dragapult chooses. Tera Dragon Dragapult uses Phantom Force for a Ghost-type STAB move, but Tera Ghost uses Tera Blast, since, unlike Phantom Force, it is not a two-turn move. Sucker Punch allows Dragapult to revenge kill weakened sweepers such as opposing Dragapult, as well as Iron Moth and Tera Flying Roaring Moon after some chip damage. However, be careful when using Sucker Punch, since opponents can predict it and set up. An Adamant nature gives Dragapult extra wallbreaking power, at the cost of being outsped by threats like Chien-Pao. Alternatively, a Jolly nature allows Dragapult to outspeed the entirety of the unboosted metagame. With Tera Dragon, Dragapult's Dragon Darts becomes harder to switch into; it 2HKOes walls Dragapult normally struggles with such as Ting-Lu. Tera Dragon Dragapult is also less susceptible to Sucker Punch, albeit at the cost of losing its immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is a fantastic partner, since it's able to check Dark-types such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Hazard removal from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for good partners, since Dragapult's lack of longevity makes it difficult to switch in when hazards are up. Great Tusk and Corviknight are able to beat both Scizor and opposing Great Tusk, while Cinderace can threaten bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight. Dragapult benefits from entry hazards from the likes of Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, since it can more effectively wallbreak with entry hazards up. Other pivots such as Scizor and Rotom-W appreciate that Dragapult's U-turn can bring them in. In return, Scizor can revenge kill Ice-types such as Chien-Pao, while Rotom-W can check both Corviknight and defensive Great Tusk. Paralysis support from Rotom-W can shutdown offensive Pokemon like opposing Dragapult and Roaring Moon. Lastly, Gholdengo makes for a good teammate, since it can spinblock and deny Defog and can help Dragapult overwhelm shared checks like Kingambit and Ting-Lu.</p> "

          "name": "Utility",
          "description": "<p>Unlike its more offensively oriented Choice item sets, this Dragapult set goes for a more multifunctional approach. Dragapult's unmatched Speed tier, in conjunction with STAB Dragon Darts, allows it to snipe key offensive threats such as Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Cinderace with some prior chip damage. This often means that Dragapult will force a lot of switches which can be capitalized on with Will-O-Wisp to spread status and power up Hex. Will-O-Wisp also allows Dragapult to avoid Sucker Punch, which can come in handy against Cinderace, Kingambit, and Meowscarada. With a burn and Stealth Rock up, Hex 2HKOs Defensive Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Dondozo, allowing Dragapult to pick apart balanced cores. Finally, U-Turn rounds out the set, letting Dragapult keep momentum up even against hard counters like Ting-Lu and Garganacl. 252 Speed EVs with a Hasty nature ensure that Dragapult outspeeds the entire unboosted tier. 76 Attack EVs ensure an OHKO on Roaring Moon with Dragon Darts, while the rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack. Although Dragapult does not typically find itself needing to Terastallize very often, Ghost is most commonly used to power up Hex even further. For example, Tera Ghost Hex does a minimum of 84% to a burnt Defensive Great Tusk. In a pinch however, Terastallization can be used defensively to avoid OHKOs like from Chien-Pao's Ice Shard.</p> <p>Because of the amount of utility it provides, Dragapult appreciates plentiful chip damage from its teammates, as it lacks immediate power. All forms of entry hazards are greatly appreciated due to Dragapult's ability to force out the opponent, so entry hazard setters like Garganacl, Great Tusk, Glimmora and Ting-Lu form good teammates. Stealth Rock is particularly important since it secures important 2HKOs with Hex. Among the entry hazard setters, Garganacl has fantastic synergy with Dragapult, as it is able to set up Stealth Rock while also chipping down foes with Salt Cure. Partners that can spread status such as Rotom-W and Skeledirge are also excellent teammates. Since Ting-Lu and Garganacl stonewall this set, teammates that scare them out such as Offensive Great Tusk and Banded Meowscarada are great partners. Tera Flying Covert Cloak Gholdengo forms a particularly potent Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can turn common counters to Dragapult such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl into setup fodder. Physical sweepers like Chien-Pao and Kingambit appreciate having their counters like Corviknight and Great Tusk crippled with burns and have solid type synergy with Dragapult. Due to this set being most potent in the mid- to late-game, it's more at home in teams with solid defensive backbones that can sponge hits. Defensive pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Hatterene, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Amoonguss can all soak damage for Dragapult from common checks like Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit while setting up entry hazards, spreading status, or dealing chip damage, allowing Dragapult to clean up later in the game.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Dragapult is one of the most dangerous setup sweepers in the tier due to its blazing Speed and immense power. After a Dragon Dance, Dragapult outspeeds all Choice Scarf and Booster Energy users, such as Kartana, Greninja, and Iron Valiant, making it extremely hard to stop if it sets up successfully. Ghostium Z-powered Phantom Force enables a boosted Dragapult to blast through bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Heatran after slight chip damage. Dragapult's typing gives it opportunities to switch in and set up against certain Pokemon such as Volcarona, non-Ice Spinner Dragonite, and Urshifu-R locked into a Fighting-type move. Substitute is the preferred option in the last moveslot to ease prediction and facilitate setup while also avoiding priority. Substitute also allows Dragapult to play mind games with Kingambit. Fire Blast is another option that allows Dragapult to deal massive damage to physically defensive Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, both of which can survive a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare at full health. Clear Body is the preferred ability to avoid stat drops from Intimidate, but Infiltrator can also be used to improve the matchup against dual screens and Shed Tail teams. A Jolly nature lets Dragapult outspeed Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko prior to setting up. Dragon Dance Dragapult fits best on offensive teams, where it can function as a potent late-game cleaner with its Z-Move. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Glimmora can help chip bulky foes such as Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit into range of Dragapult's attacks. Gholdengo can block attempts to remove entry hazards, as well as pressure certain physical walls that give Dragapult a hard time, such as Ferrothorn. Dragapult can struggle with bulky physical walls such as Dondozo, Garganacl, and post-Tera Skeledirge, so powerful special wallbreakers that can take advantage of these Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y, are greatly appreciated. Tapu Lele also provides Psychic Terrain, which thwarts revenge killing attempts from priority moves. A late-game cleaner such as Dragonite or Booster Energy Iron Valiant can take advantage of the holes Dragapult left behind in the enemy defensive core.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Despite Hex Dragapult's lack of immediate offensive presence, it can be a very annoying threat; it excels in getting around many of Dragapult's normal checks and counters, pivoting to dangerous teammates, and spreading status. Against common checks like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Toxapex, it can bring in Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Great Tusk, and Tapu Koko, respectively, to punish the opponent. Will-O-Wisp boosts Hex to monstrous levels and threatens to pacify physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Kingambit. Dragon Darts is a strong physical move to better hit special walls like Clodsire, forcing it to recover lest Dragapult's teammates like Iron Valiant break through. With Tera Ghost, it can muscle through specially defensive Toxapex after burn and entry hazard damage with Hex, though Tera Fairy helps it tank hits from opposing Dragapult and Dark-type moves like Pursuit, and it can still check Zamazenta. Infiltrator allows it to check threats behind Substitutes, most notably Iron Defense Zamazenta and Shed Tail receivers like Dragonite. Dragapult struggles to break through Heatran, so Pokemon that can pressure it such as Garchomp and Rotom-W are great partners. It also must be careful around Pursuit trappers like Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar, as even after a burn they heavily chip it; teammates like Urshifu-R, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk are thus mandatory to threaten said trappers. Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y very much appreciate Dragapult crippling and weakening Kingambit and Tyranitar, respectively, as this aids in the process of removing them. In return, Dragapult can clean up the opposing team after its checks are gone. Pivots like Rotom-W and Corviknight bring Dragapult in, with the former checking Heatran and forming a nice VoltTurn core with it, and the latter tanking Dragon- and Fairy-type moves for it. Entry hazards and Knock Off from the likes of Ferrothorn and Great Tusk weaken the opposition for Dragapult to clean, notably its checks like Toxapex and Clodsire.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Dragapult is a menacing wallbreaker, being able to threaten many teams with its STAB Shadow Ball and Draco Meteor. The former in particular is very spammable, as only a limited pool of Pokemon can switch into it. U-turn takes advantage of this limited pool, pressuring Shadow Ball switch-ins like Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar while bringing in teammates such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Flamethrower hits Kingambit for massive damage, while Hydro Pump helps against Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu. Finally, Thunder pressures would-be checks, such as Toxapex. Ghost is the best Tera type for Dragapult, as it propels its Shadow Ball to a near-unstoppable level, making it even more spammable. Dragon boosts Draco Meteor's damage while making Dragapult less susceptible to Pursuit, while Tera Fairy purely helps it defensively: not only does it not fear Pursuit, but it's also not weak to Ice Shard or Sucker Punch from Weavile and Kingambit, respectively. Finally, it gives Dragapult a Dragon immunity, which allows you to beat Dragon Dance Dragapult after it burns the Z-Move. Dragapult must be wary of Pursuit from Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit, as they can both shrug off multiple Shadow Balls and remove it from the game. However, it can pivot around its checks, so Pokemon that can take advantage of and remove them make great partners, such as Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant. The latter two also share checks with Dragapult, like Clodsire and Toxapex, meaning they can overwhelm these checks. Dragapult also greatly appreciates Knock Off support from Tornadus-T, Weavile, or Ferrothorn, as its checks such as Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Garganacl all rely a lot on their items. Finally, since checks such as the aforementioned Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit are very susceptible to Spikes, Dragapult appreciates its setters such as Ting-Lu, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon.</p> "

Moreover, its immunity to Prankster Taunt from Grimmsnarl, another common lead, lets Meowscarada get the leg up against opposing offensive teams. Taunt in conjunction with its insane Speed tier allows Meowscarada to shut down opposing entry hazard setters and removers like Garchomp, Glimmora, Iron Moth, and Corviknight, annoy defensive Pokemon like Clodsire and Toxapex, and prevent foes such as Volcarona, Kingambit, and Dragonite from using it as setup fodder. Aside from threatening Grass-resistant Pokemon like Dragapult, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo, Knock Off's utility allows Meowscarada to soften up and cripple defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Toxapex, and it works well with Spikes by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Scizor. Even with Meowscarada's middling Special Attack, Leaf Storm boosted by Overgrow can cleanly OHKO defensive Great Tusk, one of the metagame's most common entry hazard removers. Focus Sash guarantees that Meowscarada can set at least one layer of Spikes and safely puts Meowscarada into Overgrow range. Tera Ghost can be used in a pinch to spinblock Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Torkoal.</p> <p>Meowscarada excels at setting up the tempo for hyper offense teams. Offensive Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp and Great Tusk can stack entry hazards to put even more pressure on the opposing team, with mixed Garchomp threatening Corviknight from using Defog; in return, Meowscarada's Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Dragonite and Volcarona to make them susceptible to Stealth Rock. By stacking entry hazards, Gholdengo becomes a near-mandatory teammate to prevent every attempt of hazard removal; Gholdengo also takes advantage of entry hazards itself to pressure checks like Toxapex and Clodsire, which makes Nasty Plot variants particularly difficult to deal with. Setup sweepers commonly found on hyper offense teams such as Dragonite, Kingambit, Baxcalibur, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth appreciate Spikes chipping down Pokemon like Dondozo, Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Clodsire. Furthermore, they enjoy Meowscarada crippling defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Amoonguss with Knock Off, with Dragonite and Kingambit in particular also appreciating Meowscarada luring in and dealing with Great Tusk.</p> "

Unlike other walls, however, Skeledirge can also be a foreboding wincon with Torch Song and its great offensive typing, which gives it nearly unresisted coverage. Will-O-Wisp gives it value against switch-ins such as Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Clodsire and cripples physical attackers like Great Tusk and Garchomp. Hex benefits from Skeledirge spreading burns, 2HKOing Pokemon such as Dragonite, Iron Hands, and physically defensive Dondozo unboosted, and Toxapex after a single boost from Torch Song. Tera Fairy bolsters Skeledirge against Dragon-types that would otherwise overwhelm it like Dragapult, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Baxcalibur. It also lets Skeledirge beat Quaquaval and lose its Ground weakness, letting it more easily spread burns against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Garchomp. In a pinch, it can bait Dark-type moves from Pokemon like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Meowscarada, Terastallize the same turn, and punish them with Will-O-Wisp. Tera Fairy also maintains Skeledirge's ability to beat Iron Valiant, Volcarona, and Hatterene.</p> <p>Skeledirge fits on many bulky offense, balance, and stall teams as a much-appreciated answer to common wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene. Skeledirge often ends up entry hazard fodder for Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Thus, secure hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight are excellent partners. Additionally, Great Tusk can 2HKO the aforementioned Pokemon, helping set Skeledirge up for a potential sweep, while Corviknight walls the aforementioned Ground-types, can bring Skeledirge in later with U-turn, and can absorb Knock Off from the likes of Great Tusk, Meowscarada, and Iron Treads. Pokemon such as Meowscarada and Iron Valiant can overwhelm Skeledirge answers like Gholdengo, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu. In addition to this, they appreciate Skeledirge's ability to beat Hatterene and, after Terastallizing, Dragapult. Covert Cloak Gholdengo can beat any Garganacl using Skeledirge as setup fodder. Bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Toxapex help deal with offensive Water-types like Greninja and Quaquaval. Additionally, they can both spread status, facilitating Skeledirge's Hex. Rotom-W in particular can offensively check Ground-types like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Ting-Lu too, although it cannot directly switch into them. Offensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Dragonite appreciate Skeledirge halting scary Pokemon, like Volcarona and Iron Valiant, and they help it overwhelm checks like Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire.</p> "

Substitute also allows Skeledirge to scout Choice item Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Dragonite, as well as protecting it from revenge killers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon more reliably. Substitute also lets Skeledirge set up against the likes of Garganacl and Cinderace, and it blocks from status from the likes of Toxapex, Clodsire, and Thunder Wave Rotom-W. Maximum HP investment means that Garganacl cannot break Substitute with Salt Cure. 40 Defense EVs let Skeledirge survive two Bulldozes from Focus Sash Breloom, meaning it can consistently outheal Bulldoze, barring a critical hit. 188 Special Defense EVs ensures it survives a Shadow Ball from non-Tera Ghost Choice Specs Dragapult, while 28 Speed EVs let it outspeed Kingambit. Tera Fairy helps stop the likes of Dragapult and Great Tusk from overwhelming Skeledirge, especially the former, which bypasses Substitute with Infiltrator but cannot 2HKO Skeledirge after it Terastallizes. Tera Fairy also prevents Garganacl's Earthquake from breaking Substitute.</p> <p>Substitute Skeledirge fits best on bulky offense and balance teams as a good check to Garganacl. Pokemon Garganacl can overwhelm such as Dragonite, Hex Dragapult, Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, Calm Mind Hatterene, Corviknight, Toxapex, and Dondozo can lure it in for Skeledirge to set up Substitute on and snowball. Additionally, the former can break through Pokemon that wall Skeledirge, namely Toxapex and Clodsire, and Dragapult and Corviknight also boast U-turn, letting them pivot into Skeledirge on a Garganacl switch-in. The setup sweepers enjoy Skeledirge's potent wallbreaking, too. Toxapex and Dondozo also check Pokemon that overwhelm Skeledirge, such as Dragapult and Greninja. Pokemon that do not mind Knock Off like Great Tusk and Corviknight greatly help this set, as Skeledirge is both weak to Knock Off and reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots due to its Stealth Rock weakness. These Pokemon also double as entry hazard removers, with the former preventing Gholdengo from entering safely and the latter checking Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Meowscarada can chip down Pokemon that wall Skeledirge like Ting-Lu and Clodsire. In return, Skeledirge can threaten common entry hazard answers like Hatterene and Corviknight, as well as spinblocking in a pinch.</p> "

Earth Power punishes Miraidon and Chi-Yu as they switch in while also letting it beat Garganacl and Tera Fire Koraidon. Alternatively, Hex complements Will-O-Wisp, doing heavy damage to neutral targets such as Toxapex and Pelipper. Fairy is Skeledirge's preferred Tera Type, granting it a valuable immunity to Koraidon's Outrage and allowing it to absorb otherwise supereffective attacks like Crunch from Chien-Pao and Earthquake or Headlong Rush from Great Tusk. Skeledirge fits best on balance teams that appreciate its ability to neuter Koraidon and can effectively handle the numerous Pokemon that can threaten Skeledirge, such as Great Tusk, Miraidon, and Iron Bundle. As a result, ideal teammates include revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Miraidon and Choice Band Chien-Pao and defensive staples like Corviknight, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu.</p> "

Paldean Tauros-F is also a good teammate, since it can threaten the aforementioned Dark-types with its Fighting STAB while also having Intimidate to help neutralize physical attackers that Skeledirge cannot handle on its own, such as Roaring Moon. Additionally, its Choice Scarf set can outspeed and KO Greninja. Torkoal pairs well with Skeledirge due to its ability to both remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and set them up, all while also powering up Skeledirge's Torch Song. Cinderace is a fairly good partner as well due to High Jump Kick, letting it remove Dark-types aiming to threaten Skeledirge, while also being able to remove entry hazards with Court Change and hit Poison-types such as Clodsire and Toxapex with Zen Headbutt.

Salt Cure wears down common switch-ins such as Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Rotom-W, and Hatterene, as well as passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Corviknight, and forces them to burn recovery PP more often. Recover keeps Garganacl healthy throughout a game to check Pokemon like Ceruledge and Iron Moth and makes it more sustainable as a wincon. Purifying Salt prevents it from being crippled by Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Clodsire. It also provides a handy Ghost resistance, letting Garganacl potentially switch in on predicted Ghost-type moves from Pokemon like Dragapult and Skeledirge. Leftovers provides valuable passive recovery, reducing Garganacl's reliance on Recover. Maximum Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature maximize Garganacl's bulk, making it easier for Garganacl to switch in on Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Dragapult and use them as setup fodder. Tera Water provides incredibly valuable resistances, letting Garganacl potentially check Gholdengo and Scizor while retaining its ability to pivot in on Fire-types like Cinderace. Tera Fairy allows Garganacl to turn the tables on Great Tusk while also preventing Breloom from revenge killing it. However, this does remove its resistance to Fire, making it more susceptible to Pokemon like Skeledirge and Ceruledge. Tera Ghost prevents Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk from reliably revenge killing Garganacl, letting it use them as setup fodder.

While Garganacl is given a Ghost resistance from Purifying Salt, it cannot fully check Dragapult and Gholdengo prior to Terastallization, with the latter completely countering it if it uses Covert Cloak. As such, Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire make for great teammates. Pokemon like Corviknight and Scizor appreciate Garganacl checking Fire-types like Ceruledge and Skeledirge. Corviknight is notable in that it also forms a strong defensive core with Garganacl, checking Meowscarada for it. Entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Corviknight are appreciated, as Garganacl is heavily pressured by entry hazards and cannot set up reliably if it is worn down. Frail, offensive Pokemon like Cinderace appreciate chip damage being forced onto their checks and having a strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on. Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Iron Valiant can pave the way for Garganacl to clean late-game, wearing down or significantly pressuring its checks in Gholdengo, Meowscarada, and Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk.</p> "

Protect also scouts out the intentions of Choice locked Pokemon such as Gholdengo and gives extra Leftovers recovery. Terastallization, lets Garganacl turn the tables on Great Tusk and Iron Treads lacking Iron Head, and makes it an incredibly consistent Stealth Rock setter. Specifically, Tera Fairy lets it completely wall Dragapult, while Tera Water lets it check Gholdengo, though this makes its matchup against opposing Garganacl much tougher. 116 Special Defense EVs let Garganacl take a Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Tera Dragon Dragapult at full health.</p> <p>Garganacl fits on a wide variety of teams from bulky offense to stall thanks to it setting up Stealth Rock easily and having fantastic longevity. Ting-Lu is a fantastic partner since it can lay Spikes, and check Gholdengo and unboosted Kingambit, and wear down Corviknight much faster with Ruination thanks to Garganacl running Stealth Rock. Meowscarada and Great Tusk provide Knock Off support by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak from Gholdengo and Toxapex to let Garganacl accrue Salt Cure damage more freely. Great Tusk also removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Gholdengo appreciates Great Tusk being worn down, since it shuts down other forms of entry hazard control well and fits alongside Garganacl and other entry hazard setters such as Garchomp. Cinderace lures in and uses U-turn on bulky Water-types such as Dondozo and Toxapex, giving Garganacl free entry to pressure them with Salt Cure</p> "

      "overview": "<p>With solid defenses and access to reliable recovery, Garganacl can perform well in a utility role or with setup in Iron Defense. Its biggest selling points are its unique move and ability: Salt Cure offers valuable passive damage, synergizing well with its natural bulk, while Purifying Salt provides a useful immunity to status moves such as Spore and Toxic. Garganacl is difficult to break for many Pokemon, but it matches up notably well into Fire-types such as Chi-Yu and Arcanine, Flying-types like Dragonite and Iron Jugulis, and Amoonguss due to Purifying Salt. As one of the best Wide Guard users, Garganacl can block the format's many powerful spread attacks such as Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Chi-Yu's Heat Wave, and Armarouge's Expanding Force. Iron Defense lets Garganacl play as a potent wincon instead, increasing its Defense whilst simultaneously strengthening its offensive presence through Body Press. These sets can be very difficult to take down, though they often rely on using up Terastallization to be most effective. Garganacl's abysmal Speed means it will usually be relegated to moving last. Rock typing also leaves Garganacl with countless weaknesses, including to Water-, Steel-, and Fighting-type moves, meaning common Pokemon such as Palafin, Gholdengo, Iron Bundle, Iron Hands, and Great Tusk all significantly threaten it. Amoonguss is one of the best partners for Garganacl, being helpful against several of the aforementioned threats, while Garganacl checks Fire-types like Chi-Yu in return, with redirection support and healing being especially critical for Iron Defense sets. Garganacl also appreciates teammates that can check Gholdengo, especially if not using Wide Guard, so Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Arcanine, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit are other desirable additions.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Other defensive Tera types are also usable depending on team needs. For example, Tera Poison still provides a Fighting-type resistance but doesn't gain the Dark-type weakness that Tera Ghost does. This means after Terastallization, Garganacl will still be good against Chi-Yu and gains immunity to Toxic Spikes, at the cost of not losing its Ground-type weakness. Tera Water is another alternative, offering helpful resists against Water-types like Palafin and Steel-types like Gholdengo.</p> ",

Dark Pulse can be used alongside Tera Dark to more heavily damage Ghost- and Psychic-types, though outside of opposing Armarouge, Life Orb Psychic can usually 2HKO them.</p> </li> </ul> "

By changing its typing to a more defense oriented one, while maintaining the Fire immunity thanks to Flash Fire, Ceruledge can set up Bulk Ups on a variety of common Pokemon, ranging from Corviknight, Kingambit, Azumarill and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt lets Ceruledge set up Bulk Up without needing to fear common phasing moves (with the exception of attacking moves such as Dragon Tail), as well as opposing setup moves such opposing Bulk Up and Iron Defense, provided you outspeed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Sneak</strong> Priority of some form is always nice to have on a Pokemon, which makes Shadow Sneak an easy contender for the last move. Gaining extra added strength against Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Dragapult and Annihilape is certainly charming.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass Tera Blast: This allows Ceruledge to eliminate Dondozo more quickly. While Taunt can shut down Dondozo's Yawn, it cannot shut down Fissure. The only way to beat Dondozo would be to eliminate it as quickly as possibly, which Grass Tera Blast aids with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flame Charge: Flame Charge provides Ceruledge an extra net of safety against potential Scarf users and Annihilape, who are capable of turning the tides against it. While normally, Ceruledge is prone to faster Taunt + Bulk Up users and Scarfed Trick, Flame Charge helps mitigate both of those weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Ceruledge can be a status spreader in games where it can't set up as easily. It also helps Ceruledge set up more easily against threats such as Unaware Clodsire.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: Tera Fairy helps Ceruledge's matchup against prominent Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass: An immunity to Spore and a resistance to Water makes Grass the most notable Tera type for this set. Flash Fire eliminating one of Grass's many weaknesses is also noteworthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Increasing Bitter Blade's power will always be a valuable trait. Eliminating Ghost's weaknesses to Ghost and Dark also allows Ceruledge to set up more comfortably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Tera Bug is similar to Tera Grass, but in exchange for losing the Water resistance and maintaining the Rock weakness of Fire / Ghost, Ceruledge can tank Volcarona's Bug Buzz with significantly more ease.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def with Impish: Investing into Defense prepares Ceruledge and its mediocre physical bulk for the physical-biased metagame. Bulk Up will boost its Defense, but it can struggle to take some physical hits even after a boost, and its special bulk is naturally high.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: A faster spread helps Ceruledge outspeed other Bulk Up users, like Annihilape opting to invest in bulk. Being faster, more often than not, lets Ceruledge win these matchups with ease.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: While most threats in the metagame at the moment are physical, a specially defensive spread is still noteworthy for its ability to surprise Hydreigon.</p> </li> </ul> "

If Ceruledge is brought down to 1 HP, a +2 Bitter Blade can heal it to the point that it can tank an extra attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Shadow Claw</strong>: Close Combat hits the Normal-, Dark-, and Rock-types that resist Ceruledge's STAB combination. Still, Shadow Claw is a noteworthy choice to guarantee the KO on Mimikyu and let Ceruledge pressure Skeledirge. Note, however, that maximum Defense Skeledirge can recover more than Shadow Claw's damage, barring critical hits, and a Terastallized Skeledirge can completely wall this set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance versus Destiny Bond: As powerful as Swords Dance boosted attacks from Ceruledge are, the abundance of Unaware Pokemon, primarily Dondozo, has made some players opt to use Destiny Bond to snag surprise kills. Destiny Bond can also make the matchup against KOing common Sucker Punch Pokemon, such as Meowscarada and Kingambit, easier to win without having to rely on predictions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly: Adamant's added damage output is valuable, but Jolly allows Ceruledge to outspeed non-Scarf Gholdengo, and gives it a chance at outspeeding Modest Rotom formes and Glimmora. All of the mentioned examples are Special Attackers, meaning Ceruledge's Weak Armor often does not trigger in these matchups.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire: Giving Bitter Blade an extra push in damage is quite useful, giving Ceruledge more recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Normal is an exceedingly common Tera Type on Ghost types due to the immunity it brings to the table. Ceruledge makes particularly excellent use of Normal Tera by resisting both Steel and Fairy, making it very difficult for Gholdengo and Mimikyu to click anything other than a Ghost type move when facing off against Ceruledge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Giving extra reach pwer to Close Combat, a powerful option against Pokemon such as Hydreigon, makes Fighting a solid choice for a Tera Type.</p> </li> </ul> "

Kilowattrel is extremely weak to common priority users like Chien-Pao making sturdy physical walls like Intimidate Garganacl great partners.

Toedscool spreads sleep and removes entry hazards, punishing Spore absorbers and spinblockers with Knock Off while using its good natural bulk and typing to serve as a check to Ground- and Electric-types. The given EV spread allows Toedscool to hit 17 Speed, which outspeeds common 16 Speed entry hazard setters like Glimmet and Pawniard. Toedscool can also opt for a Grass-type STAB move over Spore to give it more offensive presence. Power Whip provides a better matchup into opposing Toedscool, while Giga Drain gives it a form of recovery, a secondary STAB that cannot miss, and the ability to beat Mudbray. If running Power Whip, Toedscool should use an EV spread of 36 HP / 36 Atk / 156 Def / 36 SpA / 36 SpD / 196 Spe with a Jolly nature. Toedscool's Tera type occasionally allows it to avoid a super effective Ice-type move. Tera Water is preferred, as the added resistance to Water-type attacks also allows Toedscool to be an emergency check to rain teams and setup Quaxly sets. Tera Steel can also be used to deal with Tera Ice Electric-types more easily and to give it a favorable matchup against Foongus, but at the cost of adding unfortunate Ground and Fighting weaknesses. Toedscool pairs well with Pokemon that struggle with Stealth Rock chip, like Larvesta, Nymble, and Wattrel, and teammates that appreciate the momentum that Toedscool generates, like Magnemite, Mankey, and Hisuian Zorua. Water-types such as Mareanie and Quaxly have defensive synergy with Toedscool, both checking the Ice- and Fire-types that threaten Toedscool and benefitting from Toedscool's ability to absorb Electric-type moves.</p> "

Most notably, its ability to defeat most Pokemon, even powerful Dragon-types, without fearing surprise Terastallizations makes Scovillain a charming offensive option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Overheat and Fire Blast</strong>: Overheat combined with Tera Fire and Choice Specs guarantees the KO on Garchomp  without bulk EVs, and OHKO offensive Roaring Moon after Stealth Rock damage. Against the frailer Dragapult, Tera Fire and Fire Blast is enough to earn the KO. It's recommended to run both Fire STAB moves because Overheat's added damage can be necessary to guarantee certain KOs, but its stat drop can be fatal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Solar Beam versus Leaf Storm: Solar Beam nails the few bulky Water-types that can survive Scovillain's absurd attacks, most notable examples being notably Gastrodon and Assault Vest Azumarill. However, Leaf Storm can be used in its stead for the ability to OHKO Hippowdon, despite it summoning sand.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower: Flamethrower is perfectly accurateand is typically more than enough to nip off frailer foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: In spite of the type matchup, Scovillain is deceptively weak to Kingambit thanks to Sucker Punch. Additionally, many Pokemon will use Protect in front of Scovillain to waste sun turns— most notably Espathra and Dondozo. Against all of these foes, a well-timed Substitute can guarantee the win.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire: It is almost mandatory to run Tera Fire on this Scovillain set. Tera Fire guarantees KOs on most Dragon-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: The abundantly common Dragonite is incredibly strong against Scovillain. Should Stealth Rock support be deemed enough to let Scovillain sweep teams reasonably, even without Tera Fire, using Tera Ghost to gain an immunity to Extreme Speed can be very useful.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock: Tera Rock with Tera Blast can be a decent alternative to Tera Fire, as it gives Scovillain excellent coverage and also provides a much-needed countermeasure to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> </li> </ul> "

On top of that, Scovillain is held back by the powerful Dragon-types that resist its STAB combination. However, Scovillain still carves a niche for itself by being the only Moody Pokemon with excellent recovery moves, Leech Seed and Ingrain, allowing it to win a variety of matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect and Substitute</strong>: Protect and Substitute are mandatory to get the most opportunities to activate Moody. Once you gain enough Defense or Special Defense boosts that Scovillain's Substitute can tank an attack without breaking, it tends to be easy to win the game. Note, however, that Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers's animation make Scovillain very vulnerable to losing via timer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: With enough Moody boosts, Scovillain's Flamethrower tends to be enough to break through an entire team. There are very few Pokemon that are immune or quadruply resistant to Fire, and Flamethrower has good PP and accuracy, which makes it an easy pick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: Unlike Flamethrower, Giga Drain gets shrugged off by a lot of Pokemon, even at +6, notably Corviknight and Dragonite. However, an attacking move that helps recover HP lost from Substitutes helps it gain gives Scovillain more mileage off of Moody. Giga Drain is also notable to more reliably defeat Dondozo, one of the Unaware Pokemon that would give Scovillain a lot of trouble otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leech Seed: Leech Seed combined with Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers helps Scovillain restore HP while collecting Moody boosts, as well as chipping Pokemon it'd otherwise have trouble against, such as Clodsire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain: Ingrain is an alternative recovery option that makes Scovillain impervious to phazing moves. When purely considering recovery, it's more reliable than the inaccurate 90% accurate Leech Seed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast with Tera Fairy is an excellent option that helps remedy Scovillain's Dragon susceptibility, particularly making the Infiltrator Dragapult and Roaring Moon matchup easier.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Water: The Water resistance helps Scovillain beat Dondozo. Even though Dondozo ignores Scovillain's Defense boosts via Unaware, with Tera Water, Scovillain's Substitute can tank a Wave Crash. Tera Water also keeps the Scovillain's Steel resistance, unlike Tera Grass, which makes it easier to check Scizor—a common priority user that people attempt to use to check Moody Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: Tera Fairy mitigating Scovillain's weakness to Dragon-types is massively helpful.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>180 HP / 220 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 100 Spe with Bold</strong>: This spread bolsters Scovillain’s physical bulk. Notably, Tera Water Scovillain's Substitute manages to survive Dondozo's Wave Crash with this spread. The Speed allows Scovillain to outspeed slow Baxcalibur and Gholdengo, as well as Dragapult with one Moody Speed boost. The HP is adjusted to make maximum use of Leftovers, with the resulting stat having a remainder of 1 when divided by 16. The remaining EVs are split between Special Attack and Special Defense because, at level 50, investing 8 EVs in either stat has no benefit over investing 4.</li> </ul> "

Power Gem threatens the metagame's best Defogger in Tornadus-T, while Sludge Bomb dents screens setters such as Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko and—if Focus Sash is still intact—Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant as well, which can be problematic against offensive teams. Earth Power pressures Steel-types like Heatran, Gholdengo, and Kingambit that would otherwise block Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Energy Ball deals with other entry hazard setters and removers such as Great Tusk, Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Rotom-W. Focus Sash guarantees that Glimmora can set at least one layer of entry hazards, potentially letting Toxic Debris trigger twice as well. Tera Ghost is used in a pinch to spinblock foes such as Great Tusk, Cyclizar, and Excadrill and remove its Ground weakness to set up multiple entry hazards in the face of other setters like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gastrodon. Gholdengo is a near-mandatory teammate to keep up entry hazards by blocking every attempts to remove them, such as Defog and Rapid Spin. Setup sweepers like Kingambit, Volcarona, Dragapult, Annihilape, and Iron Valiant appreciate entry hazards wearing down foes such as Dondozo and Clodsire and not being chipped down by opposing ones themselves; particularly, Kingambit's Knock Off can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Volcarona to make them vulnerable to Glimmora's entry hazards.</p> "

Liquidation is Dondozo's STAB move of choice due to its lack of recoil, but Wave Crash's power has some merit against foes like Ting-Lu, Skeledirge, and Clodsire. While weaker, Waterfall is another option that has more PP than Liquidation, allowing Dondozo to perform better against stall; however, its use case is rare. Body Press makes use of Dondozo's massive Defense stat and punishes Pokemon like Tera Normal Dragonite and Kingambit. Rest + Sleep Talk provides Dondozo with good sustainability without making it too passive, while Yawn is an option that forces out sweepers Dondozo cannot consistently deal with, like mixed Iron Valiant. On Yawn sets, Leftovers over Heavy-Duty Boots can be beneficial, as Dondozo is vulnerable when it is asleep without Sleep Talk. Grass is the preferred Tera type for eliminating Dondozo's original weaknesses; this is particularly helpful against Meowscarada and Iron Hands. Dragon, however, is an option that keeps Dondozo's resistance to Fire intact, albeit making it weak to Fairy-types like Azumarill and Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Clodsire and Ting-Lu pair perfectly with Dondozo, playing into its desire to outlast foes long-term with chip damage in the form of entry hazards, status, or Ruination. Both also check special attackers like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo, which Dondozo tends to struggle with. Garganacl deserves a special mention as a teammate due to its ability to wear down foes with Salt Cure; it, in turn, appreciates Dondozo taking on Great Tusk and Kingambit. Hatterene provides Dondozo teams with an excellent sweeper and appreciates Dondozo taking care of physical wallbreakers like Dragapult, and Kingambit. It also can help by blocking opposing entry hazards with Magic Bounce, letting Dondozo more comfortably tank a Knock Off from Great Tusk or Iron Treads. Similarly, entry hazard removal from Corviknight or Great Tusk is also helpful; Corviknight also deals with Meowscarada, which can force Dondozo to Terastallize early.

Liquidation is preferred over Wave Crash due to its lack of recoil; however, Wave Crash is an option if a stronger STAB move is desired. Waterfall has higher PP than Liquidation, but it is usually a weaker option. Body Press makes use of Dondozo's naturally high Defense stat and Curse's boosts, while Protect lets Dondozo accumulate Leftovers recovery. However, these two moves can be dropped for the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk, which affords Dondozo greater longevity at the cost of relying on Sleep Talk to call the right move. Leftovers is preferred over Heavy-Duty Boots, as Dondozo will be on the field for many turns in a row to adequately set up with Curse; however, if a team requires it to play more defensively, Heavy-Duty Boots is fine choice. Grass is Dondozo's Tera type of choice, removing its original weaknesses while giving it an important resistance to Ground. Maximum investment in special bulk allows Dondozo to become nigh-unbreakable once it sets up.</p> <p>Entry hazard removal is key for Dondozo if it does not run Heavy-Duty Boots; good options include Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Corviknight. Though Dondozo can have quite the offensive presence once it sets up, it is best to run it alongside consistent wallbreakers like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Iron Valiant, which can help break open holes for it to sweep late-game. Similarly, entry hazards from teammates like Garchomp and Glimmora can facilitate Dondozo's sweep. Trick users like Meowscarada and Gholdengo can cripple Dondozo checks like Clodsire and Skeledirge, causing them to lose to Dondozo over the course of the game. While Dondozo is a great sweeper, it is far from consistent at generating setup opportunities; accordingly, it is best to pair it with another bulky sweeper like Iron Defense Garganacl or Hatterene, which can weaken or bait out answers to bulky sweepers like Trick users and Unaware Clodsire.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Annihilape's amazing bulk and the fantastic Rage Fist make it an amazing late-game wincon and wallbreaker. Bulk Up makes it harder for foes such as Great Tusk and Dragonite to break through it, as well as allowing it to break through defensive Pokemon like Buzzwole and Mega Scizor. Taunt prevents status, recovery, and set up from Pokemon like Skeledirge, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T while also forcing foes to damage Annihilape, boosting the power of Rage Fist. Rage Fist lacks no switch-in once boosted up and allows Annihilape to demolish Pokemon that wouldn't mind it unboosted, such as Gholdengo and Mega Scizor. It also notably invalidates Unaware, enabling it to break through Pokemon like Clodsire and Skeledirge. Drain Punch provides Annihilape with some additional recovery, preventing it from being worn down quickly. Rest combined with Chesto Berry can be used over Taunt, as it provides Annihilape with a one-time way to recover HP and status, as well as being the premier way to heal from strong incoming hits, but it can be easily exploited if the foe is able to chip down Annihilape enough. Tera Water is the premier option, as it boosts Annihilape's defensive profile, giving it resists to moves like Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Fairy is another option that gives Annihilape nice resistances to moves like Mega Lopunny's Close Combat and an immunity to Draco Meteor or Dragon Darts from Dragapult. Tera Fire gives Annihilape an immunity to Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon like Skeledirge and Rotom-W while giving it a Fairy resistance as well, preventing the likes of Mega Diancie and Iron Valiant from revenge killing it. Notably, all of these types give Annihilape a Flying- and Ghost-type neutrality, preventing Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Dragapult, and Gholdengo from revenge killing it as easily. 28 Speed EVs help Annihilape outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W. The other EVs maximize its special bulk, letting it take hits comfortably from Pokemon like Heatran and Volcarona. Dual screens setters like Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl let Annihilape tank hits more easily. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Ferrothorn, and Heatran to wear down Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele is appreciated. Allies like Heatran and Tyranitar handle Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Tornadus-T, with Annihilape cleaning up once the aformentioned threats are removed.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Annihilape carves a niche in being a Stealth Rock user that is immune to Rapid Spin from foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Annihilape being a Defog deterrent due to Defiant, as well as its bulk and Final Gambit picking up easy KOs also strengthens this niche. Final Gambit lets Annihilape safely bring in a teammate while dealing massive damage due to its large HP stat. Taunt denies other entry hazards from being set up by Pokemon like Ting-Lu and preventing the use of Defog from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Tornadus-T on the switch. Defog can also activate Defiant, giving Annihilape way more offensive output for Rage Fist and making it easier to pick up a KO. Annihilape won't be Terastallizing often, but Tera Ghost can be used to boost the power of Rage Fist in scenarios where it is boosted, and it gives Annihilape neutralities to moves like Mega Diancie's Moonblast and Tornadus-T's Hurricane or Bleakwind Storm. Annihilape fits on hyper offense exclusively, so Pokemon that benefit from entry hazards being simultaneously denied and set up, such as Iron Valiant and Dragonite, are good partners. Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Mega Diancie are very big problems for Annihilape, so partners like Gholdengo and Mega Scizor are very valuable. Final Gambit removing Pokemon like Great Tusk and Tornadus-T can also be a big help to teammates like Kingambit and Dragonite.</p> "

Iron Treads clears entry hazards and threatens Hatterene, and Ting-Lu sets up entry hazards and switches into Psychic-type attacks from Espathra and Indeedee.

Skuntank is a Psychic-immune teammate that switches into Hatterene, Espathra, and Indeedee, and it can set Toxic Spikes better against types like Fairy and Psychic by trapping switch-ins such as Klefki and Bronzong with Fire Spin. Glimmora provides entry hazard support and removal with Stealth Rock and Mortal Spin, respectively, and it can run Air Balloon or Choice Scarf to handle Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads due to its great coverage.

Life Orb provides the highest damage boost to Kingambit's attacks; alternatively, Black Glasses provides a damage boost without digging into Kingambit's limited healthpool, while Leftovers allows Kingambit to reliably switch in on weaker attacks. Kingambit best fits on offense teams, which appreciate its massive damage output and can provide opportunities for it to switch in safely. Slow pivoting teammates, such as RegenVest Iron Treads and Corviknight, are recommended, as they can safely pivot Kingambit in and also clear entry hazards. 144 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Corviknight, who may carry Body Press which threatens Kingambit.</p> "

Tera Dark lets Kingambit strengthen its wallbreaking capabilities against bulkier teams. Tera Flying instead lets it play around potential revenge killers, putting them in checkmate situations by turning its Fighting and Ground weaknesses into resistances. 140 Speed EVs let Kingambit outspeed Skeledirge.

Kingambit is susceptible to faster Fighting-type Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Mega Lopunny, and Urshifu-R, as they will not succumb to a boosted Sucker Punch. Thus, wallbreakers like Dragapult, Dragonite, and Iron Valiant that punish foes for using Fighting-type moves help form solid offensive cores; they can also pressure bulky Steel-types that check Kingambit, such as Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Heatran.

Knock Off allows Kingambit to function as a decent wallbreaker while crippling switch-ins like Ting-Lu and Ferrothorn. Sucker Punch makes up for Kingambit's poor Speed tier, letting it revenge kill faster threats such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y, and it can potentially clean late-game if it acquires multiple Supreme Overlord boosts. Tera Dark boosts Kingambit's damage output, letting it threaten post-Tera Dragapult and Gholdengo and clean late-game with Sucker Punch. Defiant is an option to punish Defog attempts from Tornadus-T and Gliscor and punish Intimidate from Landorus-T, letting it wallbreak better, but it is less consistent. Black Glasses boosts Kingambit's already threatening STAB Dark-type moves, allowing it to break more easily, while Leftovers gives Kingambit passive recovery, patching up its lack of longevity. The given EV spread allows Kingambit to outspeed Skeledirge to Knock Off, with the rest in bulk in order to take hits from Dragapult and Gholdengo better. Due to its trapping capabilities, partners that appreciate Ghost- and Psychic-types gone such as Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult work really well with it. While its bulk is great, its lack of longevity leaves it easily worn down in the long-term, so having a solid defensive core utilizing Pokemon such as Toxapex, Slowking-G, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W to help it check threats is key. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Mega Diancie, and Garchomp have great synergy with Kingambit, as it removes items from common defensive Pokemon, wearing them down quickly by the entry hazards set. Defiant sets in particular work extremely well, as they are able to punish Defog attempts, threatening to turn Kingambit into a dangerous wallbreaker.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Great Tusk is the best offensive Rapid Spin user and a fantastic wallbreaker thanks to its typing, bulk, and high-Base Power STAB attacks. Great Tusk takes on a plethora of physical attackers in the tier, including Kingambit, Garchomp, and Scizor while also threatening entry hazard setters such as Glimmora, Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl. Knock Off prevents Air Balloon Gholdengo from completely spinblocking Great Tusk, and it also removes items such as Rocky Helmet, Leftovers, and Heavy-Duty Boots from defensive Pokemon that commonly switch into Great Tusk such as Dondozo, Corviknight, and Hatterene. Ice Spinner lets Great Tusk take on Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Garchomp more easily, though the lack of Close Combat leaves Great Tusk walled by Corviknight and Rotom-W. Maximum Speed investment paired with a Jolly nature ensures that Great Tusk is able to outspeed Rotom-W, non-Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and Jolly Dragonite. Tera Fighting makes Great Tusk much better at taking on Water-types such as Quaquaval while making Close Combat significantly harder to switch into; alternatively, Tera Steel lets Great Tusk flip its type weaknesses and take on Pokemon like Iron Valiant, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Great Tusk from being worn down by Toxic Spikes and Spikes, letting it remove entry hazards consistently throughout a match; however, Leftovers provides Great Tusk with a form of recovery. Booster Energy is a niche option that provides Great Tusk with a one-time boost to its Attack, making it an immediately threatening wallbreaker without the use of Terastallization.</p> <p>Great Tusk takes on Dark-type Pokemon such as Kingambit, and Ting-Lu, so Pokemon weak to Dark such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, Slowking, and Skeledirge appreciate Great Tusk; Slowking and Dragapult in particular are able to pivot in Great Tusk with Chilly Reception and U-turn, respectively. Great Tusk is also able to take on entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Garchomp and remove entry hazards from the field, so Pokemon that can be overwhelmed by hazards such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl appreciate Great Tusk's presence. Great Tusk struggles to take on faster special attackers such as Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Volcarona, so special walls such as Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Toxapex are great partners. Great Tusk also has difficulty with physical walls such as Dondozo, Tera Water and Tera Fairy Garganacl, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge. Spikes support from Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Garchomp wears down these checks into range of Great Tusk's attacks, especially when paired with Knock Off. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, Iron Hands, and Breloom make for good partners by being able to overwhelm shared checks; Gholdengo is a noteworthy wallbreaker for also blocking opposing hazard removal. Torkoal is also an excellent partner for Great Tusk, setting up the sun to activate Protosynthesis and weaken Water-type attacks, while supporting other wallbreakers that can pressure the aforementioned physical walls, such as Choice Band Roaring Moon, Scovillain, and Slither Wing.</p> "

It can adequately check Pokemon like Kingambit, Cinderace, and Iron Hands, threatening them with a strong Earthquake in return. Stealth Rock lets Great Tusk compress even more roles, chipping away at the opposition. If another Stealth Rock user is already on the team, however, Body Press can take advantage of its high Defense stat and better threaten the likes of Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon. Body Press also lets Great Tusk catch Rotom-W with greater chip damage than Knock Off does on the switch. Knock Off provides valuable item removal, getting rid of Leftovers from Pokemon like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Volcarona and Dragonite. Additionally, Knock Off is Great Tusk's only initial way to hit Air Balloon Gholdengo, which can't OHKO this defensive set. Rapid Spin, besides clearing entry hazards, also allows Great Tusk to outspeed faster foes like Focus Sash Glimmora and Gholdengo. Tera Fighting gets rid of Great Tusk's Ground typing, giving it a better matchup against Pokemon like Quaquaval and Floatzel while also strengthening Body Press if it is used. Alternatively, Tera Steel can give Great Tusk valuable resistances to Fairy, and Grass, turning the tables on Hatterene and Meowscarada. Leftovers greatly increases Great Tusk's longevity; however, Rocky Helmet can be used to wear down Pokemon like Scizor and Cinderace over time.</p> <p>After Great Tusk sets Stealth Rock, Corviknight effortlessly switches in and uses Defog to remove entry hazards, so Pokemon like Cinderace, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W that handle it are great partners. With no good way to hit Flying-types and Pokemon that use Tera Flying, Great Tusk can be set up on very quickly, most notably against the likes of Dragonite and Roaring Moon;even though the former dislikes Knock Off. Therefore, checks to these such as Dondozo and Corviknight are appreciated. A different Stealth Rock setter like Garganacl or Ting-Lu lets Great Tusk comfortably run Body Press without losing out on anything major. Ting-Lu also forms a potent entry hazard-stacking core with Great Tusk via Spikes. Further, it takes on the special attackers that Great Tusk struggles with, like Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Volcarona. Great Tusk is forced out by wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Quaquaval, so teammates that can check them like Amoonguss and Toxapex are welcome. Pokemon like Ceruledge, and Iron Moth appreciate the entry hazard removal that Great Tusk provides. Great Tusk's defensive qualities greatly help frail wallbreakers like Dragapult, and Iron Valiant, as these Pokemon need strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on very often.</p> "

          "description": "<p>The combination of high Attack, powerful STAB moves, a decent movepool, and well-rounded physical bulk allows Great Tusk to function as a strong physical wallbreaker. It can support teams offensively with Knock Off and Rapid Spin as well as defensively through its ability to check Kingambit, Cinderace, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Its dual STAB moves are able to OHKO or severely damage several key offensive Pokemon in the metagame such as Kingambit, and Tera Normal Dragonite. Knock Off allows Great Tusk to remove Leftovers from walls such as Corviknight and Dondozo. It can also remove important items from more offensive Pokemon, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite, Volcarona, and bulky pivot Roaring Moon, and it can provide coverage against Air Balloon Gholdengo, which otherwise checks this set. Ice Spinner hits Dragon-types that Headlong Rush isn't as strong against like bulky Garchomp and Dragonite. Alternatively, Rapid Spin can be run if the team is still in need of entry hazard removal. With Tera Fighting, Close Combat becomes much stronger, guaranteeing OHKOs against offensive Scizor sets. Tera Fighting also improves Great Tusk's matchups against Dondozo, Rotom-W, and opposing Great Tusk. With Tera Steel, Great Tusk can better handle Grass- and Fairy-types such as Meowscarada and Hatterene, and it can also shrug off attacks it normally can't, such as Meowscarada's Flower Trick and Dragapult's Draco Meteor. When running Great Tusk on sun teams, an alternate EV spread making Speed its highest stat can be considered due to Protosynthesis boosting Speed; this allows Great Tusk to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon like Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p> <p>Rotom-W, Skeledirge, and Torkoal make for good teammates, since their status spreading can help weaken foes and help Great Tusk wallbreak more efficiently. Rotom-W is able to paralyze faster Pokemon such as Iron Valiant and boosted Quaquaval, allowing Great Tusk to outspeed them. Skeledirge is able to spread burn, capitalize on foes afflicted with status with a boosted Hex, and check Iron Valiant sets lacking Shadow Ball. Lastly, Torkoal is able to force switches thanks to Yawn, spread status with Lava Plume, and set up sun to make Great Tusk an even scarier wallbreaker. Great Tusk appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Garganacl and Ting-Lu, since it can wallbreak more easily thanks to the chip damage they provide. Great Tusk is able to keep their hazards up in exchange while simultaneously removing hazards set by foes. Sweepers that are vulnerable to hazards like Iron Moth and Tera Flying Roaring Moon appreciate Great Tusk being able to remove hazards and beat walls such as Ting-Lu, allowing them to sweep more easily late-game. Lastly, other offensive Pokemon such as Kingambit and Dragonite make for good partners, since Great Tusk is able to weaken or cripple their common checks in Iron Valiant.</p> "

Rapid Spin lets Great Tusk provide entry hazard removal for the team in games where it would not be able to win with Bulk Up, while allowing it to boost its Speed in games where it can sweep with Bulk Up. Body Press is another option that gives Great Tusk a way to more immediately hit Dark-types such as Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Ting-Lu. Tera Water turns Great Tusk's Water and Ice weaknesses into resistances, allowing it to better take hits from Azumarill, Quaquaval, and Floatzel. On the other hand, Tera Steel lets Great Tusk take on Grass-type attacks such as Breloom's Bullet Seed and Meowscarada's Flower Trick, Flying-type attacks like Roaring Moon's Acrobatics, and if need be, Fairy-type attacks such as Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Bulk Up Great Tusk appreciates specially defensive teammates like Toxapex and Garganacl that can help play around fast special attackers such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult. In return, Garganacl and Toxapex appreciate the presence of a Terastallized Great Tusk as they can get overwhelmed by Kingambit and Belly Drum Azumarill. Teammates such as Gholdengo, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult can help break through physically defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Skeledirge that Bulk Up Great Tusk can struggle against. Gholdengo in particular is a great partner, as it can struggle against Cinderace and Dragonite, both of which Great Tusk covers.</p> "

Knock Off makes progress on Corviknight and covers the Air Balloon Gholdengo matchup.</li> <li>Tera Ground lets Great Tusk deal incredible damage with Headlong Rush while also letting it survive Flutter Mane's Moonblast from full HP. Tera Steel flips the Fairy matchup and lets Great Tusk take on Ice- and Dragon-type attacks, but the additional weaknesses to Fighting and Ground make Great Tusk unable to take on Koraidon, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads easily.</li> <li>Great Tusk can be used to take on entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Iron Treads one-on-one by forcing them out and removing hazards. Jolly is usually preferred to outspeed Gholdengo, Modest Chi-Yu, and Glimmora, but Adamant lets Tera Ground Headlong Rush OHKO Koraidon and specially defensive Annihilape after one layer of Spikes or Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Great Tusk should be used aggressively to force out and keep entry hazards off the field against other setters, such as Ting-Lu and Iron Treads, since Great Tusk is generally difficult to switch into. Great Tusk pairs well with Koraidon thanks to Orichalcum Pulse's sun, letting Great Tusk become an incredibly potent wallbreaker, and Great Tusk can clear entry hazards so that Koraidon can repeatedly come in. Miraidon also appreciates Great Tusk, as it forces out common checks such as Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads. Great Tusk also appreciates Blissey being able to take on all of the special attackers that force Great Tusk out, such as Flutter Mane, Miraidon, and Iron Bundle.</li> </ul> "

It can comfortably set up on common physical walls like Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, Corviknight, and defensive Great Tusk.</li> <li>The STAB combination of Headlong Rush and Close Combat hits most physical walls for at least neutral damage. Earthquake may be used as the Ground-type STAB move to avoid defensive drops, but it is a weaker move, and it can't secure important OHKOs and 2HKOs at +1 Attack against some physical walls such as Toxapex, Scream Tail, and Alomomola.</li> <li>A Jolly nature is used to outspeed all viable unboosted Pokemon after one Rapid Spin. An Adamant nature makes Great Tusk stronger while still letting it outspeed unboosted Iron Bundle at +1 Speed, but it misses out on outspeeding maximum Speed Gholdengo and tying Jolly Great Tusk.</li> <li>Terastallizing into the Ground typing boosts Headlong Rush and guarantees some additional OHKOs and 2HKOs on foes like Toxapex and Scream Tail. Additionally, getting rid of the Fighting typing lets Great Tusk survive Fairy-type attacks such as Dazzling Gleam from Miraidon and Moonblast from Flutter Mane without Life Orb or Choice Specs, and it facilitates taking Dazzling Gleam and Play Rough from Scream Tail and Alomomola.</li> <li>Alternatively, using Tera Steel gives Great Tusk resistances to Fairy-type attacks, Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle, and Draco Meteor from Miraidon, allowing it to surprise them with a strong attack.</li> <li>Koraidon is a solid partner because its sun activates Great Tusk's Protosynthesis, making its attacks even stronger. In return, Great Tusk can break through or strongly dent common Koraidon checks like Scream Tail, Alomomola, and Skeledirge, which allows Koraidon to clean more easily. Miraidon is also an excellent teammate, since Great Tusk can easily hard switch into its common checks and either threaten them with its attacks or set up on them.</li> <li>Special attackers like Miraidon, Flutter Mane, and Iron Bundle hugely threaten Great Tusk, so it is recommended to pair it with appropriate special walls like Blissey, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Clodsire.

Knock Off can be used to take on Air Balloon Gholdengo and wear down foes that want to switch into Great Tusk such as Corviknight and Annihilape, but it is generally outclassed by the sheer utility of Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock. The combination of Knock Off and Body Press can be used to pressure Corviknight switch-ins.

However, be wary of Terastallizing against Koraidon that can still Terastallize themselves, as Choice Band Tera Fire Koraidon can take on Great Tusk one-on-one.

Great Tusk can utilize Rocky Helmet to punish the use of U-turn, though this hurts its longevity, as it then loses Leftovers's passive recovery.</li> <li>Great Tusk pairs well with defensive Scream Tail and Blissey, both of which can take on Iron Bundle while also providing Wish support for Great Tusk. Blissey can also take on Chi-Yu and Miraidon, while Scream Tail can take on Iron Valiant.</li> <li>Great Tusk also pairs well with Gholdengo, as it appreciates Great Tusk forcing out Koraidon while preventing hazard removal in exchange. Choice Scarf Chi-Yu is a good partner due to its ability to pressure faster special attackers that trouble Great Tusk such as Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane. Great Tusk also pairs well with Miraidon, as non-Heavy-Duty Boots Miraidon appreciates it removing entry hazards and taking on Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu.

Mystical Fire hits Steel-types such as Klefki and Iron Treads. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to punish specially defensive switch-ins like Dragalge, Blissey, and Clodsire. Flutter Mane can run Power Gem to pressure Fire teams, OHKOing foes like Volcarona and Torkoal, and it also benefits from Protosynthesis allowing it to outspeed Scovillain under the sun. Additionally, Flutter Mane usually goes with either Thunderbolt or Energy Ball. Both are useful against Water teams, with the former helping against Toxapex and Pelipper while the latter deals with Gastrodon and Quagsire. Choice Specs further enhances Flutter Mane's wallbreaking power, allowing it to overwhelm foes such as Ting-Lu after some chip damage.</p> <p>On Fairy teams, Flutter Mane is a menacing wallbreaker that excels at taking down slower foes such as Hydreigon, Skeledirge, and Corviknight. When paired with Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane forms an offensive core that's able to alternate between Fairy-, Ghost-, and Fighting-type STAB to take down a wide range of enemies. Flutter Mane can handle Psychic-type foes such as Espathra and Hatterene, while Iron Valiant takes care of Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Flutter Mane can fall back on either Hatterene or Tinkaton when faced with an unfavorable matchup. Both of these Pokemon provide dependable defensive options and some type of entry hazard control, but Hatterene is particularly useful due to it breaking down walls like Dondozo and Clodsire. Flutter Mane also pairs well with setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Mimikyu, as it is able to poke holes in the opponent's team, allowing them to clean late-game. In return, Azumarill can take care of priority users, such as Ceruledge and Chien-Pao. In terms of support options, Flutter Mane can rely on Fairy's Prankster users, Klefki and Grimmsnarl, to set up dual screens, therefore allowing it to withstand hits such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Grimmsnarl can then bring in Flutter Mane relatively safely thanks to Parting Shot. Klefki's Spikes and Tinkaton's Stealth Rocks also support Flutter Mane in breaking its checks such as Iron Hands and Ting Lu. Entry hazard stacking proves particularly useful against less bulky teams, as it highly limits their capacity to scout Flutter Mane without having to sacrifice a member in the process.</p> "

Notably, it outspeeds faster Pokemon like Dragapult, boosted threats such as Baxcalibur and Quaquaval, and Choice Scarf users like Greninja and Meowscarada, all of which can threaten the offensive teams that Flutter Mane is part of. Mystical Fire threatens Steel-types such as Corviknight and Iron Treads, while Psyshock revenge kills Choice Scarf Iron Moth and hits specially bulky Pokemon like Clodsire. Thunderbolt pressures Corviknight better and 2HKOes physically defensive Toxapex after Stealth Rock, while Energy Ball takes care of Gastrodon.</p> <p>Spikes from the likes of Brambleghast and Froslass are terrific support options, chipping down bulky foes like Toxapex and Ting-Lu that would otherwise switch into Flutter Mane freely. Thanks to Good as Gold blocking Defog and its Ghost-typing, Gholdengo is a notable partner to keep Spikes up. Brambleghast also helps threaten Gastrodon and provides Rapid Spin support as well. Wallbreakers like Mimikyu and Gholdengo can pressure the opposition early-game, allowing for Flutter Mane to clean up late-game with ease; moreover, Mimikyu can overwhelm Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads with Drain Punch, while Gholdengo can make use of Trick to cripple walls like Clodsire and Corviknight. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Swords Dance Ceruledge are valuable teammates that function as back-up late-game cleaners, especially against types Flutter Mane can struggle with such as Poison and Steel. Moreover, Ceruledge and Mimikyu have the added benefit of safely revenge killing opposing fast threats Flutter Mane can't handle easily, like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Dragon Dance Dragapult, with Shadow Sneak. Skeledirge is a notable partner to compensate for Flutter Mane's lack of physical bulk, taking on Bullet Punch users like Scizor and Lucario as well as being fantastic in the Steel, Fighting, and Bug matchups.</p> "

It fits best on Trick Room teams that benefit from its low Speed but also has enough bulk to compensate for its slowness and perform adequately on any team that appreciates the safe turns that Fake Out can provide. Iron Hands most commonly holds an Assault Vest to patch up its lower Special Defense stat and comfortably endure and trade attacks with its enemies. Another popular set foregoes Assault Vest to enable the use of Swords Dance, turning Iron Hands into a fearsome setup sweeper. With either set, Iron Hands is a reliable and well-rounded Pokemon that matches up decently into much of the metagame, although it does need to be wary of a few commonly encountered threats. Amoonguss, the tier's most common and bulkiest redirector, walls both of Iron Hands's STAB attacks and can survive two of its Ice Punches. Despite Iron Hands's massive bulk, a few especially hard-hitting Pokemon like Great Tusk and Armarouge have the offensive capability to break through it with ease. Finally, Iron Hands needs to be wary of priority blockers like Farigiraf, Indeedee-F, and Tsareena when using Fake Out.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Iron Hands can be made even bulkier by shifting some or all of its Attack EVs into HP and Defense. Moving 64 EVs into HP allows the Assault Vest Iron Hands set to survive two boosted Shadow Balls from Modest Nasty Plot Gholdengo, as well as one Overheat from a Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu. In addition to the 64 HP EVs, an additional 48 EVs can be moved into Defense to allow Iron Hands to survive two Extreme Speeds or Dragon Claws from Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite, as well as one Headlong Rush from Adamant Great Tusk. Iron Hands can also invest 124 EVs in Speed to outspeed Garchomp under Tailwind but should retain at least 100 Attack EVs and an Adamant Nature when doing so to ensure Ice Punch OHKOes Garchomp. Tera Fire can be used to prevent burns from Will-O-Wisp users like Arcanine while also providing a STAB boost to Fire Punch. Heavy Slam can be run as a coverage move if Fairy-types such as Sylveon are a concern. Finally, Belly Drum can be used in place of Swords Dance as a higher-risk, higher-reward Attack-boosting move, but losing 50% HP in the process is a high price to pay for a Pokemon that prides itself on its bulk and longevity. When using Belly Drum in combination with a Sitrus Berry, ensure that Iron Hands's HP stat is an even number so that Sitrus Berry activates after the 50% HP drop.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Iron Hands is a potent wincon, using its amazing bulk in conjunction with its perfect coverage to punch holes in faster teams that lack the means to consistently wall it and trade extremely well. Wild Charge and Close Combat are higher power options over Thunder Punch and Drain Punch that allow for a few notable benchmarks, such as having a chance to 2HKO Tera Water Skeledirge and OHKOing defensive Rotom-W after Stealth Rock and a Swords Dance, but they both greatly sacrifice longevity. Ice Punch lets it nail Ground-, Flying- and Dragon-types that resist its STAB combination such as Landorus-T, Dragonite, Zapdos, and Great Tusk. Tera Water lets Iron Hands gain a much stronger defensive type overall, preventing Ground-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types from revenge killing it while improving the rain matchup significantly. The given EV spread allows Iron Hands to KO Tapu Lele with Thunder Punch after a Swords Dance and outspeed Chansey, with the rest dumped into Special Defense to maximize its lower special bulk. Entry hazard support from Garchomp, Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, and Mega Diancie is crucial to Iron Hands, as it quickly wears down all of its checks for it to clean late-game. Future Sight support is also notable, as it allows Iron Hands to bypass would-be checks such as Buzzwole and Skeledirge. Pivots such as Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T also work well with Iron Hands, as they bring it in safely and prevent it from being worn down quickly. Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain also activates Iron Hands's Quark Drive, boosting its Attack even further. Due to its great defensive utility, it partners well with Pokemon like Slowbro and Dragapult, as it takes advantage of Dark-types that pressure these two out, with Slowbro providing Future Sight support and Dragapult taking advantage of Iron Hands’s checks like Buzzwole and Skeledirge. Due to its lack of longevity, it is a poor singular check to threats such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Kartana, so pairing it up with Pokemon like tank Garchomp, Tapu Fini, and Rotom-W to form defensive a defensive core works wonders.</p> "

With Booster Energy and the listed EV spread, Iron Moth receives a one-time Speed boost to outspeed and threaten normally-faster foes such as Dragapult, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and Roaring Moon. Furthermore, Fiery Dance can further boost its offense with Special Attack boosts. Energy Ball allows it to take on Water- and Ground-types such as Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Great Tusk. Dazzling Gleam gives Iron Moth an answer to Dragon-types such as Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Baxcalibur. Finally, Psychic threatens Poison-types such as opposing Iron Moth and Toxapex, as well as Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant. With Tera Fairy, Iron Moth receives a boost to Dazzling Gleam, and it also loses its crippling weaknesses to Ground, Psychic, and Stealth Rock. Tera Fairy also gives Iron Moth a valuable resistance to Sucker Punch, meaning it no longer fears Kingambit revenge killing it mid-sweep. An alternative EV spread of maximum Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature is a viable alternative, since Iron Moth will receive a boost to its Special Attack from Booster Energy.</p> <p>Iron Moth serves best on various hyper offense teams, where it can sweep efficiently. When pairing Iron Moth with other offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Baxcalibur, and Dragapult, some can punch holes early- and mid-game for others to sweep more easily late-game. Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and mixed offensive Garchomp provide hyper offense teams with entry hazards, which wear foes down into Iron Moth's KO range. Kingambit, Dragonite, and Choice Band Scizor can revenge kill boosted sweepers that Iron Moth can struggle with. Kingambit revenge kills Dragapult and Tera Flying Roaring Moon, Dragonite covers Volcarona and offensive Iron Moth, and Choice Band Scizor covers Iron Valiant and Dragonite. Iron Moth is very vulnerable to hazards, so it appreciates hazard removal from the likes of offensive Great Tusk and Booster Energy Iron Treads.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gholdengo utilizes its high Special Attack and its great offensive typing to become a fast revenge killer. Gholdengo can effectively hit offensive threats such as Dragapult and Iron Valiant with its STAB moves. Trick allows Gholdengo to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Dodonzo, Corviknight, and Clodsire. Its typing also allows it to switch into foes such as Iron Valiant and Iron Hands in a pinch, as it either resists or is immune to most of their attacks. Focus Blast is ideal for Gholdengo to hit Kingambit and other foes such as a weakened Ting-Lu, but Nasty Plot can be run instead to take advantage of stopping defensive Pokemon with Trick and having a free turn to set up and do a great amount of damage. Recover can also be run, taking a more defensive approach to give Gholdengo a free turn to heal. Gholdengo prefers Fighting as a Tera type, as it removes its prior weaknesses, meaning it is not threatened by Kingambit's Sucker Punch or Skeledirge's Torch Song. It also boosts the power of Focus Blast, reliably removing the former. To counter different foes, Gholdengo can instead opt for Tera Flying to have better ground against Great Tusk and Iron Treads.</p> <p>Teammates such as Kingambit and Iron Valiant appreciate Gholdengo's offensive pressure, as it can help against shared checks such as Great Tusk and Amoonguss. With this role, Gholdengo prefers to have a clean switch after a teammate has fainted in order to pressure the opponent. Similarly, entry hazard setters such as Garchomp, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu appreciate Gholdengo for its Good as Gold ability and its Ghost typing, preventing all forms of hazard removal excluding Court Change. Gholdengo is mainly vulnerable to priority moves such as Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Dragonite also presents an issue for it with Multiscale in conjunction with Earthquake, not to mention it can set up twice in front of Gholdengo. This can be avoided with a carefully timed Trick or help from defensive Great Tusk and Skeledirge. Similarly, depending on its Choice lock, Roaring Moon and Cinderace can take advantage of Gholdengo with Crunch and Sucker Punch, respectively. As a result of this, Garchomp and Garganacl pair well with Gholdengo, acting as a defensive backbone with type advantage and great bulk. Iron Valiant can be a great revenge killer against these threats with great Speed and coverage.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its great typing and Good as Gold, Gholdengo is a setup sweeper that's notably difficult to deal with. Having an additional Ground immunity with Air Balloon further improves Gholdengo's already great typing, letting it switch in on Pokemon that otherwise threaten it, such as Garchomp and Iron Treads. This is especially useful against the latter, as Air Balloon strengthens Gholdengo's ability to block entry hazard removal. Maximum Speed investment is for outspeeding Dragonite and uninvested Great Tusk. 252 Special Attack EVs and Nasty Plot makes Gholdengo's STAB moves very threatening against neutral foes. Fighting and Dark Tera types give Gholdengo the option to Terastallize defensively; notably, Tera Fighting lessens the impact of moves like Crunch from Roaring Moon. Tera Dark is useful in a pinch to resist attacks such as Shadow Ball from Dragapult and opposing Gholdengo.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Glimmora are the most profitable teammates for Gholdengo, as its ability and typing ensure that their entry hazards stay around as long as Gholdengo does. Hyper offense staples such as Iron Valiant benefit greatly from the constant presence of entry hazards to break down bulkier cores; in return, Gholdengo gets teammates that synergize with its role as a wallbreaker, applying heavy pressure throughout a game to Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Rotom-W. Offensive Pokemon that outspeed and OHKO Gholdengo, such as Cinderace, Roaring Moon, and Knock Off variants of Great Tusk, threaten to completely shut down Gholdengo; defensive teammates like Garganacl, Dondozo and Skeledirge can help mitigate some of these weaknesses.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Gholdengo can utilize its natural bulk, great typing, and immunity to status moves for a more defensive role on balance and stall teams. It can switch into several key offensive threats such as Iron Valiant, Scizor and Breloom and completely shut down multiple defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Corviknight. With Good as Gold, Gholdengo can act as a reliable means of spinblocking and denying Defog. Recover provides Gholdengo with a means of improving its longevity, letting it switch into the aforementioned threats multiple times throughout a match. Thunder Wave allows Gholdengo to cripple threats it can lure in, like Iron Moth and Roaring Moon. Gholdengo can capitalize on the status it spreads with Hex, letting it deal high damage once its targets have been paralyzed. Gholdengo can take advantage of switches it forces by setting up Nasty Plot, letting it exert a high offensive threat level, and enabling it to win potential stalemates against bulkier Pokemon such as Corviknight and Dondozo. Alternatively, Make It Rain can be used to immediately KO Garganacl and Iron Valiant. Tera Flying improves Gholdengo's matchups against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Iron Treads. This completely flips the matchup in Gholdengo's favor, as it can use them as a point of entry to set up Nasty Plot. Tera Fairy, on the other hand, grants Gholdengo a resistance to Dark-type attacks, allowing it to survive Crunch from Roaring Moon and paralyze it with Thunder Wave. Gholdengo's item choice is quite flexible and largely depends on its team structure. Leftovers offers passive recovery, which is quite valuable to preserve Recover PP. Covert Cloak grants Gholdengo an immunity to the secondary effects of various moves, allowing it to counter Garganacl by nullifying the chip damage from Salt Cure. It is also useful to allow Gholdengo to switch into a wider pool of moves, like Hatterene's Nuzzle, with far less risk. Heavy-Duty Boots nullifies entry hazard damage, allowing Gholdengo to switch in and out with little issue. A physically defensive EV spread allows Gholdengo to more reliably check Pokemon such as Garganacl, Corviknight, and Scizor.</p> <p>Defensive Gholdengo fits on a variety of teams, but it particularly shines on balance and stall teams. Its ability to nullify most forms of hazard control is most useful to entry hazard setters such as Garchomp, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. These Pokemon also appreciate Gholdengo's ability to check Hatterene, which can bounce back hazards with Magic Bounce. If Gholdengo is utilizing Covert Cloak, it will be a great teammate to Pokemon like Dodonzo, Toxapex, and Corviknight, which struggle against Garganacl due to Salt Cure. Gholdengo can pivot into many key status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and is therefore a great ally to Pokemon that are common targets of them, such as Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Meowscarada. When not running Tera Flying, Ground-types like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire can use Gholdengo as an entry point to either deal high damage to it with Earthquake or set up entry hazards. Corviknight is thus a great partner, as it can switch into them with ease and clear entry hazards they may set up with Defog. Hatterene is another good teammate, since it can completely shut down attempts to set up entry hazards with Magic Bounce. Gholdengo is also quite vulnerable to a few other offensive threats, such as Volcarona, Cinderace, and Kingambit, so bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Toxpaex can switch into these Pokemon and prevent setup via Unaware and Haze, respectively, which Gholdengo will greatly appreciate. Garchomp and Great Tusk can switch into Cinderace and Kingambit and threaten them out with Earthquake, and they can also benefit from Gholdengo's Thunder Wave support, allowing them to more reliably check Cinderace and Iron Moth.</p> "

Gholdengo's typing and unique ability in Good as Gold make it the premier stopgap to entry hazard removal and a good asset for entry hazard-stacking teams. Gholdengo can switch in on Defoggers like Rotom-W and Tornadus-T—the tier's top Defogger—and can switch in on status moves like Leech Seed from Ferrothorn and Toxic from Clodsire after Gholdengo Terastallizes. A STAB combination of Ghost / Steel hits many targets neutrally, with Shadow Ball being incredibly spammable and Make It Rain hitting Ghost-resistant Pokemon like Garganacl, Tyranitar, and Weavile; the former two are otherwise able to switch in freely. Tera Fairy lets Gholdengo switch out of otherwise crippling Pursuit, and Water lets it stay in on four attacks Kingambit and begin setting up. The removal of a Ground weakness also allows it to take advantage of Heatran, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire. 128 Special Defense EVs let Gholdengo survive two Heat Waves from offensive Tornadus-T from maximum HP, while the Special Attack allows it to OHKO bulky Tornadus-T with Make It Rain after a Nasty Plot; the remaining are put in Defense to take hits from the likes of Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar much better after Terastallizing. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, Gastrodon, and Mega Diancie appreciate their hazards staying up for as long as possible. Pokemon like Mega Lopunny appreciate Gholdengo beating common revenge killers in Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Zamazenta. Rotom-W is notable in that it checks Pokemon like Mega Swampert, Heatran, and Victini, and it appreciates Gholdengo providing entry hazard control. Gholdengo struggles against Kingambit, which it lets in for free and struggles to switch out of due to Pursuit. Kingambit is punished by Fighting-type teammates such as Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Mega Lopunny. Gholdengo also struggles against Mega Lopunny, which can switch in on stray Shadow Balls and bypass its Fighting immunity with Scrappy. Gholdengo also struggles against Clodsire and opposing Ghost-types, such as Dragapult and opposing Gholdengo. These can be checked by Pursuit users such as Weavile, Kingambit, and Mega Tyranitar.</p> "

Ruination allows Ting-Lu to pressure Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T, which don't care about its Earthquake.

Psyshock hits Poison-types like Clodsire, Toxapex, and Amoonguss. Shadow Ball targets Gholdengo and Skeledirge, while Thunderbolt is used to hit Corviknight, as well as doing super effective damage to Toxapex, Tera Flying Gholdengo, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Trick is another option to cripple common switch-ins such as Clodsire, Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Volcarona. Focus Blast threatens an OHKO on Garganacl while greatly damaging Corviknight. However, Aura Sphere is another option that is more consistent thanks to its accuracy, though it misses out on the damage output of Focus Blast. Tera Fairy powers up Moonblast and removes Iron Valiant's weakness to Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks. Alternatively, Tera Ghost makes Iron Valiant immune to Dragonite's Extreme Speed, allows it to OHKO Gholdengo, and increases its damage output against Skeledirge. Tera Electric is a final option to OHKO Toxapex and physically defensive Corviknight and turn its Steel-type weakness into a resistance.</p> <p>Physically offensive Pokemon such as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Cinderace benefit from Iron Valiant, as they struggle against Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Rotom-W, all of which Iron Valiant can pressure effectively. Entry hazard support from partners like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Garchomp provides chip damage against Pokemon that try to play around Iron Valiant such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Pivots such as Rotom-W, Dragapult, Cinderace, and Corviknight give Iron Valiant opportunities to get on the field, reducing the risk of it taking damage. Volcarona can counter Iron Valiant, as it is only 3HKOed by all of its attacks and can set up in front of it. Therefore, Toxapex is a great partner, as is specially defensive Garganacl, which can handle Will-O-Wisp Volcarona, and Dragonite, which can handle Giga Drain variants. Iron Valiant enjoys the presence of partners that it can rely on to take hits, such as Toxapex, Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, due to its frailty. Keeping the field free from hazards grants Iron Valiant more chances to get on the field and make progress, so teammates with access to Rapid Spin or Defog such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Corviknight are appreciated.</p> "

Its Quark Drive-boosted Speed from Booster Energy turns it into a potent late-game cleaner, letting it outspeed would-be revenge killers like Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, which is further enforced by its unique typing that resists Sucker Punch from Kingambit. However, it can also be used to revenge kill boosted threats like Baxcalibur and Dragonite in a pinch, especially since Iron Valiant can take on the latter's +1 Tera Normal Extreme Speed from full health. Tera Fairy boosts Iron Valiant's Moonblast while still retaining its defensive profile to take on Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Tera Electric amplifies Thunderbolt's damage, notably allowing it to 2HKO would-be checks like Toxapex, specially defensive Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl, and offensive Gholdengo after Stealth Rock, as well as preventing Iron Valiant from being revenge killed by Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> <p>Mixed Iron Valiant is commonly seen on offense and bulky offense teams. Due to the lack of a damage boosting item or setup move, it can still fall short of threatening bulky Pokemon like Amoonguss, and without Shadow Ball or Knock Off, Skeledirge and defensive Gholdengo as well; thus, Pokemon that can deal with them such as Great Tusk, and Kingambit make good teammates. Particularly, the aforementioned Pokemon can overwhelm a shared check in Corviknight and are generally effective as early-game wallbreakers that can open up Iron Valiant to clean up late-game easily. Entry hazards from teammates like Garchomp, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora can chip down foes like Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Tera Grass Dondozo. A sturdy defensive backbone with the likes of Corviknight and Ting-Lu can help check offensive threats that threaten Iron Valiant out, such as a boosted Roaring Moon, opposing Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo. Pivots like Dragapult, Scizor, and Rotom-W can compensate for Iron Valiant's lack of bulk by bringing it in safely on foes like Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Blissey, respectively; the latter can also cripple Amoonguss with either Trick or Will-O-Wisp. Gholdengo is a great partner, as it reliably prevents the much-needed entry hazards from being removed by Rapid Spin and Defog, threatens Skeledirge and Tera Fairy Garganacl, and appreciates Iron Valiant dealing with foes like Corviknight and Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon in return.</p> "

Thunderbolt allows Iron Valiant to damage Corviknight and bulky Water-types like Dondozo, Azumarill, Toxapex, and Tera Water Garganacl, while Psyshock scores a 2HKO on any Clodsire looking to stop Iron Valiant's sweep. With Calm Mind, Iron Valiant can switch roles from an endgame sweeper to a powerful wallbreaker. After one Calm Mind, Moonblast 2HKOes defensive Garganacl, and +1 Tera Electric Thunderbolt 2HKOes specially defensive Slowking and OHKOes Corviknight. Tera Fairy powers up Moonblast, which can now 2HKO Garganacl and Hatterene. Tera Electric boosts the power of Thunderbolt, which secures important 2HKOs on specially defensive Dodonzo, Corviknight, and Toxapex, lets Iron Valiant survive Scizor's Bullet Punch, and grants Iron Valiant an immunity to paralysis from Hatterene's Nuzzle.</p> <p>Iron Valiant relies heavily on its super-effective coverage moves for damage output. As a result, it struggles to make progress against Pokemon like Volcarona, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo. Thus, teammates like Clodsire and Ting-Lu are good defensive partners for Iron Valiant, with the added benefit of being able to set up entry hazards. Iron Moth has strong offensive synergy with Iron Valiant, being able to threaten Amoonguss, Iron Treads, and Tera Fairy Garganacl, while also being able to chip down special walls like Clodsire. On offense teams, Iron Valiant complements powerful wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and Kingambit, since they can overwhelm defensive cores and open up the path for Iron Valiant to sweep. Finally, Iron Valiant is highly reliant on Booster Energy to sweep, as it cannot normally outspeed common revenge-killers like Dragapult, Cinderace, and Meowscarada. Therefore, it is important to time when to switch in to Iron Valiant to ensure defensive counters like Skeledirge and Volcarona are either removed or heavily damaged so it can sweep or break through the opposing team effectively. Along these lines, it is important to conserve Iron Valiant's health, since it can survive key priority moves such as Extreme Speed from Tera Normal Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. Therefore, Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads, are great teammates for Iron Valiant.</p> "

It also has a spammable Fairy STAB movr in Moonblast, which allows it to ease the Dark match up by threatening Sableye while also neutering opposing Fighting-types such as Great Tusk and Breloom. Thunderbolt hits Water- and Flying-types such as Dondozo and Corviknight. Psyshock hits Poison-types such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire, whereas Future Sight can apply pressure to opponents like Toxapex for teammates such as Breloom and Gallade. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types such as Gholdengo and Skeledirge.

Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo, Quaquaval, and Slither Wing pressure Pokemon faster than Iron Valiant such as Greninja, Dragapult, and Cinderace. Tauros-F is another fantastic partner thanks to its ability to shatter dual screens with Raging Bull, making Iron Valiant more effective in matchups against Dark, Fairy, and Ice, all while avoiding burns thanks to its part Fire typing, which helps against Ghost and Dark teams.</p> "

Additionally, Skeledirge switching into Close Combat on the previous turn doubles Stomping Tantrum's power, allowing Koraidon to OHKO Skeledirge. Wild Charge OHKOes Pelipper and 2HKOes Toxapex. Alternatively, Outrage is a good all-around Dragon-type STAB option that still hits Pelipper and Alomomola but makes it vulnerable to Tera Fairy from checks such as Pelipper and Toxapex as well as revenge killers such as Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle. Tera Fire boosts Flare Blitz, lets Koraidon ward off Will-O-Wisp from Skeledirge, and lets it resist Ice- and Fairy-type moves from Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle, Double Dance Miraidon, and Flutter Mane. Entry hazard removal options such as Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads are good teammates, as Koraidon can easily get worn down due to Life Orb and Flare Blitz recoil as well as Rocky Helmet chip from Alomomola and Toxapex.
