          "description": "<p>Charizard is a threatening special attacker with great typing and solid bulk. It also outspeeds a majority of the metagame's threats like Rotom-F, Houndoom, and non-Scarf Sawsbuck, which makes it even more difficult to deal with. Fire Blast can be slotted over Flamethrower for a more powerful STAB move, although there are accuracy problems for both of it STAB moves. Focus Blast is great coverage with the ability to OHKO the likes of Lycanroc-N, Alolan Persian, and Vigoroth, whereas its STAB moves do not. Tera Blast Steel can be picked over Focus Blast to target counters that Charizard struggles with like Carbink and Dachsbun. Will-O-Wisp helps cripple opposing physical attackers, which can safely come in on Charizard like Gabite, Vigoroth, and specially defensive Skuntank. However, Air Slash can be chosen over Will-O-Wisp for a more consistent Flying-type STAB alongside the somewhat inaccurate Hurricane. Tera Flying is for greatly boosting Hurricanes power, allowing it to pick up the 2HKO on bulky Gabite sets, Camerupt, and Dachsbun and the OHKO on the threatening Basculin. Defensively, Tera Dragon is the best choice for Charizard. It turns its weaknesses to Electric- and Water-type moves into resistances while still keeping its previous resistances to Grass and Fire and turning Rock-type moves turn into neutral hits. This allows it to take hits from its many threats like Raichu, Golduck, and Lycanroc-N. Tera Fire helps Flamethrower make up for the loss of power when chosen over Fire Blast, especially if it gets into Blaze range. It allows Charizard to 2HKO bulky Pokemon it otherwise wouldn't like Articuno and Tinkatuff. Deciding to Terastallize into either of its offensive types helps relieve its quad weakness to Rock, allowing it to live a hit from Gogoat, Gabite, and Alolan Persian.</p> <p>Special Charizard works well on balance and offensive teams that are looking for a fast and powerful attacker. Charizard does great when paired with a physical breaker like Perrserker, Basculin, or Lycanroc-N to help with the special walls like Carbink and Dachsbun that it struggles to get through. On the other hand, it does great at breaking through the physically defensive Pokemon that physical attackers like Perrserker, Gogoat, and defensive setup sweeper Carbink have trouble with such as Dartrix, Misdreavus, and Leafeon. Charizard appreciates being paired with the likes of Quaxwell, Mareanie, and Lumineon to take hits for it from Golduck, Basculin, and opposing Lumineon. Although, its most glaring issue is the 4x weakness to Rock, which Lycanroc-N, Dugtrio, and Gabite can take advantage of. There are also other Pokemon like Misdreavus, Gogoat, and Alolan Persian that can slot Rock-type moves to catch Charizard switching in. This is why Charizard appreciates the presence of Whiscash and its own Gabite to handle these issues. Charizard only has one full counter, which is Carbink, barring Tera Blast Steel; however, there are a few other options using Tera such as using Tera Steel Dachsbun, Tera Rock Misdreavus, and Tera Rock Gogoat that can check it in a pinch. Although, the likes of Gabite, Perrserker, and Golduck can help come in and remove them after they Terastallize. Skuntank, Sawsbuck, and Flapple appreciate Charizard for helping them handle Perrserker. It is also worth mentioning that it prefers to be on the same team as a Knock Off absorber like Alolan Persian or Skuntank, because losing Heavy-Duty Boots greatly impacts its longevity.</p> "

Dragon Dance gives a solid damage boost and also allows Charizard to outspeed common Scarf users after a boost, such as Flapple and Basculin; however, Swords Dance can be used instead, trading away extra Speed for more firepower. While Flare Blitz is the normal STAB move of choice for Charizard, Flame Charge can be used on Swords Dance sets, as it boosts Charizard's Speed and removes the recoil from Flare Blitz, although at the cost of being much weaker. Earthquake is valuable coverage, hitting Pokemon such as Carbink, Skuntank, and Lycanroc-N for super effective damage. Dragon Claw hits opposing Dragon-types such as Gabite and Tera Dragon Articuno for good damage, and Thunder Punch can deal solid damage into Water- and Flying-types such as Lumineon, Golduck, and opposing Charizard. Charizard's Tera Type is very adjustable; Tera Ground is normally preferred to resist Rock-type attacks from Pokemon such as Lycanroc-N, boost the power of Earthquake, and remove Charizard's weakness to the Electric-Type, while Tera Dragon allows for resistances to Water and Electric and should be used with Dragon Claw. Finally, Tera Electric should be used with Thunder Punch.</p> <p>Charizard's best partners are ones that can beat its offensive and defensive checks to open it up to set up and sweep easier. Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Basculin can help with the Ground-types that Charizard can struggle with. Grass-types such as Gogoat can threaten out Water- and Rock-types that would stop Charizard from setting up such as Basculin and Carbink. Articuno can U-turn to get Charizard in safely and checks the Dragon-types that would otherwise beat Charizard without Dragon Claw such as Gabite. In return, Charizard threatens out Steel-types that check Articuno. On Swords Dance sets, Sticky Web Masquerain can be a good partner, as it allows Charizard to beat the Choice Scarfers that normally outspeed and KO Swords Dance Charizard otherwise, such as Lycanroc-N.</p> "

Weather Ball is an interesting option, as it presents a challenge to rain teams by dealing considerable damage to Pelipper on the switch, but it comes at the cost of Mega Charizard Y losing its primary STAB move outside of sun. Scorching Sands pressures Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, while Focus Blast threatens Mega Tyranitar. Mega Charizard Y's tremendous wallbreaking prowess allows late-game sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult, Dragonite, and Volcarona to take advantage of Unaware walls that have been compromised, such as Skeledirge and Clodsire. Mega Charizard Y's sun support benefits Protosynthesis users such as Great Tusk. Mega Charizard Y appreciates entry hazard control from teammates such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Kartana, as it is extremely susceptible to Stealth Rock. It also struggles to break bulky Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Mega Latias as well as special walls like Clodsire and Hippowdon. Weavile, Tyranitar, and Kingambit subsequently form strong offensive cores with Mega Charizard Y, as they are able to Pursuit trap its aforementioned checks, with the former being able to deal with Hippowdon as well.

Aside from granting Mega Charizard X more setup opportunities, Roost compensates for Flare Blitz recoil and its Stealth Rock weakness, allowing it to take advantage of its typing and natural bulk to soft check common foes like Volcarona, Mega Scizor, and Choice Scarf Kartana as well as preventing revenge killing attempts from Mega Lopunny and Kingambit. Dragon Claw is an alternative on hyper offense teams where the longevity isn't as necessary, which allows Mega Charizard X to hit Dragonite, Mega Latias, and Garchomp as well as providing neutral coverage against foes like Rotom-W, Tera Water Skeledirge, and Tera Grass Heatran. Offensive partners like Kartana, Weavile, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit can pressure the opposition early-game for Mega Charizard X to sweep more easily, as they can cripple and either pressure or overwhelm shared checks in Toxapex, Slowbro, Skeledirge, and Iron Defense Garganacl; in return, it threatens Tangrowth for Kartana, handles Gholdengo for Iron Valiant, and melts other Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Corviknight for them. Pivots like Dragapult, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T bring Mega Charizard X in safely via U-turn on Pokemon like Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Gholdengo, respectively; the latter two in particular can remove entry hazards with Defog so it can enter the field unscathed, especially if it's not running Roost and hasn't Mega Evolved yet.

Since Pikachu is extremely frail, it can easily fall to any strong move from opposing threats it wants to transform into. Therefore, significant team support is needed to realize its potential.

Alolan Ninetales's teammates appreciate its supportive capabilities; setup sweepers like Swords Dance Weavile and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur have a lot more setup opportunities, and offensive Pokemon like Galarian Darmanitan have an easier time switching in. Cloyster is a stellar partner; its defensive set removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin and sets Spikes to wear down Keldeo and Toxapex for Alolan Ninetales, while Shell Smash variants can more easily set up with its assistance. SubRoost Kyurem helps Alolan Ninetales pressure Water teams with its own Freeze-Dry and checks Fighting-types like Galarian Zapdos with a Chople Berry. Piloswine lays down Stealth Rock and switches into and checks a variety of Fire-types that Alolan Ninetales hates, such as Volcarona and Iron Moth.</p> "

Stone Edge hits Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle for maximum damage. Tera Fairy + Tera Blast allows it to trap and OHKO unboosted Koraidon, Choice Band Chien-Pao that isn't locked into Ice Shard, and weakened offensive Great Tusk and Walking Wake. Additionally, it can dispatch Choice item Koraidon, Walking Wake, and Miraidon locked into Outrage or Draco Meteor. Memento gives setup opportunities to teammates on a trapped Pokemon Dugtrio can't do much against, such as Great Tusk, while Final Gambit trades it for more damage on Iron Bundle, Koraidon, and unboosted Tera Fairy Miraidon. Choice Scarf Dugtrio is used on balance teams but has no defensive utility and fails to beat Double Dance Miraidon, Iron Bundle in Electric Terrain, Swords Dance + Flame Charge Koraidon, and Swords Dance Chien-Pao. Thus, it is crucial to pair it with checks to these threats such as Iron Treads, Clodsire, Toxapex, Alomomola, and Dondozo. Pelipper and Corviknight are solid walls that can also pivot Dugtrio in, establishing opportunities for it to trap Pokemon. Miraidon, Walking Wake, Iron Bundle, Chien Pao, and offensive Great Tusk appreciate Dugtrio getting rid of the Pokemon that check or revenge kill them. Dugtrio can also fit on stall teams since it traps strong threats and prevents them from getting multiple KOs, including Gothitelle, which is a major hindrance to bulkier structures.</p> "

          "description": "<p>While slower than its Kantonian cousin, Alolan Dugtrio still serves as one of the PU metagame's strongest wallbreakers thanks to its uncommon Steel typing, high power, and great coverage. This access to a rare STAB typing, as well as a still excellent Speed tier, cement its niche alongside other powerful Ground-types such as Dugtrio and Gabite. Earthquake and Iron Head allow Alolan Dugtrio to threaten commonplace Pokemon such as Carbink, Pyroar, Dachsbun, and Lycanroc-N. Stone Edge allows Alolan Dugtrio to hit Charizard for meaningful damage while also providing extra power against targets such as Masquerain and Vespiquen. Substitute, on the other hand, allows Alolan Dugtrio to take advantage of slower, more passive Pokemon, such as Vespiquen, Tinkatuff, and Carbink, in order to buffer a hit, gain momentum from a forced switch, or safely set up with Swords Dance. Sucker Punch provides insurance against Choice Scarf users and Pokemon that are naturally faster than Alolan Dugtrio, such as Basculin and Dugtrio, respectively. Swords Dance allows Alolan Dugtrio to take advantage of passive opponents and forced switches as well as break through naturally bulky Pokemon it may not have coverage for, such as Whiscash. Heavy-Duty Boots helps to provide more opportunities for Alolan Dugtrio to come in by negating entry hazards, while Life Orb provides a damage boost, which can be especially helpful if Alolan Dugtrio chooses not to run Swords Dance. Air Balloon is also a choice, making Alolan Dugtrio immune to Ground-type moves, like Dugtrio or Gabite's Earthquake, as well as providing a temporary immunity to Sticky Web and Spikes. Tera Ground allows for Alolan Dugtrio's Earthquake to deal even more damage, which is especially helpful against neutral targets like Gabite. Tera Steel is also an option, as it provides key resistances against moves such as Gogoat's Horn Leech and Choice Scarf Rotom-F's Blizzard while also boosting the power of Iron Head.</p> <p>Alolan Dugtrio serves as an excellent wallbreaker for fast-paced offensive teams that need a combination of speed and power to deal with threats such as Carbink, Pyroar, and Dachsbun. Due to being one of the few Steel-types available in the tier, Alolan Dugtrio's access to a strong, fast Iron Head is a quality greatly appreciated by common Fire-type wallbreakers such as Charizard, Pyroar, and Houndoom, which struggle against common Rock-types such as Carbink and Lycanroc-N. In return, Alolan Dugtrio greatly appreciates the Fire-types' ability to deal with Grass-types such as Gogoat and Thwackey, as these Grass-types resist Earthquake and also often have good matchups against the entry hazard setters it is paired with. This especially applies to Thwackey, which further reduces the damage of Alolan Dugtrio's Earthquake by setting Grassy Terrain. A teammate that can deal with Misdreavus, such as Haunter or Houndoom, is also imperative, as Misdreavus can easily cripple Alolan Dugtrio with Will-O-Wisp.</p> "

          "name": "Choice Item",
          "description": "<p>Alongside Alolan Dugtrio's amazing typing, great Speed, and decent Attack, Choice items make it a more immediate offensive threat compared to support items such as Heavy-Duty Boots. Stone Edge is Alolan Dugtrio's best coverage option, hitting the few Pokemon that resist its STAB combination like Rotom-S and Charizard. Sucker Punch can also situationally be used alongside Choice Scarf to move before foes like Aqua Jet Basculin. Memento is good late-game, allowing Alolan Dugtrio to provide momentum and offer potential setup opportunities for teammates. Stealth Rock is a niche option on Choice Scarf sets if a team has no space for it otherwise, and, although it is a bad move to be locked into, it can also be used to fake being non-Choice Scarf. Jolly is by far the preferred nature to outspeed threats such as Basculin and Pyroar, but Adamant can be used with Choice Band to further Alolan Dugtrio's wallbreaking capabilities. Tangling Hair is situational but can punish moves such as Skuntank's Sucker Punch and Choice Scarf Sawsbuck's Horn Leech. Tera Ground and Steel power up Alolan Dugtrio's STAB moves to harder hit select targets, such as Earthquake against Whiscash and Lumineon and Iron Head against Gogoat and Misdreavus. They also offer defensive perks, such as Tera Ground making Alolan Dugtrio lose the weakness to Gabite's Earthquake and Tera Steel the weakness to Basculin's Aqua Jet. Choice Band makes Alolan Dugtrio a threatening wallbreaker, and Choice Scarf provides speed control for fast threats such as Alolan Persian, Dugtrio, and +1 Quiver Dance Masquerain. Alolan Dugtrio is notably one of the fastest Choice Scarf users, outspeeding not only other Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F and Haunter but also Speed-boosting setup move users such as Dragon Dance Charizard and Agility Wyrdeer. This also means that even without the extra Speed, Choice Band Dugtrio still makes for solid Speed control, especially alongside Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Alolan Dugtrio makes for great glue on balance and offensive teams, being flexibly able to swap Choice items based on the team's need of either a wallbreaker or speed control while also being a last resort option for roles such as Stealth Rock setter and Volt Switch immunity if need be. Due to being Choice-locked, Alolan Dugtrio is very prediction reliant, which means an incorrect prediction could allow common threats such as Dragon Dance Charizard and Bulk Up Gogoat to use it as setup fodder. Bulky teammates with utility moves can stop this from getting out of hand, such as Haze Mareanie, Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp Misdreavus, and Roar Dachsbun. Being Choice-locked will inevitably also lead to a lot of switches, and while Alolan Dugtrio's typing allows it to switch into a handful of moves such as Lycanroc's Stone Edge and Rotom-F's Volt Switch or Discharge, its common weaknesses and frailty leave it at risk of being OHKOed by attacks such as Close Combat and Blizzard. Pivots such as Alolan Persian, Raichu, and Lumineon can help take away this risk and increase Alolan Dugtrio's overall longevity. Alolan Persian and Raichu can also run Nasty Plot sets, which benefit from Alolan Dugtrio's Memento making setting up easier. Alolan Dugtrio can be paired with other Choice item users like Haunter and Basculin to create mind games as to which the wallbreaker and Choice Scarf user are while also helping one another weaken foes and clean up the match, respectively. An alternative option to Alolan Dugtrio is its Kantonian form, Dugtrio. Dugtrio's higher Speed allows it to naturally outspeed Alolan Persian and Raichu, although lack of secondary STAB makes it worse with Choice items and is overall better used as a setup sweeper or wallbreaker. Alolan Dugtrio should be used if seeking immediate power as a wallbreaker with Choice Band or reliable speed control with Choice Scarf.</p> "

Foul Play threatens physical attackers such as Alolan Dugtrio and Basculin with good damage. Parting Shot allows Alolan Persian to weaken the foe by lowering its offensive stats, allowing teammates an easier time coming in safely, but U-turn can be used to deal slight chip damage and notably also allows Alolan Persian to pivot out from Carbink. Thunder Wave can cripple foes such as Quiver Dance Masquerain, Dragon Dance Charizard, and opposing Alolan Persian. Taunt can prevent Pokemon such as Tinkatuff and Misdreavus from attempting to set entry hazards or spread status and can also prevent setup sweepers from setting up safely. Tera Ghost allows Alolan Persian to deal with Fighting-types such as Crabominable and Falinks as well as block Carbink's Body Press. Alolan Persian opts to run Defense EVs over HP EVs due to Fur Coat making Alolan Persian bulkier on the defensive side.</p> <p>Wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Crabominable, Choice Specs Indeedee, and Swords Dance Alolan Dugtrio appreciate Alolan Persian being able to get them safe entry onto the battlefield. In return, these wallbreakers can muscle through threats Alolan Persian struggles with such as Skuntank and Tinkatuff. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Perrserker, Flapple, and Raichu can form a VoltTurn combination with Alolan Persian. Chansey makes an excellent partner, as Chansey covers the special attackers such as Houndoom that Alolan Persian struggles with while Alolan Persian deals with the physical threats such as Honchkrow that can cause Chansey problems. Revenge killers and late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Basculin and Pyroar appreciate Alolan Persian helping them come in safely, spreading paralysis for them, and being a fallback against threats such as Alolan Dugtrio. Pokemon such as Alolan Dugtrio, Whiscash, and Gogoat are useful partners, as they pressure Carbink, allowing Alolan Persian to be able to use Parting Shot more safely.</p> "

Thunderbolt provides solid coverage alongside Dark Pulse, hitting checks to Dark-types like Dachsbun and Houndoom for decent damage, as well as forcing out wallbreakers such as Basculin and Charizard. Taunt stops switch-ins like Dachsbun, Hisuian Sliggoo, and Gogoat from using recovery moves while also stopping status attempts from foes like Skuntank and Misdreavus. Parting Shot keeps up momentum on offensive teams, letting Alolan Persian pivot mid-game against Pokemon it struggles to deal with, like Tinkatuff and Whiscash. Tera Electric makes Alolan Persian harder to cripple by Thunder Wave users like Chansey and Wyrdeer, allows Thunderbolt to heavily dent foes like Dunsparce and Tera Fairy Misdreavus at +2, and makes revenge killing it with Electrode and Choice Scarf Lycanroc-N&amp;emdash;two solid speed control options&amp;emdash;much more difficult. However, Tera Steel with Tera Blast can be used to immediately remove Carbink, one of Alolan Persian's most annoying switch-ins, as well as allow it to more easily setup on Pokemon like Skuntank, Gogoat, and Rotom-F Choice locked into Blizzard, at the cost of being much more reliant on Terastallizing for coverage and lacking the defensive utility Tera Electric provides versus paralysis and Electrode.</p> <p>As stated before, Alolan Persian is at its best late-game when its checks have been sufficiently weakened; as such, it appreciates strong mid-game wallbreakers such as Basculin, Charizard, and Pyroar, which can force damage on shared checks like Gogoat, Carbink, and Gabite, respectively, clearing the way for an Alolan Persian cleanup. Fellow Nasty Plot users such as Misdreavus and Rotom-F are equally adept at wearing down shared switch-ins like Chansey and Whiscash. Rotom-F can also form a strong pivoting core with Parting Shot variants of Alolan Persian. Alolan Persian isn't forced out by much, but before Terastallizing, it can be exploited by foes like Electrode and Choice Scarf Indeedee-F, so switch-ins to them, like Whiscash and Perrserker, are recommended. Both of the latter two Pokemon can also set entry hazards to wear down Alolan Persian's switch-ins like Tinkatuff and Dunsparce while Perrserker can bring Alolan Persian in with a slow U-turn.</p> "

Vital Spirit can be helpful on teams lacking a Grass-type, as it provides a switch-in to Toedscool's Spore, while Defiant is very useful in matchups against Pokemon such as Sticky Web Surskit and Parting Shot Shroodle, as the Attack boosts make Mankey nigh unwallable. Tera Fighting allows Mankey to hit as hard as possible with Close Combat in situations where an unboosted hit is insufficient.

Notably, it lives all of Meowscarada's attacks and +2 Scizor's Bullet Punch. Rock Head allows Hisuian Arcanine to freely use Head Smash and Flare Blitz without their recoil damage. Head Smash is an immensely powerful move, enabling Hisuian Arcanine to 2HKO Toxapex and defensive Landorus-T after Intimidate. Flare Blitz threatens Amoonguss, Corviknight, and Toedscruel, while breaking through Steel teams in general with ease in conjunction with Close Combat. Close Combat provides coverage for Hisuian Goodra, Ursaluna, and Heatran, while also fighting off Dark-types such as Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and non-Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott.

Glimmora forms a potent wallbreaking core with Hisuian Arcanine, taking on Grass and Fairy teams effectively. Furthermore, Glimmora provides entry hazard control with Mortal Spin and sets its own array of hazards to wear down Hisuian Arcanine's switch-ins. In return, Glimmora appreciates Hisuian Arcanine removing Steel-types for it so it can freely use Mortal Spin. Tyranitar provides sandstorm to help chip down opponents and improve Hisuian Arcanine's special bulk, making it trickier to shut down, as well as sets Stealth Rock and spreads paralysis with Thunder Wave to help Hisuian Arcanine outpace and OHKO faster offensive Pokemon. Kleavor provides Stealth Rock with Stone Axe and pivots into Hisuian Arcanine with U-turn, as well as provides additional support in the Steel matchup by hitting Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Heatran with either Night Slash or Close Combat. Shell Smash Drednaw is a great asset in the Water and Ground matchups due to Swift Swim and Air Balloon, heavily weakening those types for Hisuian Arcanine. In return, Drednaw appreciates Amoonguss and Toxapex being removed by Hisuian Arcanine.</p> "

As they're forced out, Slowbro can use Teleport to maintain momentum and stay healthy. Scald serves as a spammable STAB attack that can cripple targets with burns, dissuading otherwise decent checks like Mega Tyranitar and physically-centric Aegislash sets from setting up. Even foes that don't rely on physical attacks, like Serperior and Latios, tend to dislike the chip from burn. Future Sight supports wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar, Buzzwole, and Enamorus in breaking through their checks such as Tangrowth and Skarmory for the former two and Galarian Slowking for the latter. It also synergizes excellently with Teleport. Slack Off serves as reliable recovery that doesn't require Slowbro to switch out. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Slowbro to avoid taking damage from entry hazards, maximizing HP regained from Regenerator, though Rocky Helmet can be held instead to punish contact move users, notably foes that run U-turn like Cinderace. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to make Slowbro as slow as possible, maximizing its odds of moving slower than opposing Teleport users. Slowbro best fits on bulky offense and balance teams looking for a reliable defensive pivot that can also generate momentum for wallbreakers. Hazard-stacking teammates like Skarmory, defensive Clefable, and Hippowdon pair up nicely with Future Sight, further putting pressure on opposing defensive cores. Many hazard-stacking teammates can also double as checks to Pokemon Slowbro struggles against, such as Clefable checking Dark-types like Hydreigon, Skarmory handling Bug- and Grass-types like Buzzwole and Meowscarada, and Hippowdon checking Electric-types like Iron Hands as well as Galarian Slowking. Similarly, pivots like Scizor and Iron Treads also check threats like Galarian Slowking while pairing nicely with Slowbro's own pivoting potential to maintain offensive momentum. If it isn't running Heavy-Duty Boots, hazard control from teammates like Hydreigon, Choice Scarf Serperior, and Iron Treads is necessary.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Cloyster is one of Ice's best setup sweepers thanks to its access to Shell Smash in addition to its high Defense stat, which gives it opportunity to set up on the tier's physical attackers like Garchomp, Iron Treads, and Ceruledge. Icicle Spear targets opposing Flying-, Ground- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kilowattrel, Clodsire, and Walking Wake while breaking Focus Sash on Pokemon such as Breloom. Rock Blast benefits from Skill Link and threatens Fire-types like Ceruledge after a boost and other Ice-type Pokemon like Chien-Pao. Ice Shard is useful for revenge killing faster Choice Scarf Pokemon that are weakened like Flutter Mane, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Hydro Pump is the alternative in order to not be walled by opposing Steel-types like Kingambit and Forretress. It is also beneficial for threatening Paldean Tauros-F, which is a significant issue to Ice teams, as well as Skeledirge and Torkoal, easing the Fire matchup. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows +2 Cloyster to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Walking Wake, Hydreigon and Indeedee; a Naive nature with the remaining 4 EVs going into Special Attack should be used if opting for Hydro Pump to not reduce its damage. Skill Link is the best ability to run on Cloyster since it guarantees Icicle Spear and Rock Blast hit 5 times. White Herb is Cloyster's preferred item, as it is able to offset the Defense drops of Shell Smash, which makes Cloyster harder to revenge kill. Focus Sash is the alternative to always guarantee one turn of setup from full health, but it is less preferred since Cloyster is harder to OHKO under snow or Aurora Veil.</p> <p>Cloyster's best partner on Ice is Abomasnow. Abomasnow allows Cloyster to have an easier time to set up thanks to it setting snow, which, combined with Aurora Veil, allows it to set up on Pokemon that can usually threaten it out like offensive Great Tusk and Cinderace. Abomasnow also has Leech Seed support to improve Cloyster's longevity and handles Unaware Pokemon Quagsire and Dondozo with its STAB Giga Drain. Cloyster is able to threaten Fire's weather setter Torkoal after a boost, which benefits Abomasnow, as it can come back in to reset the weather for its teammates. Cloyster also appreciates Chien-Pao as an offensive partner, as Swords Dance sets are able to weaken its defensive checks like Toxapex, Kingambit and Rotom-W. Choice Scarf sets are also able to clean up late-game more easily thanks to Cloyster's sweeping. Baxcalibur is also one more offensive partner for Cloyster, as its ability to switch into Will-o-Wisp from Pokemon like Sableye and Rotom-W supports Cloyster's sweeping capabilities, while Cloyster offers additional support against the Dragon-types that threaten Baxcalibur like Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Hydreigon. Choice Band Baxcalibur can also wear down defensive walls like Corviknight and Skeledirge, which gives Cloyster an easier sweep. Glaceon also pairs well with Cloyster, as it can threaten defensive Water-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Dondozo with Freeze-Dry. Avalugg can support Cloyster with its Rapid Spin to remove hazards, so Cloyster can come in easier and set up. Avalugg is also able to handle Cloyster's offensive checks like Great Tusk under snow. Froslass is Ice's only viable option for Spikes, which Cloyster appreciates, as defensive Pokemon like Hatterene and Iron Hands aren't able to check it properly after a boost.</p> "

It also gets around priority attacks from Breloom, Dragapult, and Meowscarada after a Shell Smash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Blast: This is Closyer's best shot at dealing with the many Tera Fires that resist Icicle Spear, as well as OHKOing Chien-Pao, Iron Bundle, and Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drill Run: This hits Gholdengo and other Steel-types hard without needing to Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly: Adamant is the preferred nature to maximize offensive power, as a single Shell Smash lets you outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. However, Cloyster is in the same speed tier as Breloom, so Jolly is a consideration if you want to minimize Speed tie scenarios in that matchup.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: As a Focus Sash user, Cloyster wants to avoid using Tera when possible, but opposing priority attacks and defensive typings can sometimes make it a necessity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Since Cloyster will often be at extremely low health after Shell Smash, Tera Ghost helps it avoid getting revenge killed by Breloom's Mach Punch and Dragonite’s Extreme Speed. It also provides coverage against Gholdengo with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice: The increased damage from Tera Ice makes it very difficult for Pokemon to wall Cloyster without resisting it, with even Corviknight getting OHKOed by +2 Adamant Icicle Spear after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground: Volt Switch users like Rotom-W love to take Cloyster down to its Sash and pivot to a priority attacker; Tera Ground both immunes the damage and prevents the switch, giving Cloyster significant momentum with a free turn to Shell Smash. It also lets Cloyster challenge defensive Gholdengo, blocking Thunder Wave and giving +2 Adamant Drill Run a strong chance to OHKO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire: While Tera Fire Tera Blast actually does less damage to Corviknight than Tera Ice Icicle Spear, Tera Fire otherwise helps Cloyster muscle past Steel-types it traditionally struggles to beat, such as Scizor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal: Tera Normal is a niche option that offers no offensive benefits to Cloyster, but it does prevent Mimikyu and Gallade from revenge killing it with Shadow Sneak.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash: Considering Cloyster's paper thin Special Defense, Focus Sash gives Cloyster by far the most set up opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>King's Rock</strong>: King's Rock is a risky option that doesn’t help Cloyster set up, but it does give Icicle Spear and Rock Blast a 41% chance of flinching.</p> </li> </ul> "

Focus Blast is useful for hitting Dark- and Normal-types such as Alolan Persian, Pyroar, and Komala that would switch into a Shadow Ball. Trick cripples checks it cannot immediately break through such as Chansey and Skuntank, while Energy Ball is specifically used for Whiscash, an otherwise solid midground option to scout whatever Haunter uses.

Alolan Persian is a top tier pivot that can easily bring Haunter in with Parting Shot and can switch into physical wallbreakers that threaten Haunter out like Dugtrio and Basculin. Rotom-F is also a strong pivot that synergizes well with Haunter, pivoting it in on Pokemon like Misdreavus while wearing down shared checks like Chansey and Whiscash. Ground-types like Camerupt and Whiscash can switch into the fast Electric-types that threaten Haunter out like Electrode and Raichu and set entry hazards that wear down Haunter's checks that do not run Heavy-Duty Boots like Tinkatuff and Hisuian Sliggoo.</p> "

Shadow Ball threatens Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Drifblim, Rotom, and Medicham, while Focus Blast threatens Normal- and Dark-types such as Dudunsparce, Ursaring, and Umbreon that can comfortably switch into Shadow Ball. Trick lets Haunter punish walls such as Chansey, Poison Touch Muk, and Umbreon by crippling them with a Choice Scarf. Sludge Bomb threatens Pokemon such as Appletun and Cacturne and can inflict poison on special walls like Eelektross, which pressures them throughout the match. It can also threaten various Pokemon such as Tera Fairy Umbreon and Drifblim. Nasty Plot can be run instead to give Haunter a boosting option after it has gotten rid of its Choice Scarf via Trick, threatening Pokemon such as Umbreon much more effectively. Destiny Bond can be used as a last resort to neutralize dangerous setup sweepers such as Coil Eelektross, Coil Sandaconda, and Bulk Up Ursaring as well as punish offensive threats such as Passimian, Zoroark, and Scyther that may attempt to revenge kill Haunter after it has lost its Choice Scarf. Tera Ghost is able to increase Haunter's cleaning potential by powering up Shadow Ball. Tera Fighting can be used to assist Haunter versus Pokemon such as Cacturne and Lycanroc by granting resistances to Sucker Punch and Accelerock, and it also powers up Focus Blast. Haunter has horrible bulk and cannot take even resisted hits well, so it is advised that you pair it with pivots such as Eelektross, Passimian, and Scyther. Furthermore, Haunter struggles with special walls such as Chansey, Umbreon, and Muk, so powerful physical attackers such as Passimian and Medicham can assist in solving this issue.</p> "

Gengar's movepool when running Hex sets is fairly flexible based on its team. It can spread status very well with Will-O-Wisp + Sludge Bomb, but Toxic Spikes can also let it help wear down its own future switch-ins, like Gastrodon, or Pokemon such as Scream Tail and Wo-Chien as they switch into its teammates. Focus Blast can be a good option to avoid letting Tyranitar switch in freely, while Substitute lets Gengar punish switches it forces against Pokemon like Wo-Chien to provide free turns and protect itself from revenge killers. Will-O-Wisp should preferably not be dropped to run a combination of these other moves, as it is fantastic for crippling Tinkaton and Tyranitar and can ensure an immediate status against Heavy-Duty Boots Gastrodon too. Tera Ghost lets Gengar significantly power up its Hex to pressure Pokemon like Gastrodon even more while removing its Ground weakness, but Gengar is often not a priority Terastallization user.</p> <p>This set fits best on bulkier teams that like to take their time wearing down the opposing team. Quagsire is an excellent teammate for this set, as it can threaten Tyranitar and Grafaiai while also spreading Toxic and entry hazards in order to wear down other Pokemon, such as Gastrodon and TInkaton. Teammates such as Wo-Chien and Cyclizar that can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Gastrodon, Wo-Chien, and Sandy Shocks are highly appreciated if Gengar is running Toxic Spikes. Wo-Chien can also help check Pokemon such as Greninja and Sandy Shocks for Gengar, while Cyclizar can help keep entry hazards off Gengar's side without removing its Toxic Spikes and give it switch-in opportunities against Decideueye and Slither Wing with U-turn. Gengar also appreciates defensive support against Pokemon such as Noivern, Scizor, and Talonflame, so teammates like Gastrodon and Talonflame are valuable. Offensive teammates, such as Pawmot and Tyranitar, appreciate Gengar's Toxic Spikes support to pressure checks like Hippowdon. Espeon can help check Gastrodon and deny it from setting Spikes against Gengar; it can also wear down Tinkaton, and it appreciates Toxic Spikes to prevent Pokemon like Scream Tail from checking it. Tinkaton can check Noivern, provide Stealth Rock, and use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Gastrodon and Slowbro. Sandy Shocks  can provide Spikes to help pressure switch-ins like Tinkaton, and it can offer entry points against Decideueye and Wo-Chien with Volt Switch.

Early-game wallbreakers like Scizor, Slither Wing, Tyranitar, and Bisharp can severely weaken or overwhelm Tinkaton, Hippowdon, and Dark-types for Gengar to clean up late-game.

In return, Gengar matches up well against offensive threats like Pawmot, Lucario, and Choice Scarf Gallade that would pose a threat to them. Offensive pivots like Sandy Shocks, Tsareena, and the aforementioned Scizor and Slither Wing can bring Gengar in safely on foes such as opposing Tsareena, Talonflame, Paldean Tauros-W, and Scream Tail, respectively. Moreover, Sandy Shocks provides entry hazards to chip down Gengar's checks, while Tsareena threatens bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon, the latter of which is especially problematic since its Sticky Hold prevents Gengar's Trick.</p> "

Thunderbolt deals a stronger blow, invaluable against bulky Water-types like Mareanie, Quaxly, and Shellos, and is valuable for cleaning up weakened fast threats. Tera Blast, once Voltorb has Terastallized, gives it the heralded BoltBeam coverage and turns the tables on would-be checks like Toedscool, Mudbray, Diglett, and Wattrel. Because of Voltorb's limited coverage and the prominence of Ground-types, Voltorb often depends on Terastallization (or the threat of it) to function well in a match. Voltorb leans on a few utility options for its fourth move due to its limited movepool; Protect stops Nymble's First Impression from revenge killing it and can scout defensive Terastallizations, especially Tera Water on Toedscool. Taunt prevents setup and entry hazards from the likes of Pawniard, Surskit, and Glimmet, and Thunder Wave neutralizes setup sweepers and faster threats that Voltorb cannot OHKO. Voltorb pairs well with teammates that can switch into its Ground-type checks when it has not Terastallized. Toedscool is a natural partner thanks to its bulk, Ground resistance, and ability to remove entry hazards for Terastallized Voltorb, given its new Stealth Rock weakness. Drifloon's Ground immunity also supports Voltorb well. As a pivot, Voltorb appreciates the support of other pivots to continually put your opponent on the back foot.

Taunt shuts down recovery attempts from checks like Gogoat, setup attempts from Pokemon like Rotom-F, and entry hazards from foes like Carbink and Tinkatuff. The move pairs well with Electrode's nature as a pivot, giving partners an easier time setting up without dealing with annoying status. Due to Electrode's relative fragility and the prevalence of entry hazards, Aftermath is more effective at punishing priority users like Alolan Dugtrio and Basculin, as they are much more afraid of the guaranteed chip damage when revenge killing Electrode than the potential paralysis that Static provides. Tera Blast Fighting is an solid option that lets Electrode revenge kill Alolan Dugtrio, Houndoom, and Rotom-F as well as dent walls like Hisuian Sliggoo and Dunsparce. Tera Blast Ice is very useful for hitting Ground- and Grass-types like Gabite and Gogoat, although its inability to OHKO Whiscash does hinder its viability. Tera Water increases Electrode's revenge killing capability against Fire-types like Charizard and Pyroar, as well as Alolan Dugtrio; however, it also leaves it susceptible to Electric-types like Raichu and opposing Electrode in the one-on-one matchup. Lastly, Tera Grass is useful for hitting Whiscash, Carbink, and Klawf all in the same slot, something no other Tera type allows Electrode to do, while Tera Ground is also an option to specifically hit Raichu.</p> <p>Electrode fits best with strong mid-game wallbreakers that struggle to get in, such as Zangoose and Basculin. Not only do they enjoy the free turn on Pokemon such as Gogoat and Carbink, they can also break down shared checks such as Gabite, making it easier for Electrode to win late-game. Whiscash is a major annoyance for Electrode, as it is immune to Taunt and is the only viable Ground-type to not take super effective damage from either of Electrode's common Tera types; thus, a strong Grass-type like Gogoat or Sawsbuck is recommended as a partner. They can also potentially force Whiscash to Terastallize, removing its Electric immunity for Electrode. Other fast Pokemon like Alolan Persian and Rotom-F can form a VoltTurn core with Electrode, utilizing entry hazards and a good Speed tier to pivot into each other's checks, such as Flapple, Skuntank, and Misdreavus, racking up chip damage. Entry hazards from Pokemon like Whiscash and Tinkatuff also benefit Electrode, as it can constantly force in Pokemon like Gabite and Dunsparce, which do not use Heavy-Duty Boots, and wear them down faster.</p> "

Other Water-types such as Basculin and Wugtrio enjoy having their Water-moves boosted as well. Masquerain is a particularly notable partner, as it has its Hurricane made 100% accurate, it can set up on foes it could normally not set up on outside of rain, such as Pyroar and Camerupt and has its Water-type coverage boosted as well, letting it chip foes like Carbink harder. Electric-types such as Raichu and Rotom-F enjoy being able to use a 100% accurate Thunder and can offensively check the opposing Water-types that would want to take advantage of rain, such as Basculin. Other Rain Dance setters such as Murkrow and Golduck are helpful for Electrode to not have to exclusively set Rain Dance for its team.</p> "

Power Whip is an alternative to threaten Water-types like Slowbro, Quagsire, and Tapu Fini, which it otherwise struggles to break through if it doesn't have access to Supersonic Skystrike. Gyarados best fits on offense teams, enjoying being paired with other sweepers like Iron Hands and Swords Dance Scizor. It supports these physical attackers by luring in and KOing common physical walls such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth with Supersonic Skystrike. Gyarados lacks the means to break through certain physical walls like Skarmory, and based on its choice of coverage it will lack the means to break through certain foes like Tangrowth and Iron Hands, making special attackers like Latios and Galarian Moltres important partners. In return, it can take advantage of some of Steel-types they tend to get picked off by like Celesteela and Scizor. Hazard support, notably from dedicated leads such as Mew and Excadrill, is very useful for chipping Gyarados's checks like Iron Hands and Choice Scarf Latias into KO range of its attacks. Conversely, Gyarados's Stealth Rock weakness means it greatly appreciates partners that can remove them or stop them from being set up, like Iron Treads and the aforementioned Mew and Excadrill.

Blissey can also use Thunder Wave to slow down opposing Choice Scarf users that would otherwise Speed tie with Ditto such as Meowscarada and Enamorus Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a powerful teammate that pairs well with Ditto, as Ditto can copy the stat boosts from setup sweepers that aim to take advantage of a Choice-locked Hisuian Zoroark. Cyclizar can be used to remove entry hazards so that Ditto can switch in frequently without getting chipped.

Ditto can also take advantage of entry hazard setters and removers, such as Ferrothorn, Kleavor, and Zapdos, using their own longevity or utility against them.

Mega Lopunny is a staple on Normal teams that accents Ditto's role expertly; many of the offensive threats and setup sweepers that revenge kill Mega Lopunny, such as Mega Charizard X, Kommo-o, and Galarian Moltres, are usually very weak to their own sets or coverage. Mega Lopunny can lure a threat in and pivot with U-turn, allowing Ditto to come in safely and transform. Ditto appreciates Mega Lopunny's Speed tier and fast pivot with U-turn, as well as potentially setting up Ditto with Encore Sets to stop foes from using Substitute or setting up completely. Hisuian Zoroark makes for another stellar teammate for Ditto, as Hisuian Zoroark disguised as a passive Pokemon, such as Blissey, or another offensive threat, such as Diggersby or Mega Lopunny, can lead to Hisuian Zoroark wallbreaking and netting KOs on vital foes, making it easier for Ditto to sweep once it has transformed. While Ditto is immune to Sticky Web, it is susceptible to other hazards such as Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, so forms of hazard control such as Staraptor or Cyclizar are appreciated. Staraptor is another defensive option, while Cyclizar can enable Ditto to utilize Transform with a Substitute from Shed Tail. Smeargle on more offense-oriented teams' pairs well with Ditto, as Smeargle can set hazards with Stone Axe or Ceaseless Edge and spread status with Nuzzle, Mortal Spin, or Spore, allowing Ditto to exploit the opposing team easier. Smeargle will usually give up Sticky Web when paired with Ditto so as to not hinder Ditto's revenge killing prowess.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Zapdos's excellent typing and gargantuan stats make it one of the most consistent offensive Pokemon in the metagame. Its typing is amazing offensively, making it an Electric-type that can threaten Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Its great defensive stats let it take hits from the likes of Zamazenta and Gholdengo in a pinch. Roost further boosts this defensive capability, giving Zapdos longevity. Volt Switch is essential for maintaining offensive momentum against Pokemon that Zapdos otherwise struggles with such as Galarian Slowking. Heat Wave heavily pressures Steel-types such as Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Iron Treads. Tera Electric further boosts Zapdos's Thunderbolt's power, notably giving it odds to 2HKO pivot Galarian Slowking and Zamazenta. Alternatively, Tera Steel gives Zapdos extra defensive utility, letting it take Fairy-type attacks and more easily fish for paralysis from Static, while the Poison immunity lets Zapdos more easily switch into Pokemon like Toxapex.</p> <p>Offensive Zapdos fits best on offense and bulky offense teams looking for a consistent, strong special attacker. Entry hazards from the likes of Great Tusk, Heatran, and Garganacl are heavily appreciated by Zapdos, as the chip damage is essential in helping Zapdos overwhelm common checks to it such as Landorus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Iron Treads. Garganacl also appreciates Zapdos being able to switch in on Ground- and Fighting-type moves from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Landorus-T. Thanks to STAB Thunder and Hurricane, Zapdos is a natural fit on rain teams to threaten out bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo that rain otherwise struggles with. Pelipper also doubles as a slow pivot, letting Zapdos come in without taking any damage. Other offensive Pokemon like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit heavily appreciate Zapdos's pivoting and ability to threaten common bulky Pokemon like Great Tusk and Toxapex. Dragapult, in particular, can form a potent VoltTurn core with Zapdos, hitting specially defensive Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire for solid damage while appreciating Zapdos forcing out Pokemon like Toxapex and Corviknight. Gholdengo is another excellent offensive teammate, being able to deal with Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire that Zapdos otherwise struggles with.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Zapdos is one of the best defensive pivots in the metagame due to its bulk and typing, which allow it to check and force out threats such as Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Hisuian Samurott. Additionally, its excellent offensive presence lets it generate momentum for its team with Volt Switch, which is quite difficult to block due to Zapdos's ability to nail Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T with a powerful Hurricane. Heat Wave 2HKOes Iron Treads, which otherwise blocks Volt Swich with impunity, and it pressures other Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo. Discharge is an option over Volt Switch or Heat Wave as an Electric-type attack that doesn't force Zapdos out, allowing it to fish for paralysis against Pokemon such as Heatran and Dragonite. Zapdos can also opt to use U-turn alongside Discharge for unblockable pivoting, which is particularly useful against Ground-types that don't fear Hurricane such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire, but it usually prefers the power and role compression of Volt Switch. Thunder Wave is another option that reliably paralyzes opposing Pokemon but makes Zapdos significantly more passive. The given EV spread allows Zapdos to outspeed Great Tusk. A more defensive spread of 248 HP / 240 Def / 20 Spe with a Bold nature sacrifices Zapdos's ability to outspeed key threats, such as Great Tusk and Gholdengo, but makes it a much more formidable wall; for example, this spread avoids the 2HKO from Great Tusk's Ice Spinner and is likely to avoid the OHKO from +2 Sneasler's Gunk Shot. Static is the preferred ability to punish physical attackers such as Great Tusk and Sneasler; however, Pressure can be used to allow Zapdos stall out low-PP moves such as Great Tusk's Close Combat, Dragapult's Draco Meteor, and Heatran's Magma Storm. Tera Steel helps Zapdos check many common sweepers in a pinch, most notably letting it take Fairy-, Ice-, and Poison-type attacks from Iron Valiant, Enamorus, Alolan Ninetales, and Sneasler. Tera Fairy is another strong option that improves Zapdos's matchup against dangerous Dark- and Dragon-types, such as Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, Dragapult, and Walking Wake, while maintaining its Fighting-type resistance.</p> <p>Zapdos is an excellent fit on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to keep dangerous sweepers in check and pivot powerful offensive threats into play. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Hisuian Samurott can make it much harder for Pokemon such as Heatran and Ting-Lu to continuously check Zapdos. Great Tusk is a particularly good partner that can also threaten Zapdos's switch-ins, such as Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Slowking, and remove Stealth Rock if Zapdos loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. Gholdengo handles offensive threats that may overwhelm Zapdos, such as Sneasler and Iron Valiant, while Zapdos covers it against Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. Setup sweepers such as Kingambit and Iron Valiant can make great use of Zapdos's ability to generate free turns by pivoting them into play and spreading paralysis; Kingambit especially has brilliant synergy with Zapdos, taking on Galarian Slowking, Garganacl, and Clodsire, while Zapdos handles Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Dondozo. Similarly, Zapdos can provide free entry for powerful wallbreakers such as Volcanion, Hoopa-U, Dragapult, and Heatran.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Zapdos is a potent wallbreaker for Electric teams, being able to threaten Pokemon that give its teammates a hard time such as Great Tusk, Gastrodon, specially defensive Iron Treads, and Landorus-T. Aside from that, its Flying typing provides Electric teams an immunity to Ground and a resistance to Fighting. Hurricane is Zapdos's strongest STAB move, being able to OHKO Sableye, Amoonguss, and possibly Quagsire, and also being able to 2HKO physically defensive Skeledirge and Ursaluna. Zapdos can also take advantage of matchups against rain teams by being able to spam Hurricane without fear of missing. Volt Switch allows Zapdos to bring in teammates safely against special walls like Assault Vest Iron Hands, Assault Vest Galarian Slowking, and Heatran. Heat Wave provides Zapdos great coverage, allowing it to 2HKO Magnezone, as well as Klefki under Light Screen and Iron Treads. Static has a chance to paralyze Pokemon that make contact with Zapdos such as Dragonite and Mimikyu.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks makes for a great partner, being able to provide entry hazard support with both Stealth Rock and Spikes, as well as being able to threaten Heatran with Earth Power. Regieleki is another great partner, as it is able to remove hazards with Rapid Spin so that Zapdos can switch in more often without losing a good amount of its health to Stealth Rock. It is also able to outspeed Pokemon that outspeed Zapdos such as Flutter Mane and non-Choice Scarf Greninja. Pokemon with great special bulk such as Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Tyranitar can be tough for Zapdos, with the latter being able to threaten it with Stone Edge. Hence, Iron Hands pairs well with Zapdos, as it is able to threaten Galarian Slowking with Earthquake and Tyranitar with Drain Punch. In return, Zapdos can switch into anticipated Ground-type attacks from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Magnezone is another great partner, being able to threaten Hatterene and Flutter Mane, as well as potentially winning the Chien-Pao matchup. Lastly, Zapdos's wallbreaking opens up sweeping opportunities for fast sweepers such as Nasty Plot Rotom-W and Choice Scarf Pawmot. Both of them can beat Landorus-T with Hydro Pump and Ice Punch, respectively, and Pawmot has the added merit of potentially reviving Zapdos with Revival Blessing.</p> "

Volt Switch wears down common switch-ins such as Blissey, Heatran, Rotom-W, and Mega Tyranitar, bringing in teammates that punish them like Zamazenta and Kartana. Alternatively, Defog can clear away entry hazards set by Landorus-T and Great Tusk, though Zapdos sets lacking Heavy-Duty Boots struggle to reliably remove hazards. It also misses out on pivoting provided by Volt Switch. Static punishes contact attackers and pivots like Zamazenta, Tornadus-T, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lopunny. If not running Flyinium Z, Tera Flying lets Zapdos break past Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon with relative ease, all while still threatening Pokemon like Annihilape. Flyinium Z allows Zapdos to muscle through the likes of Annihilape and Gastrodon. The given EV spread allows Zapdos to OHKO Annihilape with Supersonic Skystrike. Teammates like Kingambit, Heatran, and Mega Lopunny appreciate Zapdos putting pressure on their checks, as it threatens Pokemon like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Toxapex. Without Heavy-Duty Boots, Zapdos is very susceptible to Stealth Rock. As such, entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Rotom-W are much appreciated. Wallbreakers like Urshifu-R and Garchomp help deal with Zapdos checks such as Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Mega Scizor is a notable partner for Zapdos, as it checks strong, offensive threats such as Mega Diancie and Mega Lopunny, absorbs poison for Zapdos, and forms a good pivoting core with it.</p> "

Roost allows it to stay healthy throughout the game and consistently be able to check Grass-types like Kartana. Tera Flying allows Zapdos to break through Ferrothorn and Gastrodon after slight chip damage. The given EVs allow Zapdos to outspeed Great Tusk while also maximizing its offensive power to break foes such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon. Pelipper is a mandatory partner for Zapdos, as it sets up rain and can safely pivot out to it. Ferrothorn checks foes such as Weavile and Mega Tyranitar while also setting entry hazards to weaken foes such as Heatran and opposing Ferrothorn. Additionally, Swift Swim Pokemon like Mega Swampert, Floatzel, and Barraskewda can help with Clodsire and Mega Tyranitar, which Zapdos struggles to break through.

Zapdos effectively switches into physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, Kartana, and Great Tusk, discouraging them from attacking by threatening a chance of paralysis. Zapdos can Volt Switch out as it pleases because of common Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and the aforementioned Great Tusk fearing its powerful Hurricane. Hidden Power Ice can be used to threaten Ground-types like the aforementioned Landorus-T and Garchomp while additionally hitting Gliscor harder and much more reliably than Hurricane. Carrying Heat Wave is recommended with Hidden Power Ice to maintain the ability to OHKO Kartana. These positive matchups into many Ground-types allow Zapdos to serve as a solid Defog user, but it struggles to beat bulkier Stealth Rock users such as Heatran, Mega Tyranitar, and Clodsire. Alternatively, Zapdos can forgo Defog for Heat Wave, allowing it to threaten Pokemon such as Kingambit, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Gholdengo. Tera Steel is utilized by Zapdos to flip its Rock- and Ice-type weaknesses versus Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar, Weavile, and Mega Diancie as well as check Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele in a pinch. However, it becomes weak to common Ground- and Fighting-type moves from Pokemon it wants to check. Teammates that appreciate the spread of paralysis, such as Mega Medicham, Urshifu-R, and Weavile, naturally pair well with Zapdos. Mega Medicham particularly pairs nicely with it, as Mega Medicham threatens Clodsire while enjoying Zapdos pivoting it into favorable matchups such as Heatran, with Zapdos punishing Tornadus-T and Mega Lopunny looking to revenge kill Mega Medicham in return. Pursuit users like Kingambit and the aforementioned Weavile are useful teammates to assist in chipping down Clodsire as well as punishing Dragapult.

It is a defogger that can threaten Gholdengo; a check to common Stealth Rock setters like Great Tusk, Heatran, and Garchomp; and a deterrent to contact attackers like U-turn users, Kartana, and Mega Lopunny. However, its main weakness lies in its overreliance on its Heavy-Duty Boots—although Tera could let it drop its weakness to Rock, Tera is usually better spent on other Pokemon, so Moltres still fears Knock Off from opponents it would otherwise check, like Iron Valiant, Landorus-T, Kartana, and Mega Scizor. Tera Water is used to ease the matchup against rain, becoming a check to common rain abusers like Basculegion-M, Mega Swampert and Barraskewda and threatening to burn them with Flame Body. Tera Ground instead grants a resistance to Stealth Rock and Stone Edge from Choice Scarf Landorus-T and an immunity to Volt Switch from Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W and Thunderbolt from Iron Valiant. Mystical Fire is chosen over Flamethrower, as its Special Attack drop is useful to more easily check Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Charizard Y, and Gholdengo. Scorching Sands is used to beat Heatran and also deter physical attackers looking to set up due to its high burn chance. Hurricane allows Moltres to OHKO Great Tusk and Mega Lopunny while heavily denting Volcarona and is useful in general as a powerful STAB option, U-turn allows Moltres to function as a pivot, pivoting out on foes like Heatran and Garganacl, and Toxic allows Moltres to punish Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp looking to soak up its STAB options. The given EVs allow Moltres to survive two Frustration from Mega Lopunny without Stealth Rock damage. However, there are still many opponents that can pressure Moltres, like Garganacl, Toxapex, and Tapu Koko. Moltres thus pairs well with wallbreakers that can take advantage of such switch-ins to come in, like Tapu Lele or Iron Valiant. Moltres also dislikes having its Heavy-Duty Boots removed, so teammates that can absorb Knock Off are appreciated, including Mega Scizor and Gliscor.</p> "

After one Nasty Plot boost, it can 2HKO the likes of Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Curse Garganacl, and after one Agility boost, it can outspeed would-be faster Pokemon such as +1 Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and +1 Walking Wake. Tera Blast Fairy lets it OHKO the likes of Baxcalibur and Hoopa-U while also being able to net 2HKOs on Kingambit, Assault Vest Hoopa-U, and Dragonite, all after one Nasty Plot boost. Tera Fairy also maintains its Dark resistance while letting it potentially set up in the face of Dragon-type attacks from foes like Dragapult and Baxcalibur. Alternatively, Hurricane is a strong neutral STAB move that prevents Galarian Moltres form relying too much on Terastallization to function. Tera Dark boosts Fiery Wrath's power, being able to OHKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowking after a Nasty Plot boost and Stealth Rock damage, as well as being able to 2HKO specially defensive Moltres and Assault Vest Toxapex after a Nasty Plot boost. It also removes Galarian Moltres's Ice weakness, allowing it to avoid the OHKO from Baxcalibur’s +1 Icicle Crash and the 2HKO from its +1 Ice Shard. Tera Flying is only to be used if running Hurricane, which can OHKO Zamazenta without a Nasty Plot boost, as well as non-Assault Vest Azumarill and Enamorus after a Nasty Plot boost. Sitrus Berry lets it set up much more easily, and can potentially let it trigger Berserk twice. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to ignore Stealth Rock. Finally, Weakness Policy is a viable alternative if running dual screens support to take on super effective hits more comfortably. Because of its reliance on setup, Galarian Moltres is best utilized on hyper offense teams. Hence, it appreciates entry hazard support from suicide leads such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Meowscarada so that incoming foes can be worn down for Galarian Moltres to clean. Dual screens from Dragapult lets it setup much more easily, esepcially for Weakness Policy variants. Hazard control is a must when running Galarian Moltres due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, so it appreciates partners such as Great Tusk and Hatterene with their access to Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce. The two of them can also threaten special walls that can hinder a Galarian Moltres sweep, with Great Tusk being able to OHKO Galarian Slowking and 2HKO Ting-Lu, while Hatterene can 2HKO Clodsire. In return, Galarian Moltres can set up on and threaten Zamazenta for Great Tusk and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo as well as special walls like Garganacl prevent Galarian Moltres from performing its sweep. Hence, offensive Zapdos pairs well with Galarian Moltres, being able to 2HKO both of the aforementioned Pokemon, provided Garganacl is Tera Water. Lastly, Galarian Moltres can facilitate sweeps from physically oriented sweepers like Kingambit and Baxcalibur by removing obstacles like Great Tusk and Gholdengo.</p> "

Agility allows Galarian Moltres to outpace dangerous revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Choice Scarf Kartana. However, Taunt is also a valuable alternative to Agility in order to shut down defensive checks like Haze Toxapex and Unaware Clodsire while also preventing common status spreaders like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran from limiting its sweep. Heavy-Duty Boots negates chip damage from entry hazards and allows Galarian Moltres to set up more reliably. Flyinium Z is used in order to quickly eliminate bulkier threats such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn without risking a miss due to Hurricane's poor accuracy; however, this leaves Galarian Moltres unable to Terastallize against threats such as Tapu Lele. Sitrus Berry is another option that lets Galarian Moltres maintain its health and trigger Berserk twice. Galarian Moltres is a great user of Terastallization, using Tera Steel to set up on its standard checks in Tapu Lele, Toxapex, Tapu Koko, and Clefable. Tera Steel also lets it resist many forms of priority including, but not limited to, Mega Lopunny's and Mega Medicham's Fake Out, Weavile's Ice Shard, and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. However, Galarian Moltres's new weaknesses mean that it has a harder time setting up on Mega Lopunny, Heatran, and Landorus-T while also being susceptible to other forms of priority like Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Galarian Moltres enjoys dual screens support to let it set up incredibly easily, so Tapu Koko makes for a great partner as both a solid pivot and dual screens setter. Galarian Moltres can struggle against threats such as Mega Diancie, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Mega Tyranitar, so Mega Scizor and Hawlucha make for great partners to handle its checks offensively; in return, Galarian Moltres can break through Pokemon such as Toxapex, Landorus-T, and Gholdengo for them. Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta are also good partners that can check threats like Heatran, Kingambit, and Garganacl for Galarian Moltres. Iron Valiant, in particular, also synergizes well with dual screens Tapu Koko, making it a fantastic cleaner after Galarian Moltres has broken through the opposing team.</p> "

After one Nasty Plot boost, Galarian Moltres 2HKOes physically defensive Toxapex, physically defensive Ting-Lu, and Celesteela.

With Flyinium Z , a Nasty Plot-boosted Supersonic Skystrike OHKOes Mega Diancie, Tapu Koko, and specially defensive Toxapex. An unboosted Supersonic Skystrike is still able to OHKO Terrakion after Stealth Rock damage. Hisuian Samurott provides entry hazard support in order to wear down incoming foes into OHKO range for Galarian Moltres, and in return, Galarian Moltres can threaten the Grass- and Fighting-types the two of them struggle with such as Mega Venusaur and Urshifu-R. Grimmsnarl is another great teammate, as it is able to set up dual screens to further make Galarian Moltres difficult to KO, and it can also run Taunt to prevent Stealth Rock from being set.

Lastly, Galarian Moltres can be paired with other sweepers such as Swords Dance Weavile and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon to soften each other's checks to enable each other to sweep. For example, Weavile is able to threaten Ting-Lu and Clodsire, while Galarian Moltres is able to handle Choice Scarf Gholdengo in return.

Extreme Speed is an excellent move for any physical sweeper, due to its high power and initiative over other priority users such as Kingambit. Earthquake provides coverage against bulky foes such as Toxapex, Garganacl, and Clodsire. Fire Punch OHKOes Scizor and 2HKOes physically defensive Corviknight after a Dragon Dance and Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Ice Spinner hits opposing Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Dragapult super effectively, notably OHKOing Dragapult after a Dragon Dance. Heavy-Duty Boots + Roost improves Dragonite's longevity and possibly enables it to retain Multiscale and obtain multiple boosts; preserving Multiscale is particularly useful for surviving Draco Meteor from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult. Encore can be used to provide setup opportunities and eventually overwhelm bulky Pokemon like Corviknight, Bulk Up Great Tusk, and Curse Garganacl. Tera Normal turns Extreme Speed into an incredibly powerful STAB priority move capable of shredding offensive teams after a single boost, and a timely typing change also removes Dragonite's weaknesses to Ice, Fairy, and Dragon, which can buy a free turn to set up. An Adamant nature is preferred since it maximizes the power of Extreme Speed, which often makes makes Speed stats irrelevant, but a Jolly nature can also be used to outspeed the Normal-immune Dragapult after a Dragon Dance, which is especially useful if Dragonite is running Ice Spinner.</p> <p>Offensive Dragon Dance Dragonite regularly serves as a potent win con on offensive teams that can also act as a revenge killer against fast and frail threats. Multiscale Dragonite's considerable bulk, as well as Ghost immunity with Tera Normal provides significant defensive utility for offensive teams. In particular, teams using frail offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant appreciate the defensive utility Dragonite brings. In return, these Pokemon can help wallbreak for a late-game Dragonite sweep. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, and Garchomp is appreciated to weaken Pokemon such as Iron Valiant into range of boosted Extreme Speed. Dual screens support from Grimmsnarl is a potential option that can supplement Dragonite's already great bulk and virtually guarantee the ability to acquire multiple boosts. Since Dragonite struggles against bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo and Skeledirge, a teammate that can switch into and check these Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, is appreciated.

It can set up on common Pokemon such as Great Tusk lacking Bulk Up or Ice Spinner, and even super effective attacks from Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult thanks to Multiscale. Extreme Speed alongside Tera Normal lets Dragonite clean up late-game, OHKOing faster threats like Meowscarada and potentially Cinderace at +1. It also outprioritizes Meowscarada's Sucker Punch as well as Grimmsnarl's Prankster-boosted Reflect and Thunder Wave.

Unaware users like Dondozo and Skeledirge may switch into Dragonite expecting a Dragon Dance variant but take massive damage from a Choice Band-boosted attack instead. Outrage is an extremely powerful STAB move capable of 2HKOing virtually any Pokemon that does not resist it, which even includes physically defensive walls like Great Tusk and Dondozo. It can also OHKO opposing Dragonite, even with Multiscale intact. Breaking walls is not the only role Dragonite fulfills, as Extreme Speed is a strong priority move that allows it to revenge kill threats like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon with some prior chip damage, or clean up late-game. Earthquake provides strong coverage, hitting grounded Steel-types like Gholdengo and Kingambit that resist Outrage and Extreme Speed. It's also Dragonite's strongest attack against walls like Garganacl, Toxapex, and Skeledirge to avoid locking it into Outrage. There are a couple of different options for the last moveslot. Fire Punch provides coverage for Corviknight and Tera Steel Rotom-W. Iron Head deals significant damage to Fairy-types like Hatterene and Scream Tail, as well as Tera Fairy users like Garganacl and Skeledirge. Thunder Punch is Dragonite's best option for dealing with Azumarill while also providing coverage for Corviknight. Ice Spinner is another option to hurt the likes of Great Tusk, Garchomp, and opposing Dragonite without locking into Outrage. It also ends Psychic Terrain, which allows Dragonite to use Extreme Speed against grounded Pokemon later on. Multiscale allows Dragonite to take even super effective hits from offensive Pokemon like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Choice Specs Dragapult and KO them back. Tera Normal makes Extreme Speed even more powerful, OHKOing offensive Volcarona and Iron Moth, and removes Dragonite's usual weaknesses to attacks like Iron Valiant's Moonblast, which can be useful for revenge killing and cleaning.</p> <p>Choice Band Dragonite fits best on mostly offensive teams where it can break holes in the opposing team for its teammates to take advantage of and where its strong priority may be needed against other offensive teams. However, while Choice Band Dragonite is very powerful, it also requires a lot of support. As it is vulnerable to Stealth Rock, not only because Dragonite is weak to it but also because it negates Multiscale, strong entry hazard control is important. This can be in the form of entry hazard removal, such as Rapid Spin Great Tusk, but also in the form of entry hazard prevention, such as Hatterene and Taunt users like Meowscarada and Greninja. Knock Off users like Great Tusk and Meowscarada can remove Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from walls like opposing Great Tusk and Corviknight, which makes them easier to break for Dragonite and keeps Multiscale intact. Switching Dragonite directly into attacks should generally be avoided, since keeping Multiscale intact is desirable, so it appreciates teammates that can bring it in safely. Examples include pivot move users, such as Cinderace, Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Slowking, as well as Eject Button or Eject Pack users, such as Eject Button Hatterene, Eject Pack Great Tusk, and Eject Pack Gholdengo. Physical attackers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon appreciate Dragonite weakening or removing checks like Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Dondozo. On the other hand, special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth can lure in checks like Clodsire and Slowking for Dragonite to punish. Iron Moth has the additional benefit of helping with Dragonite's fourth moveslot issue, as it can threaten Steel-types like Corviknight for Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Fairy-types like Hatterene for Dragonite lacking Iron Head.</p> "

Iron Head can be used to deal with Fairy-types such as Hatterene, while Waterfall can be used in rain archetypes to deal with types such as Ground.</p> <p>Corviknight can deal with Ice-type Pokemon like Chien-Pao with Iron Head and can pivot with U-turn. Kilowattrel can also pivot Dragonite in with Volt Switch and can help it deal with physical walls like Dondozo and Iron Defense Corviknight. Choice Specs Iron Jugulis is also a great partner that appreciates Dragonite dealing with special walls such as Clodsire, Slowking, and Dragalge, while Iron Jugulis deals with phyisical walls such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. Bombirdier can provide entry hazard support with Stealth Rock and prevent foes such as Ting-Lu from setting up their own hazards with Taunt while also offering extra pivoting with Parting Shot to help Dragonite find more occasions to wallbreak. Gyarados is another teammate that can deal with some Ice-types such as Chien-Pao, but the lack of recovery can wear it down very quickly. In exchange, Dragonite can weaken down foes such as Toxapex and Amoonguss to potentially allow Gyarados to clean up teams with Dragon Dance.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Thanks to the sheer power of Tera Normal Extreme Speed, Dragonite is one of DOU’s biggest threats, threatening to KO a large portion of the metagame. Dragonite also has excellent coverage, allowing it to hit any Pokémon that aren't afraid of Extreme Speed, such as Gholdengo and Iron Treads. Dragonite’s Dragon/Flying allows it to take attacks such as Chi-Yu's Heat Wave and Palafin's Jet Punch while also granting it immunity to Earthquakes from Garchomp and Great Tusk. Tera Normal also allows it to survive threatening Dragon- and Ice-type attacks. Inner Focus lets Dragonite avoid Attack drops from Intimidate and flinches Fake Out. Dragonite is most commonly paired with Chien-Pao, as Sword of Ruin lowers the Defense of foes, allowing Extreme Speed to deal more damage. This pairing is preferred by offensive teams but can fit on other archetypes appreciate Dragonite's power and priority. Due to Dragonite's heavy dependence on Extreme Speed, Pokemon that can block priority moves such as Farigiraf, Tsareena, and Indeedee-F limit its effectiveness. Dragonite also struggles against Pokémon with high physical bulk that can take an Extreme Speed and threaten it in return such as Great Tusk, Iron Hands, Amoonguss, and Garganacl. Additionally, Dragonite is greatly hindered by Stealth Rock, which nullifies Multiscale and limits its longevity.</p> ",

Ting-Lu and Garchomp stand out for being particularly bulky options that can even set up Spikes, but other options include Annihilape, Clodsire, Landorus-T, and Kleavor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Iron Head: Earthquake is the most wide-reaching coverage move, ensuring good damage against Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra. Iron Head is worth considering as it prevents Dragonite from being walled by Tera Fairy Rotom-W and has good damage output against Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute versus Encore: Substitute is a fantastic option against Pokemon with status moves that threaten Dragonite's phazing cycles, such as Garganacl, Wo-Chien, and Clodsire. Encore won't do as well against these threats but does punish opposing foes carrying Substitute that can be a problem for Dragon Tail along with slower foes that use status moves in general such as Dondozo and Ursaluna. Encore can even be used over extra coverage if teammates can deal with Fairy-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Extreme Speed versus Aqua Jet: Extreme Speed's ability to pick off threats is useful, even on defensive variants of this set.

The boost to Aqua Jet can also be helpful for picking off threats, though it won't be as powerful as Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal isn't that incredible defensively, but it can be worth it for boosting Extreme Speed's power, letting offensive EV spreads 2HKO Chien-Pao with it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a niche option that lets Dragonite absorb Toxic Spikes and gain a Toxic immunity without being weak to Fighting- and Fire-type attacks like Tera Steel is.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is a high value item, but it's worth using on Dragonite if using Substitute, as it gives Dragonite a serious chance of passively gaining Multiscale's effect back.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet allows Dragonite to play more passively, punishing Pokemon that rely on contact moves like Choice Item Urshifu-R and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots' Stealth Rock immunity makes Multiscale more flexible, especially if Dragon Tail brings in a threat Dragonite isn't equipped to handle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: With Dragonite often moving last with Dragon Tail, it's especially vulnerable to Spore from Breloom, Amoonguss, and Brute Bonnet, so Safety Goggles can be a good pick if Substitute isn't a good fit.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 Def / 100 Spe with Impish: This spread outspeeds Jolly Ursaluna, who while not common, can seriously threaten to blast past Dragonite with Facade.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 Def / 180 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread gives up quite a bit of bulk in exchange for outspeeding Adamant Breloom, while still often mantaining a Substitute against Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 124 Atk / 108 Def / 4 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is optimized for use with Earthquake and Aqua Jet, allowing Dragonite to 2HKO 4 Defense Flutter Mane with that combination of moves without needing to Terastallize.

Trapping an Encore locked Pokemon in the field is also highly valuable. Fire Spin is used instead of Wrap because it affects Ghost-types and doesn't trigger chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Waterfall</strong>: Earthquake prevents Dragonite from being entirely passive against Heatran, Flutter Mane, and Clodsire.

Air Slash also does not trigger Rocky Helmet and is naturally boosted by Dragonite's STAB. The Iron Head variant of Paraflinch, however, gives Dragonite an easier time against a number of common threats such as Flutter Mane, at the cost of only defeating Heatran that are Terastallized.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore vs. Substitute: Encore will allow Dragonite to effectively check a wider variety of Pokemon such as Ursaluna by locking them into an unfavorable move, giving it a free opportunity to land Thunder Wave on your opponent's switch-in on the following turn.

Earthquake helps Dragonite eliminate Normal-resistant Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Heatran. Roost improves Dragonite's longevity and enables it to acquire multiple boosts against passive opponents. Roost lets Dragonite check Volcarona and rain sweepers such as Barraskewda throughout the entire match. Ice Spinner is another choice that clears the priority-blocking Psychic Terrain and hits Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Dragapult super effectively. Fire Punch can be used to hit bulky Steel-types not weak to Ground such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. An Adamant nature is usually preferred to maximize Extreme Speed's damage output, but a Jolly nature enables Dragonite to outspeed Tapu Koko and the Normal-immune Dragapult after a single Dragon Dance. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures that Dragonite will always retain Multiscale even if entry hazards are up, but if the team's entry hazard control is good, Silk Scarf is another option that boosts Extreme Speed's power. Dragonite fits well on offensive teams as a priority-using revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk and Garchomp can help chip down bulky targets such as opposing Great Tusk into range of its attacks. Tapu Lele poses a serious threat to Dragonite, as not only does its Psychic Terrain block Extreme Speed on grounded targets, but with a Choice Scarf it can also outspeed and deal massive damage to Dragonite even after setup, especially if Dragonite has not Terastallized yet. Gholdengo is a good partner, as it can switch in on and threaten Tapu Lele and prevent the opponent from removing entry hazards. Dragonite often struggles against Unaware users such as Dondozo and Skeledirge, so Pokemon that can grab momentum against them are appreciated teammates. Rotom-W and Tapu Koko can come relatively freely on Dondozo and threaten it with a Volt Switch while Heatran and Mega Diancie can switch into and set up Stealth Rock against Skeledirge. Strong wallbreakers like Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, and Zamazenta all take advantage of Pokemon that Dragonite tends to struggle with, such as Dondozo, allowing it to sweep more easily late-game.</p> "

Liquidation and Play Rough serve as Azumarill's primary STAB attacks, possessing fantastic neutral coverage and hitting many threats such as Dragonite, Walking Wake, and Iron Valiant for super effective damage.

Ice Spinner is a powerful coverage option, 2HKOing many of Azumarill's common switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Water Absorb Clodsire. Ice Spinner's ability to remove Terrain also makes it particularly useful against opposing Psychic Terrain teams. Tera Water increases the power of Azumarill's Water-type STAB moves, letting it pick off foes such as Iron Moth from higher ranges with Aqua Jet and allowing its Liquidation to 2HKO Hatterene and OHKO offensive Great Tusk.

Partners at risk of being revenge killed by Walking Wake and Iron Valiant, such as Great Tusk and Hydreigon, will greatly appreciate Azumarill's ability to act as a buffer against these Pokemon. Despite Azumarill's good bulk, its tanking prowess can often be undermined by its vulnerability to passive damage from entry hazards and Rocky Helmet. Great Tusk is therefore an excellent partner, providing Rapid Spin support and being able to lure and remove Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Corviknight with Knock Off. Meowscarada is also an excellent ally, being able to shut down opposing entry hazard setters with Taunt while also providing Knock Off support. Furthermore, both Great Tusk and Meowscarada can support Azumarill by laying down entry hazards, which it will greatly appreciate given its ability to force switches. Ting-Lu can similarly lay down multiple layers of entry hazards and ease pressure exerted onto Azumarill in dealing with threats such as Dragapult and Iron Moth. Teammates that can bring Azumarill in safely with a pivoting move, such as Cinderace and Dragapult, are also recommended. Cinderace can assist Azumarill in dealing with entry hazards via Court Change, while Dragapult can deal with Orthworm, which may sometimes use Azumarill as an entry point to pass Shed Tail. In return, Azumarill can check key Pokemon such as Greninja that would threaten them. Azumarill greatly struggles against bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Water Garganacl. Hydreigon can exploit both Toxapex and Garganacl's passivity to set up with Substitute and Nasty Plot, though it must be wary of switching in against Toxic and Salt Cure. Breloom can pressure Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl with Bullet Seed, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo matches up quite nicely against Garganacl and opposing Breloom and can pivot into Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W.</p> "

Body Slam is also another option to significantly threaten Toxapex at +6 Attack while still being able to target the aforementioned Clodsire and Amoonguss for neutral damage. Trailblaze can be used to always beat Quagsire as well. 4 HP EVs are given to make Azumarill's HP an even number so when it activates Belly Drum from full HP, it can activate its Sitrus Berry immediately.</p> <p>One of Azumarill's best partners on Fairy teams is Klefki. Klefki sets up dual screens, which leads to Azumarill having an easier time setting up and sweeping. Klefki also sets Spikes for Azumarill, allowing Azumarill to secure KOs easier after a Belly Drum, particularly against Amoonguss and Toxapex after one layer of Spikes. Klefki also hinders Azumarill's offensive checks like Breloom with Thunder Wave. In return, Azumarill threatens opposing Fire- and Ground-types that threaten Klefki like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Azumarill forms a potent offensive core with Flutter Mane, which threatens the physical walls that may impede Azumarill's sweep like Unaware Quagsire and Toxapex, while Azumarill handles special walls like specially defensive Ting-Lu, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Blissey. Azumarill also appreciates Iron Valiant as an offensive partner, as special sets can answer physical walls like Dondozo and hinder Azumarill's checks like Toxapex by using Trick, and—like with Flutter Mane—Azumarill can deal considerable damage to threats like Clodsire and Gholdengo. Magic Bounce Hatterene also assists Azumarill, as it bounces back entry hazards—particularly Toxic Spikes—which limits Azumarill's sweeping capabilities. Hatterene also has a strong matchup into Ground, Poison, and Water teams; Azumarill appreciates the latter two, since Hatterene is able to threaten Pokemon like Amoonguss and Toxapex.</p> "

Toxic puts many notable Pokemon in the tier on a timer such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Quagsire ideally wants Spikes over Stealth Rock to force more chip damage on potential switch-ins; however, Stealth Rock is fine as an alternative if none of its other teammates can afford to fit it into their moveset. Alternatively, Ice Beam with a Relaxed nature allows Quagsire to 2HKO Hawlucha after Stealth Rock and lets it beat Substitute + Dragon Dance Tera Flying Tyranitars. The passive recovery of Leftovers allows Quagsire to check Choice Band Tyranitar and Mimikyu more easily; however, if the team can not fit entry hazard removal, Heavy-Duty Boots is much more appealing. Quagsire only uses Terastallization defensively to check certain dangerous offensive threats. Tera Poison grants Quagsire a perfectly accurate Toxic and a poison immunity while also allowing it to handle Grass-types and offensive threats that use Grass-type moves such as Tsareena, Trailblaze Scizor, and Seed Bomb Pawmot. Tera Ghost allows Quagsire to beat Maushold by becoming immune to Population Bomb as well as check Slither Wing and Lucario more easily. Tera Ghost also has the added benefit of letting Quagsire serve as a spinblocker against spinners such as Tsareena.</p> <p>Quagsire primarily fits on balance, stall, and bulky offense teams as a defensive glue that holds these teams together. Common teammates for Quagsire include Stealth Rock setters such as Tinkaton and Tyranitar, which can allow Quagsire to run Spikes. Both can check Gengar, special Salamence, and Iron Jugulis, which pose a threat to Quagsire. Tinkaton can also use Knock Off on Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Sticky Hold Gastrodon, Scream Tail, and Wo-Chien to rack up more damage from Quagsire's Spikes. Scream Tail is another Pokemon that complements Quagsire, as it is able to handle special Salamence as well as Gallade, while Quagsire is able to keep Bisharp and non-Trailblaze Scizor in check. Talonflame is another ideal partner for Quagsire as it can check Tsareena and Giga Drain variants of Wo-Chien. Blissey on stall teams is also a strong partner for Quagsire by virtue of walling almost every special attacker in the tier such as Iron Jugulis, Noivern, and Sandy Shocks.</p> "

Despite its great bulk, Umbreon's offenses are quite lackluster, though this can be somewhat alleviated by STAB Foul Play to punish setup sweepers attempting to exploit Umbreon's passivity, like Coil Eelektross and Bulk Up Ursaring. Setup sweepers that don't mind taking a Foul Play, like Calm Mind Dudunsparce and Quiver Dance Oricorio, can easily take advantage of it. Umbreon also dislikes the plethora of Fighting-types in the tier, like Toxicroak, Medicham, and Paldean Tauros.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Umbreon has a myriad of utility options at its disposal, including being able to set up with Calm Mind. Unfortunately, due to Umbreon's terrible Special Attack, a Calm Mind set typically requires too many boosts to be effective. Umbreon can fit two utility moves if it chooses to use Moonlight instead of Wish and Protect, but the limited PP can become a detriment in longer games. Umbreon can beat setup sweepers that typically take advantage of it, such as Quiver Dance Oricorio and Calm Mind Vaporeon, with Tera Ghost and Curse. Umbreon can also use Taunt and a few extra Speed EVs to stop setup sweepers like Sandaconda and Vaporeon or other support Pokemon like Vespiquen and Muk from using their own status moves. Lastly, Umbreon can trap an unsuspecting foe with Mean Look and wear it down with Foul Play or even drop its stats with Tickle to more easily take it out.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: NU has a plethora of Fighting-types, such as Crabominable, Medicham, and Sneasel-Hisui. Umbreon can Terastallize to reverse this weakness, but that always comes with a new set of weaknesses and removes the option to Terastallize later. Other Pokemon like Scyther and Zangoose have a powerful Close Combat that can threaten Umbreon as well.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Utility Moves: Regardless of Synchronize, a poisoned Umbreon, whether by Toxic or Toxic Spikes, is extremely impaired and struggles to fulfill its role. Trick from a Choice Scarf Haunter or Rotom can completely ruin Umbreon despite it being a suitable check to them otherwise. Taunt from Pokemon like Bombirdier, Qwilfish, and opposing Umbreon can limit Umbreon to only an exploitable Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Special Setup Sweepers: Setup sweepers that don't mind Foul Play, mainly special attackers like Oricorio, Vivillon, and a Terastallized Farigiraf can easily boost against Umbreon.</p> ",

Umbreon's immense bulk lets it spread status with Thunder Wave or Yawn to support its teammates, and Wish can keep teammates that lack reliable recovery such as Perrserker and Eelektross healthy. While Pokemon like Tera Ground Oricorio and Coil Eelektross are immune to Thunder Wave, Yawn can shut down their setup attempts nicely. Synchronize can deter or punish careless status moves used by the likes of Dudunsparce and Drifblim. Umbreon prefers a Poison or Fairy Tera type to turn the tables on Fighting-types and take U-turn better. Tera Poison also provides a Fairy resistance and an immunity to Toxic and Toxic Spikes from common users like Muk, Qwilfish, and Vespiquen.</p> <p>Umbreon appreciates Drifblim and Qwilfish for their Fighting resistance. Drifblim can remove entry hazards and take advantage of Umbreon's status moves with Hex, while Qwilfish can consistently punish Fighting-type moves and U-turn from Pokemon like Passimian and Scyther with Poison Point and Rocky Helmet.

Chilly Reception can also be used for cancelling the effects of opposing weather such as rain and sun while also enabling offensive Ice-types due to snow's Defense boost. Surf is its most reliable STAB move, being necessary to sucessfully check Iron Moth and Iron Valiant. Future Sight threatens more defensive teams when paired with physical wallbreakers such as Baxcalibur and Cinderace, as it threatens opposing defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Amoonguss. Thunder Wave can alternatively be run alongside Surf, preventing Slowking from being setup fodder for Volcarona and Dragonite. Slowking runs maximum Special Defense EVs in order to switch into a variety of other special attackers such as Walking Wake, Rotom-W, Volcarona, and Hatterene. It also lets Slowking make use of Chilly Reception and Thunder Wave for dynamic counterplay. The investment also gives Slowking more opportunities to safely pivot in front of Pokemon that aren't immediately threatening but can beat it long-term, such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, Hisuian Zoroark, and Choice Specs Dragapult. 0 Speed IVs in tandem with a Sassy nature maximize the odds of slow pivoting in front of foes, which is important to nearly guarantee safely bringing in other teammates. Slowking can utilize Tera Water to remove its Bug-, Ghost-, and Dark-type weaknesses, enhancing its matchup against Gholdengo, Dragapult, Greninja, and Volcarona while also allowing it to absorb U-turn better. Additionally, it also boosts Surf's damage output. Tera Fairy turns the tables on Dragapult and Greninja, allowing it to wall their Choice Specs sets reliably.</p> <p>Slowking fits on balance teams due to its exclusive access to Chilly Reception, as they can take advantage of both the snow and momentum generated by it. Slowking enjoys being paired with Pokemon that can generate momentum, such as Cinderace, Rotom-W, and Sandy Shocks. This helps its team to pivot around Garganacl to avoid being worn down by its Salt Cure. Slowking is naturally paired with physically defensive walls with good synergy, such as Great Tusk, Amoonguss, and Corviknight, which answer many of Slowking´s checks such as Kingambit, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Slowking is generally vulnerable to becoming fodder for Orthworm, since it can't paralyze targets through Orthworm´s passed Substitutes. As such, Pokemon like Infiltrator Dragapult and Unaware Pokemon like Skeledirge and Dondozo are logical Slowking teammates that fix this issue, with Unaware teammates in particular being crucial for answering setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Iron Valiant that are present on hyper offense teams. Dark-types like Kingambit can check and occasionally switch into special attackers that have an advantage against Slowking like Nasty Plot Gholdengo, Choice Specs Greninja, and Choice Specs Dragapult, creating good defensive synergy without lacking offensive capabilities.</p> "

Slowking's low Speed stat with 0 Speed IVs allows it to switch into a favorable teammate after pivoting.

Thunder Wave can be used in order to cripple Iron Moth and Roaring Moon that usually switch into Slowking and can pressure it. Intimidate is the preferred choice of ability, as it combines well with Slowking's ability to pivot, making it difficult to KO. Fluffy can be used as an alternative in order to deal with Roaring Moon better. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn users such as Cinderace and Quaquaval from freely pivoting against Slowking, while Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Slowking healthy.

Future Sight + Teleport or Chilly Reception lets Slowking support its frail offensive teammates such as Mega Lopunny and Dragapult, giving them safe switch ins and amplifying their wallbreaking prowess afterwards. Teleport is a much more reliable way of pivoting, as its higher PP makes it more valuable in longer games and it provides Slowking's teammates with a safe switch in against Ferrothorn and other Teleport users like Blissey and Slowbro. Alternatively, Chilly Reception's snow helps disrupt weather teams like sun and rain as well as support Ice-type teammates like Kyurem and Weavile with its Defense boost. Tera Fairy improves Slowking's matchup against Dragapult and Tapu Koko and maintains its Fighting resistance against Mega Lopunny, while Tera Dark lets it better stomach Ghost-type attacks from Gholdengo and Dragapult at the cost of being weaker against Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. Both Tera choices importantly prevent Slowking from being Pursuit trapped by Kingambit, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar. Wallbreakers like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, Great Tusk, and Kingambit appreciate Slowking's slow pivoting, with the looming Future Sight pressuring their switch-ins like Toxapex, Buzzwole, and defensive Great Tusk. Moreover, Slowking switches into their revenge killers, notably Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Ting-Lu, and Tangrowth cover foes like Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Kartana, respectively; Ferrothorn and Tangrowth also deal with rain wallbreakers like Mega Swampert and Barraskewda that would otherwise overwhelm Slowking despite its Water resistance, with the latter in particular forming a Regnerator core with Slowking.</p> "

Psychic can be used over Future Sight as a more consistent alternative, providing more immediate pressure against the likes of Zamazenta, Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Iron Moth. Flamethrower hits Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Corviknight that can otherwise snuff out Future Sight. Surf is key for hitting Pokemon like Landorus-T and Heatran, 2HKOing the former, while also hitting Great Tusk and Iron Moth without having to rely on Future Sight. Alternatively, Ice Beam wrecks Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Garchomp while also hitting the likes of Dragapult and Dragonite. Tera Fairy gives Galarian Slowking a generally good defensive typing, notably being immune to Dragon-type moves from the likes of Dragapult, Baxcalibur, and Walking Wake. Tera Flying turns Galarian Slowking’s weakness to Ground into an immunity while also making it resist U-turn, allowing it to switch into non-Ice Spinner Great Tusk most of the time. Tera Water lets Galarian Slowking snuff out Fire-types like Cinderace, Volcanion, and Heatran while also resisting Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Hisuian Samurott, Walking Wake, and Azumarill. Additionally, it boosts the power of Surf, letting it potentially OHKO Landorus-T and 2HKO Heatran. 120 Special Defense EVs let Galarian Slowking take two Shadow Balls from Choice Specs Dragapult at full health, while 16 Defense EVs ensure that it can survive two Psyshocks from Choice Specs Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock, which also means surviving Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge from full health. Ground-immune Pokemon such as Zapdos, Moltres, and Corviknight make for excellent teammates, as they can switch into Ground-type moves from the likes of Great Tusk and overwhelm them. Offensive Pokemon like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, Baxcalibur, and Enamorus heavily appreciate Future Sight being able to overwhelm Pokemon like Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Zamazenta. Galarian Slowking's reliance on Assault Vest to function against Pokemon like Dragapult, in addition to its weakness to Dark, leaves it heavily vulnerable to Knock Off from the likes of Iron Valiant and Meowscarada. As a result, Corviknight is a great partner, as it can take Knock Off and provide Defog support, helping maintain Galarian Slowking's longevity. The weakness to Dark leaves Galarian Slowking especially vulnerable to the likes of Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Roaring Moon.

Future Sight's delayed damage is incredibly difficult to deal with when Galarian Slowking is paired with strong wallbreakers, while Psychic is a fine alternative to immediately damage Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Sneasler. Chilly Reception allows Galarian Slowking to pivot out, with the added bonus of resetting opposing weather; its poor Speed alongside minimum investment ensures that its teammate can switch in safely. Thunder Wave cripples would-be checks like Heatran and Kingambit, and the speed control against fast threats like Dragapult and Cinderace can greatly aid its teammates. Surf has solid coverage alongside Galarian Slowking's STAB moves, hitting Heatran, Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Ursaluna for decent damage. Slack Off provides Galarian Slowking with reliable recovery, and—alongside Regenerator—can give it tremendous amount of staying power. Toxic can be considered over Thunder Wave to force progress against defensive threats like Skeledirge and Dondozo. Ice Beam can greatly pressure Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Dragapult with a single moveslot. Flamethrower punishes Kingambit and Gholdengo. Lastly, Grass Knot hits Tera Water Garganacl hard and can reliably 2HKO Dondozo. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Galarian Slowking to continuously pivot without having Regenerator's recovery nullified by entry hazards, while Shuca Berry allows it to either pivot into or directly retaliate against a Ground-type attack from Great Tusk, Landorus-T, or Enamorus. Colbur Berry allows Galarian Slowking to reliably check Knock Off Iron Valiant and Night Slash Sneasler, both of which can otherwise greatly threaten it. Both Tera Grass and Tera Water grant a resistance to Water-type attacks from Azumarill and Walking Wake. Moreover, Tera Grass turns its Ground weakness into a resistance, while Tera Water allows Galarian Slowking to sponge attacks from Heatran, Cinderace, and Iron Moth while powering up Surf. Tera Flying provides a crucial Ground immunity and U-Turn resistance while keeping Galarian Slowking's Fighting resistance, letting it reliably switch into Great Tusk variants that lack Ice Spinner. A Sassy nature with maximum Special Defense investment can be used to deal with Enamorus and Shadow Ball Iron Valiant more easily.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking fits on a wide assortment of balance and bulky offense teams, which greatly appreciate its ability to defensively support its teammates while providing significant offensive pressure itself. Powerful wallbreakers like Choice Band Zamazenta, Sneasler, and Ursaluna appreciate Galarian Slowking's ability to both pivot them in safely with Chilly Reception and pressure would-be defensive checks like Corviknight, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Dondozo with Future Sight, which forces them into 2HKO or even OHKO range against these wallbreakers. Dragon Dance Baxcalibur is a fantastic teammate, as the snow set by Chilly Reception improves its already-solid bulk and allows it to run Ice Body, giving it the opportunity to set up multiple Dragon Dances and devastate opposing offensive teams. Dragapult is a solid teammate, as it appreciates Galarian Slowking's ability to check Enamorus and Booster Energy Iron Valiant; in return, Dragapult can wallbreak or disrupt teams with its own status moves. Zapdos and Landorus-T have solid defensive synergy with Galarian Slowking thanks to their Ground immunity and ability to check physical attackers like Great Tusk while forming a VoltTurn core with it. Garganacl and Kingambit have good defensive synergy with Galarian Slowking, since they can sponge repeated Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult and Gholdengo while it can check threats like Enamorus and Fighting-types like Sneasler, Zamazenta, and some Iron Valiant sets in return. Kingambit in particular appreciates Galarian Slowking's Future Sight support and ability to pressure Fire-types.</p> "

It has a very strong type for this tier, with very few Pokemon able to hit it for super effective damage. It is also the best Rapid Spin blocker in PU because of this. Will-O-Wisp is great for crippling physical attackers like Lycanroc-N, Gabite, and Alolan Dugtrio. Choosing to run Thunder Wave over Will-O-Wisp can make dealing with Alolan Dugtrio and Gabite more difficult. With Misdreavus able to spread status so well, Hex is the best choice for its STAB move. Power Gem is quad effective against Articuno, Masquerain, and Charizard; it also hits other popular Pokemon like Houndoom, Pyroar, and Rotom-F for super effective damage. Thunderbolt can be opted for instead to better hit Water-types like Golduck, Lumineon, Basculin, and Quaxwell. Taunt is also an option over the two attacking moves to disallow setup sweepers such as Gogoat and Carbink from boosting in front of Misdreavus; it also works well at stopping entry hazard setters such as Carbink, Gabite, and Camerupt. The EV spread allows for better recovery with Pain Split by keeping Misdreavus's HP a bit lower than if 252 HP EVs were used while still keeping its overall bulk by adding the EVs taken from HP into both defensive stats. 56 Speed EVs let it out speed neutral natured Honchkrow and Flapple, as well as Timid Glimmet and uninvested Drakloak. Tera Fighting and Tera Fairy both work well to provide a resistance to Dark-type moves from Pokemon like Honchkrow and Alolan Persian. Although, Tera Fighting leaves Misdreavus vulnerable to Flying-type moves from Articuno, Charizard, and Masquerain and Psychic-type moves from Rabsca and Indeedee-F. On the other hand, Tera Fairy leaves it vulnerable to Steel-type moves from Perrserker and Alolan Dugtrio. Tera Electric is great for boosting Thunderbolt and giving Misdreavus zero weaknesses with its ability. Tera Rock boosts Power Gem, letting it OHKO Charizard and Masquerain.</p> <p>Misdreavus works well on balance teams looking for a catch-all defensive Pokemon to deal with many of the metagame's top threats. It also works great on entry hazard stacking teams since it is not bothered by the top Rapid Spin user, Quaxwell. Misdreavus thrives when given teammates like Carbink, Dachsbun, and Tinkatuff to deal with Dark-types such as Alolan Persian, Houndoom, and Skuntank. These same Dark-type threats, Alolan Persian, Houndoom, and Skuntank, can help deal with Ghost-type foes like Banette, Drakloak, and opposing Misdreavus. Specially defensive walls like Articuno, Carbink, and Tinkatuff form a nice core with Misdreavus since it can cover physical Pokemon that give them trouble, like Lycanroc-N, Perrserker, and Alolan Dugtrio. Knock Off absorbers and status absorbers are highly recommended to keep Misdreavus healthy enough to deal with all of these Pokemon. Status absorbers are the likes of RestTalk Gabite, Dragonair, and Zangoose, while Knock Off absorbers are usually Dark-types like Alolan Persian and Skuntank.</p> "

Tera Fairy is notable for preventing threats like Nasty Plot Alolan Persian from immediately threatening it, and its toolset lends it easy setup opportunities against Gabite, one of the best phazers in the metagame, as well as other passive targets like Dachsbun and Carbink. Alternatively, Nasty Plot can be used along with either Draining Kiss or Power Gem to make Misdreavus more immediately threatening, with Power Gem primarily targeting Fire-types like Pyroar and Houndoom that it would otherwise struggle with as well as specially defensive Articuno. Hex benefits greatly from Misdreavus's ability to spread status and can be amplified with additional status spreaders on the team; alternatively, Shadow Ball can be used on Nasty Plot sets for greater immediate damage output. Will-O-Wisp is useful for preventing targets like Skuntank and Honchkrow from revenge killing it before Terastallization as well as increasing its ability to take hits from Quaxwell. Thunder Wave is another option that cripples special walls like Articuno and opposing setup sweepers like Masquerain. Substitute can also be used as the last move to facilitate setup on forced switches and prevent Skuntank and Rotom-F from crippling it with Toxic or Trick, but it usually gets more value from spreading status. An alternative EV spread of 128 HP / 128 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature can be used on Calm Mind variants for easier setup and more reliable spinblocking.</p> <p>Misdreavus's effectiveness at spinblocking naturally makes it a great fit on entry hazard stacking teams alongside setters like Whiscash, Carbink, and Masquerain as well as strong wallbreakers like Basculin and Rotom-F. Ground-types like Whiscash and Gabite can reliably switch into offensive checks like Alolan Dugtrio and Houndoom as well as Pokemon that may cripple Misdreavus with Thunder Wave or Encore, such as Tinkatuff and Raichu. Carbink can reliably switch into and deal with Dark-types like Houndoom and Alolan Persian that Nasty Plot variants in particular struggle with greatly before Terastallization, and it can also absorb Knock Off. Gogoat can form an effective bulky setup core with Misdreavus, as they deal with each other's checks, like Basculin and Gabite, respectively, and they pressure mutual targets like Articuno and Carbink better together. Thunder Wave users like Alolan Persian and Tinkatuff can facilitate sweeping for Misdreavus by powering up its Hex; the former can also bring it in safely with Parting Shot and ease the pressure of handling Perrserker, and the latter can create setup opportunities with Encore. In addition, both of these can situationally switch into Knock Off from Pokemon like Banette and opposing Tinkatuff.</p> "

Qwilfish can wear down the opposition with its combination of Spikes and Toxic and even prevent Defog and recovery moves with Taunt. Waterfall is used over Liquidation to potentially cause flinching, which works wonders in conjunction with Toxic, although Surf can be used for a 2HKO on Sandaconda and more damage on other physically bulky Pokemon like Drifblim and Klawf. Despite Intimidate being such a high-value ability, Qwilfish typically prefers Poison Point to punish U-turn from the likes of Passimian and Scyther while not activating Passimian's Defiant in the process. Protect can be used with Leftovers for some extra recovery and also to scout moves from Choice item users like Rotom, Bruxish, and Zoroark. Upon scouting these Pokemon, Qwilfish can invert its weakness to Electric- or Psychic-type moves with a timely Terastallization to a respective Ground or Dark typing, letting it spread more poison and set more Spikes. Umbreon is a great defensive partner, sponging general special attacks while boasting an immunity to Psychic. In return, Qwilfish heavily punishes Fighting-type attacks and U-turn, while also resisting Fairy. Phasers like Dragon Tail Dudunsparce and Eelektross make great use of the Spikes Qwilfish sets up, racking up damage for a faster Pokemon to more easily sweep.

Intimidate is useful to weaken physical attackers, allowing it to tank strong neutral attacks from the likes of Ursaring and Tauros. Hisuian Qwilfish can also make use of Poison Point to punish contact moves, even generally commitment-free moves like Scyther's and Mesprit's U-turn. Barb Barrage is preferred over stronger options like Poison Jab and Gunk Shot thanks to its high chance to poison, as well as dealing double damage to a poisoned target. Taunt dismantles setup sweepers such as Eelektross while also preventing Defog. Haze is an option over Taunt to prevent setup sweepers like Tera Steel Mesprit and Eelektross from exploiting Hisuian Qwilfish's passivity. Toxic can also be run over Taunt to take advantage of Defog users removing your Spikes and cripple opposing walls like Appletun, Articuno, and Eelektross. Crunch is an extra STAB option that beats Ghost- and Psychic-types like Froslass, Rotom, and Bruxish. Alternatively, Crunch punishes teams that have no grounded Poison-type or entry hazard control. Tera Grass enables Hisuian Qwilfish to set more Spikes against Sandaconda and gives Hisuian Qwilfish a resistance to Volt Switch, allowing it to more easily beat Rotom and Eelektross. Alternatively, Tera Ghost lets it spinblock Cryogonal and Avalugg. 56 Speed EVs allow Hisuian Qwilfish to outspeed maximum Speed Cacturne as well as neutral-nature Abomasnow and Farigiraf; Jolly allows Hisuian Qwilfish to always outspeed the latter two.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Tauros and Mesprit benefit from Spikes weakening checks like Sandaconda and Hisuian Qwilfish that are somewhat easy to put in 2HKO range. To maximize the effect of Spikes and keep them up as long as possible, Hisuian Qwilfish appreciates help from Rotom, Cryogonal, and Articuno, which all put pressure onto Defog users like Braviary and Lurantis. Without Terastallizing, Hisuian Qwilfish folds to Sandaconda and other strong physical attackers that can switch into it like Toxicroak, Hisuian Sneasel, and both Tauros formes. To help solve this issue, Pokemon such as your own Sandaconda, Hattrem, and Drifblim can pivot into their attacks and threaten them with paralysis or burn. Hisuian Qwilfish is hindered by losing its Eviolite via Knock Off or Trick; pair it with Pokemon that can afford to lose their item such as Sandaconda, Sableye, and Sticky Hold Muk.</p> "

U-turn allows it to serve as a pivot: easily switching it out of checks such as Gholdengo, Urshifu-R, and Mega Charizard Y, it brings in teammates like Tapu Koko and Dragapult to deal with them. Close Combat can be used to dispose of Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran much more quickly, greatly denting them on the switch. The given EV spread allows Mega Scizor to survive two Close Combats from Mega Lopunny after Stealth Rock and outspeed uninvested Heatran, with the HP and Special Defense EVs helping it check Tapu Lele. Mega Scizor's pivot support is extremely valuable to Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Zamazenta, which all also appreciate how well it exploits defensive Pokemon such as Clodsire, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T. Rotom-W forms a strong VoltTurn core with Mega Scizor as well, with both pivoting out on their checks and racking up solid chip damage over time. Nasty Plot Tornadus-T appreciates Mega Scizor pressuring specially defensive walls and offensive Pokemon like Weavile and Clodsire, letting it go all-in as an offensive wallbreaker with ease. Mega Scizor wearing down Rotom-W and Heatran is also particularly useful for Tornadus-T, as these Pokemon can heavily damage or cripple Tornadus-T in one way or another. Mega Scizor being completely countered by Gholdengo mandates a Pursuit trapper like Weavile or Kingambit to pressure it. Skeledirge also hard counters Mega Scizor, encouraging the aforementioned teammates as well as Garganacl and Heatran.</p> "

Close Combat KOes Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn, as well as providing a strong neutral hit against Rotom-W. Dual Wingbeat hits Clodsire and Toxapex for reliable neutral damage and also hits Zamazenta super effectively, Knock Off is an alternative to hit Gholdengo reliably and remove items like Leftovers from Rotom-W and Heavy-Duty Boots from Tornadus-T, Skeledirge, and Volcarona. This allows a teammate or Mega Scizor to wear them down much more easily. Knock Off is especially relevant in Rotom-W's case, as removing Leftovers makes it easier to put into KO range of +2 Close Combat. Running Knock Off makes Toxapex a much worse matchup, however, so Pokemon like Great Tusk and Tapu Koko that can pressure it are appreciated. Sand Tomb can be used to reliably beat Clodsire, Toxapex, and Gholdengo, preventing them from reliably checking it. Offensive Mega Scizor fits much better on hyper offense teams, which appreciate its incredibly valuable—though short-term—defensive utility. Grimmsnarl is a perfect teammate, providing dual screens to let it set up against foes like Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Landorus-T; it also pivots Mega Scizor in and appreciates it baiting in Gholdengo, which prevents Grimmsnarl from pivoting as effectively. Gholdengo itself is also a notable partner, as it appreciates Mega Scizor dispatching the most popular Dark-types in Weavile and Kingambit. Entry hazards from suicide leads like Landorus-T and Garchomp allow Mega Scizor to clean late-game, as its foes must be chipped before any sweeping is done. Entry hazards particularly help in wearing down checks like Urshifu-R and bulkier Garchomp sets. Mega Scizor struggles against bulky Steel-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-W and Volcarona; Dragonite and Dragapult can take care of the latter, switching into Volcarona to set up as it switches into Mega Scizor, whereas Great Tusk can remove Leftovers from the former, making it easier for Mega Scizor to dispatch with +2 Close Combat. Physically defensive Unaware walls in Skeledirge and Dondozo completely wall Mega Scizor, so offensive Pokemon that can bait in or wear down these foes, including Iron Valiant, make for solid partners.</p> "

Bullet Punch can also remove slower threats such as Hatterene and Tera Fairy Kingambit. Close Combat grants Scizor coverage against Pokemon such as Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Garganacl and provides strong neutral coverage against foes like Rotom-W and Corviknight, especially if not running the corresponding coverage move. Thief is a good way for Scizor to deal a good amount of damage against Gholdengo, while Trailblaze can be used to deal with defensive Water-types like Rotom-W lacking Will-O-Wisp and Dondozo. Tera Steel is Scizor's best option for a Tera type, since it not only gives a boost to Scizor's Bullet Punch but also makes Scizor resistant to Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Tera Electric + Tera Blast can be run to hit Flying- and Water-types such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Corviknight, and Tera Flying Kingambit. 20 Speed EVs are run in order for Scizor to outspeed Corviknight.</p> <p>Offensive teams appreciate Scizor's wallbreaking and revenge killing abilities. Scizor gets easily forced out by Great Tusk as well as Fire-types such as Skeledirge, Cinderace, and Volcarona. Therefore, Water-types such as Rotom-W and Azumarill make for good teammates. Rotom-W in particular synergizes well with Scizor, since the two of them can form a potent VoltTurn core. Azumarill also greatly appreciates Scizor pivoting into it. In return, Scizor can check Grass-types they struggle against like Breloom and Meowscarada. Scizor appreciates teammates that allow it to wallbreak much more easily, so entry hazard support from Pokemon like Garchomp are greatly appreciated. Gholdengo is another good teammate, since it can keep hazards on the field for Scizor to exploit in order to sweep late-game. If Scizor isn't running Thief, it can easily be checked by Gholdengo, so Dark-types like Kingambit pair well with Scizor. However, if Scizor is running Thief, it can struggle against Water-types, so Grass-types like Breloom, Meowscarada, and Tera Grass Volcarona make for good teammates. Scizor's lack of longevity means it can struggle with hazards, so hazard removers like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for good teammates. Most of Scizor's damage output comes from Bullet Punch, so it dislikes Pokemon like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Gholdengo switching into it. Thus, Pokemon that can counter them such as Meowscarada for the former, as well as Iron Moth for the latter two make for good teammates. Finally, setup sweepers such as Dragapult, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon appreciate Scizor muscling through walls like Garganacl, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Ting-Lu.

Thief hits Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Ceruledge for super effective damage, as well as being Scizor's strongest option against Toxapex. Swords Dance can power up Bullet Punch and U-turn, allowing Scizor to break through Garganacl.

Close Combat answers Steel teams and threaten slower walls like Ting-Lu and Corviknight. Trailblaze allows Scizor to outspeed threats like Great Tusk and Hydreigon at +1 Speed and hits Quagsire and Gastrodon.

The Speed boost also comes in handy considering how crowded Scizor's Speed tier is.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / Low: Terastallization works very well at shutting down common methods of revenge killing or walling Scizor, but its typing is good enough to function without Terastallization. If using U-turn, Scizor can focus on pivoting in some matches, making Terastallization even less needed. </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water lets Scizor ambush Chi-Yu, Iron Bundle, and Heatran with a resistance and is especially handy against Fire-types when using Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel: Boosting Bullet Punch is Scizor's best ticket for revenge killing and late-game sweeping, and it retains its Flying-type resistance into powerful Tera Flying Choice Band users like Dragonite and Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark: Tera Dark can cushion Shadow Ball from Gholdengo and Flutter Mane, giving it an extra turn to set up or hit back with Tera-boosted Thief.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric is Scizor's best shot of breaking past Toxapex and Urshifu-R with Tera Blast, and it does good chip damage to Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs: Sitrus Berry trades late-game sweeping power for new setup opportunities, such as avoiding a 2HKO from Modest Gholdengo that lack Choice Specs and a good chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Timid Rotom-W's Hydro Pump. It also has good synergy with Thief, allowing Scizor to steal important items such as Leftovers from Dondozo. Make sure to run 244 Speed EVs to gain an even HP number, letting Sitrus activate after getting hit by Ruination once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Best used with U-turn, Rocky Helmet transforms this Scizor into a good bulky pivot that has the surprising option to sweep late-game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: While Life Orb does compromise Scizor's bulk, it's worth it for being able to OHKO Iron Bundle with a boosted Bullet Punch, and has a good shot of OHKOing physically defensive Ting-Lu with a boosted Close Combat as well.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 28 Atk / 204 Def / 20 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This bulky spread avoids the OHKO from Adamant Tera Ghost Life Orb Mimikyu's +2 Shadow Claw.

With Sitrus Berry, Modest Gholdengo's Shadow Ball is also no longer a 2HKO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 124 Atk / 156 SpD with Adamant</strong>: This Sitrus Berry optimized spread avoids a 2HKO from Jolly Chien-Pao's Crunch, Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, and Modest Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: This defensive spread is best used with U-turn and Rocky Helmet, making Scizor function more like a bulky pivot that can sweep late-game.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Slow U-turn</strong>: When running U-turn, Scizor can drop the Speed investment from any spread and run a Speed IV of 27 to underspeed opposing Scizor and the rare Chesnaught.</li> </ul> "

Bullet Punch is Mega Scizor's strongest STAB move, and its priority allows it to revenge kill faster threats such as Mega Diancie, Iron Valiant, and Mega Lopunny. Close Combat is Mega Scizor's strongest coverage move, enabling it to more easily beat Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. After a Swords Dance boost, Mega Scizor becomes strong enough to 2HKO Celesteela, opposing Mega Scizor, and physically defensive Gastrodon. Knock Off removes essential items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Tornadus-T and Black Sludge from Toxapex, and it also provides Mega Scizor with strong coverage against Aegislash, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo. Alternatively, Trailblaze can also be used to 2HKO bulky Water- or Ground-type Pokemon most other Steel-types struggle with such as Mega Swampert and Gastrodon, as well as potentially OHKO Azumarill and Rotom-W after a Swords Dance boost and Stealth Rock damage. 132 Speed EVs are invested in order for Mega Scizor to outspeed Jolly Azumarill as well as Hydreigon and Urshifu-S after a Trailblaze. Heatran and Ferrothorn are great teammates because they are able to set entry hazards to wear down incoming foes, and Heatran also has the added benefit of providing a Fire immunity thanks to its ability. Ferrothorn can also provide passive healing for Mega Scizor via the use of Leech Seed. In return, Mega Scizor is able to threaten faster Fighting-types such as Sneasler and Iron Valiant with Bullet Punch. Gholdengo is able to threaten Toxapex and Tapu Lele, and it along with Aegislash can also hinder foes with Toxic and Thunder Wave respectively if they are running defensive sets, easing set up for Mega Scizor. In return, Mega Scizor can remove Dark-types such as Meowscarada, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Moltres. Specially defensive Celesteela is an excellent special wall that can wall Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Mega Altaria, while also being able to spread status and use Leech Seed to aid Mega Scizor in its sweeping. As Mega Scizor is more vulnerable to hazards compared to other Steel-types, it appreciates hazard removal from the likes of Corviknight, Excadrill, and Iron Treads. Excadrill and Iron Treads also have the added merit of handling Fire-types like Victini and Ogerpon-H. Excadrill can also bypass Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce and inflict poison on it thanks to Mold Breaker, while Iron Treads can threaten both Landorus formes with Ice Spinner.</p> "

Choice Scarf sets are wonderful because they reliably beat Calm Mind Jolteon, a feat most other Choice Scarf users fail to do because they're specially offensive. On the flipside, Choice Band sets retain great revenge killing potential because Hisuian Sneasel is so naturally fast, and they're very effective wallbreakers to boot thanks to their solid coverage. For the Pokemon Hisuian Sneasel can't consistently defeat like Tera Ghost Sandaconda, Qwilfish, and Sableye, Switcheroo provides a good means of limiting their defensive capabilities. Picking its Tera type is fairly arbitrary, though Tera Fighting lets Choice Band Hisuian Sneasel 2HKO Sandaconda with Close Combat and Choice Scarf Hisuian Sneasel 2HKO Toxicroak after Stealth Rock; alternatively, Tera Dark provides defensive utility against Mesprit, ensures Night Slash OHKOes Rotom after Stealth Rock, and denies Sableye's Prankster Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Despite Choice Scarf and Choice Band Hisuian Sneasel being somewhat different in function, their teammates are pretty similar. Both benefit from teammates like Clawitzer, Rotom, and Mesprit that can take advantage of Sandaconda so they feel less inclined to Terastallize and deal with it themselves. Where they differ is that Choice Scarf Sneasel is far more suited as a late-game cleaner and, as a result, is more reliant on wallbreakers like Guts Ursaring, Magneton, and offensive Appletun to weaken its checks. On the other hand, Choice Band Sneasel prioritizes its role as a wallbreaker and supports late-game sweepers like Dudunsparce and Trailblaze Scyther.</p> "

Even some of its sturdiest checks in Sandaconda, Qwilfish, and Tera Poison Appletun can struggle to keep up, and offensive answers like Choice Scarf Mesprit and Rotom become unreliable because they're slower after a single Trailblaze. Tera Grass is fantastic for turning non-Glare Sandaconda into setup fodder and giving Trailblaze the extra power needed to beat Rotom, but Tera Dark enables Hisuian Sneasel to run Night Slash, giving it a better matchup against Ghost-types in Eviolite Haunter, Drifblim, Sableye, and Terastallized Sandaconda while also making it harder for Choice Scarf Mesprit to revenge kill it.</p> <p>Hisuian Sneasel's Eviolite-boosted bulk, although not stellar, is enough to let it set up on resisted attacks. So, pairing it with pivots like Bombirdier, Rotom, and Braviary that can bring it in against foes like non-Thunder Wave Qwilfish, Muk, and non-Glare Sandaconda if you're using Tera Grass is recommended. Keep in mind, though, that the Sandaconda matchup can be difficult with Terastallization available to your opponent; teammates like Tera Ice Jolteon, Swords Dance Scyther, and Guts Ursaring that can force it to take damage or Terastallize early-game make it far less threatening.</p> "

Tera Ghost takes subverting its weakness to the extreme, turning the tables on the many Fighting-types in the tier. 88 Speed EVs outspeed Vaporeon and Umbreon, which hamper Ursaring with Haze or Foul Play.

Wallbreakers like Medicham and Zoroark and entry hazard setters like Qwilfish and Sandaconda assist in breaking through and wearing them down. Knock Off users like Bombirdier, Klawf, and Passimian can leave Eviolite Ursaring vulnerable to following attacks. Knock Off absorbers like Sandaconda and Umbreon make for great teammates.

Thick Fat coupled with Eviolite gives Piloswine tremendous bulk, with which it can check dangerous Fire-type threats to Ice such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y by disposing of them with Rock Slide. 12 EVs in Attack guarantees an OHKO on offensive Volcarona. Another one of Piloswine's amazing traits is its Ground typing, which makes it a great asset in the Electric matchup by preventing a Volt Switch onslaught while also letting it hit Electric-types super effectively with STAB Earthquake. Toxic is an option to put defensive switch-ins such as Skeledirge and Rotom-W on a timer, helping Piloswine's teammates overpower them, but Roar is an alternative choice to force out threats that may use it to set up, such as Mega Scizor, and to rack up hazard damage from its Stealth Rock and Cloyster's Spikes to wear down threats such as Urshifu-R and Mega Venusaur. Piloswine appreciates Alolan Ninetales's snow and Aurora Veil, which let it wall the opposition more easily. Piloswine is, however, extremely vulnerable to Water-types, so partnering it with Kyurem or Arctozolt is appreciated, as they can easily break Water teams. Substitute Baxcalibur also threatens Poison teams, which can cripple Piloswine with Toxic. Weavile with a Z-Crystal is also a good Knock Off absorber for Piloswine, as losing Eviolite ruins Piloswine; Weavile also forces immense progress by removing key items from Celesteela and Skeledirge, which become susceptible to Stealth Rock afterwards, or outright breaking through them with a Z-Move. Galarian Darmanitan and Shell Smash Cloyster can threaten Steel teams with Flare Blitz and Hydro Pump or Hidden Power Fire, respectively. The Stealth Rocks and Toxic spread by Piloswine also accentuates the breaking power of teammates such as Swords Dance or Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Belly Drum Cetitan. IronPress Avalugg and defensive Cloyster with Hidden Power Fire are also good partners in being able to shut down Mega Scizor. Avalugg, Articuno, and Cloyster are also capable of removing entry hazards, with the latter two also being able to pivot in Piloswine with U-turn and Teleport, respectively.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its strong offensive typing, access to setup moves, and useful coverage, Houndoom establishes itself as a high level offensive threat in the PU metagame. Fire Blast allows Houndoom to have some extra power and can be especially useful in situations where boosting with Nasty Plot is not possible. It also helps Houndoom to muscle through targets that either are extremely bulky or naturally resist Dark Pulse, such as Tinkatuff. Alternatively, Flamethrower provides a less powerful but more consistent Fire-type STAB attack and eliminates the risk of a missed Fire Blast prematurely ending Houndoom's sweep. Sludge Bomb gives Houndoom a strong special coverage move able to hit certain targets for neutral or super effective damage that would otherwise wall Houndoom handily, such as Carbink, Dachsbun, and opposing Houndoom. Sucker Punch gives Houndoom a safe option against faster, weakened targets that threaten to revenge kill it, such as Dugtrio, Alolan Dugtrio, and Basculin, although one must be wary of these Pokemon's access to their own priority. Trailblaze is another option, allowing Houndoom to remedy its underwhelming Speed and become a much more threatening sweeper, either through a well-timed prediction or by finishing off a weakened target. Heavy-Duty Boots is mandatory on this set to offer Houndoom opportunities to use Nasty Plot, since it is already relatively frail. Flash Fire both sets it apart from and allows it to combat fellow Fire-type attackers such as Pyroar, Charizard, and opposing Houndoom, allowing it to safely switch in on their Fire-type STAB moves while also boosting the power of its own. In a similar manner, it can also take advantage of Will-O-Wisp from targets such as Midreavus and Rotom-S. Tera Dark increases the power of Dark Pulse even further while also removing key weaknesses to Rock, Water, and Ground. Tera Grass offers a resistance to the latter two while also increasing the power of Trailblaze and pairing well with Houndoom's natural Fire immunity. Lastly, Tera Poison increases the power of Sludge Bomb, increasing damage against foes such as Carbink and Dachsbun while also providing a resistance to STAB moves from Pokemon such as Skuntank. Also of note, Houndoom should only use a Hasty nature if it is running Sucker Punch; otherwise, it should use a Timid nature and 0 Attack IVs.</p> <p>Houndoom's greatest challenge is its rather disappointing Speed, especially compared to other Fire-type wallbreakers like Charizard and Pyroar, so a Sticky Web setter such as Masquerain is greatly appreciated. Houndoom also greatly appreciates teammates like Perrserker and Skuntank that can handle Dachsbun and Carbink, especially if it opts not to run Sludge Bomb. Similarly, teammates that can handle bulky Water-types such as Lumineon and Whiscash are welcome, as while Houndoom can do relatively good damage to these Pokemon with Dark Pulse, doing so is extremely risky without a Nasty Plot boost or a defensive Tera. Therefore, Grass-types such as Gogoat and Thwackey are natural partners, with Houndoom especially appreciating the latter's ability to set Grassy Terrain, both allowing Houndoom some passive recovery and lessening the damage from opposing Earthquakes. Fast revenge killers, such as Electrode and Raichu, and Choice Scarf users such as Golduck, are also excellent teammates, as they are able to handily dispose of targets that Houndoom has already heavily damaged.</p> "

Thunder Wave can cripple the Pokemon that Blissey checks and punish foes attempting to switch in and threaten it, such as Koraidon and Chien-Pao.

Alternatively, Tera Water can be used to resist Fire- and Water-type attacks from Chi-Yu and Walking Wake at the cost of making Blissey unable to check Miraidon. Tera Fire maintains the ability to take on Chi-Yu but instead trades the Water resistance for a lack of weakness to Miraidon's Electric-type moves. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Blissey from being worn down by entry hazards, whereas Utility Umbrella is an option on teams with sufficient hazard control to reduce the damage it takes from Chi-Yu, Walking Wake, and Iron Bundle's sun and rain-boosted attacks. Blissey functions best on balance and stall teams, where it should be paired with physical walls such as Toxapex, Corviknight, Alomomola, Skeledirge, and Dondozo, which can take on threats like Koraidon, Chien-Pao, Great Tusk, Breloom, and Kingambit for it.

Stealth Rock is Blissey's most popular utility move because it lets other Stealth Rock setters run different sets alongside Blissey. Thunder Wave gives Blissey a way of punishing physical attackers such as Toxicroak, Paldean Tauros, and Scyther for switching in. However, this leaves you vulnerable to Pokemon such as Rotom and Haunter, so Shadow Ball can be used to threaten them instead. Heal Bell allows Blissey to relieve its team of status, helping against bulkier teams that may use Toxic. Any two-move combination of Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, Shadow Ball, and Heal Bell can work depending on your team structure. Tera Ghost helps Blissey against many physical attackers, including Toxicroak, Hisuian Sneasel, and Tauros, and makes it easy to paralyze them on the following turn. Alternatively, Tera Fairy gives Blissey an incredible generalist typing that still helps it tank Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p>Pairing Blissey with physical walls such as Sandaconda, Avalugg, and Sableye can help Blissey circumvent its low physical bulk. Stealth Rock Blissey also opens up frees up Sandaconda to run Coil sets instead. Additionally, Taunt users such as Froslass and Hisuian Qwilfish can beat Blissey by shutting down its recovery and utility moves. Having additional Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Bombirdier and Eelektross that can check these Pokemon helps Blissey substantially. Lastly, item disruption from Knock Off and Trick can be troubling for Blissey; without Heavy-Duty Boots, it's liable to being chipped down overtime by entry hazards, while Trick from Choice item users such as Rotom completely cripples Blissey. As a result, having a Knock Off absorber like Sandaconda or a Trick absorber like Sticky Hold Muk is great to support Blissey.</p> "

Thunderbolt and Ice Beam can be used as well thanks to their useful coverage against Pokemon like Sandaconda and Bruxish, but they don't synergize well with Blissey's common Tera types. Tera Ghost ensures that Shadow Ball OHKOes non-Eviolite Haunter while also giving Blissey more opportunities to set up against Fighting-types it would otherwise be weak to, such as Hisuian Sneasel, Medicham, and Toxicroak.

Seismic Toss is the best move for Blissey to deal consistent damage and not be a completely passive Pokemon despite being ineffective against Ghost-types. Shadow Ball can be used over Seismic Toss in order to not be completely useless against Ghost-types. Stealth Rock helps Blissey's offensive teammates like Ursaluna and Maushold have an easier time getting KOs. Thunder Wave is used to slow down opposing Pokemon so that Blissey's slower, wallbreaking teammates, such as Ursaluna, have an easier time making progress. Alternatively, Healing Wish can be used over Thunder Wave in order to heal one of Blissey's teammates to full health, gaining momentum and making an end-game sweep easier.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Ursaluna and Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark are great teammates for Blissey, as they are capable of dealing with the defensive Pokemon that Blissey is unable to beat, such as Sableye, Toxapex, and Dondozo. In return, Blissey can switch into attacks to keep the wallbreakers safe. Ditto and Blissey make a great pair, as, thanks to Natural Cure, Blissey is able to switch in to status moves that would otherwise cripple Ditto, such as Will-O-Wisp from Sableye, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W, as well as Thunder Wave from Gholdengo, then get rid of the status via Natural Cure. Ditto is also capable of dealing with setup sweepers that would otherwise threaten Blissey such as Baxcalibur and Dragonite. Thunder Wave is also a great option to use on opposing Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant and Meowscarada so Ditto will not have to worry about Speed ties. Hisuian Zoroark is a great teammate for Blissey, as the immunity to Fighting-type moves is extremely valuable. Hisuian Zoroark is also able to burn opposing physical threats like Urshifu-R and Dragonite, which would otherwise make quick work of Blissey, as well as dealing with Ghost-type Pokemon which Blissey cannot damage without Shadow Ball. Hisuian Zoroark's Knock Off can also help Blissey wear down targets by making them vulnerable to entry hazards and removing Leftovers and Black Sludge recovery. Moreover, Hisuian Zoroark can disguise itself as Blissey and catch foes such as Iron Hands, Zamazenta and Sneasler off guard. Cyclizar is a good teammate for Blissey, as Blissey can switch into the fast special attackers that would otherwise threaten Cyclizar such as Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Walking Wake. Cyclizar also carries Knock Off, which, as mentioned previously, works well with Blissey. Choice Specs Cyclizar outspeeds and threatens to OHKO non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, which would otherwise threaten Blissey, with Hyper Voice. Finally, Braviary and Staraptor can function as alternative switch-ins to Fighting-type Pokemon like Quaquaval and Great Tusk and retaliate with their STAB-boosted Brave Bird. Braviary uses Defog to keep Blissey and teammates safe from hazards, while Staraptor is a more offensive Choice Scarf user able to threaten Fighting-type Pokemon.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Choice Band Tyranitar is a formidable wallbreaker courtesy of its remarkable Attack and good offensive movepool. Its solid natural bulk further boosted by sand grants it plenty of opportunities to enter the field and wallbreak, such as in the face of offensive threats like Gengar, Noivern, Iron Jugulis, and special Salamence. Offensively, the sand helps further chip down defensive foes like Wo-Chien, Tera Fairy Slowking, and Scream Tail, and it diminishes Tsareena and Florges's Synthesis. Earthquake hits Pokemon like Tinkaton, Bisharp, Pawmot, and opposing Tyranitar super effectively. Ice Punch threatens Ground-types like Hippowdon and Donphan as well as various Pokemon like Salamence, Noivern, and Wo-Chien without risking a Stone Edge miss. Tera Flying allows Tera Blast to OHKO would-be checks like defensive Slither Wing and Paldean Tauros-W, and it gets rid of most of Tyranitar's weaknesses, allowing it to sit on Hippowdon and Quagsire and take on potential revenge killers like Scizor, Slither Wing, Lucario, and Gyarados. Aside from maintaining the sand boost, Tera Rock further skyrockets Stone Edge's power, granting significant odds to OHKO Scream Tail after Stealth Rock and 2HKOing physically defensive Wo-Chien. Tera Blast can still be run for a more reliable Rock-type attack when Stone Edge's power isn't necessary, such as against Talonflame and Iron Jugulis.</p> <p>Tyranitar is perfectly suited for offense and bulky offense teams. Pivots like Slowking, Talonflame, and Noivern can bring Tyranitar in safely on the field to wreak absolute havoc, especially as they tend to invite in Pokemon such as opposing Slowking and Slowbro. Additionally, Slowking’s Future Sight enhances Tyranitar's wallbreaking, while Noivern can overwhelm a shared check in Tinkaton; both of which pressure the likes of Paldean Tauros-W, Slither Wing, Quagsire, and Donphan for it. Slowking and Talonflame also switch into offensive threats that beat Tyranitar, such as Slither Wing, Lucario, and Tinkaton, with Slowking handling Paldean Tauros-W as well. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Tinkaton and Sandy Shocks take advantage of Tyranitar's forced switches and chip down its checks easily. Setup sweepers like Salamence, Lucario, and Gyarados enjoy Tyranitar wallbreaking early-game; it helps pressure Talonflame and Slowbro and overwhelm shared checks like Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Scream Tail for them to sweep more easily.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Tyranitar can sweep by leveraging its bulk, particularly its high Special Defense in sand to find setup opportunities against special attackers such as Noivern, Salamence, and Choice-locked Gengar. Earthquake takes out Rock-resistant foes such as Tinkaton and Sandy Shocks. Substitute provides Tyranitar cover to strengthen its advantage when granted free turns, making it even more difficult to take out, especially with Leftovers keeping it healthy. It also protects Tyranitar against certain status moves, notably Will-O-Wisp from Talonflame and Paldean Tauros-F as well as Toxic from Quagsire. It also provides Tyranitar with protection against priority moves from Scizor and Slither Wing to remove the need to Terastallize versus them. Taunt can be used over Substitute to shut down defensive Pokemon that would otherwise prevent Tyranitar from sweeping such as Roar Hippowdon while still beating Quagsire. Tera Flying Tyranitar beats Quagsire and, if running Taunt, Hippowdon while removing its weakness to priority users such as Slither Wing and Scizor. It can also let Tyranitar gain potential setup opportunities and generate mind games versus Pokemon like Decidueye, Gastrodon, and Pawmot. A Jolly nature ensures Tyranitar can outspeed Gengar, Pawmot, and Sandy Shocks at +1.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Tyranitar fits on a variety of teams, which range from hyper offense to semi-stall. It generally struggles to make progress against bulky Ground-types, as Hippowdon can force it out with Roar or threaten it with Stone Edge, while Quagsire can PP stall it if healthy. Since Iron Defense + Body Press Slowbro is also a problem for it, Tyranitar appreciates support from Grass-types such as Decidueye and Rotom-C. Rotom-C and Decidueye can also bring Tyranitar in on Pokemon such as Noivern and Salamence for setup opportunities. Entry hazard setters such as Sandy Shocks and Gastrodon can help wear down Tyranitar's checks such as Wo-Chien. Sandy Shocks can also provide Tyranitar with setup opportunities against Pokemon like Decidueye, while Gastrodon can provide a secondary check to Pokemon like Salamence and Gengar to help preserve Tyranitar's HP. Sandy Shocks can also potentially use Tera Ice to wear down and pressure RestTalk Wo-Chien for Tyranitar. Scream Tail can provide Tyranitar with Wish support to more consistently check such Pokemon and can deal with Pokemon such as Bulk Up Quaquaval and Paldean Tauros-W that might try to set up against Tyranitar. Wallbreakers such as Paldean Tauros-W and Gengar can wear down checks to Tyranitar like Wo-Chien and Hippowdon. On hyper offense teams, dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl or Psychic Terrain setters such as Indeedee-M can support Tyranitar with setup opportunities and negate revenge killers, while Indeedee-M can also provide Healing Wish support.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Tyranitar is a great Stealth Rock setter with ample defensive utility, checking dangerous special attackers like Gengar, Noivern, and Salamence. Rock Blast is an alternative to Stone Edge that breaks Mimikyu's Disguise and opposing Tyranitar's Substitute, but it is overall less powerful. Earthquake hits would-be switch-ins such as Tinkaton and Bisharp. Dragon Tail can be used over Earthquake to phaze setup sweepers like Oricorio-E and Polteageist, though Tyranitar loses against the aforementioned Earthquake targets. Tera Ground provides an Electric immunity, which is particularly useful against Sandy Shocks; the given Ground typing also provides a stronger Earthquake and allows it to beat opposing Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Tera Flying provides an emergency Ground immunity and a Fighting resistance, both of which help against Pawmot, opposing Tyranitar, and Slither Wing. The Stealth Rock weakness given by Tera Flying also makes Heavy-Duty Boots worth considering; this lets it avoid otherwise crippling entry hazard damage and stay heatlhy longer. Tera Fairy gives Tyranitar a crucial resistance to Fighting, letting it bait the aforementioned foes and shedding its Ground weakness. It also helps Tyranitar to survive Ground-type coverage from faster foes like Haxorus and Salamence. However, Tera Fairy and Flying remove the Special Defense boost given by sand, as well as Tyranitar's immunity to its own sand, making Tyranitar worse against threats such as Gengar, Maushold, and Prankster Grafaiai, so it must be careful when Terastallizing.</p> <p>Tyranitar's excellent defensive utility makes it fit well on bulky offense and balance teams. Tyranitar's weakness to strong physical attackers like Slither Wing and Pawmot makes checks to them like Salamence and Quagsire great teammates; the latter can also form an entry hazard-stacking core with Tyranitar, making it easier to wear down foes like Tinkaton and Wo-Chien. Salamence provides a safer switch-in into Talonflame, preventing it from taking a burn or U-turn chip. Scream Tail appreciates Tyranitar checking Gengar and taking pressure off of it as a check to certain special attackers like Salamence and Iron Jugulis. It can also check the aforementioned physical attackers alongside others like Gallade, and it can provide Wish support to keep Tyranitar healthy as well. Tinkaton can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Talonflame, Slowking, and Sandy Shocks, making Stealth Rock more effective in wearing down the opposition, especially if Tyranitar is paired with a Spikes setter like Sandy Shocks. Tyranitar being checked by bulky Ground-types like Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Donphan makes the likes of Tsareena and Wo-Chien desirable as teammates; Tsareena in particular also gives Tyranitar free entry against Noivern and Gengar via U-turn.</p> "

Stone Edge threatens common Defoggers in Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Rotom-W to ensure its Stealth Rock stays on the field. Crunch dents Pokemon like Dragapult and Gholdengo while doing sizable damage to Gastrodon and Ferrothorn. Alternatively, Superpower can be used over Crunch to immediately threaten Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Ferrothorn, but it leaves Mega Tyranitar unable to pressure Pokemon like Gholdengo, Clodsire, and Reuniclus. Pursuit traps Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Dragapult, Tornadus-T, and Gholdengo. 108 Speed EVs allow Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Gholdengo. Mega Tyranitar's middling defensive typing leaves it extremely vulnerable to Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta. As such, defensive Pokemon like Zapdos, Gholdengo, and Toxapex pair well with Mega Tyranitar, as they cover the threats it would struggle with. Toxapex in particular appreciates Mega Tyranitar trapping Heatran and Gholdengo with Pursuit, after which it can then stack Toxic Spikes. This, along with Mega Tyranitar's Stealth Rock, wears down each other's checks like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Zamazenta. Mega Tyranitar also appreciates Pokemon that can deal with Ground-types, such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Tangrowth. Fighting-type partners such as Iron Valiant and Zamazenta greatly appreciate Mega Tyranitar removing Pokemon like Gholdengo and Reuniclus. Mega Tyranitar's sand enables Excadrill, which is a great offensive partner for it. Excadrill is able to snipe Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Kingambit, while Tyranitar deals with Flying-types like Zapdos and Mega Charizard Y in return. Mega Tyranitar can also chip Pokemon like Rotom-W and Landorus-T, which enables Excadrill break past them more easily.</p> "

Stone Edge is a strong STAB option that OHKOes Iron Moth while denting neutral targets such as Celesteela and Tapu Fini. Pursuit enables Mega Tyranitar to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types, like Latios and Blacephalon. Crunch offers a strong STAB move to hit bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types, like Aegislash and Mega Latias. It is also the strongest move Mega Tyranitar has to hit Galarian Slowking. Superpower is an option to snipe opposing Tyranitar and severely damage would-be switch-ins such as Excadrill and Iron Treads. 176 Speed EVs enable Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Aegislash and Celesteela. Offensive Fighting-types such as Buzzwole, Blaziken and Keldeo, appreciate Mega Tyranitar removing bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types.

Mega Tyranitar’s typing gives its weaknesses to prominent attacking types such as Fighting, Water and Ground, so Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Galarian Slowking can provide switch-ins to these types. The Future Sight support provided by the latter meshes well with Pursuit and dissuades Buzzwole and Iron Hands from switching in. Celesteela and Skarmory can help check Excadrill, Iron Treads, and Buzzwole, with Skarmory providing Spikes as a bonus. Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Aegislash can all check Fighting-types to some degree.

Hurricane is the STAB move of choice, bypassing the accuracy check in rain while nailing Water-resistant Grass-types, such as Amoonguss, Meowscarada, and Breloom. Roost allows Pelipper to come in multiple times throughout the match to re-set rain if need be. U-turn let's it slow pivot into threats such as Quaquaval and Barraskewda. Knock Off cripples foes, while Surf gives a secondary STAB move boosted by rain, allowing Pelipper to wear down Pokemon like Gholdengo and Kingambit. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to switch in and set rain even if Stealth Rock is up. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 48 Def / 212 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Breloom.</p> <p>Barraskewda is the obvious partner choice thanks to its ridiculous Speed with Swift Swim in rain. It also appreciates Pelipper's slow pivoting with U-turn due to its lack of bulk. Walking Wake is another great rain attacker, since its STAB Dragon-type moves hit most Water-resistant and immune foes, such as opposing Gastrodon and Amoonguss, hard. Quaquaval appreciates Pelipper's slow pivoting to come in safely and can potentially snowball through teams with rain-boosted Aqua Step and Moxie. Quaquaval can also get rid of entry hazards should Pelipper get hit by Knock Off, provided it has Rapid Spin. Gastrodon and Quagsire are also really good partners thanks to their Electric immunities. Both also provide entry hazards, pressuring opponents, and Pelipper can use hazard removal turns to pivot out with U-turn or heal with Roost. Rotom-W can form a VoltTurn core with Pelipper, allowing the team to gain momentum easily and bring in Pokemon fairly safely. Rotom-W can also switch into opposing Electric-types like Magnezone, Iron Hands, and Sandy Shocks if necessary. Toxapex provides a Fighting resistance, a Grass neutrality, and another pivot thanks to its ability, Regenerator. Slowking checks threats such as Indeedee and Walking Wake, and it's another slow pivot thanks to Chilly Reception and Regenerator, bringing Pelipper in safely to set the rain. Both Toxapex and Slowking can also easily pivot into Pelipper with Eject Button, since Regenerator means they won't lose too much health from an attack. Azumarill can take advantage of rain with priority in Aqua Jet, as well as bringing a very strong Water-type STAB move.</p> "

Mega Swampert offers a valuable Electric immunity for Pelipper, checking foes such as Tapu Koko. Tornadus-T can provide entry hazard control with Defog, letting Pelipper enter the field and summon rain without having to fear taking hazard damage. Ferrothorn takes advantage of Pelipper's typing and ability to form a solid defensive core and provide a robust blanket check for opposing rain. In return, Pelipper alleviates Ferrothorn's massive Fire weakness by setting rain, and it can check threats that Ferrothorn fails to cover, such as Mega Lopunny.</p> "

Ice Beam can OHKO Dartrix and Gabite, but it is hard to fit, as Masquerain normally finds more usage out of U-turn and Quiver Dance. Masquerain can Terastallize into the Ghost type to prevent spinners such as Quaxwell and Carkol from removing its Sticky Web.

Hatterene is a good partner, as it prevents entry hazards, preserving Breloom's Focus Sash. Kingambit is a powerful sweeper that helps to handle Flutter Mane and Ice Shard Chien-Pao, which can stop Breloom from sweeping. Fast allies like Koraidon, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao can force in slower Pokemon, like Toxapex and Corviknight, for Breloom to exploit, and they also put pressure on Gholdengo and Skeledirge, which effectively wall Breloom.

Technician-boosted Bullet Seed hits Water- and Ground-types such as Rotom-W and Great Tusk hard while providing a powerful neutral hit against walls such as Toxapex and Hatterene. Close Combat is Breloom's most consistent wallbreaking tool, OHKOing Garganacl after Stealth Rock and cleanly 2HKOing Corviknight. Mach Punch, in conjunction with Technician, allows Breloom to pick off faster threats such as Greninja, Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Baxcalibur. Lastly, Bulldoze OHKOes Gholdengo and 2HKOes Skeledirge, while Spore lets Breloom incapacitate a switch-in and generates opportunities to take down counters later in the battle, and Rock Tomb OHKOes Volcarona while reliably hitting Dragonite and still 2HKOing Skeledirge. Tera Fighting allows Breloom to 2HKO Amoonguss after Stealth Rock with Close Combat and revenge kill threats such as Cinderace from higher health with Mach Punch. Alternatively, Tera Grass turns Bullet Seed into a powerful nuke that can break down common switch-ins like Gholdengo and generally increase its damage output, turning Breloom into a very potent stallbreaker. Tera Fire, on the other hand, gives Breloom the option to use Tera Blast in the final slot, which destroys Gholdengo and Amoonguss and allows Breloom to take a hit from, and OHKO in return, offensive Volcarona.</p> <p>Breloom fits well on bulky offense teams that can give it opportunities to come into play and capitalize on its wallbreaking prowess. Due to Breloom's low defenses and Speed, it appreciates being paired with pivots like Rotom-W and Dragapult that can help it enter battle safely. Ting-Lu and Great Tusk can set entry hazards to help Breloom break through pivots such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. Great Tusk in particular appreciates its tendency to force in Gholdengo and pop its Air Balloon, while teammates such as Garganacl, Toxapex, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo can deal with Breloom's faster offensive checks, such as Dragapult, Volcarona, and Iron Valiant. On more hyper offensive teams, Breloom is best paired with sweepers like Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Baxcalibur that appreciate its ability to wear down key defensive threats such as Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo. On these teams, leads such as Glimmora can set hazards to aid Breloom's wallbreaking capabilities. Kingambit is a fantastic partner that handles Gholdengo and appreciates Breloom putting pressure on Great Tusk.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Breloom is a solid choice for Fighting teams thanks to Spore alongside super powerful Technician-boosted STAB moves Bullet Seed and Mach Punch, alleviating some of the pressure from the Water and Dark matchups. Spore gives Breloom setup opportunities and impedes otherwise major threats to the team such as Flying-types like Corviknight and Pelipper and Poison-types such as Toxapex, Iron Moth, and Clodsire. Focus Sash guarantees it can use Spore at least once—provided Breloom can keep itself at full HP—and also gives Breloom the opportunity to use Swords Dance as well. Bullet Seed is a fantastic STAB move that threatens Water-types like Dondozo and Quagsire. Mach Punch provides Breloom with a super strong STAB move with priority to not only circumvent its below average Speed but also threatens faster Pokemon such as Meowscarada, Iron Treads, and Cyclizar. Swords Dance allows Breloom to not only power up its STAB moves but takes advantage of the setup opportunities that Spore can provide. Bulldoze, however, can apply pressure to Poison-types such as Skuntank and Toxapex while also putting the foe at a potential Speed disadvantage.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Paldean Tauros-F and Lucario appreciate Breloom's ability to potentially impede their checks such as Toxapex, Dondozo, and Quagsire, giving them ample setup opportunities. Paldean Tauros-F handles the Dark matchup fairly easily thanks to it avoiding being burned by Sableye while also resisting Meowscarada's and Chien-Pao's STAB moves. Lucario can threaten Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant with its STAB Bullet Punch. Assault Vest Iron Hands is another great partner that can handle the special attacking Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene while also handling Flying-types such as Dragonite and Iron Jugulis which could otherwise threaten Breloom out. Entry hazard control from Great Tusk is imperative to allow Breloom to keep its Focus Sash intact. Great Tusk also helps Breloom by providing Stealth Rock, which racks up chip damage with the switches Breloom can force. Gallade is a great partner that can threaten Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Toxapex. Iron Valiant is another fantastic partner for Breloom, providing Future Sight support to ward off the Poison-types that like to switch into both of Breloom's STAB moves. Its Fairy STAB moves also ease the Dark and Dragon matchups as well as being quite useful in the Fighting mirror.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its high Attack, great ability in Technician, and a STAB priority move, Breloom is a staple on Grass teams as a late-game cleaner. Besides boosting Mach Punch, Technician provides Grass teams with powerful Rock-type coverage in its Rock Tomb. These two moves and Focus Sash allow Breloom to handle an assortment of major threats to grass teams, including Volcarona, Chien-Pao, Iron Jugulis, Kilowattrel, Choice Specs Greninja, and Kingambit. With Bullet Seed or Close Combat, it also can function as a good wallbreaker. Spore is an amazing utility move to stop threats and force out Pokemon like Skeledirge. However, with the use of other Spore users like Amoonguss and Toedscruel, Spore can be replaced with Swords Dance. With it, Breloom can set up when opponents predict it will use Spore, increasing its late-game cleaning potential. An Adamant nature is standard, but Jolly Breloom can outspeed Adamant Dragonite, Adamant Cetitan, and Choice Specs Pelipper.</p> <p>Other offensive teammates like Meowscarada and Rotom-C benefit from Breloom forcing out threats with Spore or breaking through Pokemon like Toxapex, Corviknight, or Ting-lu with its high Attack stat and Spore. In exchange, Meowscarada handles Psychic-types such as Gallade and Espathra. Setup Pokemon like Substitute Rotom-C work especially well with Breloom, as they can come in freely on a slept enemy or a physical wall Breloom draws in. The type's more passive defensive Pokemon also support Breloom, with Amoonguss dealing with Fairy-types and Wo-Chien, by using Leech Seed on a foe, allowing chipped Breloom to switch in and restore its Focus Sash protection. Breloom also enjoys Spikes or Toxic Spikes Brambleghast or Toedscruel to chip foes into KO range, including Toxapex and Iron Hands after a Swords Dance. Aurora Veil from Abomasnow can increase Breloom's chances to set up with Swords Dance. Breloom is weak against bulkier Pokemon with multi-hit moves, which can instantly KO it through Focus Sash, like Icicle Spear from Baxcalibur. Thus, entry hazards to wear them down and physical walls, like Body Press Abomasnow, are very important. Once chipped, Breloom's frailty and low Speed make it weak to faster priority users and to other offensive Pokemon not bothered by Mach Punch. To handle the latter, such as Flutter Mane and Paldean Tauros-B, faster teammates like Choice Scarf Meoscarada and Rotom-C can be very helpful.</p> "

However, do note that this set is very susceptible to Taunt and Encore, which can make it difficult to even select Breloom in the team preview phase.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect: Protect gives Breloom an opportunity to scout out its opponents and further stall them out once Leech Seed has been set up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Timer Stalling</strong>: If you obtain a numerical advantage early in the match, you can utilize Breloom to win on timer. This is particularly effective since the Leech Seed damage happens after recovery from Leftovers and Poison Heal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze</strong>: Bulldoze allows Breloom to further support its teammates and threaten Gholdengo, which likes to absorb status moves. Do be wary that many Gholdengo are Tera Flying, which can render Breloom ineffective versus it.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic can be difficult to fit into the set, but it allows Breloom to punish Tera Grass foes that attempt to circumvent Breloom's Spore and Leech Seed.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High: While Breloom's typing does have some useful resistances, its low bulk means more favorable resistances granted by Terastallization can be key to setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: This defensive Tera type allows Breloom to resist Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear and Skeledirge's Torch Song, both of which are threats to Substitute. It also helps against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, though note that Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Tera Fire Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire: This Tera type allows Breloom to resist Ice- and Fire-type attacks while also providing Breloom with a Fairy-type resistance.

To help alleviate this issue, Pokemon like Hisuian Qwilfish, Carbink, Articuno, and Appletun can all help answer these threats.

Prankster Will-O-Wisp lets Sableye neutralize threats to Dark-type teams such as Great Tusk and Dragonite by burning them before they can make a move. Taunt lets it shut down set up attempts from Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Bulk Up Corviknight or hinder opposing defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex and Clodsire. Taunt also blocks entry hazards from going up, which is huge for Dark due to its lack of entry hazard control. Alternatively, Encore lets Sableye halt the aforementioned setup attempts and gain more momentum from them. Knock Off capitalizes on the switches that Sableye forces by knocking off crucial items from Pokemon such as Toxapex or Dondozo. Alternatively, Night Shade deals steady damage throughout the game. Finally, Recover gives Sableye longevity to continually check the aforementioned threats. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Sableye come in and out without worrying about residual damage from entry hazards.</p> <p>Some great teammates for Sableye include Skuntank and Kingambit, as both of them boast a critical neutrality to Fairy that lets them take hits such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant's and Flutter Mane's Moonblasts and force both out. In return, Sableye can complement Skuntank's chip damage from Toxic Spikes through its utility moves and ease Kingambit's setup through item removal and spreading burns. Ting-Lu is another good teammate, as it can set entry hazards to further wear away at the opposing team while also acting as an emergency soft check to Fairy-types if it is running Heavy Slam.

It also can let Mega Medicham stall out rain, Toxic, and Terrain on foes, all while putting opponents into range for one of its stronger attacks safely. Ice Punch lets Mega Medicham get rid of Landorus-T and Dragonite, which can enable it to freely use its STAB moves. Bullet Punch can be used to snipe Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Diancie, and Weavile, and it also removes revenge killers like Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny after chip damage. Thunder Punch can be used to hit Slowbro, and in tandem with Electric Terrain, it can 2HKO Pokemon like Gholdengo and Victini. Alternatively, Thief can be used to immediately damage the aforementioned Pokemon, so it can use its STAB moves more. Due to Mega Medicham’s frailty and mediocre Speed tier, it is easily revenge killed. Defensive partners like Gholdengo, Ting-Lu, and Ferrothorn help check threats like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Dragapult. Knock Off and Pursuit users like Kingambit and Weavile also support Mega Medicham, as they break through Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon Mega Medicham struggle with, such as Slowbro, Victini, Gholdengo and Skeledirge, allowing it to consistently use its STAB attacks. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn benefit Mega Medicham, as it forces a lot of switches and entry hazards wear down checks quickly. Tapu Koko is a good partner for Mega Medicham, as it handles Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Slowbro reliably and powers up Mega Medicham's Thunder Punch. Tapu Lele can also be a good partner for Mega Medicham, as it powers up Zen Headbutt to insane levels, but blocking Fake Out and Bullet Punch from being used can be problematic. Pokemon like Volcarona and Kartana appreciate Torandus-T, Skeledirge, Clodsire, and Gholdengo being pressured constantly by Mega Medicham, enabling them to wreak havoc once the checks are removed or chipped.</p> "

Thunder Punch and Ice Punch hit Bruxish and Sandaconda respectively, and Flying-types like Drifblim and Oricorio-F. Trick punishes defensive switch-ins like Sandaconda and is especially beneficial to use against bulky teams, since they are generally slower than Medicham anyway. Tera Fighting enhances Medicham's wallbreaking and cleaning potential by powering up Close Combat, and it lets Medicham resist Toxicroak and Bombirdier's Sucker Punch. Partners that commonly run Choice Scarf, such as Zoroark and Rotom, can revenge kill foes instead of Medicham early-on, keeping its set a mystery.

Torkoal uses Lava Plume for its good Base Power and burn chance, but Flamethrower can be used for more power, notably guaranteeing in breaking Dragapult's Substitute, which would otherwise use Torkoal as setup fodder. Stealth Rock is used, as Torkoal is usually leading and can get entry hazards up early-game. Rapid Spin keeps entry hazards off the field, which allows it and its teammates, particularly the Fire-types, to stay healthy throughout the game. Yawn provides opportunities for its strong teammates, whether through a sleeping foe or a forced switch. However, Will-O-Wisp can be used to more consistently cripple physical attackers, while Body Press can be used to take advantage of its great Defense against Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Roaring Moon. Tera Water gives Torkoal a great defensive typing, flipping matchups against Pokemon like Great Tusk and Azumarill and removing its weakness to Stealth Rock, letting it stay in the game longer and cripple the aforementioned wallbreakers with a burn. A Calm nature alongside maximum Special Defense investment can also be considered, as it can avoid the 2HKO from attacks like Iron Moth's Sludge Wave, Galarian Slowking's Future Sight and Gholdengo's unboosted Shadow Ball</p> <p>Pokemon that take advantage of Torkoal's sun are great partners. Some of these Pokemon include Walking Wake, which greatly appreciates the immense power boost to both its Special Attack or Speed alongside Hydro Steam, and it is also great at threatening weather setters like Tyranitar and Pelipper. Other strong Protosynthesis Pokemon can use the power or Speed boosts the sun provides. Great Tusk can use an Attack or Defense boost to wallbreak or check physical attackers such as Kingambit and Dragonite, respectively. Similarly, Roaring Moon uses the Speed or Attack boost to become a powerful wallbreaker with Choice Band. Brute Bonnet is a particularly excellent sun abuser; its Spore can effectively shut down a target, and with an Attack boost from Protosynthesis its Bullet Seed easily breaks past Dondozo while its Sucker Punch is devastating against faster threats like Dragapult or opposing Walking Wake. Hisuian Lilligant is another solid teammate and a decent alternative to Brute Bonnet; its powerful Solar Blade can muscle past Dondozo, its STAB Close Combat can deal with Heatran, and it can become an incredibly dangerous sweeper even against offensive teams thanks to Chlorophyll's Speed boost. Fire-types like Cinderace, Ceruledge, and Iron Moth enjoy having their STAB moves boosted even further. Moreover, the aforementioned Cinderace and Great Tusk also provide additional entry hazard control with Court Change and Rapid Spin, alleviating Torkoal from entry hazard pressure and having to remove them itself. Hatterene is a great teammate on fast-paced sun teams, as it deflects Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce and prevents Torkoal and their teammates from taking as much chip damage as well as potentially heal Torkoal up with Healing Wish. Lastly, Kingambit offers sun teams a solid answer to Galarian Slowking and a powerful late game wincon, as it can clean up once Torkoal and the teammates it enables have worn the opposing team down sufficiently. It especially appreciates Torkoal's ability to give it openings to set up a Swords Dance thanks to Torkoal's Yawn or Will-O-Wisp support.</p> "

Body Press allows Torkoal uses Torkoal's high Defense to heavily damage the likes of Kingambit, Blissey, and Tyranitar, as well as preventing Roaring Moon and Hydreigon from setting up freely. Alternatively, Yawn can be used to force a switch, allowing Torkoal to freely bring a teammate that can benefit from the sun. Heat Rock provides more turns of sun for allies to benefit from, but Heavy-Duty Boots greatly increases Torkoal's longevity. If using the latter, getting fewer turns of sun also allows Fire teams to better manage opposing Protosynthesis sweepers, such as Flutter Mane or Sandy Shocks.</p> <p>Thanks to Chlorophyll and its unique typing, Scovillain pairs well with Torkoal, as the sun allows it to outspeed and KO foes such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Quaquaval. Choice Specs Scovillian can significantly damage to Toxapex with Solar Beam and even 2HKO Clodsire in the sun with Flamethrower. Cinderace is another wallbreaker that thrives under the sun and appreciates Stealth Rock chipping at the opposing team. It can run Court Change, allowing for more entry hazard control if you're running Heat Rock Torkoal, or use a Choice Scarf to defeat foes like Flutter Mane and Choice Specs Greninja. Iron Moth can use sun and Fire Blast to OHKO foes such as Iron Jugulis and Sableye. Ceruledge scares out Flutter Mane, which can otherwise become problematic due to Power Gem and Protosynthesis boosting its Speed in sun. Thanks to its great defensive stats and Unaware, Skeledirge is an amazing partner for Torkoal, handling setup sweepers such as Curse Dondozo and Belly Drum Azumarill for it. Also, sun weakens Water-type moves for Skeledirge and boosts its Torch Song. Rotom-H can tank special hits Torkoal can't withstand from the likes of Iron Valiant, as well as providing a valuable Ground immunity, which allows it to come in on foes such as Clodsire, Sandy Shocks, and Ting-Lu.

Night Slash catches Ghost-types like Misdreavus and Banette that would otherwise switch into Zangoose safely and punishes Tera Ghost from Pokemon like Gabite and Whiscash. Quick Attack lets Zangoose kill fast Pokemon like Charizard, Raichu, and Choice Scarf Rotom-F. Swords Dance turns Zangoose into an even more powerful breaker, OHKOing foes like Tinkatuff and Dachsbun at +2, at the cost of being unable to deal with faster Pokemon, making it a good choice against bulkier teams that lack faster Pokemon. Protect lets Zangoose scout Choice Scarf users like Lycanroc-N and Rotom-F as well as consistently activate Toxic Orb, but it is much less consistent overall than the other two options. Toxic Orb is the only item that can activate Toxic Boost on Zangoose, which pairs wonderfully with Facade. Tera Normal gives Zangoose a solid boost of power on Facade and Quick Attack, which is especially useful on sets lacking Swords Dance. It also gives Zangoose an easier time KOing frail, faster Pokemon like Pyroar and Houndoom.</p> <p>Zangoose suffers heavily from the chip damage it accrues, so ways to mitigate this are helpful. Dachsbun is useful for its ability to pass Wish to Zangoose, helping it stay alive and break for a longer time; it is also useful for coming in on Pokemon that force Zangoose out like Alolan Persian and Choice Scarf Lycanroc-N. Fast Taunt users like Electrode and Pyroar can prevent entry hazards from foes like Perserrker and Tinkatuff, limiting the amount of chip damage that Zangoose takes. Electrode can also bring Zangoose in on its checks, like Gogoat and Dunsparce, to help it break. Offensive partners like Sawsbuck and Indeedee-F can help Zangoose overwhelm shared checks like Misdreavus and Tinkatuff, and Indeedee-F's Healing Wish is useful for giving Zangoose more chances to break, although Psychic Terrain from Indeedee-F pairs poorly with Zangoose's Quick Attack. Zangoose also benefits heavily from Sticky Web from Pokemon like Spidops and Masquerain, as being able to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Golduck and other fast Pokemon like Alolan Dugtrio is a massive boon for it.</p> "

Earthquake can be used over Earth Power for the slightly higher damage, especially against special setup sweepers like Calm Mind Spiritomb and Wyrdeer, but Earth Power is generally preferred for inflicting better damage on physical walls like Klawf, Perrserker, and Alolan Persian and being unaffected by Grassy Terrain set by Thwackey, a common switch-in to Whiscash. Ice Beam is great for doing a chunk of damage on Grass-types like Gogoat, Flapple, and Dartrix. Surf is an option over Ice Beam, landing better damage on neutral targets instead of the previously mentioned foes. Stone Edge is great in the last slot to cover the likes of Charizard, as well as preventing setup sweepers like Rotom-F and Masquerain from taking advantage of Whiscash's relative passivity. Stealth Rock can be opted for instead to compress both forms of entry hazards into one Pokemon, possibly freeing up another team slot.

Oblivious allows Whiscash to set up hazards even against Taunt users like Alolan Persian and Misdreavus.

The EV spread focuses on Special Defense over Defense because it makes for a better matchup against Volt Switch users like Rotom-F, as well as other special attackers like Alolan Persian and Fire-types like Charizard.</p> <p>Whiscash appreciates spinblockers like Misdreavus and Spiritomb to keep its entry hazards up against Rapid Spin users like Quaxwell. Whiscash appreciates Charizard and Honchkrow's ability to deal with Grass-types; in return, it can take on the Rock- and Electric-types like Choice Scarf Lycanroc-N and Electrode. Grass-types like Gogoat and Dartrix also make for great teammates, as Whiscash can take on Fire- and Poison-types like Charizard, Houndoom, and Skuntank that threaten them. Its presence as an Electric-immune to help the likes of Masquerain and Honchkrow is superb, as it has the typing and bulk to take hits from the coverage moves that Pokemon like Raichu, Rotom-F, and Electrode carry. Dachsbun, Crabominable, and Carbink all benefit from Whiscash, as it can take Steel-type hits from Perrserker and Alolan Dugtrio for them. With a lot of the tier being weak or neutral to Rock, Whiscash finds itself having the typing to help the likes of Charizard, Masquerain, and Rabsca avoid dealing with Lycanroc-N, Dugtrio, and Gabite. It does find a lot of trouble handling Misdreavus, as it lacks the super effective coverage to get past its bulk. This is why pairing it with a Dark-type like Skuntank or Alolan Persian can be beneficial. Since Whiscash doesn't have recovery, it really doesnt like taking Will-O-Wisp from said Misdreavus, and Charizard or Toxic from Skuntank. As a result, status absorbers like Chansey, Dragonair, and Tinkatuff make for great teammates.</p> "

Its typing, bulk, and ability in Intimidate make it one of the best responses to physical threats like Slither Wing, Lucario, and Scizor. Hydro Pump blows away foes like Hippowdon, Tyranitar, and Sandy Shocks while providing a strong neutral hit on Tinkaton and Scizor. Flamethrower hits the aforementioned Steel-types, alongside others like Bisharp and Tinkaton. Flamethrower also hits Brambleghast without reaping the downsides of using Draco Meteor. Heavy-Duty Boots removes Salamence's Stealth Rock weakness, which allows it to switch in more freely against threats it needs to check. Terastallizing is primarily used defensively to improve its matchups against common offensive Pokemon. Tera Water allows Salamence to resist Bullet Punch from Scizor and still retain a Water-type resistance against Floatzel. Tera Steel improves the matchup against Tinkaton, turns Salamence into a decent Staraptor and Maushold check, and provides a resist to many forms of priority in the tier such as Accelerock from Lycanroc-D and Bullet Punch from Scizor. Tera Dragon should be used to help break through sturdier Pokemon like Gastrodon and Slowking more easily.</p> <p>Pawmot and Scizor can help remove Gastrodon, Tyranitar, and Scream Tail— all of which Salamence struggles to break past—while also serving as more reliable checks to Bisharp. Faster Pokemon such as Pawmot, Sandy Shocks, and Lycanroc-D can revenge kill or force Salamence out, so partners like Hippowdon and Quagsire are appreciated, both also acting as decent Knock Off absorbers against Grafaiai and Tinkaton. Quagsire can also provide Spikes support to help wear down some of the aforementioned special walls as well as put them on a timer with Toxic, as well as reliably check most Swords Dance Scizor and Lucario if Salamence isn't Tera Steel.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance makes Salamence one of the scariest sweepers in the tier thanks to its great offensive typing. Outrage is a powerful STAB move that helps muscle through sturdier walls like Gastrodon and Hippowdon after a boost; however, Dragon Claw is a weaker alternative that doesn't have the downside of being locked in. Earthquake provides perfect coverage to deal with Tyranitar, Tinkaton, and Bisharp. Dual Wingbeat helps break through Scream Tail better and can pick off weakened Flying-types like Noivern and Iron Jugulis without locking into Outrage. Roost is an alternative that provides longevity against Pokemon like Slither Wing and Lokix. It is best used alongside Intimidate on bulkier teams that need the defensive utility of Salamence's typing. Otherwise, Moxie is preferred, as it can easily let Salamence snowball through a team. Tera Steel lets Salamence set up on Tinkaton—though it must be wary of Encore—and provides needed resists to many priority moves like Accelerock, Bullet Punch, Ice Shard, and Extreme Speed from Lycanroc-D, Scizor, Weavile, and Lucario.</p> <p>Quagsire is very problematic due to Unaware ignoring any Dragon Dance and Moxie boosts. Pawmot can remove Quagsire with Seed Bomb, Scizor can lure it in and remove it with Trailblaze, and Sandy Shocks can threaten to OHKO with Tera Blast after Terastallizing into a Grass-type. Sandy Shocks can also help remove physically defensive Hippowdon, which is especially helpful if it's running Roar. Sandy Shocks and other entry hazard setters such as Tyranitar can wear down Pokemon like opposing Tyranitar and Scream Tail into range of its attacks. Gengar is a fantastic wallbreaker to pair with Salamence, as it can forcefully remove Grafaiai, which can be a massive hindrance due to Prankster Encore limiting setup opportunities. Gengar also spinblocks alongside the aforementioned entry hazard setters and weakens Tyranitar and Tinkaton into Earthquake range.</p> "

          "description": "<ul> <li>Choice Scarf Kyogre is a solid form of speed control found on bulky offense teams. Its ability to outspeed Zacian-C and pressure common Pokemon found on bulky archetypes, like Ting-Lu, Corviknight, Skeledirge, and Groudon, gives it a decent offensive presence. Choice Scarf Kyogre can also pressure hyper offense teams because those teams don't run Pokemon naturally faster than it. However, Choice Scarf Kyogre is prediction reliant, as there are a lot of Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks in Ubers, mainly metagame staples like Koraidon, Miraidon, and other defensive Pokemon like Water Absorb Clodsire and Eternatus. Choice Scarf Kyogre is also relatively weak, which means that it'll often be forced to use Tera to power up its attacks; even then, Pokemon like Eternatus and Clodsire will still wall Kyogre.</li> <li>Koraidon is the biggest threat to Kyogre, as it commonly switches into it, takes little damage from its Water-type attacks, and sets sun. Catching Koraidon with Ice Beam is extremely important, as it can make the difference between Kyogre sweeping in the late game or not. This makes Choice Scarf Kyogre extremely prediction reliant, as one single bad move can mean the entire momentum of the battle is lost.</li> <li>Tera Water boosts Kyogre's Water-type moves to insane levels. For instance, Water Spout now OHKOes max HP Arceus formes that are neutral to Water and 2HKOes Arceus formes that resist Water. It also has a good chance to OHKO Groudon even if sun is active.</li> <li>Kyogre should be brought onto the field via pivoting moves like U-turn from the likes of Koraidon, Miraidon, and Landorus-T. Unless there are Water Absorb Pokemon on the enemy team, Water Spout is a relatively free move to spam; however, hitting Koraidon on the switch with a well-timed Ice Beam can be game-changing.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Kyogre appreciates Pokemon that can wallbreak by themselves. A good teammate for this reason is Miraidon, which shares a common check in Clodsire. Taunt Miraidon in particular can shut down Clodsire completely, as Clodsire will be at half HP after switching into Draco Meteor. Miraidon can also bring Kyogre onto the field via U-turn. Arceus-Ground is another great teammate for Kyogre, as it can keep Pokemon like Eternatus, Clodsire, and Miraidon in check.</li> <li>Pokemon that can check Koraidon, like Arceus-Fairy, Groudon, and Skeledirge, are a must, as Koraidon is one of the most annoying Pokemon in Ubers for Kyogre to deal with: it replaces rain with sun, weakening Kyogre's main attacking moves. They can also set entry hazards and, in Landorus-T's case, bring Kyogre onto the field with U-turn.</li> <li>Entry hazard removers like Giratina-O and Corviknight are appreciated, as Kyogre loses a lot of power when its HP is lowered. Both Pokemon also check threats like Extreme Killer Arceus, which can revenge kill Kyogre with Extreme Speed.</li> </ul> "

However, the ever-present sun set by Koraidon and its relatively low Speed make it harder to use than it may appear, even with its incredible power.</li> <li>Water Spout gives Kyogre the power to OHKO even resistant Pokemon such as Miraidon and Eternatus when paired with Tera Water, and it lets Kyogre claim KOs with ease early on. Ice Beam lets Kyogre hit Koraidon and Clodsire super effectively, cleanly OHKOing the former lacking bulk EVs and 2HKOing the latter. Thunder is Kyogre's strongest option for breaking through bulky Water-types such as Toxapex, Arceus-Water, and opposing Kyogre.</li> <li>Tera Water lets Kyogre perform feats such as OHKOing Miraidon, Toxapex, Arceus-Water, and Eternatus with Water Spout or Origin Pulse with a layer of Spikes up.</li> <li>An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Def can be used to take on Arceus formes and switch into defensive Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Landorus-T better.</li> <li>Kyogre fits well on bulky offense. It has trouble getting onto the field and loses a significant part of its power if it takes a hit, so it should be paired with pivots such as Koraidon, Miraidon, and Landorus-T. They can bring Kyogre in on their incoming checks such as Arceus-Fairy and Skeledirge, Arceus-Ground, and Ting-Lu, respectively.</li> <li>Kyogre also greatly appreciates entry hazard removal, such as Defog support from Giratina-O and Corviknight, which keeps Water Spout at full power. Speed control options help Kyogre to wallbreak to its fullest, as it tends to have to take a hit before attacking thanks to its lower Speed, such as Thunder Wave from Arceus, Miraidon, Giratina-O, and Groudon, and Sticky Web from Masquerain.</li> <li>Entry hazards support from Ting-Lu and Clodsire is also appreciated to make sure Kyogre's attacks can cleanly OHKO most of their switch-ins. The aforementioned two Pokemon are also able to check Miraidon and Eternatus, both of which can come in on Kyogre and revenge-kill it. Koraidon can force Kyogre out and can switch into its Water-type attacks, so checks to Koraidon such as Skeledirge, Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Arceus-Fairy are also appreciated. That said, Kyogre can also predict Koraidon coming in and catch it with an Ice Beam, which is a clean OHKO on all Koraidon without bulk EVs.</li> <li>Kyogre can also be used as a solid offensive check to Arceus formes, as it can pivot into a Taunt or a Calm Mind and force them out with a strong Origin Pulse or Water Spout. Kyogre can also pivot into opposing Calm Mind Kyogre, forcing it out with Thunder.</li> </ul> "

Ice Beam lets Kyogre hit Miraidon, Koraidon, Eternatus, and Clodsire super effectively, which would otherwise freely switch into Kyogre. Tera Blast can be used if paired with Tera Ground to break through Clodsire, regardless of whether it has used Tera.</li> <li>Substitute can be used to set up on Clodsire, which cannot break it with Earthquake, and avoid status in general. Rest lets Kyogre repeatedly come in and absorb status, though it must be wary of Miraidon's Hadron Engine setting Electric Terrain.</li> <li>Tera Fairy flips Kyogre's matchup against Eternatus and Koraidon, letting Kyogre freely come in on Dragon-type moves and resist Koraidon's STAB attacks. Tera Ground lets Kyogre set up on Miraidon's Electro Drift, although it cannot take Draco Meteor well without previously having set up. Tera Poison is another option for becoming immune to Toxic from Clodsire, Toxapex, and Eternatus while also resisting Koraidon's Fighting-type attacks.</li> <li>Leftovers provides Kyogre with a form of recovery and gives it more chances to enter the field.</li> <li>The given EV spread lets Kyogre take on physical attackers like Groudon and Koraidon better while outspeeding some paralyzed +1 Arceus formes and paralyzed Zacian-C.</li> <li>Kyogre fits best on balance and bulky offense teams thanks to the defensive utility it provides as well as being a solid late-game wincon.</li> <li>Miraidon is a great partner for non-Rest variants of Kyogre, as it can break through Taunt and Calm Mind Arceus formes and pressure bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Arceus-Water. Miraidon can also use U-turn to bring Kyogre in on Ground-types that it can set up on, such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Ting-Lu and Groudon are solid partners for Kyogre, since they can set up Spikes to weaken Kyogre's checks, while also being able to switch into Electric-type attacks that threaten Kyogre. Physical attackers such as Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Chien-Pao, and Koraidon pair well with Kyogre, as they can use Kyogre's checks as an entry for them to start breaking, and Kyogre pressures all of their checks apart from Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Kyogre needs Koraidon eliminated before it can start setting up, as Kyogre is generally forced out by it and its STAB moves are weakened. As such, defensive Pokemon such as Skeledirge, Great Tusk, and Arceus-Fairy are solid partners that check Koraidon effectively. Finally, Kyogre has trouble coming in against faster offense teams, so partners that can pressure these teams such as Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Zacian-C are preferred.</li> </ul> "

U-turn is not boosted by STAB but cannot be blocked by Desolate Land. Coming from Primal Kyogre's high Special Attack, Scald does respectable damage against neutral targets and greatly threatens Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Mega Steelix; the threat of burn also deters physical wallbreakers like Mega Mewtwo X from switching in. If Scald burns are undesirable because they conflict with other status conditions, Origin Pulse is a strong alternative. Knock Off removes key items like Covert Cloak, Assault Vest, and Imposter Chansey's Eviolite, allowing Primal Kyogre to status foes and assisting offensive teammates like Lumina Crash users. Mortal Spin is useful to force chip damage on Imposter users and threats like Palkia-O, and it also benefits from most Steel-types fearing Scald, preventing them from spinblocking. Nuzzle is an alternative that is more effective into offensive threats like Magic Guard Mega Mewtwo X and Ho-Oh but is noticeably worse into defensive Pokemon. Stone Axe doesn't conflict with Scald and is easier to Imposter-proof, but it makes Primal Kyogre almost helpless against threats like Palkia-O and Arceus-Fire, meaning reliable checks to these like Ice Scales Arceus-Fairy and Fur Coat Miraidon are needed. Primal Kyogre is threatened by powerful physical wallbreakers like Mewtwo Mega X; thus, physical walls such as Fur Coat Miraidon, Yveltal, and Arceus-Poison are good teammates. Special attackers like Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Alakazam appreciate Primal Kyogre removing key items like Assault Vest and Covert Cloak from special walls like Arceus-Fairy and opposing Primal Kyogre, and they can also be Imposter-proofed by Primal Kyogre. Primal Kyogre can be tricky to Imposter-proof; depending on the moveset, some decent options are Ice Scales Dialga-O and Jungle Healing users.

Brave Bird makes short work of the aforementioned Fighting-types, as well as bulky Grass-types like Wo-Chien and Amoonguss, and threatens specially defensive Toxapex and Skeledirge with a 2HKO if they switch into it. Close Combat is what gives Staraptor its amazing wallbreaking potential, OHKOing Kingambit, Chien-Pao, Greninja, and Cyclizar while KOing Baxcalibur after Stealth Rock damage and threatening Iron Treads with a 2HKO. Final Gambit, boosted by 28 HP EVs, OHKOes targets Staraptor wouldn't otherwise beat, such as Rotom-W, physically defensive Toxapex, Hatterene, Klefki, and Forretress after Stealth Rock damage—denying dual screens and/or entry hazards from the last two. Alternatively, Double-Edge threatens checks like Rotom-W and Kilowattrel. Finally, U-turn allows this reckless bird to pivot into a teammate, if there really is nothing else it can do, such as against Gholdengo or Corviknight. Equipping a Choice Scarf will let it outspeed Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Walking Wake, which otherwise force it out, and threaten them instead.</p> <p>A great partner for Staraptor is Hisuian Zoroark.

Maushold is another great partner thanks to Tidy Up, which keeps both Stealth Rock and Reflect off the field for Staraptor to not worry about. Also, its Population Bomb can break through Ting-Lu and non-Rocky Helmet Toxapex for Staraptor. A less prominent partner that also provides hazard removal, as well as Knock Off support, is Cyclizar. With Stealth Rock breaking Sturdy and further advancing Staraptor's wallbreaking, Blissey is another highly appreciated teammate to set it up, provide Healing Wish and Heal Bell support, and check both Sandy Shocks and Choice Scarf Greninja for Staraptor. Indeedee, likewise, offers Healing Wish support, as well as checking Poison-types like Toxapex and Glimmora that Staraptor struggles with.

Moreover, its naturally high Speed tier alongside Swift Swim lets Floatzel outspeed the whole unboosted metagame under rain, giving it an edge against offensive teams by outpacing and threatening boosted frail threats like Dragapult, Volcarona, and every Speed-boosting Booster Energy Pokemon, such as Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake. Liquidation is a safer attack to keep Floatzel healthy when Wave Crash's power isn't necessary, such as against weak and neutral targets like Great Tusk, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge, and is the preferred attack to clean up late-game once the opposition is weakened enough. Aqua Jet picks off faster and boosted foes especially if rain isn't active, such as Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon, and outprioritizes Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Ceruledge's Shadow Sneak. Ice Spinner complements Floatzel's STAB moves to reliably hit the likes of Dragonite, Dragapult, Amoonguss, and Water Absorb Clodsire.</p> <p>Floatzel is exclusively found on offensive rain teams. Pelipper is a mandatory teammate to reliably set rain with Drizzle and compensate for Floatzel's frailty by bringing it in safely via U-turn. Choice Specs variants of Pelipper and other offensive rain partners like Azumarill, Walking Wake, and Greninja can keep up the pressure against the opposition, overwhelming shared checks like Dondozo, Toxapex, and Tera Water Garganacl. Ground-types like Iron Treads, Great Tusk, and Clodsire provide a necessary Electric immunity while setting entry hazards, making Dondozo and Toxapex easier to break through; Iron Treads and Great Tusk also provide Knock Off to cripple the bulky Water-types, including Alomomola and Tera Water Skeledirge, by making them susceptible to Stealth Rock as well, while Water Absorb Clodsire is a rigid defensive backbone against the likes of Azumarill, Walking Wake, and Tera Grass Volcarona, all of which can force Floatzel out. Eject Button Amoonguss can bring Floatzel in safely on Pokemon like Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Ting-Lu, incapacitate foes with Spore to give it more wallbreaking opportunities, and switch into and threaten Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl for Floatzel. Pawmot's Revival Blessing compensates for Floatzel's tendency to faint early-game from Wave Crash recoil—especially against common Rocky Helmet users like Corviknight and Amoonguss—and lets it wallbreak or even clean up in the late-game afterwards and enjoys Floatzel pressuring Great Tusk in return. Kingambit is a stellar late-game cleaner that enjoys Floatzel pressuring its checks in Great Tusk and Volcarona and overwhelming a common answer in Dondozo, as well as takes advantage of Floatzel fainting early-game from Wave Crash recoil to accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts.</p> "

Stealth Rock should only be used as Gastrodon's hazard of choice if it cannot be fit onto another team member. Sludge Bomb and Ice Beam both help to take care of Grass-types like Wo-Chien and Tsareena.

Storm Drain allows Gastrodon to counter rain by absorbing on Water-type attacks from Floatzel and Barraskewda as well as from other threats like Paldean Tauros-W and Tatsugiri while giving a boost to Gastrodon's attacks, though Gastrodon must Terastallize in order to handle the Paldean Tauros-W's Close Combat.

Clodsire completes the hazard stack core with Toxic Spikes and answers threats such as Meowscarada and Flutter Mane as well as setup sweepers like Hydreigon, Volcarona, and Gholdengo due to Unaware. Choice Scarf Great Tusk outpaces and deals with threats such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Baxcalibur, and Gallade; furthermore, Great Tusk removes Heavy-Duty Boots from common users like Sableye, Amoonguss, and Brambleghast with Knock Off, enhancing Gastrodon's hazard stacking. Garchomp's Fire-type coverage is valued for threatening roadblocks such as Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Breloom, and Sandy Shocks checks Water-types like Pelipper, Quaquaval, and Slowking as well as Corviknight. Iron Treads removes hazards with Rapid Spin, easing Gastrodon's pivoting if its held item were removed, and checks Fairy-types like Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, and Giga Drain Hatterene. Ting-Lu aids in setting hazards and wears down common pivots with Ruination and Whirlwind, taking advantage of both Pokemon's hazards.</p> "

Toxic better threatens defensive Pokemon such as opposing Gastrodon, Skeledirge, and Tornadus-T. Earthquake threatens Pokemon like Heatran, Clodsire, and Gholdengo. Relaxed should be selected as Gastrodon's nature if using Earthquake to not lower its damage output; Bold should be used otherwise. Tera Fairy can be used in a pinch to grant Gastrodon a resistance to Fighting against Urshifu-R and Barraskweda and a Dark resistance against Kingambit. The given EV spread maximizes Gastrodon's physical bulk to better take on the likes of Floatzel, Mega Swampert, and Urshifu-R. Gastrodon fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, which appreciate its defensive qualities while being able to supplement its passivity with offensive wallbreakers. Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Gholdengo can switch into Grass-type coverage from Pokemon like Kartana and Ferrothorn; In return, Gastrodon provides entry hazard support to wear down answers such as Mega Tyranitar, Kingambit, and Clodsire. Strong, fast wallbreakers like Mega Diancie, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta love having Gastrodon as a fallback measure against the myriad of Water-type revenge killers on rain such as Floatzel and Mega Swampert.

Acrobatics synergizes well with Unburden, allowing Drifloon to revenge kill a chipped Shellder or Numel. Drifloon is the only viable Defogger in LC, making it an invaluable tool for supporting teammates weak to entry hazards such as Wattrel or checking setup sweepers by removing dual screens. Drifloon's 4th moveslot can be filled by one of several utility options. Memento can be used to support a setup sweeper teammate or neutralize opposing ones, Endure lets Drifloon live an attack and activate Unburden, and Destiny Bond can be used to take out a dangerous attacker.

Setup sweepers like Shellder, Numel, and Grassy Seed Shroodle are good partners thanks to the setup opportunities provided by Will-O-Wisp and Memento.

Air Slash allows Drifblim to hit Normal-types and Dark-types neutrally while also potentially wearing down defensive Pokemon like Umbreon and Chansey with a combination of flinches and paralysis. Will-O-Wisp can help discourage physical attackers from switching in, such as Bombirdier and Lycanroc, and is useful to burn dangerous setup sweepers such as Coil Eelektross and Curse Muk.

Furthermore, Skuntank's great defensive typing makes it a solid switch-in for foes like Gogoat and Indeedee-F. Crunch is Skuntank's best way to hit targets such as Misdreavus and Indeedee-F, but if instead running only two attacks, Skuntank can use Poison Jab over Gunk Shot for a reliable attack alongside Sucker Punch. Taunt can stop moves from slower foes that may try to abuse or cripple Skuntank such as Tinkatuff's Thunder Wave, Carbink's Iron Defense or Trick Room, as well as entry hazards from both. Toxic is another way to threaten bulky threats like Misdreavus if not running Crunch, Carbink, Gogoat, and Alolan Persian. Toxic Spikes punishes foes that don't hold Heavy-Duty Boots such as Gabite and Choice item Basculin, although it can be less reliable with the abundance of Heavy-Duty Boots in the metagame. If Skuntank is no longer needed, Aftermath allows it to punish contact moves from foes like Honchkrow and Flapple. Tera Dark makes Sucker Punch a more reliable revenge killing option while further boosting Crunch's damage. Tera Ground allows Skuntank to serve as a Volt Switch blocker and pairs well with Tera Blast to hit opposing Skuntank and Tinkatuff. Tera Flying can lure Ground moves like Charizard and Dugtrio's Earthquake to more easily pick them off in addition to removing Skuntank's weakness to Ground.</p> <p>With Skuntank only weak to Ground-types like Whiscash, allies that can absorb Ground-type attacks such as Gogoat, Flapple, and Rotom-F come in handy. Whiscash also makes a good partner to help with threats like Alolan Dugtrio and Tinkatuff, while Skuntank can deal with said Grass-types. Skuntank's Toxic and Toxic Spikes pair well with bulky Pokemon like Dachsbun and Chansey to stall out foes. Dachsbun's Wish and Chansey's Heal Bell also help with longevity. Misdreavus is a notably great teammate, as it offers a Ground immunity, can cripple threats such as Gabite and Perrserker with Will-O-Wisp, and can spinblock. Misdreavus can also run Hex to benefit from any poisoned foes. Item removal, such as Banette's Knock Off and Indeedee-F's Trick, can get rid off foes' Heavy-Duty Boots to benefit Toxic Spikes. Indeedee-F can also help with Skuntank's longevity via Healing Wish, although it is notable that its Psychic Surge temporarily hinders Skuntank's Sucker Punch. While being the best Toxic Spikes setter, Skuntank is also the best way to remove Toxic Spikes with the lack of hazard removal in the metagame.

Skuntank's solid bulk and defensive typing can give it several opportunities to set up on common foes, like Gogoat and Choice-locked Indeedee-F, and give it a notable niche over other Dark-type Nasty Plot users like Houndoom and Alolan Persian. Running a special set also allows Skuntank to lure in physical walls such as Tinkatuff and Will-O-Wisp Misdreavus. Fire Blast rounds out Skuntank's offensive coverage to hit remaining threats like the previously mentioned Tinkatuff. Tera Ground with Tera Blast can be run instead to hit foes like Camerupt, Raichu, and opposing Skuntank harder, albeit at the cost of being more reliant on Terastallization. Otherwise, Tera Dark is preferred, as it helps make up for Dark Pulse's sometimes underwhelming power. Terastallizing also removes Skuntank's Ground weakness, giving it an easier time against Whiscash and Gabite. Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers both help with Skuntank's longevity, giving it more chances to set up and sweep.</p> <p>Since Skuntank's Speed is average, it appreciates teammates that can lower foes' Speed such as Sticky Web Masquerain and Thunder Wave Tinkatuff and Misdreavus. Masquerain can also give Skuntank chances to set up thanks to Intimidate and U-turn, as well as Tinkatuff with Encore. Other pivots such as Lumineon and Rotom-F can help bring in Skuntank safely for setup opportunities, especially alongside their support moves in Encore, Will-O-Wisp, and Trick. This can also be accomplished by Memento users such as Alolan Dugtrio. Skuntank pairs well with other setup move users such as Bulk Up Gogoat and Dragon Dance Flapple, being able to wallbreak or clean for one another based on the matchup. Skuntank can also absorb Toxic and Will-O-Wisp for them, while, in return, they help against Ground-types such as Whiscash and Gabite, which can stop Skuntank from sweeping. Pokemon like Raichu and Lycanroc-N can also help lure in and wear down opposing Ground-types throughout the match. Psychic-types like Indeedee-F and Rabsca benefit from Skuntank's matchup against foes like Misdreavus and physical Skuntank. Furthermore, Indeedee-F's Healing Wish can give Skuntank a second chance to sweep, while Psychic Surge hinders Honchkrow's Sucker Punch and Spidop's First Impression.

Gunk Shot helps make up for Skuntank's underwhelming offensive stats and pairs well with Crunch for great neutral coverage. Skuntank can utilize its Speed to Toxic fast bulky foes like Alolan Persian and walls like Whiscash, Misdreavus, and Terastallized Gogoat. Skuntank's Speed can also help it set up Toxic Spikes as soon as possible, although neither Toxic nor Toxic Spikes are optimal moves to be Choice-locked in to. Memento provides momentum if Skuntank is not needed anymore, being able to bring in teammates that are frail or can take advantage of the foe to set up. Foul Play is another option to hit strong physical attackers like Lycanroc-N and Perrserker, even OHKOing Dugtrio. Tera Dark powers up Skuntank's Dark STAB moves, and Tera Flying makes it immune to Ground-type attacks like Alolan Dugtrio's Earthquake.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types like Whiscash and Quaxwell appreciate Skuntank's Grass resistance and are good against its common switch-ins such as Tinkatuff, Gabite, and Carbink. Whiscash can also provide entry hazards, while Quaxwell can remove them while also benefiting from Skuntank removing Toxic Spikes. Due to Skuntank being one of the slower Choice Scarf users, priority move users like Basculin and paralysis spreaders like Tinkatuff provide additional speed control. This is especially helpful due to the presence of common faster sweepers like Rain Dance Golduck and +1 Dragon Dance Charizard. Defensive checks to these sweepers are also recommended such as Lumineon and Gabite, respectively. Setup sweepers like Quiver Dance Masquerain, Nasty Plot Raichu, and Swords Dance Alolan Dugtrio greatly benefit from Skuntank's Memento giving them a chance to set up. Alternatively, they can serve as wallbreakers, while Skuntank cleans up the match afterwards. Frail teammates such as Pyroar and Zangoose also appreciate Memento for a safe switch in.

Rough Skin adds to the support Gabite provides, helping it further wear down physical threats like Basculin and Zangoose for its teammates to finish off. Stone Edge nails Charizard and Articuno and also hits Rotom-F. Dragon Tail is useful against setup sweepers like Gogoat and Tera Fighting Carbink, but Gabite can use Swords Dance instead to double as a bulky wallbreaker. The investment in bulk lets Gabite avoid the 2HKO from Lycanroc-N's Play Rough after Stealth Rock and Charizard's Hurricane at full. 28 Speed EVs allow Gabite to outspeed defensive Misdreavus.

Dragon Tail helps with removing setup sweepers or passive Pokemon that Gabite can't deal with such as Gogoat, Misdreavus, or Vigoroth. However, its phazing ability is also impactful when there are entry hazards on the opponent's field. Rest gives Gabite recovery, while Sleep Talk keeps it from being too passive. 28 Speed allows it to outspeed non-invested Misdreavus, while 116 Special Defense makes Special Charizard's Hurricane a 3HKO. It still has enough physical bulk for Lycanroc-N's Play Rough to only be a 3HKO after Stealth Rock damage. Gabite has the ability to turn into a spinblocker with Tera Ghost, making it an option to keep its team's hazards stay on the field. Tera Fairy helps cover its Dragon-type weakness, which Dragonair and Flapple can exploit, while also providing it a resistance to the strong Dark-types in PU like Alolan Persian, Skuntank, and Houndoom.

In return, Gabite helps them with an Electric immunity from the likes of Raichu and Rotom-S. Tinkatuff and Perrserker can also help with these threats as well as covering Gabite's other issues with Flapple and Dragonair. Gabite does well at coming in on the premier Fire-type attackers in the tier: Charizard, Pyroar, and Houndoom. Offensive teammates such as Gogoat, Sawsbuck, and Nasty Plot Rotom-F appreciate its presence on their team as a switch-in for the aforementioned Fire-types, or else they struggle to set up. With many of the tier's top Pokemon having a 4x weakness to Rock, such as Articuno, Charizard, and Masquerain, Gabite can pair well with them, because it walls the likes of Lycanroc-N and Dugtrio which typically carry Rock coverage.</p> "

Its typing and solid natural bulk grant it it multiple setup opportunities, such as in the face of Volcarona, Mega Tyranitar, non-Toxic Heatran, and Zapdos. Scale Shot's multi-hit nature makes it effective against Dragonite and Substitute users like Kyurem and Seperior, as well as offensive teams supported by Cyclizar's Shed Tail. Most importantly, the Speed boost lets Mega Garchomp outpace would-be revenge killers like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, Tapu Koko, and—if it decides not to Mega Evolve yet—Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, allowing it to potentially clean up late-game. Fire Fang hits Skarmory, Corviknight, Tangrowth, and cleanly OHKOes Ferrothorn at +2. Mega Garchomp works well on offensive teams, ranging from offense to hyper offense. Pivots like Tapu Koko, Dragapult, Tornadus-T, and Victini give Mega Garchomp easy entry, bringing it onto their switch-ins such as Clodsire, Toxapex, Heatran, and Skeledirge, respectively. Tapu Fini provides Misty Terrain to prevent Mega Garchomp from being crippled by the aforementioned walls—at the cost of weakening its Scale Shot, however—as well as a switch-in to Ice Shard users like Baxcalibur and Weavile that can revenge kill Mega Garchomp easily. Dual screens and Shed Tail support from Tapu Koko or Grimmsnarl and Cyclizar give Mega Garchomp more setup opportunities. Setup sweepers such as Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Dragonite enjoy Mega Garchomp pressuring foes like Skeledirge and Toxapex. Special wallbreakers like the aforementioned Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Dragapult help against physical walls such as Dondozo and Tera Water Skeledirge that Mega Garchomp struggles with; Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain also prevents Mega Garchomp's sweep from being cut short by priority attacks from the likes of Weavile, Mega Lopunny, and Kingambit.</p> "

Notably, it matches up well against common spinners like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Glimmora, especially as it can punish them from doing so with Rocky Helmet + Rough Skin. This combination is also valuable to spread chip damage onto physical attackers like Kingambit and Dragonite and punish pivots such as Cinderace and Corviknight. Dragon Tail forces out setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Tera Flying Kingambit, and Air Balloon Gholdengo, and it works extremely well to force entry hazard damage onto foes such as Tera Fairy Garganacl, Dondozo, and Iron Valiant. Tera Ghost is used to completely spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Tera Steel lets it emergency check Dragapult, Meowscarada, and block Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Tera Water allows it to deal with Gholdengo, Scizor, and Hatterene better.</p> <p>Garchomp fits best on hazard stacking teams that range from bulky offense to offense. Gholdengo is a near-necessary teammate that can prevent most attempts of entry hazard removal, and it can make use of them itself to chip down checks like Tera Water Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Knock Off users like Meowscarada and Great Tusk can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Amoonguss, Kingambit, and Dragonite to make them susceptible to Garchomp's entry hazards; Great Tusk in particular provides Rapid Spin as well, which removes entry hazards on your side of the field and subsequently maintains your own entry hazards up the opponent's side. Offensive Pokemon like Greninja, Dragapult, and Iron Valiant tend to force multiple switches and enjoy entry hazards chipping down their checks such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Garganacl. Substitute Skeledirge is a fantastic teammate that can take advantage of entry hazards itself, use its defensive profile to cover Fairy- and Ice-types like Iron Valiant and Alolan Ninetales, threaten Defog Corviknight from removing entry hazards, and pressure Hatterene, which would otherwise prevent Garchomp's antics and use it as setup fodder.</p> "

Great Tusk and Dondozo in particular are hit hard by Draco Meteor, with Great Tusk pressured while switching in to remove entry hazards and Dondozo's Unaware letting Garchomp freely use Draco Meteor multiple times on it. Fire Blast covers Steel-type Pokemon such as Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo, the former of which would otherwise switch into Garchomp and clear entry hazards. Stealth Rock is generally preferred if a team does not have another Stealth Rock user, but Spikes can be used to capitalize on the switches that Garchomp forces. A Rash nature makes Garchomp much harder to switch into, even letting it OHKO defensive Great Tusk after one layer of Spikes, but Naive can be used to outspeed Hydreigon and Speed tie opposing Garchomp. Tera Fire is the preferred Tera type, due to it powering up Garchomp's Fire Blast and providing it a resistance to attacks such as Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Hatterene's Draining Kiss, as well as an immunity to Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W, Dragapult, and Skeledirge. Tera Steel similarly flips Garchomp's type matchup, providing it with a useful Dragon and Fairy resistance while maintaining its Stealth Rock resistance.</p> <p>Garchomp fits on offensive teams thanks to its ability to set entry hazards and wear down common defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Dondozo, with Life Orb-boosted attacks while keeping entry hazards up against common hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight. Sweepers such as Kingambit, Dragon Dance Dragapult, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Bulk Up Great Tusk appreciate Garchomp breaking holes in the opposing team early-game. Garchomp is forced out by Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Tera Fairy Garganacl, as well as Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Roaring Moon without using Terastallization, so support from Steel-type partners is appreciated to switch into these Pokemon. Kingambit is another good partner because it takes on Dragapult and appreciates Garchomp wearing down Great Tusk and Dondozo. Hatterene and Tera Fairy Skeledirge can also take on these Dragon-types while spreading further passive damage with Magic Bounce or Will-O-Wisp. Garchomp can also form a hazard stacking core with lead Meowscarada or other Stealth Rock users such as Great Tusk and Ting-Lu, and Garchomp can pressure common Rapid Spin users. Gholdengo is a great partner for Garchomp, since it blocks most forms of hazard removal while appreciating Garchomp soft checking Iron Moth. Garchomp is also prone to being worn down quickly thanks to Life Orb recoil, entry hazards, and being prediction reliant, so teammates that can clear hazards are appreciated. These include Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads, which all appreciate Garchomp wearing down their common switch-ins such as opposing Great Tusk and Rotom-W.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Garchomp makes for a powerful physical wallbreaker with Swords Dance, using its Attack boosts to ensure OHKOs against a number of foes in the metagame. Garchomp’s incredible STAB combination of Dragon / Ground can annihilate most walls and defensive cores at +2, with Earthquake reliably knocking out bulky Pokemon like Toxapex, Kingambit, defensive Gholdengo, and Garganacl, and Dragon Claw hitting a vast majority of foes that resist Earthquake, such as Rotom-W and Breloom. Dragon Claw is preferred to Outrage, as it doesn’t provide free switch-in opportunities to prominent Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene. Substitute is essential for letting Garchomp block incoming status, especially from foes it cannot always OHKO, such as Skeledirge, non-Foul Play Amoonguss, and Rotom-W. Substitute can be set up on a forced switch to ensure Garchomp gets a chance to use Swords Dance, and can be set up for free against U-turns from slow pivots like Corviknight. Leftovers allows Garchomp to heal off Substitute damage, giving it more chances to use it. With Rough Skin, Garchomp punishes Great Tusk using Rapid Spin and U-turn from pivots like Cinderace. Tera Ground allows Garchomp to hit much harder with Earthquake, giving it the extra power to OHKO Hatterene, Garganacl after Stealth Rock chip, and potentially Amoonguss and offensive Great Tusk sets at +2. Alternatively, Tera Steel is a more defensive option used to resist Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Dragapult's Draco Meteor, the latter being very important, as Infiltrator allows it to bypass Garchomp’s Substitute.</p> <p>Garchomp is a solid wallbreaker on balance and bulky offense teams, due to its power complemented by defensive utility from Substitute, Leftovers, and decent bulk that gives it opportunities for consistent use throughout a battle. Garchomp mainly struggles against Corviknight, as well as exceptionally bulky physical walls such as Dondozo and Great Tusk. Special wallbreakers like Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth threaten these walls to Garchomp and therefore make excellent partners. Dragapult can also provide much-needed special offense while pressuring Dondozo and Corviknight with Draco Meteor and Flamethrower, forming a dangerous Dragon-type spam core with Garchomp and providing speed control that Garchomp cannot, especially against foes like Iron Valiant and Greninja. Additionally, Dragapult can use U-turn to scout a forced switch and safely bring Garchomp into battle against foes like Clodsire and Kingambit. Entry hazard setters like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora are great partners, as they allow Garchomp to secure KOs against opponents like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Amoonguss, which it otherwise cannot OHKO at +2. Glimmora and Great Tusk are especially good for this role, as they can both remove hazards that hinder Garchomp’s wallbreaking potential, and the latter can cripple Corviknight by removing its Leftovers with Knock Off. Fast sweepers, such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult, can easily revenge kill Garchomp, especially when its Substitute is down. A defensive backbone made up of Pokemon like Clodsire and Corviknight is essential for Garchomp’s team. Lastly, Garchomp gives great support to late-game and sweepers like Dragapult that appreciate foes like defensive Gholdengo, Toxapex, and Clodsire being removed.</p> "

Garchomp's strong matchup against common entry hazard removers such as Quaquaval, Cinderace, and Well-Baked Body Iron Treads makes it an excellent Stealth Rock setter. Alternatively, if a teammate already carries Stealth Rock, Garchomp can use Spikes to apply more pressure to offensive teams. Dragon Tail deters setup sweepers such as Zamazenta-C and walls such as Corviknight and Ground immunity Iron Treads from taking advantage of Garchomp, while Rock Slide allows Garchomp to hit threats such as Enamorus-T, Zapdos, and Earth Eater Skeledirge. Corviknight is a brilliant partner for Garchomp, taking on dangerous physical attackers such as Galarian Zapdos and Chien-Pao for it, while Garchomp covers its Fire and Electric weaknesses. Blissey can take on the special attackers that can overwhelm Garchomp, such as Sheer Force Iron Moth, Choice Specs Zapdos, and Greninja. Iron Moth checks various threats to Garchomp, such as Corviknight, Scream Tail, and Enamorus-T, and it appreciates Garchomp's ability to beat Hisuian Arcanine and RegenVest users such as Meloetta.

A Naive nature allows Garchomp to offensively check Sandy Shocks, Thundurus-T, and the crowded base 100 Speed tier without weakening its attacks. A Naive nature is preferred over Hasty to allow Garchomp to better switch in on common hazard removers. Offensive threats like Iron Moth, Chien-Pao, and Galarian Zapdos greatly appreciate the presence of mixed Garchomp, which disincentivizes common defensive pieces from entering the battle, and for its entry hazards. Similarly, more defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Unaware Scream Tail also appreciate Garchomp outspeeding and heavily damaging offensive threats like non-Choice Scarf Slither Wing, Hisuian Arcanine, and Galarian Zapdos. Mixed Garchomp is vulnerable to faster threats that force it out with super effective moves, like Chien-Pao and Pixilate Scream Tail, and U-turn users that swing momentum in their favor, such as Meowscarada, Iron Moth, and Roaring Moon: slow, bulky pivots that help combat these weaknesses and turn momentum back in your favor, such as Corviknight, RegenVest Meloetta, and slow Iron Treads, are recommended.</p> "

Its superb bulk enables it to check some of the metagame’s most dangerous threats in Pawmot, Salamence, Tyranitar, and Sandy Shocks. It also provides value through Sand Stream to help combat rain teams if given momentum to get in freely, as it can't hard switch into Water-types. Stone Edge enables Hippowdon to pressure Flying-types like Iron Jugulis and Salamence, in addition to being able to beat Taunt Dragon Dance Tyranitar even after it Terastallizes. Roar is also an option, as it allows Hippowdon to phaze setup sweepers like Polteageist in a pinch and synergizes well with entry hazards. Leftovers is the preferred item, as its residual healing improves Hippowdon's overall longevity and preserves Slack Off's PP. The given spread with an Impish nature and Leftovers avoids a 2HKO from Life Orb Pawmot and prevents Hippowdon from being KOed by Hurricane into Draco Meteor from Salamence after Stealth Rock while avoiding a 2HKO from Sandy Shocks without Stealth Rock. Rocky Helmet is also an option to punish physical attackers, primarily U-turn users and Maushold. A specially defensive spread is an option to handle Gengar if Pawmot is less of a concern. Tera Rock pairs well with its sand, as the Special Defense boost it receives gives it a strong matchup versus special attackers like Gengar, Salamence, and Noivern. Additionally, Tera Rock boosts Hippowdon’s Stone Edge to put more pressure on targets like Salamence. After Hippowdon has Terastallized, it is threatened by Pawmot, Sandy Shocks, and Tyranitar, so be careful when Terastallizing. Tera Ghost is an option that makes Hippowdon a strong response versus Slither Wing, Lucario, and Maushold and lets it spinblock against Donphan. Tera Fairy is an option that grants Hippowdon a generally good defensive typing, including a Fighting resistance, and makes it less vulnerable to Greninja. After becoming a Fairy- or a Ghost-type, Hippowdon is unable to check Gengar, and in the case of the latter, Tyranitar sets running Crunch as well. Tera Dragon makes Hippowdon an effective answer to rain teams through the useful Water-type resistance it provides.</p> <p>Hippowdon most commonly fits on bulky offense or balance teams for its walling capabilities. Talonflame and Noivern make for good partners, as they are capable of grabbing momentum with U-turn off of opposing Decidueye and Wo-Chien swapping in to exploit Hippowdon. Hippowdon can in return easily absorb Knock Off from the likes of Tinkaton in order to preserve the Heavy-Duty Boots they both depend on. Wo-Chien is also a solid pick for a partner as a nice fit on most balance teams, as well as an answer to bulky Water-types that may attempt to annoy Hippowdon. In particular, Wo-Chien’s RestTalk set is capable of swapping in on Quagsire easily, as it is able to shrug off Toxic. Wo-Chien can also relieve pressure from Hippowdon, as it can take on Sandy Shocks. Tinkaton also makes for a good partner, as it is able to take a lot of the pressure off of Hippowdon by taking hits from Gengar and specially offensive Flying-types such as Iron Jugulis, Noivern, and Salamence. Tinkaton is also capable of providing useful Knock Off support by removing opposing Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots to enable Hippowdon’s Stealth Rock and sandstorm damage to stick. In return, Hippowdon being able to carry Stealth Rock means that Tinkaton does not need to run it itself and can fit a more useful option. Assault Vest Cyclizar is able to check Greninja and Wo-Chien for Hippowdon and keep Spikes or Toxic Spikes off the field from the former.</p> "

Whirlwind phazes foes that attempt to set up in front of Hippowdon, such as Swords Dance Koraidon, Bulk Up Great Tusk, and Swords Dance Tera Flying Kingambit, while also potentially deterring setup attempts by attackers that could expect to force it out, like Miraidon and Chien-Pao. Tera Fairy resists Koraidon's Fighting-type STAB moves and is immune to Koraidon's Outrage and Miraidon's Draco Meteor. Alternatively, Tera Water provides a resistance to attacks such as Koraidon's Flare Blitz, Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash and Ice Spinner, and Palafin's Wave Crash. Hippowdon benefits from being paired with Pokemon able to take on Chien-Pao for it, such as Toxapex and Garganacl, with the former also being able to absorb Toxic Spikes for Hippowdon and the latter benefitting from a Special Defense boost from sand. Special walls such as Clodsire, specially defensive Corviknight, and Blissey are essential to take on dangerous special attackers like Miraidon, Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, and Walking Wake for Hippowdon. Teammates able to set entry hazards are also appreciated to allow chip damage to quickly rack up when paired with sand, Rocky Helmet, and Whirlwind. Between Earthquake and Whirlwind, Hippowdon is unable to touch Air Balloon Gholdengo, so counterplay to it, such as Ruination Ting-Lu and Kingambit, is recommended. Offensive Houndstone is a very niche potential partner that notably benefits from being paired with Hippowdon thanks to Sand Rush, which somewhat offsets the issue of its low Speed, potentially allowing a boosted Last Respects to clean up an opponent's team.</p> "

Even beyond the simple type matchup chart changes, it allows Hippowdon to more easily check its targets such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and Mega Diancie. Maximum Special Defense EVs are ran due to Hippowdon having more valuable special targets than physical, namely the aforementioned Pokemon. Mega Lopunny and Tornadus-T appreciate Hippowdon's presence, as it checks both Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Zapdos while setting up Stealth Rock to help wear down their checks. Defensively, Hippowdon supports Pokemon such as Garganacl and Skarmory; Garganacl appreciates the sand and its attached benefits and Skarmory appreciates the sturdy Ground-type anchor and special wall. Hippowdon struggles to fend off strong physical attackers like Kingambit, Mega Scizor, Kartana, and Mega Gyarados. For this reason, it pairs exquisitely with strong physical walls such as Skarmory and Buzzwole. Hippowdon also suffers from a Spikes vulnerability, meaning it appreciates Defog support from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Zapdos.</p> "

Tera Fighting Toxicroak can run a Modest nature to give it a favorable chance to 2HKO Muk at +2 with Focus Blast; however, it becomes noticeably slower, getting outpaced by Mabosstiff, Bombirdier, and Braviary.

This pairs well with Encore impairing Pokemon such as Whiscash or Masquerain attempting to set up entry hazards or boost their stats. Storm Drain allows Lumineon to blanket check some Water-type attackers such as Choice-locked Basculin and Golduck. Tera Grass is normally preferred, giving Lumineon a resistance to Grass- and Electric-type attacks that it would otherwise fear from Pokemon such as Gogoat and Raichu. Alternatively, Tera Dragon can give the same resistances as well as an added resistance to Fire-type attacks in exchange for a resistance to Ground-type attacks. Tera Ghost is an option to wall Quaxwell and check offensive Normal-types such as Zangoose and Pyroar better. Lumineon normally uses a specially defensive EV spread with a Calm nature to take on threats such as Pyroar, Houndoom, and Alolan Persian well, but a more physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature allows Lumineon to take on physically offensive foes such as Dragon Dance Charizard, Basculin, and Perrserker better.</p> <p>Lumineon's best partners are ones that appreciate having a pivot to tank hits for them and allow them in safely as well as ones that enjoy Lumineon's ability to tank Water-type attacks.

Fire-types like Charizard and Pyroar form a strong core with Lumineon, with Lumineon absorbing the Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Basculin they fear, and in return they break Grass-type threats like Gogoat and Sawsbuck that Lumineon would struggle against. Other Pokemon with pivoting moves such as Alolan Persian, Perrserker, and Electrode can form a VoltTurn core with Lumineon, with Alolan Persian in particular completing a powerful defensive core with by tanking physical hits Lumineon can normally struggle with.

While Wood Hammer is more powerful, Seed Bomb can be used over it to still threaten Blissey without recoil. Ice Shard picks off weakened, faster threats like Scyther, Hisuian Sneasel, and Lilligant.

Articuno acts as a hard wall for Abomasnow, as it gets a Defense boost in snow and access to Haze. Pokemon like Magneton and Rotom can take advantage of Articuno by threatening it with Volt Switch to obtain momentum and crippling it with Trick, respectively. Pyroar also deals with Articuno quite well with Taunt, blocking Articuno’s Roost, in combination with Will-O Wisp, which lets Pyroar chip away at it.</p> "

Cloyster is able to survive a Choice Band-boosted Sacred Sword from Chien-Pao under snow and hit it back with a +2 Rock Blast. Baxcalibur is able to survive an Iron Head from Kingambit and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Chien-Pao acts as a strong wallbreaker that appreciates being able to take hits under snow due to its frailty. Frosmoth deals with the Water-type matchup along with Abomasnow, being able to set up a Quiver Dance and sweep the opposing team. The snow also allows the aforementioned setup sweepers to survive revenge killing attempts from foes such as Sucker Punch Kingambit and Extreme Speed Dragonite.

Volt Switch lets Magnezone maintain momentum while eliminating foes such as Skarmory and chipping Heatran, which cannot be trapped and removed consistently. Alternatively, Tera Blast + Tera Fighting lets Magnezone remove Kingambit, potentially forcing it to Terastallize as well. Hidden Power Fire hits foes such as the aforementioned Mega Scizor, Kartana, and Ferrothorn. Toxic is another alternative that punishes switch-ins such as Gastrodon, Ting-Lu, and Hippowdon, though it can be difficult to justify over other alternatives, as it hinders Magnezone's effectiveness as a trapper. Magnezone should only Terastallize when it can trap and eliminate Kingambit, since teammates such as Dragapult and Dragonite take advantage of Tera better. The given EV spread allows Magnezone to survive an unboosted Sacred Sword from Kartana. Teammates such as Dragonite and Kartana appreciate Magnezone removing foes such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, allowing them to sweep easier. The former can also safely switch into Ground-type attacks for Magnezone, while the latter threatens troublesome Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Teammates such as Dragapult and Landorus-T provide pivoting support for Magnezone, granting it free entry against foes such as Skarmory and Kingambit to ease prediction.

Its lack of use for its item slot after its activation combined with its Spikes immunity allows Gliscor to withstand weaker Knock Off attempts from Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. Gliscor can use its longevity to act as an excellent Defog user, as it can outlast common Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl. Alternatively, Gliscor can opt for Stealth Rock if its team prefers it over Defog. Roost keeps Gliscor healthy alongside Poison Heal, allowing it to drain the PP of moves such as Heatran's Magma Storm and Garganacl's Salt Cure. Toxic allows Gliscor to pressure common entry hazard setters and Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T. It also allows Gliscor to cripple offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult and Tapu Lele in a pinch. Tera Fairy gives Gliscor a generally solid defensive typing with few weaknesses, although at the cost of its Spikes immunity. The given HP EVs maximize Gliscor's recovery from Poison Heal and special bulk, with the remainder in Speed to outspeed Rotom-W. Gliscor fits best on defensive teams that appreciate its immense survivability and great support options. As such, Gliscor pairs well with sturdy physical and special walls, such as Skeledirge, Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Clodsire, since its relatively unremarkable bulk puts it at risk of being overwhelmed often. In return, it can switch into weak attacks with problematic secondary effects, such as Toxapex's Scald and Garganacl's Salt Cure, as well as help teammates keep their held items by absorbing Knock Off. Pokemon weak to entry hazards such as Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Garganacl pair well with Gliscor's Defog support, while they act as threatening late-game wincons after Gliscor has worn down their checks.

Tera Fairy allows Gliscor to leverage a typing with few exploitable weaknesses, given Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo fear its Earthquake, while Tera Water improves Gliscor's matchup against Pokemon like Volcarona and Urshifu-R. However, it comes with more exploitable weaknesses, given the prominence of Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Ferrothorn. Gliscor fits best on balance and fat teams, which appreciate its ability to tear through opposing defensive cores while providing enough of a defensive backbone in return to facilitate this. Pokemon like Toxapex, Skarmory, and Gholdengo can exploit Gliscor's temporary checks such as Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Buzzwole, generating progress of their own. On the flip side, revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Dragapult can threaten offensive teams, given Gliscor's tendency to be overwhelmed when facing multiple strong wallbreakers.

          "description": "<p>Gallade is the premier Choice Scarf user on Psychic teams due to its great coverage options and incredible ability, Sharpness. Being able to fire off Sharpness-boosted Sacred Sword is incredibly valuable, as it hits the Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that give Psychic teams trouble for super effective damage, such as Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Hisuian Goodra. Knock Off is a great way to make progress against bulkier teams, as well as dissuade Ghost-type Pokemon from switching in on a potential Sacred Sword. Night Slash is also an option to deal more consistent damage to Skeledirge and Gholdengo. Leaf Blade is used to threaten bulky Water-type Pokemon like Quagsire and Rotom-W, as well as OHKO Belly Drum Azumarill. Aqua Cutter is an option over Leaf Blade to hit Pokemon like Landorus, Volcarona and Moltres for super effective damage, but Leaf Blade is often better due to the amount of targets it hits. A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant, as it allows Gallade to outspeed and still OHKO Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Sneasler, while the extra attack from Adamant is not necessary as most of the moves Gallade uses receive a Sharpness boost.</p> <p>Espathra is a nice compliment to Gallade, as it appreciates Gallade's ability to deal with Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon like Gholdengo, Hisuian Goodra, Kingambit, and Ting-Lu, which Espathra has little way of hitting for even neutral damage, as well as its ability to remove special walls such as Galarian Slowking and Alolan Muk. Hoopa-U is also a great teammate for Gallade, as the speed of Gallade and sheer power of Hoopa-U synergize nicely to deal with both bulky and fast teams. Hoopa-U is able to threaten an OHKO on defensive staples such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Rotom-W with entry hazard support, while Gallade outspeeds Pokemon that would otherwise shut Hoopa-U down, such as Sneasler and Greninja. Armarouge is a strong partner for Gallade, as it provides a nice resistance to Fairy-type attacks and complementary coverage to Gallade's. Armarouge appreciates the removal of special walls such as Hisuian Goodra and Galarian Slowking, allowing it to set up and apply pressure to the opposing team, and it returns the favor by taking out physically bulky foes such as Dondozo, Zamazenta, and Corviknight. Hatterene is Psychic teams' best form of hazard control, which Gallade appreciates as it tends to switch in frequently and can otherwise get chipped. Hatterene also lures in Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon like Iron Treads and Sneasler, which Gallade can take care of. Indeedee is another good teammate for Gallade, as it sets up Psychic Terrain, further strengthening Gallade's Psycho Cut and protecting it from priority moves like Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch. Indeedee also provides a valuable Ghost immunity, which prevents foes like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo from freely spamming Shadow Ball. Scream Tail is a great defensive teammate for Gallade, as its incredible bulk allows it to switch in to common Choice Scarf users such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Meowscarada, which would otherwise outspeed and OHKO Gallade. Scream Tail's access to a myriad of utility moves, such as Thunder Wave and Wish, allows it to support Gallade nicely by slowing down the aforementioned threats and increasing its longevity. Mew is a good teammate for Gallade on more offense-oriented teams, as lead Mew is the premier hazard setter for Psychic teams, and Gallade greatly appreciates the support. Galarian Slowking is a great teammate for Gallade as well, as it is able to safely switch into special attacks, as well as Fairy-type attacks that would otherwise give Gallade trouble. Galarian Slowking can also utilize Chilly Reception to give Gallade a free switch in.</p> "

Zen Headbutt beautifully complements a Fighting-type STAB move, as it lets Mega Gallade easily break through any opposing Poison-types that may be annoying walls such as Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Clodsire. Knock Off is another tool in Mega Gallade's arsenal, which lets it take care of Psychic- and Ghost-types—such as Gholdengo, Slowbro, and Aegislash—and wears down Celesteela into range of Close Combat finishing it off. Triple Axel is another option to easily take care of Flying-types such as Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Enamorus. Shadow Sneak can also be considered to pick off faster weakened threats such as Gengar, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Mega Alakazam.

Mega Gallade is also easily revenge killed by faster offensive threats such as Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf Blacephalon, so Assault Vest Iron Hands is a good check to stop these in their tracks and deal good damage back while also being able to pivot in Mega Gallade with Volt Switch.

Tera Dark makes Froslass immune to Grimmsnarl's Prankster Taunt, whereas Tera Steel blocks Glimmora's Mortal Spin. Froslass should be used on hyper offense teams to support dangerous setup sweepers such as Calm Mind + Agility Miraidon, Swords Dance + Flame Charge Koraidon, and Swords Dance Chien-Pao by weakening opposing Pokemon with Spikes.

Taunt prevents hazards and status from foes such as Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, and is also used to deny Defog from Corviknight or Talonflame. However, it must be careful as most Corviknight and Talonflame can simply attack Froslass for super effective damage. When paired with Focus Sash, Taunt increases the chances of Froslass taking an opponent down with Destiny Bond, but it can also be used in tandem with Mental Herb to punish opponents like Sableye, Grimmsnarl, and opposing Froslass that attempt to Taunt Froslass, Taunting them in return. Spikes serves to punish switches on the opponent's side and weaken their team, allowing for Froslass's teammates to clean late-game. Shadow Ball is Froslass's answer to Hatterene, 2HKOing it as it comes in to bounce Spikes back, and it's Froslass's main source of damage to prevent it from being too passive. Froslass's last moveslot can utilize Destiny Bond to take an opponent down with it, but Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are also options to consider as they allow you to status Pokemon that like to play around Destiny Bond, such as Kingambit and Volcarona. Focus Sash is the preferred item as it ensures that Froslass will always get at least one layer of Spikes up, but Mental Herb can also be used to ignore Taunt from faster leads while Heavy Duty-Boots allows Froslass to safely switch back in to block spinners such as Cyclizar and Quaquaval.</p> <p>All of Froslass's teammates appreciate it spreading Spikes on the opposing field and preventing hazards from going up on theirs. After Spikes, Choice Band Chien Pao 2HKOes Iron Hands, while Shell Smash Cloyster and Belly Drum Cetitan can attempt to set up and sweep without fear of getting stopped by an opposing Focus Sash. Baxcalibur benefits from Froslass paralyzing faster threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, enabling it to outspeed and take them out, though Froslass needs an intact Focus Sash for this. Similarily, Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Iron Defense Avalugg also benefit from the opportunities to set up against foes that have been burned by Froslass and no longer pose much of a threat to it. Avalugg can also support Froslass by switching into strong physical attacks to scout. Abomasnow's Snow Warning increases Froslass's physical bulk and makes it less wary of other attacks coming from spinners, such as Great Tusk's Knock Off.</p> "

Stored Power deals with Unaware and Water Absorb users such as Quagsire and Clodsire, letting it threaten the entirety of Ground teams in conjunction with Hydro Pump. Substitute lets it avoid status and take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Klefki and Toxapex, eases prediction, and forces its checks such as Greninja and Ting-Lu to take damage. The given EV spread prevents Rotom-W's Substitute from breaking to Clodsire's Poison Jab while outspeeding threats such as Gholdengo and Kleavor.</p> <p>Teammates such as Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks and Iron Hands love Rotom-W's ability to deal with or wear down bulky Pokemon such as Clodsire and Gastrodon, allowing them to clean up types like Poison and Water late-game. In return, Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks deals with fast threats such as Choice Specs Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Scovillain, while Iron Hands pressures matchups such as Dark and Dragon due to its sheer bulk and coverage in Ice Punch. Pawmot can revive Rotom-W with Revival Blessing, which allows it to take more risks. Additionally, Pawmot has good coverage moves in Seed Bomb and Ice Punch, which lets it break down types such as Water, Flying, and Ground alongside Rotom-W. Choice Specs Kilowattrel deals with fast threats such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Choice Specs Greninja, and Volcarona, removes Grass-types like Amoonguss and Breloom, and pivots Rotom-W in with Volt Switch or U-turn. Assault Vest users such as Magnezone and Eelektross deal with special attackers such as Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Greninja for Rotom-W they also tend to invite in passive Pokemon, which provide it more setup opportunities.</p> "

Rotom-W is also a really good blanket check to Ice- and Fire-types like Mamoswine, Victini, and Galarian Darmanitan. Volt Switch provides great momentum, which is needed in hyper offense teams. In addition to providing momentum, Rotom-W has access to Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, crippling foes such as Mega Garchomp and Mimikyu with Will-O-Wisp, while Toxic punishes switch-ins such as Gastrodon and Kyurem.

Zeraora also pressures Hydreigon and Gholdengo, which can use Rotom-W as setup fodder. Iron Hands provides the coverage and bulk against Pokemon like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Volcarona, and SubRoost Kyurem that Rotom-W can't deal with while also putting a lot of pressure on Normal teams, as Rotom-W can Volt Switch against Blissey into Iron Hands and force Blissey to tank a hit or switch out. Alolan Raichu gives Rotom-W's slow Volt Switch a lot of value as it is strong but frail, being able to deal with Ice-types like Baxcalibut with Focus Blast and Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Clodsire with Psyshock.

Nasty Plot allows Mesprit to be more immediately threatening, while Calm Mind lets it tank more special attacks and take advantage of Substitute and Stored Power more. Even though Dazzling Gleam is stronger than Draining Kiss, the latter is preferred for longevity, but Dazzling Gleam 2HKOes Appletun, Umbreon, and, with Tera Fairy, Hisuian Qwilfish at +2 after Stealth Rock. Stored Power lets Mesprit be even more threatening over time as you amass more boosts, but Mystical Power gives it a decent attacking move right off the bat that can help you steamroll teams by just attacking. Psyshock helps beat special walls like Articuno, Blissey, and Muk more easily as well as setup sweepers like Vivillon and Lilligant that can boost Special Defense. Tera Fairy lets Mesprit turn would-be checks in Dark-types such as Umbreon and Bombirdier into setup fodder, even letting it use Substitute on their attacks.</p> <p>Mesprit is checked by special walls and Dark-types alike, so checks such as Bombirdier, Toxicroak, and Scyther pair greatly alongside it. Because faster physical attackers like Bruxish and Scyther easily threaten Mesprit out, physical walls like Lurantis, Avalugg, and Sandaconda work as amazing partners. Encore from Sableye, Cacturne, or Alolan Raichu can be quite annoying for Mesprit to deal with, as these Pokemon can lock Mesprit into a non-damaging move and then whittle it down. To combat this, Dark-types to beat them like Bombirdier and Hisuian Qwilfish are good teammates that can also cripple the opposing team with Knock Off, entry hazards, and status conditions.</p> "

Psyshock 2HKOes Cryogonal while also letting Mesprit beat down special walls that love to come in on it, while Psychic can be used instead to let you take care of Pokemon like Sandaconda and Avalugg. Mystical Power with Choice Scarf is a powerful combination on Mesprit, letting it become a revenge killer that can easily spiral out of control and beat weakened teams. Trick helps with crippling walls like Blissey and Articuno that Mesprit draws in and helps it check bulky setup sweepers like Ursaring and Eelektross. Healing Wish can be used instead to help bring a teammate that has longevity issues back to full or give a setup sweeper another chance like Assault Vest Eelektross, Tauros, or Bruxish. Tera Fairy helps Mesprit revenge kill Toxicroak and Cacturne more safely, as it then resists Sucker Punch. Also, STAB Dazzling Gleam lets Mesprit muscle past Dark-types far more consistently.</p> <p>Hisuian Qwilfish is the best Mesprit answer in the tier, so Pokemon like Bruxish, Froslass, and Appletun that can draw it in and force meaningful damage onto it are important teammates to have. Choice Scarf Mesprit pairs nicely with Choice Band wallbreakers like Hisuian Sneasel and Medicham because, with U-turn, Mesprit can pivot them in versus special walls and Dark-types. All of Mesprit's checks heavily rely on their items, like Blissey, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Eelektross, so Knock Off from teammates such as Samurott, Bombirdier, and Sableye especially helps it to clean late-game. Healing Wish pairs well with Life Orb Samurott, Tauros, and Choice Band Bruxish, as they tend to have poor longevity—a second chance for a setup sweepers like Eelektross and Swords Dance Hisuian Sneasel is also highly appreciated.</p> "

Toxic annoys bulky defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Arceus formes, notably invalidating most setup variants of the latter, and it also prevents Fairy-types like Zacian from switching in freely. Parting Shot lets Dialga-O safely pivot in offensive teammates and can be cycled alongside a Prankster user to safely rack up Toxic damage; alternatively, Teleport allows Dialga-O to use 252 Speed EVs and moves after Ting-Lu's U-turn, which helps get dangerous wallbreakers like Koraidon and Enamorus in safe from utility moves like Knock Off and Nuzzle. Moonlight and Recover are largely the same, though Moonlight benefits from sun, whereas Recover is more consistent. Ice Scales Dialga-O's best fit is on balance teams that want a reliable, non-passive special wall and a slow pivot. Fairy-types like Zacian are recommended as backup checks for Tera Dragon + Dragon Energy attackers like Palkia-O, which can break past Dialga-O after Nasty Plot.

Tera Fairy grants a Dragon immunity and drops the Ground weakness, allowing Dialga-O to check Arceus-Ground, Palkia-O, and Enamorus in a pinch, even though it must watch out for the former's Toxic. Dialga-O Imposter-proofs itself thanks to its Toxic immunity, but it can be hard to prevent the foe from healing; pivoting to an offensive teammate like Choice Band Groudon or Koraidon is recommended to take advantage of this.</p> "

          "description": "<p>With its unique typing and high stats all around the board, Heatran makes for a bulky attacker able to threaten all kinds of Pokemon in the tier. Magma Storm allows Heatran to trap and potentially remove opposing Pokemon, as well as chipping them down with its passive damage. Earth Power hits Toxapex and Fire-types such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, Volcanion, and opposing Heatran for super effective damage. Taunt can be used to stop Toxapex's Recover and Galarian Slowking's Chilly Reception and Slack Off, thus allowing Heatran to trap them. Heatran is an effective Stealth Rock user thanks to its good matchup against common entry hazard removal options in Defog Corviknight and bulky Court Change Cinderace. Tera Blast Grass gives Heatran a way to hit Water-types such as Rotom-W, Hisuian Samurott, and Azumarill, as well as threatening a OHKO against Great Tusk. Furthermore, Tera Grass works well with Flash Fire and turns Heatran's Ground and Water weaknesses into resistances, improving its matchup against the aforementioned Pokemon as well as Volcanion and letting it potentially trap the likes of Dondozo and Clodsire. Leftovers lets Heatran heal throughout the game and makes it easier for it to trap its targets. Air Balloon is another option that allows Heatran to take a hit from Pokemon that would usually target it with Earthquake or Earth Power such as Enamorus, Ursaluna, and opposing Heatran and heavily damage them. The matchup against opposing Heatran also makes a Timid nature desirable to outspeed the other and hit it with Earth Power; it also lets Heatran outspeed the likes of Modest Gholdengo and Volcanion. Alternatively, Heatran can opt to run a Modest nature to further boost its power.</p> <p>Heatran usually finds itself on bulky offense teams due to its ability to threaten defensive Pokemon and common forms of entry hazard control. Kingambit appreciates Heatran's support against Will-O-Wisp users in Cinderace, Dragapult, and Moltres and its ability to take on walls such as Corviknight as well as Dondozo and Great Tusk if Terastallized. Heatran's ability to force heavy damage against Amoonguss, Hatterene, and defensive Zapdos makes it a good Great Tusk partner. Great Tusk, in turn, provides Rapid Spin support to keep the field clear from entry hazards, which Heatran tends to get worn down by. Zapdos can defensively check Fighting-types that outspeed Heatran, such as Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Sneasler, and offensive Great Tusk, as well as Hisuian Samurott, which tends to use Heatran as an opportunity to fire off Ceaseless Edge. Enamorus is also able to check Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott, though it struggles to safely switch into them consistently due to its lesser bulk. Dragapult can threaten the Dragon-types that don't take much damage from Heatran's attacks, such as Dragonite, Walking Wake, and Garchomp. Furthermore, its Water resistance and Fighting immunity let it answer Volcanion and Zamazenta aiming to KO Heatran. Lastly, Rillaboom's ability to summon Grassy Terrain via Grassy Surge provides Heatran with extra passive recovery, boosts the power of its Tera Blast Grass, and weakens the damage it takes from Earthquake, letting Heatran survive physically defensive Great Tusk's Earthquake from full health.</p> "

Magma Storm is a strong STAB move that lets it potentially trap the likes of Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, and which even Fire-resistant foes such as Garchomp and Rotom-W can struggle against due to its passive damage. Taunt allows Heatran to block status moves such as Toxapex's Recover and Galarian Slowking's Chilly Reception. Alternatively, Protect can be used to gain extra Leftovers recovery, deal further damage with Magma Storm, and scout Choice item users such as Dragapult, Enamorus, and Zamazenta. Earth Power provides a way for Heatran to dent Fire-types such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and opposing Heatran, and it lets Heatran continuously chip Toxapex and Galarian Slowking to more easily remove them after having trapped them. Stealth Rock is used to take advantage of its good matchup against hazard control options such as Hatterene, Corviknight, and bulky Cinderace. Tera Blast Grass is an alternative that lets Heatran threaten the likes of Rotom-W and Hisuian Samurott. Lastly, Will-O-Wisp is another option that allows Heatran to punish Dragonite, Garchomp, and Roaring Moon trying to switch in, as well as Kingambit aiming to revenge kill Heatran with Sucker Punch. The set opts for near maximum Special Defense investment with enough Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Azumarill. The 4 Defense EVs in conjunction with maximum HP allows Heatran to always survive an Earthquake from Clodsire from full health. Tera Grass's benefits go beyond the Tera Blast coverage, as it also gives Heatran a resistance to Water- and Ground-type attacks, which expands its range of Pokemon it can trap to include Dondozo, Clodsire, and Garganacl. Tera Grass also synergizes beautifully with Flash Fire, as it removes the potential weakness to Fire-type attacks. Tera Flying is another option that gets rid of Heatran's weakness to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, notably improving its matchup against Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Dragapult appreciates Heatran's ability to switch into Choice Scarf Gholdengo's Shadow Ball, Choice Scarf Enamorus's Moonblast, and opposing Dragapult's STAB moves. Great Tusk is another Pokemon that appreciates Heatran's support against said special attackers, as well as against Zapdos, Amoonguss, and Hatterene, and in turn it is able to keep Heatran healthy by removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Heatran and Toxapex make for a solid defensive core thanks to the former's ability to take on Hatterene, Zapdos, and Gholdengo that annoy Toxapex, and the latter's resistance to Fighting- and Water-type moves that aim to target Heatran such as Close Combat from Iron Valiant, Sneasler, and Zamazenta, Walking Wake's Hydro Steam, and Greninja's Hydro Pump.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Specially defensive Heatran is an invaluable part of any Steel team. It is a fantastic check to many metagame staples that Steel would greatly struggle to otherwise deal with, such as Volcarona, Corviknight, Skeledirge, Zapdos, and Iron Moth. It serves Steel teams consistently well even outside of these problem matchups due to its great natural bulk, plethora of useful resistances including a crucial immunity to Fire via Flash Fire, and utility for its team through its access to Stealth Rock and capacity to spread burns.</p> <p>Lava Plume is Heatran’s primary attacking move, which not only hits neutral targets hard due to Heatran’s naturally good Special Attack but also has a 30% chance to burn foes. Fire’s nature as an attacking type that has no natural immunities means Heatran can use Lava Plume many times throughout the course of a game to generate progress with minimal risk. The burn chance of Lava Plume makes Heatran incredibly risky for foes to switch into, as physical attackers such as Great Tusk that could threaten a KO on Heatran do not want to risk the possibility of being burned and having their offensive power crippled. Furthermore, walls such as Toxapex also fear being burned, as the passive damage will affect their longevity over the course of a game. Earth Power is the only coverage necessary for Heatran, giving it the capability to easily break through foes such as Skeledirge and Iron Moth. It is notable that an EV spread including 56 Special Attack EVs will allow Heatran to OHKO offensive opposing Heatran with Earth Power. Heatran serves as an excellent setter of Stealth Rock due to its propensity to easily force switches against Pokemon such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Amoonguss. Protect rounds out Heatran’s moveset, not only giving it the chance to extend its longevity via Leftovers and accumulate burn damage on foes but also the capability to scout foes’ movesets, which can be especially useful when facing off against foes using Choice items. One should be careful when using Protect not to fall into predictable patterns and give foes the chance to set up on Heatran, however. Magma Storm can be used instead of Lava Plume to trap and eliminate foes such as Toxapex and force damage against bulky threats such as Iron Hands; the passive damage synergizes well with Protect, but Magma Storm's low PP and accuracy makes it less consistent throughout longer games. Taunt is an option that can be used place of Stealth Rock that synergizes particularly well with Magma Storm, preventing foes from using recovery moves, getting entry hazards up, or setting up on Heatran. However, a lack of Speed investment means it will have somewhat limited utility. As another option to Stealth Rock, Power Gem easily OHKOes Moltres, which walls Heatran otherwise, and prevents bulky Volcarona sets from outlasting Heatran. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp can be used over Stealth Rock in conjunction with an investment of 40 Speed EVs to allow Heatran to outspeed and burn maximum Speed Adamant Kingambit. If desired, it is also possible to run one of the aforementioned alternative options of Taunt, Power Gem, or Will-O-Wisp instead of Protect, but this comes at the cost of significantly impacting Heatran's longevity and foregoing Protect's scouting utility.</p> <p>Heatran serves as one of the three pillars of Steel’s “immunity trinity” along with Corviknight and Gholdengo; combined, these three offer immunities to Steel’s core weaknesses of Fire, Ground, and Fighting, forming an excellent defensive backbone for any Steel team. Corviknight is Heatran’s most important partner, being able to nullify Ground moves targeted at Heatran while Heatran in turn blocks Fire moves aimed at Corviknight. Furthermore, Corviknight can also threaten prominent Fighting-types in the metagame such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler with its STAB Brave Bird. With a physically defensive pivot set, Corviknight further synergizes with specially defensive Heatran by being able to soak up physical hits while Heatran takes special ones, having the ability to remove opposing Stealth Rock and Spikes to prevent Heatran from being worn down by entry hazards over the course of a game and providing Heatran with opportunities to switch in safely via U-turn. Bulk Up Corviknight appreciates Heatran too, as Stealth Rock and burn support can increase its sweeping potential. Gholdengo completes the immunity trinity by voiding Fighting moves aimed at Heatran. Gholdengo can further support Heatran by blocking Corrosion Toxic from Glimmora thanks to Good as Gold; this ability combined with Gholdengo's Ghost typing also lets it completely prevent the removal of Heatran's Stealth Rock, as Gholdengo blocks both Rapid Spin and Defog. With an Air Balloon, Gholdengo can block Ground-type moves and use Nasty Plot to break through walls, both of which Heatran appreciates. Alternatively, using a Choice Scarf, Gholdengo can switch into Enamorus and outspeed and OHKO it in return, and it can use Trick to cripple opposing special walls such as Toxapex and Blissey or lock sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite into setup moves to prevent them from exploiting Heatran. Outside of the immunity trinity, Hisuian Goodra also makes a good pairing with Heatran due to its unique Water resistance on Steel and capacity to threaten opposing Water-types such as Basculegion-F and Greninja with Thunderbolt. Hisuian Goodra can also check Hydreigon and Walking Wake, which both wall and exploit Heatran. Moreover, Hisuian Goodra can act as a switch-in to opposing Heatran and threaten it with Earthquake, and it is able to survive an Earth Power from Landorus and OHKO it in return with Ice Beam if necessary. Iron Treads can spin away hazards for Heatran without removing Heatran’s Stealth Rock, set Stealth Rock itself to free Heatran to use other moves if desired, and serve as an offensive check to Sandy Shocks with its STAB Earthquake as well as Landorus with Ice Spinner, which Heatran’s other teammates can struggle to handle. Physical sweepers such as Kingambit and Scizor are grateful for Heatran’s ability to absorb Will-O-Wisp for them, and they can clean up teams Heatran has worn down with Stealth Rock and chip damage. Klefki can complement Heatran's Stealth Rock with its own Spikes while taking advantage of Heatran's Fire immunity, which can help break down opposing teams faster as they switch around to deal with the immunity trinity. It should be noted that this is by no means an exhaustive list of potential teammates for Heatran; all Steel-type Pokemon in the metagame appreciate Heatran’s Fire immunity, and no Pokemon currently competes with Heatran in this regard.</p> "

While Heatran boasts an innately good defensive typing, Tera Grass allows it to turn its common weaknesses to Ground and Water into resistances, letting it match up better against the likes of Landorus-T and Palafin-H. Heat Wave is a spread STAB attack that chips away at foes, notably 2HKOing Amoonguss. Flash Cannon is Heatran's best way of hitting Fairy-types, as it OHKOes Diancie and 2HKOes Flutter Mane. Heavy Slam OHKOes Flutter Mane but is generally less reliable because it can be weakened by Intimidate and does less damage to Diancie and opposing Tera Grass Heatran mirror. Tera Blast hits Water- and Ground-types super effectively once Heatran has Terastallized, notably OHKOing Great Tusk and 2HKOing Bulk Up Palafin-H. Earth Power hits the Fire-types such as Volcanion, Chi-Yu, and opposing Heatran that otherwise resists all of Heatran's attacks. Heatran's base resistances let it take common Fairy-, Ice-, and Steel-type attacks such as Flutter Mane's Moonblast, Chien-Pao's Ice Spinner, and Gholdengo's Make It Rain much better. After Terastallization, Heatran matches up better against Palafin-H, Volcanion, and Iron Hands at the cost of receiving more damage from the aforementioned attacks. Heatran has a lot of defensive responsibilities on most teams, so Terastallization should not be used too frivolously. Heatran commonly finds itself in Fire / Water / Grass cores with Rillaboom and Palafin, as they complement each other offensively and defensively, with Rillaboom eradicating Water-types and Palafin punching through Fire-types. Iron Hands is a common Heatran partner that can pressure Palafin and Volcanion with Wild Charge and Chi-Yu and Tera Dark Kingambit with Drain Punch. Heatran has no form of recovery, so it appreciates teammates that can extend its longevity, such as Cresselia with Lunar Blessing and Amoonguss with Pollen Puff.</p> "

A Hasty nature is chosen to maximize both Heatran's physical and special power, and 96 Attack EVs let it 2HKO common RegenVest users like Meloetta and Hisuian Goodra after Stealth Rock damage. 200 Speed EVs let Heatran outspeed Slither Wing, Volcanion, and defensive Garchomp; the rest of the available EVs are put into Special Attack to maximize Steel Beam's power.

Additionally, to help seal the deal against bulky pivots like Garchomp and fast revenge killers like Chien-Pao, Heatran appreciates teammates like Scream Tail to absorb their hits and have a chance to make progress against them. Finally, offensive teammates like Chien-Pao can take advantage of Heatran's ability to chip switch-ins early-game, as well as defeating Goodra, leading to a more threatening end-game presence.</p> "

IronPress allows Heatran to better take on RegenVest users such as Alolan Muk and Meloetta, Garchomp, and Well-Baked Body Steel-types, most notably Kingambit. Substitute blocks Dragon Tail from Garchomp and Knock Off from Iron Treads, takes advantage of the switches Heatran forces versus foes like Blissey, and also benefits from Iron Defense boosts. 200 Speed EVs and a Timid nature make Heatran outrun Timid Volcanion and Adamant Slither Wing. This Heatran variant is very vulnerable to common Primordial Sea users in Zapdos, Kilowattrel, and Inteleon, so partners that can take them on like Hisuian Goodra and Meloetta are mandatory. Primordial Sea Zapdos can switch in against Fire-types such as Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Ceruledge that threaten Heatran. In return, Heatran takes on RegenVest users that Zapdos struggles to break through. Another Fire-type teammate with Desolate Land like Cinderace, Iron Moth, or Ceruledge appreciates Heatran taking on Ground-types for it, while they can punish Water-types and the aforementioned Primordial Sea users.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Heatran serves as an effective defensive pivot into Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Tornadus-T, Victini, Mega Scizor lacking Close Combat, Volcarona, and Gholdengo. Magma Storm allows Heatran to trap and remove defensive Pokemon, such as Zapdos, Toxapex, and Skeledirge. Taunt allows Heatran to deny recovery from Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Clodsire, and Zapdos, making trapping them much more efficient, though it has to Terastallize for the former two. Earth Power provides consistent damage versus Pokemon such as Clodsire, Toxapex, and Gastrodon while also allowing Heatran to deal damage without running the risk of missing Magma Storm, particularly on its trapped opponents. Tera Grass allows Heatran to invalidate typical counterplay such as Gastrodon and Clodsire while also avoiding being revenge killed by Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Taunt further bolsters Heatran's effective use of Tera, as it can avoid one of its only potential flaws in becoming vulnerable to Toxic. Heatran can also use Toxic itself to threaten Pokemon using it to set up, such as Garchomp and Dragonite while reducing longevity of Pokemon such as Pelipper, Mega Swampert, and opposing Terastallized Heatran. Tera Grass in conjunction with Flash Fire gives Heatran a unique defensive profile that lets it wall Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and opposing Heatran. Heatran must be careful with Tera usage, as Tera Grass can leave it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Volcarona and Tornadus-T. The given EV spread allows Heatran to outspeed uninvested Gholdengo while maximizing special bulk. Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W appreciate Heatran’s ability to bait and remove popular Ground-types once Terastallized, such as Landorus-T, Clodsire, and Gastrodon, as well as heavily chippping Garchomp. Teammates such as Urshifu-R, Dragapult, and Mega Lopunny appreciate Heatran's ability to check Tapu Lele, taking its often choice locked STAB attacks and setting Stealth Rock or firing off a Magma Storm to force progress, benefitting its teammates. Pokemon such as Dragonite and Garchomp can benefit Heatran defensively with both punishing physical attackers such as Mega-Lopunny while also capitalizing on its wallbreaking potential. Heatran is also able to bait and eliminate Tera Fairy Skeledirge for these aforementioned teammates. Rotom-W defensively supports Heatran by preventing it from immediately Terastallizing to beat Clodsire, opposing Rotom-W, and Landorus-T if not desired, providing a safe switch. Heatran struggles to stay healthy in certain matchups versus offensive entry hazard-stacking teams that deny it from coming in freely without seriously chipping itself, so Defoggers like Tornadus-T benefit Heatran while also providing a Ground immunity. Heatran can take advantage of Choice-locked Grass types such as Rillaboom and Kartana when they are trying to hit Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T particularly likes Heatran's ability to check Zapdos and Tapu Koko. Heatran appreciates Pokemon who can soak up Fighting-type moves such as Great Tusk and Tangrowth as Heatran tends to invite in particularly strong revenge killers like Mega-Lopunny and opposing Great Tusk.</p> "

Moonblast rounds out Cresselia's coverage, allowing it to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Greninja super effectively while being able to at least damage Kingambit; Tera Blast Fighting greatly improves Cresselia's matchup against Kingambit and hits these Dark-types harder than Moonblast, but makes Cresselia more reliant on Terastallization. Leftovers grants Cresselia crucial passive healing, allowing it to conserve its limited Moonlight PP long-term; Covert Cloak, on the other hand, blocks secondary effects from an array of moves, including Heatran's Magma Storm, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Zapdos's Discharge, and Sneasler's Dire Claw, allowing Cresselia to set up against these threats more safely. Grassy Seed is an option if Cresselia is used on Grassy Terrain hyper offense teams, which gives it more opprotunities to set up in the face of physical attackers while also boosting its Stored Power.

Hidden Power Fighting is the preferred coverage move to hit Mega Tyranitar and Heatran much harder, while Moonblast provides a stronger hit against the likes of Dragapult and Urshifu-R if Cresselia cannot afford to accumulate multiple Calm Mind boosts. Tera Poison is essential for removing Cresselia's weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Hisuian Samurott while providing less exploitable weaknesses compared to Tera Steel, which makes Cresselia prone to being revenge killed by Fighting- and Fire-types such as Mega Lopunny, Sneasler, Heatran, and Mega Charizard Y. Covert Cloak allows Cresselia to negate secondary effects from Garganacl's Salt Cure and status from the likes of Toxapex, Sneasler, and Zapdos, while Leftovers provides passive recovery that makes Cresselia less exploitable and forced to heal. Maximum Speed EVs allow Cresselia to consistently outspeed Heatran and Gholdengo, which could otherwise irritate it, although more Defense investment could be used instead to better withstand attacks from the likes of Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Cresselia fits best on either bulky balance or hyper offense teams, both able to provide support in different ways; the former give Cresselia a defensive core to fall back on should its sweep fail, while the latter pressure opposing defensive teams and can provide dual screens support via Tapu Koko and Dragapult to bolster its bulk even further. Both playstyles can reliably keep up Spikes using Skarmory, Clodsire, Mega Diancie, or Garchomp, which Cresselia mandates in order to wear down its checks such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Similarly, Knock Off support from the likes of Toxapex and Iron Valiant helps Cresselia pressure the aforementioned checks more effectively. Cresselia has difficulty withstanding rain teams due to them cutting Moonlight's healing, so defensive partners that match up positively against them such as Toxapex and Tera Water or Dragon Garganacl are appreciated. Cresselia struggles with bulkier playstyles that can neutralize it with the likes of Haze Toxapex and Unaware Tera Dark Clodsire, so Pokemon that can break defensive teams such as Swords Dance Gliscor and Gholdengo make for good partners.</p> "

Its Tail Glow-boosted Hydro Vortex possesses nuclear power, capable of feats like OHKOing Chansey after Stealth Rock and significantly denting Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Tera Grass Heatran that give rain wallbreakers a hard time. Longevity from Rest + Hydration lets it sponge status moves in rain against defensive teams, which gives it plenty of opportunities to wallbreak by shrugging off their chip damage, such as against Toxapex and Clodsire's Toxic and Garganacl's Salt Cure. Energy Ball covers Gastrodon as well as Water-resistant foes like Rotom-W, Tera Water Ting-Lu, and Tera Water Garganacl without expending its Z-Move. Alternatively, Psychic hits Water Absorb Clodsire and Toxapex much stronger. Pelipper is a mandatory teammate due to providing the highly important rain with Drizzle. Swift Swim users like Mega Swampert and Barraskewda can keep the offensive pressure up against the opposition; their high Speed allows them to beat offensive teams by outpacing fast Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Koko that can overwhelm Manaphy, and they enjoy it dealing with bulky teams in return, impairing the likes of Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Rotom-W for them. Utility options from Tornadus-T and Ferrothorn are also appreciated; the former checks Kartana and Serperior that would otherwise revenge kill Manaphy, while the latter covers Tapu Koko and provides entry hazards. Kingambit and Weavile can Pursuit trap Dragapult and Mega Latias, both of which are problematic for Manaphy to face.</p> "

Energy Ball hits foes such as Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Tapu Fini while Psychic hits foes such as Toxapex and Water Absorb Clodsire. Rindo Berry can be used so Manaphy can avoid revenge killers such as Kartana while improving its matchup against foes such as Tangrowth. Alternatively, Wacan Berry helps prevent Manaphy from being revenge killed by Tapu Koko and Iron Valiant. Ice Beam can be used over Psychic or Energy Ball to dent Dragonite, Ferrothorn, and Hydreigon, but Manaphy can no longer hit foes such as Toxapex and Gastrodon. Salac Berry with Substitute with either Tera Steel or Grass can be used to exploit the Pokemon that Manaphy threatens such as Hippowdon and Garganacl, outspeeding would-be revenge killers such as Tapu Koko and Kartana. Tera Water is used to boost the power of Surf, allowing Manaphy to 2HKO foes such as Ferrothorn and Unaware Clodsire. Manaphy fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its wallbreaking capabilities. Dual screens support from Tapu Koko or Grimmsnarl improves Manaphy's longevity, allowing it to set up easier. Teammates such as Dragapult and Volcarona appreciate Manaphy removing troublesome foes such as Mega Tyranitar, Kingambit, and Heatran for them to sweep. Manaphy also appreciates entry hazard support from teammates such as Glimmora and Landorus-T weakening foes such as Ferrothorn so Manaphy can break through them easier.</p> "

What differentiates Arceus-Fairy from other Calm Mind Arceus formes is its Dragon immunity, which grants it an invaluable defensive niche against some of the metagame's top threats, like Koraidon, and its Judgment being at least a neutral hit on the vast majority of the metagame, as Pokemon that resist Fairy are scarce.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza while maximizing bulk.

In conjunction with Will-O-Wisp, Tera Poison Arceus-Fairy can potentially take on Zacian-C one-on-one if it has enough Calm Mind boosts.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy should be spreading Will-O-Wisp before attempting to sweep, as Pokemon like Clodsire and Zacian-C can stop Arceus-Fairy on its tracks before it accomplishes anything. Arceus-Fairy can be overwhelmed fairly easily by strong powerhouses like Tera Fire Koraidon and Choice Specs Miraidon, so taking care of them first before attempting to sweep is advised.</li> <li>Skeledirge is the best counter to Arceus-Fairy, as it ignores Calm Mind boosts with Unaware, can break through it with Torch Song, and is naturally immune to Will-O-Wisp.

With Sharpness, Razor Shell is Hisuian Samurott's strongest move, dealing high damage to many opposing leads such as Great Tusk and Glimmora. Surf is an alternative over Razor Shell that trades overall power for the ability to hit Great Tusk's lower Special Defense and avoid activating Glimmora's Toxic Debris. Knock Off allows Hisuian Samurott to make progress against the enemy team by removing items, especially Heavy-Duty Boots, but Taunt is another option that denies opposing entry hazards and prevents Defog. For the last slot, Aqua Jet is useful for finishing off faster leads such as Great Tusk, while Sucker Punch is a stronger but less reliable Aqua Jet alternative that hits Pokemon like Dragapult and Walking Wake. Finally, Encore is useful for locking opposing Pokemon into undesirable moves such as forcing an opposing lead to use Stealth Rock repeatedly, allowing Hisuian Samurott to stack more Spikes with Ceaseless Edge. Taunt and Encore also prevent Hisuian Samurott from becoming setup fodder from Pokemon like Iron Defense Zamazenta and Tera Water Garganacl that attempt to exploit Hisuian Samurott's relative passivity. Focus Sash ensures Hisuian Samurott can take any one hit and set up at least one layer of Spikes. Tera Ghost is the preferred option to block Rapid Spin. However, Tera Water can also be considered to power up Hisuian Samurott's Water-type STAB moves, especially if running Aqua Jet. Sharpness is generally the preferred ability to boost the power of both Ceaseless Edge and Razor Shell. However, if Hisuian Samurott is using Surf instead, Torrent can also be considered for greater power against bulky variants of Great Tusk when at low health, which works extremely well with Focus Sash.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott fits best on hyper offense teams looking for a suicide lead to start the game off with entry hazards. This set is useful, as it virtually guarantees that a layer of Spikes will go up, since Ceaseless Edge is not affected by Taunt and Hatterene's Magic Bounce. Gholdengo is highly recommended to deny opposing Rapid Spin and Defog. A Stealth Rock setter such as Great Tusk or Sandy Shocks can further supplement the team's hazard pressure. In particular, Sandy Shocks has a strong matchup against Zapdos and Glimmora, while Hisuian Samurott can cover Ting-Lu for Sandy Shocks. A Knock Off user such as Meowscarada, Great Tusk, or Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from enemy Pokemon to make them vulnerable to Spikes. Powerful sweepers that can take advantage of the hazard pressure Hisuian Samurott creates are good teammates. Such Pokemon include Kingambit, Dragonite, Sneasler, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant. These Pokemon all appreciate Spikes support to wear down bulky targets such as Dondozo, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu. Strong wallbreakers such as Ursaluna also enjoy Hisuian Samurott's Spikes to make them even harder to wall.</p> "

Aside from its reliability and higher critical hit ratio, Aqua Cutter's main benefit is to avoid Static from Zapdos and Rocky Helmet from the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T; on the other hand, Razor Shell can be used for its Defense drop alongside slightly higher Base Power. Aqua Jet rounds off Hisuian Samurott's moveset by providing ever-so-useful priority to clean up weakened teams with faster threats and either revenge kill or discourage Pokémon like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and offensive Great Tusk from coming in. Sucker Punch is a much stronger alternative and hits Water-resistant foes like Walking Wake and Dragapult, but it's less reliable due to poor interaction with status moves like Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Substitute. Mystic Water can be used boost Hisuian Samurott's damage output on its Water-type moves without the cost of its HP like Life Orb would; Heavy-Duty Boots, on the other hand, helps give Hisuian Samurott more longevity so that it gets more chances to spread hazards via Ceaseless Edge and wallbreak early-game. Tera Water serves a similar purpose to Mystic Water, being potentially useful to sweep a team or generally increase the damage of Aqua Jet and Aqua Cutter; on the other hand, Tera Dark significantly boosts Ceaseless Edge and Sucker Punch. Both Tera types can also have defensive impacts, like Tera Water allowing Hisuian Samurott to stomach a hit from Zamazenta or Iron Valiant and Tera Dark doing the same for Zapdos.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott is a great fit on bulky offenses and balances that appreciate its entry hazard stacking ability and wallbreaking prowess all condensed in one slot; more well-rounded team styles can afford giving Hisuian Samurott more turns to click Ceaseless Edge or apply raw offensive pressure between Swords Dance and Aqua Cutter. To aid in that, teammates that can help provide momentum are very welcome, such as U-turn users like Cinderace, Dragapult; Volt Switch users like Zapdos; and even Eject Pack users like Close Combat Great Tusk. Pokemon that appreciate their checks getting worn down by Spikes are also fantastic teammates; Dragapult and Gholdengo deserve a mention, as their most common check in Kingambit especially dislikes coming into Spikes if it's not holding an Air Balloon, but almost any wallbreaker strongly appreciates Hisuian Samurott's Spikes and offensive pressure, with examples including Kingambit, offensive Zapdos, and Walking Wake. Hisuian Samurott may have trouble with its work being undone by hazard removers like Great Tusk, Defog Corviknight, and Court Change Cinderace. Gholdengo is a good help with the first two, whereas for the latter, having a team with strong momentum options like the aforementioned U-turn, Volt Switch, and Eject Pack users as well as Pokemon that take advantage of pivot Cinderace like Heatran or Volcanion are welcome.</p> "

Knock Off removes valuable items from Pokemon that rely on them, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite as well as Leftovers from Corviknight and Toxapex. Sacred Sword is a great coverage move for Hisuian Samurott, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Kingambit and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Tera Water boosts the power of Razor Shell, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon like Ursaluna and Great Tusk.

Gholdengo is a great partner for Hisuian Samurott due to pressuring faster offensive threats such as Sneasler and Iron Valiant, and thanks to its ability, it can block Defog attempts from Corviknight. Hisuian Samurott also has great type synergy with Gholdengo, with it being able to pressure Dark-types Gholdengo tends to struggle with like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Heatran and Ting-Lu both make for good partners, since they can stack hazards alongside Hisuian Samurott while also checking Zapdos, which otherwise forces it out. In return, Hisuian Samurott can pressure Ground-types that Heatran and Ting-Lu both tend to struggle with, like Great Tusk and Ursaluna. Walls such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Corviknight can force Hisuian Samurott out, so it pairs well with offensive teammates that can beat them, like the aforementioned Gholdengo as well as Choice Specs Hoopa-U and Zapdos. Lastly, sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Dragonite, and Sneasler appreciate Hisuian Samurott laying down hazards and beating Pokemon they can struggle with, like Air Balloon Gholdengo.</p> "

          "description": "<p>The name of the game with Hisuian Samurott is finding as many opportunities as possible to use Ceaseless Edge in order to repeatedly set up Spikes. This set aims to leverage Hisuian Samurott's natural resistances by equipping an Assault Vest, allowing it to come in on Gholdengo, Heatran, and Kingambit lacking Low Kick and Tera Blast Fairy. Knock Off makes progress against teams otherwise unphased by Hisuian Samurott's offensive profile, removing valuable items from the likes of Zapdos, Dondozo, and Toxapex. Sacred Sword is an alternative that better rounds out Hisuian Samurott's neutral coverage while hitting Kingambit and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Hisuian Samurott is a great utilizer of priority moves due to its proficiency at weakening teams with entry hazards damage, and it has two options in Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch. Aqua Jet has better coverage against Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Sneasler, while Sucker Punch trades in reliability for power and is a better option for revenge killing the likes of Choice-locked Dragapult. If electing to run Aqua Jet, Tera Water is ideal to boost its power as well as Razor Shell's. If running Sucker Punch, Tera Dark is the better choice, especially if Knock Off is also being used. On the flipside, Tera Steel is useful as a defensive Tera type for reversing the matchup against Moonblast from Enamorus and Iron Valiant and resisting Dragon-type moves from Dragapult. Tera Ghost is another option, stifling foes attempts at removing hazards via Rapid Spin, though this does make Hisuian Samurott vulnerable to Shadow Ball from Dragapult and Gholdengo, which it was previously able to come in on. 20 Special Defense EVs in combination with an Assault Vest ensures Hisuian Samurott takes a Moonblast from non-Choice Specs Iron Valiant or a Draco Meteor from Modest Choice Specs Dragapult from full HP.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott fits very well on balanced and bulky offensive teams that appreciate entry hazard stacking as well as role compression from it being able to take a few special hits thanks to its Assault Vest. Other Pokemon that fit on these sorts of offensive teams that also appreciate the opposing team being weakened by Spikes, such as Kingambit, Dragonite, and Sneasler are beneficial allies. Gholdengo specifically is a very good teammate, as it blocks both Rapid Spin and Defog and can take advantage of some of Hisuian Samurott's switch-ins like Amoonguss and Toxapex. Dragapult is also an option for spinblocking. It additionally is great at forcing switches, racking up hazard damage. VoltTurn support from Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Corviknight is a worthwhile consideration to give Hisuian Samurott more opportunities to throw off attacks. While Hisuian Samurott can come in once or twice on attacks from Pokemon like Gholdengo and Heatran, it's by no means a reliable answer. Ting-Lu and Tera Water Garganacl work well as primary answers to these threat while also forming a hazard stacking core alongside Hisuian Samurott. They can set up Stealth Rock while also greatly benefiting from its ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott is one of Water’s best options for a Choice Scarf user. This is owed to its great STAB combination, of which both types are resisted by only a scant few Pokemon in the metagame, higher power than what is initially apparent due to Sharpness bolstering its slicing moves, a good Speed tier that allows it to outspeed and revenge kill key threats such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and unique progress-making utility for Water in the form of Ceaseless Edge and Knock Off.</p> <p>Ceaseless Edge is Hisuian Samurott’s most important move, allowing it not only to threaten and KO foes with the raw power of a Sharpness-boosted Dark-type STAB move but also set up a layer of Spikes with each use, putting pressure on opposing teams and potentially opening up holes in defensive cores for its teammates to exploit. It is important to note that Spikes laid by Ceaseless Edge cannot be reflected by Magic Bounce, meaning Hisuian Samurott can safely click Ceaseless Edge against Hatterene and still get Spikes up. Hisuian Samurott’s secondary STAB move is a choice between Aqua Cutter and Razor Shell. Aqua Cutter is generally preferred for its consistency due it not making contact with the opponent and its perfect accuracy, allowing Hisuian Samurott to safely deal with Volcarona and Moltres. However, Razor Shell is guaranteed to OHKO Flutter Mane and provides Hisuian Samurott with more wallbreaking capability due to its 50% chance to reduce Defense if the user is willing to tolerate the risk of missing. Sacred Sword serves as an excellent coverage option, allowing Hisuian Samurott to eliminate foes such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Finally, Knock Off provides Hisuian Samurott with a secondary utility in the form of item removal, which can cripple Leftovers users such as Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Toxapex and open up Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Amoonguss to being chipped down by entry hazards, making Hisuian Samurott even riskier for foes to switch into.</p> <p>In terms of teammates, physically defensive Rotom-W is an excellent partner for Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott, checking several of Hisuian Samurott’s bad matchups such as Azumarill, Garchomp, and Scarf Great Tusk and providing Hisuian Samurott with safe opportunities to come in via Volt Switch. Toxapex is another great teammate for Hisuian Samurott, being able to switch into and take hits repeatedly from faster Choice Scarf users such as Sneasler, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant thanks to its defensive typing coupled with Regenerator and Recover. Moreover, Toxapex can serve as an answer to Urshifu-R and can compound on the pressure of Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes with its own Toxic Spikes, while benefitting itself from Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes punishing foes switching around. Gastrodon or Quagsire can absorb Electric-type moves for Hisuian Samurott and set up Stealth Rock to compliment Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes. Wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R, Greninja, Basculegion-M, and Walking Wake as well as sweepers such as Basculegion-F also synergize well with Hisuian Samurott, with Spikes support allowing them to more easily break through enemy teams and the speed control from Choice Scarf meaning potential revenge killers can be removed ahead of time. The speed control from Choice Scarf is still useful even on rain teams even when accompanied by Swift Swim Pokemon such as Basculegion-F, as rain will not always be present on the battlefield. Furthermore, either forme of Basculegion can serve as a spinblocker to prevent the removal of Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes.</p> "

Knock Off provides utility by removing items from switch-ins such as Corviknight and Quaquaval. Sucker Punch is a good priority move that lets Hisuian Samurott deal heavy damage to faster foes such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Zapdos.

Because Lilligant has Pollen Puff for Grass-types, it uses a Tera Blast type capable of threatening Flying-types, commonly Rock or Electric. Tera Rock has the added benefit of resisting Poison, letting Lilligant more easily deal with Muk or take a Poison-type attack from Hisuian Sneasel or Toxicroak in a pinch. Lilligant can opt to run Encore last in tandem with Tera Electric to take advantage of careless Thunder Wave users like Blissey and Umbreon, locking them into the move and granting Lilligant free setup opportunities. Sleep Powder can be used to grant even more setup opportunities, but without the added coverage, these setup opportunities are often moot. Life Orb is great for Lilligant, as Giga Drain can offset the recoil, and the added damage to special walls like Appletun and Bombirdier is greatly beneficial.</p> <p>Lilligant is often found on more offensive teams, both creating and using openings and momentum for and by its teammates. Dedicated leads like Bombirdier and Froslass are the forefront of generating early momentum for offensive Pokemon; the entry hazards and utility options like a respective Memento or Destiny Bond create ample opportunities for Lilligant and other offensive teammates like Hisuian Sneasel, Veluza, and Vivillon. Choice Scarf Mesprit and Rotom can invite in special walls like Blissey, Cryogonal, and Umbreon and Trick them, completely impairing their ability to check Lilligant effectively.</p> "

In sun, Hisuian Lilligant can use its Grass-type STAB move Solar Blade without the drawbacks of the normal two-turn charge. Ice Spinner allows it to hit common checks that resist both of its STAB types such as Zapdos, Amoonguss, Dragapult, and Dragonite for super effective damage. Leftovers in particular works well with Victory Dance, as Hisuian Lilligant is able to heal from some of the damage it takes while it sets up on physical attackers. Life Orb is an option that helps Hisuian Lilligant overwhelm some targets with extra power like Walking Wake, OHKOing it with Close Combat after a Victory Dance. A Jolly nature allows it to Speed tie Unburden Adamant Sneasler in sun, while an Adamant nature provides extra power that may be necessary to overwhelm targets like Zapdos, Amoonguss, and Zamazenta. Tera Ghost allows Hisuian Lilligant to spinblock and threaten some of its best checks in Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge with Tera Blast. Tera Ghost also allows Hisuian Lilligant to block Extreme Speed from Dragonite, preventing revenge kills. Tera Fire with Tera Blast is also an option, giving Hisuian Lilligant a strong sun-boosted Fire-type STAB move for coverage to hit bulky targets like Amoonguss and Gholdengo hard. Another benefit of Tera Fire is an immunity to burn from Pokemon like Moltres and Cinderace. Hisuian Lilligant requires Torkoal as a partner, as Hisuian Lilligant requires sun support, which Torkoal is able to set up automatically with Drought. Hisuian Lilligant’s ability to weaken Water-types and opposing team structures makes Iron Moth a dangerous late-game sweeper in sun. Hisuian Lilligant is only able to afford to run one coverage move, which can leave it vulnerable to checks it cannot afford to run coverage for, such as Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, Amoonguss, and Moltres. Great Tusk, Sandy Shocks, and Walking Wake are all great teammates capable of handling some of the aforementioned checks. Great Tusk and Sandy Shocks threaten Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Moltres. Walking Wake is able to break Amoonguss with Draco Meteor, as well as blow past Moltres, which is usually able to wall Hisuian Lilligant.</p> "

Leaf Blade 2HKOes Toxapex at +1 and threatens Water's two Unaware Pokemon, Dondozo and Quagsire. Close Combat hits Ice- and Steel-types trying to switch into Hisuian Lilligant's Grass STAB move, as well as having a favorable roll to OHKO both Corviknight and Hisuian Goodra at +1. Finally, Ice Spinner hits Dragon- and Flying-types such as Dragonite and Thundurus-T, as well as Unaware Clodsire on Ground. Wide Lens is used to reduce the accuracy drop from Hustle. Sleep Powder can be run to give Hisuian Lilligant more setup opportunities, but the loss of coverage in Ice Spinner or STAB in Close Combat is notable.</p> <p>Great Tusk is a great teammate for Hisuian Lilligant, as it threatens out Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and the Poison-types that can stop a Hisuian Lilligant sweep. Great Tusk can soften up Hisuian Lilligant's checks by setting Stealth Rock. In return, Hisuian Lilligant uses Water-types such as Hisuian Samurott and Quagsire, which threaten Great Tusk, as setup opportunities. Iron Valiant can break through common checks to Hisuian Lilligant such as the aforementioned Skeledirge and Gholdengo thanks to either Shadow Ball on special sets or Knock Off on mixed ones. Sneasler is a secondary sweeper that can also threaten Fairy-types such as Enamorus-T. Its Choice Scarf set can also beat Volcarona, which can use Hisuian Lilligant as setup fodder, with Rock Slide and use Switcheroo to hinder defensive walls trying to switch in. Iron Hands uses its insane bulk, bolstered by Assault Vest, to sponge special attacks very easily from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Hatterene. It also hits Flying-types hard with its Electric STAB moves, and can pivot Hisuian Lilligant in with Volt Switch. In return, Hisuian Lilligant breaks the Ground-types that threaten both Iron Hands and Sneasler. Finally, Zamazenta takes physical attacks well with Dauntless Shield and can threaten Ghost-types that Hisuian Lilligant struggles to break with Crunch. Its Iron Defense sets also do well against Steel, where Hisuian Lilligant is less effective.</p> "

It can deal out considerable damage to some of the meta's bulkiest Pokemon such as Corviknight and Iron Hands and is the best wincon on Grass in order to beat Flying. Ice Spinner allows Hisuian Lilligant to threaten opposing Dragon- and Flying-types like Enamorus, Galarian Zapdos, and Dragapult, as well as opposing Ground-types like Clodsire and Great Tusk if it does not run Leaf Blade. Sleep Powder is often preferred over Leaf Blade to give Hisuian Lilligant an easier chance to set up, and the combination of Ice Spinner and Close Combat still targets a good portion of the metagame. However, Leaf Blade can be used to target Pokemon that resist Ice Spinner and Close Combat such as Toxapex and Azumarill. Wide Lens allows Hisuian Lilligant to offset the accuracy drop of its attacks due to Hustle and it also boosts the accuracy of Sleep Powder, making it a more consistent option to use in order to set up safely.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Meowscarada is a great teammate that threatens faster Dragon-types like Dragapult and Walking Wake, while Hisuian Lilligant is able to beat bulky Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra and Corviknight that Meowscarada often lures in. Amoonguss is Hisuian Lilligant's best defensive partner, as its Poison typing helps it deal with opposing Fairy-types like Azumarill, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant and also removes Toxic Spikes. Amoonguss appreciates Hisuian Lilligant's ability to dispatch opposing Flying-types like Corviknight, which can render it setup fodder, and can also assist Hisuian Lilligant's setup using Spore. Iron Leaves is another offensive partner for Hisuian Lilligant that can threaten opposing Poison-types which Lilligant cannot break through like Toxapex. Iron Leaves appreciates Hisuian Lilligant being able to threaten opposing Dark-type Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Kingambit. Brambleghast offers hazard support with Spikes, allowing Hisuian Lilligant to have secure KOs on Pokemon like Alolan Muk. Furthermore, Brambleghast offers hazard removal with Rapid Spin, which improves Hisuian Lilligant's longevity by giving it more opportunities to switch in. Zarude is also an offensive partner that is able to threaten Gholdengo and also Skeledirge, which gives Grass teams a tough time in the Ghost matchup. Furthermore, its ability to threaten Poison's defensive staples like Clodsire, Toxapex, and Alolan Muk after a boost is appreciated. Rotom-C helps Hisuian Lilligant threaten key members Water teams if it opts not to use Leaf Blade, like Pelipper and Basculegion, while Hisuian Lilligant can threaten Thundurus-T so Rotom can threaten Flying teams easier.</p> "

          "description": "<p>With Chlorophyll, powerful STAB options in Solar Blade and Close Combat, along with a respectable base 105 Attack stat, Hisuian Lilligant can function as a powerful sun sweeper. It pairs well with the main sun setter, Mega Charizard Y, as it can switch into and threaten Mega Charizard Y’s checks such as Hippowdon, Heatran, and Clodsire; in return, Mega Charizard Y beats its checks like Gholdengo and Mega Scizor, if Hisuian Lilligant lacks Tera Blast. Solar Blade is used for raw power, although Leaf Blade is still an option for consistency outside sun. Tera Blast Fire, especially in sun, gives Lilligant a powerful third STAB option to punish foes that can tank its original STAB combination like Gholdengo, Mega Scizor, and Tera Poison Cresselia. Sleep Powder is an option to shut down checks such as Dragapult or scout for Tera types from Pokemon like Kingambit and Dondozo, which can be used as setup fodders or opportunities to give a free switch to an ally; this also allows Hisuian Lilligant to use Tera Fighting over Tera Fire for more power. Ice Spinner is another option, granting an OHKO on Flying-types that can absorb Hisuian Lilligant's STAB options such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and most Zapdos sets. Hazard support is invaluable in allowing boosted Solar Blade to OHKO Toxapex lacking Heavy-Duty Boots and Mega Scizor, making Great Tusk and Heatran good partners that also passively benefit from the sun. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant is vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster threats once the sun ends, so it appreciates a sturdy defensive core to back it up; Toxapex, Heatran, and Great Tusk can tank hits from and reliably check threats such as Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny once the sun goes down, while Landorus-T and Rotom-W are examples of pivots that can help bring Hisuian Lilligant in more easily.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Hustle coupled with Victory Dance can be used to break common defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Great Tusk, Landorus, Kingambit, and Heatran; Hisuian Lilligant also outspeeds a good portion of the metagame after a Victory Dance boost, allowing it to threaten even common Choice Scarf users such as Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, and Gholdengo. Its main drawback lies in the decrease in accuracy, which makes it inconsistent and potentially easy to KO. Wide Lens can be used to circumvent this, as the accuracy boost will minimize the chances of a miss. Grassium Z can allow Hisuian Lilligant to dismantle defensive cores, letting it OHKO the likes of Toxapex , Landorus-T, and defensive Tornadus-T and heavily damage Zapdos after a Victory Dance and Stealth Rock damage to potentially open up a hole for another ally like Kartana or Volcarona to clean up. Victory Dance allows it to outpace most of the metagame and fire off powerful attacks. Tera Blast Ground allows Hisuian Lilligant to snipe Gholdengo and Skeledirge for super effective damage whilst also notably beating common Poison-types like Toxapex and Sneasler. Sleep Powder can be considered to shut down foes and set up more easily. Ice Spinner is also an option to beat common Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Icium Z is an option when running this, as it allows Hisuian Lilligant to score an OHKO on Gliscor, defensive Landorus-T, and defensive Garchomp whilst avoiding Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin chip from the latter two. Hisuian Lilligant has trouble setting up, as it is frail enough to be susceptible to the multitude of offensive Pokemon in the tier. Its inconsistent accuracy may also sometimes leave it open to attacks. Thus, dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko is beneficial, although it should be noted that the latter summons Electric Terrain, which nullifies Sleep Powder. Entry hazard support is important to score OHKOs on certain Pokemon; for example, Bloom Doom OHKOes Toxapex and Tornadus lacking Heavy-Duty Boots after Stealth Rock damage. As such, Garchomp and Ferrothorn are examples of good entry hazard setters. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant can still be defensively checked by Pokemon like Zapdos, if lacking Ice Spinner, Volcarona, and defensive Gholdengo; allies that can beat these checks include Volcarona and Mega Diancie.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a fast and strong wallbreaker with good coverage. Not only are its coverage moves good, but it has STAB on a very spammable type with fantastic neutral coverage in OU, Ghost. An incredible ability in Illusion greatly improves its wallbreaking: it can disguise itself as another teammate to create mind games, scoring great damage if opponents guess wrong. Its unique typing blocks some revenge killing moves such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Ceruledge's Shadow Sneak, and Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot is a great coverage option to OHKO Great Tusk and physically defensive Dondozo, potentially OHKO Garganacl, and 2HKO specially defensive Dondozo. Alternatively, Hyper Voice is a good STAB option, getting neutral coverage on most Pokemon that Shadow Ball cannot, and it ignores Hydreigon and Terastallized Skeledirge's Substitute. Flamethrower allows Hisuian Zoroark to 2HKO Corviknight and Amoonguss, as well as OHKOing Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast gives Hisuian Zoroark a way to catch incoming Kingambit off guard, and it hits Garganacl and Ting-Lu super effectively, which is very helpful if forgoing Grass Knot. With Trick, Hisuian Zoroark can cripple walls like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl, as well as bulky setup sweepers it cannot threaten immediately, like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Tera Fire or Tera Water Hatterene. However, giving away Choice Specs sacrifices some of the OHKOs and 2HKOs mentioned above. U-turn is a great alternative to bring teammates in safely on Assault Vest Azumarill and Ting-Lu. Tera Normal and Tera Ghost boost Hisuian Zoroark's already powerful STAB moves, with boosted Hyper Voice always OHKOing Great Tusk, while boosted Shadow Ball 2HKOes Assault Vest Azumarill. Tera Fighting is another good option, as it not only boosts Focus Blast, but it also turns Hisuian Zoroark's Dark weakness into a resistance, meaning it no longer fears Sucker Punch revenge killers.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark fits best on offensive teams. Great Tusk can set Stealth Rock, helping Hisuian Zoroark KO foes more easily, and check the Dark-types it struggles with such as Kingambit and specially defensive Ting-Lu. Pivots such as Rotom-W and Meowscarada can bring Hisuian Zoroark safely into Amoonguss and Corviknight, respectively. Rotom-W in particular is a great teammate, since it can also spread paralysis, crippling boosted sweepers and naturally fast Pokemon such as Dragonite, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult for Hisuian Zoroark to outspeed and KO. Hisuian Zoroark dislikes opposing hazards: not only does it get worn down easily, but opponents may see through its disguise based on the damage it takes from Stealth Rock. Hence, it appreciates hazard removal and prevention from the aforementioned Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Hatterene. Great Tusk and Corviknight can also come in and take a hit from Kingambit and Meowscarada, respectively, which can revenge kill Hisuian Zoroark. Corviknight in particular really appreciates Hisuian Zoroark threatening Gholdengo, which blocks its Defog. Specially defensive Pokemon like Assault Vest Azumarill and Clodsire can take a hit from Hisuian Zoroark, thus forcing it out, given its frailty. To threaten both of these checks, Choice Band Breloom is a great partner. In return, U-turn Hisuian Zoroark can bring Breloom in on these Pokemon. Lastly, setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Volcarona, and Iron Moth appreciate Hisuian Zoroark's ability to threaten their checks such as Garganacl, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, letting them clean up afterwards. Hisuian Zoroark can also disguise as them to lure in their checks and either KO them or cripple them with Trick. Hisuian Zoroark can disguise as Dragonite, Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Roaring Moon to lure in physical walls such as Great Tusk and Dondozo, only for them to be OHKOed by Grass Knot. Similarly, Hisuian Zoroark can also disguise as Volcarona and Iron Moth to lure in Clodsire and Toxapex, using Trick to cripple them and open up a potential sweep.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Hisuian Zoroark is a devastating special wallbreaker thanks to its combination of unique typing, coverage, fantastic Speed, and a high Special Attack stat, and it can almost always threaten a KO after a boost. Its ability, Illusion, provides good utility by letting it draw out an unsuspecting teammate's check and blasting them with powerful special attacks. Shadow Ball hits nearly everything in the tier for solid damage with very few drawbacks, and it has the lovely side effect of potentially dropping a foe's Special Defense. Grass Knot can be utilized to sink many heavy defensive threats, such as Garganacl, Great Tusk, and Dondozo. This also comes with the advantage of being a reliable move against heavy foes like Ting-Lu without burning up valuable PP on Focus Blast or dealing with its less-than-stellar accuracy. Flamethrower hammers would-be switch-ins like Kingambit and Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast can be used to hit Ting-Lu, Hydreigon, Kingambit, and Garganacl with the same move. Tera Ghost allows Shadow Ball to more reliably OHKO Gholdengo on Focus Sash sets, and it also allows +2 Shadow Ball to OHKO Baxcalibur, Volcarona, Walking Wake, Iron Moth, and Slowking. Alternatively, Tera Fighting turns its Dark-type weakness into a resistance, leaving it less susceptible to Kingambit's Sucker Punch, Meowscarada's Knock Off, and Greninja's Dark Pulse, and it powers up Focus Blast to staggering heights. Tera Fighting Focus Blast OHKOes Baxcalibur and Garganacl and even has a good chance to OHKO Ting-Lu at +2 after Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Tera Fairy allows Hisuian Zoroark to hold off Dark-types as well as become immune to Dragapult's Dragon-type attacks. Focus Sash guarantees that Hisuian Zoroark has a chance to set up or attack. On the other hand, Life Orb can be used to add further power to Hisuian Zoroark's already formidable prowess. Life Orb allows Focus Blast to OHKO Baxcalibur, and it also ensures that +2 Shadow Ball OHKOes Volcarona, physically defensive Rotom-W, and Corviknight after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark functions best as a setup sweeper on hyper and bulky offense teams. Great Tusk is a top-class partner, providing Hisuian Zoroark invaluable utility with its excellent defenses and Rapid Spin, which keeps entry hazards off Hisuian Zoroark's side of the field and leaves its Focus Sash intact. It also provides Hisuian Zoroark more opportunities to come in and set up by threatening Pokemon that hold it down indefinitely, such as Clodsire. Dragapult and Meowscarada are faster than Hisuian Zoroark, so Pokemon that can come in and revenge kill them, such as Kingambit and Choice Band Baxcalibur, are also appreciated. In return, Hisuian Zoroark can use Illusion to mask itself as Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Roaring Moon and lure in physical walls like defensive Great Tusk and Dondozo to weaken or KO them. Entry hazard setters like Glimmora, Meowscarada, and Garchomp set up hazards to chip down foes into Hisuan Zoroark's KO range, and it can stop an incoming Rapid Spin from Great Tusk in return. Hisuian Zoroark can force damage on special walls like Ting-Lu, which is highly appreciated by other special attackers like Iron Moth and Hydreigon, and vice versa. In particular, Hydreigon and Hisuian Zoroark can play Illusion mind games with Fighting-type moves, and Hydreigon can topple Clodsire with Earth Power and Substitute or Tera Steel.</p> "

Hisuian Zoroark also likes to disguise itself as the previously mentioned Dragapult and Gholdengo due to them also using Substitute and Hex, potentially tricking opponents and forming a very formidable Hex spam core. Mimikyu aids against Dark-types like Kingambit and Roaring Moon and provides useful priority in Shadow Sneak. Additionally, Mimikyu appreciates Hisuian Zoroark withering down and burning the majority of opposing teams, letting Mimikyu clean up late-game without any complications. Brambleghast helps Hisuian Zoroark chip down opposing teams with Spikes, removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and checks Water-types such as Rotom-W, Slowking, and Barraskewda.

Additionally, it can win the Ghost matchup with good prediction, which is a type that Normal teams usually struggle against. Trick lets Hisuian Zoroark ruin defensive answers, such as Toxapex and Ting-Lu, that would otherwise take its attacks with ease. Flamethrower allows Hisuian Zoroark to hit Steel-types like Corviknight and Iron Treads more reliably than Focus Blast, while Grass Knot hits Dondozo, which would otherwise take Hisuian Zoroark's attacks. Focus Blast lets Hisuian Zoroark eliminate troublesome Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Ting-Lu. Illusion lets Hisuian Zoroark bait in defensive answers to other threats, such as Corviknight and Toxapex switching into Maushold, and hinder them with Trick while also giving it a safe opportunity to switch into Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p>Maushold greatly appreciates Hisuian Zoroark's ability to remove Ghost- and Steel-types, alongside its ability to hinder and remove Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Corviknight, to enable it to clean up with Population Bomb. In return, Maushold can remove entry hazards with Tidy Up and break through answers to Hisuian Zoroark such as the aforementioned Toxapex and Ting-Lu. Choice Scarf Staraptor is another great partner, as it provides a safe switch-in to Choice Scarf Great Tusk, which tends to lock into Headlong Rush, while dealing high amounts of damage itself to enable Hisuian Zoroark to clean up the rest of an opponent's team. It also provides a form of speed control against faster threats such as Dragapult. Cyclizar also provides a safe switch-in with Shed Tail while keeping hazards off the field with Rapid Spin. In return, Hisuian Zoroark can use these switch-in opportunities to hit the aforementioned Steel-types hard. Ditto can turn setup attempts on a Choice-locked Hisuian Zoroark on their heads, while Blissey can take strong special hits such as Sandy Shocks's STAB moves. Indeedee provides Psychic Terrain support to improve Hisuian Zoroark's matchup against Kingambit, and it can also use a Choice Scarf to deal with fast threats such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Flamigo and provide Healing Wish support.</p> "

Sawsbuck's great Speed also makes for decent speed control, getting the jump on many other Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F and Indeedee-F and setup sweepers such as Quiver Dance Masquerain. However, Sawsbuck can also be unreliable at times, only Speed tying with threats like Choice Scarf Haunter and Trailblaze Houndoom and being outsped by Choice Scarf Alolan Dugtrio and Dragon Dance Charizard.

Regenerator allows Amoonguss to check those same threats long-term; it also prevents it from being worn down by pivots like Rotom-W and Tapu Koko as well as entry hazards if its Heavy-Duty Boots is removed via Knock Off. Spore incapacitates switch-ins such as Heatran, Volcarona, and Dragapult; the latter two would otherwise use it as setup fodder, while the former completely walls Amoonguss by being immune to Sludge Bomb. Sludge Bomb spreads status against the aforementioned Volcarona and Dragapult as well as bulkier switch-ins like Skeledirge and Tornadus-T and threatens Iron Valiant. Hidden Power Fire lets Amoonguss chip Poison-immune foes like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor as well as OHKO Kartana, preventing them from safely switching in. Heavy-Duty Boots lets it switch in as much as needed without fear of entry hazard damage; it also prevents Regenerator recovery from being stifled in longer games. Rocky Helmet is an alternative that wears down contact attackers like Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T as well as the aforementioned rain wallbreakers in Barraskewda and Floatzel. It should only be used if entry hazard control is decent enough, however, with support from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Rotom-W. Tera Water provides invaluable resistances against Fire and Ice, letting Amoonguss potentially get an emergency Sludge Bomb or Spore in against foes like Weavile and Heatran. Tera Steel is an alternative that lets Amoonguss emergency check offensive foes like Tapu Lele while also giving it a better matchup against non-Heat Wave Tornadus-T; it also retains the Ice resistance given by Tera Water. Rotom-W is an excellent partner, as it stifles offensive and defensive Pokemon alike that Amoonguss struggles with, such as Heatran, Skeledirge, and Tornadus-T. In return, Amoonguss takes pressure off Rotom-W as a check to rain wallbreakers and can deal with Rotom-W switch-ins like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth. Gholdengo completely counters Amoonguss by virtue of its immunity to Spore and it taking negligible damage from Hidden Power Fire; as such, checks to it such as Kingambit and Poison Jab Clodsire are recommended, with the latter forcing Gholdengo to Terastallize so it can freely fish for poison.</p> "

However, Alomomola is quite passive, succumbs to Koraidon and Chien-Pao after they have boosted their Attack or Terastallized, and is easily trapped by Gothitelle. Whirlpool's passive damage makes up for Alomomola's poor offenses and prevents double switches from the opponent. Play Rough hits Koraidon and Chien-Pao decently hard, and it prevents Miraidon from switching into Alomomola relatively freely. Minimum Speed investment ensures that Corviknight cannot exploit Alomomola to get off a slower U-turn to gain momentum. Tera Fairy resists Koraidon's Fighting-type STAB moves as well as Chien-Pao's Crunch, and it is immune to Dragon-type attacks such as Koraidon's Outrage and Choice-locked Miraidon and Walking Wake's Draco Meteor. Rocky Helmet prevents passivity by punishing Pokemon like Koraidon, Great Tusk, and Chien-Pao. Alomomola appreciates being paired with special walls that can check Pokemon like Miraidon, Iron Bundle, and Flutter Mane for it, such as Clodsire, Blissey, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu. The latter two also especially benefit from Alomomola's Wish due to their lack of reliable recovery. Skeledirge and Gholdengo are also effective partners since they check Breloom for Alomomola. Alomomola requires an entry hazard remover in Great Tusk, Corviknight, or Iron Treads, as it is likely 2HKOed by Choice Scarf Koraidon's Close Combat or Choice Band Chien-Pao's Crunch after Stealth Rock. Alomomola should also be used in tandem with secondary defensive Koraidon checks such as defensive Great Tusk or Skeledirge—which also checks Breloom for it—or speed control in the form of Iron Bundle, Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Choice Scarf Koraidon, or Choice Scarf Miraidon to revenge kill Koraidon and Chien-Pao at +2.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Alomomola is a defining aspect of stall teams, as its huge HP stat and unique combination of Wish and Regenerator let it keep itself healthy while repeatedly pivoting out to and healing teammates such as Dondozo, reducing their reliance on low-PP recovery moves and compensating for their lack of reliable recovery. Furthermore, its excellent typing and great physical bulk allow it to check threats like Cinderace and Dragonite and absorb Knock Off from common Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads, preserving its teammate's Heavy-Duty Boots. Whirlpool further enhances Alomomola's pivoting abilities, letting it trap switch-ins and pivot out to the appropriate answer while preventing their double switch. In conjunction with Protect, Whirlpool also racks up passive damage on offensive Pokemon and walls such as Rotom-W and Ting-Lu that lack reliable recovery. Protect also allows Alomomola to heal itself with Wish, scout the moves of powerful wallbreakers, and prevent them from forcing progress when paired with Future Sight. Chilling Water makes Alomomola a more self-sufficient physical wall, reducing its passivity against sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Ceruledge, and Bulk Up Great Tusk. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Alomomola to avoid entry hazard damage before getting struck by Knock Off, which is especially important against Toxic Spikes. Minimizing Alomomola's Speed allows it to underspeed Corviknight to hit the incoming switch-in from U-turn instead and thus, avoid wasting PP due to Pressure. Tera Flying improves Alomomola's matchup against Great Tusk and Meowscarada, turning it into an even better Knock Off absorber, and lets it wall Breloom. It also makes Alomomola immune to Spikes and allows it to take less passive damage from Salt Cure.</p> <p>Alomomola's Wish and ability to blanket check various threats benefit all of its teammates on stall teams. Toxapex is an exceptional partner that forms a strong Regenerator core with Alomomola. Together, they can stall Garganacl out of Salt Cure PP and pivot around strong physical attackers such as Breloom, Choice Band Dragapult, and Roaring Moon. Dondozo handles physical sweepers too powerful for Alomomola to deal with, such as Kingambit and Azumarill, and greatly appreciates Wish due to its lack of reliable recovery. Alomomola's low special bulk mandates sturdy specially defensive partners; Clodsire can take on special sweepers such as Gholdengo and Hydreigon that attempt to use Alomomola as setup fodder, while Blissey switches into the tier's most powerful special wallbreakers, such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Hisuian Zoroark. Ting-Lu checks special attackers like Dragapult and Iron Moth and, alongside Clodsire and Toxapex, sets entry hazards that can quickly wear down offensive teams to let Alomomola apply more pressure with Whirlpool. Like Dondozo, it also greatly appreciates Wish to reduce its reliance on Rest. Talonflame carries Defog to account for Alomomola's vulnerability to entry hazards after taking Knock Off. Corviknight can do the same as well as absorb Knock Off for Alomomola. In addition, Talonflame checks Breloom, while Corviknight checks Meowscarada, which lets Alomomola preserve its Terastallization. Lastly, Gholdengo checks Breloom and Iron Valiant, appreciates Alomomola dealing with Cinderace and Great Tusk, and provides stall with a setup sweeper to break down balance teams with Nasty Plot.</p> "

Roost gives Braviary reliable recovery and helps it heal off recoil it takes from using Brave Bird as well as giving it more opportunities to use Substitute. Substitute can take advantage of Pokemon such as Appletun and Lurantis while also allowing Braviary to avoid status from Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Sandaconda, and Umbreon. Tera Dark allows Braviary to stop Prankster from Sableye, allowing it to take advantage of it via a Substitute or Bulk Up. Alternatively, Tera Ground gives Braviary a more favorable matchup versus Electric-type Pokemon like Rotom and Eelektross as well as a Rock resistance; (SC) however, the resulting Grass weakness means it can no longer switch in on Lurantis and Appletun as freely. Tera Fighting can be used with Close Combat over Substitute for more overall power and the ability to take down Flying-type answers like Magneton while also gaining a resistance to Rock-type moves, but doing so makes Braviary vulnerable to status moves.</p> <p>Braviary struggles with faster threats with super effective coverage, often forcing it to Terastalize. As a result, specially defensive walls such as Blissey, Eelektross, and Umbreon pair well with it, with the former being notable for supporting Braviary with Wish, as Braviary will not be able to Roost easily due to its average Speed and large number of checks. Physically defensive walls such as Sandaconda and Sableye can also be useful to check Pokemon such as Tauros, Paldean Tauros, and Bombirdier. Pokemon with access to status moves such as Sableye if you are not running Tera Dark and Qwilfish if you are not running Substitute can also be troublesome for Braviary, so status absorbers such as Blissey and Hisuian Qwilfish can help with this problem. Braviary also dislikes Rocky Helmet users such as Sandaconda and Qwilfish, as the recoil can add up with Brave Bird over time. To deal with this, item disruption from Trick and Knock Off on Pokemon like Rotom, Sableye, and Samurott is ideal.</p> "

          "description": "<p>With Nasty Plot, well-rounded stats, great coverage, and rather decent Speed, Hydreigon makes for a great wallbreaker. Substitute allows it to set up Nasty Plot safely, avoid would-be detrimental threats such as Garganacl's Salt Cure and status from Toxapex, Clodsire, and Rotom-W, and take advantage of the switches it forces. For its fourth move, Hydreigon can utilize Earth Power to dent Pokemon that can comfortably take a Dark Pulse such as Kingambit, Toxapex, and Garganacl. Alternatively, Flash Cannon provides coverage against Fairy-types, being able to OHKO Iron Valiant and Hatterene after a Nasty Plot, as well as having good chance to 2HKO Tera Fairy Garganacl and Skeledirge unboosted if running Life Orb. Draco Meteor can also be used as a strong neutral coverage option to straight up OHKO Great Tusk and dent Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Amoonguss. With Tera Steel, Hydreigon acquires a better defensive typing, turning its weaknesses into resistances, improving its matchups against would-be threats like Dragonite, Dragapult, Walking Wake, Roaring Moon, and Baxcalibur. Tera Steel also boosts its Flash Cannon, able to OHKO Hatterene unboosted with Life Orb. Tera Poison can also be used to grant Hydreigon a Fighting resistance and more importantly, resisting both of Iron Valiant's STAB moves. Both Tera types also give Hydreigon the ability to switch into Toxapex and Clodsire safely due to their immunity to poison, and they both work well with Levitate, which provides an immunity against an otherwise super effective attack.</p> <p>Hydreigon best fits on various offense and balance teams. Rotom-W is a good teammate since it can spread paralysis against faster Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Dragapult and bring Hydreigon in safely on walls like Amoonguss and Toxapex via Volt Switch. Other defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Skeledirge make for good teammates since they can switch into Iron Valiant, Breloom, and Volcarona. Faster offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult match up well against offensive teams that can overwhelm Hydreigon easily by KOing Pokemon like opposing Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark, respectively. In return, Hydreigon can overwhelm Pokemon that they typically struggle with such as Skeledirge and Kingambit. Entry hazards from the likes of Garganacl, Clodsire, and Glimmora are appreciated to wear down foes into Hydreigon's KO range; the former two Pokemon can also check Volcarona and Choice Specs Dragapult defensively, which would otherwise revenge kill Hydreigon easily—even if it's behind a Substitute—thanks to Bug Buzz and Infiltrator. If Hydreigon isn't running Earth Power, teammates that can deal with Kingambit such as Breloom and Great Tusk are appreciated; Great Tusk can also remove Stealth Rock so Hydreigon isn't worn down easily, especially if it's running Life Orb. The two of them can also handle Ting-Lu, which can otherwise wall Hydreigon and phaze it with Whirlwind. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Dragonite appreciate Hydreigon threatening Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Dondozo for them to sweep more easily.</p> "

Flamethrower threatens Steel-types like Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Kingambit, while Earth Power aids in the Poison matchup, hitting Clodsire, Skuntank, and Toxapex. Alternatively, Flash Cannon may be used to threaten Fairy-types like Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Gardevoir behind Substitute. Substitute alongside Leftovers makes Hydreigon difficult to revenge kill and offers more setup opportunities against passive Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Klefki, and Forretress. Alternatively, Taunt prevents Ting-Lu from phazing Hydreigon with Whirlwind as well as obstructing Clodsire, Dondozo, and Gastrodon's recovery attempts. Draco Meteor is a niche option to OHKO opposing Dragon-types like Baxcalibur and Dragalge; however, Draco Meteor negates Nasty Plot boosts and requires Hydreigon to give up useful utility.</p> <p>Hydreigon's ability to break past physical walls such as Quagsire, Skeledirge, and Dondozo is heavily appreciated by Baxcalibur and Dragonite. In return, Baxcalibur checks Clodsire, Dragonite, and opposing Hydreigon, while Dragonite threatens Quaquaval and Cinderace. Cyclizar sets up Shed Tail for non-Substitute Hydreigon, allowing for more setup opportunities and freeing up a moveslot for Hydreigon. Furthermore, Cyclizar removes Stealth Rock off the field with Rapid Spin, preserving Hydreigon's ability to set up. Dragapult combats Flutter Mane, Gallade, and opposing Dragon-types, while Hydreigon forces Kingambit off the field and switches into Shadow Sneak from Brambleghast and Ceruledge. Garchomp sets up entry hazards to enhance Hydreigon's wallbreaking capabilities and helps to take care of Clodsire and Volcarona.

Flamethrower hits Steel-types like Corviknight, Kingambit, and Iron Treads; however, Earth Power hits Hisuian Goodra, Toxapex, and Alolan Muk. Stealth Rock is appreciated to allow Ting-Lu to use Spikes while also capitalizing on the many switches Hydreigon forces.

In return, Hydreigon uses Toxapex and Quagsire as setup fodder. Sableye provides a Fighting-type immunity and Will-O-Wisp support, discouraging Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Sneasler, and Quaquaval from using their STAB moves. Meowscarada and Greninja are great in the Grass and Water matchups, eliminating Quaquaval, Ice Beam Gastrodon, and Azumarill. Additionally, Meowscarada threatens Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, while Greninja breaks (remove double space) past Unaware Clodsire. Kingambit checks Fairy-types like Hatterene and Flutter Mane while also picking off faster threats like Dragapult, Spectrier, and Barraskewda after a few Supreme Overlord boosts. In return, Kingambit values Hydreigon's ability to remove roadblocks like Great Tusk and Urshifu-R. Ting-Lu provides entry hazards and phazing with Whirlwind to wear down defensive checks, while Alolan Muk is an additional asset in the Fairy and Dragon matchup, taking on Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Walking Wake. Choice Scarf Hoopa-U threatens Chien-Pao, Clodsire, and hinders Hydreigon's checks with Trick while appreciating Alolan Muk's removal in return.</p> "

          "description": "<p>With its solid natural bulk and good defensive typing in conjunction with Levitate, Hydreigon serves as a trapper that checks and eliminates Pokemon like Skeledirge and Mega Charizard Y lacking Focus Blast. Fire Spin traps and accumulates chip on a myriad of defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex, Ting-Lu, Gastrodon, and Clodsire. Earth Power, in combination with Fire Spin, increases the damage that the aforementioned Pokemon take while also threatening Heatran. Alternatively, Dark Pulse can be used as a solid STAB move to hit airborne Pokemon such as Gliscor. Taunt prevents passive walls such as Toxapex and Gastrodon from healing while also preventing Hydreigon from being crippled by status from the aforementioned Pokemon as well. Tera Poison gives Hydreigon a Toxic immunity and a favorable defensive typing, allowing it to safely trap Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Iron Valiant. Offensive teammates like Mega Lopunny, Volcarona, and Dragapult appreciate Hydreigon trapping and removing walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Gastrodon support Hydreigon, as they heavily chip and pressure switch-ins like Kingambit in combination with Hydreigon's Fire Spin. Hydreigon is easily forced out by Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, and Iron Valiant. As such, Pokemon that can handle the aforementioned threats such as Gholdengo, Clodsire, and Toxapex make great teammates for it.</p> "

Flamethrower is the go-to STAB move for Volcarona, as it hits Steel- and Ice-types such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Chien-Pao. Optionally, Fiery Dance can be used over Flamethrower, which has an additional effect of boosting Special Attack, but Flamethrower is preferred due to a higher Base Power. Psychic primarily covers Poison-types like Toxapex, Glimmora, and Iron Moth, but it also hits Fighting-types such as Quaquaval and Great Tusk. Morning Sun provides reliable recovery, which allows Volcarona to further set up and threaten to sweep. Alternatively, Giga Drain targets Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Quagsire, Greninja, and Gastrodon. Bug Buzz can be used over Psychic to hit Dark- and Psychic-types such as Hydreigon, Ting-Lu, and Espathra. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Volcarona safe from entry hazards, while Flame Body debilitates physical attackers. A Timid nature allows Volcarona to outspeed Choice Scarf Flamigo after a single Quiver Dance boost.</p> <p>Volcarona and Scizor make a great pair, as Scizor—thanks to its Steel-typing—helps Volcarona by switching into Toxic from Clodsire, and it deals with Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Lycanroc thanks to Bullet Punch. Volcarona appreciates entry hazard support from Forretress, which pressures and wears down the opposing team. Choice Scarf Heracross helps against Steel- and Dark-types—such as Iron Treads and Kingambit—and Flying-types—like Kilowattrel—with Close Combat and Stone Edge, respectively; in return, Volcarona helps deal with Corviknight, which Heracross struggles to break. Slither Wing threatens Flying- and Water-types such as Iron Jugulis, Pelipper, and Greninja with Wild Charge, and threatens Corviknight with Flare Blitz. It can safely pivot in Volcarona, enabling its sweep. Both Slither Wing and Heracross pressure specially defensive walls such as Clodsire and Blissey, which Volcarona struggles to break. Lokix helps against Ghost-, Psychic- and Dark-types like Skeledirge, Espathra, Armarouge, Meowscarada, and Greninja thanks to First Impression, Throat Chop, and Sucker Punch. Volcarona appreciates Sticky Web support from Masquerain or Spidops to deal with Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Iron Treads and Iron Moth.</p> "

          "description": "<p>A potent offensive presence, Volcarona's access to Quiver Dance provides the backbone to its sweeping capabilities. Bug Buzz is Volcarona's main attacking option and can be combined with Swarm to increase damage as Volcarona loses HP while setting up, allowing Volcarona to OHKO checks like offensive Garchomp after one Quiver Dance. Psychic is essential, as it allows Volcarona to hit one of Fire's strongest checks, Toxapex, but also super effectively damages Poison-types and Fighting-types such as Glimmora and Quaquaval. The last slot is interchangeable, though generally Flamethrower is preferred as a STAB move that can also take advantage of sun support on Fire teams and is essential to for the Flying matchup, allowing it to hit Corviknight and Kilowattrel. Giga Drain can be used to give Volcarona a better chance of breaking through Water and Ground teams and give it a recovery option. Similarly, Morning Sun gives Volcarona more setup opportunities. Flame Body can also be used to threaten burns on Pokemon such as Kingambit and Dragonite, which oftentimes revenge kill Volcarona. Given its all-around solid defensive stats, Volcarona finds a myriad of opportunities to set up and takes advantage of the maximum Speed spread given to capitalize on the boosts as much as possible, outspeeding Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk or Choice Scarf Dragapult after one or two Quiver Dance boosts, respectively.</p> <p>Generally, Volcarona is best saved for mid- to late-game, when the opposing team has been chipped down and Volcarona has an opportunity to sweep after setting up. Utilizing its offensive teammates such as Scovillain, Ceruledge, Cinderace, and Paldean Tauros-F to slowly chip down defensive walls such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Blissey provides better opportunity for Volcarona to sweep later in the game. Paldean Tauros-F is specifically useful with its ability to remove dual screens, preventing Volcarona's setup from being hindered. Rotom-H also provides excellent support, aiding in the Water matchup if Giga Drain is not used and providing pivot support to switch Volcarona in. Skeledirge and Talonflame provide defensive support to wear down offensive threats such as Dragonite. Torkoal providing sun support on Fire aids Volcarona, not only increasing Flamethrower's damage output, but giving Volcarona the opportunity to survive attacks like Choice Specs Greninja's Surf, giving it an opportunity to set up.</p> "

These physical attackers, in addition to Lokix and Scizor, are able to break through specially defensive walls, like Chansey and Mantine, that Volcarona struggles against. Araquanid and Armaldo provide helpful entry hazards in Sticky Web and Stealth Rock, respectively, to make sweeping mid- or late-game much easier.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Volcarona is one of the top setup sweepers that Fire has access to, with Quiver Dance allowing it to become a dangerous threat to teams unequipped to deal with it defensively. Psychic allows Volcarona to pressure Fighting and Poison teams, especially after one Quiver Dance, which lets Volcarona outspeed and beat Keldeo, Glimmora, and Crobat. Similarly, Giga Drain does the same to Water and Ground teams after one Quiver Dance, threatening Tapu Fini, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Bug Buzz covers the Psychic and Dark matchups very well and allows it to hit Roaring Moon, Ting-Lu, and Latias, which would otherwise be a challenge to deal with. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Volcarona from being worn down by entry hazards, most notably Stealth Rock, which would otherwise stop Volcarona from being able to set up safely. Psychium Z lets Volcarona OHKO Toxapex with a +1 Shattered Psyche and beat otherwise troublesome threats like +1 Kommo-o, Iron Hands, and Clodsire. Cinderace and Mega Charizard X are especially good partners due to their ability to break through special walls such as Blissey, Clodsire, and Galarian Slowking with relative ease. Entry hazard removers such as Torkoal, Rotom-H, and Court Change Cinderace are near necessities if Volcarona is running Psychium Z. Torkoal and Rotom-H can also provide excellent utility in the form of Stealth Rock and dual screens, respectively, to help Volcarona sweep more easily. Volcanion is also an excellent partner for Volcarona that, thanks to its Water immunity, can act as a strong pivot into Pokemon like Azumarill and Mantine, which could revenge kill it or clear Quiver Dance boosts with Haze.</p> "

U-Turn allows it to pivot on the likes of Heatran and Gholdengo and bring offensive teammates like Iron Valiant and Great Tusk in. Tornadus-T is an excellent Defogger with its natural longevity and positive matchups against common hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and defensive Garchomp. However, Taunt is an alternative to deny defensive Pokemon such as Clodsire and Skeledirge from healing, as well as preventing Annihilape from boosting. Taunt can also shut down status and hazard attempts from the likes of Ferrothorn and Ting-Lu. Knock Off is a fantastic tool to make progress, removing the Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from Rotom-W, Gholdengo, and Toxapex, which would otherwise switch into Tornadus-T. Heat Wave is an alternative option to hit Ferrothorn, Gholdengo, and Mega Scizor for major damage, keeping hazards off against the former and preventing the latter two from boosting freely. Flyinium Z is a rare option over Heavy-Duty Boots for more immediate damage against Stealth Rock users like Landorus-T and Garchomp. Tornadus-T rarely Terastallizes, although Tera Steel can be useful in a pinch to resist Mega Lopunny's Return, Dragonite's Extreme Speed, and opposing Tornadus-T's Hurricane. The given Speed EVs allow Tornadus-T to outspeed unboosted Iron Valiant, with defensive EVs helping it check Mega Lopunny and Great Tusk. Tornadus-T fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, providing the overall team with valuable longevity and pivoting while wearing down the opposition and removing entry hazards. Tornadus-T pairs fantastically with Spikes users such as Ferrothorn and Gastrodon, as its Knock Off lets Spikes dig into Heavy-Duty Boots users. Additionally, they help Tornadus-T with its Electric weakness whilst Tornadus-T shores up their Fighting and Grass weaknesses. Powerful attackers such as Iron Valiant and Dragapult appreciate Tornadus-T giving them safe entry against common Steel-types such as Heatran and Gholdengo, to make up for their frailty. Tornadus-T can be vulnerable to Pursuit from the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit, so Pokemon that can exploit them such as Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, Great Tusk, and Iron Valiant make good partners. Tornadus-T also functions excellently on rain teams alongside Pelipper and Mega Swampert, as the rain makes Hurricane reliable and the other team members appreciate it pivoting into Grass-type moves.</p> "

Hurricane is preferred over Bleakwind Storm, as the extra Base Power and confusion chance can be vital in muscling past bulky targets such as Clodsire, especially if forgoing Knock Off. Focus Blast and Heat Wave provide coverage against Steel-types, with the former also hitting Mega Tyranitar and Heatran while the latter KOs Gholdengo. Knock Off allows Tornadus to weaken checks such as Rotom-W and Zapdos to muscle past them with entry hazard support. It also cripples common Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Clodsire, Gastrodon, and Tapu Koko. Taunt is an alternative to shut down passive Pokemon such as Clodsire and Ting-Lu, which pack Toxic and phazing, respectively. Defog is a niche option on teams that appreciate the resulting role compression. Flyinium Z provides an accurate one-time nuke that can break past resistant Pokemon such as Rotom-W after a boost and mild chip damage, as well as heavily damaging the likes of Landorus-T and opposing Tornadus-T unboosted. 4 HP EVs maximize the recovery Tornadus-T receives from Regenerator. Tornadus-T fits best on stall and bulky balance teams, giving them a great way to close out games and revenge kill foes. Because of its relative frailty, it requires bulky cores to fall back on when a revenge killer forces it out. Unaware users such as Skeledirge and Clodsire pair excellently with it, handling the strong boosting sweepers that easily overpower Tornadus-T, while it provides Regenerator in return to switch into weak attacks without wasting their recovery PP. Toxapex also makes a great partner, as the two together form a double Regenerator core that staves off residual damage from the likes of Garganacl and burns from opposing Toxapex and Gastrodon. Toxapex additionally pivots into many Pokemon that outspeed Tornadus-T, including Zamazenta, Dragapult, Weavile, and Barraskewda in rain.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Courtesy of its special bulk, Speed tier, and Regenerator, Assault Vest Tornadus-T is able to pivot into numerous special attackers such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Lele. U-turn allows Tornadus-T to pivot out of these attackers and bring in its own threatening teammates, such as Mega Diancie and Zamazenta, against passive switchins - such as Rotom-W and Heatran. Knock Off cripples offensive and defensive Pokemon alike, removing items such as Choice Specs from Dragapult, Leftovers from Rotom-W and Gholdengo, and Heavy-Duty Boots from Clodsire, allowing Tornadus-T's teammates to more easily withstand these Pokemon. Heat Wave allows Tornadus-T to threaten Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, preventing Ferrothorn from setting entry hazards and Scizor from using Tornadus-T as setup fodder. Alternatively, Superpower hits Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar much harder, exploiting their attempts to Pursuit trap Tornadus-T. Tera Steel allows Tornadus-T to withstand Psychic- and Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Tapu Lele and Dragapult in a pinch as well as Stealth Rock, while Tera Water provides a more solid overall defensive type with fewer exploitable weaknesses, as well as providing insurance against Volcarona. The given HP EVs maximize Tornadus-T's recovery from Regenerator, while the Speed EVs allow Tornadus-T to outspeed Iron Valiant. Tornadus-T fits best on bulky offense and offense teams that appreciate its ability to withstand powerful special attackers while keeping momentum with U-turn. Wallbreakers such as Mega Diancie, Zamazenta, and Urshifu-R enjoy Tornadus-T as a fallback measure, switching into revenge killers like Tapu Lele and Dragapult. Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Gholdengo appreciate the extra insurance Tornadus-T provides against special attackers, allowing them to run more physically defensive and offensive sets, respectively. Tornadus-T's Stealth Rock weakness means it can be difficult to pivot into entry with hazards up, so it pairs well with solid hazard removal options such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Great Tusk. The aforementioned Pokemon also make up for Tornadus-T's relative physical frailty, being able to check the likes of Mega Lopunny and Dragonite.</p> "

Focus Blast grants Tornadus-T excellent neutral coverage and is able to hit most Steel- and Rock-types, like Heatran and Tyranitar, hard. Heat Wave, however, has the benefit of nailing Jirachi, Gholdengo, and Corviknight, which makes it a better option against Psychic, Ghost, and, if using Knock Off, Steel teams. In the last slot, Taunt is preferred, so Tornadus-T can safely set up on walls like Toxapex and Ting-Lu, but Knock Off's ability to cripple the likes of defensive Heatran and Galarian Slowking is worth considering. Tornadus-T has a very poor matchup against Electric-types, so Pokemon that can deal with them, such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, are must-haves. They're also able to lay down Stealth Rock and have access to Defog, making them incredible teammates. Similarly, Corviknight and Celesteela stomach most Ice-type attacks aimed at Tornadus-T, thanks to their bulk and Steel typing. Mega Charizard Y forms a terrifying wallbreaking duo alongside Tornadus-T that breaks down shared checks such as Heatran and Blissey. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite and Agility Thundurus-T greatly appreciate Tornadus-T weakening or removing walls for them. 88 HP and 8 Special Defense EVs can be used over Special Attack to ensure Tornadus-T lives an Ice Beam from Choice Scarf Greninja from full health.</p> "

Sludge Bomb hits Grass-types like Rotom-C and Breloom as well as easing the Fairy matchup alongside Iron Treads and Clodsire, while Psychic threatens Urshifu-R and Air Balloon Glimmora and pops Gholdengo's Air Balloon, as Landorus is walled by it otherwise. Nasty Plot renders Landorus completely unwallable, notably letting it OHKO Corviknight. Alternatively, Rock Slide can be used to catch Volcarona, Zapdos, and Frosmoth off guard; however, it forces Landorus to use the suboptimal Naive nature and should only be used if teammates don't have answers for the listed targets. Substitute is a great option on Landorus because of the amount of switches it forces as well as making Kingambit's Sucker Punch easier to outplay.</p> <p>Landorus appreciates Water Absorb Clodsire and Storm Drain Gastrodon switching into Water-type Pokemon like Barraskewda, Walking Wake, and Basculegion-F. Choice Scarf Great Tusk threatens Pokemon with Ice-type coverage like Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Greninja. Iron Treads provides support in the Fairy matchup and provides pivoting with Volt Switch, luring switch-ins like Corviknight and Volcarona for Landorus to take advantage of. Furthermore, Iron Treads removes Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin and enhances Landorus's wallbreaking with Knock Off, removing recovery items like Leftovers and Black Sludge from Rotom-W and Amoonguss. Additionally, Choice Scarf Iron Treads is a great asset in the Fairy matchup and threatens Ice-types like Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Sandy Shocks is a great teammate in the Flying and Water matchups, providing Gravity support and additional pivoting with Volt Switch. Quagsire is able to check Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur as well as providing entry hazards and chip damage with Toxic. Ting-Lu provides entry hazards and phazing to wear down the opponent's team for Landorus and appreciates the removal of Fighting-types. Ursaluna can switch into Ghost-type moves from faster opponents like Dragapult, Flutter Mane, and Hisuian Zoroark as well as aiding in heavily denting teams alongside Landorus. In return, Landorus provides a Fighting-type resistance and threatens Fighting-types with Psychic.</p> "

Focus Blast breaks through Kyurem, Ting-Lu, and Ferrothorn. Rock Polish enables Landorus as a late-game cleaner, shutting down revenge killing abilities from faster foes like Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and Greninja, while Nasty Plot allows Landorus to easily break past the likes of Blissey and Mega Sableye and become terrifying with Gravity-aided Earth Power spam. Rock Slide is another option to hit Volcarona, as it is dangerous once set up, as well as Mantine, Zapdos, and Araquanid; however, using it is very situational and forces Landorus to use an unpreferred nature. Gravity allows Landorus to ease the Flying and Steel matchups and easily spam Earth Power, increasing its potential to new heights and also supporting its teammates like Choice Band Sand Rush Excadrill. Gastrodon is a great teammate due to its ability to soak up Water-type moves from foes like Barraskewda and Mega Swampert, while Gastrodon appreciates Landorus's ability to threaten Grass-types with Sludge Wave. Mamoswine is heavily valued as a sponge for Ice-type moves due to its ability Thick Fat, taking on SubRoost Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales. In return, Mamoswine cleans up Flying teams once Landorus deals with Celesteela, Corviknight, or Skarmory. Choice Scarf or Bulk Up Great Tusk forms a great wallbreaking core, taking out threats like Triple Axel Mega Lopunny and Dragonite, while also appreciating Gravity support. Clodsire provides entry hazards to chip down walls for Landorus, switches into revenge killers like Meowscarada and Tapu Koko, and counters Volcarona with Unaware so Landorus doesn't need to use Rock Slide. Mega Steelix is valued in the Ice and Fairy matchups, taking on Alolan Ninetales, Tapu Koko, Azumarill, and Weavile.

This, combined with its typing, natural bulk, and exceptional ability in Intimidate, makes it a good offensive pivot. U-turn is useful for generating momentum and bringing in teammates safely when the foe is forced to switch out. Stone Edge hits Flying-types such as Enamorus, Zapdos, Dragonite, and Moltres, notably providing good coverage alongside Earthquake. Grass Knot is crucial for hitting Great Tusk, which would otherwise comfortably take Landorus-T's physical attacks. It is also the best option for hitting Dondozo and Tera Water, Curse, or Iron Defense Garganacl. Tera Ground can be used to boost Landorus-T's already strong Earthquake, potentially helping it clean late-game when all Ground-immune foes have been removed. Tera Blast can be used alongside Tera Flying, as it still hits Great Tusk hard while also hitting Amoonguss and Zamazenta for super effective damage. It also guarantees an OHKO against Iron Valiant. Becoming pure Flying-type also lets Landorus-T potentially survive priority moves such as Aqua Jet from Hisuian Samurott in a pinch.</p> <p>Landorus-T fits well on balanced and bulky offense teams that appreciate speed control and the ability to generate momentum. Wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Enamorus appreciate being brought in safely with U-turn. Choice Specs Enamorus and Choice Specs Dragapult especially appreciate being in against certain Pokemon that commonly switch into Landorus-T, such as Great Tusk and defensive Zapdos. Offensive Zapdos can also take advantage of these Pokemon while forming a potent VoltTurn core with Landorus-T. Faster special attackers such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Enamorus are problematic for Landorus-T. Therefore, specially defensive Galarian Slowking is a solid teammate to help deal with them. It also consistently switches into Rotom-W, which takes very little from Landorus-T's attacks. Furthermore, Galarian Slowking forms a momentum-generating core with Landorus-T and provides Future Sight support, making Landorus-T more difficult for foes to switch into. Great Tusk forms a strong core alongside Landorus-T to deal with physical attackers such as Sneasler and Cinderace that tend to be overwhelming for one of them to take on alone. Notably, Landorus-T outspeeds Cinderace and can threaten it before getting burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Defensive Landorus-T is a reliable pivot on balance and bulky offensive teams, leveraging its good typing, bulk, and Intimidate to serve as a roadblock to common threats such as Kingambit, Sneasler, and Great Tusk without Ice Spinner. Its Spikes immunity and neutrality to Stealth Rock allow it to comfortably switch in and check the aforementioned Pokemon. Landorus-T is also an excellent Stealth Rock user thanks to its good matchups against key entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Cinderace. U-turn enables Landorus-T to pivot out of bad matchups and safely bring one of its teammates in. The last slot is flexible depending on a team's needs. Grass Knot deals high damage to Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Tera Water Garganacl, which could otherwise switch in and set up on Landorus-T, and it is useful to open up for teammates such as Kingambit to reliably clean late-game. However, Grass Knot also leaves Landorus-T quite exploitable to key Flying-types and Tera Flying Pokemon such as Moltres, Dragonite, and Kingambit, which can either cripple it with status or setup on it. Taunt is a useful utility move to stop entry hazards from Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and to prevent Enamorus-T and Garganacl from setting up. Finally, Smack Down deals decent damage to Landorus-T's common Flying-type switch-ins as well as Rotom-W, either leaving them vulnerable to Earthquake or forcing them out. 4 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Jolly Kingambit and deal good damage to it with Earthquake. As Landorus-T is a support Pokemon, it will often be more valuable to use Terastallization with other teammates. However, Tera Water lets Landorus-T resist Ice- and Water-type moves from Pokemon such as Greninja, Alolan Ninetales, and Walking Wake. Alternatively, Tera Ghost can be run to spinblock against Great Tusk while still maintaining its positive matchup against Fighting-type moves. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item, as it forces valuable chip damage on key targets such as Sneasler, Great Tusk, and Kingambit. Leftovers can also be run to grant Landorus-T a bit more longevity. Landorus-T typically fits quite well on teams with multiple pivot move users such as Sneasler, Cinderace, and Zapdos, as they can continually apply pressure to each other's counters, especially if entry hazards are up. Zapdos and Rotom-W have the added benefit of having good matchups against Flying-types, which Landorus-T struggles with. Galarian Slowking matches up quite well against strong special attackers such as Zapdos and Enamorus and appreciates Landorus-T's ability to pivot into physical attackers such Great Tusk, Kingambit, and Swords Dance Iron Valiant. Spikes setters such as Ting-Lu and Hisuian Samurott form a potent hazard-stacking core with Landorus-T and can pressure entry hazard removers such as Cinderace and Great Tusk. Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, and Choice Band Hoopa greatly benefit from Landorus-T's U-turn support, as it can position them to fire off their powerful attacks with little risk and can wear the opposing Pokemon down over time to be in their KO range. Landorus-T is quite exploitable by fast Water-types such as Battle Bond Greninja and Walking Wake; bulky Water-types such as Toxapex can help alleviate the pressure from these Pokemon. Landorus-T's ability to lure and overwhelm physical walls such as Dondozo and Great Tusk with Grass Knot is greatly appreciated by various physical setup sweepers such as Kingambit, Swords Dance Iron Valiant, and Hisuian Samurott.</p> "

          "description": "<p>This more offensive set allows Landorus-T to take advantage of its varied movepool and high attacking stats to cause headaches to common teambuilding structures in SV OU while still retaining its usefulness as an Intimidate pivot; as such, Substitute is essential mostly to ease prediction, but it can also catch unsuspecting players trying to use a status move on Landorus-T, such as Moltres's Will-O-Wisp or Amoonguss's Spore. Smack Down is important to let Landorus-T threaten a KO on Corviknight, Rotom-W, Zapdos, Moltres, or even Enamorus the next turn with Earthquake, and even if the opponent switches out, Earthquake is likely to strongly dent their team, unless they're running more than one Pokemon immune to Ground. Stone Edge, on top of its great coverage with Earthquake, provides a more immediate hit on Zapdos, which is useful for more offensive variants that outpace Landorus-T, as these force Landorus-T to take damage before being able to KO Zapdos. Stone Edge also OHKOes Moltres and Enamorus, but it comes at the price of being unable to dent Corviknight or Rotom-W, which is undesirable. Grass Knot rounds out Landorus-T's coverage as a way to do massive damage to Great Tusk; Garganacl after Iron Defense, Curse, or Tera Water; and Dondozo. Tera Water allows Landorus-T to turn its Ice and Water weaknesses around and thus better check Ice Spinner Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. A Naive nature is best alongside maximum Speed investment to make sure Landorus-T outpaces Great Tusk and most defensive Zapdos variants and Speed ties with other Landorus-T. 24 Special Attack EVs allow Landorus-T to 2HKO physically defensive Garganacl with Grass Knot if its Leftovers has been removed, but maximum Attack EVs can also be run instead.</p> <p>Substitute Landorus-T is commonly found on bulky offense and balance teams, bringing the gap between a wallbreaker and a bulky pivot. To aid its wallbreaking efforts, however, Landorus-T strongly appreciates Spikes support from the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu to help wear down its switch-ins, as Landorus-T commonly causes the opponent to switch around, and, most importantly, put Great Tusk in range of going down to a single Grass Knot. While Landorus-T has great coverage for most of the tier and is a strong wallbreaker against most balance and bulky offense teams, there are still a few Pokemon that it gives free switches to. Iron Defense Zamazenta doesn't take much from Landorus-T's Earthquake, especially with Dauntless Shield activated, and can use Landorus-T as setup fodder with Iron Defense. Physically defensive variants of Galarian Slowking, Moltres, and Zapdos help remedy this, and the former three also help bring Landorus-T for wallbreaking opportunities via Chilly Reception, Volt Switch, and U-turn. Calm Mind Cresselia is another dangerous setup sweeper that Landorus-T allows to come in for free. Kingambit and Encore Tera Dark or Steel Iron Valiant pose great answers to it while also appreciating Landorus-T spreading damage around for them to clean up, especially if an unsuspecting Great Tusk is taken out via Grass Knot. Great Tusk itself is also a great partner, as going with a more offensive set on Landorus-T makes it less reliable of a check to physical attackers, which Great Tusk helps handle; in return Great Tusk appreciates opposing Great Tusk being taken out via Grass Knot, making it easier for defensive variants to win the hazard game and offensive variants to sweep or dent the opposing team.</p> "

Low Kick is used to chip Hisuian Goodra as well as severely dent Iron Treads and Heatran that may be looking to switch in on it. Frail wallbreakers such as Chien-Pao and Galarian Zapdos appreciate Meloetta's ability to slow pivot, ensuring they get in safely. Physically defensive walls like Corviknight and Quaquaval pair well with Meloetta, as they can shore up its Knock Off weakness and vulnerability to strong physical attackers like Slither Wing. Meloetta is prone to entry hazards that impede its ability to take repeated attacks from Zapdos, Thundurus, and Inteleon, so hazard removers like Corviknight and Iron Treads make for good teammates. Meloetta can also struggle with mixed attackers like Magic Guard Volcanion and Heatran, so paring it with offensive pokemon like Regieleki and Galarian Zapdos that can threaten them out is advised. Meloetta also appreciates hazard support from setters like Garchomp and Ting-Lu so that attackers like Inteleon, Greninja, and Rotom-W cannot pivot for free.</p> "

          "description": "<p>When equipped with Choice Specs, Greninja becomes a potent wallbreaker thanks to its great coverage and Protean. Since Choice Specs ensures it only uses one attack per switch-in, even though Protean only activates once per switch-in, Greninja will have STAB every time it attacks. Hydro Pump is Greninja's most powerful move, pummeling both offensive and defensive Water-weak Pokemon like Cinderace, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk. Dark Pulse hits the likes of Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Hisuian Zoroark super effectively while also dealing the most damage to Toxapex and Rotom-W. Dark Pulse's flinch chance can also come in clutch against the aforementioned walls. Ice Beam eviscerates Amoonguss, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Dragon-types like Dragonite and Roaring Moon. Grass Knot can OHKO Dondozo, Garganacl, and Walking Wake after minor chip damage, and it deals good damage to lighter Water-types like Quaquaval and Azumarill. Alternatively, Spikes lets Greninja wear down checks like Toxapex while taking advantage of the switches it often forces. In addition, Greninja also beats common entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight, making Spikes easy to maintain. Tera Water further enhances Greninja's already powerful Hydro Pump to extreme levels, letting it OHKO Pokemon like Corviknight, Hatterene, and Unaware Clodsire. Meanwhile, Tera Dark lets Greninja 2HKO Toxapex and Rotom-W with Dark Pulse.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams as a menacing wallbreaker. Stealth Rock setters like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Glimmora are amazing for Spikes Greninja, as it can create a hazard-stacking core with them. Alternatively, these Pokemon can also let Greninja drop Spikes for Grass Knot, as they can set up hazards and Grass Knot overwhelming Dondozo and Walking Wake. Strong offensive Pokemon like Kingambit and mixed Iron Valiant make for excellent partners, as Greninja threatens their checks like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Garchomp for the former, and Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Clodsire for the latter. They can also threaten Pokemon that would otherwise revenge kill Greninja, such as Dragapult and Meowscarada, granting Greninja more consistency against teams with these Pokemon.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Greninja is an excellent dedicated lead due to its high Speed tier alongside Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and valuable utility options. It differentiates itself from Meowscarada due to its better matchup against other leads as well as entry hazard setters and removers such as Glimmora, Iron Treads, Garchomp, Toxic Spikes Iron Moth, and Court Change Cinderace. Taunt has various applications; it blocks Amoonguss's Spore, prevents entry hazards from the likes of Ting-Lu and leads like Glimmora and Iron Treads, stops Defog from Corviknight, and prevents setup from Pokemon Roaring Moon, Kingambit, and Tera Water Garganacl that attempt to exploit Greninja's relative passivity. Greninja can choose to run Toxic Spikes to punish offensive teams filled with setup sweepers like Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant better, but Ice Beam OHKOes Garchomp and dents Water-resistant Pokemon like Dragonite, Meowscarada, Dragapult, Tera Grass Glimmora, and Water Absorb Clodsire, especially if its Focus Sash is still intact for the former three. Focus Sash guarantees that Greninja can set at least one layer of entry hazards and works extremely well to safely put it into Torrent range, which allows Surf to OHKO Hisuian Zoroark and provides significant odds to OHKO Iron Valiant, one of the biggest threats to offense teams. Alternatively, Protean improves Ice Beam's damage and allows Greninja to block Volt Switch from Rotom-W, Iron Treads, and Sandy Shocks when using Spikes, maintaining offensive momentum. Tera Water boosts Greninja's Surf, notably netting the OHKO on specially defensive Garganacl and 2HKO on Tera Fairy Skeledirge with Torrent, as well as the 2HKO on Gholdengo and Corviknight after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Greninja is perfectly suited for hyper offense teams. Offensive teammates like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon put further pressure on entry hazard removers such as Corviknight, Iron Treads, and Great Tusk to maintain Greninja's Spikes throughout the game and enjoy Spikes chipping down their checks like Garganacl, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Dondozo. They also appreciate Spikes invalidating Focus Sash from Pokemon like Hisuian Zoroark, Ceruledge, and Meowscarada. Aside from possessing insane late-game potential themselves, Kingambit and Iron Moth particularly help against Meowscarada—one of the few leads that can easily beat Greninja—and Hatterene, which can freely switch into Greninja and reflect its Taunt and entry hazards with Magic Bounce, with Calm Mind variants using it as setup fodder as well. Kingambit in particular appreciates Greninja's tendency to faint early-game to accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts. Knock Off from Bulk Up Great Tusk and Swords Dance Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from walls like Dondozo, Slowking, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge, making them susceptible to Greninja's Spikes. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragon Dance Dragapult can spinblock the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch to keep Greninja's Spikes up; Gholdengo in particular does it exceptionally well by blocking Defog and Glimmora's Mortal Spin as well, and it has the added benefit of threatening Hatterene and crippling walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu with Choice item + Trick, making them more vulnerable to Greninja's entry hazards.</p> "

Aside from hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types like Bronzong and Gholdengo, Dark Pulse's lack of immunities makes it a spammable attack that can be used to muscle past neutral Pokemon such as Corviknight with flinches. Ice Beam covers a large portion of the metagame, including Dragon, Ground, Grass, and Flying teams, decimating prominent foes like Hydreigon, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Iron Jugulis.

Moreover, Barraskewda under rain excels at tearing down fast offensive teams that Greninja can struggle with, as it can threaten out Meowscarada, boosted Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Iron Moth. Quaquaval can also run Rapid Spin to let Greninja enter the field multiple times to wallbreak without worry, preventing it from being chipped down into KO range of priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Baxcalibur's Ice Shard. Pivot support from Slowking is helpful to bring Greninja in safely on foes like Dragalge and Gastrodon, letting it fire off attacks freely. Defensive teammates such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Gastrodon, and Quagsire can switch into potential revenge killers like Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Dragapult, and Slither Wing, respectively; notably, Gastrodon and Quagsire also provide entry hazards to take advantage of the countless switches that Greninja forces, putting the likes of Ting-Lu, Toxapex, and Assault Vest Iron Hands into Greninja's KO range, as well as switch into and check Electric-types such as Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks and Assault Vest Iron Hands.</p> "

Trick users, such as Rotom and Zoroark, can also bait in these foes and cripple them by giving them a Choice item, with Rotom deserving special mention for inviting in Lurantis and Appletun, which gives a Vivillon relatively free setup opportunity. Spikes support from the likes of Qwilfish and Cacturne is also appreciated to help wear down answers to Vivillon over time. Strong setup sweepers like Veluza, Dudunsparce, and Lycanroc, which all appreciate foes being put to sleep, also make for powerful partners in conjunction with Vivillon.</p> "

Fire Blast is the preferred STAB attack for its greater power, allowing Pyroar to always 2HKO foes like Tinkatuff and Gogoat, though Flamethrower is much more consistent for revenge killing purposes, dealing with faster but frailer Pokemon like Haunter and Rotom-F. Tera Blast is Pyroar's Normal STAB option due to its flexibility, functioning either a Normal STAB attack or a Tera type STAB attack. Will-O-Wisp cripples and chips down switch-ins like Klawf and Lumineon. Hyper Voice can also be used over either of these moves as a slightly more powerful and consistent Normal STAB attack. Taunt shuts down status attempts from foes like Skuntank and Misdreavus as well as recovery attempts from Pokemon like Quaxwell and Dunsparce while also denying entry hazards from Pokemon like Masquerain and greedy Carbink. Tera Ground allows Pyroar to threaten out the Rock- and Fire-types that resist its STAB attacks like Carbink, Klawf, and Houndoom while also allowing it to check Electric-types like Ampharos and Electrode. Tera Normal boosts Pyroar's damage output, allowing to do more damage to Water- and Fire-types like Golduck and Camerupt while removing its Water and Ground weaknesses. Lastly, Tera Grass functions similarly to Tera Ground, trading the latter's ability to hit Fire-types super effectively for better matchups against Raichu, Whiscash, Basculin, and Alolan Dugtrio.</p> <p>Pyroar is heavily effective on offensive builds that focus on wearing down shared checks. Despite it seeming like bad synergy, Fire-types like Charizard and Houndoom are recommended, as they can help force in and wear down shared checks that lack reliable recovery, like Carbink and Whiscash. Pyroar can also form a powerful offensive core with Water- and Ground-types like Golduck and Alolan Dugtrio, since they threaten the Rock- and Fire-types that Pyroar does not like. In return, Pyroar can threaten out their switch-ins, like Gogoat and Dartrix, while helping wear down a shared check in Misdreavus. Foes like Dugtrio and Choice Scarf Lycanroc-N can consistently force out a Pyroar that has not Terastallized, so switch-ins to them, such as Dachsbun and Gabite, are appreciated. Dachsbun can heal chip damage Pyroar has sustained with Wish, while Gabite provides entry hazards to wear down switch-ins that do not run Heavy-Duty Boots, like Quaxwell and Ampharos.</p> "

Tera Ghost allows Pyroar to turn the tables against common Fighting-types such as Toxicroak, Medicham, and Hisuian Sneasel that would usually destroy it.

It is also a solid switch-in to Water-types like Whiscash and Basculin, comfortably taking their STAB moves and threatening to OHKO them or set up. Bulk Up is what lets Gogoat become so threatening late-game, letting it take on physical attackers like Perserrker and Sawsbuck after a Bulk Up or two. Rock Slide is optimal coverage alongside Horn Leech, hitting Grass-type checks like Charizard, Honchkrow, and Articuno. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Gogoat ignore entry hazards, namely the otherwise debilitating Toxic Spikes. Water is the premier Tera type due to its overall defensive utility, reversing Gogoat's Fire weakness and making it take Flying- and Bug-type attacks more easily, which lets it set up on various foes it could not before such as Charizard, Rabsca, and Camerupt. However, Tera Rock gives Gogoat STAB on Rock Slide while still having it resist Fire and Flying, but it becomes vulnerable to Ground- and Steel-types like Gabite and Perrserker.

Its high-powered STAB moves—which can be boosted further by Swords Dance—hit almost the entire metagame neutrally; Acrobatics grants Hawlucha strong neutral coverage against the likes of Tornadus-T, Dragapult, and Tapu Lele, which is backed up by Close Combat to decimate Flying-resistant Pokemon like Kingambit, Garganacl, and Mega Tyranitar. Its item instantly activates Unburden under the corresponding Terrain and grants it setup opportunities from the Defense boost, especially in conjunction with Roost. Electric Seed helps against Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk and prevents revenge killing attempts from Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Weavile's Ice Shard, while Psychic Seed helps against Gholdengo, Volcarona, and Choice-locked Dragapult. Taunt or Substitute deals with problematic walls, ignoring status like Toxapex's Toxic and Skeledirge's Will-O-Wisp; Taunt also prevents their recovery and phazing as well as Defense-boosting attempts such as from Skarmory or Tera Water Buzzwole, while Substitute blocks Landorus-T's Intimidate and punishes the use of weak attacks like its U-turn, Garganacl's Salt Cure, and Alomomola's Scald. The bulk investment allows Hawlucha to survive Clefable's Moonblast, which is unnecessary if running Psychic Seed. 176 Speed EVs can be used instead to revenge kill +1 Dragon Dance Dragapult. Tera Flying boosts Hawlucha's Acrobatics, potentially OHKOing Clefable at +2 and letting it set up against defensive Tornadus-T if necessary. The corresponding Alolan Guardian is a mandatory teammate to reliably activate Hawlucha's Unburden; Tapu Koko provides dual screens and brings Hawlucha in safely on Tangrowth and Ferrothorn with U-turn, while Tapu Lele pressures Toxapex and overwhelms Gholdengo. Offensive Pokemon on hyper offense teams such as Iron Valiant, Volcarona, Dragonite, and Mega Gyarados help maintain offensive pressure against the opposition; notably, they can force damage onto shared checks like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, Zapdos, and Toxapex, respectively, for Hawlucha to sweep more easily.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Carving out a niche for itself as an entry hazard setter with good matchups against common threats such as Charizard and Articuno, Carbink is easily able to exploit the fact that many common offensive Pokemon will struggle to OHKO it, making entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field nearly guaranteed. Body Press further takes advantage of Carbink's naturally high Defense by allowing it to deal modest damage, especially to frail attackers such as Pyroar or Steel-types that may try to switch in, such as Perrserker or Alolan Dugtrio, although its reliance on Body Press to not be immensely passive can invite in opposing Misdreavus or other Pokemon that may choose to utilize Tera Ghost. Power Gem allows for Carbink to target common Pokemon in the tier that have a large Rock weakness, such as Charizard, Articuno, Masquerain, and Vespiquen, while also insuring that it is not entirely helpless against the aforementioned Misdreavus. Spikes allows Carbink to be of greater assistance to more fast-paced offensive teams, further exploiting its natural bulk to apply even more pressure to the opponent in the form of entry hazards. Rest allows for Carbink to somewhat make up for its lack of recovery, which helps it to still be a threat later in the game and to set hazards back up if they are removed. Lastly, Iron Defense allows Carbink to become a threatening sweeper by making it even more difficult to break through while also greatly increasing the damage done by Body Press. Heavy-Duty Boots helps Carbink by making it immune to opposing hazards, greatly increasing its longevity, while Leftovers allows for a small amount of passive recovery. Tera Fighting increases the damage of Body Press even further, while Tera Ghost allows for Carbink to block attempts at using Rapid Spin to clear away hazards. A more physically defensive spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with a Bold nature is also viable to improve Carbink's matchup against threats such as Gogoat and Dugtrio.</p> <p>Carbink's high success rate when it comes to setting up entry hazards is greatly appreciated by almost all teams, especially those that make use of setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Charizard or powerful breakers like Zangoose, which greatly benefit from the extra chip damage that Carbink provides. In addition, Grass-types such as Gogoat and Thwackey appreciate Carbink's ability to take hits from the multitude of powerful Fire-types in the tier. Thwackey is also one of the few Pokemon in PU with access to Knock Off, which is valuable for removing Heavy-Duty Boots from opponents and making Carbink's hazards much more difficult to manage. Furthermore, Grassy Terrain lessens the damage dealt by Earthquake and provides Carbink with passive recovery, which is especially beneficial should it choose to run Heavy-Duty Boots. In return, these Pokemon are strong answers to Water-types such as Whiscash and Golduck that can solidly threaten Carbink with super effective attacks. Carbink also appreciates strong Ground- and Fire-types, such as Dugtrio, Charizard, and Pyroar, that can handle threatening Steel-types such as Perrserker and Alolan Dugtrio for it. Due to Carbink being extremely slow and vulnerable to moves such as Taunt and Encore, fast teammates such as the aforementioned Dugtrio, as well as Alolan Persian and Raichu, are also appreciated to handle attempts to stifle Carbink alongside providing much-needed speed control.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Iron Defense Carbink is an incredibly terrifying defensive setup sweeper with incredible stats, making really hard to stop even for some of the most threatening physical attackers like Crabominable, and Lycanroc-N, especially after it starts boosting with Iron Defense. Body Press hits most of the tier for neutral or super effective damage, making its switch-ins very limited after a boost. Most of these switch-ins like Charizard and Masquerain also have to be wary of Power Gem. Carbink could choose to run Moonblast instead, hitting the likes of Drakloak and Spiritomb. Rock Polish is an option in the last slot to boost past Pokemon that could normally pick it off at low health like offensive Perrserker, Klawf, and Gabite. Carbink can also opt to run RestTalk alongside Iron Defense and Body Press to function better as a late-game sweeper once opposing Ghost-types and bulky Pokemon that resist its attacks are removed. Clear Body helps with many aspects, like avoiding defensive drops from moves like Misdreavus's Shadow Ball or Quaxwell's Liquidation, blocking Alolan Persian's Parting Shot, and ignoring Sticky Web's Speed drop. Tera Fighting is used to boost Body Press's power, helping Carbink pick up the 2HKO on Gogoat, Skuntank, and Whiscash. A defensive Tera like Ghost or Water also work well with helping Carbink get by various foes. Ghost drops all of its weaknesses, allowing it to tank hits with greater ease, but it makes enemies like Misdreavus, Banette, and Haunter more problematic. Water is a great option for stuffing the likes of Golduck, Basculin, and Lumineon, though Carbink then has to be wary of Rotom-F and Raichu in addition to being a generally good defensive typing that also allows it to shrug off hits from Steel-type moves that would usually obliterate it. Carbink can opt to run a more specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature to better take hits from Whiscash, Lumineon, and Raichu for an easier time setting up on them. However, you do miss out on initial Body Press power.</p> <p>Carbink works great on balance or bulky offensive teams looking for an endgame sweeper. It does great at supporting the likes of Misdreavus, Haunter, and Indeedee-F since it can wall Dark-types like Honchkrow, Alolan Persian, and Spiritomb. Carbink also isn't bothered by the likes of Houndoom, Pyroar, and Charizard which teammates like Gogoat, Rotom-F, and Rabsca really appreciate. It also fits the role of a Knock Off absorber, being able to take the hit when switching in and either immediately deal damage back or start setting up on Banette, Tinkatuff, and Klawf. While Carbink's defensive capabilities make it a great teammate, it also can break through bulky teams that rely on the likes of Hisuian Sliggoo and Chansey, which special attackers such as Haunter, Persian and Rotom-F enjoy having removed. Grass-types such as Gogoat, Dartrix, and Flapple really help Carbink find multiple opportunities to come back in to set up since they can help take hits from the likes of Whiscash, Basculin, and Sawsbuck. Carbink also really appreciates having a partner that can help with its 4x weakness to Steel, specifically against Perrserker and Alolan Dugtrio, like defensive Misdreavus, Lumineon, and RestTalk Gabite.</p> "

Klefki is a better option than Grimmsnarl due to its typing and ability to set up Spikes, which, like its screens, go up quickly with Prankster. This support allows for Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Azumarill from setting up and sweeping, teams. Foul Play prevents Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Mimikyu to set up and sweep while Thunder Wave cripples foes and allows Mega Diancie to outspeed threats such as +1 Mega Charizard X and Nihilego, which will normally beat Klefki one on one. Setting up Spikes creates solid chip damage on Alolan Muk and Gholdengo, allowing for late-game sweeping from its teammates Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Mega Diancie punishes opponents trying to set up entry hazards against Klefki and beats Fire-types such as Heatran and Mega Charizard Y. Tapu Bulu helps Klefki with Grassy Terrain, which halves the damage it takes from Earthquake, making Pokemon such as Iron Treads and Mamoswine not hit as hard.</p> "

This makes Icicle Crash the more consistent option for overall damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Support Partners</strong>: Even though Avalugg stops foes such as Dondozo from using Fissure, it lacks the power to cleanly beat these targets on its own. Common stall teammates such as Toxapex and Clodsire can bring Toxic or Toxic Spikes to spread status, allowing Avalugg to simply stall while poison wears down the opposition.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread: Full investment into HP and Defense give Avalugg insane physical bulk.

Mega Diancie can use Spikes or Stealth Rock to weaken checks such as Mega Scizor and Heatran, depending on its coverage move, while punishing them for attempting to pivot into it. A Naive nature is preferred, as it allows Mega Diancie to take less damage from common priority moves in Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Mega Lopunny's Fake Out. However, Mega Diancie can also use Hasty in order to sponge Hurricane from Tornadus-T. Mega Diancie fits best on bulky offense and offense teams, which appreciate its early- to mid-game wallbreaking and ability to set entry hazards. Pokemon that appreciate Mega Diancie weakening common Steel-types such as Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult pair well with it, using their higher Speed tiers to clean late-game. Additionally, Mega Diancie pairs well with Knock Off users like Tornadus-T and Kingambit, as they make Mega Diancie's entry hazards more effective and force checks such as Toxapex and Clodsire to succumb to them. Mega Diancie can struggle with entering the field given its relative frailty and poor defensive typing, which also gives it a tendency to be revenge killed by Pokemon like Mega Swampert and Zamazenta. As such, pivots that can bring it in safely such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T make for good partners.</p> "

Its high defensive stats make it very difficult to take out in a single attack and demands whittling it down with multiple neutral attacks instead of super effective attacks, out of fear of activating Weakness Policy. • Diamond Storm hits a lot of top threats, notably 2HKOing Chien-Pao, Dragonite, and Volcanion. Gaining Defense boosts from it also helps Diancie against physical attackers such as Rillaboom and Palafin. • Body Press synergizes very well with Defense boosts from Diamond Storm, giving Diancie useful coverage to hit foes it would normally have a tough matchup against such as Kingambit and Hisuian Goodra. • Trick Room allows Diancie to support itself and its teammates such as Iron Hands and Torkoal by turning their low Speed into an advantage. Diancie is an effective Trick Room setter as it is hard to remove and, unlike other Trick Room setters such as Cresselia, has the offensive capabilities to make the most of it. • Foes must always be wary of Weakness Policy, as activating it turns Diancie into a fearsome sweeper. As such, Diancie forces opponents to either OHKO it or whittle it down with multiple neutral attacks, as a weak super effective attack into the bulky Diancie will put it in a commanding position. This is especially effective once Diancie has accrued enough Defense boosts, as even Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Palafin's Wave Crash may not OHKO it anymore. Diancie can also use Mental Herb to guarantee it sets up Trick Room once against Taunt users such as Tornadus and Landorus-T. • Tera Grass allows Diancie to resist the Grass-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks that would otherwise OHKO it before a before a Defense boost such as Rillaboom's Wood Hammer, Palafin's Wave Crash, and Landorus's Earth Power. It also removes Diancie's 4x Steel-type weakness, which helps it matchup better against Steel-type foes like Heatran and Gholdengo and Pokemon with Steel-type coverage such as Iron Hands. Tera Grass also grants Diancie an immunity to powder moves, preventing Amoonguss's Spore from affecting it and circumventing Rage Powder. • Clear Body notably makes Diancie immune to Landorus-T's Intimidate and Grimmsnarl's Parting Shot, allowing Diancie to maintain a constant offensive presence on the field during its valuable Trick Room turns. • A Sassy Nature and maximum HP investment allow Diancie to survive a Steam Eruption from Volcanion. • Diancie enables Trick Room attackers like Kingambit, Torkoal, and Glastrier to sweep alongside it. Diancie wants Fake Out support to help set up Trick Room more easily. Rillaboom is a Fake Out user that can eliminate Palafin and provide Grassy Terrain recovery , while Iron Hands functions better under Trick Room specifically and deals with Volcanion and Kingambit better. Amoonguss also acts as a great partner for Diancie, with its Rage Powder and Spore protecting it from the Ground, Water, and Steel attacks that would threaten it. Pollen Puff also helps to increase its longevity.</p> "

Zen Headbutt is a nice complementary STAB move, allowing Hoopa-U to smack prominent Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant that may try to switch in on a predicted Hyperspace Fury. Drain Punch hits Dark-types like Kingambit and Ting-Lu, while Gunk Shot offers coverage against Fairy-types like Enamorus and Azumarill, as well as Tera Fairy Moltres, Garganacl, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur. A Jolly nature allows Hoopa-U to outspeed Pokemon like Timid Heatran, Modest Gholdengo, and Timid Volcanion, while an Adamant nature allows Hoopa-U to hit even harder, 2HKOing Garganacl the majority of the time. Tera Dark boosts the power of Hyperspace Fury even further, 2HKOing physically defensive Dondozo; Tera Dark also offers the additional benefit of making Hoopa-U resist other Dark-type attacks, which can be crucial against Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Hoopa-U fits well on bulky offense teams that are in need of a physical wallbreaker. Physical setup sweepers like Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Dragonite appreciate Hoopa-U's presence on a team, as Hoopa-U is able to break through or dent physically defensive Pokemon that could stand in their way, like Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Rotom-W. One of Hoopa-U's biggest challenges is safely getting on the field due to its frail physical defense and quadruple weakness to U-turn, so it pairs well with pivots such as Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking, U-turn Dragapult, and Volt Switch Zapdos. Hoopa-U is also held back by its middling Speed, which tends to exacerbate Hoopa-U's physical frailty, so it appreciates paralysis support from partners like Rotom-W and Substitute Dragapult. Static Zapdos is a particularly notable partner for Hoopa-U, because it is able to switch in and potentially paralyze faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Dragapult, rendering those Pokemon no longer threatening to Hoopa-U. Pokemon that can set entry hazards like Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Landorus-T help facilitate with Hoopa-U breaking through its switch-ins.

This is thanks to Hoopa-U's astronomically high Special Attack stat and potent dual STAB combination. Focus Blast rounds out its coverage, allowing Hoopa-U to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Hisuian Samurott; Focus Blast also OHKOes specially defensive Heatran after entry hazard chip. Trick can be run in the fourth slot to cripple the few special walls that Hoopa-U is unable to reliably blast through, like Blissey, Scream Tail, and Alolan Muk, while also affording Hoopa-U the ability to switch moves, alleviating the need for prediction in exchange for less immediate power. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be used instead as Hoopa-U's best option to hit Corviknight and Galarian Moltres while also providing a more reliable option than Focus Blast to OHKO Hisuian Samurott and Greninja. A Timid nature makes Hoopa-U faster than Pokemon like Timid Heatran, Modest Gholdengo, and Timid Volcanion, while a Modest nature gives Hoopa-U even more breaking power so that it is able to potentially 2HKO Blissey and Alolan Muk with Focus Blast after entry hazard damage. Tera Dark increases the power of Dark Pulse, giving it an opportunity to 2HKO Scream Tail and specially defensive Heatran while also threatening to OHKO Baxcalibur, bulky Cinderace, and defensive Landorus-T. Tera Dark also makes Hoopa-U resist Dark-type attacks, which can prevent Kingambit from answering it with Sucker Punch. Quick special attackers like Choice Specs Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus make good teammates, as they appreciate Hoopa-U's ability to break through even the bulkiest of specially defensive walls. One of Hoopa-U's biggest flaws is that its physical frailty and crippling 4x weakness to U-turn can make it difficult for it to safely be brought onto the field. As a result, Hoopa-U greatly benefits from being paired alongside pivots that can facilitate its entry, like Galarian Slowking with Chilly Reception; Landorus-T, Dragapult, and Sneasler with U-turn; and Rotom-W and Zapdos with Volt Switch. Paralysis support from Thunder Wave users like Rotom-W, Substitute Dragapult, and defensive Gholdengo can help alleviate Hoopa-U's lackluster Speed and make previously faster threats easy targets. Static Zapdos synergizes particularly well with Hoopa-U in this regard, since Zapdos can punish U-turns directed at Hoopa-U from faster Pokemon like Cinderace, Sneasler, and Meowscarada to potentially paralyze them. Hoopa-U also appreciates the inclusion of hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Heatran, allowing it to punch holes in defensive backbones more easily and damage the opposing team thanks to the switches it forces. Some of the most difficult Pokemon for Hoopa-U to handle are opposing Dark-types like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Ting-Lu, and Hisuian Samurott because they can force Hoopa-U to rely on Focus Blast and good prediction to break through. To help mitigate this issue, Pokemon that can reliably switch into Dark-types like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Azumarill also make good partners for Hoopa-U, and in return they appreciate Choice Specs Hoopa-U's ability to threaten physical walls as well. Bulk Up Great Tusk and Belly Drum Azumarill can also clean up late-game after Hoopa-U wears down the opposing team.</p> "

It is incredibly physically frail, so pairing it with physically bulky Pokemon like Garganacl and Great Tusk is a good idea, as it will often be forced out by physical attackers. Additionally, pivot support from Cinderace and Zapdos can put Hoopa-U in favorable positions to dish out damage with its strong attacks, something that is necessary given its aforementioned physical frailty. Because Hoopa-U often makes great progress with Knock Off, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T are great teammate options. Hoopa-U excels at punching holes in the opposition, so faster offensive teammates like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus are good ideas to take advantage of the resultant weakened foes. Teammates like Amoonguss and Galarian Slowking also deserve consideration for checking Iron Valiant and Enamorus without having to expend Terastallization.</p> "

Its strong offensive STAB combination coupled with great coverage allows it to muscle through bulky Pokemon such as Skeledirge, Toxapex, Iron Hands, and Amoonguss, and with its great special bulk, it can prove useful against Ghost teams. Drain Punch grants Hoopa-U super effective coverage against Dark- and Steel-types such as Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Brick Break can also be run as Hoopa-U's Fighting-type move, as this allows it to remove dual screens set by Fairy- and Dark-type teams. Trick is a great option for Hoopa-U to hinder Pokemon that can take a hit like Sableye and Klefki, as well as potentially disrupt Pokemon reliant on their items such as Moltres. Gunk Shot is another great option, as it allows Hoopa-U to threaten Fairy-types like Azumarill and to OHKO Hatterene. By investing 8 EVs in Special Defense, Hoopa-U can live a Moonblast from Choice Scarf Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Azelf and Scream Tail make for great partners, as they can set up entry hazards for Hoopa-U to be able to wallbreak more easily. Azelf can also run Taunt to prevent Defog users like Corviknight removing its hazards, while Scream Tail can also set up dual screens for both Hoopa-U and its teammates and provide Wish support. Because of Hoopa-U's lack of longevity outside of Wish, it can get easily worn down by hazards. Hence, Hatterene is a great partner, as it is able to provide great hazard control for Psychic teams through Magic Bounce. Galarian Slowking is another great partner for Hoopa-U, as it provides Hoopa-U a switch-in to Fairy-types and aids Hoopa-U's wallbreaking through Future Sight. Galarian Slowking can also set up Toxic Spikes to annoy Hoopa-U's switch-ins such as Azumarill, and its Poison typing allows it to remove Toxic Spikes to prevent Hoopa-U from getting worn down by poison. Indeedee is another great addition to Psychic teams, as its Normal typing grants it an immunity to Ghost. Aside from this, Indeedee can set up Psychic Terrain to allow Hoopa-U to threaten Kingambit with Drain Punch without fearing Sucker Punch. Lastly, late-game sweepers such as Gallade and Armarouge appreciate Hoopa-U beating their checks such as Azumarill for the former and Galarian Slowking for the latter. Lastly, Espathra appreciates Hoopa-U breaking through its checks such as Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Sableye so it can set up and sweep late-game.</p> "

That said, Hoopa-U competes with Kingambit, which has significantly higher bulk and a way to bypass its Speed tier issue in Sucker Punch. Hoopa-U has a 4x weakness to U-turn and neutrality to Pursuit, meaning it cannot enter or leave the field easily. Nonetheless, Hoopa-U does not require setup, and it therefore has a niche into bulkier teams thanks to its immediate power. Drain Punch lets Hoopa-U take on Dark-types that would otherwise wall it, such as Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar, and Zen Headbutt hammers Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Buzzwole, and Toxapex while also hitting Clefable and Tera Fairy Garganacl neutrally. Gunk Shot provides Hoopa-U with another way to break through Fairy-types such as Tera Fairy Garganacl and Clefable. Tera Dark powers up Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury while giving it a resistance to Pursuit. Hoopa-U fits well on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its power allowing teammates to clean. As such, partners such as Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele pair well with Hoopa-U. The former three also check Kingambit, making Hoopa-U less prediction reliant with its attacks, while the latter appreciates Hoopa-U being able to wear down Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Kingambit. Hoopa-U also has trouble getting into the field due to its low Speed and frail physical bulk, so pivots such as Mega Scizor and Rotom-W are appreciated to bring it in Hoopa-U more consistently. Rotom-W also pivots into Toxapex and Heatran to bring in Hoopa-U, while Mega Scizor pivots into Tapu Lele and Kingambit and brings in Heatran and Skeledirge for Hoopa-U to break through. Entry hazard setters are also appreciated, as Hoopa-U can more easily break through defensive teams with Spikes or Stealth Rock on the field. Thus, partners such as Ferrothorn and Garchomp are appreciated.</p> "

Good coverage options as well as a powerful STAB move that can burn its foes make it very difficult to switch into. Earth Power is crucial for hitting Toxapex, which easily switches into both of Volcanion's STAB moves; it also hits Galarian Slowking harder, notably guaranteeing a 2HKO on physically defensive variants. Taunt is useful against bulkier Pokemon, preventing Dondozo or Toxapex from using healing moves and Galarian Slowking from using Thunder Wave. Substitute eases prediction, as Volcanion can force switches, and it takes advantage of certain Pokemon that fail to break the Substitute such as bulky Cinderace and non-Assault Vest Toxapex while still avoiding status attempts from the aforementioned walls. It also allows Volcanion to avoid Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Tera Blast alongside Tera Fairy can be used to hit Pokemon such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Hisuian Samurott. Becoming a Fairy-type offers useful defensive utility, giving it an immunity to both of Walking Wake's STAB moves and a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Tera Ground can be used to grant Volcanion an Electric immunity, improving its matching against Zapdows and Rotom-W, while also boosting Earth Power's damage. Both Tera types also neutralize its weakness to Earthquake from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. 140 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Great Tusk. Volcanion fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate a strong wallbreaker. Entry hazards, especially Spikes, make Volcanion much harder to deal with. Therefore, hazard setters including Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T make good partners. Ting-Lu can also switch into special attackers like Dragapult and Zapdos for Volcanion. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking cause problems for Volcanion, so teammates that can help overwhelm them such as Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Utility Dragapult are also useful. Finally, Swords Dance Iron Valiant and Kingambit can clean late-game once Volcanion has worn down the opposing team, and they also pressure the aforementioned specially defensive Pokemon. Kingambit in particular appreciates Volcanion's ability to deal with Fire-types like Cinderace and Moltres, and especially its immunity to Will-O-Wisp.</p> "

Steam Eruption is Volcanion's most spammable move and has very limited switch-ins, as many Pokemon that resist both of Volcanion's STAB moves like Dragapult, Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott end up getting 2HKOed or burned. Fire Blast is Volcanion's best move for Grass-types such as Meowscarada, Amoonguss, and Tera Grass Galarian Slowking. Earth Power helps immensely with Toxapex, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking. Sludge Bomb hits Azumarill and Tera Grass Heatran while crippling foes like Rotom-W more than burn, while Tera Blast Fairy can hit many Dragon types such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon as well as Pokemon like Assault Vest Hisuian Samurott. Tera Fairy also makes Volcanion immune to Dragon-type moves, negating both of Walking Wake's STAB types, and removes all of Volcanion's weaknesses, particularly to Ground-type attacks such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu and Landorus-T's Earthquake. Tera Fairy also allows Volcanion to resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch, making it a great revenge killing option. Tera Water and Tera Fire make Steam Eruption and Fire Blast even stronger, allowing Volcanion to muscle through Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and even 2HKO physically defensive Toxapex. Its main counters are Tera Water Galarian Slowking and Water Absorb or Tera Water Clodsire, alongside Blissey. Volcanion appreciates support from wallbreakers that can deal with these threats or wear them down, such as Black Glasses Kingambit and mixed Iron Valiant. Kingambit in particular loves Choice Specs Volcanion's matchup against Fire-types like Cinderace, Moltres, and Heatran. In turn, Kingambit has a good matchup versus the aforementioned counters and can help pressure other checks such as Toxapex. Dragapult can also be a great partner, as it provides pivoting and speed control along with adding pressure on said counters and checks and has the option to provide great support with Thunder Wave. Great Tusk is another great option, as it can provide hazard removal, which is crucial for Volcanion. It is also a great blanket check for physical attackers that threaten Volcanion, and it provides Knock Off support, making it one of the best defensive partners for Volcanion. Volcanion also fits great on VoltTurn teams, as it loves being brought in as many times as possible by Pokemon such as Cinderace, Dragapult, and Rotom-W.</p> "

Steam Eruption is Volcanion's preferred Water-type move, with it being able to burn its switch-ins like Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Iron Hands, reducing their overall longevity. Earth Power allows Volcanion to threaten opposing Volcanion, Toxapex, and Heatran. Sludge Bomb allows Volcanion to revenge kill Azumarill after a Belly Drum and threaten other Fairy-type Pokemon like Hatterene and Enamorus. It is also able to target Walking Wake and Rotom-W, which resist Volcanion's STAB attacks, potentially crippling them thanks to the 30% poison chance. Flamethrower is preferred over Fire Blast since it doesn't miss, and the reduced damage is not too significant if Volcanion is under sun, but Fire Blast can be used in order to 2HKO Hisuian Goodra under sun. 96 Speed EVs let Volcanion outspeed Adamant Azumarill in order to revenge kill it with Sludge Bomb, and the rest of the EVs are put in HP to improve Volcanion's overall bulk.</p> <p>Torkoal is a solid partner for Volcanion that assists it with Stealth Rock support, chipping down its switch-ins like Rotom-W and Alolan Muk and working well in conjunction with Steam Eruption's burn chance. Torkoal can also use Rapid Spin to clear away entry hazards for Volcanion if its Heavy-Duty Boots get removed by Alolan Muk or Meowscarada. Furthermore, Torkoal provides Volcanion with sun thanks to Drought, which boosts Volcanion's Fire-type attacks. In return, Volcanion can switch into Water attacks from Barraskewda and Pelipper, which threaten Torkoal. Scovillain helps out Volcanion by threatening Water-immune Pokemon like Clodsire and Gastrodon, and its damage onto the former allows Volcanion to revenge kill it and proceed to threaten slower Ground-types like Quagsire and Ting-Lu. Cinderace is able to threaten Hisuian Goodra with Libero High Jump Kick, whose Assault Vest set easily shrugs off Earth Power from Volcanion and chips it down with Draco Meteor. Cinderace can also steal dual screens from Klefki with Court Change in the Fairy matchup, which supplement Volcanion's naturally good bulk, letting it take hits better. In return, Volcanion offers an answer to Belly Drum Azumarill and threatens Cinderace's defensive answers like Toxapex and Skeledirge. Choice Scarf Hisuian Arcanine offers a solution to handle opposing Dragon-types like Baxcalibur, which can use Volcanion as setup fodder, and also threatens Dragapult and non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Rotom-Heat provides an invaluable Ground immunity for Volcanion to avoid Earthquake from Pokemon like Iron Hands, Iron Treads, and Landorus-T and threatens all 3 of them with a burn from Will-O-Wisp. Rotom-H is also able to threaten defensive Water-types like Toxapex and offensive Water-types like Hisuian Samurott and Quaquaval if it opts for a Choice Scarf. Heatran can help Volcanion deal with Poison teams with its stallbreaker set, which allows it to trap and beat Pokemon like Toxapex one-on-one.

Earthquake hits Skuntank without triggering Aftermath and, after some chip damage, 2HKOes specially defensive Carbink, physically defensive Tinkatuff, and Mareanie. Close Combat is a secondary Fighting STAB option that's stronger than Drain Punch, but Thunder Punch is more reliable against Flying-types than Ice Hammer due to its higher accuracy. 60 Speed EVs allow Crabominable to outrun uninvested base 50s like Perrserker, Chansey, and Carbink. Tera Water helps against Fire-, Water-, and Steel-types like Pyroar, Basculin, and Alolan Dugtrio, all of which can otherwise overwhelm Crabominable. Tera Electric lets Crabominable take Electric-, Flying-, and Steel-type attacks from Pokemon like Rotom-F, Honchkrow, and Tera Steel Alolan Persian and is best used with Thunder Punch. Tera Ground gives Crabominable an Electric immunity, notably letting it block Volt Switch, and secures the OHKO on Skuntank with Earthquake. On teams with entry hazard control, Tera Fire can be considered to let Crabominable absorb Will-O-Wisp and thus more easily handle Misdreavus as well as Fire-types like Pyroar.</p> <p>Crabominable's main flaw is that its poor longevity can limit its ability to repeatedly handle special attackers; this is made worse with Crabominable being vulnerable to all hazards and tending to attack last. Entry hazard removers like Dartrix and Komala can give Crabominable an easier time switching in, with the latter not removing any hazards set by Crabominable's team. Wish support from the likes of Dachsbun and Leafeon is another way to keep Crabominable healthy, with the former also absorbing Fire-type moves from Pokemon like Misdreavus and Charizard. In return, Crabominable pressures Ice- and Steel-types like Rotom-F and Perrserker. Healing Wish Indeedee-F can similarly give Crabominable another chance to sponge hits or break if it gets worn down too quickly. Physical walls like Alolan Persian and Misdreavus can form a good defensive core with Crabominable and facilitate wallbreaking through moves like Parting Shot, Thunder Wave, and Will-O-Wisp. Fast Pokemon like Electrode, Dugtrio, and Choice Scarf Indeedee-F are good at compensating for Crabominable's bad matchup against offense and benefit from its ability to both tear through balance cores and trade with revenge killers like Choice Scarf Rotom-F. Fire- and Dark-types like Charizard and Skuntank can more reliably pressure Misdreavus for Crabominable and appreciate it wearing down bulky foes like Whiscash, Carbink, and Hisuian Sliggoo.</p> "

Rock Blast is a great way of getting around Substitute from the likes of Articuno and Rotom-F while preventing Focus Sash Masquerain from setting up Sticky Web. Play Rough hits Gabite, which makes for an otherwise great Lycanroc-N check, while Iron Head nails Carbink. With a Choice Scarf, Lycanroc-N outspeeds threats like Alolan Persian and Pyroar. Tera Rock and Tera Fighting both boost Lycanroc-N's most spammable moves. Tera Fighting also allows Lycanroc-N to resist Sucker Punch from the likes of Honchkrow and Skuntank.</p> <p>Lycanroc-N is checked by Pokemon that resist Rock like Gabite, Tinkatuff, and Whiscash, so Pokemon that can weaken these checks like Zangoose and Basculin make for great offensive partners. As a Choice Scarf cleaner, Lycanroc-N appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Whiscash and Carbink to more easily put foes in range of its moves. When locked into an undesirable move, Lycanroc-N appreciates defensive teammates to fall back on like Articuno and Perrserker, which can also provide momentum with U-turn for Lycanroc-N to safely hit the field.</p> "

An excellent ability combined with a STAB priority move in Accelerock allows Lycanroc-D to revenge kill foes that greatly threaten Rock teams like Chien-Pao, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Shell Smash Cloyster. With Choice Band, Stone Edge  2HKOes Corviknight. Close Combat deals with Normal-, Rock-, Dark- and Steel-types like Ursaluna, Tyranitar, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Hisuian Goodra. Psychic Fangs not only breaks screens in the Fairy matchup, but it also deals with Fighting- and Poison-types like Urshifu-R, Great Tusk, Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Play Rough is another option to deal with Dragon- and Dark- types like Walking Wake, Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Sableye.</p> <p>Garganacl pairs well with Lycanroc-D, as Salt Cure wears down defensive Pokemon Lycanroc-D struggles with such as Quagsire and Corviknight. In return, Garganacl benefits from Lycanroc-D's ability to remove wallbreakers such as Walking Wake and Urshifu-R which threaten Garganacl's Iron Defense + Body Press set. Tyranitar is an essential teammate as it sets up sand to further chip down walls and checks threats like Flutter Mane, Espathra, and Kingambit due to its sheer bulk and great coverage in Heavy Slam, Crunch, and Low Kick. Hisuian Arcanine's wallbreaking power covers walls that are harder for Lycanroc-D to take down, dealing with Toxapex and Corviknight with Head Smash and Flare Blitz, respectively. Kleavor is a great lead, as Stone Axe sets up Stealth Rock to break through any opposing Focus Sash, allowing Lycanroc-D and Hisuian Arcanine to clean teams more easily. It can also pivot into Lycanroc-D with U-turn, luring in foes like Toxapex, Iron Treads, and Heatran in the process.  Choice item Glimmora's colorful moveset helps against walls like Quagsire and Toxapex through the use of Energy Ball and Earth Power, with Choice Scarf allowing Glimmora to outspeed and take down fast offensive threats such as Iron Valiant and Greninja if they aren't running Choice Scarf. Coalossal removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin, checks Scizor, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit with Flamethrower and Body Press, and can burn threats with Flame Body. Iron Defense + Calm Mind Diancie can check Garchomp with Moonblast. Shell Smash Air Balloon Drednaw provides a temporary Ground-type immunity and appreciates defensive walls being worn down by Lycanroc-D. In return, it readily cleans weakened Flying and Ground teams, eliminating threats like Landorus-T and Great Tusk.</p> "

It can switch into and counter Pokemon like Cinderace and Greninja, scout for Choice item users like Dragapult, Breloom, and Iron Valiant, and absorb Toxic Spikes from Glimmora and opposing Toxapex. Surf forces damage onto Toxic-immune foes such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, Iron Moth, and Kingambit. Toxic shuts down Pokemon such as Dragonite, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W, and if Toxapex should run Toxic Spikes, it matches up well against offensive teams that contain setup sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk. Any attempts of boosting past Toxapex gets shut down easily by Haze, which combined with poison damage prevents Toxapex from being used as setup fodder by Pokemon such as Calm Mind Hatterene. Covert Cloak is an option to ignore Garganacl's Salt Cure, Dragapult and Gholdengo's Shadow Ball drops, and Greninja's Dark Pulse flinches, but Leftovers's longevity reduces Toxapex's reliance on Recover, and it is used over Black Sludge in case Toxapex decides to Terastallize. Tera Steel improves Toxapex's matchup against non-Earthquake Roaring Moon and Meowscarada while still maintaining an immunity to poison. Alternatively, Tera Fairy fares better against Dragapult, Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. The given EVs allow Toxapex to survive two Choice Band Meowscarada's Flower Trick from full health.</p> <p>Toxapex fits nicely on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate a sturdy defensive backbone. Teammates like Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl are terrific defensive partners that covers Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Tera Electric Iron Valiant, respectively. Corviknight and Great Tusk in particular provide a backup check to multiple combinations of physical attackers like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Kingambit that attempt to overwhelm Toxapex. They also remove entry hazards, which would mitigate Toxapex's Regenerator and force it to use Recover more often; in return, Toxapex covers Pokemon such as Cinderace for the former and Greninja for the latter. Bulky setup sweepers like Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo can take advantage of Toxic Spikes slowly chipping down checks such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Particularly, Skeledirge and Gholdengo can make use of Hex easily to take advantage of Toxapex spreading poison, as well as threaten Hatterene, which can block Toxapex's Toxic Spikes and use non-Haze variants as setup fodder. Offensive partners like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit compensate for Toxapex's overall passivity; in return, they appreciate Toxapex switching into their revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Scizor, and Iron Valiant, respectively.</p> "

Surf does a solid chunk of damage to common Toxapex switch-ins like Kingambit, physically defensive Corviknight, and Gholdengo and often 2HKOes Garganacl after Stealth Rock. Sludge Bomb has good coverage alongside it, dealing heavy damage to Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Azumarill while breaking Hydreigon's Substitute. Sludge Bomb's high chance to poison can be critical for crippling Rotom-W and Slowking in the long term. Infestation provides a nice source of chip damage while letting Toxapex trap and beat defensive threats, such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Clodsire, in conjunction with Acid Spray. Furthermore, Infestation prevents the opponent from double switching on Toxapex, enabling much safer plays. Instead of Acid Spray, Ice Beam works to offer more immediate damage against Clodsire, Dragonite, Dragapult, and Amoonguss. Tera Blast, with Tera Fighting, is also viable to nab surprise KOs on Kingambit and Roaring Moon, which might otherwise set up on it. However, Fairy is the most standard Tera type for Toxapex, allowing it to block Dragon-type attacks from Dragapult and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Toxapex fits best on balance and bulky teams that appreciate its unique combination of bulk and power. Assault Vest Toxapex likes to pivot around aggressively and spread chip damage, thanks in part to Regenerator: entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu can help it pressure opposing teams more, punishing opponents for switching out against it. Without either Haze or Toxic, Toxapex is vulnerable to setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon, so Unaware Pokemon such as Dondozo and Skeledirge are excellent teammates. Since Assault Vest Toxapex's physical bulk is rather lacking, physically defensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Corviknight can offer much-needed switch-ins to the likes of Kingambit and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Toxapex can often struggle to make progress against bulkier teams due to its middling power and lack of Toxic, so it appreciates strong balance wallbreakers like Iron Valiant. Hydreigon deserves special mention as an excellent teammate, sharing near-perfect type synergy with Toxapex. Hydreigon checks key threats to Toxapex such as Armarouge, Kingambit, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and it can set up on bulkier Pokemon like defensive Great Tusk and Clodsire. In return, Toxapex can check Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Greninja, which can threaten Hydreigon. Finally, Scream Tail is also a great partner, using Wish to extend Toxapex's longevity and having solid defensive synergy with it.</p> "

Toxic punishes strong attackers that can threaten Toxapex such as Miraidon, Iron Bundle, and Great Tusk, and it can hinder walls for Toxapex's teammates. Toxic Spikes can instead be used in conjunction with Pokemon that prevent hazard removal, such as Gholdengo and Annihilape, to pester the opposing team long-term. Infestation can trap and deal chip damage, notably to Pokemon like Corviknight, Iron Treads, and opposing Toxapex, which are immune to Toxic. Alternatively, Baneful Bunker lets Toxapex scout foes like Miraidon, Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and Choice Specs Iron Bundle while possibly poisoning them, at the risk of letting them set up on it. Rocky Helmet somewhat offsets Toxapex's passive nature by dealing chip damage and wearing down Pokemon like Koraidon and Chien-Pao, potentially putting them into KO range from a partner and dissuading them from freely using U-turn and Crunch, respectively.

Haze removes the buffs from sweepers, including Ceruledge, Mimikyu, and Kingambit. Toxapex has three notable options for its second support move: Toxic Spikes to complete Poison's entry hazard stacking core and puts teams on a timer; Baneful Bunker to allow Toxapex to scout opponents, poison contact attackers such as Chien-Pao, and heal with Black Sludge; and Infestation to trap opponents that don't threaten Toxapex such as Alolan Muk and Klefki.

Corrosion Salazzle can also provide Corrosion Toxic support along with using Encore to mess up Pokemon that view Toxapex as a setup opportunity like Kingambit.

Chilling Water with a Bold or Impish nature gives Toxapex another tool against physical sweepers, but makes it much more vulnerable to Substitute in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Baneful Bunker: If using Black Sludge or Leftovers, Baneful Bunker is a fantastic way to spread poison against physical attackers and get some extra recovery with one moveslot, but keep in mind that this won't work against Urshifu-R. It's also key for scouting dangerous uses of Trick from the likes of Gholdengo and Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Physically Defensive versus Specially Defensive: Physically defensive Toxapex does well against some hard-to-check threats, such as Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao. Specially defensive Toxapex, on the other hand, has a better shot of beating Heatran and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Infestation</strong>: Infestation is Toxapex's best chance of doing chip damage to Toxic-immune threats, such as Corviknignt and Gholdengo, and the trapping works fairly well against foes that do have problems with Toxic. It also prevents double switching from being an issue for Toxapex.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low: While Terastallization can help Toxapex beat a new set of threats, its bulk and good defensive typing usually makes it a rare occurrence compared to its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Besides making Toxapex far less vulnerable to Electric, which some foes like Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur may Terastallize into, Tera Poison retains the ability to restore health with Black Sludge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: Tera Fairy removes all of Toxapex's weaknesses and can save it from taking massive damage from Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse. It also does well against powerful Dragon-type attacks such as Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage and Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass: Tera Grass can prevent Breloom and Amoonguss from being disastrous with Spore, in addition to doing well against Rotom-W. It also gives an important Ground-type resistance against targets such as Ting-Lu and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal: While Normal isn't an impressive defensive type, Tera Normal can punish Choice locked Ghost-types, such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: While the Stealth Rock weakness can be an issue, Tera Bug is a niche way to resist Ground-type attacks while being neutral to both Ice- and Electric-type moves, unlike other methods.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying not only protects Toxapex from its irritating Ground-type weakness but also means bulky users of Fissure, such as Dondozo and Ting-Lu, will no longer pressure Toxapex. However, this typing makes Toxapex much worse into general offense.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Black Sludge versus Leftovers: Having passive healing is wonderful, especially with Baneful Bunker. Black Sludge is a clever way to get around Item Clause, but Leftovers gives Toxapex more freedom in choosing its Tera type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: While Urshifu-R often has contact protection, other physical attackers such as Chien-Pao can be gradually worn down through Rocky Helmet chip.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: With Mental Herb providing one-time protection from Taunt, Toxapex can surprise foes like Annihilape and Ting-Lu with Toxic, which is especially helpful if not running an attack.</p> </li> </ul> "

Toxic targets foes that commonly run Heavy-Duty Boots or are Ground immune like Cinderace and Galarian Zapdos, while Toxic Spikes provides excellent team support; Corrosion variants should always run Toxic to punish common switch-ins like Corviknight and Hisuian Goodra that otherwise might use Toxapex as free recovery. Prankster + Haze, on the other hand, is an excellent tool to frustrate hyper offense teams and stop dangerous setup sweepers like Chien-Pao, Polteageist, and Chesnaught. While the consistent recovery of Black Sludge is generally preferred, Rocky Helmet allows Toxapex to annoy non-Magic Guard Galarian Zapdos and Chien-Pao even when it is forced to use Recover. Toxapex is utterly unable to threaten most Magic Guard users, like Galarian Zapdos and especially Water-resistant ones like Hisuian Electrode and Quaquaval, so reliable checks to them like Hisuian Goodra and Fluffy Corviknight are recommended. Toxic Spikes variants appreciate spinners like Iron Treads, as they can provide entry hazard removal without removing Toxic Spikes as well. Toxapex can easily be overwhelmed by multiple attackers, so it should always have a secondary physically defensive teammate, especially one that handles Ground-types, like Intimidate Corviknight; this also relieves some of the pressure off of Toxapex of checking pivots without Regenerator.</p> "

This allows it to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Dragapult and Zamazenta and pivot around powerful attackers such as Iron Valiant. Scald and Knock Off allow Toxapex to meaningfully threaten foes and make progress by either causing crippling status or removing the foe's item respectively, while Toxic takes advantage of Toxapex's excellent bulk and Regenerator, putting foes on a timer for its teammates. Haze removes boosts from the likes of Dragon Dance Dragapult and Espathra. Other options such as Toxic Spikes and Baneful Bunker can be explored over either Toxic or Haze, with the intent to cripple offensive teams or maximize Toxapex's ability to scout and pivot, respectively. However, removing Toxic leaves Toxapex worse off against common Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Rotom-W, while removing Haze makes it harder to handle setup sweepers. Although Toxapex rarely Terastallizes, Tera Dragon ensures Rotom-W's Volt Switch never outdamages Regenerator while also removing its Ground and Electric weaknesses against the likes of Great Tusk and Tapu Koko. The EV spread maximizes Toxapex's physical Bulk while allowing it to survive two Scorching Sands from Mega Charizard Y. Toxapex fits best on defensively oriented teams, which don't mind its passivity and can make up for any of its defensive shortcomings. Toxapex pairs well with Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Clodsire, which can handle setup sweepers that Toxapex falters to such as Kingambit and Gholdengo. In return, Toxapex sponges various weaker attacks using Regenerator from the likes of Gastrodon and Rotom-W. Toxapex dislikes losing its item, as it can easily be pushed into KO range against wallbreakers such as Zamazenta and Dragapult alongside entry hazards. As such, Pokemon that can generally withstand Knock Off well, such as Flyinium Z Tornadus-T and Gliscor, pair excellently with it. Tornadus-T in particular makes for a great partner, as it can use Regenerator alongside Toxapex, pivoting between each other to handle Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Garganacl. Toxapex appreciates extra insurance against strong special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. As such, Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Heatran pair well, especially since Toxapex can switch into the Shadow Balls and Focus Blasts aimed that them respectively.</p> "

Mega Swampert switches into Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Magnezone and threatens Poison-types like opposing Toxapex, Clodsire, and Nidoking.

Toxic puts threats like Rotom-W, Baxcalibur, and Urshifu-R on a timer and spreads chip damage on offensive teams like Dragon, Psychic, and Fire. Knock Off is another great option to bother Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Celesteela. Haze, paired with Icium Z, shuts down setup sweepers like Z-Happy Hour Jirachi and Clangorous Soulblaze Kommo-o, immediately regaining its health to continue walling them. Toxic Spikes are an option instead of Toxic or Knock Off; however, Toxapex has other teammates capable of setting them up and it increases Toxapex's passivity. The given EV spread avoids an OHKO from +1 SpA Jirachi's Psychic, allowing Toxapex to activate its Z-Crystal. Mega Venusaur and Crobat are excellent teammates due to their Ground-type neutrality and immunity, respectively, checking Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Mamoswine, while the former also threatens Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire. Due to Toxapex's Psychic-type weakness, Alolan Muk and Galarian Slowking are notable teammates, checking Tapu Lele, Deoxys-S, and Latias; Galarian Slowking, in particular, forms a very strong Regenerator core with Toxapex. Clodsire and Nidoking patch up Toxapex's Electric-type weakness, and Nidoking specifically threatens Steel teams with its wide array of coverage. Galarian Weezing provides another Ground-type immunity and removes entry hazards with Defog as well as serving as a concrete answer to Baxcalibur. Sneasler appreciates Toxapex's ability to chip down foes, offering more opportunities for setup.

Play Rough is Mimikyu's strongest STAB move and allows Mimikyu to secure a OHKO on Iron Hands after a Swords Dance and also deals with bulky Great Tusk. Shadow Sneak lets Mimikyu revenge kill weakened offensive threats like Iron Moth and faster Ghost-type Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult. Shadow Claw lets Mimikyu break past bulkier Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Skeledirge more readily compared to Shadow Sneak, while Drain Punch is an alternative that threatens opposing Steel-types such as Magnezone and Kingambit.

Mimikyu appreciates Spikes from Klefki, which allows Mimikyu to take down Pokemon easier after a Swords Dance boost. In return, Mimikyu can block Rapid Spin, allowing Klefki's hazards to stay up during the course of the game. Flutter Mane is often paired with Mimikyu since it can threaten physically defensive pokemon that give Mimikyu a hard time like Amoonguss, Quagsire, and Forretress and also faster offensive threats like Iron Moth and Kilowattrel. Mimikyu is able to break through specially defensive Pokemon like Dragalge which gives Flutter Mane an easier time. Hatterene is also a good partner for Mimikyu, as it can bounce back debilitating status conditions like Will-O-Wisp from Sableye and Thunder Wave from Klefki and also bounces back hazards, which helps with Mimikyu's longevity since it runs Life Orb. Furthermore, Mimikyu with its Disguise up can check opposing Ghost-type Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Iron Valiant is also one of Mimikyu's best offensive teammates, as special sets are able to threaten other physically defensive Pokemon like Dondozo. Additionally, Iron Valiant is useful for Mimikyu in the Ground matchup, where a Choice Specs set can check answers to Mimikyu, such as Quagsire and Clodsire, using Psyshock. Azumarill can use Belly Drum against Steel teams and weaken foes like Orthworm and revenge kill Iron Treads with Aqua Jet.</p> "

Shadow Sneak picks off faster threats that could otherwise revenge kill Mimikyu, such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane. Drain Punch helps against Steel-types like Kingambit and offers some recovery—Disguise's recoil, entry hazards, and Life Orb damage can wear Mimikyu down pretty easily.

Froslass and Brambleghast can place Spikes to help Mimikyu clean up and use Taunt or Rapid Spin, respectively, so opposing entry hazards don't wear it down.

Nasty Plot Gholdengo deals with bulkier teams like Ground and Poison teams, as well as absorbing Toxic from bulky walls such as Toxapex.

          "description": "<p>Kommo-o is a fearsome wallbreaker with its capability to omniboost as soon as it gets an opportunity with Clangorous Soul. Its ability to set up on common Pokemon like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Volcarona and to potentially use Tera Steel to ignore Toxic from defensive Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex allows it to start wallbreaking very early with its powerful coverage. Throat Spray grants an extra Special Attack boost when using Clangorous Soul, whereas Kommonium Z gives it Clangorous Soulblaze, which allows it to deal heavy damage while boosting its stats. Boomburst lets Kommo-o neutrally hit much of the metagame for large damage, which, when coupled with STAB Clanging Scales and Flamethrower as coverage for Steel-types, can easily break cores featuring the likes of Great Tusk, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and more. Bulletproof along with Tera Steel allows Kommo-o to wall Choice Scarf Tapu Lele looking to revenge kill it as well as set up in front of Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult. Tera Normal gives Kommo-o a stronger Boomburst, while Tera Steel gives it a Toxic immunity and useful resistances to all of its weaknesses, allowing Kommo-o to take would-be checks, such as Dragapult, Tapu Lele, Baxcalibur, and Iron Valiant, by surprise and set up in front of them. However, Kommo-o likes to use its Tera and thus denies its teammates this option, and it can be checked by a well-timed Tera from Pokemon such as Tera Steel Garchomp and subsequently be revenge killed. It is also walled by the likes of Heatran, Garganacl, and Clodsire, which can tank its coverage options even without Terastallizing and cripple it with Toxic or Salt Cure or simply force it out and deny future setup opportunities. Finally, due to the nature of Kommo-o’s setup, it can only reasonably do so once per game, making Kommo-o more suited for offensive teams. Thus, having allies that can take care of Kommo-o’s defensive checks before it sets up can allow it to do its job much more effectively; physical attackers like Iron Valiant, offensive Landorus-T, and Samurott-H can pressure and remove checks for Kommo-o to break and potentially sweep. Hazard support is also valuable in preventing opponents from switching back and forth between Pokemon in a Regenerator core; in particular, Assault Vest Tornadus + Toxapex; Pokemon like Great Tusk and Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock to pressure switches.</p> "

The HP cuts from Substitute and Belly Drum will immediately activate Salac Berry, giving Kommo-o maximum Attack along with increased Speed to sweep offensive and defensive teams alike. Substitute also allows Kommo-o to dodge status moves like Ferrothorn’s Leech Seed, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Landorus-T's Toxic, and Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp that could potentially ruin Kommo-o’s sweep, instead giving it a free set up opportunity. Drain Punch is chosen over heavier hitting moves like Close Combat, as the extra damage is not needed, and Drain Punch can heal off the HP lost through Belly Drum and Substitute, making Kommo-o harder to revenge kill. Thunder Punch is used to dent and possibly KO common defensive tanks that can survive Drain Punch, like Skarmory, Toxapex, Tera Water Garganacl, Gholdengo, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Bulletproof stacked on top of Tera Steel allows Kommo-o to surprise opponents like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Specs Dragapult looking to revenge kill it. Although Soundproof blocks moves such as Roar from defensive Garchomp and Bug Buzz from Volcarona, it is generally not preferred due to the lack of relevant sound-based moves in comparison to the bevy of aforementioned qualities gained from Bulletproof. Tera Electric can power up Thunder Punch with STAB to score KOs on the likes of Gholdengo, Tapu Lele, and Tera Fairy Kingambit, while Tera Steel gives it useful resistances that may allow it to reach Salac Berry range without Substitute by tanking a resisted hit from the likes of Tapu Lele or Mega Diancie. Belly Drum Kommo-o fits on hyper offensive teams that appreciate its ability to sweep or clean up teams once its checks are removed. Therefore, it appreciates partners that can lure and remove Pokemon like Clodsire, Tera Grass Heatran, Gliscor, and Landorus-T that check it; Tapu Koko in particular is good, as it can run Hidden Power Ice to bait and KO the latter two and badly chip the former two potentially into Kommo-o’s range while also boosting the power of its Thunder Punch by setting Electric Terrain. Belly Drum Kommo-o also has trouble setting up, as it mainly uses the element of surprise to get up a Substitute —namely, it exploits the opponent's fear of Clangorous Soulblaze and thus forces them to switch. Thus, it appreciates dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl in order to more consistently set up Belly Drum.</p> "

Flamethrower takes care of Steel-type Pokemon neutral to Drain Punch like Mega Scizor and Corviknight. Taunt allows Kommo-o to block status moves from defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Swampert, and Gliscor, preventing them from resetting its boosts with Haze or statusing it with Toxic. Alternatively, Clangorous Soul powers up Kommo-o without using its Z-Move, letting its Clangorous Soulblaze outright OHKO Toxapex and Hippowdon, at the cost of longevity.

Drain Punch threatens Steel- and Normal-types like Heatran, Blissey, and Porygon-2 as well as increasing Kommo-o's longevity, making it harder for revenge killers to shut it down after using its Z-Move. Additionally, Drain Punch is Kommo-o's best move to hit Ditto, as it copies its ability Soundproof. Flamethrower targets Fighting-resistant or -immune Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Aegislash. Taunt is preferred to shut down phazers like Haze Toxapex and Hippowdon and bulky walls like Porygon2 and Clodsire, which can inconvenience Kommo-o with Toxic. Meanwhile, Clangorous Soul allows for more boosts and breaking power, notably enabling Clangorous Soulblaze to OHKO the aforementioned Hippowdon and Toxapex. Furthermore, Clangorous Soulblaze allows Kommo-o to set up on Fairy-types and Soundproof Pokemon like Alolan Ninetales, Trace Porygon2, and opposing Kommo-o. Soundproof prevents revenge killing attempts from Ditto or opposing Kommo-o, and a Naive nature permits Kommo-o to outpace Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Lopunny, and Zeraora after obtaining the omni-boost. Mega Altaria is a wonderful teammate, as it helps weaken and clean up opposing Dragon teams; In return, it appreciates Kommo-o dealing with the aforementioned Steel-types. Kyurem aids in matchups against Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Mantine, and Dragonite, as well as Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Tapu Fini, and Mega Altaria. Choice Scarf Latias and Roaring Moon provide speed control; the former offers healing and setup opportunities with Healing Wish, while the latter checks Psychic-types like Deoxys-S, Victini, and Latias. Garchomp offers entry hazards support to pressure and chip down Kommo-o's switch-ins and aids in the Steel matchup with Earthquake. Hisuian Goodra is a huge help in the Fairy matchup, taking on Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Mega Diancie. Mega Latios threatens Flying-type threats with its BoltBeam coverage; in addition, when paired with Garchomp, it puts a lot of pressure on Poison teams, which Kommo-o tends to struggle against. Cyclizar provides entry hazard control with Rapid Spin and extra protection for Kommo-o with Shed Tail, encouraging the use of Clangorous Soul over Taunt. Baxcalibur is excellent in the Dark and Flying matchups, dispatching threats like Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Enamorus with its Swords Dance or Dragon Dance set, and it also ravages Poison teams with Galarian Slowking, which Kommo-o might not be able to handle. In return, Kommo-o removes the aforementioned Steel- and Normal-types that can easily wall Baxcalibur or use it to reverse sweep, specifically Ditto.</p> "

Access to moves like U-turn, Knock Off, and Taunt further allows it to enable the setup sweepers on its team. Knock Off removes Leftovers from Pokemon like Heatran and Corviknight, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Zapdos, Galarian Slowking, and Moltres, making them easier to beat with entry hazards up. It also prevents Ghost-types such as Gholdengo and Dragapult from coming in for free. U-turn allows Rillaboom to pivot out after setting up Grassy Terrain into a teammate who benefits from it. Drain Punch can be used alongside the passive healing of Grassy Terrain to keep Rillaboom healthy throughout the game. It's also crucial for hitting Kingambit while ensuring Heatran and Baxcalibur can't easily take advantage of Rillaboom. Taunt prevents defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking and Corviknight from using healing moves, and it also stops the former from using Chilly Reception and the latter from using Defog, and prevents Pokemon like Ting-Lu and defensive Landorus-T from setting hazards. Wood Hammer is an alternative STAB move that can be used to hit harder at the cost of longevity; for instance, it nets the OHKO against offensive Great Tusk, specially defensive Garganacl, and physically defensive Rotom-W. Terrain Extender is used to allow Rillaboom and its teammates to benefit from Grassy Terrain for longer, but Eject Button is another option that allows Rillaboom to immediately switch into a teammate after getting hit without wasting a turn of Grassy Terrain. Rillaboom will almost never Terastallize, as a teammate will almost always benefit more from it. In rare cases, Tera Fairy or Steel can provide key resistances, allowing Rillaboom to act as an emergency check to Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Baxcalibur, especially with Grassy Terrain to weaken the latter's Earthquake. 52 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Kingambit and uninvested Landorus-T, allowing Rillaboom to hit the former with Drain Punch, as long as it's out of Sucker Punch KO range, and get a hit off or use Taunt on the latter to prevent Stealth Rock from going up. Rillaboom fits on hyper offense teams that benefit from Grassy Terrain, especially with teammates holding a Grassy Seed. Sneasler and Hawlucha are powerful setup sweepers that benefit from the Defense and Speed boost they get from Grassy Seed and Unburden. Sneasler in particular benefits from Earthquake damage being decreased in Grassy Terrain, giving it better odds against Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk without Headlong Rush. Bulky Calm Mind sweepers such as Hatterene and Enamorus-T can use the Defense boost from Grassy Seed to become even more difficult to KO as they start setting up, with the former also appreciating the passive recovery from Grassy Terrain to somewhat make up for the lack of Leftovers. Hazard setters such as Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk benefit from Rillaboom's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and assist the aforementioned sweepers. Kingambit is another great Pokemon that fits on hyper offense and benefits from Rillaboom and its teammates wearing down the opposition. It also greatly benefits from Grassy Terrain providing extra longevity and weakening Earthquake.</p> "

Superpower allows Rillaboom to threaten Steel-types like Heatran, Kingambit, and Ferrothorn, while Wood Hammer does massive damage to all neutral threats, even without a boost. The given EV spread allows Rillaboom to outspeed Mega Tyranitar while maximizing its bulk. The added bulk maximizes Rillaboom’s longevity, helping it perform long-term and deal with other terrain setters, like Tapu Lele. Life Orb gives Rillaboom a chance to OHKO offensive Tornadus-T with Tera Grass-boosted Grassy Glide, with its recoil being negated by the Grassy Terrain. On the other hand, Leftovers provides increased longevity for Rillaboom, allowing it to setup multiple times throughout a game. Tera Grass gives Rillaboom an even stronger Grassy Glide, allowing it to storm through most offensive teams that have limited resistances to it. Some Flying-resistant Tera types such as Steel and Electric can punish Zapdos and Tornadus-T, but they are usually suboptimal and don't benefit Rillaboom's offensive power. Magnezone works well with this set, as it can trap and remove Steel-types like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor. Hawlucha is a good partner as well, as Grassy Seed will activate Hawlucha's Unburden thanks to Grassy Terrain and Rillaboom can weaken their shared check in Zapdos so it can clean late-game. Since Superpower weakens Steel-types, Pokemon like Weavile and Mega Mawile pair well with Rillaboom.

Sucker Punch gives Cinderace a means to hit faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Dragapult super effectively. Alternatively, Gunk Shot can be run to OHKO Iron Valiant and Hatterene while preserving the team's ability to Terastallize.

Ground-types that provide entry hazard support such as Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu make it easier for Cinderace to check threats with Stealth Rock and Spikes, especially if it is running an Adamant nature. Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Iron Valiant pair well with Cinderace, as they can eradicate foes that wall it such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Rotom-W. Similarly, Dragonite and Kingambit can check Pokemon such as Hatterene and Skeledirge, which can both cause issues for Cinderace. In return, Cinderace can provide hazard control for all of these partners and help them come in the field more safely without having to worry about chip damage from entry hazards.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Cinderace functions as an excellent bulky pivot thanks to its great Speed tier, serviceable bulk, and access to support moves such as Court Change and Will-O-Wisp. Cinderace can force out important offensive threats like Gholdengo and Iron Valiant with the threat of STAB Pyro Ball while keeping up momentum against defensive switch-ins with U-turn. Will-O-Wisp allows Cinderace to cripple physical attackers such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Great Tusk, and it can also negate Leftovers for defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. Specifically, Will-O-Wisp offers a safe way for Cinderace to check Kingambit, since it avoids Sucker Punch mindgames. Finally, Court Change offers unmatched utility in providing entry hazard control that cannot be blocked by Gholdengo and is also able to steal opposing dual screens. The 32 Attack EVs guarantee a KO on Gholdengo sets lacking defensive investment and 2HKO on physically defensive Corviknight after Leftovers. Although this set rarely wants to Terastallize, Tera Fire can potentially come in handy for securing KOs with Pyro Ball, especially with a Blaze boost. Alternatively, Tera Flying grants Cinderace an immunity to Ground-type attacks, such as Great Tusk's Earthquake, which can grant it extra opportunities to KO foes or cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Tera Flying also matches up well against common Ground-type hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, letting Cinderace safely Court Change against them.</p> <p>Cinderace works best on bulkier teams where its ability to guarantee hazard removal shines. Defensive Pokemon such as Dondozo, Slowking, Toxapex, and Amoonguss are great teammates, as they appreciate Cinderace's ability to ensure hazard removal, freeing them up to run items other than Heavy-Duty Boots. Water-types such as Dondozo and Toxapex have notably strong synergy with Cinderace; Dondozo checks Great Tusk and Tera Fire Kingambit, while Toxapex can check Water-types, such as Walking Wake and Greninja. Hazard-weak breakers such as Iron Moth and Choice Band Dragonite also fit well with Cinderace, as it's able to bring them in with U-turn. These breakers also enjoy bulky Water-types like Toxapex or Dondozo being burnt, making it easier to overwhelm them long-term. Cinderace usually requires the presence of another hazard control Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hatterene, or Corviknight so it doesn't get overwhelmed. Corviknight synergizes especially well with Cinderace thanks to its Ground immunity and ability to absorb Knock Off from Meowscarada, which outspeeds Cinderace. Skeledirge and Dragapult can take advantage of bulky Cinderace, since both completely wall it and can potentially set up a Substitute. Kingambit is a great partner, as it can offensively check both Skeledirge and Dragapult. In return, it appreciates Cinderace burning Great Tusk and Ting-Lu, opening up the way for it to sweep.</p> "

Low Kick is an alternative, letting Cinderace deal decent damage to most heavy foes such as Ting-Lu and Iron Hands without the large risk of High Jump Kick's crash damage.

Heavy-Duty Boots lets Cinderace come in repeatedly to remove hazards without worrying about residual damage from them.</p> <p>Rotom-H is a great teammate for Cinderace, as its Ground immunity lets it come in on Great Tusk while threatening Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo—that Cinderace can't do much against—with its Electric-type STAB moves.

In return, Cinderace can pivot Rotom-H in with U-turn and keep Stealth Rock off its side of the field. Torkoal is another good teammate for Cinderace, as it provides sun to boost Cinderace's Pyro Ball damage to astronomical levels, provides entry hazard support to chip switch-ins, threatens Chien-Pao and physical Dragapult with a burn, and supplies a secondary source of hazard removal. In return, Cinderace can threaten out Ting-Lu, which might try to switch into Torkoal, while also keeping hazards off against Ghost teams. Scovillain deals with the aforementioned Water-types as well as Gastrodon while appreciating Cinderace removing the hazards that hurt Scovillain's longevity. Volcarona appreciates Cinderace chipping away at the opposing team, facilitating an endgame sweep. In return, Volcarona can hit Dark-types such as Ting-Lu and Hydreigon hard with Bug Buzz, ruin Gastrodon through Giga Drain, and damage Poison-types such as Iron Moth, Toxapex, and Glimmora with Psychic.

Alternatively, Iron Head can be used to threaten the former while avoiding recoil damage.</li> <li>Maximum HP investment and enough Defense to check Chien-Pao is combined with Leftovers and 96 Special Defense EVs, which allows Corviknight to take two Mystical Fires from most Flutter Mane, as well as giving it the ability to take on non-Choice Specs Iron Bundle and weaker attacks like Freeze-Dry from Choice Specs Iron Bundle.</li> <li>Tera Steel or Flying can be used to shed the weaknesses of Corviknight's dual typing: Tera Steel allows Corviknight to resist Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao, while Tera Flying allows Corviknight to resist Great Tusk's Fighting-type attacks.

          "description": "<p>Corviknight has easily cemented itself as a staple on Flying teams, acting as an extremely versatile defensive wall that can also remove entry hazards for its teammates. Iron Head allows Corviknight to handle Flutter Mane and other Fairy-types such as Mimikyu and Hatterene. Body Press hits Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and other Dark- and Steel-types hard. On the other hand, U-turn safely brings in stronger attackers like Dragonite, Iron Jugulis, and Kilowattrel, providing extra counterplay against Pokemon such as Volcarona and Gholdengo, which commonly switch into Corviknight. Pressure is the preferred ability for PP stalling Stealth Rock, while Mirror Armor counters Flutter Mane and Hatterene, which would otherwise overwhelm Corviknight with Mystical Fire. With the listed EV spread and a Careful nature, Corviknight avoids a 2HKO from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball while guaranteeing Iron Head OHKOes Flutter Mane in return. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to ease its matchup against physical threats such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur.</p> <p>Corviknight's capability to take on many offensive threats combined with its Steel typing makes it a stellar asset that almost any offensive Pokemon benefits from. For instance, Iron Jugulis appreciates Corviknight removing Flutter Mane, and Flamigo struggles with Ice Shard variants of Chien-Pao, which Corviknight can safely switch into. Dragonite greatly benefits from Corviknight's ability to soak up Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks while also covering Corviknight's weaknesses to Fire- and Electric-types such as Cinderace, Magnezone, and Volcarona. Gyarados can also act as a reliable wincon against types like Fire and Ground while also making Chien-Pao significantly more managable with Intimidate. Additionally, Kilowattrel is a great offensive pivot to pair with Corviknight, as it removes threats that could harm Corviknight like Greninja, Volcarona, and Azumarill while also absorbing Electric-type attacks. In return, Corviknight counters Iron Treads and Ting-Lu, which threaten Kilowattrel. Pelipper can be paired with Kilowattrel and Corviknight to form a potent rain core that softens the impact of Fire moves and gives Kilowattrel a Water-type Weather Ball, OHKOing many Fire-types that annoy Corviknight including Skeledirge and Rotom-H. Corviknight appreciates having Talonflame as an alternative option against physical attackers, as Talonflame is able to hold off Chien-Pao and burn Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Dragonite, tremendously easing Corviknight's role.</p> "

Body Press targets Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that resist Brave Bird or could take advantage of its recoil like Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Iron Treads, as well as capitalizes off of the Defense boost given by Bulk Up. Alternatively, Taunt prevents Ting-Lu from phazing Corviknight out with Whirlwind and breaks passive teams like Poison due to the prominence of Haze and recovery moves, while Substitute makes it harder to shut down once setup and stalls out Landorus-T's Smack Down. Leftovers provides much-needed recovery and is almost always the preferred item; however, Occa Berry + Body Press can surprise Heatran and Flamethrower Hydreigon. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 80 Def / 180 SpD with an Impish nature allows Corviknight to survive Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R after a Swords Dance, as well as prevents Zamazenta from breaking Substitute with Body Press.</p> <p>Heatran is a great teammate, as it switches into Fire-type moves from Iron Moth, Scovillain, and Moltres and traps and removes Toxapex so Corviknight doesn't need to use Taunt. In return, Corviknight provides an immunity to Ground-type attacks directed at Heatran as well as a Fighting-type neutrality. Gholdengo threatens out Skeledirge and Iron Valiant and takes advantage of walls like Toxapex, opposing Corviknight, and Klefki by setting up Nasty Plot freely. Kingambit checks Ghost-type threats such as Dragapult, Spectrier, and Flutter Mane, as well as heavily wears down teams so Corviknight can setup relatively easily and clean up late-game. Hisuian Goodra is a great specially defenisve tank, taking on Greninja, Basculegion-F, and Volcanion as well as opposing Heatran. Iron Treads offers an Electric-type immunity, handling threats such as Zapdos, Regieleki, and Sandy Shocks, as well as luring Landorus in for a potential KO with Ice Spinner.</p> "

Kleavor is a good lead for Rock teams, as it can deal damage while setting up Stealth Rock with Stone Axe, which helps with hazard stacking. In return, Coalossal complements Kleavor by dealing with Scizor. Diancie can ease the Fighting match by dealing decent damage to Gallade and Iron Valiant with Moonblast and by being able to take Fighting-type moves due to its Fairy-typing.

          "description": "<p>Flapple's unique offensive typing, naturally high Attack stat, decent Speed stat, and acess to an amazing boosting move in Dragon Dance allow it to become one of PU's most devastating wallbreakers. Dragon Dance means Flapple is able to boost its damage output while also being able to outspeed common threats such as Charizard, Dachsbun, and Rotom-F. Sucker Punch can gives Flapple priority to finish off weakened foes. Tera Blast can be used with Tera Ground to threaten Steel-types such as Perrserker and Tinkatuff, which would otherwise counter Flapple. On Ripen sets, Flapple can opt for Arcobatics, giving it strong coverage into foes such as Gogoat, Crabominable, and Rabsca. Ripen is normally the preferred ability and should be ran with Sitrus Berry, as it allows Flapple to set up and regain HP on Pokemon such as Carbink and Raichu. However, Heavy-Duty Boots can be ran instead with Hustle for more immediate power. Flapple most commonly runs Tera Dragon, boosting its Outrage to incredible amounts of power, allowing it to OHKO or 2HKO the majority of the tier. Tera Ground gives Flapple a solid defensive typing, allowing it to block Volt Switch from Pokemon like Electrode and Raichu and should be ran with Tera Blast. Finally, Tera Steel gives Flapple a great defensive typing that can allow it to set up on foes it otherwise could not on such as Skuntank and Masquerain.</p> <p>Flapple's primary struggles are often having issues with setting up safely and Steel-types walling Flapple sets without Tera Blast. Pivots such as Alolan Persian and Rotom-F can help get Flapple in safely to sweep. Alolan Persian is a particularly notable partner, as it can cripple threats that would normally be faster than Flapple even after a boost with Thunder Wave, such as Choice Scarf Skuntank and Lycanroc-N. Fire- and Ground-types such as Charizard and Alolan Dugtrio can check the Steel-types that otherwise give Flapple issues, such as Perrserker and Tinkatuff. In return, Flapple threatens out the defensive Water-types the Fire- and Ground-types would struggle with, such as Whiscash. Poison-types such as Skuntank and Swalot can absorb Toxic Spikes and check opposing Poison-types that cause issues for Flapple. Indeedee-F is also a notable partner, as it can use Healing Wish to heal Flapple back to max health and allow Flapple to be able to set up twice in the game. Spikes from Pokemon such as Carbink and Whiscash help wear down Steel-types for Flapple.</p> "

Alternatively, Dragon Pulse makes for a powerful STAB coverage option that can hit Grass-resistant foes like Scyther and Drifblim. Heavy-Duty Boots helps Appletun check strong special attackers like Pyroar, Rotom, and boosted Veluza consistently with hazards up, but Leftovers can also be used for the extra recovery. Tera Steel helps Appletun flip the script on Pokemon like Scyther, Muk, and Tera Ice Jolteon that traditionally answer it.

Its blistering Speed tier allows it to nearly outpace the entire metagame under rain, including boosted foes like Dragon Dance Dragapult and Mega Swampert. Liquidation's Defense drop lets it potentially 2HKO Pokemon such as Dragapult and Pelipper, while Waterfall's flinches gives Barraskewda slightly better odds to muscle past the likes of Slowbro and Toxapex. Flip Turn keeps up momentum by providing free entry for its teammates while chipping down switch-ins like Dondozo and Tangrowth. Close Combat hits Water-resistant foes such as Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Gyarados, and it provides strong neutral coverage against the likes of Tera Water Great Tusk, Tera Grass Volcarona, and Gastrodon. Aqua Jet prevents Barraskewda from being revenge killed by priority attacks like Kingambit and Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch and—if rain is not active—lets it pick off faster threats such as Sand Rush Excadrill and boosted Volcarona and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, Psychic Fangs pressures Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Water Absorb Clodsire better. Tera Water skyrockets Barraskewda's rain-boosted STAB moves further, potentially 2HKOing even Water-resistant Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Pelipper is a necessary teammate that spearheads rain teams by reliably summoning rain with Drizzle. Mega Swampert is a fantastic offensive partner that can overwhelm shared checks like Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Slowbro and appreciates Barraskewda's Flip Turn to bring it in safely on foes such as Toxapex, Dragapult, and Dragonite. Tornadus-T and Ferrothorn are rain team staples that support Barraskewda with Knock Off, crippling walls such as Rotom-W and opposing Ferrothorn; Ferrothorn in particular helps threaten Gastrodon with Power Whip and sets entry hazards to soften up foes. The aforementioned Pelipper and Tornadus-T also provide Defog support for Barraskewda to pivot throughout the game unperturbed, bring it in safely via U-turn, and threatens problematic Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tera Grass Heatran.</p> "

Liquidation is Barraskewda's strongest spammable STAB option, which under rain 2HKOes Water-resistant targets like Kommo-o after hazard support and OHKOes neutral targets like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to pivot out of Pokemon like Corviknight and Rotom-W, which are not OHKOed by rain-boosted(AH) Liquidation, while still dealing respectable damage and maintaining momentum to get in its teammates to deal with these Pokemon. Close Combat is the strongest coverage move that Barraskewda has access to and it most notably threatens Ferrothorn, which is able to take Liquidation from Barraskewda. Psychic Fangs in conjunction with an Adamant nature lets Barraskewda 2HKO Mega Venusaur and Toxapex, and its secondary effect of destroying dual screens, while situational, is useful in the Fairy matchup. Crunch is an alternative option to let Barraskewda target Psychic-types like Latios, Mega Latias, and Slowbro, which are able to switch into Liquidation. Poison Jab is also an option to target specifically Tapu Bulu and Azumarill, which resist Liquidation and Close Combat. Barraskewda can run a Jolly nature in order to outspeed base 130 Speed Pokemon outside of rain, in particular Tapu Koko, while also being faster than Mega Lopunny, whereas an Adamant nature can also be run to achieve the aforementioned results with Psychic Fangs. Pelipper is a mandatory partner of Barraskewda, as it not only sets rain but also offers a slow U-turn as a form of pivoting, which lets Barraskewda get on the field safely, and its ability to threaten opposing Grass teams with Hurricane helps Barraskewda get past Pokemon like Mega Venusaur. Mega Swampert can form a potent Swift Swim offensive core with Barraskewda, with its superior bulk and defensive typing allowing it to stay in on certain Pokemon like Baxcalibur to achieve the 2HKO with Earthquake. Swampert also works well with Barraskewda, offering hazard support in Stealth Rock to weaken opposing Pokemon so Barraskewda can secure KOs. It also provides slow pivoting with Flip Turn, and its Ground typing is a must to stave off opposing Electric-types like Regieleki, which are faster than Barraskewda outside of rain. Toxapex is also a strong defensive teammate for Barraskewda, being able to cripple Barraskewda's checks with Toxic and also handle setup sweepers like Mega Altaria and Mega Scizor with Haze. Greninja is able to break past physically defensive walls like opposing Toxapex, Mega Scizor,(AC) and Mega Venusaur, which are reliable answers to Barraskewda, while Greninja appreciates Barraskewda being able to handle specially defensive walls like Blissey and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Greninja offers Spikes support, which also assists Barraskewda in wallbreaking more efficiently.</p> "

Its Ghost typing also blocks common priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Breloom's Mach Punch, which allows it to sweep even when Psychic Terrain is not active. Though it is resisted by Steel-types, a Psychic Terrain-boosted Stored Power can still heavily damage even Corviknight, 2HKOing physically defensive variants after just one Shell Smash. Shadow Ball is a consistent STAB move with excellent neutral coverage to hit most Steel- and Psychic-types hard, OHKOing Gholdengo and Hatterene. Tera Blast with Tera Fighting fills a gap in Polteageist's coverage, eliminating Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Kingambit while Psychic Terrain is active, and Hydreigon. Tera Fighting can also let it survive their Dark-type attacks. Weak Armor alongside a Focus Sash allows Polteageist to punish a stray physical attack, further boosting its Speed—it can outspeed +1 foes like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth—and Stored Power's damage. Focus Sash also lets Polteageist set up against threats that would otherwise outpace it or survive an attack and OHKO it, such as Kingambit, Choice Specs Dragapult, and offensive Great Tusk. A Timid nature is run to outpace +1 Walking Wake after a single Shell Smash.</p> <p>Polteageist is a staple on Psychic Terrain offense teams. Indeedee's Psychic Terrain protects Polteageist against priority attacks from Kingambit, Baxcalibur, Azumarill, and Floatzel while powering up its Stored Power, though Polteageist requires both a Shell Smash and a Weak Armor boost to outpace Swift Swim Floatzel. Indeedee can also let Polteageist set up with Encore or give it a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish, although if Polteageist has already consumed its Focus Sash, it will struggle to set up as reliably a second time. Armarouge is an excellent teammate and another staple on Psychic Terrain teams, as it can eliminate Steel-types like Kingambit with Armor Cannon to enable Polteageist's late-game sweep and it can use Endure to activate Weak Armor multiple times against Dragon Darts Dragapult, which Polteageist cannot reliably set up against. In return, Polteageist can greatly weaken or outright eliminate Unaware walls, set up against specially offensive Dragapult if its Focus Sash is intact, and can safely utilize Tera Fighting to eliminate Roaring Moon and wear down Ting-Lu, which allows Armarouge to sweep. Entry hazard removal is extremely important to maintain Focus Sash's protection. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support, can safely get Polteageist in after using a strong Headlong Rush or Close Combat, and can also switch into and threaten Dark-types for Polteageist. Magic Bounce Hatterene deters entry hazards, spreads paralysis with Nuzzle, and can provide Healing Wish support. Also, Eject Button lets it safely pivot Polteageist in, even against U-Turns from Corviknight, Cinderace, or Meowscarada, giving it much easier setup opportunities. Setup sweepers like Tera Psychic Volcarona, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur appreciate Polteageist breaking past Unaware walls with Stored Power. Volcarona further enjoys it wearing down or eliminating Clodsire and Assault Vest Toxapex, and Dragapult and Baxcalibur love it wearing down Steel-types. In return, Volcarona can outright eliminate Steel-types like Corviknight while Dragapult and Baxcalibur can use their multi-hit attacks to threaten opposing Psychic Terrain teams.</p> "

With Magic Bounce, it can switch into and reflect entry hazards from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Blissey. From there, it can begin setting up Calm Mind to pose a greater threat itself and overwhelm the opponent's defensive answers to it. Draining Kiss acts as pseudo-recovery and can help Hatterene heal off damage it's taken from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk. Psyshock allows Hatterene to deal high damage to special walls such as Blissey and Clodsire and win potential setup wars against other Hatterene. Stored Power fulfills a similar role to Psyshock in enabling Hatterene to break through special walls and other Calm Mind users and can also help Hatterene defeat various Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Dondozo, but it requires Hatterene to set up multiple Calm Minds before it becomes truly potent. Mystical Fire deals high damage to many of Hatterene's common switch-ins such as Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Kingambit and has the nice bonus of lowering the target's Special Attack, which is particularly useful against Gholdengo that aren't running Covert Cloak. Nuzzle is another option to cripple switch-ins with paralysis, which can act as useful speed control for Hatterene's teammates. Substitute is another alternative that allows Hatterene to more easily set up in the face of weak hits such as Garganacl's Salt Cure and Clodsire's Earthquake. Tera Water nullifies all of Hatterene's weaknesses, which can grant it more opportunities to use Calm Mind against its checks such as Gholdengo, while Tera Fire can similarly neutralize all of Hatterene's weaknesses and comes with additional benefits such as boosting the damage of its Mystical Fire and letting it check Iron Valiant better. However, Tera Fire also comes with notable downsides, namely giving Hatterene a weakness to Ground-type moves and Stealth Rock, which can hinder its matchups against common entry hazard setters. The EV spread allows Hatterene to move reliably switch into physical attacks from common entry hazard setters while also outspeeding Toxapex and Garganacl.</p> <p>Hatterene's ability to discourage the use of entry hazards will be appreciated by almost any team. Pokemon vulnerable to entry hazards and those that frequently pivot in and out of battle such as Meowscarada, Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Dragapult enjoy Hatterene's support. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight are also good partners, as Hatterene's presence can ease the burden placed on them to remove entry hazards and grants the team greater flexibility in dealing with entry hazard setters. Furthermore, while Hatterene can switch into entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, it can be worn down quickly from their repeated Ground-type attacks. Great Tusk and Corviknight can reduce Hatterene's need to switch in as often by acting as alternative switch-ins. Due to relying on Leftovers and Draining Kiss for recovery, Hatterene can struggle to stay healthy, particularly if it loses its Leftovers to Knock Off or is hit by Salt Cure, so it is recommended to have teammates that can switch into these moves. Corviknight can switch into Knock Off from hazard setters such as Meowscarada and Great Tusk, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo can neutralize Salt Cure. Pokemon holding Rocky Helmet such as Corviknight can be troublesome for Hatterene, as they will wear Hatterene down when it uses Nuzzle or Draining Kiss. Covert Cloak users, especially Gholdengo, are similarly irritating for Hatterene due to nullifying the secondary effect of its Nuzzle or Mystical Fire. Knock Off support from Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and Iron Valiant is thus appreciated to remove these items from the opponent's Pokemon. Hatterene's weakness to Steel- and Ghost-type attacks can be exploited by strong attackers such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Kingambit. Kingambit and Tera Water Garganacl can reliably switch into Gholdengo and Dragapult, while Great Tusk and Dondozo can counter Kingambit.</p> "

Psychic and Dazzling Gleam are STAB moves that let Hatterene remain threatening against hazard setters such as Toxapex, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Garchomp.

As such, Pokemon usually seen on these archetypes like Dragonite, Ceruledge, Iron Moth, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake, as well as Focus Sash users such as Breloom, Armarouge, and Polteageist, enjoy the presence of Hatterene. Offensive pivots such as Roaring Moon and Cinderace invite in defensive walls like Dondozo and Toxapex, against which Hatterene can use Healing Wish safely. Great Tusk can act as a secondary entry hazard control alongside Hatterene, preventing the latter from getting overwhelmed by repeating hits from entry hazards users like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and opposing Great Tusk. Said support is particularly useful on sun teams as keeping Stealth Rock off the field allows for Torkoal to remain healthy and thus set up sun repeated timed throughout the game.</p> "

Mystical Fire is generally preferred over Dazzling Gleam to hit Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Kingambit on the switch, but Dazzling Gleam can be used to threaten Dragonite, Garchomp, and Dragapult.

Eject Button gives Hatterene the ability to take a hit and pivot into a teammate, letting frail wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y and Weavile come onto the field. Tera Steel removes Hatterene's weaknesses to Ghost and Steel, letting it pass a Healing Wish or cripple an opposing Pokemon such as Dragapult and Gholdengo while retaining its advantage against Dragon-types, though typically you would want to Terastallize a teammate for more offensive pressure.

Psyshock lets Hatterene beat opposing Calm Mind and Quiver Dance sweepers like Iron Valiant and Volcarona, while Stored Power lets it bypass Skeledirge with enough Calm Mind boosts.

Hatterene works well when paired with Pokemon that dislike entry hazards, such as defensive Pokemon without Heavy-Duty Boots. These include partners like Toxapex and Garganacl, which can check other offensive and defensive Pokemon, giving Hatterene the leeway for a late-game sweep.

Magic Bounce is especially notable, as it is the only form of entry hazard denial for Fairy teams. Calm Mind turns Hatterene into a deadly sweeper, notably stopping unboosted Flutter Mane from OHKOing it, instead OHKOing Flutter Mane in return after a single boost with Psyshock and letting Hatterene overheal Ting-Lu's Earthquake with Draining Kiss. Psyshock also lets Hatterene break through Unaware Clodsire, Dragalge, and Assault Vest Iron Hands, whereas Psychic 2HKOes Amoonguss and Toxapex as well as generally hitting targets for more damage overall. Draining Kiss gives Hatterene much-needed recovery, allowing it to heal against neutral and super effective targets, notably Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu.

Nuzzle can be used over Mystical Fire or Giga Drain to better support the team via paralysis.

Trick support from Iron Valiant and Gardevoir also helps Hatterene sweep, as this prevents bulkier Pokemon like Unaware Clodsire and Quagsire, Toxapex, and Dondozo from healing any damage taken and instead becoming setup fodder. Gardevoir also helps in the rain and sun matchups, as Trace copying Swift Swim and Chlorophyll removes the burden that Barraskewda, Floatzel, and Scovillain place by outspeeding and OHKOing all three. Azumarill and Mimikyu can support Hatterene as extra sweepers in order to overload the enemy's defensive core and majorly help in the Steel-type matchup that Hatterene dreads so much, notably pressuring Iron Treads, Kingambit, Corviknight, and Gholdengo.</p> "

Gholdengo and Annihilape are good partners, as they can prevent Rapid Spin and deny or punish Defog attempts for Grimmsnarl lacking Taunt, helping dual screens and entry hazards from their teammates stay up.</p> "

Tera Blast provides a STAB move before Terastallizing and can be used with a Ground or Fairy Tera to allow Indeedee-F to hit Steel-types and Dark-types that would normally check it such as Perrserker, Tinkatuff, and Skuntank; however, it is weaker than Hyper Voice. Healing Wish can sacrificially and allow a partner Pokemon to come back in healthy after it has been damaged, building momentum.

Cursed Body is used to potentially punish Pokemon that attack Dragapult while it sets up dual screens, lending Dragapult's teammates an opportunity to set up. Terastallizing Dragapult is rarely recommended in order to let more offensive teammates Terastallize and to avoid Terastallization removing Curse's damaging effect, but Steel can enable Dragapult to take a hit from Enamorus's Moonblast in order to set up dual screens in a pinch.

Tera Ghost maintains an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and strengthens Shadow Ball—its most spammable attack—notably guaranteeing the 2HKO on Corviknight and Assault Vest Iron Treads after Terastallizing. Tera Fairy prevents Dragapult from being picked off by opposing Dragapult and Sucker Punch from Kingambit and Meowscarada. Finally, Tera Dragon turns Draco Meteor into an even more powerful nuke. This takes advantage of the lack of prominent bulky Steel- and Fairy-types in the metagame, notably chunking answers to Ghost-types like Purifying Salt Garganacl and Ting-Lu and 2HKOing Unaware Clodsire.</p> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult fits perfectly on bulky offense and VoltTurn teams. Physical wallbreakers like Great Tusk appreciate Dragapult's U-turn bringing them in safely, and they are able to pressure its switch-ins like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Garganacl. Entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Great Tusk allow Dragapult to pivot throughout the game unperturbed; the former can also pivot it in safely via U-turn, letting it threaten Gholdengo, which tends to switch into Corviknight to block its Defog. Furthermore, Corviknight and Great Tusk provide the necessary defensive backbone to switch into boosted threats such as Roaring Moon, as well as revenge kill attempts from Sucker Punch users like Kingambit. Gholdengo forms a Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can overwhelm a shared check in Ting-Lu, use non-Calm Mind Blissey as setup fodder, and either cripple Tera Water Garganacl with Trick or straight up dent Tera Fairy variants. Entry hazards from Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Garganacl can quickly put foes into Dragapult's KO range, especially as it tends to force a lot of switches; in return, Dragapult spinblocks foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch. Setup sweepers like Iron Valiant appreciate Dragapult wallbreaking early-game for them to clean up late-game easily.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Choice Band Dragapult utilizes its near-unresisted STAB moves, its blistering Speed stat, and its excellent Attack stat to function as a strong physical wallbreaker. The choice for the second move depends on what Tera type Dragapult chooses. Tera Dragon Dragapult uses Phantom Force for a Ghost-type STAB move, but Tera Ghost uses Tera Blast, since, unlike Phantom Force, it is not a two-turn move. Sucker Punch allows Dragapult to revenge kill weakened sweepers such as opposing Dragapult, as well as Iron Moth and Tera Flying Roaring Moon after some chip damage. However, be careful when using Sucker Punch, since opponents can predict it and set up. An Adamant nature gives Dragapult extra wallbreaking power. Alternatively, a Jolly nature allows Dragapult to outspeed the entirety of the unboosted metagame. With Tera Dragon, Dragapult's Dragon Darts becomes harder to switch into; it 2HKOes walls Dragapult normally struggles with such as Ting-Lu. Tera Dragon Dragapult is also less susceptible to Sucker Punch, albeit at the cost of losing its immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is a fantastic partner, since it's able to check Dark-types such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Hazard removal from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for good partners, since Dragapult's lack of longevity makes it difficult to switch in when hazards are up. Great Tusk and Corviknight are able to beat both Scizor and opposing Great Tusk, while Cinderace can threaten bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight. Dragapult benefits from entry hazards from the likes of Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, since it can more effectively wallbreak with entry hazards up. Other pivots such as Scizor and Rotom-W appreciate that Dragapult's U-turn can bring them in. In return, Scizor can revenge kill Ice-types such as Naxcalibur, while Rotom-W can check both Corviknight and defensive Great Tusk. Paralysis support from Rotom-W can shutdown offensive Pokemon like opposing Dragapult and Roaring Moon. Lastly, Gholdengo makes for a good teammate, since it can spinblock and deny Defog and can help Dragapult overwhelm shared checks like Kingambit and Ting-Lu.</p> "

          "name": "Substitute",
          "description": "<p>Unlike its more offensively oriented Choice item sets, this Dragapult set goes for a more multifunctional approach. Dragapult's unmatched Speed tier, in conjunction with STAB Dragon Darts, allows it to snipe key offensive threats such as Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Cinderace with some prior chip damage. This often means that Dragapult will force a lot of switches, which can be capitalized on with Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave to spread status and power up Hex. Both status moves also allow Dragapult to avoid Sucker Punch, which can come in handy against Cinderace, Kingambit, and Meowscarada. With a burn and Stealth Rock up, Hex 2HKOes defensive Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Dondozo, allowing Dragapult to pick apart balanced cores. However, paralyzing its foes allow Dragapult to fish for more free turns to set up Substitute. Substitute improves Dragapult's matchup against Sucker Punch users and avoids status and Salt Cure damage. 76 Attack EVs ensure an OHKO on Roaring Moon with Dragon Darts. Tera Fairy grants it a Dark resistance and Dragon immunity against Pokemon like Kingambit, Walking Wake, and opposing Dragapult, the latter of which could otherwise risk the Speed tie and bypass its Substitute due to Infiltrator. In a pinch however, Terastallization can also be used defensively to avoid other super effective hits, like Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Because of the amount of utility it provides, Dragapult appreciates plentiful chip damage from its teammates, as it lacks immediate power. All forms of entry hazards are greatly appreciated due to Dragapult's ability to force out the opponent, so entry hazard setters like Garganacl, Great Tusk, Glimmora and Ting-Lu form good teammates. Stealth Rock is particularly important since it secures important 2HKOs with Hex. Among the entry hazard setters, Garganacl has fantastic synergy with Dragapult, as it is able to set up Stealth Rock while also chipping down foes with Salt Cure. Partners that can spread status such as Rotom-W and Skeledirge are also excellent teammates. Since Ting-Lu and Garganacl stonewall this set, teammates that scare them out such as Offensive Great Tusk and Banded Meowscarada are great partners. Tera Flying Covert Cloak Gholdengo forms a particularly potent Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can turn common counters to Dragapult such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl into setup fodder. Physical sweepers like Kingambit appreciate having their counters like Corviknight and Great Tusk crippled with burns and have solid type synergy with Dragapult. Due to this set being most potent mid- and late-game, it's more at home in teams with solid defensive backbones that can sponge hits. Defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Hatterene, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Amoonguss can all soak damage for Dragapult from common checks like Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit while setting up entry hazards, spreading status, or dealing chip damage, allowing Dragapult to clean up late-game.</p> "

          "name": "Dragon Dance",
          "description": "<p>Dragapult makes for an excellent sweeper thanks to its neutral coverage with STAB moves, very high Speed stat, and very good Attack stat. Besides hitting most Pokemon in the tier neutrally, Dragon Darts can also break past Focus Sash holders like Ceruledge and Breloom, as well as Dragonite's Multiscale. Pairing it with Phantom Force, or Ghost- or Fairy-type Tera Blast, gives nearly perfect neutral coverage. Substitute stops Sucker Punch from revenge killing Dragapult, blocks status from Pokemon like Rotom-W, and blocks Salt Cure residual damage. Since Dragapult forces many switches, it can find many opportunities to use Substitute and then use Dragon Dance once. With Tera Dragon, its Dragon Darts becomes even harder to switch to, 2HKOing walls like Ting-Lu, Toxapex, Garganacl, and Amoonguss after one Dragon Dance. Tera Ghost grants Dragapult a more reliable Ghost-type STAB move in Ghost-type Tera Blast; unlike Phantom Force, cores like Hatterrne + Roaring Moon can't play around it. Also, Tera Blast does not make contact, improving Dragapult's matchup against Rocky Helmet users such as Corviknight. However, Phantom Force lets Dragapult gain extra longevity from Leftovers. Tera Fairy grants Dragapult an immunity to Dragon, improving its matchups against opposing Dragon-types such as Roaring Moon, Walking Wake, and opposing Dragapult, and it also changes Dragapult's Dark weakness into a resistance, so it no longer fears Sucker Punch. An Adamant nature is standard, but a Jolly nature allows Dragapult to Speed tie opposing positive-nature Dragapult and outspeed +1 Adamant Dragonite.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Dragapult best fits on offense teams, where other offensive Pokemon can help it sweep more easily late-game. Also, they enjoy Dragapult forcing switches due to its Speed. Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant and Breloom can punch holes early- and mid-game for Dragapult to sweep, as well as checking Dark-types like Kingambit and Ting-Lu, which can cause Dragapult trouble. Iron Valiant also appreciates Dragapult checking Psychic-types that can give it trouble such as Hatterene. Ting-Lu and Great Tusk can set entry hazards for Dragapult and check opposing Dark-types. Dragapult dislikes Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Dondozo, since they can ignore its Dragon Dance boosts and force it out. Hence, wallbreakers that can check them such as Gholdengo are welcome. Lastly, Dragapult tends to struggle against Pokemon that contest its Dragon Dance with a Defense-boosting move, such as Bulk Up Corviknight, Bulk Up Great Tusk, and Curse Garganacl. Therefore, Pokemon like Ceruledge and Skeledirge to cover Corviknight, Rotom-W to cover Great Tusk, and Covert Cloak Gholdengo to cover Garganacl make for good partners. In return, Dragapult can set up on and check Pokemon they can struggle with, such as Roaring Moon and Walking Wake.</p> "

Dragon Darts is a reliable, hard-hitting Dragon-type STAB move that allows Dragapult to break Breloom's Focus Sash and Dragonite's Multiscale. Phantom Force is Dragapult's best choice for Ghost-tpye STAB move, as otherwise it is walled by any Fairy- or Steel-type, while Disable can disrupt Choice-locked Pokemon from potentially breaking its Substitute or attacking Dragapult in general. Substitute allows Dragapult to ease prediction and also adds a layer of protection against status moves, allowing it to set up on more passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. It also synergizes well with Disable, allowing Dragapult to set up with ease. Will-O-Wisp is another option over Disable to allow Clodsire and Quagsire to become setup bait, while also crippling Kingambit and Ting-Lu; however, Disable is more consistent. Leftovers allows Dragapult to use Substitute multiple times throughout a game and be more annoying overall with Disable, while Dragon Fang is a good choice to boost Dragon Darts.</p> <p>Skeledirge is a fantastic partner, as it can wall Fairy-types such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Hatterene while also threatening foes like Kingambit that can easily take out Dragapult with their STAB priority moves. Gholdengo is another fantastic partner that can threaten Fairy-types like Klefki and Flutter Mane, if Gholdengo uses a Choice Scarf, and take care of physical walls such as opposing Skeledirge. Brambleghast is another good partner, as it can keep entry hazards off of the field, allowing Dragapult to come in multiple times, as well as providing Spikes support to soften up Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Iron Treads. Hisuian Zoroark provides the team with not just a Ghost immunity, but also can easily use Illusion to disguise itself as Dragapult and lure in foes that would normally threaten it, such as Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and opposing Dragapult, to open up for a potential Dragapult sweep. Flutter Mane is another great partner thanks to its ability to handle opposing Dragon-types such as Baxcalibur, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. It can also provide immediate speed control if need be to take care of other Choice Scarf users that could revenge kill Dragapult before it gets a Dragon Dance up. Mimikyu is an amazing wallbreaker that can either help wear down physical walls for Dragapult to clean up or can take advantage of Dragapult punching holes in the opponent's team to clean up itself. Mimikyu can also heavily threaten opposing Ghost-types for Dragapult like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo thanks to its STAB priority in Shadow Sneak. It also provides a one-time check to setup sweepers such as Chien-Pao and Kingambit thanks to its ability Disguise.</p> "

After a Dragon Dance, Dragapult outspeeds all Choice Scarf and Booster Energy users, such as Kartana, Greninja, and Iron Valiant, making it extremely hard to stop if it sets up successfully. Ghostium Z-powered Phantom Force enables a boosted Dragapult to blast through bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Heatran after slight chip damage. Dragapult's typing gives it opportunities to switch in and set up against certain Pokemon such as Volcarona, non-Ice Spinner Dragonite, and Urshifu-R locked into a Fighting-type move. Substitute is the preferred option in the last moveslot to ease prediction and facilitate setup while also avoiding priority. Substitute also allows Dragapult to play mind games with Kingambit. Fire Blast is another option that allows Dragapult to deal massive damage to physically defensive Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, both of which can survive a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare at full health. Clear Body is the preferred ability to avoid stat drops from Intimidate, but Infiltrator can also be used to improve the matchup against dual screens teams. A Jolly nature lets Dragapult outspeed Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko prior to setting up. Dragon Dance Dragapult fits best on offensive teams, where it can function as a potent late-game cleaner with its Z-Move. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Glimmora can help chip bulky foes such as Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit into range of Dragapult's attacks. Gholdengo can block attempts to remove entry hazards, as well as pressure certain physical walls that give Dragapult a hard time, such as Ferrothorn. Dragapult can struggle with bulky physical walls such as Dondozo, Garganacl, and post-Tera Skeledirge, so powerful special wallbreakers that can take advantage of these Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y, are greatly appreciated. Tapu Lele also provides Psychic Terrain, which thwarts revenge killing attempts from priority moves. A late-game cleaner such as Dragonite or Booster Energy Iron Valiant can take advantage of the holes Dragapult left behind in the enemy defensive core.</p> "

Against common checks like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Toxapex, it can bring in Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Great Tusk, and Tapu Koko, respectively, to punish the opponent. Will-O-Wisp boosts Hex to monstrous levels and threatens to pacify physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Kingambit. Dragon Darts is a strong physical move to better hit special walls like Clodsire, forcing it to recover lest Dragapult's teammates like Iron Valiant break through. With Tera Ghost, it can muscle through specially defensive Toxapex after burn and entry hazard damage with Hex, though Tera Fairy helps it tank hits from opposing Dragapult and Dark-type moves like Pursuit, and it can still check Zamazenta. Infiltrator allows it to check threats behind Substitutes, such as Iron Defense Zamazenta. Dragapult struggles to break through Heatran, so Pokemon that can pressure it such as Garchomp and Rotom-W are great partners. It also must be careful around Pursuit trappers like Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar, as even after a burn they heavily chip it; teammates like Urshifu-R, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk are thus mandatory to threaten said trappers. Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y very much appreciate Dragapult crippling and weakening Kingambit and Tyranitar, respectively, as this aids in the process of removing them. In return, Dragapult can clean up the opposing team after its checks are gone. Pivots like Rotom-W and Corviknight bring Dragapult in, with the former checking Heatran and forming a nice VoltTurn core with it, and the latter tanking Dragon- and Fairy-type moves for it. Entry hazards and Knock Off from the likes of Ferrothorn and Great Tusk weaken the opposition for Dragapult to clean, notably its checks like Toxapex and Clodsire.</p> "

U-turn takes advantage of this limited pool, pressuring Shadow Ball switch-ins like Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar while bringing in teammates such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Flamethrower hits Kingambit for massive damage, while Hydro Pump helps against Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu. Finally, Thunder pressures would-be checks, such as Toxapex. Ghost is the best Tera type for Dragapult, as it propels its Shadow Ball to a near-unstoppable level, making it even more spammable. Dragon boosts Draco Meteor's damage while making Dragapult less susceptible to Pursuit, while Tera Fairy purely helps it defensively: not only does it not fear Pursuit, but it's also not weak to Ice Shard or Sucker Punch from Weavile and Kingambit, respectively. Finally, it gives Dragapult a Dragon immunity, which allows you to beat Dragon Dance Dragapult after it burns the Z-Move. Dragapult must be wary of Pursuit from Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit, as they can both shrug off multiple Shadow Balls and remove it from the game. However, it can pivot around its checks, so Pokemon that can take advantage of and remove them make great partners, such as Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant. The latter two also share checks with Dragapult, like Clodsire and Toxapex, meaning they can overwhelm these checks. Dragapult also greatly appreciates Knock Off support from Tornadus-T, Weavile, or Ferrothorn, as its checks such as Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Garganacl all rely a lot on their items. Finally, since checks such as the aforementioned Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit are very susceptible to Spikes, Dragapult appreciates its setters such as Ting-Lu, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon.</p> "

Zamazenta's Crunch allows it to hit and at least 2HKO checks such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Galarian Slowking. With Heavy Slam, Zamazenta OHKOes Enamorus and Iron Valiant and 2HKOes Tera Fairy Toxapex. Stone Edge affords Zamazenta the ability to 2HKO Zapdos, notably avoiding Static in doing so, while also 2HKOing Skeledirge; alternatively, Wild Charge can be used to 2HKO Toxapex.

Consequently, Galarian Slowking is a very good teammate, as it provides Future Sight support, which heavily pressures otherwise solid checks such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Dondozo, allowing Zamazenta to break past its checks more easily. Additionally, Galarian Slowking provides a means of dealing with common counterplay to Zamazenta such as Zapdos, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant, as well as supplying Zamazenta with opportunities to come in through Chilly Reception. Other pivots such as Landorus-T and Zapdos are good partners too, as through their respective pivot moves, they also provide Zamazenta chances to safely come in and weaken the opposing team. Zamazenta is often worn down by hazards, as well as having to check threats such as Kingambit early on; solid checks to these which provide a means of hazard removal, like Corviknight and Great Tusk, respectively, are good partners. Kingambit is a strong teammate, as it appreciates the wallbreaking Zamazenta does earlier on to facilitate Kingambit's ability to clean late-game. Kingambit also appreciates the speed control Zamazenta provides, aiding Kingambit in revenge killing its offensive checks such as non-Choice Scarf Enamorus, non-Booster Energy Iron Valiant, and offensive Great Tusk. In return, Kingambit checks foes that take advantage of Zamazenta being locked into Close Combat, such as Gholdengo and Dragapult. Likewise, other cleaners such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Booster Energy Iron Valiant also appreciate Zamazenta's weakening of the opposing team.

The last moveslot is fairly versatile; Substitute makes setting up multiple Iron Defenses easier and protects Zamazenta from status, while Heavy Slam hits Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Enamorus for high damage. Rest can also be used in conjunction with a Lum Berry to offer a one-time reprieve from Zamazenta's lack of recovery. 168 Speed EVs let Zamazenta outrun Adamant Dragonite after a single Dragon Dance and neutral-natured Dragapult. Maximum HP EVs are used in order to maximize overall bulk, which lets it survive Moonblast from Choice Scarf Enamorus and Tera Dragon Dragapult's Draco Meteor. Leftovers's passive recovery makes Zamazenta even harder to KO and is vital for its longevity due to its lack of healing moves. It also synergizes excellently with Substitute. Tera Steel gives Zamazenta a fantastic defensive typing, letting it soak up Fairy-type attacks from the likes of Hatterene and Iron Valiant before retaliating with a STAB-boosted Heavy Slam. Tera Electric is another solid defensive option that lets it beat Zapdos, giving it an immunity to paralysis and a resistance to both of its STAB attacks. Lastly, Tera Fairy, in conjuction with Heavy Slam, gives it an advantage over other Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. Tera Fairy also enables it to better check physical Dragapult, preventing even the special variants of it from revenge killing it reliably even when behind a Substitute due to Infiltrator.</p> <p>Zamazenta fits well on offensive teams, including hyper and bulky offense. Galarian Slowking makes for a great partner due to its ability to sponge hits from the Fairy-types Zamazenta despises, mainly Iron Valiant. It also provides offensive support with Future Sight and makes it easy for Zamazenta to get in with Chilly Reception. Other pivots, such as Landorus-T and defensive Zapdos, are appreciated so that Zamazenta can get in safely; the latter is especially useful for absorbing Flying-type moves and punishing Pokemon such as Sneasler and physical Iron Valiant with Static, negating any potential Speed boosts via Unburden or Booster Energy and enabling Zamazenta to revenge kill them. Due to Zamazenta preferring Leftovers, it is easily worn down by entry hazards. Great Tusk and Corviknight both provide hazard control, with the former also being able to set its own hazards to wear down the opposing team and the latter providing excellent defensive synergy, checking Fairy-types such as Choice-locked Enamorus. Wallbreakers that can muscle through Zamazenta's checks and weaken the opposing team are appreciated. Choice Scarf Enamorus provides speed control against Dragapult and has a favorable matchup against Iron Valiant, and Choice Specs Gholdengo helps cripple physically bulky Pokemon such as Dondozo with a combination of its sheer power and Trick. On hyper offense teams, Curse Dragapult is a great screens setter due to its high Speed stat and ability to set up on more passive threats as well as get Zamazenta in safely with U-turn or by causing itself to faint with Curse.</p> "

Mold Breaker Eternatus appreciates support from mixed attackers like Mega Diancie and Arceus-Ghost, as these can help pressure one of Eternatus's best checks in RegenVest Primal Kyogre; these both also appreciate Eternatus's strong matchup into specially defensive Fairy-types if using Toxic or Sludge Bomb.

Swords Dance on top of very strong Base Power moves in Surging Strikes and Close Combat means that Urshifu-R can effectively break through a variety of defensive cores, especially with Terastallization. This includes Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Unaware Clodsire. Urshifu-R's Water / Fighting typing gives it chances to pivot into offensive Pokemon such as Weavile and Mega Scizor, providing it defensive utility as well. Taunt lets Urshifu-R pressure defensive Pokemon and prevent Toxic and Haze from being used while negating recovery on checks without Regenerator such as Pelipper, Dragonite, and Buzzwole. Ice Punch pressures checks such as Dragonite and Dragapult. A boosted Aqua Jet is able to KO a chipped Tapu Koko, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny, especially with support from Pelipper's rain and Tera Water. Thunder Punch can be used to pressure or break through bulky Water-types that would normally wall Urshifu-R, such as Pelipper, Tapu Fini, Toxapex, Slowbro, and Dondozo. Punching Gloves is the preferred option for boosting both Thunder Punch's and Surging Strikes's base power and preventing Rocky Helmet recoil. Swords Dance- and Tera Water-boosted Surging Strikes is able to break past checks such as Buzzwole, Dragonite, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Iron Hands, especially when supported by rain from Pelipper. Pelipper is one of the best partners for Urshifu-R because it provides rain support, boosting Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes to absurd levels. Tornadus-T is a great teammate for Urshifu-R, as it appreciates Urshifu-R's ability to break past Ferrothorn, Clodsire, Garchomp, and Blissey while soft checking Weavile and Tyranitar. In return, Tornadus-T with Taunt is able to take on defensive Water-types such as Dondozo and Toxapex as well as Kartana. Tornadus-T can also utilize Supersonic Skystrike to break shared checks such as Tapu Koko and Toxapex. Mega Diancie, Ferrothorn, and Garchomp are valuable partners for setting entry hazards to wear down Urshifu-R's checks such as Buzzwole, Dragapult, and Tangrowth. Tapu Koko is another synergistic partner for being able to pivot into Toxapex and other defensive Water-types. Future Sight support from Tapu Lele and Slowbro is much appreciated to make it easier for Urshifu-R to take on Dondozo, Tangrowth, Toxapex, and Buzzwole without using Terastallization or Swords Dance. Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Dragapult are also threats, since they resist all of Urshifu-R's common moves bar Ice Punch, can threaten it out with Choice Specs-boosted attacks in Dragapult's case, or Dragon Dance in front of Urshifu-R, though Dragapult cannot switch into Urshifu-R multiple times. Garganacl also acts as a consistent check to Dragapult, sets Stealth Rock for Urshifu-R, provides a consistent switch-in to Skeledirge, as well as Toxapex and Dondozo when Terastallized into a Fairy- or Water-type, and pressures them for Urshifu-R with Salt Cure. If not running Taunt, Swords Dance Urshifu-R struggles with bulky Unaware threats like Tera Fairy Skeledirge and Dondozo, so special wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Choice Specs Tapu Koko, Tera Grass Heatran, and Flyinium Z Tornadus-T are appreciated.</p> "

Urshifu-R can pivot into offensive Pokemon such as Weavile and Mega Scizor, but prefers to not lose its item. Since Urshifu-R forces switches with its STAB combo, U-turn is an excellent move to generate momentum on these switches, letting it bring in a teammate. Aqua Jet allows for Urshifu-R to KO a chipped Tapu Koko, Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and pre-Tera Volcarona. Ice Punch hits Dragapult and Dragonite super effectively. Tera Water is the preferred Tera type, as once Rocky Helmet users are knocked off by a supporting partner and Garchomp and Ferrothorn are dealt with, Tera Water-boosted Surging Strikes can overwhelm checks such as Pelipper, Tera Water Garganacl, Tapu Fini, Toxapex, and Slowbro, especially with support from Pelipper's rain. Pelipper is a fantastic partner for Urshifu-R by virtue of it providing rain, which strengthens Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes. Entry hazard setters such as Glimmora, Garchomp, Clodsire, and Ferrothorn can help in wearing down its checks. Tapu Lele is a fantastic partner by providing Future Sight support, which lets Urshifu-R beat checks like Dragonite, Skeledirge, and Toxapex for Urshifu-R, as well as appreciating Urshifu-R's ability to pivot into Heatran and take on Ferrothorn. Urshifu-R struggles with defensive Water-types and Tangrowth, so partners such as Tapu Koko and Tornadus-T pair well with it. Tapu Koko also forms a pivot core with it, being able to consistently switch into Toxapex and Slowbro, and powering up Urshifu-R's Thunder Punch, while Urshifu-R pressures Ferrothorn for Tapu Koko. Tornadus-T is able to pressure defensive Water-types such as Toxapex with Taunt, check Kartana, remove entry hazards so that Urshifu-R can come in more often, bring Urshifu-R in with U-turn, and even utilize Supersonic Skystrike to break past shared checks such as Tapu Koko and the aforementioned defensive Water-types. Tornadus-T also appreciates Urshifu-R's ability to break Ferrothorn, while soft checking Tyranitar and Weavile. Urshifu-R struggles with Dragonite, so it appreciate partners such as Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, Pelipper, or Tera Fairy/Water Garganacl to help take on Dragonite. Rocky Helmet users such as Garchomp and Buzzwole make it harder for Urshifu-R to freely use Surging Strikes, so Knock Off support from users such as Weavile and Toxapex is much appreciated. Weavile in particular is able to take on Tornadus-T, Tangrowth, Dragonite, and Garchomp while also pressuring Toxapex. Urshifu-R is forced out by faster special attackers such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Tornadus-T, so Ferrothorn and Heatran are great partners for taking on these Pokemon and also providing entry hazard support. Pivots such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Dragapult are good partners for being able to bring in Urshifu-R consistently throughout a game to wallbreak.</p> "

U-turn is integral, providing valuable pivoting potential on checks like Toxapex and Slowbro and serving as a midground into contact punishment from the likes of Ferrothorn and Garchomp. Aqua Jet allows Urshifu-R to halt Volcarona as well as pick off weakened sweepers such as Sneasler. Alternatively, Ice Spinner can be used to hit Dragon-types like Dragapult, Garchomp, and Dragonite.

Swords Dance allows Urshifu-R to set up on a predicted switch. Surging Strikes is a generally powerful move that allows Urshifu-R to muscle past threats such as Bulk Up Corviknight and defensive Gholdengo after a Swords Dance. Close Combat hits Dark- and Steel-types such as Hydreigon and Hisuian Goodra that try to switch in on Surging Strikes, while Drain Punch is weaker but provides some much-appreciated recovery. Finally, Urshifu-R has many viable options for its 4th moveslot; Aqua Jet deters Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane from attempting to revenge kill Urshifu-R, Thunder Punch hits Flying-types such as Pelipper as well as heavily damaging Toxapex, and Ice Punch hits Water Absorb Clodsire, Garchomp, and Flying-types such as Zapdos and Dragonite. Zen Headbutt can be run to damage Amoonguss and do well against Poison teams. Punching Glove allows Urshifu to gain a small boost to its punching moves while being protected from Zapdos's Static and other contact-punishing abilities.</p> <p>Greninja and Hisuian Samurott are great teammates for Urshifu-R, as they take Psychic-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Indeedee's Psychic and Choice Band Hoopa-U's Zen Headbutt with impunity and punish them with Dark Pulse and Ceaseless Edge, respectively. Hisuian Samurott also sets Spikes to aid in Urshifu-R's wallbreaking efforts, while Greninja can threaten Fighting-types that Urshifu-R struggles with such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Sneasler with Extrasensory. In return, Urshifu-R can take Bug-type attacks such as Choice Band Scizor's U-turn and Choice Scarf Kleavor's X-Scissor, as well as threaten opposing Dark-types such as Chien-Pao. Pelipper provides rain support to augment Urshifu-R's already scary wallbreaking abilities as well as a Grass neutrality to take Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Flower Trick. Toxapex and Quagsire take Fairy- and Electric-type attacks, respectively, while both wearing attackers down with Toxic. Toxapex also removes Toxic Spikes, which can put Urshifu-R on a timer. Gastrodon is an alternative Electric immunity, sacrificing physical bulk for a better specially defensive profile. Rotom-W does well in the Water mirror matchup, as well as doing good damage to Toxapex with Volt Switch. Additionally, it can create setup opportunities for Urshifu-R by burning physical attackers such as Dragonite and Great Tusk thanks to Will-O-Wisp. Barraskewda provides a good source of speed control as well as respectable power, while Basculegion-F is a good special attacker that can blow through common Urshifu-R checks such as physically defensive Toxapex and Quagsire. Both of these appreciate Urshifu-R breaking through their checks: Bulk Up Corviknight for Barraskewda and Gastrodon for Basculegion-F. Finally, Walking Wake can blow through defensive staples such as Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Amoonguss with Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteors. In exchange, Urshifu-R takes care of Hisuian Goodra.</p> "

Aqua Jet threatens frailer revenge killers, taking out faster targets like Flutter Mane, Sandy Shocks, and Volcarona after a Swords Dance boost. Alternatively, Thunder Punch may be used to better deal with Azumarill, Pelipper, and Toxapex, while Zen Headbutt hits Amoonguss in addition to Toxapex and Clodsire. Surging Strikes notably deals with Landorus-T, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk as well as threatening Bulk Up Corviknight and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Other options include Ice Punch to hit Amoonguss while also threatening Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Dragapult and Taunt to prevent Toxapex, Quagsire, and Water Absorb Clodsire from using recovery moves as well as Toxic and Haze.

Zamazenta appreciates Urshifu-R heavily wearing down teams to allow it to easily clean up late-game with Iron Defense. Iron Valiant removes threats such as Hisuian Lilligant, Meowscarada, and Greninja while also being a huge asset in the Flying matchup thanks to Thunderbolt.

Power Whip is an excellent STAB move that allows Zarude to 2HKO Toxapex and Hatterene. Drain Punch grants Zarude a form of recovery while still 2HKOing Hisuian Goodra and Heatran, whereas Close Combat grants Zarude a stronger Fighting-type coverage. Alternatively, Jungle Healing allows Zarude access to longevity and removing its own status safely, as it forces many switches.</p> <p>Amoonguss is a great defensive partner for Zarude, as it is able to resist Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from Flutter Mane, Sneasler, and Iron Valiant, melt Toxic Spikes, and spread status for more offensive teammates with either Toxic or Spore. In return, Zarude can threaten the Psychic-types Amoonguss loses to, like Hatterene, Armarouge, and Iron Leaves. Choice Scarf Meowscarada makes for another good teammate, as it can outspeed and threaten Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Dragapult, and Hydreigon with Play Rough. In return, Zarude can handle the aforementioned Steel-types that Meowscarada struggles with, and the two of the form a strong U-turn core to complement their teammates. Hisuian Electrode and Rotom-C is a great addition on any Grass team, as thanks to its Speed tier and Electric typing, it can threaten slower Flying-types such as Corviknight and Enamorus as well as Water-types like Toxapex and Volcanion. Zarude's wallbreaking and support role enables sweepers like Hisuian Liligant to sweep Flying thanks to the latter's access to Ice Spinner as well as being able to clean Steel teams. Brambleghast and Toedscruel make for great teammates, as they can set up hazards to wear down incoming Pokemon for Zarude to break easier and remove them with Rapid Spin to enhance Zarude's pivoting ability. Toedscruel also has enough Special Defense to survive a Flamethrower from Choice Scarf Iron Moth and OHKO it back. On the other hand, Brambleghast's Ghost typing also allows it to spinblock, thus preserving hazards on the field, and thanks to its ability Wind Rider, it can switch into anticipated Flying-type attacks. Iron Leaves makes for another great partner, being able to provide Grass teams a positive matchup against Fighting and Poison teams.

Volt Switch lets Regieleki punish foes like Amoonguss, Galarian Slowking, and Hisuian Goodra, which can take advantage of it, allowing teammates like Zapdos and Iron Hands to exploit them instead. Rapid Spin leverages Regieleki's capability to force opponents to bring in a Ground-type or risk significant damage, providing Electric teams with much-needed entry hazard control. Thunder Wave mitigates the threat of Hisuian Lilligant, Spectrier, and Zamazenta if Regieleki is unable to finish these off. Heavy-Duty Boots enhances Regieleki's ability to pivot and consistently remove entry hazards. Alternatively, 28 Atk EVs in conjunction with a Naive nature could be considered, and Magnet is recommended when using Regieleki with Wild Charge to secure an OHKO against Flutter Mane. Magnet also enables Regieleki to reach specific damage thresholds, such as OHKOing Iron Valiant with Thunderbolt. A Timid or Naive nature with maximum Speed EVs is needed to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Hisuian Zoroark.</p> <p>Given that Ground-types like Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Quagsire shut down Regieleki's antics, teammates like Nasty Plot Rotom-W, Swords Dance Iron Hands, and Substitute Zapdos that capitalize on these are crucial for its success. It's important to keep in mind that the player using Regieleki can also choose to double out when anticipating a Ground-type switch-in, allowing teammates to threaten these walls. In return, Regieleki eliminates Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao, which threaten its allies. Magnezone can equip an Assault Vest to check Choice Scarf users like Flutter Mane and Greninja, which zoom past Regieleki, and it can wear down Landorus-T and Quagsire as they repeatedly switch in. Sandy Shocks provides entry hazards to further wear down the opposing team, is bulky enough to bear a hit from and deal with Choice Scarf Sneasler, and puts pressure on Quagsire and Glimmora. Pawmot handles fast Ground-types like Landorus, applies pressure on Flying and Water teams with its Ice- and Grass-type coverage, and grants Regieleki a second chance at sweeping through Revival Blessing. Thundurus-T and Rotom-C are also appreciated, as Thundurus-T provides colorful coverage to deal with Poison- and Ground-types like Amoonguss and Great Tusk, while Rotom-C is able to greatly threaten the entirety of Water teams with its STAB moves.</p> "

Thunderbolt is a stronger STAB option to use on switch-ins such as Iron Moth and Skeledirge, forcing them to use their recovery moves while Regieleki can pivot out, while Explosion can be used to heavily chip common RegenVest users like Hisuian Goodra and Meloetta, opening up opportunities for Regieleki's teammates like Iron Moth and Enamorus-T. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item, as it allows Regieleki to have better longevity for spinning and pivoting, but Never-Melt Ice and Life Orb can also be used to make Tera Blast and Explosion more potent. Since Regieleki has a very high natural Speed tier, an alternative EV spread of 244 HP / 252 SpA / 12 Spe can be ran with a Mild nature to have more bulk while still being able to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the tier. Due to its frail bulk, it is highly recommended to pair Regieleki with another spinner such as Quaquaval or Iron Treads, as they can take hits from common hazard setters like Garchomp and allow Regieleki to pivot in teammates more freely with Volt Switch. Regieleki also pairs up well with physical pivots like Galarian Zapdos, Slither Wing, and Meowscarada, as they can create a strong VoltTurn duo and threaten the Pokemon that Regieleki lures in such as Hisuian Goodra and Meloetta while Regieleki can pivot them in safely. Regieleki can struggle with breaking through bulky Pokemon such as Iron Treads and Scream Tail, so pairing it with a Pokemon that can break through both of them such as Zamazenta-C, Magic Guard Volcanion, or Heatran is advised.</p> "

Spectrier utilizes Draining Kiss to hit Dark-type Pokemon that would otherwise resist its STAB Shadow Ball like the aforementioned Greninja as well as non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Roaring Moon. Draining Kiss also serves as a secondary recovery option to help heal off the damage taken by setting up a Substitute. Nasty Plot is used to elevate Spectrier's Special Attack to incredible heights without having to KO foes beforehand. Spectrier shines best when it is able to set up a Substitute, and subsequently a Nasty Plot, in the face of a more passive foe like Toxapex, then begin spamming its scarcely resisted Shadow Ball + Draining Kiss combination. Leftovers is used to provide more substantial recovery than Draining Kiss, but Colbur Berry is an option to take a Dark-type attack from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Chien-Pao, and Barraskewda. Will-O-Wisp should be used instead of Substitute if Colbur Berry is the item of choice, as it allows Spectrier to capitalize on surviving an attack from these extremely potent physical threats. If Will-O-Wisp is preferred over Substitute, Hex can also be used to deal more damage to burned threats.</p> <p>Skeledirge can switch into strong physical attacks from Pokemon that threaten Spectrier such as Choice Scarf Gallade, Scizor, Ceruledge, and Mimikyu lacking Shadow Claw, then scare them with Will-O-Wisp. Mimikyu is also a great teammate, as it can help Spectrier deal with Pokemon that may not go down to a single Draining Kiss, such as Ting-Lu, as well as Kingambit and Chien-Pao if Disguise is in tact. Mimikyu is also able to finish off threats such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult with Shadow Sneak. Froslass and Brambleghast are teammates that work well with Spectrier, setting up Spikes for Spectrier to nab easier KOs and snowball with Grim Neigh. Froslass is also able to use Thunder Wave to slow down faster Pokemon, while Brambleghast is able to remove entry hazards via Rapid Spin, allowing Spectrier to pivot more freely. Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is a great teammate thanks to its incredible Speed and ablility to deal with common Choice Scarf users that give Spectrier trouble such as Gholdengo, Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk. STAB Moonblast can also damage or remove Dark-type Pokemon to make Spectrier's job easier. Finally, Hisuian Zoroark is a solid teammate due to its ability to switch into Ghost-type attacks that would otherwise threaten Spectrier and all of its other teammates. Hisuian Zoroark can also apply utility support by wearing down opposing teams with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off. Dragapult is a great teammate, as it can burn and force damage on common walls like Quagsire, Clodsire, Alolan Muk and Ting-Lu, and forcing damage on them to make sweeping easier. It is also important to note that burned Quagsire and Clodsire cannot break Spectrier's Substitute in one hit, making setting up a lot easier. Finally, bulky Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a great teammate for Spectrier. Gholdengo can wear down Dark- and Poison-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Clodsire, which Spectrier struggle with, while Spectrier can help with faster threats like Dragon- and Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Hydreigon and Great Tusk.</p> "

Sharpness-boosted Stone Axe smashes common Flying- and Fire- types, such as Enamorus, Skeledirge, and Cinderace, while also setting up Stealth Rock in the same turn. Night Slash punishes Gholdengo, which resists all of Kleavor's other moves, though be wary that Kleavor can only 2HKO it even with Stealth Rock up. Aerial Ace is also an option to hit Great Tusk if it tries to switch in and remove entry hazards set by Kleavor. U-turn picks up momentum for the team and switches Kleavor out against foes such as Landorus-T, Iron Hands, and Azumarill. X-Scissor can be used to deal much more damage than U-turn thanks to being boosted by Sharpness, 2HKOing Amoonguss and Sableye. Close Combat helps Kleavor deal with Steel-types such as Kingambit and Heatran, though the latter requires chip damage to OHKO.</p> <p>All of Kleavor's teammates enjoy its ability to set up Stealth Rock while also dealing damage in the same turn. Volcarona and Frosmoth appreciate Kleavor's entry hazard support wearing down the opposing team and its ability to deal with Flying- and Fire-types, which enable them to set up and sweep late-game. In return, Volcarona can deal with Steel-types such as Corviknight and Gholdengo, while Frosmoth can deal with Ground- and Water-types such as Landorus-Th and Quagsire. Frosmoth is also a wincon against Flying- and Dragon-types when Stealth Rock is set up. Scizor acts as a sweeper that takes advantage of Kleavor weakening opposing teams, and it also forms a U-turn core that appreciates Kleavor's Fire neutrality with it. Additionally, Scizor can block Toxic from Clodsire and Mortal Spin from Glimmora, and threaten them with either Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch or setting up with Swords Dance. Lokix, Heracross, and Slither Wing also appreciate the opposing team being weakened by Kleavor, as well as the speed control Kleavor provides. This enables them to finish off foes by making use of priority moves and strong physical attacks, such as Lokix taking out Gholdengo with Sucker Punch or Throat Chop. Forretress provides great hazard control thanks to Rapid Spin, and it's also able to switch into strong physical attacks to scout thanks to its high physical defense and additional Steel typing that grants valuable neutralities that cover Kleavor's weaknesses. Forretress also makes a good pivot thanks to its slow speed and access to Volt Switch.</p> "

Close Combat synergizes well with Kleavor's STAB moves, crushing Steel-types like Iron Treads. U-turn allows Kleavor to pivot out of Great Tusk and Skarmory to bring in teammates like Araquanid or Volcarona. Night Slash banishes Ghost-types like Gholdengo, Knock Off softens walls like Corviknight and Porygon2 for its teammates, and X-Scissor takes down Slowbro to make way for Mega Pinsir. Araquanid and Galvantula are excellent teammates, as these set up Sticky Web to patch up Kleavor's unassuming speed, even when using a Choice Scarf, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Blacephalon. Additionally, they also help in dealing with pesky Fire- and Flying-types like Volcarona and Landorus, respectively. Physical setup sweepers benefit from Kleavor's ability to set hazards offensively, Knock Off items from walls, and deal with Skeledirge and Slowbro, which often wall Mega Pinsir, Scizor, and Mega Scizor. In return, they deal with Fighting- and Fairy-types like Great Tusk and Mega Diancie. Quiver Dance Volcarona appreciates Skeledirge removed, as this lets it clean up Ghost teams at +1; it can also be brought in against passive walls like Slowbro and Skarmory. Forretress provides Rapid Spin and loves Kleavor's ability to set Stealth Rock, as this allows it to run other hazards like Toxic Spikes or Volt Switch to better support the team. Lokix provides great offensive support with its access to priority in First Impression and Sucker Punch to finish off teams weakened by Kleavor through entry hazards and repeated Knock Offs. It is also a secondary check to Skeledirge, which Bug teams appreciate.</p> "

Headlong Rush is generally preferred for its higher power, but Earthquake is another good option that avoids Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet damage and lets Ursaluna leverage its good bulk. Fire Punch hits Corviknight, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Air Balloon Kingambit, which resist Ursaluna's STAB combination. Tera Normal boosts Facade to breathtaking levels, allowing it to cleanly 2HKO physically defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock. Tera Ghost is an alternative that lets Ursaluna avoid being revenge killed by Fighting-type attacks such as Close Combat from Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, or Sneasler. The given EV spread maximizes Ursaluna's damage output while also ensuring it outspeeds Skeledirge and standard Corviknight. On Trick Room teams, Ursaluna should run maximum Attack and HP investment, a Brave nature, and 0 Speed IVs.</p> <p>Ursaluna serves as an exceptionally powerful wallbreaker on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Garchomp is appreciated to make Ursaluna even more difficult to wall. Dual screens support from Dragapult can also be considered, since it will further reinforce Ursaluna's excellent bulk, and Dragapult can even provide free switches through Curse or U-turn. Against slower-paced teams, Ursaluna's great bulk and immunity to status give it many opportunities to switch in and start wreaking havoc, but it can struggle against faster-paced, more aggressive teams. Good partners for Ursaluna that excel against offense include Kingambit, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Zamazenta, which, in return, appreciate Ursaluna breaking through Pokemon such as Dondozo and Corviknight. Ursaluna enjoys U-turn or Volt Switch support from Rotom-W, Landorus-T, or Dragapult, letting it hit the field multiple times to fire off its insanely powerful attacks. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate for Ursaluna, as it can both provide momentum with Chilly Reception and supplement Ursaluna's firepower with Future Sight. Galarian Slowking can also switch into and pressure some of the Pokemon that give Ursaluna trouble, such as Iron Valiant. Trick Room support from Hatterene and Cresselia is an interesting option to turn Ursaluna's low Speed into an advantage.</p> "

Earthquake is preferred over Headlong Rush, because it allows Ursaluna to maintain its remarkable bulk as well as having the added benefit of avoiding Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin damage. Swords Dance can be used to bolster Ursaluna's Attack to incredible heights, giving everything a tough time switching in. Drain Punch can be used to give Ursaluna more longevity, while Fire Punch can be used to hit targets like Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo for super effective damage. Alternatively, Ursaluna can run 140 Speed EVs in order to keep up with other pokemon in its Speed tier, such as Kingambit, and outspeeding slightly faster Pokemon that do not run any Speed investment such as Corviknight and Skeledirge. Max HP is used to maximize Ursaluna's bulk, while the 4 Speed EVs are used to outspeed any uninvested Pokemon of the same Speed tier, such as Iron Hands and Alolan Muk.</p> <p>Ursaluna greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Ting-Lu and Quagsire, as the extra damage could be the difference between a 2HKO and a 1HKO on physically defensive Rotom-W. Ursaluna also appreciates a teammate like Clodsire, which can switch into Water- and Fighting-type attacks from Urshifu-R, Azumarill, and Sneasler, both of which Ursaluna is weak to. Another great teammate for Ursaluna is Landorus-T, which can U-turn and allow Ursaluna to come in freely and launch its extremely powerful attacks. Alternatively, Landorus-I is a fantastic teammate for Ursaluna. Ursaluna is able to deal with the special walls that check Landorus and vice versa. Iron Treads is another great teammate for Ursaluna, as it keeps hazards off the field in order to prevent Ursaluna from taking more damage. Bulkier Pokemon that want to stick around for a long time, such as Ting-Lu, Quagsire, and Clodsire, greatly appreciate Ursaluna's presence, as it can freely switch in to status moves and Knock Off once Flame Orb has activated. Finally, Choice Scarf Great Tusk is another teammate that appreciates Ursaluna. Great Tusk is able to outspeed and OHKO Pokemon that check Ursaluna such as Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Choice Specs Greninja. Once Ursaluna has sufficiently weakened the opposing team, Great Tusk will have an easy time finishing the game with its high speed and powerful attacks.</p> "

Psychic Fangs targets key threats such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, and especially Water Absorb Clodsire while also strengthening Basculegion-M's matchup against screens. Liquidation serves as a viable alternative to Head Smash or Psychic Fangs, as it spares Basculegion-M the recoil damage from Wave Crash, enabling it to consistently inflict damage at the cost of some power. Tera Water boosts its Water-type attacks further; for instance, allowing Basculegion-M to OHKO Kingambit and Greninja with Wave Crash while avoiding the OHKO from the former's Sucker Punch. It also lets Basculegion-M take on other Ghost- and Dark-type attacks in a pinch, including from Pokemon like Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Hisuian Samurott. Basculegion-M seamlessly fits into rain teams, making Pelipper an indispensable partner for setting up rain and facilitating free switches via U-turn. The synergy between Basculegion-M and rain sweepers like Battle Bond Greninja, Zapdos, and Walking Wake is truly remarkable, as they can apply immense pressure and overwhelm their shared checks with their rain-boosted attacks. Zapdos proves invaluable for taking on Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Meowscarada, and Rillaboom as well as Water-types like Dondozo, Tera Water Garganacl, Toxapex, and Azumarill. It also grants Basculegion-M switches with Volt Switch and U-turn against Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Heatran, which get devastated by Wave Crash. Entry hazard support from teammates such as Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Iron Treads significantly augments Basculegion-M's ability to dismantle defensive threats like Galarian Slowking, Tera Fairy Garganacl, and Amoonguss. In return, Basculegion-M serves as a proficient spinblocker, threatening opponents like Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Ting-Lu in particular stands out as an exceptional partner, capable of taking hits from Electric-types such as Zapdos and Sandy Shocks and Ghost-types like Dragapult and Gholdengo. Kingambit similarly excels at soaking up Ghost-type attacks while benefiting immensely from Basculegion-M's wallbreaking and ability to exploit Great Tusk, which can enable Kingambit to sweep late-game.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Swift Swim in conjunction with powerful STAB Wave Crash backed by a high HP stat to offset recoil makes Basculegion-M a premier rain wallbreaker in the tier. Choice Band is the preferred item for more power so long as it has pivots to fall back on, such as Pelipper, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos. Tera Water is the premier Tera option to pump as much power into Wave Crash as possible, allowing it to 2HKO even Water-resistant foes such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn. Tera Water also removes its weakness to Sucker Punch from the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Mega Mawile, and it maintains its resistance to Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, although it removes its immunity to Fake Out from Mega Medicham. This also leaves Basculegion-M susceptible to Wave Crash's heavy recoil damage, so Liquidation is used to mitigate this, and it should be used once Basculegion-M’s checks have been worn down in order to ensure that it does not KO itself with recoil. Basculegion-M thus benefits from an offensive partner like Mega Swampert, which can finish off threats weakened by Basculegion-M. Pelipper is necessary to set up rain for Basculegion-M and also serves as a pivot to give it a free switch, something Basculegion-M has trouble doing, as it prefers to preserve its HP for recoil. Other pivots like Eject Button Ferrothorn and Tornadus-T are also helpful to support Basculegion-M by giving a point of entry to start breaking.</p> "

Its access to Swift Swim as well as strong STAB options in Surf and Shadow Ball allows it to be immensely threatening once it's brought in, and its ability to hit hard on the special side allows it to pick up 2HKOs on many common Water resistances in the tier such as Rotom-W or Toxapex. Swift Swim is a fantastic ability for Basculegion-F, as it allows the capability to run a Modest nature over Timid, boosting Basculegion-F's breaking capabilities even further. A Speed-boosting nature is unnecessary due to hitting a whopping 510 Speed in rain, outrunning almost every Pokemon in the tier except for Choice Scarf Kartana and Iron Valiant in Electric Terrain. Surf is a great option as a reliable STAB move, because its above-average Base Power and perfect accuracy allow it to be spammed with little to no drawback, while Hydro Pump is a great option for the raw power, 2HKOing Tera Grass Heatran with minimal chip damage and OHKOing Mega Charizard Y in sun. Both of these moves are perfectly complemented by Basculegion-F's secondary STAB option, Shadow Ball, which provides neutral coverage against a majority of the metagame. Very few Pokemon can resist Basculegion-F's STAB combination, which is even further bolstered by Ice Beam as a coverage option. Ice Beam allows Basculegion-F to deal serious damage to Pokemon like Tera Grass Heatran and Dragonite. Basculegion-F is also a phenomenal Terastallization user, as it's able to use Tera Water to both shed its weakness to Kingambit's Sucker Punch and boost Surf to terrifying levels of power, making it capable of sweeping most teams with little to no chip damage. Basculegion-F pairs extremely well with Pelipper, since it's able to set rain and use U-turn to bring Basculegion-F in safely. It also appreciates support from the likes of Ferrothorn and Zapdos, as Ferrothorn can answer Iron Valiant's Moonblast and spread chip damage very effectively with Iron Barbs, and Zapdos can check Choice Scarf Kartana and Rillaboom defensively and threaten crippling paralyses. In turn, Basculegion-F supports them back by KOing Pokemon that'd normally be able to force them out or pivot around utilizing resistances and immunities. For example, it can bait Leaf Blade from Kartana to guarantee a safe switch into Zapdos or it can lure Grassy Glide from Rillaboom, allowing Ferrothorn to come in and start spreading chip damage.</p> "

Dire Claw can ease setup or secure a sweep by inflicting checks such as Landorus-T, Skeledirge, and Toxapex with sleep or paralysis in a pinch. On the other hand, Gunk Shot is far more powerful, OHKOing Zapdos and Amoonguss after Swords Dance while avoiding the former's Static. Tera Blast Ground allows Sneasler to hit Skeledirge and OHKO Toxapex, defensive Gholdengo, and Galarian Slowking after Swords Dance. Acrobatics, alongside Tera Flying, allows Sneasler to OHKO Great Tusk after Swords Dance and gives it setup opportunities against other Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Iron Treads. Shadow Claw and Night Slash both retain huge damage on Gholdengo in particular and make Sneasler less reliant on Terastallizing to hit it. The choice between the two largely comes down to Tera type; Tera Ghost grants Sneasler an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Great Tusk's Rapid Spin, while Tera Dark makes it immune to Future Sight and retains its Sucker Punch resistance after Terastallizing. Tera Dark Night Slash is also Sneasler's best chance at breaking through Tera Ghost Garganacl. An Air Balloon lets Sneasler set up freely against Ground-types such as defensive Great Tusk and Ting-Lu lacking Whirlwind. White Herb is an alternative that allows Sneasler to activate Unburden itself by using Close Combat instead of being reliant on taking a hit and popping Air Balloon to sweep.</p> <p>Sneasler is at home on hyper offense teams that can wear down opposing defensive cores for it to sweep late-game. Grimmsnarl and Dragapult are excellent teammates for their ability to set dual screens, which ease Sneasler's setup tremendously, especially if it is running Air Balloon and needs to take a hit in order to sweep. Glimmora and Hisuian Samurott are excellent leads that can provide valuable entry hazard support; Hisuian Samurott in particular can threaten many of Sneasler's checks, such as Great Tusk, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo. Other setup sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Cresselia are good partners that can break through defensive cores for Sneasler or end games if it falls short of a sweep. Zamazenta is particularly valuable in this role, as it benefits immensely from Sneasler's ability to lure and break through shared checks such as Toxapex, Gholdengo, and Zapdos.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Sneasler is a fast offensive pivot that is hard to switch into due to its ability to inflict status with Poison Touch. Dire Claw having no downsides thanks to Protective Pads allows Sneasler to spam it, making it hard to switch into for fear of potential status. Fake Out + U-turn can heavily chip down a foe. Fake Out can also be used for revenge killing foes such as Iron Valiant, Greninja, and Meowscarada. It also completely shuts down Focus Sash leads like Hisuian Samurott, which can be KOed by Fake Out + Close Combat before it can set up Spikes. Shadow Claw or Night Slash can be run over Fake Out, allowing Sneasler to hit checks like Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking, but that would limit Sneasler's ability to disrupt opposing teams with Fake Out and U-turn's poison chances and revenge kill faster targets like Booster Energy Iron Valiant. Sneasler takes advantage of its Protective Pads, allowing it to attack freely without any adverse side effects, preventing status or chip damage from Zapdos, Moltres, Garchomp, and miscellaneous Rocky Helmet users like Corviknight and Landorus-T. Tera Fighting is used for maximum Close Combat damage, letting it 2HKO even Corviknight. Sneasler works well on hazard-stacking teams that appreciate it spreading status and forcing switches, racking up even more damage. Sneasler struggles against Amoonguss, Toxapex, Galarian Slowking, and Dragapult, so good teammates to cover these would be Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Ting-Lu. Kingambit greatly appreciates the chip damage and status Sneasler provides, which helps it grab those OHKOs that it normally couldn't, and it can consistently switch into Dragapult and Galarian Slowking to set up on them. Ting-Lu is able to wall Dragapult and Galarian Slowking with its typing and enormous bulk while being able to set up hazards for further chip. Garganacl is another example of a bulky partner, as its Stealth Rock and Salt Cure damage pair well with Sneasler's status and chip damage.</p> "

A strong offensive STAB combination of Close Combat and Dire Claw allows Sneasler to threaten bulky Pokemon such as Garganacl, Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Hatterene. Dire Claw is noteworthy, as it has a good chance to cripple its checks such as Landorus-T and Galarian Slowking with status. U-turn not only allows Sneasler to pivot out of its checks, but it can also poison foes with Poison Touch, allowing its teammates to get easier KOs. Shadow Claw or Night Slash allows Sneasler to deal great damage to Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Galarian Slowking. Tera Fighting further boosts Close Combat's power, allowing it to guarantee 2HKOs against walls it would normally struggle with such as defensive Great Tusk and Dondozo. Sneasler is best utilized on offensive teams, where it can use its wallbreaking abilities to enable sweeps from its teammates. In addition, sweepers and cleaners such as Dragonite, Choice Scarf Enamorus, Swords Dance Iron Valiant, and Kingambit all appreciate Sneasler wearing down their checks with poison or crippling them with paralysis or sleep to give its teammates setup opportunities. Entry hazard support from the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T are appreciated, as their hazards wear down incoming foes for Sneasler to wallbreak more easily. For example, Sneasler can OHKO offensive Volcanion and fully defensive Enamorus-T with Close Combat and Dire Claw, respectively, after Stealth Rock damage. Sneasler struggles to break through certain defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Toxapex. Hence, it appreciates Pokemon that can wear them down such as Bulk Up or Ice Spinner Great Tusk and Choice Specs Walking Wake, respectively. Lastly, Sneasler doesn't want to attack Zapdos or Moltres in fear of triggering Static and Flame Body, respectively. Therefore, it appreciates teammates that can offensively check them such as Choice Specs Dragapult.</p> "

This impressive Speed tier in combination with a high Attack stat and great choices for STAB moves in Close Combat and Dire Claw make Sneasler an effective revenge killer. Sneasler is very good at spreading status via the combination of Poison Touch, Dire Claw, and U-turn, enabling it to wear down its own checks that are vulnerable to poison, like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Zapdos, and Skeledirge. Switcheroo hinders defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Dondozo, and especially Poison-types that are both unbothered by Sneasler's STAB attacks and immune to poison, such as Galarian Slowking, Amoonguss, and Toxapex. It also frees up Sneasler to change moves, which is desirable in matchups against defensive teams where Sneasler is already fast enough without its Choice Scarf. Shadow Claw and Night Slash fulfil the same role, being used as Sneasler's best option to hit Dragapult, Galarian Slowking, and Gholdengo. Shadow Claw has better neutral coverage, as it isn't resisted by Fairy-types and Fighting-types like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Zamazenta; however, there is nothing immune to Night Slash, making it slightly better at spreading status through Poison Touch. Tera Fighting's boost to Close Combat can help Sneasler sweep late-game while also specifically achieving an OHKO on offensive Cinderace as well as a 2HKO on offensive Great Tusk.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Sneasler performs best on offensive teams that benefit from its ability to revenge kill a plethora of threats. Sneasler's ability to spread status on the likes of Great Tusk, Zapdos, and Landorus-T can be very beneficial to Pokemon that share these checks, like Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk itself. It is able to support these Pokemon further by presenting them with opportunities to switch in via U-turn. This can be even further leveraged by pairing Sneasler with other U-turn and Volt Switch users like Cinderace and Zapdos. Spikes and Stealth Rock from the likes of Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott helps to soften up Sneasler's checks for it to potentially sweep late-game. Ting-Lu additionally is able to switch in on Ghost-types that cause Sneasler trouble like Dragapult and Gholdengo. Defensive Poison-types like Galarian Slowking and Amoonguss are a thorn in Sneasler's side, as they cannot be poisoned and take little damage from Sneasler's STAB attacks. Pokemon able to exploit them like Gholdengo and Heatran are necessary, and they greatly appreciate being brought into these threats by U-turn to boot.</p> "

Choice Scarf allows Sneasler to outspeed Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Regieleki, and opposing Choice Scarf threats like Hisuian Samurott, Enamorus, Iron Treads, Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon and Cinderace. Dire Claw paired with Sneasler's ability Poison Touch gives it a 41.67% chance to inflict poison upon foes, which helps to gradually wear down walls like Ting-Lu and Quagsire, along with a 23.33% chance to inflict paralysis or sleep, disrupting the threat that opposing sweepers pose to the team. While Steel-types are immune to Sneasler's Dire Claw, it can still threaten some of them such as Heatran and Iron Treads with Close Combat. Paired with Switcheroo, it is able to deny opposing walls like Toxapex and Corviknight recovery by passing them the Choice Scarf and forcing them to lock into one move. With the threat of Switcheroo, it also reduces the threat of Pokemon like Dragon Dance Dragonite.</p> <p>Sneasler pairs well with Amoonguss, which threatens to use Spore against foes and threatens walls like Quagsire and Gastrodon with Giga Drain, along with offensive Pokemon like Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Although Amoonguss can act as a switch-in to Landorus-T, it gets completely countered by its Substitute + Bulk Up set. In addition to that, Amoonguss can use Foul Play to dissuade Ghost-type wallbreakers like Dragapult and Mimikyu from setting up with Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, respectively. Galarian Slowking also synergizes incredibly well with Sneasler, as they form a pivoting core with U-turn and Chilly Reception. Galarian Slowking appreciates Sneasler breaking through Steel-types and spreading status, and Galarian Slowking can support Sneasler by threatening opposing Poison-types with Future Sight, switching in on Gholdengo and threatening it with Flamethrower, and tanking one Earth Power from Landorus and OHKOing it with Ice Beam if Galarian Slowking is running Assault Vest. Toxapex can set up Toxic Spikes for Sneasler to clean easily while the opposing team takes residual damage. It also forms a Regenerator core with Amoonguss and Galarian Slowking and aids Alolan Muk against setup with Haze, thus synergizing well with the momentum provided by Sneasler's U-turn. Alolan Muk is also a great partner for Sneasler, as it provides an immunity to Psychic-type attacks and boasts great special bulk, which allows it to tank attacks from Choice Specs Dragapult and Spectrier and threaten them with Knock Off. Glimmora can set Stealth Rock to support Sneasler's cleaning capability and spin away entry hazards to prevent Sneasler from being worn down, as well as threatening slow Great Tusk with Energy Ball and being a Ground-immune Pokemon that Sneasler can pivot into with Air Balloon. Iron Moth and Salazzle greatly benefit from Choice Scarf Sneasler beating threats like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao, allowing them to take out foes like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Klefki, which Sneasler can't break. Salazzle and Glimmora also form a Corrosion core, which helps in the Poison mirror matchup, which Sneasler struggles with. Clodsire is a great teammate to absorb attacks from Iron Valiant, Greninja, and Skeledirge.</p> "

Close Combat is a strong nuke against many of the tier's common Dark- and Steel-types like Hydreigon, Kingambit, and Heatran along with other notable Fighting-weak threats such as Baxcalibur, Ursaluna and Hisuian Arcanine. Dire Claw's incredible chance to inflect status allows it to not only slash through prominent Fairy-types like Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Hatterene but also to make progress in matchups where its traits aren't as valuable like Ghost by inflicting crippling statuses on targets like Hisuian Zoroark and Skeledirge. Fake Out can chip threats down and rack up poison damage or fish for poison before using U-turn to leave, while Taunt takes advantage of Sneasler's incredible speed can stop the dangerous status effects from Salazzle and Amoonguss or recovery moves from Toxapex and Corviknight on Flying teams.</p> <p>Thanks to U-turn, Sneasler can bring in teammates such as specially defensive Alolan Muk or physically defensive Amoonguss to handle would-be answers.

Any other physical threat that can threaten Sneasler like Kleavor, Hisuian Arcanine, or Swords Dance Mimikyu can be dealt with by physically bulky Rocky Helmet Toxapex thanks to Infestation trapping and Haze to deal with boosts. Galarian Slowking's incredible special bulk can allow it to sponge hits for Sneasler from powerful special attackers such as Zapdos, Articuno, and Moltres and then safely pivot back into Sneasler with Chilly Reception; it can also use Future Sight combined with Sneasler's incredible Fighting STAB move to deal immense damage to any foe wishing to tank the hits for its team.

Salazzle can also spread Toxic against these threats and use Encore to punish setup from Hisuian Goodra and Kingambit. Choice Scarf Gengar helps majorly against Ghost-types that can outspeed Sneasler like Spectrier, Dragapult. and Flutter Mane while Choice Specs with Icy Wind can remove high profile threats like Garchomp and both formes of Landorus, with both Choice sets having powerful coverage in Thunderbolt to shock Flying-Types such as Moltres, Corviknight, and Pelipper.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Sneasler is a deadly sweeper with its high Attack stat in conjunction with Swords Dance and Unburden. Dire Claw is generally preferred over Gunk Shot for its perfect accuracy and a high chance to cripple the target with status. However, Gunk Shot has considerably more power, allowing Sneasler to OHKO most Zapdos at +2. Acrobatics is Sneasler's most spammable attack, especially if it has Terastallized, as it hits many neutral targets such as Tornadus, Dragapult, and Toxapex for high damage. Sneasler should be brought out when the Terrain matching its item is active, consuming its item and boosting Acrobatics. Alternatively, Tera Ground with Tera Blast can be used to deal massive damage to Gholdengo, Toxapex, and Skeledirge. An Electric Seed or Psychic Seed is recommended to instantly activate Unburden, and the boost to Sneasler's otherwise poor defenses may also facilitate setup. Tera Flying turns Sneasler's Ground weakness into an immunity, which often buys it a turn to set up. Tera Flying also grants STAB on Acrobatics, allowing Sneasler to OHKO Dragapult and physically defensive Great Tusk with Acrobatics after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Sneasler serves as an excellent late-game cleaner on hyper offense teams. Entry hazard setters such as Mega Diancie or Landorus-T are useful teammates to help wear down Snealser's checks, such as Toxapex and opposing Landorus-T, into KO range for its attacks. Given Sneasler's item, a Terrain-setting partner such as Tapu Koko or Tapu Lele is mandatory. Tapu Koko provides entry opporunities with Volt Switch and U-turn while also setting Reflect and Light Screen, which facilitates setup. Tapu Lele pressures Toxapex, and its Psychic Terrain blocks priority attacks such as Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, Fake Out from Mega Lopunny, and Sucker Punch from Kingambit, all of which can otherwise pick off a weakened Sneasler. However, one should be aware that Psychic Terrain will no longer block priority moves against a Tera Flying Snealser that has Terastallized. Other offensive partners that synergize well with Sneasler include Kingambit, Dragonite, and Volcarona, all of which can either assist in breaking through Sneasler's checks, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, or Toxapex, or finish off a team weakened by Sneasler.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Sneasler can use its combination of high Attack and Speed to function as a potent pivot, racking up chip damage against defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Zapdos, Great Tusk, and other tanks. Its ability, Poison Touch, alongside Dire Claw allows it to spread status and cripple its checks, mainly to enable Hex Dragapult and hit would-be checks like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Clefable for massive damage. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Sneasler to ignore Stealth Rock and Spikes to continue switching in and retain its offensive presence throughout the game. However, Sneasler is also hindered by contact punishment from the likes of Ferrothorn, defensive Landorus-T and Garchomp, and Zapdos, so Protective Pads helps provide more longevity. U-turn allows Sneasler to function as a pivot, bringing in other offensive threats such as Dragapult along with other special attackers like Tapu Lele to take advantage of physical tanks that can wall Sneasler such as Toxapex, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. U-turn also allows it to easily spread poison with Poison Touch. Fire Punch allows Sneasler to hit Gholdengo, which is immune to its STAB combination, and also dent Mega Scizor. Night Slash could be considered as an alternative to hit Dragapult switching in while also still hitting Gholdengo. Fake Out is another possibility to allow Sneasler to safely poison faster threats. However, Sneasler is easily checked by faster Pokemon that can threaten to revenge kill it such as offensive Tornadus-T, Choice Scarf users such as Urshifu-R or Landorus-T, and powerful priority users like Extreme Killer Dragonite. As such, Sneasler benefits from having a sturdy defensive backbone with Pokemon like Toxapex or Ferrothorn to tank hits that Sneasler dislikes. Sneasler also forces a lot of switches, so it benefits from allies that can set hazards like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, or Heatran, which also switch in on Flying- and Psychic-type moves for Sneasler. Sneasler also has a tendency to be completely walled by the likes of Toxapex, Gliscor, and Landorus-T and benefits greatly from having allies that it can pivot to in order to exploit these checks for damage, like Tapu Lele or Zapdos.</p> "

Close Combat and Dire Claw have near-perfect synergy, aside from Dire Claw's ability to punish passive answers—like Toxapex and Slowbro—that swap into its STAB moves. U-turn pivots Sneasler out of switch-ins such as Skeledirge, Aegislash, and Gliscor, bringing in Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Mega Gallade. Switcheroo further punishes walls like Corviknight if the extra speed is unneeded. Alternatively, Rock Slide lets it revenge kill Quiver Dance Volcarona, freeing up a moveslot on Iron Hands, while Toxic Spikes greatly pressure Fairy teams wary of Dire Claw. Night Slash can also be the final move for Sneasler, as it notably hits Gholdengo and Aegislash, but pivoting out of these threats is usually the better option. Choice Scarf Sneasler is a late-game cleaner, so wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as the aforementioned Kommo-o and Mega Gallade are appreciated, as these deal with Corviknight, Gliscor, and Toxapex. Kommo-o also benefits from Sneasler dealing with Fairy-types, as this allows Kommo-o to use Clangorous Soulblaze. Choice Specs Iron Valiant loves being pivoted in safely against physical walls like Skeledirge and Mega Sableye, which wall Sneasler. Assault Vest Iron Hands is a soft check against Gholdengo and Volcarona and can pivot Sneasler in against walls, which it can inconvenience. Hisuian Lilligant and Breloom deal with Gastrodon and Quagsire and also ease the Water and Ground matchups. As with the other setup sweepers, these also love the setup opportunities Sneasler opens up by being able to punish walls with Dire Claw's additional effects or with Switcheroo. Entry hazard support from Cobalion and Great Tusk is also appreciated, and these provide a secondary answer to Mimikyu and Zeraora, respectively. These teammates also appreciate Sneasler's ability to remove Toxic Spikes, greatly easing the matchup against Water and Poison teams.</p> "

These attributes are further bolstered by Enamorus's solid Speed tier, outspeeding the likes of Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Hydreigon. Earth Power synergizes amazingly well with Moonblast, hitting Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Heatran. It also targets the likes of Galarian Slowking, Iron Moth, Toxapex, and Volcanion. Mystical Fire hits Pokemon like Air Balloon Gholdengo and Corviknight that would otherwise resist Moonblast and be immune to Earth Power while outright OHKOing Scizor. Psychic operates as a middle ground between Earth Power and Mystical Fire against most Poison-types, having a chance to OHKO Amoonguss after Stealth Rock and catching Tera Poison Cresselia off-guard. It is also Enamorus's strongest attack against Moltres. Tera Fairy boosts Enamous's Moonblast to absolutely horrifying levels, 2HKOing even Pokemon that resist Fairy like Gholdengo, bulky Cinderace, and Scizor. Tera Ground turns Enamorus's weaknesses to Rock and Electric into a resistance and immunity, making it less threatened by Stealth Rock damage and letting it find opportunities to switch in against the likes of Zapdos and Sandy Shocks. It also boosts Earth Power, letting it OHKO Garganacl and Toxapex. Tera Steel bolsters Enamorus's defensive profile, making it less vulnerable to Poison-types like Galarian Slowking, Amoonguss, and Toxapex while also preventing it being revenge killed by moves like Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Choice Specs Enamorus is a solid pick on hyper offense and bulky offense teams as a monstrous wallbreaker, tearing apart common bulky Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dondozo, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard support from the likes of Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Heatran help ease prediction for Enamorus, chipping Pokemon like Air Balloon Gholdengo, Amoonguss, and Scizor that could otherwise play around it. Hazard control from the likes of Great Tusk, Hatterene, and Corviknight is essential for giving Enamorus more opportunities to switch in. Late-game cleaners and sweepers such as Kingambit, Swords Dance Sneasler, Battle Bond Greninja, and Calm Mind Cresselia appreciate Enamorus breaking through and overwhelming Pokemon like Ting-Lu, bulky Gholdengo, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, enabling them to clean in the late-game. Enamorus's ability to break through the likes of Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Garganacl means that physical attackers like Kingambit, Dragonite, and Cinderace make for excellent partners, as in return, they can threaten Pokemon like Amoonguss and Scizor. Offensive pivots like Dragapult and Cinderace create offensive momentum for Enamorus to capitalize off of, baiting Dark- and Ground-type moves that Enamorus can safely switch into. Slower pivots like Galarian Slowking and Rotom-W can let Enamorus switch in without taking any damage, further boosting momentum.</p> "

Earth Power lets Enamorus threaten Pokemon that resist Moonblast such as Galarian Slowking, Cinderace, Toxapex, Iron Moth, Heatran, and Clodsire. Enamorus can complement its coverage with Mystical Fire, which allows it to hit Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo. Substitute is another option that lets Enamorus take advantage of the switches it forces and thus find more room to set up. Substitute also protects it from status conditions such as Amoonguss's Spore and Toxapex and Clodsire's Toxic. Agility is another alternative that lets Enamorus outspeed and thus threaten fast offensive Pokemon that would otherwise try to revenge kill it such as Cinderace, Zamazenta, and Dragapult. Timid is the preferred nature, as it lets Enamorus outspeed the likes of Zapdos, Sandy Shocks, and Garchomp, while Modest is usually seen alongside Agility. Heavy-Duty Boots removes Enamorus's weakness to Stealth Rock, letting it come into the field safely throughout the game. Leftovers grants Enamorus recovery and is usually used with Substitute to slowly heal and potentially set up more Substitutes. Life Orb is a more offensive option that increases Enamorus's damage output, letting it secure OHKOs against Choice Band Hoopa-U and even neutral targets such as Zapdos after one Calm Mind. Cute Charm is used over Contrary, as the latter conflicts with Calm Mind, and the former can potentially infatuate opposing male Pokemon, granting Enamorus free turns to set up. Tera Fairy makes Enamorus's Moonblast nearly unwallable, as even resistances such as Corviknight are potentially 2HKOed after one Calm Mind. Tera Ground, on the other hand, boosts Enamorus's Earth Power and turns its weakness to Poison into a resistance, which lets it deny revenge killing attempts from Sneasler and Iron Moth and turns soft checks such as Galarian Slowking into setup fodder. Tera Steel is yet another alternative that improves Enamorus's matchup against Poison-types, particularly Amoonguss, and lets it deny revenge killing attempts from Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Enamorus fits better on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Entry hazard setters that fit on these playstyles, such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Hisuian Samurott, can slowly chip at the opposing team, making it easier for Enamorus to clean up late-game. Enamorus, in turn, denies opportunities for opposing Great Tusk to come in and remove the hazards away with Rapid Spin thanks to its higher Speed and resistance to both of Great Tusk's STAB moves. Its good matchup against Great Tusk, as well as Zamazenta and Dondozo, makes Enamorus a great Kingambit teammate, as it can cover Kingambit's would-be checks. Kingambit, in return, can help against Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking, which can be troublesome for Enamorus. Choice Specs Dragapult can weaken soft checks that can shrug off one of its or Enamorus's hits, such as Rotom-W, Zapdos, Ursaluna, and Azumarill, and appreciates Enamorus's ability to switch into Dark-type attacks from Hisuian Samurott and Hoopa-U and threaten them back.</p> "

Mystical Fire allows Enarmous to 2HKO Air Balloon Gholdengo, which otherwise walls it, and also has a good chance to 2HKO Amoonguss with Stealth Rock support.

Tera Ground boosts Earth Power, guaranteeing OHKOs against Kingambit and Volcanion as well as 2HKOing physically defensive variants of both Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, while Tera Steel grants Enamorus many resistances including Fairy and Ice; both also reduce its weakness to Stealth Rock at the cost of taking Spikes damage. Contrary is Enamorus's preferred ability, helping it against Mystical Fire, Parting Shot, and, if Terastallized, Sticky Webs.</p> <p>Enamorus serves as a great late-game cleaner on various offense teams. It appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Heatran, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T, so Enamorus can have an easier time to sweep against weakened foes. The three of them can also wallbreak for Enamorus, with Heatran being able to 2HKO both Corviknight and Amoonguss, comma while Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T can both threaten Galarian Slowking. Teammates like Cinderace and Great Tusk that can remove Stealth Rock make valuable partners. Enamorus dislikes special walls that can hinder it like Dondozo, Assault Vest Toxapex, Cresselia, and Slowking. Hence, teammates that can break down bulkier teams like offensive Zapdos and Kingambit make for good teammates. Zapdos can 2HKO both Toxapex and Dondozo with Thunderbolt, and Kingambit can threaten both Cresselia and Slowking. Kingambit and Enamorus can also both facilitate sweeps for the other, with Kingambit beating Galarian Slowking for Enamorus and Enamorus being able to beat Zamazenta and Great Tusk for Kingambit. Enamorus also pairs well with slower yet bulky wallbreakers such as Ursaluna to deal with offense teams, and in return, Enamorus can provide them Healing Wish support. Lastly, Gholdengo makes for another great partner, as it can switch into Sneasler that can otherwise threaten Enamorus, switch into anticipated status such as Thunder Wave, and also keep hazards onfield placed by Enamorus's teammates.</p> "

Superpower hits Steel-types like Kingambit, Hisuian Goodra, and Air Balloon Heatran, allowing Enamorus to snowball Steel teams with Contrary once Gholdengo has been removed. Alternatively, Mystical Fire hits Air Balloon Gholdengo and Corviknight. Earth Power hits Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, further improving the Steel and Poison matchups.

Furthermore, Bulk Up Landorus-T is a massive asset in the Poison and Steel matchups, notably setting up on Amoonguss and forcing Heatran out. Dragonite is fearsome in the Water and Flying mirror matchups and heavily appreciates Healing Wish support in return. Moltres is a great check to Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Gholdengo due to its excellent bulk and ability to burn the former two. Articuno's exemplary bulk and neutrality to Ice-type moves is heavily appreciated, allowing it to check Greninja and Basculegion-F with Freeze-Dry to further improve the Water matchup Zapdos spreads paralysis via Static and Discharge as well as aiding in the Water matchup.

Aside from coverage to hit Steel-types in Mystical Fire and Earth Power, Healing Wish can bring back a weakened teammate in a pinch, potentially being able to change the tide of a game. Therefore, Enamorus fits best on offense teams that appreciate its utility in Healing Wish while providing a positive matchup against opposing offensive teams. Powerful wallbreakers such as Baxcalibur and Volcarona appreciate Enamorus's Healing Wish, giving them a second lease on life, while Enamorus in turn capitalizes on them weakening the likes of Toxapex and Mega Scizor to clean late-game. Enamorus also greatly enjoys entry hazard removal support from Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, or Great Tusk, as it minimalizes its Stealth Rock weakness so it can switch in more effectively mid-game. Enamorus struggles with special wall such as Clodsire and Gholdengo, so Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk make for good partners that can take advantage of them.</p> "

What Draining Kiss may lack in power, it makes up for with its ability to keep Enamorus-T healthy, which is critical, since this set is focused on longevity over raw damage. Earth Power pairs exceedingly well with it, giving Enamorus-T impressive coverage that is resisted by only a few Pokemon while hitting threats like Gholdengo and Heatran super effectively. Leftovers help keep Enamorus-T healthy while it racks up boosts, but Heavy-Duty Boosts keeps it safe from Stealth Rock, which poses to cut away a significant amount of HP once Enamorus-T switches in. Grassy Seed can also be run if Enamorus-T is paired with Rillaboom, as the instant Defense boost can aid it greatly in setting up. Terastallization aids Enamorus-T's ability to set up by mixing up its defensive profile;Tera Steel allows it to deal with Poison- and Steel-types, giving it a chance to take Dire Claw from Sneasler and Iron Head from Kingambit, respectively. It also removes its weakness to Electric, giving it a better matchup against Zapdos. In addition, with Overcoat, Tera Steel makes Enamorus-T a very capable Amoonguss switch-in, letting it use it as setup fodder for a potential sweep. Tera Water maintains the resistance to Steel while also giving it a resistance to Ice, which is crucial for avoiding being picked off by Baxcalibur, and can turn Enamorus-T into a useful Walking Wake check in a pinch. The EV spread is designed to keep Enamorus-T as bulky as possible while still allowing it to outspeed uninvested Kingambit, Azumarill, and Ursaluna.</p> <p>Enamorus-T fits best on bulky offensive teams that allow it to sweep late-game once its checks have been whittled down or removed. Therefore, offensive wallbreakers like Sneasler and Iron Valiant serve as good teammates for it. The latter in particular is good at wearing down Moltres and Corviknight, two common Pokemon that resist both of Enamorus-T's attacks. Offensive hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott also help by wearing down the opponent's team. If Enamorus-T is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, then hazard removal is a necessity, so Pokemon like Great Tusk and Cinderace are further appreciated.</p> "

Moreover, its immunity to Prankster Taunt from Grimmsnarl, another common lead, lets Meowscarada get the leg up against opposing offensive teams. Taunt in conjunction with its insane Speed tier allows Meowscarada to shut down opposing entry hazard setters and removers like Garchomp, Glimmora, Iron Moth, and Corviknight, annoy defensive Pokemon like Clodsire and Toxapex, and prevent foes such as Kingambit and Dragonite from using it as setup fodder. Aside from threatening Grass-resistant Pokemon like Dragapult, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo, Knock Off's utility allows Meowscarada to soften up and cripple defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Toxapex, and it works well with Spikes by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Scizor. Even with Meowscarada's middling Special Attack, Leaf Storm boosted by Overgrow can cleanly OHKO defensive Great Tusk, one of the metagame's most common entry hazard removers. Focus Sash guarantees that Meowscarada can set at least one layer of Spikes and safely puts Meowscarada into Overgrow range. Tera Ghost can be used in a pinch to spinblock Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Torkoal.</p> <p>Meowscarada excels at setting up the tempo for hyper offense teams. Offensive Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp and Great Tusk can stack entry hazards to put even more pressure on the opposing team, with mixed Garchomp threatening Corviknight from using Defog; in return, Meowscarada's Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Dragonite, Zapdos, and Moltres to make them susceptible to Stealth Rock. By stacking entry hazards, Gholdengo becomes a near-mandatory teammate to prevent every attempt of hazard removal; Gholdengo also takes advantage of entry hazards itself to pressure checks like Toxapex and Clodsire, which makes Nasty Plot variants particularly difficult to deal with. Setup sweepers commonly found on hyper offense teams such as Dragonite, Kingambit, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth appreciate Spikes chipping down Pokemon like Dondozo, Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Clodsire. Furthermore, they enjoy Meowscarada crippling defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Amoonguss with Knock Off, with Dragonite and Kingambit in particular also appreciating Meowscarada luring in and dealing with Great Tusk.</p> "

Knock Off's high power and item removal make it an excellent move for making progress against foes such as Dragonite, Corviknight, and Toxapex. Flower Trick hits common Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Rotom-W for super effective damage, and its ability to always score a critical hit is very helpful against Defense-boosting foes like Garganacl. Aside from pivoting, U-turn gives super effective coverage against Hydreigon and Roaring Moon, which resist the combination of Knock Off and Flower Trick. Finally, Sucker Punch is a great option to pick off weakened faster foes such as Dragapult, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and Speed Booster Energy users such as Iron Moth. Alternatively, Taunt is great for shutting down support Pokemon such as Toxapex, Tera Fairy Garganacl, and Scream Tail. Tera Dark allows Meowscarada to always OHKO Gholdengo with Knock Off and gives it a chance to OHKO it with Sucker Punch. Tera Grass allows Meowscarada's Flower Trick to always 2HKO Garganacl and gives it a chance to OHKO offensive Great Tusk.</p> <p>Pivot Meowscarada fits on a variety of offensive and balance teams looking for a flexible Pokemon that can both exert pressure on the opponent and grab momentum. Since Meowscarada forces a lot of switches and is adept at wearing down foes with U-turn, entry hazard support from the likes of Great Tusk, Glimmora, and Ting-Lu is greatly appreciated. Meowscarada's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots through Knock Off makes it excellent for accentuating hazard damage. Gholdengo is a good partner, as it helps keep entry hazards on the field and can threaten Pokemon that force Meowscarada out, such as Breloom and Amoonguss. In return, Meowscarada threatens Ting-Lu and weakened Greak Tusk, which Gholdengo greatly appreciates. Meowscarada's U-turn support pairs well with powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Dragapult by giving them free entry onto the field. Meowscarada's Knock Off also cripples Corviknight for these two Pokemon. In return, these wallbreakers threaten Pokemon that Meowscarada lures in, such as Amoonguss and Dragonite. Late-game cleaners such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Kingambit are great partners that can help finish off a team that Meowscarada has worn down. All of the aforementioned offensive teammates appreciate Meowscarada pressuring their checks like Dondozo, Garganacl, and Rotom-W.</p> "

Knock Off will generally be Meowscarada's most used move due to its high power and ability to force progress through item removal, crippling checks like Corviknight and Amoonguss. Flower Trick is Meowscarada's strongest attack, and its ability to always land a critical hit is very useful against foes that boost Defense, such as Dondozo, Curse Garganacl, and Bulk Up Great Tusk. With a Choice Band, Meowscarada has a good chance to OHKO offensive Great Tusk with Flower Trick. U-turn is great for grabbing momentum against Pokemon Meowscarada threatens out, such as Ting-Lu and Rotom-W, and provides super effective coverage against Hydreigon and Roaring Moon. Sucker Punch lets Meowscarada snipe faster foes such as Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Alternatively, Play Rough is an option that lets Meowscarada do great damage to Dragonite, which otherwise takes little from Meowscarada's attacks. Thunder Punch is a niche option to hit Corviknight and Tera Flying Pokemon like Kingambit and Gholdengo super effectively. Low Kick may also potentially be used to OHKO Kingambit. Both Tera Dark and Tera Grass are good options to boost the power of Meowscarada's STAB moves to enormous levels; for example, Tera Grass enables Meowscarada to OHKO Clodsire most of the time, while Tera Dark Knock Off easily OHKOes standard bulky Cinderace. Tera Fairy is a niche option that boosts the power of Play Rough and can help Meowscarada avoid being revenge killed by priority such as Mach Punch from Breloom, allowing it to OHKO it in return.</p> <p>Choice Band Meowscarada's unique blend of speed and power lets it act as both a wallbreaker and pivot on offensive teams. In particular, Meowscarada's U-turn support couples well with powerful but frail wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark by giving them free entry onto the battlefield. Hisuian Zoroark can also take advantage of Illusion and its immunity-laden typing to disguise itself as Meowscarada, which may force guesswork from the opponent and give it even more opportunities to fire off its strong attacks. Since Meowscarada forces many switches and can remove Heavy-Duty Boots through Knock Off, entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp is highly recommended. Gholdengo is another good partner that can prevent attempts to remove entry hazards while also switching into Pokemon that threaten out Meowscarada, such as Breloom, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. In return, Gholdengo appreciates Meowscarada's ability to deal with Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Tera Water Garganacl. Kingambit is a great Pokemon that can serve as a late-game cleaner after Meowscarada has weakened the enemy team with U-turn and Knock Off. Dragon Dance Dragonite is another great cleaner that, like Kingambit, appreciates Meowscarada's ability to break past Dondozo.</p> "

Knock Off allows Meowscarada to remove important items from Pokemon that rely on them, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite and Tera Fairy Skeledirge, as well as Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from Corviknight and Amoonguss. U-turn allows Meowscarada to serve as a fast pivot to keep up momentum, and with the boost from Protean, it can OHKO or dent slower Pokemon like opposing Meowscarada and Greninja. Play Rough allows Meowscarada to threaten Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-types such as Walking Wake, Dragapult, Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant. Trick allows Meowscarada to cripple walls such as Tera Fairy Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Toxapex. Tera Grass removes Meowscarada's Dark typing, eliminating its weakness to Mach Punch from Breloom and Pawmot, and strengthens its Flower Trick. Tera Fairy grants Meowscarada a resistance to Fighting but also keeps its resistance to Sucker Punch while simultaneously boosting Play Rough. Tera Dark boosts the power of Meowscarada's Knock Off, granting it a chance to OHKO Skeledirge. Terastallizing Meowscarada also negates Protean's effects, giving it more a consistent defensive typing.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Meowscarada fits best on various balance and offensive teams.

When Meowscarada isn't running Play Rough, it can struggle against Walking Wake, Iron Valiant, and Dragonite. Hence, Pokemon that can check them, such as Water Absorb Clodsire, Tera Fairy Garganacl, and Dondozo, make for good teammates; Clodsire can handle Walking Wake, Tera Fairy Garganacl can handle Iron Valiant, and Dondozo walls Dragonite. Despite Meowscarada's coverage options, it finds itself struggling to break past walls like Amoonguss and Corviknight as well as offensive Pokemon like Iron Moth. Hence, Meowscarada appreciates Pokemon that can check them like Skeledirge.

Play Rough allows Meowscarada to clean through weakened Dragon teams, and it's a useful move late-game against other Dark teams. Alternatively, Meowscarada can run Toxic Spikes to cripple foes such as Great Tusk. U-turn picks up momentum for its team on forced switches, for example against Greninja. Choice Scarf plus its Speed and Protean allows it to take on threats such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Great Tusk, and Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Greninja and Meowscarada can break through each other's checks: Greninja can beat Toxapex and Corviknight for Meowscarada, while Choice Scarf Meowscarada can revenge kill Flutter Mane for Greninja.

Kingambit is an incredible late-game sweeper, picking off faster threats like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane with Sucker Punch, and it beats down Fairy-types such as Hatterene for Meowscarada. In return, Meowscarada can pick off Iron Valiant, allowing Kingambit to better pressure Fairy teams. Ting-Lu sets Stealth Rock and Spikes, allowing Meowscarada to clean more easily late-game. Additionally, it can check slower Pokemon such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clodsire with Taunt alongside Earthquake or Ruination. It can also stomach strong special attacks such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast, OHKOing Flutter Mane in return with Heavy Slam. Sableye can switch into Fighting-type attacks for Meowscarada, such as Great Tusk's Close Combat, and either cripple their users with Prankster Will-O-Wisp or force them to switch with Prankster Encore. Sableye can also prevent Pokemon like Clodsire and Brambleghast from setting entry hazards thanks to Prankster Taunt. Skuntank can ease the Fairy matchup by beating Hatterene one-on-one, which lets Meowscarada set Toxic Spikes safely.

Protean increases the damage output of its coverage moves, making them better suited at pressuring targets such as Mega Latias, Galarian Zapdos, and Hydreigon. Knock Off allows Meowscarada to remove important items from walls such as Clefable, Celesteela, and physically defensive Tangrowth, allowing it to break through them more easily. U-turn gives Meowscarada the ability to keep up momentum and in conjunction with Protean, severely dents opposing Meowscarada and Serperior that may try to stay in on it. Thunder Punch is critical for allowing Meowscarada to revenge kill targets like Autotomize Celesteela and Double Dance Galarian Moltres after their respective boosts, especially if the former has already used up its Power Herb; it also OHKOes Gyarados. Alternatively, Play Rough can be used to hit other Fighting- and Dragon-types, most notably Buzzwole, Iron Hands, and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria, while retaining its ability to take out Galarian Moltres. If several of the aforementioned Pokemon are adequately covered by Meowscarada's teammates, Trick can be used to cripple an incoming wall, such as Buzzwole or Amoonguss. Choice Scarf Meowscarada fits best on balance and offensive teams. Pokemon such as Sandy Shocks and Skarmory are appreciated partners for laying entry hazards that capitalize on Meowscarada's ability to force switches and remove items such as Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from the opponent. Defensive pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Utility Jirachi also appreciate Meowscarada's ability to keep threats like Swords Dance Aegislash and Keldeo in check and can opt to safely bring it in against these Pokemon, as Meowscarada's poor defensive attributes often means it cannot switch into them directly. While Meowscarada is able to hit many of them super effectively, it can still struggle to deal lasting damage against walls such as Skarmory and Amoonguss, making offensive teammates that can take advantage of them, such as SubToxic Aegislash, Choice Band Victini, and Choice Specs Latios extremely valuable, all of which benefit from the opportunities provided by Meowscarada's U-turn in return.</p> "

Choice Band allows Meowscarada to OHKO several offensive Pokemon that it otherwise wouldn't, such as Aegislash and Iron Moth. In addition to this, Knock Off cripples defensive walls such as Scizor and Amoonguss by removing their respective items, while also serving as Meowscarada's most common move to use against neutral targets. U-turn allows Meowscarada to rack up momentum against Pokemon it forces out, such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Tapu Fini. Thunder Punch is usually preferred for its ability to 2HKO Skarmory outright, on top of hitting other crucial Flying-type checks such as Enamorus. However, Play Rough can be used instead to provide super effective coverage against other answers, 2HKOing the likes of physically defensive Buzzwole, Mega Sableye, and Mega Altaria. Sucker Punch is also a passable option in the last slot as a priority move that can finish off weakened offensive threats such as Autotomize Celesteela, Z-Celebrate Victini, and Sand Rush Excadrill. Choice Band Meowscarada fits best on more offensive teams, particularly those that appreciate its unique mix of wallbreaking and pivoting capabilities. Frailer offensive teammates that also benefit from Meowscarada's U-turn, such as Mixed Aegislash, Hisuian Zoroark, and Alakazam, can make for good teammates to pressure some of Meowscarada's checks, like Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur. Hisuian Zoroark in particular synergizes especially well, as disguising as Meowscarada with its Illusion ability can help force mindgames with the opponent; the threat of Hisuian Zoroark luring in and eliminating walls such as Buzzwole with Flamethrower can make the opponent much less eager to try and switch them into Meowscarada. Defensive pivots such as Scizor, Galarian Slowking, and Blissey, are also essential to let Meowscarada enter the field safely against more preferable targets, while also being great Pokemon to fall back on when faced with opposing revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Latias and Enamorus. Galarian Slowking can also use Future Sight to remedy Meowscarada's lack of coverage against Fighting-types such as Buzzwole and Iron Hands. Entry hazard support from the likes of Clefable and Sandy Shocks benefit from Meowscarada's Knock Off removing items such as Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from defensive Pokemon like Clefable, on top of making it easier to break past them.</p> "

Due to Meowscarada's insane Speed tier, Taunt allows it to dominate other leads by outspeeding and preventing them from getting their own entry hazards up, most notably Excadrill, Mew, and Hydreigon, while also blocking Defog from foes like Tapu Fini and Mandibuzz. Flower Trick, especially in conjunction with Overgrow, allows Meowscarada to deal significant damage to neutral foes before fainting, most notably 2HKOing Stealth Rock Clefable. Knock Off, on top of 2HKOing Lead Mew, can also remove items such as Skarmory's Rocky Helmet and Celesteela's Leftovers, making them easier to break through. Lead Meowscarada's extensive utility and positive matchups against similar archetypes make it a natural fit for hyper offense teams. Offensive Pokemon such as Swords Dance Scizor, Meteor Beam Celesteela, and Calm Mind Latios each appreciate Spikes' ability to wear down several of their grounded checks into range, like Mega Tyranitar and SubToxic Aegislash. Offensive Stealth Rock users, such as Sandy Shocks and Nihilego, can also synergize well with Meowscarada's Spikes to create even more offensive pressure for the opponent. As Lead Meowscarada tends to struggle against Mega Sableye due to Magic Bounce, Pokemon that can take advantage of it, such as Nasty Plot Galarian Moltres and Booster Energy Iron Moth, make for crucial offensive teammates that can fulfill this role effectively. In return, they favor Meowscarada's ability to remove their crippling weakness to Stealth Rock by shutting down the majority of Stealth Rock setters.</p> "

Flower Trick is Meowscarada's best STAB option and is capable of dealing with weakened Pokemon like Clodsire and Spectrier. Flower Trick's guaranteed critical hit is also very useful in the Fairy matchup and lets Meowscarada revenge kill Azumarill and a weakened Tapu Lele behind Reflect. U-turn allows Meowscarada to maintain an advantage against its defensive checks like Corviknight by being able to pivot into its teammates like Scovillain. Knock Off is a tool to cripple Meowscarada's defensive switch-ins like Toxapex and Klefki in addition to the aforementioned Corviknight. Play Rough is a strong coverage option to threaten opposing Dragon-type Pokemon like Kommo-o, Kyurem, and Latios, which Grass teams tend to struggle against. Low Kick is a less frequent option but lets Meowscarada OHKO Bisharp while threatening Heatran with a 2HKO; however, Play Rough is preferred to have an easier time against Dragon teams. Meowscarada has an easier time revenge killing foes with entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Cradily. Ferrothorn appreciates Meowscarada's ability to check Fighting-types like Mega Gallade, Iron Valiant and Galarian Zapdos with STAB Play Rough. Hisuian Lilligant is also a fantastic offensive partner for Meowscarada. It is able to check the Flying-types that switch into Meowscarada like Celesteela and Landorus-T while also assisting in the Dragon matchup, outspeeding common Pokemon like Garchomp and Dragonite. Hisuian Lilligant also makes the Steel matchup easier for Grass; its ability to threaten Heatran is appreciated by Meowscarada, while Meowscarada can threaten Gholdengo with Knock Off, which Lilligant cannot beat. Mega Venusaur is also a mandatory defensive partner for Meowscarada; its Bug neutrality and bulk allows it to act as a consistent check to Mega Scizor, which easily switches into any move of Meowscarada, and Venusaur is able to check it with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Venusaur also checks opposing Fairy-types for Meowscarada like Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Iron Valiant, while Meowscarada is able to threaten the Psychic-types that force out Mega Venusaur such as Latios, Mega Alakazam, and Victini. Whismicott is one of the best hazard removal options on Grass, and Meowscarada appreciates not having Stealth Rock and Spikes chip it down, because it comes in often to threaten a KO. Whimsicott's Fairy typing also allows Meowscarada and its teammates not to be overwhelmed by Dragon-types like Garchomp, and it can encore Calm Mind Mega Latias. Celebi with Nasty Plot and Groundium Z can break defensive Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra while also being able to threaten opposing Poison-types like Alolan Muk and Toxapex.</p> "

Hex pairs very well with Will-O-Wisp, becoming a 130-Base Power STAB move. On the other hand, Earth Power is very useful against Pokemon that use Tera Fire to avoid burns, such as Koraidon, and it also hits Miraidon and Eternatus switch-ins hard.</li> <li>The combination of reliable recovery with Slack Off and Heavy-Duty Boots means that Skeledirge can easily stay healthy throughout the game and not worry about entry hazards.</li> <li>Tera Fairy is useful against Choice Band Koraidon in particular, as it can break through Skeledirge with Dragon Claw or Outrage; the downside is that Tera Fairy makes Skeledirge vulnerable to Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade. Tera Flying gives Skeledirge an immunity to Ground-type moves, which can be helpful against Arceus-Ground and Stomping Tantrum Koraidon.

As a result, it may be advantageous to anticipate U-turn in these scenarios.</li> <li>Taunt is often employed as a method to bypass Skeledirge's Will-O-Wisp, especially by Koraidon and E-Killer Arceus. If you expect the foe to use Taunt, taking advantage of the situation and gaining Special Attack boosts with Torch Song is a great way to limit their ability to wallbreak.</li> <li>Ting-Lu and Clodsire are excellent teammates for Skeledirge, as they cover most of the special attackers that come in on it, especially Miraidon, while Skeledirge can in turn handle most physical threats. Together they form a solid defensive backbone.</li> <li>Skeledirge is unable to take on Ground-type physical attackers like Arceus-Ground, Tera Ground Zacian-C, and Groudon without using Tera itself. As a result, Pokemon that resist or are immune to Ground like Corviknight, Giratina-O, Landorus-T, and Arceus-Grass make for good partners. Corviknight has the additional benefit of solidifying the matchup against E-Killer Arceus.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy is useful as a backup check to Koraidon, and it makes it much more difficult for Koraidon to get easy momentum with U-turn.</li> </ul> "

Unlike other walls, however, Skeledirge can also be a foreboding wincon with Torch Song and its great offensive typing, which gives it nearly unresisted coverage. Will-O-Wisp gives it value against switch-ins such as Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Clodsire and cripples physical attackers like Great Tusk and Garchomp. Hex benefits from Skeledirge spreading burns, 2HKOing Pokemon such as Dragonite, Iron Hands, and physically defensive Dondozo unboosted, and Toxapex after a single boost from Torch Song. Tera Fairy bolsters Skeledirge against Dragon-types that would otherwise overwhelm it like Dragapult, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Baxcalibur. It also lets Skeledirge beat Quaquaval and lose its Ground weakness, letting it more easily spread burns against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Garchomp. In a pinch, it can bait Dark-type moves from Pokemon like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Meowscarada, Terastallize the same turn, and punish them with Will-O-Wisp. Tera Fairy also maintains Skeledirge's ability to beat Iron Valiant, Volcarona, and Hatterene.</p> <p>Skeledirge fits on many bulky offense, balance, and stall teams as a much-appreciated answer to common wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene. Skeledirge often ends up entry hazard fodder for Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Thus, secure hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight are excellent partners. Additionally, Great Tusk can 2HKO the aforementioned Pokemon, helping set Skeledirge up for a potential sweep, while Corviknight walls the aforementioned Ground-types, can bring Skeledirge in later with U-turn, and can absorb Knock Off from the likes of Great Tusk, Meowscarada, and Iron Treads. Pokemon such as Meowscarada and Iron Valiant can overwhelm Skeledirge answers like Gholdengo, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu. In addition to this, they appreciate Skeledirge's ability to beat Hatterene and, after Terastallizing, Dragapult. Covert Cloak Gholdengo can beat any Garganacl using Skeledirge as setup fodder. Bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Toxapex help deal with offensive Water-types like Greninja and Quaquaval. Additionally, they can both spread status, facilitating Skeledirge's Hex. Rotom-W in particular can offensively check Ground-types like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Ting-Lu too, although it cannot directly switch into them. Offensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Dragonite appreciate Skeledirge halting scary Pokemon, like Volcarona and Iron Valiant, and they help it overwhelm checks like Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire.</p> "

Substitute also allows Skeledirge to scout Choice item Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Dragonite, as well as protecting it from revenge killers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon more reliably. Substitute also lets Skeledirge set up against the likes of Garganacl and Cinderace, and it blocks from status from the likes of Toxapex, Clodsire, and Thunder Wave Rotom-W. Maximum HP investment means that Garganacl cannot break Substitute with Salt Cure. 40 Defense EVs let Skeledirge survive two Bulldozes from Focus Sash Breloom, meaning it can consistently outheal Bulldoze, barring a critical hit. 188 Special Defense EVs ensures it survives a Shadow Ball from non-Tera Ghost Choice Specs Dragapult, while 28 Speed EVs let it outspeed Kingambit. Tera Fairy helps stop the likes of Dragapult and Great Tusk from overwhelming Skeledirge, especially the former, which bypasses Substitute with Infiltrator but cannot 2HKO Skeledirge after it Terastallizes. Tera Fairy also prevents Garganacl's Earthquake from breaking Substitute.</p> <p>Substitute Skeledirge fits best on bulky offense and balance teams as a good check to Garganacl. Pokemon Garganacl can overwhelm such as Dragonite, Hex Dragapult, Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, Calm Mind Hatterene, Corviknight, Toxapex, and Dondozo can lure it in for Skeledirge to set up Substitute on and snowball. Additionally, the former can break through Pokemon that wall Skeledirge, namely Toxapex and Clodsire, and Dragapult and Corviknight also boast U-turn, letting them pivot into Skeledirge on a Garganacl switch-in. The setup sweepers enjoy Skeledirge's potent wallbreaking, too. Toxapex and Dondozo also check Pokemon that overwhelm Skeledirge, such as Dragapult and Greninja. Pokemon that do not mind Knock Off like Great Tusk and Corviknight greatly help this set, as Skeledirge is both weak to Knock Off and reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots due to its Stealth Rock weakness. These Pokemon also double as entry hazard removers, with the former preventing Gholdengo from entering safely and the latter checking Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Meowscarada can chip down Pokemon that wall Skeledirge like Ting-Lu and Clodsire. In return, Skeledirge can threaten common entry hazard answers like Hatterene and Corviknight, as well as spinblocking in a pinch.</p> "

Paldean Tauros-F is also a good teammate, since it can threaten the aforementioned Dark-types with its Fighting STAB while also having Intimidate to help neutralize physical attackers that Skeledirge cannot handle on its own, such as Roaring Moon. Additionally, its Choice Scarf set can outspeed and KO Greninja. Torkoal pairs well with Skeledirge due to its ability to both remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and set them up, all while also powering up Skeledirge's Torch Song. Cinderace is a fairly good partner as well due to High Jump Kick, letting it remove Dark-types aiming to threaten Skeledirge, while also being able to remove entry hazards with Court Change and hit Poison-types such as Clodsire and Toxapex with Zen Headbutt.

Will-O-Wisp lets it cripple physical attackers such as Mega Tyranitar, Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T while also punishing Water-types such as Rotom-W. Combined with Will-O-Wisp, Hex helps it overwhelm passive checks in Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Clodsire while also allowing Skeledirge to sweep statused teams. While not as strong as Hex, Shadow Ball is a decent option as it's more consistent. Tera Water allows Skeledirge to beat rain teams by spreading burns against rain sweepers such as Mega Swampert, Barraskewda, and Floatzel. On the other hand, Tera Fairy allows it to counter Dragon Dance Dragapult and avoid Pursuit from Kingambit, Mega Tyranitar, and Weavile while also keeping a Fighting resistance, meaning it can still check Zamazenta. It also removes Skeledirge's Ground weakness, allowing it to comfortably burn Pokemon like Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T. Skeledirge struggles against Heatran and Garganacl, as it can't burn them nor deal significant damage to them. Therefore, Pokemon that pressure them like Garchomp and Rotom-W for the former and Cover Cloak Gholdengo for the latter make good partners. Skeledirge also hates losing its item, so Knock Off absorbers like Flyinium Z Tornadus-T and Gliscor make for good teammates.

          "description": "<p>Quaquaval is an amazing setup sweeper due to Bulk Up, Moxie, and Aqua Step to outpace foes like Hydreigon, Iron Moth, and Garchomp. Bulk Up lets it more easily take out threats like Great Tusk, Armarouge, and Ting-Lu and survive attacks from Pokemon such as Baxcalibur, Tera Flying Roaring Moon, and Azumarill. Close Combat hits Pokemon that can take an Aqua Step, like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, Hydreigon, and Baxcalibur, super effectively. Roost gives Quaquaval longevity to accumulate and take advantage of its boosts, and it allows Quaquaval to switch into Kingambit and Cinderace without fearing chip damage. Taunt shuts down Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Skeledirge by preventing the use of recovery and status-inflicting moves. It also blocks Defense-boosting attempts from Curse and Bulk Up users like Great Tusk and Garganacl. Ice Spinner is a great coverage move that hits Pokemon that would otherwise resist Quaquaval's STAB attacks, like Dragonite, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Amoonguss. 112 Speed EVs allow Quaquaval to outspeed Iron Moth after a boost. Tera Water boosts Aqua Step's power and removes Quaquaval's weakness to threats like Iron Valiant, Azumarill, and Future Sight Slowking. Tera Fighting boosts Close Combat’s power to dent threats like Garchomp and Breloom. It also allows Quaquaval to take less damage from Garganacl’s Salt Cure. Tera Poison is a defensive option that allows Quaquaval to resist Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Azumarill, absorb Toxic Spikes, and be immune to Toxapex and Clodsire's Toxic.</p> <p>Quaquaval fits best on offense teams that support its ability to set up and sweep. Entry hazards from Pokemon like Meowscarada and Glimmora give Quaquaval an easier time taking out foes. Pivots like Rotom-W and Cinderace bring Quaquaval safely onto the field against threats like Volcarona, Great Tusk, and Baxcalibur. Cinderace in particular is able to provide entry hazard control with Court Change and can burn foes with Will-O-Wisp, giving Quaquaval an easier time to set up and sweep. Quaquaval targets common Fire-, Ground-, and Dark-types; therefore, it can support teammates weak to them like Corviknight and Gholdengo. In return, Corviknight can pivot Quaquaval into battle, come in on Assault Vest Toxapex, and remove entry hazards. Gholdengo blocks status that prevent Quaquaval from sweeping should it not run Taunt. Quaquaval struggles against Pokemon like Dragonite, Dragapult, and Azumarill; therefore, threats to them like Scizor, Iron Valiant, and Baxcalibur make good teammates. Scizor checks Azumarill, while Iron Valiant and Baxcalibur check Dragonite and Dragapult. Baxcalibur also dents Azumarill heavily, allowing Quaquaval to take it out more easily.</p> "

Alternatively, Brick Break may be used to retain Quaquaval's defensive stats and clear dual screens in the Ice and Fairy matchups at the cost of extra damage. Aqua Step enables Quaquaval to function as a potential late-game cleaner and threatens Pokemon like Volcarona, Skeledirge, and Unaware Clodsire. Rapid Spin is used to clear entry hazards, aiding against entry hazard-stacking teams. The given EV spread allows Quaquaval to outpace Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao after a single Rapid Spin or Aqua Step boost, OHKO Flutter Mane after one Moxie boost, and better deal with priority moves from Breloom and Kingambit.</p> <p>Greninja breaks past troublesome walls like Toxapex, Sableye, and Water Absorb Clodsire due to its wide range of coverage. Toxapex serves as an answer to threats like Meowscarada, Breloom, and Iron Valiant, sets up Toxic Spikes, and hinders Pokemon like Rotom-W, Dragonite, and Quagsire with Toxic. Gastrodon and Quagsire are valued for their Electric-type immunity against Pokemon like Rotom-W, Sandy Shocks, and Magnezon as well as their entry hazards, supporting Quaquaval as a cleaner. Pelipper can set rain to boost Quaquaval's Aqua Step and pressures Grass-types like Breloom, Infiltrator Brambleghast, and Meowscarada with Hurricane. Slowking can safely pivot into Quaquaval with Chilly Reception and aids in late-game cleaning with Future Sight.</p> "

Wave Crash is a powerful, drawback-free STAB move that deals heavy damage to foes lacking resistance to Water. Brave Bird is used to hit common Water move switch-ins, like Desolate Land users and opposing Quaquaval. Close Combat can be used as a powerful secondary STAB move and is useful for hitting Steel types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra, but its drawbacks and typing leave Quaquaval vulnerable to Desolate Land users like Iron Moth, Ceruledge, and Volcarona. Rapid Spin has fantastic synergy with Quaquaval's immunity to passive damage and ability to force out common hazard setters like Garchomp and Landorus-T; Quaquaval also appreciates the Speed boost and can use it in conjunction with Swords Dance to sweep later in the game. Roost greatly improves Quaquaval's longevity, allowing it to repeatedly check threats like Chien-Pao and Kingambit, while U-turn is used to safely bring in teammates after Quaquaval forces a switch. Quaquaval is hard to wear down thanks to Magic Guard, but its middling Speed and bulk leave it vulnerable to faster threats like Iron Moth, Zapdos, and Meowscarada. Fast, offensive teammates like Chien-Pao and Iron Moth appreciate Quaquaval's wallbreaking prowress and ability to remove hazards. Thanks to the passive damage immunity, Quaquaval excels as an offensive rapid spinner on hazard stacking teams, where teammates like Garchomp, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora can set hazards without worrying about enemy hazards wearing them down.</p> "

A Choice Band with an Adamant nature maximizes Lokix's damage output and can utilise Axe Kick to lure and defeat Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Life Orb avoids a Choice lock and makes use of Sucker Punch to pick off threats that First Impression alone cannot such as Gholdengo and Flutter Mane.

Volcarona takes care of Steel-types that don't fall to Axe Kick such as Corviknight and Scizor. Lokix can remove Ghost-types—such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane—to enable Slither Wing and Heracross, letting them spam their powerful Fighting-type moves and clean up after Lokix. Frosmoth can deal with many bulky Ground-types—such as Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu—and Vivillon improves the Fighting-type matchup by beating Great Tusk, Gallade, and Paldean Tauros-W and can answer Dondozo with the combination of Sleep Powder and Energy Ball.

Double Shock is a very strong move, despite its single-use nature, but Thunder Punch is an alternative because of Iron Fist's added power and its ability to threaten Corviknight more reliably. Mach Punch gives Pawmot a form of speed control against offensive threats such as Kingambit, Greninja, and Roaring Moon. Ice Punch hits Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Clodsire super effectively as well as threats that resist Pawmot's STAB moves like Dragapult and Amoonguss. Tera Electric allows Pawmot to repeatedly use Double Shock, allowing Pawmot to repeatedly hit bulky threats such as Slowking, Dondozo, Corviknight, and Skeledirge while shedding Pawmot's weakness to attacks from Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Armarouge. Leppa Berry maximizes the use of Revival Blessing.</p> <p>Pawmot's capabilities allow it to fare best on offensive teams that appreciate Revival Blessing bringing back frail threats. Late-game cleaners such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth all appreciate Pawmot bringing them back into the game, allowing them another chance to run through the opposing team. Revival Blessing has great synergy with Kingambit in particular as it can be used to increase Kingambit's power from its teammates fainting. Pawmot also fits well on rain teams because of Revival Blessing bringing back teammates like Golduck, Barraswekda, and Floatzel, especially the latter of which that tends to faint from Wave Crash recoil, allowing them to sweep again. Pawmot's biggest challenges are Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garchomp; therefore, Pokemon that can pressure them, such as Baxcalibur, Walking Wake, Meowscarada, and the aforementioned rain wallbreakers, are great teammates.</p> "

Seed Bomb allows Pawmot to lure common checks such as Quagsire and Gastrodon and OHKO them handily. Alternatively, Ice Punch provides a solid middle ground against Ground- and Flying-types, in cases where losing Pawmot's Electric typing via Double Shock is not ideal, as well as allowing Pawmot to hit Brambleghast effectively, although this does require backup for Gastrodon and Quagsire. Natural Cure allows it to not worry about Talonflame's Flame Body and use Rest to improve its longevity, offsetting the damage from Life Orb and entry hazards. Tera Electric allows for Pawmot to continuously use Double Shock without switching out and increases its power, making it even more difficult to handle. This also helps Pawmot's defensive matchup against threats such as Gardevoir, Noivern, and Brave Bird Talonflame; although, one should still be aware of losing important resistances to strong priority attacks such as Slither Wing's First Impression and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Heavy-Duty Boots is also an option over Life Orb to preserve Pawmot's longevity.</p> <p>Pawmot fits well on teams that benefit from its ability to handle common threats such as Tinkaton, Slowking, and Tyranitar by breaking through them with raw power, as well as offensive teams that appreciate its excellent Speed. Reliable entry hazard setters such as Tinkaton and Sandy Shocks are worth considering, as the chip damage they provide makes it even easier for Pawmot to break through defensive threats, with the former also boasting Encore to help generate free turns. Grass-types such as Wo-Chien, Brambleghast, and Tsareena are also appreciated to handle Gastrodon and Quagsire, especially if Pawmot chooses Ice Punch, with the latter two also offering reliable hazard removal. Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Lycanroc-D that handle Talonflame as well as other Flying-types such as Iron Jugulis and Noivern are also appreciated. Scream Tail is also a teammate worth considering, as it has access to Stealth Rock and Encore, as well as Wish to keep Pawmot healthy and Thunder Wave to cripple fast threats like Grafaiai and Gengar while also having a strong matchup against revenge killers such as Noivern and Iron Jugulis. Pawmot also appreciates teammates with pivoting moves, such as Scizor, Tsareena, Noivern, and Grafaiai, to allow it to come in safely, especially against targets such as Tinkaton and Slowking.</p> "

Revival Blessing allows Pawmot to revive a teammate on a forced switch, while Seed Bomb can threaten Pokemon like Quagsire and Gastrodon better. Revival Blessing is more commonly run, as Close Combat can usually do enough damage to break these walls with some entry hazard assistance.

Double Shock allows Pawmot to OHKO threats such as Flutter Mane and Azumarill as well as finishing off Iron Valiant, but this comes with the downside of Pawmot immediately being forced out after using the move. Ice Punch allows Pawmot to deal decent damage to Ground-types that resist both its STAB moves, notably OHKOing both Landorus formes as well as 2HKOing both Iron Leaves and Clodsire. Volt Switch allows Pawmot to pivot out of a check such as Amoonguss into one of its teammates to deal with it. Play Rough and Seed Bomb are usable alternatives, with Play Rough being able to 2HKO Sableye while still hitting Dragon-types and Seed Bomb dealing with Water/Ground types that most Electric-type Pokemon cannot handle efficiently.

Iron Hands can also OHKO the latter when running Heavy Slam. In return, Pawmot can run Seed Bomb to handle Water/Ground types Iron Hands cannot efficiently threaten such as Quagsire, and Swords Dance variants of Iron Hands appreciate it removing Flutter Mane and wearing down Sableye.

Thunder Wave gives Maushold's teammates an easier time against the opposing team.</li> <li>It can also choose from several excellent coverage moves.

Despite this upside, it also gives Maushold an Ice weakness, allowing Chien-Pao to more easily revenge kill it with Ice Shard.</li> <li>Great partners for Maushold are Pokemon that give it more longevity and easier entry, as it has poor bulk and is threatened by most attacks.

It gives a resistance to Make It Rain, blocks Thunder Wave from defensive sets, and punishes Tera Flying usage that is meant to get around Earth Power. On top of that, Arboliva still hits Corviknight very hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is another great defensive option for neutralizing most of Arboliva's weaknesses, and the extra power behind Dazzling Gleam can make it easier to break defensive Dragonite variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass removes Arboliva’s Fighting weakness while maintaining Spore immunity, letting it check Breloom. If both Tera and Grassy Terrain are active, Modest Giga Drain can even 2HKO Breloom!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground: While not as strong defensively, invested Tera Earth Power can OHKO uninvested Chi-Yu and Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 4 Def / 140 SpA / 124 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread balances bulk and power, avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Specs Gholdengo's Make It Rain and almost always surviving Modest Chi-Yu’s Fire Blast before Tera! If running Tera Ground, there are enough Special Attack EV’s to turn Earth Power into an OHKO against uninvested Chi-Yu and Gholdengo. The Speed EV's Speed tie with 4 Speed Gastrodon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 252 SpA / 20 SpD with Modest: This simple spread still provides plenty of bulk while maximizing Special Attack, working nicely with Leaf Storm and Tera Types that boost Arboliva's coverage moves. If Grassy Terrain is present, fully invested Leaf Storm has a 75% chance of OHKOing 4 Special Defense Garchomp. The bulk investment lets Arboliva always avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire after Grassy Terrain recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 20 SpD / 252 Spe with Modest: While maximum Speed investment may seem a bit strange, it can be worth it when running Tera Fire Tera Blast to get the jump on Scizor, Corviknight and the rare Timid Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 4 Def / 148 SpA / 20 SpD / 100 Spe with Modest: This alternative Speed spread gives Arboliva a nice boost in Special Attack while still letting it outrun 4 Speed Azumarill. This is usually more than enough Speed to outrun Ting-Lu as well.</p> </li> </ul> "

It can take hits from Dragapult, Zapdos, and Iron Moth as well as sit on passive walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and non-Grass Knot Amoonguss, giving it plenty of opportunites to enter the field. In addition to letting it contest with Attack-boosting foes like Dragonite, Dragapult, and Roaring Moon, Curse boosts Salt Cure's initial damage to threaten Pokemon like Corviknight, which would otherwise exhaust Salt Cure's PP with Pressure. Curse also works well with Earthquake, breaking past Covert Cloak Gholdengo, non-Haze Toxapex, opposing Garganacl, and Skeledirge's Substitute. Stealth Rock is a viable alternative if the team lacks a Stealth Rock user, since Garganacl tends to force multiple switches with Salt Cure and can outlast and annoy common entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight. Tera Water lets it take on Kingambit, Gholdengo, Azumarill, and rain teams better, while Tera Fairy improves its matchup against Dragapult, Great Tusk, and Meowscarada, the latter of which can bypass Garganacl's boosts with Flower Trick. The EV spread prevents a 2HKO from offensive Great Tusk's Close Combat or Headlong Rush after Curse, even after its Leftovers is removed by Knock Off.</p> <p>Curse Garganacl is a valuable asset for balance teams. Defensive teammates such as Corviknight, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Clodsire cover threats like Great Tusk, Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo, respectively. Skeledirge in return appreciates Garganacl switching into Shadow Ball from Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark, with Tera Water variants dealing with Gholdengo and Water-types as well, while Ting-Lu and Clodsire are secondary checks to Dragapult, Heatran, and Iron Moth, which keeps Garganacl moderately healthy early-game so it can have an easier time sweeping later on. Knock Off users such as Great Tusk and Meowscarada are crucial to remove Covert Cloak and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Amoonguss, Clodsire, Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Slowking. Great Tusk, Meowscarada, Toxapex, and Clodsire can also set entry hazards of their own, either allowing Garganacl to forgo Stealth Rock or forming an entry hazard stacking core. Offensive teammates like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Meowscarada are great against offensive teams that contain the likes of Dragonite and Roaring Moon—which can overwhelm Garganacl prior to boosting—and can clean up late-game in case Garganacl is unable to fully sweep. In return, Garganacl matches up well against defensive foes that they struggle with, such as Clodsire and Toxapex, especially with Dragapult bringing it into them safely via U-turn.</p> "

Meowscarada and Great Tusk provide Knock Off support by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak from Gholdengo and Toxapex to let Garganacl accrue Salt Cure damage more freely. Great Tusk also removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Gholdengo appreciates Great Tusk being worn down, since it shuts down other forms of entry hazard control well and fits alongside Garganacl and other entry hazard setters such as Garchomp.

Salt Cure wears down common switch-ins such as Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Rotom-W, and Hatterene, as well as passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Corviknight, and forces them to burn recovery PP more often. Recover keeps Garganacl healthy throughout a game to check Pokemon like Ceruledge and Iron Moth and makes it more sustainable as a wincon. Purifying Salt prevents it from being crippled by Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Clodsire. It also provides a handy Ghost resistance, letting Garganacl potentially switch in on predicted Ghost-type moves from Pokemon like Dragapult and Skeledirge. Leftovers provides valuable passive recovery, reducing Garganacl's reliance on Recover. Maximum Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature maximize Garganacl's bulk, making it easier for Garganacl to switch in on Pokemon such as Dragapult, Zapdos, and Heatran and use them as setup fodder. Tera Water provides incredibly valuable resistances, letting Garganacl potentially check Gholdengo and Scizor while retaining its ability to pivot in on Fire-types like Cinderace. Tera Fairy allows Garganacl to turn the tables on Great Tusk while also preventing Breloom from revenge killing it. However, this does remove its resistance to Fire, making it more susceptible to Pokemon like Skeledirge and Ceruledge. Tera Ghost prevents Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk from reliably revenge killing Garganacl, letting it use them as setup fodder. It does negate the Ghost resistance provided by Purifying Salt, however, so another switch-in to Dragapult's Shadow Ball should be used.</p> <p>Checks to strong wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Breloom are good teammates; examples include the likes of Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. While Garganacl is given a Ghost resistance from Purifying Salt, it cannot fully check Dragapult and Gholdengo prior to Terastallization, with the latter completely countering it if it uses Covert Cloak. As such, Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire make for great teammates. Pokemon like Corviknight and Scizor appreciate Garganacl checking Fire-types like Ceruledge and Skeledirge. Corviknight is notable in that it also forms a strong defensive core with Garganacl, checking Meowscarada for it. Entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Corviknight are appreciated, as Garganacl is heavily pressured by entry hazards and cannot set up reliably if it is worn down. Frail, offensive Pokemon like Cinderace appreciate chip damage being forced onto their checks and having a strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on. Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Iron Valiant can pave the way for Garganacl to clean late-game, wearing down or significantly pressuring its checks in Gholdengo, Meowscarada, and Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Garganacl eases the Water and Steel matchups thanks to its signature move, Salt Cure. Iron Defense allows Garganacl to set up, tanking super effective physical hits due to its astronomical base 130 Defense, while also boosting the power of Body Press, which helps nail Dark- and Steel-types such as Ting-Lu, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit. Curse is another option that can buff its Attack, boosting the damage of Salt Cure, but it prevents Garganacl from easily stonewalling physical attackers—such as Dragonite and defensive Quaquaval—and also lowers Garganacl's Speed. Salt Cure is a fantastic STAB move, neutering setup sweepers such as Mimikyu, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as it puts them on a timer, which Garganacl can potentially stall out as it sets up or heals via Recover. Purifying Salt is particularly useful, as it allows Garganacl to absorb incoming status moves such as Toxic from Quagsire or Toxapex as well as Will-O-Wisp from Dragapult or Sableye and punish them with Salt Cure. Garganacl is also able to tank Ghost-type STAB moves from the likes of Choice-locked Flutter Mane and Dragapult. Leftovers is the best item to provide passive recovery; however, Heavy-Duty Boots can allow Garganacl to come in without taking entry hazard damage, as entry hazard stacking is extremely common. As an alternative to the given EVs, 52 Defense EVs with an Impish nature let Garganacl potentially overwhelm Choice Band Scizor, Tinkaton, and defensive Quaquaval if used with Iron Defense.</p> <p>Tyranitar is an amazing partner for Garganacl, as it sets sand. Tyranitar can also be used as one of the few special attackers Rock teams have access to to nail physical walls such as Great Tusk with Ice Beam; it is also Rock's best check to Kingambit due to it being able to survive a boosted Sucker Punch and OHKO back with Fire Blast. Choice Scarf Glimmora can take on Grass- and Fighting-types such as Breloom and Iron Valiant that may threaten Garganacl out. Glimmora also has fantastic coverage, being able to take on Steel-types such as Gholdengo with Earth Power and Water-types such as Gastrodon and Quagsire with Energy Ball. Glimmora can also provide Toxic Spikes support thanks to its ability, Toxic Debris, which can help Garganacl further wear down and pressure the opposing Pokemon. Teammates that utilize Air Balloon such as Iron Thorns and Drednaw can switch into powerful Ground-type attacks aimed at Garganacl. Drednaw can also utilize its Water-type STAB move to take out opposing Ground-types such as Iron Treads, Unaware Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Drednaw can also turn the tide against rain Water teams thanks to its ability, Swift Swim. Lycanroc-D is also a really good partner for Garganacl that appreciates its ability to wear down foes so it can clean up late-game. Coalossal is also a good partner that can not only burn foes but also lay down entry hazards. Coalossal can also clear its side of the field as well with Rapid Spin, alleviating chip damage on the team. It also acts as a soft check to Scizor and Meowscarada due to its neutralities and can potentially neuter them with Flame Body.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>With solid defenses and access to reliable recovery, Garganacl can perform well in a utility role or with setup in Iron Defense. Its biggest selling points are its unique move and ability: Salt Cure offers valuable passive damage, synergizing well with its natural bulk, while Purifying Salt provides a useful immunity to status moves such as Spore and Toxic. Garganacl is difficult to break for many Pokemon, but it matches up notably well into Fire-types such as Chi-Yu and Arcanine, Flying-types like Dragonite and Iron Jugulis, and Amoonguss due to Purifying Salt. As one of the best Wide Guard users, Garganacl can block the format's many powerful spread attacks such as Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Chi-Yu's Heat Wave, and Armarouge's Expanding Force. Iron Defense lets Garganacl play as a potent wincon instead, increasing its Defense whilst simultaneously strengthening its offensive presence through Body Press. These sets can be very difficult to take down, though they often rely on using up Terastallization to be most effective. Garganacl's abysmal Speed means it will usually be relegated to moving last. Rock typing also leaves Garganacl with countless weaknesses, including to Water-, Steel-, and Fighting-type moves, meaning common Pokemon such as Palafin, Gholdengo, Iron Bundle, Iron Hands, and Great Tusk all significantly threaten it. Amoonguss is one of the best partners for Garganacl, being helpful against several of the aforementioned threats, while Garganacl checks Fire-types like Chi-Yu in return, with redirection support and healing being especially critical for Iron Defense sets. Garganacl also appreciates teammates that can check Gholdengo, especially if not using Wide Guard, so Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Arcanine, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit are other desirable additions.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Other defensive Tera types are also usable depending on team needs. For example, Tera Poison still provides a Fighting-type resistance but doesn't gain the Dark-type weakness that Tera Ghost does. This means after Terastallization, Garganacl will still be good against Chi-Yu and gains immunity to Toxic Spikes, at the cost of not losing its Ground-type weakness. Tera Water is another alternative, offering helpful resists against Water-types like Palafin and Steel-types like Gholdengo.</p> ",

While the 50% health cut can make it a tad risky, the Curse affliction is very powerful at wearing down Pokemon, including major foes that take advantage of Salt Cure, such as Covert Cloak Pokemon, bulky Substitute users, and Espathra Baton Pass chains.

Stealth Rock pairs well with Salt Cure, as Salt Cure heavily chips common hazard removal options like Iron Treads and Corviknight, while Iron Defense and Curse allow Garganacl to act as a bulky cleaner late-game.

          "description": "<p>Armarouge carves a niche for itself with its powerful STAB moves and passable Speed alongside its unique setup and offensive utility. Endure allows Armarouge to survive any direct attack, and when combined with Weak Armor's speed boost, it can allow Armarouge to turn the tables on faster physical threats like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Baxcalibur, and Garchomp. Expanding Force is Armarouge's most powerful attack in Psychic Terrain and 2HKOed all neutral targets besides the uncommon Blissey. Moreover, with Spikes support or Tera Psychic, it can reliably OHKO the likes of Clodsire and Baxcalibur. Armor Cannon is Armarouge's strongest move outside of Psychic Terrain and complements Expanding Force well, OHKOing Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Corviknight and 2HKOing Hatterene. Calm Mind capitalizes on the switches it forces, allowing it to always OHKO Rotom-W and Volcarona with Expanding Force while often OHKOing Garganacl. Destiny Bond can instead force a trade against threats it cannot OHKO normally, such as Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and bulky threats like Ting-Lu and Dondozo. If Psychic Terrain is not active, Destiny Bond forces Sucker Punch users like Kingambit into a difficult situation, where they must either KO Armarouge next turn and faint or switch out and let Armarouge land a powerful attack for free. Tera Psychic powers up Expanding Force to ludicrous levels, allowing it to 2HKO specially defensive Skeledirge and OHKO Dondozo, physically defensive Garganacl, Clodsire, Garchomp, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur while OHKOing Assault Vest Toxapex after a Calm Mind boost. Focus Sash gives Armarouge space to survive at least one hit from full HP, allowing it to set up a Calm Mind or hit attackers back, and it can punish a contact move without committing to Endure. A Modest nature gives Armarouge the best odds of OHKOing Clodsire, Rotom-W, Walking Wake, and Baxcalibur after chip damage from entry hazards, but a Timid nature helps Armarouge sweep late-game by outpacing Speed-boosting Walking Wake with Protosynthesis active, outpacing +1 Iron Moth, and tying with +1 Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Armarouge is a staple on \"Psychic spam\" teams, which use Psychic Terrain and a litany of powerful setup sweepers to overwhelm opponents at a breakneck pace. Psychic Terrain blocks priority moves, including Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, rendering Armarouge very difficult to revenge kill after a Weak Armor boost. Indeedee is a mandatory teammate to set Psychic Terrain, and it can wear down Dark-types with Dazzling Gleam. Furthermore, its Healing Wish can give a weakened Armarouge or one of its teammates a second chance to sweep. Polteageist is another common Psychic spam threat that can threaten the Dark-types Armarouge struggles against with a Fighting-type Tera Blast; in return, Armarouge can handle Steel-types, which Polteageist would otherwise be forced to Terastallize against. One of Armarouge or Polteageist can also wear down Ting-Lu, allowing the other to break past it and sweep late-game. Entry hazard control is extremely important, especially hazard removal, since Armarouge greatly prefers having Focus Sash active to sweep. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides excellent role compression for these teams, since it provides both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, and it can get Armarouge in safely by activating Eject Pack with Close Combat or Headlong Rush; notably, Armarouge can use Stealth Rock to more easily OHKO Rotom-W, Assault Vest Toxapex, and Clodsire without using up its team's Terastallization. Hatterene can deter opposing entry hazards with Magic Bounce while spreading paralysis with Nuzzle and weakening Dark-types with Dazzling Gleam; it can also use Eject Button to reliably pivot in Armarouge if Psychic Terrain is up. Magic Bounce also deters Taunt users, which can otherwise prevent Armarouge from setting up with Calm Mind and Endure, and Hatterene can also offer Healing Wish support. Lastly, many other setup sweepers can fit well on Psychic Terrain teams to open up a sweep for Armarouge, or to sweep once Armarouge punches holes for them. Volcarona and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur can weaken or eliminate Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon, which Armarouge struggles greatly against, while Armarouge can break past Clodsire and Unaware walls for Volcarona to sweep, and it can deal with Steel-types to assist Baxcalibur.</p> "

This allows it to rack up damage on its checks throughout the game and then set up with Swords Dance to sweep late-game with Shadow Sneak.</li> <li>Shadow Claw is mandatory to be able to break through physical walls like Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Alomomola, which is only made easier with Terastallization and the power boost from Life Orb. These easily allow it to 2HKO Toxapex and Alomomola after a boost. Tera Ghost also greatly helps against Dondozo and Great Tusk, which can often be overwhelmed with good play.</li> <li>Shadow Sneak greatly appreciates the power boost from Tera Ghost, which is newly capable of OHKOing foes like Iron Valiant after a single Swords Dance boost and Miraidon after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Adamant is the preferred nature as the power boost it provides is very significant. A specific example is Miraidon needing two rounds of Stealth Rock damage for a +2 Tera Ghost Adamant Shadow Sneak to OHKO it, while Jolly would need three rounds of Stealth Rock damage. Jolly's power drop is too significant and the extra Speed it gives doesn't make a worthwhile difference.</li> <li>Tera Fairy improves Ceruledge's defensive profile even more, as it is now immune to Koraidon's Dragon-type STAB moves. This allows it to get many effortless switches or at least heavily dissuade Koraidon from using anything else other than U-turn.</li> <li>Heavy-Duty Boots is a solid option to ignore entry hazards, making it harder to wear Ceruledge down passively, especially in conjunction with Bitter Blade healing further improving longevity. However, the power drop is very noticeable, as it can often come up short in the scenarios you would rely on it to score a KO, for example it now can't OHKO Flutter Mane with Shadow Sneak.</li> <li>Koraidon is an amazing partner, as they can double up on shared checks and wallbreak for the other one to clean late-game. Most importantly, it hugely powers up Ceruledge's Bitter Blade. Koraidon can also help to dance around Chi-Yu, as it can take Dark Pulse aimed at Ceruledge.</li> <li>Great Tusk can also fit alongside the two, as it can clear entry hazards for Ceruledge and help break Dondozo thanks to its immense power. It can also act as a backup Koraidon check.</li> <li>Flutter Mane can often threaten out the Pokemon used for countering Ceruledge, while Ceruledge can threaten out Flutter Mane's checks. They can synergistically break through teams together.</li> <li>Chien-Pao and Ceruledge often act similarly, as they are both tough wallbreakers with good priority that often share checks.

Taunt also prevents Ceruledge by being statused by the likes of Clodsire and Rotom-W. Close Combat OHKOs specially defensive Garganacl after a Swords Dance boost while 2HKOing Ting-Lu, physically defensive Garganacl, and Rotom-W, all of which are not threatened by Bitter Blade. Solar Blade threatens Dondozo, Garganacl, Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Great Tusk while sun is active. Focus Sash can ensure that Weak Armor and Swords Dance are activated, allowing Ceruledge to sweep more reliably. Life Orb is an alternative option that makes it possible to OHKO Ting-Lu and 2HKO Great Tusk at +2. Weak Armor couples incredibly well with Focus Sash, and its resistances to types like Bug and Fire, allowing Ceruledge to gain a free Speed boost by switching into U-turn from pivots like Corviknight and Cinderace, as well as Pyro Ball from the latter. Flash Fire lets Ceruledge function as a more reliable switch-in to Fire-types like Iron Moth, while potentially powering up Bitter Blade. Tera Fire provides extra power to Bitter Blade in order to OHKO Amoonguss and 2HKO Tera Steel Toxapex before Swords Dance. Tera Fighting provides Ceruledge with a Dark-resistance, allowing it to take attacks from the likes of Kingambit and Roaring Moon, particularly Sucker Punch from the former, in order to gain a Speed boost from Weak Armor. However, beware of other neutral attacks from such threats, as Choice Band Roaring Moon will still be able to OHKO Ceruledge with Dragon Claw. After a Swords Dance, Tera Fighting gives Close Combat enough extra power to OHKO all Garganacl sets, Ting-Lu, and Rotom-W after Stealth Rock chip. Tera Grass can be used together with Solar Blade in order to 2HKO Dondozo under sun. If running a Jolly nature, Ceruledge can outspeed Gholdengo and Baxcalibur, as well as Booster Energy Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and +1 Roaring Moon and Adamant Dragapult after a Weak Armor boost. Jolly, however, notably misses out on Adamant’s chance to OHKO Great Tusk and Ting-Lu at +2 with Tera Fighting Close Combat, as well as ensuring a 2HKO against Clodsire with Bitter Blade after Stealth Rock chip.</p> <p>Ceruledge fits best on offensive teams, mainly those that use sun, in addition to some bulky offense teams that can provide it opportunities to enter battle and set up safely. As one of few viable physical Fire-types, Ceruledge has great synergy with Torkoal, which can activate sun to boost Bitter Blade’s power and allow Solar Blade to be used in one turn. Torkoal also sets Stealth Rock, removes hazards with Rapid Spin, and can spread status with Lava Plume and Yawn to allow Ceruledge safe entry. Walking Wake benefits from Ceruledge’s unique coverage on sun teams, as it appreciates foes like Azumarill and Slowking being removed. In return, Walking Wake can pressure foes like Skeledirge and Great Tusk. Great Tusk and Hatterene are also good partners on sun teams, as they can keep entry hazards off the field so that Ceruledge can enter battle safely with its Focus Sash intact. Ceruledge struggles with physical walls like Rotom-W and Great Tusk, as well as Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo. Choice Specs Iron Valiant has coverage for these foes, while Booster Energy variants threaten faster attackers like Roaring Moon and Dragapult. Mixed Garchomp puts pressure on most of Ceruledge’s checks, like Dondozo and Skeledirge, while luring in Corviknight so that Ceruledge can take advantage of its U-turn in order to activate Weak Armor. Corviknight itself is a good partner, as it is able to lure in Cinderace, another Pokemon Ceruledge can take advantage of, and pivot Ceruledge into battle safely. But, it can be a drain on momentum for more offensive teams. Ceruledge works well with hazard setters, as extra chip damage helps Ceruledge break foes like Garganacl and Rotom-W. In return, Ceruledge pressures Corviknight and can spinblock with its Ghost typing, but it doesn’t often do so due to bad matchups against common Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk. Examples of hazard-setting teammates include Great Tusk and Meowscarada, with the former being able to check Dark-types like Kingambit in the event Ceruledge cannot Terastallize, and the latter checking Rotom-W and Great Tusk.</p> "

By changing its typing to a more defense oriented one, while maintaining the Fire immunity thanks to Flash Fire, Ceruledge can set up Bulk Ups on a variety of common Pokemon, ranging from Corviknight, Kingambit, Azumarill and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt lets Ceruledge set up Bulk Up without needing to fear common phasing moves (with the exception of attacking moves such as Dragon Tail), as well as opposing setup moves such opposing Bulk Up and Iron Defense, provided you outspeed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Sneak</strong> Priority of some form is always nice to have on a Pokemon, which makes Shadow Sneak an easy contender for the last move. Gaining extra added strength against Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Dragapult and Annihilape is certainly charming.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass Tera Blast: This allows Ceruledge to eliminate Dondozo more quickly. While Taunt can shut down Dondozo's Yawn, it cannot shut down Fissure. The only way to beat Dondozo would be to eliminate it as quickly as possibly, which Grass Tera Blast aids with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flame Charge: Flame Charge provides Ceruledge an extra net of safety against potential Scarf users and Annihilape, who are capable of turning the tides against it. While normally, Ceruledge is prone to faster Taunt + Bulk Up users and Scarfed Trick, Flame Charge helps mitigate both of those weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Ceruledge can be a status spreader in games where it can't set up as easily. It also helps Ceruledge set up more easily against threats such as Unaware Clodsire.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: Tera Fairy helps Ceruledge's matchup against prominent Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass: An immunity to Spore and a resistance to Water makes Grass the most notable Tera type for this set. Flash Fire eliminating one of Grass's many weaknesses is also noteworthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Increasing Bitter Blade's power will always be a valuable trait. Eliminating Ghost's weaknesses to Ghost and Dark also allows Ceruledge to set up more comfortably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Tera Bug is similar to Tera Grass, but in exchange for losing the Water resistance and maintaining the Rock weakness of Fire / Ghost, Ceruledge can tank Volcarona's Bug Buzz with significantly more ease.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def with Impish: Investing into Defense prepares Ceruledge and its mediocre physical bulk for the physical-biased metagame. Bulk Up will boost its Defense, but it can struggle to take some physical hits even after a boost, and its special bulk is naturally high.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: A faster spread helps Ceruledge outspeed other Bulk Up users, like Annihilape opting to invest in bulk. Being faster, more often than not, lets Ceruledge win these matchups with ease.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: While most threats in the metagame at the moment are physical, a specially defensive spread is still noteworthy for its ability to surprise Hydreigon.</p> </li> </ul> "

If Ceruledge is brought down to 1 HP, a +2 Bitter Blade can heal it to the point that it can tank an extra attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Shadow Claw</strong>: Close Combat hits the Normal-, Dark-, and Rock-types that resist Ceruledge's STAB combination. Still, Shadow Claw is a noteworthy choice to guarantee the KO on Mimikyu and let Ceruledge pressure Skeledirge. Note, however, that maximum Defense Skeledirge can recover more than Shadow Claw's damage, barring critical hits, and a Terastallized Skeledirge can completely wall this set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance versus Destiny Bond: As powerful as Swords Dance boosted attacks from Ceruledge are, the abundance of Unaware Pokemon, primarily Dondozo, has made some players opt to use Destiny Bond to snag surprise kills. Destiny Bond can also make the matchup against KOing common Sucker Punch Pokemon, such as Meowscarada and Kingambit, easier to win without having to rely on predictions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly: Adamant's added damage output is valuable, but Jolly allows Ceruledge to outspeed non-Scarf Gholdengo, and gives it a chance at outspeeding Modest Rotom formes and Glimmora. All of the mentioned examples are Special Attackers, meaning Ceruledge's Weak Armor often does not trigger in these matchups.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire: Giving Bitter Blade an extra push in damage is quite useful, giving Ceruledge more recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Normal is an exceedingly common Tera Type on Ghost types due to the immunity it brings to the table. Ceruledge makes particularly excellent use of Normal Tera by resisting both Steel and Fairy, making it very difficult for Gholdengo and Mimikyu to click anything other than a Ghost type move when facing off against Ceruledge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Giving extra reach pwer to Close Combat, a powerful option against Pokemon such as Hydreigon, makes Fighting a solid choice for a Tera Type.</p> </li> </ul> "

Close Combat is Ceruledge's preferred coverage move, dealing with checks like Roaring Moon, Garchomp, and Well-Baked Body Corviknight at +2. Solar Blade is used to hit Water-types like Dondozo and Quaquaval, as well as being Ceruledge's best option into Well-Baked Body Landorus-T. Will-O-Wisp allows Ceruledge to cripple long-term checks like Toxapex and Regenerator Garchomp. Adamant is the more common nature for the power, but a Jolly nature gets the jump on maximum Speed Slither Wing and Heatran. Ceruledge fits well with partners like Kilowattrel and Zapdos, which appreciate shared checks like Roaring Moon and Garchomp being lured in and removed or crippled; in return, they pivot in Ceruledge on their switch-ins like Meloetta and Volt Absorb Corviknight. Ceruledge is threatened by Dark- and Ground-types, even ones it can burn, like Hydreigon and Donphan. As such, partners that can switch into them, like Tinkaton and Quaquaval, are heavily recommended. Abilities that grant Fire immunities are common on Pokemon like Zapdos and Landorus-T, which Ceruledge struggles to deal with; thus, having a partner than can threaten them, like Chien-Pao or Meowscarada, is useful.</p> "

With rain support, Thunder can be used as Kilowattrel's hard-hitting STAB attack to hit Pokemon—such as Toxapex—that Flying teams can struggle to take down. Thunderbolt is a fine substitute on Flying teams that do not utilize rain. Volt Switch allows Kilowattrel to pivot, making use of Kilowattrel's high Speed tier to get off damage while not being Choice locked. Hurricane couples with the preceding moves to cover Kilowattrel's STAB combination, specifically hitting Ground-types such as Quagsire and Gastrodon. The last slot depends on whether rain is being taken advantage of: on rain teams, Weather Ball can be used to hit Ground-types such as Unaware Clodsire, while Air Slash is another option for non-rain teams that can make up for Hurricane's lower accuracy. Choice Specs allows Kilowattrel to hit extremely hard, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Azumarill with Volt Switch and Amoonguss with Hurricane. Volt Absorb provides the only Electric immunity for Flying-type teams.</p> <p>Corviknight is one of Kilowattrel's greatest assets; beyond providing a neutral switch-in to Ice-type attacks—especially in the cases of Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Greninja—Corviknight provides a physical wall that Kilowattrel can pivot into. It is also Flying's most common Defogger, which is essential, as Kilowattrel is susceptible to Stealth Rock damage, hindering its pivoting. Pelipper is very useful in supporting Kilowattrel, as rain support ensures accuracy of Kilowattrel's Thunder and Hurricane, and U-turn on Pelipper ensures safe pivoting. Talonflame is another defensive supporter, covering Kilowattrel's weakness to Ice-types and offering another Defogger. Dragonite hits the specially defensive walls that Kilowattrel struggles with such as Clodsire and Blissey. Gyarados finds great support from Kilowattrel; as Kilowattrel punches holes in defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Toxapex, Gyarados will have a better chance to sweep late-game. While Kilowattrel has excellent Speed itself, Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo and Salamence can revenge kill Pokemon such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane that outspeed Kilowattrel. Bombirdier offers Stealth Rock support and uses Knock Off to remove key items such as Leftovers on Gastrodon, which puts it into 2HKO range of Hurricane after Stealth Rock damage.</p> "

Another great application of this combination is against spin blockers such as Ceruledge, Skeledirge and Gholdengo, which are all threatened to Tera or switch out by Earth Power, letting Toedscruel Rapid Spin.

Kingambit is a great choice for dealing with Meowscarada, as it resists Leaf Storm and Knock off and can threaten it with a powerful Low Kick or Iron Head without fear of Taunt.

          "description": "<p>Klawf is an amazing defensive wall, offering utility through Stealth Rock and Knock Off, being very hard to wear down thanks to Regenerator, and using it's solid bulk and typing to check common threats such as Skuntank and Charizard. When compared to other Rock-type walls like Carbink and Hisuian Avalugg, which offer higher bulk and hazard control like Spikes and Rapid Spin, Klawf's Knock Off, Regenerator, and overall versatility are what make it the preferred option on many teams. Furthermore, Klawf's Regenerator and Heavy-Duty Boots give it more longevity than other Knock Off users like Tinkatuff and Thwackey. Klawf's STAB move of choice isn't overly important and can be chosen between Stone Edge for more power and Rock Slide for more reliability. Swords Dance helps with the lack of Attack investment and makes Klawf a larger offensive threat. High Horsepower provides coverage for Steel-types like Perrserker and Tinkatuff and various other targets like Skuntank and Raichu. Klawf's naturally high Defense allows it to invest into Special Defense, making it a mixed wall and improving its ability to check special threats like Pyroar and Haunter. 232 HP EVs maximize Klawf's recovery from Regenerator while lessening damage from Skuntank and Electrode's Aftermath and hazards if Heavy-Duty Boots is removed. 56 Speed EVs alongside Jolly nature allow Klawf to outspeed 252 Speed Cacturne and uninvested Lumineon. That being said, Klawf's EV spread and nature are very flexible, and you can choose to invest into Defense to make it a dedicated physical wall, running Careful nature to further improve its special bulk while still outspeeding Tinkatuff and max Speed Perrserker, or go down a more offensive route with max Attack. Dragon is Klawf's preferred Tera type, losing its weaknesses to Water- and Grass types like Basculin and Thwackey while being a great defensive typing overall. But its Tera type is also flexible, such as Tera Ground for a Volt Switch immunity and STAB High Horsepower, Tera Ghost to spinblock and gain a Fighting immunity, and Tera Flying to gain resistance to moves like like Alolan Dugtrio's Earthquake, Cacturne's Giga Drain, and Charizard's Focus Blast.</p> <p>Klawf's utility and versatility make it viable on virtually any archetype. With Klawf being the best Knock Off user in a metagame full of Heavy Duty-Boots users and not much of hazard removal, it pairs greatly with other hazard setters. Spikes Whiscash is a common partner for Klawf because of this while also forming a great defensive core with Klawf to check threats like Perrserker and Gabite. Swalot, Mareanie, and Skuntank can set Toxic Spikes to slowly stall foes out while checking Grass-types like Gogoat and offering other utility like Toxic, Encore, Taunt, and Haze. Mareanie is also notable, since it forms a Regenerator core with Klawf. Finally, in terms of hazards, Knock Off paired with Masquerain's Sticky Web makes it easier for setup sweepers like double dance Wyrdeer and Nasty Plot Haunter to sweep. Fast teammates like Pyroar, support Alolan Persian, and the previously mentioned setup sweepers also appreciate Knock Off removing any Choice Scarfs, making them harder to revenge kill. The former two also offer support with Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Thunder Wave. Alolan Persian's Parting Shot and other pivots like Rotom-F and Electrode give Klawf more opportunities to come in and switch out to activate Regenerator. Grass-types like Gogoat and Leafeon check Water-types like Basculin and Golduck, while Klawf checks Flying- and Fire-types like Charizard and Pyroar for them. Leafeon's Wish also improves Klawf's longevity, as do other clerics like Heal Bell Chansey and Wish Komala.</p> "

Growth is run for Scovillain to boost its damage output while under sun, letting it secure KOs more easily. Giga Drain threatens Pokemon like Ting-Lu, allowing Scovillain's teammates to break through them late-game, and it also aids in improving Scovillain's longevity by recovering its HP. Fire Blast can be used to have a chance of 2HKOing Skeledirge and Clodsire under sun, but Flamethrower is the preferred Fire-type STAB move, since its accuracy is higher than Fire Blast's. Stomping Tantrum hits opposing Fire-types such as Iron Moth. Solar Beam is an alternative to Stomping Tantrum, OHKOing the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Toxapex after Growth in sun. Life Orb and 32 Attack EVs maximize Scovillain's power, letting it 2HKO specially defensive Clodsire with Stomping Tantrum after Stealth Rock damage. If opting for Solar Beam, the remaining EVs go into HP. A Naive nature allows Scovillain to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Great Tusk and Iron Moth under sun while not losing out on Stomping Tantrum damage.</p> <p>Torkoal is a mandatory partner for Scovillain, as its ability to set up sun allows Scovillain to outspeed many faster threats like Iron Treads, Iron Jugulis, and Quaquaval, dealing heavy chip damage or outright KOing them. Scovillain appreciates Torkoal getting rid of entry hazards; in return, Scovillain deals with Water- and Ground-types like Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Sandy Shocks. Paldean Tauros-F is a great offensive partner for Scovillain, granting benefits such as breaking dual screens from Pokemon like Klefki and Grimmsnarl, which impede Scovillain's sweeping ability. Paldean Tauros-F is also able to check specially defensive walls like Blissey; in return, Scovillain breaks past bulky Water-types like Slowking and Toxapex after one Growth under sun. Cinderace can offer alternate entry hazard removal with Court Change, which helps Scovillain's longevity. Furthermore, Cinderace's Speed tier allows it to handle offensive Pokemon that naturally outpace Scovillain outside of sun like Hydreigon and Iron Treads, the former of which Scovillain cannot hit neutrally. Scovillain also appreciates Volcarona as an offensive partner thanks to its non-weather-reliant sweeping potential in Quiver Dance, dealing with Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Garchomp, while Scovillain can weaken Volcarona's checks like Ting-Lu, Unaware Clodsire, and Toxapex throughout the course of the game.</p> "

It's notably also strong enough to score a 2HKO on physically defensive Toxapex after minimal chip damage, allowing Scovillain to beat Poison teams if it hits every move. Alternatively, Overheat has better accuracy and still 2HKOes Skeledirge and Clodsire, but the Special Attack drop makes it less spammable. Giga Drain threatens a 2HKO on Pelipper, which may be tempted to come into Scovillain to block Solar Beam, and also provides Scovillain a form of recovery. A Timid nature lets it outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Gengar and Protosynthesis-boosted Choice Specs Walking Wake to burn them to a crisp, while a Modest nature has better odds of 2HKOing Toxapex with Giga Drain and OHKOing Baxcalibur with Flamethrower at the cost of outspeeding only up to non-Speed boosting Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks.</p> <p>Torkoal is a mandatory teammate, as it sets sun, which Scovillain needs to boost its Speed with Chlorophyll, and provides entry hazard support with its ability to set Stealth Rock and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Other forms of entry hazard support in Defog Talonflame and Court Change Cinderace are also appreciated; they also have access to U-turn, which allows Scovillain to get in more times to wallbreak. Ceruledge packs Shadow Sneak to deal with Flutter Mane, which otherwise outspeeds and dispatches Scovillain with ease. In return, Scovillain obliterates bulky Unaware walls like Quagsire, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, all of which hinder Swords Dance Ceruledge from cutting down Water and Ghost teams. Similarly, Volcarona and Iron Moth love Scovillain's ability to eliminate bulky walls like Clodsire and Ting-Lu, allowing them to clean up Poison and Ground teams late-game. Skeledirge deals with Kingambit and Choice Scarf Meowscarada, which threaten Scovillain with priority or by outspeeding it and picking it off.</p> "

Most notably, its ability to defeat most Pokemon, even powerful Dragon-types, without fearing surprise Terastallizations makes Scovillain a charming offensive option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Overheat and Fire Blast</strong>: Overheat combined with Tera Fire and Choice Specs guarantees the KO on Garchomp  without bulk EVs, and OHKO offensive Roaring Moon after Stealth Rock damage. Against the frailer Dragapult, Tera Fire and Fire Blast is enough to earn the KO. It's recommended to run both Fire STAB moves because Overheat's added damage can be necessary to guarantee certain KOs, but its stat drop can be fatal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Solar Beam versus Leaf Storm: Solar Beam nails the few bulky Water-types that can survive Scovillain's absurd attacks, most notable examples being notably Gastrodon and Assault Vest Azumarill. However, Leaf Storm can be used in its stead for the ability to OHKO Hippowdon, despite it summoning sand.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower: Flamethrower is perfectly accurateand is typically more than enough to nip off frailer foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: In spite of the type matchup, Scovillain is deceptively weak to Kingambit thanks to Sucker Punch. Additionally, many Pokemon will use Protect in front of Scovillain to waste sun turns— most notably Espathra and Dondozo. Against all of these foes, a well-timed Substitute can guarantee the win.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire: It is almost mandatory to run Tera Fire on this Scovillain set. Tera Fire guarantees KOs on most Dragon-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: The abundantly common Dragonite is incredibly strong against Scovillain. Should Stealth Rock support be deemed enough to let Scovillain sweep teams reasonably, even without Tera Fire, using Tera Ghost to gain an immunity to Extreme Speed can be very useful.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock: Tera Rock with Tera Blast can be a decent alternative to Tera Fire, as it gives Scovillain excellent coverage and also provides a much-needed countermeasure to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> </li> </ul> "

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>The metagame's abundance of Unaware Pokemon makes it difficult to maneuver Moody Pokemon in general. On top of that, Scovillain is held back by the powerful Dragon-types that resist its STAB combination. However, Scovillain still carves a niche for itself by being the only Moody Pokemon with excellent recovery moves, Leech Seed and Ingrain, allowing it to win a variety of matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect and Substitute</strong>: Protect and Substitute are mandatory to get the most opportunities to activate Moody. Once you gain enough Defense or Special Defense boosts that Scovillain's Substitute can tank an attack without breaking, it tends to be easy to win the game. Note, however, that Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers's animation make Scovillain very vulnerable to losing via timer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: With enough Moody boosts, Scovillain's Flamethrower tends to be enough to break through an entire team. There are very few Pokemon that are immune or quadruply resistant to Fire, and Flamethrower has good PP and accuracy, which makes it an easy pick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: Unlike Flamethrower, Giga Drain gets shrugged off by a lot of Pokemon, even at +6, notably Corviknight and Dragonite. However, an attacking move that helps recover HP lost from Substitutes gives Scovillain more mileage off of Moody. Giga Drain is also notable to more reliably defeat Dondozo, one of the Unaware Pokemon that would give Scovillain a lot of trouble otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leech Seed: Leech Seed combined with Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers helps Scovillain restore HP while collecting Moody boosts, as well as chipping Pokemon it'd otherwise have trouble against, such as Clodsire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain: Ingrain is an alternative recovery option that makes Scovillain impervious to phazing moves. When purely considering recovery, it's more reliable than the inaccurate 90% accurate Leech Seed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast with Tera Fairy is an excellent option that helps remedy Scovillain's Dragon susceptibility, particularly making the Infiltrator Dragapult and Roaring Moon matchup easier.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Water: The Water resistance helps Scovillain beat Dondozo. Even though Dondozo ignores Scovillain's Defense boosts via Unaware, with Tera Water, Scovillain's Substitute can tank a Wave Crash. Tera Water also keeps the Scovillain's Steel resistance, unlike Tera Grass, which makes it easier to check Scizor—a common priority user that people attempt to use to check Moody Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: Tera Fairy mitigating Scovillain's weakness to Dragon-types is massively helpful.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>180 HP / 220 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 100 Spe with Bold</strong>: This spread bolsters Scovillain’s physical bulk. Notably, Tera Water Scovillain's Substitute manages to survive Dondozo's Wave Crash with this spread. The Speed allows Scovillain to outspeed slow Baxcalibur and Gholdengo, as well as Dragapult with one Moody Speed boost. The HP is adjusted to make maximum use of Leftovers, with the resulting stat having a remainder of 1 when divided by 16. The remaining EVs are split between Special Attack and Special Defense because, at level 50, investing 8 EVs in either stat has no benefit over investing 4.</li> </ul> "

Psyshock takes precedence over Psychic, as it allows Rabsca to pressure specially defensive foes like Articuno and setup sweepers like Calm Mind Misdreavus; it also lets Rabsca deal considerably more damage to Crabominable. Earth Power deals considerable damage to Skuntank, Pyroar, Alolan Dugtrio, and Tinkatuff and complements Psyshock by pressuring targets like Iron Defense Carbink. Bug Buzz is Rabsca's best move to pressure foes like Gogoat and Alolan Persian. Recover allows Rabsca to mitigate entry hazard chip damage as well as to play a more active role during early-game as a switch-in to targets like Indeedee-F and Raichu, although forgoing Bug Buzz notably leaves it unable to hit Honchkrow and limits its ability to check Gogoat. Life Orb greatly increases Rabsca's damage output, notably allowing it to OHKO targets like Skuntank and Crabominable before Terastallizing, as well as 2HKO specially defensive Articuno after slight chip damage. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used for easier setup and more reliable checking of targets, like Carbink, should Rabsca choose to run Recover, but it usually prefers the increased damage output. Tera Ground and Tera Bug can be used to boost Earth Power and Bug Buzz's damage output, respectively; they also notably ease its ability to set up on Misdreavus, which otherwise threatens it with Shadow Ball or Hex, as well as prevent Skuntank and Honchkrow's Sucker Punch from prematurely ending its sweep. Tera Psychic is less reliable, as it limits Rabsca's setup opportunities, but it is otherwise effective for beating Articuno. A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs allow Rabsca to outspeed the entire metagame, aside from other dedicated Trick Room attackers like Crabominable and Camerupt, while Trick Room is active.</p> <p>Rabsca works best as a late-game sweeper, making it a good fit on offensive teams that can wear opposing Pokemon down throughout the match and take care of Pokemon like Misdreavus and Alolan Persian that can make Rabsca's job of setting up with Trick Room difficult. Pivots like Alolan Persian, Rotom-F, and Articuno can create safe switch-in opportunities for Rabsca if it is needed to check a target early-game or set up late-game. Bulky Alolan Persian can switch into Pokemon that threaten Rabsca out like Lycanroc-N, and it appreciates Rabsca pressuring foes like Dachsbun and Tinkatuff for it. Rotom-F and Articuno appreciate Recover variants of Rabsca, which are able to check Carbink, and in return, they can pressure threats like Masquerain and Misdreavus for it. Raichu, as well as Tinkatuff, can create setup opportunities for Rabsca with Encore; the latter is especially notable for making Rabsca's late-game cleaning easier by accelerating the opposing team being worn down by hazards with Knock Off. Indeedee-F can form an efficient Psychic-type core with Rabsca, and it notably gives Life Orb variants optimal entry with Healing Wish as well as boosting Psyshock and blocking priority from Pokemon like Skuntank and Basculin with Psychic Terrain. Crabominable greatly appreciates Recover variants' ability to check Carbink, and it can make use of leftover Trick Room turns to wallbreak. Hazard removers like Dartrix and Quaxwell can ease Life Orb variants' task of setting up late-game without relying on recovery.</p> "

Substitute blocks status moves such as Clodsire and Toxapex's Toxic, and it makes Espathra harder to revenge kill. Protect allows Espathra to accumulate a turn of Leftovers recovery and a Speed increase from Speed Boost, which also boosts Stored Power. Electric Seed increases Espathra's Defense, complementing Calm Mind's Special Defense boosts, and contributes towards Stored Power's Base Power. Leftovers synergizes with Substitute and Protect by providing passive recovery. Tera Fairy lets Espathra resist Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao and Kingambit and boosts Dazzling Gleam. Tera Fighting similarly provides a resistance to Dark-type attacks, in addition to making Tera Blast useful, at the cost of leaving Espathra completely reliant on Terastallizing to hit Dark-types.

Alternatively, Leftovers in conjunction with Substitute and Roost or Protect lets Espathra safely get Speed boosts while also being able to scout foes' moves. 44 Speed EVs let Espathra outspeed Dragapult at +1 Speed, while the rest are placed into HP and Defense, giving Espathra bulk to set up with ease against Physical Attackers such as Garchomp, Great Tusk and Corviknight.</p> <p>Espathra appreciates teammates that can accentuate its offensive prowess. Scream Tail can set dual screens and paralyze opponents with Thunder Wave to make setting up easie while also setting Stealth Rock and can even Wish pass to Espathra. Gallade, along with Scream Tail with the set of Substitute, Bulk Up, Drain Punch and Play Rough can also punish Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Kingambit. Iron Leaves can beat Barraskewda under rain, which otherwise outspeeds Espathra even at +2 Speed. Iron Leaves also beats bulky Ground-types like Ting-Lu, which could phaze Espathra with Whirlwind, or Clodsire and Quagsire, both of which would require a lot of boosts to break with Stored Power. Indeedee is a Ghost-type switch-in and sets up Psychic Terrain for Espathra, protecting it from priority attacks like Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch. Indeedee is also able to Healing Wish to give Espathra a second chance to sweep. Stored Power Armarouge forms a dangerous core with Espathra, which can break for Espathra, clean after it, and also beat Steel teams. Hatterene bounces back entry hazards for Espathra if it forgoes Heavy-Duty Boots while also beating Dark- and Dragon-types. Chilly Reception Slowking can pivot to Espathra safely while acting as a sponge for hits.</p> "

However, it can be passive at times, is unable to cripple Electric-type Pokemon such as Raichu and Electrode, and is heavily reliant on Eviolite for its bulk. Tinkatuff's abilities as a Stealth Rock setter are complemented by Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots of common switch-ins to it like Charizard and Pyroar, greatly hindering their longevity. Knock Off can also cripple the most common hazard removers, Dartrix and Quaxwell, both of which greatly rely on their Eviolite. Encore is used to halt setup sweepers like Gogoat, Carbink, and Masquerain, letting a teammate threaten them out. Rest can also be run to ensure that Tinkatuff is a long-term switch-in to Pokemon like Indeedee-F, Alolan Persian, and Skuntank; however, this forces Tinkatuff to remain immobile for multiple turns, compounding its issues with passivity. Mold Breaker is used for two niche applications: removing items from Sticky Hold Swalot and paralyzing a Terastallized Raichu with Thunder Wave. A specially defensive spread makes Tinkatuff a better switch-in to Pokemon like Nasty Plot Skuntank, Haunter, and Alolan Persian. However, a physically defensive spread of 252 HP/ 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature is also an option to switch into threats like Lycanroc-N and Daschbun more consistently. Tera Water allows Tinkatuff to check the various Fire- and Water-types in the tier such as Charizard, Pyroar, and Golduck more reliably; Tera Dragon does the same but trades a weakness towards Electric-types like Electrode and Raichu for one against Dragon-types like Drakloak and Flapple.</p> <p>Tinkatuff struggles heavily with strong physical attackers like Basculin and Crabominable, so Pokemon that can cover for them are necessary. Mareanie is adept at switching into both of these threats as well as others that threaten Tinkatuff, like Perrserker and Falinks; in return, Tinkatuff can switch into threatening Psychic- and Electric-types like Indeedee-F and Electrode. Misdreavus is also a solid choice, switching into many annoying Ground-types like Dugtrio and Gabite while checking Fire-types like Charizard and Pyroar in a pinch. It also heavily benefits from Tinkatuff spreading paralysis, powering up its Hex. Rock- and Water-types like Carbink and Whiscash are sturdier switch-ins to the Fire-types that threaten out Tinkatuff, which it appreciates. Gabite is also a strong partner for Tinkatuff, checking strong Fire-types like Houndoom and Camerupt for Tinkatuff while appreciating Tinkatuff running Stealth Rock and removing opposing Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off so it can rack up chip damage on the opposing team quickly with Dragon Tail sets.</p> "

It’s a good Stealth Rock setter due to its typing letting it set up on Tyranitar, Grafaiai, and Scream Tail. Knock Off removes crucial items such as Talonflame's Heavy-Duty Boots and Bisharp's Eviolite. Encore shuts down setup sweepers such as Quiver Dance Oricorio-E and can lock Quagsire and Gastrodon into Toxic, Ice Beam, and Recover. Thunder Wave can catch Talonflame attempting to switch into it to clear Stealth Rock, but Encore is more consistent overall. Mold Breaker lets Tinkaton ignore Mimikyu's Disguise, letting it force progress on offensive teams. Tera Dark allows Tinkaton to better check Gengar while giving Knock Off a boost. Tera Ghost turns Tinkaton into an emergency check to Slither Wing and Lucario while also spinblocking against Tatsugiri. However, it's not recommended to use since it makes it weak to Pokemon that it is supposed to check such as Gengar and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Utility Tinkaton fits on every single playstyle except hyper offense thanks to its good typing and movepool. Spikes users like Quagsire and Gastrodon can form entry hazard stack cores with Tinkaton while also handling Pawmot, Quaquaval, Scizor, and non-Tera Grass Sandy Shocks. Quagsire is able to spread Toxic against hazard removers such as Defog Talonflame and Donphan, while Tinkaton can use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from Salamence and Wo-Chien to wear down foes further. Gengar is a fantastic partner, since Tinkaton is able to handle opposing Gengar and Grafaiai for it and remove Gastrodon's Heavy-Duty Boots. This helps Gengar break down Gastrodon more easily without having to use Energy Ball. Hippowdon appreciates Tinkaton running Stealth Rock and checking Decideueye, allowing it to run both Stone Edge and Roar. In return, it checks Pokemon that take advantage of Tinkaton, such as Sandy Shocks and Iron Jugulis.</p> "

Tera Ground lets Bombirdier block Volt Switch from Rotom and resist Haunter's Sludge Bomb, which can translate to a surprise OHKO against both foes.</p> <p>Electric-types like Eelektross, Rotom, and Jolteon are among the biggest threats to Bombirdier and should be accounted for when using it. Grass-types like Appletun and Lurantis are very sturdy checks to such Pokemon, while Ground-types like Sandaconda can block Volt Switch. Fighting-types like Toxicroak and Paldean Tauros can easily set up on Bombirdier, so it appreciates having partners like Sandaconda, Drifblim, and Bruxish that can check them. In return, Bombirdier scares out Grass- and Dark-types like Lurantis and Cacturne. Some Pokemon that Bombirdier can check like Mabosstiff, Farigiraf, and Indeedee-F pack super effective coverage for it, so backup checks to them like Qwilfish, Muk, and Chansey are important to have. Additional pivots, such as Passimian and Eelektross, help maintain momentum alongside Bombirdier and love having their switch-ins worn down by Knock Off and Stealth Rock.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Bombirdier is a great dedicated entry hazard lead due to the incredibly deep utility movepool. Stealth Rock and Taunt are a classic staple for any dedicated lead, quickly setting up hazards while preventing the opponent from removing them or setting up their own. Bombirdier makes great use of its STAB Knock Off to deal a decent chunk of damage before going down while also hindering the longevity of the many Flying-type Defog users like Braviary, Drifblim, and Scyther by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Memento is an amazing move for Bombirdier, facilitating the hyper offensive teams it's commonly found on. Memento can block an incoming Defog, but its main purpose is to allow for easy setup of an ally like Lilligant or Hisuian Sneasel against a weakened foe. Rock Blast allows Bombirdier to get the edge on opposing dedicated leads like Bombirdier and Froslass, breaking their Focus Sash and potentially OHKOing them. Tera Ghost simply blocks Rapid Spin, namely from the likes of Cryogonal and Avalugg, both of which also greatly dislike having their Heavy-Duty Boots removed and taking powerful Rock-type attacks. Tera Ground lets Bombirdier potentially block an Electric-type attack; OHKOing Rotom with Knock Off or heavily damaging Eelektross could be crucial for Bombirdier's teammates, but as a dedicated lead, Bombirdier will not be Terastallizing often because it is best reserved for its offensive teammates.</p> <p>As mentioned, Bombirdier is often relegated to hyper offensive teams, which make the most use out of the hazards and momentum generated by it. Fast setup sweepers like Lilligant, Hisuian Sneasel, and Vivillon all greatly appreciate both the entry hazard support and the setup opportunity granted through Memento. Bombirdier can be coupled with a dedicated Froslass lead, which can set Spikes and double up the entry hazards and support for the team, although Froslass is also direct competition for Bombirdier's role. Faster Taunt users like Pyroar and Qwilfish can shut down Bombirdier but must be wary of Bombirdier's attacks. Bombirdier is often dealt with by physical walls like Sandaconda and Qwilfish; using Knock Off to remove their Rocky Helmet and weaken them greatly assists physical sweepers like Hisuian Sneasel, Scyther, and Tauros.</p> "

U-turn breaks Focus Sash and deals some damage, while Parting Shot lets other offensive teammates hit the field more comfortably and avoids contact with the opposing Pokemon. Bombirdier has access to some of the best offensive STAB moves in the game, with the highly coveted Knock Off, high-Base Power Brave Bird, and Rocky Payload-boosted Rock-type moves.</p> <p>Other useful options would be to use Stone Edge as a Rock-type pseudo-STAB attack; it has more power than Rock Blast but comes with more risk due to its lower accuracy. Additionally, Memento is an option over Parting Shot, which would further weaken an enemy to allow for a safer setup turn with a sweeper like Dudunsparce or Veluza. With this set, the Tera Dark is recommended to increase the damage of Knock Off; Tera Rock can also be considered, but most of the time, if you want to deal damage, Knock Off is more reliable. Brave Bird, the second STAB move, is another spammable option that helps Bombirdier deal with Fighting-type Pokemon that can take Dark and Rock moves, like Paldean Tauros and Toxicroak. With Choice Band, Bombirdier can deal some real damage off its great Attack stat.</p> <p>As for teammates, we have some options. Sandaconda its a good option because of its Electric immunity, and Parting Shot can help it boost up safety. Setup sweepers like Bruxish, Lilligant, and Farigiraf greatly benefit from Bombirdier's Parting Shot and Knock Off weakening the opposition. To continue the pivot partners, Scyther and Choice Scarf Rotom make a solid VoltTurn core with Bombirdier. Due to its Stealth Rock weakness, Bombirdier appreciates entry hazard removal from Braviary and Cryogonal.</p> "

Flip Turn allows Palafin to generate momentum for its team by pivoting out on its checks, bar Clodsire, to bring in a teammate that can threaten them. Zen Headbutt 2HKOes Toxapex, OHKOes Clodsire, and OHKOes Koraidon after one layer of Spikes. Jet Punch is a useful tool that can deal with faster offensive Pokemon such as Tera Fairy Miraidon, Chien-Pao, Great Tusk, and Flutter Mane, turning Palafin into a potent cleaner late-game.

Pelipper is an excellent partner for Palafin, as it sets rain and checks Koraidon—whose sun weakens Palafin's Water-type moves. Miraidon is another good teammate, as it threatens the bulky Water-types that check Palafin, such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Dondozo, and safely brings in Palafin via U-turn, while Palafin threatens Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Iron Treads for Miraidon. Similarly, Iron Bundle can pivot Palafin in with U-turn and target Water-types for it with Freeze Dry while Palafin threatens special walls for Iron Bundle. Iron Bundle also offensively checks faster Pokemon that resist Water like Miraidon and Koraidon for Palafin, and it benefits from the rain support Palafin is often paired with. Palafin also appreciates being paired with checks to Miraidon, Iron Bundle, and Walking Wake—which resist Jet Punch and OHKO Palafin in return—such as Iron Treads, specifically for the former, and Clodsire and Blissey for all three. Dugtrio can also be utilized to trap Clodsire and Toxapex as well as faster threats such as Miraidon and Koraidon, freeing up Palafin to wallbreak with its most common defensive checks removed and without fear of being revenge killed.</p> "

Jet Punch circumvents common speed control and is threatening against the frailer metagame, notably OHKOing Chi-Yu and Landorus at +1. Drain Punch is a reliable means of recovery in addition to Leftovers while also hitting popular Dark-types like Kingambit and Chien-Pao, as well as common Water-resistant or immune foes such as Rillaboom and Volcanion harder. Tera Grass provides an immunity to Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, as well as resistances to Grass- and Electric-type attacks such as Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Iron Hands's Wild Charge, which would otherwise OHKO Palafin. Palafin's base forme has poor damage output and bulk, so it is often ideal for it to lead and pivot out immediately to activate Zero to Hero. This is so crucial to Palafin's functioning that it is very telegraphed and easily exploitable with powerful attacks directed at it. To cover for this, Palafin may lead together with a Fake Out user or a redirector to reduce incoming damage. Bulk Up Palafin pairs well with partners that can remove Psychic Terrain, use Fake Out to generate free turns for Palafin to set up, and extend Palafin's longevity. Rillaboom fulfills all of these roles, with Grassy Terrain granting additional passive recovery. Cresselia is another good partner, as its Lunar Blessing heals Palafin and cures burn and poison, which would otherwise severely limit Palafin's offensive output or the turns it can stay on field. Amoonguss's Rage Powder redirects threatening attacks such as Iron Hands's Wild Charge, removes Toxic Spikes that reduce Palafin's longevity, and provides a major source of recovery for Palafin with Pollen Puff. Iron Hands is a Fake Out user whose Electric-type attacks eliminate opposing Water-types that resist Jet Punch. Grimmsnarl can also increase Palafin's bulk and create setup opportunities with its dual screens. As Amoonguss effortlessly walls Palafin and undoes its progress with Clear Smog, Palafin requires partners that deal with it effectively, like Heatran, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p> "

Choice Scarf is generally preferred, since it lets Cyclizar use Shed Tail on usually faster threats like Iron Bundle, non-Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon, Flutter Mane outside of sun, and Chien-Pao lacking Ice Shard. Sitrus Berry, especially when paired with dual screens, provides Cyclizar with a way to recover enough HP to use Shed Tail after taking a hit such as Great Tusk's Headlong Rush, Air Balloon Flutter Mane's Moonblast, or Miraidon's Dazzling Gleam. Tera Fairy lets Cyclizar use Shed Tail against the likes of Koraidon, Miraidon, and Great Tusk by providing a resistance to their Dragon- and Fighting-type coverage. Tera Ghost gives Cyclizar a Fighting-type immunity, granting it the ability to use Shed Tail in front of Choice Scarf Koraidon leads. Cyclizar supports its teammates on hyper offense teams by passing them a Substitute, which lets them avoid status and set up more easily, especially under dual screens. As such, Grimmsnarl is a great partner for making it easier for Cyclizar to pass Substitutes with Shed Tail and for teammates such as Swords Dance Koraidon and Double Dance Miraidon to set up and sweep. Espathra especially enjoys Shed Tail, as a Substitute and dual screens support gives it the longevity to reliably use Calm Mind multiple times. Taunt variants of Koraidon also appreciate Cyclizar using Shed Tail, as it can thwart phazing attempts from Ting-Lu and prevent Toxic Spikes—which bypasses Substitutes—being set up by Toxapex. Great Tusk and Annihilape are also good partners for Cyclizar. Bulk Up variants of Great Tusk are able to take on Koraidon and appreciate Substitute blocking Toxic, giving Great Tusk leeway to set up. Annihilape also appreciates Substitute preventing Toxic and is immune to Koraidon's Fighting-type STAB moves.</p> "

Shed Tail, when combined with Regenerator, causes Cyclizar to effectively only lose 27% of its HP every time it uses the move. This lets Cyclizar enable its powerful teammates multiple times throughout the game. Rapid Spin allows Cyclizar to act as an entry hazard removal option if it cannot set up Shed Tail. Draco Meteor is run over a secondary utility move to hit Baxcalibur and Hydreigon trying to set up on a predicted Shed Tail, but it can be dropped for another utility move. Additionally, Shed Tail allows Cyclizar to remove Draco Meteor's stat drops. Knock Off is useful for removing defensive items such as Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots, while Taunt stops any setup attempts from Quiver Dance Volcarona as well as preventing more than one layer of hazards from Ting-Lu. Finally, U-turn allows Cyclizar to keep momentum for its team while chipping the opponent and without having to use Shed Tail.</p> <p>Ursaluna is a great teammate for Cyclizar, as it can utilize Shed Tail to start setting up Swords Dance and activate Flame Orb safely. Additionally, Ursaluna's massive physical bulk means that defensive Pokemon such as Clodsire struggle to break Ursaluna's Substitute. Staraptor takes care of Fighting-types such as offensive Great Tusk and Zamazenta for Cyclizar while providing crucial speed control thanks to Choice Scarf. In return, Cyclizar provides an effective source of entry hazard control for Staraptor. Choice Scarf Indeedee also threatens Fighting-types while protecting Cyclizar from priority such as Breloom's Mach Punch thanks to Psychic Surge. Hisuian Zoroark can switch in on Fighting-type attacks thanks to its Ghost typing, allowing it to gain crucial momentum and deal with threats such as Urshifu-R. In exchange, Hisuian Zoroark appreciates a fairly safe switch-in opportunity as well as being able to gain pivotal turns to set up using Nasty Plot with Illusion disguising it. Maushold is another decent teammate for Cyclizar, as it can clean up games with Tidy Up and Population Bomb while appreciating Rocky Helmet being removed from foes thanks to Cyclizar's Knock Off. Tidy Up does remove Cyclizar's Shed Tail, however. Finally, Ditto can punish foes such as Swords Dance Chien-Pao and Quiver Dance Volcarona attempting to set up on a predicted Shed Tail by copying their boosts.</p> "

Mortal Spin's poison wears down entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and Hatterene looking to bounce back Stealth Rock over time. Steel-types like Iron Treads, Heatran, and Gholdengo can block Mortal Spin, so Earth Power is great, as it punishes these for switching into it; however, Stealth Rock is usually the better option, as it helps Poison teams wear down opposing teams more quickly. For similar reasons, Toxic is great for putting Steel-types, notably Corviknight, on a timer, and it also eases the Poison matchup, as Glimmora outspeeds and can inflict Toxic on the aforementioned walls before it faints. Power Gem prevents Glimmora from being too passive and lets it threaten non-Glaive Rush Baxcalibur if its Air Balloon is intact and Substitute + Bulk Up Corviknight. Energy Ball lets Glimmora threaten Water-types like Quagsire, which normally threatens it out. Maximum Special Attack and Speed boost Glimmora's offensive presence, allowing it to outspeed and possibly win against Gholdengo one-on-one with Earth Power. Air Balloon further increases Glimmora's utility, as it lets Gholdengo double as a switch-in to Choice-locked threats such as Great Tusk and Iron Jugulis, which tend to lock into a Ground-type move against Poison. Alternatively, Black Sludge along with a more defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 212 Def / 44 Spe and a Bold nature improves Glimmora's longevity, notably allowing it to survive a +2 Crunch from Chien-Pao and outspeed and inflict Toxic on Jolly Kingambit. If this is desired, Spiky Shield is a better option over Stealth Rock to further rack up recovery.</p> <p>As Glimmora's typing is horrible into types such as Water and Ground, Toxapex and Amoonguss are great partners, as both sponge hits from threats such as Barraskewda, Quagsire, and non-Choice Band Great Tusk with ease. Furthermore, these Pokemon allow Glimmora's Toxic to do its job and take out Bulk Up Corviknight, opposing Amoonguss, and Clodsire by completely walling them. Amoonguss in particular is great into Ground-types like Landorus-T, which Glimmora can't do much against. Alolan Muk provides a Psychic-type immunity and is an extremely bulky special wall that helps against Choice Specs Dragapult, Hatterene, and Flutter Mane. It also provides Knock Off support, which leaves walls such as Toxapex to be vulnerable to Glimmora's entry hazards. Clodsire provides Spikes, checks other special attackers such as Quiver Dance Volcarona, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Regieleki. Alternatively, Overqwil may also be considered as Glimmora's entry hazard stacking partner, as it can deal with Iron Valiant and Belly Drum Azumarill. Salazzle forms a Corrosion core with Glimmora and can land Toxic on threats such as Heatran, which loathe coming into Glimmora. It also provides Encore to neutralize Swords Dance Kingambit and Bulk Up Landorus-T and has access to Knock Off to further disrupt foes. Sneasler threatens Kingambit and loves Glimmora's ability to wear down walls like Toxapex and Corviknight and lure in Gholdengo and hit it with Toxic or Earth Power, allowing Sneasler to clean up Water and Steel teams late-game. Iron Moth also appreciates Glimmora wearing down teams with its entry hazards and dealing with Skeledirge; it is also the best response Poison teams have against Nasty Plot Gholdengo. Galarian Slowking is also an option, as it makes progress in the Poison matchup with Future Sight and retains the ability to pivot or damage with special attackers like Basculegion-F, Landorus, and Nasty Plot Rotom-W, but it can be quickly taken advantage of by the multitude of Dark- and Ghost-types in the tier.</p> "

It can make use of its solid coverage options and remarkable Special Attack to pose a noticeable offensive threat itself, especially against common entry hazard setters, removers, and other dedicated leads. Power Gem threatens the metagame's best Defogger in Tornadus-T, while Sludge Bomb dents screens setters such as Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko and—if Focus Sash is still intact—Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant as well, which can be problematic against offensive teams. Earth Power pressures Steel-types like Heatran, Gholdengo, and Kingambit that would otherwise block Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Energy Ball deals with other entry hazard setters and removers such as Great Tusk, Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Rotom-W. Focus Sash guarantees that Glimmora can set at least one layer of entry hazards, potentially letting Toxic Debris trigger twice as well. Tera Ghost is used in a pinch to spinblock foes such as Great Tusk and Excadrill and remove its Ground weakness to set up multiple entry hazards in the face of other setters like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gastrodon. Gholdengo is a near-mandatory teammate to keep up entry hazards by blocking every attempts to remove them, such as Defog and Rapid Spin. Setup sweepers like Kingambit, Volcarona, Dragapult, Dragonite, and Iron Valiant appreciate entry hazards wearing down foes such as Dondozo and Clodsire and not being chipped down by opposing ones themselves; particularly, Kingambit's Knock Off can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Volcarona to make them vulnerable to Glimmora's entry hazards.</p> "

Veluza is an excellent choice for hyper offense teams, where it acts as a deadly wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. Veluza can easily find setup opportunities against passive foes, such as Vaporeon, and Choice-locked foes, such as a Passimian that just used Close Combat. Although Veluza is extremely powerful after setting up, it may not always get the chance to do so due to its frailty. Veluza's defensive typing is also relatively poor; it is weak to common attacks, including pivoting moves like U-turn from Scyther and Volt Switch from Rotom. Furthermore, Veluza's speed and firepower are rather mediocre prior to setup.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Fillet Away is one of the best setup moves in the game, doubling Veluza's Speed and power at the cost of half its health. Aqua Cutter and Psycho Cut are both boosted by Sharpness, and after a Fillet Away will OHKO many neutral targets, such as Rotom, Mabosstiff, and Clawitzer. For Veluza's last move, Substitute can be used to ease prediction, facilitate setup, and avoid Sucker Punch. Aqua Jet can also be used to revenge kill weakened foes and, after setup, outprioritize other priority moves such as Lycanroc's Accelerock. Tera Blast is an option with Tera Fairy to blast past Cacturne, which otherwise completely walls it. Otherwise, Tera Water is good choice to further boost the power of Veluza's Aqua Cutter, giving it a guaranteed OHKO on specially defensive Umbreon after Stealth Rock. Sitrus Berry helps Veluza set up sucessfully, and 4 HP EVs ensure that it will activate after a Fillet Away. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize Veluza's damage output, but a Jolly nature enables Veluza to outspeed Timid Farigiraf prior to setup and Choice Scarf Zoroark post-setup.</p> <p>Veluza's incredible Speed and power after setup make it an excellent choice for hyper offense teams. Entry hazard support from Lycanroc and Qwilfish can help chip Veluza's checks into range of its attacks. Bulk Up Paldean Tauros is a great partner for Veluza, as it can easily switch into and set up against Pokemon that give Veluza trouble, such as Cacturne. In return, Veluza can set up on Pokemon used to revenge kill or force out Paldean Tauros, like a Choice Scarf Indeedee-F locked into Psychic or Psyshock. Paldean Tauros also helps Veluza break past shared walls in Vaporeon and Tera Water Sandaconda, enabling one of them to sweep late-game. Other good offensive partners to pair with Veluza include Jolteon and Quiver Dance Vivillon. Jolteon provides an Electric immunity for the team while also giving Veluza points of entry through Volt Switch. Vivillon threatens Cacturne, and its Sleep Powder may cripple one of Veluza's checks, allowing it to sweep. Indeedee-F is another good teammate for Veluza, as Psychic Terrain shields Veluza from priority attacks, such as Sucker Punch, while boosting the power of Psycho Cut to absurd levels.</p> "

Liquidation is Dondozo's STAB move of choice due to its lack of recoil, but Wave Crash's power has some merit against foes like Ting-Lu, Skeledirge, and Clodsire. While weaker, Waterfall is another option that has more PP than Liquidation, allowing Dondozo to perform better against stall; however, its use case is rare. Body Press makes use of Dondozo's massive Defense stat and punishes Pokemon like Tera Normal Dragonite and Kingambit. Avalanche + Earthquake is a decent alternative to hit most of the metagame at least neutrally. Rest + Sleep Talk provides Dondozo with good sustainability without making it too passive. Protect can also be used to accumulate Leftovers recovery and scout for Choice item users like Meowscarada and Iron Valiant. Tera Fairy offers a generally strong defensive profile and grants Dondozo an immunity to Dragon-type attacks like Tera Dragon Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush and Walking Wake's Draco Meteor. Tera Grass can be run instead to maintain Dondozo's Water resistance while granting it a resistance to Grass- and Electric-type attacks like Meowscarada's Flower Trick, Brute Bonnet's Bullet Seed, and Zapdos's Discharge and Volt Switch. Tera Fighting can also be considered, as it boosts Body Press and lets Dondozo check Kingambit and Choice Band Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Clodsire and Ting-Lu pair perfectly with Dondozo, playing into its desire to outlast foes long-term with chip damage in the form of entry hazards, status, or Ruination. Both also check special attackers like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo, which Dondozo tends to struggle with. Garganacl deserves a special mention as a teammate due to its ability to wear down foes with Salt Cure; it, in turn, appreciates Dondozo taking on Great Tusk and Kingambit. Hatterene provides Dondozo teams with an excellent sweeper and appreciates Dondozo taking care of physical wallbreakers like Dragapult, and Kingambit. It also can help by blocking opposing entry hazards with Magic Bounce, letting Dondozo more comfortably tank a Knock Off from Great Tusk or Iron Treads. Similarly, entry hazard removal from Corviknight or Great Tusk is also helpful; Corviknight also deals with Meowscarada, which can force Dondozo to Terastallize early. Choice Scarf Gholdengo can help pressure opposing Dondozo while dealing with Dragapult and Iron Valiant. Dondozo also fits very well on stall teams, which appreciate its ability to wall so many physical attackers. Blissey is a standout teammate due to its ability to blanket check most special attackers, while Dondozo sponges physical attacks that Blissey cannot stomach. Lastly, Alomomola is a solid teammate on stall teams, as it can provide Wish support so Dondozo doesn't need to use Rest as frequently and can effectively utilize Whirlpool to trap opponents and prevent their double switches, allowing Dondozo to come in safely against physical attackers it walls.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Curse Dondozo is a deceptively strong sweeper that provides good defensive utility before it attempts a sweep. Liquidation is preferred over Wave Crash due to its lack of recoil; however, Wave Crash is an option if a stronger STAB move is desired. Body Press makes use of Dondozo's naturally high Defense stat and Curse's boosts to deal with foes like Baxcalibur and Roaring Moon. The combination of Avalanche + Earthquake can be run instead, which hits most of the metagame at least neutrally. Protect lets Dondozo accumulate Leftovers recovery and scouting for Choice item users like Iron Valiant and Breloom. However, Protect can be dropped for Rest, which affords Dondozo greater longevity at the cost of becoming more passive. Leftovers is preferred over Heavy-Duty Boots, as Dondozo will be on the field for many turns in a row to adequately set up with Curse; however, if a team requires Dondozo to play more defensively, Heavy-Duty Boots is a fine choice, though it should not be run alongside Protect. Grass is Dondozo's Tera type of choice, removing its original weaknesses while giving it an important resistance to Ground. Maximum investment in special bulk allows Dondozo to become nigh-unbreakable once it sets up. However, other generally good defensive Tera types like Steel and Fairy are situational options that can be utilized instead.</p> <p>Entry hazard removal is key for Dondozo if it does not run Heavy-Duty Boots; good options include Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight. Though Dondozo can have quite the offensive presence once it sets up, it is best to run it alongside consistent wallbreakers like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Iron Valiant, which can help break open holes for it to sweep late-game. Similarly, entry hazards from teammates like Garchomp and Glimmora can facilitate Dondozo's sweep. Trick users like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo can cripple Dondozo checks like Clodsire and Skeledirge, causing them to lose to Dondozo over the course of the game. While Dondozo is a great sweeper, it is far from consistent at generating setup opportunities; accordingly, it is best to pair it with another bulky sweeper like Curse Garganacl or Hatterene, which can weaken or bait out answers to bulky sweepers like Trick users and Unaware Clodsire.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Dondozo is a staple on rainless Water teams due to its phenomenal bulk and ability to check setup sweepers such as Gholdengo and Chien-Pao, thanks to Unaware. Dondozo faces competition from Quagsire as the team's Unaware user, as Quagsire has an immunity to Electric-type attacks and can stack entry hazards; however, it drops to Grass-type attacks. Curse allows Dondozo to apply offensive pressure, boosting its attack and allowing it to better hit targets such as Baxcalibur and Kingambit while also allowing it to better tank hits in return. Rest allows Dondozo to shrug off status and gives it longevity, allowing it to constantly absorb powerful attacks for Water teams, such as Great Tusk's Headlong Rush. Sleep Talk enables Dondozo to further take advantage of Rest, allowing it to continue to setup or attack its target while asleep. Dondozo takes advantage of its STAB through the use of Waterfall, doing more damage, but Avalanche allows Dondozo to OHKO Meowscarada, as well as pressure Water-immune Pokemon such as Clodsire and Gastrodon. Its EV spread allows Dondozo to tank attacks from Gholdengo and Flutter Mane, due to its already high physical defense, which may be further boosted by Curse.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja is an insane wallbreaker, with coverage allowing it to take on a variety of Pokemon such as an opposing Dondozo or Ting-Lu with Grass Knot, Garchomp with Ice Beam, Amoonguss and Clodsire with Extrasensory, and Espathra with Dark Pulse. Toxapex absorbs Toxic Spikes for Dondozo, spreads Toxic, and shrugs off Grass-type attacks such as Flower Trick from Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Grass Knot from Greninja. Gastrodon provides an Electric immunity and it can tank attacks from special attackers such as Flutter Mane; however, it needs to be wary of Energy Ball. Gastrodon can also stack Spikes or set Stealth Rock, wearing down foes for Dondozo. The defensive core of Dondozo, Toxapex, and Gastrodon also gives Water teams opportunities to scout powerful attacks by allowing for each to switch-in for another, such as Dondozo switching in for Gastrodon or Toxapex to tank Chien-Pao's Crunch. Earthquake also allows it to take on Poison- and Electric-type Pokemon such as Clodsire and Sandy Shocks. Quaquaval can remove hazards with Rapid Spin for Dondozo and offensive Quaquaval sets can take on common threats to Water teams such as Greninja after one Aqua Step or Meowscarada after two.</p> "

Annihilape checks anti-offense threats like Iron Bundle and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu, and it heavily pressures defensive cores, making it a good addition to offensive teams.</p> "

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thanks to great bulk and the dangerous Rage Fist, Annihilape is one of the premier bulky set-up sweepers of Battle Stadium Singles.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt helps you deal with annoying Pokemon like Whirlwind Ting-Lu, Dondozo, Will-O-Wisp Skeledirge, and Hippowdon, to mention a few, forcing them to attack and boost Rage Fist. This can work on Toxapex, but be warned that Toxapex commonly carries Mental Herb, which could get Annihilape poisoned if it doesn't Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore: Encore is an interesting alternative to Taunt, not able to directly shut down defensive answers to Annihilape, but it severely punishes them when Annihilape switches into a support move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: With Vital Spirit, Annihilape can absorb Spore from foes like Breloom, Brute Bonnet, and Amoonguss.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium: Terastallization is quite helpful at saving Annihilape from certain extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Flutter Mane, but Annihilape is perfectly functional without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire: In addition to giving a useful resistance to Fairy, Fire, and Ice attacks from dangerous foes like Flutter Mane, Chi-Yu, and Chien-Pao, Tera Fire also prevents Will-O-Wisp from hitting.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel turns Annihilape's Psychic and Fairy weakness into resistances, as well as being an excellent defensive type overall. It lets Annihilape set up freely on Amoonguss and Toxapex, gives it a better chance of defeating Flutter Mane, and resisting Flower Trick means Meowscarada has a much harder time revenge killing it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison: While not as sturdy of a defensive typing as Tera Steel, Tera Poison offers a better matchup against Flutter Mane, does well against Meowscarada, and lets Annihilape freely switch into Toxic and Toxic Spikes later in the match. This also drastically reduces the risk of Taunting Toxapex, which makes this Tera type a menace against stall teams!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying helps a lot to avoid Fissure from Dondozo and Ting-Lu, forcing it to attack with moves that boost Rage Fist. It also improves Annihilape's match-up against Great Tusk, and makes Hippowdon an easy foe to set up on.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water: Tera Water is a good choice against Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Palafin-H.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers: Leftovers's residual recovery eases the long-game of setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs</strong>: Reducing the HP EVs to 244 gives Annihilape an even HP stat, which lets Annihilape recover its health with Sitrus Berry the moment it gets hit by Ruination. This makes dealing with Ting-Lu and Wo-Chien an easier task.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak: Covert Cloak makes Annihilape immune to being Salt Cured, making it a great check against Garganacl. It also gives peace of mind, avoiding potential flinches from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, or Special Defense drops from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove: Removing contact damage from Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin is helpful against defensive Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly: Maximum Speed mainly helps Annihilape outspeed Gholdengo, Great Tusk, Baxcalibur, and Modest Chi-Yu. With Bulk Up and Rage Fist improving its offense, Annihilape can invest in HP over Attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 244 SpD / 12 Spe with Careful: More special bulk can make it much more difficult for special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu to revenge kill Annihilape. This spread in particular has a 62.5% chance of surviving Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 164 Def / 100 SpD with Careful</strong>: This EV spread avoids a OHKO from +2 Chien-Pao, which can be especially helpful with Covert Cloak blocking the flinch chance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 SpD / 100 Spe with Careful</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom and Cloyster while still giving Annihilape good special bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 196 Def / 60 Spe with Impish: This physically defensive spread will survive Tera Flying Adamant Dragonite's Tera Blast, while outspeeding 4 Speed EV Mimikyu and Jolly Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> </ul> "

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Annihilape's good bulk and significant offensive presence makes it an easy to use Stealth Rock setter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rage Fist</strong>: Rage Fist is Annihilape’s strongest move; its power and coverage often lets Annihilape either defeat or significantly chip one of the opponent’s Pokemon on top of getting Stealth Rock up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drain Punch versus Close Combat</strong>: The huge amount of Dark-types in this metagame necessitates a Fighting STAB attack. Drain Punch is preferred in most cases for the extra recovery, but Close Combat makes plenty of sense if using Focus Sash and an offensive EV spread.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt gives Annihilape a strong matchup into bulky walls such as Ting-Lu and opposing setup foes like Volcarona, while also making it easier to boost Rage Fist’s power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Final Gambit: Annihilape's impressive HP stat makes Final Gambit into a powerful KO trading tool, being able to take out bulky foes like Garganacl, Corviknight, Wo-Chien, and Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb versus Bulldoze: Rock Tomb is an excellent Speed reducing move for its ability to hit Dragonite, and threaten Volcarona and Iron Bundle. Its low accuracy should be noted as a risk, however. Bulldoze trades hitting Dragonite in exchange for dealing good damage against Gholdengo and Iron Moth.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Encore: Encore is an incredibly powerful move that can lock the opponent into an attacking move to boost Rage Fist's power. Alternatively, it can lock the opponent into a status move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fling and Light Ball</strong>: This gives Annihilape a chance to paralyze a foe, including Gholdengo that lack Covert Cloak, and break potential Focus Sashes too.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curse</strong>: This is an excellent way for Annihilape to retire itself from the battle while putting significant pressure on the opponent to switch out and shutting down gimmicks such as Baton Pass.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This Annihilape is often used quite early in the game to set up Stealth Rock, so Terastallization is often not needed unless it must check a specific threat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel has excellent defensive synergy with Annihilape thanks to the Fairy resistance and doing particularly well on spreads that are faster than -1 Chien-Pao to move before Sacred Sword lands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire: Beyond offering a valuable Fairy resistance, the Ice and Fire resistances make Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu easier to deal with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal: Ghost-type attacks are incredibly common. Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and opposing Annihilape all struggle against an unexpected Tera Normal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison: Tera Poison has a good matchup against Flutter Mane, and lets Annihilape deal with Toxic and Toxic Spikes without needing to Taunt.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash: Even when using bulky EV spreads, Focus Sash is useful for surviving an attack from foes that can be difficult to EV for, such as Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry can be used with specialized spreads to avoid certain 2HKOs. Just make sure to have an even HP stat, to ensure that Sitrus Berry activates after getting hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roseli Berry</strong>: Roseli Berry works well on specially defensive EV spreads designed defeat Flutter Mane leads that lack Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: Vital Spirit adds to Annihilape’s reliability as a lead. Immunity to sleep moves from common Pokemon such as Breloom, Brute Bonnet, Dondozo, Hippowdon, and Skeledirge lets Annihilape thrive with more defensive EV spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Defiant: While Intimidate Pokemon are far from common from the format, Defiant can take advantage opposing Speed control moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Inner Focus</strong>: This niche ability prevents flinches from Chien-Pao and Dragonite from happening.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>172 HP / 4 Atk / 212 Def / 4 SpD / 116 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This Speed drop based spread allows Annihilape to outspeed -1 Iron Bundle and avoids getting 2HKOed by Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: If using Focus Sash and Close Combat together, maximizing Attack and Speed will win the most matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>220 HP / 244 SpD / 44 Spe with Careful</strong>: This Roseli Berry based spread lets Annihilape survive Modest Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball and outspeed -1 Garchomp and 4 Speed EV Tinkaton.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Sitrus Berry EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 180 SpD / 100 Spe with Careful: This Sitrus Berry optimized EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, while outspeeding Adamant Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 244 Def / 20 Spe with Impish</strong>: This defensive spread is Annihilape's best chance at being a soft check to Chien-Pao, though note that Swords Dance and Terastallization together can still overwhelm Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> "

A combination of Toxic + Earthquake ensures that offensive threats like Koraidon and Chien-Pao and walls like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk cannot switch into Clodsire for free. Clodsire also acts as a good entry hazard setter, as it has access to Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes. Alternatively, Counter can be used to eliminate defensive Great Tusk, Choice Scarf Koraidon Choice locked into Dragon Claw, and Chien-Pao Choice locked into Crunch. Water Absorb is preferred, as it makes Clodsire immune to Hydro Pump from Iron Bundle and Water-type STAB moves from Walking Wake while also making it so it doesn't ignore the Special Attack drop from Miraidon's Draco Meteor, which Unaware doesn't allow.

          "description": "<p>Clodsire is a defensive Pokemon with great abilities, using Unaware to sit in front of setup sweepers and Water Absorb to stop a sweeping Walking Wake. Its fantastic defensive typing allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes and nets it nice resistances to Fighting and Fairy, letting it check a unique combination of threatening offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W. To aid in checking them, it runs Toxic to put these Pokemon on a timer, stalling with Recover as poison damage increases. When they're inevitably forced to switch, their replacement takes damage too since Clodsire sets Stealth Rock or Spikes, racking up even more damage. Leftovers can be used to help preserve Recover’s PP and stay in longer, while Heavy-Duty Boots helps Clodsire switch in and out to wall threats. Earthquake, besides providing direct damage, super effectively damages Pokemon that can't be poisoned like Gholdengo and other Clodsire. Terastallization gives Clodsire much more defensive flexibility as well; Tera Water can help it resist powerful STAB moves from Dondozo and Azumarill which would otherwise scare it out. Tera Flying is another useful option, turning its Ground weakness into an immunity while preserving its Fighting resistance, allowing it to stay in against Great Tusk and Focus Sash Breloom.</p> <p>Clodsire fits neatly into plenty of balance or stall teams looking for a way to handle special hits, offering support with both setting up hazards and removing Toxic Spikes, and walling sweepers with Unaware. Other hazard setters in particular love stacking hazards alongside it; since it learns both Stealth Rock and Spikes, it can fit with many options, like Spikes Meowscarada or Stealth Rock Garganacl. However, its mediocre Defense and weaknesses to Ground and Ice leave it particularly vulnerable to the the tier's physical wallbreakers, most notably Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Garchomp. As such, Clodsire greatly appreciates having teammates who can check these Pokemon and easily switch into Earthquake or Icicle Crash like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Tera Water Garganacl. In particular, Clodsire is completely stonewalled by Hatterene and Air Balloon or Tera Flying Gholdengo. The former reflects both Toxic and entry hazards while overpowering its healing with Psyshock, and the latter is immune to Toxic via Good as Gold, even if it loses its Steel typing. Great teammates to help check these two are Gholdengo itself for Hatterene, which threatens Hatterene with Make It Rain and its unpredictable set versatility, and Kingambit for opposing Gholdengo, which resists both of Gholdengo's STAB moves and can immediately threaten to OHKO it back. In turn, these two appreciate Clodsire checking the Fire-types that scare them out, especially Iron Moth and Skeledirge. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo can check the Water-type threats Clodsire fears, like Floatzel and Azumarill.</p> "

Water Absorb stops common Water-type threats like Quaquaval, Dondozo, and Pelipper in their tracks, while Unaware walls setup sweepers such as Gholdengo, Mimikyu, and Volcarona. Poison Jab hits threats like Meowscarada, Rotom-C, and Iron Valiant, while Gunk Shot provides more power against bulkier foes such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Toxic Spike eases the Dark and Fairy matchups due to their lack of entry hazard removal and applies pressure on teams in general, completing Ground's entry hazard stacking core. Toxic may be used instead to punish Pokemon like Rotom-W and Hydreigon, which freely switch-in to Clodsire otherwise. The given EV spread avoids the 2HKO from both Choice Scarf Greninja's Ice Beam and Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Flower Trick.</p> <p>Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu appreciate Clodsire checking the aforementioned Water-types as well as other threats such as Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane. In return, Choice Scarf Great Tusk pressures Ice- and Dark-types like Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Choice Specs Greninja. Iron Treads clears entry hazards and threatens Hatterene, and Ting-Lu sets up entry hazards and switches into Psychic-type attacks from Espathra and Indeedee. Unaware Clodsire synergizes very well with Gastrodon, as it checks the aforementioned Grass-types, while Gastrodon switches into Water-type attacks from Dondozo and Barraskewda. Sandy Shocks threatens Flying-types like Corviknight and Pelipper and secures the Fire matchup. Quagsire pairs well with Water Absorb Clodsire, as it checks Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Great Tusk. Furthermore, Quagsire is capable of using Toxic to free up a moveslot for Toxic Spike on Clodsire, expanding the team's hazard stacking ability.</p> "

Earthquake lets it chip down and eventually beat threats like Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo, while Low Kick deals with the aforementioned Nasty Plot Hydreigon and can heavily damage Kingambit in a pinch. Spikes lets Clodsire take advantage of forced switches and synergizes well with Glimmora, Toxapex, and Skuntank, all together forming Poison's entry hazard-stacking core. Alternatively, Curse turns Clodsire into a threatening wincon and lets it deal with physical attackers. 56 Def EVs may be considered so Clodsire tanks a fully boosted Supreme Overlord Kowtow Cleave from Kingambit and deals heavy damage to it with Low Kick.</p> <p>Amoonguss and Toxapex are physically defensive walls that complement Clodsire, as they take on threats such as Great Tusk, Scizor, and Quaquaval, which force Clodsire out. Amoonguss can also run Growth, which helps in the Ground matchup, while Toxapex also chips down the opposing team by setting Toxic Spikes and wearing down threats like Chien-Pao with Infestation, Baneful Bunker, and Rocky Helmet. Skuntank is a Psychic-immune teammate that switches into Hatterene, Espathra, and Indeedee, and it can set Toxic Spikes better against types like Fairy and Psychic by trapping switch-ins such as Klefki and Bronzong with Fire Spin. Glimmora provides entry hazard support and removal with Stealth Rock and Mortal Spin, respectively, and it can run Air Balloon or Choice Scarf to handle Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads due to its great coverage. Glimmora can also run Corrosion with Toxic and Mortal Spin, improving the Poison matchup and putting defensive Pokemon such as opposing Clodsire and Amoongus on a timer. Iron Moth is another plausible Choice Scarf user, as it handles Steel- and Dragon-types like Iron Treads and Baxcalibur, though it can also run a set with Substitute to handle Kingambit and break down types such as Flying and Water better.</p> "

However, Stealth Rock can be used if Clodsire's team requires it. Toxic is used to cripple common switch-ins to Clodsire, such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Great Tusk.

Farigiraf's Cud Chew can grant it unique setup opportunities, as Sitrus Berry turns many 2HKOs into 3HKOs. However, Farigiraf usually needs at least 2 turns to start posing a serious threat; Knock Off from Bombirdier, Haze from Cryogonal and Articuno, and Encore from Sableye can easily disrupt its setup, while simple overwhelming offensive pressure can stop it from getting out of hand.</p> ",

Sitrus Berry and Cud Chew allow Farigiraf to shrug off a majority of neutral attacks in the tier, greatly improving its survivability to grant Farigiraf the two turns of setup that it needs. The other alternative to Sitrus Berry is Cud Chew + Lum Berry, giving Farigiraf status immunity for 2 turns, which could allow Farigiraf to set up on the likes of Glare Sandaconda and Toxic or Thunder Wave Qwilfish. The Speed EVs let Farigiraf outspeed neutral-natured Clawitzer &amp; positive Speed-natured Cacturne and Ursaring at +0 while outrunning Choice Scarf Bruxish after an Agility, with the rest of the EVs being invested into Special Attack for maximum damage output. Dazzling Gleam is often preferred over Tera Blast for the ability to hit Dark-types without needing to Terastallize. Tera Fairy is very useful for its Dragon Tail immunity against Eelektross and Appletun, and turns Farigiraf's weaknesses to Dark and Bug into resistances, and also boosts Dazzling Gleam. Sap Sipper can also complement Tera Fairy to completely blank Appletun's dual STAB combination, with Cacturne and Lurantis being bonus setup targets. Armor Tail can be considered to stop priority moves from Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Bruxish while turning Sableye into setup fodder. Farigiraf can also use Calm Mind and a bulkier spread to set up more reliably on weaker special attackers such as Abomasnow, Raichu, and non-Trick Rotom. With Tera Steel, Farigiraf is able to better take on common Haze users like Articuno, Cryogonal, and Hisuian Qwilfish, hitting the former two super effectively with Tera Blast and gaining an immunity to the latter's Poison-type attacks.</p> <p>Farigiraf's low Speed often mandates using Agility first and also means it generally cannot threaten the opponent until turn 3, as it takes two turns to set up Agility followed by Nasty Plot. Strong teammates that can apply quick and immediate pressure on the opponent make for good partners, such as Tauros, Hisuian Sneasel, and Rotom. Pokemon that can also handle Farigiraf's checks and counters, namely Dark-types and Haze users, are especially appreciated. Nasty Plot + Taunt Houndoom and Trick Rotom or Haunter can bait out defensive responses such as Umbreon, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Blissey in order to cripple them. A double Psychic core involving Farigiraf and either Bruxish or Mesprit can also work to wear down their shared checks and prevent them from answering one or the other. Rest Sandaconda can shrug off attacks from Umbreon and Hisuian Qwilfish while even smacking the latter with Earthquake. Hisuian Sneasel and Toxicroak can threaten Umbreon and Hisuian Qwilfish, whereas Magneton, Pyroar, Houndoom, and Perrserker can switch into Haze Cryogonal and Articuno to apply offensive pressure. Scyther, Bombirdier, Magneton, and Perrserker can force out the opponent's less defensive Pokemon and pivot to give Farigiraf a window of opportunity to set up, with Bombirdier being particularly notable due to its access to Parting Shot and Memento. Abomasnow can provide Aurora Veil support for Farigiraf to make setting up easier.</p> "

Its remarkable defensive profile grants it multiple opportunities to wreak havoc: it soft checks and takes advantage of prominent threats like Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Gholdengo—which can be problematic for offensive teams—while forcing out defensive foes like Hatterene, Toxapex, and Slowking. Iron Head smashes through Fairy-types and Tera Fairy users like Hatterene, Scream Tail, and Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Rotom-W. Low Kick most importantly OHKOes Roaring Moon and opposing Kingambit, and it severely dents Ting-Lu and Iron Treads. Tera Dark—especially alongside Black Glasses, if running it—cranks up Kingambit's damage output for even more late-game potential. Tera Dark in particular allows Sucker Punch to OHKO Gholdengo without a boost, as well as Garchomp at +2, and it also removes Kingambit's Ground weakness for foes like Garchomp and Ting-Lu. Tera Fighting removes all of Kingambit's weaknesses and boosts its Low Kick's damage output, allowing Kingambit to break pass Great Tusk and Dondozo after a couple of Supreme Overlord boosts. Tera Fire is another alternative that flips the matchup against Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Focus Sash Ceruledge, as well as stopping the former two and foes like Rotom-W, Dragapult, and Tera Water Skeledirge from crippling it with a burn. Moreover, the Fighting neutrality allows Kingambit to soft check Iron Valiant and Breloom, and it can set up safely on Body Press Corviknight. Lum Berry gives Kingambit more setup opportunities in the face of status users like Rotom-W and Dragapult, especially if it can't utilize Tera Fire to block their Will-O-Wisp. A Jolly nature allows Kingambit to outspeed uninvested Great Tusk and Rotom-W, and it works well on Low Kick variants to—at worst—Speed tie and OHKO opposing Kingambit.</p> <p>Kingambit fits well on offensive teams, which range from offense to hyper offense. Entry hazards from teammates like Glimmora, Meowscarada, and Garchomp are near mandatory, as they deactivate Focus Sash on foes like Greninja, Polteageist, and Ceruledge and chip down foes into Kingambit's KO range. Also, these setters tending to faint early-game helps Kingambit accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts. Wallbreakers such as Iron Moth, Dragapult, and Iron Valiant are necessary to pressure the opposition early-game, especially because they can overwhelm and individually threaten Kingambit's checks like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Great Tusk; Iron Moth in particular deals with troublesome Fairy-types if Kingambit lacks Iron Head. In return, Kingambit deals with Dragapult for Iron Moth and Gholdengo for Iron Valiant, with Low Kick variants dealing with opposing Kingambit for Dragapult as well. Other setup sweepers like Dragonite and Roaring Moon are secondary wincons in case Kingambit is unable to fully sweep, especially if it runs Swords Dance to overwhelm their shared checks like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Tera Water Garganacl and Skeledirge. Aside from rain teams weakening the Fire-type moves from Iron Moth and Dragapult, they support Kingambit with wallbreakers like Floatzel, Azumarill, and Greninja, which threaten Great Tusk and overwhelm Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl and Skeledirge. Kingambit also takes advantage of Floatzel fainting early-game from Wave Crash recoil to gain a Supreme Overlord boost.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Kingambit is one of the metagame's most powerful late-game wincons due to its high Attack bolstered further by Swords Dance and a fantastic ability in Supreme Overlord, excellent natural bulk and a good defensive typing, and access to a powerful STAB Sucker Punch to make up for its poor Speed. Kowtow Cleave is Kingambit's most reliable STAB option; with a Swords Dance boost and Supreme Overlord's maximum number of boosts, it is powerful enough to OHKO physically defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock damage the majority of the time. Sucker Punch allows Kingambit to greatly pressure offensive threats, allowing it to eliminate weakened foes like Walking Wake, Hisuian Zoroark, Iron Moth, and Floatzel. With boosts from Supreme Overlord and Swords Dance, it can even handle bulkier threats like Roaring Moon where its high bulk investment allows it to attack them first, survive a hit, and KO them with Sucker Punch thereafter. Iron Head is a consistent STAB option that can eliminate Garganacl, Hatterene, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge while pressuring Roaring Moon without relying on Sucker Punch predictions against Dragon Dance variants. Tera Blast alongside a Fairy or Flying Tera type allows Kingambit to punish Fighting-types like Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Breloom by turning its 4x Fighting weakness into a resistance and OHKOing them in return with a super effective attack, though this comes at the cost of requiring Kingambit to Terastallize in order to maximize its coverage. Tera Fairy also improves Kingambit's matchup against Dragon-types like Roaring Moon, while Tera Flying grants it a Ground immunity to allow it to turn Great Tusk into setup fodder. 20 Speed EVs allow Kingambit to outspeed minimum Speed Corviknight, while the HP investment allows Kingambit to survive powerful attacks like Choice Specs Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Kingambit is an excellent wincon on bulky offense and balanced teams. Ting-Lu and Garchomp provide Stealth Rock and Spikes support to let Kingambit KO Roaring Moon with a boosted Sucker Punch, and the chip damage from entry hazards can make up for fewer Supreme Overlord boosts should some of Kingambit's teammates still be healthy. Iron Valiant can use its strong mixed coverage to pressure Unaware walls like Dondozo and that would otherwise ignore Kingambit's Swords Dance boosts and prevent its sweep, while Hisuian Zoroark can eliminate Dondozo while pressuring Skeledirge and Amoonguss. In return, Kingambit's great bulk and good defensive typing let it check faster offensive threats like Dragapult and Meowscarada while resisting priority from Dragonite. Great Tusk appreciates Kingambit's ability to pressure Fairy-types that force it out, and in return, it wears down Steel-types—especially opposing Kingambit, which this set greatly appreciates, since it does not carry Low Kick—so Kingambit can sweep more easily. Dragon-types like Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Dragonite all have excellent synergy with Kingambit, as it resists Dragon- and Ice-type attacks and can threaten Fairy-types like Hatterene and Tera Fairy Garganacl with Iron Head; any of these Dragon-types can run Choice item sets to help wallbreak for Kingambit, or Kingambit can assist in wallbreaking earlier in the game to facilitate their sweeps if they opt to run Dragon Dance sets instead. Said Dragon-types resist Fire-type attacks from Cinderace and Iron Moth. Iron Moth itself makes for an effective teammate, as it can handle threats like Corviknight and opposing Kingambit while wearing down walls like Dondozo to help Kingambit sweep. In return, Kingambit's powerful Sucker Punch can pressure fast and powerful physical attackers like Dragapult and Cinderace that Iron Moth cannot reliably set up against. Lastly, Choice Scarf Gholdengo can take advantage of Corviknight and Amoonguss to help Kingambit break through defensive cores long-term and can use Trick to cripple walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo, giving Kingambit opportunities to exploit their newfound Choice locks and wear them down.</p> "

Dark / Steel is a great offensive typing that can hit Pokemon such as Skeledirge, Gholdengo, Dragapult, Garganacl, and Iron Valiant super effectively as well as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight neutrally. Tera Flying completely reverses Kingambit's weaknesses and resistances and can catch Pokemon looking to KO Kingambit with Fighting- and Ground-type moves like Iron Valiant and Great Tusk, off guard. Alternatively, Kingambit can opt for Tera Ghost to better counter Tera Normal Dragonite, as Earthquake becomes neutral against Kingambit and Extreme Speed is ineffective. Similarly, Tera Fairy can be chosen because Kingambit then resists Roaring Moon's Crunch, which cannot OHKO Kingambit without Tera Steel. Kingambit chooses to run 144 Speed EVs to reliably outspeed Corviknight and Swords Dance Iron Hands; the rest of its investment is in HP to maximize bulk.</p> <p>Kingambit fits very well on hyper and bulky offense teams, as it works very well coming in after its teammates have fallen, such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, Breloom, and Dragonite. On hyper offense particularly, Grimmsnarl and Glimmora both work as great leads that set up screens and entry hazards, respectively. Kingambit checks opposing offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Meowscarada thanks to its defensive typing but loses out against revenge killers such as Breloom and other threats like Calm Mind Iron Valiant, Iron Hands, Dondozo, and Great Tusk; as such, Kingambit appreciates defensive support from Great Tusk, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W and offensive support from Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Dragapult.</p> "

Making up for its lack of Speed, Sucker Punch fits perfectly on Kingambit. In tandem with three boosts from Supreme Overlord, Sucker Punch OHKOes Flutter Mane; it also OHKOes Volcarona after Swords Dance in tandem with two Supreme Overlord boosts. Kowtow Cleave is a reliable heavy-hitting STAB attack, and Iron Head hits Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Azumarill.

Its base 50 Speed leaves something to be desired but is supplemented by Sucker Punch. Kowtow Cleave allows it to break through walls that don't resist it such as Skeledirge, which poses a major complication for Steel teams, as well as 2HKOing Quagsire if all teammates have fainted. Sucker Punch can allow Kingambit to defeat threats like Barraskewda and Flutter Mane, which can massively threaten Steel teams. Iron Head damages Pokemon that don't mind Sucker Punch or Kowtow Cleave, such as Ting-Lu or Azumarill. Alternatively, Brick Break destroys dual screens and OHKOes other Kingambit trying to take its STAB moves. 140 Speed EVs allow Kingambit to outspeed walls such as uninvested Skeledirge and Corviknight. Black Glasses boosts its Dark-type moves to dangerous levels without it having to set up Swords Dance, but Leftovers may be used to increase Kingambit's survivability. Chople Berry has a niche in allowing Kingambit to survive Fighting-type moves such as Chien-Pao's Sacred Sword, while Heavy Duty Boots helps it pivot in and out to exert pressure on the opponent without getting chipped.</p> <p>Scizor's U-turn safely pivots Kingambit in to wallbreak while dealing substantial chip damage; also, its Bullet Punch deals with threats to Kingambit such as Chien-Pao and Iron Valiant, and Close Combat allows it to check threats such as Iron Treads and Ting-Lu. Gholdengo is an excellent partner to freely switch into Fighting-type moves and Will-O-Wisp. Corviknight serves as a potent check to Chien-Pao and clears entry hazards to increase Kingambit's longevity, Magnezone breaks through bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo, and it preserves momentum through Volt Switch. Iron Treads serves as another hazard clearer, can set up Stealth Rock to chip any walls Kingambit wants to break through, and can serve as speed control with a Choice Scarf. Klefki sets up dual screens, which allow Kingambit to use Swords Dance far more easily. Tinkaton can wall any Fairy-type moves meant to chip or finish off Kingambit, such as Flutter Mane's Moonblast, and KO many of their users with Gigaton Hammer. Orthworm's Shed Tail can be used with Kingambit to great effect, allowing it to freely use Swords Dance and threaten to sweep the opponent's team.</p> "

Great Tusk also has difficulty with physical walls such as Dondozo, Tera Water and Tera Fairy Garganacl, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge. Spikes support from Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Garchomp wears down these checks into range of Great Tusk's attacks, especially when paired with Knock Off. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, Iron Hands, and Breloom make for good partners by being able to overwhelm shared checks; Gholdengo is a noteworthy wallbreaker for also blocking opposing hazard removal. Torkoal is also an excellent partner for Great Tusk, setting up the sun to activate Protosynthesis and weaken Water-type attacks, while supporting other wallbreakers that can pressure the aforementioned physical walls, such as Choice Band Roaring Moon, Scovillain, and Slither Wing.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Great Tusk has a solid niche as a defensive Pokemon by virtue of its utility, movepool, bulk, and typing. It can adequately check Pokemon like Kingambit, Cinderace, and Iron Hands, threatening them with a strong Earthquake in return. Stealth Rock lets Great Tusk compress even more roles, chipping away at the opposition. If another Stealth Rock user is already on the team, however, Body Press can take advantage of its high Defense stat and better threaten the likes of Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon. Body Press also lets Great Tusk catch Rotom-W with greater chip damage than Knock Off does on the switch. Knock Off provides valuable item removal, getting rid of Leftovers from Pokemon like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite. Additionally, Knock Off is Great Tusk's only initial way to hit Air Balloon Gholdengo, which can't OHKO this defensive set. Rapid Spin, besides clearing entry hazards, also allows Great Tusk to outspeed faster foes like Focus Sash Glimmora and Gholdengo. Tera Water grants Great Tusk an overall valuable defensive typing, letting it check threats like Azumarill and—in a pinch—foes like Iron Moth and Gholdengo while still maintaining a positive matchup against Dragonite, Kingambit, and opposing Great Tusk. Tera Fighting gets rid of Great Tusk's Ground typing, giving it a better matchup against Pokemon like Quaquaval and Floatzel while also strengthening Body Press if it is used. Alternatively, Tera Steel can give Great Tusk valuable resistances to Fairy, and Grass, turning the tables on Hatterene and Meowscarada. Leftovers greatly increases Great Tusk's longevity; however, Rocky Helmet can be used to wear down Pokemon like Scizor and Cinderace over time.</p> <p>After Great Tusk sets Stealth Rock, Corviknight effortlessly switches in and uses Defog to remove entry hazards, so Pokemon like Cinderace, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W that handle it are great partners. With no good way to hit Flying-types and Pokemon that use Tera Flying, Great Tusk can be set up on very quickly, most notably against the likes of Dragonite and Roaring Moon; even though the former dislikes Knock Off. Therefore, checks to these such as Dondozo and Corviknight are appreciated. A different Stealth Rock setter like Garganacl or Ting-Lu lets Great Tusk comfortably run Body Press without losing out on anything major. Ting-Lu also forms a potent entry hazard-stacking core with Great Tusk via Spikes. Further, it takes on the special attackers that Great Tusk struggles with, like Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult. Great Tusk is forced out by wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Quaquaval, so teammates that can check them like Amoonguss and Toxapex are welcome. Pokemon like Ceruledge, and Iron Moth appreciate the entry hazard removal that Great Tusk provides. Great Tusk's defensive qualities greatly help frail wallbreakers like Dragapult, and Iron Valiant, as these Pokemon need strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on very often.</p> "

It can support teams offensively with Knock Off and Rapid Spin as well as defensively through its ability to check Kingambit, Cinderace, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Its dual STAB moves are able to OHKO or severely damage several key offensive Pokemon in the metagame such as Kingambit, and Tera Normal Dragonite. Knock Off allows Great Tusk to remove Leftovers from walls such as Corviknight and Dondozo. It can also remove important items from more offensive Pokemon, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite, and it can provide coverage against Air Balloon Gholdengo, which otherwise checks this set. Ice Spinner hits Dragon-types that Headlong Rush isn't as strong against like bulky Garchomp and Dragonite. Alternatively, Rapid Spin can be run if the team is still in need of entry hazard removal. With Tera Fighting, Close Combat becomes much stronger, guaranteeing OHKOs against offensive Scizor sets. Tera Fighting also improves Great Tusk's matchups against Dondozo, Rotom-W, and opposing Great Tusk. With Tera Steel, Great Tusk can better handle Grass- and Fairy-types such as Meowscarada and Hatterene, and it can also shrug off attacks it normally can't, such as Meowscarada's Flower Trick and Dragapult's Draco Meteor. When running Great Tusk on sun teams, an alternate EV spread making Speed its highest stat can be considered due to Protosynthesis boosting Speed; this allows Great Tusk to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon like Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p> <p>Rotom-W, Skeledirge, and Torkoal make for good teammates, since their status spreading can help weaken foes and help Great Tusk wallbreak more efficiently. Rotom-W is able to paralyze faster Pokemon such as Iron Valiant and boosted Quaquaval, allowing Great Tusk to outspeed them. Skeledirge is able to spread burn, capitalize on foes afflicted with status with a boosted Hex, and check Iron Valiant sets lacking Shadow Ball. Lastly, Torkoal is able to force switches thanks to Yawn, spread status with Lava Plume, and set up sun to make Great Tusk an even scarier wallbreaker. Great Tusk appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Garganacl and Ting-Lu, since it can wallbreak more easily thanks to the chip damage they provide. Great Tusk is able to keep their hazards up in exchange while simultaneously removing hazards set by foes. Sweepers that are vulnerable to hazards like Iron Moth and Tera Flying Roaring Moon appreciate Great Tusk being able to remove hazards and beat walls such as Ting-Lu, allowing them to sweep more easily late-game. Lastly, other offensive Pokemon such as Kingambit and Dragonite make for good partners, since Great Tusk is able to weaken or cripple their common checks in Iron Valiant.</p> "

Rapid Spin lets Great Tusk provide entry hazard removal for the team in games where it would not be able to win with Bulk Up, while allowing it to boost its Speed in games where it can sweep with Bulk Up. 52 Speed EVs allow Great Tusk to outspeed Garchomp after one Rapid Spin. Tera Water turns Great Tusk's Water and Ice weaknesses into resistances, allowing it to better take hits from Azumarill, Quaquaval, and Floatzel. On the other hand, Tera Steel lets Great Tusk take on Grass-type attacks such as Breloom's Bullet Seed and Meowscarada's Flower Trick, Flying-type attacks like Roaring Moon's Acrobatics, and if need be, Fairy-type attacks such as Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Bulk Up Great Tusk appreciates specially defensive teammates like Toxapex and Garganacl that can help play around fast special attackers such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult.

Rapid Spin lets it remove entry hazards and also outspeed the entire unboosted metagame at +1 Speed. An Adamant nature is preferred for maximum power; however, it can outspeed Timid Gholdengo and Chi-Yu with a Jolly nature. Tera Ground significantly boosts Headlong Rush, notably making it OHKO Toxapex and Koraidon while 2HKOing Alomomola. It also removes Great Tusk's weakness to Fairy-type attacks, notably Dazzling Gleam from Miraidon and Moonblast from Flutter Mane. Alternatively, Tera Fighting lets it break through Corviknight with more ease and be less weak to Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle. Koraidon is a phenomenal teammate, as it sets sun to activate Protosynthesis, and it can also bring Great Tusk in via U-turn. Similarly, Miraidon and Iron Bundle can also pivot into Great Tusk, which lets it threaten all their checks. Standard defensive teammates like Clodsire, Corviknight, Toxapex, and Iron Treads are appreciated for helping Great Tusk check offensive threats, and offensive Great Tusk needs this help more than defensive variants.

Alternatively, Play Rough deals high damage to Chien-Pao and Koraidon.

Tera Fairy makes Great Tusk immune to Dragon-type moves from Koraidon and Miraidon. With Tera Water, Great Tusk resists Ice-type moves from Chien-Pao and Flare Blitz from Koraidon. Tera Ghost grants an immunity to Fighting-type moves from Koraidon and Rapid Spin from opposing Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Koraidon is a great teammate, as it can set up sun for Great Tusk, while it, in return, threatens or cripples walls that check Koraidon, making it easier for Koraidon to deal with them.

Knock Off and Rapid Spin capitalize on Great Tusk's ability to force switches, potentially crippling the likes of Corviknight, Pelipper, and Alomomola and removing entry hazards in a pinch. Moreover, Knock Off is very useful for popping Gholdengo's Air Balloon. Stone Edge is an alternative to Rapid Spin, enabling a 2HKO on Pelipper and Tera Flying Kingambit. Tera Ground amps up Headlong Rush against foes such as Tera Fairy Miraidon and Annihilape, as well as 2HKOing common Tera Fairy walls like Toxapex and Skeledirge. Tera Fighting boosts Close Combat instead, securing a 2HKO on Corviknight. Tera Fighting also retains a handy resistance to Chien-Pao and Kingambit's Sucker Punch while eliminating an exploitable weakness to Chien-Pao's Ice Shard. Both Tera types provide the necessary boost to OHKO Koraidon and 2HKO Alomomola after Stealth Rock damage. Great Tusk boasts perfect offensive synergy with Miraidon by pressuring Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu. In return, Miraidon scares out Corviknight, Pelipper, and Alomomola. Koraidon pairs nicely with Great Tusk as well, activating Protosynthesis, threatening Corviknight, and overwhelming shared checks in Pelipper, bulky Great Tusk, and Alomomola. In exchange, Great Tusk frightens Toxapex and Skeledirge. Gothitelle traps and removes Corviknight, Pelipper, Alomomola, bulky Great Tusk, and Dondozo, facilitating a late-game sweep.

While boasting less firepower than Headlong Rush, Earthquake has more PP and avoids defense drops, Toxapex's Baneful Bunker, and Rocky Helmet damage from defensive Great Tusk and Alomomola. Boosted Close Combat hits Corviknight for massive amounts of damage and OHKOes Breloom lacking Focus Sash. Alternatively, boosted Knock Off OHKOes offensive Air Balloon Gholdengo and cripples Pelipper and Dondozo. Rapid Spin allows Great Tusk to outpace the entire unboosted metagame after one use and remove entry hazards from Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Substitute can set up a buffer against revenge killers—especially special variants such as Miraidon, Iron Bundle, and Flutter Mane—in the process of boosting past a check like Corviknight. It also allows Great Tusk to avoid status, easing setup against Pokemon such as Toxapex and Clodsire. Tera Ground powers up Great Tusk's main STAB move, notably securing an OHKO on Iron Bundle with Headlong Rush and Toxapex with +1 Earthquake. Tera Steel grants resistances to Ice-, Flying-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type moves instead, potentially flipping the matchup against Chien-Pao, Brave Bird Corviknight, Flutter Mane, and Miraidon. It also allows Headlong Rush variants to avoid Baneful Bunker's poison. Paired with Knock Off, Tera Steel can even allow Great Tusk to overwhelm Pelipper lacking Surf. A Jolly nature may be used to outspeed Modest Chi-Yu, but is generally inferior to an Adamant nature due to a noticeable drop in power. Great Tusk fits well on both balance and offensive teams as a threatening wincon that can compress entry hazard removal. It is imperative to pair Great Tusk with teammates that can take advantage of obstacles like Pelipper, Alomomola, and Dondozo; Breloom on hyper offense, Gothitelle and Walking Wake on balance, and Miraidon and Iron Bundle on both archetypes can help in this regard. Similarly, Koraidon and Chien-Pao can lure in or overwhelm these shared obstacles on both balance and hyper offense; the former also activates Great Tusk's Protosynthesis. Focus Sash Breloom especially appreciates Great Tusk removing entry hazards, overwhelming Corviknight, and potentially luring Air Balloon Gholdengo in and punishes it with Knock Off. Great Tusk requires a defensive backbone on balance teams against the likes of Miraidon, Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, and Flutter Mane.

Iron Hands also appreciates Great Tusk's ability to keep entry hazards off the field so it doesn't get worn down. Wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant and Breloom appreciate Great Tusk's ability to threaten Poison-types such as Clodsire and Skuntank, allowing them to continue rampaging against the opponent. Due to it being an amazing special attacker, Iron Valiant in particular can threaten physical walls like Quagsire, Sableye, and Dondozo, which like to switch into Great Tusk. Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo, Quaquaval, and Slither Wing pressure special attackers faster than Great Tusk such as Choice Specs Greninja, Dragapult, and opposing Iron Valiant. Gallade is also a really nice partner to handle Pokemon such as Amoonguss, who would otherwise beat Great Tusk one-on-one, thanks to its Psychic STAB attacks.</p> "

Clodsire appreciates the removal of Ground-types like Ting-Lu and Iron Treads as well as the aforementioned Ice-types and Gastrodon appreciates the removal of Grass-types such as Meowscarada and Breloom. In return, Clodsire and Gastrodon switch into Water-type attacks from Quaquaval and Pelipper and set entry hazards to enhance Great Tusk's wallbreaking. Furthermore, Clodsire cripples Quagsire and Rotom-W with Toxic and Gastrodon prevents setup with Clear Smog. Sandy Shocks and Garchomp can aid against Corviknight and Amoonguss to alleviate Steel and Poison matchups, respectively.</p> "

Earthquake provides great coverage against many Pokemon in the tier, such as Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Gholdengo. Thunderous Kick is a powerful Fighting-type move that lowers the target's Defense by one stage; this can be helpful in taking down opposing Pokemon that would otherwise halt Great Tusk like opposing Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Knock Off can cripple foes by removing their items, which is great against a lot of Pokemon, as it gets rid of annoying items such as Heavy-Duty Boots, Leftovers, and opposing Covert Cloak from Pokemon such as Garganacl, opposing Great Tusk, and Skeledirge. Rapid Spin is a potent utility move that allows Great Tusk to remove entry hazards from the user's side, while Spikes is an alternative to Rapid Spin, as it allows Great Tusk to set up hazards of its own if the user's team already has reliable hazard removal. Shore Up is a good recovery move, as it gets powered up by sand, and Great Tusk can use it often due to its decent Speed and bulk. Covert Cloak is the best item choice for Great Tusk, as it allows it to shrug off secondary effects from moves like Mortal Spin, Thunderous Kick, and Salt Cure without getting punished. This EV spread allows Great Tusk to maximize its physical bulk while still outspeeding some slower Pokemon such as maximum Speed Azumarill and base 100 Speed Pokemon like Volcarona after a well-timed Rapid Spin. Maximizing Attack instead of HP is an alternative option due to Great Tusk's impressive base Attack stat; however, maximizing HP is the preferred way to go to maximize overall bulk. Tera Water allows Great Tusk to turn the tables on physically offensive Water-types such as Azumarill, Palafin, and Gyarados; this allows Great Tusk to tank their STAB moves if needed. Additionally, Tera Ghost is an option to block Rapid Spin from opposing Great Tusk and punish them for not carrying Knock Off. Good partners for Great Tusk include Corviknight, Tyranitar, Slowking, and Toxapex; these Pokemon can provide a way to take on special attacks and help pivot Great Tusk into the battle. Tyranitar can also set up sand, which can increase Great Tusk's Shore Up recovery.</p> "

It also has a very strong offensive presence and has utility moves in Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock to back it up. Headlong Rush is an amazing STAB move, letting Great Tusk force out Pokemon such as Heatran, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge very well. Earthquake can be used for a no-drawback STAB move, but the lack in power is certainly noticeable. Close Combat allows Great Tusk to annihilate Pokemon like Kingambit, and Ferrothorn, and it does a nice chunk to Rotom-W on the switch. Rapid Spin provides reliable entry hazard control, which is especially useful because Great Tusk forces out common Stealth Rock users like Heatran and Mega Tyranitar. It also lets Great Tusk outspeed foes like Iron Valiant, non-Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Tornadus-T. Ice Spinner lets Great Tusk hit Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Tornadus-T for good damage. Heavy-Duty Boots gives Great Tusk an entry hazard immunity and allows it to safely Rapid Spin, while Leftovers gives it passive recovery and lets it reliably check Pokemon like Kingambit and Garchomp. Icium Z allows Great Tusk to immediately remove Pokemon like Garchomp and Tornadus while also taking advantage of Tera Grass Heatran. Booster Energy can be used to improve Great Tusk's already great offensive output, but since it is a one-time use item, it can be quite unreliable. Tera Water improves the matchup into Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Floatzel. Tera Ground removes Great Tusk's Fairy and Psychic weakness and bolsters its offensive output, letting it OHKO Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Volcarona. Tera Steel gives Great Tusk resistances to the majority of its weaknesses, letting it KO Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko after luring them. Gholdengo and Kingambit make excellent partners for Great Tusk, as Gholdengo safely handles Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant while Kingambit can force out and Pursuit Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Dragapult. Great Tusk is commonly used as setup fodder against Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Volcarona, so partners like Clodsire and Dragonite can support it in that case. Entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn appreciate Rapid Spin support from Great Tusk, as it lets them keep entry hazards up while removing opposing ones, preventing the team from being worn down quickly. Stealth Rock-weak wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y also appreciate entry hazard removal from Great Tusk, as it lets them come in multiple times and poke holes in the opposition.</p> "

Its defensive typing and high Speed make it a good answer to Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Walking Wake. Dazzling Gleam is this set's only attacking move, letting it hit Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Iron Valiant and prevents it from being shut down by Taunt from Pokemon like Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Greninja. Wish gives Scream Tail a recovery move while letting it heal teammates such as Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Hatterene that lack reliable recovery and are vulnerable to being overwhelmed by repeated hits. Protect synergizes well with Wish, making it much more reliable as a recovery move. Additionally, Protect scouts the intentions of Choice-locked Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Hisuian Zoroark. Encore prevents setup sweepers like Volcarona, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Bulk Up Great Tusk from using Scream Tail as a setup opportunity, letting Scream Tail's teammates switch in and take advantage of these threats. It can also be used to annoy passive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Dondozo. Tera Fairy gives Scream Tail better matchups against Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Hisuian Zoroark, with the former two being susceptible to being OHKOed by Dazzling Gleam. Alternatively, Tera Water lets Scream Tail maintain a solid defensive typing while also helping it check Walking Wake, Skeledirge, and Greninja. With a Timid nature, 152 Speed EVs let Scream Tail outspeed Hydreigon, while 236 Special Defense EVs ensure that Scream Tail gets a Special Defense boost with Protosynthesis under sun, letting it more easily take on threats such as Walking Wake and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 84 SpD / 172 Spe with a Calm nature lets Scream Tail outspeed unboosted Baxcalibur and Great Tusk and pass beefier Wishes.</p> <p>Scream Tail fits on many sun, balance, and stall teams thanks to its bulk, ability to pass Wish to teammates, and create momentum with Encore. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo make for good teammates, as they are able to check Greninja and Ceruledge, respectively. Moreover, Toxapex also checks Pokemon like Iron Moth and Glimmora as well as spread status, making Encore much more of a detriment to setup sweepers like Volcarona and Iron Valiant, while Dondozo blanket checks physically oriented Pokemon that can overwhelm Scream Tail, namely Dragon Dance Baxcalibur, Booster Energy Roaring Moon, and Ceruledge. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for excellent teammates, as a lack of hazards means that Scream Tail can accomplish feats such as surviving two Choice Specs Greninja Hydro Pumps from full HP. Additionally, Great Tusk appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Scream Tail answers such as Kingambit. Torkoal is a great teammate thanks to its sun activating Scream Tail's Protosynthesis. In addition, Torkoal very much appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Pokemon like Kingambit. Meanwhile, Scream Tail is able to sponge special attacks from the likes of Walking Wake. Under sun, Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Brute Bonnet appreciate Scream Tail facilitating their sweeps with its combination of Encore and Wish, keeping them healthy while leveraging setup opportunities for them. Hydreigon is another excellent offensive partner, checking Gholdengo and finding more opportunities to set up Substitute thanks to Scream Tail's Wish.</p> "

Wish and Protect provide Scream Tail with recovery, with the latter also scouting Choice-locked Pokemon such as Dragapult and Kartana. Dazzling Gleam punishes Great Tusk and Iron Valiant and prevents them from freely exploiting Scream Tail. Encore pairs excellently with Scream Tail's high Speed, allowing it to shut down setup sweepers such as Urshifu-R, Cresselia, and Garchomp for its teammates to defeat. Leftovers provides Scream Tail with recovery that makes it less susceptible to being exploited by Wish, granting Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Heatran free switches. The given EVs maximize Scream Tail's bulk while allowing it to outspeed Enamorus and shut down Calm Mind variants with Encore. An alternative spread of 120 HP / 236 SpD / 152 Spe can be used to outspeed Hydreigon while receiving a Special Defense boost in Mega Charizard Y's sun, further amplifying Scream Tail's bulk and allowing it to check Charizard under sun. Tera Steel grants a resistance to Ice- and Fairy-type attacks from Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant in a pinch, while Tera Fairy ensures Scream Tail resists Pursuit from Weavile and Mega Tyranitar and increases the power of Dazzling Gleam to potentially 2HKO and OHKO Garchomp and Iron Valiant, respectively. Scream Tail fits best on defensively oriented teams that appreciate its unique defensive attributes while being able to support it sufficiently in return. Pokemon with unreliable recovery such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Assault Vest Toxapex appreciate Scream Tail's high-HP Wishes, while in return they check Pokemon Scream Tail struggles with such as Mega Scizor and Volcarona. Due to its reliance on Protect and Leftovers for passive recovery, entry hazard control from teammates such as the aforementioned Great Tusk and Tornadus-T can help mitigate its recovery. Scream Tail's passive nature means it can be exploited by Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, so Pokemon that aid against them while providing a more dangerous presence such as Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Swords Dance Gliscor pair well with it.</p> "

These traits make it a natural fit on more offensively-minded teams looking for a way to offensively check other fast attackers.</li> <li>Flutter Mane can really struggle against Tera Fire Koraidon because Flutter Mane's best move against it is an unboosted Shadow Ball.

Its Fairy typing additionally lets it pivot into Miraidon's and Walking Wake's Draco Meteor and force them out with Moonblast. Psyshock is crucial coverage, denting Clodsire, Iron Moth, and opposing Assault Vest Flutter Mane. Thunderbolt targets common switch-ins to Moonblast in Toxapex and Corviknight. Tera Fire Mystical Fire secures a 2HKO on Iron Treads, which becomes an OHKO in sun. Shadow Ball may be run instead to 2HKO Skeledirge and check Espathra and opposing Flutter Mane more reliably. Tera Fire also grants resistances to Chi-Yu's Fire-type moves, Iron Bundle's Ice-type moves, Gholdengo's Make It Rain, and Iron Moth's Fiery Dance. Tera Fairy can be run over Tera Fire to OHKO Miraidon, 2HKO Ting-Lu, and gain a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. The given EV spread lets Flutter Mane avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage and outspeed Chi-Yu. Flutter Mane fits best on balance and bulky offensive teams as a non-passive means of checking Iron Bundle. Miraidon, Koraidon, Great Tusk, and Chien-Pao synergize superbly as offensive teammates, appreciating Flutter Mane's ability to stifle Iron Bundle for a while. Alongside Miraidon, Flutter Mane can quickly overwhelm shared checks in Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Clodsire while also denting Toxapex and Corviknight a lot harder with Thunderbolt, courtesy of Electric Terrain. Similarly, Koraidon's Orichalcum Pulse activates Protosynthesis and boosts Mystical Fire, drastically raising Flutter Mane's damage output. In addition, Koraidon, Great Tusk, and Chien-Pao can all take advantage of Iron Treads, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Flutter Mane is exceptionally frail on the physical side, so proper support against Chien-Pao, Koraidon, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk is a must. Moreover, Flutter Mane cannot hold off Iron Bundle indefinitely and fails to check Miraidon and Walking Wake safely. A defensive backbone consisting of Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clodsire can help check these threats. Clodsire and Iron Treads can also hold off the dangerous Double Dance Miraidon, which can otherwise use Flutter Mane as setup bait.</p> "

Mystical Fire hits Steel-types such as Klefki and Iron Treads. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to punish specially defensive switch-ins like Dragalge, Blissey, and Clodsire. Flutter Mane can run Power Gem to pressure Fire teams, OHKOing foes like Volcarona and Torkoal, and it also benefits from Protosynthesis allowing it to outspeed Scovillain under the sun. Additionally, Flutter Mane usually goes with either Thunderbolt or Energy Ball. Both are useful against Water teams, with the former helping against Toxapex and Pelipper while the latter deals with Gastrodon and Quagsire. Choice Specs further enhances Flutter Mane's wallbreaking power, allowing it to overwhelm foes such as Ting-Lu after some chip damage.</p> <p>On Fairy teams, Flutter Mane is a menacing wallbreaker that excels at taking down slower foes such as Hydreigon, Skeledirge, and Corviknight. When paired with Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane forms an offensive core that's able to alternate between Fairy-, Ghost-, and Fighting-type STAB to take down a wide range of enemies. Flutter Mane can handle Psychic-type foes such as Espathra and Hatterene, while Iron Valiant takes care of Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Flutter Mane can fall back on either Hatterene or Tinkaton when faced with an unfavorable matchup. Both of these Pokemon provide dependable defensive options and some type of entry hazard control, but Hatterene is particularly useful due to it breaking down walls like Dondozo and Clodsire. Flutter Mane also pairs well with setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Mimikyu, as it is able to poke holes in the opponent's team, allowing them to clean late-game. In return, Azumarill can take care of priority users, such as Ceruledge and Chien-Pao. In terms of support options, Flutter Mane can rely on Fairy's Prankster users, Klefki and Grimmsnarl, to set up dual screens, therefore allowing it to withstand hits such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Grimmsnarl can then bring in Flutter Mane relatively safely thanks to Parting Shot. Klefki's Spikes and Tinkaton's Stealth Rocks also support Flutter Mane in breaking its checks such as Iron Hands and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard stacking proves particularly useful against less bulky teams, as it highly limits their capacity to scout Flutter Mane without having to sacrifice a member in the process.</p> "

Mystical Fire threatens Steel-types such as Corviknight and Iron Treads, while Psyshock revenge kills Choice Scarf Iron Moth and hits specially bulky Pokemon like Clodsire.

Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Swords Dance Ceruledge are valuable teammates that function as back-up late-game cleaners, especially against types Flutter Mane can struggle with such as Poison and Steel.

Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to break through most Poison cores on its own with proper hazard support, most notably 2HKOing Clodsire, which otherwise walls it. Alternatively, Mystical Fire lets Flutter Mane break through defensive Steel-types like Iron Treads and and surprise more offensive Steel-types like Scizor behind Reflect, while Energy Ball targets would-be Rock-, Water-, and Ground-type walls like Garganacl and Gastrodon. The given EVs let Flutter Mane outspeed Spectrier, always survive +1 Dragonite's Earthquake, and almost always win the one-on-one matchup against Ting-Lu by having a 15/16 chance to survive its Heavy Slam and a 78% chance to 2HKO it with Moonblast in return after Leftovers recovery, using the minimum HP and Defense EVs possible.</p> <p>Bulky Choice Specs Flutter Mane takes advantage of its unexpected bulk to create surprise KOs, such as versus Dragon Dance Dragonite, while retaining its ability to remove key threats like Skeledirge, Corviknight, and Galarian Slowking. For this reason, setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Calm Mind Hatterene are strong partners, as they can take advantage of the holes that Flutter Mane creates in defensive cores. Iron Valiant is another strong partner, as it can take advantage of both the specially defensive Pokemon that Flutter Mane may not be able to remove, such as Hisuian Goodra, Alolan Muk, and Heatran, while creating a generally strong offensive core. As Flutter Mane is slower than Chien-Pao and opposing Flutter Mane, Choice Scarf Pokemon such as the Enamorus and the aforementioned Iron Valiant are necessary to handle these threats. Choice Scarf Enamorus in particular is a strong partner, as it can reduce the necessity of Flutter Mane on the field while threatening its own powerful late-game cleanup with Contrary Superpower, supporting its team with Healing Wish, and using Iron Head to KO opposing Flutter Mane after hazard chip; it also has the added benefit of having a stronger matchup versus Choice Scarf Meowscarada than Iron Valiant. On the other hand, Choice Scarf Iron Valiant is more immediately threatening with a Choice Scarf, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Iron Moth and Gengar, Chlorophyll Scovillain, and Slush Rush Cetitan, and OHKO threats that Enamorus could only dream of removing, such as Ice Shard Chien-Pao. Flutter Mane also struggles versus Steel-types like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Choice Scarf Iron Treads, so support from Klefki and Tinkaton, along with offensive checks like Azumarill, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus, allows Flutter Mane to break through these cores much more reliably. The Poison-type matchup is particularly difficult, so Steel-types like Klefki and Tinkaton and Magic Bounce support from Hatterene help Flutter Mane, as they can provide hazard support while blocking or punishing Toxic Spikes. In return, Flutter Mane can pressure Clodsire and Galarian Slowking and chip Alolan Muk by capitalizing on the lack of switch-ins to the combination of Psyshock, Moonblast, Shadow Ball, and entry hazards.</p> "

Due to Flutter Mane's naturally low HP stat, Pain Split is an effective way to increase its longevity while notably annoying Chansey and being ineffective for Imposter users. Tera Fairy boosts Moonblast's damage while shedding Flutter Mane's Ghost weakness, making it useful against Knock Off and stray Ghost-type moves. Tera Ghost further boosts Astral Barrage, helping Flutter Mane break past walls like Calm Mind Ice Scales Arceus formes, and helps defensively against Dialga-O's Revelation Dance. Tera Steel prevents potential revenge killing from Iron Bundle's Boomburst and Koraidon's Gigaton Hammer, as well as resisting Dialga-O's Revelation Dance. Flutter Mane pairs very well with other special attackers, such as Palkia-O, Eternatus, and setup Arceus formes, that place heavy pressure on opposing special walls like Chansey and Ice Scales Dialga-O. Setup Arceus formes can also inflict Chansey with poison using Toxic or Mortal Spin, greatly increasing Flutter Mane's capability of stalling it out of recovery. Defensive pivots like Ting-Lu can provide entry hazard support, deny momentum from Chansey, and pivot Flutter Mane in safely. Paralysis support from the likes of Ting-Lu can also slow down the troublesome Zacian, which outspeeds and threatens Flutter Mane.

Checking the latter two Pokemon and its access to Will-O-Wisp distinguishes Slither Wing from Pelipper, which would otherwise outclass it as a pivot into Great Tusk. U-turn generates momentum for Slither Wing's team against Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge, and it importantly allows Slither Wing to avoid being trapped by Gothitelle. Close Combat OHKOes Iron Bundle and Chi-Yu and 2HKOes Miraidon, which are thresholds Body Press fails to reach. Will-O-Wisp cripples Great Tusk—meaning Slither Wing is not reduced to Bulk Up fodder by non-Substitute sets—Annihilape, Breloom, and Kingambit, and it additionally punishes Pokemon such as Toxapex and Corviknight for switching in. Tera Water resists Fire-type attacks from Koraidon and Chi-Yu, Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle, and Water-type attacks from Iron Bundle and Palafin, allowing for a last-ditch counterattack with either Will-O-Wisp or Close Combat. The given EVs outspeed Adamant Breloom with the remainder put in physical bulk. On its own, Slither Wing struggles to take on Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and special threats including Miraidon, Flutter Mane, and Walking Wake, so checks to them—such as Toxapex and Clodsire, which can handle all of them between the pair—are essential teammates. Entry hazard removal from Great Tusk or Iron Treads is also greatly appreciated, since even Heavy-Duty Boots variants are susceptible to opposing Great Tusk's Knock Off. The former Pokemon can also use Knock Off to remove opposing Rocky Helmet, allowing U-turn to be spammed more freely. Toxapex, Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu especially enjoy Slither Wing's ability to check Great Tusk and Breloom for them. Koraidon is a notable partner, as its sun increases Morning Sun's recovery and activates Slither Wing's Protosynthesis. Wallbreakers, such as Miraidon, Chien-Pao, Iron Bundle, and Gothitelle, also appreciate the U-turn support Slither Wing provides.</p> "

When it comes to the item slot, Heavy-Duty Boots is perhaps the most straightforward item for Sandy Shocks, as being a pivot, Sandy Shocks gaining an immunity to hazards, which allows it to come in and wreak havoc many more times per game. However, Expert Belt provides a much-appreciated power boost, especially when going Modest for extra damage, since Sandy Shocks's Electric + Ground + Fairy coverage hits nearly the entire metagame super effectively. In particular, it guarantees that Earth Power will always 2HKO Clodsire and guarantees the OHKO on bulky Kingambit.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks shines on momentum-based bulky offense teams, so other Pokemon that can maintain momentum such as Choice item Dragapult, Meowscarada, Slowking, Rotom-W, and Scizor, as well as Eject Button users like offensive Great Tusk are good teammates. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Meowscarada, Garchomp, and Great Tusk is also excellent, since the hazard chip will stack with the numerous switches forced by Sandy Shocks. Additional Stealth Rock users in particular are appreciated because they free Sandy Shocks's fourth moveslot up to run Spikes or Thunderbolt more freely. Meowscarada is an excellent choice with several of its sets, as its Knock Off removes the Heavy-Duty Boots that Sandy Shocks's switch-ins rely on to not get worn down by hazards, it can set hazards itself, its U-turn forms the potent VoltTurn combination with Sandy Shocks, and its Flower Trick is extremely threatening to the Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu that can tank Sandy Shocks's Volt Switch assault. If not running Heavy-Duty Boots, Sandy Shocks can be worn down itself by Spikes, minimizing its effectiveness, and so hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight form prurient teammates. Sandy Shocks's relative frailty and weakness-laden typing means that faster Pokemon like Meowscarada, Garchomp, Dragapult, Cinderace, and Walking Wake, as well as Choice Scarf users such as specific variants of Rotom-W and Gholdengo, can immediately force Sandy Shocks out, lest its meager bulk causes it to be unceremoniously OHKOed. Strong priority moves like Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet present similar issues. As such, additional, more defensive pivots such as the aforementioned Corviknight and Rotom-W serve double duty, as they can act as a buffer against these threats without completely ceding momentum.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks's appeal comes from its high Special Attack and ability to come in at +1 Speed with Booster Energy to pressure common spinners, letting it be one of the best offensive entry hazard setters in the tier. With the lack of reliable Ground-resistant Pokemon, Earth Power becomes incredibly spammable, targeting opposing hazard setters like Glimmora, Garganacl, Iron Treads, Torkoal, and Iron Moth. Earth Power also deals massive damage to Great Tusk, limiting its spinning capabilities. Thunderbolt is an excellent second STAB move, as it targets Flying-types such as Corviknight, Pelipper, and Iron Jugulis, as well as heavily punishing Rotom-W. Thunderbolt also hits threatening Water-types, 2HKOing Azumarill, Dondozo, and Slowking while also OHKOing Greninja. Both of these STAB moves 2HKO Toxapex as well. Stealth Rock or Spikes are very useful on Sandy Shocks because it threatens out almost every entry hazard remover, namely Great Tusk, Torkoal, Corviknight, Cinderace, Glimmora, and Talonflame. Tera Fairy Tera Blast is the perfect coverage tool for Sandy Shocks because it targets threats that would normally wall it, such as Hydreigon and Meowscarada, and it can land surprise KOs on would-be switch-ins like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Roaring Moon while also 2HKOing Garchomp. The Fairy typing has great defensive utility as well, resisting priority moves such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit and Meowscarada and Mach Punch from Breloom.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Its ability to immediately get up entry hazards and threaten other hazard setters is instrumental for the success of hyper offense, and not activating Glimmora's Toxic Debris in the hyper offense mirror match is very useful. On bulky offense teams, it can offer more flexibility, setting up hazards and pressuring opposing defensive cores. With its great Speed stat after a Protosynthesis boost, Sandy Shocks threatens offensive Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed it like Dragapult. It also forces damage on bulkier Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Rotom-W, so teammates such as Iron Moth and Dragonite that appreciate these being weakened work best. Ground-immune teammates like Dragonite and Rotom-W also help Sandy Shocks on bulky offense teams, switching into foes like Great Tusk. Opposing Meowscarada is problematic for this set, as it essentially forces it to Terastallize, so teammates that can handle it like Kingambit and Iron Valiant are also very useful. Amoonguss can generally take advantage of Sandy Shocks too, threatening Spore on teammates, so Gholdengo is another great teammate; it also blocks Rapid Spin and Defog.</p> "

          "name": "Gravity (Ground)",
          "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks is an incredibly useful part of any Ground team thanks to its combination of being able to threaten common types that Ground struggles against such as Flying and Water and good team support in Gravity, making its teammates' and its Ground STAB attacks more threatening without any Ground-immune Pokemon. Its Speed tier is also good enough to outspeed Urshifu-R, a big threat to Ground-type teams, while allowing Ground teams to muscle past Moltres Flying teams, which can outlast Ground teams. Gravity not only allows it to hit Flying types such as Thundurus-T and Zapdos that don't care about its Electric STAB moves, but it also lets its teammates such as Landorus, Ursaluna, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk spam their Ground-type attacks without worrying about Ground-immune Pokemon. While Gravity is certainly useful, it comes with the drawback that opposing Ground-type moves from Pokemon such as Landorus-T or Iron Treads cannot be avoided. Earth Power is its Ground STAB attack, which also benefits from the Gravity that Sandy Shocks sets up and hits Electric-immune Pokemon such as Clodsire and Quagsire hard. This, along with Thunderbolt, allows Sandy Shocks to threaten the whole of Water teams. Finally, Volt Switch lets Sandy Shocks pivot out into a teammate that can either take an attack for it or deal big damage. Heavy-Duty Boots is Sandy Shocks's item of choice, allowing it to switch in multiple times to set Gravity and pivot out with Volt Switch without worrying about residual hazard damage. An alternative EV spread of 48 HP / 208 SpA / 252 Spe can be used for a Speed-boosting Protosynthesis, but this spread worsens the chance of a 2HKO on Quagsire.</p> <p>Landorus is a great teammate for Sandy Shocks, as Landorus's already-scary STAB- and Sheer Force-boosted Earth Power gets even scarier when almost nothing is immune to it. Additionally, Landorus can take Ground-type attacks aimed at Sandy Shocks by virtue of its Flying typing while hitting Grass- and Fairy-types hard with Sheer Force-boosted Sludge Bomb. In return, Sandy Shocks can pivot Landorus in using Volt Switch, as well as offensively threatening Water-types that threaten Landorus such as Urshifu-R. Ursaluna is another good teammate, as it is simply terrifying when Flying-types cannot safely switch into its Earthquake alongside being able to smash Grass-types with Fire Punch and crush Ghost-types with the sheer power of its Guts-boosted Earthquakes and its ability to deal with Spectrier thanks to Guts. Additionally, Ursaluna's bulk lets it take a hit when it switches in through Sandy Shocks' Volt Switch. Great Tusk provides Rapid Spin support on Bulk Up sets and speed control by virtue of its Choice Scarf set alongside Ice Spinner to help Sandy Shocks deal with opposing Landorus and Grass-types such as Hisuian Lilligant. Additionally, Great Tusk's power under Gravity cannot be understated, as its Ground STAB moves deal serious damage and can easily break through opposing teams. Clodsire can take Grass- and Fighting-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Flower Trick and Zamazenta’s Close Combat with ease alongside forming a chip damage core with Sandy Shocks through Volt Switch and Toxic damage. Additionally, Clodsire's Water immunity lets it soak up attacks such as Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Basculegion-F's Water STAB move of choice, and it is generally a rather good special wall. Quagsire is a good defensive partner for Sandy Shocks, as it can wall Chien-Pao and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and threaten them back with Body Press, as well as being able to set hazards. Iron Treads functions as a check to Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Flutter Mane who can take Sandy Shocks' attacks and threaten it back while also having Ice-type coverage to hit Flying- and Grass-types. Alongside those attributes, Iron Treads also has Knock Off, allowing it to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from common users such as Quagsire and Amoonguss, letting Sandy Shocks gradually wear them down over the course of the game. Finally, Ting-Lu's sheer bulk allows it to take strong hits such as Dragonite's boosted Extreme Speed that Sandy Shocks can't while setting up hazards to chip away at common answers to Sandy Shocks such as opposing Ting-Lu.</p> "

Heavy Slam utilizes Iron Treads's fairly hefty size to hit Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Mimikyu hard; however, Iron Head can be used as a more consistent STAB to nail heavier targets such as Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Garganacl. Ice Spinner provides great coverage alongside Iron Treads's STAB moves, nailing Grass-types such as Meowscarada before Protean activates and Amoonguss while also nailing Garchomp and Dragonite. Knock Off provides good team support by getting rid of the foe's item, such as Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from the likes of Dragonite, Volcarona, and Garchomp, whereas Volt Switch allows Iron Treads to pivot out of Pokemon that wall it such as Corviknight and Dondozo.</p> <p>Corviknight is a fantastic partner for Iron Treads, as it can take Fighting- and Ground-type moves while Iron Treads takes on Electric-types such as Iron Hands and Magnezone for Corviknight. Corviknight can also keep entry hazards off the field with Defog, aiding in Iron Treads's longevity and letting it forgo Rapid Spin. Gholdengo is another great partner, as it not only also helps against Fighting-types that Corviknight can't handle such as Iron Valiant, but it also overwhelms physical walls such as Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Dondozo. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Tinkaton, Orthworm, and Bronzong also aid in Iron Treads sweeping. Tinkaton specifically ensures Stealth Rock being set due to Mold Breaker while having a decent offensive presence thanks to Gigaton Hammer being so powerful. Orthworm provides a Ground immunity, easing pressure off other teammates such as Corviknight, all while also having Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also take on Fire-type moves that are aimed at Iron Treads. Kingambit is a great mid- to late-game sweeper that appreciates Iron Treads's ability to punch holes early game or clean up after Kingambit has punched holes itself, providing the team with multiple avenues of winning.</p> "

Iron Treads should be used as a lead on hyper offense teams, so other support teammates and sweepers are natural partners. Dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko allow their sweeping teammates another layer of support and safety, and they can use Taunt to consistently deny Defog attempts even after Iron Treads has fainted. Common hyper offense sweepers, like Mega Gyarados, Galarian Moltres, Kingambit, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur appreciate Iron Treads laying Stealth Rock while keeping hazards off at the same time. The former two in particular appreciate this, as Mega Gyarados is weak to Stealth Rock before mega evolving, while Galarian Moltres often prefers other items over Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> "

Tera Fairy can be run instead to gain an immunity to Miraidon's and Walking Wake's Draco Meteor and a resistance to Koraidon's Fighting-type STAB moves. Miraidon is a fantastic partner for Iron Hands, as it sets Electric Terrain; this gives Iron Hands much better wallbreaking capabilities. Furthermore, Iron Hands threatens all of Miraidon's checks, including Iron Treads, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, and Miraidon can pivot it in. Corviknight is a good partner thanks to its Ground immunity letting it pivot into Great Tusk. Iron Bundle is another great partner for being able to check offensive Pokemon that can overwhelm Iron Hands while also pivoting Iron Hands in with U-turn. Great Tusk pairs well with Iron Hands as well, since it checks opposing Great Tusk, acts as a form of entry hazard removal, and checks Koraidon. Although Iron Hands can check some special attackers, its lack of consistent recovery means that it is not a reliable check in longer games; therefore, partners such as Clodsire and Iron Treads work to check Miraidon, Iron Bundle, and Flutter Mane. Gothitelle is another good partner for being able to trap and eliminate Great Tusk for Iron Hands.</p> "

It also checks threatening, almost unwallable Pokemon in the metagame, like Kingambit and Chien-Pao. However, Iron Hands is prone to getting revenge killed by common special attackers in the tier like Flutter Mane, Miraidon, Chi-Yu, and even Skeledirge, due to its nonexistent Special Defense stat; furthermore, it's also extremely slow, meaning Iron Hands is pretty much always moving last, making it a deadweight against more offensive teams.</li> <li>Wild Charge is an option over Thunder Punch that allows Iron Hands to have favorable chances of 2HKOing Skeledirge in Electric Terrain.

It also has a favorable chance to avoid the 2HKO from a Choice Band-boosted Icicle Crash from Chien-Pao. The Speed EVs allow Iron Hands to outspeed Corviknight.</li> <li>Tera Flying turns Iron Hands's Ground-type weakness into an immunity, allowing it to use Pokemon like Iron Treads, Great Tusk, and non-Whirlwind Ting-Lu as setup fodder.</li> <li>Leftovers is Iron Hands's only form of passive recovery. Punching Glove is an alternative that lets Iron Hands ignore all contact Items and moves; this means that Toxapex can't poison it with Baneful Bunker and Rocky Helmet Pokemon like Corviknight and the aforementioned Toxapex can't punish its attacks. However, Iron Hands will greatly miss Leftovers's passive recovery, as it will getting worn down very easily without it.</li> <li>Iron Hands is good at breaking holes against bulky teams thanks to its stellar offensive typing and access to Swords Dance; it should always be sent into Pokemon like Corviknight and Kingambit and either use Swords Dance to immediately threaten something as they switch out or hit them with a super effective attack. Proper prediction is necessary, however, as Iron Hands can get pivoted around easily.</li> <li>Iron Hands is best used on balance teams that are in need for a wallbreaker that can also check Chien-Pao and Kingambit.</li> <li>Miraidon is Iron Hands's best teammate, as it sets Electric Terrain, allowing for Iron Hands to better break the bulky teams its supposed to.

Iron Hands in return deals with Pokemon like Iron Treads, Ting-Lu, and Blissey for Miraidon.</li> <li>Pokemon that can check Koraidon, such as Great Tusk and Toxapex, also make for good partners, as Koraidon defeats Iron Hands one-on-one and is a threat for the teams Iron Hands is usually on.</li> <li>Entry hazard control is also recommended, as Iron Hands can't do a good job at checking Pokemon it's supposed to, like Chien-Pao and Kingambit, with Stealth Rock or Spikes up on the field. As such, spinners like Great Tusk and Iron Treads, as well as Magic Bounce Pokemon like Hatterene, make for excellent partners.</li> <li>Specially defensive walls, such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire, are recommended, as they can set Spikes for Iron Hands and check Pokemon like Miraidon and, in Clodsire's case, Flutter Mane.</li> </ul> "

Thunder Punch OHKOes Articuno and Corviknight after one Swords Dance. Ice Punch allows Iron Hands to threaten several Flying-types its STAB moves aren't very effective against, like both Landorus formes and Dragonite. Earthquake is an alternative option that allows Iron Hands to threaten several Steel- and Fire-types, OHKOing Gholdengo and 2HKOing Torkoal after one Swords Dance boost.

It fits best on Trick Room teams that benefit from its low Speed but also has enough bulk to compensate for its slowness and perform adequately on any team that appreciates the safe turns that Fake Out can provide. Iron Hands most commonly holds an Assault Vest to patch up its lower Special Defense stat and comfortably endure and trade attacks with its enemies. Another popular set foregoes Assault Vest to enable the use of Swords Dance, turning Iron Hands into a fearsome setup sweeper. With either set, Iron Hands is a reliable and well-rounded Pokemon that matches up decently into much of the metagame, although it does need to be wary of a few commonly encountered threats. Amoonguss, the tier's most common and bulkiest redirector, walls both of Iron Hands's STAB attacks and can survive two of its Ice Punches. Despite Iron Hands's massive bulk, a few especially hard-hitting Pokemon like Great Tusk and Armarouge have the offensive capability to break through it with ease. Finally, Iron Hands needs to be wary of priority blockers like Farigiraf, Indeedee-F, and Tsareena when using Fake Out.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Iron Hands can be made even bulkier by shifting some or all of its Attack EVs into HP and Defense. Moving 64 EVs into HP allows the Assault Vest Iron Hands set to survive two boosted Shadow Balls from Modest Nasty Plot Gholdengo, as well as one Overheat from a Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu. In addition to the 64 HP EVs, an additional 48 EVs can be moved into Defense to allow Iron Hands to survive two Extreme Speeds or Dragon Claws from Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite, as well as one Headlong Rush from Adamant Great Tusk. Iron Hands can also invest 124 EVs in Speed to outspeed Garchomp under Tailwind but should retain at least 100 Attack EVs and an Adamant Nature when doing so to ensure Ice Punch OHKOes Garchomp. Tera Fire can be used to prevent burns from Will-O-Wisp users like Arcanine while also providing a STAB boost to Fire Punch. Heavy Slam can be run as a coverage move if Fairy-types such as Sylveon are a concern. Finally, Belly Drum can be used in place of Swords Dance as a higher-risk, higher-reward Attack-boosting move, but losing 50% HP in the process is a high price to pay for a Pokemon that prides itself on its bulk and longevity. When using Belly Drum in combination with a Sitrus Berry, ensure that Iron Hands's HP stat is an even number so that Sitrus Berry activates after the 50% HP drop.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Iron Hands is a potent wincon, using its amazing bulk in conjunction with its perfect coverage to punch holes in faster teams that lack the means to consistently wall it and trade extremely well. Wild Charge and Close Combat are higher power options over Thunder Punch and Drain Punch that allow for a few notable benchmarks, such as having a chance to 2HKO Tera Water Skeledirge and OHKOing defensive Rotom-W after Stealth Rock and a Swords Dance, but they both greatly sacrifice longevity. Ice Punch lets it nail Ground-, Flying- and Dragon-types that resist its STAB combination such as Landorus-T, Dragonite, Zapdos, and Great Tusk. Tera Water lets Iron Hands gain a much stronger defensive type overall, preventing Ground-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types from revenge killing it while improving the rain matchup significantly. The given EV spread allows Iron Hands to KO Tapu Lele with Thunder Punch after a Swords Dance and outspeed Chansey, with the rest dumped into Special Defense to maximize its lower special bulk. Entry hazard support from Garchomp, Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, and Mega Diancie is crucial to Iron Hands, as it quickly wears down all of its checks for it to clean late-game. Future Sight support is also notable, as it allows Iron Hands to bypass would-be checks such as Buzzwole and Skeledirge. Pivots such as Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T also work well with Iron Hands, as they bring it in safely and prevent it from being worn down quickly. Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain also activates Iron Hands's Quark Drive, boosting its Attack even further. Due to its great defensive utility, it partners well with Pokemon like Slowbro and Dragapult, as it takes advantage of Dark-types that pressure these two out, with Slowbro providing Future Sight support and Dragapult taking advantage of Iron Hands’s checks like Buzzwole and Skeledirge. Due to its lack of longevity, it is a poor singular check to threats such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Kartana, so pairing it up with Pokemon like tank Garchomp, Tapu Fini, and Rotom-W to form defensive a defensive core works wonders.</p> "

Hurricane destroys many offensive Pokemon that can take Dark Pulse, including Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Quaquaval, and Volcarona. Taunt allows Iron Jugulis to function as a dangerous stallbreaker by shutting down passive walls such as Clodsire, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. It also prevents Slowking from pivoting with Chilly Reception and threats such as Dragonite, Volcarona, Polteageist, and Roaring Moon from setting up. Flamethrower hits Steel-types such as Corviknight, Kingambit, and Iron Treads. Fire Blast trades some of Flamethrower's accuracy for more power, most notably OHKOing the aforementioned Steel-types with Tera Fire. Alternatively, Earth Power OHKOes Iron Moth and lands a stronger hit on Clodsire, Garganacl, Cinderace, Iron Hands, and Toxapex. Tera Dark boosts the power of Dark Pulse, making it easier to pressure walls such as Garganacl, Rotom-W, and Toxapex with its flinch chance. Tera Flying strengthens Hurricane, OHKOing Greninja, Amoonguss, and Cinderace most of the time and 2HKOing Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge. Tera Fire strengthens Flamethrower or Fire Blast and gives Iron Jugulis crucial resistances to Iron Valiant's Moonblast, Baxcalibur's Ice Shard, and Volcarona's STAB moves.</p> <p>Iron Jugulis is best used on hyper offense teams that appreciate its ability to trouble stall teams and keep fast sweepers in check. Due to its only decent power, Iron Jugulis greatly appreciates entry hazards from teammates such as Glimmora, Greninja, Meowscarada, and Garchomp to wear down its checks. Additionally, Iron Jugulis's Stealth Rock weakness makes entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads very valuable partners; they can also pressure Clodsire and Iron Moth to free up Iron Jugulis to run a Fire-type move. Powerful wallbreakers such as Breloom, Dragapult, and Baxcalibur can soften up the opposing team for Iron Jugulis to clean up late-game. Conversely, Iron Jugulis's ability to break through special walls with Taunt opens up other special sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth. Gholdengo can also cripple walls with Choice item + Trick and handle Booster Energy Iron Valiant, one of the only threats capable of outspeeding and threatening Iron Jugulis. Iron Jugulis is also effective on rain teams, providing it with a perfectly-accurate Hurricane and featuring extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Floatzel and Walking Wake that can punch holes for it to sweep late-game. In return, Iron Jugulis threatens Amoonguss and provides a valuable Ghost resistance to take on threats such as Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark more easily.</p> "

With Toxic Spikes, it provides a form of offensive utility in order to wear down defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Dondozo, as well as offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant. Flamethrower is Iron Moth's preferred Fire-type STAB move due to its consistency, although Overheat can be run if power is preferred. Overheat is the better option on sun teams or Tera Fire variants, as Iron Moth can OHKO Baxcalibur and 2HKO Unaware Clodsire. Morning Sun grants Iron Moth valuable longevity, allowing it to find more opportunities to break walls as the game progresses. Tera Fairy removes Iron Moth's various weaknesses, including to Stealth Rock, and improves its matchups against Pokemon like Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Greninja in a pinch. Tera Fire can be a great option as well especially on sun teams, since it grants Iron Moth boost on either Flamethrower or Overheat, increasing its wallbreaking potential. Tera Flying completely negates its weakness to Ground-types by granting it an immunity, allowing it to check Great Tusk and Iron Treads.</p> <p>Iron Moth is best used on offensive teams that appreciate its role compression of it being a wallbreaker and offensive utility. Rotom-W, Great Tusk, and Meowscarada make for good teammates due to their ability to weaken walls and offensive Pokemon through Trick from the former and Knock Off from the latter two. Knock Off support in particular is beneficial for Iron Moth, since Heavy-Duty Boots can be removed from Pokemon like Baxcalibur, Tera Water Skeledirge, and Dragonite to wear them down from entry hazards into Iron Moth's KO range. Rotom-W and Meowscarada are also great pivots that can bring Iron Moth in against Amoonguss and Corviknight. Great Tusk and Garchomp can stack entry hazards with Iron Moth, allowing them to wear down offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult and Iron Valiant, as well as defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Amoonguss for other offensive teammates to take advantage of. They can also check Pokemon that Iron Moth struggles with such as opposing Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Ceruledge. Iron Moth can struggle against walls such as Toxapex, Clodsire, Garganacl, and Skeledirge, so it appreciates other offensive Pokemon that can pressure them. Hence, Choice Specs Dragapult, Covert Cloak Gholdengo, and Choice Band Great Tusk make for good teammates. Iron Moth also finds a good place on sun teams, so offensive staples such as Walking Wake and Roaring Moon appreciate Iron Moth spreading poison through Toxic Spikes and removing revenge killers like Kingambit and Breloom so that they can wallbreak more easily. Lastly, sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Iron Valiant benefit from Iron Moth removing and setting Toxic Spikes, as well as threatening Amoonguss and Tera Fairy Garganacl and Skeledirge.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Iron Moth is a threatening Agility user on hyper offense teams that can clean up or weaken opposing teams, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame after a single Agility. It also notably absorbs Toxic Spikes, which is otherwise very annoying for offensive teams. Fiery Dance is the Fire-type STAB move of choice, as it gives Iron Moth potential to snowball out of control. Psychic hits Toxapex and Clodsire super effectively, always 2HKOing the former and 2HKOing the latter after minimal chip damage, and is Iron Moth's best way to pressure Skeledirge. Dazzling gleam nails Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Miraidon, and Koraidon, whereas Energy Ball hits Ting-Lu harder and instead deals super effective damage to Garganacl and bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Dondozo. Tera Fairy boosts Dazzling Gleam, allowing Iron Moth to OHKO Miraidon and 2HKO Ting-Lu after minimal chip damage, and lets Iron Moth resist Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao and Kingambit, making it harder to revenge kill. Alternatively, Tera Grass boosts Energy Ball, enabling it to always 2HKO Ting-Lu and OHKO Garganac and Dondozo, and turns Iron Moth's Ground- and Water-type weaknesses into resistances. The given EVs allow Iron Moth to survive an unboosted Dragon Claw from Koraidon and Psyshock from Flutter Mane, with the remainder being put into Speed, notably allowing it to outspeed a Quark Drive-boosted Iron Bundle at +2. Entry hazards from typical hyper offense leads like Glimmora, Froslass, and Cloyster can weaken foes into Iron Moth's KO range. Miraidon is another good partner, as they can weaken their shared checks in Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Blissey for the other. Grimmsnarl can set Light Screen and Reflect for Iron Moth, making it easier for it to safely use Agility and harder to revenge kill. Other hyper offense staples such as Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and Great Tusk are good teammates, as they can threaten Clodsire and Ting-Lu for it, whilst Iron Moth threatens Toxapex and Corviknight for them in return. Koraidon can also notably lure Skeledirge and remove it with Stomping Tantrum as well as boost Iron Moth's Fiery Dance via sun.</p> "

Its STAB Flamethrower melts through Steel-types such as Corviknight, Scizor, and Gholdengo that its teammates are unable to handle. Discharge eviscerates Flying- and Water-types like Pelipper, Talonflame, and Toxapex. Dazzling Gleam fells the mighty Dark- and Dragon-types of the tier such as Hydreigon, Sableye, and Dragapult. For its last moveslot, Energy Ball is a nice option in the Ground matchup, being able to threaten Quagsire, Great Tusk, and Sandy Shocks along with hitting Rotom-W in the Water- and Electric-type matchups, while U-turn allows Iron Moth to safely pivot out of unfavorable matchups against Tyranitar and Dragonite and pairs nicely with Poison's Regenerator Pokemon. Fiery Dance can be an alternative to Flamethrower, with its Special Attack boosting capabilities pairing nicely with Choice Scarf to make Iron Moth unstoppable.</p> <p>Iron Moth greatly appreciates bulky teammates like Amoonguss and Skuntank providing safe switches against threats that are either bulky enough to survive Iron Moth's attacks, like Garchomp, Dondozo, and specially bulky Iron Treads, or threaten to outspeed and KO it, like Chien-Pao and Meowscarada. Physically bulky Amoonguss is Iron Moth's best friend, being able to take on nearly every physical attacker and Ground-type like Garchomp, Dondozo, Meowscarada, and Iron Hands thanks to its Ground neutrality, reliable recovery, and Spore. Physically bulky Toxapex handles most other physical threats Amoonguss is unable to, such as Chien-Pao and Ceruledge, while setting up Toxic Spikes. Specially bulky Skuntank provides a safe answer to bulky Psychic-types like Hatterene and Slowbro as well as Ghost-types like Flutter Mane and Gengar thanks to its high special bulk, good typing, and useful STAB moves. Specially defensive Clodsire provides entry hazard support with Stealth Rock, along with checking threats like Volcarona, Kilowattrel, and Blissey. Corrosion Glimmora can also provide hazard support and use Toxic to wear down opposing special walls like Clodsire, Iron Treads, Ting-Lu, and Iron Hands. Dry Skin Toxicroak deals with Barraskewda and Floatzel, which outspeed Iron Moth, along with switching into Aqua Jets from Belly Drum Azumarill thanks to its immunity to Water-type moves. It also checks many of the Dark-types Iron Moth can't handle, such as Ting-Lu, Tyranitar, and Kingambit, thanks to its Fighting-type STAB move of choice.</p> "

Its wide array of coverage options, good STAB combination, and very high Special Attack make it a difficult Pokemon to answer. Dazzling Gleam allows Iron Moth to hit Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Hydreigon, while Discharge and Energy Ball both provide coverage against Water-types; Discharge covers targets neutral to Energy Ball such as Toxapex and Pelipper, while Energy Ball is stronger and also hits Water/Ground types such as Gastrodon and Quagsire. U-turn forgoes a coverage move in order to allow Iron Moth to maintain momentum even when it cannot break through a team. Fiery Dance can be run instead of Flamethrower, forgoing a bit of power and burn chance in exchange for the potential to snowball into a sweep.</p> <p>Iron Moth pairs well with wallbreakers that can open holes for it such as Scovillain and Hisuian Arcanine. The former aids with bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Gastrodon that may give Iron Moth trouble depending on its coverage, while the latter appreciates Iron Moth's speed control and potential pivoting capabilities to destroy problematic Fire-types and special walls, including Skeledirge and Hisuian Goodra. Torkoal provides Stealth Rock, status, and Rapid Spin support as well as powering up Iron Moth's Flamethrower with the sun. Paldean Tauros-F can threaten Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Heatran that wall Iron Moth, while Iron Moth can discourage faster Pokemon such as Greninja and Iron Treads from switching in—neither of which Paldean Tauros-F wants to take on. Volcarona can aid Iron Moth in wearing down a team, as both Pokemon can make progress to help the other break through; additionally, Volcarona can heavily damage Psychic- and Dark- types such as Espathra and Ting-Lu that can give Iron Moth trouble. Finally, Iron Moth's bad bulk makes pivoting support from Cinderace, Talonflame, and Moltres appreciated to help it get in easier; Cinderace can also provide hazard control with Court Change, while Talonflame can achieve the same with Defog.</p> "

It also deals massive damage to Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Hippowdon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam: Dazzling Gleam is the best option against Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Overheat: Even with the lack of extra coverage, Overheat is so strong that very few Pokemon can safely switch into it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: Psychic is Iron Moth's best shot of winning the mirror match and doing big damage to Toxapex. It's also an option to do good damage against common bulky Tera Poison Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Annihilape, and Wo-Chien.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Acid Spray: Acid Spray can be a way to get past Skeledirge that lack Earth Power, and a good way to break down Ting-Lu's tanking capabilities.

Its Tera Fire Overheat under sun can 2HKO Arghonaut and Skeledirge, two of the best special walls in the metagame, and still deal massive damage to frailer targets at -2. Solar Beam more reliably 2HKOes Arghonaut, Toxapex, and Garganacl so that Iron Moth isn't required to Terastallize to be effective. Fiery Dance lets Iron Moth snowball and end games once the opposing team has no remaining Unaware users and is sufficiently weakened. Sludge Wave 2HKOes Astrolotl and Dragonite and OHKOes Cinderace outside of sun, which could otherwise tank an Overheat and pivot around the weakened hit. Ground-type Tera Blast OHKOes Ceruledge, Astrolotl, Skeledirge, and opposing Iron Moth with a surprise hit.</p> <p>Drought Jumbao is a required teammate to set up sun. Healing Wish can help Iron Moth offset Stealth Rock damage and get into battle late-game. Other Protosynthesis users like Roaring Moon and Great Tusk fit fantastically alongside Iron Moth. Roaring Moon's Choice Band-boosted attacks complement Iron Moth's strong special attacks, and its U-turn can bring Iron Moth in safely against a Fairy- or Steel-type switch-in. Great Tusk can remove entry hazards and switch into strong physical attackers like Roaring Moon and Kingambit. In return, Iron Moth very easily switches into Jumbao, one of Great Tusk's hard counters. Eject Button Hatterene is a fantastic teammate that helps keep Stealth Rock off the field and give Iron Moth a crucial free switch.</p> "

Although it faces some competition  from Quiver Dance Volcarona, its instant power and higher natural Speed tier gives it a niche over Volcarona. Fiery Dance allows Iron Moth to snowball quickly, while Sludge Wave forces Arghonaut and Garganacl to think twice before Terastallizing into a Fairy-type. Energy Ball 2HKOes Arghonaut, Krilowatt, and Garganacl, but Psychic maintains coverage against Arghonaut while pressuring Venomicon, Dragapult, and Clodsire harder. Ground-type Tera Blast allows Iron Moth to push past Skeledirge, Astrolotl, Clodsire, and Ceruledge, which would otherwise give it serious trouble. Dazzling Gleam is best when Iron Moth is Tera Fairy, hitting Roaring Moon and Dragapult more effectively. Tera Fairy allows Iron Moth to stomach Roaring Moon's STAB moves and Kingambit's Sucker Punch, removing them for a surprise KO. Agility helps Iron Moth sweep better, but it displaces a coverage move and is generally outclassed by Volcarona as a setup sweeper. Tera Grass is the best option, turning Iron Moth's severe Ground weakness into a resistance and boosting Energy Ball. An EV spread of 124 Def / 132 SpA / 252 Spe can be used so that Booster Energy raises Iron Moth's Speed, but the drop in power is noticeable. Booster Energy Iron Moth can also fit on sun teams to thwart typical counterplay to its Choice Specs set. Solar Beam should be run to OHKO specially defensive Garganacl at +1 and with Quark Drive active. However, Choice Specs is usually more effective against unprepared teams.</p> <p>Iron Moth fits excellently on hyper offense teams. Entry hazard setters like Meowscarada, Greninja, and Garchomp enable Iron Moth to net KOs more easily. Rapid Spin users like Caribolt and Great Tusk remove Stealth Rock to help Iron Moth leverage its good special bulk. Other hyper offense sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, Swords Dance Iron Valiant, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Scale Shot + Swords Dance Miasmaw tend to struggle with Jumbao, which Iron Moth can help deal with. Supreme Overlord Kingambit can clean up games after Iron Moth has broken holes and fainted.</p> "

Energy Ball hits Gastrodon and Garganacl while U-turn allows Iron Moth to pivot out of bad matchups, such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge. Alternatively, Psychic hits Toxapex, but it makes Iron Moth a significant momentum sink against Heatran and Mega Tyranitar. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Iron Moth to act as a pivot consistently without having to worry about entry hazard chip, which it is otherwise very vulnerable to.

Iron Moth fits well on VoltTurn offenses, specifically those including Tapu Koko, who is a natural partner for it. Tapu Koko can set Electric Terrain for Iron Moth in order to boost its Special Attack and benefits from Iron Moth bringing it in on Toxapex. Conversely, Tapu Koko can bring Iron Moth in on threats to it, such as Ferrothorn and Rillaboom.

Energy Ball hits threats such as Gastrodon, Garganacl, and Garchomp. Psychic hits Toxapex and Clodsire hard, while also having a decent chance of 2HKOing physically defensive Skeledirge. Iron Moth can also opt for Tera Blast + Tera Ground to hit Toxapex, Heatran, Skeledirge, and Clodsire all at once while removing its irritating Stealth Rock weakness. This makes Iron Moth very reliant on Terastallizing to break certain teams, however. Tera Grass should be used otherwise, as it still lessens Iron Moth's Stealth Rock weakness while also allowing it to potentially turn the tables on Garchomp, Mega Swampert, and Urshifu-R. U-turn can also be used to ease prediction and safely bring in teammates, but Iron Moth's Stealth Rock weakness makes this a risky proposition. Iron Moth needs very solid entry hazard control, so options such as Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, Cyclizar, and Great Tusk make for solid teammates; the former three can also bring Iron Moth in safely via pivoting. Tapu Koko is another great option, as Electric Terrain jacks up Iron Moth's power to titanic levels, cleanly 2HKOing Clodsire, Garchomp, and Skeledirge with Fire Blast after the Quark Drive boost. It also allows Iron Moth to deal sizable damage to physically defensive Toxapex with Fire Blast, potentially 2HKOing it after some chip. Heatran switch-ins such as Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Slowking are appreciated, as its presence makes it very hard for Iron Moth to safely use its STAB moves. The latter two can use pivot moves to bring Iron Moth in. Heatran can beat these with Tera Grass and Tera Blast, but Iron Moth will be able to use Sludge Wave on it if Terastallization is forced.

Sludge Wave is Iron Moth's other STAB attack; besides hitting opposing Dragon- and Fire-types for neutral damage, it also breaks through Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Fini. Due to the amount of Pokemon it threatens out, such as Aegislash and Mega Sableye, Iron Moth is an effective setter of Toxic Spikes; Energy Ball is an alternative, serving as coverage against opposing Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types, like Gastrodon and Tyranitar, and finally, U-turn is another alternative, as the switches Iron Moth forces out let it act as an effective offensive pivot.

Iron Moth best fits on balance and offensive teams looking for a fast and powerful special attacker with good utility. While Iron Moth can check most special attackers, even resisted hits from physical attackers like Cinderace can 2HKO it.

Iron Valiant has also wallbreaking capabilities of its own with Choice Specs and Calm Mind, allowing it to get rid of physical walls to increase Baxcalibur's threatening potential. Gholdengo and Volcarona are great teammates that provide Fairy and Fighting resistances and the ability to check and threaten the likes of Iron Valiant and Corviknight. Furthermore, Gholdengo is able to threaten the Fairy-types and Tera Fairy users in the tier such as Hatterene, Skeledirge, and Garganacl, freeing up Baxcalibur to pressure the foes with Glaive Rush, while Volcarona can utilize Baxcalibur's presence to remove its special checks like Clodsire and Blissey to sweep late-game more easily. Slowking is another good pairing that can set up Snow and pivot with Chilly Reception, consequently boosting Baxcalibur's already decent bulk.</p> "

Additionally, Baxcalibur's neutrality to Ice-type attacks allows it to combat Chien-Pao lacking Fighting-type coverage and Ice Beam Greninja. Ice Shard allows Baxcalibur to use an Adamant nature to revenge kill weakened targets such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane. Alternatively, Glaive Rush may be used instead to deal more damage to Chien-Pao and opposing Baxcalibur. Icicle Spear in conjunction with Loaded Dice is a potent combination, dealing enough damage to break past Quagsire and Corviknight with an Adamant nature. Icicle Crash is a great option instead, as it doesn't require an item to function well; however, it has a decreased Base Power. Earthquake is a great coverage move, allowing Baxcalibur to threaten Skeledirge, Kingambit, and Gholdengo.</p> <p>Baxcalibur is capable of switching into Will-O-Wisps from the likes of Sableye and Skeledirge with its ability Thermal Exchange, keeping other physical attackers like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Roaring Moon safe. Cyclizar is an exceptional teammate, as it uses Shed Tail to keep Baxcalibur safe from status ailments induced by Toxapex and Grimmsnarl as it sets up with Dragon Dance. Furthermore, Cyclizar removes entry hazards such as Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Dragapult is capable of outpacing threats like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and opposing Baxcalibur as well as pressuring Dondozo with Thunderbolt. Garchomp eases Baxcalibur's sweeping by setting entry hazards and phazing opposing Pokemon through Dragon Tail to rack up damage. Dragalge sets up Toxic Spikes and checks Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant thanks to its Fairy-type neutrality along with STAB Gunk Shot. Hydreigon threatens physical walls like Slowbro, Dondozo, and Toxapex by disabling their recovery options with Taunt and setting up on them using Nasty Plot. Walking Wake is a great faster teammate that relieves pressure off of Baxcalibur to check Chien-Pao.</p> "

However, it struggles to break through Unaware walls, such as Quagsire and Dondozo, and Pokemon that resist its STAB Combination and threaten it, such as Scizor and Azumarill. Thermal Exchange lets it switch into and punish Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-W and Sableye and Fire-type moves from Ceruledge and Fire Spin Skuntank. Glaive Rush hits Rotom-W, Toxapex, Volcarona and Quaquaval, while Ice-type STAB moves let it threaten Meowscarada, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Earthquake is a great option to hit Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Kingambit super effectively, while Ice Shard lets it pick off weakened Pokemon and Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada, Flamigo, and Dragapult. An Adamant nature maximizes Baxcalibur's power while outspeeding Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao at +1; however, a Jolly nature outspeeds Gholdengo and Quaquaval and Speed ties Choice Scarf Great Tusk at +1.</p> <p>Baxcalibur appreciates teammates that can provide it with setup opportunities. Froslass can set Spikes and stop opposing hazards with Taunt, spread burns, and use Destiny Bond to KO opposing threats to Baxcalibur. Abomasnow provides Baxcalibur with snow's defense boost and Aurora Veil to help it set up while also checking Dondozo and Quagsire. Swords Dance Chien-Pao can break Skeledirge, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit and can pick off Pokemon that Baxcalibur has weakened with Ice Shard or Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Chien-Pao can effectively clean up the battle once Baxcalibur has dealt significant damage. Avalugg and Cloyster can both remove hazards for Baxcalibur in case its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed. Cloyster can also clean up after Baxcalibur with Shell Smash, while Avalugg can beat Kingambit, Iron Treads, and more with Iron Defense + Body Press if Baxcalibur forgoes Earthquake. Cryogonal's combination of Freeze-Dry and Rapid Spin can help Baxcalibur deal with Quagsire while also removing entry hazards that Ice-type teams often struggle with.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Baxcalibur serves as a fearsome wallbreaker and late-game cleaner, as it swiftly dispatches even the bulkiest walls, such as Corviknight, Iron Hands, and Toxapex. Additionally, Swords Dance grants it the ability to eliminate would-be checks to Dragon Dance sets, like Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos and Flutter Mane, with these being OHKOed by a +2 Ice Shard. At +2, Icicle Crash OHKOes specially defensive Ting-Lu and 2HKOes Corviknight, preventing these walls from phazing or heavily damaging Baxcalibur. Alternatively, Icicle Spear in combination with Loaded Dice enables Baxcalibur to outright OHKO Corviknight and physically defensive Great Tusk at +2. It can also break through Quagsire if it manages to land five hits. However, Dragon teams do not have consistent entry hazard removal, making Loaded Dice a bit unreliable. If Icicle Crash is used, Glaive Rush becomes much more important, since it has a chance to 2HKO Quagsire if using an Adamant nature. This move also enables Baxcalibur to indiscriminately break down bulkier teams like Poison and Water. Ice Shard allows Baxcalibur to clean up types such as Dragon, Ground, and Flying after dealing with bulky Pokemon like Walking Wake, Great Tusk, and Corviknight. A Jolly nature allows Baxcalibur to outpace threats like Glimmora and Gholdengo. This makes Earthquake a better choice, since it OHKOes both at +2 while retaining its ability to threaten Poison and Steel teams. However, this comes at the cost of being unable to break Quagsire.</p> <p>Cyclizar is one of the best teammates for Baxcalibur due to its ability to remove entry hazards, remove items from bulky walls like Quagsire and Toxapex, and pass a Substitute to Baxcalibur with Shed Tail. Garchomp provides entry hazard support and can shuffle opposing teams with Dragon Tail. It also pressures Steel-types like Gholdengo immensely, which is appreciated especially if Baxcalibur lacks Earthquake. Choice Specs Dragapult deals with Flutter Mane, Quagsire, and Gholdengo, pivots Baxcalibur into special walls like Clodsire and Alolan Muk, and spreads status on unsuspecting threats like Kingambit, Quagsire, and Corviknight, making them easier to deal with. Hisuian Goodra checks Fairy-types like Hatterene, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, and Flutter Mane. In return, Baxcalibur deals with Enamorus, Breloom, and Landorus, which all pose a threat to Hisuian Goodra. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Iron Defense Hisuian Goodra work in tandem with Baxcalibur, as they wear down each other's checks to eventually win the Water, Fighting, Steel, and Fairy matchups. Hisuian Goodra and Dragonite also appreciates Baxcalibur's ability to swap into predicted Will-O-Wisps from Sableye. Choice Scarf users like Walking Wake and Roaring Moon are also appreciated, as Walking Wake deals with fast threats like Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Chien-Pao, while Roaring Moon takes care of Iron Valiant and Dragapult.</p> "

Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Kingambit, and Gholdengo, while also hitting defensive staples such as Skeledirge, Garganacl, and Toxapex. Thermal Exchange lets Baxcalibur avoid Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Skeledirge, and it dissuades the use of moves such as Volcarona's Flamethrower and Heatran's Magma Storm, as well as coverage from Choice-locked Pokemon like Dragapult. Tera Steel lets Baxcalibur avoid Toxic while also denying Choice Scarf Tapu Lele from revenge killing it and allowing setup in front of Choice Specs Dragapult. Tera Dragon powers up Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush to lethal levels, while Earthquake boosted by Tera Ground lets Baxcalibur OHKO the aforementioned Kingambit, Garganacl, and more often that not Toxapex at +1, avoiding Iron Head, Salt Cure, and Haze, respectively. Baxcalibur functions well on offensive teams that provide dual screens support, letting it set up freely in front of Pokemon like Rotom-W and Slowbro. Baxcalibur's ability to rip holes in Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Toxapex-reliant cores greatly benefits teammates like Tapu Lele, Weavile, and Urshifu-R, which can quickly snowball late-game.

Gholdengo in particular checks Iron Valiant, which revenge kills Baxcalibur with Quark Drive. Landorus-T pivots out on Pokemon such as Rotom-W, giving Baxcalibur an opportunity to setup while also checking threatening Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny. Baxcalibur appreciates entry hazard removal for Loaded Dice sets to maximize its solid natural bulk, so teammates such as Great Tusk, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W are appreciated.

By running its two strongest STAB moves along with Nasty Plot and Recover, Gholdengo takes advantage of both its offensive and defensive capabilities. Covert Cloak is most useful to block the residual damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure, while Heavy-Duty Boots negates the chip damage Gholdengo would take from switching into Spikes and Stealth Rock. Tera Fighting is the best choice defensively, removing the threat of a super effective hit from Dragapult or opposing Gholdengo's Shadow Ball, resisting Dark-type moves from Kingambit, Hydreigon, and Roaring Moon, and lessening the chip damage from Salt Cure if running Heavy-Duty Boots.

It benefits from entry hazards significantly to help chip down opposing Pokemon, making entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu great teammates; in return, Gholdengo is able to keep their entry hazards up by blocking Defog with Good as Gold. In addition, Pokemon like offensive Great Tusk, Iron Moth, and Dragonite appreciate entry hazards staying up, and they'll return the favor by checking other threats, like Great Tusk checking Kingambit. Physical attackers like Choice Band Dragapult, Cinderace, and Roaring Moon help cover Gholdengo's weakness to specially defensive Pokemon like Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire. Ting-Lu in particular can be tough to break through; having a dedicated check like Choice Band Zamazenta is helpful. Gholdengo can cover for some of their weaknesses as well, breaking through walls like Toxapex and Garganacl and switching into status from Rotom-W. Faster Pokemon, such as Cinderace and Dragapult, as well as revenge killers like Kingambit prevent Gholdengo from setting up and can quickly KO it; having defensive teammates like Clodsire, Dondozo, and Garganacl to take some of the heat off is extremely useful.

Gholdengo can effectively hit offensive threats such as Dragapult and Iron Valiant with its STAB moves. Trick allows Gholdengo to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Dondozo, Corviknight, and Clodsire. Its typing also allows it to switch into foes such as Iron Valiant and Iron Hands in a pinch, as it either resists or is immune to most of their attacks. Focus Blast is ideal for Gholdengo to hit Kingambit and other foes such as a weakened Ting-Lu, but Nasty Plot can be run instead to take advantage of stopping defensive Pokemon with Trick and having a free turn to set up and do a great amount of damage. Recover can also be run, taking a more defensive approach to give Gholdengo a free turn to heal. Gholdengo prefers Fighting as a Tera type, as it removes its prior weaknesses, meaning it is not threatened by Kingambit's Sucker Punch or Skeledirge's Torch Song. It also boosts the power of Focus Blast, reliably removing the former. To counter different foes, Gholdengo can instead opt for Tera Flying to have better ground against Great Tusk and Iron Treads.</p> <p>Teammates such as Kingambit and Iron Valiant appreciate Gholdengo's offensive pressure, as it can help against shared checks such as Great Tusk and Amoonguss. With this role, Gholdengo prefers to have a clean switch after a teammate has fainted in order to pressure the opponent. Similarly, entry hazard setters such as Garchomp, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu appreciate Gholdengo for its Good as Gold ability and its Ghost typing, preventing all forms of hazard removal excluding Court Change. Gholdengo is mainly vulnerable to priority moves such as Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Dragonite also presents an issue for it with Multiscale in conjunction with Earthquake, not to mention it can set up twice in front of Gholdengo. This can be avoided with a carefully timed Trick or help from defensive Great Tusk and Skeledirge. Similarly, depending on its Choice lock, Roaring Moon and Cinderace can take advantage of Gholdengo with Crunch and Sucker Punch, respectively. As a result of this, Garchomp and Garganacl pair well with Gholdengo, acting as a defensive backbone with type advantage and great bulk.

Make It Rain is Gholdengo's strongest viable attack, OHKOing Pokemon like Garganacl, Hisuian Zoroark, Great Tusk, and Scream Tail. Shadow Ball offers great coverage, hitting foes that resist Make It Rain such as Toxapex, Corviknight, Rotom-W, Slowking, Skeledirge, and opposing Gholdengo. Focus Blast offers crucial coverage against Kingambit, which resists both of Gholdengo's STAB moves. Recover, on the other hand, can keep Gholdengo healthy throughout the game, and it can be freely used once Gholdengo lands Trick and loses its Choice Specs. Trick allows Gholdengo to cripple special walls like Clodsire with a Choice lock, consequently making them much easier to wear down or pivot around throughout the game. A Timid nature lets Gholdengo outspeed Dragonite and, at worst, Speed tie with opposing Gholdengo. Tera Fighting has excellent synergy with Gholdengo's Ghost typing, turning its weakness to Dark-type attacks like Kingambit's Sucker Punch into a resistance, and the STAB boost to Focus Blast greatly helps in dealing with Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon, which can otherwise check Gholdengo if they remain healthy. Tera Steel is a valid alternative that dramatically powers up Make it Rain—which becomes so ludicrously strong, it even 2HKOes Clodsire—while preserving the Steel type's great defensive profile. Also, keeping Steel while removing Gholdengo's Ghost and Dark weaknesses can prove useful against Dragapult, Meowscarada, and opposing Gholdengo.</p> <p>Choice Specs Gholdengo's immediate power and valuable defensive utility give it a solid place on an array of bulkier offensive teams, punching holes for an array of sweepers later in the game, and these teams' stronger defensive backbones give Gholdengo more opportunities to come in and hit hard. Ting-Lu can sponge Ghost- and Dark-type attacks, like Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave and Shadow Ball from Dragapult, Hisuian Zoroark, and opposing Gholdengo. It can also force progress with entry hazard damage alongside Whirlwind, giving Gholdengo an easier time breaking past teams' defensive cores. In return, Gholdengo can block Rapid Spin and Defog to ensure that Ting-Lu's entry hazards remain active, and it handles threats like Breloom and Iron Valiant, which Ting-Lu struggles against. Other hazard setters like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Glimmora similarly appreciate Gholdengo's blocking of all forms of hazard removal. Roaring Moon also has great synergy with Gholdengo, which can deal with attacks like Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Close Combat, Hatterene's Dazzling Gleam, and Great Tusk's Close Combat and Ice Spinner, while Roaring Moon can handle Fire-type attacks from Iron Moth. Choice Specs Gholdengo's high immediate power puts a great deal of pressure on physically bulky foes like Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Dondozo, which can open up opportunities for Roaring Moon to sweep unimpaired. Swords Dance Iron Valiant can handle Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Dragapult for Gholdengo, while Gholdengo can wear down or eliminate Unaware Skeledirge and Dondozo to let Iron Valiant sweep. Faster Ghost-types like Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark pair well with Gholdengo, as they can wear down and eventually overwhelm their shared checks, like Ting-Lu and Assault Vest Azumarill, with their solid coverage. Hisuian Zoroark in particular is an excellent teammate: it shares Gholdengo's access to Shadow Ball, Focus Blast, and Nasty Plot to bluff numerous Gholdengo sets with Illusion, provides a crucial Ghost immunity to deter opposing Ghost-type attacks, and has a much better Speed stat to catch opponents off-guard. For facing Dragapult, Hisuian Zoroark is immune to Ghost while Gholdengo resists Dragon, and both can OHKO Dragapult if it incorrectly predicts which Pokemon it's facing.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its great typing and Good as Gold, Gholdengo is a setup sweeper that's notably difficult to deal with. Having an additional Ground immunity with Air Balloon further improves Gholdengo's already great typing, letting it switch in on Pokemon that otherwise threaten it, such as Garchomp and Iron Treads. This is especially useful against the latter, as Air Balloon strengthens Gholdengo's ability to block entry hazard removal. Maximum Speed investment is for outspeeding Dragonite and uninvested Great Tusk. 252 Special Attack EVs and Nasty Plot makes Gholdengo's STAB moves very threatening against neutral foes. Fighting and Dark Tera types give Gholdengo the option to Terastallize defensively; notably, Tera Fighting lessens the impact of moves like Crunch from Roaring Moon. Tera Dark is useful in a pinch to resist attacks such as Shadow Ball from Dragapult and opposing Gholdengo.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Glimmora are the most profitable teammates for Gholdengo, as its ability and typing ensure that their entry hazards stay around as long as Gholdengo does. Hyper offense staples such as Iron Valiant benefit greatly from the constant presence of entry hazards to break down bulkier cores; in return, Gholdengo gets teammates that synergize with its role as a wallbreaker, applying heavy pressure throughout a game to Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Rotom-W. Offensive Pokemon that outspeed and OHKO Gholdengo, such as Cinderace, Roaring Moon, and Knock Off variants of Great Tusk, threaten to completely shut down Gholdengo; defensive teammates like Garganacl, Dondozo and Skeledirge can help mitigate some of these weaknesses.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Gholdengo can utilize its natural bulk, great typing, and immunity to status moves for a more defensive role on balance and stall teams. It can switch into several key offensive threats such as Iron Valiant, Scizor and Breloom and completely shut down multiple defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Corviknight. With Good as Gold, Gholdengo can act as a reliable means of spinblocking and denying Defog. Recover provides Gholdengo with a means of improving its longevity, letting it switch into the aforementioned threats multiple times throughout a match. Thunder Wave allows Gholdengo to cripple threats it can lure in, like Iron Moth and Roaring Moon. Gholdengo can capitalize on the status it spreads with Hex, letting it deal high damage once its targets have been paralyzed. Gholdengo can take advantage of switches it forces by setting up Nasty Plot, letting it exert a high offensive threat level, and enabling it to win potential stalemates against bulkier Pokemon such as Corviknight and Dondozo. Alternatively, Make It Rain can be used to immediately KO Garganacl and Iron Valiant. Tera Flying improves Gholdengo's matchups against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Iron Treads. This completely flips the matchup in Gholdengo's favor, as it can use them as a point of entry to set up Nasty Plot. Tera Fairy, on the other hand, grants Gholdengo a resistance to Dark-type attacks, allowing it to survive Crunch from Roaring Moon and paralyze it with Thunder Wave. Gholdengo's item choice is quite flexible and largely depends on its team structure. Leftovers offers passive recovery, which is quite valuable to preserve Recover PP. Covert Cloak grants Gholdengo an immunity to the secondary effects of various moves, allowing it to counter Garganacl by nullifying the chip damage from Salt Cure. It is also useful to allow Gholdengo to switch into a wider pool of moves, like Hatterene's Nuzzle, with far less risk. Heavy-Duty Boots nullifies entry hazard damage, allowing Gholdengo to switch in and out with little issue. A physically defensive EV spread allows Gholdengo to more reliably check Pokemon such as Garganacl, Corviknight, and Scizor.</p> <p>Defensive Gholdengo fits on a variety of teams, but it particularly shines on balance and stall teams. Its ability to nullify most forms of hazard control is most useful to entry hazard setters such as Garchomp, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. These Pokemon also appreciate Gholdengo's ability to check Hatterene, which can bounce back hazards with Magic Bounce. If Gholdengo is utilizing Covert Cloak, it will be a great teammate to Pokemon like Dondozo, Toxapex, and Corviknight, which struggle against Garganacl due to Salt Cure. Gholdengo can pivot into many key status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and is therefore a great ally to Pokemon that are common targets of them, such as Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Meowscarada. When not running Tera Flying, Ground-types like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire can use Gholdengo as an entry point to either deal high damage to it with Earthquake or set up entry hazards. Corviknight is thus a great partner, as it can switch into them with ease and clear entry hazards they may set up with Defog. Hatterene is another good teammate, since it can completely shut down attempts to set up entry hazards with Magic Bounce. Gholdengo is also quite vulnerable to a few other offensive threats, such as Cinderace and Kingambit, so bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Toxpaex can switch into these Pokemon and prevent setup via Unaware and Haze, respectively, which Gholdengo will greatly appreciate. Garchomp and Great Tusk can switch into Cinderace and Kingambit and threaten them out with Earthquake, and they can also benefit from Gholdengo's Thunder Wave support, allowing them to more reliably check Cinderace and Iron Moth.</p> "

Focus Blast hits Dark-types that resist Shadow Ball like Kingambit and Ting-Lu. A single Nasty Plot boost enables Gholdengo's Focus Blast to OHKO physically defensive Ting-Lu after a layer of Spikes.

Substitute can be used instead to give Gholdengo some security against faster threats that can take it out such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Recover is also another option to keep Gholdengo healthy, since it can be worn down fairly easily.

Scizor appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take care of physical walls, allowing it to clean up with STAB Bullet Punch. Scizor can also pivot into Gholdengo on physical walls such as Skeledirge, allowing Gholdengo to threaten the opposing Pokemon easier.

Gholdengo's typing and unique ability in Good as Gold make it the premier stopgap to entry hazard removal and a good asset for entry hazard-stacking teams. Gholdengo can switch in on Defoggers like Rotom-W and Tornadus-T—the tier's top Defogger—and can switch in on status moves like Leech Seed from Ferrothorn and Toxic from Clodsire after Gholdengo Terastallizes. A STAB combination of Ghost / Steel hits many targets neutrally, with Shadow Ball being incredibly spammable and Make It Rain hitting Ghost-resistant Pokemon like Garganacl, Tyranitar, and Weavile; the former two are otherwise able to switch in freely. Tera Ghost allows Gholdengo to maintain its spinblocking abilities while strengthening Shadow Ball against foes like Toxapex and improving its matchup into Garganacl. Tera Fairy lets Gholdengo switch out of otherwise crippling Pursuit. Tera Water lets it stay in on four attacks Kingambit and begin setting up, but still leaves it vulnerable to Garganacl and taken advatange of by Rotom-W. The removal of a Ground weakness also allows it to take advantage of Heatran, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire. 128 Special Defense EVs let Gholdengo survive two Heat Waves from offensive Tornadus-T from maximum HP, while the Special Attack allows it to OHKO bulky Tornadus-T with Make It Rain after a Nasty Plot; the remaining are put in Defense to take hits from the likes of Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar much better after Terastallizing. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, Gastrodon, and Mega Diancie appreciate their hazards staying up for as long as possible. Pokemon like Mega Lopunny appreciate Gholdengo beating common revenge killers in Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Zamazenta. Rotom-W is notable in that it checks Pokemon like Mega Swampert, Heatran, and Victini, and it appreciates Gholdengo providing entry hazard control. Gholdengo struggles against Kingambit, which it lets in for free and struggles to switch out of due to Pursuit. Kingambit is punished by Fighting-type teammates such as Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Mega Lopunny. Gholdengo also struggles against Mega Lopunny, which can switch in on stray Shadow Balls and bypass its Fighting immunity with Scrappy. Gholdengo also struggles against Clodsire and opposing Ghost-types, such as Dragapult and opposing Gholdengo. These can be checked by Pursuit users such as Weavile, Kingambit, and Mega Tyranitar.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Wo-Chien is a stalwart defensive option that checks offensive threats such as Sandy Shocks and Polteageist, and it takes advantage of some defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Knock Off is crucial to hinder the longevity of checks such as Talonflame and Salamence. Leech Seed and Protect are useful to quickly rack up residual damage against foes such as Tinkaton, and Protect scouts Choice-locked Pokemon like Iron Jugulis. The fourth moveslot is variable; Ruination is the most consistent option to quickly drop the health of enemies such as Salamence, forcing them to spend PP to recover health. Giga Drain helps Wo-Chien immediately pressure Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Tyranitar while providing more recovery. With Substitute, Wo-Chien has plenty of opportunities to set it up against Pokemon like Slowking and Brambleghast. It forces offensive checks such as Pawmot and Gallade to break the Substitute, giving Wo-Chien more opportunities to drain their health with Leech Seed + Protect. Foul Play is also an option in that moveslot for teams that struggle against Dragon Dance Gyarados or Tyranitar, though it requires Defense investment on Wo-Chien to be reliable, especially against a Tyranitar that hasn't Terastallized. Leftovers keeps Wo-Chien intact in longer games and helps mitigate its lack of reliable recovery. Maximum Special Defense investment is necessary to check threats like Tatsugiri and survive attacks from foes like Gengar and Noivern, punishing them with Knock Off. Tera Poison is common to block Quagsire's Toxic and counter Gengar, but Wo-Chien does become weak to Sandy Shocks's Earth Power. Tera Ghost lets Wo-Chien surprise foes like Toxtricity and Slither Wing, becoming resistant to their powerful attacks, and spinblock Tatsugiri and Brambleghast. However, it does become weak to threats like Choice Band Tyranitar and Polteageist. Tera Fairy patches Wo-Chien's weakness to Iron Jugulis and retains Poison's resistance to Fighting, but it lacks any other meaningful application.</p> <p>Wo-Chien fits primarily on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams, which take advantage of it making progress with Knock Off and reliably wearing down foes such as Noivern and Tinkaton. Entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Tinkaton work to increase Wo-Chien's passive damage. They also check foes like Pawmot, Gengar, and Noivern. Toxic Spikes Gengar is also effective to leave offensive teams less room to overwhelm Wo-Chien, as it puts Pokemon like Lokix and Mimikyu on a timer, especially in conjunction with Leech Seed. Gengar also heavily appreciates Wo-Chien taking advantage of Hippowdon and Tyranitar. Talonflame is a crucial partner to Wo-Chien, as it revenge kills many of its common threats like Slither Wing, Paldean Tauros-B, and Scizor. Grafaiai is a solid check to Gengar that appreciates Wo-Chien reliably wearing down Tinkaton. Grafaiai can also mess with the offensive teams that Wo-Chien can struggle against, locking down setup threats like Salamence with Encore and lowering their threat potential with Parting Shot. It further pivots Wo-Chien into Quagsire, making sure it doesn't risk taking Toxic on the switch. Scream Tail is effective at checking foes like Pawmot and Iron Jugulis while providing Wish support. Scream Tail also appreciates Leech Seed support replenishing its health, making it better at switching into them repeatedly.</p> "

Knock Off punishes Pokemon that rely on their items such as Talonflame, Iron Jugulis, and Tinkaton, while Foul Play lets Wo-Chien beat foes like Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Gyarados and threaten Scizor and Cyclizar. Ruination is an alternative option if Tyranitar and Gyarados are adequately covered by its teammates, allowing it to punish Pokemon like Tinkaton far more for trying to switch into it. Rest lets Wo-Chien check foes like Sandy Shocks and Greninja long-term. Heavy-Duty Boots helps it avoid being worn down by entry hazards from Pokemon like Gastrodon and Sandy Shocks when trying to check foes like Greninja and Tyranitar. Leftovers is an option if a team has reliable entry hazard removal, as it lets Wo-Chien take on Pokemon such as Tyranitar more reliably one-on-one. The Defense investment lets Wo-Chien avoid a 2HKO from +1 Tyranitar and lowers the damage from U-turn users like Cyclizar and Greninja while still retaining a solid amount of Special Defense for Sandy Shocks and Greninja. Tera Ghost allows Wo-Chien to spinblock against Donphan and Cyclizar while improving its matchup against foes like Maushold and Slither Wing, but it must be careful of Crunch Tyranitar and losing its ability to check Greninja. Tera Poison lets Wo-Chien become a very reliable Gengar counter, but it loses the ability to check Sandy Shocks and Tyranitar.</p> <p>RestTalk Wo-Chien fits on a variety of teams, and is best used to play a long game against Pokemon such as Sandy Shocks. Talonflame is valuable to check foes like Scizor and Slither Wing for Wo-Chien and appreciates its ability to check Sandy Shocks and Tyranitar in return. Slowbro can provide a strong Quaquaval answer and assistance versus Dragon Dance Tyranitar, letting Wo-Chien Terastallize more freely. Scream Tail can help check Salamence and Noivern while also checking Quaquaval, and it appreciates Wo-Chien crippling checks like Tinkaton with Knock Off. Entry hazard setters, such as Sandy Shocks and Gastrodon, can help Wo-Chien better wear down its switch-ins, and they appreciate Wo-Chien's ability to potentially spinblock. Hippowdon and Salamence can help check Pawmot for Wo-Chien, as Wo-Chien provides it with relatively free switch-ins. Other Pawmot checks, such as Tera Fairy Alomomola and Tera Fairy Slowbro, are also appreciated. Entry hazard removers, such as Cyclizar and the aforementioned Talonflame, are useful even if Wo-Chien is running Heavy-Duty Boots, as they let it more freely take a Knock Off from Cyclizar or Tinkaton.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Chien-Pao is one of the most formidable wallbreakers in AG thanks to its incredible Speed tier, outpacing almost the entire metagame, and massive firepower. Icicle Crash is the preferred Ice-type STAB move due to its higher power, flinch chance to potentially beat walls like Corviknight and Garganacl, and avoidance of adverse contact effects like Baneful Bunker and Rocky Helmet; however, Ice Spinner is more consistent and can also remove Electric Terrain. Ice Shard gives Chien-Pao a powerful way to revenge kill opposing offensive threats, notably threatening Flutter Mane, Koraidon, Miraidon, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk. Sucker Punch is also an option, as it hits Choice Scarf Chi-Yu and Iron Bundle much harder while still threatening Flutter Mane and Miraidon. In the last slot, Sacred Sword hits Garganacl and OHKOes Kingambit and Chi-Yu, which would otherwise switch in fairly safely and force Chien-Pao out. Alternatively, running Ice Shard and Sucker Punch together is also an option, allowing Chien-Pao to pressure both Iron Bundle and Koraidon effectively while also ensuring that it beats other Chien-Pao consistently. An Adamant nature is preferable as it guarantees a 2HKO on Toxapex after Stealth Rock with Crunch while also getting favorable rolls against Corviknight and Ting-Lu, although Jolly is also viable in order to speed tie with unboosted Miraidon, Koraidon, and Flutter Mane. Chien-Pao's best Tera type is Dark, which drastically boosts Crunch, making it much easier for it to break through Alomomola, Corviknight, and Toxapex while guaranteeing an OHKO on Iron Bundle with Sucker Punch. Tera Ice is also viable, notably netting an OHKO against Miraidon and a good chance to OHKO Koraidon with Ice Shard. Chien-Pao fits well on all manner of balance teams, pairing extremely well with Miraidon thanks to their ability to effectively pressure each other's checks, with Chien-Pao threatening Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads while Miraidon threatens Corviknight, Alomomola, and Toxapex. Gothitelle is also a great teammate that can trap and remove Chien-Pao's checks, notably beating Toxapex and Alomomola. Due to its frailty and its tendency to be forced out after locking into a move, Chien-Pao needs a sturdy defensive backbone to support it, so balance staples like Corviknight, Ting-Lu, Toxapex, and Skeledirge can all be good teammates for their ability to handle Pokemon like Koraidon, Great Tusk, and Miraidon which might attempt to take advantage of Chien-Pao.</p> "

Swords Dance allows Chien-Pao to break through walls such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Corviknight. Ice Spinner can be considered over Icicle Crash due to its perfect accuracy, but it is a slightly weaker contact move that cannot flinch. Sucker Punch is the preferred priority move option, allowing it to OHKO Flutter Mane without a boost, as well as Iron Bundle and Miraidon after a Swords Dance. Alternatively, Ice Shard OHKOes Koraidon, Miraidon, and Flutter Mane at +2 Attack after Stealth Rock. Heavy-Duty Boots is the best item on this set, but Life Orb and Focus Sash are solid picks on hyper offense builds and other teams with good entry hazard control. Life Orb lets Chien-Pao get some crucial OHKOs at +2 Attack, notably against Miraidon and Koraidon with Ice Shard and Corviknight and Toxapex with Crunch. Tera Dark makes its Dark-type moves stronger while shedding the weaknesses from its Ice typing, notably reducing Stealth Rock damage and weakening Iron Head and Body Press from Corviknight as well as Torch Song from Skeledirge. Chien-Pao fits best on offensive teams and flourishes with other wallbreakers like Miraidon, Koraidon, Iron Bundle, and offensive Great Tusk. On bulkier builds, teammates like defensive Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads set entry hazards while checking fast Pokemon like Koraidon and Miraidon. If forgoing Heavy-Duty Boots, it is essential to pair Chien-Pao with lead entry hazard setters like Glimmora and Froslass on offensive teams and Iron Treads and Great Tusk on bulkier teams, as they additionally prevent opposing entry hazards from going up.</p> "

With Swords Dance, it can boost up to beat even the likes of Corviknight and Toxapex if it has Crunch. Fighting-type coverage picks off Dark-types like Kingambit and Greninja.

Ice Shard stops common revenge killers like Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Flutter Mane, and Great Tusk.</p> <p>As Chien-Pao focuses on breaking down foes with its sheer power and Speed, it appreciates support from its teammates. Ting-Lu can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, while Skuntank can set up Toxic Spikes and pressure Fairy-types, all of which make wallbreaking for Chien-Pao easier. Grimmsnarl provides Chien-Pao with dual screens support, making setting up easier. Sableye can burn opposing Pokemon and cripple them with Taunt and Knock Off, removing Heavy-Duty Boots and making foes susceptible to entry hazards, while also acting as a Fighting-type move switch-in. Choice Specs Greninja can clean up after Chien-Pao has done enough damage while also countering Fire-types that would annoy Chien-Pao such as Skeledirge and Cinderace if Chien-Pao does not have Crunch. Hydreigon can break Steel-types for Chien-Pao if it forgoes Fighting-type coverage or Swords Dance, beating Fighting-neutral Steel-types like Corviknight and Scizor. Choice Scarf Meowscarada is able to threaten Pokemon that counter Chien-Pao such as Quaquaval and Choice Scarf users such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Great Tusk while also being able to pivot to Chien-Pao with U-turn.</p> "

Icicle Crash is preferred over Ice Spinner for its flinch chance and higher Base Power, the latter of which—among other things—allows it to always 2HKO Sableye and bulky Great Tusk, while Ice Spinner may miss out on these 2HKOs. Crunch allows Chien-Pao to hit Skeledirge and Gholdengo—two problematic Pokemon for Ice teams. Sacred Sword and Brick Break both allow Chien-Pao to threaten Dark-, Steel-, and Ice-types such as Kingambit and opposing Chien-Pao. Sacred Sword is stronger and comes with the ability to ignore Defense boosts, while Brick Break removes Reflect and Light Screen, which is extremely helpful against teams with support from Grimmsnarl or Klefki. Psychic Fangs is an alternative option to Sacred Sword or Brick Break to hit Toxapex and Fighting-types such as Paldean Tauros-F. Sucker Punch is significantly stronger than Ice Shard and allows Chien-Pao to hit Pokemon like Gholdengo, Scizor, and Flutter Mane.</p> <p>This set very much appreciates Aurora Veil support from Abomasnow, as it allows Chien-Pao to set up on many Pokemon that would otherwise threaten it out as well as allowing it to survive revenge killing attempts from the likes of Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Extreme Speed Dragonite. Spikes support from Froslass is also greatly appreciated, as they wear down Pokemon that may otherwise be difficult for Chien-Pao to break, such as Dondozo and Klefki. Although Chien-Pao is able to fit on practically any team, it pairs especially well with other powerful sweepers such as Baxcalibur and Cloyster, weakening or even KOing their checks such as Air Balloon Gholdengo and Skeledirge. Baxcalibur in particular can take on Pokemon such as Toxapex and Paldean Tauros-F with a powerful Earthquake, allowing Chien-Pao to KO them and sweep the opposing team; furthermore, Choice Band Baxcalibur pressures Chien-Pao answers such as Quagsire and Corviknight. Baxcalibur's Thermal Exchange also allows it to switch into Will-O-Wisp that would cripple Chien-Pao as well as be an emergency switch-in to a Fire-type attack.

Additionally, it is capable of breaking through physically defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Quagsire, both of which tend to be tough matchups for many other Ice staples. Icicle Crash is preferred over Ice Spinner for its flinch chance and slightly higher Base Power, notably being favored to 2HKO Azumarill and OHKO offensive Pelipper, neither of which are feats Ice Spinner is capable of. Sacred Sword and Brick Break provide crucial coverage for Pokemon such as Kingambit and opposing Chien-Pao, and Sucker Punch allows Chien-Pao to KO faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p> <p>This set heavily appreciates Spikes from Froslass to wear down its switch-ins, sometimes allowing it to grab KOs it would otherwise miss out on; for example, Crunch always 2HKOes physically defensive Toxapex with one layer of Spikes, but it is favored to not 2HKO without any Spikes. Rapid Spin support from Avalugg is also appreciated, allowing Chien-Pao more opportunities to enter the field. Since this set focuses on opening holes in teams, setup sweepers are excellent partners for it, as Chien-Pao can dent or remove their checks to allow the sweep to happen much more easily. Shell Smash Cloyster in particular appreciates Chien-Pao's ability to beat Gholdengo and significantly damage other Pokemon such as Corviknight that Cloyster may otherwise struggle to break through. Dragon Dance Baxcalibur appreciates Chien-Pao's ability to 2HKO Quagsire and physically defensive Corviknight, which normally would stop Baxcalibur in its tracks. Finally, Belly Drum Cetitan appreciates Chien-Pao's ability to break Unaware walls such as Skeledirge and Quagsire; in return, Cetitan acts as speed control if snow is in effect, aiding in Chien-Pao's weakness to Choice Scarf users such as Iron Moth.</p> "

Icicle Crash can be used for a slight increase in power, a sizeable flinch chance, and avoiding Rocky Helmet damage, however it comes with a chance to miss and cannot clear Psychic Terrain.

Additionally, not being a contact move allows Chien-Pao to avoid unnecessary chip damage from Rocky Helmet users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sucker Punch vs Crunch</strong>: Sucker Punch offers priority with a strong base power at the cost of necessitating prediction, while Crunch is a more standard attack whose Defense drop can allow Chien-Pao to potentially break through bulky foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Shard</strong>: Ice Shard is a more consistent albeit weaker alternative to Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sacred Sword</strong>: Sacred Sword provides coverage for Pokemon that resist one or both of Chien-Pao’s STAB attacks, like Heatran, Chi-Yu, and other Chien-Pao. Additionally, ignoring defense boosts allows Chien-Pao to deal more consistent damage to foes who boost their Defense.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance: While it can be difficult to fit and very reliant on Focus Sash, Swords Dance boosts Chien-Pao’s Attack to unwallable levels, making it a very potent sweeper.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>0-1 SpA IV</strong>: If using Tera Blast on Jolly Chien-Pao, make sure to to use a SpA IV that's 0-1. This is because if Flutter Mane uses Charm, any SpA IV that's higher will result in Tera Blast becoming a Special Attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Throat Chop: Throat Chop disables the use of sound-based moves from targets like Skeledirge and Sylveon, but these matchups are so uncommon that it generally isn't worth using over Crunch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner: Ice Spinner can be used as a more consistent Ice STAB, however it makes Chien-Pao more vulnerable to Rocky Helmet users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sheer Cold</strong>: While it may seem alluring, Sheer Cold is usually a waste of a slot on Chien-Pao sets like this, as its standard attacks already hit most relevant foes. Even if Chien-Pao fails to KO a foe, it will generally leave it within range for a teammate.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li>With few exceptions, Chien-Pao is about all-out offense. However, its choice of item drastically affects its strategy. Tera Types have been organized by item choice to better clarify how each Tera Type works in that context.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Tera Types for Focus Sash and Life Orb</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Chien-Pao offers power in spades without needing to Terastallize, only needing it on very rare occasions to break past specific walls or dodge priority moves aimed at it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric can be used in tandem with Tera Blast to improve Chien-Pao’s matchup against key threats such as Urshifu-R and Dondozo while also making it immune to paralysis.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost: Tera Ghost doesn’t offer much offensive benefit, but it allows Chien-Pao to dodge Dragonite’s Extreme Speed, which can be particularly useful if using Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass: Tera Grass lets Chien-Pao survive Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes, which otherwise threatens to OHKO through Focus Sash. Combined with Tera Blast, Chien-Pao still threatens big damage into Urshifu-R and Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosts Sucker Punch to extreme power levels while making Crunch exceptionally difficult to switch into without a resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice can allow Chien-Pao to finish foes off with Ice Shard from higher ranges and makes Icicle Crash an even more formidable tool.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Tera Types for Choice Band</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Chien-Pao is already plenty powerful, Choice Band combined with Tera can elevate 2HKOs to OHKOs on some of the bulkiest walls in the meta. For this reason, Tera can be worth using on Choice Band sets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark turns Choice Band Crunch into a devastating wallbreaker move that few can withstand, OHKOing Max HP Annihilape and Scizor if using an Adamant nature. Neutralizing Chien-Pao’s Steel-type weakness also makes it less vulnerable to Scizor’s Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice: Tera Ice gives Choice Band Icicle Crash enough power to challenge even physically defensive Ting-Lu, having approximately a 69% chance to OHKO if using an Adamant nature; be warned, however, that Ting-Lu often Terastallizes in front of Chien-Pao, making this inconsistent. The extra power behind Ice Shard is also a welcome boost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: Tera Fairy combined with Choice Band Tera Blast handily defeats some of Chien-Pao's less common checks, OHKOing standard variants of Annihilape and Assault Vest Iron Hands. It also removes several weaknesses, most notably turning Chien-Pao's 4x Fighting-type weakness into a resistance.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly or Adamant: This offensive spread works with all standard sets. Adamant gives Chien-Pao a significant power boost, but Jolly is important for Speed tying with Flutter Mane and opposing Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 68 Def / 188 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This alternate spread is commonly associated with Choice Band, fully maximizing Attack while still maintaining enough Speed to outrun Timid Iron Moth. When used with an appropriate Tera type, the Defense investment lets Chien-Pao survive Life Orb Mimikyu's Play Rough into Shadow Sneak.</p> </li> </ul> "

It also has a great typing that lets it answer threats such as Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, Iron Moth, and Ceruledge. Whirlwind is incredibly useful for thwarting setup Pokemon like Roaring Moon, Cresselia, and Dragonite. Ruination lets Ting-Lu deal consistent damage to bulky Pokemon like Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Hatterene. Stone Edge allows Ting-Lu to hit Zapdos, Enamorus, and Moltres super effectively, as they can otherwise come in somewhat safely against it and use Roost to heal off any damage from Ruination. Rest is an option on bulkier structures like stall teams to give Ting-Lu much-needed recovery. Tera Poison lets Ting-Lu act as an answer to Iron Valiant while giving it an immunity to poison damage from Clodsire’s Toxic and letting it absorb Toxic Spikes from the likes of Glimmora and Iron Moth. Meanwhile, Tera Fairy is a generally solid defensive typing, letting it more reliably check Pokemon such as Dragapult and Great Tusk. Aside from granting a Fighting immunity, Tera Ghost allows Ting-Lu to spinblock foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads, which is especially important if running both entry hazards. If so, Heavy Slam should be used over Earthquake to threaten Hatterene better, which would otherwise block them due to Magic Bounce, while hitting Enamorus more consistently. Red Card is an alternative over Leftovers on more offensive teams that can forgo the recovery; Ting-Lu's astronomical overall bulk allows it to take a single strong hit in a pinch—even super effective attacks such as from Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Enamorus—and phaze them, preventing its team from being swept by opposing offensive threats.</p> <p>Ting-Lu’s premier defensive profile makes it most proficient on bulky offense and balance teams that can supply enough offensive momentum to make up for Ting-Lu’s relative passivity. Pokemon that can supplement offensive prowess to make up for Ting-Lu's passivity such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant and Kingambit make for excellent partners, as they can assist against threats like opposing Iron Valiant, Dondozo, and Great Tusk. Without Ruination, Ting-Lu is utterly helpless against Corviknight, so Pokemon that can threaten it such as Gholdengo, Zapdos, and Cinderace make for excellent partners. Bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Toxapex appreciate Ting-Lu's immunity to Electric while being quite helpful against Pokemon like Kingambit and Quaquaval in return. Other defensive Pokemon like Garganacl and Corviknight also make for excellent partners, being helpful against Pokemon like Scizor while appreciating Ting-Lu’s ability to check Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult. Additional entry hazard setters such as Hisuian Samurott, Garganacl, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk allow Ting-Lu to fit Ruination or Stone Edge into its moveset more capably, so it is less passive in the face of Ground-immune threats like Corviknight, Zapdos, Moltres, and Air Balloon Gholdengo.</p> "

It setting both Stealth Rock and Spikes while providing an invaluable Electric immunity makes it a balance staple. Ruination can be used over one of the entry hazards to threaten potential switch-ins like Great Tusk, Koraidon, opposing Ting-Lu, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Corviknight, which would otherwise come in freely and force Ting-Lu out. Whirlwind lets Ting-Lu deter setup attempts by Tera Fairy Miraidon or simply force out foes to inflict entry hazard damage. Alternatively, Protect can be used for more Leftovers recovery and scouting attacks, although it must be used carefully to avoid Chien-Pao, Koraidon, and Miraidon getting a free turn to set up. Ghost is the preferred Tera type to block Rapid Spin from Iron Treads and Great Tusk, as well as removing Ting-Lu's weaknesses to Iron Bundle's and Koraidon's STAB moves, which lets it effectively check them. Alternatively, Tera Steel grants immunity to Toxic, makes Ting-Lu a solid check to Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane, and eases the matchup against Double Dance Tera Fairy Miraidon. Ting-Lu is most effectively paired with Pokemon like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Alomomola that can handle physical attackers, notably Koraidon, Chien-Pao, Iron Treads, and Great Tusk, that force it out. Ting-Lu isn't a particularly consistent Miraidon check, notably struggling against Calm Mind and Choice Specs Miraidon sets, so backup checks such as Iron Treads and Clodsire can also be very useful. If Ting-Lu is running Spikes, spinners like Iron Treads and Great Tusk can be tremendously valuable, removing enemy entry hazards while leaving your own Spikes intact. It also greatly appreciates teammates such as Miraidon, Koraidon, Iron Bundle, and Chien-Pao that can pressure opposing hazard removers, and in turn they appreciate Ting-Lu's hazards chipping down their checks. Gholdengo and Annihilape can also be good teammates because they outright block or severely punish hazard removal, respectively.</p> "

Tera Water allows it to take Kyogre's STAB moves while also resisting Koraidon's Flare Blitz. It also lets Ting-Lu check the rare, but otherwise hard to check, Chi-Yu and Walking Wake.

It can also pair well alongside the tier's Defoggers, Giratina-O and Corviknight as it is prone to Spikes chip damage and appreciates avoiding that to better check Miraidon. In a similar vein, Eternatus and Toxapex are good Toxic Spikes absorbers, the former of which can also soft check Kyogre and special Arceus formes.</li> </ul> "

Overheat is its strongest STAB move, which allows it to OHKO the bulkiest Pokemon like Blissey and Ting-Lu especially when boosted by Tera Fire and sun. Dark Pulse lets it pressure Fire-resistant foes like Miraidon, Toxapex, Pelipper, Alomomola, and Garganacl more easily. Fire Blast is a stronger option than Flamethrower that doesn't drop Special Attack, which lets Chi-Yu break through Garganacl and Blissey after minimal chip damage when boosted by sun and Tera Fire. Alternatively, Psychic may be used to deal greater damage to Toxapex and Koraidon. Tera Fire is mandatory to boost Chi-Yu's strength and let it spam its Fire-type moves more freely. Choice Scarf Chi-Yu is unreliable at breaking stall teams, so it is necessary to pair it with wallbreakers that perform this role such as Choice Band Chien-Pao, offensive Great Tusk, Gothitelle, and Swords Dance + Life Orb Koraidon. Koraidon in particular is mandatory to have as a teammate, as it sets sun, which makes up for the power lost by opting for Choice Scarf on Chi-Yu. Additionally, it also creates many opportunities for Chi-Yu to switch in safely thanks to U-turn and Chi-Yu's ability to exploit common Koraidon checks. Defensive partners like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Clodsire, and Toxapex can set and remove entry hazards for Chi-Yu, allowing it to freely switch in multiple times and break teams more easily, and they also check strong revenge killers like Choice Scarf Koraidon, Miraidon, and Quark Drive-boosted Iron Bundle.</p> "

Beads of Ruin and a high Special Attack stat let it consistently force a KO whenever it comes in. Overheat allows Chi-Yu to OHKO or 2HKO even bulky resistant foes, with Flamethrower having perfect accuracy and not dropping Chi-Yu's Special Attack. Dark Pulse allows Chi-Yu to immediately threaten Fire-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Garganacl, 2HKOing or OHKOing them without sun. Fire Blast can reach important damage thresholds, such as 2HKOing Blissey, without the Special Attack drop that accompanies Overheat, with Psychic instead preventing Toxapex from scouting Chi-Yu's move. Tera Fire turns Chi-Yu's 2HKOs against Pokemon like Toxapex and Double Dance Miraidon into OHKOs under sun, and it guarantees 2HKOs on even the bulkiest defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Garganacl, OHKOing them in sun and with minor chip damage. A Modest nature is preferred, but a Timid nature can be considered if Jolly Great Tusk is an issue. Koraidon is an incredible partner, setting sun and bringing Chi-Yu in with U-turn; in exchange, Chi-Yu greatly threatens all of Koraidon's checks. Pivots such as Corviknight and the aforementioned Koraidon are greatly appreciated, as they can let Chi-Yu switch in without worrying about its poor bulk. Entry hazard removal from Great Tusk, Corviknight, or Iron Treads is very helpful due to Chi-Yu's weakness to Stealth Rock and its tendency to switch out after a KO. Chi-Yu is often forced out by faster Pokemon like Miraidon and Koraidon, so defensive switch-ins to them like Clodsire, Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight are good partners.</p> "

Beads of Ruin also not only indirectly makes Chi-Yu hit harder but also empowers its special attacking teammates, with Iron Bundle and Gholdengo in particular being excellent partners due to their ability to either overwhelm shared checks like Ting-Lu or outright beat some of Chi-Yu's checks, such as Garchomp for the former and Glimmora for the latter. Furthermore, Chi-Yu has very good Speed, allowing it to naturally outspeed a considerable portion of the metagame. However, Chi-Yu is not without glaring weaknesses, as its HP and Defense are absurdly low, which leaves it vulnerable to common priority moves such as Palafin's Jet Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. In addition, despite Dark / Fire being a good type combination offensively, it leaves Chi-Yu vulnerable defensively, as its weaknesses to Ground-, Rock- and Water-type moves in addition to Stealth Rock compromise its ability to switch in and fire off more attacks. Finally, Pokemon such as Glimmora, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp have the ability to potentially switch into Chi-Yu and threaten it out, with Ting-Lu's Tablets of Ruin being a particular annoyance due to it offsetting Beads of Ruin. However, it is important to note that Chi-Yu's strength is still to the magnitude that it can 2HKO all the aforementioned Pokemon under the right circumstances.</p> ",

Chi-Yu generally prefers to run Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid entry hazard damage, but Life Orb can be run on Sheer Force sets for extra power. Chi-Yu also has several Fire-type STAB moves to choose from: Fire Blast is the most powerful, Flamethrower is the most consistent option, and Inferno is used on No Guard sets to punish switch-ins like Garganacl and Ting-Lu with a burn. Chi-Yu does struggle against special walls like Clodsire and Blissey, so physically offensive Pokemon like Meowscarada and Kingambit make good teammates. Chi-Yu is also physically frail, so it appreciates teammates like Corviknight and Avalugg that can switch into strong physical attacks and Wish passers like Florges and Scream Tail that can help it stay healthy.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Roaring Moon is one of the tier's most threatening late-game setup sweepers due to its high offensive stats, strong coverage moves, and decent bulk. Earthquake is a strong, consistent coverage option that hits Kingambit, Garganacl, Iron Hands, and Clodsire super effectively. Roost, on the other hand, gives Roaring Moon access to reliable recovery, which gives it more setup opportunities throughout the game even if its Booster Energy is already used up. Acrobatics has fantastic coverage, as it hits Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Breloom super effectively and should always be run alongside Tera Flying to maximize its power. Since Acrobatics + Earthquake hits most of the metagame at least neutrally, Crunch can be dropped in favor of Taunt to shut down common defensive foes, most notably Corviknight and Rotom-W that would otherwise resist the aforementioned move combination. However, this makes Roaring Moon very reliant on Terastallization due to the lack of reliable STAB moves. Iron Head is a viable alternative to Acrobatics and should always be run alongside Tera Steel, as it deals with Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Hatterene simultaneously. Tera Flying removes all of Roaring Moon's baseline weaknesses bar Ice, gives it a resistance to Fighting- and Bug-type attacks, a Ground immunity, and a STAB boost to Acrobatics. Tera Steel, though more niche, allows Roaring Moon to resist Hatterene's Dazzling Gleam, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Tera Normal Dragonite's Extreme Speed. A Jolly nature is typically run to outspeed Booster Energy Iron Valiant after a Dragon Dance, but Adamant is a decent alternative, particularly on teams that allow Roaring Moon to obtain more than one Dragon Dance boost. After a Dragon Dance, Adamant Roaring Moon can more easily OHKO defensive variants of Gholdengo and Great Tusk.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Roaring Moon best functions on offensive teams, pairing well with setup sweepers that can wear down each other's checks. Iron Valiant can opt out of running Psyshock, since Roaring Moon breaks past Clodsire for it, and Breloom can more effectively utilize its STAB moves and Spore once Roaring Moon eliminates Gholdengo. Dondozo and Tera Fairy Skeledirge are major threats to Roaring Moon due to their ability to ignore its boosts with Unaware, while strong priority users like Dragonite and Breloom can revenge kill Roaring Moon thanks to its low Defense. Ting-Lu can force Roaring Moon out with Whirlwind, and Choice Band Iron Hands survives a boosted Earthquake from full health and can OHKO Roaring Moon with Close Combat. Iron Valiant offers immediate damage against Dondozo, Iron Hands, and Ting-Lu due to its excellent mixed coverage. Offensive Great Tusk and Technician Breloom can help wear down Ting-Lu with their super effective STAB moves, and Breloom's Technician-boosted Bullet Seed can also break past Dondozo. Grimmsnarl's ability to set up dual screens allows Roaring Moon to set up multiple Dragon Dances and survive attacks from Dragonite.</p> "

U-turn is used to pivot out of checks such as Great Tusk and Corviknight, gaining momentum for the team. Tera Dark allows Roaring Moon to OHKO Clodsire and Volcarona with Crunch.

Garganacl provides Stealth Rock support and can use Salt Cure to chip down Rotom-W and Great Tusk, both of which defensively pose a problem for Roaring Moon, and Amoonguss can provide status support with Spore, forcing switches for Roaring Moon to gain momentum. In turn, Roaring Moon can defeat Gholdengo and Toxapex, which opens up the game for teammates such as Volcarona and Iron Valiant. Volcarona can deal with Corviknight, and Kingambit can weaken Great Tusk when paired with Roaring Moon.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Roaring Moon is an exceptional wallbreaker that deals devastating damage to typical defensive foes, such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Rotom-W, thanks to its newfound access to high-power STAB moves such as Glaive Rush, Dragon Darts, and Knock Off. Moreover, its high Speed along with Sucker Punch allows it to revenge kill boosted setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Choice Scarf users like Gholdengo. Dragon Darts can be run over Glaive Rush to more easily ensure the 2HKO on Great Tusk by committing Tera without fainting to bulkier walls such as Great Tusk due to Glaive Rush's self damage multiplier. Earthquake can be used to inflict more damage against Toxapex and Pokemon that resist both Roaring Moon's STAB types such as Fairy-types like Azumarill. U-turn allows Roaring Moon to both maintain momentum when faced with difficult matchups like Ting-Lu and chip the opponent's Pokemon. Tera Dragon maximizes Glaive Rush and Dragon Darts's damage. Roaring Moon fits best alongside offensive teammates that can help to dismantle defensive cores; examples include Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Gyarados. Due to its lackluster coverage against Fairy-types like Azumarill and common physically defensive Tera Fairy users such as Skeledirge and Toxapex, Roaring Moon needs teammates capable of handling them such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, Clodsire, Toxapex, and Dondozo. As a final note, Roaring Moon heavily benefits from being on sun teams alongside teammates commonly found on them like Torkoal and Scovillain, as its ability, Protosynthesis, lets it gain an Attack boost.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Iron Valiant functions as a special wallbreaker thanks to its speed, power, and coverage moves. Psyshock hits Poison-types like Clodsire, Toxapex, and Amoonguss. Shadow Ball targets Gholdengo and Skeledirge, while Thunderbolt is used to hit Corviknight, as well as doing super effective damage to Toxapex, Tera Flying Gholdengo, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Trick is another option to cripple common switch-ins such as Clodsire, Skeledirge, and Toxapex. Focus Blast threatens an OHKO on Garganacl while greatly damaging Corviknight. However, Aura Sphere is another option that is more consistent thanks to its accuracy, though it misses out on the damage output of Focus Blast. Tera Fairy powers up Moonblast and removes Iron Valiant's weakness to Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks. Alternatively, Tera Ghost makes Iron Valiant immune to Dragonite's Extreme Speed, allows it to OHKO Gholdengo, and increases its damage output against Skeledirge. Tera Electric is a final option to OHKO Toxapex and physically defensive Corviknight and turn its Steel-type weakness into a resistance.</p> <p>Physically offensive Pokemon such as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Cinderace benefit from Iron Valiant, as they struggle against Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Rotom-W, all of which Iron Valiant can pressure effectively. Entry hazard support from partners like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Garchomp provides chip damage against Pokemon that try to play around Iron Valiant such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Pivots such as Rotom-W, Dragapult, Cinderace, and Corviknight give Iron Valiant opportunities to get on the field, reducing the risk of it taking damage. Iron Valiant enjoys the presence of partners that it can rely on to take hits, such as Toxapex, Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, due to its frailty. Keeping the field free from hazards grants Iron Valiant more chances to get on the field and make progress, so teammates with access to Rapid Spin or Defog such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Corviknight are appreciated.</p> "

Its Quark Drive-boosted Speed from Booster Energy turns it into a potent late-game cleaner, letting it outspeed would-be revenge killers like Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, which is further enforced by its unique typing that resists Sucker Punch from Kingambit. However, it can also be used to revenge kill boosted threats like Dragonite in a pinch, especially since Iron Valiant can take on Dragonite's +1 Tera Normal Extreme Speed from full health. Tera Fairy boosts Iron Valiant's Moonblast while still retaining its defensive profile to take on Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Tera Electric amplifies Thunderbolt's damage, notably allowing it to 2HKO would-be checks like Toxapex, specially defensive Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl, and offensive Gholdengo after Stealth Rock, as well as preventing Iron Valiant from being revenge killed by Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> <p>Mixed Iron Valiant is commonly seen on offense and bulky offense teams. Due to the lack of a damage boosting item or setup move, it can still fall short of threatening bulky Pokemon like Amoonguss, and without Shadow Ball or Knock Off, Skeledirge and defensive Gholdengo as well; thus, Pokemon that can deal with them such as Great Tusk, and Kingambit make good teammates. Particularly, the aforementioned Pokemon can overwhelm a shared check in Corviknight and are generally effective as early-game wallbreakers that can open up Iron Valiant to clean up late-game easily. Entry hazards from teammates like Garchomp, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora can chip down foes like Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Tera Grass Dondozo. A sturdy defensive backbone with the likes of Corviknight and Ting-Lu can help check offensive threats that threaten Iron Valiant out, such as a boosted Roaring Moon, opposing Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo. Pivots like Dragapult, Scizor, and Rotom-W can compensate for Iron Valiant's lack of bulk by bringing it in safely on foes like Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Blissey, respectively; the latter can also cripple Amoonguss with either Trick or Will-O-Wisp. Gholdengo is a great partner, as it reliably prevents the much-needed entry hazards from being removed by Rapid Spin and Defog, threatens Skeledirge and Tera Fairy Garganacl, and appreciates Iron Valiant dealing with foes like Corviknight and Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon in return.</p> "

After a Quark Drive boost, Iron Valiant outspeeds and OHKOes a plethora of premier offensive threats in the tier, such as Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Thunderbolt allows Iron Valiant to damage Corviknight and bulky Water-types like Dondozo, Azumarill, Toxapex, and Tera Water Garganacl, while Shadow Ball threatens Hatterene, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge. Psyshock scores a 2HKO on any Clodsire looking to stop Iron Valiant's sweep. With Calm Mind, Iron Valiant can switch roles from an endgame sweeper to a powerful wallbreaker. After one Calm Mind, Moonblast 2HKOes defensive Garganacl, and +1 Tera Electric Thunderbolt 2HKOes specially defensive Slowking and OHKOes Corviknight. Tera Fairy powers up Moonblast, which can now 2HKO Garganacl and Hatterene. Tera Electric boosts the power of Thunderbolt, which secures important 2HKOs on specially defensive Dondozo, Corviknight, and Toxapex, lets Iron Valiant survive Scizor's Bullet Punch, and grants Iron Valiant an immunity to paralysis from Hatterene's Nuzzle. Tera Ghost boosts Iron Valiant's Shadow Ball, letting it 2HKO specially defensive Skeledirge, and prevents revenge killing attempts from Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Iron Valiant relies heavily on its super-effective coverage moves for damage output. As a result, it struggles to make progress against Pokemon like Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Scizor. Thus, teammates like Clodsire and Ting-Lu are good defensive partners for Iron Valiant, with the added benefit of being able to set up entry hazards. Iron Moth has strong offensive synergy with Iron Valiant, being able to threaten Amoonguss, Iron Treads, and Tera Fairy Garganacl, while also being able to chip down special walls like Clodsire. On offense teams, Iron Valiant complements powerful wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and Kingambit, since they can overwhelm defensive cores and open up the path for Iron Valiant to sweep. Finally, Iron Valiant is highly reliant on Booster Energy to sweep, as it cannot normally outspeed common revenge-killers like Dragapult, Cinderace, and Meowscarada. Therefore, it is important to time when to switch in to Iron Valiant to ensure defensive counters like Skeledirge are either removed or heavily damaged so it can sweep or break through the opposing team effectively. Along these lines, it is important to conserve Iron Valiant's health, since it can survive key priority moves such as Extreme Speed from Tera Normal Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. Therefore, Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads, are great teammates for Iron Valiant.</p> "

Choice Scarf allows Iron Valiant to outspeed faster Pokemon such as Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, Dragapult, and Greninja and threaten an OHKO with Moonblast. Close Combat targets Steel-types such as Kingambit and Iron Treads. Knock Off hits Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Iron Moth for super effective damage while also crippling other Pokemon that resist both of its STAB moves such as Iron Moth and Moltres. Trick can be used to cripple walls such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Maximum Special Attack allows Iron Valiant's Moonblast to OHKO Great Tusk and Walking Wake. Tera Fairy powers up Moonblast, letting it secure OHKOs against Garchomp and Zamazenta. Alternatively, Tera Ghost makes it easier for Iron Valiant to revenge kill Dragonite thanks to its immunity to Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Iron Valiant can be found on bulky offense teams that appreciate the speed it provides. It can take advantage of Slowking's Future Sight, as Steel- and Dark-types that resist or are immune to it are threatened by Close Combat, while Future Sight hits Iron Valiant's switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Toxapex for super effective damage. Pokemon weak to Dark-type attacks such as Skeledirge, Dragapult, and Gholdengo appreciate Iron Valiant's resistance to said attacks, particularly Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and ability to threaten said Dark-types with either one of its STAB moves. Great Tusk provides entry hazard removal, preventing Iron Valiant from getting chipped throughout the game, and complements Iron Valiant to make for a sturdy duo against Kingambit, which often times Terastallizes to deal with either one of them but has a harder time dealing with both. Corviknight in particular resists all of the attacks that Iron Valiant is weak to, while other walls such as Skeledirge and Clodsire can sponge Fairy- and Poison-type hits.</p> "

Liquidation is a crucial coverage move to hit most of its would-be checks such as Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Unaware Clodsire. It is also a strong neutral attack against Gholdengo and Hatterene, as well as hitting defensive Great Tusk super effectively. Both Knock Off and Spirit Break help Iron Valiant in hitting Dragapult; Knock Off also provides great neutral coverage against Toxapex and Amoonguss, crippling them as well as other bulky foes such as Dondozo and Tera Fairy Garganacl, while Spirit Break covers Dragonite, Azumarill, and Tera Dragon Dondozo. Taunt prevents the recovery, status, Haze, and Defense-boosting attempts of defensive stalwarts such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Tera Water Skeledirge, and Tera Fairy Garganacl, letting Iron Valiant muscle past them much more easily. Tera Water is mainly used to amplify Iron Valiant's Liquidation, notably netting the OHKO on Gholdengo at +2 as well as 2HKO on Skeledirge, the latter of which would otherwise ignore Iron Valiant's Swords Dance boost with Unaware. Defensively, the Water typing helps Taunt variants beat Toxapex and Skeledirge one-on-one due to resisting their Surf and Torch Song, allows Iron Valiant to set up on Gholdengo's Make it Rain, and prevents it from being revenge killed by Scizor's Bullet Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet easily.</p> <p>Swords Dance Iron Valiant finds a place on offense and hyper offense teams. Support from Grimmsnarl's dual screens and Orthworm's Shed Tail grants Iron Valiant more setup opportunities and prevents revenge killing attempts from Pokemon like Choice Band Dragonite and Scizor; Shed Tail in particular lets it set up on walls like Garganacl and Skeledirge, avoiding Salt Cure's periodic chip and Will-O-Wisp. Entry hazards from Glimmora, Garchomp, Meowscarada, and the aforementioned Orthworm can chip down foes like Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Dondozo, letting Iron Valiant break past them more easily, especially if complemented by Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from them and other Pokemon like Clodsire and Tera Water Skeledirge; moreover, Garchomp helps in threatening Toxapex, while Meowscarada does the same to Dondozo. Other setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Agility Walking Wake are great teammates to keep up the offensive pressure against the opposition, especially as they appreciate Iron Valiant crippling Toxapex with Knock Off as well as luring in and beating Clodsire and Skeledirge for them. Early-game wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Gholdengo and Greninja are similarly important to punch holes in the opposition, notably pressuring foes like Amoonguss and Dondozo that Iron Valiant has trouble breaking through.</p> "

Choice Scarf makes Iron Valiant an excellent revenge killer, being able to outrun threats such as Dragapult, Chien-Pao, and slower Choice Scarf users like Iron Moth and Gholdengo.</p> <p>Iron Valiant has amazing coverage, which makes it an effective cleaner; however, it cannot run all of them at once. Hence, it appreciates teammates that can cover what it cannot, and it also appreciates teammates that help it switch in, as it is quite frail. Klefki can set up dual screens, which aids it in switching, and also set up Spikes, which makes it easier for Iron Valiant to clean. Klefki is also a good switch-in against opposing Fairy-types like Mimikyu. Flutter Mane and Mimikyu can weaken teams to let Iron Valiant clean up or they can clean up after it. They also deal with Ghost-types such as Gholdengo, Flutter Mane, and Skeledirge if it forgoes Shadow Ball. Azumarill checks Fire-types such as Paldean Tauros-F, Volcarona, and Iron Moth and Ground-types such as Iron Treads and Clodsire. Hatterene is a great partner, as it can break through Poison-types like Glimmora, Toxapex, and Amoonguss while also preventing entry hazards. Tinkaton can set up Stealth Rock and is a good counter to Fairy-types that check Iron Valiant otherwise such as Hatterene, Flutter Mane, and opposing Iron Valiant.</p> "

Its STAB Moonblast is one of its best qualities, being able to easily beat Mega Sableye and OHKO most opposing Fighting- and Dragon-types such as Buzzwole and Mega Altaria. Thunderbolt is great coverage to hit Flying- and Water-types like Tornadus-T and Toxapex that otherwise wall Iron Valiant, while Energy Ball lets it deal with Mega Swampert, which it can outspeed even under rain, Rotom-W, and Gastrodon more easily. Shadow Ball prevents Iron Valiant from being walled by Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Aegislash while also improving the Psychic matchup. Knock Off and Trick cripple defensive switch-ins such as Toxapex, Celesteela, and Clodsire by removing or replacing important items and forcing them to go without passive recovery or be Choice locked. Iron Valiant is also a great asset in the Fairy and Electric matchups, as it uses opposing Tapu Koko's Electric Surge to activate its own Quark Drive and outspeed even Regieleki and Alolan Raichu under Electric Terrain. Iron Valiant appreciates support from Mega Gallade, as it easily takes care of Poison-types like Clodsire, Mega Venusaur, and Alolan Muk. Iron Hands and Great Tusk are great teammates for the Electric matchup while also beating the likes of Toxapex, Galarian Moltres, and Gholdengo. Cobalion and Great Tusk can set up Stealth Rock and even clear entry hazards in the case of the latter. Cobalion also helps against Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu and Tapu Lele, while Great Tusk helps deal with Tapu Koko and Assault Vest Iron Hands. Choice Band Urshifu-R is a great ally to beat Fire-types such as Volcarona and Skeledirge and Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Excadrill. Kommo-o deals with bulky Water-, Fire-, and Grass-types like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Mega Venusaur with its massive Clangorus Soulblaze in conjunction with Taunt. Breloom is also a natural counter to Water-types, being able to deal with Swampert, and hindering defensive walls such as Toxapex with Spore. Galarian Zapdos is another great teammate that can weaken foes and safely get in Iron Valiant with U-turn.</p> "

Close Combat is the preferred Fighting-type STAB move when running Tera Fighting, as it has a chance to 2HKO both Toxapex, which takes little from Low Kick, and most Arceus-Fairy sets outright.</li> <li>Dragon Claw usually 2HKOes Skeledirge and is a reliable Dragon-type STAB move, so it tends to be preferred over Outrage. Outrage does sport overwhelming power and can 2HKO Toxapex and Alomomola, which Dragon Claw cannot do without entry hazard support. This is particularly notable for Tera Steel sets, which may otherwise lack enough breaking power.</li> <li>Flare Blitz is a very strong move under the sun and becomes incredibly powerful when boosted by Tera Fire, to the point that it even 2HKOes Fire-resistant Pokemon like Skeledirge and Toxapex. Tera Fire has the additional benefit of granting a Fairy resistance and a burn immunity.</li> <li>While not providing any boost in offensive power, Tera Steel offers several useful resistances to Fairy, Ice, and Dragon, which can help Koraidon take on Pokemon like Zacian-C, Miraidon, Arceus-Fairy, and Chien-Pao.</li> <li>Choice Band Koraidon is an insanely powerful wallbreaker that can break past all of its normal checks and switch-ins. However, it tends to be worn down easily due to being vulnerable to all entry hazards and often taking Rocky Helmet damage and Flare Blitz recoil. Thus, it pairs best with teammates like Zacian-C, which can clean up after Koraidon has broken down the main defensive core. Koraidon's breaking power allows Zacian-C the flexibility to run coverage options outside of Tera Blast such as Crunch and Wild Charge, and Zacian-C provides the team with a revenge killer as well, making the two a particularly good pair.</li> <li>Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy sets also work well with Choice Band Koraidon, as Arceus-Fairy can sweep much easier once Skeledirge and Toxapex are taken out of the picture.</li> <li>Koraidon provides excellent utility for teams that are looking for a way to force out Calm Mind Arceus formes, Calm Mind Kyogre, and Calm Mind Cresselia, as its higher Speed and overwhelming physical power can easily break past the aforementioned foes.</li> <li>Koraidon tends to be revenge killed by Zacian-C, opposing Choice Scarf Koraidon, and Choice Scarf Miraidon. As such, sporting a solid defensive core with Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Skeledirge, Groudon, and Toxapex is critical for Koraidon's success.</li> </ul> "

Life Orb gives it a crucial power boost that allows it to knock defensive staples out in a single hit after setting up a Swords Dance. Groudon, Toxapex, any Arceus forme, Landorus-T, Kyogre, and others can be knocked out in a single hit, even if they adapt fully defensive EV spreads.</li> <li>Low Kick is a powerful STAB move that takes advantage of the heavy weight of most Pokemon in the metagame. This is better than Close Combat, as it doesn't drop Koraidon's defenses while still having 120 Base Power against crucial targets.</li> <li>Stomping Tantrum allows Koraidon to 2HKO Toxapex and Skeledirge without power boosts. However, if the prior move failed, Stomping Tantrum will do double damage and OHKO Skeledirge. This is triggered when Skeledirge switches into Low Kick, for instance.</li> <li>Swords Dance is one of the most important moves in Koraidon's arsenal, allowing it to get OHKOs on anything that doesn't have the Unaware ability, as long as Koraidon has the right moves for the situation.</li> <li>Flame Charge is the key to Koraidon's sweeping abilities because of the Speed boost it provides in addition to the Fire-type coverage with no recoil. Usually, Flame Charge needs the boost from Tera Fire to fix its low Base Power and allow Koraidon to pick up KOs on healthier targets.</li> <li>Flare Blitz is a more powerful alternative to Flame Charge, which makes Koraidon significantly less reliant on Terastallization to score KOs on the opponent's defensive Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy after Swords Dance. This can open up opportunities for its fellow sweeping teammates.</li> <li>Dragon Claw fixes Koraidon's issues with Rayquaza and Giratina; however, it does make Koraidon much less threatening against Skeledirge and Toxapex, as it can no longer 2HKO either.</li> <li>Life Orb is the key to Koraidon's functioning. Life Orb is absolutely necessary, as the power boost and recoil differentiate how this Koraidon is used compared to its other sets.</li> <li>Tera Fire is necessary, as it gives Koraidon an immunity to Will-O-Wisp, resistances to Fairy and Steel, and a huge power boost to Koraidon's Fire-type attacks. This is especially efficient with Flame Charge and is often key to enabling Koraidon to sweep.</li> <li>Life Orb Koraidon fits well on any remotely offensively-minded team because it has the ability to lure in defensive Pokemon and beat them due to its unexpected Life Orb-boosted power. This can be used to open up teammates like Swords Dance, Dragon Dance, or offensive Calm Mind Arceus formes, Zacian-C, and Double Dance Miraidon.</li> </ul> "

It also boosts Flame Charge‘s power to the point it is able to OHKO Zacian-C without a boost. However, it makes Koraidon weak to common attacks like Arceus-Ground’s Earthquake, Arceus-Fairy’s Earth Power, and Kyogre’s Surf or Origin Pulse. Stealth Rock also cuts into Koraidon a lot more as Tera Fire makes Koraidon weak to it.</li> <li>Swords Dance Koraidon is a sweeper best used mid- or late-game on offensive teams, when its checks and counters have been worn down enough for Koraidon to break through them.</li> <li>The abundance of Pokemon that can effectively Terastallize into the Fairy typing, like Miraidon and Eternatus, hurts Koraidon, as it is not strong enough to break these Pokemon with just Flame Charge. Baiting out Terastallization earlier in the game massively helps out Koraidon, as that ensures it can no longer be revenge killed by a defensive Tera Fairy when going for a sweep.</li> <li>Kyogre setting up rain hurts Koraidon, as rain removes Koraidon’s Orichalcum Pulse boost and weakens Flame Charge, making it much easier to play around. However, Kyogre has no reliable recovery, so it can be chipped to the point where it can no longer compete with Koraidon’s sun.</li> <li>Physical walls like Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Dondozo are by far Koraidon’s best counters, so Koraidon appreciates teammates that can threaten them, like Miraidon, Kyogre, and Flutter Mane. Flutter Mane in particular loves Koraidon’s sun activating Protosynthesis for it.</li> <li>Physical attackers like Zacian-C, Arceus-Ground, and Groudon can all threaten damage on defensive Landorus-T, Groudon, and Arceus-Fairy, which can comfortably take on Koraidon at high HP but can easily get overwhelmed by both these physically offensive Pokemon and Koraidon.</li> </ul> "

Wild Charge deals with Pelipper and Toxapex, which otherwise wall Koraidon. Stomping Tantrum may be run to overwhelm Skeledirge instead, while also denting Toxapex after a boost. Outrage overwhelms all of these checks in one slot, but it also makes Koraidon susceptiple to revenge killers such as Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane. Tera Fire boosts Flame Charge and lets Koraidon resist Ice- and Fairy-type moves from Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, and Flutter Mane while also making it immune to Will-O-Wisp from Skeledirge. Tera Steel can be run with Iron Head, providing key resistances to Ice, Fairy, and Dragon. Special attackers such as Flutter Mane, Walking Wake, and Chi-Yu appreciate Koraidon setting up sun. In return, they pressure Koraidon's checks in Skeledirge, Pelipper, and Great Tusk. Koraidon's ability to pressure special walls such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire is appreciated by Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Miraidon, and Gholdengo.

However, this set is completely walled by Clodsire. Tera Dragon powers up Dragon Pulse, which allows Miraidon to 2HKO Ting-Lu and Clodsire with a 2 HKO at +1 after Spikes damage and pick up KOs from higher ranges of health on other neutral targets like Arceus-Ground. This set should be considered on either balance offense teams as a cleaner or hyper offense sweeper that can break open the opposing team. Partners in hyper Offense teams such as dual screens Grimmsnarl allow it to easily set up and sweep. On the other hand, leads such as Meowscarada and Froslass can aid Miraidon's sweep by setting up Spikes to weaken opposing Pokemon into range of Miraidon's attacks. Miraidon benefits from partners that can allow it to break its checks much more easily such as Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ground, Kyogre. and Koraidon.

U-turn takes advantage of Miraidon's ability to threaten most of the metagame to generate momentum for its teammates. Miraidon's preferred Tera type is Fairy, which allows it to force a 50/50 against opposing Choice Scarf Miraidon and Koraidon. Tera Fairy also removes Miraidon's Ice-weakness, allowing it to survive hits from Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao. Alternatively, Tera Dragon can be used to substantially increase the damage done by Draco Meteor, allowing Miraidon to heavily damage Ting-Lu and more effectively break Clodsire. Tera Electric is a third option, maximizing the power of Electro Drift once opposing Ground-types have been removed. Choice Scarf Miraidon fits well on many balance teams that appreciate the revenge killing that it offers. It pairs especially well with Pokemon that can wear down its Ground-type checks, notably Chien-Pao, Great Tusk, and other Miraidon. Defensively, balance staples like Clodsire, Corviknight, Iron Treads, Ting-Lu, and Toxapex are greatly appreciated, as they can deal with Pokemon like opposing Miraidon, Great Tusk, Koraidon, and Chien-Pao that can potentially come in for free after Miraidon has picked up a KO. Gothitelle is also an especially good partner thanks to its ability to trap and remove many of Miraidon's most effective checks, notably beating Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Blissey, clearing the way for it to sweep late-game. Similarly, Dugtrio is also a decent partner, as it can trap and eliminate opposing Choice Scarf Miraidon and Koraidon that have locked into Dragon Moves and Choice Band Chien-Pao that hasn't locked into Ice Shard while also beating Blissey, Clodsire, and chipped Iron Treads.</p> "

Hydro Steam is Walking Wake's excellent signature move; in addition to having zero drawbacks its power is increased with sun active, making safely switching into Walking Wake a difficult task. Flamethrower hits Grass-types like Amoonguss, and Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Corviknight for super effective damage. Draco Meteor is Walking Wake's strongest attack and eliminates Dragapult, Dragonite, opposing Walking Wake, and Roaring Moon while dealing high damage to Water-types like Toxapex and muscling past Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo. Dragon Pulse is a weaker but safer move that still hits opposing Dragon-types hard and lacks drawbacks, which makes it more useful late-game when Draco Meteor's higher damage output is no longer needed to secure KOs. Tera Water removes Walking Wake's Fairy weakness while increasing Hydro Steam's damage output to nuclear levels, allowing it to outright 2HKO moderately bulky Water-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-W. Tera Dragon turns Walking Wake's Grass neutrality into a resistance while allowing it to 2HKO Clodsire and Slowking, allowing Walking Wake to blow past its checks and more reliably sweep late-game. 244 Special Attack EVs put Walking Wake's Special Attack exactly one point lower than its Speed, causing Protosynthesis to increase Speed and drastically improve Walking Wake's matchup against otherwise-faster threats like Meowscarada, Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Roaring Moon; however, 252 Special Attack EVs to allow a Special Attack boost from Protosynthesis is still perfectly viable to further capitalize on Walking Wake's wallbreaking prowess, albeit at the cost of now losing the one-on-one matchup against the aforementioned faster threats. Even Assault Vest Azumarill, which otherwise checks Walking Wake, has a chance of being 2HKOed by a sun-boosted Tera Water Hydro Steam with a Special Attack boost.</p> <p>Though its offensive presence is useful in general, Walking Wake's unique attributes make it most powerful on and against sun teams. Torkoal is an excellent partner for Walking Wake, as its ability to set sun with Drought maximizes its damage output with Hydro Steam and Flamethrower and enables its Protosynthesis to boost its Speed or Special Attack. Torkoal can also set Stealth Rock to allow Walking Wake to more reliably 2HKO threats like Clodsire and Toxapex and remove opposing Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, and it appreciates Walking Wake’s ability to break past opposing weather setters like Tyranitar and Pelipper with ease. Specially defensive walls like Slowking and Water Absorb Clodsire give Walking Wake a lot of trouble, since they can sponge its attacks. Powerful physical attackers like offensive Great Tusk and Choice Band Roaring Moon are excellent teammates due to their ability to muscle past these threats; in return, Walking Wake breaks past their own defensive checks such as Ting-Lu, Dondozo, and Corviknight. Moreover, both of these teammates can also utilize Protosynthesis effectively. Assault Vest Azumarill resists both Hydro Steam and Flamethrower, is immune to Walking Wake's Dragon-type attacks, and threatens to OHKO it with Play Rough, though it can be worn down over time due to its lack of recovery. Offensive Grass-types like Meowscarada and Breloom cannot switch into Azumarill, but they can greatly threaten it with their super effective STAB moves. Eject Button Amoonguss is another excellent teammate, as it checks Azumarill both offensively and defensively and can safely pivot Walking Wake in. In return, Walking Wake can handle bulky Steel-types like Kingambit and Corviknight for Meowscarada and Gholdengo for Breloom and Amoonguss.</p> "

Substitute relieves the need for prediction, protects Walking Wake from revenge killing attempts, and allows it to avoid residual damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure. Hydro Steam's power boost in sun makes it desirable both on and against sun teams. If this attribute is not sought after, then Hydro Pump can be run instead. Roar prevents Pokemon like Terastallized Garganacl as well as Belly Drum Azumarill from setting up on Walking Wake. It is also a good way for Walking Wake to make progress via residual entry hazard damage even when the opposition has a counter like Water Absorb Clodsire, Assault Vest Toxapex, or specially defensive Dondozo. However, Flamethrower can be used instead to round out Walking Wake's coverage, doing more damage to Pokemon like Kingambit, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. Flamethrower also gains a boost in power from sun, which alongside the Protosynthesis boost can allow Flamethrower to OHKO the aforementioned targets. Tera Water increases the damage output of its Water-type STAB move, potentially 2HKOing Pokemon like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Corviknight. Tera Dragon powers up Dragon Pulse, allowing it to OHKO Garchomp and Hydreigon. Finally, Tera Fairy removes Walking Wake's original weaknesses, allowing for surprise KOs on Dragon-types like opposing Walking Wake and especially Dragapult—a thorn in Walking Wake's side because of Infilitrator nullifying Substitute—as well as others like Kingambit and Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Walking Wake is a sun team staple, so of course it is often paired with other sun team staples like Torkoal and Eject Button Hatterene. Torkoal sets sun with Drought, which gives Walking Wake a boost to its Special Attack and makes it an even more threatening wallbreaker. Torkoal is also good at forcing switches with Yawn, which gives Walking Wake opportunities to come in. Hatterene also provides a switch-in opportunity thanks to Eject Button, and it can also regenerate Walking Wake with Healing Wish, giving it more chances to wallbreak. Both can prevent irksome entry hazards either via Rapid Spin or Magic Bounce, a valuable attribute, as damage inflicted by hazards, most notably Toxic Spikes, limits Walking Wake's wallbreaking potential. Because Dragapult is such an issue for this set, Pokemon that can take advantage of it like Kingambit, Iron Valiant, and Ting-Lu are good partners for Walking Wake. Walking Wake has numerous roadblocks that stop it from making much progress like Water Absorb Clodsire, Assault Vest Toxapex, and Slowking; additional wallbreakers like Great Tusk, Roaring Moon, and mixed Garchomp to smash through them are appreciated. Hazard setters like the aforementioned Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Torkoal are indispensable as allies, for their hazards wear down checks and punish forced switches, be it through threatening the opposition or by phazing via Roar.</p> "

It also outspeeds common Choice Scarf users such as Great Tusk, Flamigo, and Iron Treads, which lets it clean Ground, Flying, and Fire teams late-game. With strong STAB moves in Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump, Walking Wake blows past Baxcalibur and Great Tusk. Flamethrower roasts Steel-types like Scizor and Gholdengo, though it lacks the firepower to 2HKO specially defensive Corviknight. Hydro Steam, emboldened by sun, lets Walking Wake demolish Fire teams. Alternatively, Dragon Pulse provides a weaker but more consistent STAB attack, which is great against opposing Dragon teams. The given EV spread and Timid nature cause Protosynthesis to boost Speed, allowing Walking Wake to outspeed Chlorophyll Scovillain and Choice Scarf Cinderace.</p> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult is an excellent teammate, as it can wear down or eliminate bulky threats such as Corviknight and Hatterene and is also fast enough to deal with Choice Specs Flutter Mane for Walking Wake. Baxcalibur, Hydreigon, and Haxorus appreciate Walking Wake providing speed control, allowing them to wallbreak more effectively. These teammates also batter down defensive walls such as Clodsire, Gholdengo, and Toxapex, making cleaning up with Walking Wake much easier. Dragalge can pivot into Fairy-type moves from Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant as well as set Toxic Spikes to further wear down the opposing team. This also synergizes well with Garchomp, which sets entry hazards in Spikes and Stealth Rock, phazes the opposition with Dragon Tail or Roar, and pressures Poison- and Steel-types like Clodsire and Klefki. Cyclizar gets rid of entry hazards for Walking Wake, allowing it to come onto the field more.</p> "

It can force out most walls and has a plethora of switch-in opportunities against the common Ground-types in the tier, such as Great Tusk and Ting-Lu.</li> <li>Wild Charge is an important coverage option that allows it to hit Corviknight, which resists Iron Leaves's STAB moves. It also OHKOes Pelipper.</li> <li>Close Combat hits the Steel-types that resist Iron Leaves's STAB moves, like Kingambit and Tera Steel users. Close Combat is also crucial for OHKOing Chi-Yu and Chien-Pao on the switch in.</li> <li>Swords Dance is an alternative option that can be used over one of the coverage moves to punish foes trying to stall out Electric Terrain turns by predicting Protect or a switch.</li> <li>Leftovers mitigates passive damage from hazards, Rocky Helmet, poison from Baneful Banker, and recoil from Wild Charge, providing Iron Leaves with some staying power. Iron Leaves with Leftovers and four attacks is best used as an early- to mid-game attacker that aims to create opportunities for teammates to sweep.</li> <li>Life Orb gives an immense power boost but reduces Iron Leaves's longevity. It will be worn down severely by the time it manages to beat its check, which allows it less opportunities to attack afterwards. Notably, Life Orb allows Psyblade to OHKO Miraidon and 2HKO Skeledirge in Electric Terrain. Life Orb is best in combination with Swords Dance to minimize recoil. Using Iron Leaves this way is most potent mid- to late-game.</li> <li>A Jolly nature is necessary to be able to outspeed Timid Chi-Yu and max Speed Palafin.</li> <li>Tera Psychic is the main option to increase Psyblade damage, remove Ice and Fire weaknesses, and actually be able to take a U-turn in a pinch. Tera Psychic allows Iron Leaves to OHKO Koraidon without Electric Terrain, OHKO defensive Great Tusk and Miraidon in Electric Terrain, and guarantee a 2HKO on Skeledirge and Terastallized Alomomola. It's meant to be utilized with four attacks.</li> <li>Tera Steel can be used to face off better against Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Kingambit. It also has the benefit of a Poison immunity, which can allow Iron Leaves to not get worn down by Baneful Bunker from Toxapex, and a U-turn resistance that can be used to catch the opponent off guard. This is a riskier Tera to commit to, as it makes Iron Leaves weak to both of Great Tusk's STAB moves instead of resisting them. Tera Steel is meant to be utilized with four attacks.</li> <li>Tera Fighting gives Iron Leaves a Close Combat that OHKOes physically defensive Corviknight after a Swords Dance without Electric Terrain. Tera Fighting's defensive contributions are useful against the aforementioned Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, and especially Kingambit. This Tera type is meant to be utilized with Swords Dance and Close Combat.</li> <li>Tera Electric can be used to power up Wild Charge, which is useful against Corviknight and Tera Flying users like Kingambit, and it also gives Iron Leaves neutrality to all of its weaknesses. This Tera type is meant to be used with Swords Dance and Wild Charge to deal with Pokemon that resist Iron Leaves's STAB moves but are neutral to Electric. Tera Electric is the most risky, as you're investing your Terastallization for a Pokemon that's likely to KO itself quickly.</li> <li>The biggest downside to Iron Leaves is how dependent it is on Electric Terrain to function properly. It can still be used to force out Great Tusk and Ting-Lu without Electric Terrain, but it's underwhelming compared to when Electric Terrain is active.</li> <li>Miraidon is invaluable as a partner to Iron Leaves because it provides Electric Terrain and lures in Ground-types to U-turn on, which gives Iron Leaves a free switch. Specifically, Choice Scarf Miraidon is the best for the job, as it can provide Speed control and function as a late-game cleaner to take advantage of the holes Iron Leaves leaves behind.</li> <li>Specially defensive Corviknight is a great partner, as it can also provide U-turn support to get Iron Leaves in, as well as make up for the Iron Bundle weakness Miraidon and Iron Leaves share. Corviknight can provide hazard control with Defog, but an additional Rapid Spinner like Great Tusk or Iron Treads is also advisable.</li> <li>Iron Leaves fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, which also makes defensive pivots that are used in the archetype, like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Skeledirge, good partners.</li> </ul> "

However, Tera Fairy Arghonaut can wall most Iron Valiant sets and phazes it.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Venomicon, Toxapex, and Amoonguss wall Arghonaut with ease and threaten it out with Hurricane or Sludge Bomb.

Meowscarada and Krilowatt deal significant damage to Arghonaut before it Terastallizes, but Arghonaut has little to fear from them after Terastallizing. Furthermore, Krilowatt must be careful when switching in, since it is heavily crippled by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Miasmaw: Miasmaw ignores Unaware thanks to Neutralizing Gas, making it extremely difficult for Arghonaut to handle.

Additionally, Arghonaut's ability to force switches and strong matchup into Equilibra make it an excellent user of Spikes. Circle Throw phazes common setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Baxcalibur and whittles down the opposing team in conjunction with Spikes. Knock Off is Arghonaut's best way to force progress against walls such as Garganacl and Venomicon and deals heavy damage to Ghost-types trying to switch into Circle Throw such as Dragapult and Gholdengo. Leftovers provides Arghonaut with extra longevity and makes it less reliant on Recover, while Covert Cloak shields it from chip damage from Salt Cure and other bothersome secondary effects such as Special Defense drops from Shadow Ball. The given EVs allow Arghonaut to avoid the 2HKO from Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush and from Krilowatt's Tera Water Surf. Tera Fairy flips many of Arghonaut's bad matchups, letting it check a wide array of threats including Venomicon lacking Sludge Bomb, Krilowatt, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult.</p> <p>Arghonaut fits mostly on balance and stall teams that appreciate its ability to blanket check various offensive threats and force progress with Knock Off and Spikes.

Ground-types such as Equilibra, Great Tusk, and Garchomp can deal with Electric- and Poison-types such as Iron Hands and Toxapex, while in return Arghonaut can switch into Greninja lacking Grass Knot. Skeledirge forms a formidable Unaware core with Arghonaut, taking on Jumbao, Venomicon, and Iron Valiant while Arghonaut covers it against threats like Snaelstrom, Garganacl, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Bulky setup sweepers such as Naviathan, Ceruledge, and Hatterene take advantage of Arghonaut whittling down their checks with Spikes and Knock Off over the course of the game.</p> "

Horn Leech provides some modicum of recovery to compensate for Double-Edge's recoil. Rapid Spin both increases Caribolt's Speed, giving it sweeping potential, and supports teammates weak to Stealth Rock like Baxcalibur and Iron Moth, allowing them to forego Heavy-Duty Boots. Leftovers helps make up for Double-Edge's recoil alongside Horn Leech, while Magnet powers up Caribolt's Electric-type attacks even further. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Choice Scarf Jumbao at +1 Speed and Krilowatt at +0, but Adamant is an option to deal as much damage as possible, supporting its hyper offense teammates. Tera Grass is an option to turn Ground-types like Equilibra and Great Tusk into setup fodder, but Caribolt's main focus should be on wallbreaking as much as possible for its teammates.</p> <p>Caribolt is best utilized on hyper offense teams, which appreciate its incredible wallbreaking ability. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Iron Moth, Baxcalibur, and Venomicon-E appreciate Caribolt removing the hazard, allowing Iron Moth and Baxcalibur to run more offensive items over Heavy-Duty Boots. Other physical sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and Dragonite love Caribolt powering through Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Arghonaut; Roaring Moon pairs particularly well with Caribolt, as it can threaten the Grass-types like Jumbao and Amoonguss that give Caribolt trouble with Tera Flying + Acrobatics. This love is shared by special sweepers like Iron Valiant and Hatterene, which need Skeledirge off the table before attempting a sweep. Caribolt appreciates entry hazards weakening physically bulky Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu—which can beat Caribolt if it Terastallizes—into KO range of its attacks, so pairing it with a dedicated lead like Greninja or Meowscarada is suggested.</p> "

      "comments": "<h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Rotom-W hard counters Equilibra, as it takes negligible damage from any of Equilibra's moves and threatens it with Hydro Pump. Arghonaut similarly brushes off Equilibra's attacks and threatens to cripple it with Knock Off. Greninja and Krilowatt can switch in on Flash Cannon and threaten to deal significant damage to Equilibra, but they are 2HKOed by Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Flying-types: Bulky Flying-types such as Corviknight, Venomicon, and Tomohawk give Equilibra trouble, as they don’t take much damage from Equilibra's moves and force it out with super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Offensive Great Tusk sets OHKO Equilibra with Close Combat, while defensive sets can either deal significant damage with Body Press or cripple it with Knock Off. Other bulky Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire are easily capable of dealing with Bulletproof Equilibra, but it has little to fear from them if it forgoes Bulletproof for Levitate.</p> <p><strong>Item Manipulation: Equilibra heavily relies on the passive recovery granted by Leftovers, so it must be careful when switching in on Pokemon with Knock Off or Trick, such as Iron Treads and Gholdengo, so as not to risk taking a significant blow to its longevity.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Equilibra's solid typing, great stats, and access to Rapid Spin make it one of the premier defensive pivots and entry hazard removers in the metagame. Levitate is the recommended ability, as it drastically improves Equilibra's matchups against opposing Ground-types, such as Clodsire and Garchomp, while also presenting more opportunities to clear entry hazards without worrying about taking Spikes damage. Alternatively, Bulletproof blocks Focus Blast from Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Jumbao and Shadow Ball from Ghost-types such as Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark. Protect allows Equilibra to scout the foe's moves and get additional healing from Leftovers, while Pain Split gives it an alternative form of recovery, lowering its reliance on Leftovers. Alternatively, Aura Sphere allows Equilibra to beat opposing Levitate Equilibra and improves its matchup against Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Colossoil. The given EV spread allows Equilibra to avoid an OHKO from Choice Specs Greninja's Hydro Pump, survive the combination of Moonblast into Close Combat from mixed Tera Fairy Iron Valiant, and outspeed Adamant Breloom after getting a Speed boost from Rapid Spin. Tera Water allows Equilibra to tank Fire-type attacks from Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Astrolotl, and Skeledirge. Alternatively, Tera Flying flips Equilibra's matchups against Fighting-types such as Great Tusk and Breloom on their heads while allowing Bulletproof Equilibra to safely stay in against opposing Ground-types.</p> <p>Equilibra struggles against Water- and Flying-types, so Electric-types such as Caribolt, Iron Hands, and Plasmanta make for great partners. Water-types such as Arghonaut and Rotom-W synergize well with Equilibra, since they can switch in on Fire-type attacks aimed at it; they, in turn, appreciate Equilibra's ability to absorb Electric-type attacks and pressure Jumbao, one of their greatest threats. Venomicon is one of the best defensive partners for Equilibra, since it walls many of the Fighting- and Ground-types that Equilibra struggles against such as Great Tusk; in return, Equilibra deals with Pokemon that Venomicon struggles against, such as Stratagem and Hatterene. Equilibra relies heavily on Leftovers for recovery, so it appreciates support from teammates that don't mind taking Knock Off, like Corviknight and Toxapex. Thanks to Equilibra's ability to consistently keep entry hazards off the field, it works well with teammates that are worn down by them, such as Snaelstrom, Iron Moth, and Loaded Dice Baxcalibur.</p> "
