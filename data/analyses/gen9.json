This provides a myriad of benefits, including blanket checking most Pokemon, scouting sets, and PP stalling less threatening foes. While Eviolite is usually the best item, Toxic Orb provides much better matchups against Poison Heal users while Covert Cloak is useful against Nuzzle and Spirit Shackle users. The given moves offer the most utility in the rare situations Chansey is not transformed, like phazing Substitute users, pivoting, acting as a cleric, and removing Chansey's Toxic Orb. Offensive threats such as Zacian-C and Poison Heal users such as Arceus-Fairy appreciate the information Imposter Chansey provides through scouting, with Poison Heal users also acting as Knock Off absorbers. Imposter Chansey appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon like Dondozo and RegenVest Ting-Lu for safe scouting; these Pokemon can also provide Knock Off support, aiding against Judgment users like Miraidon that can otherwise defeat Imposter Chansey. Tera Normal gives Chansey a STAB boost on Judgment, improving its matchup into Pokemon like Miraidon, while Tera Fire and Tera Ghost are useful against Zacian-C and trapping moves, respectively.</p> "

Earthquake provides coverage for Pokemon like Clodsire that Iron Hands would otherwise struggle against. Iron Hands can also use Volt Switch alongside its low Speed to serve as a bulky slow pivot to safely bring in frail offensive teammates like Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle. Because of its below average Special Defense, Iron Hands pairs well with specially defensive teammates like Blissey and Ice Scales Corviknight. Iron Hands also struggles against Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Scream Tail, so it appreciates teammates like Gholdengo and Iron Moth that can take them on.</p> "
