It also has a solid offensive presence due to its very high Special Attack, which lets it 3HKO Pokemon like Keldeo and Iron Hands. Sludge Bomb hits the plethora of Grass- and Fairy-types, most notably Tangrowth, Tapu Fini, Clefable, and Mega Altaria. Earth Power provides coverage against Steel-types like Aegislash and Excadrill, and it can also be useful to hit targets like Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Mega Tyranitar. Knock Off can cripple switch-ins like Latios and Chansey, and Giga Drain hits Water- and Ground-types, threatening the likes of Slowbro, Hippowdon, and specially defensive Gastrodon. Leech Seed lets Mega Venusaur passively heal from Pokemon like Blissey. Synthesis can keep Mega Venusaur healthy in the face of entry hazards and heal in front of targets like Tangrowth that can't damage it heavily. This given EV spread allows Mega Venusaur to outspeed Choice Band Tyranitar. Mega Venusaur, even with its ability, can have a hard time dealing with most Fire-types like Victini, Ceruledge, and Cinderace that can potentially overwhelm it with their boosted attacks, so it appreciate defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon, Tapu Fini, and Skeledirge. Mega Venusaur also has a hard time dealing with special attackers like Alakazam and Choice Specs Hydreigon, making specially defensive teammates like Celesteela and Chansey good teammates. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Mew, and Excadrill can appreciate having Mega Venusaur as a teammate, as it can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Cinderace. Mega Venusaur is very susceptible to being chipped by entry hazards so it appreciate entry hazard removal options like Excadrill, Salamence, and Tapu Fini. It is also chipped by sand and burns, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Tyranitar and Hippowdon, such as Excadrill, Keldeo, and Hisuian Lilligant, as well as Pokemon immune to burn like Cinderace and Iron Moth make good partners.</p>"

Synthesis provides reliable healing, which, combined with Leech Seed and Sludge Bomb's poison, allows Mega Venusaur to wear down foes such as Garchomp. Hidden Power Fire handles Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Gholdengo, although Earth Power can also be used to answer Steel-, Poison- and Fire-types such as Heatran and Iron Moth. The Speed EVs allow Mega Venusaur to outpace Adamant Azumarill. Mega Venusaur's teammates greatly appreciate its ability to handle threats like Mega Diancie and Mega Scizor and clear Toxic Spikes. Ferrothorn and Cradily form a solid defensive core, absorbing hits from Flying- and Psychic-types such as Galarian Moltres and Tapu Lele, while Mega Venusaur tanks Fire-, Ice-, and Fighting-type attacks. Whimsicott and Tapu Bulu help with the Dragon matchup, and Celebi handles the problematic Poison-types like Toxapex and Nidoking. Rillaboom and Breloom provide strong priority, allowing them to threaten faster threats such as Nihilego. Rillaboom also sets up Grassy Terrain to supply additional passive recovery along with Mega Venusaur's Leech Seed, boosting longevity. Meowscarada and Zarude serve as speedy wallbreakers that are capable of breaking through walls such as Clodsire and Skeledirge.

Sludge Bomb allows Mega Venusaur to threaten Fairy-types like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. Earth Power is required to hit Heatran and also to prevent the likes of Gholdengo, Sneasler, and Kartana from taking advantage of Mega Venusaur’s STAB options. Giga Drain hits most foes that resist its coverage moves like Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Great Tusk for neutral damage. It also gives more healing opportunities, since Synthesis has low PP. The given EVs allow Mega Venusaur to outspeed Landorus-T and Moltres, potentially KOing them with a crucial Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb, respectively. Mega Venusaur pairs well with teammates with a strong offensive presence, since they can fall back on its defensive capabilities to break throughout the course of a game. Specifically, since Mega Venusaur is unfazed by Knock Off and status conditions, it can reliably check Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Kartana can utilize its defensive capabilities and ability to switch into their checks to wallbreak more consistently. However, Mega Venusaur is very vulnerable to entry hazards, so allies that can remove them like Rotom-W and Great Tusk make great partners. Mega Venusaur is also easily checked by the likes of Zapdos and Tapu Lele, which can threaten it with powerful STAB moves, and Skarmory, which ignores damage from its moves. Some good teammates that can cover and check these include Gliscor, Heatran, and Gholdengo; in exchange, Mega Venusaur can check opponents like Rotom-W and Landorus-T. Finally, since Synthesis heals less in rain, Mega Venusaur has reduced longevity against this archetype despite its resistance to Water, so it will need additional support from teammates like Gastrodon and Rotom-W to cover this.</p>"

While U-turn can grab momentum against foes such as Latios and Mega Latias, and Poison Jab has some utility in targeting Fairy-types like Clefable, Bug and Poison is an atrocious STAB combination that has no way to break through common defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Buzzwole, and it notably struggles to even touch Steel-types. Skarmory and Celesteela stonewall Mega Beedrill, and while other Steel-types dislike Drill Run and Knock Off, virtually every Steel-type, from Bisharp to Excadrill, can usually beat Mega Beedrill one-on-one. As a pivot, Mega Beedrill suffers massively due to its Stealth Rock weakness and inability to hold Heavy-Duty Boots, which makes it very over-reliant on hazard control, or else it'd be worn down rapidly. Mega Beedrill's paltry defensive stats and terrible typing give it practically no defensive utility, rendering it extremely vulnerable to Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Zapdos and priority moves like Scizor's Bullet Punch and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Pursuit is another seemingly useful option, with its ability to outpace the likes of Choice Specs Latios and Mega Latias working well in tandem with Mega Beedrill's ability to hit them super effectively. However, Mega Beedrill is outclassed as a Pursuit trapper by Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Tyranitar, both of which have a much better offensive and defensive presence thanks to their better typings. For teammates, entry hazard removers like Excadrill and Tapu Fini are mandatory. Special attackers that can remove or chip physical walls, such as Iron Moth and Thundurus-T, are necessary to let Mega Beedrill have any hope of threatening the opposing team. Magnezone is notable for its ability to trap and remove Skarmory and Celesteela. Entry hazards from setters like Ting-Lu and Skarmory can chip Mega Beedrill's targets and help it actually KO its targets.

With a Nasty Plot + Encore set, Alolan Ninetales can also take advantage of and remove Dondozo, Toxapex, Calm Mind Clefable, and Iron Defense Corviknight. Baxcalibur makes an excellent pairing with Alolan Sandslash, greatly appreciating Alolan Sandslash eliminating targets such as Flutter Mane and Alolan Ninetales and removing entry hazards to allow it to sweep unimpeded. Choice Band Chien-Pao is another teammate that appreciates Alolan Sandslash pressuring Fairy-types, clearing entry hazards, and generally softening up the opposing team so it can avoid being chipped down over the course of a game and easily clean. In exchange, Chien-Pao can threaten Corviknight and Kingambit. Froslass absorbs Fighting-type moves for Alolan Sandslash and enjoys it removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and Empoleon via Knock Off, rendering them vulnerable to Froslass’s Spikes. Smack Down Mamoswine similarly appreciates Alolan Sandslash’s Knock Off with regard to its Stealth Rock and can take out Corviknight, which otherwise walls Alolan Sandslash. Frosmoth values Alolan Sandslash bringing down Articuno and Flutter Mane, while in return threatening the pesky Quagsire, Great Tusk, and Ursaluna-B. Cetitan and Cloyster are other examples of Ice-type sweepers that massively benefit from Alolan Sandslash clearing entry hazards prior to their setup.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Clefable’s excellent utility, movepool, and defensive typing allow it to function as a powerful defensive piece. Its excellent pure Fairy typing creates favorable matchups versus Pokemon such as Latios, Buzzwole, and Iron Hands. Clefable acts as a Toxic immunity thanks to Magic Guard and also possesses a permanent immunity to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and sandstorm. On offensive teams, Clefable usually fills the role of hazard setter through Stealth Rock. It can use Knock Off to limit the longevity of potential switch-ins such as Celesteela, Amoonguss, and Leftovers variants of Excadrill. Thunder Wave is another useful option, adding the potential to cripple offensive threats such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, Enamorus, and Z-Celebrate Victini. Defensive teams may choose to employ a more passive variant of Clefable using Wish and Protect to provide longevity to Pokemon without access to reliable recovery such as Mega Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Celesteela. Aromatherapy is similarly useful to allow teammates to outlast the opposing team. Additionally, it allows for more aggressive play against Pokemon reliant on status such as Skeledirge, allowing for them to be safely Pursuit trapped by Mega Tyranitar. Clefable’s ability to spread chip damage through utility moves such as Stealth Rock and Knock Off lends it to supporting wallbreakers like Latios, Galarian Zapdos, and Excadrill. Clefable also pairs well with entry hazard users such as Mega Tyranitar, Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Sandy Shocks to wear down the opposition, as it can get rid of items from entry hazard removers such as Excadrill, Tapu Fini, and Cinderace. Clefable struggles with heavy hitters able to trade powerful attacks for the chip damage inflicted by Clefable, such as Iron Moth, Excadrill, and Enamorus. This weakness is mitigated by teammates able to act as revenge killers like Cinderace, Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, and Mega Aerodactyl. Defensive partners such as Slowbro, Celesteela, Mega Tyranitar, and Blissey can beat Steel, Poison, and Fire-types which often beat Clefable. In return, Clefable can beat Dark- and Fighting-types such as Buzzwole, Iron Hands, Hydreigon, and Mandibuzz. Clefable is also a good switch-in to many Knock Off users that might cripple many of its partners, most notably Assault Vest Tangrowth and Chansey.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Calm Mind Clefable is a strong wincon, becoming extremely difficult to threaten once boosted. Magic Guard allows it to set up in the face of defensive Pokemon that would otherwise rely on status moves to threaten it, such as specially oriented Buzzwole, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Leftovers is the preferred item to decrease the likelihood of running out of Soft-Boiled PP, but Life Orb can also be used in combination with Magic Guard for a significant increase in damage, helping defeat Pokemon such as specially defensive Celesteela, Taunt Tapu Fini, and Excadrill. Flamethrower is preferred to hit Steel-types such as Excadrill, Aegislash, Celesteela, and Scizor. Thunder can also be used for passable neutral coverage in addition to the chance to paralyze foes such as Iron Moth, Hisuian Arcanine, and Mega Venusaur. Knock Off offers more permanent damage on Steel-types, removing their items such as Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots at the cost of being unable to directly break through them. Aromatherapy is often seen on stall teams in addition to Unaware, allowing Clefable to function as both the team’s cleric and wincon. Clefable naturally checking Fighting-types makes it a good teammate for Pokemon such as Excadrill and Bisharp. Mega Tyranitar appreciates this while providing Clefable with crucial Pursuit support, trapping Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge. Offensive pivots such as Cinderace and Choice Scarf Hydreigon appreciate Clefable taking advantage of the defensive walls they might be unable to break through. Calm Mind Clefable is vulnerable to foes able to immediately threaten it such as Excadrill, Celesteela, and Iron Moth. Steel- and Poison-resistant teammates such as Celesteela, Slowbro, and Mega Aerodactyl can cover for Clefable, giving it more opportunities to set up. Unaware Clefable being pressured by entry hazards means it necessitates strong hazard control options, such as Defog Skarmory, Mega Sableye, and Salamence. A relative lack of bulk and initial power means friendly entry hazards are appreciated from teammates including Skarmory, Chansey, Hippowdon, and Jirachi that can help wear down incoming defensive Pokemon more quickly.</p>"

It's able to fulfill many roles such as a Stealth Rock setter, a support Pokemon thanks to Thunder Wave and Knock Off crippling its checks like Heatran and Mega Scizor, and a potent sweeper with Calm Mind. Magic Guard lets Clefable absorb status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp for teammates like Ting-Lu, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon. It also allows it to ignore entry hazards, helping it check Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Dragapult. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn from Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T. Tera Water allows Clefable to have a better matchup into rain teams while resisting Steel-type attacks from Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Kingambit, allowing Clefable to catch them off-guard and cripple them. Tera Steel, on the other hand, allows Clefable to catch Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant with a Thunder Wave. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn appreciate Clefable's ability to incapacitate common Defog users such as Tornadus-T and Rotom-W thanks to Knock Off. They also appreciate having one moveslot being freed if Clefable carries Stealth Rock. Similarly, Clefable can cripple common entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Heatran, helping Defog users like the aforementioned Tornadus-T and Rotom-W perform their role. Toxapex works well with Clefable, as it checks Poison- and Steel-types like Iron Moth and Mega Scizor, helping Clefable spread Thunder Wave or set up with Calm Mind. They can also both overwhelm Ferrothorn, as the former can burn it and the latter nullifies Leech Seed's recovery. If Thunder Wave is used, Hex users like Gholdengo and Dragapult can be used to break Pokemon like Toxapex and Heatran that would otherwise stop Clefable from sweeping with Calm Mind.</p>"

Moonblast provides a reliable and powerful STAB move that hits neutral targets such as Gastrodon, Mamoswine, and Ogerpon-W. Alternatively, Ice Beam may be used to hit Ground- and Flying-type Pokemon like Clodsire, Zapdos, Ursaluna-B, and Gliscor. Thunderbolt threatens the aforementioned Corviknight, Toxapex, and Empoleon as well as Basculegion-F, Moltres, and Manaphy. Flamethrower may be used to hit Steel-types such as Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Scizor; it should also be noted that Clefable survives a Bullet Punch from Choice Band Scizor and OHKOes it back. Magic Guard notably offers Clefable an extremely valuable immunity to entry hazards due to the Fairy type's lack of entry hazard removal, in addition to negating Toxic from Toxapex, Gliscor, and Clodsire and letting Clefable use Life Orb without recoil, enhancing its setup ability. Furthermore, Magic Guard allows Clefable to combat Alolan Muk more effectively, and Life Orb enables valuable damage rolls like 2HKOing Toxapex with unboosted Thunderbolt, 2HKOing Assault Vest Iron Hands using Moonblast after a Calm Mind, OHKOing Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao with Calm Mind-boosted Thunderbolt and Moonblast, respectively, and applying additional pressure on Quagsire. Leftovers is the preferred item, however, due to Moonlight's limited recovery and Clefable's mediocre bulk. The given EV spread allows Clefable to outpace Corviknight and maximizes its physical bulk, lessening the chance of Clefable being revenge killed once set up, notably letting it take two Iron Heads from Corviknight.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is an excellent teammate due to its ability to remove Steel-types like Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit as well as beat Poison-types such as Okidogi and Clodsire using Psyshock. Iron Valiant also provides setup opportunities for Clefable via Trick, hindering walls like Gastrodon and Heavy Slam Ting-Lu. In return, Clefable wears down Flying-types like Corviknight, Moltres, and Gliscor as well as Poison-types such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. Klefki provides dual screens support to aid in Clefable's Calm Mind setup, deters setup sweepers such as Scizor and Ogerpon-W with Foul Play, and sets up Spikes to wear down foes like Alolan Muk. Azumarill is a major asset in the Ground, Fire, and Steel matchups, threatening Clodsire, Hisuian Arcanine, and Gholdengo as well as aiding in the Poison matchup by removing walls like Alolan Muk and Galarian Slowking. Flutter Mane aids in the Ghost matchup, taking out threats like Gholdengo and Ceruledge and eliminating threats such as Articuno and Volcarona with Power Gem and Okidogi and Clodsire with Psyshock. In return, Flutter Mane appreciates Clefable chipping down Toxapex, Gliscor, and specially defensive Corviknight. Hatterene takes on Poison-types such as Sneasler and Okidogi as well as threatening Gastrodon and Barraskewda via Giga Drain and can free up a moveslot for Clefable to use Thunderbolt if using Mystical Fire. Tinkaton offers a Poison-type immunity, Stealth Rock support, and the removal of roadblocks like Galarian Slowking, Articuno, Hatterene, and Alolan Muk. Furthermore, Tinkaton aids in Clefable's setup via Knock Off and Encore by taking away passive healing from Pokemon like Clodsire, Alolan Muk, and Iron Treads and locking walls into moves. Choice Scarf Enamorus provides a Ground-type immunity and various anti-Steel coverage options to combat Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Heatran as well as provides Healing Wish support to give Clefable more setup opportunities late-game.</p>"

With Will-O-Wisp, Ninetales is able to weaken physical attackers such as Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Dragonite. Solar Beam allows Ninetales to threaten the likes of Gastrodon, Quagsire, Barraskewda, and Rotom-W, which all resist its Fire-type STAB attacks. With Encore, Ninetales can force out passive Pokemon to create an opportunity to freely switch out into one of its teammates, as well as lock Pokemon like Baxcalibur and Iron Defense Zamazenta into their setup moves.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Ceruledge are two of the biggest beneficiaries of Ninetales's sun, boosting their Fire-type STAB moves to great levels.

Heatran is another great teammate, as with a combination of Taunt and Magma Storm, it is able to trap and remove walls Ninetales struggles with like Toxapex.

Freeze-Dry is useful against Water teams, being able to threaten Pelipper and Quagsire out and win the weather war against rain. Moonblast is useful against the ubiquitous Fighting- and Dragon-types in the tier, as it hits Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Baxcalibur, and Kommo-o that are otherwise problems for Ice teams. Encore allows Alolan Ninetales to lock a defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex, into a weak move or a setup sweeper, such as Iron Defense Corviknight, into a stat-boosting move, letting Alolan Ninetales's teammates take care of the aforementioned Pokemon.</p> <p>Baxcalibur is an amazing teammate for Alolan Ninetales, as it is an incredibly dangerous sweeper that can run through teams after one Swords Dance or Dragon Dance, which is easily facilitated by Alolan Ninetales's snow and Aurora Veil. It also appreciates Alolan Ninetales giving it setup opportunities thanks to Encore and eliminating Quagsire thanks to Freeze-Dry. Alolan Ninetales appreciates Baxcalibur's ability to switch in on Fire-type moves and gain an Attack boost for itself, as well as run through Poison and Steel teams. Chien-Pao provides wallbreaking power or clean-up potential depending on its set while also hitting Steel-types such as Heatran, Kingambit, and Empoleon with a strong Sacred Sword. It appreciates Alolan Ninetales's ability to hit Fighting-types. Mamoswine can threaten Fire-types like Heatran and Torkoal with Earthquake, while packing Thick Fat for a pseudo-Fire neutrality. Additionally, it sets Stealth Rock, which can help Alolan Ninetales pick off weakened threats such as Baxcalibur. It also appreciates the bulk boost in snow. Cetitan is a great partner, as Slush Rush allows it to outspeed and OHKO most of the metagame after a Belly Drum boost, which is easier to acquire thanks to snow and Aurora Veil from Alolan Ninetales. Alolan Sandslash appreciates snow and Aurora Veil both bolstering its bulk and Slush Rush doubling its Speed. In exchange, Alolan Sandslash can use Rapid Spin to clear entry hazards and deal with Hatterene and Flutter Mane, which can both take advantage of Alolan Ninetales. It can also threaten Fire, Steel, and Poison teams with Earthquake. Cloyster brings a lot to the table: namely another Fire neutrality, a way to hit Fire-types such as Talonflame and Ceruledge thanks to Rock Blast and Water-type coverage, and a high Defense stat that makes it nearly unbreakable in snow. In return, Alolan Ninetales facilitates Cloyster's Shell Smash thanks to Aurora Veil and snow support. It also appreciates Alolan Ninetales locking defensive answers to Cloyster, such as Toxapex and Corviknight, into unfavorable moves. Avalugg is a defensive behemoth that, when under snow and Aurora Veil, takes on almost every physical attacker in the tier. It can also remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin to improve Alolan Ninetales's lacking longevity. Finally, Frosmoth becomes a dangerous sweeping threat under snow and Aurora Veil thanks to Quiver Dance, letting it potentially win the Ground, Flying, and Fairy matchups.</p>"

Earthquake and Iron Head allow Alolan Dugtrio to threaten commonplace Pokemon such as Carbink, Pyroar, Dachsbun, and Lycanroc-N.

Substitute, on the other hand, allows Alolan Dugtrio to take advantage of slower, more passive Pokemon, such as Vespiquen, Tinkatuff, and Carbink, in order to buffer a hit, gain momentum from a forced switch, or safely set up with Swords Dance. Sucker Punch provides insurance against Choice Scarf users and Pokemon that are naturally faster than Alolan Dugtrio, such as Basculin and Dugtrio, respectively. Swords Dance allows Alolan Dugtrio to take advantage of passive opponents and forced switches as well as break through naturally bulky Pokemon it may not have coverage for, such as Whiscash. Heavy-Duty Boots helps to provide more opportunities for Alolan Dugtrio to come in by negating entry hazards, while Life Orb provides a damage boost, which can be especially helpful if Alolan Dugtrio chooses not to run Swords Dance. Air Balloon is also a choice, making Alolan Dugtrio immune to Ground-type moves, like Dugtrio or Gabite's Earthquake, as well as providing a temporary immunity to Sticky Web and Spikes. Tera Ground allows for Alolan Dugtrio's Earthquake to deal even more damage, which is especially helpful against neutral targets like Gabite.

Due to being one of the few Steel-types available in the tier, Alolan Dugtrio's access to a strong, fast Iron Head is a quality greatly appreciated by common Fire-type wallbreakers such as Charizard, Pyroar, and Houndoom, which struggle against common Rock-types such as Carbink and Lycanroc-N. In return, Alolan Dugtrio greatly appreciates the Fire-types' ability to deal with Grass-types such as Gogoat and Thwackey, as these Grass-types resist Earthquake and also often have good matchups against the entry hazard setters it is paired with. This especially applies to Thwackey, which further reduces the damage of Alolan Dugtrio's Earthquake by setting Grassy Terrain. A teammate that can deal with Misdreavus, such as Haunter or Houndoom, is also imperative, as Misdreavus can easily cripple Alolan Dugtrio with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

        "Choice Item": {
          "description": "<p>Alongside Alolan Dugtrio's amazing typing, great Speed, and decent Attack, Choice items make it a more immediate offensive threat compared to support items such as Heavy-Duty Boots. Stone Edge is Alolan Dugtrio's best coverage option, hitting the few Pokemon that resist its STAB combination like Rotom-S and Charizard. Sucker Punch can also situationally be used alongside Choice Scarf to move before foes like Aqua Jet Basculin. Memento is good late-game, allowing Alolan Dugtrio to provide momentum and offer potential setup opportunities for teammates. Stealth Rock is a niche option on Choice Scarf sets if a team has no space for it otherwise, and, although it is a bad move to be locked into, it can also be used to fake being non-Choice Scarf. Jolly is by far the preferred nature to outspeed threats such as Basculin and Pyroar, but Adamant can be used with Choice Band to further Alolan Dugtrio's wallbreaking capabilities. Tangling Hair is situational but can punish moves such as Skuntank's Sucker Punch and Choice Scarf Sawsbuck's Horn Leech. Tera Ground and Steel power up Alolan Dugtrio's STAB moves to harder hit select targets, such as Earthquake against Whiscash and Lumineon and Iron Head against Gogoat and Misdreavus. They also offer defensive perks, such as Tera Ground making Alolan Dugtrio lose the weakness to Gabite's Earthquake and Tera Steel the weakness to Basculin's Aqua Jet. Choice Band makes Alolan Dugtrio a threatening wallbreaker, and Choice Scarf provides speed control for fast threats such as Alolan Persian, Dugtrio, and +1 Quiver Dance Masquerain. Alolan Dugtrio is notably one of the fastest Choice Scarf users, outspeeding not only other Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F and Haunter but also Speed-boosting setup move users such as Dragon Dance Charizard and Agility Wyrdeer. This also means that even without the extra Speed, Choice Band Dugtrio still makes for solid Speed control, especially alongside Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Alolan Dugtrio makes for great glue on balance and offensive teams, being flexibly able to swap Choice items based on the team's need of either a wallbreaker or speed control while also being a last resort option for roles such as Stealth Rock setter and Volt Switch immunity if need be. Due to being Choice-locked, Alolan Dugtrio is very prediction reliant, which means an incorrect prediction could allow common threats such as Dragon Dance Charizard and Bulk Up Gogoat to use it as setup fodder. Bulky teammates with utility moves can stop this from getting out of hand, such as Haze Mareanie, Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp Misdreavus, and Roar Dachsbun. Being Choice-locked will inevitably also lead to a lot of switches, and while Alolan Dugtrio's typing allows it to switch into a handful of moves such as Lycanroc's Stone Edge and Rotom-F's Volt Switch or Discharge, its common weaknesses and frailty leave it at risk of being OHKOed by attacks such as Close Combat and Blizzard. Pivots such as Alolan Persian, Raichu, and Lumineon can help take away this risk and increase Alolan Dugtrio's overall longevity. Alolan Persian and Raichu can also run Nasty Plot sets, which benefit from Alolan Dugtrio's Memento making setting up easier. Alolan Dugtrio can be paired with other Choice item users like Haunter and Basculin to create mind games as to which the wallbreaker and Choice Scarf user are while also helping one another weaken foes and clean up the match, respectively. An alternative option to Alolan Dugtrio is its Kantonian form, Dugtrio. Dugtrio's higher Speed allows it to naturally outspeed Alolan Persian and Raichu, although lack of secondary STAB makes it worse with Choice items and is overall better used as a setup sweeper or wallbreaker. Alolan Dugtrio should be used if seeking immediate power as a wallbreaker with Choice Band or reliable speed control with Choice Scarf.</p>"

Tera Fighting allows Mankey to hit as hard as possible with Close Combat in situations where an unboosted hit is insufficient.

Notably, it lives all of Meowscarada's attacks and +2 Scizor's Bullet Punch. Rock Head allows Hisuian Arcanine to freely use Head Smash and Flare Blitz without their recoil damage. Head Smash is an immensely powerful move, enabling Hisuian Arcanine to 2HKO Toxapex and defensive Landorus-T after Intimidate. Flare Blitz threatens Amoonguss, Corviknight, and Toedscruel, while breaking through Steel teams in general with ease in conjunction with Close Combat. Close Combat provides coverage for Hisuian Goodra, Ursaluna, and Heatran, while also fighting off Dark-types such as Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and non-Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott.

Garganacl is one of Hisuian Arcanine's best teammates due to its ability to force progress against Water and Steel, notably wearing down Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Quaquaval with Salt Cure. Glimmora forms a potent wallbreaking core with Hisuian Arcanine, taking on Grass and Fairy teams effectively. Furthermore, Glimmora provides entry hazard control with Mortal Spin and sets its own array of hazards to wear down Hisuian Arcanine's switch-ins. In return, Glimmora appreciates Hisuian Arcanine removing Steel-types for it so it can freely use Mortal Spin. Tyranitar provides sandstorm to help chip down opponents and improve Hisuian Arcanine's special bulk, making it trickier to shut down, as well as sets Stealth Rock and spreads paralysis with Thunder Wave to help Hisuian Arcanine outpace and OHKO faster offensive Pokemon. Kleavor provides Stealth Rock with Stone Axe and pivots into Hisuian Arcanine with U-turn, as well as provides additional support in the Steel matchup by hitting Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Heatran with either Night Slash or Close Combat. Shell Smash Drednaw is a great asset in the Water and Ground matchups due to Swift Swim and Air Balloon, heavily weakening those types for Hisuian Arcanine.

Scald serves as a spammable STAB attack that can cripple targets with burns, dissuading otherwise decent checks like Mega Tyranitar from setting up. Even foes that don't rely on physical attacks, like Latios, tend to dislike the chip from burn. Future Sight supports wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar, Buzzwole, and Enamorus in breaking through their checks such as Tangrowth and Skarmory for the former two and Mega Venusaur for the latter. It also synergizes excellently with Teleport. Slack Off serves as reliable recovery that doesn't require Slowbro to switch out. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Slowbro to avoid taking damage from entry hazards, maximizing HP regained from Regenerator, though Rocky Helmet can be held instead to punish contact move users, notably foes that run U-turn like Cinderace. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to make Slowbro as slow as possible, maximizing its odds of moving slower than opposing Teleport users. Slowbro best fits on bulky offense and balance teams looking for a reliable defensive pivot that can also generate momentum for wallbreakers. Hazard-stacking teammates like Skarmory, defensive Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Hippowdon pair up nicely with Future Sight, further putting pressure on opposing defensive cores. Many hazard-stacking teammates can also double as checks to Pokemon Slowbro struggles against, such as Clefable and Ting-Lu checking Dark-types like Hydreigon, Skarmory handling Bug- and Grass-types like Buzzwole and Tapu Bulu, and Hippowdon and Ting-Lu checking Electric-types like Iron Hands. Similarly, pivots like Scizor also check threats like Clefable while pairing nicely with Slowbro's own pivoting potential to maintain offensive momentum. If it isn't running Heavy-Duty Boots, hazard control from teammates like Hydreigon, Excadrill, and Mega Altaria is necessary.</p>"

The combination of Teleport + Future Sight lets Slowbro support its offensive teammates by providing them free entry while forcing immense pressure on a prospective switch-in. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Slowbro to switch freely in spite of any entry hazards. Tera Steel can be used in a pinch to check foes like Mega Tyranitar and Tapu Lele, letting it either cripple them with a Scald burn or use Teleport into a revenge killer. Wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta appreciate Slowbro's FuturePort to bring them in safely on foes like Ferrothorn and Garganacl and subsequently pressure their switch-ins like Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Toxapex with the impending Future Sight. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Heatran help cover threats like Tapu Koko, Volcarona, and Gholdengo, respectively; in return, Slowbro deals with Ground- and Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Urshifu-R. Corviknight, Tornadus-T, and Buzzwole cover other physical attackers such as Kartana, Meowscarada, and Weavile that Slowbro struggles with; the former two remove entry hazards with Defog in case Slowbro is forced to take a Knock Off, while the latter can make use of Future Sight to wallbreak easier.</p>"

Tera Blast lets Tera Fairy Magneton threaten Dark- and Dragon-types that check it such as Umbreon and Appletun, or it hits Ground-types that cause Magneton trouble like Whiscash and Sandaconda if it is Tera Grass. Tera Fairy flips the script on Fighting-types, like Passimian and Paldean Tauros, while Tera Grass comes with the added benefit of giving Magneton resistances to Ground- and Water-type moves, which can be useful against Sandaconda and Bruxish.</p> <p>Magneton fits well in VoltTurn cores with Pokemon such as Passimian, Scyther, and Bombirdier. Magneton can struggle against special walls such as Eelektross, Chansey, and Appletun, so Magneton appreciates teammates that can break these Pokemon, such as Passimian, Bruxish, and Mabosstiff. Magneton is liable to be chipped down over time by entry hazards due to its lack of recovery, so it appreciates Defoggers such as Drifblim, Lurantis, and Scyther. Additionally, Magneton does not like its Eviolite being removed by Knock Off, which makes Pokemon such as Umbreon and Qwilfish that can absorb Knock Off great partners. Magneton can also struggle versus Ground-types not threatened by Flash Cannon, like Camerupt and Whiscash, so Water- and Grass-types such as Vaporeon and Appletun make for helpful teammates.</p>"

Sleep Talk can be used to make Alolan Grimer a great Foongus check and sleep absorber for the team, while Memento gives sweeper teammates a chance to set up.

For its final slot, it has two major options that stand out; Poison Jab is a strong second STAB option with a 51% chance to Poison thanks to Poison Touch, allowing Alolan Muk to spread Poison more effectively, while Rest can remove status and allows it to deal with threats like Spectrier one-on-one.

Physically defensive Toxapex can handle threats such as Kleavor and Mimikyu thanks to Haze and Toxic.

Glimmora also appreciates Alolan Muk removing Heavy-Duty Boots, which makes its hazards much more threatening towards threats such as Amoonguss and Articuno, while Alolan Muk appreciates the hazard removal Glimmora brings thanks to Mortal Spin allowing it to come in safely over the course of a game and by putting Corrosion Toxic onto bulky threats such as Corviknight and Toxapex which will just absorb Alolan Muk's attacks otherwise. Corrosion Salazzle can also threaten Toxic onto the previously mentioned Alolan Muk checks along with being able to handle Steel-types like Kingambit and Heatran thanks to Substitute and Protect.

Icicle Spear targets opposing Flying-, Ground- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kilowattrel, Clodsire, and Walking Wake while breaking Focus Sash on Pokemon such as Breloom. Rock Blast benefits from Skill Link and threatens Fire-types like Ceruledge after a boost and other Ice-type Pokemon like Chien-Pao. Ice Shard is useful for revenge killing faster Choice Scarf Pokemon that are weakened like Flutter Mane, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Hydro Pump is the alternative in order to not be walled by opposing Steel-types like Kingambit and Forretress. It is also beneficial for threatening Paldean Tauros-F, which is a significant issue to Ice teams, as well as Skeledirge and Torkoal, easing the Fire matchup. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows +2 Cloyster to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Walking Wake, Hydreigon and Indeedee; a Naive nature with the remaining 4 EVs going into Special Attack should be used if opting for Hydro Pump to not reduce its damage. Skill Link is the best ability to run on Cloyster since it guarantees Icicle Spear and Rock Blast hit 5 times. White Herb is Cloyster's preferred item, as it is able to offset the Defense drops of Shell Smash, which makes Cloyster harder to revenge kill. Focus Sash is the alternative to always guarantee one turn of setup from full health, but it is less preferred since Cloyster is harder to OHKO under snow or Aurora Veil.</p> <p>Cloyster's best partner on Ice is Abomasnow. Abomasnow allows Cloyster to have an easier time to set up thanks to it setting snow, which, combined with Aurora Veil, allows it to set up on Pokemon that can usually threaten it out like offensive Great Tusk and Cinderace. Abomasnow also has Leech Seed support to improve Cloyster's longevity and handles Unaware Pokemon Quagsire and Dondozo with its STAB Giga Drain. Cloyster is able to threaten Fire's weather setter Torkoal after a boost, which benefits Abomasnow, as it can come back in to reset the weather for its teammates. Cloyster also appreciates Chien-Pao as an offensive partner, as Swords Dance sets are able to weaken its defensive checks like Toxapex, Kingambit and Rotom-W. Choice Scarf sets are also able to clean up late-game more easily thanks to Cloyster's sweeping. Baxcalibur is also one more offensive partner for Cloyster, as its ability to switch into Will-o-Wisp from Pokemon like Sableye and Rotom-W supports Cloyster's sweeping capabilities, while Cloyster offers additional support against the Dragon-types that threaten Baxcalibur like Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Hydreigon. Choice Band Baxcalibur can also wear down defensive walls like Corviknight and Skeledirge, which gives Cloyster an easier sweep. Glaceon also pairs well with Cloyster, as it can threaten defensive Water-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Dondozo with Freeze-Dry. Avalugg can support Cloyster with its Rapid Spin to remove hazards, so Cloyster can come in easier and set up. Avalugg is also able to handle Cloyster's offensive checks like Great Tusk under snow. Froslass is Ice's only viable option for Spikes, which Cloyster appreciates, as defensive Pokemon like Hatterene and Iron Hands aren't able to check it properly after a boost.</p>"

It also gets around priority attacks from Breloom, Dragapult, and Meowscarada after a Shell Smash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Blast</strong>: This is Closyer's best shot at dealing with the many Tera Fires that resist Icicle Spear, as well as OHKOing Chien-Pao, Iron Bundle, and Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drill Run</strong>: This hits Gholdengo and other Steel-types hard without needing to Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is the preferred nature to maximize offensive power, as a single Shell Smash lets you outspeed the entire unboosted metagame.

It also provides coverage against Gholdengo with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: The increased damage from Tera Ice makes it very difficult for Pokemon to wall Cloyster without resisting it, with even Corviknight getting OHKOed by +2 Adamant Icicle Spear after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Volt Switch users like Rotom-W love to take Cloyster down to its Sash and pivot to a priority attacker; Tera Ground both immunes the damage and prevents the switch, giving Cloyster significant momentum with a free turn to Shell Smash.

Focus Blast is useful for hitting Dark- and Normal-types such as Alolan Persian, Pyroar, and Komala that would switch into a Shadow Ball. Trick cripples checks it cannot immediately break through such as Chansey and Skuntank, while Energy Ball is specifically used for Whiscash, an otherwise solid midground option to scout whatever Haunter uses. Tera Ghost is the preferred option in order to boost Shadow Ball's power, lessening the need to predict against Pokemon like Assault Vest Crabominable; however, Tera Blast Ground can remove Skuntank, one of Haunter's most efficient checks.</p> <p>Despite its strong power, Haunter is slower than common wallbreakers such as Basculin, Charizard, and Alolan Dugtrio as well as being extremely fragile to anything it isn't immune to, so pivot support is necessary in order to bring it in safely. Alolan Persian is a top tier pivot that can easily bring Haunter in with Parting Shot and can switch into physical wallbreakers that threaten Haunter out like Dugtrio and Basculin. Rotom-F is also a strong pivot that synergizes well with Haunter, pivoting it in on Pokemon like Misdreavus while wearing down shared checks like Chansey and Whiscash. Ground-types like Camerupt and Whiscash can switch into the fast Electric-types that threaten Haunter out like Electrode and Raichu and set entry hazards that wear down Haunter's checks that do not run Heavy-Duty Boots like Tinkatuff and Hisuian Sliggoo.</p>"

Shadow Ball threatens Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Drifblim, Rotom, and Medicham, while Focus Blast threatens Normal- and Dark-types such as Dudunsparce, Ursaring, and Umbreon that can comfortably switch into Shadow Ball. Trick lets Haunter punish walls such as Chansey, Poison Touch Muk, and Umbreon by crippling them with a Choice Scarf. Sludge Bomb threatens Pokemon such as Appletun and Cacturne and can inflict poison on special walls like Eelektross, which pressures them throughout the match. It can also threaten various Pokemon such as Tera Fairy Umbreon and Drifblim. Nasty Plot can be run instead to give Haunter a boosting option after it has gotten rid of its Choice Scarf via Trick, threatening Pokemon such as Umbreon much more effectively. Destiny Bond can be used as a last resort to neutralize dangerous setup sweepers such as Coil Eelektross, Coil Sandaconda, and Bulk Up Ursaring as well as punish offensive threats such as Passimian, Zoroark, and Scyther that may attempt to revenge kill Haunter after it has lost its Choice Scarf. Tera Ghost is able to increase Haunter's cleaning potential by powering up Shadow Ball. Tera Fighting can be used to assist Haunter versus Pokemon such as Cacturne and Lycanroc by granting resistances to Sucker Punch and Accelerock, and it also powers up Focus Blast. Haunter has horrible bulk and cannot take even resisted hits well, so it is advised that you pair it with pivots such as Eelektross, Passimian, and Scyther. Furthermore, Haunter struggles with special walls such as Chansey, Umbreon, and Muk, so powerful physical attackers such as Passimian and Medicham can assist in solving this issue.</p>"

Gengar's movepool when running Hex sets is fairly flexible based on its team. It can spread status very well with Will-O-Wisp + Sludge Bomb, but Toxic Spikes can also let it help wear down its own future switch-ins, like Gastrodon, or Pokemon such as Scream Tail and Wo-Chien as they switch into its teammates. Focus Blast can be a good option to avoid letting Tyranitar switch in freely, while Substitute lets Gengar punish switches it forces against Pokemon like Wo-Chien to provide free turns and protect itself from revenge killers. Will-O-Wisp should preferably not be dropped to run a combination of these other moves, as it is fantastic for crippling Tinkaton and Tyranitar and can ensure an immediate status against Heavy-Duty Boots Gastrodon too. Tera Ghost lets Gengar significantly power up its Hex to pressure Pokemon like Gastrodon even more while removing its Ground weakness, but Gengar is often not a priority Terastallization user.</p> <p>This set fits best on bulkier teams that like to take their time wearing down the opposing team. Quagsire is an excellent teammate for this set, as it can threaten Tyranitar and Grafaiai while also spreading Toxic and entry hazards in order to wear down other Pokemon, such as Gastrodon and TInkaton. Teammates such as Wo-Chien and Cyclizar that can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Gastrodon, Wo-Chien, and Sandy Shocks are highly appreciated if Gengar is running Toxic Spikes. Wo-Chien can also help check Pokemon such as Greninja and Sandy Shocks for Gengar, while Cyclizar can help keep entry hazards off Gengar's side without removing its Toxic Spikes and give it switch-in opportunities against Decideueye and Slither Wing with U-turn. Gengar also appreciates defensive support against Pokemon such as Noivern, Scizor, and Talonflame, so teammates like Gastrodon and Talonflame are valuable. Offensive teammates, such as Pawmot and Tyranitar, appreciate Gengar's Toxic Spikes support to pressure checks like Hippowdon. Espeon can help check Gastrodon and deny it from setting Spikes against Gengar; it can also wear down Tinkaton, and it appreciates Toxic Spikes to prevent Pokemon like Scream Tail from checking it. Tinkaton can check Noivern, provide Stealth Rock, and use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Gastrodon and Slowbro. Sandy Shocks  can provide Spikes to help pressure switch-ins like Tinkaton, and it can offer entry points against Decideueye and Wo-Chien with Volt Switch. In return, it appreciates Gengar pressuring Gastrodon.</p>"

It can outspeed boosted threats like Polteageist, Toxtricity, Salamence, and opposing Choice Scarf users like Sandy Shocks, Pawmot, and Staraptor. Energy Ball blows away Gastrodon and Sandy Shocks while doing servicable damage to Tyranitar and Hippowdon. On the other hand, Focus Blast hits Grafaiai and Dark-types like Tyranitar and Bisharp, and it lets Gengar revenge kill foes like Tera Normal Lucario and Lycanroc-D, although Gengar likes the ability to immediately KO Gastrodon. Thunderbolt allows Gengar to nail Dragon Dance Gyarados and Booster Energy Iron Jugulis super effectively. Trick improves its matchup against defensive teams by crippling switch-ins like Tinkaton, Hippowdon, and Tera Poison Wo-Chien, as well as shutting down bulky setup sweepers like Oricorio-E. Tera Ghost amplifies Shadow Ball damage, notably 2HKOing Quagsire and OHKOing Gallade, Gardevoir, and Slowbro, while still maintaining Gengar's immunity to Lucario's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Gengar finds a place on bulky offense and offense teams. Early-game wallbreakers like Scizor, Slither Wing, Tyranitar, and Bisharp can severely weaken or overwhelm Tinkaton, Hippowdon, and Dark-types for Gengar to clean up late-game. Tyranitar and Bisharp also provide a solid defensive backbone against opposing Choice Scarf Gengar to avoid risking Speed ties, with the latter switching into Lokix and opposing Bisharp's Sucker Punch as well. In return, Gengar matches up well against offensive threats like Pawmot, Lucario, and Choice Scarf Gallade that would pose a threat to them. Offensive pivots like Sandy Shocks, Tsareena, and the aforementioned Scizor and Slither Wing can bring Gengar in safely on foes such as opposing Tsareena, Talonflame, Paldean Tauros-W, and Scream Tail, respectively. Moreover, Sandy Shocks provides entry hazards to chip down Gengar's checks, while Tsareena threatens bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon, the latter of which is especially problematic since its Sticky Hold prevents Gengar's Trick.</p>"

Gengar's ability to absorb Toxic Spikes is greatly appreciated by offensive teams especially, as they can otherwise be crippled by them. Gengar is OHKOed by most Pokemon faster than it, such as Azelf, Barraskewda, and Roaring Moon, and takes takes heavy damage from most priority moves, so defensive teammates such as Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Empoleon are appreciated, with Corviknight and Great Tusk being able to remove the entry hazards that Gengar is prone to being chipped down by.

Skill Swap, which has the added benefit of going through Substitute, renders Gengar immune to most attacks; this either forces the foe to switch no matter how much setup it has accrued, giving Gengar a free turn, or if Gengar successfully landed Mean Look first, spells its foe's doom. Toxic Spikes forces progress even in situations where it is unable to reliably trap the opponent's special switch-in, such as against Roaring Moon, and forces Defoggers like Corviknight into a catch-22: stay in to remove Toxic Spikes and risk getting trapped, or switch out and accept that entry hazards stay up. Taunt and Trick are alternatives that allow Gengar to trap and remove targets it otherwise could not like Meloetta, Mandibuzz, and Blissey but relegate it to a trap-or-bust option. Gengar pairs exceptionally well with physical pivots that get it in on slow physical walls it can scare out; if the opponent then switches to their special wall, they risk losing it to Mean Look + Skill Swap. Fast special cleaners like Azelf appreciate both Toxic Spikes and opposing special walls being trapped and removed; Azelf also appreciates Gengar's ability to lure and trap most Dark-types. Gengar is unable to reliably trap and remove Roaring Moon, so robust checks to it like Great Tusk and Intimidate Corviknight are strongly recommended.</p>"

Volt Switch lets Voltorb deal solid damage while preserving itself and capitalizing on the switches it forces with its Speed. Thunderbolt deals a stronger blow, invaluable against bulky Water-types like Mareanie, Quaxly, and Shellos, and is valuable for cleaning up weakened fast threats. Tera Blast, once Voltorb has Terastallized, gives it the heralded BoltBeam coverage and turns the tables on would-be checks like Toedscool, Mudbray, Diglett, and Wattrel. Because of Voltorb's limited coverage and the prominence of Ground-types, Voltorb often depends on Terastallization (or the threat of it) to function well in a match. Voltorb leans on a few utility options for its fourth move due to its limited movepool; Protect stops Nymble's First Impression from revenge killing it and can scout defensive Terastallizations, especially Tera Water on Toedscool. Taunt prevents setup and entry hazards from the likes of Pawniard, Surskit, and Glimmet, and Thunder Wave neutralizes setup sweepers and faster threats that Voltorb cannot OHKO. Voltorb pairs well with teammates that can switch into its Ground-type checks when it has not Terastallized. Toedscool is a natural partner thanks to its bulk, Ground resistance, and ability to remove entry hazards for Terastallized Voltorb, given its new Stealth Rock weakness. Drifloon's Ground immunity also supports Voltorb well. As a pivot, Voltorb appreciates the support of other pivots to continually put your opponent on the back foot. Nymble has a powerful STAB U-turn and often invites in Mareanie, which Voltorb can pressure. Wingull not only checks Ground-types with its dual STAB types and Ground immunity, but also appreciates Voltorb handling the bulky Water-types that check it.</p>"

Taunt shuts down recovery attempts from checks like Gogoat, setup attempts from Pokemon like Rotom-F, and entry hazards from foes like Carbink and Tinkatuff. The move pairs well with Electrode's nature as a pivot, giving partners an easier time setting up without dealing with annoying status. Due to Electrode's relative fragility and the prevalence of entry hazards, Aftermath is more effective at punishing priority users like Alolan Dugtrio and Basculin, as they are much more afraid of the guaranteed chip damage when revenge killing Electrode than the potential paralysis that Static provides. Tera Blast Fighting is an solid option that lets Electrode revenge kill Alolan Dugtrio, Houndoom, and Rotom-F as well as dent walls like Hisuian Sliggoo and Dunsparce. Tera Blast Ice is very useful for hitting Ground- and Grass-types like Gabite and Gogoat, although its inability to OHKO Whiscash does hinder its viability. Tera Water increases Electrode's revenge killing capability against Fire-types like Charizard and Pyroar, as well as Alolan Dugtrio; however, it also leaves it susceptible to Electric-types like Raichu and opposing Electrode in the one-on-one matchup. Lastly, Tera Grass is useful for hitting Whiscash, Carbink, and Klawf all in the same slot, something no other Tera type allows Electrode to do, while Tera Ground is also an option to specifically hit Raichu.</p> <p>Electrode fits best with strong mid-game wallbreakers that struggle to get in, such as Zangoose and Basculin. Not only do they enjoy the free turn on Pokemon such as Gogoat and Carbink, they can also break down shared checks such as Gabite, making it easier for Electrode to win late-game. Whiscash is a major annoyance for Electrode, as it is immune to Taunt and is the only viable Ground-type to not take super effective damage from either of Electrode's common Tera types; thus, a strong Grass-type like Gogoat or Sawsbuck is recommended as a partner. They can also potentially force Whiscash to Terastallize, removing its Electric immunity for Electrode. Other fast Pokemon like Alolan Persian and Rotom-F can form a VoltTurn core with Electrode, utilizing entry hazards and a good Speed tier to pivot into each other's checks, such as Flapple, Skuntank, and Misdreavus, racking up chip damage.

Thunder is gives Electrode a powerful, accurate STAB move in rain.

Other Water-types such as Basculin and Wugtrio enjoy having their Water-moves boosted as well. Masquerain is a particularly notable partner, as it has its Hurricane made 100% accurate, it can set up on foes it could normally not set up on outside of rain, such as Pyroar and Camerupt and has its Water-type coverage boosted as well, letting it chip foes like Carbink harder. Electric-types such as Raichu and Rotom-F enjoy being able to use a 100% accurate Thunder and can offensively check the opposing Water-types that would want to take advantage of rain, such as Basculin.

          "description": "<p>Galarian Weezing finds itself serving a key role on Poison thanks to its high physical bulk, wonderful support moves, and, most critically, Levitate giving it a critical Ground immunity to deal with both offensive and defensive Ground-types, such as Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Mamoswine, without much worry. Its secondary Fairy typing is also a major boon for Poison, making it immune to Dragon, which gives it utility in absorbing high powered Dragon moves like Glaive Rush from Baxcalibur and completely checking Garchomp. It also provides a helpful resistance to Dark, giving it added bulk against Dark-types like Alolan Muk and Meowscarada. Strange Steam is used for its STAB attack, dealing solid damage and threatening Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-types such as Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Roaring Moon. Defog is incredibly valuable, being the only consistent form of entry hazard removal on Poison, which Galarian Weezing can easily switch in and use thanks to its immunity to Spikes and neutrality to Stealth Rock This also allows it to run Black Sludge to further increase its longevity. Pain Split acts as a form of recovery and offensive pressure, allowing it to drain away health from opposing walls such as Toxapex and Gliscor while healing itself back up. Will-O-Wisp threatens physical attackers from those that it walls like Great Tusk and Dragonite and impairs others that do threaten it like Iron Treads and Corviknight, making them much easier to handle.</p> <p>Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking are amazing teammates for Galarian Weezing that cover Galarian Weezing's biggest weakness: low Special Defense. As specially bulky tanks, they can switch into strong special attacks, such as Choice Specs Greninja's Extrasensory, while majorly appreciating Defog from Galarian Weezing to maximize their longevity. Alolan Muk handles Psychic- and Ghost-type attacks from foes like Flutter Mane, Spectrier, and Espathra with ease thanks to its Dark typing and STAB Knock Off. Meanwhile, Galarian Slowking can soak up hits from Heatran, Regieleki, and Volcarona while responding back with its myriad of coverage, as well as create traps with Future Sight, which Galarian Weezing can exploit with Strange Steam or use as a chance to Defog safely. Toxapex's Water typing allows it to switch into and wall the many Steel-types of the tier like Scizor, Tinkaton, and Empoleon. It also handles other powerful threats such as Chien-Pao and Ceruledge, using Haze to stop their setup and Infestation or Surf to do damage. Toxapex is also a valuable Knock Off absorber in the Dragon, Dark, and Ice matchups, preventing Galarian Weezing from losing its Black Sludge from foes such as Cyclizar, Sableye, and Alolan Sandslash. Amoonguss appreciates Galarian Weezing taking the stress off it in the Ground matchup and allowing for it to have a much easier time taking on threats, such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Mamoswine, after they have been burned. Amoonguss is also able to handle threats to Galarian Weezing like Gastrodon and Sandy Shocks. Thanks to Defog allowing Salazzle safe entry, it can threaten every Steel-type in the tier with a mix of its STAB Flamethrower and Toxic thanks to Corrosion, which puts Steel-types that try to threaten it, such as Heatran and Hisuian Goodra, on timers, and it means Galarian Weezing won't have to worry about them late-game. Glimmora can be used instead of Salazzle, as it also can use Toxic thanks to Corrosion, has Earth Power to hit Heatran, has Energy Ball to help out against Ground-types, such as Great Tusk and Gastrodon, and if its Air Balloon is still intact, it can inflict Toxic onto Clodsire with no fear. With Defog support, Choice Scarf Sneasler can come onto the field safely and fire off strong its strong STAB Close Combat and Dire Claw against threats like Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Enamorus. Okidogi also works well as a Fighting-type that majorly appreciates burn being spread to have an easier time setting up before tearing into threats like Kingambit and Heatran with its STAB moves. Defog support will also allow safe entry for Iron Moth, which melts Steel-types with its powerful Fire-type STAB attacks, such as Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Corviknight, as well as being able to eradicate Landorus if using Choice Specs with Overheat. Gengar is another solid Choice Specs user that can scare out Skeledirge, which otherwise uses Galarian Weezing for setup and can also deal with Landorus with Icy Wind.</p>"

Chansey quickly falls against physical attackers, so physical walls like Avalugg, Sableye, and Sandaconda make for great teammates. Because Chansey is forced to run Eviolite, it requires hazard control from the likes of Avalugg and Braviary. Common switch-ins to Trick and Knock Off like Sandaconda and Sticky Hold Muk are also greatly appreciated against Pokemon like Sableye, Mesprit, and Bombirdier, as Chansey requires its Eviolite. Setup sweepers like Mesprit and Hisuian Sneasel tend to overwhelm Chansey, so Pokemon like Sableye and Choice Scarf Ditto make for amazing partners.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its gargantuan Eviolite-boosted special bulk alongside a lack of relevant weaknesses, Chansey stands firmly as a formidable wall that blanket checks the metagame's special attackers, including Dragapult, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona. Toxic lets Chansey whittle them down, especially in conjunction with repeated Seismic Tosses, while Thunder Wave punishes poison-immune foes like Heatran and Toxapex and cripples switch-ins such as Mega Lopunny and Kingambit. Chansey can provide cleric support with Aromatherapy, especially since it can switch into status users like Clodsire and Rotom-W thanks to Natural Cure. However, Stealth Rock can be used if the team lacks another user, and Chansey can do it sufficiently by outlasting common entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T. Tera Steel allows it to reliably check Tapu Lele, Hatterene, and Tornadus-T, and it prevents Chansey from being poisoned. Chansey is generally reserved for bulkier builds that appreciate its defensive profile and can tolerate its overall passivity. Sturdy walls like Skeledirge, Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Corviknight can cover physical attackers like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Kartana for Chansey. Skeledirge's Unaware helps against setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Mega Charizard X that attempt to use Chansey as setup fodder, while Corviknight's Defog alleviates Chansey from entry hazard pressure that would overwhelm it easily. Knock Off and Trick absorbers like Clefable, Toxapex, Mega Scizor, and Gholdengo make sure that Chansey can keep its valuable Eviolite; Additionally, Mega Scizor helps deal with Psyshock Tapu Lele, Gholdengo threatens Calm Mind Hatterene, and Calm Mind Clefable overwhelms Heatran—especially if it's paralyzed—all of which are special attackers that can beat Chansey one-on-one.</p>"

This provides a myriad of benefits, including blanket checking most Pokemon, scouting sets, and PP stalling less threatening foes. While Eviolite is usually the best item, Covert Cloak is useful against Mortal Spin and Spirit Shackle users. The given moves offer the most utility in the rare situations Chansey is not transformed, like pivoting, acting as a cleric, and improofing special attackers. Offensive threats such as Mega Diancie appreciate the information Imposter Chansey provides through scouting, with special attackers also appreciating Imposter Chansey taking advantage of RegenVest users and potentially acting as an Imposter-proof. Imposter Chansey appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon like Mega Steelix and Mega Swampert for safe scouting; these Pokemon can also provide Knock Off support, aiding against Judgment and Covert Cloak users that can otherwise defeat Imposter Chansey.</p>"

These pivots can threaten physical walls like Sandaconda, Qwilfish, and Orthworm; in return, Scyther can pressure special walls like Goodra and Assault Vest Hariyama.

Close Combat hits Steel- and Rock-types like Orthworm and Coalossal for super effective damage. Alternatively, U-turn lets Scyther pivot against physical walls like Sandaconda and Gligar, as well as Pokemon that resist Dual Wingbeat like Orthworm and Copperajah. Quick Attack lets Scyther OHKO faster foes like Jolteon and Salazzle after it Terastallizes and boosts with Swords Dance. Tera Grass removes Scyther’s 4x weakness to Stealth Rock and allows Scyther to 2HKO Sandaconda with +2 Trailblaze, while Tera Flying strengthens its Dual Wingbeat to frightening levels and makes non-resistant foes easy to get by.</p> <p>Swords Dance Scyther is best used mid- to late-game, where it has a better chance of picking off sufficiently weakened physical walls like Gligar and Sandaconda. If U-turn is selected, VoltTurn pivots like Rotom-C, Jolteon, and Mesprit are excellent teammates, threatening out walls like Sandaconda and Qwilfish while providing additional utility or coverage. Revenge killers like Tauros and Choice Scarf Rotom-C can preemptively cause Scyther to Terastalize or stop its sweep altogether, so specific checks to them like Sandaconda and Goodra, respectively, can help preserve Scyther's longevity. Special wallbreakers like Goodra, Hoopa, and Salazzle can remove physical walls so Scyther can find better chances to sweep late-game.</p>"

Mega Gyarados appreciates dual screen support from Tapu Koko, which allows it to set up more easily. In return, Mega Gyarados can pivot into Ground-type attacks from foes such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Mega Gyarados struggles against physical walls such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Buzzwole, so it appreciates teammates such as Volcarona and Iron Valiant handling them. Entry hazard support from teammates such as Landorus-T and Glimmora helps weaken defensive foes such as Tangrowth and Tera Water Landorus-T for Mega Gyarados. Teammates such as Dragonite also appreciate Mega Gyarados weakening defensive foes such as Skeledirge and Ferrothorn so it can clean late-game.</p>"

Ditto's presence alone scares off sweepers like Baxcalibur and Azumarill from setting up. Ditto does not copy the enemy HP stat, so 248 HP EVs are used to minimize damage taken from entry hazards before transforming while maximizing Ditto's HP stat, as well as allowing Ditto to use Struggle 4 times before it faints. 252 Defense EVs minimize the damage Ditto takes from opposing Ditto in the extremely rare mirror matchup. Finally, a Relaxed nature coupled with 0 Speed IVs guarantees that Imposter will never activate first, which ensures that Ditto will have more Transform PP in the aforementioned mirror match.</p> <p>Ursaluna is a great teammate for Ditto, as it can switch into walls and begin applying immediate pressure. Ditto also appreciates Ursaluna's unrivaled ability to punch holes in the opposing team, making a late-game Ditto sweep much easier. If Ditto copies certain targets like Chien-Pao and a majority of the opposing team is weakened, Ditto can win the game. Indeedee is a good teammate for Ditto, as its Psychic Surge ability prevents Ditto from being picked off by priority moves. Blissey is a nice partner for Ditto, as it can absorb status moves that would otherwise cripple Ditto and then shrug them off via Natural Cure. Blissey can also use Thunder Wave to slow down opposing Choice Scarf users that would otherwise Speed tie with Ditto such as Meowscarada and Enamorus Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a powerful teammate that pairs well with Ditto, as Ditto can copy the stat boosts from setup sweepers that aim to take advantage of a Choice-locked Hisuian Zoroark. Cyclizar can be used to remove entry hazards so that Ditto can switch in frequently without getting chipped. Additionally, it is able to keep hazards away and use Shed Tail to bring Ditto in behind a Substitute and make it even more threatening. Maushold can use its high speed tier to lock Bulk Up users like Landorus-Therian that would otherwise be able to stall out Ditto. Additionally, Maushold is able to break down walls due to the sheer power of Population Bomb. Pivots are great teammates for Ditto because they can lure in targets for Ditto to copy. Choice Scarf Staraptor and Defensive Braviary are solid picks, as they can use U-turn to go right into Ditto. Braviary is also capable of using Defog to keep Ditto alive for longer.</p>"

Reversing the momentum of fast offensive threats such as Iron Valiant, Mega Charizard X, and Excadrill allows Ditto to force counterplay against offensive teams. Ditto can also take advantage of entry hazard setters and removers, such as Ferrothorn, Kleavor, and Zapdos, using their own longevity or utility against them. In order to take advantage of Pokémon that use either Return or Frustration, such as Mega Altaria or Mega Pinsir, Ditto likes to run 128 Happiness instead of 252 or 0. Walls like Blissey and Porygon2 appreciate Ditto being able to prevent threats such as Baxcalibur and Spectrier from using them as setup fodder, while Ditto appreciates both defensive switch-ins and slow pivots via their use of Teleport. Mega Lopunny is a staple on Normal teams that accents Ditto's role expertly; many of the offensive threats and setup sweepers that revenge kill Mega Lopunny, such as Mega Charizard X, Kommo-o, and Galarian Moltres, are usually very weak to their own sets or coverage. Mega Lopunny can lure a threat in and pivot with U-turn, allowing Ditto to come in safely and transform. Ditto appreciates Mega Lopunny's Speed tier and fast pivot with U-turn, as well as potentially setting up Ditto with Encore Sets to stop foes from using Substitute or setting up completely. Hisuian Zoroark makes for another stellar teammate for Ditto, as Hisuian Zoroark disguised as a passive Pokemon, such as Blissey, or another offensive threat, such as Diggersby or Mega Lopunny, can lead to Hisuian Zoroark wallbreaking and netting KOs on vital foes, making it easier for Ditto to sweep once it has transformed. While Ditto is immune to Sticky Web, it is susceptible to other hazards such as Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, so forms of hazard control such as Staraptor or Cyclizar are appreciated. Staraptor is another defensive option, while Cyclizar can enable Ditto to utilize Transform with a Substitute from Shed Tail. Smeargle on more offense-oriented teams' pairs well with Ditto, as Smeargle can set hazards with Stone Axe or Ceaseless Edge and spread status with Nuzzle, Mortal Spin, or Spore, allowing Ditto to exploit the opposing team easier. Smeargle will usually give up Sticky Web when paired with Ditto so as to not hinder Ditto's revenge killing prowess.</p>"

Earthquake provides Mega Aerodactyl with perfect neutral coverage, hitting Rock-resistant Pokemon as well as targets that are weak to it, such as Tyranitar, Zeraora, and Bisharp, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to threaten them. Dual Wingbeat provides a secondary STAB option that ensures Mega Aerodactyl hits important targets such as Buzzwole, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss super effectively. Taunt can be used instead to deny the likes of bulkier targets, such as Clefable, Skarmory, and Hippowdon, from accessing their healing moves, on top of shutting down setup options from specific setup sweepers, such as Mega Latias. Mega Aerodactyl can even serve as an effective Pursuit trapper; with the Tough Claws boost, it makes for an effective option to use against the likes of Iron Moth, Latios, and Alakazam. Roost is mandatory in the last slot to offset Mega Aerodactyl's Stealth Rock weakness while also allowing it to repeatedly switch into foes such as Cinderace and Iron Moth, resisting most of their attacks in the process. Mega Aerodactyl fits best on bulky offense and balance teams in need of an offensive backbone with solid secondary defensive applications. Bulkier Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Clefable, and Rotom-W appreciate Mega Aerodactyl's ability to relieve pressure in dealing with offensive threats which they may be overwhelmed by, such as Cinderace and Enamorus. In return, the former two provide hazard support to help Mega Aerodactyl secure damage rolls against Pokemon it would otherwise miss out on, such as against Autotomize Celesteela with Stone Edge and Mega Tyranitar with Earthquake, whereas the latter provides additional pivoting support, hazard removal in Defog to offset Mega Aerodactyl’s weakness to Stealth Rock, and the ability to take on several setup sweepers which it struggles to take on, such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Swords Dance Scizor. Similarly, other Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, such as Excadrill and Mandibuzz, are effective at ensuring Mega Aerodactyl isn’t being dug into by Stealth Rock. On the other hand, offensive Pokemon such as Choice Band Galarian Zapdos, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Tapu Bulu can benefit from Mega Aerodactyl's ability to check or remove faster Pokemon which they may be dissuaded by, such as Iron Moth, Cinderace, and Keldeo. Mega Aerodactyl's ability to force in defensive Pokemon can also lead to some interesting synergies with other offensive Pokemon, particularly when carrying Taunt; setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Enamorus, Bulk Up Buzzwole, and Swords Dance Iron Hands each benefit from Mega Aerodactyl's ability to lure in and weaken walls such as Skarmory, Tapu Fini, Slowbro, and Mega Venusaur.</p>"

It particularly preys on faster teams that over-rely on using faster speed control options to check most sweepers, such as Choice Scarf users Galarian Zapdos and Keldeo. Earthquake nails several Ground-weak targets in Excadrill, Tyranitar, and Bisharp after a Dragon Dance, OHKOing the latter. Dual Wingbeat, especially with the boost from Tough Claws, flattens many neutral targets after a Dragon Dance, such as Clefable, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Mega Latias, while also allowing it to beat walls such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth. Alternatively, Mega Aerodactyl can run Roost in the last slot to offset its lack of longevity, potentially grabbing multiple setup opportunities against weaker Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Clefable lacking Thunder Wave. Due to its offensive prowess, this Mega Aerodactyl set fits best on fast-paced teams as an effective mid-to-late game cleaner. Early-game wallbreakers such as Ceruledge and Iron Hands can help Mega Aerodactyl by opening up gaps in the opposition through their numerous offensive applications against walls which the latter may find itself being stopped by, such as Slowbro, Scizor, and Iron Defense Skarmory. Conversely, Mega Aerodactyl’s tendency to find opportunities against specific targets such as Ting-Lu and Mega Venusaur can also work to the benefit of other late-game cleaners, such as Booster Energy Iron Moth and Weakness Policy Latios. As Mega Aerodactyl often finds itself leveraging its bulk to make the most of its setup capabilities, teammates that can prevent entry hazards from going up, such as Taunt Mew, Excadrill, and Tapu Fini, make for excellent partners. Mega Aerodactyl also benefits from entry hazard support provided by the former two, as well as others like Spikes Sandy Shocks, which help it secure OHKOs against Pokemon such as Hydreigon after a Dragon Dance.</p>"

U-turn lets Articuno pivot on incoming Ice-resistant foes like Magneton and Cryogonal while also generating momentum for offensive teammates on the switches Articuno can force against the bevy of Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-types in the tier. The given EV spread allows Articuno to outspeed maximum Speed Cacturne and Ursaring while maintaining as much special bulk as possible. Tera Ground gifts an Electric-type immunity, letting Articuno easily handle Rotom and Eelektross, and it gets a Stealth Rock resistance, which helps Articuno if it gets hit by a Knock Off; Tera Steel helps against setup sweepers such as Mesprit, Lilligant, and Farigiraf so that Articuno can use Haze without fear of being OHKOed; and Tera Fairy can be used to take care of Fighting-types which overwhelm it otherwise with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p>Articuno easily falters in the face of physical wallbreakers like Mabosstiff, Medicham, and Tauros, so Pokemon like Sandaconda, Sableye, and Mesprit to check them pair well with Articuno as they love a partner to tank special attacks.

Item displacement from Knock Off or Trick is very detrimental for Articuno’s longevity. To combat this, Knock Off absorbers like Sandaconda and Sticky Hold Muk work well to help it. Entry hazard support from Hattrem, Drifblim, and Lurantis also helps Articuno if it happens to lose its item. Wallbreakers such as Samurott, Bruxish, and Pyroar work well alongside Articuno, as it can take care of their checks like Cacturne, Appletun, and Qwilfish. Because Articuno beats Ground- and Grass-types, Electric-types pair well as partners, as they can create a VoltTurn core and whittle down each other’s checks.</p>"

Freeze-Dry is the only offensive move Articuno needs, pressuring many crucial targets throughout the metagame such as both Landorus formes, Toxapex, Quagsire, Ogerpon-W, Manaphy, and Enamorus. Aside from hitting Water-types for super effective damage, Freeze-Dry is also particularly useful on this relatively passive set due to its high 32 PP. This allows Articuno to stay threatening over longer games despite only using one attacking move as well as repeatedly fish for freezes against neutral targets such as Hatterene and Galarian Weezing. Substitute blocks Toxic from Toxapex, Quagsire, Clodsire, and Mandibuzz, allowing Articuno to duel these Pokemon and come out on top. Furthermore, Substitute combined with Roost and Pressure allows Articuno to stall out foes such as Frosmoth and Ursaluna-B, draining their PP so Articuno’s teammates can come in and take advantage of them. As an alternative to Substitute, U-turn can be used to make Articuno less passive and safely bring in teammates against faster foes, which is especially beneficial for teammates such as Choice Band Dragonite and Galarian Moltres. Haze rounds out this set by preventing Articuno from becoming setup fodder against foes such as Sinistcha, Ursaluna-B, Manaphy, and Hatterene. Furthermore, Haze can be used to neutralize Belly Drum Azumarill’s boosts, as with these EVs Articuno will always outspeed it and survive a +6 Aqua Jet from full HP. The given EVs allow Articuno to outrun uninvested Landorus-T, Adamant Torterra, and maximum Speed Azumarill while maximizing special bulk.</p> <p>Gliscor is an excellent partner to Articuno, nullifying Electric-type attacks and Toxic aimed at Articuno, absorbing Knock Off to prevent the removal of Articuno’s Heavy-Duty Boots, and threatening Steel-types such as Heatran and Hisuian Goodra with its STAB Earthquake. In exchange, Gliscor appreciates Articuno taking Ice Beam from threats such as Greninja and handling Water-types such as Walking Wake and Manaphy. Alternatively, physically defensive Landorus-T complements Articuno by threatening Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Kleavor and absorbing Electric-type hits while forming a defensive core with it. Landorus-T similarly appreciates Articuno taking on foes such as Frosmoth and Ogerpon-W while being offensively threatening against Steel- and Fire-types that wall Articuno such as Empoleon, Ceruledge, and Hisuian Arcanine. Physically defensive Corviknight is another teammate that forms a defensive core with Articuno, serving as a check to many physical sweepers that would otherwise take advantage of it, such as Scizor, Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit, especially if running Iron Defense. Moreover, Corviknight can block Toxic aimed at Articuno and clear Stealth Rock using Defog in the event that Articuno has its item removed. In return, Articuno can deal with various special threats that would threaten or take advantage of Corviknight, such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Manaphy, and Slowbro. The combination of Articuno, Corviknight, and specially defensive Gliscor also allows Flying to safely handle all standard variants of Flutter Mane, which is of great use due to how threatening this Pokemon can be to Flying teams if left unchecked. Moltres pairs nicely with Articuno, checking various physical threats such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Ogerpon-H, while Articuno answers Water-types for it. Zapdos and Thundurus-T can take out barriers to Articuno such as Empoleon and Corviknight with their Electric-type STAB moves; physically defensive Zapdos using Heat Wave can also answer Iron Treads and compounds nicely with Articuno’s special walling capabilities and neutrality to Ice. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Galarian Moltres, and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T enjoy Articuno removing impediments to their sweeping such as Quagsire, Clodsire, Slowbro, and Amoonguss. Choice Scarf Enamorus supports Articuno by revenge killing foes such as Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and both Urshifu formes, and can use Healing Wish to cure Articuno’s status condition and bring it back to full HP in a pinch. Galarian Zapdos is an alternative Choice Scarf user that also hits the aforementioned targets while lacking a Stealth Rock weakness, possessing the ability to pivot with U-turn, and being more useful against types such as Bug. Physically defensive Gyarados can also aid Articuno by serving as a response to sweepers like Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Dragonite; to return the favor, Articuno deals with Quagsire and Clodsire. It should be noted that this is by no means an exhaustive list of potential teammates for Articuno, as virtually every Flying option appreciates it soaking up Ice Beams and walling special threats.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Zapdos is a potent wallbreaker for Electric teams, being able to threaten Pokemon that give its teammates a hard time such as Great Tusk, Gastrodon, specially defensive Iron Treads, and Landorus-T. Aside from that, its Flying typing provides Electric teams an immunity to Ground and a resistance to Fighting. Hurricane is Zapdos's strongest STAB move, being able to OHKO Sableye, Amoonguss, and possibly Quagsire, and also being able to 2HKO physically defensive Skeledirge and Ursaluna. Zapdos can also take advantage of matchups against rain teams by being able to spam Hurricane without fear of missing. Volt Switch allows Zapdos to bring in teammates safely against special walls like Assault Vest Iron Hands, Assault Vest Galarian Slowking, and Heatran. Heat Wave provides Zapdos great coverage, allowing it to 2HKO Magnezone, as well as Klefki under Light Screen and Iron Treads. Static has a chance to paralyze Pokemon that make contact with Zapdos such as Dragonite and Mimikyu.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks makes for a great partner, being able to provide entry hazard support with both Stealth Rock and Spikes, as well as being able to threaten Heatran with Earth Power. Regieleki is another great partner, as it is able to remove hazards with Rapid Spin so that Zapdos can switch in more often without losing a good amount of its health to Stealth Rock. It is also able to outspeed Pokemon that outspeed Zapdos such as Flutter Mane and non-Choice Scarf Greninja. Pokemon with great special bulk such as Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Tyranitar can be tough for Zapdos, with the latter being able to threaten it with Stone Edge. Hence, Iron Hands pairs well with Zapdos, as it is able to threaten Galarian Slowking with Earthquake and Tyranitar with Drain Punch. In return, Zapdos can switch into anticipated Ground-type attacks from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Magnezone is another great partner, being able to threaten Hatterene and Flutter Mane, as well as potentially winning the Chien-Pao matchup. Lastly, Zapdos's wallbreaking opens up sweeping opportunities for fast sweepers such as Nasty Plot Rotom-W and Choice Scarf Pawmot. Both of them can beat Landorus-T with Hydro Pump and Ice Punch, respectively, and Pawmot has the added merit of potentially reviving Zapdos with Revival Blessing.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Leveraging an incredible ability in Static accompanied by a powerful Volt Switch and Hurricane, Zapdos serves as a stellar defensive pivot. Zapdos effectively switches into physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, Kartana, and Great Tusk, discouraging them from attacking by threatening a chance of paralysis. Zapdos can Volt Switch out as it pleases because of common Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and the aforementioned Great Tusk fearing its powerful Hurricane. Hidden Power Ice can be used to threaten Ground-types like the aforementioned Landorus-T and Garchomp while additionally hitting Gliscor harder and much more reliably than Hurricane. Carrying Heat Wave is recommended with Hidden Power Ice to maintain the ability to OHKO Kartana. These positive matchups into many Ground-types allow Zapdos to serve as a solid Defog user, but it struggles to beat bulkier Stealth Rock users such as Heatran, Mega Tyranitar, and Clodsire. Alternatively, Zapdos can forgo Defog for Heat Wave, allowing it to threaten Pokemon such as Kingambit, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Gholdengo. Tera Steel is utilized by Zapdos to flip its Rock- and Ice-type weaknesses versus Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar, Weavile, and Mega Diancie as well as check Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele in a pinch. However, it becomes weak to common Ground- and Fighting-type moves from Pokemon it wants to check. Tera Dragon is a alternative option to check Ogerpon-W and Urshifu-R in a pinch, and allow Zapdos to pivot or land a Hurricane on the aforementioned two. Teammates that appreciate the spread of paralysis, such as Mega Medicham, Urshifu-R, and Weavile, naturally pair well with Zapdos. Mega Medicham particularly pairs nicely with it, as Mega Medicham threatens Clodsire while enjoying Zapdos pivoting it into favorable matchups such as Heatran, with Zapdos punishing Tornadus-T and Mega Lopunny looking to revenge kill Mega Medicham in return. Pursuit users like Kingambit and the aforementioned Weavile are useful teammates to assist in chipping down Clodsire as well as punishing Dragapult. Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Mega Tyranitar threaten Zapdos, so teammates that mitigate these weaknesses, like Hippowdon and Gastrodon, are appreciated.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Zapdos serves as a powerful wallbreaker while also sporting solid bulk in conjunction with Static to threaten common revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. In rain, it becomes even stronger, boasting a Water-type Weather Ball to threaten Gliscor, Garganacl, and Landorus-T and more accurate Thunder and Hurricane. Volt Switch allows Zapdos to freely pivot while doing very good damage, especially due to common Ground-types like Landorus-T and Great Tusk being greatly threatened by Hurricane. Hidden Power Ice allows Zapdos to hit Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor for massive damage. Heat Wave is used to surprise Ferrothorn trying to come in on a Thunderbolt or Hurricane as well as consistently threaten Mega Scizor. Flyinium Z allows Zapdos to KO chipped defensive Pokemon that would otherwise be out of range of a Hurricane. If Zapdos is not using Flyinium Z, then it can Tera Flying for stronger Hurricanes. Pokemon like Iron Boulder appreciate offensive Zapdos, as it can rack up chip damage on Pokemon that would otherwise annoy Iron Boulder, such as Garganacl, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn. For rain teams, Zapdos can do good chunks of damage to Pokemon rain teams would otherwise struggle to break, such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn. Galarian Slowking can comfortably take any of Zapdos's moves, and then set up a Future Sight, threaten to poison with Sludge Bomb, or pivot out into an offensive check with Chilly Reception. However, if Galarian Slowking is predicted to switch in, then Volt Switch can be used to gain momentum, allowing Zapdos to switch into something that can threatens Galarian Slowking like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, or Gliscor. Bulky Pokemon that resist one of Zapdos's STAB moves and then threaten Zapdos, like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, can prove to be annoying. To help with this, Zapdos appreciates having teammates such as Gliscor and Ferrothorn.</p>"

Heat Wave is an option over Hurricane to hit Iron Treads and Volt Absorb Corviknight while 2HKOing non-Well-Baked Body Kingambit. U-turn allows Zapdos to switch in on the aforementioned physical threats and pivot out to a wallbreaker that threatens them. Intimidate is an option to weaken hits even after Zapdos switches out and also allow it to act as a check to Fire-types like Cinderace and Ceruledge. 108 Speed EVs notably allow it to outspeed Timid Volcanion and Adamant Slither Wing. Zapdos's inability to check Ice-types like Mamoswine and Chien-Pao and tendency to get worn down quickly makes other physical walls like Corviknight and Quaquaval great partners that can additionally switch into Knock Off from the likes of Great Tusk and Roaring Moon. Wallbreakers and pivots like Ogerpon-C, Azelf, and Barraskewda appreciate Zapdos's ability to switch into revenge killers like Roaring Moon, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and opposing Barraskewda and pivot out, generating momentum for the team.

Pivots such as Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Meowscarada form a strong pivoting core with Zapdos, as Zapdos baits in Hisuian Goodra and Volt Absorb Empoleon allowing for free switch-in opportunities for these allies. Physical wallbreakers such as Great Tusk and Barraskewda are notable partners for Zapdos, as Zapdos threatens out Corviknight and Kommo-o while pivoting these teammates into Zapdos's checks such as Hisuian Goodra and Heatran, putting the opponent in a unfavorable position. Slow wallbreakers such as Great Tusk and Ceruledge benefit from Zapdos using Zap Cannon to paralyze opposing Pokemon. Slow pivots such as Corviknight switch in on strong offensive threats that Zapdos is scared of such as Ogerpon-C and Chien-Pao while providing Zapdos switch-in opportunities via U-turn.

Heat Wave beats Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Iron Treads, and Ferrothorn, thus making it an incredible asset in the Steel and Grass matchups. Hidden Power Ice cleanly OHKOes Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp; alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be used if reliably eliminating Gastrodon and Swampert is more important. Volt Switch lets Zapdos switch out of its checks like Tyranitar and Blissey, keeping momentum in favor of Zapdos's team. As dangerous as Zapdos is, it is highly susceptible to Stealth Rock; hence, Rotom-W is a great partner that can use Defog while also helping Zapdos beat Ground-types thanks to Hydro Pump. Iron Hands and Zeraora help Zapdos wallbreak by wearing down special walls like Heatran, Blissey, and Clodsire. Regieleki and Alolan Raichu can take advantage of Zapdos weakening teams and removing Ground-types so that they can clean up with their deadly Rising Voltage later in the game.</p>"

Close Combat threatens a huge amount of the tier, such as staples like Mega Tyranitar and Excadrill, and Brave Bird allows Galarian Zapdos to hit defensive staples such as Buzzwole and Clefable that resist Close Combat. U-turn allows Galarian Zapdos to maintain momentum and slam Pokemon like Slowbro that can stomach both Brave Bird and Close Combat. Knock Off hits Ghost-types like Hisuian Zoroark and is also a move that can be spammed in the early game to force progress by removing Leftovers or Rocky Helmet. Defiant is a great offensive ability that allows Galarian Zapdos to punish Defog attempts from Tapu Fini and Skarmory, as well as prevent Salamence from effectively neutering it with Intimidate. Despite Galarian Zapdos's decent typing, which allows it to switch into Earthquake from Excadrill and Knock Off from Mega Tyranitar, it can struggle to switch in against the Psychic- and Fairy-type moves thrown out by Slowbro and Enamorus. Therefore, Steel-type teammates such as Excadrill, Bisharp, and Celesteela are appreciated to help take hits from these foes, and Galarian Zapdos can switch into and pressure threats such as opposing Excadrill and Buzzwole for them. Additionally, Galarian Zapdos can wallbreak for the former two, which can allow for them to sweep after shared checks like Skarmory are removed.

Bulk Up allows Galarian Zapdos to break through physical walls such as Skarmory and Hippowdon after a boost. Brave Bird slams the Fighting resists looking to switch into Galarian Zapdos, such as Buzzwole and Slowbro, and with Flyinium Z, it becomes an incredibly powerful Supersonic Skystrike that obliterates neutral targets like Clefable and Tapu Fini and prevents the recoil damage of Brave Bird. Thunderous Kick is a great STAB move that lowers the Defense of the target, which can allow Galarian Zapdos to beat defensive Pokemon with Unaware like Quagsire and otherwise force many switches. Alongside Leftovers, it notably allows Galarian Zapdos to beat Iron Defense Skarmory. Close Combat provides more immediate power at the cost of a worse matchup into Quagsire and Iron Defense Skarmory. Substitute allows Galarian Zapdos to set up on bulky foes looking to neuter it with status, such as Hippowdon and Mega Sableye. It can also scout switches against teams reliant on dealing with Galarian Zapdos through Pokemon that resist Flying and Fighting, as well as allow it to beat faster revenge killers like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Enamorus. Alternatively, Knock Off is an option to slam Slowking and Slowbro if needed, as well as allow Galarian Zapdos to force progress against bulkier targets like Iron Hands and Clefable. Trailblaze is another option on hyper offense teams that can allow Galarian Zapdos to leverage its Bulk Up boosts to sweep by boosting its Speed. Trailblaze also hits Quagsire harder than Brave Bird, which can allow partners on hyper offense builds like Ceruledge to sweep later in the game. Leftovers is an option on Galarian Zapdos if another teammate is using the Z-crystal, and it grants Galarian Zapdos more longevity. It pairs especially well with Substitute, as Leftovers recovery can allow for Galarian Zapdos to set up Substitute multiple times over the course of the game. Bulk Up Galarian Zapdos is mainly used on hyper offense teams and is especially great alongside Ribombee, as it can punish Defog users attempting to remove Ribombee's Sticky Web. It can also be used on balance or fat teams looking for a wincon that can attempt to set up and wallbreak multiple times in a game. Teammates like Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria appreciate Galarian Zapdos switching into and breaking foes like Skarmory and Celesteela, respectively, so they can sweep in the late-game. Defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Gastrodon appreciate Galarian Zapdos's ability to beat slower wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Bisharp and Sinistcha, and can switch into attacks from faster threats like Enamorus and Cinderace aimed at Galarian Zapdos.</p>"

U-turn allows Galarian Zapdos to pivot out of matchups against defensive foes it cannot break with Choice Scarf, such as Skarmory. Knock Off allows Galarian Zapdos to remove the pesky Rocky Helmet or Heavy-Duty Boots to allow teammates like Cinderace to wallbreak later in the game. The speed control provided by Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos allows it to fit on a wider range of teams, from offense to balance. Its ability to threaten common offensive threats like Cinderace is appreciated by frail offensive Pokemon like Alakazam and Hisuian Zoroark, and its ability to revenge kill powerful wallbreakers like Iron Moth and Hydreigon is appreciated by passive defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon and Celesteela.

Similarly, Gholdengo handles offensive threats that may overwhelm Moltres, such as pivot Sneasler and Iron Valiant, while Moltres covers it against Cinderace and Kingambit. Setup sweepers such as Kingambit and Iron Valiant can make great use of Moltres's ability to generate free turns by pivoting them into play and spreading burn for easier setup.</p>"

It is a defogger that can threaten Gholdengo; a check to common Stealth Rock setters like Great Tusk, Heatran, and Garchomp; and a deterrent to contact attackers like U-turn users, Kartana, and Mega Lopunny. However, its main weakness lies in its overreliance on its Heavy-Duty Boots—although Tera could let it drop its weakness to Rock, Tera is usually better spent on other Pokemon, so Moltres still fears Knock Off from opponents it would otherwise check, like Iron Valiant, Landorus-T, Kartana, and Mega Scizor. Tera Water is used to ease the matchup against rain, becoming a check to common rain abusers like Basculegion-M, Mega Swampert and Barraskewda and threatening to burn them with Flame Body. Tera Ground instead grants a resistance to Stealth Rock and Stone Edge from Choice Scarf Landorus-T and an immunity to Volt Switch from Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W and Thunderbolt from Iron Valiant. Mystical Fire is chosen over Flamethrower, as its Special Attack drop is useful to more easily check Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Charizard Y, and Gholdengo. Scorching Sands is used to beat Heatran and also deter physical attackers looking to set up due to its high burn chance. Hurricane allows Moltres to OHKO Great Tusk and Mega Lopunny while heavily denting Volcarona and is useful in general as a powerful STAB option, U-turn allows Moltres to function as a pivot, pivoting out on foes like Heatran and Garganacl, and Toxic allows Moltres to punish Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp looking to soak up its STAB options. The given EVs allow Moltres to survive two Frustration from Mega Lopunny without Stealth Rock damage. However, there are still many opponents that can pressure Moltres, like Garganacl, Toxapex, and Tapu Koko. Moltres thus pairs well with wallbreakers that can take advantage of such switch-ins to come in, like Tapu Lele or Iron Valiant. Moltres also dislikes having its Heavy-Duty Boots removed, so teammates that can absorb Knock Off are appreciated, including Mega Scizor and Gliscor.</p>"

Tera Blast Fairy lets it OHKO Hoopa-U while also being able to net 2HKOs on Kingambit, Assault Vest Hoopa-U, and Dragonite, all after one Nasty Plot boost. Tera Fairy also maintains its Dark resistance while letting it potentially set up in the face of Dragon-type attacks from foes like Dragapult. Alternatively, Hurricane is a strong neutral STAB move that prevents Galarian Moltres form relying too much on Terastallization to function. Tera Dark boosts Fiery Wrath's power, being able to OHKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowking after a Nasty Plot boost and Stealth Rock damage, as well as being able to 2HKO specially defensive Moltres and Assault Vest Toxapex after a Nasty Plot boost. Tera Flying is only to be used if running Hurricane, which can OHKO Zamazenta without a Nasty Plot boost, as well as non-Assault Vest Azumarill and Enamorus after a Nasty Plot boost. Sitrus Berry lets it set up much more easily, and can potentially let it trigger Berserk twice. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to ignore Stealth Rock. Finally, Weakness Policy is a viable alternative if running dual screens support to take on super effective hits more comfortably. Because of its reliance on setup, Galarian Moltres is best utilized on hyper offense teams. Hence, it appreciates entry hazard support from suicide leads such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Meowscarada so that incoming foes can be worn down for Galarian Moltres to clean. Dual screens from Dragapult lets it setup much more easily, esepcially for Weakness Policy variants. Hazard control is a must when running Galarian Moltres due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, so it appreciates partners such as Great Tusk and Hatterene with their access to Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce. The two of them can also threaten special walls that can hinder a Galarian Moltres sweep, with Great Tusk being able to OHKO Galarian Slowking and 2HKO Ting-Lu, while Hatterene can 2HKO Clodsire. In return, Galarian Moltres can set up on and threaten Zamazenta for Great Tusk and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo as well as special walls like Garganacl prevent Galarian Moltres from performing its sweep. Hence, offensive Zapdos pairs well with Galarian Moltres, being able to 2HKO both of the aforementioned Pokemon, provided Garganacl is Tera Water. Lastly, Galarian Moltres can facilitate sweeps from physically oriented sweepers like Kingambit by removing obstacles like Great Tusk and Gholdengo.</p>"

It provides an important buffer against offensive threats such as Hisuian Zoroark and Alakazam while also finding setup opportunities against a large portion of defensive staples, such as Slowbro and Mega Venusaur. Nasty Plot boosts Galarian Moltres's Special Attack to absurd levels, allowing it to reliably pressure specially defensive tanks such Hippowdon and Clefable. Agility allows Galarian Moltres to outspeed common revenge killers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Keldeo after one round of setup while giving it the opportunity to clean up opposing teams late-game when its wallbreaking prowess with Nasty Plot isn't as necessary. Taunt, on the other hand, can be used to prevent status and healing from Pokemon such as Blissey and specially defensive Hippowdon, allowing Galarian Moltres to wear them down or use them as setup fodder. Hurricane, in conjunction with Flyinium Z, gives Galarian Moltres a powerful one-time nuke in Supersonic Skystrike that can break through neutral targets such as Blissey and Gastrodon, threatening to outright OHKO the latter at +2 while also offsetting Hurricane’s middling accuracy in the process. As Galarian Moltres can struggle to safely find setup opportunities against faster threats such as Cinderace and Enamorus, it pairs best with offensive teammates that can also complement its wallbreaking prowess; late-game cleaners such as Dragon Dance Salamence, Meteor Beam Nihilego, and Booster Energy Iron Moth capitalize on Galarian Moltres's ability to weaken specific answers, such as specially defensive Celesteela and Skeledirge, respectively, allowing them to sweep opposing teams with greater ease late-game. The latter two can also invite in and weaken Rock-types such as both Tyranitar formes and the rare Nihilego, which Galarian Moltres can struggle to break through otherwise.

After one Nasty Plot boost, Galarian Moltres 2HKOes physically defensive Toxapex, physically defensive Ting-Lu, and Celesteela.

Agility allows Galarian Moltres to outpace dangerous revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Choice Scarf Kartana. However, Taunt is also a valuable alternative to Agility in order to shut down defensive checks like Haze Toxapex and Unaware Clodsire while also preventing common status spreaders like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran from limiting its sweep. Heavy-Duty Boots negates chip damage from entry hazards and allows Galarian Moltres to set up more reliably. Flyinium Z is used in order to quickly eliminate bulkier threats such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn without risking a miss due to Hurricane's poor accuracy; however, this leaves Galarian Moltres unable to Terastallize against threats such as Tapu Lele. Sitrus Berry is another option that lets Galarian Moltres maintain its health and trigger Berserk twice. Galarian Moltres is a great user of Terastallization, using Tera Steel to set up on its standard checks in Tapu Lele, Toxapex, Tapu Koko, and Clefable. Tera Steel also lets it resist many forms of priority including, but not limited to, Mega Lopunny's and Mega Medicham's Fake Out, Weavile's Ice Shard, and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. However, Galarian Moltres's new weaknesses mean that it has a harder time setting up on Mega Lopunny, Heatran, and Landorus-T while also being susceptible to other forms of priority like Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Galarian Moltres enjoys dual screens support to let it set up incredibly easily, so Tapu Koko makes for a great partner as both a solid pivot and dual screens setter. Galarian Moltres can struggle against threats such as Mega Diancie, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Mega Tyranitar, so Mega Scizor and Hawlucha make for great partners to handle its checks offensively; in return, Galarian Moltres can break through Pokemon such as Toxapex, Landorus-T, and Gholdengo for them. Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta are also good partners that can check threats like Heatran, Kingambit, and Garganacl for Galarian Moltres. Iron Valiant, in particular, also synergizes well with dual screens Tapu Koko, making it a fantastic cleaner after Galarian Moltres has broken through the opposing team.</p>"

Extreme Speed is an excellent move for any physical sweeper, due to its high power and initiative over other priority users such as Kingambit. Earthquake provides coverage against bulky foes such as Toxapex, Garganacl, and Clodsire. Fire Punch OHKOes Scizor and 2HKOes physically defensive Corviknight after a Dragon Dance and Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Ice Spinner hits opposing Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Dragapult super effectively, notably OHKOing Dragapult after a Dragon Dance. Heavy-Duty Boots + Roost improves Dragonite's longevity and possibly enables it to retain Multiscale and obtain multiple boosts; preserving Multiscale is particularly useful for surviving Draco Meteor from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult. Encore can be used to provide setup opportunities and eventually overwhelm bulky Pokemon like Corviknight, Bulk Up Great Tusk, and Curse Garganacl. Tera Normal turns Extreme Speed into an incredibly powerful STAB priority move capable of shredding offensive teams after a single boost, and a timely typing change also removes Dragonite's weaknesses to Ice, Fairy, and Dragon, which can buy a free turn to set up. An Adamant nature is preferred since it maximizes the power of Extreme Speed, which often makes makes Speed stats irrelevant, but a Jolly nature can also be used to outspeed the Normal-immune Dragapult after a Dragon Dance, which is especially useful if Dragonite is running Ice Spinner.</p> <p>Offensive Dragon Dance Dragonite regularly serves as a potent win con on offensive teams that can also act as a revenge killer against fast and frail threats. Multiscale Dragonite's considerable bulk, as well as Ghost immunity with Tera Normal provides significant defensive utility for offensive teams. In particular, teams using frail offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant appreciate the defensive utility Dragonite brings. In return, these Pokemon can help wallbreak for a late-game Dragonite sweep. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, and Garchomp is appreciated to weaken Pokemon such as Iron Valiant into range of boosted Extreme Speed. Dual screens support from Grimmsnarl is a potential option that can supplement Dragonite's already great bulk and virtually guarantee the ability to acquire multiple boosts. Since Dragonite struggles against bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo and Skeledirge, a teammate that can switch into and check these Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, is appreciated.

Extreme Speed alongside Tera Normal lets Dragonite clean up late-game, OHKOing faster threats like Meowscarada and potentially Cinderace at +1. It also outprioritizes Meowscarada's Sucker Punch as well as Grimmsnarl's Prankster-boosted Reflect and Thunder Wave. Earthquake covers Normal-resistant and -immune Pokemon, including foes like Dragapult, non-Air Balloon Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Kingambit. 144 HP EVs allow Dragonite to survive Tera Fairy Iron Valiant's Moonblast at +1 through Multiscale.

Unaware users like Dondozo and Skeledirge may switch into Dragonite expecting a Dragon Dance variant but take massive damage from a Choice Band-boosted attack instead. Outrage is an extremely powerful STAB move capable of 2HKOing virtually any Pokemon that does not resist it, which even includes physically defensive walls like Great Tusk and Dondozo. It can also OHKO opposing Dragonite, even with Multiscale intact. Breaking walls is not the only role Dragonite fulfills, as Extreme Speed is a strong priority move that allows it to revenge kill threats like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon with some prior chip damage, or clean up late-game. Earthquake provides strong coverage, hitting grounded Steel-types like Gholdengo and Kingambit that resist Outrage and Extreme Speed. It's also Dragonite's strongest attack against walls like Garganacl, Toxapex, and Skeledirge to avoid locking it into Outrage. There are a couple of different options for the last moveslot. Fire Punch provides coverage for Corviknight and Tera Steel Rotom-W. Iron Head deals significant damage to Fairy-types like Hatterene and Scream Tail, as well as Tera Fairy users like Garganacl and Skeledirge. Thunder Punch is Dragonite's best option for dealing with Azumarill while also providing coverage for Corviknight. Ice Spinner is another option to hurt the likes of Great Tusk, Garchomp, and opposing Dragonite without locking into Outrage. It also ends Psychic Terrain, which allows Dragonite to use Extreme Speed against grounded Pokemon later on. Multiscale allows Dragonite to take even super effective hits from offensive Pokemon like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Choice Specs Dragapult and KO them back. Tera Normal makes Extreme Speed even more powerful, OHKOing offensive Volcarona and Iron Moth, and removes Dragonite's usual weaknesses to attacks like Iron Valiant's Moonblast, which can be useful for revenge killing and cleaning.</p> <p>Choice Band Dragonite fits best on mostly offensive teams where it can break holes in the opposing team for its teammates to take advantage of and where its strong priority may be needed against other offensive teams. However, while Choice Band Dragonite is very powerful, it also requires a lot of support. As it is vulnerable to Stealth Rock, not only because Dragonite is weak to it but also because it negates Multiscale, strong entry hazard control is important. This can be in the form of entry hazard removal, such as Rapid Spin Great Tusk, but also in the form of entry hazard prevention, such as Hatterene and Taunt users like Meowscarada and Greninja. Knock Off users like Great Tusk and Meowscarada can remove Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from walls like opposing Great Tusk and Corviknight, which makes them easier to break for Dragonite and keeps Multiscale intact. Switching Dragonite directly into attacks should generally be avoided, since keeping Multiscale intact is desirable, so it appreciates teammates that can bring it in safely. Examples include pivot move users, such as Cinderace, Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Slowking, as well as Eject Button or Eject Pack users, such as Eject Button Hatterene, Eject Pack Great Tusk, and Eject Pack Gholdengo. Physical attackers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon appreciate Dragonite weakening or removing checks like Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Dondozo. On the other hand, special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth can lure in checks like Clodsire and Slowking for Dragonite to punish. Iron Moth has the additional benefit of helping with Dragonite's fourth moveslot issue, as it can threaten Steel-types like Corviknight for Dragonite lacking Fire Punch and Fairy-types like Hatterene for Dragonite lacking Iron Head.</p>"

Iron Head can be used to deal with Fairy-types such as Hatterene, while Waterfall can be used in rain archetypes to deal with types such as Ground.</p> <p>Corviknight can deal with Ice-type Pokemon like Chien-Pao with Iron Head and can pivot with U-turn. Kilowattrel can also pivot Dragonite in with Volt Switch and can help it deal with physical walls like Dondozo and Iron Defense Corviknight. Choice Specs Iron Jugulis is also a great partner that appreciates Dragonite dealing with special walls such as Clodsire, Slowking, and Dragalge, while Iron Jugulis deals with phyisical walls such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. Bombirdier can provide entry hazard support with Stealth Rock and prevent foes such as Ting-Lu from setting up their own hazards with Taunt while also offering extra pivoting with Parting Shot to help Dragonite find more occasions to wallbreak. Gyarados is another teammate that can deal with some Ice-types such as Chien-Pao, but the lack of recovery can wear it down very quickly. In exchange, Dragonite can weaken down foes such as Toxapex and Amoonguss to potentially allow Gyarados to clean up teams with Dragon Dance.</p>"

Just note that some Levitate Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Air Balloon Gholdengo can completely wall Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore can be tricky to fit in on Dragonite, since giving up Roost greatly harms Dragonite's lasting power, and giving up Dragon Dance makes sweeping much more difficult. However, the amount of match-ups it lets Dragonite win against passive Pokemon, and the amount of switch-ins it gives it, make it a worthy move to consider regardless.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: This set benefits immensely from the ability to Terastallize to both boost Extreme Speed's power while also removing Dragon type weaknesses. However, care should be taken on the timing of Terastallization depending on the matchup, as Dragonite more effectively checks several prominent threats, such as Urshifu-R and Heatran, with its base typing.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire Punch</strong>: Fire Punch gets around Dragonite's issue with Tera Steel Levitate Pokemon such as Rotom-W, but it makes Heatran a big issue.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Waterfall</strong>: Waterfall acts as decent role compression, allowing Dragonite to hit Heatran and Levitating Steel-types, but it's coverage is nowhere near as good as Earthquake otherwise.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Stealth Rock is commonly set up specifically to break Dragonite's Multiscale, so Heavy-Duty Boots are a good way to always preserve Dragonite's ability to set up and revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry gives Dragonite more set up opportunities against status moves and pairs particularly well with Outrage to cure confusion.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: On more defensive or Encore based Dragonite, the residual recovery of Leftovers adds up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: For more defensive EV spreads, Rocky Helmet lets Dragonite play more passively against physical threats.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish</strong> Going fully defensive means Dragonite won't sweep nearly as easily, but Dragonite is still capable of being an effective defensive Pokemon even after Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 Def / 100 Spe with Impish or 156 HP / 252 Atk / 100 Spe with Adamant</strong>: These EV spreads outspeeds Jolly Ursaluna, who while not common, can seriously threaten to break past Dragonite with Guts boosted Facade.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>20 HP / 252 Atk / 236 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This EV spread is the minimum amount of Speed needed to outspeed Dragapult and Flutter Mane after Dragon Dance, the fastest two Pokemon immune to Extreme Speed. Outspeeding Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao can also be useful since both are known to sometimes use Tera Ghost for Extreme Speed.</p> </li> </ul>"

If using Tera Flying with Tera Blast as the only attack, this set will need Terastallization to function.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: With Tera Blast, Tera Flying gives Dragonite a solid mono-attacking option and defensive typing in one, at the cost of almost always needing to Terastallize to function.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy gives Dragonite an excellent mono-attacking Tera Blast that gives it an advantage over other Dragon-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel covers Dragonite's former weaknesses very well, and can still work somewhat well even if not Terastallized thanks to Iron Head, though note it makes this Dragonite much more vulnerable to Urshifu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is among this Dragonite's few Tera types that hits Heatran hard, making Waterfall a particularly attractive option. Just note that Water Absorb Clodsire will completely wall this set if not using extra coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Though this requires extra coverage to be viable Tera Electric gives Dragonite only a single weakness to Ground-type attacks, and has excellent coverage with Ice Spinner.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet lets Dragonite play more passively thanks to the chip damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Preserving Multiscale even when Stealth Rock is set up can help Dragonite survive attacks in emergencies.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's passive healing gives Dragonite a better matchup against passive foes it can Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: With Covert Cloak, Dragonite becomes a very solid check to Garganacl, as well as no longer fearing Acid Spray or flinches.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Weakness Policy</strong>: Since Multiscale makes Dragonite very difficult to OHKO, Weakness Policy is a viable option to turn the tables on foes targeting Dragonite's weaknesses.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads And Dragon Dance Speed Tiers</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 188 Defense / 76 Spe with Impish</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds up to Urshifu after one Dragon Dance, and Dragapult after two Dragon Dances.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 148 Defense / 108 Speed with Impish</strong>: This spread outspeeds Garchomp, Thundurus-T, and Chi-Yu after Dragon Dance, all of which are threats that can easily revenge kill Dragonite once Multiscale is broken.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 20 Def / 236 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This is the minimum Speed needed to outspeed Jolly Dragapult after a boost, and it also outspeeds Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "Dragon Tail Phazer": {
          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Multiscale's incredible bulk potential and Dragon Tail bypassing Taunt, Dragonite is a unique and very effective phazer that massively ups the danger of entry hazards!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Teammates</strong>: For this Dragonite to be at its most effective, you'll need some partners to at least set up Stealth Rock. Ting-Lu and Garchomp stand out for being particularly bulky options that can even set up Spikes, but other options include Annihilape, Clodsire, Landorus-T, and Kleavor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Iron Head</strong>: Earthquake is the most wide-reaching coverage move, ensuring good damage against Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra. Iron Head is worth considering as it prevents Dragonite from being walled by Tera Fairy Rotom-W and has good damage output against Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute versus Encore</strong>: Substitute is a fantastic option against Pokemon with status moves that threaten Dragonite's phazing cycles, such as Garganacl, Wo-Chien, and Clodsire. Encore won't do as well against these threats but does punish opposing foes carrying Substitute that can be a problem for Dragon Tail along with slower foes that use status moves in general such as Dondozo and Ursaluna. Encore can even be used over extra coverage if teammates can deal with Fairy-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Extreme Speed versus Aqua Jet</strong>: Extreme Speed's ability to pick off threats is useful, even on defensive variants of this set. Despite being half as powerful, Aqua Jet is still worth considering for its ability to pick off weakened Flutter Mane, which can be difficult for this set to handle due to its power when Multiscale isn't in play.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Dragonite's defensive typing can be quite helpful against foes like Urshifu-R and Chi-Yu, but some of the huge exploitable weakness to Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane will require Terastallization to cover.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dragon immunity gels well with Dragonite and is a great defensive typing in general against foes like Chien-Pao and Urshifu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is not only an incredible defensive typing that covers much of Dragonite's former weaknesses, but the power boost it provides to Iron Head lets it OHKO all but the most bulky Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water's Ice and Fire resistance makes it a great pick against Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Heatran and is among the best defensive types in general. The boost to Aqua Jet can also be helpful for picking off threats, though it won't be as powerful as Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal isn't that incredible defensively, but it can be worth it for boosting Extreme Speed's power, letting offensive EV spreads 2HKO Chien-Pao with it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a niche option that lets Dragonite absorb Toxic Spikes and gain a Toxic immunity without being weak to Fighting- and Fire-type attacks like Tera Steel is.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is a high value item, but it's worth using on Dragonite if using Substitute, as it gives Dragonite a serious chance of passively gaining Multiscale's effect back.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet allows Dragonite to play more passively, punishing Pokemon that rely on contact moves like Choice Item Urshifu-R and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots' Stealth Rock immunity makes Multiscale more flexible, especially if Dragon Tail brings in a threat Dragonite isn't equipped to handle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: With Dragonite often moving last with Dragon Tail, it's especially vulnerable to Spore from Breloom, Amoonguss, and Brute Bonnet, so Safety Goggles can be a good pick if Substitute isn't a good fit.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 Def / 100 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread outspeeds Jolly Ursaluna, who while not common, can seriously threaten to blast past Dragonite with Facade.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 Def / 180 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread gives up quite a bit of bulk in exchange for outspeeding Adamant Breloom, while still often mantaining a Substitute against Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 124 Atk / 108 Def / 4 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is optimized for use with Earthquake and Aqua Jet, allowing Dragonite to 2HKO 4 Defense Flutter Mane with that combination of moves without needing to Terastallize. Only Modest Tera Fairy Flutter Mane will have a chance to OHKO through Multiscale.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is a far more offensive approach, mainly for use with Extreme Speed to pick off threats more effectively.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Due to Dragonite's offensive presence and high bulk, many opponents choose to either check it defensively or set up against it to break through Roost + Multiscale. Against either option, Encore can turn Dragonite practically invincible allowing it to reside on the field indefinitely in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire Spin</strong>: This allows Dragonite to defeat almost any Pokemon universally by simply making full use of its longevity. Trapping an Encore locked Pokemon in the field is also highly valuable. Fire Spin is used instead of Wrap because it affects Ghost-types and doesn't trigger chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Waterfall</strong>: Earthquake prevents Dragonite from being entirely passive against Heatran, Flutter Mane, and Clodsire. Waterfall isn't as as great against Steel-types, but still covers Heatran and Flying-types like Landorus-T and Thundurus-T.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head</strong>: Even with minimal Attack investment, Iron Head has a serious shot of OHKOing offensive Flutter Mane, and it gives Dragonite a decent STAB move if using Tera Steel. Just note that it makes Dragonite very vulnerable to Heatran.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draco Meteor</strong>: With a Bold Nature, Draco Meteor is a powerful move that can catch opposing Dragon-types off-guard and deal big damage to Dondozo and Urshifu, though its severely walled by Heatran.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Dragonite's typing does have some fairly exploitable weaknesses that can harm its defensive capability, but an immunity to Toxic Spikes and useful resistances to common attack types such as Ground, Fire, and Fighting mean that Terastallization is not always the right play.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Due to Dragonite’'s low Speed compared to other Dragon-types, Tera Fairy is a great response against them. This also retains its advantage against Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel massively improves Dragonite's matchups against Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, at the cost of being even more vulnerable to Salt Cure and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water adds a resistance to Ice without losing Dragonite's innate Fire-type resistance, which is helpful against Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: The niche Tera Poison gives Dragonite a way to remove its common weaknesses without being vulnerable to Toxic Spikes, while still resisting Fighting unlike Tera Steel.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>252 HP / 156 Def / 100 Spe with Impish</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Jolly Ursaluna, who can threaten to wallbreak Dragonite before it can Encore Earthquake or Headlong Rush otherwise.</li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Heavy-Duty Boots</strong> Generally, Leftovers preserves Dragonite’'s longevity best, as it cancels out the damage from Sandstorm and makes timer stall easier. However, the increased usage of entry hazard setters in response to Dragonite makes Heavy-Duty Boots a strong option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet makes it easier for Dragonite to defeat Pokemon such as opposing Dragonite, Kingambit, and Meowscarada, and its residual damage can be used to execute a win condition.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: With Covert Cloak, this Dragonite becomes a very effective check to Garganacl, in addition to no longer being vulnerable to flinches from Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash while Terastallizing.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Paraflinch Dragonite is a defensively oriented Dragonite set that takes full advantage of Terastallization and the element of surprise to cripple and downright defeat numerous Pokemon. Multiscale allows Dragonite to paralyze its foes relatively safely, becoming a massive nuisance for unprepared opponents.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Slash vs. Iron Head</strong>: Air Slash is a more practical move for this set, as it can cover a wider range of Pokemon for at least neutral damage. Air Slash also does not trigger Rocky Helmet and is naturally boosted by Dragonite's STAB. The Iron Head variant of Paraflinch, however, gives Dragonite an easier time against a number of common threats such as Flutter Mane, at the cost of only defeating Heatran that are Terastallized.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore vs. Substitute</strong>: Encore will allow Dragonite to effectively check a wider variety of Pokemon such as Ursaluna by locking them into an unfavorable move, giving it a free opportunity to land Thunder Wave on your opponent's switch-in on the following turn. Substitute, on the other hand, will give Dragonite a much easier time dealing with defensive Pokemon that rely on status inflictions such as Wo-Chien and Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Waterfall</strong>: Waterfall can be a viable option. However, the move is less reliable for the application of this set, as its chance to flinch is 20% as opposed to Air Slash and Iron Head's 30%.

This can also work against Chien-Pao, but Icicle Crash's flinch chance makes this rather risky.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Low Kick</strong>: Earthquake is the preferred coverage move for OHKOing Heatran, a common response when thinking Dragonite is locked into Tera Blast. Low Kick trades that OHKO from full health for revenge killing opposing Tera Normal Dragonite and dealing massive damage to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is the best nature for needing less chip damage to revenge kill weakened targets with priority attacks, but Jolly can make sense if outspeeding foes like Jolly Breloom, Modest Gholdengo, and Adamant Baxcalibur is appealing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Almost Required</strong>: This set is highly reliant on using Tera Blast as a luring tool, so Terastallization should be a top priority for Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sharp Beak</strong>: Sharp Beak gives Dragonite the most offensive presence with the fewest drawbacks, giving Flying-type Tera Blast just enough of a boost to 3HKO Dondozo.

In the latter case, Dragonite can switch to maintain offensive momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Assault Vest vastly improves Dragonite's matchup against Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane, especially if Multiscale's protection has been lost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots means Stealth Rock will no longer remove this set's ability to trade blows with powerful threats.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "overview": "<h1>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; our changes Thanks to the sheer power of Tera Normal Extreme Speed, Dragonite is one of DOU’s biggest threats, threatening to KO a large portion of the metagame. Dragonite also has excellent coverage, allowing it to hit any Pokémon that aren't afraid of Extreme Speed, such as Gholdengo and Iron Treads. Dragonite’s Dragon/Flying allows it to take attacks such as Chi-Yu's Heat Wave and Palafin's Jet Punch while also granting it immunity to Earthquakes from Garchomp and Great Tusk. Tera Normal also allows it to survive threatening Dragon- and Ice-type attacks. Inner Focus lets Dragonite avoid Attack drops from Intimidate and flinches from Fake Out. Dragonite is most commonly paired with Chien-Pao, as Sword of Ruin lowers the Defense of foes, allowing Extreme Speed to deal more damage.

Moreover, Taunt also permits Mewtwo to antilead Ribombee and deny its Sticky Web, being one of the few Pokemon that can accomplish this without losing an important chunk of HP in the process.</li> <li>Earth Power can be used instead to greatly damage Zacian-C, Skeledirge, and tera Steel Pokemon like Clodsire.</li> <li>Tera Steel allows Mewtwo to resist both of Zacian-C's STAB moves while also resisting Extreme Killer Arceus's Extreme Speed, which is particularly important, as Extreme Killer Arceus is a very common offensive answer to Mewtwo.</li> <li>Heavy-Duty Boots allows Mewtwo to ignore entry hazards like Spikes and, most importantly, Toxic Spikes. Leftovers can be used instead as Mewtwo's only form of recovery. Lastly, Life Orb can be used to greatly increase Mewtwo's damage output, allowing it to have a favorable chance of OHKOing Ting-Lu after a Nasty Plot. A Modest nature can be used to ensure Mewtwo OHKOes Ting-Lu and Extreme Killer Arceus at +2 and works best on Sticky Web teams, as on them Mewtwo doesn't mind the loss in Speed and can break holes in teams more easily.</li> <li>It is advised to get Mewtwo on the field via smart double switches or U-turn from teammates like Koraidon, as per its underwhelming defensive typing, it doesn't get many opportunities to freely switch in. Once in the field, Mewtwo should dish out as much damage as possible or use Nasty Plot to break important Pokemon, like Calm Mind Arceus formes. Against faster foes without pivoting moves like Zacian-C, Mewtwo can freely Terastallize into a Steel-type to resist both of its STAB moves and hit back hard with an Earth Power or Flamethrower.</li> <li>Mewtwo struggles against faster foes, like Zacian-C, Koraidon, and Flutter Mane. Because of this, Pokemon like Landorus-T, Skeledirge, and Clodsire make for good partners. Landorus-T and Clodsire in particular help Mewtwo by spreading entry hazards, allowing it to net some KOs that it would normally miss, such as against Arceus-Steel, a Pokemon that now gets OHKOed by a +2 Flamethrower after a single layer of Spikes.</li> </ul>"

Mew has near-perfect coverage with Stored Power and Body Press, with the latter able to crucially smash Steel- and Dark-types like Kingambit, Ferrothorn, Mega Tyranitar, and Weavile, which would otherwise exploit it. Covert Cloak is a must for Mew to avoid being worn down by Garganacl’s Salt Cure and help against being burned by Scald from the likes of Toxapex.

The given EV spread lets Mew outspeed non-Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. Since Mew is very passive while setting up, it is prone to being overwhelmed by Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Garchomp or used as setup fodder by Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Tornadus-T, thus making it crucial that Mew sets up or Tera at the right time. As such, teammates like Toxapex, Skarmory, and Zapdos are much appreciated to help check those Pokemon for Mew. Taunt from Tornadus-T and Heatran and Trick from Choice Specs Iron Valiant shut Mew down, so having teammates like Gliscor, Gholdengo, and Mega Scizor help deal with them. Gholdengo, in particular, is hard for Mew to deal with, as it can boost at a faster rate than Mew while taking a fully stacked-up Stored Power with ease and being immune to Body Press. Therefore, teammates that can threaten or Pursuit trap it such as Garchomp and Kingambit are very appreciated. Toxapex uses Haze to sit on Mew and forces it to Tera to avoid Toxic, thus overwhelming or removing Toxapex with the likes of Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Heatran allow Mew to set up and win.</p>"

Prankster Mew should only be used as a dual screens lead on hyper offense teams. Teammates such as Chien-Pao, Polteageist, Volcarona, and Roaring Moon all appreciate screens, which allow them to easily set up and make them less susceptible to revenge killers. The aforementioned Pokemon also provide good options for Mew to pivot into and gain momentum. Dark-type Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Meowscarada, and Chien-Pao are immune to Prankster Taunt and can take advantage of Mew, so counters to them such as Zamazenta-C and Triage users, like Enamorus-T and Ursaluna, are good teammates.</p>"

Close Combat takes care of Blissey and Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra, Kingambit, and Heatran.

A Mild nature helps Mew exert as much pressure as possible with Ice Beam and Flamethrower, while a Hasty nature most notably lets it outspeed Hydreigon and Speed tie Zapdos. Magic Guard negates chip damage from Life Orb and entry hazards, helping Mew stay healthy for longer and allowing it to better utilize its natural bulk to come into play. Sheer Force is an alternative particularly if Mew is used alongside a teammate with Magic Guard, such as Hisuian Electrode. It greatly increases Mew's power, notably letting it OHKO Garchomp and Iron Treads and pressure otherwise solid checks such as Meloetta, at the cost of its longevity.

Maximum HP with Sitrus Berry highlights Azumarill’s naturally exceptional defensive typing, allowing it to serve as a one time check to OU staples such as Dragapult, Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. Belly Drum is an incredibly threatening option that lets Azumarill take advantage of the switches it forces from Pokemon such as Hydreigon to get setup opportunities. It is also a threatening late-game sweeper, as it can outspeed and OHKO defensive walls such as Clodsire, Slowking, and Garganacl while KOing most neutral faster targets such as Gholdengo and Iron Valiant with a +6 Aqua Jet. The threat of Belly Drum also lets Azumarill force uncomfortable mind games against Pokemon it can force out like weakened Great Tusk. Encore can be run over Liquidation to lock foes into undesirable moves to create more setup opportunities; this should be run with maximum Speed investment. Tera Water lets Azumarill OHKO even resisted targets such as Greninja, Meowscarada, and Dragapult with +6 Aqua Jet, as well as OHKOing Amoonguss and KOing Toxapex after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Azumarill serves as a valuable late-game sweeper for offense teams. Strong special attackers such as Iron Valiant and Greninja can help pressure Water-resistant foes such as Toxapex and Amoonguss to allow Azumarill to sweep without needing to Terastallize while providing Azumarill with setup opportunities against their checks like Dragapult and Hydreigon. Other setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon complement Azumarill, appreciating Azumarill's ability to break Amoonguss and Toxapex and wearing down each other's checks like Dondozo and Skeledirge. Entry hazard support from Pokémon like Glimmora and Garchomp provides the necessary chip damage to turn near OHKOs into true OHKOs on resisted Pokémon such as Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Meowscarada with Tera Water +6 Aqua Jet. Azumarill can pair well with teammates like Grimmsnarl and Orthworm that provide it with more setup opportunities.

Combine that with Huge Power, priority from Aqua Jet, and the boost to STAB that comes from Tera Water, and Azumarill goes from powerful to extremely threatening for any ill-prepared team. Ice Spinner as coverage is useful to hit Amoonguss and Water Absorb Clodsire, while Superpower is an alternative to deal with Steel-types like Kingambit and Orthworm that would be harder to damage without it. 140 Speed EVs allow Azumarill to outspeed Corviknight and Skeledirge. The remaining 116 EVs in HP increase its survivability. This, along with the incredible defensive typing of Water / Fairy protecting it from the many Dragon-type threats roaming the tier, such as Dragapult and Walking Wake, gives it the opportunity to safely switch into many otherwise frightening Pokemon. Tera Water and Fairy are for powering up the Choce Band-boosted STAB attacks Azumarill uses. Tera Water is preferred to get the extra boost to Aqua Jet, but Tera Fairy can also be used to reduce the continual damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> <p>Choice Band Azumarill is best used on offensive teams and benefits from the support of Pokemon that can open up opportunities for it to break holes. Pokemon like Dragapult and Rotom-W can be excellent teammates by making ample use of pivoting moves throughout a game to let Azumarill in safely. Special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth can be helpful to break through walls like Dondozo that Azumarill would otherwise struggle with. Faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Roaring Moon are useful as speed control to help cover Azumarill's low Speed. Most importantly though, entry hazards help Azumarill wear down tougher foes to be picked off later in the battle, so hazard setters like Great Tusk and Glimmora, as well as spinblockers like Gholdengo, are always appreciated teammates. Defensive Pokemon that have the tools to deal with Azumarill, like Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Dondozo, are the biggest thorns in Azumarill's side. Having another wallbreaker like Dragonite and Tera Electric Iron Valiant on the team can help mitigate some of these issues.</p>"

An Assault Vest offers a noticeable increase to Azumarill's special bulk, letting it check a wider pool of special attackers such as Hisuian Zoroark and Dragapult while also granting it greater flexibility in its attacking options compared to Choice Band. Liquidation and Play Rough serve as Azumarill's primary STAB attacks, possessing fantastic neutral coverage and hitting many threats such as Dragonite, Walking Wake, and Iron Valiant for super effective damage. Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to revenge kill weakened foes such as Great Tusk and Iron Moth. Ice Spinner is a powerful coverage option, 2HKOing many of Azumarill's common switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Water Absorb Clodsire. Ice Spinner's ability to remove Terrain also makes it particularly useful against opposing Psychic Terrain teams. Tera Water increases the power of Azumarill's Water-type STAB moves, letting it pick off foes such as Iron Moth from higher ranges with Aqua Jet and allowing its Liquidation to 2HKO Hatterene and OHKO offensive Great Tusk. However, Tera Water does come with noticable drawbacks, namely removing Azumarill's immunity to Dragon-type moves and resistances to Fighting- and Dark-type moves, which can make it a shakier check to Walking Wake and Greninja.</p> <p>Assault Vest Azumarill's talents will best be used by more offensive teams looking for a temporary answer to the aforementioned special threats. Partners at risk of being revenge killed by Walking Wake and Iron Valiant, such as Great Tusk and Hydreigon, will greatly appreciate Azumarill's ability to act as a buffer against these Pokemon. Despite Azumarill's good bulk, its tanking prowess can often be undermined by its vulnerability to passive damage from entry hazards and Rocky Helmet. Great Tusk is therefore an excellent partner, providing Rapid Spin support and being able to lure and remove Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Corviknight with Knock Off. Meowscarada is also an excellent ally, being able to shut down opposing entry hazard setters with Taunt while also providing Knock Off support. Furthermore, both Great Tusk and Meowscarada can support Azumarill by laying down entry hazards, which it will greatly appreciate given its ability to force switches. Ting-Lu can similarly lay down multiple layers of entry hazards and ease pressure exerted onto Azumarill in dealing with threats such as Dragapult and Iron Moth. Teammates that can bring Azumarill in safely with a pivoting move, such as Cinderace and Dragapult, are also recommended. Cinderace can assist Azumarill in dealing with entry hazards via Court Change, while Dragapult can deal with Orthworm, which may sometimes use Azumarill as an entry point to pass Shed Tail. In return, Azumarill can check key Pokemon such as Greninja that would threaten them. Azumarill greatly struggles against bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Water Garganacl. Hydreigon can exploit both Toxapex and Garganacl's passivity to set up with Substitute and Nasty Plot, though it must be wary of switching in against Toxic and Salt Cure. Breloom can pressure Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl with Bullet Seed, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo matches up quite nicely against Garganacl and opposing Breloom and can pivot into Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Azumarill is Fairy's premier setup sweeper with immense damage output thanks to Huge Power alongside Belly Drum, which allows Azumarill to handle threats to the type such as Glimmora and Iron Treads. Aqua Jet patches up its below-average Speed tier and threatens faster threats like Iron Moth, Sandy Shocks, and Flutter Mane. Aqua Jet can also sweep late-game, especially against types that lack Water-resistant Pokemon like Steel. Play Rough breaks through sturdier threats that are not OHKOed by Aqua Jet like Hydreigon and Iron Hands. It also threatens opposing Dragon-types like Roaring Moon and Dragalge. Liquidation can be used over Play Rough to OHKO Pokemon like Corviknight, Unaware Clodsire, and Bronzong after Belly Drum. Ice Spinner specifically hits Water Absorb Clodsire and Amoonguss for super effective damage. Body Slam is also another option to significantly threaten Toxapex at +6 Attack while still being able to target the aforementioned Clodsire and Amoonguss for neutral damage. Trailblaze can be used to always beat Quagsire as well. 4 HP EVs are given to make Azumarill's HP an even number so when it activates Belly Drum from full HP, it can activate its Sitrus Berry immediately.</p> <p>One of Azumarill's best partners on Fairy teams is Klefki. Klefki sets up dual screens, which leads to Azumarill having an easier time setting up and sweeping. Klefki also sets Spikes for Azumarill, allowing Azumarill to secure KOs easier after a Belly Drum, particularly against Amoonguss and Toxapex after one layer of Spikes. Klefki also hinders Azumarill's offensive checks like Breloom with Thunder Wave. In return, Azumarill threatens opposing Fire- and Ground-types that threaten Klefki like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Azumarill forms a potent offensive core with Flutter Mane, which threatens the physical walls that may impede Azumarill's sweep like Unaware Quagsire and Toxapex, while Azumarill handles special walls like specially defensive Ting-Lu, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Blissey. Azumarill also appreciates Iron Valiant as an offensive partner, as special sets can answer physical walls like Dondozo and hinder Azumarill's checks like Toxapex by using Trick, and—like with Flutter Mane—Azumarill can deal considerable damage to threats like Clodsire and Gholdengo. Magic Bounce Hatterene also assists Azumarill, as it bounces back entry hazards—particularly Toxic Spikes—which limits Azumarill's sweeping capabilities. Hatterene also has a strong matchup into Ground, Poison, and Water teams; Azumarill appreciates the latter two, since Hatterene is able to threaten Pokemon like Amoonguss and Toxapex.</p>"

Z-Belly Drum guarantees a +6 boost to Azumarill's already impressive Attack, turning it into a redoubtable setup sweeper with access to priority, and it can even offer a second setup opportunity if Azumarill gets forced out with its Z-Move unused. Aqua Jet is Azumarill's answer to threats that outspeed it, such as Volcarona, Tapu Koko, and Nidoking. Aside from dealing with Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Slowbro, and Sinistcha, Knock Off is Azumarill's best coverage option against walls that resist its other attacks, such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex and Water Absorb Clodsire. Breakneck Blitz coming off Return beats Mega Venusaur as well as Icium Z Toxapex, which doesn't fear Knock Off. Alternatively, Liquidation could be used as a stronger STAB option for slower foes like Iron Hands, Ting-Lu, and Celesteela, which is important if a Jolly nature is used. Ice Spinner is an alternative that can be used to defeat both Ting-Lu and Mega Venusaur after some chip, along with getting rid of Psychic Terrain to allow for Aqua Jet to be used without being blocked. Klefki is an amazing partner for Azumarill, offering a Poison immunity and dual screens support to ease setup and spreading Spikes to chip the opposing team. Mega Diancie helps in the Fire and Flying matchups and provides entry hazard control, contributing to keeping Azumarill healthy as well as providing Stealth Rock to help its wallbreaking. Tapu Koko deals with Water-types such as Pelipper and Toxapex, making Azumarill's sweep easier down the line, and it also handles Steel- and Flying-types like Celesteela and Corviknight should Azumarill opt for Return. Tapu Bulu also aids in the Water and Electric matchup, handling foes like Quagsire and Rotom-W that Azumarill can struggle to bring down. Iron Valiant deals with most Fighting-types and, when paired with Tapu Koko, outspeeds and defeats faster foes such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Swampert under rain, but it competes with Azumarill for a Z-Crystal. Tapu Lele handles Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Clodsire, but be cautious of Psychic Terrain preventing Azumarill from using Aqua Jet. Babiri Berry Clefable can be used as an alternative to Tapu Lele for checking Scizor, and it also handles Mega Venusaur well, as it can use it as setup fodder.</p>"

Toxic puts many notable Pokemon in the tier on a timer such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Quagsire ideally wants Spikes over Stealth Rock to force more chip damage on potential switch-ins; however, Stealth Rock is fine as an alternative if none of its other teammates can afford to fit it into their moveset. Alternatively, Ice Beam with a Relaxed nature allows Quagsire to 2HKO Hawlucha after Stealth Rock and lets it beat Substitute + Dragon Dance Tera Flying Tyranitars. The passive recovery of Leftovers allows Quagsire to check Choice Band Tyranitar and Mimikyu more easily; however, if the team can not fit entry hazard removal, Heavy-Duty Boots is much more appealing. Quagsire only uses Terastallization defensively to check certain dangerous offensive threats. Tera Poison grants Quagsire a perfectly accurate Toxic and a poison immunity while also allowing it to handle Grass-types and offensive threats that use Grass-type moves such as Tsareena, Trailblaze Scizor, and Seed Bomb Pawmot. Tera Ghost allows Quagsire to beat Maushold by becoming immune to Population Bomb as well as check Slither Wing and Lucario more easily. Tera Ghost also has the added benefit of letting Quagsire serve as a spinblocker against spinners such as Tsareena.</p> <p>Quagsire primarily fits on balance, stall, and bulky offense teams as a defensive glue that holds these teams together. Common teammates for Quagsire include Stealth Rock setters such as Tinkaton and Tyranitar, which can allow Quagsire to run Spikes.

Tinkaton can also use Knock Off on Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Sticky Hold Gastrodon, Scream Tail, and Wo-Chien to rack up more damage from Quagsire's Spikes. Scream Tail is another Pokemon that complements Quagsire, as it is able to handle special Salamence as well as Gallade, while Quagsire is able to keep Bisharp and non-Trailblaze Scizor in check. Talonflame is another ideal partner for Quagsire as it can check Tsareena and Giga Drain variants of Wo-Chien. Blissey on stall teams is also a strong partner for Quagsire by virtue of walling almost every special attacker in the tier such as Iron Jugulis, Noivern, and Sandy Shocks.</p>"

Unfortunately, due to Umbreon's terrible Special Attack, a Calm Mind set typically requires too many boosts to be effective. Umbreon can fit two utility moves if it chooses to use Moonlight instead of Wish and Protect, but the limited PP can become a detriment in longer games. Umbreon can beat setup sweepers that typically take advantage of it, such as Quiver Dance Oricorio and Calm Mind Vaporeon, with Tera Ghost and Curse. Umbreon can also use Taunt and a few extra Speed EVs to stop setup sweepers like Sandaconda and Vaporeon or other support Pokemon like Vespiquen and Muk from using their own status moves. Lastly, Umbreon can trap an unsuspecting foe with Mean Look and wear it down with Foul Play or even drop its stats with Tickle to more easily take it out.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: NU has a plethora of Fighting-types, such as Crabominable, Medicham, and Sneasel-Hisui. Umbreon can Terastallize to reverse this weakness, but that always comes with a new set of weaknesses and removes the option to Terastallize later. Other Pokemon like Scyther and Zangoose have a powerful Close Combat that can threaten Umbreon as well.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Utility Moves</strong>: Regardless of Synchronize, a poisoned Umbreon, whether by Toxic or Toxic Spikes, is extremely impaired and struggles to fulfill its role. Trick from a Choice Scarf Haunter or Rotom can completely ruin Umbreon despite it being a suitable check to them otherwise. Taunt from Pokemon like Bombirdier, Qwilfish, and opposing Umbreon can limit Umbreon to only an exploitable Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Special Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers that don't mind Foul Play, mainly special attackers like Oricorio, Vivillon, and a Terastallized Farigiraf can easily boost against Umbreon.</p>",

While Pokemon like Tera Ground Oricorio and Coil Eelektross are immune to Thunder Wave, Yawn can shut down their setup attempts nicely. Synchronize can deter or punish careless status moves used by the likes of Dudunsparce and Drifblim. Umbreon prefers a Poison or Fairy Tera type to turn the tables on Fighting-types and take U-turn better. Tera Poison also provides a Fairy resistance and an immunity to Toxic and Toxic Spikes from common users like Muk, Qwilfish, and Vespiquen.</p> <p>Umbreon appreciates Drifblim and Qwilfish for their Fighting resistance. Drifblim can remove entry hazards and take advantage of Umbreon's status moves with Hex, while Qwilfish can consistently punish Fighting-type moves and U-turn from Pokemon like Passimian and Scyther with Poison Point and Rocky Helmet.

Chilly Reception can also be used for cancelling the effects of opposing weather such as rain and sun while also enabling offensive Ice-types due to snow's Defense boost. Surf is its most reliable STAB move, being necessary to sucessfully check Iron Moth and Iron Valiant. Future Sight threatens more defensive teams when paired with physical wallbreakers such as Cinderace, as it threatens opposing defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Amoonguss. Thunder Wave can alternatively be run alongside Surf, preventing Slowking from being setup fodder for Volcarona and Dragonite. Slowking runs maximum Special Defense EVs in order to switch into a variety of other special attackers such as Walking Wake, Rotom-W, Volcarona, and Hatterene. It also lets Slowking make use of Chilly Reception and Thunder Wave for dynamic counterplay. The investment also gives Slowking more opportunities to safely pivot in front of Pokemon that aren't immediately threatening but can beat it long-term, such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, Hisuian Zoroark, and Choice Specs Dragapult. 0 Speed IVs in tandem with a Sassy nature maximize the odds of slow pivoting in front of foes, which is important to nearly guarantee safely bringing in other teammates. Slowking can utilize Tera Water to remove its Bug-, Ghost-, and Dark-type weaknesses, enhancing its matchup against Gholdengo, Dragapult, Greninja, and Volcarona while also allowing it to absorb U-turn better. Additionally, it also boosts Surf's damage output. Tera Fairy turns the tables on Dragapult and Greninja, allowing it to wall their Choice Specs sets reliably.</p> <p>Slowking fits on balance teams due to its exclusive access to Chilly Reception, as they can take advantage of both the snow and momentum generated by it. Slowking enjoys being paired with Pokemon that can generate momentum, such as Cinderace, Rotom-W, and Sandy Shocks. This helps its team to pivot around Garganacl to avoid being worn down by its Salt Cure. Slowking is naturally paired with physically defensive walls with good synergy, such as Great Tusk, Amoonguss, and Corviknight, which answer many of Slowking´s checks such as Kingambit, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Slowking is generally vulnerable to becoming fodder for Orthworm, since it can't paralyze targets through Orthworm´s passed Substitutes. As such, Pokemon like Infiltrator Dragapult and Unaware Pokemon like Skeledirge and Dondozo are logical Slowking teammates that fix this issue, with Unaware teammates in particular being crucial for answering setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Iron Valiant that are present on hyper offense teams. Dark-types like Kingambit can check and occasionally switch into special attackers that have an advantage against Slowking like Nasty Plot Gholdengo, Choice Specs Greninja, and Choice Specs Dragapult, creating good defensive synergy without lacking offensive capabilities.</p>"

It can switch into foes like Tornadus-T and non-Toxic Heatran, and it can even scout for Choice Specs users such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Lele. Future Sight + Teleport or Chilly Reception lets Slowking support its frail offensive teammates such as Mega Lopunny and Dragapult, giving them safe switch ins and amplifying their wallbreaking prowess afterwards. Teleport is a much more reliable way of pivoting, as its higher PP makes it more valuable in longer games and it provides Slowking's teammates with a safe switch in against Ferrothorn and other Teleport users like Blissey and Slowbro. Alternatively, Chilly Reception's snow helps disrupt weather teams like sun and rain as well as support Ice-type teammates like Kyurem and Weavile with its Defense boost. Tera Fairy improves Slowking's matchup against Dragapult and Tapu Koko and maintains its Fighting resistance against Mega Lopunny, while Tera Dark lets it better stomach Ghost-type attacks from Gholdengo and Dragapult at the cost of being weaker against Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. Both Tera choices importantly prevent Slowking from being Pursuit trapped by Kingambit, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar. Wallbreakers like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, Great Tusk, and Kingambit appreciate Slowking's slow pivoting, with the looming Future Sight pressuring their switch-ins like Toxapex, Buzzwole, and defensive Great Tusk. Moreover, Slowking switches into their revenge killers, notably Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Ting-Lu, and Tangrowth cover foes like Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Kartana, respectively; Ferrothorn and Tangrowth also deal with rain wallbreakers like Mega Swampert and Barraskewda that would otherwise overwhelm Slowking despite its Water resistance, with the latter in particular forming a Regnerator core with Slowking.</p>"

Both types also give it a Pursuit neutrality, leaving it less vulnerable against Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile. Galarian Slowking appreciates Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off to preserve its Assault Vest, so Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Gliscor make for good teammates. The latter forms a good core with Galarian Slowking, punishing and gaining information on passive and offensive Pokemon throughout a game due to the duo's prolonged longevity.

It has a very strong type for this tier, with very few Pokemon able to hit it for super effective damage. It is also the best Rapid Spin blocker in PU because of this. Will-O-Wisp is great for crippling physical attackers like Lycanroc-N, Gabite, and Alolan Dugtrio. Choosing to run Thunder Wave over Will-O-Wisp can make dealing with Alolan Dugtrio and Gabite more difficult. With Misdreavus able to spread status so well, Hex is the best choice for its STAB move. Power Gem is quad effective against Articuno, Masquerain, and Charizard; it also hits other popular Pokemon like Houndoom, Pyroar, and Rotom-F for super effective damage. Thunderbolt can be opted for instead to better hit Water-types like Golduck, Lumineon, Basculin, and Quaxwell. Taunt is also an option over the two attacking moves to disallow setup sweepers such as Gogoat and Carbink from boosting in front of Misdreavus; it also works well at stopping entry hazard setters such as Carbink, Gabite, and Camerupt. The EV spread allows for better recovery with Pain Split by keeping Misdreavus's HP a bit lower than if 252 HP EVs were used while still keeping its overall bulk by adding the EVs taken from HP into both defensive stats. 56 Speed EVs let it out speed neutral natured Honchkrow and Flapple, as well as Timid Glimmet and uninvested Drakloak. Tera Fighting and Tera Fairy both work well to provide a resistance to Dark-type moves from Pokemon like Honchkrow and Alolan Persian. Although, Tera Fighting leaves Misdreavus vulnerable to Flying-type moves from Articuno, Charizard, and Masquerain and Psychic-type moves from Rabsca and Indeedee-F. On the other hand, Tera Fairy leaves it vulnerable to Steel-type moves from Perrserker and Alolan Dugtrio. Tera Electric is great for boosting Thunderbolt and giving Misdreavus zero weaknesses with its ability. Tera Rock boosts Power Gem, letting it OHKO Charizard and Masquerain.</p> <p>Misdreavus works well on balance teams looking for a catch-all defensive Pokemon to deal with many of the metagame's top threats. It also works great on entry hazard stacking teams since it is not bothered by the top Rapid Spin user, Quaxwell. Misdreavus thrives when given teammates like Carbink, Dachsbun, and Tinkatuff to deal with Dark-types such as Alolan Persian, Houndoom, and Skuntank. These same Dark-type threats, Alolan Persian, Houndoom, and Skuntank, can help deal with Ghost-type foes like Banette, Drakloak, and opposing Misdreavus. Specially defensive walls like Articuno, Carbink, and Tinkatuff form a nice core with Misdreavus since it can cover physical Pokemon that give them trouble, like Lycanroc-N, Perrserker, and Alolan Dugtrio. Knock Off absorbers and status absorbers are highly recommended to keep Misdreavus healthy enough to deal with all of these Pokemon. Status absorbers are the likes of RestTalk Gabite, Dragonair, and Zangoose, while Knock Off absorbers are usually Dark-types like Alolan Persian and Skuntank.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Misdreavus is capable of becoming a fearsome sweeper while still retaining its defensive and utility properties, which allow it to switch into a wide range of threats and spinblock effectively. Calm Mind can be used with Draining Kiss and Tera Fairy to turn Misdreavus into a bulky wallbreaker that is difficult to wear down due to Misdreavus's great natural bulk, HP recovery from Draining Kiss, and immediate access to status moves. Tera Fairy is notable for preventing threats like Nasty Plot Alolan Persian from immediately threatening it, and its toolset lends it easy setup opportunities against Gabite, one of the best phazers in the metagame, as well as other passive targets like Dachsbun and Carbink. Alternatively, Nasty Plot can be used along with either Draining Kiss or Power Gem to make Misdreavus more immediately threatening, with Power Gem primarily targeting Fire-types like Pyroar and Houndoom that it would otherwise struggle with as well as specially defensive Articuno. Hex benefits greatly from Misdreavus's ability to spread status and can be amplified with additional status spreaders on the team; alternatively, Shadow Ball can be used on Nasty Plot sets for greater immediate damage output. Will-O-Wisp is useful for preventing targets like Skuntank and Honchkrow from revenge killing it before Terastallization as well as increasing its ability to take hits from Quaxwell. Thunder Wave is another option that cripples special walls like Articuno and opposing setup sweepers like Masquerain. Substitute can also be used as the last move to facilitate setup on forced switches and prevent Skuntank and Rotom-F from crippling it with Toxic or Trick, but it usually gets more value from spreading status. An alternative EV spread of 128 HP / 128 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature can be used on Calm Mind variants for easier setup and more reliable spinblocking.</p> <p>Misdreavus's effectiveness at spinblocking naturally makes it a great fit on entry hazard stacking teams alongside setters like Whiscash, Carbink, and Masquerain as well as strong wallbreakers like Basculin and Rotom-F. Ground-types like Whiscash and Gabite can reliably switch into offensive checks like Alolan Dugtrio and Houndoom as well as Pokemon that may cripple Misdreavus with Thunder Wave or Encore, such as Tinkatuff and Raichu. Carbink can reliably switch into and deal with Dark-types like Houndoom and Alolan Persian that Nasty Plot variants in particular struggle with greatly before Terastallization, and it can also absorb Knock Off. Gogoat can form an effective bulky setup core with Misdreavus, as they deal with each other's checks, like Basculin and Gabite, respectively, and they pressure mutual targets like Articuno and Carbink better together. Thunder Wave users like Alolan Persian and Tinkatuff can facilitate sweeping for Misdreavus by powering up its Hex; the former can also bring it in safely with Parting Shot and ease the pressure of handling Perrserker, and the latter can create setup opportunities with Encore. In addition, both of these can situationally switch into Knock Off from Pokemon like Banette and opposing Tinkatuff.</p>"

While Mega Steelix's mixed bulk is good, it relies heavily on Assault Vest to check things and is often unable to wall anything long-term; as such, teammates like defensive Arceus formes are recommended to help check foes like Mega Diancie and Palkia-O. A major issue with Mega Steelix is Imposter, as its move selection is very annoying to Imposter-proof, and in slower games where Eviolite is less necessary, Imposter users can use it as a relatively safe source of Regenerator recovery. Fur Coat Arceus-Poison is the most effective all-around Imposter-proof, but Jungle Healing users and Steel-types like Celesteela can also work.</p>"

Waterfall is used over Liquidation to potentially cause flinching, which works wonders in conjunction with Toxic, although Surf can be used for a 2HKO on Sandaconda and more damage on other physically bulky Pokemon like Drifblim and Klawf. Despite Intimidate being such a high-value ability, Qwilfish typically prefers Poison Point to punish U-turn from the likes of Passimian and Scyther while not activating Passimian's Defiant in the process. Protect can be used with Leftovers for some extra recovery and also to scout moves from Choice item users like Rotom, Bruxish, and Zoroark. Upon scouting these Pokemon, Qwilfish can invert its weakness to Electric- or Psychic-type moves with a timely Terastallization to a respective Ground or Dark typing, letting it spread more poison and set more Spikes. Umbreon is a great defensive partner, sponging general special attacks while boasting an immunity to Psychic. In return, Qwilfish heavily punishes Fighting-type attacks and U-turn, while also resisting Fairy. Phasers like Dragon Tail Dudunsparce and Eelektross make great use of the Spikes Qwilfish sets up, racking up damage for a faster Pokemon to more easily sweep.

Intimidate is useful to weaken physical attackers, allowing it to tank strong neutral attacks from the likes of Ursaring and Tauros. Hisuian Qwilfish can also make use of Poison Point to punish contact moves, even generally commitment-free moves like Scyther's and Mesprit's U-turn. Barb Barrage is preferred over stronger options like Poison Jab and Gunk Shot thanks to its high chance to poison, as well as dealing double damage to a poisoned target. Taunt dismantles setup sweepers such as Eelektross while also preventing Defog. Haze is an option over Taunt to prevent setup sweepers like Tera Steel Mesprit and Eelektross from exploiting Hisuian Qwilfish's passivity. Toxic can also be run over Taunt to take advantage of Defog users removing your Spikes and cripple opposing walls like Appletun, Articuno, and Eelektross. Crunch is an extra STAB option that beats Ghost- and Psychic-types like Froslass, Rotom, and Bruxish. Alternatively, Crunch punishes teams that have no grounded Poison-type or entry hazard control. Tera Grass enables Hisuian Qwilfish to set more Spikes against Sandaconda and gives Hisuian Qwilfish a resistance to Volt Switch, allowing it to more easily beat Rotom and Eelektross. Alternatively, Tera Ghost lets it spinblock Cryogonal and Avalugg. 56 Speed EVs allow Hisuian Qwilfish to outspeed maximum Speed Cacturne as well as neutral-nature Abomasnow and Farigiraf; Jolly allows Hisuian Qwilfish to always outspeed the latter two.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Tauros and Mesprit benefit from Spikes weakening checks like Sandaconda and Hisuian Qwilfish that are somewhat easy to put in 2HKO range. To maximize the effect of Spikes and keep them up as long as possible, Hisuian Qwilfish appreciates help from Rotom, Cryogonal, and Articuno, which all put pressure onto Defog users like Braviary and Lurantis. Without Terastallizing, Hisuian Qwilfish folds to Sandaconda and other strong physical attackers that can switch into it like Toxicroak, Hisuian Sneasel, and both Tauros formes. To help solve this issue, Pokemon such as your own Sandaconda, Hattrem, and Drifblim can pivot into their attacks and threaten them with paralysis or burn. Hisuian Qwilfish is hindered by losing its Eviolite via Knock Off or Trick; pair it with Pokemon that can afford to lose their item such as Sandaconda, Sableye, and Sticky Hold Muk.</p>"

This is achievable with Bullet Punch in tandem with Technician, as it revenge kills Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant. Bullet Punch can also remove slower threats such as Hatterene and Tera Fairy Kingambit. Close Combat grants Scizor coverage against Pokemon such as Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Garganacl and provides strong neutral coverage against foes like Rotom-W and Corviknight, especially if not running the corresponding coverage move. Thief is a good way for Scizor to deal a good amount of damage against Gholdengo, while Trailblaze can be used to deal with defensive Water-types like Rotom-W lacking Will-O-Wisp and Dondozo. Tera Steel is Scizor's best option for a Tera type, since it not only gives a boost to Scizor's Bullet Punch but also makes Scizor resistant to Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Tera Electric + Tera Blast can be run to hit Flying- and Water-types such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Corviknight, and Tera Flying Kingambit. 20 Speed EVs are run in order for Scizor to outspeed Corviknight.</p> <p>Offensive teams appreciate Scizor's wallbreaking and revenge killing abilities. Scizor gets easily forced out by Great Tusk as well as Fire-types such as Skeledirge, Cinderace, and Volcarona. Therefore, Water-types such as Rotom-W and Azumarill make for good teammates. Rotom-W in particular synergizes well with Scizor, since the two of them can form a potent VoltTurn core. Azumarill also greatly appreciates Scizor pivoting into it. In return, Scizor can check Grass-types they struggle against like Breloom and Meowscarada. Scizor appreciates teammates that allow it to wallbreak much more easily, so entry hazard support from Pokemon like Garchomp are greatly appreciated. Gholdengo is another good teammate, since it can keep hazards on the field for Scizor to exploit in order to sweep late-game. If Scizor isn't running Thief, it can easily be checked by Gholdengo, so Dark-types like Kingambit pair well with Scizor. However, if Scizor is running Thief, it can struggle against Water-types, so Grass-types like Breloom, Meowscarada, and Tera Grass Volcarona make for good teammates. Scizor's lack of longevity means it can struggle with hazards, so hazard removers like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for good teammates. Most of Scizor's damage output comes from Bullet Punch, so it dislikes Pokemon like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Gholdengo switching into it. Thus, Pokemon that can counter them such as Meowscarada for the former, as well as Iron Moth for the latter two make for good teammates. Finally, setup sweepers such as Dragapult, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon appreciate Scizor muscling through walls like Garganacl, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Ting-Lu. They also appreciate the defensive utility Scizor brings with its ability to check Choice-locked Meowscarada and Calm Mind Iron Valiant.</p>"

Due to its typing, it can check Dragonite, which is a phenomenal offensive threat in OU. Bullet Punch dents Garganacl and Iron Valiant, as well as being able to revenge kill sweepers such as Roaring Moon and Dragonite. Dragonite's Extreme Speed does very little to Scizor in return, and Scizor can break Multiscale on Dragonite. Close Combat nails Kingambit and deals decent damage to Ting-Lu, and while U-turn 3HKOs Ting-Lu, Close Combat can 2HKO if Stealth Rock is up. Alternatively, Defog improves Scizor's matchups against entry hazard users such as Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Thief hits Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Ceruledge for super effective damage, as well as being Scizor's strongest option against Toxapex. Swords Dance can power up Bullet Punch and U-turn, allowing Scizor to break through Garganacl. Tera Steel powers up Bullet Punch, which is key in OHKOing Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock. Heavy-Duty Boots makes pivoting easier by ignoring entry hazards.</p> <p>Scizor best fits on bulky offense and balance teams, as these appreciate a pivot which can force switches to bring in frail wallbreakers. Iron Valiant and Dragapult appreciate the momentum that Scizor provides, as they are 2HKOed by many common attacks. In return, they can handle physical walls that Scizor has trouble getting past such as Great Tusk and Dondozo. Scizor also appreciates entry hazard support from teammates such as Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Ting-Lu, as Scizor puts pressure on the opposing team with U-turn, forcing more switches and helping rack up more damage with hazards. Scizor also suffers from a lack of recovery, so defensive teammates such as Toxapex are appreciated, as they can help take pressure off of Scizor. Dragapult and Rotom-W form a good pivot core with Scizor, with Scizor luring Skeledirge and Dragapult luring Ting-Lu.</p>"

Close Combat is crucial to 2HKO defensive Rotom-W and defensive Great Tusk, as well as blow through Steel-types such as Kingambit and Iron Treads. Tera Blast paired with Tera Electric has a good chance to 2HKO Dondozo and can OHKO Toxapex, Alomomola, Corviknight, and offensive Gholdengo after a Swords Dance. Tera Electric also removes Scizor's Fire weakness, improving its matchup against Volcarona and Iron Moth, and grants it crucial resistances to Roaring Moon's Acrobatics and Iron Valiant's Thunderbolt. Alternatively, Quick Attack with Tera Normal gives Scizor a tool to pick off offensive Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch, such as Volcarona, Quaquaval, and Greninja. 180 Speed EVs allow Scizor to outspeed defensive Great Tusk and Rotom-W, while 76 HP EVs improve its bulk enough to survive Tera Flying Acrobatics from Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Scizor is best utilized on fast, offensive teams that appreciate its ability to wear down common defensive cores and keep opposing sweepers such as Roaring Moon and Booster Energy Iron Valiant in check. Glimmora and Great Tusk can set entry hazards to help chip Pokemon like Garchomp and defensive Gholdengo into range of Scizor's attacks. Grimmsnarl can ease Scizor's sweep by setting up screens and appreciates falling back on Scizor to handle threats such as Iron Valiant. Special attackers like Iron Moth, Gholdengo, Greninja, and Iron Valiant can deal with the physical walls that check Scizor, such as Dondozo, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk. Scizor's ability to lure Dondozo and take it out with Tera Blast makes it an excellent partner for other physical sweepers that struggle with it, such as Dragonite and Kingambit. Conversely, Breloom is an excellent partner for Quick Attack Scizor that handles Dondozo and appreciates Scizor keeping Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Dragapult in check.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Accounting for its diverse movepool, priority options, and huge base Attack, Scizor makes for an incredibly threatening wallbreaker and cleaner on more offensive teams. Furthermore, Scizor's Steel typing and decent bulk also complements its ability to keep many faster threats in check, such as Enamorus, Mega Latias, and Alakazam, while using them as setup fodder. Knock Off allows Scizor to break past Slowbro and Skeledirge while also OHKOing Victini and Ceruledge; it can even prove useful for removing items from several soft checks otherwise reliant on them, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Cinderace and Leftovers from Iron Hands. Dual Wingbeat is usually preferred in the last slot for its coverage against specific physical walls able to blank its other attacks, such as Buzzwole, Mega Venusaur, and Tangrowth, but Close Combat can be used instead to deal more damage to Steel-types such as Skarmory, Magnezone, and Bisharp, putting immense pressure on the former at +2 while OHKOing the latter two unboosted. Quick Attack can also be used to give Scizor an extra priority attack, allowing it to finish off weakened foes that would otherwise resist Bullet Punch, such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Zeraora, although its lack of coverage can leave Scizor to struggle with breaking through the aforementioned defensive targets. Due to its lack of longevity and early- or mid-game prowess, this Scizor set usually fits best on select offensive teams that appreciate its versatility in being able to deal with faster threats. Entry hazard support from the likes of Excadrill and Lead Mew can help push several Pokemon, such as Iron Moth, Tyranitar, and Tapu Fini, into Scizor's KO threshold. Scizor also appreciates specific teammates that can help weaken or take advantage of Fire- and Steel-types, such as Iron Hands, Meteor Beam Nihilego, and Swords Dance Ceruledge, as it can often be dissuaded from sweeping by their presences in a vacuum while they remain healthy. Conversely, other late-game cleaners such as Swords Dance Bisharp, Z-Celebrate Victini, and Dragon Dance Mega Aerodactyl appreciate Scizor's own ability to force damage onto shared checks such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Choice Scarf Keldeo while allowing Scizor to forgo its late-game approach if attacking early may be more optimal for enabling the rest of its teammates.</p>"

        "Bulky Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Scizor's excellent defensive typing, longevity with Roost, and priority in Bullet Punch can let it serve as an excellent bulky attacker, allowing it to reliably check Pokemon such as Alakazam and Mega Latias throughout a game while retaining its ability to sweep with Swords Dance once opposing walls are appropriately weakened. U-turn allows Scizor to provide pivoting support for its teammates on a forced switch, and in conjunction with Buginium Z, it even gives Scizor access to a one-time nuke that prevents it from switching out, allowing it to KO the likes of Amoonguss and Mandibuzz at +2 after slight chip damage. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to remove important items from the likes of Cinderace, Celesteela, Salamence, and Iron Hands, allowing it to finish these Pokemon off more easily. Buginium Z is usually the preferred item for its aforementioned power boost to U-turn, on top of reducing damage taken from Bisharp's Knock Off, but Heavy-Duty Boots is an alternative that offsets Scizor's vulnerability to entry hazards. The given EV spread hits an extra Attack point, allows Scizor to reduce the amount of damage taken from attacks such as Excadrill's Earthquake and Mandibuzz's Foul Play and outspeeds Skeledirge and Skarmory. Scizor's pivoting capabilities in tandem with its ability to check faster threats are appreciated by defensive Pokemon otherwise vulnerable to the overwhelming offensive pressure exerted by them. Walls such as Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Slowbro are particularly helpful in this regard; Ting-Lu can check Fire-types such as Ceruledge and Iron Moth while setting up entry hazards to help Scizor cripple the opposing team more effectively, whereas Rotom-W and Slowbro can help maneuver around Fighting-types in Galarian Zapdos and Buzzwole while providing Scizor with additional pivoting support. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Enamorus, Choice Specs Latios, and Nasty Plot Hydreigon, each appreciate Scizor's ability to provide safe entry with its U-turn or threaten the removal of items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Slowking and Assault Vest from Tangrowth if running Knock Off, helping in return by opening up the conditions required for Scizor to successfully sweep teams late-game. While Scizor can help teams out in checking faster threats, its lack of initial power on Bullet Punch outside of super effective hits, particularly against bulkier targets such as Galarian Moltres and Autotomize Celesteela, can leave a lot to be desired. As such, partners that can deal with these specific Pokemon, such as Mega Tyranitar, Thunder Wave Clefable, and defensive Tapu Fini, manage to help out in this regard.</p>"

Knock Off allows Scizor to remove important items from Pokemon otherwise reliant on them to deter it, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Salamence and Rocky Helmet from Buzzwole and Amoonguss. Pursuit takes advantage of Scizor's excellent typing against several Psychic-type Pokemon to trap them, most notably Mega Latias, Choice-locked Latios, and Slowking. Alternatively, Close Combat and Dual Wingbeat are options to pose a more immediate threat to their respective targets, such as Excadrill and Magnezone with Close Combat and Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur with Dual Wingbeat. Scizor fits best on bulky offense teams that can best take advantage of its strong momentum-grabbing capabilities and cleanup potential. Pivots such as Rotom-W, Cinderace, and Sandy Shocks can help Scizor by threatening the physical walls used to stifle it, including Skarmory and Buzzwole; in return, Scizor can help force damage onto walls that normally handle these pivots, such as Tangrowth and Blissey. Scizor also appreciates strong entry hazard removal options to avoid being worn down quickly, including Defog from Rotom-W, Tapu Fini, and Volcanion and Rapid Spin from Excadrill; the aforementioned Defog users are also capable of taking advantage of Fire-types that may pose a threat to Scizor, such as Cinderace and Ceruledge. On the other hand, entry hazard support from the likes of Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Sandy Shocks is imperative to increase the overall impact of Scizor's pivoting capabilities as well as extend its capacity to revenge kill threats like Galarian Moltres and Dragon Dance Salamence with Bullet Punch.</p>"

U-turn alternatively allows Mega Scizor to function as a potent pivot; It can rack up chip damage while providing free points of entry for wallbreakers, since it switches easily into Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant among others. Roost provides valuable recovery, letting Mega Scizor shrug off chip damage from Stealth Rock and stray Knock Offs. The given defensive EVs allow Mega Scizor to always avoid a 2HKO from Mega Lopunny's Close Combat after Stealth Rock, while the Speed EVs allow Mega Scizor to outspeed uninvested Heatran.  Mega Scizor's Knock Off support is valued greatly by allies such as Hisuian Samurott, which has a much easier time beating checks after they have had their Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots removed. Rotom-W notably forms a strong VoltTurn core with U-turn Mega Scizor, pivoting out on each other's checks to rack up chip damage. Mega Scizor has the added benefit of absorbing Knock Off for its team, so allies like Volcarona and Tornadus-T need not fear their key items being removed.

Close Combat answers Steel teams and threaten slower walls like Ting-Lu and Corviknight. Trailblaze allows Scizor to outspeed threats like Great Tusk and Hydreigon at +1 Speed and hits Quagsire and Gastrodon. Fury Cutter provides an additional Technician-boosted STAB move and is mainly used in tandem with Metronome to break Dondozo. Thief offers coverage and allows Life Orb Scizor to answer Gholdengo and 2HKO Skeledirge thanks to the boost from Technician, though Life Orb isn't recommended outside of these scenarios. Alternatively, Metal Coat enhances the power of Bullet Punch without drawbacks. The EV spread maximizes Scizor's damage output and allows it to outspeed uninvested Rotom forms and Adamant Azumarill.</p> <p>Volcarona is the perfect partner for Scizor, as it's less threatened by Fire-types and can sweep through most Steel, Psychic, and Ground teams. It takes care of Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Klefki; in return, Scizor handles Rock-types like Glimmora and Lycanroc-D and weakens the opposing team to facilitate Volcarona's late-game sweep. Slither Wing offers great coverage against types that Scizor struggles to beat, threatening Electric- and Rock-types with Earthquake, Flying- and Water-types with Wild Charge, and Steel-types with Flare Blitz or Close Combat. Similar to Scizor, Lokix gets two powerful STAB priority moves in First Impression and Sucker Punch which, paired with Tinted Lens, allow it to OHKO faster threats like Greninja, Gengar, and Kilowattrel after chip damage.

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thanks to its high Attack, great defensive typing and solid bulk, Scizor is an effective bulky pivot that can also punish faster foes with Technician-boosted Bullet Punch, such as Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao, Alolan Ninetales, and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Knock Off versus Thief</strong>: Beyond being a fantastic support move, Knock Off is a great option against Gholdengo. Thief does offer more consistent damage than Knock Off though, thanks to Technician.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dual Wingbeat</strong>: Dual Wingbeat is Scizor's best option against Ogerpon-H as well Fighting-types like Annihilape and Urshifu formes. For Choice Scarf sets, it's especially useful for OHKOing Breloom through its Focus Sash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: Close Combat is Scizor's best option to hit opposing Ursaluna-B and Chi-Yu as well as Steel types, even when using defensive EV spreads.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Trailblaze</strong>: Besides gaining a useful Speed boost, Trailblaze does good damage to Urshifu-R and Rotom-W.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization can be quite helpful in either cleaning teams or preparing against Scizor's classic Fire-type issues, the power of its priority and pivoting don't make it needed for it to function consistently.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water turns its Fire weakness into a resistance, giving Scizor a fighting chance against dangerous Fire-types such as Chi-Yu, Iron Moth, and Heatran.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is ideal for more offensive Scizor variants, making Bullet Punch an even better cleaning tool. Tera Steel also softens Scizor's weakness to Fire, letting it avoid the OHKO from attacks like Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Increasing Dual Wingbeat's power with Terastallization nets Scizor some useful new OHKOs against offensive Urshifu formes and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire is a great response most Ogerpon-H sets, and the burn immunity is especially helpful against Heatran.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: While not an incredible defensive typing, Tera Dragon is fantastic against most Fire and Water Pokemon that give Scizor trouble.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: While much less immediately threatening than Choice Band, Assault Vest lets Scizor more comfortably switch into stray special attacks like Gholdengo's and Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball or Rotom-W's Volt Switch, improving its longevity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band</strong>: Choice Band lets Scizor function as a scary late-game cleaner, especially with Tera Steel-boosted Bullet Punch. The high damage output also helps Scizor to break down walls for its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Despite Scizor's low Speed, Choice Scarf with a Jolly nature will make it just fast enough to outspeed key threats like Ogerpon-H and Chi-Yu. Just note that Scizor is still slow enough that Bullet Punch is still preferable over other Steel-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet is perfect for more defensive Scizor, letting it continually switch into weaker physical attacks and wear down the team with U-turn and residual damage.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 92 Atk / 164 SpD with Adamant</strong>: This spread is meant to be used with Assault Vest, letting Scizor almost always avoid a 2HKO from Modest Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball. It also maintains enough Attack investment to always OHKO uninvested Chien-Pao after Stealth Rock chip.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 68 Atk / 204 Def with Adamant</strong>: This spread avoids an OHKO from Tera Dark Life Orb Chien-Pao, is not 2HKOed by Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast, and reduces the amount of residual damage Scizor receives thanks to the HP stat being 1 lower than divisible by 16.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 68 Atk / 204 Def with Adamant</strong>: This bulky spread lets Scizor survive +2 Life Orb Adamant Tera Ghost Mimikyu's Shadow Claw.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: Defensive Scizor might seem strange, but when paired with Rocky Helmet, it becomes an effective pivot that can survive extreme attacks: it avoids the OHKO from Choice Band Tera Dark Chien-Pao's Crunch as well as the 2HKO from Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake. Just note that this will make Scizor focus more on pivoting than revenge killing with Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximizing Scizor's Speed with Choice Scarf will at least speedtie with the rare Meowscarada, and outspeed important threats like Ogerpon formes and Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Slow U-turn</strong>: Scizor already has a very slow U-turn, but Scizor can drop the Speed investment from any spread and run a Speed IV of 27 to underspeed opposing Scizor and the rare Chesnaught.</li> </ul>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Scizor's incredible power and good typing make it one of the premier priority sweepers, being able to sweep through huge threats such as Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: Close Combat lets Scizor smash through Ursaluna-B and Ting-Lu, and 2HKO Corviknight after a boost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off is Scizor's best bet against Gholdengo, in addition to being a great support move in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dual Wingbeat</strong>: After a boost, Dual Wingbeat smashes through bulky Fighting-types like Urshifu-R and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: While pivoting doesn't gel well with sweeping, it makes this kind of Scizor very adaptable, and is especially effective at getting away from Pokemon that threaten with residual damage, like Wo-Chien and Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Trailblaze</strong>: Trailblaze will 2HKO even the bulkiest Rotom-W without a boost and deal good chip damage to Dondozo. The Speed boost also comes in handy considering how crowded Scizor's Speed tier is.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / Low</strong>: Terastallization works very well at shutting down common methods of revenge killing or walling Scizor, but its typing is good enough to function without Terastallization. If using U-turn, Scizor can focus on pivoting in some matches, making Terastallization even less needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water lets Scizor ambush Chi-Yu, Iron Bundle, and Heatran with a resistance and is especially handy against Fire-types when using Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Boosting Bullet Punch is Scizor's best ticket for revenge killing and late-game sweeping, and it retains its Flying-type resistance into powerful Tera Flying Choice Band users like Dragonite and Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire ensures that Siczor's hard work won't get ruined by Will-O-Wisp, in addition to stopping revenge kills from common Fire-types like Ogerpon-H and Heatran.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark can cushion Shadow Ball from Gholdengo and Flutter Mane, giving it an extra turn to set up or hit back with Tera-boosted Knock Off.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric is Scizor's best shot of breaking past Toxapex and Urshifu-R with Tera Blast, and it does good chip damage to Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs</strong>: Sitrus Berry trades late-game sweeping power for new setup opportunities, such as avoiding a 2HKO from Modest Gholdengo that lack Choice Specs and a good chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Timid Rotom-W's Hydro Pump. Make sure to run 244 Speed EVs to gain an even HP number, letting Sitrus activate after getting hit by Ruination once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: While Life Orb does compromise Scizor's bulk, it's worth it for being able to OHKO Iron Bundle with a boosted Bullet Punch. Boosted Close Combat will also OHKO even physically defensive Ursaluna-B, and it has good shot of OHKOing physically defensive Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Best used with U-turn, Rocky Helmet transforms this Scizor into a good bulky pivot that has the surprising option to sweep late-game.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 28 Atk / 204 Def / 20 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This bulky spread avoids the OHKO from Adamant Tera Ghost Life Orb Mimikyu's +2 Shadow Claw. When used with Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs, it also avoids the 2HKO from Modest Gholdengo's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 228 Atk / 20 Def / 20 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This spread gives Scizor enough bulk to survive Tera Dark Life Orb Chien-Pao's Crunch, and less residual damage if using U-turn. It also avoids a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast. With Sitrus Berry, Modest Gholdengo's Shadow Ball is also no longer a 2HKO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 124 Atk / 156 SpD with Adamant</strong>: This Sitrus Berry optimized spread avoids a 2HKO from Jolly Chien-Pao's Crunch, Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, and Modest Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: This defensive spread is best used with U-turn and Rocky Helmet, making Scizor function more like a bulky pivot that can sweep late-game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>60 HP / 252 Atk / 196 Spe with Jolly</strong>: If using Trailblaze, this spread outspeeds Ogerpon formes after a boost.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Slow U-turn</strong>: When running U-turn, Scizor can drop the Speed investment from any spread and run a Speed IV of 27 to underspeed opposing Scizor and the rare Chesnaught.</li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Mega Scizor makes for a strong wallbreaker and sweeper on Steel teams thanks to its access to Swords Dance, high Attack stat, and well-rounded bulk. Bullet Punch is Mega Scizor's strongest STAB move, and its priority allows it to revenge kill faster threats such as Mega Diancie, Iron Valiant, and Mega Lopunny. Close Combat is Mega Scizor's strongest coverage move, enabling it to more easily beat Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. After a Swords Dance boost, Mega Scizor becomes strong enough to 2HKO Celesteela, opposing Mega Scizor, and physically defensive Gastrodon. Knock Off removes essential items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Tornadus-T and Black Sludge from Toxapex, and it also provides Mega Scizor with strong coverage against Aegislash, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo. Alternatively, Trailblaze can also be used to 2HKO bulky Water- or Ground-type Pokemon most other Steel-types struggle with such as Mega Swampert and Gastrodon, as well as potentially OHKO Azumarill and Rotom-W after a Swords Dance boost and Stealth Rock damage. 132 Speed EVs are invested in order for Mega Scizor to outspeed Jolly Azumarill as well as Hydreigon and Urshifu-S after a Trailblaze. Heatran and Ferrothorn are great teammates because they are able to set entry hazards to wear down incoming foes, and Heatran also has the added benefit of providing a Fire immunity thanks to its ability. Ferrothorn can also provide passive healing for Mega Scizor via the use of Leech Seed. In return, Mega Scizor is able to threaten faster Fighting-types such as Sneasler and Iron Valiant with Bullet Punch. Gholdengo is able to threaten Toxapex and Tapu Lele, and it along with Aegislash can also hinder foes with Toxic and Thunder Wave respectively if they are running defensive sets, easing set up for Mega Scizor. In return, Mega Scizor can remove Dark-types such as Meowscarada, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Moltres. Specially defensive Celesteela is an excellent special wall that can wall Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Mega Altaria, while also being able to spread status and use Leech Seed to aid Mega Scizor in its sweeping. As Mega Scizor is more vulnerable to hazards compared to other Steel-types, it appreciates hazard removal from the likes of Corviknight, Excadrill, and Iron Treads. Excadrill and Iron Treads also have the added merit of handling Fire-types like Victini and Ogerpon-H. Excadrill can also bypass Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce and inflict poison on it thanks to Mold Breaker, while Iron Treads can threaten both Landorus formes with Ice Spinner.</p>"

With Mental Herb, it isn't scared to set up entry hazards in front of common Taunt users such as Deoxys-S and Zeraora. Encore shuts down setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor and bulky walls such as Hippowdon and Ferrothorn, locking them into their setup and recovery moves. Shuckle can generate momentum after setting up hazards by using Final Gambit, allowing teammates such as Shell Smash Omastar, Mega Diancie, and Choice Band Tyranitar to come in and start exerting pressure. Toxic can also be used to punish more passive Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Hippowdon. Mega Diancie can bounce back any hazards or status moves directed at Shuckle and provides amazing offensive pressure and coverage against Poison-, Steel-, and Dragon-types. Sticky Web allows Choice Band Tyranitar to outspeed Choice Specs Gholdengo and Nidoking, both of which are threats to Rock. Omastar and Minior benefit from Stealth Rock breaking potential Focus Sashes and are great partners to have in the Grass and Fighting matchups. Thanks to Sticky Web, Omastar outspeeds Sand Rush Excadrill after one shell smash and +1 Spe Nihilego outspeeds Barraskewda in the rain. Power Herb Nihilego is able to sweep teams as well with Meteor Beam and amazing coverage. Thanks to Sticky Web, Choice Scarf Terrakion outspeeds Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Greninja, which are threats to Rock teams. Hisuian Arcanine is able to deal massive damage, OHKOing Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Heatran, Mega Gallade, and Corviknight after Stealth Rock.</p>"

Rock Blast threatens Flying-types such as Enamorus, Salamence, and both Thundurus formes, as well as Fire-types like Iron Moth and Ceruledge that could otherwise take Close Combat and force Mega Heracross out. Pin Missile threatens Slowbro and Mega Venusaur, while Substitute lets Mega Heracross avoid Will-O-Wisp from Mega Sableye, capitalize from the forced switches it generates, and ease prediction against Pokemon it forces out. Physical cleaners like  Swords Dance Scizor appreciate Mega Heracross being able to threaten their switch-ins, such as Skarmory and Mega Venusaur, allowing them to sweep late-game. Mega Heracross is prone to being revenge killed by faster threats like Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Enamorus, so teammates that can deal with them such as Tapu Fini, Mega Tyranitar, and Celesteela, respectively, are appreciated.

Choice Scarf sets are wonderful because they reliably beat Calm Mind Jolteon, a feat most other Choice Scarf users fail to do because they're specially offensive. On the flipside, Choice Band sets retain great revenge killing potential because Hisuian Sneasel is so naturally fast, and they're very effective wallbreakers to boot thanks to their solid coverage. For the Pokemon Hisuian Sneasel can't consistently defeat like Tera Ghost Sandaconda, Qwilfish, and Sableye, Switcheroo provides a good means of limiting their defensive capabilities. Picking its Tera type is fairly arbitrary, though Tera Fighting lets Choice Band Hisuian Sneasel 2HKO Sandaconda with Close Combat and Choice Scarf Hisuian Sneasel 2HKO Toxicroak after Stealth Rock; alternatively, Tera Dark provides defensive utility against Mesprit, ensures Night Slash OHKOes Rotom after Stealth Rock, and denies Sableye's Prankster Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Despite Choice Scarf and Choice Band Hisuian Sneasel being somewhat different in function, their teammates are pretty similar. Both benefit from teammates like Clawitzer, Rotom, and Mesprit that can take advantage of Sandaconda so they feel less inclined to Terastallize and deal with it themselves. Where they differ is that Choice Scarf Sneasel is far more suited as a late-game cleaner and, as a result, is more reliant on wallbreakers like Guts Ursaring, Magneton, and offensive Appletun to weaken its checks. On the other hand, Choice Band Sneasel prioritizes its role as a wallbreaker and supports late-game sweepers like Dudunsparce and Trailblaze Scyther.</p>"

Even some of its sturdiest checks in Sandaconda, Qwilfish, and Tera Poison Appletun can struggle to keep up, and offensive answers like Choice Scarf Mesprit and Rotom become unreliable because they're slower after a single Trailblaze. Tera Grass is fantastic for turning non-Glare Sandaconda into setup fodder and giving Trailblaze the extra power needed to beat Rotom, but Tera Dark enables Hisuian Sneasel to run Night Slash, giving it a better matchup against Ghost-types in Eviolite Haunter, Drifblim, Sableye, and Terastallized Sandaconda while also making it harder for Choice Scarf Mesprit to revenge kill it.</p> <p>Hisuian Sneasel's Eviolite-boosted bulk, although not stellar, is enough to let it set up on resisted attacks. So, pairing it with pivots like Bombirdier, Rotom, and Braviary that can bring it in against foes like non-Thunder Wave Qwilfish, Muk, and non-Glare Sandaconda if you're using Tera Grass is recommended. Keep in mind, though, that the Sandaconda matchup can be difficult with Terastallization available to your opponent; teammates like Tera Ice Jolteon, Swords Dance Scyther, and Guts Ursaring that can force it to take damage or Terastallize early-game make it far less threatening.</p>"

Tera Ghost takes subverting its weakness to the extreme, turning the tables on the many Fighting-types in the tier. 88 Speed EVs outspeed Vaporeon and Umbreon, which hamper Ursaring with Haze or Foul Play. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to allow Ursaring to wall special attackers while boosting Defense with Bulk Up.</p> <p>Although its bulk often prevents it from being outright overpowered, Ursaring's setup attempts can be thwarted by utility Pokemon such as Haze Muk and Vaporeon and Encore Cacturne and Zoroark. Wallbreakers like Medicham and Zoroark and entry hazard setters like Qwilfish and Sandaconda assist in breaking through and wearing them down. Knock Off users like Bombirdier, Klawf, and Passimian can leave Eviolite Ursaring vulnerable to following attacks. Knock Off absorbers like Sandaconda and Umbreon make for great teammates. Because it lacks Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers to offset hazard damage, Ursaring appreciates hazard control from the likes of Drifblim and Lurantis. Pokemon vulnerable to status infliction like Toxicroak and Vaporeon appreciate the fact that Ursaring punishes the use of status moves like Will-O-Wisp from Drifblim and Glare from Sandaconda.</p>"

Guts Facade easily 2HKOes physically bulky Pokemon like Sandaconda and Dudunsparce. Tera Ghost allows Ursaring to effectively bait Fighting-type moves and boosts Shadow Claw, which can be used to hit Ghost-types like Drifblim and Rotom. Swords Dance allows Ursaring to muscle past setup sweepers like Coil Sandaconda, Eelektross, and Curse Muk while also giving Facade enough power to defeat Steel-types like Perrserker and Tera Steel Eelektross. Alternatively, Close Combat immediately threatens Steel-types like Perrserker and Tera Steel users like Appletun and Eelektross. Tera Fighting and Tera Grass are alternative options used to boost Ursaring's other moves.

Healing Wish from Chansey or Indeedee-F can allow Ursaring another opportunity to shred through the opposition. Oricorio-F and Drifblim can ease the matchup against Fighting-types and use Defog to ensure Ursaring takes minimal damage when hitting the field, and Oricorio-F also has U-turn to bring in Ursaring more often.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Piloswine is one of Ice teams' best specially defensive walls, capable of filling some of Ice teams' biggest roles of being an entry hazard setter and Electric immunity. Thick Fat coupled with Eviolite gives Piloswine tremendous bulk, with which it can check dangerous Fire-type threats to Ice such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y by disposing of them with Rock Slide. 12 EVs in Attack guarantees an OHKO on offensive Volcarona. Another one of Piloswine's amazing traits is its Ground typing, which makes it a great asset in the Electric matchup by preventing a Volt Switch onslaught while also letting it hit Electric-types super effectively with STAB Earthquake. Toxic is an option to put defensive switch-ins such as Skeledirge and Rotom-W on a timer, helping Piloswine's teammates overpower them, but Roar is an alternative choice to force out threats that may use it to set up, such as Mega Scizor, and to rack up hazard damage from its Stealth Rock and Cloyster's Spikes to wear down threats such as Urshifu-R and Mega Venusaur. Piloswine appreciates Alolan Ninetales's snow and Aurora Veil, which let it wall the opposition more easily. Piloswine is, however, extremely vulnerable to Water-types, so partnering it with Kyurem or Arctozolt is appreciated, as they can easily break Water teams. Substitute Baxcalibur also threatens Poison teams, which can cripple Piloswine with Toxic. Weavile with a Z-Crystal is also a good Knock Off absorber for Piloswine, as losing Eviolite ruins Piloswine; Weavile also forces immense progress by removing key items from Celesteela and Skeledirge, which become susceptible to Stealth Rock afterwards, or outright breaking through them with a Z-Move. Galarian Darmanitan and Shell Smash Cloyster can threaten Steel teams with Flare Blitz and Hydro Pump or Hidden Power Fire, respectively. The Stealth Rocks and Toxic spread by Piloswine also accentuates the breaking power of teammates such as Swords Dance or Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Belly Drum Cetitan. IronPress Avalugg and defensive Cloyster with Hidden Power Fire are also good partners in being able to shut down Mega Scizor. Avalugg, Articuno, and Cloyster are also capable of removing entry hazards, with the latter two also being able to pivot in Piloswine with U-turn and Teleport, respectively.</p>"

Skarmory also serves as a valuable Spikes user thanks to it being able to set up against threats such as Buzzwole, Blissey, and non-Flamethrower Clefable. The combination of Iron Defense and Body Press is Skarmory’s preferred choice to make progress against teams, as it allows it to stonewall threats such as Scizor, Bisharp, and Tyranitar while also further pressuring threats such as Blissey and Hippowdon. Dropping Iron Defense and Body Press for Whirlwind or Toxic and Brave Bird respectively is also an option on more offensive teams to pressure threats such as Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur more effectively while also offering extra team support by phasing or spreading poison damage. However, this comes at the cost of being far more passive against Excadrill and lacks a proper response to Bisharp and Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar. On stall teams, Skarmory has the choice of running Defog in place of either Spikes or Iron Defense and can also run an EV spread of 248 HP / 76 Def / 184 Spe with an Impish nature to outspeed Choice Band Tyranitar, allowing it to boost or safely heal up before Tyranitar can 2HKO it. Skarmory’s main item of choice is Rocky Helmet to get residual damage off against foes with U-turn such as Scizor and Galarian Zapdos while also chipping setup sweepers such as Mega Tyranitar, but it can also run Shed Shell on bulkier playstyles such as balance and stall in order to avoid being trapped by Magnezone. Skarmory can struggle a lot against special attackers such as Latios and Enamorus, so specially defensive walls such as Blissey, Chansey, and specially defensive Skeledirge are good partners to shore up that weakness. Mega Tyranitar is another good partner, since it can switch into and Pursuit trap threats that pressure Skarmory such as Iron Moth and Hisuian Zoroark. Common pivots that take advantage of Skarmory such as Cinderace, Thundurus, and Thundurus-T also hate being Pursuit trapped by Mega Tyranitar. Skarmory also has issues against Fire-types such as Cinderace and Victini, so bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Alomomola can help deal with them. Electric-types such as Thundurus, Thundurus-T, Sandy Shocks, and Zeraora can also threaten Skarmory, so bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon are good partners to hinder them, but bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur also work as teammates at the cost of being unable to block Volt Switch. The aforementioned Ground-types can also form strong entry hazard stacking cores with Skarmory that bulkier playstyles such as stall enjoy greatly. Offensively, wallbreakers such as Cinderace, Iron Hands, Latios, and Galarian Zapdos make for good partners, since they appreciate Skarmory's Spikes helping them chip their checks so they can wallbreak easier.</p>"

Its immunity to Toxic and Spikes further accentuates its defensive capabilities, making it a very resilient wall. Aside from granting Skarmory an adequate offensive presence, Iron Defense + Body Press lets it beat and contest with Attack-boosting foes like Mega Scizor, Garchomp, and Kingambit that attempt to break past it. Rocky Helmet punishes the physical attackers it’s tasked to check, notably Mega Scizor, Mega Lopunny, and Landorus-T's U-turn and Great Tusk and Excadrill’s Rapid Spin. Tera Dragon allows it to check Mega Swampert, Urshifu-R, Victini, and non-Dragon Claw Mega Charizard X better at the cost of being weaker against Weavile and Garchomp. Tera Fighting lets Skarmory deal with Kingambit more comfortably. The EV spread allows Skarmory to outspeed Mega Mawile and maximum speed Kingambit. Skarmory fits on defensive builds, ranging from balance to stall. Special walls like Garganacl and Hippowdon are necessary to cover threats like Dragapult and Volcarona that would exploit Skarmory's poor special bulk. Hippowdon is an exceptional partner, as it also deals with foes like Zapdos, Tapu Koko, Mega Charizard Y, as well as mixed attackers like Mega Diancie and Iron Valiant. Moreover, they form an entry hazard-stacking core with Skarmory by providing Stealth Rock and spreading further chip damage with Salt Cure, Toxic, and sand to slowly crumble the opposition. Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Iron Hands, and Zamazenta are a few physical attackers that Skarmory can struggle with; Toxapex, Clefable, Tornadus-T, and Skeledirge, respectively, help handle them. Its inability to threaten Gholdengo can be covered by teammates like Kingambit and Clodsire. Late-game cleaners or bulky setup sweepers like Mega Lopunny, Volcarona, and Gholdengo appreciate Skamory's Spikes chipping down their checks like Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Kingambit, respectively; Gholdengo also prevents most entry hazard removal attempts due to its typing and Good as Gold.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its strong offensive typing, access to setup moves, and useful coverage, Houndoom establishes itself as a high level offensive threat in the PU metagame. Fire Blast allows Houndoom to have some extra power and can be especially useful in situations where boosting with Nasty Plot is not possible. It also helps Houndoom to muscle through targets that either are extremely bulky or naturally resist Dark Pulse, such as Tinkatuff. Alternatively, Flamethrower provides a less powerful but more consistent Fire-type STAB attack and eliminates the risk of a missed Fire Blast prematurely ending Houndoom's sweep. Sludge Bomb gives Houndoom a strong special coverage move able to hit certain targets for neutral or super effective damage that would otherwise wall Houndoom handily, such as Carbink, Dachsbun, and opposing Houndoom. Sucker Punch gives Houndoom a safe option against faster, weakened targets that threaten to revenge kill it, such as Dugtrio, Alolan Dugtrio, and Basculin, although one must be wary of these Pokemon's access to their own priority. Trailblaze is another option, allowing Houndoom to remedy its underwhelming Speed and become a much more threatening sweeper, either through a well-timed prediction or by finishing off a weakened target. Heavy-Duty Boots is mandatory on this set to offer Houndoom opportunities to use Nasty Plot, since it is already relatively frail. Flash Fire both sets it apart from and allows it to combat fellow Fire-type attackers such as Pyroar, Charizard, and opposing Houndoom, allowing it to safely switch in on their Fire-type STAB moves while also boosting the power of its own. In a similar manner, it can also take advantage of Will-O-Wisp from targets such as Midreavus and Rotom-S. Tera Dark increases the power of Dark Pulse even further while also removing key weaknesses to Rock, Water, and Ground. Tera Grass offers a resistance to the latter two while also increasing the power of Trailblaze and pairing well with Houndoom's natural Fire immunity. Lastly, Tera Poison increases the power of Sludge Bomb, increasing damage against foes such as Carbink and Dachsbun while also providing a resistance to STAB moves from Pokemon such as Skuntank. Also of note, Houndoom should only use a Hasty nature if it is running Sucker Punch; otherwise, it should use a Timid nature and 0 Attack IVs.</p> <p>Houndoom's greatest challenge is its rather disappointing Speed, especially compared to other Fire-type wallbreakers like Charizard and Pyroar, so a Sticky Web setter such as Masquerain is greatly appreciated. Houndoom also greatly appreciates teammates like Perrserker and Skuntank that can handle Dachsbun and Carbink, especially if it opts not to run Sludge Bomb. Similarly, teammates that can handle bulky Water-types such as Lumineon and Whiscash are welcome, as while Houndoom can do relatively good damage to these Pokemon with Dark Pulse, doing so is extremely risky without a Nasty Plot boost or a defensive Tera. Therefore, Grass-types such as Gogoat and Thwackey are natural partners, with Houndoom especially appreciating the latter's ability to set Grassy Terrain, both allowing Houndoom some passive recovery and lessening the damage from opposing Earthquakes. Fast revenge killers, such as Electrode and Raichu, and Choice Scarf users such as Golduck, are also excellent teammates, as they are able to handily dispose of targets that Houndoom has already heavily damaged.</p>"

Blissey always wants to keep its item, so Knock Off absorbers like Sandaconda and Sticky Hold Muk and Trick absorbers like Choice Scarf Rotom pair well with it. Blissey also enjoys item displacement support, so Knock Off users like Bombirdier and Sableye make for good teammates. If you are running Tera Fairy with Dazzling Gleam and Stored Power, you will lack power against Magneton and Tera Steel Appletun. This opens up room for your own Fighting-types like Hisuian Sneasel and Toxicroak, which also threaten Appletun before Terastallizing.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Blissey's immense special bulk, useful utility moves, and reliable recovery allow it to function as a niche specially defensive pivot, as it checks threats such as Choice Specs Dragapult and Mega Charizard Y. Seismic Toss allows Blissey to pressure anything that isn't a Ghost-type with meaningful damage. Toxic is the preferred option to cripple Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Thunder Wave can also be used to annoy fast threats like Tornadus-T and Iron Valiant. It also allows Blissey to status Steel-types like Kingambit, Heatran, and Kartana. Teleport allows Blissey to safely pivot in teammates like Dragapult, Zamazenta, and Mega Medicham. However, Blissey is an acceptable Stealth Rock user if no other fits on your team. Shadow Ball can be considered as a niche option to break Dragapult's Substitutes and chip offensive Gholdengo, but it usually isn't worth dropping other moves. Tera Fairy gives Blissey a Fighting resistance in exchange for negligible Poison and Steel weaknesses, and it reduces the damage it takes from Pursuit users like Kingambit, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar. This should be used if Blissey absolutely has to take on a Fighting- or Dark-type like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, or Weavile. Blissey's defensive profile makes it a liability into certain Ghost-types, specifically Dragon Dance Dragapult and Gholdengo. Kingambit is a great option that deals with the former two threats while also benefitting from Blissey bringing it in safely with Teleport. Other wallbreakers like Tapu Lele, Dragapult, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Medicham also appreciate pivot support and benefit from Blissey spreading Thunder Wave. A switch-in to powerful physical attackers, like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, and Kingambit, is necessary. Options like Toxapex, Slowbro, Skarmory, and Great Tusk can help out on this front. Knock Off is irritating for Blissey, as losing its Heavy-Duty Boots is quite detrimental to its pivoting efforts. Options such as Flyinium Z Tornadus-T and Gliscor can help out in this regard.</p>"

          "description": "<p>With the highest HP stat in all of Pokemon, an extremely impressive Special Defense stat, and access to important utility moves, Blissey is one of the best special walls in the entire tier, as well as being Normal's best Stealth Rock setter. Seismic Toss is the best move for Blissey to deal consistent damage and not be a completely passive Pokemon despite being ineffective against Ghost-types. Shadow Ball can be used over Seismic Toss in order to not be completely useless against Ghost-types. Stealth Rock helps Blissey's offensive teammates like Ursaluna and Maushold have an easier time getting KOs. Thunder Wave is used to slow down opposing Pokemon so that Blissey's slower, wallbreaking teammates, such as Ursaluna, have an easier time making progress. Alternatively, Healing Wish can be used over Thunder Wave in order to heal one of Blissey's teammates to full health, gaining momentum and making an end-game sweep easier.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Ursaluna and Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark are great teammates for Blissey, as they are capable of dealing with the defensive Pokemon that Blissey is unable to beat, such as Sableye, Toxapex, and Dondozo. In return, Blissey can switch into attacks to keep the wallbreakers safe. Ditto and Blissey make a great pair, as, thanks to Natural Cure, Blissey is able to switch in to status moves that would otherwise cripple Ditto, such as Will-O-Wisp from Sableye, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W, as well as Thunder Wave from Gholdengo, then get rid of the status via Natural Cure. Ditto is also capable of dealing with setup sweepers that would otherwise threaten Blissey such as Baxcalibur and Dragonite. Thunder Wave is also a great option to use on opposing Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant and Meowscarada so Ditto will not have to worry about Speed ties. Hisuian Zoroark is a great teammate for Blissey, as the immunity to Fighting-type moves is extremely valuable. Hisuian Zoroark is also able to burn opposing physical threats like Urshifu-R and Dragonite, which would otherwise make quick work of Blissey, as well as dealing with Ghost-type Pokemon which Blissey cannot damage without Shadow Ball. Hisuian Zoroark's Knock Off can also help Blissey wear down targets by making them vulnerable to entry hazards and removing Leftovers and Black Sludge recovery. Moreover, Hisuian Zoroark can disguise itself as Blissey and catch foes such as Iron Hands, Zamazenta and Sneasler off guard. Cyclizar is a good teammate for Blissey, as Blissey can switch into the fast special attackers that would otherwise threaten Cyclizar such as Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Walking Wake. Cyclizar also carries Knock Off, which, as mentioned previously, works well with Blissey. Choice Specs Cyclizar outspeeds and threatens to OHKO non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, which would otherwise threaten Blissey, with Hyper Voice. Finally, Braviary and Staraptor can function as alternative switch-ins to Fighting-type Pokemon like Quaquaval and Great Tusk and retaliate with their STAB-boosted Brave Bird. Braviary uses Defog to keep Blissey and teammates safe from hazards, while Staraptor is a more offensive Choice Scarf user able to threaten Fighting-type Pokemon.</p>"

This makes Shadow Ball a consistently strong option, particularly after a couple of Calm Mind boosts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast is a very flexible attacking option, giving reliable STAB before Terastallizing and providing new offensive coverage thereafter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fling with Flame Orb</strong>: This is a surprising option to burn common Blissey switch-ins like Great Tusk, though failing to use it right away will force switching out to get rid of the burn. Fling also gets rid of Choice items from Trick users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock remains a trusty support move for Blissey, punishing teams that are forced to switch around Blissey and its teammates.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Fling with Toxic Orb</strong>: This is as close as it gets to Blissey regaining Toxic, though getting badly poisoned is devestating if Blissey is the last Pokemon around, making it a risky option.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Blissey is known for shrugging off big special hits with ease. However, its presence at team preview often attracts hard counters, and Tera is one way of dealing with that.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Dark Tera ruins Espathra's attempts to break through Blissey with Stored Power, at least forcing a Calm Mind war instead of a total loss. Blocking the occasional Psyshock from foes like Nasty Plot Gholdengo is also a plus.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: The Fighting-type immunity comes in handy for Blissey and prevents it from being trapped, though it does become more vulnerable to Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire puts the brakes on Choice Specs Tera Fire Chi-Yu’s wallbreaking parade, ruining its ability to reliably 2HKO Blissey.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: With the Flying Tera type, Blissey gains a handy resistance to Fighting and no longer has to worry about Fissure from Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: As is the case with most walls, Leftovers’ passive recovery is a great supplement to Softboiled and helps Blissey be less passive itself.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak lets Blissey set up against Garganacls that lack Body Press. It also blocks flinches from Chi-Yu’s Dark Pulse as well as the Special Defense drop from Espathra’s Lumina Crash.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD with Calm or Bold</strong>: Beyond making Tera Blissey that much harder to break by foes like Espathra and Chi-Yu, going all-in on Special Defense means less frequent Softboiled uses against special attackers, especially with Leftovers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spd with Bold</strong>: Maximizing both HP and Defense gives Blissey a little extra boost in physical bulk.</p> </li> </ul>"

Soft-Boiled is its essential recovery option that keeps it healthy to continue absorbing damage in the future. Heal Bell, Stealth Rock, and Thunder Wave are Blissey's utility options, allowing it to act as a cleric, entry hazard setter, or status spreader, respectively, to set up its teammates for success. Finally, Shadow Ball is a niche option that prevents Blissey from being passive against Ghost-types like Skeledirge, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Ceruledge. Well-Baked Body can be used instead of Magic Guard, improving its matchup against Fire-types like Magic Guard Volcanion and Heatran, as well as completely walling Skeledirge. Teams that use Blissey should also opt to carry a physical wall like Corviknight, Quaquaval, or Fluffy Landorus-T, as their ability to absorb physical attacks is valuable for preserving it as a special wall. Blissey can offer offensive teammates the ability to thwart their revenge killers with its switching unimpeded by entry hazards and damaging status conditions.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Band Tyranitar is a formidable wallbreaker courtesy of its remarkable Attack and good offensive movepool. Its solid natural bulk further boosted by sand grants it plenty of opportunities to enter the field and wallbreak, such as in the face of offensive threats like Gengar, Noivern, Iron Jugulis, and special Salamence. Offensively, the sand helps further chip down defensive foes like Wo-Chien, Tera Fairy Slowking, and Scream Tail, and it diminishes Tsareena and Florges's Synthesis. Earthquake hits Pokemon like Tinkaton, Bisharp, Pawmot, and opposing Tyranitar super effectively. Ice Punch threatens Ground-types like Hippowdon and Donphan as well as various Pokemon like Salamence, Noivern, and Wo-Chien without risking a Stone Edge miss. Tera Flying allows Tera Blast to OHKO would-be checks like defensive Slither Wing and Paldean Tauros-W, and it gets rid of most of Tyranitar's weaknesses, allowing it to sit on Hippowdon and Quagsire and take on potential revenge killers like Scizor, Slither Wing, Lucario, and Gyarados. Aside from maintaining the sand boost, Tera Rock further skyrockets Stone Edge's power, granting significant odds to OHKO Scream Tail after Stealth Rock and 2HKOing physically defensive Wo-Chien. Tera Blast can still be run for a more reliable Rock-type attack when Stone Edge's power isn't necessary, such as against Talonflame and Iron Jugulis.</p> <p>Tyranitar is perfectly suited for offense and bulky offense teams. Pivots like Slowking, Talonflame, and Noivern can bring Tyranitar in safely on the field to wreak absolute havoc, especially as they tend to invite in Pokemon such as opposing Slowking and Slowbro. Additionally, Slowking’s Future Sight enhances Tyranitar's wallbreaking, while Noivern can overwhelm a shared check in Tinkaton; both of which pressure the likes of Paldean Tauros-W, Slither Wing, Quagsire, and Donphan for it. Slowking and Talonflame also switch into offensive threats that beat Tyranitar, such as Slither Wing, Lucario, and Tinkaton, with Slowking handling Paldean Tauros-W as well. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Tinkaton and Sandy Shocks take advantage of Tyranitar's forced switches and chip down its checks easily. Setup sweepers like Salamence, Lucario, and Gyarados enjoy Tyranitar wallbreaking early-game; it helps pressure Talonflame and Slowbro and overwhelm shared checks like Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Scream Tail for them to sweep more easily.</p>"

        "Dragon Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Tyranitar can sweep by leveraging its bulk, particularly its high Special Defense in sand to find setup opportunities against special attackers such as Noivern, Salamence, and Choice-locked Gengar. Earthquake takes out Rock-resistant foes such as Tinkaton and Sandy Shocks. Substitute provides Tyranitar cover to strengthen its advantage when granted free turns, making it even more difficult to take out, especially with Leftovers keeping it healthy. It also protects Tyranitar against certain status moves, notably Will-O-Wisp from Talonflame and Paldean Tauros-F as well as Toxic from Quagsire. It also provides Tyranitar with protection against priority moves from Scizor and Slither Wing to remove the need to Terastallize versus them. Taunt can be used over Substitute to shut down defensive Pokemon that would otherwise prevent Tyranitar from sweeping such as Roar Hippowdon while still beating Quagsire. Tera Flying Tyranitar beats Quagsire and, if running Taunt, Hippowdon while removing its weakness to priority users such as Slither Wing and Scizor. It can also let Tyranitar gain potential setup opportunities and generate mind games versus Pokemon like Decidueye, Gastrodon, and Pawmot. A Jolly nature ensures Tyranitar can outspeed Gengar, Pawmot, and Sandy Shocks at +1.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Tyranitar fits on a variety of teams, which range from hyper offense to semi-stall. It generally struggles to make progress against bulky Ground-types, as Hippowdon can force it out with Roar or threaten it with Stone Edge, while Quagsire can PP stall it if healthy. Since Iron Defense + Body Press Slowbro is also a problem for it, Tyranitar appreciates support from Grass-types such as Decidueye and Rotom-C. Rotom-C and Decidueye can also bring Tyranitar in on Pokemon such as Noivern and Salamence for setup opportunities. Entry hazard setters such as Sandy Shocks and Gastrodon can help wear down Tyranitar's checks such as Wo-Chien. Sandy Shocks can also provide Tyranitar with setup opportunities against Pokemon like Decidueye, while Gastrodon can provide a secondary check to Pokemon like Salamence and Gengar to help preserve Tyranitar's HP. Sandy Shocks can also potentially use Tera Ice to wear down and pressure RestTalk Wo-Chien for Tyranitar. Scream Tail can provide Tyranitar with Wish support to more consistently check such Pokemon and can deal with Pokemon such as Bulk Up Quaquaval and Paldean Tauros-W that might try to set up against Tyranitar. Wallbreakers such as Paldean Tauros-W and Gengar can wear down checks to Tyranitar like Wo-Chien and Hippowdon. On hyper offense teams, dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl or Psychic Terrain setters such as Indeedee-M can support Tyranitar with setup opportunities and negate revenge killers, while Indeedee-M can also provide Healing Wish support.</p>"

        "Stealth Rock": {
          "description": "<p>Tyranitar is a great Stealth Rock setter with ample defensive utility, checking dangerous special attackers like Gengar, Noivern, and Salamence. Rock Blast is an alternative to Stone Edge that breaks Mimikyu's Disguise and opposing Tyranitar's Substitute, but it is overall less powerful. Earthquake hits would-be switch-ins such as Tinkaton and Bisharp. Dragon Tail can be used over Earthquake to phaze setup sweepers like Oricorio-E and Polteageist, though Tyranitar loses against the aforementioned Earthquake targets. Tera Ground provides an Electric immunity, which is particularly useful against Sandy Shocks; the given Ground typing also provides a stronger Earthquake and allows it to beat opposing Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Tera Flying provides an emergency Ground immunity and a Fighting resistance, both of which help against Pawmot, opposing Tyranitar, and Slither Wing. The Stealth Rock weakness given by Tera Flying also makes Heavy-Duty Boots worth considering; this lets it avoid otherwise crippling entry hazard damage and stay heatlhy longer. Tera Fairy gives Tyranitar a crucial resistance to Fighting, letting it bait the aforementioned foes and shedding its Ground weakness. It also helps Tyranitar to survive Ground-type coverage from faster foes like Haxorus and Salamence. However, Tera Fairy and Flying remove the Special Defense boost given by sand, as well as Tyranitar's immunity to its own sand, making Tyranitar worse against threats such as Gengar, Maushold, and Prankster Grafaiai, so it must be careful when Terastallizing.</p> <p>Tyranitar's excellent defensive utility makes it fit well on bulky offense and balance teams. Tyranitar's weakness to strong physical attackers like Slither Wing and Pawmot makes checks to them like Salamence and Quagsire great teammates; the latter can also form an entry hazard-stacking core with Tyranitar, making it easier to wear down foes like Tinkaton and Wo-Chien. Salamence provides a safer switch-in into Talonflame, preventing it from taking a burn or U-turn chip. Scream Tail appreciates Tyranitar checking Gengar and taking pressure off of it as a check to certain special attackers like Salamence and Iron Jugulis. It can also check the aforementioned physical attackers alongside others like Gallade, and it can provide Wish support to keep Tyranitar healthy as well. Tinkaton can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Talonflame, Slowking, and Sandy Shocks, making Stealth Rock more effective in wearing down the opposition, especially if Tyranitar is paired with a Spikes setter like Sandy Shocks. Tyranitar being checked by bulky Ground-types like Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Donphan makes the likes of Tsareena and Wo-Chien desirable as teammates; Tsareena in particular also gives Tyranitar free entry against Noivern and Gengar via U-turn.</p>"

Pursuit lets Mega Tyranitar threaten to trap and remove foes such as Tapu Lele Choice locked into Psychic, Iron Moth, and Heatran. Additionally, the threat of Pursuit forces foes like the Tapu Lele to play quite predictably, easing the burden for teammates such as Galarian Slowking not having to fear Psychic-type attacks lest they be trapped by Mega Tyranitar. A solid matchup into common Defoggers like Zapdos and Moltres allows Mega Tyranitar to proficiently set up Stealth Rock, while Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots allows its own entry hazards to incur damage easier. The given Speed EVs allow Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Rotom-W. Iron Valiant is an incredible teammate for Mega Tyranitar, as Mega Tyranitar can trap and inflict heavy damage or outright remove Clodsire and Galarian Slowking, which are two of the biggest roadblocks for Iron Valiant. Defensively, Alomomola is very common teammate, as it can keep Mega Tyranitar healthy with Wish + Flip Turn and sponge attacks from Fighting-types it fears such as Mega Lopunny and Great Tusk. Gliscor can give Mega Tyranitar trouble, as once its Toxic Orb has been activated, it can switch in consistently without fearing the item loss of Knock Off while clearing Stealth Rock with Defog, so Ferrothorn, Urshifu-R, and Ogerpon-W are good teammates to assist combatting it.</p>"

Stone Edge is a strong STAB option that OHKOes Iron Moth while denting neutral targets such as Celesteela and Tapu Fini. Pursuit enables Mega Tyranitar to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latios and Blacephalon. Knock Off offers a strong STAB move to OHKO bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types like Hisuian Zoroark and Latios. It is also the strongest move Mega Tyranitar has to hit Slowbro. Superpower is an option to snipe opposing Tyranitar and severely damage would-be switch-ins such as Excadrill. 176 Speed EVs enable Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Celesteela. Offensive Fighting-types such as Buzzwole, Iron Hands, and Keldeo appreciate Mega Tyranitar removing bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types. In exchange, Buzzwole covers Mega Tyranitar’s weaknesses to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, while Keldeo can bring Mega Tyranitar in safely with Flip Turn. Other teammates such as Iron Moth and Tapu Bulu offer some defensive synergy and appreciate Mega Tyranitar’s ability to remove Psychic- and Fire-types, respectively. Mega Tyranitar’s typing gives its weaknesses to prominent attacking types such as Fighting, Water, and Ground, so Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss can provide switch-ins to these types. The Future Sight support provided by the latter meshes well with Pursuit and dissuades Buzzwole and Iron Hands from switching in. Celesteela and Skarmory can help check Excadrill and Buzzwole, with Skarmory providing Spikes as a bonus. Clefable and Tapu Fini can check Fighting-types for Mega Tyranitar to some degree. Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to being chipped down, so partners such as Choice Scarf Latias and Choice Band Scizor can ease the burden against frail sweepers such as Polteageist and Nihilego. Finally, Sand Rush Excadrill benefits from Mega Tyranitar’s Sand Stream and its ability to wear down Skarmory and Hippowdon.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar utilizes its solid bulk and versatile offensive coverage to act as a threatening late-game cleaner. Ice Punch synergizes well with Stone Edge, as it chunks physically defensive Ground-types like Hippowdon and physically defensive Tangrowth. Earthquake is a valuable coverage option to hit Excadrill. Knock Off is an alternative STAB option that hits Gastrodon and Slowbro hard. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Cinderace with a single Dragon Dance. Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar is usually found on bulky offense or hyper offense since these structures provide adequate tools to facilitate setup. The main hindrances for Mega Tyranitar are physically defensive walls like Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Clefable. Teammates like Mewoscarada, Tapu Fini, Swords Dance Scizor, and Meteor Beam Celesteela can take advantage of these Pokemon. Mega Tyranitar can also be revenge killed by common Fighting-types like Buzzwole, Keldeo, and Iron Hands even after a boost. Teammates such as Polteageist and Latios offer valuable typings and can soft-check Fighting-types. In return, they appreciate Mega Tyranitar’s ability to take advantage of specially defensive walls such as Blissey. Offensive Steel-types such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Scizor can cut a Mega Tyranitar sweep short, and thus Fire-types like Cinderace and Iron Moth are excellent partners. Magnezone deserves a special mention, as it traps Scizor and Skarmory. Sand Rush Excadrill appreciates Mega Tyranitar’s Sand Stream ability and in exchange offers insurance against Unaware Clefable. Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to chip damage and thus appreciates pivoting support from Cinderace, Magnezone and Scizor. Slowbro and  Slowking can bring in Mega Tyranitar safely with Teleport and offer Future Sight support for Buzzwole. Finally, Spikes from Skarmory and Mew can wear down walls.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Band Tyranitar is a brutally powerful wallbreaker capable of ripping through common defensive staples such as Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Celesteela. Its absurdly powerful Knock Off and Pursuit combined with its excellent special bulk also make it a premier Pursuit trapper capable of dominating common Psychic-types such as Choice Specs Latios and Slowking as well as physically frail foes like Iron Moth and Blissey. Earthquake targets Rock- and Steel-types such as opposing Tyranitar formes and Excadrill. Aerial Ace is an alternative to hit Fighting-types, notably 2HKOing Buzzwole. Assurance is another option, with it becoming a near-unwallable force when paired with entry hazards and synergizing well with Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots. Tyranitar best fits on offense teams looking for a wallbreaker and Pursuit trapper. It is especially effective at removing special walls such as Blissey, making specially attacking teammates such as Choice Specs Latios and Iron Moth great partners. Pivots, notably specially attacking ones such as Slowbro and the aforementioned Iron Moth, can force in special walls and safely bring in Tyranitar. Entry hazard setters such as Excadrill and Skarmory enjoy Tyranitar's ability to break through most hazard removal options, and it greatly appreciates the chip damage they provide in return, especially if it's running Assurance. Tyranitar is dominated by Fighting-types such as Buzzwole and Iron Hands, making checks to them such as Clefable and Latios mandatory teammates. Sand Stream can notably support Sand Rush variants of Excadrill, and as physical wallbreakers, Tyranitar and Excadrill can weaken their shared physically defensive checks like Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth. While Tyranitar matches up well against many special attackers, it falters against a good deal of them such as Alakazam and Thundurus-T due to its weaknesses, making specially defensive tanks such as Assault Vest Tangrowth useful partners.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Band Tyranitar is the premier physical wallbreaker on Rock teams with its massive base 134 Attack stat and its access to Pursuit allowing it to revenge kill Gholdengo, Latias, and Hisuian Zoroark. Stone Edge deals huge damage to key Pokemon that Rock-types struggle with such as Corviknight, Celesteela, and Mega Venusaur. Knock Off means that Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Slowbro have to be careful when facing Tyranitar, along with removing valuable items from Toxapex and Empoleon. Fire Punch OHKOes the likes of Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, both of which are threats to Rock teams. Earthquake helps with the Steel, Poison, and Rock mirror matchups by hitting Heatran, Clodsire, and Garganacl with a lot of power. Heavy Slam is also worth mentioning, as it can OHKO the likes of Tapu Bulu and Clefable and helps the Fairy matchup a tremendous amount. Ice Punch is an alternative as well, as it threatens to OHKO foes such as Landorus and Gliscor. Additionally, Tyranitar is able to set up sand, aiding teammates such as Garganacl, Cradilly, and Nihilego with a Special Defense boost. A Jolly nature allows Tyranitar to outspeed Choice Specs Iron Valiant outside of Electric Terrain and Mega Diancie while Sticky Web is up and OHKO both with Heavy Slam. This does, however, cause a loss of power, making the Steel and Poison matchups much harder by not 2HKOing Corviknight and Mega Venusaur with Stone Edge. Shuckle can set up Sticky Web, which allows Tyranitar to outspeed threats such as Gholdengo and Nidoking. Mega Diancie is a great special wallbreaker that Tyranitar needs on its team to deal with the Fighting-types that threaten it such as Kommo-o and Great Tusk. Cradily gives Tyranitar a switch-in to Ground-type moves that can reliably take hits and proceed to use Recover to maintain its health while also setting up Stealth Rock. Choice Scarf Terrakion pairs amazingly with Tyranitar by taking the physical wallbreaking load off of Tyranitar and splitting it between the two powerhouses. Terrakion is able to revenge kill Mega Lopunny while also benefitting from Tyranitar's Pursuit trapping ability. As a wall, Garganacl appreciates Tyranitar removing Leftovers from Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Ting-Lu. Ogerpon-C creates additional pressure in the Ground and Water matchups, complementing Tyranitar's power with great coverage. Nihilego helps with Tyranitar's weakness to Fairy-types, providing great Special Defense in sand, as well as Poison coverage. Although Tyranitar has great bulk, Rhyperior and Omastar are better checks to Scizor, a huge threat to the Rock type. Rhyperior's great bulk and ability allow it to beat Scizor, while Omastar's neutrality to Steel-type moves allows it to beat Scizor one-on-one.</p>"

Flare Blitz and Brave Bird are reliable STAB moves that deal great damage against the majority of the tier. Magic Guard negates recoil from these moves in addition to various forms of passive damage, such as Stealth Rock and poison. V-create is an option that allows Ho-Oh to have more immediate power over Flare Blitz, notably 2HKOing non-Fur Coat neutral Arceus formes, at the cost of lowering Ho-Oh's defenses and Speed after use. Also, V-create only has 8 PP compared to Flare Blitz's 24, which can cause issues in longer games. Fire Lash is another alternative that allows Ho-Oh to pressure passive walls like Dondozo more easily though consecutive Defense drops, eventually forcing these foes out. Tidy Up and Mortal Spin both serve as hazard removal, and each come with their own advantages. Tidy Up allows Ho-Oh to set up and potentially sweep, and it also somewhat mitigates the stat drops from V-create if it is used. Meanwhile, Mortal Spin applies more pressure to opposing walls, with poison helping to wear them down over the course of a game. Alternatively, Head Smash can be used to nearly OHKO Imposter users that lack Eviolite; otherwise, Ho-Oh risks being walled by its Imposter. Furthermore, Head Smash is Ho-Oh's best move to hit Mega Diancie, cleanly 2HKOing it. Strength Sap pairs well with Magic Guard to give Ho-Oh incredible longevity, ensuring that it can serve as a long-term check to opposing Fire- and Fairy-Types like Arceus-Fire, Arceus-Fairy, and Choice Specs Mega Diancie locked into Boomburst. Ho-Oh can struggle to defeat bulky Dragon- and Water-types such as Fur Coat Miraidon and Dondozo, so offensive teammates such as Mega Diancie and Kartana are appreciated. Ho-Oh also enjoys entry hazard and Knock Off support to push checks into 2HKO range, as well as allowing Head Smash variants to defeat Imposter users more easily. Ho-Oh can be Imposter-proofed by the aforementioned Fur Coat Miraidon and Dondozo, as well as by Fur Coat Arceus formes, although they should all ideally have some move to punish the Imposter user from simply staying in and setting up.</p>"

V-create's high Base Power coming from Ho-Oh's respectable Attack helps reduce Ho-Oh's passivity and forces switches, while Lava Plume provides a high-PP alternative that can cripple Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo X with burns. Haze clears stat boosts from setup sweepers like No Retreat users and Arceus formes. Ho-Oh serves as a good user of Mortal Spin with its STAB moves threatening out Steel-types. Glare cripples Magic Guard Mega Mewtwo X on V-create sets. Knock Off removes important items like Covert Cloak and Eviolite from switch-ins like Miraidon and Imposter users, respectively. Teleport is an option to generate momentum and allow Ho-Oh to safely bring in allies against threats it cannot take on, such as certain Take Heart Arceus formes. Ho-Oh is threatened by certain special attackers such as Mega Diancie with a Rock-type move, Palkia-O, and Primal Kyogre; as a result, teammates such as Arceus-Poison and RegenVest Primal Kyogre make good partners. Ho-Oh also can have trouble against bulky setup Pokemon such as Miraidon and Take Heart Arceus formes, making Pokemon like Dialga-O, Salt Cure users, and Covert Cloak Imposter users good teammates. Fur Coat Dialga-O, Arceus-Poison, and Arceus-Ghost help check physical wallbreakers that break past Ho-Oh and can also absorb Knock Off, which is useful considering that Ho-Oh ceases functioning as a wall without its item. Ho-Oh can be Imposter-proofed by Pokemon like Fur Coat + Take Heart Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Ghost, though a Fire-immune Steel-type like Primordial Sea Registeel can be used to block the Imposter user's Mortal Spin.</p>"

Flip Turn provides momentum against defensive checks such as Tera Water Skeledirge, Slowbro, and Rotom-W. Alternatively, Superpower hits Ferrothorn and secures a KO on Kartana, while Stealth Rock takes advantage of forced switches. However, losing Flip Turn's momentum can be harmful for rain teams, since they have a limited number of weather turns to take advantage of. Pelipper sets rain for Mega Swampert while also acting as a slow pivot, granting it free switches. Ferrothorn sets entry hazards to weaken foes for Mega Swampert, checks opposing rain teams featuring faster Swift Swim users such as Barraskewda and Floatzel, and switches into foes such as Dragapult. If Mega Swampert runs Stealth Rock, Ferrothorn can take advantage of the extra moveslot to run more utility options. Mega Swampert struggles against foes such as Ferrothorn and Tangrowth, so it appreciates Tornadus-T handling them. Tornadus-T also switches into Grass-type moves for Mega Swampert, helping alleviate its massive weakness against foes such as Kartana.

Earthquake nails Water-resistant foes like Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra, and Water Absorb Clodsire as well as Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Iron Hands, and Zeraora. Furthermore, with sufficient chip damage, it's capable of overwhelming Ferrothorn and Gastrodon. Waterfall is nicely complemented by rain as it outdamages Ice Punch when combatting Flying-types like Zapdos and Corviknight. Waterfall is notably preferred over Liquidation due to its higher PP and potential to break through walls, such as the aforementioned Corviknight, via flinching. Ice Punch targets Dragon- and Grass-types like Dragonite, Latias, and Tapu Bulu due to their resistances to Mega Swampert's STAB combination. Flip Turn allows Mega Swampert to escape unfavorable situations and form pivoting cores with teammates like Pelipper, Greninja, and Barraskewda. Alternatively, Stealth Rock may be used to take advantage of Mega Swampert's ability to force switches, while other options such as Stone Edge and Toxic may be used to threaten Mantine, Pelipper, and Rotom-W which wall it otherwise. A Jolly nature is preferred to outpace Choice Scarf Thundurus-T, Volcarona after one Quiver Dance, and opposing Mega Swampert. However, an Adamant nature may be used for higher damage rolls against Kommo-o, Mega Venusaur, and Gastrodon. Pelipper is a perfect teammate, as it provides rain with Drizzle, slowly pivots into Mega Swampert with U-turn, and removes entry hazards with Defog. In return, Mega Swampert provides an immunity against the aforementioned Electric-type moves and threatens Rock-types such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie. Toxapex provides a buffer against Grass-types like Rillaboom and Meowscarada as well as Kommo-o while also providing Toxic Spikes to enhance Mega Swampert's wallbreaking capabilities. Furthermore, Toxapex appreciates Mega Swampert forcing out Heatran and Gholdengo, as they easily take advantage of Toxapex's passivity. Urshifu-R and Barraskewda deal with threats like Ferrothorn, Hydreigon, and Kyurem, while Mega Swampert removes Toxapex and Water Absorb Clodsire. Other Swift Swim users like Basculegion-F and Barraskewda take on threats like Slowbro and Tapu Koko outside of rain, respectively. Greninja provides speed control outside of rain and beats Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu and Alolan Ninetales with Gunk Shot as well as overloads shared Water-resistant foes like Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur with a Choice Specs set.

Its slow U-turn allows it to give its more offensive teammates safe switch-ins. Damp Rock extends Pelipper's rain, giving its teammates more turns to make use of the weather. Tera Water is used to power up Pelipper's already strong Surf in a pinch, but Tera Ground is an option that lets Pelipper safely pivot on a predicted Volt Switch from Rotom-W or Iron Treads. 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature are used to give Pelipper the slowest possible U-turn, allowing it to potentially move after opposing Pelipper. A Sassy nature can be considered alongside maximum Special Defense investment to allow Pelipper to survive neutral hits from special attackers like Iron Valiant and Enamorus more reliably.

A Modest nature is preferred to deal as much damage as possible with Pelipper; however, a Timid nature is an option to outspeed Sylveon and neutral nature Breloom as well as some Dragonite and Great Tusk spreads that look to outspeed Iron Moth at +1.</p> <p>Even though Pelipper's rain does not stay up that long without Damp Rock, there are still many offensive Pokemon that appreciate the weather. Iron Jugulis, Greninja, and Walking Wake excel in the rain, giving the former a perfectly accurate Hurricane and the latter two stronger Water-type attacks. Iron Jugulis and Greninja are particularly good teammates because they pressure Slowking, which not only walls Pelipper but also removes its rain with Chilly Reception. Defensive Grass- and Ground-types like Amoonguss, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads complement Pelipper well, dealing with any Electric-type attacks thrown its way. Special setup sweepers like Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Calm Mind Hatterene take great advantage of Pelipper wearing down or outright eliminating opposing special walls. Pelipper also appreciates pivot support from Pokemon like Scizor and Dragapult to get it in safely.</p>"

          "description": "<p>The ability Drizzle and access to U-turn allow Pelipper to be the best rain setter in the tier, thus a staple on rain teams. 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature allow Pelipper to pivot teammates in safely with the slowest possible U-turn.. Its decent physical bulk alongside Scald lets Pelipper check and threaten to cripple popular offensive presences like Urshifu-R and Mega Lopunny, as well as Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Heatran. Roost keeps Pelipper healthy throughout the course of the game, enabling consistent rain and better longevity against threats such as Urshifu-R. Hurricane can be used to hit foes such as Urshifu-R, Tera Grass Heatran, and most notably, Ogerpon-W, for super effective damage, while Defog is an alternative that removes entry hazards if common partners in Tornadus-T or Zapdos lack it. Tera Ground is used to change Pelipper's 4x weakness to Electric into an immunity to potentially absorb Volt Switch from Tapu Koko or Rotom-W and pivot out. Pokemon that need rain to boost their strength and Speed such as Mega Swampert, Barrsekwda, Battle Bond Greninja, and Urshifu-R are great partners for Pelipper. They particularly appreciate Pelipper being able to bring them onto the field safely and often into a winning position via a slow U-turn. Mega Swampert also serves as a bulky Electric-immune Pokemon that can check Tapu Koko for Pelipper. Other pokemons like Zapdos and Tornadus-T also benefit from the rain Pelipper sets up and can act both as excellent wallbreakers or entry hazard removers. Furthermore, Ferrothorn and Archaludon can take advantage of Pelipper's typing defensively, with the latter's signature move in Electro Shot pairing especially well with rain.</p>"

Hurricane is the STAB move of choice, bypassing the accuracy check in rain while nailing Water-resistant Grass-types, such as Amoonguss, Meowscarada, and Breloom. Roost allows Pelipper to come in multiple times throughout the match to re-set rain if need be. U-turn let's it slow pivot into threats such as Quaquaval and Barraskewda. Knock Off cripples foes, while Surf gives a secondary STAB move boosted by rain, allowing Pelipper to wear down Pokemon like Gholdengo and Kingambit. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to switch in and set rain even if Stealth Rock is up. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 48 Def / 212 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Breloom.</p> <p>Barraskewda is the obvious partner choice thanks to its ridiculous Speed with Swift Swim in rain. It also appreciates Pelipper's slow pivoting with U-turn due to its lack of bulk. Walking Wake is another great rain attacker, since its STAB Dragon-type moves hit most Water-resistant and immune foes, such as opposing Gastrodon and Amoonguss, hard. Quaquaval appreciates Pelipper's slow pivoting to come in safely and can potentially snowball through teams with rain-boosted Aqua Step and Moxie. Quaquaval can also get rid of entry hazards should Pelipper get hit by Knock Off, provided it has Rapid Spin. Gastrodon and Quagsire are also really good partners thanks to their Electric immunities. Both also provide entry hazards, pressuring opponents, and Pelipper can use hazard removal turns to pivot out with U-turn or heal with Roost. Rotom-W can form a VoltTurn core with Pelipper, allowing the team to gain momentum easily and bring in Pokemon fairly safely. Rotom-W can also switch into opposing Electric-types like Magnezone, Iron Hands, and Sandy Shocks if necessary. Toxapex provides a Fighting resistance, a Grass neutrality, and another pivot thanks to its ability, Regenerator. Slowking checks threats such as Indeedee and Walking Wake, and it's another slow pivot thanks to Chilly Reception and Regenerator, bringing Pelipper in safely to set the rain. Both Toxapex and Slowking can also easily pivot into Pelipper with Eject Button, since Regenerator means they won't lose too much health from an attack. Azumarill can take advantage of rain with priority in Aqua Jet, as well as bringing a very strong Water-type STAB move.</p>"

Masquerain's fourth moveslot is very flexible; U-turn can be used to pivot into a partner Pokemon after setting up Sticky Web and Quiver Dance can make Masquerain more offensively threatening after setting up Sticky Web. Ice Beam can OHKO Dartrix and Gabite, but it is hard to fit, as Masquerain normally finds more usage out of U-turn and Quiver Dance. Masquerain can Terastallize into the Ghost type to prevent spinners such as Quaxwell and Carkol from removing its Sticky Web.

Tera Fighting allows Breloom to 2HKO Amoonguss after Stealth Rock with Close Combat and revenge kill threats such as Cinderace from higher health with Mach Punch. Alternatively, Tera Grass turns Bullet Seed into a powerful nuke that can break down common switch-ins like Gholdengo and generally increase its damage output, turning Breloom into a very potent stallbreaker.

Great Tusk in particular appreciates its tendency to force in Gholdengo and pop its Air Balloon, while teammates such as Garganacl, Toxapex, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo can deal with Breloom's faster offensive checks, such as Dragapult, Volcarona, and Iron Valiant. On more hyper offensive teams, Breloom is best paired with sweepers like Volcarona and Iron Valiant that appreciate its ability to wear down key defensive threats such as Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo. On these teams, leads such as Glimmora can set hazards to aid Breloom's wallbreaking capabilities.

Swords Dance allows Breloom to not only power up its STAB moves but takes advantage of the setup opportunities that Spore can provide. Bulldoze, however, can apply pressure to Poison-types such as Skuntank and Toxapex while also putting the foe at a potential Speed disadvantage.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Paldean Tauros-F and Lucario appreciate Breloom's ability to potentially impede their checks such as Toxapex, Dondozo, and Quagsire, giving them ample setup opportunities. Paldean Tauros-F handles the Dark matchup fairly easily thanks to it avoiding being burned by Sableye while also resisting Meowscarada's and Chien-Pao's STAB moves. Lucario can threaten Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant with its STAB Bullet Punch. Assault Vest Iron Hands is another great partner that can handle the special attacking Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene while also handling Flying-types such as Dragonite and Iron Jugulis which could otherwise threaten Breloom out. Entry hazard control from Great Tusk is imperative to allow Breloom to keep its Focus Sash intact. Great Tusk also helps Breloom by providing Stealth Rock, which racks up chip damage with the switches Breloom can force. Gallade is a great partner that can threaten Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Toxapex. Iron Valiant is another fantastic partner for Breloom, providing Future Sight support to ward off the Poison-types that like to switch into both of Breloom's STAB moves. Its Fairy STAB moves also ease the Dark and Dragon matchups as well as being quite useful in the Fighting mirror.</p>"

        "Focus Sash (Grass)": {
          "description": "<p>Thanks to its high Attack, great ability in Technician, and a STAB priority move, Breloom is a staple on Grass teams as a late-game cleaner. Besides boosting Mach Punch, Technician provides Grass teams with powerful Rock-type coverage in its Rock Tomb. These two moves and Focus Sash allow Breloom to handle an assortment of major threats to grass teams, including Volcarona, Chien-Pao, Iron Jugulis, Kilowattrel, Choice Specs Greninja, and Kingambit. With Bullet Seed or Close Combat, it also can function as a good wallbreaker. Spore is an amazing utility move to stop threats and force out Pokemon like Skeledirge. However, with the use of other Spore users like Amoonguss and Toedscruel, Spore can be replaced with Swords Dance. With it, Breloom can set up when opponents predict it will use Spore, increasing its late-game cleaning potential. An Adamant nature is standard, but Jolly Breloom can outspeed Adamant Dragonite, Adamant Cetitan, and Choice Specs Pelipper.</p> <p>Other offensive teammates like Meowscarada and Rotom-C benefit from Breloom forcing out threats with Spore or breaking through Pokemon like Toxapex, Corviknight, or Ting-lu with its high Attack stat and Spore. In exchange, Meowscarada handles Psychic-types such as Gallade and Espathra. Setup Pokemon like Substitute Rotom-C work especially well with Breloom, as they can come in freely on a slept enemy or a physical wall Breloom draws in. The type's more passive defensive Pokemon also support Breloom, with Amoonguss dealing with Fairy-types and Wo-Chien, by using Leech Seed on a foe, allowing chipped Breloom to switch in and restore its Focus Sash protection. Breloom also enjoys Spikes or Toxic Spikes Brambleghast or Toedscruel to chip foes into KO range, including Toxapex and Iron Hands after a Swords Dance. Aurora Veil from Abomasnow can increase Breloom's chances to set up with Swords Dance. Breloom is weak against bulkier Pokemon with multi-hit moves, which can instantly KO it through Focus Sash, like Icicle Spear from Baxcalibur. Thus, entry hazards to wear them down and physical walls, like Body Press Abomasnow, are very important. Once chipped, Breloom's frailty and low Speed make it weak to faster priority users and to other offensive Pokemon not bothered by Mach Punch. To handle the latter, such as Flutter Mane and Paldean Tauros-B, faster teammates like Choice Scarf Meoscarada and Rotom-C can be very helpful.</p>"

Loaded Dice Breloom, however, does like Terastallization covering up its iffy defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: With Tera Blast, Tera Fire provides an alternative way to get past Gholdengo, avoids getting burned by other foes, and gives bulkier Breloom a chance against Flutter Mane and Focus Sash Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is a good choice for picking off foes more easily with Mach Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Bullet Seed's boost from Tera Grass means it will OHKO Chien-Pao through its Focus Sash if Breloom rolls at least three hits.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock</strong>: Besides boosting Rock Tomb's damage output, Tera Rock prevents Sandstorm from breaking Breloom's Focus Sash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground-boosted Bulldoze has a 93.8% chance to OHKO 4 HP Gholdengo, making Breloom a situational lure. It also severely punishes Rotom-W that attempt to Volt Switch out, and Hippowdon that don't Terastallize.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Since Breloom's bulk isn't very good, Focus Sash is the most reliable way to fire off Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Loaded Dice</strong>: Guaranteeing 4 hits from Bullet Seed can be quite useful for bulkier Breloom sets, clinching an OHKO on Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao, and Iron Bundle regardless of them running Substitute or Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe</strong>: If using Focus Sash, maximizing Speed is important to deal with slower foes that might invest in Speed, such as Corviknight and Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 180 Atk / 76 SpD</strong>: This bulkier spread makes sense if using Loaded Dice and Swords Dance, letting Breloom survive one hit from Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, or Choice Specs Flutter Mane with the correct Tera type.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, do note that this set is very susceptible to Taunt and Encore, which can make it difficult to even select Breloom in the team preview phase.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect gives Breloom an opportunity to scout out its opponents and further stall them out once Leech Seed has been set up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Timer Stalling</strong>: If you obtain a numerical advantage early in the match, you can utilize Breloom to win on timer. This is particularly effective since the Leech Seed damage happens after recovery from Leftovers and Poison Heal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze</strong>: Bulldoze allows Breloom to further support its teammates and threaten Gholdengo, which likes to absorb status moves. Do be wary that many Gholdengo are Tera Flying, which can render Breloom ineffective versus it.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic can be difficult to fit into the set, but it allows Breloom to punish Tera Grass foes that attempt to circumvent Breloom's Spore and Leech Seed.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: While Breloom's typing does have some useful resistances, its low bulk means more favorable resistances granted by Terastallization can be key to setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: This defensive Tera type allows Breloom to resist Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear and Skeledirge's Torch Song, both of which are threats to Substitute. It also helps against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, though note that Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Tera Fire Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: This Tera type allows Breloom to resist Ice- and Fire-type attacks while also providing Breloom with a Fairy-type resistance. With Toxic, Breloom is able to fight back against common Grass-type switch-ins. However, this type has more weaknesses when compared to Water.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread allows for maximum physical bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>156 HP / 100 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread allows for maximum Speed and can survive a Choice Band Extreme Speed from Tera Normal Dragonite after Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>204 HP / 164 Def / 140 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread hits a Speed stat of 108 which ties 4 Spe Adamant Baxcalibur. Furthermore, the defensive investment means that after Terastallization, Breloom's Substitute has a high chance of surviving three hits from Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear.</p> </li> </ul>"

Knock Off cripples switch-ins by removing their items; however, it can't remove a Booster Energy from an opponent with the Protosynthesis or Quark Drive in Sun or Electric Terrain, respectively, as it's consumed before Hariyama gets to move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Drain Punch</strong>: Close Combat is the stronger move but at the cost of cutting into Hariyama's bulk with each use. Drain Punch can fail to get a 2HKO on specially defensive Ting-Lu more than 90% of the time, but it provides Hariyama with some recovery, bolstering its bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Headlong Rush</strong>: Headlong Rush drops Hariyama's defenses with each use, but it 2HKOes defensive Toxapex and Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch gives Hariyama a strong option to hit Dragonite with and can catch it by surprise, considering it isn't pressured to Terastallize against Hariyama's other moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam</strong>: Heavy Slam, coupled with Tera Steel, provides Hariyama with a strong move against lightweight foes such as Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, Mimikyu, and Terastallized Iron Moth and Volcarona that doesn't drop its defenses.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Hariyama can work without Terastallization, it can provide an extra kick to its coverage or improve its defensive presence against certain threats.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel Tera gives Hariyama STAB on Bullet Punch, a resistance to Fairy, Psychic, and Steel, and an immunity to Poison, greatly improving its matchup against Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, Psychic Chi-Yu, Gholdengo, and Tera Fairy Iron Moth and Volcarona. Thanks to Thick Fat, it can take on non-Choice Specs variants of Chi-Yu even after Terastallizing if it's kept healthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Besides the burn immunity, Tera Fire capitalizes on Hariyama's Thick Fat, discouraging threats like Tera Fire Chi-Yu and Choice Band Chien-Pao from using their most powerful moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: While Tera Fighting doesn't provide anything defensively for Hariyama, it makes Close Combat a force to be reckoned with.</p> </li> </ul>"

Drain Punch is weaker, but the recovery can help offset the burn damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Headlong Rush</strong>: Earthquake complements Hariyama's coverage nicely, hitting Poison-types that resist Close Combat. Headlong Rush is stronger, but comes with the drawbacks of lowering defenses and being a contact move, triggering Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch is Hariyama's best hope of hitting Dragonite, as it doesn't fear much from Hariyama's other moves.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Terastallization gives a much appreciated boost to Bullet Punch, but it isn't necessary on every match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Terastallizing into the Steel-type turns Hariyama's Fairy and Psychic weaknesses into resistances along with giving STAB to Bullet Punch.</p> </li> </ul>"

Sableye also blanket checks many setup sweepers in the tier as well, such as Dudunsparce, Ursaring, Coil Sandaconda, and Coil Eelektross, with Encore. Knock Off allows Sableye to punish Pokemon that may rely on their items for their bulk or longevity on a switch such as Hisuian Qwilfish, Eelektross, Ursaring, and Bombirdier. Foul Play is a reliable source of damage against physical setup sweepers, such as Scyther and Bruxish, over options such as Knock Off or Will-O-Wisp. Tera Poison gives Sableye an immunity to Toxic and a resistance to Fairy while retaining its positive matchup into Fighting-types. Tera Steel has a similar function but instead retains Sableye's favorable matchup into Psychic-types while giving it some additional resistances to common attacking types such as Ice from Pokemon like Abomasnow. Tera Dark is notable for letting Sableye OHKO Pokemon such as Rotom and Bruxish with Knock Off while providing Sableye with a Ghost resistance.</p> <p>Sableye struggles with the tier's myriad of Dark-types such as Cacturne and Bombirdier, which all ignore Prankster, while Tera Dark users such as Toxicroak, Hisuian Sneasel, and Bruxish can also Terastallize to completely ignore Sableye and use it as setup fodder. To help alleviate this issue, Pokemon like Hisuian Qwilfish, Carbink, Articuno, and Appletun can all help answer these threats. In addition, Sableye is fairly passive in nature with horrible special bulk, which means it can invite special wallbreakers such as Clawitzer and Glaceon. Pairing Sableye with special walls such as Blissey, Eelektross, and Muk can help make up for these faults.</p>"

Thanks to Magic Bounce, Mega Sableye is able to effectively stop entry hazards from the likes of Skarmory and Sand Rush Excadrill from going up on its side of the field, and thanks to its Ghost typing it can block Rapid Spin from Excadrill as well. Knock Off is used for its ability to remove items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from targets like Celesteela and Cinderace, causing them to be worn down more easily. Will-O-Wisp allows Mega Sableye to cripple physical attackers such as Excadrill and Iron Hands with a burn. It can also be used against Pokemon unbothered by Knock Off like Mega Venusaur to slowly wear them down. The final moveslot is typically given to Protect, allowing Mega Sableye to safely get its Mega Evolution off as well as scout the intentions of Choice item users like Enamorus and Keldeo. Toxic is an alternative to status Pokemon that do not mind Will-O-Wisp like Cinderace and Nasty Plot Hydreigon. Prankster is chosen as the pre-Mega ability on Sableye, allowing it to burn a boosted physical threat in case of emergency. Mega Sableye struggles with strong special attackers, and as such appreciates specially defensive teammates like Blissey, Ting-Lu, and Gastrodon. Its lack of passive recovery in tandem with Recover’s meagre PP means it can get worn down by repeated hits and chip damage from sand. Therefore, Wish passers like Blissey and Clefable will greatly improve its longevity. Mega Sableye can get statused through Magic Bounce by moves like Sludge Bomb and Scald and thus appreciates cleric support from Chansey or Clefable.

          "description": "<p>Sableye is a good choice for Dark teams due to its Fighting immunity, great array of utility moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Taunt, and reliable recovery, letting it disrupt opposing teams and assist its teammates in either breaking through opposing teams or staving off attacks. Prankster Will-O-Wisp lets Sableye neutralize threats to Dark-type teams such as Great Tusk and Dragonite by burning them before they can make a move. Taunt lets it shut down set up attempts from Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Bulk Up Corviknight or hinder opposing defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex and Clodsire. Taunt also blocks entry hazards from going up, which is huge for Dark due to its lack of entry hazard control. Alternatively, Encore lets Sableye halt the aforementioned setup attempts and gain more momentum from them. Knock Off capitalizes on the switches that Sableye forces by knocking off crucial items from Pokemon such as Toxapex or Dondozo. Alternatively, Night Shade deals steady damage throughout the game. Finally, Recover gives Sableye longevity to continually check the aforementioned threats. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Sableye come in and out without worrying about residual damage from entry hazards.</p> <p>Some great teammates for Sableye include Skuntank and Kingambit, as both of them boast a critical neutrality to Fairy that lets them take hits such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant's and Flutter Mane's Moonblasts and force both out. In return, Sableye can complement Skuntank's chip damage from Toxic Spikes through its utility moves and ease Kingambit's setup through item removal and spreading burns. Ting-Lu is another good teammate, as it can set entry hazards to further wear away at the opposing team while also acting as an emergency soft check to Fairy-types if it is running Heavy Slam. Reciprocally, Sableye can accentuate the effect of Ting-Lu's entry hazards by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and taking Fighting-type moves such as Slither Wing's and Great Tusk's Close Combats. Chien-Pao, Meowscarada, and Greninja all greatly appreciate Sableye's ability to grind down the opposing team with Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp, while also liking Sableye's ability to hinder walls such as Toxapex and Dondozo and keep entry hazards off the field with Taunt. Lokix is a decent teammate, as it greatly assists in the Dark-type mirror matchup, where Sableye can do nothing due to Prankster being nullified by Dark-types.</p>"

Its typing, paired with Intimidate, allows it to switch comfortably into Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Clefable, Kartana, and Weavile and subsequently exert tremendous offensive pressure. However, Mega Mawile suffers with four-moveslot syndrome and is slow, leaving it to be revenge killed by faster foes like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Heatran. Thunder Punch hits bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Dondozo while Ice Punch deals massive damage to Landorus-T and Gliscor. Sucker Punch accomodates for Mega Mawile's poor Speed, allowing it to pressure Pokemon like Dragapult and Gholdengo. Fire Fang hits Mega Scizor while Brick Break threatens Heatran, with both moves pressuring Ferrothorn. The given EV spread allows Mega Mawile to outspeed Mega Scizor. Even with Intimidate, Mega Mawile is relatively frail. Pivots like Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T can bring it in safely against Pokemon with which they struggle like Clodsire, Ferrothorn, and Ting-Lu. Fast cleaners and revenge killers like Weavile, Choice Scarf Kartana, and Dragapult appreciate Mega Mawile's ability to break walls such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Clefable.

Knock Off, paired with Play Rough, allows Mega Mawile to hit most Pokemon in the tier for neutral damage while also supporting its team by removing items. However, Thunder Punch is a decent alternative, as it OHKOes Toxapex after a Swords Dance while also heavily chipping foes such as Dondozo and Skarmory. Sucker Punch makes up for Mega Mawile's awful Speed and lets it pressure Pokemon like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Tornadus-T. The given EV spread allows Mega Mawile to outspeed Skarmory. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Ting-Lu lets Mega Mawile KO faster threats with Sucker Punch after a Swords Dance and chip damage, such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Mega Swampert, and Garchomp. It also appreciates pivot support from Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W to enter the field safely.

Thunder Punch and Ice Punch hit Bruxish and Sandaconda respectively, and Flying-types like Drifblim and Oricorio-F. Trick punishes defensive switch-ins like Sandaconda and is especially beneficial to use against bulky teams, since they are generally slower than Medicham anyway. Tera Fighting enhances Medicham's wallbreaking and cleaning potential by powering up Close Combat, and it lets Medicham resist Toxicroak and Bombirdier's Sucker Punch. Partners that commonly run Choice Scarf, such as Zoroark and Rotom, can revenge kill foes instead of Medicham early-on, keeping its set a mystery.

Trailblaze allows Medicham to pull off sweeps and patch up its offensive shortcoming in its middling Speed. Trick is used with Choice Band to cripple walls such as Drifblim and Tera Fairy users like Chansey and Umbreon. Ice Punch is great neutral coverage for walls like Drifblim and Sandaconda. Tera Fighting gives Choice Band sets a favorable roll to KO Sandaconda after minimal chip or a single layer of Spikes. Tera Steel allows Medicham to defensively check fast revenge killers like Scyther and Zangoose on top of boosting Bullet Punch's damage output. Medicham struggles against bulky Ghost-types like Drifblim and Rotom, which makes Zoroark, Choice Scarf Rotom, and Haunter great offensive partners. Special sweepers like Dudunsparce, Oricorio, and Jolteon appreciate Medicham's ability to break past Chansey, Umbreon, and Vaporeon.

Ice Punch lets Mega Medicham get rid of Landorus-T and Dragonite, which can enable it to freely use its STAB moves. Bullet Punch can be used to snipe Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Diancie, and Weavile, and it also removes revenge killers like Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny after chip damage. Thunder Punch can be used to hit Slowbro, and in tandem with Electric Terrain, it can 2HKO Pokemon like Gholdengo and Victini. Alternatively, Thief can be used to immediately damage the aforementioned Pokemon, so it can use its STAB moves more. Due to Mega Medicham’s frailty and mediocre Speed tier, it is easily revenge killed. Defensive partners like Gholdengo, Ting-Lu, and Ferrothorn help check threats like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Dragapult. Knock Off and Pursuit users like Kingambit and Weavile also support Mega Medicham, as they break through Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon Mega Medicham struggle with, such as Slowbro, Victini, Gholdengo and Skeledirge, allowing it to consistently use its STAB attacks. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn benefit Mega Medicham, as it forces a lot of switches and entry hazards wear down checks quickly. Tapu Koko is a good partner for Mega Medicham, as it handles Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Slowbro reliably and powers up Mega Medicham's Thunder Punch. Tapu Lele can also be a good partner for Mega Medicham, as it powers up Zen Headbutt to insane levels, but blocking Fake Out and Bullet Punch from being used can be problematic. Pokemon like Volcarona and Kartana appreciate Torandus-T, Skeledirge, Clodsire, and Gholdengo being pressured constantly by Mega Medicham, enabling them to wreak havoc once the checks are removed or chipped.</p>"

Body Press allows Torkoal uses Torkoal's high Defense to heavily damage the likes of Kingambit, Blissey, and Tyranitar, as well as preventing Roaring Moon and Hydreigon from setting up freely. Alternatively, Yawn can be used to force a switch, allowing Torkoal to freely bring a teammate that can benefit from the sun. Heat Rock provides more turns of sun for allies to benefit from, but Heavy-Duty Boots greatly increases Torkoal's longevity. If using the latter, getting fewer turns of sun also allows Fire teams to better manage opposing Protosynthesis sweepers, such as Flutter Mane or Sandy Shocks.</p> <p>Thanks to Chlorophyll and its unique typing, Scovillain pairs well with Torkoal, as the sun allows it to outspeed and KO foes such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Quaquaval.

Cinderace is another wallbreaker that thrives under the sun and appreciates Stealth Rock chipping at the opposing team. It can run Court Change, allowing for more entry hazard control if you're running Heat Rock Torkoal, or use a Choice Scarf to defeat foes like Flutter Mane and Choice Specs Greninja. Iron Moth can use sun and Fire Blast to OHKO foes such as Iron Jugulis and Sableye. Ceruledge scares out Flutter Mane, which can otherwise become problematic due to Power Gem and Protosynthesis boosting its Speed in sun.

Mega Altaria appreciates entry hazard removal options and entry hazard setters, notably suicide leads on hyper offense teams like Excadrill, as well as Salamence on offense teams, which can help to keep Mega Altaria healthy and make it easier to sweep.

Night Slash catches Ghost-types like Misdreavus and Banette that would otherwise switch into Zangoose safely and punishes Tera Ghost from Pokemon like Gabite and Whiscash. Quick Attack lets Zangoose kill fast Pokemon like Charizard, Raichu, and Choice Scarf Rotom-F. Swords Dance turns Zangoose into an even more powerful breaker, OHKOing foes like Tinkatuff and Dachsbun at +2, at the cost of being unable to deal with faster Pokemon, making it a good choice against bulkier teams that lack faster Pokemon. Protect lets Zangoose scout Choice Scarf users like Lycanroc-N and Rotom-F as well as consistently activate Toxic Orb, but it is much less consistent overall than the other two options. Toxic Orb is the only item that can activate Toxic Boost on Zangoose, which pairs wonderfully with Facade. Tera Normal gives Zangoose a solid boost of power on Facade and Quick Attack, which is especially useful on sets lacking Swords Dance. It also gives Zangoose an easier time KOing frail, faster Pokemon like Pyroar and Houndoom.</p> <p>Zangoose suffers heavily from the chip damage it accrues, so ways to mitigate this are helpful. Dachsbun is useful for its ability to pass Wish to Zangoose, helping it stay alive and break for a longer time; it is also useful for coming in on Pokemon that force Zangoose out like Alolan Persian and Choice Scarf Lycanroc-N. Fast Taunt users like Electrode and Pyroar can prevent entry hazards from foes like Perserrker and Tinkatuff, limiting the amount of chip damage that Zangoose takes. Electrode can also bring Zangoose in on its checks, like Gogoat and Dunsparce, to help it break. Offensive partners like Sawsbuck and Indeedee-F can help Zangoose overwhelm shared checks like Misdreavus and Tinkatuff, and Indeedee-F's Healing Wish is useful for giving Zangoose more chances to break, although Psychic Terrain from Indeedee-F pairs poorly with Zangoose's Quick Attack. Zangoose also benefits heavily from Sticky Web from Pokemon like Spidops and Masquerain, as being able to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Golduck and other fast Pokemon like Alolan Dugtrio is a massive boon for it.</p>"

Stealth Rock can be opted for instead to compress both forms of entry hazards into one Pokemon, possibly freeing up another team slot. Protect is used for scouting and gaining a bit more Leftovers recovery, but it is not very useful when running the more popular Heavy-Duty Boots. Oblivious allows Whiscash to set up hazards even against Taunt users like Alolan Persian and Misdreavus. Tera Poison is great for removing Whiscash's 4x weakness to Grass, with the added benefit letting it absorb Toxic Spikes. Tera Ghost turns it into a spinblocker in a pinch. The EV spread focuses on Special Defense over Defense because it makes for a better matchup against Volt Switch users like Rotom-F, as well as other special attackers like Alolan Persian and Fire-types like Charizard.</p> <p>Whiscash appreciates spinblockers like Misdreavus and Spiritomb to keep its entry hazards up against Rapid Spin users like Quaxwell. Whiscash appreciates Charizard and Honchkrow's ability to deal with Grass-types; in return, it can take on the Rock- and Electric-types like Choice Scarf Lycanroc-N and Electrode. Grass-types like Gogoat and Dartrix also make for great teammates, as Whiscash can take on Fire- and Poison-types like Charizard, Houndoom, and Skuntank that threaten them. Its presence as an Electric-immune to help the likes of Masquerain and Honchkrow is superb, as it has the typing and bulk to take hits from the coverage moves that Pokemon like Raichu, Rotom-F, and Electrode carry. Dachsbun, Crabominable, and Carbink all benefit from Whiscash, as it can take Steel-type hits from Perrserker and Alolan Dugtrio for them. With a lot of the tier being weak or neutral to Rock, Whiscash finds itself having the typing to help the likes of Charizard, Masquerain, and Rabsca avoid dealing with Lycanroc-N, Dugtrio, and Gabite. It does find a lot of trouble handling Misdreavus, as it lacks the super effective coverage to get past its bulk. This is why pairing it with a Dark-type like Skuntank or Alolan Persian can be beneficial. Since Whiscash doesn't have recovery, it really doesnt like taking Will-O-Wisp from said Misdreavus, and Charizard or Toxic from Skuntank. As a result, status absorbers like Chansey, Dragonair, and Tinkatuff make for great teammates.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Salamence stands out as one of the premier Pokemon in the tier thanks to its defensive and offensive presence. Its typing, bulk, and ability in Intimidate make it one of the best responses to physical threats like Slither Wing, Lucario, and Scizor. Hydro Pump blows away foes like Hippowdon, Tyranitar, and Sandy Shocks while providing a strong neutral hit on Tinkaton and Scizor. Flamethrower hits the aforementioned Steel-types, alongside others like Bisharp and Tinkaton. Flamethrower also hits Brambleghast without reaping the downsides of using Draco Meteor. Heavy-Duty Boots removes Salamence's Stealth Rock weakness, which allows it to switch in more freely against threats it needs to check. Terastallizing is primarily used defensively to improve its matchups against common offensive Pokemon. Tera Water allows Salamence to resist Bullet Punch from Scizor and still retain a Water-type resistance against Floatzel. Tera Steel improves the matchup against Tinkaton, turns Salamence into a decent Staraptor and Maushold check, and provides a resist to many forms of priority in the tier such as Accelerock from Lycanroc-D and Bullet Punch from Scizor. Tera Dragon should be used to help break through sturdier Pokemon like Gastrodon and Slowking more easily.</p> <p>Pawmot and Scizor can help remove Gastrodon, Tyranitar, and Scream Tail— all of which Salamence struggles to break past—while also serving as more reliable checks to Bisharp. Faster Pokemon such as Pawmot, Sandy Shocks, and Lycanroc-D can revenge kill or force Salamence out, so partners like Hippowdon and Quagsire are appreciated, both also acting as decent Knock Off absorbers against Grafaiai and Tinkaton. Quagsire can also provide Spikes support to help wear down some of the aforementioned special walls as well as put them on a timer with Toxic, as well as reliably check most Swords Dance Scizor and Lucario if Salamence isn't Tera Steel.</p>"

        "Dragon Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance makes Salamence one of the scariest sweepers in the tier thanks to its great offensive typing. Outrage is a powerful STAB move that helps muscle through sturdier walls like Gastrodon and Hippowdon after a boost; however, Dragon Claw is a weaker alternative that doesn't have the downside of being locked in. Earthquake provides perfect coverage to deal with Tyranitar, Tinkaton, and Bisharp. Dual Wingbeat helps break through Scream Tail better and can pick off weakened Flying-types like Noivern and Iron Jugulis without locking into Outrage. Roost is an alternative that provides longevity against Pokemon like Slither Wing and Lokix. It is best used alongside Intimidate on bulkier teams that need the defensive utility of Salamence's typing. Otherwise, Moxie is preferred, as it can easily let Salamence snowball through a team. Tera Steel lets Salamence set up on Tinkaton—though it must be wary of Encore—and provides needed resists to many priority moves like Accelerock, Bullet Punch, Ice Shard, and Extreme Speed from Lycanroc-D, Scizor, Weavile, and Lucario.</p> <p>Quagsire is very problematic due to Unaware ignoring any Dragon Dance and Moxie boosts. Pawmot can remove Quagsire with Seed Bomb, Scizor can lure it in and remove it with Trailblaze, and Sandy Shocks can threaten to OHKO with Tera Blast after Terastallizing into a Grass-type. Sandy Shocks can also help remove physically defensive Hippowdon, which is especially helpful if it's running Roar. Sandy Shocks and other entry hazard setters such as Tyranitar can wear down Pokemon like opposing Tyranitar and Scream Tail into range of its attacks. Gengar is a fantastic wallbreaker to pair with Salamence, as it can forcefully remove Grafaiai, which can be a massive hindrance due to Prankster Encore limiting setup opportunities. Gengar also spinblocks alongside the aforementioned entry hazard setters and weakens Tyranitar and Tinkaton into Earthquake range.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its great Attack, good coverage options, and ability to outpace foes such as Mega Aerodactyl, Alakazam, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon at +1, Salamence is a good setup sweeper on offense and hyper offense teams, being able to serve as both a mid-game wallbreaker and a late-game cleaner. Fly alongside Flyinium Z provides Salamence a powerful one-time nuke that can outright OHKO Flying-weak foes like Mega Venusaur and Buzzwole and neutral targets like Mega Sableye, Tapu Fini, and Gastrodon at +1. Outrage is an alternative when not using Flyinium Z that helps deal with opposing Dragon-types like Mega Latias, Latios, and Hydreigon, though it does have the downside of locking in Salamence, which can allow the opponent to respond with a Fairy-type like Tapu Fini, Clefable, or Enamorus. Earthquake helps against Steel-types like Excadrill, Aegislash, and Bisharp that resist both its STAB moves, and it can also help to chip down other Ground-weak foes like Skeledirge and Mega Tyranitar. Substitute lets Salamence make use of switches it forces against foes like Mega Venusaur and Buzzwole and take advantage of some defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Amoonguss; it can also provide a safety net for mispositioning with Fly or Outrage and avoids status from targets like Chansey, Mega Sableye, and Mew. Alternatively Fire Blast hits Skarmory and can also hit Grass- and Steel-types like physically defensive Tangrowth, Celesteela, and Scizor. If Salamence isn't using Fly, Life Orb boosts the damage of all of its moves, OHKOing Mega Latias and Rotom-W with Outrage. Salamence prefers running Moxie as opposed to Intimidate, due to its usefulness on offensively-oriented teams. Salamence has a hard time breaking through Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Clefable, due to their typing and super effective moves, making it pair well with other offensive Pokemon like Thundurus and Swords Dance Cinderace, which can overwhelm these foes. When not running Fly, Salamence can also struggle to break through Grass-types like Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur, making Fire-types like Ceruledge and Victini also good partners. Salamence can also pair well with entry hazards from setters like Ting-Lu, Mega Tyranitar, and Skarmory, as Fly and Outrage are guaranteed to OHKO foes like Buzzwole and Thundurus-T after Stealth Rock chip. Due to Salamence's Stealth Rock weakness, it appreciates Pokemon that can provide anti-hazard measures, notably dedicated leads like Excadrill, as well as Taunt Mew, while Salamence can deal with Pokemon that can threaten them like Celesteela and Hydreigon. Salamence can be very prone to getting revenge killed by faster targets like Mega Aerodactyl, Alakazam, and Choice Scarf Enamorus, meaning it appreciates bulky partners like Slowbro and Mega Venusaur, appreciating the former's pivoting and the latter's tank-like nature, as well as Pokemon that can set up on the aforementioned targets like Scizor, Mega Latias, and Celesteela.</p>"

This also allows it to find points of entry against common offensive threats such as Iron Moth and Keldeo. Calm Mind boosts Mega Latias' naturally high Special Attack and Special Defense to astounding levels, ensuring that it can easily withstand moves such as Clefable's unboosted Moonblast and Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Dark Pulse to sweep weakened teams. Psyshock is crucial to ignore defensive boosts from Calm Mind variants of the aforementioned Clefable while also breaking past special walls such as Blissey and Chansey more easily, preventing them from crippling Mega Latias with status moves. Aura Sphere provides Mega Latias with important coverage against most Dark- and Steel-types, hitting Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Excadrill super effectively. Alternatively, if Tyranitar is handled adequately by Mega Latias's teammates, Mystical Fire can be used to deal more immediate damage to the likes of Scizor and Celesteela instead. Mega Latias fits best on defensive and balance teams, which can provide it with the longevity needed to gain proper setup opportunities. Entry hazard support from the likes of Skarmory and Gastrodon can help wear down opposing walls that would otherwise be difficult to break through late-game, such as Tapu Fini. Similarly, wallbreakers such as Choice Band Iron Hands can make for good options to take advantage of these Pokemon, especially when Mega Latias lacks Mystical Fire to deal with the former. However, although Mega Latias is able to switch into Pokemon like Iron Hands, its lack of initial power can leave it vulnerable to being overwhelmed by their boosted attacks in return. Thus, Speed control options such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Tapu Fini, in addition to certain defensive walls like Unaware Skeledirge are extremely valuable in providing backup against such foes. Conversely, paralysis support from the likes of Clefable is also notable, as they can limit faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Cinderace from being able to overwhelm Mega Latias with super effective hits late-game.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Latias is an effective form of speed control that sets itself apart from other Pokemon the same role, such as Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos, with its unique utility options. Draco Meteor serves as its main STAB attack, letting Latias revenge kill most neutral targets such as Thundurus-T and opposing Latias. Psyshock is a more spammable STAB move that also lets it clean weakened teams and threaten Fighting-types as well as Iron Moth. Psychic is very similar, trading a chance to OHKO Iron Moth for a 2HKO on Iron Hands and a slightly higher damage output against most neutral targets. Healing Wish is especially helpful to bulky Pokemon that lack reliable recovery such as Iron Hands and Tapu Fini. It can also grant offensive Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar another opportunity to sweep or wallbreak. Trick is Latias's preferred fourth move, allowing it to cripple otherwise unbreakable foes such as Blissey and Chansey. An alternative is Mystical Fire, which lets Latias threaten the Steel-types that resist its STAB combination, like Aegislash and Excadrill. Its Special Attack-lowering effect makes it especially useful against certain boosting threats such as Autotomize Celesteela. Defog is another alternative, letting Latias clear hazards for its team; however, the fact that Latias loses to most Stealth Rock users such as Mega Tyranitar and Excadrill makes it somewhat unreliable in this role. Latias fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that want a revenge killer and appreciate Latias's utility. Latias struggles the most against special walls like Blissey and Slowking, making physical wallbreakers such as Bisharpand Galarian Zapdos mandatory partners. Fighting-types such as Buzzwole are useful to threaten Mega Tyranitar, which takes minimal damage from Latias's attacks and can trap it with Pursuit; they can also take out Steel-types like Excadrill, something especially important if Latias forgoes Mystical Fire. Latias's ability to force in and cripple special walls with Trick makes a good partner for special attackers like Clefable.</p>"

        "Special Wallbreaker": {
          "description": "<p>Latios is an elite wallbreaker thanks largely to its raw power. Its powerful STAB move in Draco Meteor allows Latios to demolish all but the sturdiest neutral targets, including Tyranitar, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. It can leverage its solid Speed stat versus common offensive Pokemon such as Victini, Galarian Zapdos, Sandy Shocks, and Blacephalon as well as its numerous useful resistances to create opportunities to unleash devastating moves. Psyshock is preferred over Psychic to defeat specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Chansey more easily. Trick is used on Choice Specs sets to cripple would-be walls such as Jirachi and Clefable, while Roost allows Life Orb variants to offset the item's recoil. Mystical Fire is preferred on Latios to hit Steel-types such as Excadrill, Aegislash, and Celesteela. It can also choose to use Thunderbolt to flip important matchups such as Tapu Fini, Slowking, and physically defensive Clefable while also providing a consistent way to damage most Steel-types. Choice Specs is preferred to maximize damage output, but Life Orb can also be chosen in order to enable switching moves, at the cost of the ability to eliminate Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Hippowdon with Draco Meteor. Latios's ability to blow away physical walls makes it an excellent partner to any physical wallbreaker. Latios appreciates opportunities to fire off powerful attacks, so Pokemon with pivoting moves such as Cinderace, Galarian Zapdos, and Scizor make for good partners. Latios struggles with Choice Scarf users able to force it to switch, such as Tapu Fini, Blacephalon, and Latias, as well as Pokemon able to naturally outspeed it such as Cinderace and Alakazam. These weaknesses can be alleviated with defensive pivots able to switch into these threats, such as Clefable, Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Skarmory, depending on foe. Latios also pairs well with supportive Pokemon like Clefable and Mega Tyranitar that are able to help it break through walls through utility moves such as entry hazards or Knock Off. Latios pairs especially well with Fighting-type wallbreakers such as Buzzwole, Galarian Zapdos, and Iron Hands due to their favorable matchups into the Steel- and Dark-types looking to switch into Latios's STAB moves. In return, Latios offers a Psychic resistance and a favourable matchup into physically defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Slowbro, and opposing Buzzwole.</p>"
        },
        "Double Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Access to Calm Mind and Stored Power make Latios an overwhelming setup sweeper. It makes use of the synergy between its boosting moves and Weakness Policy to punish opponents both for choosing to attack it and for choosing not to attack it. Stored Power allows Latios to take advantage of stat boosts even versus Unaware Pokemon such as Clefable and Skeledirge. Aura Sphere is chosen to threaten the only Pokemon able to survive a boosted Stored Power: Dark-types like Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon. Latios fits best on hyper offense teams, which require support from Pokemon such as Excadrill and Mew that can set entry hazards for Latios to secure important KOs late-game. It struggles with strategies able to interrupt its setup without activating Weakness Policy, such as phazing moves from Skarmory and specially defensive Pokemon able to trade hits with Latios such as Scizor and Celesteela. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar and Scizor aid with overwhelming Steel-types, while Z-Celebrate Victini and Meteor Beam Celesteela can threaten the Steel-types once they have been forced in. Pokemon halted by Unaware users appreciate Latios's ability to boost past them, namely Dragon Dance Mega Aerodactyl and Swords Dance Cinderace.</p>"
        },
        "Mega Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>Mega Latios's gargantuan Special Attack, excellent bulk for an offensive Pokemon, and Speed tier that outpaces common wallbreakers suchas Thundurus-T, Keldeo, and Enamorus make it powerful threat that can terrorize offensive and defensive Pokemon alike. Aura Sphere is essential for its role, targeting Dark-types, notably 2HKOing the Tyranitar formes and OHKOing Bisharp, foes that can otherwise Pursuit trap Mega Latios. It also targets Steel-types such as Excadrill. Shadow Ball hits opposing Psychic-types such as Latios and Latias. Alternatively, Thunderbolt targets Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Flying-types such as Celesteela; additionally, while Mega Latios doesn't need Thunderbolt to threaten Enamorus and Skarmory, it always OHKOes them after Stealth Rock. Both options have the added benefit of pressuring Slowbro and Slowking, which otherwise stonewall and can pivot out on Mega Latios. Recover lets Mega Latios stay healthy, allowing it to check foes such as Keldeo and Iron Hands throughout a game. Mega Latios best fits on bulky offense teams looking for a fast offensive threat that has strong defensive utility. It has massive competition with Mega Latias, which is a much better setup sweeper thanks to its massive bulk, so teams using Mega Latios must utilize the instant offensive power it provides. Mega Latios is helpless against certain special walls such as Chansey and Blissey, making physical wallbreakers such as Scizor and Iron Hands necessary partners. Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Bisharp are notably effective at removing these walls. While it isn't helpless against Dark-types, foes like Mega Tyranitar and Bisharp can still easily win the one-on-one thanks to their bulk or access to Sucker Punch, making Fighting-types such as Buzzwole and Galarian Zapdos good partners for their ability to check and remove them. Mega Latios can be revenge killed by faster foes such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Hydreigon, making bulky teammates such as Amoonguss and Celesteela useful teammates. Based on its choice of coverage, Mega Latios is either walled by Psychic-types like Latios and Latias or certain Water- and Flying-types like Calm Mind Tapu Fini and Celesteela. The aforementioned Pursuit trappers are excellent at removing the former. Ghost-types like Hisuian Zoroark can also work well at KOing these foes. Against the latter group, Electric-types such as Iron Hands and Zeraora can eliminate them. Given that many of Mega Latios's checks lack recovery and don't hold Heavy-Duty Boots, entry hazard setters like Mew, Excadrill, and Mega Tyranitar can help it break through them.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Mega Latios is a powerful wallbreaker that breaks through common defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Clodsire using its impressive coverage and high Special Attack while also having a good Speed tier to deal with Pokemon like Garchomp and Urshifu-R. However, Mega Latios slightly suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, and while it cannot run all the coverage it wants, this doesn't hinder its effectiveness much. Aura Sphere is a must have in a tier plagued by Kingambit, as it easily Pursuit traps and KOes Mega Latios, and it also allows Mega Latios to hit other Steel-type Pokemon like Heatran and Ferrothorn. Mystical Fire allows it to secure the OHKO on Ferrothorn while also hitting Mega Scizor and Gholdengo, but it struggles more against the likes of Tera Grass Heatran, Dragonite, Tera Dragon Toxapex, and Slowbro. Ice Beam allows it to check Ground- and Dragon-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Dragonite, but it will then have difficulty with the likes of Slowbro, Mega Scizor, and Gholdengo. Substitute lets it bypass status and also bait a Tera or Sucker Punch from Kingambit and neutralize the aforementioned Slowbro, but Mega Latios then gets walled by most, if not all, of the previously mentioned checks. Roost allows it to more consistently check Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Mega Charizard Y while also letting it consistently wallbreak throughout the course of a game. Mega Latios fits well on bulky offensive teams that can utilize its ability to break through defensive cores such as Toxapex and Gliscor, which opens up opportunities for allies like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant to wallbreak as well. However, it is easily checked by faster threats that can OHKO it like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, Dragapult, and many Choice Scarf users like Gholdengo and Tapu Lele. It is also walled by specific tanks like Heatran, Toxapex, Dragonite, or Slowbro, depending on its coverage. Therefore, it appreciates partners that can deal with the aforementioned Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Heatran, Clodsire, and Ferrothorn. Entry hazard support is also incredible at allowing Mega Latios to rack up chip damage by the switches it naturally forces, and its checks like Heatran, Slowbro, and the like have reduced longevity when switching into hazards and become easier to break, so allies like Samurott-H, Landorus-T, or Heatran assist well. Mega Latios also pairs well with the likes of Tapu Lele and Kartana, weakening their shared Steel-type checks so that the latter two can clean up end-game.</p>"

  "Kyogre": {
    "ubers": {
      "sets": {
        "Choice Scarf": {
          "description": "<ul> <li>Choice Scarf Kyogre is a solid form of speed control found on bulky offense teams. Its ability to outspeed Zacian-C and pressure common Pokemon found on bulky archetypes, like Ting-Lu, Corviknight, Skeledirge, and Groudon, gives it a decent offensive presence. Choice Scarf Kyogre can also pressure hyper offense teams because those teams don't run Pokemon naturally faster than it. However, Choice Scarf Kyogre is prediction reliant, as there are a lot of Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks in Ubers, mainly metagame staples like Koraidon, Miraidon, and other defensive Pokemon like Water Absorb Clodsire and Eternatus. Choice Scarf Kyogre is also relatively weak, which means that it'll often be forced to use Tera to power up its attacks; even then, Pokemon like Eternatus and Clodsire will still wall Kyogre.</li> <li>Koraidon is the biggest threat to Kyogre, as it commonly switches into it, takes little damage from its Water-type attacks, and sets sun. Catching Koraidon with Ice Beam is extremely important, as it can make the difference between Kyogre sweeping in the late-game or not. This makes Choice Scarf Kyogre extremely prediction reliant, as one single bad move can mean the entire momentum of the battle is lost.</li> <li>Tera Water boosts Kyogre's Water-type moves to insane levels. For instance, Water Spout now OHKOes max HP Arceus formes that are neutral to Water and 2HKOes Arceus formes that resist Water. It also has a good chance to OHKO Groudon even if sun is active.</li> <li>Kyogre should be brought onto the field via pivoting moves like U-turn from the likes of Koraidon, Miraidon, and Landorus-T. Unless there are Water Absorb Pokemon on the enemy team, Water Spout is a relatively free move to spam; however, hitting Koraidon on the switch with a well-timed Ice Beam can be game-changing.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Kyogre appreciates Pokemon that can wallbreak by themselves. A good teammate for this reason is Miraidon, which shares a common check in Clodsire. Taunt Miraidon in particular can shut down Clodsire completely, as Clodsire will be at half HP after switching into Draco Meteor. Miraidon can also bring Kyogre onto the field via U-turn. Arceus-Ground is another great teammate for Kyogre, as it can keep Pokemon like Eternatus, Clodsire, and Miraidon in check.</li> <li>Pokemon that can check Koraidon, like Arceus-Fairy, Groudon, and Skeledirge, are a must, as Koraidon is one of the most annoying Pokemon in Ubers for Kyogre to deal with: it replaces rain with sun, weakening Kyogre's main attacking moves. They can also set entry hazards and, in Landorus-T's case, bring Kyogre onto the field with U-turn.</li> <li>Entry hazard removers like Giratina-O and Corviknight are appreciated, as Kyogre loses a lot of power when its HP is lowered. Both Pokemon also check threats like Extreme Killer Arceus, which can revenge kill Kyogre with Extreme Speed.</li> </ul>"
        },
        "Choice Specs": {
          "description": "<ul> <li>Choice Specs Kyogre is a devastating wallbreaker that can OHKO or 2HKO the entire metagame. However, the ever-present sun set by Koraidon and its relatively low Speed make it harder to use than it may appear, even with its incredible power.</li> <li>Water Spout gives Kyogre the power to OHKO even resistant Pokemon such as Miraidon and Eternatus when paired with Tera Water, and it lets Kyogre claim KOs with ease early on. Ice Beam lets Kyogre hit Koraidon and Clodsire super effectively, cleanly OHKOing the former lacking bulk EVs and 2HKOing the latter. Thunder is Kyogre's strongest option for breaking through bulky Water-types such as Toxapex, Arceus-Water, and opposing Kyogre.</li> <li>Tera Water lets Kyogre perform feats such as OHKOing Miraidon, Toxapex, Arceus-Water, and Eternatus with Water Spout or Origin Pulse with a layer of Spikes up.</li> <li>An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Def can be used to take on Arceus formes and switch into defensive Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Landorus-T better.</li> <li>Kyogre fits well on bulky offense. It has trouble getting onto the field and loses a significant part of its power if it takes a hit, so it should be paired with pivots such as Koraidon, Miraidon, and Landorus-T. They can bring Kyogre in on their incoming checks such as Arceus-Fairy and Skeledirge, Arceus-Ground, and Ting-Lu, respectively.</li> <li>Kyogre also greatly appreciates entry hazard removal, such as Defog support from Giratina-O and Corviknight, which keeps Water Spout at full power. Speed control options help Kyogre to wallbreak to its fullest, as it tends to have to take a hit before attacking thanks to its lower Speed, such as Thunder Wave from Arceus, Miraidon, Giratina-O, and Groudon, and Sticky Web from Masquerain.</li> <li>Entry hazards support from Ting-Lu and Clodsire is also appreciated to make sure Kyogre's attacks can cleanly OHKO most of their switch-ins. The aforementioned two Pokemon are also able to check Miraidon and Eternatus, both of which can come in on Kyogre and revenge-kill it. Koraidon can force Kyogre out and can switch into its Water-type attacks, so checks to Koraidon such as Skeledirge, Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Arceus-Fairy are also appreciated. That said, Kyogre can also predict Koraidon coming in and catch it with an Ice Beam, which is a clean OHKO on all Koraidon without bulk EVs.</li> <li>Kyogre can also be used as a solid offensive check to Arceus formes, as it can pivot into a Taunt or a Calm Mind and force them out with a strong Origin Pulse or Water Spout. Kyogre can also pivot into opposing Calm Mind Kyogre, forcing it out with Thunder.</li> </ul>"
        },
        "Bulky Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<ul> <li>Thanks to Kyogre's naturally high bulk, it can use Calm Mind to set up on defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Skeledirge, as well as Pokemon it forces out through its typing, such as Zacian-C and Koraidon.</li> <li>Surf is the move of choice thanks to its higher PP as well as accuracy over Origin Pulse. Ice Beam lets Kyogre hit Miraidon, Koraidon, Eternatus, and Clodsire super effectively, which would otherwise freely switch into Kyogre. Tera Blast can be used if paired with Tera Ground to break through Clodsire, regardless of whether it has used Tera.</li> <li>Substitute can be used to set up on Clodsire, which cannot break it with Earthquake, and avoid status in general. Rest lets Kyogre repeatedly come in and absorb status, though it must be wary of Miraidon's Hadron Engine setting Electric Terrain.</li> <li>Tera Fairy flips Kyogre's matchup against Eternatus and Koraidon, letting Kyogre freely come in on Dragon-type moves and resist Koraidon's STAB attacks. Tera Ground lets Kyogre set up on Miraidon's Electro Drift, although it cannot take Draco Meteor well without previously having set up. Tera Poison is another option for becoming immune to Toxic from Clodsire, Toxapex, and Eternatus while also resisting Koraidon's Fighting-type attacks.</li> <li>Leftovers provides Kyogre with a form of recovery and gives it more chances to enter the field.</li> <li>The given EV spread lets Kyogre take on physical attackers like Groudon and Koraidon better while outspeeding some paralyzed +1 Arceus formes and paralyzed Zacian-C.</li> <li>Kyogre fits best on balance and bulky offense teams thanks to the defensive utility it provides as well as being a solid late-game wincon.</li> <li>Miraidon is a great partner for non-Rest variants of Kyogre, as it can break through Taunt and Calm Mind Arceus formes and pressure bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Arceus-Water. Miraidon can also use U-turn to bring Kyogre in on Ground-types that it can set up on, such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Ting-Lu and Groudon are solid partners for Kyogre, since they can set up Spikes to weaken Kyogre's checks, while also being able to switch into Electric-type attacks that threaten Kyogre. Physical attackers such as Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Chien-Pao, and Koraidon pair well with Kyogre, as they can use Kyogre's checks as an entry for them to start breaking, and Kyogre pressures all of their checks apart from Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Kyogre needs Koraidon eliminated before it can start setting up, as Kyogre is generally forced out by it and its STAB moves are weakened. As such, defensive Pokemon such as Skeledirge, Great Tusk, and Arceus-Fairy are solid partners that check Koraidon effectively. Finally, Kyogre has trouble coming in against faster offense teams, so partners that can pressure these teams such as Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Zacian-C are preferred.</li> </ul>"
        },
        "Offensive Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<ul> <li>Offensive Calm Mind Kyogre is a decent setup sweeper on offensive and balance teams for its ability to punch big holes in defensive cores for its team to exploit.</li> <li>Ice Beam allows Kyogre to threaten Dragon-types like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Eternatus, which can withstand Kyogre's STAB attacks. Koraidon is a noteworthy target, because it can otherwise easily oppose Kyogre’s rain with its sun. Ice Beam also hits Clodsire, which otherwise completely walls this Kyogre set without Tera Ground Tera Blast.</li> <li>Kyogre can easily spread paralysis with Thunder Wave thanks to it naturally forcing out Ground-types, which is appreciated by slower teams.</li> <li>Thunder lets Kyogre smack defensive Water-types that resist Surf and Ice Beam, like Toxapex and Dondozo, as well as lays waste to opposing Kyogre. It also hits Pokemon that may Terastallize into a Water-type, like Eternatus and Zacian-C.</li> <li>With Tera Ground, Tera Blast can 2HKO Clodsire without setting up, even if it is Terastallized into a Steel-type, while also hitting Toxapex. However, it has very little practical use outside of this.</li> <li>Kyogre has no reliable recovery, so Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item so it doesn’t get worn down by entry hazards. Leftovers can be used on teams that have reliably hazard control like Giratina-O.</li> <li>Tera Fairy gives Kyogre a Fighting resistance and Dragon immunity, making it impossible for Koraidon to threaten Kyogre in rain.</li> <li>Tera Poison gives Kyogre a Fighting resistance and immunity to Toxic, and also allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes from Eternatus, Toxapex, and Clodsire.</li> <li>Tera Ground gives Kyogre an Electric immunity, letting it avoid Electro Drift from Miraidon and Thunder from opposing Kyogre.</li> <li>Tera Grass, on the other hand, gives Kyogre Ground and Electric resistances, letting it set up on Pokemon it otherwise cannot, like Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Miraidon.</li> <li>This Kyogre set is a good fit on balance teams that struggle against defensive teams, as it is a bulky setup sweeper that can take advantage of common defensive Pokemon like Skeledirge and Ting-Lu to spread paralysis with Thunder Wave.</li> <li>Zacian-C is a fantastic partner, able to threaten many Pokemon commonly used to threaten Kyogre without a Substitute, like Koraidon and Miraidon. Zacian-C also loves Kyogre’s rain neutering its Fire weakness.</li> <li>Koraidon can pivot into Kyogre with U-turn while taking attacks used against Kyogre, like opposing Koraidon’s Flare Blitz when Kyogre is Terastallized and Miraidon’s Electro Drift. Koraidon also loves Kyogre threatening physical checks like Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Groudon.</li> <li>Clodsire lures like Choice Specs Miraidon are great for Kyogre, as Kyogre is completely walled by Clodsire that has Terastallized into a Steel-type if it doesn't have Tera Ground Tera Blast.</li> </ul>"

Giratina-O checks Arceus too, and it can remove entry hazards for Kyogre to maintain its powerful Water Spout. Offensive teammates such as Calyrex-S and Miraidon can pressure Kyogre's checks such as Eternatus, Toxapex, and Arceus-Water, and they appreciate Kyogre threatening Ting-Lu for them. Partners such as Miraidon and Koraidon, whose checks are pressured by Kyogre can safely pivot it in with U-turn.</p>"

        "Choice Specs": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Kyogre is seen on bulky offense and balance teams and threatens common walls like Ting-Lu, Skeledirge, Landorus-T, and defensive Arceus formes with its powerful Drizzle-boosted STAB moves. Thunder is used to hit Toxapex, opposing Kyogre, and Arceus-Water, and Ice Beam is used to hit Koraidon, Miraidon, Giratina-O, and Eternatus. Tera Fairy provides Kyogre with a much-needed immunity to Dragon-type moves from Koraidon and Miraidon and a resistance to Koraidon's Low Kick. Tera Ghost is used so that Kyogre can avoid being revenge killed by Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus and Low Kick from Koraidon. Tera Water alleviates prediction by letting Origin Pulse 2HKO Giratina-O and letting Water Spout achieve feats such as OHKOing Miraidon and Toxapex, OHKOing Arceus-Water with a layer of Spikes, and 2HKOing Calm Eternatus even if it uses Recover. The HP investment allows Kyogre to be used as a soft check to Koraidon and gives it a high probability of surviving Choice Specs-boosted Grass Knot from Calyrex-S, and the Speed allows it to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T. Kyogre, being slower than the other offensive threats in the metagame like Koraidon, Miraidon, Calyrex-S, and offensive Eternatus, appreciates solid checks to them such as Landorus-T, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu as teammates. Defog Giratina-O is also appreciated for its ability to remove entry hazards, which lets Kyogre preserve its HP to maintain a powerful Water Spout and stay out of KO range of priority moves such as Arceus's Extreme Speed and Giratina-O's Shadow Sneak. Kyogre also appreciates teammates such as Koraidon, Miraidon, and Landorus-T, as they are capable of letting Kyogre enter the battlefield safely with the help of their pivot moves.</p>"
        },
        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<p>Kyogre cements itself as a fantastic offensive presence due to its extraordinary firepower and exceptional bulk. It comes in most often on the metagame's abundant Ground-type Pokemon, most notably Arceus-Ground, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T, all of which are forced out by Kyogre. Ice Beam is a necessary coverage move, as it deals super effective damage to many of Kyogre's checks such as Miraidon, Koraidon, Giratina-O, Wo-Chien, Eternatus, and Clodsire. Thunder can be used to remove other Pokemon that resist Origin Pulse, those being Toxapex, Arceus-Water, and opposing Kyogre. In addition to coverage, Kyogre has a serviceable selection of utility options. Calm Mind further bolsters Kyogre's fantastic Special Attack, enabling it to 2HKO defensive answers such as Wo-Chien, Clodsire, and Eternatus using Ice Beam. Thunder Wave aims primarily to cripple Koraidon, slowing down Choice Scarf variants enough for teammates such as Zacian-C and Calyrex-S, which appreciate Speed control being neutralized. Paralyzed Koraidon that do not use a Choice Scarf, however, become slower than Kyogre itself. Thunder Wave also slows down Arceus formes enough for Kyogre to outspeed them, improving its matchup against Calm Mind Arcues-Fairy in particular. Substitute is useful for scouting switches, and lets Kyogre avoid status moves such as Toxic from Toxapex, Eternatus, and Clodsire and Leech Seed from Wo-Chien. Leftovers supports Kyogre's longevity, allowing it to continually switch in throughout the game. Alternatively, Mystic Water helps Kyogre break through bulky neutral targets, including various Arceus formes. 12 Speed EVs allow Kyogre to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T. Tera Fairy grants Kyogre a full immunity to Dragon-type attacks from threats like Koraidon and Miraidon, as well as providing a resistance to Koraidon's Fighting-type moves. Tera Poison offers an immunity to Toxic, as well as valuable resistances to Fighting, Fairy, and Grass. These resistances are helpful against Koraidon, Arceus-Fairy, and Calyrex-S, respectively. Tera Poison also allows Kyogre to absorb Toxic Spikes. However, being a Poison-type causes Kyogre to become vulnerable to Calyrex-S's Psychic-type STAB attacks. Finally, Tera Grass flips Kyogre's weaknesses to Calyrex-S's Grass Knot and Miraidon's Electric-type attacks to resistances. Tera Grass also offers a resistance to Ground, halting Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground and making it safer for Kyogre to switch in to Ground-type attacks. It is worth noting that Tera Grass makes Kyogre particularly weak to Koraidon, as U-turn and Flare Blitz become super effective. Kyogre is seen primarily on bulky offense structures that benefit from its ability to put pressure on defensive cores. It appreciates teammates that can switch into and wear down Koraidon, such as Landorus-T and Toxapex. Kyogre also appreciates support from Pokemon with pivot moves like Landorus-T, Koraidon, and Miraidon, which can help it safely get into the game. Additionally, defensive counterplay for Miraidon is neccessary, as it would otherwise threaten to OHKO Kyogre. Some teammates that can fill this niche are Ting-Lu, Wo-Chien, and Arceus-Ground. Offensive partners that can lure in their passive defensive checks, such as Koraidon, Miraidon, Calyrex-S, and Zacian-C, offer Kyogre ample opportunity to switch in. Calyrex-S in particular serves as an excellent offensive teammate. Its Psychic-type STAB moves give it the upper hand against Kyogre's defensive checks in Toxapex, Clodsire, and Eternatus. In turn, Kyogre is able to switch in on and threaten Calyrex-S's passive defensive checks in Ting-Lu and Arceus-Dark. Additionally, Encore variants of Calyrex-S are able to punish Arceus for attempting to revenge kill Kyogre with Extreme Speed.</p>"

          "description": "<p>RegenVest Primal Kyogre is an effective specially defensive pivot that is able to blanket check special attackers such as Eternatus, Palkia-O, and Choice Specs Mega Diancie. U-turn is not boosted by STAB but cannot be blocked by Desolate Land. Coming from Primal Kyogre's high Special Attack, Scald does respectable damage against neutral targets and greatly threatens Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Mega Steelix; the threat of burn also deters physical wallbreakers like Mega Mewtwo X from switching in. If Scald burns are undesirable because they conflict with other status conditions, Origin Pulse is a strong alternative. Knock Off removes key items like Covert Cloak, Assault Vest, and Imposter Chansey's Eviolite, allowing Primal Kyogre to status foes and assisting offensive teammates like Mega Mewtwo X. Mortal Spin is useful to force chip damage on Imposter users and threats like Palkia-O, and it also benefits from most Steel-types fearing Scald, preventing them from spinblocking. Nuzzle is an alternative that is more effective into offensive threats like Magic Guard Mega Mewtwo X and Ho-Oh but is noticeably worse into defensive Pokemon. Stone Axe doesn't conflict with Scald and is easier to Imposter-proof, but it makes Primal Kyogre almost helpless against threats like Palkia-O and Desolate Land Arceus-Fire, meaning reliable checks to these like Ice Scales Arceus-Fairy and Fur Coat Miraidon are needed. Primal Kyogre is threatened by powerful physical wallbreakers like Mewtwo Mega X; thus, physical walls such as Fur Coat Miraidon, Yveltal, and Arceus-Poison are good teammates. Special attackers like Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, and Eternatus appreciate Primal Kyogre removing key items like Covert Cloak and Assault Vest from special walls like Arceus-Fairy and opposing Primal Kyogre, and they can also be Imposter-proofed by Primal Kyogre. Primal Kyogre can be tricky to Imposter-proof; depending on the moveset, some decent options are Dialga-O and Jungle Healing users. Teammates such as Kartana also can offensively Imposter-proof Primal Kyogre by threatening an OHKO on Imposter users.</p>"

Haze slows down setup sweepers such as Eternatus and Palkia-O, as well as Simple + No Retreat users like Arceus-Ghost. Flip Turn lets frail teammates such as Blacephalon, Mega Diancie, and Mega Beedrill switch in safely. Covert Cloak helps Primal Kyogre against Triple Arrows from Arceus-Ghost and Mortal Spin from Arceus formes. Ice Scales Primal Kyogre is used on teams that require a special wall against Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Choice Specs Mega Diancie, and Arceus-Ghost. However, Primal Kyogre loses to Mixed Mega Diancie, so physical walls such as Fur Coat Mega Swampert and Arceus-Poison are very valuable to beat Pokemon such as offensive Miraidon and mixed Mega Diancie. Despite Primal Kyogre Imposter-proofing itself thanks to Covert Cloak, it can't do much against Imposter, so allies like Choice Band Kartana and Desolate Land Ho-Oh are useful to help force out Imposter users. Entry hazard setters that don't mind burns from Scald, such as Fur Coat Lunala and Prankster Celesteela, as well as Knock Off users like Covert Cloak Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Water, can force Imposter to pivot out.</p>"

Ice Punch alternatively allows Jirachi to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Garchomp particularly hard. Jirachi is best used on offensive playstyles that appreciate its one-off heal and ability to cripple defensive switch-ins. Since Jirachi acts as a soft check to the tier's premier Fairy-types in Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele, allies like Zamazenta and Weavile that dislike them pair well with it, as they can threaten Jirachi's checks in Heatran, Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Slowbro. Jirachi also struggles to revenge kill Mega Gyarados, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Scizor, especially once they set up, so allies like Ferrothorn and Corviknight are needed to act as sturdier checks. Finally, Jirachi is easily exploited by foes like Mega Charizard Y, Mega Scizor, and Garchomp, as all of them can switch into Iron Head and can ignore Trick provided the latter has a Z-Crystal. Allies that can take advantage of them such as Tapu Koko, Iron Moth, and Weavile make for good partners.</p>"

Bullet Seed, alongside Loaded Dice, gives Torterra an incredibly strong STAB combination when paired with Headlong Rush and hits things Seed Bomb cannot KO such as Walking Wake and Air Balloon Glimmora. Seed Bomb is a less powerful alternative but comes with the upside of not having to run Loaded Dice for reliability. Headlong Rush allows Torterra to hit Steel- and Poison-types such as Heatran and Amoonguss. Rock Blast is also boosted by Loaded Dice and hits Flying-types, such as Talonflame, Dragonite, and Zapdos, that can ignore Torterra's STAB moves as well as hitting Bug-types such as Volcarona. Alternatively, Heavy Slam provides Torterra with a way to hit Galarian Weezing to secure the Poison matchup alongside being a good option into Fairy teams as a whole. An Adamant nature is preferred to gain as much extra power as possible, but a Jolly nature can outspeed slower Choice Scarf users such as Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. Soft Sand is an alternative to Loaded Dice if Seed Bomb and Heavy Slam are run, which lets Torterra's Headlong Rush have a favorable roll to OHKO Amoonguss with a Shell Smash boost.</p> <p>Ogerpon-H is a great teammate for Torterra, as it can remove Corviknight, an otherwise large barrier for Torterra's sweeping attempts. In return, Torterra breaks through Toxapex, which inhibits Ogerpon-H's sweeping attempts. Choice Scarf Meowscarada provides speed control for Torterra while removing crucial defensive items such as Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from Corviknight and Amoonguss respectively in order to wear them down faster. Additionally, Meowscarada can threaten Dragon-types, such as Choice Scarf Roaring Moon and Walking Wake, that can halt Torterra's sweep by outspeeding it. In return, Torterra easily destroys bulkier team compositions, such as Poison, that Meowscarada struggles to make meaningful progress against. Amoonguss provides opportunities for Torterra to set up thanks to Spore, which Torterra can struggle with finding otherwise. Abomasnow provides Aurora Veil support to aid Torterra in its sweeping efforts, offers a way to beat Dragon teams, and provides an Ice neutrality, allowing it to take a few hits from Chien-Pao, while Brambleghast can remove entry hazards to let Torterra switch in and take advantage of passive switch-ins more readily. Breloom can also put foes to sleep with Spore, while using Mach Punch to remove Choice Scarf users such as Roaring Moon and threaten Baxcalibur, which can each end Torterra's sweeping attempts quickly. Hisuian Lilligant and Rotom-C can also help in the Flying matchup, where Torterra struggles thanks to Ice Spinner and Electric-type STAB moves, respectively, while also being able to scare out Corviknight. Sinistcha is another good teammate for Torterra thanks to Heatproof.</p>"

With Knock Off, Infernape can not only threaten Ghost-types, such as Skeledirge, but it can also remove key items, such as Heavy-Duty Boots, from the likes of Pelipper, Ninetales, and Baxcalibur to make them susceptible to entry hazards. However, Close Combat is generally more useful due to the amount of targets it can remove like Ursaluna-B and Ting-Lu, benefiting Fire teams. Fire Punch can be run over Flare Blitz. Although weaker, using Fire Punch doesn't result in Infernape taking recoil damage, improving its longevity. However, Flare Blitz is more reliable despite its recoil damage, and the recoil damage can be solved when running Ninetales thanks to the its access to Healing Wish. Choice Scarf is another option for Infernape, as this can allow it to outspeed and threaten would-be faster Pokemon, such as Flutter Mane, but this trades away its ability to win one-on-one against more bulky Pokemon like Ursaluna-B.</p> </section>",

Its Fighting typing grants Infernape and Fire teams a better matchup against Dark teams, being able to threaten the likes of Hydreigon and Chien-Pao while also resisting Kingambit's Sucker Punch, and with Flare Blitz, it can threaten Landorus. Close Combat is Infernape's primary Fighting-type STAB move, massively threaten the likes of Ursaluna-B and Baxcalibur. With U-turn, Infernape can safely pivot out of its switch-ins, such as Dondozo, into a teammate that can threaten them. Infernape is also able to serve as a great revenge killer thanks to its access to an Iron Fist-boosted Mach Punch, being able to pick off weakened sweepers such as Baxcalibur, Choice Scarf Hisuian Arcanine, Greninja, and Chien-Pao.</p> <p>Ninetales and Torkoal make for great partners for Infernape, as the two of them up sun to further boost Infernape's Flare Blitz. Ninetales also commonly uses Solar Beam, allowing it to OHKO threats to Infernape, such as physically defensive Quagsire, and can heal Infernape with Healing Wish, while Torkoal can remove entry hazards for Infernape with its access to Rapid Spin. Torkoal and Heatran can set Stealth Rock in order to wear down foes for Infernape to pick off. For example, Infernape is guaranteed a 2HKO on Galarian Weezing after Stealth Rock damage. In return, Infernape can OHKO Landorus with Flare Blitz under sun as well as both Ursaluna-B and Mamoswine without sun. Cinderace is another noteworthy teammate, as not only can it remove hazards with Court Change, but it is also able to revenge kill faster Ghost-types Infernape cannot such as Dragapult and Speed-boosted Ceruledge with Sucker Punch. In return, Infernape's Fighting-type STAB move frees up a moveslot for Cinderace, as the latter no longer needs High Jump Kick. Volcanion is another great teammate, as it provides Fire teams an immunity to Water, and in return, Infernape is able to threaten the likes of Iron Treads and Landorus for it. Talonflame and Moltres provide a Ground immunity, Will-O-Wisp support, and they can bring Infernape in via U-turn. The two of them are also able to lure bulky Pokemon like Ursaluna-B and Ting-Lu for Infernape to break. Talonflame also provides Defog support, while Moltres's bulk allows it to take on Dragonite, which Infernape greatly appreciates. Infernape's wallbreaking enables other wallbreakers and sweepers such as Ogerpon-H, Volcarona, and Ceruledge to clean late-game. In particular, Infernape can remove Alolan Muk and Heatran to enable a sweep from Volcarona.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Empoleon's access to a nice batch of utility options such as Stealth Rock, Roar, and Defog allows it to support its team with entry hazards, phaze foes, and deter Defog. Empoleon acts as a great special wall, being able to deal with foes such as Choice Specs Walking Wake, Greninja, and Hatterene. Flash Cannon gives Empoleon an easier time dealing with Fairy-type Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Alolan Ninetales, as well as hitting Ice-types like Earthquake-less Baxcalibur and non-Choice Band Chien-Pao. Empoleon also takes neutral damage from Freeze Dry from Alolan Ninetales and Articuno, which have to be extremely wary of Flash Cannon and Knock Off, respectively. Roar is a great option for Empoleon to get rid of setup sweepers such as Manaphy, Volcarona, and Spectrier, as well as applying more Stealth Rock damage to the Pokemon that are forced in. Lastly, Knock Off allows Empoleon to put itself in a better position to take hits from offensive Pokemon such as Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Basculegion-F, as well as crippling defensive Pokemon that rely heavily on their item, such as Articuno, Corviknight, and Alolan Muk. Leftovers synergizes well with Empoleon's Stealth Rock resistance, and it also appreciates the extra longevity Leftovers provides. However, Heavy-Duty Boots is a better option for teams with no entry hazard removal, as Empoleon is prone to getting worn down by Spikes from repeated switching. 60 Speed EVs allow Empoleon to outspeed uninvested Corviknight and 2HKO it with +2 Surf, helping prevent hazard removal.</p> <p>Toxapex forms a nice defensive core with Empoleon, as the support from Toxic Spikes helps whittle down Pokemon that would otherwise beat Empoleon, such as Zamazenta, Meowscarada, and Urshifu-R. Empoleon can also switch into the Psychic-type attacks that would make quick work of Toxapex, and Toxapex can switch in on Fighting-type attacks for Empoleon. Physically defensive Rotom-W provides a valuable Ground-type immunity as well as a slow Volt Switch to help Empoleon get in more easily. Will-O-Wisp support from Rotom-W also allows Empoleon to stand up to a physically attacking foe that it might not otherwise be able to, such as Iron Treads or Alolan Muk. Quagsire is another excellent complement to Empoleon, as it provides a valuable Electric-type immunity, as well as helping chip down walls with Spikes and Toxic support. Quagsire also helps versus Zamazenta, a setup Pokemon that Empoleon struggles to phaze, and Empoleon can in turn take on Sinistcha, a setup Pokemon that tears through Quagsire. The physically defensive prowess of Quagsire and the specially defensive power of Empoleon form an incredibly potent defensive pairing. Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes via Ceaseless Edge and stack hazard damage in tandem with Stealth Rock from Empoleon. Empoleon is also capable of switching into Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon such as Flutter Mane that would otherwise plague Hisuian Samurott. Manaphy is also a strong teammate, as Empoleon's entry hazard and Knock Off support allows it to set up and secure KOs more easily. Empoleon can also switch into foes that wish to poison Manaphy, such as Toxapex. Ogerpon-W is a great physical wallbreaking teammate for Empoleon. Empoleon's entry hazard support from Empoleon, whittles down Pokemon that would otherwise switch into it, and in return Ogerpon-W smashes Ground-type Pokemon that would otherwise beat Empoleon, such as Great Tusk and Gliscor. Choice Specs Greninja is also a great wallbreaking teammate, as it outspeeds and OHKOes many Ground-type Pokemon that would otherwise give Empoleon trouble, such as Landorus, Garchomp, and Quagsire. Empoleon is also able to safely switch into Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Hatterene and Flutter Mane. Urshifu-R thrives with Empoleon's hazard support, as almost nothing will be safe from a +2 Surging Strikes or Close Combat. If Empoleon is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, Quaquaval is a fantastic teammate. Their Fighting and Steel typings have nice synergy, as Quaquaval can take care of Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Kingambit, as well as removing entry hazards via Rapid Spin. Azumarill can deal with Fighting-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk, while Empoleon can handle Poison-type Pokemon such as Galarian Weezing, Glimmora, and Iron Moth. Pelipper is capable of setting rain for Empoleon, as well as taking on Grass-type Pokemon such as Hisuian Lilligant and Meowscarada with it's perfectly accurate Hurricane. Basculegion-F's Normal-type immunity means that Empoleon's Stealth Rock and Hisuian Samurott's Spikes cannot be removed via Rapid Spin.</p>"

Alternatively, Double-Edge threatens checks like Rotom-W and Kilowattrel. Finally, U-turn allows this reckless bird to pivot into a teammate, if there really is nothing else it can do, such as against Gholdengo or Corviknight.

          "description": "<p>Floatzel leverages the nuclear power of its Choice Band Tera Water Wave Crash under rain to be one of the archetype's most potent wallbreakers, capable of 2HKOing even problematic bulky Water-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Amoonguss. Moreover, its naturally high Speed tier alongside Swift Swim lets Floatzel outspeed the whole unboosted metagame under rain, giving it an edge against offensive teams by outpacing and threatening boosted frail threats like Dragapult, Volcarona, and every Speed-boosting Booster Energy Pokemon, such as Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake. Flip Turn allows Floatzel to pivot out of the field while weakening foes such as Walking Wake, Dragonite, Alomomola, and Dondozo that arent immediately threatened by Wave Crash. Aqua Jet picks off faster and boosted foes especially if rain isn't active, such as Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon, and outprioritizes Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Ceruledge's Shadow Sneak. Ice Spinner complements Floatzel's STAB moves to reliably hit the likes of Dragonite, Dragapult, Amoonguss, and Water Absorb Clodsire. Alternatively, Liquidation is a safer attack to keep Floatzel healthy when Wave Crash's power isn't necessary, such as against weak and neutral targets like Great Tusk, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge, and is the preferred attack to clean up late-game once the opposition is weakened enough.</p> <p>Floatzel is exclusively found on offensive rain teams. Pelipper is a mandatory teammate to reliably set rain with Drizzle and compensate for Floatzel's frailty by bringing it in safely via U-turn. Choice Specs variants of Pelipper and other offensive rain partners like Azumarill, Walking Wake, and Greninja can keep up the pressure against the opposition, overwhelming shared checks like Dondozo, Toxapex, and Tera Water Garganacl. Ground-types like Iron Treads, Great Tusk, and Clodsire provide a necessary Electric immunity while setting entry hazards, making Dondozo and Toxapex easier to break through; Iron Treads and Great Tusk also provide Knock Off to cripple the bulky Water-types, including Alomomola and Tera Water Skeledirge, by making them susceptible to Stealth Rock as well, while Water Absorb Clodsire is a rigid defensive backbone against the likes of Azumarill, Walking Wake, and Tera Grass Volcarona, all of which can force Floatzel out. Eject Button Amoonguss can bring Floatzel in safely on Pokemon like Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Ting-Lu, incapacitate foes with Spore to give it more wallbreaking opportunities, and switch into and threaten Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl for Floatzel. Pawmot's Revival Blessing compensates for Floatzel's tendency to faint early-game from Wave Crash recoil—especially against common Rocky Helmet users like Corviknight and Amoonguss—and lets it wallbreak or even clean up in the late-game afterwards and enjoys Floatzel pressuring Great Tusk in return. Kingambit is a stellar late-game cleaner that enjoys Floatzel pressuring its checks in Great Tusk and Volcarona and overwhelming a common answer in Dondozo, as well as takes advantage of Floatzel fainting early-game from Wave Crash recoil to accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts.</p>"

Zapdos can reliably check Water-types that counter Floatzel like Slowbro and Dondozo.

Spikes or Stealth Rock allow Gastrodon to support its teammates by wearing down the opposing team. If the team already has entry hazards covered, Clear Smog can be used to stop common setup sweepers such as Victini and Clefable that would otherwise greatly threaten Gastrodon and its teammates. Scald is used to cripple both physical attackers and poison-immune Pokemon with a burn. Earthquake is an alternative for more immediate pressure against Poison- and Steel-types such as Okidogi and Iron Moth, but it leaves Gastrodon unable to punish switch-ins like Celesteela and Skarmory. The final moveslot is usually given to Toxic, which allows Gastrodon to slowly wear down its answers. Alternatively, Protect can be used in tandem with Leftovers to improve its longevity while also scouting common Choice-locked Pokemon such as Latios and Enamorus. Gastrodon's great special bulk and unique resistances allow it to help out Pokemon like Skarmory, Slowbro, and Tangrowth that struggle against strong Fire- or Electric-type attacks from Pokemon like Volcanion, Sandy Shocks, and Zeraora. Gastrodon can get worn down quickly through poison and burn and therefore appreciates cleric support from Pokemon like Clefable and Blissey. Its low Defense also leaves it susceptible to strong physical attackers such as Mega Tyranitar and Bisharp, and therefore, it appreciates physical walls such as Tangrowth and Buzzwole that can handle those threats. Gastrodon is also very weak to Pokemon that use Grass-type moves such as Mega Venusaur and Iron Moth and therefore needs to be wary of coverage from Pokemon it is used to check.

Tera Dark makes Sucker Punch a more reliable revenge killing option while further boosting Crunch's damage. Tera Ground allows Skuntank to serve as a Volt Switch blocker and pairs well with Tera Blast to hit opposing Skuntank and Tinkatuff. Tera Flying can lure Ground moves like Charizard and Dugtrio's Earthquake to more easily pick them off in addition to removing Skuntank's weakness to Ground.</p> <p>With Skuntank only weak to Ground-types like Whiscash, allies that can absorb Ground-type attacks such as Gogoat, Flapple, and Rotom-F come in handy. Whiscash also makes a good partner to help with threats like Alolan Dugtrio and Tinkatuff, while Skuntank can deal with said Grass-types. Skuntank's Toxic and Toxic Spikes pair well with bulky Pokemon like Dachsbun and Chansey to stall out foes. Dachsbun's Wish and Chansey's Heal Bell also help with longevity. Misdreavus is a notably great teammate, as it offers a Ground immunity, can cripple threats such as Gabite and Perrserker with Will-O-Wisp, and can spinblock. Misdreavus can also run Hex to benefit from any poisoned foes. Item removal, such as Banette's Knock Off and Indeedee-F's Trick, can get rid off foes' Heavy-Duty Boots to benefit Toxic Spikes. Indeedee-F can also help with Skuntank's longevity via Healing Wish, although it is notable that its Psychic Surge temporarily hinders Skuntank's Sucker Punch. While being the best Toxic Spikes setter, Skuntank is also the best way to remove Toxic Spikes with the lack of hazard removal in the metagame. This is appreciated by non-Heavy-Duty Boots Pokemon like Gabite and Assault Vest Crabominable.</p>"

Amoonguss also deals with threatening Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Sandy Shocks thanks to its good bulk, Grass-type STAB move, and Ground neutrality. Toxapex, on the other hand, deals with threats like Chien-Pao, Cloyster, and Scizor with Infestation and Haze while laying down Toxic Spikes. Specially defensive Clodsire complements Skuntank by dealing with special attackers it can't handle by itself, such as Gholdengo, Magnezone, and Volcarona. Iron Moth deals with the multitude of Steel-types like Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Corviknight that Skuntank can't do much against. Corrosion Glimmora and Salazzle help cripple Steel-types and opposing Poison-types with Toxic, with each also providing different utilities; Glimmora packs Poison's only entry hazard removal thanks to Mortal Spin, which allows Skuntank to come in safely, while Salazzle's Encore acts as a counterplay against powerful setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Kingambit.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Gabite's good Eviolite-bolstered bulk and defensive typing make it a premier Stealth Rock user and an effective check to threats like Skuntank, Raichu, and Lycanroc-N. With its decent Attack and STAB Earthquake + Dragon Tail, Gabite is deceptively hard to switch into and exploit, which gives it an easier time setting Stealth Rock and negating offensive pressure. Rough Skin adds to the support Gabite provides, helping it further wear down physical threats like Basculin and Zangoose for its teammates to finish off. Stone Edge nails Charizard and Articuno and also hits Rotom-F. Dragon Tail is useful against setup sweepers like Gogoat and Tera Fighting Carbink, but Gabite can use Swords Dance instead to double as a bulky wallbreaker. The investment in bulk lets Gabite avoid the 2HKO from Lycanroc-N's Play Rough after Stealth Rock and Charizard's Hurricane at full. 28 Speed EVs allow Gabite to outspeed defensive Misdreavus. Tera Ghost helps against Normal-types like Zangoose and Squawkabilly, provides an immunity to Carbink's Body Press, and lets Gabite spinblock. Tera Fairy is another option that staves off Dark- and Dragon-types like Alolan Persian and Flapple. Alternatively, Tera Steel offers useful resistances like Ice, Flying, and Grass and also lets Gabite come in freely on Toxic and Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Because of its unique blend of offense and defense, Gabite fits well on multiple playstyles. Ice-types like Rotom-F and Articuno are the biggest threat to Gabite and must be accounted for when using it. Charizard, Rotom-F, and Carbink are checks to such Pokemon and appreciate having their switch-ins worn down by Stealth Rock, with Charizard and Carbink also offering Gabite backup against Grass- and Fire-types, respectively. If Carbink runs Spikes, it can even form an entry hazard stacking core with Gabite. Pyroar is another option for checking Ice-types that also pressures Tera Fairy Misdreavus, which is really good at exploiting Gabite, and appreciates Gabite coming to its aid against threats like Alolan Dugtrio and Lycanroc-N. Wallbreakers that struggle against Steel-types, such as Indeedee-F and Honchkrow, benefit from Gabite's presence and can also check Misdreavus for it. Cleaners and revenge killers like Electrode and Choice Scarf Basculin love being paired with Gabite, since its ability to effortlessly spread chip damage can give them an easier time picking foes off.</p>"

        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<p>Gabite can opt to run a RestTalk set due to its great bulk and phazing ability. This set helps give Gabite longevity in its phazing role because of its recovery option, which also helps it handle its checks with greater ease. Dragon Tail helps with removing setup sweepers or passive Pokemon that Gabite can't deal with such as Gogoat, Misdreavus, or Vigoroth. However, its phazing ability is also impactful when there are entry hazards on the opponent's field. Rest gives Gabite recovery, while Sleep Talk keeps it from being too passive. 28 Speed allows it to outspeed non-invested Misdreavus, while 116 Special Defense makes Special Charizard's Hurricane a 3HKO. It still has enough physical bulk for Lycanroc-N's Play Rough to only be a 3HKO after Stealth Rock damage. Gabite has the ability to turn into a spinblocker with Tera Ghost, making it an option to keep its team's hazards stay on the field. Tera Fairy helps cover its Dragon-type weakness, which Dragonair and Flapple can exploit, while also providing it a resistance to the strong Dark-types in PU like Alolan Persian, Skuntank, and Houndoom. Tera Steel turns all of its weaknesses into resistances, but be aware of threats it normally can deal with becoming a problem like Alolan Dugtrio, Lycanroc-N, and opposing Gabite.</p> <p>RestTalk Gabite works best on balance and entry hazard stacking teams. Gabite can also fill the role of status absorber, able to take Misdreavus's or Charizard's Will-O-Wisp, Skuntank's Toxic, and Alolan Persian and Tinkatuff's Thunder Wave. It lacks the ability to be a heavy damage dealer with this set, so Pokemon that can hit it super effectively don't have much trouble coming in on it. The likes of Quaxwell, Mareanie, and Lumineon are appreciated for helping take what would be 4x super effective Ice-type attacks from Whiscash, Golduck, and Crabominable. In return, Gabite helps them with an Electric immunity from the likes of Raichu and Rotom-S. Tinkatuff and Perrserker can also help with these threats as well as covering Gabite's other issues with Flapple and Dragonair. Gabite does well at coming in on the premier Fire-type attackers in the tier: Charizard, Pyroar, and Houndoom. Offensive teammates such as Gogoat, Sawsbuck, and Nasty Plot Rotom-F appreciate its presence on their team as a switch-in for the aforementioned Fire-types, or else they struggle to set up. With many of the tier's top Pokemon having a 4x weakness to Rock, such as Articuno, Charizard, and Masquerain, Gabite can pair well with them, because it walls the likes of Lycanroc-N and Dugtrio which typically carry Rock coverage.</p>"

Notably, it matches up well against common spinners like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Glimmora, especially as it can punish them from doing so with Rocky Helmet + Rough Skin. This combination is also valuable to spread chip damage onto physical attackers like Kingambit and Dragonite and punish pivots such as Cinderace and Corviknight. Dragon Tail forces out setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Tera Flying Kingambit, and Air Balloon Gholdengo, and it works extremely well to force entry hazard damage onto foes such as Tera Fairy Garganacl, Dondozo, and Iron Valiant. Tera Ghost is used to completely spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Tera Steel lets it emergency check Dragapult, Meowscarada, and block Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Tera Water allows it to deal with Gholdengo, Scizor, and Hatterene better.</p> <p>Garchomp fits best on hazard stacking teams that range from bulky offense to offense. Gholdengo is a near-necessary teammate that can prevent most attempts of entry hazard removal, and it can make use of them itself to chip down checks like Tera Water Garganacl, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Knock Off users like Meowscarada and Great Tusk can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Amoonguss, Kingambit, and Dragonite to make them susceptible to Garchomp's entry hazards; Great Tusk in particular provides Rapid Spin as well, which removes entry hazards on your side of the field and subsequently maintains your own entry hazards up the opponent's side. Offensive Pokemon like Greninja, Dragapult, and Iron Valiant tend to force multiple switches and enjoy entry hazards chipping down their checks such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Garganacl. Substitute Skeledirge is a fantastic teammate that can take advantage of entry hazards itself, use its defensive profile to cover Fairy- and Ice-types like Iron Valiant and Alolan Ninetales, threaten Defog Corviknight from removing entry hazards, and pressure Hatterene, which would otherwise prevent Garchomp's antics and use it as setup fodder.</p>"

Great Tusk and Dondozo in particular are hit hard by Draco Meteor, with Great Tusk pressured while switching in to remove entry hazards and Dondozo's Unaware letting Garchomp freely use Draco Meteor multiple times on it. Fire Blast covers Steel-type Pokemon such as Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo, the former of which would otherwise switch into Garchomp and clear entry hazards. Stealth Rock is generally preferred if a team does not have another Stealth Rock user, but Spikes can be used to capitalize on the switches that Garchomp forces. A Rash nature makes Garchomp much harder to switch into, even letting it OHKO defensive Great Tusk after one layer of Spikes, but Naive can be used to outspeed Hydreigon and Speed tie opposing Garchomp. Tera Fire is the preferred Tera type, due to it powering up Garchomp's Fire Blast and providing it a resistance to attacks such as Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Hatterene's Draining Kiss, as well as an immunity to Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W, Dragapult, and Skeledirge. Tera Steel similarly flips Garchomp's type matchup, providing it with a useful Dragon and Fairy resistance while maintaining its Stealth Rock resistance.</p> <p>Garchomp fits on offensive teams thanks to its ability to set entry hazards and wear down common defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Dondozo, with Life Orb-boosted attacks while keeping entry hazards up against common hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight. Sweepers such as Kingambit, Dragon Dance Dragapult, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Bulk Up Great Tusk appreciate Garchomp breaking holes in the opposing team early-game. Garchomp is forced out by Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Tera Fairy Garganacl, as well as Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Roaring Moon without using Terastallization, so support from Steel-type partners is appreciated to switch into these Pokemon. Kingambit is another good partner because it takes on Dragapult and appreciates Garchomp wearing down Great Tusk and Dondozo. Hatterene and Tera Fairy Skeledirge can also take on these Dragon-types while spreading further passive damage with Magic Bounce or Will-O-Wisp. Garchomp can also form a hazard stacking core with lead Meowscarada or other Stealth Rock users such as Great Tusk and Ting-Lu, and Garchomp can pressure common Rapid Spin users. Gholdengo is a great partner for Garchomp, since it blocks most forms of hazard removal while appreciating Garchomp soft checking Iron Moth. Garchomp is also prone to being worn down quickly thanks to Life Orb recoil, entry hazards, and being prediction reliant, so teammates that can clear hazards are appreciated. These include Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads, which all appreciate Garchomp wearing down their common switch-ins such as opposing Great Tusk and Rotom-W.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Garchomp makes for a powerful physical wallbreaker with Swords Dance, using its Attack boosts to ensure OHKOs against a number of foes in the metagame. Garchomp’s incredible STAB combination of Dragon / Ground can annihilate most walls and defensive cores at +2, with Earthquake reliably knocking out bulky Pokemon like Toxapex, Kingambit, defensive Gholdengo, and Garganacl, and Dragon Claw hitting a vast majority of foes that resist Earthquake, such as Rotom-W and Breloom. Dragon Claw is preferred to Outrage, as it doesn’t provide free switch-in opportunities to prominent Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene. Substitute is essential for letting Garchomp block incoming status, especially from foes it cannot always OHKO, such as Skeledirge, non-Foul Play Amoonguss, and Rotom-W. Substitute can be set up on a forced switch to ensure Garchomp gets a chance to use Swords Dance, and can be set up for free against U-turns from slow pivots like Corviknight. Leftovers allows Garchomp to heal off Substitute damage, giving it more chances to use it. With Rough Skin, Garchomp punishes Great Tusk using Rapid Spin and U-turn from pivots like Cinderace. Tera Ground allows Garchomp to hit much harder with Earthquake, giving it the extra power to OHKO Hatterene, Garganacl after Stealth Rock chip, and potentially Amoonguss and offensive Great Tusk sets at +2. Alternatively, Tera Steel is a more defensive option used to resist Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Dragapult's Draco Meteor, the latter being very important, as Infiltrator allows it to bypass Garchomp’s Substitute.</p> <p>Garchomp is a solid wallbreaker on balance and bulky offense teams, due to its power complemented by defensive utility from Substitute, Leftovers, and decent bulk that gives it opportunities for consistent use throughout a battle. Garchomp mainly struggles against Corviknight, as well as exceptionally bulky physical walls such as Dondozo and Great Tusk. Special wallbreakers like Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth threaten these walls to Garchomp and therefore make excellent partners. Dragapult can also provide much-needed special offense while pressuring Dondozo and Corviknight with Draco Meteor and Flamethrower, forming a dangerous Dragon-type spam core with Garchomp and providing speed control that Garchomp cannot, especially against foes like Iron Valiant and Greninja. Additionally, Dragapult can use U-turn to scout a forced switch and safely bring Garchomp into battle against foes like Clodsire and Kingambit. Entry hazard setters like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora are great partners, as they allow Garchomp to secure KOs against opponents like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Amoonguss, which it otherwise cannot OHKO at +2. Glimmora and Great Tusk are especially good for this role, as they can both remove hazards that hinder Garchomp’s wallbreaking potential, and the latter can cripple Corviknight by removing its Leftovers with Knock Off. Fast sweepers, such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult, can easily revenge kill Garchomp, especially when its Substitute is down. A defensive backbone made up of Pokemon like Clodsire and Corviknight is essential for Garchomp’s team. Lastly, Garchomp gives great support to late-game and sweepers like Dragapult that appreciate foes like defensive Gholdengo, Toxapex, and Clodsire being removed.</p>"

Garchomp's positive matchup versus the latter three in turn allow it to set and maintain Stealth Rock very well. Additionally, Garchomp’s solid natural bulk and good typing lets it find opportunities to set up on Pokemon like Heatran, Volcarona, and Iron Moth. Outrage with Dragonium Z gives Garchomp a stronger option that can notably OHKO Landorus-T at +1 while also OHKOing Great Tusk and Zapdos at +2. However, the Z-Move can require prediction if the opponent has a Fairy-type lest Garchomp become trapped into Outrage and easily revenge killed by foes such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. In comparison, Stone Edge bolstered by Rockium Z provides a more consistent attack for Garchomp outside of its Z-Move while hitting foes such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Corviknight harder than its Dragon-type Z-Move counterpart. Offensive teammates who can exploit the wallbreaking capabilities of Garchomp such as Mega Lopunny, Kartana, and Dragonite are appreciated, while teammates such as Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Ferrothorn give Garchomp a solid option to fall back on in the face of revenge killers such as Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p>"

        "Entry Hazard Support (Dragon)": {
          "description": "<p>Garchomp is a staple of offensive Dragon teams, serving as an unrivaled entry hazard setter, phazer, and threat to key foes such as Iron Treads, Cinderace, Jirachi, and Iron Hands. It excels at getting up multiple layers of entry hazards due to its good bulk and Speed, powerful STAB Earthquake, and access to Rough Skin. The combination of Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet is fantastic for deterring Rapid Spin from foes such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads. It should be noted that if Rapid Spin causes the user to faint due to contact damage, it will not clear entry hazards, making Garchomp particularly adept at keeping hazards up. Moreover, Garchomp has enough bulk to survive an unboosted Ice Spinner from Iron Treads and Quaquaval, so it is relatively unafraid of the metagame’s most common spinners. Outside of warding off spinners, Rocky Helmet + Rough Skin renders Garchomp broadly threatening to physical attackers in general, punishing U-turns from foes such as Sneasler and Cinderace, causing non-Punching Glove Urshifu-R to nearly KO itself from full HP if it uses Surging Strikes on Garchomp, and breaking Dragonite's Multiscale. Dragon Tail rounds out this set by allowing Garchomp to deal good chip damage while forcing out spinners such as Great Tusk and Quaquaval and phazing setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Scizor. The switch forcing capabilities of Dragon Tail synergize incredibly well with this hazard stacking set, enabling Garchomp to rack up entry hazard damage on the opposing team as it repeatedly forces foes out.</p> <p>While Garchomp is excellent at deterring Rapid Spin by itself, Dragapult provides further security for its entry hazards by acting as a true spinblocker. Moreover, Choice Specs Dragapult greatly appreciates Garchomp’s entry hazards pushing foes into KO ranges and punishing switches, bolstering the already formidable offensive pressure these sets create. Dragapult further enjoys Garchomp’s ability to take on Kingambit, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Alolan Muk, while Garchomp is grateful for Choice Specs Dragapult threatening Corviknight and thus preventing Defog. Alternatively to Choice Specs, Hex Dragapult can also become an extremely threatening late-game cleaner when combined with Garchomp's entry hazards, and the burns it spreads further help accumulate chip damage on the opposing team. Additionally, Dragapult serves as a crucial check to Iron Defense Zamazenta, which Garchomp cannot phaze if it's behind a Substitute. Hisuian Goodra makes a great pairing with Garchomp, being able to soak up the Ice and Fairy moves aimed at Garchomp from foes such as Alolan Ninetales, Flutter Mane, and Iron Valiant while crushing them in return with its Heavy Slam. Hisuian Goodra can also tank a hit from Chien-Pao and OHKO it in retaliation with Body Press, soak up hits from Choice Specs Greninja, and handle opposing Choice Specs Dragapult. In exchange, Garchomp can duel physical threats such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Sneasler for Hisuian Goodra. Dragon’s various setup sweepers such as Baxcalibur, Kommo-o, Hydreigon, and Dragonite all greatly value Garchomp’s entry hazards pushing foes into KO ranges and breaking the Focus Sashes of foes such as Ceruledge and Breloom, enabling their sweeps. Of these, Kommo-o is especially notable, as its Vacuum Wave can OHKO Chien-Pao at neutral and Greninja following a Clangorous Soul and Throat Spray boost, both of which are incredibly deadly to Garchomp. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon is a great partner to Garchomp, appreciating Garchomp’s entry hazards and ability to wear down Great Tusk and Iron Treads facilitating its late-game cleaning. Roaring Moon in turn supports Garchomp by smashing through Flutter Mane and opposing Dragapult, as well as opening up foes such as Toxapex and Amoonguss to hazard damage by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots with its brutal STAB Knock Off. Choice Scarf Walking Wake appreciates Garchomp’s entry hazards in the same vein while removing threats such as Landorus, Gliscor, Great Tusk, +1 Baxcalibur, and Chien-Pao. If instead using Choice Specs, Walking Wake’s synergy with Garchomp increases even further, as it can blast through Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Rotom-W with its powerful STAB attacks and coverage. Walking Wake can also use Flip Turn to pivot Garchomp in against foes such as Toxapex and Alolan Muk. Cyclizar can clear entry hazards from its side of the field while keeping Garchomp’s up with Rapid Spin; it can also prevent Defog from Corviknight and Mandibuzz with Taunt and remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off. Dragalge can compound on Garchomp’s entry hazards with its own Toxic Spikes and use its Fairy neutrality and fierce Adaptability-boosted Poison-type moves to eradicate Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant, Azumarill, and Clefable.</p>"

If Garchomp is almost always Terastallized on your team, Tera Blast can be used instead.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Despite the offensive nature of this set, Garchomp is still a great setter of Stealth Rock, especially when using Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / Low</strong>: While Garchomp isn't slow, it's typing leaves it very vulnerable to major speedy threats like Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao, and Iron Bundle, which is an issue Terastallization can flip on its head. If using Focus Sash, Terastallization becomes far less needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: A Steel Tera type has excellent synergy with Garchomp's typing, letting it more effectively tackle faster Dragon-types, Iron Bundle, Mimikyu, and Ice Shard from the likes of Baxcalibur and Cloyster.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Fairy is an even stronger option against Dragon-types, and gives Garchomp a better matchup against Great Tusk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: While the Stealth Rock weakness is unfortunate against bulkier teams, a Fire Tera type lets Life Orb Garchomp OHKO Corviknight with a +2 Fire Fang 93.8% of the time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: While the defensive synergy with Garchomp's former typing isn't that strong, a Ground Tera type lets Garchomp become more of a hit-and-run attacker with Earthquake, dealing good damage to Dondozo before being forced out by Yawn.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry lets Garchomp deal with major status users more easily, such as Breloom and Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Surviving shocking attacks with Focus Sash gives Garchomp new sweeping and revenge killing potential, and makes it a reliable setter of Stealth Rock if needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: This is the best option for damage output.</p> </li> </ul>"

Swords Dance can turn Garchomp into a potential wallbreaking threat, notably OHKOing unboosted Zamazenta-C and threatening a 2HKO on defensive Kommo-o and RegenVest Manaphy at +2, while Fire Blast chips Corviknight and Earth Eater Gholdengo. A Sassy Nature is preferred if running Fire Blast, sacrificing Speed to avoid a cut to Special Attack. Regenerator allows Garchomp to come in repeatedly over the course of a game. Strong attackers like Tail Glow Manaphy, Dragonite, and Zamazenta-C appreciate the entry hazards set by Garchomp softening up foes to be more vulnerable to their powerful attacks while also appreciating the defensive backbone Garchomp provides. Corviknight is an ideal partner for Garchomp, handling monstrous physical threats like Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon, while Garchomp handles special attackers like Iron Moth, Zapdos, and Heatran in return.

Download is a niche option over Regenerator, letting it secure a 2HKO on Mandibuzz and offensive Manaphy with Draco Meteor while also freeing your Regenerator slot for a teammate like Kommo-o or Great Tusk, but it comes at the cost of cutting into Garchomp's longevity. Life Orb notably guarantees the 2HKO on specially defensive Garchomp with Draco Meteor. Offensive threats like Manaphy, Azelf, and Iron Moth appreciate Garchomp for its entry hazards and ability to threaten common defensive foes, chipping them down to be picked off later in the game. Defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Zapdos, and RegenVest Manaphy appreciate Garchomp outspeeding and threatening powerful offensive threats such as Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Sandy Shocks, while Garchomp appreciates these defensive partners handling the faster attackers like Azelf and Chien-Pao that force Garchomp out. Garchomp is worn down very easily by hazards and appreciates Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Quaquaval and Wish support from Scream Tail, allowing it to come in repeatedly over the course of the game while greatly improving its longevity, especially if running Download.

Regenerator allows it to switch in more times throughout a game to find opportunities to set up entry hazards or Swords Dance, while Well-Baked Body punishes Fire-types like Cinderace and Ceruledge for clicking their strong STAB moves and increases its walling capabilities. Garchomp's inability to check threats like Chien-Pao and Galarian Zapdos facilitates another physical wall like Corviknight or Zapdos, which can switch into them and pivot out. Garchomp's inability to check special threats like Azelf, Gengar, and Walking Wake makes special walls like RegenVest Manaphy and Goodra great partners if Garchomp is not using Regenerator; if Garchomp is using Regenerator, Blissey and Empoleon are alternative options as special walls.</p>"

Jungle Healing helps offset accumulated chip damage and Life Orb recoil while also removing crippling status conditions like burn and poison. This allows Mega Garchomp to much more freely switch into Mortal Spin users like Arceus-Poison and Miraidon not running a Dragon-type attack. Life Orb, Adaptability, and an Adamant nature provide a crucial power boost, letting unboosted Mega Garchomp OHKO Mega Steelix and 2HKO Fur Coat Arceus-Poison. If desired, Defense EVs can be lowered to allow Mega Garchomp to always OHKO Eviolite Imposter Chansey with +1 Glaive Rush. Mega Garchomp pairs well with other physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X to heavily pressure Fur Coat users like Yveltal and Arceus-Ghost; in return they appreciate Mega Garchomp handling Arceus-Poison and Miraidon.

Its superb bulk enables it to check some of the metagame’s most dangerous threats in Pawmot, Salamence, Tyranitar, and Sandy Shocks. It also provides value through Sand Stream to help combat rain teams if given momentum to get in freely, as it can't hard switch into Water-types. Stone Edge enables Hippowdon to pressure Flying-types like Iron Jugulis and Salamence, in addition to being able to beat Taunt Dragon Dance Tyranitar even after it Terastallizes. Roar is also an option, as it allows Hippowdon to phaze setup sweepers like Polteageist in a pinch and synergizes well with entry hazards. Leftovers is the preferred item, as its residual healing improves Hippowdon's overall longevity and preserves Slack Off's PP. The given spread with an Impish nature and Leftovers avoids a 2HKO from Life Orb Pawmot and prevents Hippowdon from being KOed by Hurricane into Draco Meteor from Salamence after Stealth Rock while avoiding a 2HKO from Sandy Shocks without Stealth Rock. Rocky Helmet is also an option to punish physical attackers, primarily U-turn users and Maushold. A specially defensive spread is an option to handle Gengar if Pawmot is less of a concern. Tera Rock pairs well with its sand, as the Special Defense boost it receives gives it a strong matchup versus special attackers like Gengar, Salamence, and Noivern. Additionally, Tera Rock boosts Hippowdon’s Stone Edge to put more pressure on targets like Salamence. After Hippowdon has Terastallized, it is threatened by Pawmot, Sandy Shocks, and Tyranitar, so be careful when Terastallizing. Tera Ghost is an option that makes Hippowdon a strong response versus Slither Wing, Lucario, and Maushold and lets it spinblock against Donphan. Tera Fairy is an option that grants Hippowdon a generally good defensive typing, including a Fighting resistance, and makes it less vulnerable to Greninja. After becoming a Fairy- or a Ghost-type, Hippowdon is unable to check Gengar, and in the case of the latter, Tyranitar sets running Crunch as well. Tera Dragon makes Hippowdon an effective answer to rain teams through the useful Water-type resistance it provides.</p> <p>Hippowdon most commonly fits on bulky offense or balance teams for its walling capabilities. Talonflame and Noivern make for good partners, as they are capable of grabbing momentum with U-turn off of opposing Decidueye and Wo-Chien swapping in to exploit Hippowdon. Hippowdon can in return easily absorb Knock Off from the likes of Tinkaton in order to preserve the Heavy-Duty Boots they both depend on. Wo-Chien is also a solid pick for a partner as a nice fit on most balance teams, as well as an answer to bulky Water-types that may attempt to annoy Hippowdon. In particular, Wo-Chien’s RestTalk set is capable of swapping in on Quagsire easily, as it is able to shrug off Toxic. Wo-Chien can also relieve pressure from Hippowdon, as it can take on Sandy Shocks. Tinkaton also makes for a good partner, as it is able to take a lot of the pressure off of Hippowdon by taking hits from Gengar and specially offensive Flying-types such as Iron Jugulis, Noivern, and Salamence. Tinkaton is also capable of providing useful Knock Off support by removing opposing Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots to enable Hippowdon’s Stealth Rock and sandstorm damage to stick. In return, Hippowdon being able to carry Stealth Rock means that Tinkaton does not need to run it itself and can fit a more useful option. Assault Vest Cyclizar is able to check Greninja and Wo-Chien for Hippowdon and keep Spikes or Toxic Spikes off the field from the former.</p>"

It can find plenty of time to set up Stealth Rock and spread chip damage with Toxic and its ability Sand Stream. Sand Stream also allows Hippowdon to disrupt opposing weather, which is bolstered by its positive matchup against every other weather setter. Toxic notably nets a ton of chip damage on Defoggers attempting to get rid of Hippowdon's Stealth Rock and Ground-Immune Pokemon switching into Earthquake, such as Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and Mega Charizard Y. Hippowdon can Terastallize into the Steel typing to avoid Toxic in addition to Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks while maintaining its sand immunity and Stealth Rock resistance. Even beyond the simple type matchup chart changes, it allows Hippowdon to more easily check its targets such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and Mega Diancie. Maximum Special Defense EVs are ran due to Hippowdon having more valuable special targets than physical, namely the aforementioned Pokemon. Mega Lopunny and Tornadus-T appreciate Hippowdon's presence, as it checks both Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Zapdos while setting up Stealth Rock to help wear down their checks. Defensively, Hippowdon supports Pokemon such as Garganacl and Skarmory; Garganacl appreciates the sand and its attached benefits and Skarmory appreciates the sturdy Ground-type anchor and special wall. Hippowdon struggles to fend off strong physical attackers like Kingambit, Mega Scizor, Kartana, and Mega Gyarados.

Hippowdon also suffers from a Spikes vulnerability, meaning it appreciates Defog support from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Zapdos.</p>"

Toxicroak struggles against the aforementioned Drifblim and Rotom and, without Tera Fighting, Sandaconda.

Alternatively, Vacuum Wave is a solid STAB move with priority to help it revenge kill faster threats like Zoroark, Lycanroc, and Tera Ice Jolteon. Tera Fighting heavily increases Focus Blast's already high damage output, allowing Toxicroak to rip through bulkier teams. Tera Fighting Toxicroak can run a Modest nature to give it a favorable chance to 2HKO Muk at +2 with Focus Blast; however, it becomes noticeably slower, getting outpaced by Mabosstiff, Bombirdier, and Braviary.

Bruxish, as well as other Water-types like Clawitzer, appreciate Toxicroak checking bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Qwilfish. Toxicroak often relies on Spikes from users such as Qwilfish, Vespiquen, and Cacturne to chip away at foes that it can't handle on its own.

This pairs well with Encore impairing Pokemon such as Whiscash or Masquerain attempting to set up entry hazards or boost their stats. Storm Drain allows Lumineon to blanket check some Water-type attackers such as Choice-locked Basculin and Golduck. Tera Grass is normally preferred, giving Lumineon a resistance to Grass- and Electric-type attacks that it would otherwise fear from Pokemon such as Gogoat and Raichu. Alternatively, Tera Dragon can give the same resistances as well as an added resistance to Fire-type attacks in exchange for a resistance to Ground-type attacks. Tera Ghost is an option to wall Quaxwell and check offensive Normal-types such as Zangoose and Pyroar better. Lumineon normally uses a specially defensive EV spread with a Calm nature to take on threats such as Pyroar, Houndoom, and Alolan Persian well, but a more physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature allows Lumineon to take on physically offensive foes such as Dragon Dance Charizard, Basculin, and Perrserker better.</p> <p>Lumineon's best partners are ones that appreciate having a pivot to tank hits for them and allow them in safely as well as ones that enjoy Lumineon's ability to tank Water-type attacks.

Fire-types like Charizard and Pyroar form a strong core with Lumineon, with Lumineon absorbing the Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Basculin they fear, and in return they break Grass-type threats like Gogoat and Sawsbuck that Lumineon would struggle against. Other Pokemon with pivoting moves such as Alolan Persian, Perrserker, and Electrode can form a VoltTurn core with Lumineon, with Alolan Persian in particular completing a powerful defensive core with by tanking physical hits Lumineon can normally struggle with.

Earth Power takes care of Steel-types that can easily switch into Abomasnow safely like Magneton and Tera Steel Appletun. Ice Shard can be used to finish off Pokemon like Scyther and Mesprit, but it can be a wasted moveslot at times because you give up coverage or Aurora Veil. Leech Seed can be used to trade hits more easily with Blissey, which walls Abomasnow otherwise. A Timid nature is key to outspeed Modest Magneton and neutral-nature Samurott. A Choice Specs set can be run, but being locked into one move can be somewhat detrimental due to its Stealth Rock weakness and loss of bulk. Tera Ground helps with boosting Earth Power damage output and gives Abomasnow an Electric immunity for Magneton and Rotom, which use it to gain momentum otherwise.</p> <p>Great partners for Abomasnow are ones that can take care of its Fighting- and Flying-type weaknesses like Scyther, Qwilfish, and Rotom. Hattrem and Drifblim are also exceptional partners that, along with tanking Fighting-type attacks, deny entry hazards for non-Heavy-Duty Boots Abomasnow's longevity.

While Wood Hammer is more powerful, Seed Bomb can be used over it to still threaten Blissey without recoil. Ice Shard picks off weakened, faster threats like Scyther, Hisuian Sneasel, and Lilligant. Earthquake hits the Steel-types that resist Abomasnow’s STAB moves like Magneton and Tera Steel Appletun. Tera Fire allows Abomasnow to resist hits from Scyther, Pyroar, Magneton, and opposing Abomasnow, giving it a free turn to setup or attack while also granting an immunity to Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Drifblim and Rotom. Tera Ground can be used instead to boost the power of Earthquake, give Abomasnow a Stealth Rock resistance, and surprise Electric-types using Volt Switch.</p> <p>Ice Shard allows Abomasnow to take out offensive checks like Hisuian Sneasel and Scyther after a Swords Dance boost with minimal chip. To get this chip, Rocky Helmet Pokemon like Qwilfish and Sandaconda work well with Abomasnow, enabling it to facilitate a sweep. Flying- and Fighting-types like Scyther and Toxicroak threaten Abomasnow out, so checks like Rotom, Sableye, and Sandaconda pair well alongside it. Choice Scarf Mesprit pairs well with Abomasnow, threatening Fighting-types out and giving Abomasnow a second chance to sweep with the aid of Healing Wish. Articuno acts as a hard wall for Abomasnow, as it gets a Defense boost in snow and access to Haze. Pokemon like Magneton and Rotom can take advantage of Articuno by threatening it with Volt Switch to obtain momentum and crippling it with Trick, respectively. Pyroar also deals with Articuno quite well with Taunt, blocking Articuno’s Roost, in combination with Will-O Wisp, which lets Pyroar chip away at it.</p>"

Alternatively, it can use Grass Knot in replacement of Giga Drain, allowing it to 2HKO Dondozo. Earth Power allows Abomasnow to hit Steel- and Fire-types, 2HKOing Kingambit and Torkoal and OHKOing offensive Heatran on the switch. The given EV spread allows Abomasnow to outspeed defensive Rotom-W, bulky Gholdengo, and Adamant Azumarill. Abomasnow can run either Icy Rock for more snow turns, which is preferred in Cetitan teams, or Light Clay for more Aurora Veil turns.</p> <p>Cetitan highly appreciates Abomasnow's snow, as it can utilize Slush Rush to outspeed threats such as Iron Moth, Walking Wake, and Iron Treads. With Earthquake, it serves as a good sweeper against Poison, Steel, and Fire teams, which Abomasnow struggles to go against. Other setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Chien-Pao, Frosmoth, Baxcalibur, and Cloyster  enjoy the Defense boost in snow, increasing their survivability and letting them set up and sweep the opposing team. Cloyster is able to survive a Choice Band-boosted Sacred Sword from Chien-Pao under snow and hit it back with a +2 Rock Blast. Baxcalibur is able to survive an Iron Head from Kingambit and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Chien-Pao acts as a strong wallbreaker that appreciates being able to take hits under snow due to its frailty. Frosmoth deals with the Water-type matchup along with Abomasnow, being able to set up a Quiver Dance and sweep the opposing team. The snow also allows the aforementioned setup sweepers to survive revenge killing attempts from foes such as Sucker Punch Kingambit and Extreme Speed Dragonite. Froslass provides team support in Taunt and its own hazards in Spikes, as well as Destiny Bond, which can take out a foe and give Abomasnow a free switch-in. Avalugg's great Defense and access to Rapid Spin make it a great teammate under snow, checking the likes of Kingambit, Iron Treads, and Urshifu-R while also acting as hazard control for its team.</p>"

Triple Axel threatens OHKOs on offensive Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Kartana, and Sneasler and 2HKOs on physically defensive Ferrothorn after minimal chip damage. Knock Off is a powerful STAB option that heavily damages switch-ins predicting Triple Axel such as Rotom-W, Heatran, and Alomomola.

Furthermore, Weavile's longevity, and therefore its offensive pressure, is limited by its weakness to Stealth Rock, so Defoggers such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T are all very helpful. Mega Scizor's U-turn and Alomomola's Flip Turn are also appreciated to bring Weavile in safely, due to its frailty. In return, Weavile helps these Pokemon out by getting rid of thorns such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Mega Charizard Y, letting Scizor have a larger role offensively, as well as removing Pokemon like Gholdengo and Zapdos for Alomomola, which can use Alomomola as setup fodder and threaten an OHKO with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch to gain momentum, respectively. Mega Medicham and Iron Valiant are both excellent partners for Weavile, taking care of Toxapex, as well as bulky Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, with Weavile Pursuit trapping Gholdengo for both of them or forcing it to Terastallize.

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Magnezone combines its ability to trap and remove certain Steel-types with potent special wallbreaking prowess that lets it rip through common defensive staples such as Tapu Fini, Clefable, and Mega Tyranitar. It is an effective pivot with Volt Switch, though it must be wary of Ground-types like Hippowdown and Excadrill switching in. Hidden Power Grass primarily targets Gastrodon and Quagsire, and it also hits other, rarer Pokemon that share their type combination like Swampert. Hidden Power Fire is an alternative to hit Excadrill on the switch and also OHKO Scizor after trapping it. Magnezone best fits on offense teams looking for a means to remove Steel-types, primarily Skarmory and Celesteela. Removing the former enables numerous physical attackers, such as Mega Tyranitar and Scizor while removing the latter enables teammates such as Latios and Enamorus. Pivots such as Slowking can form effective pivoting cores with Magnezone, helping it safely switch into foes like Slowbro and Clefable; physically attacking pivots like Scizor can notably lure Skarmory in. Due to Skarmory possessing Sturdy and Body Press, Stealth Rock support from teammates such as Mega Tyranitar and Clefable greatly aids Magnezone. Magnezone struggles to take on Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Ting-Lu, and depending on its choice of coverage, it's walled by Ground / Water types like Gastrodon or Ground / Steel types like Excadrill, making Grass- and Water-types such as Mega Venusaur and Keldeo useful partners. Magnezone struggles to break through special walls like Chansey and Blissey, making the aforementioned physical wallbreakers useful; Pursuit trappers such as Mega Tyranitar and Bisharp are especially effective at removing these foes, and they appreciate Magnezone's pivoting capabilities.</p>"

Hidden Power Grass targets Gastrodon, Quagsire, and some rare foes like Swampert. Electrium Z powering up Thunderbolt helps Magnezone break through certain foes it traps such as Scizor and specially defensive Celesteela; Steelium Z primarily helps against Ground- and Grass-types such as Hippowdon and Mega Venusaur. Magenzone best fits on offense teams looking to remove certain Steel-types, namely Skarmory and Celesteela. This enables numerous teammates such as Mega Tyranitar and Scizor. Since it fears taking Skarmory's Body Press and Celesteela's Flamethrower upon switching in, a pivot that can lure them in like Galarian Zapdos or Scizor is a great partner. A Stealth Rock setter like Clefable can let Magnezone avoid Sturdy to OHKO Skarmory. Magnezone is completely helpless against Excadrill, so Grass- and Water-types such as Tangrowth and Slowbro can help by dealing with them. After removing opposing Steel-types, Magnezone isn't particularly useful, though it's still a reasonably strong special wallbreaker, especially if it still can use its Z-Move. It struggles with special walls like Blissey and Chansey, so physical wallbreakers, notably Pursuit trappers like Mega Tyranitar, can help by removing them.</p>"

Volt Switch lets Magnezone maintain momentum while eliminating foes such as Skarmory and chipping Heatran, which cannot be trapped and removed consistently. Alternatively, Tera Blast + Tera Fighting lets Magnezone remove Kingambit, potentially forcing it to Terastallize as well. Hidden Power Fire hits foes such as the aforementioned Mega Scizor, Kartana, and Ferrothorn. Toxic is another alternative that punishes switch-ins such as Gastrodon, Ting-Lu, and Hippowdon, though it can be difficult to justify over other alternatives, as it hinders Magnezone's effectiveness as a trapper. Magnezone should only Terastallize when it can trap and eliminate Kingambit, since teammates such as Dragapult and Dragonite take advantage of Tera better. The given EV spread allows Magnezone to survive an unboosted Sacred Sword from Kartana. Teammates such as Dragonite and Kartana appreciate Magnezone removing foes such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, allowing them to sweep easier. The former can also safely switch into Ground-type attacks for Magnezone, while the latter threatens troublesome Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Teammates such as Dragapult and Landorus-T provide pivoting support for Magnezone, granting it free entry against foes such as Skarmory and Kingambit to ease prediction. Dragapult in particular appreciates Magnezone trapping and removing Kingambit, allowing it to sweep without fear of being Pursuit trapped.</p>"

It also gives Magnezone a much-appreciated Fire resistance for Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Volcarona, and lets Magnezone take on Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying has wonderful defensive synergy with Magnezone, reversing its Ground and Fighting weaknesses, and lets Tera Blast hit Grass-types harder.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: A Fairy-type Tera Blast is very useful against common Dragon-types, most notably Garchomp and Roaring Moon, and hitting bulky Dark-types such as Ting-Lu, Wo-Chien, and Umbreon hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Gaining a resistance to Dark allows Magnezone to surprise and defeat Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Hydreigon, in addition to dealing plenty of damage to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Grass has excellent defensive and offense synergy with Magnezone, especially through its utility against Ground-type attackers and Spore immunity. Most notably, Tera Blast Grass can OHKO max SpD Hippowdon with Choice Specs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: The boost from Tera Steel makes Steel Beam absurdly powerful, with Analytic letting Choice Specs Magnezone OHKO even offensive Multiscale Dragonite!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground helps against opposing Magnezone, OHKOs Iron Moth, and deals good damage against Gholdengo and Kingambit.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: Magnezone's excellent typing means investing in bulk is a great idea. However, note that some important targets such as Corviknight and Skeledirge are a tad faster than it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Calm</strong>: With maximum Special Defense investment and Assault Vest, Magnezone becomes a good soft check against Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, and one of the best pivots in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 SpA / 180 Spe with Modest</strong>: While this spread sacrifices a large amount of power, in exchange it outspeeds Adamant maximum Speed Kingambit, who can threaten to deal massive damage otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Modest</strong>: If using Sturdy, Magnezone can run maximum Speed to outspeed unexpected foes, such as Specially Defensive Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: The increase in special bulk helps Magnezone against the myriad of Choice item special attacking Dragon-types, like Hydreigon and Dragapult. If using Calm, Magnezone can even take on Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs gives Magnezone a devastating amount of power, with even Clodsire having trouble handling it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: The temporary Ground-type immunity helps Magnezone against foes like Garchomp and Dragonite without Terastallizing.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Analytic</strong>: A Magnezone boosted by both Choice Specs and Analytic is incredibly hard to switch into, making it easier for Magnezone to generate momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: With Sturdy's guaranteed survivability and Magnezone's high damage output, Magnezone will very likely take down at least one Pokemon per game. Sturdy also helps Magnezone play around Dondozo, as it can safely come in on Fissure and use Volt Switch against it, which renders Yawn moot. However, if Magnezone switches into a Yawn and not Fissure, it should be noted that Dondozo often runs Protect to block Volt Switch and ensure Magnezone falls asleep.</p> </li> </ul>"

Regenerator only serves to further complement the aforementioned defensive traits, blessing it with the longevity needed to repeatedly switch into and answer these Pokemon. Knock Off allows Tangrowth to cripple incoming switch-ins by removing important held items, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Cinderace and Leftovers from Clefable and Celesteela, making them far easier to wear down in the long-term. Hidden Power Fire allows Tangrowth to deal high amounts of damage to Steel and Grass-type Pokemon in a pinch, most notably 2HKOing Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast greatly improves Tangrowth's matchup against Dragon Dance variants of Mega Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Bisharp, being able to OHKO the latter, although its lack of accuracy can be somewhat irritating. Sleep Powder allows Tangrowth to neutralize incoming targets it would otherwise be unable to threaten, such as Iron Moth, offensive Celesteela, and Skarmory while also shutting down setup sweepers like Iron Hands, Calm Mind Clefable, and Mega Altaria. However, Toxic can be used instead to permanently cripple Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Salamence, and Slowking, limiting their ability to pivot into Tangrowth throughout the game. Rocky Helmet allows Tangrowth to punish contact moves from the likes of U-turn  as well as Buzzwole, whereas Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to provide Tangrowth with greater longevity against entry hazards, allowing it to take advantage of Regenerator more effectively; it also helps keep Tangrowth out of KO range of wallbreakers it may try to switch in against, such as Iron Hands and Terrakion when entry hazards have been set. Tangrowth fits best on balance teams that appreciate its longevity and diversity in crippling opposing teams via its utility options. Entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu, Clefable, and Toxic Spikes Iron Moth appreciate Tangrowth's ability to deter opposing hazard removal options such as Tapu Fini and Salamence while further capitalizing on Tangrowth's tendency to remove various items from targets, such as Cinderace and Amoonguss, with Knock Off. Specially defensive teammates such as Slowking, Gastrodon, and Celesteela have excellent defensive synergies with Tangrowth, compensating for its low Special Defense by providing a solid backbone against threats such as Latios, Hydreigon, and Alakazam; Slowking and Gastrodon also help Tangrowth play around with the likes of Keldeo, utility Clefable, and Victini, which can overwhelm it easily. In return, Tangrowth can help check the likes of Iron Hands and Bisharp, which may threaten them. Besides the aforementioned Pokemon, offensive teammates such as Cinderace, Choice Specs Enamorus, and both Thundurus formes appreciate Tangrowth's ability to sponge Knock Off from Pokemon that they may be forced out by, such as Mega Tyranitar, Clefable, and Scizor.</p>"

It can safely switch into and check physical threats like Mega Lopunny, Mega Swampert, Kartana, and Great Tusk as well as scout for Choice item users such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Knock Off provides further utility by crippling switch-ins like Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Heatran, and it hits Dragapult and Gholdengo super effectively. Hidden Power Fire pressures Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor—the former of which can use Tangrowth as setup fodder otherwise—while Hidden Power Ice dents Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Earthquake is an option to threaten Steel-types hard, including Heatran, as well as Tapu Koko and Clodsire. Stun Spore or Sleep Powder cripples foes like Tornadus-T, Volcarona, and Iron Valiant, preventing Tangrowth from being taken advantage of by them, especially if not running the appropriate coverage move. Nature Power—if paired with Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain—immediately pressures Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y. Rocky Helmet chips down the physical attackers that Tangrowth checks, especially pivot attempts from the likes of Mega Swampert and Landorus-T, but Heavy-Duty Boots makes it a sturdier pivot in the face of entry hazards. Tera Steel improves Tangrowth's matchup against foes like Weavile, Tornadus-T, and non-Close Combat Mega Scizor, and it prevents it from being crippled by Toxapex, Clodsire, and Glimmora's poison. Teammates like Clodsire, Heatran, and Garganacl compensate for Tangrowth's exploitable special bulk by checking Pokemon such as Volcarona, Tapu Lele, and Tornadus-T, respectively; in return, Tangrowth handles the likes of Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Mega Swampert. Due to its reliance on Regenerator for longevity, non-Heavy-Duty Boots variants enjoy hazard removal support from teammates such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Great Tusk, with Tornadus-T in particular forming a sturdy Regenerator core with Tangrowth.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Assault Vest Tangrowth is a solid defensive pivot that checks threats such as Iron Valiant, Mega Diancie, and Kartana thanks to its typing, Regenerator, and well-rounded bulk. Knock Off cripples common switch-ins such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Tornadus-T, and Volcarona, both impairing their longevity and increasing their susceptibility to entry hazards. Earthquake hits the likes of Heatran, Iron Moth, Kingambit and Gholdengo. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be used instead to hit Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele while threatening to cripple switch-ins like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y. Focus Blast can also be used to snipe  Kingambit, or even Rock Slide to remove unsuspecting Volcarona that try to set up on the switch—the effectiveness of both options are highly matchup dependent, however. Hidden Power Ice hits bulky Ground- and Dragon-types in Garchomp, Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Gliscor, while Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Kartana. Tera Steel is preferred to turn Tangrowth's common weaknesses into resistances, helping it sponge Ice coverage from Weavile, Baxcalibur, and Mega Swampert and Hurricane from Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Moreover, it can be used in a pinch to resist Moonblast from Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Alternatively, Tera Water turns the tide against threats such as Weavile and Heatran while maintaining Tangrowth's ability to check rain wallbreakers such as Mega Swampert. Tangrowth fits best on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its ability to check Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko. Heatran receives strong support from Tangrowth, as Tangrowth checks threats such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Garchomp and pivots into foes with super effective coverage against Heatran, such as Tapu Lele and Mega Diancie. In return, Heatran checks Weavile, Volcarona, and Tornadus-T. Toxapex and Tornadus-T both benefit from Tangrowth's ability to pivot into threats such as Tapu Koko and Rotom-W, with the former receiving the same level of support from Tangrowth as does Heatran. This trio comprises a formidable Regenerator core, with Toxapex removing Toxic Spikes and checking Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Weavile, and Tornadus-T providing valuable entry hazard removal to reinforce the longevity of the core. Tangrowth is susceptible to entry hazards, which can often put it into 2HKO range of certain attacks; therefore, it appreciates entry hazard removers like the aforementioned Tornadus-T, as well as Rotom-W. Defensive cores supported by Tangrowth can fall victim to Kyurem as a result of its lethal coverage. Volcarona and Mega Scizor are teammates that can take advantage of Kyurem with their ability to set up and reliable recovery. With Tornadus-T forcing Tangrowth out, Rotom-W and Tapu Koko make for stellar teammates with their resistance to Hurricane and ability to pivot. In return, Tangrowth forces out Gastrodon, which otherwise checks the aforementioned teammates.</p>"

However, this comes with the trade-off of making Gliscor far more vulnerable to special attackers such as Choice Specs Dragapult and Flutter Mane. 148 Speed EVs can be used to allow Gliscor to fly past Dragonite and Adamant Hoopa-U and remove their Choice Bands before they can attack, but this will impinge on Gliscor's bulk.</p> </section>",

        "Entry Hazard Support (Flying)": {
          "description": "<p>Gliscor is one of the best entry hazard setters for Flying teams, owing to its ability, typing and bulk. The combination of Toxic Orb and Poison Heal gives Gliscor excellent passive recovery and immunity to status from moves like Spore from Amoonguss and Will-O-Wisp from Sableye. Furthermore, Gliscor's Ground / Flying type combination gives it an immunity to Electric-type moves like Thunderbolt from Regieleki and Sandy Shocks, which its teammates are weak to, and a neutrality against Rock-type moves like Stone Axe from Kleavor and Stone Edge from Tyranitar. Gliscor's typing combined with Special Defense investment and Poison Heal also allows it to sit on Pokemon such as non-Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Iron Moth that do not have Ice-type or strong Water-type moves. Access to Stealth Rock and Spikes allows Gliscor to wear down walls like Toxapex and Clodsire and fast threats like Greninja and Basculegion-F throughout the game, and Toxic allows it to spread status against bulkier threats like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Mandibuzz, and Ursaluna-B. Taunt pressures Defog users like Corviknight and opposing entry hazard setters like Clefable and Quagsire. Knock Off hits Air Balloon Gholdengo and removes Leftovers from Corviknight. Earthquake offers decent STAB damage against Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon, which are immune to Toxic, like Clodsire and Gholdengo and prevents foes from setting up in Gliscor's presence. Protect helps Gliscor activate its Toxic Orb against faster enemies with access to Knock Off or status-spreading moves. It also allows Gliscor to scout super effective moves like Ice Spinner from Great Tusk and Iron Treads, and diminish Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon PP by using Protect on Blood Moon turns and walling Ursaluna-B on the cooldown, and safely recover HP from Poison Heal. 60 EVs in Speed serve to outspeed Modest Volcanion and Timid Magnezone.</p> <p>Gliscor appreciates teammates like Articuno, which can use Freeze-Dry to force opposing Gliscor and Water-type Pokemon like Manaphy and Walking Wake to switch. In addition to that, Articuno can easily switch into Ice Beam from threats like Greninja and Frosmoth and other special attacks due to its naturally high Special Defense and neutrality to Ice-type attacks. In return, Articuno appreciates Gliscor's ability to threaten Steel- and Fire-types with Earthquake and block Toxic. Articuno also enjoys Gliscor's ability to absorb Knock Off and prevent the removal of Articuno's Heavy-Duty Boots. Iron Defense Corviknight is also a great teammate for Gliscor, as it serves as an answer to Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Corviknight's great physical bulk and access to Body Press allow it to comfortably switch into Icicle Crash from these Ice-type Pokemon and force them out with the threat of super effective damage. Corviknight also checks Dragon-type wallbreakers like Dragonite and Dragon Dance or Choice Band Dragapult, which Gliscor may struggle against. Articuno, Corviknight and Gliscor thus synergize well with each other and limit the opponent from sweeping through the team with Gliscor's Electric-type immunity. Gliscor also appreciates teammates like Thundurus-T and Zapdos that serve as an answer to Corviknight and threatening Water-type Pokemon like Barraskewda, Urshifu-R, and Basculegion-F, which cause problems for Gliscor. Thundurus-T and Zapdos in return appreciate Gliscor spreading Toxic and setting entry hazards, as the accumulated chip damage lets them break other Pokemon with ease. Dragonite can switch into Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Choice Band Barraskewda and Urshifu-R. In return, Dragonite appreciates Gliscor's ability to absorb status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, which can otherwise greatly hamper its wallbreaking ability. Moltres helps Gliscor spread status against various physical threats like Kingambit and Chien-Pao, with the help of Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp while also pivoting in the rest of the team safely with the help of U-turn. Gliscor supports Choice Scarf Enamorus's cleaning ability due to its hazards and status allowing Enamorus to OHKO offensive threats like Choice Specs Greninja and Choice Specs Walking Wake. Gliscor also boosts Enamorus and Galarian Moltres's wallbreaking potential by serving as an answer to their common checks like Alolan Muk, Clodsire, and Galarian Slowking, thus enabling them to sweep late-game. Gyarados pairs well with Gliscor, as it can act like a check for Urshifu-R, Baxcalibur, and Chien-Pao, owing to its type combination and Intimidate ability. Gyarados can also rack up entry hazard damage with Dragon Tail, thus working well with Gliscor's entry hazards. Landorus is also a great teammate for Gliscor, as it can run Stealth Rock to allow Gliscor to run Spikes instead and threatens physical walls such as Galarian Weezing, Kommo-o, and Great Tusk with its coverage.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Gliscor is an excellent bulky sweeper for Ground teams, being able to use its superb bulk, status immunity, and Poison Heal recovery to easily set up Swords Dance multiple times and quickly snowball against more passive team archetypes such as Steel, Poison, Water stall, and opposing Ground. Knock Off serves as Gliscor’s secondary attacking move to accompany Earthquake, hitting targets immune to Earthquake such as Landorus and Air Balloon Gholdengo while also removing foes’ items, cutting off foes such as Corviknight and Galarian Weezing from Leftovers or Black Sludge recovery and offensively neutering threats like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, Facade can be used as a strong neutral coverage option that smacks Enamorus, Galarian Moltres, and Galarian Weezing; however, running Facade means that Gliscor will be walled by Air Balloon Gholdengo and will be unable to remove foes' items. Protect allows Gliscor to safely use Poison Heal to recover while scouting foes’ moves, which can be especially useful against Choice item users such as Iron Moth, Dragapult, and Dragonite. Additionally, Protect is particularly valuable against Ursaluna-B, as Gliscor can void its Blood Moon and use the following turn to set up Swords Dance. The given EVs maximize Gliscor’s Poison Heal recovery, allow Gliscor to outrun Modest Pelipper and Adamant Scizor, and maximize its ability to duel special attackers such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Ursaluna-B, and Choice Specs Dragapult.</p> <p>Clodsire is an extremely useful teammate to Gliscor due to its Water immunity via Water Absorb, serving as a crucial check to foes such as Walking Wake, Urshifu-R, and Basculegion-F. Moreover, Clodsire can offer Gliscor Toxic Spikes support, which synergizes brilliantly with Gliscor’s Protect and makes Gliscor even more threatening as a sweeper. In return, Gliscor can absorb burns and Knock Off for Clodsire, deal with threats such as Landorus, Hatterene, and Iron Treads without Ice Spinner, and provide a Ground immunity to counteract Clodsire's weakness. Mamoswine complements Gliscor excellently by offering an Ice resistance to compensate for Gliscor’s weakness, and with a Choice Band it can easily take care of impediments to Gliscor such as Corviknight, Articuno, and Dragonite. In exchange, Gliscor can absorb burns from foes such as Sableye and Moltres and offer a Fighting resistance to answer foes like Iron Valiant and Sneasler. Ursaluna-B is another great pairing to Gliscor, acting as a special wallbreaker that can blast through physical walls such as Quagsire, Dondozo, and Slowbro. Furthermore, with Vacuum Wave, Ursaluna-B can act as a check to Chien-Pao, and if using Calm Mind, it can overwhelm Corviknight variants that do not use Iron Defense. Gliscor returns the favor by taking on Iron Valiant, Choice Band Zamazenta, and Assault Vest Iron Hands for Ursaluna-B. Ursaluna-B can additionally tackle Hex Dragapult and Spectrier, which are otherwise very deadly to Gliscor. Landorus is another option for a special wallbreaker that can use Gravity to ground and threaten Corviknight. As another option, Landorus can also run a Choice Scarf, threatening Ogerpon-W, Chien-Pao, and Zamazenta and providing safe entry for Gliscor with U-turn. Choice Scarf Great Tusk can revenge kill Chien-Pao and can also handle Baxcalibur, Hisuian Samurott, Hydreigon. With Ice Spinner, Great Tusk can further eliminate Dragonite and Swords Dance Garchomp and, if using Megahorn, tear through Ogerpon-W. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Iron Treads can additionally beat Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur while also OHKOing Alolan Ninetales, Flutter Mane, and Enamorus. Quagsire can serve as a defensive answer to key menaces to Gliscor such as Azumarill and Swords Dance Chien-Pao and stack entry hazards to facilitate Gliscor’s sweep. Sandy Shocks can zap Corviknight and Slowbro for Gliscor, provide Gliscor with safe entry points with Volt Switch, and layer entry hazards for Gliscor.</p>"

          "description": "<ul> <li>Gliscor is a great pivot in Ubers thanks to its many positive traits. Poison Heal grants it excellent passive recovery and a status immunity, meaning that it can sit on Pokemon like non-Ice Beam Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, Groudon, Clodsire, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Ting-Lu, after its Toxic Orb has been activated. Its excellent bulk lets it tank hits from and trade hits with metagame beasts like Zacian-C and Koraidon, with Protect giving Gliscor the ability to scout moves and stay healthy throughout the game. Lastly, its very useful Ground immunity lets it annoy common Ground-type Pokemon like Groudon and Landorus-T while also being Spikes-immune.</li> <li>Unfortunately for Gliscor, its low base Special Defense means it gets exploited and forced out by many common special attackers, namely Kyogre, Miraidon, Flutter Mane, and Calm Mind Arceus formes. The aforementioned Zacian-C and Koraidon can also overwhelm Gliscor after a Swords Dance, forcing it to Terastallize to not succumb to their attacks. Lastly, Gliscor's offenses are mediocre, meaning that Taunt Pokemon like Arceus formes and Koraidon can effectively shut it down, as they take very little damage from Earthquake.</li> <li>Gliscor is a good user of Spikes, as it commonly annoys most Defog and Rapid Spin Pokemon, such as Giratina-O and Great Tusk, with Toxic. Corviknight stands out as the only Pokemon that is immune to Toxic, is immune to Earthquake, and can stall out Spikes with Defog and Pressure.</li> <li>Knock Off can be used instead to cripple Pokemon like Landorus-T, Kyogre, and Ting-Lu, as well as opposing Gliscor if it doesn't use Protect before its Toxic Orb has been activated. Knock Off can also cripple Heavy-Duty Boots Pokemon like Eternatus, and it is best used with Pokemon that can lay Spikes, like Ting-Lu and Clodsire, both of which appreciate Gliscor's ability to cripple and wear down hazard removal Pokemon like Giratina-O. However, with Arceus formes everywhere in the tier, which can absorb Knock Off without losing their items, Knock Off is usually unable to cripple most Pokemon. Nonetheless, said Arceus formes still fear Toxic from Gliscor.</li> <li>Lastly, Taunt is also an option for Gliscor to deny entry hazard attempts from slower Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, opposing uninvested Gliscor, and Clodsire while also denying recovery from Arceus formes and Clodsire on the switch.</li> <li>The given spread lets Gliscor outspeed uninvested base 100 Speed Pokemon. The remaining EVs maximize bulk, allowing Gliscor to avoid the 2HKO and OHKO from Zacian-C's +1 and +3 Behemoth Blade, respectively.</li> <li>Another possible EV spread is 244 HP / 80 Def / 140 SpD / 44 Spe with a Careful nature. This makes Gliscor able to survive an unboosted Ice Beam from support Arceus formes from full, letting it use Toxic on them. This can come in handy, as support Arceus formes can be an annoyance to the teams Gliscor usually sees play in. However, this spread leaves Gliscor 2HKOed and OHKOed by a +1 and +3 Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C, respectively, and OHKOed by +2 Scale Shot from Koraidon.</li> <li>Tera Water lets Gliscor resist the Water- and Ice-type attacks that are commonly thrown at it such as Ice Beam from Arceus-Ground, Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I, and Kyogre's moves. Tera Water also allows it to resist Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade and Koraidon's Flare Blitz, which is equally important. However, Terastallizing leaves Gliscor unable to switch into Ground-type Pokemon like Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground. Furthermore, it makes Gliscor become affected by Spikes and take super effective damage from Miraidon's Electro Drift instead of being immune to it.</li> <li>Gliscor wants to activate its Toxic Orb as soon as possible in order to continuously be able to check and switch in on threats, so it is advised to quickly get it in the field and use Protect to ensure it gets poisoned. Gliscor is an annoyance for teams that have multiple physical attackers like Koraidon and Zacian-C, so its HP should be preserved in order to comfortably tank their hits. However, Gliscor should not be the only switch-in to the aforementioned Pokemon, as it can get overwhelmed fairly easily, due to them commonly running Swords Dance.</li> <li>Gliscor's Special Defense is on the lower side, with Pokemon like Calm Mind Arceus formes, Miraidon, Kyogre, and Eternatus taking advantage of this to wreak havoc with powerful attacks or, in Eternatus's case, threaten to set Toxic Spikes. Because of this, Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Water Absorb Clodsire are recommended teammates. Pokemon like Arceus-Water and Kyogre can take on the Ice-type attacks that OHKO Gliscor while also helping it not get potentially overwhelmed by Koraidon and Zacian-C.</li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its respectable bulk and fantastic passive longevity with Poison Heal, Gliscor occupies a fantastic niche on defensive teams. Its lack of use for its item slot after its activation combined with its Spikes immunity allows Gliscor to withstand weaker Knock Off attempts from Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. Gliscor can use its longevity to act as an excellent Defog user, as it can outlast common Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl. Alternatively, Gliscor can opt for Stealth Rock if its team prefers it over Defog. Roost keeps Gliscor healthy alongside Poison Heal, allowing it to drain the PP of moves such as Heatran's Magma Storm and Garganacl's Salt Cure. Toxic allows Gliscor to pressure common entry hazard setters and Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T. It also allows Gliscor to cripple offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult and Tapu Lele in a pinch. Tera Fairy gives Gliscor a generally solid defensive typing with few weaknesses, although at the cost of its Spikes immunity. The given HP EVs maximize Gliscor's recovery from Poison Heal and special bulk, with the remainder in Speed to outspeed Rotom-W. Gliscor fits best on defensive teams that appreciate its immense survivability and great support options. As such, Gliscor pairs well with sturdy physical and special walls, such as Skeledirge, Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Clodsire, since its relatively unremarkable bulk puts it at risk of being overwhelmed often. In return, it can switch into weak attacks with problematic secondary effects, such as Toxapex's Scald and Garganacl's Salt Cure, as well as help teammates keep their held items by absorbing Knock Off. Pokemon weak to entry hazards such as Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Garganacl pair well with Gliscor's Defog support, while they act as threatening late-game wincons after Gliscor has worn down their checks. Gliscor pairs exceptionally well with Toxapex, as they form an incredibly sturdy pivoting core due to their incredible passive recovery.</p>"

Facade provides Gliscor with an excellent alternative move to hit Ground-resistant and -immune Pokemon such as Skarmory, Zapdos, and Buzzwole, with its ample PP ensuring that it can outstall their recovery PP if necessary. Roost provides Gliscor with instant recovery, allowing it to check Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Heatran. The given EVs allow Gliscor to fulfill this purpose with Special Defense investment, with the HP maximizing its recovery from Poison Heal. Tera Fairy allows Gliscor to leverage a typing with few exploitable weaknesses, given Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo fear its Earthquake, while Tera Water improves Gliscor's matchup against Pokemon like Volcarona and Urshifu-R. However, it comes with more exploitable weaknesses, given the prominence of Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Ferrothorn. Gliscor fits best on balance and fat teams, which appreciate its ability to tear through opposing defensive cores while providing enough of a defensive backbone in return to facilitate this. Pokemon like Toxapex, Skarmory, and Gholdengo can exploit Gliscor's temporary checks such as Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Buzzwole, generating progress of their own. On the flip side, revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Dragapult can threaten offensive teams, given Gliscor's tendency to be overwhelmed when facing multiple strong wallbreakers. Gliscor appreciates Pursuit support from Mega Tyranitar or Kingambit, as it removes Gliscor's few true walls in Tera Ghost Rotom-W and Air Balloon Gholdengo.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Mamoswine is a staple pick for Ice teams, offering many useful traits, including a Fire neutrality via its ability Thick Fat, an Electric immunity that nullifies Thunder Wave and Volt Switch, and access to Stealth Rock. Mamoswine's primary attacking move is its strong STAB Earthquake, allowing it to threaten bulky Steel-types such as Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Magnezone, which is of great importance for Ice. Mamoswine's Earthquake finds further use as Ice's best way of dealing with Iron Hands, Toxapex, and Okidogi. Ice Shard lets Mamoswine circumvent its middling Speed and pick off weakened offensive threats such as Dragapult, Dragonite, Meowscarada, and Enamorus, as well as OHKO Landorus after Stealth Rock. Smack Down gives Mamoswine the capacity to threaten Corviknight with its powerful Earthquake and force it out, making it adept at keeping Stealth Rock up against Flying teams by making it difficult for Corviknight to use Defog. Smack Down provides further utility by allowing Mamoswine to ground and threaten Zapdos, 2HKO Articuno, and crucially OHKO defensively uninvested Volcarona. As an alternative to Smack Down, Icicle Crash can be used as a broadly powerful Ice-type STAB move that allows Mamoswine to better pressure targets such as Mandibuzz, Ursaluna-B, and Amoonguss, at the cost of making the Flying matchup more difficult. The given EVs render physically defensive Corviknight's Body Press a 3HKO against Mamoswine after Leftovers recovery while maximizing attack power, making Mamoswine much more effective at threatening Corviknight. Furthermore, they allow Mamoswine to live a +1 Flamethrower from offensive Volcarona and OHKO it in return with Smack Down, as well as outpace Adamant Kingambit and Iron Hands.</p> <p>Baxcalibur forms a fantastic offensive core with Mamoswine, providing a burn immunity via Thermal Exchange and a resistance to Water to compensate for Mamoswine's weaknesses. To complement Baxcalibur, Mamoswine sets Stealth Rock and removes bulky Steel-types, such as Empoleon and Corviknight, in order to pave the way for Baxcalibur's sweeping or wallbreaking. Alolan Ninetales pairs excellently with Mamoswine, setting snow and Aurora Veil to improve Mamoswine's defenses even further and dealing with the Fighting-types that threaten Mamoswine such as Urshifu-R and Iron Valiant. In return, Mamoswine can comfortably take Heavy Slams aimed at Alolan Ninetales under snow and threaten their users, including Hisuian Goodra, Iron Hands, and Iron Treads. Froslass can set Spikes to compound the offensive pressure that Mamoswine's Stealth Rock creates while also serving as a Fighting immunity and a spinblocker. Chien-Pao appreciates Mamoswine's Stealth Rock bringing foes down to KO ranges and breaking Ceruledge's Focus Sash to enable its sweeping and wallbreaking; it supports Mamoswine in turn by threatening problematic foes such as Gholdengo and Spectrier, as well as Ogerpon-H and Ogerpon-W if using Choice Band. Frosmoth similarly benefits from Mamoswine setting Stealth Rock and breaking Steel-types such as Heatran, while it threatens physical walls such as Quagsire and Great Tusk in exchange. Alolan Sandslash can neutralize Toxic from foes such as Toxapex aimed at Mamoswine, threaten Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, and use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Amoonguss and Toxapex and open them up to being chipped by Stealth Rock. Moreover, both Alolan Sandslash and Avalugg can help prevent Mamoswine from being worn down by entry hazards by spinning them away. Cetitan and Cloyster are other sweepers on Ice to accompany Baxcalibur that benefit from the offensive pressure that Mamoswine's Stealth Rock creates. Cloyster greatly appreciates Mamoswine's Electric immunity, and Cetitan can only OHKO Corviknight at +6 after Stealth Rock.</p>"

        "Choice Band (Ground)": {
          "description": "<p>Mamoswine is a great offensive option for Ground teams thanks to its huge Attack stat, access to priority, and unique STAB combination. Mamoswine's ability, Thick Fat, also allows for it to act as an extremely valuable resistance to Ice, meaning it can switch into foes like Articuno. Icicle Crash shreds Grass-type Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Sinistcha, and Flying-type Pokemon, such as Mandibuzz and Gliscor, that would otherwise resist or be immune to Ground-type moves. Icicle Crash is extremely threatening to Flying-type teams in particular, as most Flying-type Pokemon are 2HKOed by Icicle Crash, meaning there are no safe switchins. Ice Shard is a fantastic priority move that allows Mamoswine to stand its ground against faster Pokemon such as both Landorus formes, Cyclizar, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Knock Off is a good final option to help deal with walls that may take a bit more time to whittle down, such as Dondozo and Corviknight, as well as create permanent progress against Pokemon such as Baxcalibur and Articuno, which both rely heavily on their items, whether it be offensively or defensively.</p> <p>Mamoswine greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Quagsire, as the extra damage could be the difference between a 2HKO or an opportunity for an OHKO on lots of Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Meowscarada with Ice Shard, Icicle Crash on Corviknight, and Earthquake on Toxapex and Amoonguss. Clodsire is a good teammate for Mamoswine, as it can switch in to Water- and Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Sneasler, and Walking Wake that would otherwise make quick work of Mamoswine, as well as provide Toxic and entry hazard support. Iron Treads is another good teammate for Mamoswine, as it keeps hazards off the field in order to prevent Mamoswine from being chipped down, as well as setts up hazards of its own. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Iron Treads outspeeds and hits Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, which both threaten Mamoswine, for super effective damage. Choice Scarf Great Tusk is another teammate that pairs well with Mamoswine. Great Tusk is able to outspeed and OHKO Pokemon that check Mamoswine such as Choice Specs Greninja and Cinderace. Once faster threats have been taken care of, Mamoswine will have an easy time breaking the opposing team with its extremely powerful attacks. Ursaluna-B is a great teammate for Mamoswine, as it can absorb status conditions from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Sableye, as well as threatening them back with its extremely powerful Blood Moon. Ursaluna-B is also capable of using Vacuum wave to snipe Chien-Pao. Gliscor can also absorb status moves, as well as absorbing status moves and Fighting-type attacks that Mamoswine does not want to deal with. Gliscor is also able to support Mamoswine with Spikes and Toxic. Landorus forms a potent offensive core with Mamoswine, destroying Physical walls such as Quagsire and Slowbro, while Mamoswine deals with special walls such as Gliscor and Gastrodon. Additionally, Landorus can set Gravity for Mamoswine so that it can freely spam Earthquake. Lastly, Sandy Shocks is capable of dealing with Pokemon such as Pelipper and Corviknight, as well as providing hazard and Gravity support. Mamoswine easily takes care of the Ground-types that would wall Sandy Shocks.</p>"

Mega Gallade's good Speed tier also allows it to notably get the jump on threats like non-Choice Scarf Enamorus, Keldeo, and Galarian Zapdos. After a Swords Dance boost, Mega Gallade can OHKO a majority of the tier, including bulky Pokemon like Iron Hands, Hippowdon, and Mega Latias. Close Combat OHKOes threats like Mega Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Hydreigon while 2HKOing bulkier Pokemon like Celesteela and Gastrodon. Zen Headbutt threatens Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Iron Moth while also being its strongest move against Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Clefable. Triple Axel threatens Flying-types like both Thundurus formes and Enamorus as well as Dragon-types like Salamence, Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Mega Altaria while also being its strongest move against Mega Sableye. Knock Off threatens switch-ins like Skeledirge, Slowking, and Slowbro while also hindering foes that Mega Gallade struggles to break through like Unaware Clefable. Physical cleaners like Mega Aerodactyl and Scizor appreciate Mega Gallade being able to threaten or weaken their switch-ins such as Mega Venusaur and Skarmory, respectively, potentially allowing them to sweep late-game. Mega Gallade's frailty means it's OHKOed by faster threats like Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos, so teammates that can handle them like Celesteela and Slowbro are appreciated. Mega Gallade struggles to break through Pokemon like Mega Sableye, Skeledirge, and Unaware Clefable, meaning it can struggle versus bulkier teams as a whole.

          "description": "<p>Gallade is the premier Choice Scarf user on Psychic teams due to its great coverage options and incredible ability, Sharpness. Being able to fire off Sharpness-boosted Sacred Sword is incredibly valuable, as it hits the Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that give Psychic teams trouble for super effective damage, such as Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Hisuian Goodra. Knock Off is a great way to make progress against bulkier teams, as well as dissuade Ghost-type Pokemon from switching in on a potential Sacred Sword. Night Slash is also an option to deal more consistent damage to Skeledirge and Gholdengo. Leaf Blade is used to threaten bulky Water-type Pokemon like Quagsire and Rotom-W, as well as OHKO Belly Drum Azumarill. Aqua Cutter is an option over Leaf Blade to hit Pokemon like Landorus, Volcarona and Moltres for super effective damage, but Leaf Blade is often better due to the amount of targets it hits. A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant, as it allows Gallade to outspeed and still OHKO Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Sneasler, while the extra attack from Adamant is not necessary as most of the moves Gallade uses receive a Sharpness boost.</p> <p>Espathra is a nice compliment to Gallade, as it appreciates Gallade's ability to deal with Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon like Gholdengo, Hisuian Goodra, Kingambit, and Ting-Lu, which Espathra has little way of hitting for even neutral damage, as well as its ability to remove special walls such as Galarian Slowking and Alolan Muk. Hoopa-U is also a great teammate for Gallade, as the speed of Gallade and sheer power of Hoopa-U synergize nicely to deal with both bulky and fast teams. Hoopa-U is able to threaten an OHKO on defensive staples such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Rotom-W with entry hazard support, while Gallade outspeeds Pokemon that would otherwise shut Hoopa-U down, such as Sneasler and Greninja. Armarouge is a strong partner for Gallade, as it provides a nice resistance to Fairy-type attacks and complementary coverage to Gallade's. Armarouge appreciates the removal of special walls such as Hisuian Goodra and Galarian Slowking, allowing it to set up and apply pressure to the opposing team, and it returns the favor by taking out physically bulky foes such as Dondozo, Zamazenta, and Corviknight. Hatterene is Psychic teams' best form of hazard control, which Gallade appreciates as it tends to switch in frequently and can otherwise get chipped. Hatterene also lures in Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon like Iron Treads and Sneasler, which Gallade can take care of. Indeedee is another good teammate for Gallade, as it sets up Psychic Terrain, further strengthening Gallade's Psycho Cut and protecting it from priority moves like Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch. Indeedee also provides a valuable Ghost immunity, which prevents foes like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo from freely spamming Shadow Ball. Scream Tail is a great defensive teammate for Gallade, as its incredible bulk allows it to switch in to common Choice Scarf users such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Meowscarada, which would otherwise outspeed and OHKO Gallade. Scream Tail's access to a myriad of utility moves, such as Thunder Wave and Wish, allows it to support Gallade nicely by slowing down the aforementioned threats and increasing its longevity. Mew is a good teammate for Gallade on more offense-oriented teams, as lead Mew is the premier hazard setter for Psychic teams, and Gallade greatly appreciates the support. Galarian Slowking is a great teammate for Gallade as well, as it is able to safely switch into special attacks, as well as Fairy-type attacks that would otherwise give Gallade trouble. Galarian Slowking can also utilize Chilly Reception to give Gallade a free switch in.</p>"

Feint is used mostly for winning Focus Sash duels against Chien-Pao's Ice Shard and Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Night Slash versus Knock Off</strong>: Night Slash's consistent power is best for pure offense, potentially 2HKOing targets like Bold Gholdengo, assuming they can't stall with Recover and Rocky Helmet. If more utility is desired, Knock Off can be used for removing opposing items.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leaf Blade</strong>: Fully invested Sharpness Leaf Blade has a 75% chance of OHKOing 252 HP Azumarill and is Gallade's best hope of muscling past Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Aqua Cutter</strong>: Aqua Cutter benefits from Sharpness, but it doesn't add a lot of extra coverage.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Gallade uses Focus Sash or Assault Vest as its main tool for cushioning a big hit and has great natural coverage. Therefore, Tera is reserved mostly for emergency situations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost's immunity to Normal- and Fighting-type moves can thwart revenge kill attempts from Mach Punch users and Extreme Speed Dragonite, giving Gallade an opportunity to break Multiscale on the latter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass improves the lead matchup versus Breloom; if Gallade successfully baits a Spore, most sets can beat Breloom without losing Focus Sash. Leaf Blade also becomes an easy 2HKO on Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel flips Gallade's weakness to Fairy-type attacks to a resistance. The Ice resistance can also be used in a pinch to keep Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear from OHKOing Gallade through Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: With Focus Sash, Gallade duels opposing Focus Sash users with its hard-hitting STAB attacks and priority moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Gallade has enough Special Defense to make good use of Assault Vest if Focus Sash is already taken, comfortably surviving unboosted hits from targets like Chi-Yu. Furthermore, Assault Vest isn't rendered useless by Stealth Rock chip, making Gallade a safer mid- or late-game option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scope Lens</strong>: While Scope Lens is risky due to Gallade's average bulk and Speed, it pairs well with the increased critical hit ratio many of Gallade's attacks have.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Adamant</strong>: A maximum offense spread is standard for Focus Sash and Speed ties with offensive Adamant Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 HP / 252 Atk / 60 Spe with Adamant</strong>: For sets that run Assault Vest over Focus Sash, this slower spread avoids the OHKO from Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash after Stealth Rock damage. The Speed investment gets the jump on 4 Speed Rotom formes, letting Gallade deal as much damage as possible before getting hit with a burn.</p> </li> </ul>"

Night Slash has more offensive presence than Knock Off and is a good choice if you really need to hit Gholdengo with consistent damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leaf Blade</strong>: Leaf Blade is a great coverage option and, if Trick isn't available, your best move against Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Choice Scarf Gallade normally isn't a strong user of Tera.

          "description": "<p>For Fighting teams, Mega Gallade is one of the best choices, courtesy of its incredible offensive power, typing, and Speed, being the best counter to Fighting's biggest roadblock, Toxapex. Swords Dance increases Mega Gallade's power to the maximum, letting it freely overpower the likes of Mandibuzz and Celesteela. Zen Headbutt beautifully complements a Fighting-type STAB move, as it lets Mega Gallade easily break through any opposing Poison-types that may be annoying walls such as Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Clodsire. Knock Off is another tool in Mega Gallade's arsenal, which lets it take care of Psychic- and Ghost-types—such as Gholdengo, Slowbro, and Aegislash—and wears down Celesteela into range of Close Combat finishing it off. Triple Axel is another option to easily take care of Flying-types such as Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Enamorus. Shadow Sneak can also be considered to pick off faster weakened threats such as Gengar, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Mega Alakazam. With all its benefits, Mega Gallade has a few checks in Skeledirge and defensive Gholdengo; hence, offensive Great Tusk and Urshifu-R are great partners in helping take these down. Defensive Great Tusk also helps in setting and removing entry hazards, which is appreciated by Mega Gallade. Mega Gallade is also easily revenge killed by faster offensive threats such as Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf Blacephalon, so Assault Vest Iron Hands is a good check to stop these in their tracks and deal good damage back while also being able to pivot in Mega Gallade with Volt Switch. Breloom and Lilligant-H also helps significantly in the Water matchup against the likes of Mega Swampert and Barraskewda; they can also put opposing foes to sleep to make Gallade's setup easier. Choice Scarf Sneasler helps in the Fairy matchup against the likes of Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko while also being able to set and absorb Toxic Spikes and can U-Turn to pivot in Mega Gallade safely. Iron Valiant is also an amazing partner in the form of a specially offensive threat, complementing Mega Gallade, as it can easily take care of Mega Sableye. Choice Scarf Iron Valiant also outspeeds Mega Swampert under rain and Regieleki under Electric Terrain, making it a great revenge killer if Mega Gallade gets knocked out.</p>"

        "Swords Dance (Psychic)": {
          "description": "<p>Mega Gallade is a potent wallbreaker on Psychic teams thanks to its greatly appreciated Dark neutrality and good coverage in Knock Off and Triple Axel. Swords Dance allows Mega Gallade to grab a boost on a forced switch and potentially win the game with its high base Speed and astronomical Attack after one boost. Knock Off is crucial to hit opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Slowbro and Gholdengo that would otherwise wall this set, and its item removal is always handy in breaking defensive teams reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots down with Stealth Rock damage and removing key items from Celesteela and Toxapex. Finally, Zen Headbutt does massive work against Poison teams after a single Swords Dance and deals high amounts of damage to Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Buzzwole and Toxapex. Triple Axel is another alternative, allowing Mega Gallade to hit Flying- and Dragon-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Shadow Sneak can allow Mega Gallade to outspeed and take out Ghost-types such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Choice Scarf Blacephalon that could otherwise beat it. Tapu Lele forms a wallbreaking core with Mega Gallade, as they both threaten common checks to each other. Tapu Lele beats Mega Sableye with Moonblast, while Mega Gallade crushes Steel-types such as Heatran and Celesteela that trouble Tapu Lele with Close Combat. Jirachi can take Fairy-type attacks such as Tapu Lele's Moonblast aimed for Mega Gallade, as well as paralyze threats and beat them down with Thunder Wave and Serene Grace-boosted Iron Head, letting Mega Gallade break through them with a timely paralysis. Finally, Jirachi provides Stealth Rock support and a safe pivot in with U-turn. Victini provides speed control with Choice Scarf and defeats Steel-types such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo that Mega Gallade is forced out by while appreciating Mega Gallade's ability to pound Heatran to dust. Deoxys-S provides entry hazard and dual screens support, which Mega Gallade can take advantage of with Knock Off and Swords Dance to break through bulkier teams. Slowbro provides crucial momentum with Teleport while also being able to annoy teams with Scald burns and Future Sight and switch in repeatedly through Regenerator. Celebi can break through troubling physical walls such as Hippowdon and Dondozo that Mega Gallade struggles to make progress against. Finally, Choice Scarf Latias can both remove entry hazards with Defog and use Healing Wish to give Mega Gallade a second chance to break through the opposing team.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Froslass is a great addition to Ice-type teams as it not only provides an immunity to Fighting-type moves and Rapid Spin, but also serves as a fantastic lead that is able to both set up its own entry hazards and prevent the opponent from doing the same. Taunt prevents hazards and status from foes such as Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, and is also used to deny Defog from Corviknight or Talonflame. However, it must be careful as most Corviknight and Talonflame can simply attack Froslass for super effective damage. When paired with Focus Sash, Taunt increases the chances of Froslass taking an opponent down with Destiny Bond, but it can also be used in tandem with Mental Herb to punish opponents like Sableye, Grimmsnarl, and opposing Froslass that attempt to Taunt Froslass, Taunting them in return. Spikes serves to punish switches on the opponent's side and weaken their team, allowing for Froslass's teammates to clean late-game. Shadow Ball is Froslass's answer to Hatterene, 2HKOing it as it comes in to bounce Spikes back, and it's Froslass's main source of damage to prevent it from being too passive. Froslass's last moveslot can utilize Destiny Bond to take an opponent down with it, but Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are also options to consider as they allow you to status Pokemon that like to play around Destiny Bond, such as Kingambit and Volcarona. Focus Sash is the preferred item as it ensures that Froslass will always get at least one layer of Spikes up, but Mental Herb can also be used to ignore Taunt from faster leads while Heavy Duty-Boots allows Froslass to safely switch back in to block spinners such as Cyclizar and Quaquaval.</p> <p>All of Froslass's teammates appreciate it spreading Spikes on the opposing field and preventing hazards from going up on theirs. After Spikes, Choice Band Chien Pao 2HKOes Iron Hands, while Shell Smash Cloyster and Belly Drum Cetitan can attempt to set up and sweep without fear of getting stopped by an opposing Focus Sash. Baxcalibur benefits from Froslass paralyzing faster threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, enabling it to outspeed and take them out, though Froslass needs an intact Focus Sash for this. Similarily, Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Iron Defense Avalugg also benefit from the opportunities to set up against foes that have been burned by Froslass and no longer pose much of a threat to it. Avalugg can also support Froslass by switching into strong physical attacks to scout. Abomasnow's Snow Warning increases Froslass's physical bulk and makes it less wary of other attacks coming from spinners, such as Great Tusk's Knock Off.</p>"

Tera Electric powers up Volt Switch and removes Rotom's weaknesses to Dark and Ghost, improving its matchup against Mabosstiff, Umbreon, Haunter, and opposing Rotom.

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Rotom-W's defensive set might be the more known one, but Rotom-H's key resistances to Fairy-type attacks and U-turn, plus its ability to put serious pressure on Gholdengo, make it a good alternative as a bulky pivot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Foul Play</strong>: Foul Play is a must-have, as otherwise, Rotom-H is extremely passive against Baxcalibur, which is likely to switch in for an Attack boost from Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp versus Thunder Wave</strong>: Will-O-Wisp is the preferred status move, potentially shutting down major physical threats such as Dragonite, Mimikyu, and Iron Hands. Thunder Wave is still a reasonable choice, though, stopping special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Iron Moth in their tracks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick and Flame Orb</strong>: This one-use method of burning may seem silly, but taking away important items can be devastating against certain Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, and Rotom-H can use this to get rid of troublesome Choice items if it's taken a Trick as well. Note that Rotom-H will burn itself if it Terastallizes while holding Flame Orb, which is generally not good outside of blocking sleep or Toxic poison.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using a Neutral Nature with a Bold Mint</strong>: If using Trick, it's best to run a neutral nature such as Serious and change the stat boosts with a Bold Mint. This way, Rotom-H won't get confused by any Berry it receives.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Rotom-H's defensive typing is very valuable, so Tera is normally reserved for very specific situations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel with Levitate is a sublime defensive typing, letting Rotom-H better handle huge threats like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is an alternative option to soak up Dragon-type attacks, and it also gives Rotom-H a better matchup against Great Tusk and Iron Hands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While this unfortunately makes Gholdengo a much bigger issue, Tera Ghost is still worth considering for making Rotom-H immune to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Iron Valiant's Close Combat. It also lets Rotom-H switch out of trapping moves without using Volt Switch.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry is Rotom-H's ticket to staying around the longest, usually avoiding 2HKOs from powerful unboosted attacks such as Dragonite's Outrage and Iron Valiant's Close Combat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rotom-H's typing makes it a good user of Rocky Helmet, passively punishing physical Fairy-types such as Mimikyu and Iron Valiant and making it a good response to expected uses of U-turn.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Rotom-W is one of the metagame's best defensive pivots thanks to its unique typing accentuated with Levitate, allowing it to check prominent Pokemon like Dragonite, Kingambit, Scizor, and Garchomp. Aside from gaining momentum, its STAB Volt Switch threatens common Pokemon like Corviknight, Dondozo, and Toxapex. Hydro Pump pressures Garganacl, Cinderace, and Skeledirge, but most importantly, it dents Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu that attempt to block its Volt Switch. Moreover, its immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes make it an even more effective pivot in the face of entry hazards. Aside from gaining valuable Leftovers recovery, Protect scouts for Choice item users like Meowscarada, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Greninja, potentially stalls out burn damage, and punishes Cinderace's High Jump Kick. Thunder Wave cripples Dragapult and special Iron Valiant. Will-O-Wisp punishes physical attackers such as Dragonite, Roaring Moon, Azumarill, and Kingambit, and it chips down switch-ins like Amoonguss and Clodsire in the long-term. Tera Steel improves Rotom-W's matchup against Dragonite, Dragapult, and Meowscarada, prevents it from being crippled by Clodsire and Toxapex's Toxic, and makes it resistant to Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Tera Water can be run as a purely offensive option, improving Hydro Pump's damage to 2HKO Garganacl through Leftovers, Unaware Clodsire, and potentially Tera Fairy Skeledirge. The Speed EVs let Rotom-W outspeed uninvested Great Tusk and paralyzed Dragapult.</p> <p>Rotom-W finds a place on bulky offense teams, especially VoltTurn teams, that maximum its potential. Offensive pivots like Dragapult, Cinderace, Meowscarada, and Scizor form a sturdy pivot core with Rotom-W; Cinderace appreciates being brought in safely on Amoonguss, while Dragapult and Meowscarada similarly like being brought in on Pokemon like Toxapex, opposing Rotom-W, and Garganacl. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Great Tusk take advantage of the multiple switches that pivot teams tend to force, crumbling the opposing team slowly just by keeping up momentum; in return, Rotom-W helps check entry hazard removers like Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads. Due to Rotom-W's nature of constantly pivoting, spinners and Defoggers like Great Tusk and Corviknight are appreciated; Great Tusk, in particular, can threaten Clodsire, one of Rotom-W's sturdiest answers, while Corviknight's U-turn complements Rotom-W's pivoting duties. Defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu are viable options to cover threats like Breloom, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult, respectively; in return, they enjoy Rotom-W checking Cinderace and Garchomp. Pokemon that can switch into Meowscarada and Great Tusk's Knock Off, such as Corviknight and Amoonguss, are valuable to maintain Rotom-W's longevity from its Leftovers.</p>"

        "Specially Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>With its unique typing backed up by a good Special Defense stat and access to Volt Switch and Levitate, Rotom-W is one of the best defensive pivots and Ground immunities in the tier. Rotom-W's STAB Hydro Pump lets it threaten Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Sandy Shocks aiming to block its Volt Switch. Its bulk in Special Defense lets it sponge attacks from special attackers such as Walking Wake, Hisuian Zoroark, and Iron Valiant and cripple them with Thunder Wave. Protect lets Rotom-W gain Leftovers recovery as well as scout the intentions of Choice item users like Gholdengo and Greninja. 12 Speed EVs lets Rotom-W outspeed 0 Speed Great Tusk and paralyzed Dragapult. Tera Fairy grants Rotom-W an immunity to some of the tier's most powerful special attacks in Walking Wake's, Dragapult's, and Garchomp's Draco Meteor, allowing it to handle them more easily. Tera Steel provides Rotom-W with a resistance to said Dragon-type attacks and an immunity to Toxapex's and Clodsire's Toxic, making for an excellent defensive typing in conjunction with Levitate. Tera Steel also improves Rotom-W's matchup against Dragonite, letting it cripple it with Thunder Wave and pivot out into one of its teammates.</p> <p>Bulky offense teams appreciate Rotom-W's defensive profile and ability to pivot while maintaining an offensive presence. Cinderace appreciates Rotom-W's ability to threaten Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Skeledirge, and in return, it threatens Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Breloom, and Meowscarada that resist both of Rotom-W's STAB moves. Great Tusk can rely on Rotom-W to take Water-type attacks from Walking Wake and Greninja and in return provide hazard removal to keep Rotom-W healthy throughout the game, as well as threaten Water Absorb Clodsire, which completely walls Rotom-W. Rotom-W threatens both Dondozo and Great Tusk, which Kingambit can struggle to break past, and enjoys Kingambit checking Calm Mind Hatterene and Dragon Dance Dragapult that may use Rotom-W as a setup opportunity. While Rotom-W struggles to beat Walking Wake, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Roaring Moon one-on-one, its ability to cripple them with Thunder Wave lets teammates like Dragapult and Iron Valiant deal with them more easily. Defensive teammates such as Corviknight and Amoonguss can check the aforementioned Grass-types that are troublesome for Rotom-W, and provide bulk for Rotom-W to not get overwhelmed by repeated hits.</p>"

        "Choice Scarf": {
          "description": "<p>Equipped with a Choice Scarf, Rotom-W provides excellent utility as a fast pivot thanks to its Volt Switch, devastating status moves, and high-Base Power STAB move in Hydro Pump. Volt Switch keeps up momentum during the game, and it can super effectively hit Corviknight, Dondozo, Toxapex, and Greninja, which Rotom-W now outspeeds thanks to its Choice Scarf. Hydro Pump is the strongest move it has, meaningfully hurting a wide range of Pokemon, and it punishes Ground-types such as Greak Tusk, Clodsire, and Garchomp that attempt to block Volt Switch. Rotom-W can outspeed the entire unboosted metagame with its Choice Scarf, allowing it to reliably hit Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Garganacl. Trick is essential to cripple walls that can recover from Rotom-W's attacks, like Toxapex and Tera Fairy Garganacl. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple threats such as Dragapult and Iron Moth, especially since Choice Scarf Rotom-W outspeeds them. Will-O-Wisp is just as useful as Thunder Wave, disarming physical threats like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, Breloom, and Meowscarada. Tera Steel gives Rotom-W an immunity to Toxic from Clodsire and Toxapex, as well as a resistance to Meowscarada's Flower Trick, Breloom's Bullet Seed, Iron Valiant's Moonblast, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. On top of this, Levitate makes Steel's Ground weakness into an immunity; notably, EdgeQuake can't hit Tera Steel Rotom-W neutrally. Alternatively, Tera Water takes a more offensive approach, boosting the power of Hydro Pump to 2HKO Gholdengo, and it can potentially OHKO physically defensive Garganacl and Clodsire.</p> <p>Rotom-W sits comfortably on balance and bulky offense teams. It pairs well with defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Amoonguss, which use their Grass resistances and/or recovery to sponge hits like Breloom's Bullet Seed, Meowscarada's Flower Trick, and Ting-Lu's Ruination. Rotom-W pressures entry hazard removers like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Cinderace, which helps hazard setters. Great Tusk is a great example, since it also removes hazards to ease Rotom-W's pivoting. More offensive partners like Iron Valiant, Cinderace, and Dragapult love Rotom-W crippling bothersome walls like Ting-Lu and Amoonguss with Trick. In turn, they can effectively check Breloom, Meowscarada, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Choice Specs Dragapult, which can all cause trouble for Rotom-W. When Rotom-W pivots against Corviknight, Dondozo, Toxapex, and Greninja as they switch out, frail attackers such as Meowscarada, Cinderace, and Iron Valiant can safely come in to pressure the incoming Amoonguss, opposing Rotom-W, and Gholdengo.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Rotom-W is the premier physical wall for Electric teams due to Levitate and its bulk, which make it a great help in the Ground matchup, its ability to spread burns, and its resistance to Ice and Water, which is great against Mamoswine. Will-O-Wisp is an excellent move for significantly weakening physical threats such as Barraskewda, Chien-Pao, Great Tusk, and Kingambit. Hydro Pump threatens Ground-type Pokemon that Electric teams would otherwise struggle against, such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Mamoswine. Volt Switch allows Rotom-W's more threatening wallbreaking teammates to come in more easily. Foul Play enables Rotom-W to hit Baxcalibur, which cannot be burned, Dragonite, and physically oriented Dragapult. It also prevents Rotom-W from becoming setup fodder. Protect is a solid option to give Rotom-W an extra turn to recover some HP, inflict more burn damage on foes, and potentially scout what set the opponent may be running, which is especially valuable versus Choice-locked enemies such as Chien-Pao and Meowscarada. The given EV spread maximizes Rotom-W's physical bulk while also allowing it to outspeed and burn Jolly Azumarill.</p> <p>Assault Vest Magnezone forms a nice defensive core with Rotom-W, where Magnezone is able to act as a special wall, while Rotom-W is able to act as a physical wall, as well as switch in on Ground-type attacks that would otherwise make quick work of Magnezone. Magnezone can also switch into attacks from Pokemon like Hatterene, Gholdengo, and Flutter Mane and Toxic from the likes of Amoonguss, Mandibuzz, and Toxapex, as well as forming a nice Volt Switch pivot core. Iron Hands is another great teammate for Rotom-W. Not only is Iron Hands able to come in for free after a Volt Switch from Rotom-W, but Rotom-W is also able to burn opposing Pokemon to bolster Iron Hands's Longevity. Iron Hands is also capable of taking care of Meowscarada, Hisuian Goodra, and Ogerpon-W. Defensive Zapdos is able to make quick work of pesky Grass-type Pokemon that stop Rotom-W in its tracks, such as Ogerpon-H, Ogerpon-W, Amoonguss, and Sinistcha. Sandy Shocks is the best entry hazard setter for Electric teams, and it pairs nicely with Rotom-W, which can force uncomfortable switches thanks to the looming threat of Will-O-Wisp. The revolving door of Volt Switches can force a lot of damage on opposing teams, thus making games easier to close out. Thundurus-T's array of coverage makes it a great teammate for Rotom-W. Thundurus-T can use Grass Knot to deal with Pokemon such as Quagsire and Gastrodon, as well as Psychic to deal with Pokemon like Amoonguss and Clodsire. Pawmot can use Seed Bomb to threaten Quagsire, Gastrodon, and opposing Rotom-W while also hitting Hydreigon, Baxcalibur and Ursaluna-B with STAB Close Combat. Regieleki can use its blistering Speed tier to take care of Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, while also using Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock to keep Rotom-W alive for a longer period of time.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Rotom-W is a great Nasty Plot sweeper for Electric teams due to Levitate and its bulk, which lets it greatly ease the Ground matchup. Stored Power deals with Unaware and Water Absorb users such as Quagsire and Clodsire, letting it threaten the entirety of Ground teams in conjunction with Hydro Pump. Substitute lets it avoid status and take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Klefki and Toxapex, eases prediction, and forces its checks such as Greninja and Ting-Lu to take damage. The given EV spread prevents Rotom-W's Substitute from breaking to Clodsire's Poison Jab while outspeeding threats such as Gholdengo and Kleavor.</p> <p>Teammates such as Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks and Iron Hands love Rotom-W's ability to deal with or wear down bulky Pokemon such as Clodsire and Gastrodon, allowing them to clean up types like Poison and Water late-game. In return, Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks deals with fast threats such as Choice Specs Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Scovillain, while Iron Hands pressures matchups such as Dark and Dragon due to its sheer bulk and coverage in Ice Punch. Pawmot can revive Rotom-W with Revival Blessing, which allows it to take more risks. Additionally, Pawmot has good coverage moves in Seed Bomb and Ice Punch, which lets it break down types such as Water, Flying, and Ground alongside Rotom-W. Choice Specs Kilowattrel deals with fast threats such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Choice Specs Greninja, and Volcarona, removes Grass-types like Amoonguss and Breloom, and pivots Rotom-W in with Volt Switch or U-turn. Assault Vest users such as Magnezone and Eelektross deal with special attackers such as Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Greninja for Rotom-W.

Will-O-Wisp hinders physical attackers more reliably than Scald. Alternatively, Apple Acid breaks down defensive Pokemon such as Garganacl, while Haze neutralizes slow setup sweepers such as Scizor and Freeze-Dry hits Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp super effectively. Roost provides consistent recovery, while Strength Sap makes Rotom-W more effective against physical attackers such as Great Tusk, but leaves it unable to recover against Gholdengo. The given Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed uninvested Great Tusk, but more Speed can be run to handle certain threats; 224 Speed outspeeds Palafin, while 240 Speed with a Timid nature outpaces Gholdengo. Tera Steel allows Rotom-W to more easily pivot into Toxapex and take on Dragon-types such as Garchomp. Alternatively, Tera Electric strengthens Volt Switch and makes Rotom-W less vulnerable to Salt Cure. Rotom-W appreciates partners that can pivot such as Ting-Lu, Slither Wing, and Corviknight. Physical walls like Garganacl and Skeledirge after Terastallizing can take on many of the physical attackers that Rotom-W cannot handle.

Its Ground immunity and Water-type resistance make Pokemon like Mega Swampert unable to bother it; it also has access to Hydro Pump to hit annoying Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Hippowdon. Rotom-W is also a really good blanket check to Ice- and Fire-types like Mamoswine, Victini, and Galarian Darmanitan. Volt Switch provides great momentum, which is needed in hyper offense teams. In addition to providing momentum, Rotom-W has access to Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, crippling foes such as Mega Garchomp and Mimikyu with Will-O-Wisp, while Toxic punishes switch-ins such as Gastrodon and Kyurem. Defog lets Rotom-W compress roles, freeing up Zapdos to run Choice Specs, while Rotom-W prevents hazards from hurting teammates. Pain Split is another option, as it massively improves Rotom-W's longevity; however, this requires Zapdos to run Defog. The 44 invested Speed EVs ensure Rotom-W outspeeds Jolly Azumarill so that it can punish Azumarill for setting up Belly Drum with Will-O-Wisp or Volt Switch. Zapdos covers Rotom-W's weakness to Grass-types with access to Hurricane and Heat Wave, being able to OHKO the likes of Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, respectively, while also being immune to Mold Breaker Excadrill's Earthquake. Regieleki can be used as a Rapid Spinner, removing pressure from Rotom-W to function as the only hazard removal while also luring in Ground-types that Rotom-W can punish such as Iron Treads or Great Tusk. With access to Taunt and having an amazing Speed tier, Zeraora can prevent hazards from coming up and allow Rotom-W to switch in freely and get off a strong Hydro Pump or gain a lot of momentum and Volt Switch into one of its offensive teammates. Zeraora also pressures Hydreigon and Gholdengo, which can use Rotom-W as setup fodder. Iron Hands provides the coverage and bulk against Pokemon like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Volcarona, and SubRoost Kyurem that Rotom-W can't deal with while also putting a lot of pressure on Normal teams, as Rotom-W can Volt Switch against Blissey into Iron Hands and force Blissey to tank a hit or switch out. Alolan Raichu gives Rotom-W's slow Volt Switch a lot of value as it is strong but frail, being able to deal with Ice-types like Baxcalibut with Focus Blast and Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Clodsire with Psyshock. Magnezone provides a valuable Poison immunity while also checking other threats like Tapu Lele, Meowscarada, and Alolan Ninetales.</p>"

Discharge has a chance to paralyze and cripple bulky switch-ins like Serperior, Tapu Lele, and Dragonite. Substitute keeps Rotom-W safe from status moves like Toxic and generates free turns for it to set up, turning many common utility Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Alomomola, and Heatran into Rotom-W's setup fodder. Volt Switch and Will-O-Wisp can be used as an alternative combination, the former helping Rotom-W keep up the momentum and the latter helping to cripple threats such as Dragonite and Garchomp. However, this combination is less effective for wallbreaking because it makes Rotom-W vulnerable to status moves and forces it to switch out if it needs to use its Electric-type STAB move, losing the boost from Nasty Plot. Tera Ghost combined with Levitate counters several popular Ground-type threats like Ursaluna, Sword Dance Gliscor, and Great Tusk, while Tera Steel and Tera Poison complement Levitate well and let Rotom-W effectively wall utility variants of Gliscor, the former improving its matchup into Tapu Lele and the latter granting it a resistance to common Fighting-type attacks from Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Urshifu-R. 44 Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T so it can set up Substitute first and dodge Toxic, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into bulk so it can check the aforementioned physical threats better. With most Rotom-W sets being pure utility, this set can often come across as a surprise to the would-be bulky checks to it such as Clefable, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking, and it can also disrupt the opponent's pace by setting up Substitute and boost with Nasty Plot. However, both of its STAB moves are resisted by Grass-types and Dragon-types, which means it loses to the likes of Ferrothorn and Raging Bolt even after boosting. Serperior and Kyurem especially prey on this set because they both can use it as setup fodder.</p>"

Hydro Pump discourages Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Ursaluna-B from coming in and blocking Volt Switch. Trick neutralizes setup threats such as Iron Defense Garganacl as well as walls such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn, greatly assisting offensive cores in breaking through. Thunder Wave cripples offensive threats such as Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, making them much easier to revenge kill and neutering the impact they have for the remainder of the game. Slower offensive Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Ogerpon-W enjoy being able to outspeed and threaten said threats that would previously be an issue. However, Will-O-Wisp is another great alternative, stopping foes such as Mega Lopunny and Urshifu-R from freely breaking through teams while helping their checks such as Toxapex and Alomomola stay healthier and ease the burden of checking them continuously throughout the game. Finally, Pain Split can be used, keeping Rotom-W healthy versus bulkier teams and being a huge thorn on walls after using Trick. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Tornadus-T are also useful teammates for it, preventing Rotom-W from taking Stealth Rock chip and preserving its longevity. The given EV spread and a Timid nature maximizes its bulk and Speed, helping it be as bulky and fast as possible as effectively as possible. Tera Steel helps it sponge hits like Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Baxcalibur's Scale Shot and cripple said threats, while Tera Ghost lets Rotom-W check Sneasler and wall Great Tusk.</p>"

Steam Eruption provides more consistent damage output and a potential burn, while Water Spout has potentially higher damage, won't miss, and can OHKO Ice Scales Arceus-Fairy after Nasty Plot and Spikes. Strength Sap is necessary to keep Dragon Energy and Water Spout's damage high as well as to allow Palkia-O greater freedom to switch in. Tera Dragon allows Dragon Energy to OHKO Dondozo and +4 Dragon Energy to OHKO Ice Scales Dialga-O, while Tera Water lets Palkia-O withstand Fairy-type attacks from users like Arceus-Fairy and Zacian. Palkia-O's best fit is on offense teams that can maximize the opportunities it gets and can easily pressure faster threats like Koraidon. Prankster and Ice Scales Chansey are complete counters for Palkia-O, as they are never threatened by its attacks and make Strength Sap worthless; as such, mixed attacking teammates like Enamorus and Triple Arrows Arceus-Ghost are highly recommended.

          "description": "<p>With its unique typing and high stats all around the board, Heatran makes for a bulky attacker able to threaten all kinds of Pokemon in the tier. Magma Storm allows Heatran to trap and potentially remove opposing Pokemon, as well as chipping them down with its passive damage. Earth Power hits Toxapex and Fire-types such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, Volcanion, and opposing Heatran for super effective damage. Taunt can be used to stop Toxapex's Recover and Galarian Slowking's Chilly Reception and Slack Off, thus allowing Heatran to trap them. Heatran is an effective Stealth Rock user thanks to its good matchup against common entry hazard removal options in Defog Corviknight and bulky Court Change Cinderace. Tera Blast Grass gives Heatran a way to hit Water-types such as Rotom-W, Hisuian Samurott, and Azumarill, as well as threatening an OHKO against Great Tusk. Furthermore, Tera Grass works well with Flash Fire and turns Heatran's Ground and Water weaknesses into resistances, improving its matchup against the aforementioned Pokemon as well as Volcanion and letting it potentially trap the likes of Dondozo and Clodsire. Leftovers lets Heatran heal throughout the game and makes it easier for it to trap its targets. Air Balloon is another option that allows Heatran to take a hit from Pokemon that would usually target it with Earthquake or Earth Power such as Enamorus, Ursaluna, and opposing Heatran and heavily damage them. The matchup against opposing Heatran also makes a Timid nature desirable to outspeed the other and hit it with Earth Power; it also lets Heatran outspeed the likes of Modest Gholdengo and Volcanion. Alternatively, Heatran can opt to run a Modest nature to further boost its power.</p> <p>Heatran usually finds itself on bulky offense teams due to its ability to threaten defensive Pokemon and common forms of entry hazard control. Kingambit appreciates Heatran's support against Will-O-Wisp users in Cinderace, Dragapult, and Moltres and its ability to take on walls such as Corviknight as well as Dondozo and Great Tusk if Terastallized. Heatran's ability to force heavy damage against Amoonguss, Hatterene, and defensive Zapdos makes it a good Great Tusk partner. Great Tusk, in turn, provides Rapid Spin support to keep the field clear from entry hazards, which Heatran tends to get worn down by. Zapdos can defensively check Fighting-types that outspeed Heatran, such as Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Sneasler, and offensive Great Tusk, as well as Hisuian Samurott, which tends to use Heatran as an opportunity to fire off Ceaseless Edge. Enamorus is also able to check Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott, though it struggles to safely switch into them consistently due to its lesser bulk. Dragapult can threaten the Dragon-types that don't take much damage from Heatran's attacks, such as Dragonite, Walking Wake, and Garchomp. Furthermore, its Water resistance and Fighting immunity let it answer Volcanion and Zamazenta aiming to KO Heatran. Lastly, Rillaboom's ability to summon Grassy Terrain via Grassy Surge provides Heatran with extra passive recovery, boosts the power of its Tera Blast Grass, and weakens the damage it takes from Earthquake, letting Heatran survive physically defensive Great Tusk's Earthquake from full health.</p>"

Magma Storm is a strong STAB move that lets it potentially trap the likes of Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, and which even Fire-resistant foes such as Garchomp and Rotom-W can struggle against due to its passive damage. Taunt allows Heatran to block status moves such as Toxapex's Recover and Galarian Slowking's Chilly Reception. Alternatively, Protect can be used to gain extra Leftovers recovery, deal further damage with Magma Storm, and scout Choice item users such as Dragapult, Enamorus, and Zamazenta. Earth Power provides a way for Heatran to dent Fire-types such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and opposing Heatran, and it lets Heatran continuously chip Toxapex and Galarian Slowking to more easily remove them after having trapped them. Stealth Rock is used to take advantage of its good matchup against hazard control options such as Hatterene, Corviknight, and bulky Cinderace. Tera Blast Grass is an alternative that lets Heatran threaten the likes of Rotom-W and Hisuian Samurott. Lastly, Will-O-Wisp is another option that allows Heatran to punish Dragonite, Garchomp, and Roaring Moon trying to switch in, as well as Kingambit aiming to revenge kill Heatran with Sucker Punch. The set opts for near maximum Special Defense investment with enough Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Azumarill. The 4 Defense EVs in conjunction with maximum HP allows Heatran to always survive an Earthquake from Clodsire from full health. Tera Grass's benefits go beyond the Tera Blast coverage, as it also gives Heatran a resistance to Water- and Ground-type attacks, which expands its range of Pokemon it can trap to include Dondozo, Clodsire, and Garganacl. Tera Grass also synergizes beautifully with Flash Fire, as it removes the potential weakness to Fire-type attacks. Tera Flying is another option that gets rid of Heatran's weakness to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, notably improving its matchup against Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Dragapult appreciates Heatran's ability to switch into Choice Scarf Gholdengo's Shadow Ball, Choice Scarf Enamorus's Moonblast, and opposing Dragapult's STAB moves. Great Tusk is another Pokemon that appreciates Heatran's support against said special attackers, as well as against Zapdos, Amoonguss, and Hatterene, and in turn it is able to keep Heatran healthy by removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Heatran and Toxapex make for a solid defensive core thanks to the former's ability to take on Hatterene, Zapdos, and Gholdengo that annoy Toxapex, and the latter's resistance to Fighting- and Water-type moves that aim to target Heatran such as Close Combat from Iron Valiant, Sneasler, and Zamazenta, Walking Wake's Hydro Steam, and Greninja's Hydro Pump.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Specially defensive Heatran is an invaluable part of any Steel team. It is a fantastic check to many metagame staples that Steel would greatly struggle to otherwise deal with, such as Volcarona, Corviknight, Skeledirge, Zapdos, and Iron Moth. It serves Steel teams consistently well even outside of these problem matchups due to its great natural bulk, plethora of useful resistances including a crucial immunity to Fire via Flash Fire, and utility for its team through its access to Stealth Rock and capacity to spread burns.</p> <p>Lava Plume is Heatran’s primary attacking move, which not only hits neutral targets hard due to Heatran’s naturally good Special Attack but also has a 30% chance to burn foes. Fire’s nature as an attacking type that has no natural immunities means Heatran can use Lava Plume many times throughout the course of a game to generate progress with minimal risk. The burn chance of Lava Plume makes Heatran incredibly risky for foes to switch into, as physical attackers such as Great Tusk that could threaten a KO on Heatran do not want to risk the possibility of being burned and having their offensive power crippled. Furthermore, walls such as Toxapex also fear being burned, as the passive damage will affect their longevity over the course of a game. Earth Power is the only coverage necessary for Heatran, giving it the capability to easily break through foes such as Skeledirge and Iron Moth. It is notable that an EV spread including 56 Special Attack EVs will allow Heatran to OHKO offensive opposing Heatran with Earth Power. Heatran serves as an excellent setter of Stealth Rock due to its propensity to easily force switches against Pokemon such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Amoonguss. Protect rounds out Heatran’s moveset, not only giving it the chance to extend its longevity via Leftovers and accumulate burn damage on foes but also the capability to scout foes’ movesets, which can be especially useful when facing off against foes using Choice items. One should be careful when using Protect not to fall into predictable patterns and give foes the chance to set up on Heatran, however. Magma Storm can be used instead of Lava Plume to trap and eliminate foes such as Toxapex and force damage against bulky threats such as Iron Hands; the passive damage synergizes well with Protect, but Magma Storm's low PP and accuracy makes it less consistent throughout longer games. Taunt is an option that can be used place of Stealth Rock that synergizes particularly well with Magma Storm, preventing foes from using recovery moves, getting entry hazards up, or setting up on Heatran. However, a lack of Speed investment means it will have somewhat limited utility. As another option to Stealth Rock, Power Gem easily OHKOes Moltres, which walls Heatran otherwise, and prevents bulky Volcarona sets from outlasting Heatran. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp can be used over Stealth Rock in conjunction with an investment of 40 Speed EVs to allow Heatran to outspeed and burn maximum Speed Adamant Kingambit. If desired, it is also possible to run one of the aforementioned alternative options of Taunt, Power Gem, or Will-O-Wisp instead of Protect, but this comes at the cost of significantly impacting Heatran's longevity and foregoing Protect's scouting utility.</p> <p>Heatran serves as one of the three pillars of Steel’s “immunity trinity” along with Corviknight and Gholdengo; combined, these three offer immunities to Steel’s core weaknesses of Fire, Ground, and Fighting, forming an excellent defensive backbone for any Steel team. Corviknight is Heatran’s most important partner, being able to nullify Ground moves targeted at Heatran while Heatran in turn blocks Fire moves aimed at Corviknight. Furthermore, Corviknight can also threaten prominent Fighting-types in the metagame such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler with its STAB Brave Bird. With a physically defensive pivot set, Corviknight further synergizes with specially defensive Heatran by being able to soak up physical hits while Heatran takes special ones, having the ability to remove opposing Stealth Rock and Spikes to prevent Heatran from being worn down by entry hazards over the course of a game and providing Heatran with opportunities to switch in safely via U-turn. Bulk Up Corviknight appreciates Heatran too, as Stealth Rock and burn support can increase its sweeping potential. Gholdengo completes the immunity trinity by voiding Fighting moves aimed at Heatran. Gholdengo can further support Heatran by blocking Corrosion Toxic from Glimmora thanks to Good as Gold; this ability combined with Gholdengo's Ghost typing also lets it completely prevent the removal of Heatran's Stealth Rock, as Gholdengo blocks both Rapid Spin and Defog. With an Air Balloon, Gholdengo can block Ground-type moves and use Nasty Plot to break through walls, both of which Heatran appreciates. Alternatively, using a Choice Scarf, Gholdengo can switch into Enamorus and outspeed and OHKO it in return, and it can use Trick to cripple opposing special walls such as Toxapex and Blissey or lock sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite into setup moves to prevent them from exploiting Heatran. Outside of the immunity trinity, Hisuian Goodra also makes a good pairing with Heatran due to its unique Water resistance on Steel and capacity to threaten opposing Water-types such as Basculegion-F and Greninja with Thunderbolt. Hisuian Goodra can also check Hydreigon and Walking Wake, which both wall and exploit Heatran. Moreover, Hisuian Goodra can act as a switch-in to opposing Heatran and threaten it with Earthquake, and it is able to survive an Earth Power from Landorus and OHKO it in return with Ice Beam if necessary. Iron Treads can spin away hazards for Heatran without removing Heatran’s Stealth Rock, set Stealth Rock itself to free Heatran to use other moves if desired, and serve as an offensive check to Sandy Shocks with its STAB Earthquake as well as Landorus with Ice Spinner, which Heatran’s other teammates can struggle to handle. Physical sweepers such as Kingambit and Scizor are grateful for Heatran’s ability to absorb Will-O-Wisp for them, and they can clean up teams Heatran has worn down with Stealth Rock and chip damage. Klefki can complement Heatran's Stealth Rock with its own Spikes while taking advantage of Heatran's Fire immunity, which can help break down opposing teams faster as they switch around to deal with the immunity trinity. It should be noted that this is by no means an exhaustive list of potential teammates for Heatran; all Steel-type Pokemon in the metagame appreciate Heatran’s Fire immunity, and no Pokemon currently competes with Heatran in this regard.</p>"

Magma Storm allows Heatran to trap and KO passive foes such as Toxapex, Blissey, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, although it must Terastallize to take care of the latter two. Taunt allows it to effectively shut down trapped foes, denying recovery and preventing Toxic after Terastallizing, thus making its trapping capabilities more pronounced. Earth Power allows Heatran to hit Garganacl, Toxapex, and opposing Heatran, and it is a generally safe and accurate option against most trapped foes. Stealth Rock allows Heatran to lay entry hazards, especially in front of a trapped foe or after forcing out a foe, while Toxic is useful for wearing down switch-ins to Heatran such as Mega Gyarados. Tera Grass allows Heatran to shed its weaknesses and gain a unique defensive profile, walling most Pokemon that rely on Ground-type moves to hit it including Mega Charizard Y, Gliscor, and Clodsire. However, Heatran must still be wary when using its Tera, as it becomes more vulnerable to foes like Zapdos and Mega Scizor. Even without Special Attack investment, Heatran still poses a threat to opposing Fire-resistant foes such as Rotom-W and Garchomp, as they cannot switch in too many times without getting worn down. Allies like Volcarona appreciate Heatran pressuring foes like Toxapex and opposing Heatran for them. Heatran's ability to check Tapu Lele is also very useful for allies like Urshifu-R and Iron Valiant, as Tapu Lele is a commonly seen Choice item user, and Heatran's scouting allows teammates to safely double switch in once Heatran forces out Tapu Lele. Defensively, Heatran appreciates allies that can take Ground-type moves for it, reducing its need to Terastallize and thus saving it for a more deserving ally. Partners like Rotom-W, Mega Latias, and Gliscor are all immune to Ground-type moves from the likes of Garchomp and Landorus-T, and the former two can also switch into Water-type moves from foes like Urshifu-R while the latter two switch into Fighting-type moves from foes like Mega Lopunny. In exchange, Heatran covers Grass- and Ice-type moves for them. Heatran also has little means to heal off chip damage due to its lack of instant recovery. Thus, entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T make for good allies. Finally, Alomomola's Wish support is particularly valuable, as it can instantly heal Heatran while remaining healthy itself, and they also cover each other's weaknesses decently well, with Heatran taking Grass-type moves from Mega Charizard Y while Alomomola takes Water-type moves from Hisuian Samurott.</p>"

Heatran's natural bulk also means it can still reliably switch into resisted hits with ease despite not having defensive investment. Magma Storm + Taunt in conjunction with Earth Power allows Heatran to trap and remove foes effectively due to its spike in damage output from its Special Attack investment. Toxic is useful, as it allows Heatran to spread poison on switch-ins like Landorus-T and Alomomola that have pivoting moves to escape Magma Storm, hindering their effectiveness and putting a timer on their HP. Hidden Power Ice is an option to lure Gliscor and Garchomp and remove them for allies, as well as improving Heatran’s matchup against opposing Tera Grass Heatran. Solar Beam in conjunction with Grassium Z allows Heatran to lure and nuke Alomomola, Mega Tyranitar, and Garganacl, OHKOing the former and heavily denting the latter two. Leftovers is useful for recovery, as Heatran has no means of instant recovery; Air Balloon allows it to check opposing Heatran along with foes like Gliscor and Garchomp, threatening massive chip damage or Toxic on them. Tera Grass is useful to check Ground-type move users and also to function as a pest to rain teams in general. Offensive Heatran appreciates pivots like Rotom-W and Landorus-T that can safely bring it in while baiting in Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Corviknight. It also appreciates allies that can switch into Ground- and Fighting-type moves for it, like Tornadus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos, as they also share checks with Heatran, namely opposing Heatran, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, and appreciate Heatran chipping or outright removing these checks for them while being useful defensively as well.</p>"

While Heatran boasts an innately good defensive typing, Tera Grass allows it to turn its common weaknesses to Ground and Water into resistances, letting it match up better against the likes of Landorus-T and Palafin-H. Heat Wave is a spread STAB attack that chips away at foes, notably 2HKOing Amoonguss. Flash Cannon is Heatran's best way of hitting Fairy-types, as it OHKOes Diancie and 2HKOes Flutter Mane. Heavy Slam OHKOes Flutter Mane but is generally less reliable because it can be weakened by Intimidate and does less damage to Diancie and opposing Tera Grass Heatran mirror. Tera Blast hits Water- and Ground-types super effectively once Heatran has Terastallized, notably OHKOing Great Tusk and 2HKOing Bulk Up Palafin-H. Earth Power hits the Fire-types such as Volcanion, Chi-Yu, and opposing Heatran that otherwise resists all of Heatran's attacks. Heatran's base resistances let it take common Fairy-, Ice-, and Steel-type attacks such as Flutter Mane's Moonblast, Chien-Pao's Ice Spinner, and Gholdengo's Make It Rain much better. After Terastallization, Heatran matches up better against Palafin-H, Volcanion, and Iron Hands at the cost of receiving more damage from the aforementioned attacks. Heatran has a lot of defensive responsibilities on most teams, so Terastallization should not be used too frivolously. Heatran commonly finds itself in Fire / Water / Grass cores with Rillaboom and Palafin, as they complement each other offensively and defensively, with Rillaboom eradicating Water-types and Palafin punching through Fire-types. Iron Hands is a common Heatran partner that can pressure Palafin and Volcanion with Wild Charge and Chi-Yu and Tera Dark Kingambit with Drain Punch. Heatran has no form of recovery, so it appreciates teammates that can extend its longevity, such as Cresselia with Lunar Blessing and Amoonguss with Pollen Puff.</p>"

          "description": "<ul> <li>Giratina-O is a very potent offensive presence in Ubers thanks to its powerful attacks, superb bulk, and passable Speed stat that lets it outspeed common defensive pieces like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and most Landorus-T and Gliscor variants. Levitate grants it an invaluable immunity to the ever-present Spikes, allowing it to work as a wallbreaker that demands other kind of counterplay, like the less common Stealth Rock.</li> <li>However, Giratina-O gets outsped by the entirety of the offensive metagame. While strong, Giratina-O doesn't achieve any notable OHKOs, thus many common Pokemon like Landorus-T, Zacian-C, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Koraidon can pivot around it with relative ease. Giratina-O might also be forced to Terastallize to perform its role as a utility Pokemon due to the relevance of Toxic Pokemon like Clodsire and Gliscor, as well as the existence of faster threats like Zacian-C, Koraidon, Miraidon, and Flutter Mane. Terastallizing is a huge commitment, and Giratina-O more often than not is doing it to be able to perform consistently. Lastly, Giratina-O has a big longevity issue, which can make it struggle in checking the Pokemon it's supposed to, making it fit only on certain styles of teams that can make up for its non-existent recovery with teammates like Wish Alomomola.</li> <li>Thunder Wave can help Giratina-O spread paralysis for itself and its teammates, giving it a form of speed control. With the given EV spread, Giratina-O can take a hit from Zacian-C and potentially paralyze it, which is game-changing. However, it's not a common occurrence, as Giratina-O must be at full HP to accomplish this. Thunder Wave is also unable to paralyze common switch-ins to Giratina-O like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T. As a result, another option to run is Will-O-Wisp, which completely ruins Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Clodsire, while also annoying other switch-ins, namely Arceus formes like Fairy.</li> <li>Shadow Sneak gives Giratina-O a tool to revenge kill Flutter Mane, Tera Ghost Pokemon like Koraidon, and low HP targets like Zacian-C. If this is not needed, however, Giratina-O can effectively run Defog thanks to its positive matchup against common entry hazard setters.</li> <li>The given EV spread permits Giratina-O to live one Play Rough from +1 Zacian-C from full HP. It also gives Giratina-O very favorable chances to avoid the 2HKO from Ice Beam from non-Choice Specs Kyogre. The Speed allows Giratina-O to outspeed uninvested Gliscor, and the remaining EVs are slotted into Attack so that Giratina-O always 2HKOes Zacian-C with Poltergeist.</li> <li>Tera Steel allows Giratina-O to check Pokemon like Koraidon, Miraidon, Zacian-C, and Flutter Mane. It also lets Giratina-O annoy Arceus-Fairy one-on-one and beat Calm Mind Arceus-Ground while making it immune to Toxic from the likes of Gliscor and Clodsire. Tera Poison can be used instead, as it still gives Giratina-O a Fairy-type resistance and poison immunity, but it also gives a new resistance to Fighting that can let it take on Koraidon. This, however, leaves Giratina-O unable to check Zacian-C and resist Dragon-type attacks.</li> <li>Giratina-O fits best on bulky offense teams that need a way to deal with Ground-type Pokemon like Arceus-Ground and Groudon and can't afford to run passive checks to them like Corviknight. Once on the field, Giratina-O can make use of its powerful STAB moves to hit everything in the tier at least for neutral damage; however, be aware that Poltergeist has only 8 PP, meaning that while it's Giratina-O's main way of dealing damage, it should not be used recklessly, as it can get PP stalled with smart pivoting, especially by teams that have Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Extreme Killer Arceus.</li> <li>Giratina-O is forced out by common Pokemon like Zacian-C, Koraidon, and Miraidon. It can also be overwhelmed by very strong Ice-type attacks from the likes of Calyrex-I and Choice Specs Kyogre. Pokemon like Kyogre can help Giratina-O against Calyrex-I and Koraidon, while the likes of Clodsire can help against Miraidon. Other Pokemon like Skeledirge and Arceus-Fairy can help Giratina-O against Zacian-C and Koraidon, respectively. Lastly, Pokemon that can help against Ting-Lu, like Arceus-Fairy and Gliscor, are also good teammates, as Ting-Lu's Ruination threatens to put a severe dent in Giratina-O's HP, and Ting-Lu can freely use Spikes against Giratina-O.</li> </ul>"

Giratina-O's Ground immunity gives it excellent opportunities to switch in on the ever-present Spikes, which allows it to act as somewhat of a wallbreaker that also happens to give Defog support, as most defensive teams will only have said Spikes as way of dealing with wallbreakers, which Giratina-O is immune to.</li> <li>However, Giratina-O's strongest attack is Draco Meteor; this makes Giratina-O prone to be taken advantage by setup sweepers like Tera Fairy Miraidon, Zacian-C, Kyogre, and Flutter Mane. Hex is also a very weak move if the foe is not statused, meaning that Giratina-O will not be attacking for the majority of the early- to mid-game and instead, it'll be spreading status conditions and using Defog. Lastly, Giratina-O's poor Speed leaves it outsped by the likes of Koraidon and Arceus formes.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp spreads status to empower Hex and annoy Pokemon like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and most Arceus formes that will regularly be switching into Giratina-O.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Giratina-O to avoid being 2HKOed by any of Kyogre's attacks without Stealth Rock while outspeeding 0 Speed Gliscor. The remaining EVs maximize Special Attack for Giratina-O to hit as hard as possible.</li> <li>Tera Steel allows Giratina-O to check Pokemon like Flutter Mane. It also lets Giratina-O annoy Calm Mind Arceus formes while making it immune to Toxic from the likes of Gliscor and Clodsire. Tera Fairy can be used instead for Giratina-O to become immune to the Dragon-type attacks that will be aimed at it from Koraidon, Miraidon, and opposing Giratina-O.</li> <li>Giratina-O fits best on bulky offense teams that need a way to battle Ground-type Pokemon like Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground and Groudon, and also need a hazard removal Pokemon. If using Defog is not needed, Giratina-O can instead spread status with Will-O-Wisp and launch Draco Meteors to dent Pokemon like Ting-Lu.</li> <li>Giratina-O wants to be paired with physical attackers like Koraidon, Zacian-C, Arceus-Ground, and Calyrex-I that can deal with the walls that annoy it. In return, Giratina-O can deal with the physically bulky Pokemon, like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Landorus-T, that annoy them. Clodsire and Ting-Lu are good teammates as well, as they take on Pokemon that Giratina-O can't, like Miraidon and Choice Specs Kyogre in Clodsire's case.</li> </ul>"

Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave both debilitate physical attackers, but Will-O-Wisp chips away at walls and affects Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, while Thunder Wave additionally impairs special attackers such as Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy. Poltergeist breaks Arceus-Ground's Substitute, which would otherwise block Will-O-Wisp and Dragon Tail, in one hit; alternatively, running Hex lets Giratina-O hit statused walls harder and makes burn affect it much less. Dragon Tail quickly racks up entry hazard damage on the opposing team and prevents foes from continuously setting up against Giratina-O, which is especially useful against Taunt users. The given EV spread lets Giratina take unboosted Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and outspeed Taunt Landorus-T. Tera Steel makes Giratina-O immune to poison from foes such as Toxapex and gives it a resistance to moves like Arceus-Fairy's Judgment, Zacian-C's Play Rough and Behemoth Blade, Koraidon's Scale Shot, and Arceus-Ground's Dragon Claw and Ice Beam. Tera Poison similarly removes Giratina-O's Dragon weakness and provides it with an immunity to Toxic and a resistance to Fairy, but it doesn't make Giratina-O weak to Koraidon's Low Kick. Defensive Giratina-O fits best on balance teams that otherwise have trouble dealing with Ground-types such as Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground or need the increased longevity Defog provides. Toxapex and Skeledirge handle Pokemon like Zacian-C and Koraidon for Giratina-O; in return, it handles Ground-types and helps check Arceus. Giratina-O appreciates Ting-Lu and Arceus checking Calyrex-S for it; Ting-Lu also checks Miraidon and helps check Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Calyrex-S likes Giratina-O being able to deal with its two main switch-ins, Arceus and Ting-Lu, by checking the former and removing the latter's Spikes. Because it lacks recovery, Giratina-O can get overwhelmed by the Pokemon it checks when facing hyper offense teams, so it appreciates revenge killers such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Choice Scarf Koraidon.</p>"

Dragon Tail is the preferred Dragon-type STAB move due to the utility it gives for checking threats like Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground and Extreme Killer Arceus, as well as racking up extra damage with the Spikes that Giratina-O loves. Will-O-Wisp cripples Ting-Lu—preventing it from accruing HP with Leftovers—and scares away offensive Pokemon like Arceus, Koraidon, and Zacian-C. Alternatively, Outrage provides greater brute force to muscle through Ting-Lu and Arceus, and Thunder Wave can cripple would-be checks like Arceus-Fairy. Tera Steel resists many common attacks aimed at Giratina-O: Ice Beam from Kyogre and Arceus-Ground, Dragon-type moves from Koraidon and Miraidon, Play Rough from Zacian-C, and Judgment from Arceus-Fairy. The given EV spread always lives Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and +2 Life Orb Arceus's Shadow Claw; 12 Speed EVs outspeeds uninvested Landorus-T to use Will-O-Wisp before Taunt. Giratina-O fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate it deterring Choice Scarf Koraidon's Low Kick and Flare Blitz and checking Arceus, Arceus-Ground, and Kyogre while still being a powerful attacker. Ting-Lu is a major nuisance for Giratina-O, as it is able to come in quite safely and set Spikes, though it must fear Dragon Tail with multiple layers of Spikes, so teammates that can threaten it like Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, and Koraidon are good partners. Entry hazard support from Landorus-T and your own Ting-Lu is greatly appreciated, chipping checks like Ting-Lu and defensive Arceus formesand weakening offensive threats like Koraidon and Arceus-Ground into Shadow Sneak's KO range. Ting-Lu and Landorus-T also support Giratina-O defensively; the former checks Miraidon, Eternatus, and Terastallized Calyrex-S; the latter checks Zacian-C and helps against Arceus and Arceus-Ground. Arceus is a good offensive partner that can overwhelm shared checks with Giratina-O like defensive Arceus formes while taking advantage of Calyrex-S that are forced to Terastallize from the threat of a Shadow Sneak OHKO. Koraidon is another good partner that helps pressure Ting-Lu, check Kyogre, and overwhelm their shared checks. Zacian-C checks Arceus-Fairy and helps handle Arceus while not letting up on offensive pressure.</p>"

After several Calm Mind boosts, Stored Power allows Cresselia to muscle past both Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo and bulky Psychic-resistant foes like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Heatran while making it nigh impossible to KO with special attackers. Moonblast rounds out Cresselia's coverage, allowing it to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Greninja super effectively while being able to at least damage Kingambit; Tera Blast Fighting greatly improves Cresselia's matchup against Kingambit and hits these Dark-types harder than Moonblast, but makes Cresselia more reliant on Terastallization. Leftovers grants Cresselia crucial passive healing, allowing it to conserve its limited Moonlight PP long-term; Covert Cloak, on the other hand, blocks secondary effects from an array of moves, including Heatran's Magma Storm, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Zapdos's Discharge, and Sneasler's Dire Claw, allowing Cresselia to set up against these threats more safely. Grassy Seed is an option if Cresselia is used on Grassy Terrain hyper offense teams, which gives it more opprotunities to set up in the face of physical attackers while also boosting its Stored Power. Tera Poison has wonderful synergy with Levitate, giving Cresselia a single weakness to Psychic-type attacks, granting it resistances to Poison- and Fairy-type attacks, and an immunity to Toxapex's Toxic while still maintaining its Fighting resistance. Defensively, Tera Fighting lets Cresselia flip its Dark weakness against prominent Pokemon like Meowscarada, Greninja, Hisuian Samurott, and the aforementioned Kingambit as well. 52 Speed EVs allow Cresselia to outspeed Kingambit.</p> <p>Cresselia fits well on an array of hyper offense, offense, and balance teams capable of supporting such a potent wincon. Heatran, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T can provide entry hazard support to wear down foes over time. Heatran can also use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Kingambit or trap and wear down threats like Haze Toxapex and Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking with Magma Storm and Taunt; in return, Cresselia can handle threats like Great Tusk and Zamazenta that Heatran struggles against. Kingambit is ubiquitous and is a major thorn in Cresselia's side; as such, Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Low Kick Kingambit are crucial partners that can help stop opposing Kingambit's attempt to countersweep. Assault Vest Toxapex is a great teammate for Cresselia; it can take on Encore Iron Valiant, which is a frustrating matchup for Cresselia, and it can trap and deal with opposing defensive Toxapex, which can shut down Cresselia's boosts with Haze and force Cresselia to Tera Poison in order to avoid being crippled by Toxic. Thanks to Grassy Surge, Rillaboom is a necessary partner for Grassy Seed variants; it can support Cresselia with utility options like Knock Off and U-turn too.</p>"

Even without Terastallization, it can use its natural typing to withstand attacks from dangerous Pokemon such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Mega Medicham. Hidden Power Fighting is the preferred coverage move to hit Mega Tyranitar and Heatran much harder, while Moonblast provides a stronger hit against the likes of Dragapult and Urshifu-R if Cresselia cannot afford to accumulate multiple Calm Mind boosts. Tera Poison is essential for removing Cresselia's weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Hisuian Samurott while providing less exploitable weaknesses compared to Tera Steel, which makes Cresselia prone to being revenge killed by Fighting- and Fire-types such as Mega Lopunny, Sneasler, Heatran, and Mega Charizard Y. Covert Cloak allows Cresselia to negate secondary effects from Garganacl's Salt Cure and status from the likes of Toxapex, Sneasler, and Zapdos, while Leftovers provides passive recovery that makes Cresselia less exploitable and forced to heal. Maximum Speed EVs allow Cresselia to consistently outspeed Heatran and Gholdengo, which could otherwise irritate it, although more Defense investment could be used instead to better withstand attacks from the likes of Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Cresselia fits best on either bulky balance or hyper offense teams, both able to provide support in different ways; the former give Cresselia a defensive core to fall back on should its sweep fail, while the latter pressure opposing defensive teams and can provide dual screens support via Tapu Koko and Dragapult to bolster its bulk even further. Both playstyles can reliably keep up Spikes using Skarmory, Clodsire, Mega Diancie, or Garchomp, which Cresselia mandates in order to wear down its checks such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Similarly, Knock Off support from the likes of Toxapex and Iron Valiant helps Cresselia pressure the aforementioned checks more effectively. Cresselia has difficulty withstanding rain teams due to them cutting Moonlight's healing, so defensive partners that match up positively against them such as Toxapex and Tera Water or Dragon Garganacl are appreciated. Cresselia struggles with bulkier playstyles that can neutralize it with the likes of Haze Toxapex and Unaware Tera Dark Clodsire, so Pokemon that can break defensive teams such as Swords Dance Gliscor and Gholdengo make for good partners.</p>"

Swords Dance can be used to break past Pokemon like Landorus-T, Giratina-O, Toxapex, and defensive Arceus formes and limit revenge killers like Koraidon, while Dragon Dance is a more niche option that lets Arceus outspeed Calyrex-S, Zacian-C, and opposing Arceus formes. Shadow Claw hits Ghost-types like Giratina-O, Skeledirge, and Calyrex-S and provides good neutral coverage. Recover can provide Arceus with more opportunities to set up and makes it harder to revenge kill; alternatively, Earthquake hits Skeledirge harder, as well as hitting Toxapex and Zacian-C, and Taunt can deny opposing recovery, status-inducing moves, and Haze from Pokemon like Arceus formes, Skeledirge, and Toxapex, respectively. Silk Scarf has no drawbacks, but unlike Life Orb, it means +2 Extreme Speed needs a layer of Spikes to 2HKO defensive Arceus formes, OHKO Miriadon, and 2HKO Zacian-C. Additionally, Life Orb lets +2 Extreme Speed OHKO Koraidon after a layer of Spikes, +1 Earthquake OHKO Zacian-C, and unboosted Earthquake 2HKO Skeledirge and Toxapex. Tera Normal OHKOes Koraidon with +2 Extreme Speed and enables Silk Scarf Arceus to achieve the damage thresholds Life Orb sets can. Tera Ghost makes Arceus harder to revenge kill by opposing Arceus and Koraidon and lets Life Orb-boosted Shadow Claw OHKO defensive Giratina-O after Stealth Rock at +2, OHKO Zacian-C after some chip damage at +2, and 2HKO Skeledirge. Tera Fire makes Arceus immune to Will-O-Wisp, helping against Skeledirge and opposing Arceus formes, and lets it resist Zacian-C's STAB moves, Arceus-Fairy's Judgment, and Calyrex-S's Grass Knot. Arceus fits well on offense and bulky offense teams, being able to revenge kill dangerous threats and clean up late-game. Thanks to Arceus's Normal typing, it's immune to Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, which can help against Choice Specs sets, Koraidon and Zacian-C pair well with Arceus, as they help overwhelm shared checks with Arceus like Landorus-T, Toxapex, and defensive Arceus formes. Pokemon such as Calyrex-S, Miraidon, and Kyogre also threaten its checks and make good teammates. On bulky offense teams, Landorus-T and Ting-Lu make good partners, as Landorus-T can switch into Pokemon that can revenge kill Arceus like Zacian-C and Koraidon, chipping them with Rocky Helmet in the process, and Ting-Lu crucially sets Spikes and helps check Calyrex-S, which offensive Arceus does poorly. On hyper offense teams, Pokemon like Grimmsnarl, Glimmora, and Ribombee support Arceus, and Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Ground can take advantage of Koraidon and Zacian-C for it.</p>"

Swords Dance is the preferred setup move to break through checks like Giratina-O and Landorus-T and limit revenge killers like Koraidon and Zacian-C, while Bulk Up is an alternative on hyper offense with dual screens support from Pokemon like Grimmsnarl, making Arceus a brutal sweeper that stifles common forms of counterplay like Koraidon, Zacian-C, and opposing Extreme Killer Arceus. Shadow Claw OHKOes Calyrex-S, hits Giratina-O, and provides good neutral coverage. The longevity Heavy-Duty Boots provides lets Arceus more reliably check Calyrex-S and more safely set up. Leftovers is an alternative to Heavy-Duty Boots, making Arceus harder to stop once set up. Tera Ghost turns the tables on Koraidon, lets Arceus consistently beat opposing Extreme Killer Arceus, and greatly improves Shadow Claw's damage against Giratina-O and Skeledirge, while Tera Normal boosts Arceus's power to ridiculous levels; at +2, Extreme Speed OHKOes Koraidon after Stealth Rock and 2HKOes Zacian-C. Tera Fire and Steel are more defensive options, blocking status and improving the matchup against threats like Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, and Calyrex-S as well as opposing Extreme Killer Arceus in the case of Steel. 236 HP EVs always survive a hit from Choice Specs Miraidon. Alternatively, a spread with 124 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Def / 124 Spe and an Adamant nature outspeeds Timid Kyogre and always avoids a 2HKO from Life Orb Calyrex-S's Psyshock. Arceus can struggle to break through Giratina-O, Skeledirge, Toxapex, and defensive Arceus formes, so teammates that can take advantage of them, like Calyrex-S and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, or weaken them, like Koraidon and Zacian-C, make for good partners. Choice Scarf Koraidon can also revenge kill Pokemon Arceus cannot like Zacian-C and Calyrex-S. Encore Calyrex-S can switch into any of Arceus's moves besides Shadow Claw and use Encore, so Ting-Lu is a great partner to help check it. Koraidon and Zacian-C highly threaten Arceus, so strong counterplay to them, like Landorus-T on offense or Toxapex or Skeledirge on balance, is crucial.</p>"

Taunt shuts down Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Toxapex from setting up entry hazards, namely that of Spikes and Toxic Spikes, prevents setup sweepers from setting up, and blocks recovery, which Judgment variants appreciate.

Taunt also allows Arceus-Fairy to deny entry hazards from Pokemon like Clodsire that, by virtue of their typing and bulk, would have no problems setting them up against it.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy can also run options like Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave over Stealth Rock, giving it a way to punish Pokemon like Zacian-C and Clodsire even harder as they switch into it.</li> <li>The given spread allows Arceus-Fairy to outspeed threatening Pokemon like Arceus and Palkia-O without a Speed-boosting nature.

What differentiates Arceus-Fairy from other Calm Mind Arceus formes is its Dragon immunity, which grants it an invaluable defensive niche against some of the metagame's top threats, like Koraidon, and its Judgment being at least a neutral hit on the vast majority of the metagame, as Pokemon that resist Fairy are scarce.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza while maximizing bulk.

It also retains Arceus-Fairy's ability to check Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Koraidon in a pinch, which can be useful for pivoting. In conjunction with Will-O-Wisp, Tera Poison Arceus-Fairy can potentially take on Zacian-C one-on-one if it has enough Calm Mind boosts.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy should be spreading Will-O-Wisp before attempting to sweep, as Pokemon like Clodsire and Zacian-C can stop Arceus-Fairy on its tracks before it accomplishes anything. Arceus-Fairy can be overwhelmed fairly easily by strong powerhouses like Tera Fire Koraidon and Choice Specs Miraidon, so taking care of them first before attempting to sweep is advised.</li> <li>Skeledirge is the best counter to Arceus-Fairy, as it ignores Calm Mind boosts with Unaware, can break through it with Torch Song, and is naturally immune to Will-O-Wisp. Because of this, Pokemon like Eternatus, Kyogre, Miraidon, and Clodsire are good teammates, as they can comfortably sit on Skeledirge and force it out.</li> <li>Pokemon like Skeledirge can check Zacian-C and Koraidon for Arceus-Fairy and spread burns with Will-O-Wisp; the combination of Skeledirge + Arceus-Fairy checks Koraidon pretty well.

Earth Power hits foes like Zacian-C, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, as well as Tera Fire Pokemon such as Arceus and Koraidon. Tera Water gives Arceus-Fairy a resistance to attacks like Koraidon's Flare Blitz, Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade, and Choice Scarf Kyogre's Water Spout, making it harder to revenge kill and giving it more opportunities to set up. Tera Poison removes Arceus-Fairy's Steel weakness, provides it with an immunity to Toxic from foes like Toxapex and Eternatus, and lets it absorb bothersome Toxic Spikes. Tera Ground removes Arceus-Fairy's weakness to Behemoth Blade and lets +1 Earth Power OHKO Zacian-C and Toxapex. Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy fits on balance, bulky offense, and hyper offense teams that appreciate its ability to block Koraidon's Scale Shot and be a dangerous setup sweeper. Unlike bulkier Arceus-Fairy sets, Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy is unable to switch into Koraidon, and Pokemon like Zacian-C and Choice Specs Calyrex-S can revenge kill it, so on balance and bulky offense teams, it appreciates teammates such as Toxapex, Skeledirge, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu checking these foes. On hyper offense teams, teammates like Calyrex-S and Arceus can take advantage of Zacian-C and opposing Calyrex-S for Arceus-Fairy. Hyper offense teams can also run an entry hazard lead like Glimmora or Ribombee to weaken Pokemon for Arceus-Fairy with Spikes or let it outspeed foes such as Choice Specs Calyrex-S, Zacian-C, and Choice Scarf Koraidon via Sticky Web, respectively. On all team playstyles, Calyrex-S appreciates Arceus-Fairy taking advantage of Ting-Lu and Choice Scarf Koraidon.</p>"

        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>Arceus-Fairy's typing allows it to reliably check Koraidon and Giratina-O, and its fantastic bulk and access to Will-O-Wisp let it also check several other physical attackers, including Arceus and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground. Additionally, Arceus-Fairy threatens common defensive staples such as Ting-Lu, Arceus-Dark, and Landorus-T with Judgment. Defensive Arceus-Fairy is particularly difficult to switch into, as Will-O-Wisp can cripple Zacian-C, which would otherwise be able to switch in safely on Arceus-Fairy. Taunt prevents entry hazards from being set and stops Clodsire, Eternatus, and Toxapex from using Toxic; it also prevents recovery, giving Arceus-Fairy the upper hand against other Arceus formes and stopping its checks such as Clodsire and Eternatus from taking advantage of forcing it out. Alternatively, Calm Mind, which can be used against the many Pokemon Arceus-Fairy forces out, turns it into a dangerous setup sweeper and troubles special wallbreakers that could otherwise muscle through it, such as Kyogre, Miraidon, and Calyrex-S. 16 Speed EVs allow for Arceus-Fairy to outrun neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon, such as Kyogre and Giratina-O. Tera Poison complements Calm Mind well, as it allows Arceus-Fairy to set up on Poison-types such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Eternatus that otherwise check it. Tera Poison also maintains a useful resistance to Koraidon's Fighting-type moves and lets Arceus-Fairy remove Toxic Spikes, but the weaknesses it gives are often exploited by Calyrex-S and Arceus-Ground. Tera Water offers crucial resistances to Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade and Koraidon's Flare Blitz, as well as a resistance to Kyogre's STAB moves, but it creates weaknesses to Miraidon's Electric-type attacks and Kyogre's Thunder. Arceus-Fairy is an outstanding choice on balance and bulky offense teams, which benefit from its defensive utility and remarkable offensive capabilities. Calyrex-S highly appreciates support from Arceus-Fairy, as Arceus-Fairy beats several of its checks in Ting-Lu, Arceus, Wo-Chien, and Arceus-Dark, as well as beating Pokemon that can revenge kill it in Giratina-O and Choice Scarf Koraidon. In turn, Calyrex-S can break through Arceus-Fairy's Poison-type defensive checks. Powerful Ground-type Pokemon, such as Arceus-Ground and Groudon, make great teammates for Calm Mind variants of Arceus-Fairy, since they threaten many of Arceus-Fairy's biggest obstacles in Eternatus, Clodsire, and Toxapex. Landorus-T, defensive variants of Arceus-Ground, Skeledirge, and Groudon can switch in to one of Arceus-Fairy's biggest offensive threats in Zacian-C. Ting-Lu is a valuable defensive teammate for Arceus-Fairy, as it can check powerful special wallbreakers such as Miraidon, Calyrex-S, and Eternatus. Kyogre is an exceptional teammate for Calm Mind variants of Arceus-Fairy, as it helps to wear down the pair's mutual defensive checks in Eternatus, Clodsire, and Toxapex. Kyogre can also switch in easily on Skeledirge, which Arceus-Fairy would otherwise struggle against.</p>"

U-turn allows Arceus-Fire to safely bring in offensive teammates to exploit passive Lava Plume switch-ins, such as Dondozo and Giratina; alternatively, Knock Off allows Arceus-Fire to remove items like Covert Cloak and Heavy-Duty Boots, as well as an Imposter user's Eviolite. Arceus-Fire best fits on balance teams that appreciate a reliable check to V-create users and a bulky pivot.

Take Heart and Nasty Plot increase Arceus-Ghost's otherwise middling offensive presence, with the former removing crippling status effects like paralysis and poison, while the latter allows Arceus-Ghost to be more threatening after one boost. Knock Off helps remove key utility items from opposing walls, such as Covert Cloak from Arceus-Fairy and Mega Audino and Heavy-Duty Boots from Yveltal, allowing teammates to break through them easier, and it can also remove the rare Spooky Plate from opposing Imposter users. Mortal Spin is an option when running Take Heart, as Arceus-Ghost is effective at pressuring Steel-types like Mega Steelix and Celesteela seeking to spinblock. Thunder Cage hits Yveltal hard while providing chip damage on special walls like Ice Scales Arceus-Fairy. Sludge Wave provides coverage against Fairy-types like Arceus-Fairy and Mega Audino, preventing the latter from blocking Arceus-Ghost's Strength Sap with Magic Bounce.

Noxious Torque is an option to hit common checks to Arceus-Ghost like Mega Audino, Ice Scales Arceus-Fairy, and Ice Scales Ho-Oh hard. Jungle Healing removes crippling status conditions while also acting as a form of recovery to mitigate chip damage. Its lower healing compared to alternatives like Strength Sap is valuable for breaking through Imposter users, although, in a pinch, these can use No Retreat and attempt to stall Judgment. Arceus-Ghost highly appreciates Knock Off users like RegenVest Pokemon to help remove Imposter Chansey's Eviolite, weaken opposing RegenVest Pokemon, remove Covert Cloaks for Triple Arrows, and remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Yveltal and Ho-Oh; in return, Arceus-Ghost acts as a decent Knock Off and status absorber.

Strength Sap slows down most physical threats, provides an advantage against Imposter users, and offers some leeway against Ground-type coverage like Headlong Rush. Support against Ground-type attackers, like Ho-Oh and Fur Coat Yveltal, is highly recommended. Arceus-Poison also appreciates allied hazard removal, as Celesteela completely shuts Mortal Spin variants down, and Steel-types like Mega Steelix can spinblock if Arceus-Poison doesn't have many boosts. Arceus-Poison Imposter-proofs itself thanks to Earth Plate, although it usually takes a while to win the one-on-one; Jungle Healing Chansey can also deny opposing Imposter user's healing and shake off poison.</p>"

Ice Beam allows Arceus-Water to hit Miraidon and Koraidon for super effective damage, whereas Judgment is used to hit Ting-Lu, Skeledirge, and Arceus-Ground. Taunt is an alternative option that prevents Arceus formes such as Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy and Extreme Killer Arceus from setting up and Ting-Lu and Toxapex from setting up entry hazards. However, losing Judgment in exchange for Taunt can be problematic, as Ice Beam is relatively weak.

The boost to Victini's defenses eases setup and makes it more difficult for priority moves such as Shadow Sneak from Ceruledge and Sucker Punch from Bisharp to revenge kill it; in addition, it lets Victini survive attacks such as Earthquake from Excadrill, giving it the option to set up against them. At +1, Victini's Searing Shot OHKOes most Steel-types such as Excadrill. Stored Power pairs nicely with Z-Celebrate, reaching 120 BP after the latter move is used, enabling Victini to deal massive damage to Fire-resistant foes such as Mega Aerodactyl and Tapu Fini, OHKOing the former after Stealth Rock. Stored Power's Base Power rise after setting up also enables Victini to 2HKO Unaware users such as Quagsire and physically defensive Skeledirge. Focus Blast pairs well with Victini's STAB moves, hitting top threats such as Mega Tyranitar, and its poor accuracy is mitigated somewhat by Victory Star. Alternatively, Energy Ball lets Victini destroy specially defensive Gastrodon, which otherwise takes little from even a boosted Stored Power. Z-Celebrate Victini fits best on hyper offense teams as a late-game cleaner. Entry hazard support from Mew and Excadrill can help wear down foes such as Tapu Fini and Slowbro into range of Victini's attacks. Excadrill also offers Rapid Spin to remove hazards for Victini. Good offensive partners for Victini include Swords Dance Scizor and Autotomize Celesteela.

Victini is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards and therefore appreciates entry hazard removal from Excadrill, Hydreigon, or Tapu Fini. Excadrill and Mega Tyranitar can also set Stealth Rock to weaken Victini's checks such as Slowbro into range of its attacks. Victini also greatly enjoys U-turn or Teleport support to let it hit the field to launch its powerful V-create. Scizor and Slowbro are all good Pokemon that fulfill this role. Scizor can even trap some of Victini's checks, such as Mega Latias, with Pursuit. Since Victini can struggle to reliably pressure some of its aforementioned checks, like Slowbro thanks to Regenerator, a partner that can take advantage of them, such as Nasty Plot Hydreigon, is also appreciated. Finally, a good late-game cleaner such as Autotomize Celesteela can finish off a team weakened by Victini. On sun teams, Venusaur is a good option for a cleaner that pairs well with Victini and enjoys its ability to punish Pokemon used to check it, such as Blissey.</p>"

Trick is used to cripple tanks like Garganacl and Slowbro, reducing their longevity while receiving Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers in return. V-create's explosive power needs little Attack investment to perform effectively, still easily 2HKOing most neutral targets including defensive Volcarona and Tornadus-T. Thus, 248 HP EVs are instead used to maximize the potential of Final Gambit while minimizing damage from Stealth Rock. Tera Fire is used to fuel V-create, notably OHKOing Tornadus-T, and remove Victini’s weakness to Pursuit, but this comes at the cost of a comparably worse defensive typing against foes like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta. Victini's ability to threaten any foe allows it to very easily pivot into wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R, which appreciate having annoying defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Toxapex crippled or removed with Trick or Final Gambit. Setup sweepers also benefit greatly from Victini's presence, as it can surprise and KO defensive threats that would otherwise impede their progress; allies like Mega Medicham and Garchomp enjoy having threats like Gliscor and Landorus-T removed, and the clean field left after Victini KOes itself also affords them a free point of entry. However, Victini must be kept as healthy as possible to ensure that Final Gambit can OHKO what it needs to.

Searing Shot is another STAB option to target Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Focus Blast allows Victini to target pesky Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu along with Heatran, with its low accuracy somewhat offset by Victory Star. Victini can leverage its bulk to set up on many fast threats such as Mega Lopunny, and its buff after omniboosting lets it survive super effective moves from more passive enemies like Gliscor, making it a perfect fit on hyper offense. It is also naturally resistant to priority moves like Bullet Punch from Scizor, Vacuum Wave from Iron Valiant, and Grassy Glide from Rillaboom. Z-Celebrate Victini pairs well with entry hazard suicide leads like Landorus-T and Garchomp, as their Stealth Rock and potentially Spikes support is invaluable; with Stealth Rock, an OHKO on Tera Water Great Tusk and Ogerpon-W are near guaranteed; Stealth Rock also notably breaks Ogerpon-C’s Sturdy along with stray Focus Sashes. Victini also appreciates teammates like Close Combat Iron Valiant luring Blissey and Tera Dark Clodsire, and they also help soften up Ting-Lu for Victini.

Instead, Victini makes explosive use of each opportunity it gets to blast through foes with V-create, leaving a massive dent in many defensive cores once it manages to pivot in. Bolt Strike is used for coverage, targeting Water-types like Pelipper, Alomomola, and Toxapex. U-turn allows Victini to pivot out of bad matchups like Great Tusk and Rotom-W or after using V-create, pivoting in teammates to help it wallbreak. Encore can lock greedy setup sweepers like Gliscor and Garganacl into moves like Swords Dance or Iron Defense, allowing Victini to give its ally a free switch in or simply hit something hard with V-create. Toxic is an alternative to wear down defensive threats like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T into range of Victini or an ally and also cripple other switch-ins like Garchomp and Dragonite. Tera Fire cranks up the power of V-create, turning Victini into a wallbreaker capable of scorching most neutral targets for a 2HKO, like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Ting-Lu, and also notably OHKOing Tornadus-T. However, it then loses valuable resistances to Fighting- and Psychic-type moves, leaving it unable to check Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham after Tera. Victini suits bulky offense teams that appreciate its role compression both offensively and defensively. Wallbreakers like Weavile, Urshifu-R, and Mega Charizard Y all appreciate Victini's ability to give them free points of entry with U-turn, and the latter also boosts V-create with sun. However, due to its weakness to Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed, as well as its weakness to Knock Off and Pursuit in general, Victini appreciates having teammates that can beat Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile; Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny are good partners to check them and in the latter's case also absorb Knock Off. Victini is also vulnerable to Water-type moves from the likes of Mega Swampert and Basculegion especially when they are in rain, so allies that can soak up these moves like Gastrodon and Ferrothorn are good partners. In return, Victini takes Grass- and Fire-type moves for them, respectively. Finally, Tornadus-T, Landorus-T and Gliscor can help switch into Ground-type moves from the likes of Great Tusk, opposing Landorus-T, and Garchomp, and in return Victini tanks Ice-type moves from Alolan Ninetales and Kyurem for them.</p>"

Hidden Power Fire hits common Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground threatens Heatran and Victini, although Tera Grass Heatran can still wall either variant. Both crucially provide it coverage to hit Gholdengo. Leftovers provides Serperior with longevity to use Substitute more freely and fully take advantage of Glare. Tera Grass amplifies the power of Leaf Storm, allowing Serperior to break past Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Toxapex with greater ease.

Surf is an alternative over Razor Shell that trades overall power for the ability to hit Great Tusk's lower Special Defense and avoid activating Glimmora's Toxic Debris. Knock Off allows Hisuian Samurott to make progress against the enemy team by removing items, especially Heavy-Duty Boots, but Taunt is another option that denies opposing entry hazards and prevents Defog. For the last slot, Aqua Jet is useful for finishing off faster leads such as Great Tusk, while Sucker Punch is a stronger but less reliable Aqua Jet alternative that hits Pokemon like Dragapult and Walking Wake. Finally, Encore is useful for locking opposing Pokemon into undesirable moves such as forcing an opposing lead to use Stealth Rock repeatedly, allowing Hisuian Samurott to stack more Spikes with Ceaseless Edge. Taunt and Encore also prevent Hisuian Samurott from becoming setup fodder from Pokemon like Iron Defense Zamazenta and Tera Water Garganacl that attempt to exploit Hisuian Samurott's relative passivity. Focus Sash ensures Hisuian Samurott can take any one hit and set up at least one layer of Spikes. Tera Ghost is the preferred option to block Rapid Spin. However, Tera Water can also be considered to power up Hisuian Samurott's Water-type STAB moves, especially if running Aqua Jet. Sharpness is generally the preferred ability to boost the power of both Ceaseless Edge and Razor Shell. However, if Hisuian Samurott is using Surf instead, Torrent can also be considered for greater power against bulky variants of Great Tusk when at low health, which works extremely well with Focus Sash.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott fits best on hyper offense teams looking for a suicide lead to start the game off with entry hazards. This set is useful, as it virtually guarantees that a layer of Spikes will go up, since Ceaseless Edge is not affected by Taunt and Hatterene's Magic Bounce. Gholdengo is highly recommended to deny opposing Rapid Spin and Defog. A Stealth Rock setter such as Great Tusk or Sandy Shocks can further supplement the team's hazard pressure. In particular, Sandy Shocks has a strong matchup against Zapdos and Glimmora, while Hisuian Samurott can cover Ting-Lu for Sandy Shocks. A Knock Off user such as Meowscarada, Great Tusk, or Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from enemy Pokemon to make them vulnerable to Spikes. Powerful sweepers that can take advantage of the hazard pressure Hisuian Samurott creates are good teammates. Such Pokemon include Kingambit, Dragonite, Sneasler, Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant.

Aside from its reliability and higher critical hit ratio, Aqua Cutter's main benefit is to avoid Static from Zapdos and Rocky Helmet from the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T; on the other hand, Razor Shell can be used for its Defense drop alongside slightly higher Base Power. Aqua Jet rounds off Hisuian Samurott's moveset by providing ever-so-useful priority to clean up weakened teams with faster threats and either revenge kill or discourage Pokémon like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and offensive Great Tusk from coming in. Sucker Punch is a much stronger alternative and hits Water-resistant foes like Walking Wake and Dragapult, but it's less reliable due to poor interaction with status moves like Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Substitute. Mystic Water can be used boost Hisuian Samurott's damage output on its Water-type moves without the cost of its HP like Life Orb would; Heavy-Duty Boots, on the other hand, helps give Hisuian Samurott more longevity so that it gets more chances to spread hazards via Ceaseless Edge and wallbreak early-game. Tera Water serves a similar purpose to Mystic Water, being potentially useful to sweep a team or generally increase the damage of Aqua Jet and Aqua Cutter; on the other hand, Tera Dark significantly boosts Ceaseless Edge and Sucker Punch. Both Tera types can also have defensive impacts, like Tera Water allowing Hisuian Samurott to stomach a hit from Zamazenta or Iron Valiant and Tera Dark doing the same for Zapdos.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott is a great fit on bulky offenses and balances that appreciate its entry hazard stacking ability and wallbreaking prowess all condensed in one slot; more well-rounded team styles can afford giving Hisuian Samurott more turns to click Ceaseless Edge or apply raw offensive pressure between Swords Dance and Aqua Cutter. To aid in that, teammates that can help provide momentum are very welcome, such as U-turn users like Cinderace, Dragapult; Volt Switch users like Zapdos; and even Eject Pack users like Close Combat Great Tusk. Pokemon that appreciate their checks getting worn down by Spikes are also fantastic teammates; Dragapult and Gholdengo deserve a mention, as their most common check in Kingambit especially dislikes coming into Spikes if it's not holding an Air Balloon, but almost any wallbreaker strongly appreciates Hisuian Samurott's Spikes and offensive pressure, with examples including Kingambit, offensive Zapdos, and Walking Wake. Hisuian Samurott may have trouble with its work being undone by hazard removers like Great Tusk, Defog Corviknight, and Court Change Cinderace. Gholdengo is a good help with the first two, whereas for the latter, having a team with strong momentum options like the aforementioned U-turn, Volt Switch, and Eject Pack users as well as Pokemon that take advantage of pivot Cinderace like Heatran or Volcanion are welcome.</p>"

Knock Off removes valuable items from Pokemon that rely on them, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite as well as Leftovers from Corviknight and Toxapex. Sacred Sword is a great coverage move for Hisuian Samurott, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Kingambit and opposing Hisuian Samurott.

          "description": "<p>The name of the game with Hisuian Samurott is finding as many opportunities as possible to use Ceaseless Edge in order to repeatedly set up Spikes. This set aims to leverage Hisuian Samurott's natural resistances by equipping an Assault Vest, allowing it to come in on Gholdengo, Heatran, and Kingambit lacking Low Kick and Tera Blast Fairy. Knock Off makes progress against teams otherwise unphased by Hisuian Samurott's offensive profile, removing valuable items from the likes of Zapdos, Dondozo, and Toxapex. Sacred Sword is an alternative that better rounds out Hisuian Samurott's neutral coverage while hitting Kingambit and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Hisuian Samurott is a great utilizer of priority moves due to its proficiency at weakening teams with entry hazards damage, and it has two options in Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch. Aqua Jet has better coverage against Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Sneasler, while Sucker Punch trades in reliability for power and is a better option for revenge killing the likes of Choice-locked Dragapult. If electing to run Aqua Jet, Tera Water is ideal to boost its power as well as Razor Shell's. If running Sucker Punch, Tera Dark is the better choice, especially if Knock Off is also being used. On the flipside, Tera Steel is useful as a defensive Tera type for reversing the matchup against Moonblast from Enamorus and Iron Valiant and resisting Dragon-type moves from Dragapult. Tera Ghost is another option, stifling foes attempts at removing hazards via Rapid Spin, though this does make Hisuian Samurott vulnerable to Shadow Ball from Dragapult and Gholdengo, which it was previously able to come in on. 20 Special Defense EVs in combination with an Assault Vest ensures Hisuian Samurott takes a Moonblast from non-Choice Specs Iron Valiant or a Draco Meteor from Modest Choice Specs Dragapult from full HP.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott fits very well on balanced and bulky offensive teams that appreciate entry hazard stacking as well as role compression from it being able to take a few special hits thanks to its Assault Vest. Other Pokemon that fit on these sorts of offensive teams that also appreciate the opposing team being weakened by Spikes, such as Kingambit, Dragonite, and Sneasler are beneficial allies. Gholdengo specifically is a very good teammate, as it blocks both Rapid Spin and Defog and can take advantage of some of Hisuian Samurott's switch-ins like Amoonguss and Toxapex. Dragapult is also an option for spinblocking. It additionally is great at forcing switches, racking up hazard damage. VoltTurn support from Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Corviknight is a worthwhile consideration to give Hisuian Samurott more opportunities to throw off attacks. While Hisuian Samurott can come in once or twice on attacks from Pokemon like Gholdengo and Heatran, it's by no means a reliable answer. Ting-Lu and Tera Water Garganacl work well as primary answers to these threat while also forming a hazard stacking core alongside Hisuian Samurott. They can set up Stealth Rock while also greatly benefiting from its ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Hisuian Samurott is a very threatening wallbreaker that provides invaluable utility to its team with the Spikes laid by Ceaseless Edge. Black Glasses boosts Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge and Sucker Punch to further heights, allowing it to have an easier time breaking through foes such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Ferrothorn with the former while also giving it an easier time dispatching of revenge killers like Kartana and Iron Moth with the latter. Protective Pads lets Hisuian Samurott avoid contact effects from Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Moltres which could otherwise stop or significantly hinder its ability to wallbreak. Tera Dark further amplifies the power of Hisuian Samurott's Dark-type STAB attacks, allowing it to OHKO targets like Mega Medicham with Sucker Punch without Black Glasses while dealing massive damage to defensive cores which could otherwise shrug off Ceaseless Edge even while boosted, such as Zapdos and Skarmory. Alternatively, Tera Poison provides a useful defensive typing that can turn the tables on foes such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, as well as deny Toxic from Alomomola and turn it into setup fodder. Offensive teams that appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to punch holes in opposing defensive structures while laying Spikes to help them break such as Kartana, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Lele make for good teammates. Defensive teams featuring Dondozo have no trouble with taking boosted Ceaseless Edge, so Tapu Koko and Ferrothorn are good teammates to help with this weakness. These two also assist with ensuring Alomomola and Toxapex are no problem for Hisuian Samurott, since they can otherwise threaten with a potential Toxic or Scald. Additionally, opposing offensive teams can make it hard for Hisuian Samurott to find its footing due to its middling Speed stat, so Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham can assist in these matchups while appreciating the Spikes set versus more balanced styles. Teammates who effectively use Knock Off such as Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Ferrothorn are great teammates as they can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Toxapex, making them more susceptible to the Spikes set by Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott is one of Water’s best options for a Choice Scarf user. This is owed to its great STAB combination, of which both types are resisted by only a scant few Pokemon in the metagame, higher power than what is initially apparent due to Sharpness bolstering its slicing moves, a good Speed tier that allows it to outspeed and revenge kill key threats such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and unique progress-making utility for Water in the form of Ceaseless Edge and Knock Off.</p> <p>Ceaseless Edge is Hisuian Samurott’s most important move, allowing it not only to threaten and KO foes with the raw power of a Sharpness-boosted Dark-type STAB move but also set up a layer of Spikes with each use, putting pressure on opposing teams and potentially opening up holes in defensive cores for its teammates to exploit. It is important to note that Spikes laid by Ceaseless Edge cannot be reflected by Magic Bounce, meaning Hisuian Samurott can safely click Ceaseless Edge against Hatterene and still get Spikes up. Hisuian Samurott’s secondary STAB move is a choice between Aqua Cutter and Razor Shell. Aqua Cutter is generally preferred for its consistency due it not making contact with the opponent and its perfect accuracy, allowing Hisuian Samurott to safely deal with Volcarona and Moltres. However, Razor Shell is guaranteed to OHKO Flutter Mane and provides Hisuian Samurott with more wallbreaking capability due to its 50% chance to reduce Defense if the user is willing to tolerate the risk of missing. Sacred Sword serves as an excellent coverage option, allowing Hisuian Samurott to eliminate foes such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Finally, Knock Off provides Hisuian Samurott with a secondary utility in the form of item removal, which can cripple Leftovers users such as Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Toxapex and open up Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Amoonguss to being chipped down by entry hazards, making Hisuian Samurott even riskier for foes to switch into.</p> <p>In terms of teammates, physically defensive Rotom-W is an excellent partner for Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott, checking several of Hisuian Samurott’s bad matchups such as Azumarill, Garchomp, and Scarf Great Tusk and providing Hisuian Samurott with safe opportunities to come in via Volt Switch. Toxapex is another great teammate for Hisuian Samurott, being able to switch into and take hits repeatedly from faster Choice Scarf users such as Sneasler, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant thanks to its defensive typing coupled with Regenerator and Recover. Moreover, Toxapex can serve as an answer to Urshifu-R and can compound on the pressure of Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes with its own Toxic Spikes, while benefitting itself from Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes punishing foes switching around. Gastrodon or Quagsire can absorb Electric-type moves for Hisuian Samurott and set up Stealth Rock to compliment Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes. Wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R, Greninja, Basculegion-M, and Walking Wake as well as sweepers such as Basculegion-F also synergize well with Hisuian Samurott, with Spikes support allowing them to more easily break through enemy teams and the speed control from Choice Scarf meaning potential revenge killers can be removed ahead of time. The speed control from Choice Scarf is still useful even on rain teams even when accompanied by Swift Swim Pokemon such as Basculegion-F, as rain will not always be present on the battlefield. Furthermore, either forme of Basculegion can serve as a spinblocker to prevent the removal of Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes.</p>"

Knock Off provides utility by removing items from switch-ins such as Corviknight and Quaquaval. Sucker Punch is a good priority move that lets Hisuian Samurott deal heavy damage to faster foes such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Zapdos. Brick Break can be used instead to deal with dual screens leads such as Corviknight and Mew. Hisuian Samurott's ability to set up Spikes and pester defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Scream Tail by removing their items is appreciated by various offensive teammates such as Chien-Pao and Galarian Zapdos that can take advantage of chipped foes. Fluffy and Intimidate Quaquaval wall Hisuian Samurott very easily, so spinblockers such as Desolate Land Skeledirge and Ceruledge are good partners as they can pressure Quaquaval and block it from removing Spikes set by Hisuian Samurott.

If a teammate can remove entry hazards, Rock Slide is an alternative that stops Celesteela and Skarmory from stonewalling Excadrill, as well as handling threats such as both Thundurus formes. As a Sand Rush sweeper, Excadrill needs to partner with Tyranitar or Hippowdon to outpace the entire metagame. Strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar, Latios, and Dracozolt form a strong offensive core with Excadrill to help overwhelm its checks such as Slowbro or Skarmory.

The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense to better check threats such as Mega Latias. Toxic is a great option to cripple common switch-ins to Excadrill such as Buzzwole, Tangrowth, and Slowbro while pressuring other threats such as Latias and Mega Sableye, providing more long-term support for its teammates. Iron Head can be used to check threats such as Clefable more easily. Swords Dance is an option, if running Iron Head instead of Toxic, to become a powerful setup sweeper. If running Swords Dance, then a more offensive EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used. Stealth Rock is another option that gives Excadrill additional role compression as a hazard setter. Excadrill can struggle against physical walls such as Slowbro, Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Celesteela.

Excadrill can be forced out by faster threats such as Galarian Zapdos, Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Blacephalon; defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro and Tapu Fini can help manage them, and these also give Excadrill slow pivoting in Teleport and Misty Terrain, respectively. Other defensive pivots such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu can help deal with Ground- and Water-type checks such as Hippowdown, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini; however, run High Horsepower instead of Earthquake if pairing with Tapu Bulu due to Grassy Terrain cutting Earthquake's power in half.

Lilligant can opt to run Encore last in tandem with Tera Electric to take advantage of careless Thunder Wave users like Blissey and Umbreon, locking them into the move and granting Lilligant free setup opportunities.

Choice Scarf Mesprit and Rotom can invite in special walls like Blissey, Cryogonal, and Umbreon and Trick them, completely impairing their ability to check Lilligant effectively.</p>"

In sun, Hisuian Lilligant can use its Grass-type STAB move Solar Blade without the drawbacks of the normal two-turn charge. Ice Spinner allows it to hit common checks that resist both of its STAB types such as Zapdos, Amoonguss, Dragapult, and Dragonite for super effective damage. Leftovers in particular works well with Victory Dance, as Hisuian Lilligant is able to heal from some of the damage it takes while it sets up on physical attackers. Life Orb is an option that helps Hisuian Lilligant overwhelm some targets with extra power like Walking Wake, OHKOing it with Close Combat after a Victory Dance. A Jolly nature allows it to Speed tie Unburden Adamant Sneasler in sun, while an Adamant nature provides extra power that may be necessary to overwhelm targets like Zapdos, Amoonguss, and Zamazenta. Tera Ghost allows Hisuian Lilligant to spinblock and threaten some of its best checks in Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge with Tera Blast. Tera Ghost also allows Hisuian Lilligant to block Extreme Speed from Dragonite, preventing revenge kills. Tera Fire with Tera Blast is also an option, giving Hisuian Lilligant a strong sun-boosted Fire-type STAB move for coverage to hit bulky targets like Amoonguss and Gholdengo hard. Another benefit of Tera Fire is an immunity to burn from Pokemon like Moltres and Cinderace. Hisuian Lilligant requires Torkoal as a partner, as Hisuian Lilligant requires sun support, which Torkoal is able to set up automatically with Drought. Hisuian Lilligant’s ability to weaken Water-types and opposing team structures makes Iron Moth a dangerous late-game sweeper in sun. Hisuian Lilligant is only able to afford to run one coverage move, which can leave it vulnerable to checks it cannot afford to run coverage for, such as Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, Amoonguss, and Moltres. Great Tusk, Sandy Shocks, and Walking Wake are all great teammates capable of handling some of the aforementioned checks. Great Tusk and Sandy Shocks threaten Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Moltres. Walking Wake is able to break Amoonguss with Draco Meteor, as well as blow past Moltres, which is usually able to wall Hisuian Lilligant.</p>"

Leaf Blade 2HKOes Toxapex at +1 and threatens Water's two Unaware Pokemon, Dondozo and Quagsire. Close Combat hits Ice- and Steel-types trying to switch into Hisuian Lilligant's Grass STAB move, as well as having a favorable roll to OHKO both Corviknight and Hisuian Goodra at +1. Finally, Ice Spinner hits Dragon- and Flying-types such as Dragonite and Thundurus-T, as well as Unaware Clodsire on Ground. Wide Lens is used to reduce the accuracy drop from Hustle. Sleep Powder can be run to give Hisuian Lilligant more setup opportunities, but the loss of coverage in Ice Spinner or STAB in Close Combat is notable.</p> <p>Great Tusk is a great teammate for Hisuian Lilligant, as it threatens out Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and the Poison-types that can stop a Hisuian Lilligant sweep. Great Tusk can soften up Hisuian Lilligant's checks by setting Stealth Rock. In return, Hisuian Lilligant uses Water-types such as Hisuian Samurott and Quagsire, which threaten Great Tusk, as setup opportunities. Iron Valiant can break through common checks to Hisuian Lilligant such as the aforementioned Skeledirge and Gholdengo thanks to either Shadow Ball on special sets or Knock Off on mixed ones. Sneasler is a secondary sweeper that can also threaten Fairy-types such as Enamorus-T. Its Choice Scarf set can also beat Volcarona, which can use Hisuian Lilligant as setup fodder, with Rock Slide and use Switcheroo to hinder defensive walls trying to switch in. Iron Hands uses its insane bulk, bolstered by Assault Vest, to sponge special attacks very easily from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Hatterene. It also hits Flying-types hard with its Electric STAB moves, and can pivot Hisuian Lilligant in with Volt Switch. In return, Hisuian Lilligant breaks the Ground-types that threaten both Iron Hands and Sneasler. Finally, Zamazenta takes physical attacks well with Dauntless Shield and can threaten Ghost-types that Hisuian Lilligant struggles to break with Crunch. Its Iron Defense sets also do well against Steel, where Hisuian Lilligant is less effective.</p>"

It can deal out considerable damage to some of the meta's bulkiest Pokemon such as Corviknight and Iron Hands and is the best wincon on Grass in order to beat Flying. Ice Spinner allows Hisuian Lilligant to threaten opposing Dragon- and Flying-types like Enamorus, Galarian Zapdos, and Dragapult, as well as opposing Ground-types like Clodsire and Great Tusk if it does not run Leaf Blade. Sleep Powder is often preferred over Leaf Blade to give Hisuian Lilligant an easier chance to set up, and the combination of Ice Spinner and Close Combat still targets a good portion of the metagame. However, Leaf Blade can be used to target Pokemon that resist Ice Spinner and Close Combat such as Toxapex and Azumarill. Wide Lens allows Hisuian Lilligant to offset the accuracy drop of its attacks due to Hustle and it also boosts the accuracy of Sleep Powder, making it a more consistent option to use in order to set up safely.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Meowscarada is a great teammate that threatens faster Dragon-types like Dragapult and Walking Wake, while Hisuian Lilligant is able to beat bulky Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra and Corviknight that Meowscarada often lures in. Amoonguss is Hisuian Lilligant's best defensive partner, as its Poison typing helps it deal with opposing Fairy-types like Azumarill, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant and also removes Toxic Spikes. Amoonguss appreciates Hisuian Lilligant's ability to dispatch opposing Flying-types like Corviknight, which can render it setup fodder, and can also assist Hisuian Lilligant's setup using Spore. Iron Leaves is another offensive partner for Hisuian Lilligant that can threaten opposing Poison-types which Lilligant cannot break through like Toxapex. Iron Leaves appreciates Hisuian Lilligant being able to threaten opposing Dark-type Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Kingambit. Brambleghast offers hazard support with Spikes, allowing Hisuian Lilligant to have secure KOs on Pokemon like Alolan Muk. Furthermore, Brambleghast offers hazard removal with Rapid Spin, which improves Hisuian Lilligant's longevity by giving it more opportunities to switch in. Zarude is also an offensive partner that is able to threaten Gholdengo and also Skeledirge, which gives Grass teams a tough time in the Ghost matchup. Furthermore, its ability to threaten Poison's defensive staples like Clodsire, Toxapex, and Alolan Muk after a boost is appreciated. Rotom-C helps Hisuian Lilligant threaten key members Water teams if it opts not to use Leaf Blade, like Pelipper and Basculegion, while Hisuian Lilligant can threaten Thundurus-T so Rotom can threaten Flying teams easier.</p>"

It also OHKOes offensive Celesteela, Scizor, and bulky Cinderace at +1, as well as 2HKOing Scizor and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Encore can lock foes into recovery and setup moves, such as Skarmory with Iron Defense and Roost, forcing them out and giving Hisuian Lilligant an opportunity to set up.

Hisuian Lilligant can pair well with entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Mew, and Skarmory, which can help it to guarantee an OHKO on foes such as Galarian Moltres and offensive Scizor with Stealth Rock chip.

          "description": "<p>With Chlorophyll, powerful STAB options in Solar Blade and Close Combat, along with a respectable base 105 Attack stat, Hisuian Lilligant can function as a powerful sun sweeper. It pairs well with the main sun setter, Mega Charizard Y, as it can switch into and threaten Mega Charizard Y’s checks such as Hippowdon, Heatran, and Clodsire; in return, Mega Charizard Y beats its checks like Gholdengo and Mega Scizor, if Hisuian Lilligant lacks Tera Blast. Solar Blade is used for raw power, although Leaf Blade is still an option for consistency outside sun. Tera Blast Fire, especially in sun, gives Lilligant a powerful third STAB option to punish foes that can tank its original STAB combination like Gholdengo, Mega Scizor, and Tera Poison Cresselia. Sleep Powder is an option to shut down checks such as Dragapult or scout for Tera types from Pokemon like Kingambit and Dondozo, which can be used as setup fodders or opportunities to give a free switch to an ally; this also allows Hisuian Lilligant to use Tera Fighting over Tera Fire for more power. Ice Spinner is another option, granting an OHKO on Flying-types that can absorb Hisuian Lilligant's STAB options such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and most Zapdos sets. Hazard support is invaluable in allowing boosted Solar Blade to OHKO Toxapex lacking Heavy-Duty Boots and Mega Scizor, making Great Tusk and Heatran good partners that also passively benefit from the sun. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant is vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster threats once the sun ends, so it appreciates a sturdy defensive core to back it up; Toxapex, Heatran, and Great Tusk can tank hits from and reliably check threats such as Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny once the sun goes down, while Landorus-T and Rotom-W are examples of pivots that can help bring Hisuian Lilligant in more easily.</p>"

        "Hustle Breaker": {
          "description": "<p>Hustle coupled with Victory Dance can be used to break common defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Great Tusk, Landorus, Kingambit, and Heatran; Hisuian Lilligant also outspeeds a good portion of the metagame after a Victory Dance boost, allowing it to threaten even common Choice Scarf users such as Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, and Gholdengo. Its main drawback lies in the decrease in accuracy, which makes it inconsistent and potentially easy to KO. Wide Lens can be used to circumvent this, as the accuracy boost will minimize the chances of a miss. Grassium Z can allow Hisuian Lilligant to dismantle defensive cores, letting it OHKO the likes of Toxapex , Landorus-T, and defensive Tornadus-T and heavily damage Zapdos after a Victory Dance and Stealth Rock damage to potentially open up a hole for another ally like Kartana or Volcarona to clean up. Victory Dance allows it to outpace most of the metagame and fire off powerful attacks. Tera Blast Ground allows Hisuian Lilligant to snipe Gholdengo and Skeledirge for super effective damage whilst also notably beating common Poison-types like Toxapex and Sneasler. Sleep Powder can be considered to shut down foes and set up more easily. Ice Spinner is also an option to beat common Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Icium Z is an option when running this, as it allows Hisuian Lilligant to score an OHKO on Gliscor, defensive Landorus-T, and defensive Garchomp whilst avoiding Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin chip from the latter two. Hisuian Lilligant has trouble setting up, as it is frail enough to be susceptible to the multitude of offensive Pokemon in the tier. Its inconsistent accuracy may also sometimes leave it open to attacks. Thus, dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko is beneficial, although it should be noted that the latter summons Electric Terrain, which nullifies Sleep Powder. Entry hazard support is important to score OHKOs on certain Pokemon; for example, Bloom Doom OHKOes Toxapex and Tornadus lacking Heavy-Duty Boots after Stealth Rock damage. As such, Garchomp and Ferrothorn are examples of good entry hazard setters. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant can still be defensively checked by Pokemon like Zapdos, if lacking Ice Spinner, Volcarona, and defensive Gholdengo; allies that can beat these checks include Volcarona and Mega Diancie.</p>"

Hisuian Zorua is often competing with Drifloon for the team's Ghost-type, so it appreciates teammates like Wattrel and Toedscool that can cover for its lack of Ground-type immunity.

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a fast and strong wallbreaker with good coverage. Not only are its coverage moves good, but it has STAB on a very spammable type with fantastic neutral coverage in OU, Ghost. An incredible ability in Illusion greatly improves its wallbreaking: it can disguise itself as another teammate to create mind games, scoring great damage if opponents guess wrong. Its unique typing blocks some revenge killing moves such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Ceruledge's Shadow Sneak, and Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot is a great coverage option to OHKO Great Tusk and physically defensive Dondozo, potentially OHKO Garganacl, and 2HKO specially defensive Dondozo. Alternatively, Hyper Voice is a good STAB option, getting neutral coverage on most Pokemon that Shadow Ball cannot, and it ignores Hydreigon and Terastallized Skeledirge's Substitute. Flamethrower allows Hisuian Zoroark to 2HKO Corviknight and Amoonguss, as well as OHKOing Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast gives Hisuian Zoroark a way to catch incoming Kingambit off guard, and it hits Garganacl and Ting-Lu super effectively, which is very helpful if forgoing Grass Knot. With Trick, Hisuian Zoroark can cripple walls like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl, as well as bulky setup sweepers it cannot threaten immediately, like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Tera Fire or Tera Water Hatterene. However, giving away Choice Specs sacrifices some of the OHKOs and 2HKOs mentioned above. U-turn is a great alternative to bring teammates in safely on Assault Vest Azumarill and Ting-Lu. Tera Normal and Tera Ghost boost Hisuian Zoroark's already powerful STAB moves, with boosted Hyper Voice always OHKOing Great Tusk, while boosted Shadow Ball 2HKOes Assault Vest Azumarill. Tera Fighting is another good option, as it not only boosts Focus Blast, but it also turns Hisuian Zoroark's Dark weakness into a resistance, meaning it no longer fears Sucker Punch revenge killers.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark fits best on offensive teams. Great Tusk can set Stealth Rock, helping Hisuian Zoroark KO foes more easily, and check the Dark-types it struggles with such as Kingambit and specially defensive Ting-Lu. Pivots such as Rotom-W and Meowscarada can bring Hisuian Zoroark safely into Amoonguss and Corviknight, respectively. Rotom-W in particular is a great teammate, since it can also spread paralysis, crippling boosted sweepers and naturally fast Pokemon such as Dragonite, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult for Hisuian Zoroark to outspeed and KO. Hisuian Zoroark dislikes opposing hazards: not only does it get worn down easily, but opponents may see through its disguise based on the damage it takes from Stealth Rock. Hence, it appreciates hazard removal and prevention from the aforementioned Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Hatterene. Great Tusk and Corviknight can also come in and take a hit from Kingambit and Meowscarada, respectively, which can revenge kill Hisuian Zoroark. Corviknight in particular really appreciates Hisuian Zoroark threatening Gholdengo, which blocks its Defog. Specially defensive Pokemon like Assault Vest Azumarill and Clodsire can take a hit from Hisuian Zoroark, thus forcing it out, given its frailty. To threaten both of these checks, Choice Band Breloom is a great partner. In return, U-turn Hisuian Zoroark can bring Breloom in on these Pokemon. Lastly, setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Volcarona, and Iron Moth appreciate Hisuian Zoroark's ability to threaten their checks such as Garganacl, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, letting them clean up afterwards. Hisuian Zoroark can also disguise as them to lure in their checks and either KO them or cripple them with Trick. Hisuian Zoroark can disguise as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon to lure in physical walls such as Great Tusk and Dondozo, only for them to be OHKOed by Grass Knot. Similarly, Hisuian Zoroark can also disguise as Volcarona and Iron Moth to lure in Clodsire and Toxapex, using Trick to cripple them and open up a potential sweep.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Hisuian Zoroark is a devastating special wallbreaker thanks to its combination of unique typing, coverage, fantastic Speed, and a high Special Attack stat, and it can almost always threaten a KO after a boost. Its ability, Illusion, provides good utility by letting it draw out an unsuspecting teammate's check and blasting them with powerful special attacks. Shadow Ball hits nearly everything in the tier for solid damage with very few drawbacks, and it has the lovely side effect of potentially dropping a foe's Special Defense. Grass Knot can be utilized to sink many heavy defensive threats, such as Garganacl, Great Tusk, and Dondozo. This also comes with the advantage of being a reliable move against heavy foes like Ting-Lu without burning up valuable PP on Focus Blast or dealing with its less-than-stellar accuracy. Flamethrower hammers would-be switch-ins like Kingambit and Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast can be used to hit Ting-Lu, Hydreigon, Kingambit, and Garganacl with the same move. Tera Ghost allows Shadow Ball to more reliably OHKO Gholdengo on Focus Sash sets, and it also allows +2 Shadow Ball to OHKO Volcarona, Walking Wake, Iron Moth, and Slowking. Alternatively, Tera Fighting turns its Dark-type weakness into a resistance, leaving it less susceptible to Kingambit's Sucker Punch, Meowscarada's Knock Off, and Greninja's Dark Pulse, and it powers up Focus Blast to staggering heights. Tera Fighting Focus Blast OHKOes Garganacl and even has a good chance to OHKO Ting-Lu at +2 after Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Tera Fairy allows Hisuian Zoroark to hold off Dark-types as well as become immune to Dragapult's Dragon-type attacks. Focus Sash guarantees that Hisuian Zoroark has a chance to set up or attack. On the other hand, Life Orb can be used to add further power to Hisuian Zoroark's already formidable prowess. Life Orb ensures that +2 Shadow Ball OHKOes Volcarona, physically defensive Rotom-W, and Corviknight after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark functions best as a setup sweeper on hyper and bulky offense teams. Great Tusk is a top-class partner, providing Hisuian Zoroark invaluable utility with its excellent defenses and Rapid Spin, which keeps entry hazards off Hisuian Zoroark's side of the field and leaves its Focus Sash intact. It also provides Hisuian Zoroark more opportunities to come in and set up by threatening Pokemon that hold it down indefinitely, such as Clodsire. Dragapult and Meowscarada are faster than Hisuian Zoroark, so Pokemon that can come in and revenge kill them, such as Kingambit, are also appreciated. In return, Hisuian Zoroark can use Illusion to mask itself as Kingambit or Roaring Moon and lure in physical walls like defensive Great Tusk and Dondozo to weaken or KO them. Entry hazard setters like Glimmora, Meowscarada, and Garchomp set up hazards to chip down foes into Hisuan Zoroark's KO range, and it can stop an incoming Rapid Spin from Great Tusk in return. Hisuian Zoroark can force damage on special walls like Ting-Lu, which is highly appreciated by other special attackers like Iron Moth and Hydreigon, and vice versa. In particular, Hydreigon and Hisuian Zoroark can play Illusion mind games with Fighting-type moves, and Hydreigon can topple Clodsire with Earth Power and Substitute or Tera Steel.</p>"

Teammates like Iron Moth can KO or weaken Hisuian Zoroark's checks like specially defensive Celesteela, while it can remove foes like Hippowdon. Despite its good Speed, Hisuian Zoroark is vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster foes like Cinderace and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, making walls such as Skarmory for the former and Tapu Fini for the latter useful partners. Illusion makes Hisuian Zoroak pair nicely with Pokemon weak to Fighting and Ghost, such as Mega Tyranitar and Latios, forcing the opponent into an uneasy guessing game that can allow it or its teammates to set up. Pretending to be a physical attacker can also lure in physical walls like Skarmory and Buzzwole. Hisuian Zoroak's immunity to Ghost and Fighting makes it a powerful check to Ghost-types like Ceruledge. Hazard setters like Excadrill and Mew can weaken checks like Mega Venusaur and Iron Hands into Hisuian Zoroark's KO range.</p>"

Grass Knot 2HKOes Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon; it also 2HKOes or 3HKOes most variants of the Tyranitar formes, easing prediction and letting Hisuian Zoroark sometimes avoid having to rely on the inaccurate Focus Blast. Trick can cripple walls Hisuian Zoroark otherwise can't touch, such as Blissey and Chansey, though it must watch out for Mega Tyranitar, which is immune to Trick and can Pursuit trap the Choice-locked Hisuian Zoroark. Hisuian Zoroark fits best on offense teams. Pivots such as Cinderace and Iron Moth can provide Hisuian Zoroark safe entry for it to wallbreak. Hisuian Zoroark struggles against Dark-types after being locked into Shadow Ball, especially Pursuit users like the Tyranitar formes, making Fighting-types like Buzzwole and Iron Hands great partners for their ability to threaten them. They also work well at threatening Normal-types like Chansey and Blissey. In return, Hisuian Zoroark can eliminate physical walls like Clefable and Skarmory, and can notably lure them in thanks to Illusion. Setup sweepers like Booster Energy Iron Moth and Hydreigon can take advantage of Hisuian Zoroark weakening the opposing team's defensive cores by sweeping late-game. Entry hazard setters like Mew and Excadrill can chip Hisuian Zoroark's targets into KO range, something which notably punishes checks with limited longevity like Tapu Fini, Iron Hands, and the Tyranitar formes.</p>"

It is an incredible asset in the Ghost matchup, as it allows you to play mind games against an opponent using Flutter Mane and Dragapult by disguising itself as Gholdengo and takes advantage of Substitute by forcing a lot of switches. Hex in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp deals superb damage against threats like Flutter Mane, Amoonguss, and Quagsire and negates passive recovery on walls such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Will-O-Wisp lets you play around Sucker Punch users like Kingambit and burns other physical attackers such as Scizor that pose a threat to teammates like Flutter Mane and Mimikyu. Knock Off further cripples the aforementioned walls and removes Heavy-Duty Boots from foes, enhancing Brambleghast's Spikes, while Nasty Plot allows Hisuian Zoroark to capitalize on Substitute and use passive walls such as Toxapex, Brambleghast, and Dragalge as setup fodder. Leftovers and 252 HP EVs let Hisuian Zoroark take full advantage of Substitute and potentially sustain a few neutral attacks.</p> <p>Flutter Mane appreciates Hisuian Zoroark luring in walls like Clodsire, Gastrodon, and Amoonguss and wearing them down with Hex and Will-O-Wisp. In return, it removes threatening Dark-types like Chien-Pao, Greninja, and Iron Jugulis. Dragapult checks Hydreigon, Baxcalibur, and Gholdengo and pivots into Hisuian Zoroark with U-turn.

Hisuian Zoroark also likes to disguise itself as the previously mentioned Dragapult and Gholdengo due to them also using Substitute and Hex, potentially tricking opponents and forming a very formidable Hex spam core. Mimikyu aids against Dark-types like Kingambit and Roaring Moon and provides useful priority in Shadow Sneak. Additionally, Mimikyu appreciates Hisuian Zoroark withering down and burning the majority of opposing teams, letting Mimikyu clean up late-game without any complications.

Trick lets Hisuian Zoroark ruin defensive answers, such as Toxapex and Ting-Lu, that would otherwise take its attacks with ease. Flamethrower allows Hisuian Zoroark to hit Steel-types like Corviknight and Iron Treads more reliably than Focus Blast, while Grass Knot hits Dondozo, which would otherwise take Hisuian Zoroark's attacks.

In return, Maushold can remove entry hazards with Tidy Up and break through answers to Hisuian Zoroark such as the aforementioned Toxapex and Ting-Lu. Choice Scarf Staraptor is another great partner, as it provides a safe switch-in to Choice Scarf Great Tusk, which tends to lock into Headlong Rush, while dealing high amounts of damage itself to enable Hisuian Zoroark to clean up the rest of an opponent's team. It also provides a form of speed control against faster threats such as Dragapult. Cyclizar also provides a safe switch-in with Shed Tail while keeping hazards off the field with Rapid Spin.

However, Sawsbuck can also be unreliable at times, only Speed tying with threats like Choice Scarf Haunter and Trailblaze Houndoom and being outsped by Choice Scarf Alolan Dugtrio and Dragon Dance Charizard. When not wanting to rely on Headbutt flinches, Double-Edge gives Sawsbuck a much stronger Normal STAB move that also helps make up for its average Attack and makes it a more reliable revenge killer. Tera Normal further strengthens Double-Edge, helps make up for Headbutt's low power, and allows Sawsbuck to better take attacks such as Haunter's Sludge Bomb and Pyroar's Fire Blast. Horn Leech gives Sawsbuck a secondary STAB move, hitting threats like Klawf, Whiscash, and Misdreavus harder while providing some longevity.

It can also absorb Toxic Spikes and switch in on Toxic, which is crucial for Grass teams. Foul Play lets Amoonguss turn the tables on Swords Dance users such as Scizor and Mimikyu as well as physically oriented Dragapult and Jirachi. Sludge Bomb allows Amoonguss to hit Spore-immune Pokemon and major threats such as Breloom, Meowscarada, and Iron Valiant. Finally, Spore allows Amoonguss to give its teammates, such as Torterra and Ogerpon-H, free turns to set up by putting foes to sleep. Rocky Helmet punishes contact moves such as Choice Scarf Sneasler's Dire Claw and stops the opponent from using U-turn for free on Amoonguss. Heavy-Duty Boots can be run if Brambleghast is not a teammate, as it allows Amoonguss to come in without worrying about entry hazard damage. The given EV spread allows Amoonguss to survive Choice Specs Greninja's Ice Beam so that it can be put to sleep by Spore while being as physically bulky as possible.</p> <p>Ogerpon-H appreciates being able to come in on sleeping foes and potentially win the game with Swords Dance. It also threatens Steel- and Ice-types, such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, Alolan Ninetales, and Articuno. In exchange, Amoonguss can not only put foes to sleep but also absorb Toxic Spikes and Toxic from walls such as Toxapex and take on revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Sneasler. Torterra is another setup sweeper that greatly appreciates Amoonguss removing Toxic Spikes and putting opposing Pokemon to sleep with Spore to create a free setup opportunity. In return, Torterra threatens opposing Poison- and Steel-types, such as Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo, that Amoonguss doesn't want to deal with. Hisuian Lilligant is another good partner for Amoonguss, as it appreciates being able to use Victory Dance on sleeping foes that would otherwise threaten it, such as Landorus, as well as fit a coverage move of choice over Sleep Powder. It also appreciates Amoonguss taking on the threats that it cannot handle even after a boost, such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Choice Scarf Sneasler. In return, Hisuian Lilligant can beat Gliscor and Dragonite on Flying teams thanks to Ice Spinner while hitting Steel-types such as Heatran that can threaten Amoonguss. Breloom can also beat opposing Steel-types thanks to its Fighting STAB moves, as well as tackle troublesome Dark-types such as Kingambit thanks to Mach Punch. Choice Scarf Meowscarada provides Grass teams with speed control, as well as hitting dangerous threats such as Chien-Pao, Hydreigon, Galarian Slowking, and Hoopa-U. It appreciates Amoonguss being able to switch in on Fairy-types like Clefable in return. Brambleghast can remove hazards to let Amoonguss run Rocky Helmet and switch in more safely. It can also set its own hazards thanks to Spikes, letting it compound on Amoonguss's Rocky Helmet chip damage. Finally, Brambeghast can switch into Hurricane from the likes of Zapdos and Tornadus-T, hit annoyances to Amoonguss, such as Hatterene and Gholdengo, with a strong Poltergeist, and revenge kill threats such as Flutter Mane with Shadow Sneak. Sinistcha serves as a reliable answer to threats such as Zamazenta that would otherwise use Amoonguss as setup fodder. Abomasnow provides Amoonguss with a nifty Ice neutrality, being able to take on Chien-Pao thanks to its defensive typing, snow's Defense boost, and Aurora Veil.

A Relaxed nature is used to not dampen the power of Amoonguss's Stomping Tantrum, while Defense EVs are prioritized to help against physical Ground-types like Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Iron Treads.</p> <p>Toxapex forms an effective physically defensive Regenerator core alongside Amoonguss, as it deals with Fire- and Ice-types such as Paldean Tauros-F and Chien-Pao that give Amoonguss trouble while wearing down the opposing team with a combination of Toxic Spikes and Rocky Helmet. Skuntank deals with Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Espathra and Flutter Mane and uses Sucker Punch to pick off threats such as Dragapult late-game. It can also run Fire Spin to trap and forcibly remove Hatterene—a Pokemon that greatly threatens Amoonguss and prevents Skuntank from setting Toxic Spikes against Fairy and Psychic teams with ease. Unaware Clodsire is a specially defensive wall that deals with nearly all special attackers including Volcarona, Hydreigon, and non-Psyshock Flutter Mane. It also sets Spikes, which Amoonguss benefits from due to its ability to force switches, and is able to heavily damage Kingambit in a pinch. Glimmora provides entry hazard support by setting Stealth Rock and can use Toxic in combination with Corrosion to debilitate Steel- and Poison-types that Amoonguss hates such as Corviknight and Toxapex. It can remove entry hazards with Mortal Spin, which helps with Amoonguss's longevity in case its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed, and is also the primary way of dealing with Skeledirge. Iron Moth can don a Choice Scarf to deal with boosted threats such as Swords Dance Chien-Pao and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur, which shatter Poison teams, or run a Substitute set to better deal with Kingambit. Both Glimmora and Iron Moth can also run Air Balloon, which is greatly appreciated when up against Choice Specs Sandy Shocks or Choice Band Great Tusk, as these two have a good chance to overwhelm Amoonguss in the long run.</p>"

Regenerator allows Amoonguss to check those same threats long-term; it also prevents it from being worn down by pivots like Rotom-W and Tapu Koko as well as entry hazards if its Heavy-Duty Boots is removed via Knock Off. Spore incapacitates switch-ins such as Heatran, Volcarona, and Dragapult; the latter two would otherwise use it as setup fodder, while the former completely walls Amoonguss by being immune to Sludge Bomb. Sludge Bomb spreads status against the aforementioned Volcarona and Dragapult as well as bulkier switch-ins like Skeledirge and Tornadus-T and threatens Iron Valiant. Hidden Power Fire lets Amoonguss chip Poison-immune foes like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor as well as OHKO Kartana, preventing them from safely switching in. Heavy-Duty Boots lets it switch in as much as needed without fear of entry hazard damage; it also prevents Regenerator recovery from being stifled in longer games. Rocky Helmet is an alternative that wears down contact attackers like Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T as well as the aforementioned rain wallbreakers in Barraskewda and Floatzel. It should only be used if entry hazard control is decent enough, however, with support from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Rotom-W. Tera Water provides invaluable resistances against Fire and Ice, letting Amoonguss potentially get an emergency Sludge Bomb or Spore in against foes like Weavile and Heatran. Tera Steel is an alternative that lets Amoonguss emergency check offensive foes like Tapu Lele while also giving it a better matchup against non-Heat Wave Tornadus-T; it also retains the Ice resistance given by Tera Water. Rotom-W is an excellent partner, as it stifles offensive and defensive Pokemon alike that Amoonguss struggles with, such as Heatran, Skeledirge, and Tornadus-T. In return, Amoonguss takes pressure off Rotom-W as a check to rain wallbreakers and can deal with Rotom-W switch-ins like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth. Gholdengo completely counters Amoonguss by virtue of its immunity to Spore and it taking negligible damage from Hidden Power Fire; as such, checks to it such as Kingambit and Poison Jab Clodsire are recommended, with the latter forcing Gholdengo to Terastallize so it can freely fish for poison.</p>"

Furthermore, its excellent typing and great physical bulk allow it to check threats like Cinderace and Dragonite and absorb Knock Off from common Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads, preserving its teammate's Heavy-Duty Boots. Whirlpool further enhances Alomomola's pivoting abilities, letting it trap switch-ins and pivot out to the appropriate answer while preventing their double switch. In conjunction with Protect, Whirlpool also racks up passive damage on offensive Pokemon and walls such as Rotom-W and Ting-Lu that lack reliable recovery. Protect also allows Alomomola to heal itself with Wish, scout the moves of powerful wallbreakers, and prevent them from forcing progress when paired with Future Sight. Chilling Water makes Alomomola a more self-sufficient physical wall, reducing its passivity against sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Ceruledge, and Bulk Up Great Tusk. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Alomomola to avoid entry hazard damage before getting struck by Knock Off, which is especially important against Toxic Spikes. Minimizing Alomomola's Speed allows it to underspeed Corviknight to hit the incoming switch-in from U-turn instead and thus, avoid wasting PP due to Pressure. Tera Flying improves Alomomola's matchup against Great Tusk and Meowscarada, turning it into an even better Knock Off absorber, and lets it wall Breloom. It also makes Alomomola immune to Spikes and allows it to take less passive damage from Salt Cure.</p> <p>Alomomola's Wish and ability to blanket check various threats benefit all of its teammates on stall teams. Toxapex is an exceptional partner that forms a strong Regenerator core with Alomomola. Together, they can stall Garganacl out of Salt Cure PP and pivot around strong physical attackers such as Breloom, Choice Band Dragapult, and Roaring Moon. Dondozo handles physical sweepers too powerful for Alomomola to deal with, such as Kingambit and Azumarill, and greatly appreciates Wish due to its lack of reliable recovery. Alomomola's low special bulk mandates sturdy specially defensive partners; Clodsire can take on special sweepers such as Gholdengo and Hydreigon that attempt to use Alomomola as setup fodder, while Blissey switches into the tier's most powerful special wallbreakers, such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Hisuian Zoroark. Ting-Lu checks special attackers like Dragapult and Iron Moth and, alongside Clodsire and Toxapex, sets entry hazards that can quickly wear down offensive teams to let Alomomola apply more pressure with Whirlpool. Like Dondozo, it also greatly appreciates Wish to reduce its reliance on Rest. Talonflame carries Defog to account for Alomomola's vulnerability to entry hazards after taking Knock Off. Corviknight can do the same as well as absorb Knock Off for Alomomola. In addition, Talonflame checks Breloom, while Corviknight checks Meowscarada, which lets Alomomola preserve its Terastallization. Lastly, Gholdengo checks Breloom and Iron Valiant, appreciates Alomomola dealing with Cinderace and Great Tusk, and provides stall with a setup sweeper to break down balance teams with Nasty Plot.</p>"

Heavy-Duty Boots is the standard item for Alomomola; however if a team lacks a way to punish contact moves and has sufficient hazard removal, then Rocky Helmet should be considered. Tera Dragon allows Alomomola to check Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Koko missing Dazzling Gleam, while Tera Fairy improves its matchup against Choice Band Zamazenta, Baxcalibur, and Mega Lopunny, and Tera Poison provides a Toxic immunity and checks Iron Valiant. Common Pokemon unhindered by Toxic use Alomomola as setup fodder, such as Gliscor, Substitute variants of Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor. Rocky Helmet users such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory can punish the use of Flip Turn, along with Water Absorb Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W and some Clodsire variants can prevent the move from having any effect. Spikes, in conjunction with Knock Off from users like Mega Scizor, Hisuian Samurott, and Ferrothorn can also be extremely lethal to Alomomola. Knock Off can be used to cripple Pokemon that heavily rely on Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers, such as Zapdos, opposing Alomomola, Heatran, and Landorus-T, or Scald to threaten Kartana and Mega Scizor; but it should be noted that not using Toxic gives free setup turns to dangerous foes like Volcarona and Baxcalibur. Running a Sassy nature allows Alomomola to check Mega Diancie, while a Relaxed nature helps Alomomola pivot around Great Tusk. Teammates such as Ting-Lu and Heatran both take great advantage of Alomomola's support and can help shore up some of Alomomola's weaknesses, checking Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Volcarona, while more offensive partners like Zapdos and Ursaluna-B can cover some of these weaknesses while also offsetting Alomomola's passivity, the former answering Kartana, and Zamazenta while the latter helps with Tapu Koko and Zapdos.</p>"

It's an incredible asset for Grass teams, as it can manage notable threats such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Melmetal. Gyro Ball capitalizes on its low Speed and threatens Fairy-types and fast foes like Alolan Ninetales and Tapu Lele. However, Iron Head provides more consistent damage against slower foes like Hatterene and is less susceptible to PP stalling, which is particularly useful against Kyurem if Ferrothorn isn't running Body Press. Depending on its teammates, Ferrothorn can opt for Stealth Rock or Spikes, as Cradily can also set up Stealth Rock, while Meowscarada has access to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. With the combination of Leech Seed and Leftovers, Ferrothorn gains substantial recovery each turn, enabling it to wear down and punish switch-ins such as Heatran, Aegislash, and Nidoking. Protect serves as a scouting tool and extends the benefits of Leech Seed and Leftovers, while Body Press allows Ferrothorn to utilize its high Defense and deal significant damage to Steel- and Dark-types, like Melmetal and Weavile. When in conjunction with Gyro Ball, Body Press ensures that Substitute Kyurem won't be able to PP stall Ferrothorn, and when used with Iron Head, it guarantees an OHKO against Weavile. The featured EV spread both prevents a 2HKO from Choice Band Weavile's Icicle Crash and lets Ferrothorn almost always beat SubRoost Kyurem.</p> <p>Ferrothorn forms a formidable defensive core with Mega Venusaur, as the latter's typing and ability enable it to come in on Fighting- and Ice-types such as Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Galarian Darmanitan. Additionally, Mega Venusaur's Sludge Bomb can poison foes, allowing Ferrothorn's combination of Leech Seed and Protect to wear them down more quickly. Cradily is another valuable partner, providing natural special bulk and a favorable matchup against Blacephalon and Nidoking. Offensive partners such as Rillaboom, Meowscarada, Iron Leaves, and Zarude greatly appreciate Ferrothorn weakening the opposing team with entry hazards and Leech Seed. In return, Rillaboom sets up Grassy Terrain for additional recovery and provides strong priority damage, while Choice Scarf Meowscarada can revenge kill threats such as boosted Kommo-o. Whimsicott and Celebi handle Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant and Kommo-o, which would otherwise pose a threat to Ferrothorn. Whimsicott also punishes setup sweepers like Volcarona or Mega Scizor, which could otherwise use Ferrothorn as setup fodder, while Celebi helps ease the Poison matchup, as well as the Steel matchup in a pinch.</p>"

The former two can otherwise easily outspeed and burn Eelektross and eventually beat it down with boosted Hex. Tera Steel prevents Toxic from Muk, Qwilfish, and Vespiquen and retains an amazing defensive profile thanks to Levitate. Entry hazards set by the likes of Qwilfish and Sandaconda allow Eelektross to rack up damage against incoming checks like Rotom and Lurantis with Dragon Tail. Drifblim and the aforementioned Qwilfish also appreciate Eelektross's Electric resistance.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Assault Vest Eelektross is a premier defensive pivot. Its lack of weaknesses, immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and excellent Assault Vest-boosted special bulk allow it to check common special attackers like Jolteon, Zoroark, and Oricorio. Its low Speed tier paired with 0 Speed IVs allows it to take hits and then safely bring in frailer teammates like Haunter, Zoroark, and Bruxish with U-turn. As such, it fits well on VoltTurn cores with the likes of Bombirdier, Passimian, and Scyther, wearing down the opposing team with pivot moves. Discharge is prefered over Thunderbolt due to the increased paralysis chance. Giga Drain threatens Sandaconda while providing some recovery. Dragon Tail phazes foes, pairing well with Spikes support from the likes of Qwilfish and Cacturne, and keeps Tera Ground Quiver Dance users such as Oricorio and Vivillon in check despite their Discharge immunity. Drain Punch is an alternative that still allows Eelektross to defeat Tera Ground Quiver Dance users while hitting common special attackers like Zoroark and Pyroar super effectively. Acid Spray is a viable alternative that lets Eelektross defeat setup sweepers even when they are the only remaining opposing Pokemon. Tera Steel is preferred, as it improves Eelektross's matchup against common special attackers like Indeedee-F and non-Tera Fire Vivillon while gaining an immunity to Qwilfish's Toxic.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its typing and access to Sucker Punch, Swords Dance Bisharp cements itself as a powerful wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. Knock Off offers high damage output and item removal, which can aid in chipping down checks that rely on their item, such as Leftovers Iron Hands. Sucker Punch offers valuable priority to revenge kill faster threats such as Latios and Alakazam, and, after a boost, Bisharp can thwart revenge killing attempts from faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Thundurus-T. Iron Head is a great complementary STAB move for Fairy-types such as Enamorus and Clefable, which otherwise resist Dark-type attacks, while being Bisharp's best neutral option versus Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Buzzwole. An Adamant nature enables Bisharp to threaten an OHKO on Clefable with minimal chip damage. Maximum Speed investment is needed to outspeed Mega Tyranitar, Celesteela, and Scizor and to Speed tie with opposing Bisharp. Swords Dance Bisharp works best on offensive teams with teammates such as Cinderace, Iron Hands, and Swords Dance Scizor that put pressure on shared checks such as defensive Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Buzzwole. Similarly, Bisharp pairs well with special attackers like Thundurus-T and Latios by pressuring specially defensive walls such as Blissey for them. Bisharp struggles to break through bulky Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Okidogi, making partners like Slowbro, Clefable, and Mega Latias beneficial. Future Sight support from Slowbro and Slowking aids Bisharp in whittling down the latter two in range for a boosted Knock Off or Iron Head. Bisharp is an excellent partner for entry hazard setters such as Mew and Excadrill, as Defiant deters Defog from Pokemon like Tapu Fini. In return, Bisharp appreciates hazards chipping down switch-ins like Iron Hands and Leftovers Hippowdon. Similarly, Ribombee appreciates Bisharp pressuring common Defoggers like Tapu Fini. In exchange, Sticky Web from Ribombee enables Bisharp to outspeed and significantly damage Pokemon that otherwise outspeed it, such as Excadrill and Keldeo.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Bisharp acts as an offensive answer to common Psychic- and Ghost-types in the tier, such as Ceruledge, Blacephalon and Latios, through the combination of Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Knock Off provides strong, super effective damage to targets that may not switch out immediately, including Mega Latias, Skeledirge, and Slowbro, while removing items from walls like Heavy-Duty Boots from Buzzwole and Amoonguss. Sucker Punch provides valuable priority to pick off frail or weakened faster Pokemon such as Alakazam, Ceruledge, and Hisuian Zoroark. Iron Head is a valuable option to hit Fairy-types like Enamorus and Clefable super effectively and Pokemon like Buzzwole and Tapu Fini neutrally. Investing 184 EVs into Speed enables Bisharp to outspeed fully invested offensive Celesteela prior to Autotomize and Tyranitar. Fighting-types like Okidogi, Galarian Zapdos, Buzzwole, and Mega Heracross benefit immensely from Bisharp trapping Ghost- and Psychic-types, and they also appreciate it wearing down defensive Fairy-types like Tapu Fini. Bisharp can also benefit defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth by picking off frail wallbreakers such as Iron Moth and Alakazam. Pursuit Bisharp has a noticeable weakness to bulky physical walls in the tier such as Buzzwole, Hippowdon and Skarmory, so pairing it with sufficient offensive pressure from Enamorus, Mega Latias, Iron Moth, Cinderace, and Galarian Zapdos to take advantage of these foes is appreciated. Without Swords Dance, Bisharp enables offensive Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Iron Hands, Okidogi, and Hawlucha to switch in with relative impunity. Bulky Fighting-resistant partners like Mega Latias, Slowbro, Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Mega Venusaur can help pivot into these offensive threats. Finally, Bisharp can find a place on balanced hazard stack teams alongside Skarmory or Gastrodon. It can dissuade Defog via Defiant and threaten chip damage on Defoggers like Tapu Fini with its STAB moves.</p>"

Roost gives Braviary reliable recovery and helps it heal off recoil it takes from using Brave Bird as well as giving it more opportunities to use Substitute. Substitute can take advantage of Pokemon such as Appletun and Lurantis while also allowing Braviary to avoid status from Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Sandaconda, and Umbreon. Tera Dark allows Braviary to stop Prankster from Sableye, allowing it to take advantage of it via a Substitute or Bulk Up. Alternatively, Tera Ground gives Braviary a more favorable matchup versus Electric-type Pokemon like Rotom and Eelektross as well as a Rock resistance; (SC) however, the resulting Grass weakness means it can no longer switch in on Lurantis and Appletun as freely. Tera Fighting can be used with Close Combat over Substitute for more overall power and the ability to take down Flying-type answers like Magneton while also gaining a resistance to Rock-type moves, but doing so makes Braviary vulnerable to status moves.</p> <p>Braviary struggles with faster threats with super effective coverage, often forcing it to Terastalize. As a result, specially defensive walls such as Blissey, Eelektross, and Umbreon pair well with it, with the former being notable for supporting Braviary with Wish, as Braviary will not be able to Roost easily due to its average Speed and large number of checks. Physically defensive walls such as Sandaconda and Sableye can also be useful to check Pokemon such as Tauros, Paldean Tauros, and Bombirdier. Pokemon with access to status moves such as Sableye if you are not running Tera Dark and Qwilfish if you are not running Substitute can also be troublesome for Braviary, so status absorbers such as Blissey and Hisuian Qwilfish can help with this problem. Braviary also dislikes Rocky Helmet users such as Sandaconda and Qwilfish, as the recoil can add up with Brave Bird over time. To deal with this, item disruption from Trick and Knock Off on Pokemon like Rotom, Sableye, and Samurott is ideal.</p>"

Substitute allows it to set up Nasty Plot safely, avoid would-be detrimental threats such as Garganacl's Salt Cure and status from Toxapex, Clodsire, and Rotom-W, and take advantage of the switches it forces. For its fourth move, Hydreigon can utilize Earth Power to dent Pokemon that can comfortably take a Dark Pulse such as Kingambit, Toxapex, and Garganacl. Alternatively, Flash Cannon provides coverage against Fairy-types, being able to OHKO Iron Valiant and Hatterene after a Nasty Plot, as well as having good chance to 2HKO Tera Fairy Garganacl and Skeledirge unboosted if running Life Orb. Draco Meteor can also be used as a strong neutral coverage option to straight up OHKO Great Tusk and dent Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Amoonguss. With Tera Steel, Hydreigon acquires a better defensive typing, turning its weaknesses into resistances, improving its matchups against would-be threats like Dragonite, Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Roaring Moon. Tera Steel also boosts its Flash Cannon, able to OHKO Hatterene unboosted with Life Orb. Tera Poison can also be used to grant Hydreigon a Fighting resistance and more importantly, resisting both of Iron Valiant's STAB moves. Both Tera types also give Hydreigon the ability to switch into Toxapex and Clodsire safely due to their immunity to poison, and they both work well with Levitate, which provides an immunity against an otherwise super effective attack.</p> <p>Hydreigon best fits on various offense and balance teams. Rotom-W is a good teammate since it can spread paralysis against faster Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Dragapult and bring Hydreigon in safely on walls like Amoonguss and Toxapex via Volt Switch. Other defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Skeledirge make for good teammates since they can switch into Iron Valiant, Breloom, and Volcarona. Faster offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Choice Specs Dragapult match up well against offensive teams that can overwhelm Hydreigon easily by KOing Pokemon like opposing Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark, respectively. In return, Hydreigon can overwhelm Pokemon that they typically struggle with such as Skeledirge and Kingambit. Entry hazards from the likes of Garganacl, Clodsire, and Glimmora are appreciated to wear down foes into Hydreigon's KO range; the former two Pokemon can also check Volcarona and Choice Specs Dragapult defensively, which would otherwise revenge kill Hydreigon easily—even if it's behind a Substitute—thanks to Bug Buzz and Infiltrator. If Hydreigon isn't running Earth Power, teammates that can deal with Kingambit such as Breloom and Great Tusk are appreciated; Great Tusk can also remove Stealth Rock so Hydreigon isn't worn down easily, especially if it's running Life Orb. The two of them can also handle Ting-Lu, which can otherwise wall Hydreigon and phaze it with Whirlwind. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Dragonite appreciate Hydreigon threatening Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Dondozo for them to sweep more easily.</p>"

It is one of the best checks to Gholdengo and also pairs well with it, forming a fundamentally powerful core when used with Tailwind support from Murkrow. Armarouge and Garchomp also synergize well with Hydreigon, covering for Steel-types, which it may not be able to damage effectively depending on its Tera type. Hydreigon can, however, struggle against damage reduction such as Snarl and Light Screen, with the latter coming especially from Grimmsnarl, which can easily take its STAB moves and OHKO it back with Spirit Break if Hydreigon is not Terastallized. Repeated usage of Draco Meteor can also make Hydreigon deal unimpressive amounts of damage, but this can be counteracted with Haze from Murkrow, allowing it to continue dealing devastating damage.</p> </li> </ul>",

Draco Meteor OHKOes threats like Iron Moth and Mega Heracross while doing significant damage to foes such as Galarian Moltres, Iron Hands, and Mega Sableye. Dark Pulse threatens Slowking and gives Hydreigon a spammable STAB move. Flash Cannon hits Fairy-types like Enamorus, Mega Altaria, and Clefable.

A Timid nature lets Hydreigon outspeed Excadrill and Ceruledge, while Modest gives Draco Meteor a high chance of OHKOing Choice Band Iron Hands. Hydreigon struggles to break through Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini, Azumarill, and Clefable, as well as Celesteela if not running Fire Blast, so teammates that can pressure them like both Thundurus formes and Mega Venusaur are helpful.

Knock Off support from the likes of Mega Vensaur, Clefable, and Thundurus-T is appreciated to help Hydreigon break through Pokemon like Celesteela, Tapu Fini, and Assault Vest Tangrowth.

Hydreigon fits best on bulky offense and offense teams that have reliable options to switch it in safely. Hydreigon pairs very well with pivots such as Mega Lopunny, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T, as they can switch it in against opposing defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W.

Taunt prevents passive walls such as Toxapex and Gastrodon from healing while also preventing Hydreigon from being crippled by status from the aforementioned Pokemon as well. Tera Poison gives Hydreigon a Toxic immunity and a favorable defensive typing, allowing it to safely trap Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Iron Valiant. Offensive teammates like Mega Lopunny, Volcarona, and Dragapult appreciate Hydreigon trapping and removing walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Gastrodon support Hydreigon, as they heavily chip and pressure switch-ins like Kingambit in combination with Hydreigon's Fire Spin. Hydreigon is easily forced out by Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, and Iron Valiant.

Optionally, Fiery Dance can be used over Flamethrower, which has an additional effect of boosting Special Attack, but Flamethrower is preferred due to a higher Base Power. Psychic primarily covers Poison-types like Toxapex, Glimmora, and Iron Moth, but it also hits Fighting-types such as Quaquaval and Great Tusk. Morning Sun provides reliable recovery, which allows Volcarona to further set up and threaten to sweep.

        "Quiver Dance (Fire)": {
          "description": "<p>A potent offensive presence, Volcarona's access to Quiver Dance provides the backbone to its sweeping capabilities. Bug Buzz is Volcarona's main attacking option and can be combined with Swarm to increase damage as Volcarona loses HP while setting up, allowing Volcarona to OHKO checks like offensive Garchomp after one Quiver Dance. Psychic is essential, as it allows Volcarona to hit one of Fire's strongest checks, Toxapex, but also super effectively damages Poison-types and Fighting-types such as Glimmora and Quaquaval. The last slot is interchangeable, though generally Flamethrower is preferred as a STAB move that can also take advantage of sun support on Fire teams and is essential to for the Flying matchup, allowing it to hit Corviknight and Kilowattrel. Giga Drain can be used to give Volcarona a better chance of breaking through Water and Ground teams and give it a recovery option. Similarly, Morning Sun gives Volcarona more setup opportunities. Flame Body can also be used to threaten burns on Pokemon such as Kingambit and Dragonite, which oftentimes revenge kill Volcarona. Given its all-around solid defensive stats, Volcarona finds a myriad of opportunities to set up and takes advantage of the maximum Speed spread given to capitalize on the boosts as much as possible, outspeeding Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk or Choice Scarf Dragapult after one or two Quiver Dance boosts, respectively.</p> <p>Generally, Volcarona is best saved for mid- to late-game, when the opposing team has been chipped down and Volcarona has an opportunity to sweep after setting up. Utilizing its offensive teammates such as Scovillain, Ceruledge, Cinderace, and Paldean Tauros-F to slowly chip down defensive walls such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Blissey provides better opportunity for Volcarona to sweep later in the game. Paldean Tauros-F is specifically useful with its ability to remove dual screens, preventing Volcarona's setup from being hindered. Rotom-H also provides excellent support, aiding in the Water matchup if Giga Drain is not used and providing pivot support to switch Volcarona in. Skeledirge and Talonflame provide defensive support to wear down offensive threats such as Dragonite. Torkoal providing sun support on Fire aids Volcarona, not only increasing Flamethrower's damage output, but giving Volcarona the opportunity to survive attacks like Choice Specs Greninja's Surf, giving it an opportunity to set up.</p>"

Bulky Ground-types like Ting-Lu and Donphan also benefit from Volcarona ability to somewhat safely switch into offensive Water-types such as Inteleon and non-Brave Bird Quaquaval. Volcarona is walled by common Well-Baked Body users like Kingambit and Corviknight, so attackers like Quaquaval and Sandy Shocks are helpful for breaking through them.

Will-O-Wisp is preferred on the last slot to cripple physical attackers such as Garchomp and Quaquaval, which seek to exploit Volcarona's low Defense, but Volcarona can run Bug Buzz to threaten bulky phazers such as Ting-Lu and RegenVest Roaring Moon or Psychic to chunk Haze users such as Toxapex and Clodsire. Volcarona is completely walled by Well-Baked Body Steel-types such as Corviknight and Kingambit; thus, partners such as Sandy Shocks help to eliminate them in the early-game. While Giga Drain can hurt Garganacl, Volcarona's massive weakness to Rock means it doesn't want to stay into Garganacl at all; thus, teammates such as Magic Guard Quaquaval are particularly helpful.

Fire Blast can be used over Fiery Dance for more immediate damage output. Giga Drain deals with Water- and Ground-types, most notably Swampert, Gastrodon, and Rotom-Wash. Bug Buzz can be used instead for Volcarona to overwhelm types like Dragon, Dark, and Psychic with Quiver Dance-boosted STAB attacks. Hidden Power Ground hits Heatran, allowing Volcarona to break Steel's immunity-based defensive core that can otherwise give Bug teams problems. Alternatively, Psychic can be used to damage bulky Poison-types, like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, that can wall physical attackers like Heracross and Buzzwole. These physical attackers, in addition to Lokix and Scizor, are able to break through specially defensive walls, like Chansey and Mantine, that Volcarona struggles against.

Psychic allows Volcarona to pressure Fighting and Poison teams, especially after one Quiver Dance, which lets Volcarona outspeed and beat Keldeo, Glimmora, and Crobat. Similarly, Giga Drain does the same to Water and Ground teams after one Quiver Dance, threatening Tapu Fini, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Bug Buzz covers the Psychic and Dark matchups very well and allows it to hit Roaring Moon, Ting-Lu, and Latias, which would otherwise be a challenge to deal with. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Volcarona from being worn down by entry hazards, most notably Stealth Rock, which would otherwise stop Volcarona from being able to set up safely. Psychium Z lets Volcarona OHKO Toxapex with a +1 Shattered Psyche and beat otherwise troublesome threats like +1 Kommo-o, Iron Hands, and Clodsire. Cinderace and Mega Charizard X are especially good partners due to their ability to break through special walls such as Blissey, Clodsire, and Galarian Slowking with relative ease. Entry hazard removers such as Torkoal, Rotom-H, and Court Change Cinderace are near necessities if Volcarona is running Psychium Z. Torkoal and Rotom-H can also provide excellent utility in the form of Stealth Rock and dual screens, respectively, to help Volcarona sweep more easily. Volcanion is also an excellent partner for Volcarona that, thanks to its Water immunity, can act as a strong pivot into Pokemon like Azumarill and Mantine, which could revenge kill it or clear Quiver Dance boosts with Haze.</p>"

Earthquake does heavy damage against Electric-types such as Zeraora and Tapu Koko as well as against Poison-types like Toxapex and Clodsire. Poison Jab is able to pressure Grass- and Fairy-types that Rock teams struggle to deal with, being able to OHKO Tapu Bulu and Whimsicott as well as deal high amounts of damage to Azumarill and Tapu Lele. Choice Scarf allows Terrakion to be an amazing revenge killer, outspeeding threats like Mega Lopunny and Zeraora. Terrakion pairs well with Shuckle, as its Stealth Rock and Sticky Web support allows Terrakion to net more KOs and outspeed faster Pokemon like Regieleki, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and Adamant Barraskewda under rain. Terrakion also pairs well with Mega Diancie, which softens the likes of Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Toxapex for Terrakion thanks to its coverage. Alolan Golem helps Terrakion with the Steel matchup by trapping Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Celesteela with its ability Magnet Pull. Nihilego is able to help with the Fairy matchup with Sludge Wave dealing big damage to Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Clefable. Tyranitar helps Terrakion by setting up sand, which boosts Terrakion's Special Defense stat, allowing it to survive Surf from Choice Scarf Greninja and Dazzling Gleam from Tapu Koko.

Tornadus-T has a very poor matchup against Electric-types, so Pokemon that can deal with them, such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, are must-haves.

It can be used over Thundurus-T due to its higher Speed, outspeeding foes like Iron Moth, Keldeo, and Enamorus. Thunderbolt helps against the plethora of bulky Water- and Flying-types, 2HKOing Celesteela, Tapu Fini, and Slowbro. It can also threaten 2HKOs on bulky foes like Magic Guard Clefable and Mega Sableye at +2. Focus Blast helps against the tier's numerous Dark- and Steel-types, OHKOing Tyranitar and Excadrill and having good odds to OHKO Hydreigon and Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Ice hits Dragon-types that resist Thunderbolt, 2HKOing Latios, Mega Altaria, and unboosted Mega Latias at +2, its also more spammable against Grass-types than Focus Blast and can hit Pokemon like Amoonguss super effectively. Psychic is an alternative that helps against Poison- and Fighting-types, 2HKOing foes like Choice Band Iron Hands, Amoonguss, and Buzzwole. Fightinium Z can provide Thundurus a way to OHKO targets like Mega Tyranitar, help break through neutral targets like Gastrodon, and bypass Focus Blast's accuracy. Thundurus can have a hard time breaking through specially defensive Pokemon, notably Mega Latias, which can set up on it even if Thundurus uses Nasty Plot, as well as Tapu Bulu and Mega Venusaur when lacking Hidden Power Ice or Psychic; it pairs well with other offensive Pokemon like Hydreigon, Cinderace, and Ceruledge that can threaten these foes. In return, Thundurus can help to deal with their checks like bulky Scizor, Tapu Fini, and Iron Hands. Thundurus can pair well with pivots like Cinderace, which can bring it in against Water-types it threatens like Tapu Fini as well as help against Pokemon that wall it like Mega Venusaur. Due to Thundurus's Stealth Rock weakness that can make it harder for it sweep, hazard removers like Tapu Fini, Excadrill, and Hydreigon make for good teammates. Thundurus can also pair well with entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Mega Tyranitar, and Skarmory, which can help it to guarantee an OHKO on foes like Hydreigon and Tyranitar. In return, Thundurus can threaten out common hazard removal options like Tapu Fini and Excadrill, and it can even set up on some of them like Tapu Fini. Thundurus is very prone to getting revenge killed by faster foes like Mega Aerodactyl, Cinderace, and Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos, so it pairs well with bulky partners like Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Clefable.</p>"

Thundurus appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Empoleon, Garchomp, and Sandy Shocks, as the chip damage from hazards allows Thundurus to secure OHKOs against Pokemon such as Hisuian Goodra and specially defensive Garchomp after a Nasty Plot, as well as Kommo-o, Iron Moth, and Volt Absorb Empoleon. Thundurus's poor bulk means it's OHKOed by most Pokemon faster than it, so walls such as Corviknight and Manaphy that can take hits for it and pivot it in are appreciated.

Modest is usable with Choice Specs, allowing Thundurus-T to outspeed up to Jolly Baxcalibur and Great Tusk, and the extra power can be handy in some situations, such as usually 2HKOing specially defensive Clodsire with Tera Blast Flying.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Thundurus-T is perfectly fine with its base typing, it makes such good use of Terastallization that it'll often Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying makes Tera Blast a powerful STAB option with very few resistances while gaining no extra weaknesses thanks to Volt Absorb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Not only does Tera Ice give Thundurus-T powerful coverage against Ground- and Grass-types like Landorus-T and Wo-Chien, it also gives an important resistance to Iron Bundle's and Chien-Pao's Ice-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a fantastic defensive option, turning Thundurus-T into an excellent check against Regieleki and Zapdos while still giving it a good coverage option against Landorus-T. However, it still retains Thundurus-T's weakness to Freeze-Dry.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs versus Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Specs makes Thundurus-T difficult to wall without an extremely sturdy special wall, with even Pokemon like Clodsire and Cresselia at risk of a 2HKO. Choice Scarf, on the other hand, allows Thundurus-T to double as a good revenge killer, outspeeding major threats like Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: While Thundurus-T isn't known for its bulk, Volt Absorb means Assault Vest makes Thundurus-T more effective at checking other Electric-types, especially when using bulkier EV spreads.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Bulkier EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>20 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 228 Spe with Timid</strong>: This Assault Vest spread outspeeds both Urshifu formes and takes 70% maximum from Timid Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry without sacrificing power.</p> </li> <li> <p>188 SpA / 68 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid or Modest**: This spread is optimized for Assault Vest, letting Thundurus-T survive Timid Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry without Terastallizing.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>0-3 Attack IV</strong>: Foes that commonly run Foul Play such as Amoonguss and Rotom-W have more powerful moves to use against Thundurus-T, but there's no drawback to minimizing Foul Play's damage.</li> </ul>"

Sitrus Berry is still a good option, though allowing Thundurus-T to instantly restore some health after being hit by Ruination, as long as its maximum HP is an even number.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: When paired with Tera Water, Substitute lets Thundurus-T set up on Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Blast</strong>: Focus Blast's unreliability makes it hard to recommend for most teams, but it's the only way Thundurus-T will break through Hisuian Goodra without Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Giving up coverage is risky, but Taunt shuts down a lot of defensive counterplay against Thundurus-T such as Whirlwind Ting-Lu and Toxic Clodsire.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Thundurus-T's typing is totally functional for sweeping and wallbreaking, but Terastallization makes it far harder to revenge kill thanks to Volt Absorb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying gives Thundurus-T a powerful STAB option, letting it cleave through specially bulky foes, like Water Absorb Clodsire, particularly easily.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: While Tera Water does leave Thundurus-T vulnerable to certain Pokemon, such as Water Absorb Clodsire and Hisuian Goodra, it's a fantastic defensive Tera type that lets it deal with other common Electric-types that Terastallize like Regieleki and Zapdos.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice is a great offensive option, letting Thundurus-T cleave through most Ground-types that aren't weak to Grass such as Landorus-T and Clodsire.

Landorus's preferred ability, Sheer Force, in conjunction with Life Orb raises its offensive potency to great heights, allowing it to 2HKO nearly every wall in the metagame, including Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Corviknight with Focus Blast. Sludge Bomb hits Grass-types like Rotom-C and Breloom as well as easing the Fairy matchup alongside Iron Treads and Clodsire, while Psychic threatens Urshifu-R and Air Balloon Glimmora and pops Gholdengo's Air Balloon, as Landorus is walled by it otherwise. Nasty Plot renders Landorus completely unwallable, notably letting it OHKO Corviknight. Alternatively, Rock Slide can be used to catch Volcarona, Zapdos, and Frosmoth off guard; however, it forces Landorus to use the suboptimal Naive nature and should only be used if teammates don't have answers for the listed targets. Substitute is a great option on Landorus because of the amount of switches it forces as well as making Kingambit's Sucker Punch easier to outplay.</p> <p>Landorus appreciates Water Absorb Clodsire and Storm Drain Gastrodon switching into Water-type Pokemon like Barraskewda, Walking Wake, and Basculegion-F. Choice Scarf Great Tusk threatens Pokemon with Ice-type coverage like Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Greninja. Iron Treads provides support in the Fairy matchup and provides pivoting with Volt Switch, luring switch-ins like Corviknight and Volcarona for Landorus to take advantage of. Furthermore, Iron Treads removes Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin and enhances Landorus's wallbreaking with Knock Off, removing recovery items like Leftovers and Black Sludge from Rotom-W and Amoonguss. Additionally, Choice Scarf Iron Treads is a great asset in the Fairy matchup and threatens Ice-types like Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Sandy Shocks is a great teammate in the Flying and Water matchups, providing Gravity support and additional pivoting with Volt Switch. Quagsire is able to check Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur as well as providing entry hazards and chip damage with Toxic. Ting-Lu provides entry hazards and phazing to wear down the opponent's team for Landorus and appreciates the removal of Fighting-types. Ursaluna can switch into Ghost-type moves from faster opponents like Dragapult, Flutter Mane, and Hisuian Zoroark as well as aiding in heavily denting teams alongside Landorus.

          "description": "<p>Access to Sheer Force, a variety of coverage moves, and a phenomenal Speed tier thanks to Choice Scarf make Landorus an elite revenge killer on Ground teams, taking out Choice Specs Greninja and all Ogerpon formes after entry hazard damage. Focus Blast tears apart Dark-types and Ground-immune Steel-type Pokemon such as Chien-Pao, Hydreigon, and Orthworm. Psychic makes the Fighting matchup a lot easier, OHKOing Great Tusk, Urshifu-R, and Iron Valiant, as well as taking out Galarian Weezing after Stealth Rock damage, making the Poison matchup extremely one sided. Sludge Bomb aids in the Fairy matchup, OHKOing Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Azumarill, and helps greatly against Grass-type Pokemon that Ground-type teams would otherwise struggle to break, taking out prominent threats such as Breloom and Hisuian Lilligant. U-turn is a great pivot option for Landorus, gaining momentum by scaring out Pokemon it threatens while inflicting damage on the replacement and getting switch initiative.</p> <p>Landorus cowers in fear at the thought of a single snowflake, which is why Quagsire is a great teammate for it. Quagsire is able to stand up to terrifying Ice-type move users such as Swords Dance Chien-Pao, Swords Dance Urshifu-R, Azumarill without Trailblaze, and Baxcalibur, as well as providing entry hazard support via Spikes and Stealth Rock and spreading Toxic to soften foes up for Landorus. Iron Treads forms a wonderful core with Landorus as well, switching in on foes that attack with Ice-type moves, such as Articuno, Frosmoth, and Alolan Ninetales, and hitting back with a very powerful Heavy Slam or Iron Head. Iron Treads can also remove Stealth Rock via Rapid Spin and remove items via Knock Off, increasing Landorus's longevity and wallbreaking capabilities. Ice Spinner is also an option to take out opposing Landorus and Gliscor. In turn, Landorus can switch into a weakened Ogerpon-H as well as Ground- and Fighting-type attacks that would make quick work of Iron Treads. Landorus also appreciates Pokemon such as Water Absorb Clodsire and Storm Drain Gastrodon, as they can switch in to Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Walking Wake, Barraskewda, and Basculegion-F. Clodsire is a very good special wall, while Gastrodon takes neutral damage from Ice Beam as well as walling Choice Scarf Greninja and providing a myriad of hazard support. Both Ursaluna and Ursaluna-B complement Landorus nicely, as they are able to switch into Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon that Landorus would otherwise struggle against, such as Flutter Mane and Air Balloon Gholdengo. Ursaluna-B is also capable of picking off weakened Dark-type Pokemon such as Kingambit, Greninja, and Chien-Pao with Vacuum Wave. In turn, Landorus can switch in on the Fighting-type attacks that would trouble Ursaluna and Ursaluna-B, and threatening the foe with Psychic. Gliscor is another great teammate for Landorus, as it is able to whittle down opponents via Knock Off and Toxic. Mamoswine is able to take down the Flying-type Pokemon that Landorus would otherwise be ineffective against and can also make use of its Thick Fat ability to tank some additional Ice-type moves. Sandy Shocks not only can set hazards but also can pivot around with Volt Switch, allowing Landorus to come in on an easy target.</p>"

Sludge Wave hits Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Celebi as well as other Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Clefable, easing the Fairy and Grass matchups due to unresisted coverage. Focus Blast breaks through Kyurem, Ting-Lu, and Ferrothorn. Rock Polish enables Landorus as a late-game cleaner, shutting down revenge killing abilities from faster foes like Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and Greninja, while Nasty Plot allows Landorus to easily break past the likes of Blissey and Mega Sableye and become terrifying with Gravity-aided Earth Power spam. Rock Slide is another option to hit Volcarona, as it is dangerous once set up, as well as Mantine, Zapdos, and Araquanid; however, using it is very situational and forces Landorus to use an unpreferred nature. Gravity allows Landorus to ease the Flying and Steel matchups and easily spam Earth Power, increasing its potential to new heights and also supporting its teammates like Choice Band Sand Rush Excadrill. Gastrodon is a great teammate due to its ability to soak up Water-type moves from foes like Barraskewda and Mega Swampert, while Gastrodon appreciates Landorus's ability to threaten Grass-types with Sludge Wave. Mamoswine is heavily valued as a sponge for Ice-type moves due to its ability Thick Fat, taking on SubRoost Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales. In return, Mamoswine cleans up Flying teams once Landorus deals with Celesteela, Corviknight, or Skarmory. Choice Scarf or Bulk Up Great Tusk forms a great wallbreaking core, taking out threats like Triple Axel Mega Lopunny and Dragonite, while also appreciating Gravity support. Clodsire provides entry hazards to chip down walls for Landorus, switches into revenge killers like Meowscarada and Tapu Koko, and counters Volcarona with Unaware so Landorus doesn't need to use Rock Slide. Mega Steelix is valued in the Ice and Fairy matchups, taking on Alolan Ninetales, Tapu Koko, Azumarill, and Weavile. Mega Garchomp and Garchomp threaten specially defensive walls like Slowking, Blissey, and Mantine while also providing a Water neutrality with decent defensive stats.</p>"

This, combined with its typing, natural bulk, and exceptional ability in Intimidate, makes it a good offensive pivot. U-turn is useful for generating momentum and bringing in teammates safely when the foe is forced to switch out. Stone Edge hits Flying-types such as Enamorus, Zapdos, Dragonite, and Moltres, notably providing good coverage alongside Earthquake. Grass Knot is crucial for hitting Great Tusk, which would otherwise comfortably take Landorus-T's physical attacks. It is also the best option for hitting Dondozo and Tera Water, Curse, or Iron Defense Garganacl. Tera Ground can be used to boost Landorus-T's already strong Earthquake, potentially helping it clean late-game when all Ground-immune foes have been removed. Tera Blast can be used alongside Tera Flying, as it still hits Great Tusk hard while also hitting Amoonguss and Zamazenta for super effective damage. It also guarantees an OHKO against Iron Valiant. Becoming pure Flying-type also lets Landorus-T potentially survive priority moves such as Aqua Jet from Hisuian Samurott in a pinch.</p> <p>Landorus-T fits well on balanced and bulky offense teams that appreciate speed control and the ability to generate momentum. Wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Enamorus appreciate being brought in safely with U-turn. Choice Specs Enamorus and Choice Specs Dragapult especially appreciate being in against certain Pokemon that commonly switch into Landorus-T, such as Great Tusk and defensive Zapdos. Offensive Zapdos can also take advantage of these Pokemon while forming a potent VoltTurn core with Landorus-T. Faster special attackers such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Enamorus are problematic for Landorus-T. Therefore, specially defensive Galarian Slowking is a solid teammate to help deal with them. It also consistently switches into Rotom-W, which takes very little from Landorus-T's attacks. Furthermore, Galarian Slowking forms a momentum-generating core with Landorus-T and provides Future Sight support, making Landorus-T more difficult for foes to switch into. Great Tusk forms a strong core alongside Landorus-T to deal with physical attackers such as Sneasler and Cinderace that tend to be overwhelming for one of them to take on alone. Notably, Landorus-T outspeeds Cinderace and can threaten it before getting burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p>"
        },
        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>Defensive Landorus-T is a reliable pivot on balance and bulky offensive teams, leveraging its good typing, bulk, and Intimidate to serve as a roadblock to common threats such as Kingambit, Sneasler, and Great Tusk without Ice Spinner. Its Spikes immunity and neutrality to Stealth Rock allow it to comfortably switch in and check the aforementioned Pokemon. Landorus-T is also an excellent Stealth Rock user thanks to its good matchups against key entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Cinderace. U-turn enables Landorus-T to pivot out of bad matchups and safely bring one of its teammates in. The last slot is flexible depending on a team's needs. Grass Knot deals high damage to Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Tera Water Garganacl, which could otherwise switch in and set up on Landorus-T, and it is useful to open up for teammates such as Kingambit to reliably clean late-game. However, Grass Knot also leaves Landorus-T quite exploitable to key Flying-types and Tera Flying Pokemon such as Moltres, Dragonite, and Kingambit, which can either cripple it with status or setup on it. Taunt is a useful utility move to stop entry hazards from Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and to prevent Enamorus-T and Garganacl from setting up. Finally, Smack Down deals decent damage to Landorus-T's common Flying-type switch-ins as well as Rotom-W, either leaving them vulnerable to Earthquake or forcing them out. 4 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Jolly Kingambit and deal good damage to it with Earthquake. As Landorus-T is a support Pokemon, it will often be more valuable to use Terastallization with other teammates. However, Tera Water lets Landorus-T resist Ice- and Water-type moves from Pokemon such as Greninja, Alolan Ninetales, and Walking Wake. Alternatively, Tera Ghost can be run to spinblock against Great Tusk while still maintaining its positive matchup against Fighting-type moves. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item, as it forces valuable chip damage on key targets such as Sneasler, Great Tusk, and Kingambit. Leftovers can also be run to grant Landorus-T a bit more longevity. Landorus-T typically fits quite well on teams with multiple pivot move users such as Sneasler, Cinderace, and Zapdos, as they can continually apply pressure to each other's counters, especially if entry hazards are up. Zapdos and Rotom-W have the added benefit of having good matchups against Flying-types, which Landorus-T struggles with. Galarian Slowking matches up quite well against strong special attackers such as Zapdos and Enamorus and appreciates Landorus-T's ability to pivot into physical attackers such Great Tusk, Kingambit, and Swords Dance Iron Valiant. Spikes setters such as Ting-Lu and Hisuian Samurott form a potent hazard-stacking core with Landorus-T and can pressure entry hazard removers such as Cinderace and Great Tusk. Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, and Choice Band Hoopa greatly benefit from Landorus-T's U-turn support, as it can position them to fire off their powerful attacks with little risk and can wear the opposing Pokemon down over time to be in their KO range. Landorus-T is quite exploitable by fast Water-types such as Battle Bond Greninja and Walking Wake; bulky Water-types such as Toxapex can help alleviate the pressure from these Pokemon. Landorus-T's ability to lure and overwhelm physical walls such as Dondozo and Great Tusk with Grass Knot is greatly appreciated by various physical setup sweepers such as Kingambit, Swords Dance Iron Valiant, and Hisuian Samurott.</p>"

        "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
          "description": "<p>This more offensive set allows Landorus-T to take advantage of its varied movepool and high attacking stats to cause headaches to common teambuilding structures in SV OU while still retaining its usefulness as an Intimidate pivot; as such, Substitute is essential mostly to ease prediction, but it can also catch unsuspecting players trying to use a status move on Landorus-T, such as Moltres's Will-O-Wisp or Amoonguss's Spore. Smack Down is important to let Landorus-T threaten a KO on Corviknight, Rotom-W, Zapdos, Moltres, or even Enamorus the next turn with Earthquake, and even if the opponent switches out, Earthquake is likely to strongly dent their team, unless they're running more than one Pokemon immune to Ground. Stone Edge, on top of its great coverage with Earthquake, provides a more immediate hit on Zapdos, which is useful for more offensive variants that outpace Landorus-T, as these force Landorus-T to take damage before being able to KO Zapdos. Stone Edge also OHKOes Moltres and Enamorus, but it comes at the price of being unable to dent Corviknight or Rotom-W, which is undesirable. Grass Knot rounds out Landorus-T's coverage as a way to do massive damage to Great Tusk; Garganacl after Iron Defense, Curse, or Tera Water; and Dondozo. Tera Water allows Landorus-T to turn its Ice and Water weaknesses around and thus better check Ice Spinner Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. A Naive nature is best alongside maximum Speed investment to make sure Landorus-T outpaces Great Tusk and most defensive Zapdos variants and Speed ties with other Landorus-T. 24 Special Attack EVs allow Landorus-T to 2HKO physically defensive Garganacl with Grass Knot if its Leftovers has been removed, but maximum Attack EVs can also be run instead.</p> <p>Substitute Landorus-T is commonly found on bulky offense and balance teams, bringing the gap between a wallbreaker and a bulky pivot. To aid its wallbreaking efforts, however, Landorus-T strongly appreciates Spikes support from the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu to help wear down its switch-ins, as Landorus-T commonly causes the opponent to switch around, and, most importantly, put Great Tusk in range of going down to a single Grass Knot. While Landorus-T has great coverage for most of the tier and is a strong wallbreaker against most balance and bulky offense teams, there are still a few Pokemon that it gives free switches to. Iron Defense Zamazenta doesn't take much from Landorus-T's Earthquake, especially with Dauntless Shield activated, and can use Landorus-T as setup fodder with Iron Defense. Physically defensive variants of Galarian Slowking, Moltres, and Zapdos help remedy this, and the former three also help bring Landorus-T for wallbreaking opportunities via Chilly Reception, Volt Switch, and U-turn. Calm Mind Cresselia is another dangerous setup sweeper that Landorus-T allows to come in for free. Kingambit and Encore Tera Dark or Steel Iron Valiant pose great answers to it while also appreciating Landorus-T spreading damage around for them to clean up, especially if an unsuspecting Great Tusk is taken out via Grass Knot. Great Tusk itself is also a great partner, as going with a more offensive set on Landorus-T makes it less reliable of a check to physical attackers, which Great Tusk helps handle; in return Great Tusk appreciates opposing Great Tusk being taken out via Grass Knot, making it easier for defensive variants to win the hazard game and offensive variants to sweep or dent the opposing team.</p>"

Rock Tomb and Sludge Bomb are used to whittle down Earth Eater Fire-types like Skeledirge and defensive Fairy-types like Scream Tail, respectively, with Rock Tomb being able to heavily damage Zapdos. Alternatively, Smack Down can be used to threaten switch-ins like Corviknight, (add comma) while Sandsear Storm can burn pivots like Garchomp.

RegenVest Landorus-T can form a powerful defensive VoltTurn core with physically defensive pivots like Corviknight and Iron Treads. Additionally, fast revenge killers and late-game sweepers like Chien-Pao and Hisuian Electrode benefit from slow pivots that can get them on the field without having to absorb an attack themselves.

It differentiates itself from Garchomp as a Fire-type answer with its immunity to Will-O-Wisp as well as access to U-turn and Smack Down, allowing it to generate momentum and pressure Corviknight and other Flying-types. It can further capitalize on this added offensive presence with Swords Dance, especially if it has activated Well-Baked Body beforehand. Alternatively, running Hammer Arm over Smack Down allows it to still beat Earth Eater Heatran by itself and potentially hit Earth Eater Iron Treads hard on the switch. As a Fire-type answer, it makes a fantastic partner for Corviknight, which also appreciates its Fighting resistance to help against Pokemon like Slither Wing and in turn can handle many strong wallbreakers such as Roaring Moon and Chien-Pao that Landorus-T lacks the bulk and recovery to answer. Landorus-T also benefits RegenVest Pokemon such as Hisuian Goodra and Meloetta by preventing them from getting overwhelmed by strong Fire-type attacks and, in the case of Hisuian Goodra, helping against Ground-types such as Sandy Shocks and Landorus, while in return they handle the many special attackers in the tier. Water-immune partners, such as Desolate Land Heatran and Ceruledge, make good teammates for Landorus-T as well.

U-turn takes advantage of the switches Landorus-T forces, allowing it to pivot out of walls that come in on it such as Corviknight and Mega Venusaur. Similarly, Knock Off cripples some of the bulky Pokemon it invites in, like Porygon2 and Ferrothorn, by removing their items. Stone Edge notably hits Kyurem the hardest and is Landorus-T's best move versus Flying-types like Zapdos and Pelipper. Alternatively, Explosion lets Landorus-T score a surprise KO against an offensive threat it normally cannot OHKO, such as Keldeo or Mega Lopunny. Special wallbreakers like Galarian Moltres, Tornadus-T, and Mega Charizard Y are great partners to deal with the aforementioned physical walls Landorus-T draws in.

Rocky Helmet punishes foes like Koraidon and Zacian-C for attacking by potentially putting them into range of attacks such as +2 Arceus's Extreme Speed, Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, and Giratina-O's Shadow Sneak. Tera Water grants a resistance to attacks such as Koraidon's Flare Blitz and Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade, while Tera Fairy grants an immunity to Dragon, denying Scale Shot Koraidon a Speed boost and less importantly blocking moves like Miraidon's Draco Meteor. Landorus-T best fits on bulky offense teams, where it can support offensive teammates such as Calyrex-S, Zacian-C, Arceus, and Miraidon by setting Stealth Rock, safely pivoting them in to wallbreak, and checking revenge killers like Zacian-C and Choice Scarf Koraidon. Ting-Lu checks Pokemon like Calyrex-S, Miraidon, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground for Landorus-T and provides its offensive teammates with Spikes support; Landorus-T checks strong physical attackers for it in return.

Teammates like Koraidon, Giratina-O, and Eternatus deter Kyogre from using its STAB moves to an extent, but Kyogre can still force you to predict whether it will use a Water-type move or Ice Beam in the face of Landorus-T.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Heavy-Duty Boots Kyurem is an incredibly powerful Pokemon with very few switch-ins, leveraging its hefty natural bulk and monstrous offensive stats to threaten a large portion of the tier with its perfect coverage. Both Ice Beam and Freeze-Dry are fantastic STAB options, with the raw power of Ice Beam supplemented by Freeze-Dry's super effective coverage into bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo. Earth Power is a great coverage move that allows Kyurem to hit common switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Heatran, and Draco Meteor rounds out the set with a powerful nuke that tears through neutral targets like Darkrai, Deoxys-S, and Terastallized Ting-Lu while securing a notable OHKO on Gouging Fire. Scale Shot is a weaker alternative that boosts Kyurem's Speed to patch up its middling Speed tier and thwart revenge killing attempts by otherwise faster Pokemon such as Dragapult and Zamazenta. It also targets special walls like Blissey on their frailer Defense and hits Volcarona hard to prevent it from using Kyurem as setup fodder. A Naive nature is selected for a mixed set with Scale Shot in order to still survive Iron Boulder's Mighty Cleave from full HP. A Hasty nature can also be considered for a better matchup into Volcarona and to avoid an OHKO from Iron Valiant's Moonblast. Tera Ice synergizes with Kyurem's double Ice-type STAB attacks to blast holes through teams, allowing it to 2HKO both physically defensive Clefable and Corviknight with Ice Beam. Tera Ground can be used instead to change Kyurem's defensive profile entirely while giving it a STAB boost to Earth Power, securing crucial 2HKOs on both Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge along with dropping offensive Gholdengo in a single hit. Additionally, both Tera types drop Kyurem's weaknesses to Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult and Enamorus, with Tera Ground also removing its Fighting- and Rock-type weaknesses to block revenge killing attempts from Zamazenta and Iron Boulder.</p> <p>Kyurem is a perfect fit for entry hazard-stacking teams that opt to neglect removal in favor of putting hazards up on both sides, as Heavy-Duty Boots allows Kyurem to switch in freely, and its lack of power from no boosting item is made up for by switch-ins being forced to take chip damage on entry. Good defensive hazard setters that pair well with Kyurem include Skarmory and Gliscor with their Steel- and Fighting-type resistances, respectively. Faster teammates are also appreciated to help cover for Kyurem's mediocre Speed, with fast Knock Off users such as Meowscarada and Weavile being great picks for balance teams and Iron Boulder as a good pairing on more offensive builds. Another partner that works particularly well is Knock Off Clefable, which switches into Dragon- and Fighting-type attacks from Dragapult and Zamazenta and invites in Kyurem's defensive checks like Galarian Slowking, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Air Balloon Heatran to remove their items, making them more susceptible to chip damage and allowing Kyurem to hit the latter two with Earth Power. Galarian Slowking itself is a bulky pivot that has great synergy with Kyurem, as it stifles revenge killing attempts with Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from checks like Iron Valiant and Enamorus, and it can not only can bring in Kyurem freely with Chilly Reception but also sets up snow to make it significantly harder to revenge kill. Offensively, Kyurem pairs well with threats that can force in walls weak to it such as Gliscor, Skarmory, and Great Tusk, making Kingambit a natural partner.</p>"

Draco Meteor is Kyurem's most powerful move, notably wearing down typical switch-ins like Mega Sableye and Volcarona. Freeze-Dry is highly effective in the Water matchup by answering would-be checks like Swampert, Gastrodon, and Slowking. Focus Blast catches Ferrothorn and Tyranitar off guard should they expect a STAB move, while Earth Power hits Alolan Muk, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran for more damage. Mega Altaria is heavily appreciated as an answer to Dragon-types like Kommo-o, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. Garchomp provides entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes to ease Kyurem's wallbreaking. Latias checks Fighting-types such as Iron Hands, Galarian Zapdos, and Terrakion, is able to replenish Kyurem's health with Healing Wish, and removes troublesome entry hazards—especially Stealth Rock, given Kyurem's Rock weakness—with Defog. Dragalge sets up Toxic Spikes and checks Fairy-types like Tapu Koko and Clefable. Kommo-o checks Steel-types like Heatran and defensive Celesteela and blocks attempts to set hazards with Taunt.</p>"

Kyurem's good bulk and typing also allow it to function as a defensive pivot, consistently checking threats like Heatran, Rotom-W, and Rillaboom. Moreover, it shrugs a hit from and beats the likes of Galarian Zapdos and Urshifu-R one-on-one if using a Chople Berry. Freeze-Dry lands a strong hit on Water-types like Toxapex and Gastrodon, turning Kyurem into a valuable asset in that matchup. Alongside it, Earth Power grants Kyurem near-perfect neutral coverage by nailing Steel- and Fire-types such as Magnezone and Skeledirge. The given EV spread allows Kyurem's Substitute to live one Seismic Toss from Blissey. Alolan Ninetales provides Snow and Aurora Veil support, bolstering Kyurem's defensive utility while preventing Celesteela and Heatran from breaking its Substitute. Defensive Cloyster is able to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, set up Spikes to help Kyurem stallbreak more easily, and switch into physical Steel-type attacks from Mega Scizor and Melmetal. Similarly, Piloswine lays down Stealth Rock and deals with Fire- and Rock-types that Kyurem loses to, such as Volcarona and Mega Diancie. Setup sweepers like Swords Dance Weavile and Shell Smash Cloyster greatly appreciate Kyurem wearing down walls so they can clean up late-game.</p>"

V-create threatens to OHKO Steel-types like Mega Steelix, which can otherwise scout Kyurem-B's move choice and heal off about half of the damage with Regenerator. U-turn offers dangerous teammates like Mega Mewtwo X a safe window to switch in if Kyurem-B can't secure a KO, and it can be used early-game to scout for potential Fur Coat switch-ins. Kyurem-B fits best on balance teams that can grant it opportunities through pivoting and can make room for counterplay against the few things it can't instantly get past, such as Arceus-Poison. Kyurem-B's lack of recovery and weakness to Rock mean Stone Axe is a major pain, so multiple entry hazard removers like Miraidon, Mega Steelix, and Primal Kyogre are recommended; the latter two also function as slow pivots, which Kyurem-B also appreciates. Fur Coat Arceus formes not weak to Kyurem-B's attacks, such as Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Fairy, also aren't afraid of it when healthy; as a result, it appreciates an ally that can block their Strength Sap, such as a Magic Bounce user like Mega Audino, significantly cutting into their longevity. A faster offensive teammate like Mega Mewtwo X or Deoxys-A is recommended to clean weakened teams, as Kyurem-B's poor Speed inhibits it in this regard. Imposter-proof Kyurem-B with a Fur Coat user not weak to its attacks, like Arceus-Poison or Arceus-Fairy.</p>"

Hydro Pump is preferred due to its incredible power, giving Keldeo solid odds to 2HKO special walls like Celesteela and Jirachi and guaranteeing an OHKO on offensive threats like Enamorus and Thundurus-T. Alternatively, Surf can be used for its better accuracy, though it significantly hurts Keldeo's damage output against the aforementioned Pokemon. Secret Sword hits the weaker Defense of special walls like Gastrodon and Chansey while also hitting Pokemon that could pivot into Water-type attacks like Volcanion and Hisuian Goodra. Flip Turn allows Keldeo to maintain momentum and switch out of bad matchups like Slowbro and Mega Latias. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to cripple these checks instead. Hidden Power Ice is used in the final slot to hit many Pokemon that resist its STAB combination like Salamence, Latios, and Mega Altaria for super effective damage. Focus Blast can be used instead to deal massive damage to neutral targets like Rotom-W and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Choice Specs Keldeo invites in Pokemon that resist its STAB combination such as Slowking, Mega Latias, and Amoonguss. It therefore pairs well with teammates that can take advantage of these switch-ins such as Bisharp and Ceruledge for the former two and Iron Moth for the latter. Additionally, it can take advantage of Future Sight support from Slowbro or Slowking to limit the ability of Poison-types like Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur to switch in. Pursuit from Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and Scizor is also helpful for removing Psychic-type checks to Keldeo like Slowbro and Slowking. Keldeo also appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Excadrill and Ting-Lu to push checks like Tapu Fini and Mega Venusaur into range for Hydro Pump to 2HKO. Finally, Keldeo struggles against faster offensive threats like Mega Latias and thus pairs well with partners like Celesteela that can switch into these threats.</p>"

Scald is usually chosen because of its high PP and burn chance, allowing Keldeo to slowly wear down checks like Mega Venusaur while crippling physical attackers like Iron Hands, Tapu Bulu, and Salamence. Scald is especially potent in tandem with Substitute and Leftovers, as it allows Keldeo to set up on many defensive Pokemon that struggle to break its Substitute like Slowking, Celesteela, and Gastrodon lacking Earthquake while dodging status and Leech Seed. Alternatively, Hydro Pump in combination with Waterium Z allows Keldeo to blow past common answers to itself such as Mega Venusaur, Tapu Fini, and Slowbro if they are weakened. When using Hydro Pump, Taunt is used over Substitute to prevent Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Unaware Clefable from recovering their HP, though Keldeo must be wary of moves like Giga Drain and Moonblast in return. Secret Sword hits the lower Defense of many common checks to special attackers like Blissey and Gastrodon. Calm Mind Keldeo fits best on balance and bulky offense which appreciate its ability to effectively take on defensive team styles. Keldeo is threatened out by faster offensive Pokemon that can hit it super effectively like Latios and Mega Latias if it does not have a Substitute up. Therefore, it pairs well with Pokemon that can switch into them like Celesteela and Scizor. They are also valuable for their ability to switch into checks to Keldeo like Tapu Fini and Mega Venusaur.

After Battle Bond activates, Greninja can outpace threats that are already considered very fast, including Choice Scarfers like Enamorus and Sneasler and Booster Energy users like Iron Valiant, Walking Wake, and Iron Moth. Hydro Pump is extremely powerful, always OHKOing uninvested Kingambit after Battle Bond activates and having a significant chance to OHKO it with just Tera Water while at worst 2HKOing much of the tier with both Battle Bond and Tera Water active, but Surf is a more consistent alternative; Greninja will need to rely more on entry hazard support to secure OHKOs against threats like the aforementioned Kingambit, but it is still more than capable of OHKOing many offensive threats with Battle Bond and Tera Water active. Grass Knot rounds out Greninja's coverage by OHKOing Tera Water Garganacl and opposing Greninja with Battle Bond active, having a high chance to OHKO Hisuian Samurott after Stealth Rock even without Battle Bond active, and 2HKOing Dondozo. Water Shuriken can pick off weakened faster threats like +1 Iron Valiant, Unburden Sneasler, Choice Scarf Enamorus, and +1 Great Tusk, and in a pinch it can act as insurance against greatly weakened threats like Dragapult. With a Modest nature and rain support from Pelipper, it also OHKOes Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock with a Battle Bond Boost as long as it hits at least three times, which makes up for the loss in Speed from foregoing a Timid nature. Water Shuriken also helps deal with Kingambit's Sucker Punch, which can otherwise greatly threaten Greninja if it has been weakened or shed its Dark resistance with Tera Water. Ice Beam, on the other hand, reliably handles Water-resistant threats like Dragonite, Amoonguss, Rillaboom, Meowscarada, and Tera Grass Galarian Slowking.</p> <p>Battle Bond Greninja greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Hisuian Samurott to wear threats down over the course of a game; for instance, enabling it to KO Kingambit with Tera Water Surf and take out Amoonguss more easily once Battle Bond is already active. Moreover, the chip damage from entry hazards can help wear down faster threats like Booster Energy Iron Valiant Choice Scarf Enamorus, putting them into Water Shuriken range. In that vein, Gholdengo is another excellent teammate due to its ability to prevent hazard removal; it can also use its powerful STAB moves alongside Choice Specs or a Nasty Plot boost to wallbreak and wear down the opposing team, allowing Greninja to finish the job. Other powerful offensive threats like Iron Valiant and especially Kingambit greatly appreciate Battle Bond Greninja's ability to break past various threats like Corviknight, Dondozo, Great Tusk, Heatran, and Landorus-T to assist their late-game sweeps; in return, they can help weaken threats like Walking Wake and Dragonite. Kingambit in particular can handle threats like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Terastallized Galarian Slowking, which Greninja may struggle to muscle past. Lastly, Battle Bond Greninja is a natural fit on rain teams, as the boost from Pelipper's Drizzle alongside a Modest nature, Tera Water, and Battle Bond allows Greninja's Hydro Pump to accomplish ludicrous feats such as outright OHKOing specially defensive pivot Galarian Slowking, OHKOing Roaring Moon after Stealth Rock, and even 2HKOing Assault Vest Toxapex more reliably. Basculegion is another rain staple that synergizes well with Greninja, as one can weaken their shared checks like Rotom-W and Walking Wake to enable the other's sweep. Lastly, Zapdos offers rain teams an effective means of dealing with Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Tera Water Galarian Slowking, ensuring that Greninja doesn't have to waste precious turns attacking them and getting worn down by their attacks alongside Life Orb recoil.</p>"

          "description": "<p>When equipped with Choice Specs, Greninja becomes a potent wallbreaker thanks to its great coverage and Protean. Since Choice Specs ensures it only uses one attack per switch-in, even though Protean only activates once per switch-in, Greninja will have STAB every time it attacks. Hydro Pump is Greninja's most powerful move, pummeling both offensive and defensive Water-weak Pokemon like Cinderace, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk. Dark Pulse hits the likes of Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Hisuian Zoroark super effectively while also dealing the most damage to Toxapex and Rotom-W. Dark Pulse's flinch chance can also come in clutch against the aforementioned walls. Ice Beam eviscerates Amoonguss, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Dragon-types like Dragonite and Roaring Moon. Grass Knot can OHKO Dondozo, Garganacl, and Walking Wake after minor chip damage, and it deals good damage to lighter Water-types like Quaquaval and Azumarill. Alternatively, Spikes lets Greninja wear down checks like Toxapex while taking advantage of the switches it often forces. In addition, Greninja also beats common entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight, making Spikes easy to maintain. Tera Water further enhances Greninja's already powerful Hydro Pump to extreme levels, letting it OHKO Pokemon like Corviknight, Hatterene, and Unaware Clodsire. Meanwhile, Tera Dark lets Greninja 2HKO Toxapex and Rotom-W with Dark Pulse.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams as a menacing wallbreaker. Stealth Rock setters like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Glimmora are amazing for Spikes Greninja, as it can create a hazard-stacking core with them. Alternatively, these Pokemon can also let Greninja drop Spikes for Grass Knot, as they can set up hazards and Grass Knot overwhelming Dondozo and Walking Wake. Strong offensive Pokemon like Kingambit and mixed Iron Valiant make for excellent partners, as Greninja threatens their checks like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Garchomp for the former, and Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Clodsire for the latter.

It differentiates itself from Meowscarada due to its better matchup against other leads as well as entry hazard setters and removers such as Glimmora, Iron Treads, Garchomp, Toxic Spikes Iron Moth, and Court Change Cinderace. Taunt has various applications; it blocks Amoonguss's Spore, prevents entry hazards from the likes of Ting-Lu and leads like Glimmora and Iron Treads, stops Defog from Corviknight, and prevents setup from Pokemon Roaring Moon, Kingambit, and Tera Water Garganacl that attempt to exploit Greninja's relative passivity. Greninja can choose to run Toxic Spikes to punish offensive teams filled with setup sweepers like Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant better, but Ice Beam OHKOes Garchomp and dents Water-resistant Pokemon like Dragonite, Meowscarada, Dragapult, Tera Grass Glimmora, and Water Absorb Clodsire, especially if its Focus Sash is still intact for the former three. Focus Sash guarantees that Greninja can set at least one layer of entry hazards and works extremely well to safely put it into Torrent range, which allows Surf to OHKO Hisuian Zoroark and provides significant odds to OHKO Iron Valiant, one of the biggest threats to offense teams. Alternatively, Protean improves Ice Beam's damage and allows Greninja to block Volt Switch from Rotom-W, Iron Treads, and Sandy Shocks when using Spikes, maintaining offensive momentum. Tera Water boosts Greninja's Surf, notably netting the OHKO on specially defensive Garganacl and 2HKO on Tera Fairy Skeledirge with Torrent, as well as the 2HKO on Gholdengo and Corviknight after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Greninja is perfectly suited for hyper offense teams. Offensive teammates like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon put further pressure on entry hazard removers such as Corviknight, Iron Treads, and Great Tusk to maintain Greninja's Spikes throughout the game and enjoy Spikes chipping down their checks like Garganacl, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Dondozo. They also appreciate Spikes invalidating Focus Sash from Pokemon like Hisuian Zoroark, Ceruledge, and Meowscarada. Aside from possessing insane late-game potential themselves, Kingambit and Iron Moth particularly help against Meowscarada—one of the few leads that can easily beat Greninja—and Hatterene, which can freely switch into Greninja and reflect its Taunt and entry hazards with Magic Bounce, with Calm Mind variants using it as setup fodder as well. Kingambit in particular appreciates Greninja's tendency to faint early-game to accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts. Knock Off from Bulk Up Great Tusk and Swords Dance Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from walls like Dondozo, Slowking, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge, making them susceptible to Greninja's Spikes. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragon Dance Dragapult can spinblock the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch to keep Greninja's Spikes up; Gholdengo in particular does it exceptionally well by blocking Defog and Glimmora's Mortal Spin as well, and it has the added benefit of threatening Hatterene and crippling walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu with Choice item + Trick, making them more vulnerable to Greninja's entry hazards.</p>"

Surf, despite being weaker than Hydro Pump, is a solid option due to its reliability, while Hydro Pump is a stronger alternative despite its lower accuracy, as it allows Greninja to OHKO targets such as Mega Charizard Y under sun. Dark Pulse gives Greninja a strong neutral STAB move to hit common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Rotom-W, additionally wielding a nasty flinch chance to potentially break through them. Water Shuriken gives Greninja a priority option, crucial for revenge killing weakened targets that outspeed it like Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny, as well as getting the jump on other priority moves such as Weavile's Ice Shard and the aforementioned Mega Lopunny's Quick Attack. Ice Beam is Greninja's coverage move of choice, being its strongest option versus Pokemon like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Dragonite. Tera Water is the preferred Tera type, giving a significant boost to both of Greninja's Water-type STAB moves to potentially secure KOs on targets like Mega Charizard Y in sun and Tapu Lele after a Battle Bond activation with Surf. Greninja can also serve as a potent albeit niche wallbreaker on rain teams, with rain boosting the power of its Water-type STAB moves to ridiculous levels. This allows teammates like Mega Swampert and Zapdos to clean up the weakened defensive cores consisting of Pokemon like Rotom-W and Galarian Slowking. However, Greninja alone can struggle to break through sturdier Water-resistant foes like Tera Water Garganacl, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn, so teammates like Tapu Koko, Gholdengo, and Heatran that can capitalize on Greninja forcing these foes in function well as teammates on certain offensive compositions.</p>"

Gunk Shot decimates Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Koko. Ice Beam covers a plethora of Pokemon, including Tornadus-T, Dragapult, Kartana, and Landorus-T. Rock Slide deals with Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Aside from enabling Greninja to pivot, U-turn also provides coverage against Mega Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, and opposing Greninja. The Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO against Kartana with Ice Beam. Terastallizing is mainly used to improve its offensive capabilities; for instance, Tera Poison gives Gunk Shot significant odds to OHKO specially defensive Tera Grass Heatran, Clefable, and Tera Fairy Garganacl after Stealth Rock, while Tera Ice boosts Ice Beam to OHKO Dragapult and physically defensive Tangrowth and Great Tusk. Wallbreakers like Garchomp, Zamazenta, Tapu Lele, and Mega Charizard Y appreciate Greninja's U-turn bringing them in safely on foes like Heatran, Garganacl, Toxapex, and Gholdengo, respectively. Garchomp also provides entry hazards to punish Greninja's forced switches, chipping down the likes of Garganacl and Heatran. In return, Greninja outpaces faster threats like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult that would otherwise overwhelm them. Greninja can form a VoltTurn core with Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Mega Scizor; the former two also provide Defog so Greninja can pivot more freely, especially if running Tera Ice.</p>"

Its naturally high Speed tier is invaluable to outpace and threaten fast foes such as Iron Valiant and Sandy Shocks. Aside from hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types like Bronzong and Gholdengo, Dark Pulse's lack of immunities makes it a spammable attack that can be used to muscle past neutral Pokemon such as Corviknight with flinches. Ice Beam covers a large portion of the metagame, including Dragon, Ground, Grass, and Flying teams, decimating prominent foes like Hydreigon, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Iron Jugulis. It's also Greninja's hardest hitting attack against Skuntank, which is important in the Poison matchup. Extrasensory pressures Poison- and Fighting-types like Toxapex and Assault Vest Iron Hands and prevents Greninja from being picked off by Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot rounds out its coverage, significantly damaging Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Water-types such as Gastrodon and Dondozo.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja appreciates being paired with other wallbreakers like Barraskewda and Quaquaval that can handle Normal and Steel teams. They break through bulky Pokemon like Blissey and Kingambit that Greninja struggles with; they are also potent late-game cleaners that enjoy Greninja's ability to threaten Storm Drain Gastrodon and their physically defensive checks like Amoonguss, Toxapex, Slowbro, and Dondozo. Moreover, Barraskewda under rain excels at tearing down fast offensive teams that Greninja can struggle with, as it can threaten out Meowscarada, boosted Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Iron Moth. Quaquaval can also run Rapid Spin to let Greninja enter the field multiple times to wallbreak without worry, preventing it from being chipped down into KO range of priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Baxcalibur's Ice Shard. Pivot support from Slowking is helpful to bring Greninja in safely on foes like Dragalge and Gastrodon, letting it fire off attacks freely. Defensive teammates such as Toxapex, Dondozo, Gastrodon, and Quagsire can switch into potential revenge killers like Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Dragapult, and Slither Wing, respectively; notably, Gastrodon and Quagsire also provide entry hazards to take advantage of the countless switches that Greninja forces, putting the likes of Ting-Lu, Toxapex, and Assault Vest Iron Hands into Greninja's KO range, as well as switch into and check Electric-types such as Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks and Assault Vest Iron Hands.</p>"

Sleep Powder enables Vivillon to cripple opposing Pokemon that may otherwise check it, such as Eelektross and Drifblim, and give it the free turn needed to set up a Quiver Dance. Substitute is an option to ease setup by helping Vivillon play around the uncertainty of sleep turns and dodge status. Bug Buzz targets Pokemon such as Umbreon and Hattrem, which can otherwise cut Vivillon's sweep short with Thunder Wave or Nuzzle. Finally, Tera Blast with Tera Ground does heavy damage to Muk and outright OHKOes Magneton. Vivillon's very poor overall bulk makes Focus Sash a good option, as it guarantees a Quiver Dance boost or the ability to put a foe to sleep. However, if your team lacks multiple forms of entry hazard removal, Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred. Compound Eyes boosts the otherwise shaky accuracy of Sleep Powder and Hurricane, making them far more reliable. A Timid nature is preferred over a Modest nature to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Indeedee-F, Passimian, and Medicham after a Quiver Dance and outspeed and threaten an OHKO on offensive threats like Toxicroak and Mabosstiff unboosted. Tera Ground allows Vivillon to turn the tables on Volt Switch users such as Jolteon and Rotom and also helps it survive Accelerock from Lycanroc. Alternatively, Tera Ghost along with Substitute allows Vivillon to set up against Chansey, which would normally wall it, and Tera Flying can be used to power up Vivillon's Hurricane.</p> <p>If Vivillon is running Focus Sash over Heavy-Duty Boots, strong hazard control is key, so Hattrem, which prevents opposing hazards through Magic Bounce, and other hazard removal options such as Drifblim and Lurantis are mandatory. Special walls such as Chansey and Eelektross are a serious obstacle for Vivillon to overcome, with the former's Natural Cure negating the effect of Sleep Powder, so physical wallbreakers that can take advantage of them like Toxicroak, Paldean Tauros, and Ursaring make for great partners. Trick users, such as Rotom and Zoroark, can also bait in these foes and cripple them by giving them a Choice item, with Rotom deserving special mention for inviting in Lurantis and Appletun, which gives a Vivillon relatively free setup opportunity. Spikes support from the likes of Qwilfish and Cacturne is also appreciated to help wear down answers to Vivillon over time. Strong setup sweepers like Veluza, Dudunsparce, and Lycanroc, which all appreciate foes being put to sleep, also make for powerful partners in conjunction with Vivillon.</p>"

It is also a solid switch-in to Water-types like Whiscash and Basculin, comfortably taking their STAB moves and threatening to OHKO them or set up. Bulk Up is what lets Gogoat become so threatening late-game, letting it take on physical attackers like Perserrker and Sawsbuck after a Bulk Up or two. Rock Slide is optimal coverage alongside Horn Leech, hitting Grass-type checks like Charizard, Honchkrow, and Articuno. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Gogoat ignore entry hazards, namely the otherwise debilitating Toxic Spikes. Water is the premier Tera type due to its overall defensive utility, reversing Gogoat's Fire weakness and making it take Flying- and Bug-type attacks more easily, which lets it set up on various foes it could not before such as Charizard, Rabsca, and Camerupt. However, Tera Rock gives Gogoat STAB on Rock Slide while still having it resist Fire and Flying, but it becomes vulnerable to Ground- and Steel-types like Gabite and Perrserker. Both Tera types keep Gogoat's usefulness as a Grass-type check due to Sap Sipper.</p> <p>Before Terastallizing or setting up, Gogoat is threatened by common offensive Pokemon like Charizard, Pyroar, and Rotom-F, so additional special walls like Carbink and Ampharos are recommended as partners. Carbink can also set entry hazards to wear down Gogoat's checks like Gabite and Tinkatuff, while Ampharos can bring Gogoat in with Volt Switch.

Shadow Ball serves as Aegislash's main STAB move, and alongside Aegislash's naturally high Special Attack stat, is useful for putting pressure onto Toxic-immune Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Excadrill, and Mega Sableye. SubToxic Aegislash fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to safely set up on and wear down defensive Pokemon while also making use of its ability to simultaneously check offensive threats such as Galarian Zapdos and Latios.

Iron Head is an alternative option that still OHKOes the former two after a boost while also 2HKOing Unaware Clefable. Shadow Sneak is a crucial priority move which at +2 can finish off weakened offensive Pokemon that would normally outspeed and take it out, such as Iron Moth and Keldeo, while also being usable to pick off Latios and Alakazam without a boost. Ghostium Z is usually preferred to power up STAB Shadow Claw, which, when turned into Never Ending Nightmare, threatens to KO physically defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory and Amoonguss after Swords Dance. However, Air Balloon can be run instead if the team already has a different Z-Move user, and this also allows Aegislash to find free setup opportunities against Ground-types such as Excadrill and Hippowdon, potentially spinblocking the former. Aegislash fits best on more offensive teams that appreciate its defensive utility and ability to break open holes for its teammates early-game. Other sweepers such as Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar can benefit from Ghostium-Z variants of Aegislash forcing in and eliminating Buzzwole, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth; in return, Mega Tyranitar can help Aegislash weaken certain walls like Slowbro and Mandibuzz early-game. Aegislash also suffers from having terrible bulk in Blade forme, so it is easily revenge killed after attacking, making entry hazard support from the likes of Mew, Ting-Lu, and Mega Tyranitar helpful at chipping down offensive threats like Excadrill into Shadow Sneak range while also pressuring other walls such as Tapu Fini.</p>"

Shadow Sneak gives Aegislash additional utility in being able to pick off weakened offensive Pokemon such as Latios and Blacephalon when needed. King's Shield prevents Aegislash from being picked off by Pursuit users like Tyranitar and lets it scout Choice-locked revenge killers such as Keldeo and Hydreigon. 8 Attack EVs with a Mild nature are necessary for Aegislash to 2HKO Chansey with Close Combat after Stealth Rock. Mixed Aegislash commonly features on more offensive teams that appreciate its instant wallbreaking power combined with its utility. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar can be very crucial in helping Aegislash secure 2HKOes against Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Amoonguss on the switch. While Aegislash can find additional opportunities by pivoting directly into attackers such as Latios and Galarian Zapdos, it is often unable to preserve its HP to continue wallbreaking after doing so; as such, pivots like Cinderace are essential to let Aegislash enter the battlefield safely against Pokemon it would like to force out, such as Slowbro. Other setup Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Hydreigon can help overwhelm shared checks to this set, such as Ting-Lu; in return, Hydreigon benefit from Aegislash's ability to keep faster Pokemon like Latios and Alakazam in check.</p>"

A Quiet nature can be used to increase its power, though this risks Sylveon getting outsped by Kingambit.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: Psychic deals more damage to physically defensive Toxapex and Amoonguss, but its lower damage output against Iron Moth makes it disappointing if not using Tera Ground.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyper Beam</strong>: Despite the serious risks from the recharge turn, Hyper Beam's extreme power makes it a good filler move.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Assault Vest lets even offensive Sylveon be specially resilient.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: With the boost from Choice Specs, Sylveon is a surprisingly potent wallbreaker, making the most out of its many opportunities to switch in.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA</strong>: This spread capitalizes on Sylveon's good natural bulk while maximizing its power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe</strong>: While no bulk investment makes Sylveon more difficult to safely get in, Speed investment allows it to outrun and threaten a wider range of foes, such as Scizor and Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Sylveon suffers coverage issues on its own, so its heavily reliant on either Tera Blast or the sheer power of Tera Fairy Hyper Voice to break past them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire allows Sylveon to break past troublesome Steel-types, like Gholdengo and Kingambit, and gives it a key resistance to Ice and Fire attacks from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives good coverage against Fire-types like Iron Moth and Skeledirge, in addition to surprising Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu by resisting their strongest STAB attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground doesn't match up quite as well against Steel-types as Tera Fire, but it lets Sylveon turn the tables on Iron Moth, and deal massive damage to Toxapex and Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Getting an extra boost on Hyper Voice and Hyper Beam makes Choice Specs Sylveon far more difficult to wall, with even resists such as Gholdengo and physically defensive Skeledirge getting 2HKOed by Hyper Voice!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Giving Sylveon extra special bulk lets it take on powerful threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle more reliably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs turns Sylveon into a surprising wallbreaker, especially if using Tera Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Throat Spray</strong>: With Hyper Voice activating Throat Spray, Sylveon could potentially break apart slower foes in the late-game, though it only gets one shot at this Special Attack boost.

While It's possible to drop this attack for Tera Blast in an attempt to run more coverage, this seriously worsens Sylveon's matchup against Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Beyond just Terastallization, Tera Blast is still impacted by Pixilate, making it a good move to use against foes that sometimes carry Throat Chop, like Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect pairs excellently with Leftovers, and makes Wish a more reliable recovery move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Yawn</strong>: Sylveon's good bulk makes it a great choice for phazing with Yawn.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psyshock</strong>: Psyshock is Sylveon's best hope for Iron Moth switch-ins.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: Shadow Ball offers important coverage on Gholdengo without demanding that Sylveon Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Sitrus Berry</strong>: Leftovers is the preferred recovery item for its synergy with Protect and Wish, but Sitrus Berry is a reasonable alternative if Protect isn't wanted, or if another teammate needs Leftovers more.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Sylveon's coverage issues are much easier to deal with when using Terastallization, but this set can still be used well defensively without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: A Fire Tera type grants Sylveon resistances to Steel and Fairy, allowing it to take on foes it would otherwise have to run from, such as Gholdengo, and a good STAB to hit Chien-Pao hard with if not using Hyper Voice. It also works against Scizor, but note that Tera Water is common on that foe. Tera Fire also makes Sylveon far more vulnerable to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a great mono-attacking option, making it ideal if only running Tera Blast to do decently well against Steel-types. It also gives Sylveon a better matchup against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, and is a safer option against Ting-Lu and Tera Water Scizor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: If not using Tera Blast, Fairy becomes a reasonable option for boosting Hyper Voice's damage output. Note that Tera Blast is not needed to justify a different Tera Type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground worsens Sylveon's matchup with Chien-Pao, but it does let it deal big damage to Iron Moth, Gholdengo, and Toxapex.</p> </li> </ul>"

Acrobatics pairs really well with Unburden and is Hawlucha's best move due to its power, notably helping deal with the plethora of Fighting- and Grass-types, 2HKOing Okidogi, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss and OHKOing Buzzwole. Close Combat hits Steel-types that resist Acrobatics like Celesteela, Skarmory, and Excadrill, as well as OHKOing Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Hydreigon. Taunt prevents Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Okidogi, and Mew from using recovery, setup, and status moves, while Roost lets Hawlucha set up in front of defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth, Buzzwole, and Hippowdon.

Its high-powered STAB moves—which can be boosted further by Swords Dance—hit almost the entire metagame neutrally; Acrobatics grants Hawlucha strong neutral coverage against the likes of Tornadus-T, Dragapult, and Tapu Lele, which is backed up by Close Combat to decimate Flying-resistant Pokemon like Kingambit, Garganacl, and Mega Tyranitar. Its item instantly activates Unburden under the corresponding Terrain and grants it setup opportunities from the Defense boost, especially in conjunction with Roost. Electric Seed helps against Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk and prevents revenge killing attempts from Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Weavile's Ice Shard, while Psychic Seed helps against Gholdengo, Volcarona, and Choice-locked Dragapult. Taunt or Substitute deals with problematic walls, ignoring status like Toxapex's Toxic and Skeledirge's Will-O-Wisp; Taunt also prevents their recovery and phazing as well as Defense-boosting attempts such as from Skarmory or Tera Water Buzzwole, while Substitute blocks Landorus-T's Intimidate and punishes the use of weak attacks like its U-turn, Garganacl's Salt Cure, and Alomomola's Scald. The bulk investment allows Hawlucha to survive Clefable's Moonblast, which is unnecessary if running Psychic Seed. 176 Speed EVs can be used instead to revenge kill +1 Dragon Dance Dragapult.

Offensive Pokemon on hyper offense teams such as Iron Valiant, Volcarona, Dragonite, and Mega Gyarados help maintain offensive pressure against the opposition; notably, they can force damage onto shared checks like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, Zapdos, and Toxapex, respectively, for Hawlucha to sweep more easily.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Carving out a niche for itself as an entry hazard setter with good matchups against common threats such as Charizard and Articuno, Carbink is easily able to exploit the fact that many common offensive Pokemon will struggle to OHKO it, making entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field nearly guaranteed. Body Press further takes advantage of Carbink's naturally high Defense by allowing it to deal modest damage, especially to frail attackers such as Pyroar or Steel-types that may try to switch in, such as Perrserker or Alolan Dugtrio, although its reliance on Body Press to not be immensely passive can invite in opposing Misdreavus or other Pokemon that may choose to utilize Tera Ghost. Power Gem allows for Carbink to target common Pokemon in the tier that have a large Rock weakness, such as Charizard, Articuno, Masquerain, and Vespiquen, while also insuring that it is not entirely helpless against the aforementioned Misdreavus. Spikes allows Carbink to be of greater assistance to more fast-paced offensive teams, further exploiting its natural bulk to apply even more pressure to the opponent in the form of entry hazards. Rest allows for Carbink to somewhat make up for its lack of recovery, which helps it to still be a threat later in the game and to set hazards back up if they are removed. Lastly, Iron Defense allows Carbink to become a threatening sweeper by making it even more difficult to break through while also greatly increasing the damage done by Body Press. Heavy-Duty Boots helps Carbink by making it immune to opposing hazards, greatly increasing its longevity, while Leftovers allows for a small amount of passive recovery. Tera Fighting increases the damage of Body Press even further, while Tera Ghost allows for Carbink to block attempts at using Rapid Spin to clear away hazards. A more physically defensive spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with a Bold nature is also viable to improve Carbink's matchup against threats such as Gogoat and Dugtrio.</p> <p>Carbink's high success rate when it comes to setting up entry hazards is greatly appreciated by almost all teams, especially those that make use of setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Charizard or powerful breakers like Zangoose, which greatly benefit from the extra chip damage that Carbink provides. In addition, Grass-types such as Gogoat and Thwackey appreciate Carbink's ability to take hits from the multitude of powerful Fire-types in the tier. Thwackey is also one of the few Pokemon in PU with access to Knock Off, which is valuable for removing Heavy-Duty Boots from opponents and making Carbink's hazards much more difficult to manage. Furthermore, Grassy Terrain lessens the damage dealt by Earthquake and provides Carbink with passive recovery, which is especially beneficial should it choose to run Heavy-Duty Boots. In return, these Pokemon are strong answers to Water-types such as Whiscash and Golduck that can solidly threaten Carbink with super effective attacks. Carbink also appreciates strong Ground- and Fire-types, such as Dugtrio, Charizard, and Pyroar, that can handle threatening Steel-types such as Perrserker and Alolan Dugtrio for it. Due to Carbink being extremely slow and vulnerable to moves such as Taunt and Encore, fast teammates such as the aforementioned Dugtrio, as well as Alolan Persian and Raichu, are also appreciated to handle attempts to stifle Carbink alongside providing much-needed speed control.</p>"

Most of these switch-ins like Charizard and Masquerain also have to be wary of Power Gem. Carbink could choose to run Moonblast instead, hitting the likes of Drakloak and Spiritomb. Rock Polish is an option in the last slot to boost past Pokemon that could normally pick it off at low health like offensive Perrserker, Klawf, and Gabite. Carbink can also opt to run RestTalk alongside Iron Defense and Body Press to function better as a late-game sweeper once opposing Ghost-types and bulky Pokemon that resist its attacks are removed. Clear Body helps with many aspects, like avoiding defensive drops from moves like Misdreavus's Shadow Ball or Quaxwell's Liquidation, blocking Alolan Persian's Parting Shot, and ignoring Sticky Web's Speed drop. Tera Fighting is used to boost Body Press's power, helping Carbink pick up the 2HKO on Gogoat, Skuntank, and Whiscash. A defensive Tera like Ghost or Water also work well with helping Carbink get by various foes. Ghost drops all of its weaknesses, allowing it to tank hits with greater ease, but it makes enemies like Misdreavus, Banette, and Haunter more problematic. Water is a great option for stuffing the likes of Golduck, Basculin, and Lumineon, though Carbink then has to be wary of Rotom-F and Raichu in addition to being a generally good defensive typing that also allows it to shrug off hits from Steel-type moves that would usually obliterate it. Carbink can opt to run a more specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature to better take hits from Whiscash, Lumineon, and Raichu for an easier time setting up on them. However, you do miss out on initial Body Press power.</p> <p>Carbink works great on balance or bulky offensive teams looking for an endgame sweeper. It does great at supporting the likes of Misdreavus, Haunter, and Indeedee-F since it can wall Dark-types like Honchkrow, Alolan Persian, and Spiritomb. Carbink also isn't bothered by the likes of Houndoom, Pyroar, and Charizard which teammates like Gogoat, Rotom-F, and Rabsca really appreciate. It also fits the role of a Knock Off absorber, being able to take the hit when switching in and either immediately deal damage back or start setting up on Banette, Tinkatuff, and Klawf. While Carbink's defensive capabilities make it a great teammate, it also can break through bulky teams that rely on the likes of Hisuian Sliggoo and Chansey, which special attackers such as Haunter, Persian and Rotom-F enjoy having removed. Grass-types such as Gogoat, Dartrix, and Flapple really help Carbink find multiple opportunities to come back in to set up since they can help take hits from the likes of Whiscash, Basculin, and Sawsbuck. Carbink also really appreciates having a partner that can help with its 4x weakness to Steel, specifically against Perrserker and Alolan Dugtrio, like defensive Misdreavus, Lumineon, and RestTalk Gabite.</p>"

While Heavy Slam isn't very useful against heavy targets, it's worth using for OHKOing offensive Flutter Mane, one of the biggest threats in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draco Meteor versus Ice Beam</strong>: Draco Meteor's power makes switching offensive threats like Urshifu-R into Hisuian Goodra tricky, and it is notable for 2HKOing Dondozo. Ice Beam lets Hisuian Goodra punish important Ground-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acid Spray</strong>: Acid Spray is a useful wallbreaking tool, capable of making even specially bulky foes like Clodsire risk taking massive damage after the Special Defense drop.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: Thunderbolt is another way to 2HKO physically defensive Dondozo and OHKO offensive Urshifu-R and pairs very well with Ice Beam in terms of coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: While not particularly strong, Earthquake is highly recommended for 2HKOing Heatran and 3HKOing opposing Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra, as both of these will wall this set otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: For other Steel-types like Gholdengo and Scizor, Flamethrower will deal much more damage than Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modest versus Quiet</strong>: The importance of mirror matches makes Modest an appealing option for Hisuian Goodra, but Quiet will ensure that all but the bulkiest Flutter Mane will need to Terastallize to avoid an OHKO from Heavy Slam.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Surf</strong>: Surf is a decent option to hit Ground-types and Heatran with one attack, but Surf will, at best, usually only 3HKO Heatran.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Despite Hisuian Goodra's superb typing, its common weaknesses to Ground and Fighting make Terastallization a valuable route for it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying covers Hisuian Goodra's former weaknesses fantastically, even giving it an out against Fissure Dondozo. This comes at the cost of doing much worse against Iron Bundle, Thundurus-T, Zapdos, and Rotom-W though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy still gives Hisuian Goodra a vital Fighting resistance, as well as being a good defensive typing in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water has good synergy with Sap Sipper, giving Hisuian Goodra a sole weakness to Electric, in addition to gaining a useful Ice resistance against Chien-Pao, at the cost of doing worse against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Female Gender</strong>: If using Heavy Slam, there is a a chance that Hisuian Goodra can become infatuated by the very rare Cute Charm Enamorus, making a female gender very slightly superior.</li> </ul>"

Ice Beam, on the other hand, is a safer and stronger option against Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rest and Chesto Berry</strong>: Rest and Chesto Berry combine to give Hisuian Goodra a great way to restore health, though the combination is only reliable once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Dew</strong>: Life Dew doesn't restore much health even with Leftovers, but it can help Hisuian Goodra last longer against some physical threats after setting up.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Hisuian Goodra's fantastic typing doesn't make Terastallization a requirement, but it does make setting up against major physical threats like Urshifu-R and Landorus-T much more feasible.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying not only covers all of Hisuian Goodra's former weaknesses, but it also means Fissure is no longer an option to break through its boosts from the likes of Dondozo or Ting-Lu. The new weaknesses to Electric and Ice can harm it though, since Electric- and Ice-type coverage moves are commonly special.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy gives Hisuian Goodra shielding from both Urshifu formes without giving it the harmful Electric and Ice weaknesses that Flying does, though it can harm mirror matches against Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Careful or Sassy</strong>: This specially defensive spread is Hisuian Goodra's best shot at avoiding a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Tera Fairy Moonblast, assuming extra Leftovers recovery from Protect.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish or Relaxed</strong>: Maximum physical bulk means Hisuian Goodra won't check Flutter Mane nearly as well, but it let will let Body Press become a better sweeping tool.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Acid Armor</strong>: Acid Armor is the best option for boosting Defense due to its higher PP, but it requires Hisuian Sligoo to evolve while knowing the move in either Scarlet or Violet, as it's not able to be relearned by Hisuian Goodra. Shelter is still a viable, albeit strictly inferior, option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Female Gender</strong>: While very rare, Heavy Slam being a contact move means Hisuian Goodra does risk of activating Enamorus's Cute Charm, making a female gender a marginally better choice.</p> </li> </ul>"

This set excels at enabling setup sweepers such as Mimikyu and Azumarill providing them with boosted bulk and chipping the opposing team thanks to Spikes. With maximum HP and Defense EVs and Foul Play, Klefki efficiently counters opposing Swords Dance and Dragon Dance sweepers such as Scizor and Dragonite. Alternatively, it can use Thunder Wave to cripple fast threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant. Klefki’s Steel typing also provides a useful immunity against Poison-type teams and blocks Glimmora's Mortal Spin, ensuring that entry hazards remain on the opposing field.</p> <p>Belly Drum Azumarill is an excellent partner for Klefki, as the dual screens greatly facilitate setting up with Belly Drum and sweeping opposing teams. Additionally, Spikes provide some chip damage to ensure OHKOs on foes like Meowscarada. Choice Specs Flutter Mane can also take advantage of the chip damage from Klefki's Spikes to power through teams and more easily defeat walls such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and Amoonguss. Calm Mind Flutter Mane benefits both dual screens to set up and sweep and from Thunder Wave slowing down threats like Barraskewda. Iron Valiant appreciates Klefki slowing down faster foes like Flutter Mane, Cinderace, and Dragapult with Thunder Wave, allowing it to defeat them. Iron Valiant also provides a much-needed offensive pressure against Steel-types like Kingambit and works as a devastating offensive core when paired with Flutter Mane. Hatterene and Klefki form a strong defensive core, with the former’s Magic Bounce punishing any attempt from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Forretress to set entry hazards, while the latter can come in on Poison-type moves, potentially forcing a switch on a Choice locked Pokemon like Greninja in the process. The additional bulk that Hatterene receives from the dual screens even allows it to take a stand against foes such as Glimmora, Clodsire, and Toxapex, preventing them from setting their hazards while countering them.</p>"

Foul Play prevents Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Mimikyu to set up and sweep while Thunder Wave cripples foes and allows Mega Diancie to outspeed threats such as +1 Mega Charizard X and Nihilego, which will normally beat Klefki one on one. Setting up Spikes creates solid chip damage on Alolan Muk and Gholdengo, allowing for late-game sweeping from its teammates Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Mega Diancie punishes opponents trying to set up entry hazards against Klefki and beats Fire-types such as Heatran and Mega Charizard Y.

Haze and Parting Shot are useful against No Retreat Arceus-Ghost, with Parting Shot also providing pivoting but matching up worse against Nasty Plot Arceus-Ghost. Calm Mind is an option in tandem with Revelation Dance to also check Arceus-Ghost effectively, although all Fairy-types must be removed before attempting to sweep with it. Yveltal's powerful Dark-type STAB moves deter Ghost-types, making it an effective user of Rapid Spin.

Mystical Fire punishes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor for attempting to switch into and take advantage of it. Alternatively, Earth Power significantly dents or OHKOes Heatran and hits Gholdengo and Clodsire harder. Mega Diancie acts as an excellent entry hazard stacker, as it takes advantage of the switches it forces and threatens out common entry hazard removers such as Tornadus-T and Great Tusk. Mega Diancie can use Spikes or Stealth Rock to weaken checks such as Mega Scizor and Heatran, depending on its coverage move, while punishing them for attempting to pivot into it. A Naive nature is preferred, as it allows Mega Diancie to take less damage from common priority moves in Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Mega Lopunny's Fake Out. However, Mega Diancie can also use Hasty in order to sponge Hurricane from Tornadus-T. Mega Diancie fits best on bulky offense and offense teams, which appreciate its early- or mid-game wallbreaking and ability to set entry hazards. Pokemon that appreciate Mega Diancie weakening common Steel-types such as Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult pair well with it, using their higher Speed tiers to clean late-game. Additionally, Mega Diancie pairs well with Knock Off users like Tornadus-T and Kingambit, as they make Mega Diancie's entry hazards more effective and force checks such as Toxapex and Clodsire to succumb to them. Mega Diancie can struggle with entering the field given its relative frailty and poor defensive typing, which also gives it a tendency to be revenge killed by Pokemon like Mega Swampert and Zamazenta. As such, pivots that can bring it in safely such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T make for good partners.</p>"

As such, Diancie forces opponents to either OHKO it or whittle it down with multiple neutral attacks, as a weak super effective attack into the bulky Diancie will put it in a commanding position. This is especially effective once Diancie has accrued enough Defense boosts, as even Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Palafin's Wave Crash may not OHKO it anymore.

Amoonguss also acts as a great partner for Diancie, with its Rage Powder and Spore protecting it from the Ground, Water, and Steel attacks that would threaten it.

Diamond Storm does considerable damage to special walls like Blissey and Alolan Muk and can also provide a Defense boost.

On a hyper offensive team, Mega Diancie runs four attacks for coverage. With Shuckle's Sticky Web up, its good Speed tier becomes more devastating and outspeeds Pokemon like Mega Gallade and Zeraora. Mega Diancie also pairs well with Omastar and Terrakion, as Omastar takes care of the Ground matchup with a well-timed Shell Smash, while Terrakion's access to Earthquake and Close Combat takes care of most Steel-types. On bulky offense, Mega Diancie prefers to run Spikes, as the chip damage sets up a potential late-game cleanup from more offensive Pokemon on the team like Terrakion and Nihilego.

Tapu Bulu counters Ground- and Water-types like Great Tusk and Urshifu-R, while Tapu Lele takes on Poison-types and prevents priority moves from Azumarill and Mega Scizor. Iron Valiant is a great partner for the Steel matchup, but it also benefits from Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain to outspeed and take out faster threats such as Zeraora and Greninja.

V-create is the strongest coverage option against Steel-types, OHKOing Solgaleo, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor, as well as KOing Mega Steelix that has switched into Boomburst. Precipice Blades is a weaker alternative that misses KOs on the aforementioned but instead hits Fire-types like Arceus-Fire and Victini. Pain Split is an effective recovery move due to Mega Diancie's low HP to offset Life Orb recoil, and it's also ineffective for Imposter users. Strength Sap is an alternative that is more reliable, but it can be more annoying to Imposter-proof. Stone Axe forgoes longevity for coverage against Ho-Oh and also allows Mega Diancie to make progress against walls like Arceus-Poison. Mega Diancie has difficulties bypassing certain walls like Fur Coat Arceus-Poison, so offensive partners like mixed Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Garchomp synergize well.

Volt Switch helps keep momentum against bulky checks like Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Fairy, giving opportunities to teammates to help whittle them down.

Mega Diancie's main drawback is that it often lacks the raw power to beat special walls like Ice Scales Arceus formes, so supporting allies like Eternatus help wear them down over time. Mega Steelix is a severe thorn in Mega Diancie's side, as it can reliably scout the move it locks into, denies Volt Switch, and can pivot in an offensive teammate; as such, Knock Off support is recommended, as Mega Steelix is 2HKOed by Boomburst without its Assault Vest.

Zen Headbutt is a nice complementary STAB move, allowing Hoopa-U to smack prominent Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant that may try to switch in on a predicted Hyperspace Fury. Drain Punch hits Dark-types like Kingambit and Ting-Lu, while Gunk Shot offers coverage against Fairy-types like Enamorus and Azumarill, as well as Tera Fairy Moltres, Garganacl, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur. A Jolly nature allows Hoopa-U to outspeed Pokemon like Timid Heatran, Modest Gholdengo, and Timid Volcanion, while an Adamant nature allows Hoopa-U to hit even harder, 2HKOing Garganacl the majority of the time. Tera Dark boosts the power of Hyperspace Fury even further, 2HKOing physically defensive Dondozo; Tera Dark also offers the additional benefit of making Hoopa-U resist other Dark-type attacks, which can be crucial against Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Hoopa-U fits well on bulky offense teams that are in need of a physical wallbreaker. Physical setup sweepers like Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Dragonite appreciate Hoopa-U's presence on a team, as Hoopa-U is able to break through or dent physically defensive Pokemon that could stand in their way, like Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Rotom-W. One of Hoopa-U's biggest challenges is safely getting on the field due to its frail physical defense and quadruple weakness to U-turn, so it pairs well with pivots such as Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking, U-turn Dragapult, and Volt Switch Zapdos. Hoopa-U is also held back by its middling Speed, which tends to exacerbate Hoopa-U's physical frailty, so it appreciates paralysis support from partners like Rotom-W and Substitute Dragapult. Static Zapdos is a particularly notable partner for Hoopa-U, because it is able to switch in and potentially paralyze faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Dragapult, rendering those Pokemon no longer threatening to Hoopa-U. Pokemon that can set entry hazards like Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Landorus-T help facilitate with Hoopa-U breaking through its switch-ins. Opposing physical Dark-types, such as Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Roaring Moon, typically force Hoopa-U out, especially after a Defense drop. For this reason, sturdy Dark-resistant teammates like Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Low Kick Kingambit synergize well with Hoopa-U, while those Pokemon also appreciate Hoopa-U punching holes in the opposing team's defensive backbone.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Hoopa-U is an incredibly threatening special wallbreaker, especially to slower and more defensive teams, that is able to OHKO the majority of the tier and 2HKO essentially every other relevant Pokemon. This is thanks to Hoopa-U's astronomically high Special Attack stat and potent dual STAB combination. Focus Blast rounds out its coverage, allowing Hoopa-U to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Hisuian Samurott; Focus Blast also OHKOes specially defensive Heatran after entry hazard chip. Trick can be run in the fourth slot to cripple the few special walls that Hoopa-U is unable to reliably blast through, like Blissey, Scream Tail, and Alolan Muk, while also affording Hoopa-U the ability to switch moves, alleviating the need for prediction in exchange for less immediate power. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be used instead as Hoopa-U's best option to hit Corviknight and Galarian Moltres while also providing a more reliable option than Focus Blast to OHKO Hisuian Samurott and Greninja. A Timid nature makes Hoopa-U faster than Pokemon like Timid Heatran, Modest Gholdengo, and Timid Volcanion, while a Modest nature gives Hoopa-U even more breaking power so that it is able to potentially 2HKO Blissey and Alolan Muk with Focus Blast after entry hazard damage. Tera Dark increases the power of Dark Pulse, giving it an opportunity to 2HKO Scream Tail and specially defensive Heatran while also threatening to OHKO Baxcalibur, bulky Cinderace, and defensive Landorus-T. Tera Dark also makes Hoopa-U resist Dark-type attacks, which can prevent Kingambit from answering it with Sucker Punch. Quick special attackers like Choice Specs Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus make good teammates, as they appreciate Hoopa-U's ability to break through even the bulkiest of specially defensive walls. One of Hoopa-U's biggest flaws is that its physical frailty and crippling 4x weakness to U-turn can make it difficult for it to safely be brought onto the field. As a result, Hoopa-U greatly benefits from being paired alongside pivots that can facilitate its entry, like Galarian Slowking with Chilly Reception; Landorus-T, Dragapult, and Sneasler with U-turn; and Rotom-W and Zapdos with Volt Switch. Paralysis support from Thunder Wave users like Rotom-W, Substitute Dragapult, and defensive Gholdengo can help alleviate Hoopa-U's lackluster Speed and make previously faster threats easy targets. Static Zapdos synergizes particularly well with Hoopa-U in this regard, since Zapdos can punish U-turns directed at Hoopa-U from faster Pokemon like Cinderace, Sneasler, and Meowscarada to potentially paralyze them. Hoopa-U also appreciates the inclusion of hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Heatran, allowing it to punch holes in defensive backbones more easily and damage the opposing team thanks to the switches it forces. Some of the most difficult Pokemon for Hoopa-U to handle are opposing Dark-types like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Ting-Lu, and Hisuian Samurott because they can force Hoopa-U to rely on Focus Blast and good prediction to break through. To help mitigate this issue, Pokemon that can reliably switch into Dark-types like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Azumarill also make good partners for Hoopa-U, and in return they appreciate Choice Specs Hoopa-U's ability to threaten physical walls as well. Bulk Up Great Tusk and Belly Drum Azumarill can also clean up late-game after Hoopa-U wears down the opposing team.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Equipping Hoopa-U with an Assault Vest makes the most of its excellent coverage and surprisingly high special bulk, letting it trade with various special attackers like Dragapult and Walking Wake. Strong Knock Off is a large reason to use this set, as it is an excellent progress maker, particularly against bulkier teams. Psychic is run over Zen Headbutt for its higher accuracy and better damage against physically defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Great Tusk. Drain Punch provides Hoopa-U with adequate recovery and logevity, and it is largely used to hit Kingambit and other Dark-types, which otherwise walls this set. Gunk Shot provides important coverage for Fairy-types like Enamorus and Tera Fairy foes like Garganacl while potentially poisoning checks like Ting Lu. Tera Poison not only empowers its Gunk Shot but also gives it a crucial Fairy and U-turn resistance. 248 HP and 40 Defense investment with a Lonely Nature allows Hoopa-U to survive one Sucker Punch from Adamant Kingambit with a maximum Supreme Overlord boost and gives it an easier time against weaker physical attacks from Pokemon like Garganacl and Clodsire. Meanwhile, 84 SpA EVs give Hoopa-U a guaranteed OHKO on Iron Moth with Psychic and 92 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Hoopa-U is best utilized on bulky offense teams that can support a slow, powerful wallbreaker like it while still appreciating its ability to trade hits with common special attackers. It is incredibly physically frail, so pairing it with physically bulky Pokemon like Garganacl and Great Tusk is a good idea, as it will often be forced out by physical attackers. Additionally, pivot support from Cinderace and Zapdos can put Hoopa-U in favorable positions to dish out damage with its strong attacks, something that is necessary given its aforementioned physical frailty. Because Hoopa-U often makes great progress with Knock Off, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T are great teammate options. Hoopa-U excels at punching holes in the opposition, so faster offensive teammates like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus are good ideas to take advantage of the resultant weakened foes. Teammates like Amoonguss and Galarian Slowking also deserve consideration for checking Iron Valiant and Enamorus without having to expend Terastallization.</p>"

Hoopa-U has a 4x weakness to U-turn and neutrality to Pursuit, meaning it cannot enter or leave the field easily. Nonetheless, Hoopa-U does not require setup, and it therefore has a niche into bulkier teams thanks to its immediate power. Drain Punch lets Hoopa-U take on Dark-types that would otherwise wall it, such as Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar, and Zen Headbutt hammers Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Buzzwole, and Toxapex while also hitting Clefable and Tera Fairy Garganacl neutrally. Gunk Shot provides Hoopa-U with another way to break through Fairy-types such as Tera Fairy Garganacl and Clefable. Tera Dark powers up Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury while giving it a resistance to Pursuit. Hoopa-U fits well on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its power allowing teammates to clean.

Hoopa-U also has trouble getting into the field due to its low Speed and frail physical bulk, so pivots such as Mega Scizor and Rotom-W are appreciated to bring it in Hoopa-U more consistently. Rotom-W also pivots into Toxapex and Heatran to bring in Hoopa-U, while Mega Scizor pivots into Tapu Lele and Kingambit and brings in Heatran and Skeledirge for Hoopa-U to break through. Entry hazard setters are also appreciated, as Hoopa-U can more easily break through defensive teams with Spikes or Stealth Rock on the field.

Drain Punch grants Hoopa-U super effective coverage against Dark- and Steel-types such as Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Brick Break can also be run as Hoopa-U's Fighting-type move, as this allows it to remove dual screens set by Fairy- and Dark-type teams. Trick is a great option for Hoopa-U to hinder Pokemon that can take a hit like Sableye and Klefki, as well as potentially disrupt Pokemon reliant on their items such as Moltres. Gunk Shot is another great option, as it allows Hoopa-U to threaten Fairy-types like Azumarill and to OHKO Hatterene. By investing 8 EVs in Special Defense, Hoopa-U can live a Moonblast from Choice Scarf Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Azelf and Scream Tail make for great partners, as they can set up entry hazards for Hoopa-U to be able to wallbreak more easily. Azelf can also run Taunt to prevent Defog users like Corviknight removing its hazards, while Scream Tail can also set up dual screens for both Hoopa-U and its teammates and provide Wish support. Because of Hoopa-U's lack of longevity outside of Wish, it can get easily worn down by hazards. Hence, Hatterene is a great partner, as it is able to provide great hazard control for Psychic teams through Magic Bounce. Galarian Slowking is another great partner for Hoopa-U, as it provides Hoopa-U a switch-in to Fairy-types and aids Hoopa-U's wallbreaking through Future Sight. Galarian Slowking can also set up Toxic Spikes to annoy Hoopa-U's switch-ins such as Azumarill, and its Poison typing allows it to remove Toxic Spikes to prevent Hoopa-U from getting worn down by poison. Indeedee is another great addition to Psychic teams, as its Normal typing grants it an immunity to Ghost. Aside from this, Indeedee can set up Psychic Terrain to allow Hoopa-U to threaten Kingambit with Drain Punch without fearing Sucker Punch. Lastly, late-game sweepers such as Gallade and Armarouge appreciate Hoopa-U beating their checks such as Azumarill for the former and Galarian Slowking for the latter. Lastly, Espathra appreciates Hoopa-U breaking through its checks such as Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Sableye so it can set up and sweep late-game.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Volcanion's high Special Attack and great offensive typing make it an excellent wallbreaker with solid defensive utility thanks to Water Absorb. Good coverage options as well as a powerful STAB move that can burn its foes make it very difficult to switch into. Earth Power is crucial for hitting Toxapex, which easily switches into both of Volcanion's STAB moves; it also hits Galarian Slowking harder, notably guaranteeing a 2HKO on physically defensive variants. Taunt is useful against bulkier Pokemon, preventing Dondozo or Toxapex from using healing moves and Galarian Slowking from using Thunder Wave. Substitute eases prediction, as Volcanion can force switches, and it takes advantage of certain Pokemon that fail to break the Substitute such as bulky Cinderace and non-Assault Vest Toxapex while still avoiding status attempts from the aforementioned walls. It also allows Volcanion to avoid Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Tera Blast alongside Tera Fairy can be used to hit Pokemon such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Hisuian Samurott. Becoming a Fairy-type offers useful defensive utility, giving it an immunity to both of Walking Wake's STAB moves and a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Tera Ground can be used to grant Volcanion an Electric immunity, improving its matching against Zapdows and Rotom-W, while also boosting Earth Power's damage. Both Tera types also neutralize its weakness to Earthquake from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. 140 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Great Tusk. Volcanion fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate a strong wallbreaker. Entry hazards, especially Spikes, make Volcanion much harder to deal with. Therefore, hazard setters including Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T make good partners. Ting-Lu can also switch into special attackers like Dragapult and Zapdos for Volcanion. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking cause problems for Volcanion, so teammates that can help overwhelm them such as Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Utility Dragapult are also useful. Finally, Swords Dance Iron Valiant and Kingambit can clean late-game once Volcanion has worn down the opposing team, and they also pressure the aforementioned specially defensive Pokemon. Kingambit in particular appreciates Volcanion's ability to deal with Fire-types like Cinderace and Moltres, and especially its immunity to Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

        "Choice Specs": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Volcanion is a wallbreaker with absurd strength thanks to its sky high Special Attack and amazing high-Base Power moves, allowing it to make progress every time it is in. Steam Eruption is Volcanion's most spammable move and has very limited switch-ins, as many Pokemon that resist both of Volcanion's STAB moves like Dragapult, Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott end up getting 2HKOed or burned. Fire Blast is Volcanion's best move for Grass-types such as Meowscarada, Amoonguss, and Tera Grass Galarian Slowking. Earth Power helps immensely with Toxapex, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking. Sludge Bomb hits Azumarill and Tera Grass Heatran while crippling foes like Rotom-W more than burn, while Tera Blast Fairy can hit many Dragon types such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon as well as Pokemon like Assault Vest Hisuian Samurott. Tera Fairy also makes Volcanion immune to Dragon-type moves, negating both of Walking Wake's STAB types, and removes all of Volcanion's weaknesses, particularly to Ground-type attacks such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu and Landorus-T's Earthquake. Tera Fairy also allows Volcanion to resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch, making it a great revenge killing option. Tera Water and Tera Fire make Steam Eruption and Fire Blast even stronger, allowing Volcanion to muscle through Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and even 2HKO physically defensive Toxapex. Its main counters are Tera Water Galarian Slowking and Water Absorb or Tera Water Clodsire, alongside Blissey. Volcanion appreciates support from wallbreakers that can deal with these threats or wear them down, such as Black Glasses Kingambit and mixed Iron Valiant. Kingambit in particular loves Choice Specs Volcanion's matchup against Fire-types like Cinderace, Moltres, and Heatran. In turn, Kingambit has a good matchup versus the aforementioned counters and can help pressure other checks such as Toxapex. Dragapult can also be a great partner, as it provides pivoting and speed control along with adding pressure on said counters and checks and has the option to provide great support with Thunder Wave. Great Tusk is another great option, as it can provide hazard removal, which is crucial for Volcanion. It is also a great blanket check for physical attackers that threaten Volcanion, and it provides Knock Off support, making it one of the best defensive partners for Volcanion. Volcanion also fits great on VoltTurn teams, as it loves being brought in as many times as possible by Pokemon such as Cinderace, Dragapult, and Rotom-W.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Volcanion's unique Water / Fire typing allows it to be a very threatening wallbreaker on balance and bulky offense teams with strong defensive utility, capable of checking threats such as Tapu Fini, Cinderace, Scizor, and Clefable while also pressuring the likes of Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Celesteela. Steam Eruption, in addition to being a powerful STAB option, is also very useful at spreading burns in order to weaken potential checks such as Mega Venusaur and Slowking. Sludge Bomb is used in order to break Clefable and Tapu Fini while also heavily damaging switch-ins such as Mega Latias and Hydreigon with a chance to poison them. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be used in order to combat Slowbro and Gastrodon that would otherwise easily switch into Volcanion. Volcanion also offers some utility with Defog, being able to use its offensive capabilities to force out common entry hazard setters such as Mega Tyranitar, Skarmory, and Hippowdon and clear hazards as they flee. Taunt is another utility option that allows Volcanion to shut down the likes of Calm Mind Clefable and Tapu Fini more efficiently while also preventing Slowking and Slowbro from using Teleport and Slack Off. Alternatively, Volcanion can forego its utility options in exchange for Earth Power in order to target threats such as Hisuian Goodra and Iron Hands. Heavy-Duty Boots is Volcanion's main item of choice in order to avoid damage from entry hazards, but it can also run Shuca Berry on more offensive playstyles in order to lure threats attempting to use Ground-type attacks against it, such as Excadrill and Enamorus. Wallbreakers like Hydreigon and Galarian Zapdos make for a solid offensive core with Volcanion, as Volcanion can switch into and pressure their checks in Clefable and Celesteela while they handle its checks in Slowking and Mega Venusaur. Physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl also enjoy Volcanion's Water-type immunity, allowing it to absorb Scald from the likes of Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Gastrodon. Volcanion is capable of pressuring a ton of offensive threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Sandy Shocks, as they are unable to switch into it properly, but unfortunately the inverse can also be said for it, since its mediocre Speed leaves it outpaced by the aforementioned threats and others, such as Iron Moth and Latios. To mitigate this, speed control options such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Enamorus are vital in order to force them out more easily. In return, Volcanion can provide a switch-in to Cinderace and Tapu Fini for them while also pressuring defensive checks such as Amoonguss and Celesteela. Volcanion hates dealing with offensive Ground-types such as Excadrill and Sandy Shocks due to its inability to switch into them, so partners like Skarmory are very useful at keeping them at bay. In return, Volcanion can handle threats that would try to take advantage of Skarmory such as Aegislash and Tapu Fini. Electric-types such as Iron Hands, Thundurus, and Zeraora are also incredibly annoying for Volcanion, so partners such as Gastrodon, Mega Latias, Mega Venusaur, and Tangrowth are good at handling them. In return, Volcanion can pressure threats such as Amoonguss and Celesteela for them. Although Volcanion can beat Rock-types in theory, Tyranitar, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Aerodactyl can pressure it really easily if on the field. Partners such as Iron Hands and Scizor are great at forcing them out, and in return, Volcanion can deal with Iron Defense Skarmory and Amoonguss for them. Dragon-type wallbreakers such as Hydreigon and Salamence can also take advantage of Volcanion by merit of resisting both its STAB moves. Partners such as Celesteela, Clefable, and Mega Tyranitar can effectively force them out for Hydreigon.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Volcanion is a useful Pokemon on Fire teams mainly thanks to its ability, Water Absorb, offering the type an immunity to one of its most common weaknesses. Steam Eruption is Volcanion's preferred Water-type move, with it being able to burn its switch-ins like Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Iron Hands, reducing their overall longevity. Earth Power allows Volcanion to threaten opposing Volcanion, Toxapex, and Heatran. Sludge Bomb allows Volcanion to revenge kill Azumarill after a Belly Drum and threaten other Fairy-type Pokemon like Hatterene and Enamorus. It is also able to target Walking Wake and Rotom-W, which resist Volcanion's STAB attacks, potentially crippling them thanks to the 30% poison chance. Flamethrower is preferred over Fire Blast since it doesn't miss, and the reduced damage is not too significant if Volcanion is under sun, but Fire Blast can be used in order to 2HKO Hisuian Goodra under sun. 96 Speed EVs let Volcanion outspeed Adamant Azumarill in order to revenge kill it with Sludge Bomb, and the rest of the EVs are put in HP to improve Volcanion's overall bulk.</p> <p>Torkoal is a solid partner for Volcanion that assists it with Stealth Rock support, chipping down its switch-ins like Rotom-W and Alolan Muk and working well in conjunction with Steam Eruption's burn chance. Torkoal can also use Rapid Spin to clear away entry hazards for Volcanion if its Heavy-Duty Boots get removed by Alolan Muk or Meowscarada. Furthermore, Torkoal provides Volcanion with sun thanks to Drought, which boosts Volcanion's Fire-type attacks. In return, Volcanion can switch into Water attacks from Barraskewda and Pelipper, which threaten Torkoal. Scovillain helps out Volcanion by threatening Water-immune Pokemon like Clodsire and Gastrodon, and its damage onto the former allows Volcanion to revenge kill it and proceed to threaten slower Ground-types like Quagsire and Ting-Lu. Cinderace is able to threaten Hisuian Goodra with Libero High Jump Kick, whose Assault Vest set easily shrugs off Earth Power from Volcanion and chips it down with Draco Meteor. Cinderace can also steal dual screens from Klefki with Court Change in the Fairy matchup, which supplement Volcanion's naturally good bulk, letting it take hits better. In return, Volcanion offers an answer to Belly Drum Azumarill and threatens Cinderace's defensive answers like Toxapex and Skeledirge. Choice Scarf Hisuian Arcanine offers a solution to handle opposing Dragon-types like Baxcalibur, which can use Volcanion as setup fodder, and also threatens Dragapult and non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Rotom-Heat provides an invaluable Ground immunity for Volcanion to avoid Earthquake from Pokemon like Iron Hands, Iron Treads, and Landorus-T and threatens all 3 of them with a burn from Will-O-Wisp. Rotom-H is also able to threaten defensive Water-types like Toxapex and offensive Water-types like Hisuian Samurott and Quaquaval if it opts for a Choice Scarf. Heatran can help Volcanion deal with Poison teams with its stallbreaker set, which allows it to trap and beat Pokemon like Toxapex one-on-one. Choice Scarf Iron Moth can revenge kill weakened Dragon-types like Walking Wake and Baxcalibur.</p>"

Weather Ball dissuades promient Desolate Land users that might want to switch in to Volcanion such as Cinderace and Iron Moth. Earth Power is a more reliable way to deal with Desolate Land users like Iron Moth and Heatran, and it's a reliable way to hit Hisuian Goodra without missing. Focus Blast 2HKOes a would-be check in RegenVest Roaring Moon, as well as Hisuian Goodra after Spikes chip. Volcanion pairs well with entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Garchomp, which help wear down common RegenVest Pokemon like Goodra and Hisuian Goodra, and hazards also guarantee a 2HKO on Meloetta. Due to Volcanion's Stealth Rock weakness it pairs well with hazard removers like Corviknight and Quaquaval, which can also help pivot it in safely.

Earth Power reliably threatens Toxapex and Desolate Land users such as Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Cinderace. Taunt can be used to hinder defensive walls with recovery such as Scream Tail and Quaquaval, while Will-O-Wisp is able to reliably burn switch-ins like defensive Quaquaval and Garchomp. Flame Charge is also a niche option to outspeed common revenge killers to Volcanion like Zapdos, Hisuian Arcanine, and Choice Band Galarian Zapdos. Magic Guard helps Volcanion with its weakness to entry hazards while also negating recoil from Flare Blitz and Life Orb. Offensive pivots such as Slither Wing and Iron Moth can bring Volcanion in against defensive cores featuring staples like Intimidate Corviknight and RegenVest users. Fast late-game cleaners like Chien-Pao and Regieleki also appreciate Volcanion's ability to weaken defensive checks like Quaquaval and common RegenVest users, which can allow them to take over games, while also providing speed control against faster threats to Volcanion like Zapdos, Hisuian Electrode, and Roaring Moon. Volcanion's susceptibility to being revenge killed by aformetioned threats makes defensive partners such as Corviknight and Meloetta essential, as they can tank hits and also help pivot to bring in Volcanion safely. Despite being immune to hazards, Volcanion still lacks recovery, so a teammate that can grant it longevity like Wish Scream Tail is also appreciated.</p>"

Thanks to Iron Fist and its strong STAB moves, Crabominable excels at pressuring walls like Misdreavus on the switch, Gogoat, and Whiscash, which can make it awkward for balance teams to play around. Earthquake hits Skuntank without triggering Aftermath and, after some chip damage, 2HKOes specially defensive Carbink, physically defensive Tinkatuff, and Mareanie. Close Combat is a secondary Fighting STAB option that's stronger than Drain Punch, but Thunder Punch is more reliable against Flying-types than Ice Hammer due to its higher accuracy. 60 Speed EVs allow Crabominable to outrun uninvested base 50s like Perrserker, Chansey, and Carbink. Tera Water helps against Fire-, Water-, and Steel-types like Pyroar, Basculin, and Alolan Dugtrio, all of which can otherwise overwhelm Crabominable. Tera Electric lets Crabominable take Electric-, Flying-, and Steel-type attacks from Pokemon like Rotom-F, Honchkrow, and Tera Steel Alolan Persian and is best used with Thunder Punch. Tera Ground gives Crabominable an Electric immunity, notably letting it block Volt Switch, and secures the OHKO on Skuntank with Earthquake. On teams with entry hazard control, Tera Fire can be considered to let Crabominable absorb Will-O-Wisp and thus more easily handle Misdreavus as well as Fire-types like Pyroar.</p> <p>Crabominable's main flaw is that its poor longevity can limit its ability to repeatedly handle special attackers; this is made worse with Crabominable being vulnerable to all hazards and tending to attack last. Entry hazard removers like Dartrix and Komala can give Crabominable an easier time switching in, with the latter not removing any hazards set by Crabominable's team. Wish support from the likes of Dachsbun and Leafeon is another way to keep Crabominable healthy, with the former also absorbing Fire-type moves from Pokemon like Misdreavus and Charizard. In return, Crabominable pressures Ice- and Steel-types like Rotom-F and Perrserker. Healing Wish Indeedee-F can similarly give Crabominable another chance to sponge hits or break if it gets worn down too quickly. Physical walls like Alolan Persian and Misdreavus can form a good defensive core with Crabominable and facilitate wallbreaking through moves like Parting Shot, Thunder Wave, and Will-O-Wisp. Fast Pokemon like Electrode, Dugtrio, and Choice Scarf Indeedee-F are good at compensating for Crabominable's bad matchup against offense and benefit from its ability to both tear through balance cores and trade with revenge killers like Choice Scarf Rotom-F. Fire- and Dark-types like Charizard and Skuntank can more reliably pressure Misdreavus for Crabominable and appreciate it wearing down bulky foes like Whiscash, Carbink, and Hisuian Sliggoo.</p>"

Swords Dance Scizor is another good teammate for Ribombee, as it appreciates being able to hit normally-faster threats that don't mind Bullet Punch, like Heatran and Walking Wake, hard thanks to Sticky Web not forcing it to rely on Bullet Punch for damage. In compensation, Scizor uses its Poison immunity to come in on threats such as Choice Scarf Sneasler that would otherwise threaten Ribombee and use them as a setup opportunity. It also removes Hatterene, which is invaluable to let Ribombee set up Sticky Web. Slither Wing is another great teammate, as it removes common Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon that Ribombee wouldn't be able to do much against. Forretress can keep hazards off of the field to enhance Ribombee's late-game sweeping potential and preserve its Focus Sash while being able to set hazards itself and take on threats such as Kingambit with Body Press. It also, similarly to Kleavor, can add to the hazard pressure by setting Spikes. Volcarona benefits greatly from Sticky Web, as after one Quiver Dance, it outspeeds Choice Scarf users that would otherwise attempt to revenge kill it, such as Roaring Moon and Urshifu-R. Ribombee, in turn, appreciates the fact that Volcarona can switch in on threats such as Gholdengo and stay healthy while being able to hit Steel-types with a strong Fiery Dance. Lokix can clean teams weakened by Ribombee thanks to its strong U-turn and First Impression while hitting Ghost-types such as Skeledirge and Gholdengo that pose large roadblocks for Bug teams and amplifying the effects of Sticky Web with Knock Off. In exchange, Lokix appreciates being able to outspeed common threats such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane under Sticky Web. Heracross can, in a similar vein to Slither Wing, deal with Steel-types such as Heatran and Kingambit while also using Knock Off to both remove key items from defensive behemoths such as Toxapex and increase the effects of Sticky Web on the opposing team. It appreciates Sticky Web to patch up its lackluster Speed. Finally, Frosmoth is another Quiver Dance user that has massive special bulk thanks to Ice Scales that also appreciates Sticky Web patching up its low Speed.</p>"

Stun Spore is used to cripple Pokemon that can otherwise use Ribombee as setup fodder such as Arceus formes and Zacian-C.

Teammates such as Koraidon, Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, Arceus-Ground, Extreme Killer Arceus, Miraidon, and Eternatus benefit heavily from Sticky Web being up, as it makes them much more difficult to revenge kill, with some such as Zacian-C and Eternatus also providing utility by blocking Mortal Spin from Glimmora and setting up Toxic Spikes, respectively. As Ribombee gets shut down by Taunt from Calyrex-S and Miraidon, offensive checks to them such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Arceus-Ground are preferred as teammates.

An excellent ability combined with a STAB priority move in Accelerock allows Lycanroc-D to revenge kill foes that greatly threaten Rock teams like Chien-Pao, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Shell Smash Cloyster. With Choice Band, Stone Edge  2HKOes Corviknight. Close Combat deals with Normal-, Rock-, Dark- and Steel-types like Ursaluna, Tyranitar, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Hisuian Goodra. Psychic Fangs not only breaks screens in the Fairy matchup, but it also deals with Fighting- and Poison-types like Urshifu-R, Great Tusk, Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Play Rough is another option to deal with Dragon- and Dark- types like Walking Wake, Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Sableye.</p> <p>Garganacl pairs well with Lycanroc-D, as Salt Cure wears down defensive Pokemon Lycanroc-D struggles with such as Quagsire and Corviknight. In return, Garganacl benefits from Lycanroc-D's ability to remove wallbreakers such as Walking Wake and Urshifu-R which threaten Garganacl's Iron Defense + Body Press set. Tyranitar is an essential teammate as it sets up sand to further chip down walls and checks threats like Flutter Mane, Espathra, and Kingambit due to its sheer bulk and great coverage in Heavy Slam, Crunch, and Low Kick. Hisuian Arcanine's wallbreaking power covers walls that are harder for Lycanroc-D to take down, dealing with Toxapex and Corviknight with Head Smash and Flare Blitz, respectively. Kleavor is a great lead, as Stone Axe sets up Stealth Rock to break through any opposing Focus Sash, allowing Lycanroc-D and Hisuian Arcanine to clean teams more easily. It can also pivot into Lycanroc-D with U-turn, luring in foes like Toxapex, Iron Treads, and Heatran in the process.  Choice item Glimmora's colorful moveset helps against walls like Quagsire and Toxapex through the use of Energy Ball and Earth Power, with Choice Scarf allowing Glimmora to outspeed and take down fast offensive threats such as Iron Valiant and Greninja if they aren't running Choice Scarf. Coalossal removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin, checks Scizor, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit with Flamethrower and Body Press, and can burn threats with Flame Body. Iron Defense + Calm Mind Diancie can check Garchomp with Moonblast. Shell Smash Air Balloon Drednaw provides a temporary Ground-type immunity and appreciates defensive walls being worn down by Lycanroc-D. In return, it readily cleans weakened Flying and Ground teams, eliminating threats like Landorus-T and Great Tusk.</p>"

It can switch into and counter Pokemon like Cinderace and Greninja, scout for Choice item users like Dragapult, Breloom, and Iron Valiant, and absorb Toxic Spikes from Glimmora and opposing Toxapex. Surf forces damage onto Toxic-immune foes such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, Iron Moth, and Kingambit. Toxic shuts down Pokemon such as Dragonite, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W, and if Toxapex should run Toxic Spikes, it matches up well against offensive teams that contain setup sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk. Any attempts of boosting past Toxapex gets shut down easily by Haze, which combined with poison damage prevents Toxapex from being used as setup fodder by Pokemon such as Calm Mind Hatterene. Covert Cloak is an option to ignore Garganacl's Salt Cure, Dragapult and Gholdengo's Shadow Ball drops, and Greninja's Dark Pulse flinches, but Leftovers's longevity reduces Toxapex's reliance on Recover, and it is used over Black Sludge in case Toxapex decides to Terastallize. Tera Steel improves Toxapex's matchup against non-Earthquake Roaring Moon and Meowscarada while still maintaining an immunity to poison. Alternatively, Tera Fairy fares better against Dragapult, Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. The given EVs allow Toxapex to survive two Choice Band Meowscarada's Flower Trick from full health.</p> <p>Toxapex fits nicely on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate a sturdy defensive backbone. Teammates like Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl are terrific defensive partners that covers Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Tera Electric Iron Valiant, respectively. Corviknight and Great Tusk in particular provide a backup check to multiple combinations of physical attackers like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Kingambit that attempt to overwhelm Toxapex. They also remove entry hazards, which would mitigate Toxapex's Regenerator and force it to use Recover more often; in return, Toxapex covers Pokemon such as Cinderace for the former and Greninja for the latter. Bulky setup sweepers like Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo can take advantage of Toxic Spikes slowly chipping down checks such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Particularly, Skeledirge and Gholdengo can make use of Hex easily to take advantage of Toxapex spreading poison, as well as threaten Hatterene, which can block Toxapex's Toxic Spikes and use non-Haze variants as setup fodder. Offensive partners like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit compensate for Toxapex's overall passivity; in return, they appreciate Toxapex switching into their revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Scizor, and Iron Valiant, respectively.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Assault Vest allows Toxapex to maximize its Special Attack EVs, letting it turn the tables on offensive Pokemon looking to exploit its passivity with Taunt or Substitute, while retaining excellent special bulk to check threats such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Walking Wake, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant. Surf does a solid chunk of damage to common Toxapex switch-ins like Kingambit, physically defensive Corviknight, and Gholdengo and often 2HKOes Garganacl after Stealth Rock. Sludge Bomb has good coverage alongside it, dealing heavy damage to Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Azumarill while breaking Hydreigon's Substitute. Sludge Bomb's high chance to poison can be critical for crippling Rotom-W and Slowking in the long term. Infestation provides a nice source of chip damage while letting Toxapex trap and beat defensive threats, such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Clodsire, in conjunction with Acid Spray. Furthermore, Infestation prevents the opponent from double switching on Toxapex, enabling much safer plays. Instead of Acid Spray, Ice Beam works to offer more immediate damage against Clodsire, Dragonite, Dragapult, and Amoonguss. Tera Blast, with Tera Fighting, is also viable to nab surprise KOs on Kingambit and Roaring Moon, which might otherwise set up on it. However, Fairy is the most standard Tera type for Toxapex, allowing it to block Dragon-type attacks from Dragapult and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Toxapex fits best on balance and bulky teams that appreciate its unique combination of bulk and power. Assault Vest Toxapex likes to pivot around aggressively and spread chip damage, thanks in part to Regenerator: entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu can help it pressure opposing teams more, punishing opponents for switching out against it. Without either Haze or Toxic, Toxapex is vulnerable to setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon, so Unaware Pokemon such as Dondozo and Skeledirge are excellent teammates. Since Assault Vest Toxapex's physical bulk is rather lacking, physically defensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Corviknight can offer much-needed switch-ins to the likes of Kingambit and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Toxapex can often struggle to make progress against bulkier teams due to its middling power and lack of Toxic, so it appreciates strong balance wallbreakers like Iron Valiant. Hydreigon deserves special mention as an excellent teammate, sharing near-perfect type synergy with Toxapex. Hydreigon checks key threats to Toxapex such as Armarouge, Kingambit, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and it can set up on bulkier Pokemon like defensive Great Tusk and Clodsire. In return, Toxapex can check Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Greninja, which can threaten Hydreigon. Finally, Scream Tail is also a great partner, using Wish to extend Toxapex's longevity and having solid defensive synergy with it.</p>"

Its typing in particular allows it to check common Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Urshifu-R while its utility moves like Knock Off and Toxic let it cripple them to benefit teammates. Scald can cripple physical attackers like Garchomp and Mega Medicham, discouraging them from directly switching in to take advantage of Toxapex. Scald’s damage output reduces Toxapex's passivity and is also just enough to threaten Water-weak foes like Landorus-T, Iron Boulder, and Mega Diancie; this allows Toxapex to use Recover or Toxic with general safety. Knock Off allows Toxapex to remove valuable items like Choice items, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Leftovers from switch-ins like Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and Ferrothorn. Toxic Spikes allows Toxapex to pressure offensive teams, forcing them to give up momentum to clear it lest they get poisoned. Haze prevents setup sweepers like Gouging Fire and Iron Valiant from exploiting Toxapex, forcing them to attack, and disrupts wincons like IronPress Zamazenta and Volcarona. An EV spread of 248 HP / 212 Def / 48 SpD with a Bold nature allows Toxapex to maximize its physical bulk while surviving two Scorching Sands from Mega Charizard Y. On the other hand, 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature simply maximizes special bulk. 248 HP EVs are important as it reduces entry hazard damage while benefiting more from Regenerator. Tera Dragon is useful to check Ogerpon-W and Mega Charizard Y, the latter of which is especially important on specially defensive sets, Tera Fairy helps versus Raging Bolt and Garchomp, and Tera Steel lets it check Serperior and Tapu Lele. The former two are also notable for removing Toxapex’s Ground weakness versus the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Toxapex, by nature of being a fat wall with little offensive presence, fits like a glove on stall and balance playstyles, sapping momentum but providing valuable utility. Allies on balance that can take advantage of Toxapex through double switches, like Ogerpon-W, Urshifu-R, and Mega Tyranitar, benefit from Toxapex baiting in Ground- and Psychic-types; by using Toxapex as a mid-ground, they can enter the field safely as the opponent switches to a Toxapex check like Gliscor and Choice item Tapu Lele. Teammates that help with the Ground and Psychic weaknesses on the defensive side, such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, are useful as well; in return, Toxapex tanks hits from Ice- and Fighting-types like Weavile, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny for them.</p>"

Surf is an alternative to Chilling Water thanks to its higher damage output, which lets Toxapex threaten to OHKO threats like Hisuian Arcanine after minimal chip damage and is better off against threats that don't care for their attack being lowered, such as Moltres. Haze removes the buffs from sweepers, including Ceruledge, Mimikyu, and Kingambit. Toxapex has three notable options for its second support move: Toxic Spikes to complete Poison's entry hazard stacking core and puts teams on a timer; Baneful Bunker to allow Toxapex to scout opponents, poison contact attackers such as Chien-Pao, and heal with Black Sludge; and Infestation to trap opponents that don't threaten Toxapex such as Alolan Muk and Klefki. Infestation can also be ran as instead of a Water STAB move with Baneful Bunker or Toxic to trap and waste away the plentiful contact attackers.</p> <p>Alolan Muk serves as a great teammate for Toxapex, being a special tank able to take on many of the special Psychic- and Ghost-types that threaten Toxapex, like Espathra, Galarian Slowking, Flutter Mane, and Gholdengo. Overqwil, while not as specially bulky as Alolan Muk, can also deter Psychic- and Ghost-types, soft check physical Iron Valiant and check physical Dragapult thanks to Intimidate, and benefit much more from Toxic Spikes with Barb Barrage. Amoonguss is a second Regenerator physical wall with a neutrality to Ground and resistance to Electric able to combat many Pokemon that threaten Toxapex such as Great Tusk, Quagsire, Rotom-W and Regieleki. Clodsire is an Unaware special wall immune to Electric that checks attack threats like Regieleki and Magnezone along with special setup Pokemon like Volcarona and Hydreigon. Air Balloon Glimmora can support Toxapex by removing entry hazards from the field for non-Heavy-Duty Boots sets, being temporarily immune to Ground with Air Balloon, and using Corrosion Toxic to put threats Toxapex majorly dislikes such as opposing Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra and Heatran on timers. Corrosion Salazzle can also provide Corrosion Toxic support along with using Encore to mess up Pokemon that view Toxapex as a setup opportunity like Kingambit. Sneasler can also be used to punch holes through teams thanks to its powerful STAB Close Combat, which can KO threats like Iron Treads and Baxcalibur, while Toxapex can come in and absorb damage for Sneasler and wear foes down with Infestation and Toxic Spikes.</p>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With the rise of powerful defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Dragonite, Toxapex stands out as a masterful spreader of poison to support its teammates!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic is the most reliable way to spread the deadliest version of poison and is especially effective against Taunt users like Annihilape if using Mental Herb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Toxic Spikes makes the team less reliant on Toxapex to spread status directly, and acts as excellent support for stalling teammates like Ting-Lu, Dragonite and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Haze</strong>: Even with Toxapex's great bulk, powerful setup sweepers like Chien-Pao and Dragonite quickly get out of control for it, so Haze is the best solution to prevent Toxapex from being setup bait.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Liquidation versus Chilling Water</strong>: Liqudation isn't particularly strong but it allows Toxapex to 2HKO Chi-Yu and is the best option for breaking Substitute against targets like Flutter Mane. Chilling Water with a Bold or Impish nature gives Toxapex another tool against physical sweepers, but makes it much more vulnerable to Substitute in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Baneful Bunker</strong>: If using Black Sludge or Leftovers, Baneful Bunker is a fantastic way to spread poison against physical attackers and get some extra recovery with one moveslot, but keep in mind that this won't work against Urshifu-R. It's also key for scouting dangerous uses of Trick from the likes of Gholdengo and Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Physically Defensive versus Specially Defensive</strong>: Physically defensive Toxapex does well against some hard-to-check threats, such as Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao. Specially defensive Toxapex, on the other hand, has a better shot of beating Heatran and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Infestation</strong>: Infestation is Toxapex's best chance of doing chip damage to Toxic-immune threats, such as Corviknignt and Gholdengo, and the trapping works fairly well against foes that do have problems with Toxic. It also prevents double switching from being an issue for Toxapex.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization can help Toxapex beat a new set of threats, its bulk and good defensive typing usually makes it a rare occurrence compared to its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Besides making Toxapex far less vulnerable to Electric, which some foes like Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur may Terastallize into, Tera Poison retains the ability to restore health with Black Sludge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy removes all of Toxapex's weaknesses and can save it from taking massive damage from Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse. It also does well against powerful Dragon-type attacks such as Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage and Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass can prevent Breloom and Amoonguss from being disastrous with Spore, in addition to doing well against Rotom-W. It also gives an important Ground-type resistance against targets such as Ting-Lu and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While Normal isn't an impressive defensive type, Tera Normal can punish Choice locked Ghost-types, such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: While the Stealth Rock weakness can be an issue, Tera Bug is a niche way to resist Ground-type attacks while being neutral to both Ice- and Electric-type moves, unlike other methods.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying not only protects Toxapex from its irritating Ground-type weakness but also means bulky users of Fissure, such as Dondozo and Ting-Lu, will no longer pressure Toxapex. However, this typing makes Toxapex much worse into general offense.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Black Sludge versus Leftovers</strong>: Having passive healing is wonderful, especially with Baneful Bunker. Black Sludge is a clever way to get around Item Clause, but Leftovers gives Toxapex more freedom in choosing its Tera type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: While Urshifu-R often has contact protection, other physical attackers such as Chien-Pao can be gradually worn down through Rocky Helmet chip.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: With Mental Herb providing one-time protection from Taunt, Toxapex can surprise foes like Annihilape and Ting-Lu with Toxic, which is especially helpful if not running an attack.</p> </li> </ul>"

Prankster + Haze, on the other hand, is an excellent tool to frustrate hyper offense teams and stop dangerous setup sweepers like Chien-Pao, Polteageist, and Chesnaught. While the consistent recovery of Black Sludge is generally preferred, Rocky Helmet allows Toxapex to annoy non-Magic Guard Galarian Zapdos and Chien-Pao even when it is forced to use Recover. Toxapex is utterly unable to threaten most Magic Guard users, like Galarian Zapdos and especially Water-resistant ones like Hisuian Electrode and Quaquaval, so reliable checks to them like Hisuian Goodra and Fluffy Corviknight are recommended. Toxic Spikes variants appreciate spinners like Iron Treads, as they can provide entry hazard removal without removing Toxic Spikes as well. Toxapex can easily be overwhelmed by multiple attackers, so it should always have a secondary physically defensive teammate, especially one that handles Ground-types, like Intimidate Corviknight; this also relieves some of the pressure off of Toxapex of checking pivots without Regenerator.</p>"

Poison Jab threatens Fairy- and Grass-types like Tapu Bulu, Iron Valiant, and Rillaboom. Toxic Spikes enhances offensive teammates such as Barraskewda, Mega Swampert, and Greninja, while Toxic lessens Toxapex's passivity, putting Gastrodon, Tornadus-T, and Mega Altaria on a timer. Haze allows Toxapex to shut down setup sweepers like Mega Scizor, Mimikyu, and Mega Altaria. Knock Off bothers item-reliant walls such as Porygon2, Galarian Corsola, and Celesteela. Black Sludge allows Toxapex to outlast tankier foes with the help of chip damage from Toxic Spikes and Toxic, while Heavy-Duty Boots enables it as a pivot, letting it sponge attacks without worrying about entry hazards. Teammates appreciate Toxapex absorbing Toxic Spikes and fighting off Grass-types like Meowscarada and Breloom. Toxapex appreciates Slowking and Rotom-W taking Psychic- and Ground-type moves, respectively. Mega Swampert switches into Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Magnezone and threatens Poison-types like opposing Toxapex, Clodsire, and Nidoking. Gastrodon forms a great defensive core with Toxapex, taking on the aforementioned Electric-types and providing entry hazards to further chip down pivots such as Meowscarada, Mega Lopunny, and Iron Moth. Greninja checks Ground-types like Clodsire, Garchomp, and Landorus and aids in the Flying matchup. Urshifu-R checks Pokemon like Kyurem and Hydreigon, which take advantage of Toxapex. Pelipper provides a Ground immunity against Landorus-T, Iron Treads, and Great Tusk and synergizes well with Toxapex against Grass teams.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Toxapex is a main-stay on Poison teams due to its defensive typing, impeccable ability, ridiculous bulk, and utility moves like Toxic, Knock Off, and Haze. Scald allows Toxapex to spread burns on physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Mega Scizor. Toxic puts threats like Rotom-W, Baxcalibur, and Urshifu-R on a timer and spreads chip damage on offensive teams like Dragon, Psychic, and Fire. Knock Off is another great option to bother Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Celesteela. Haze, paired with Icium Z, shuts down setup sweepers like Z-Happy Hour Jirachi and Clangorous Soulblaze Kommo-o, immediately regaining its health to continue walling them. Toxic Spikes are an option instead of Toxic or Knock Off; however, Toxapex has other teammates capable of setting them up and it increases Toxapex's passivity. The given EV spread avoids an OHKO from +1 SpA Jirachi's Psychic, allowing Toxapex to activate its Z-Crystal. Mega Venusaur and Crobat are excellent teammates due to their Ground-type neutrality and immunity, respectively, checking Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Mamoswine, while the former also threatens Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire. Due to Toxapex's Psychic-type weakness, Alolan Muk and Galarian Slowking are notable teammates, checking Tapu Lele, Deoxys-S, and Latias; Galarian Slowking, in particular, forms a very strong Regenerator core with Toxapex. Clodsire and Nidoking patch up Toxapex's Electric-type weakness, and Nidoking specifically threatens Steel teams with its wide array of coverage. Galarian Weezing provides another Ground-type immunity and removes entry hazards with Defog as well as serving as a concrete answer to Baxcalibur. Sneasler appreciates Toxapex's ability to chip down foes, offering more opportunities for setup. Iron Moth threatens Steel-types like Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Gholdengo, which are otherwise difficult to break for Poison teams.</p>"

Haze stops Pokemon like Swords Dance Arceus and Zacian-C from setting up and easily beating Toxapex. Infestation chips away at foes immune to Toxic, like Zacian-C, while Poison Jab hits Taunt Arceus-Fairy for decent damage and threatens to inflict it with poison. Baneful Bunker is a more niche option for the second moveslot that potentially poisons foes like Koraidon and Arceus at the risk of letting them set up. Toxic is more immediately threatening, but Toxic Spikes can potentially aid offensive teammates and annoy teams in the long term. Rocky Helmet punishes Koraidon for spamming U-turn and gives non-Infestation Toxapex a way of damaging Zacian-C. Tera Fairy provides an immunity to Koraidon's Scale Shot and Outrage and removes Toxapex's weakness to Ground-type moves from foes like Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground. Toxapex is primarily useful on balance teams, where Pokemon like Calyrex-S, Arceus, Arceus-Fairy, Miraidon, and Zacian-C benefit from it being able to switch into opposing Arceus, Zacian-C, and Choice Scarf Koraidon. Choice Specs Calyrex-S is an especially good teammate for Toxic Spikes Toxapex, as it threatens foes that can absorb Toxic Spikes, like Eternatus and opposing Toxapex, and can use Trick to remove a Pokemon's Heavy-Duty Boots. Arceus-Ground similarly threatens Poison-types, and it wears down the only relevant Defog user, Giratina-O. Arceus is also worth highlighting for its ability to check Calyrex-S and revenge kill weakened Scale Shot Koraidon. Ting-Lu appreciates Toxapex checking strong physical attackers, and it checks Calyrex-S, Miraidon, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground for it in return. Choice Scarf Koraidon can revenge kill the Pokemon Ting-Lu checks as well as Wild Charge Zacian-C and Taunt Arceus, which Toxapex loses to.</p>"

With Salazzle's high Speed, Encore can prevent threats like Sinistcha, Ursaluna-B, Okidogi, and Hydreigon from setting up, as well as lock Kingambit into Sucker Punch or Swords Dance. Substitute paired with Black Sludge can allow Salazzle to accumulate Toxic damage on slower threats like Hisuian Goodra, along with finding repeated chances to safely set up Substitutes against foes that cannot break through them like Galarian Weezing and Amoonguss to effortlessly spread Toxic.

Amoonguss helps to force out pesky Ground- and Water-types like Great Tusk, Gastrodon, and Ogerpon-W with Giga Drain and Foul Play. It can also use Spore to allow Salazzle safe entry to get up a free Substitute, while in return Amoonguss appreciates the removal of Steel-types like Gholdengo and Corviknight, which can use it as setup fodder. With its immense physical bulk and access to STAB Surf and Haze, Toxapex can deal with threats such as Chien-Pao, Scizor, and Kleavor, while Salazzle limits foes like Articuno and Thundurus-T that majorly threaten Toxapex. Unaware Clodsire checks special setup sweepers like Kommo-o and Volcarona while also providing additional chip damage with Stealth Rock. Alolan Muk's superb special bulk and access to Knock Off and Poison Jab allow it to easily handle Ghost-type threats that force Salazzle out like Flutter Mane and Hisuian Zoroark. Overqwil, while not as specially bulky, can still serve as a solid Psychic- and Ghost-type response and works much better against threats like Gallade, Ceruledge, and Dragapult thanks to its high physical bulk and Intimidate. Galarian Slowking can create Future Sight traps to force in the team's opposing Dark-type or special walls like Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra, which Salazzle can take advantage of by getting in safely to either land a Toxic or set up a Substitute. Galarian Slowking also helps Salazzle by dealing with deadly special attackers like Volcanion, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake. Okidogi majorly appreciates Salazzle's Toxic shutting down bulky walls like Skeledirge, Quagsire, and Galarian Weezing by putting them on timers, and in return Okidogi handles threats like Heatran, Garganacl, and Kingambit with Drain Punch. Sneasler can use U-turn to bring Salazzle in on walls like Amoonguss, Klefki, and Toxapex and use them as an opportunity to get up a Substitute or land a critical Toxic. Meanwhile, Sneasler removes threats like Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit. Choice Specs Icy Wind Gengar helps majorly in removing Gliscor, which can effortlessly switch into Salazzle thanks to Poison Heal.

Play Rough is Mimikyu's strongest STAB move and allows Mimikyu to secure an OHKO on Iron Hands after a Swords Dance and also deals with bulky Great Tusk. Shadow Sneak lets Mimikyu revenge kill weakened offensive threats like Iron Moth and faster Ghost-type Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult. Shadow Claw lets Mimikyu break past bulkier Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Skeledirge more readily compared to Shadow Sneak, while Drain Punch is an alternative that threatens opposing Steel-types such as Magnezone and Kingambit. Mimikyu's preferred item is Life Orb to boost its damage output as much as possible.</p> <p>One of Mimikyu's best partners on Fairy teams is Klefki. Mimikyu appreciates Spikes from Klefki, which allows Mimikyu to take down Pokemon easier after a Swords Dance boost. In return, Mimikyu can block Rapid Spin, allowing Klefki's hazards to stay up during the course of the game. Flutter Mane is often paired with Mimikyu since it can threaten physically defensive pokemon that give Mimikyu a hard time like Amoonguss, Quagsire, and Forretress and also faster offensive threats like Iron Moth and Kilowattrel. Mimikyu is able to break through specially defensive Pokemon like Dragalge which gives Flutter Mane an easier time. Hatterene is also a good partner for Mimikyu, as it can bounce back debilitating status conditions like Will-O-Wisp from Sableye and Thunder Wave from Klefki and also bounces back hazards, which helps with Mimikyu's longevity since it runs Life Orb. Furthermore, Mimikyu with its Disguise up can check opposing Ghost-type Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Iron Valiant is also one of Mimikyu's best offensive teammates, as special sets are able to threaten other physically defensive Pokemon like Dondozo. Additionally, Iron Valiant is useful for Mimikyu in the Ground matchup, where a Choice Specs set can check answers to Mimikyu, such as Quagsire and Clodsire, using Psyshock.

Swords Dance can further take advantage of Disguise. Play Rough threatens Dark- and Fighting-types such as Meowscarada, Krookodile, and Quaquaval. Shadow Sneak picks off faster threats that could otherwise revenge kill Mimikyu, such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane. Drain Punch helps against Steel-types like Kingambit and offers some recovery—Disguise's recoil, entry hazards, and Life Orb damage can wear Mimikyu down pretty easily. Wood Hammer can potentially be used over Drain Punch to hit Pokemon such as Quagsire better, but the recoil damage isn't appreciated. Mimikyu's mediocre Attack forces it to use Life Orb to significantly damage neutral targets.</p> <p>All of Mimikyu's teammates appreciate its ability to take on Dark-type teams. Froslass and Brambleghast can place Spikes to help Mimikyu clean up and use Taunt or Rapid Spin, respectively, so opposing entry hazards don't wear it down. Choice Scarf Flutter Mane helps Mimikyu against both Dark- and Dragon-type teams by taking down faster threats that could KO it after Disguise has been removed, such as Meowscarada and Chien-Pao, which resist Shadow Sneak. Nasty Plot Gholdengo deals with bulkier teams like Ground and Poison teams, as well as absorbing Toxic from bulky walls such as Toxapex. Furthermore, Gholdengo can also run Trick with a Choice item, which can cripple annoying walls such as Quagsire and Dondozo to help Mimikyu deal with them. Polteageist can clean up Poison teams after Skuntank is KOed, as well as Ground, Water, and Fighting teams. Spiritomb can tank some Dark-type attacks so that Mimikyu needn't waste Disguise's protection. Skeledirge can take some hits from foes like Iron Valiant and Dragalge for the same benefit. Dragapult can use a Dragon Dance set to boost against faster Pokemon that threaten Mimikyu, such as Iron Moth.</p>"

Clanging Scales is Kommo-o's best move for Pokemon like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Gliscor.

Its ability to set up on common Pokemon like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Volcarona and to potentially use Tera Steel to ignore Toxic from defensive Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex allows it to start wallbreaking very early with its powerful coverage. Throat Spray grants an extra Special Attack boost when using Clangorous Soul, whereas Kommonium Z gives it Clangorous Soulblaze, which allows it to deal heavy damage while boosting its stats. Boomburst lets Kommo-o neutrally hit much of the metagame for large damage, which, when coupled with STAB Clanging Scales and Flamethrower as coverage for Steel-types, can easily break cores featuring the likes of Great Tusk, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and more. Bulletproof along with Tera Steel allows Kommo-o to wall Choice Scarf Tapu Lele looking to revenge kill it as well as set up in front of Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult. Tera Normal gives Kommo-o a stronger Boomburst, while Tera Steel gives it a Toxic immunity and useful resistances to all of its weaknesses, allowing Kommo-o to take would-be checks, such as Dragapult, Tapu Lele, Baxcalibur, and Iron Valiant, by surprise and set up in front of them. However, Kommo-o likes to use its Tera and thus denies its teammates this option, and it can be checked by a well-timed Tera from Pokemon such as Tera Steel Garchomp and subsequently be revenge killed. It is also walled by the likes of Heatran, Garganacl, and Clodsire, which can tank its coverage options even without Terastallizing and cripple it with Toxic or Salt Cure or simply force it out and deny future setup opportunities. Finally, due to the nature of Kommo-o’s setup, it can only reasonably do so once per game, making Kommo-o more suited for offensive teams. Thus, having allies that can take care of Kommo-o’s defensive checks before it sets up can allow it to do its job much more effectively; physical attackers like Iron Valiant, offensive Landorus-T, and Samurott-H can pressure and remove checks for Kommo-o to break and potentially sweep. Hazard support is also valuable in preventing opponents from switching back and forth between Pokemon in a Regenerator core; in particular, Assault Vest Tornadus + Toxapex; Pokemon like Great Tusk and Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock to pressure switches.</p>"

Substitute also allows Kommo-o to dodge status moves like Ferrothorn’s Leech Seed, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Landorus-T's Toxic, and Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp that could potentially ruin Kommo-o’s sweep, instead giving it a free set up opportunity. Drain Punch is chosen over heavier hitting moves like Close Combat, as the extra damage is not needed, and Drain Punch can heal off the HP lost through Belly Drum and Substitute, making Kommo-o harder to revenge kill. Thunder Punch is used to dent and possibly KO common defensive tanks that can survive Drain Punch, like Skarmory, Toxapex, Tera Water Garganacl, Gholdengo, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Bulletproof stacked on top of Tera Steel allows Kommo-o to surprise opponents like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Specs Dragapult looking to revenge kill it. Although Soundproof blocks moves such as Roar from defensive Garchomp and Bug Buzz from Volcarona, it is generally not preferred due to the lack of relevant sound-based moves in comparison to the bevy of aforementioned qualities gained from Bulletproof. Tera Electric can power up Thunder Punch with STAB to score KOs on the likes of Gholdengo, Tapu Lele, and Tera Fairy Kingambit, while Tera Steel gives it useful resistances that may allow it to reach Salac Berry range without Substitute by tanking a resisted hit from the likes of Tapu Lele or Mega Diancie. Belly Drum Kommo-o fits on hyper offensive teams that appreciate its ability to sweep or clean up teams once its checks are removed. Therefore, it appreciates partners that can lure and remove Pokemon like Clodsire, Tera Grass Heatran, Gliscor, and Landorus-T that check it; Tapu Koko in particular is good, as it can run Hidden Power Ice to bait and KO the latter two and badly chip the former two potentially into Kommo-o’s range while also boosting the power of its Thunder Punch by setting Electric Terrain. Belly Drum Kommo-o also has trouble setting up, as it mainly uses the element of surprise to get up a Substitute —namely, it exploits the opponent's fear of Clangorous Soulblaze and thus forces them to switch. Thus, it appreciates dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl in order to more consistently set up Belly Drum.</p>"

Taunt is preferred to shut down phazers like Haze Toxapex and Hippowdon and bulky walls like Porygon2 and Clodsire, which can inconvenience Kommo-o with Toxic. Meanwhile, Clangorous Soul allows for more boosts and breaking power, notably enabling Clangorous Soulblaze to OHKO the aforementioned Hippowdon and Toxapex. Furthermore, Clangorous Soulblaze allows Kommo-o to set up on Fairy-types and Soundproof Pokemon like Alolan Ninetales, Trace Porygon2, and opposing Kommo-o. Soundproof prevents revenge killing attempts from Ditto or opposing Kommo-o, and a Naive nature permits Kommo-o to outpace Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Lopunny, and Zeraora after obtaining the omni-boost. Mega Altaria is a wonderful teammate, as it helps weaken and clean up opposing Dragon teams; In return, it appreciates Kommo-o dealing with the aforementioned Steel-types. Kyurem aids in matchups against Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Mantine, and Dragonite, as well as Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Tapu Fini, and Mega Altaria. Choice Scarf Latias and Roaring Moon provide speed control; the former offers healing and setup opportunities with Healing Wish, while the latter checks Psychic-types like Deoxys-S, Victini, and Latias. Garchomp offers entry hazards support to pressure and chip down Kommo-o's switch-ins and aids in the Steel matchup with Earthquake. Hisuian Goodra is a huge help in the Fairy matchup, taking on Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Mega Diancie. Mega Latios threatens Flying-type threats with its BoltBeam coverage; in addition, when paired with Garchomp, it puts a lot of pressure on Poison teams, which Kommo-o tends to struggle against. Cyclizar provides entry hazard control with Rapid Spin and extra protection for Kommo-o with Shed Tail, encouraging the use of Clangorous Soul over Taunt. Baxcalibur is excellent in the Dark and Flying matchups, dispatching threats like Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Enamorus with its Swords Dance or Dragon Dance set, and it also ravages Poison teams with Galarian Slowking, which Kommo-o might not be able to handle. In return, Kommo-o removes the aforementioned Steel- and Normal-types that can easily wall Baxcalibur or use it to reverse sweep, specifically Ditto.</p>"

Tapu Koko further boasts a good Speed tier and valuable Fairy-typing, rendering it a menacing threat in its own right. Dazzling Gleam levels the playing field in the Dragon matchup, eliminating foes such as Kommo-o, Roaring Moon, Baxcalibur, and Mega Altaria, but it's also useful against threats like Mega Lopunny and non-Choice Scarf Great Tusk. Grass Knot provides much needed coverage against troublesome Ground-types, most notably taking care of Swampert, Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Mamoswine. Volt Switch pairs wells with Tapu Koko's speed, allowing it to escape unfavorable matchups and bring in teammates like Zapdos against the likes of Mega Venusaur or Mega Scizor. Hidden Power Ice can be used to deal with Ground-types that aren't threatened by Grass Knot such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be run to increase Tapu Koko's damage output, giving it a chance to OHKO foes like Mega Diancie. Rotom-W and Zapdos are excellent partners to Tapu Koko, as they provide a necessary Ground immunity as well as Defog support, which allows Tapu Koko to pivot more freely. Rotom-W further helps by handling Ground-types and spreading burns to strong physical attackers like Mega Garchomp, Iron Valiant, Dragonite, and Mega Swampert in rain, while Zapdos walls and makes use of Heat Wave to deal with Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Iron Treads and Hurricane to counter pesky Grass- and Fighting-types like Tapu Bulu, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Gallade. Alolan Raichu's Surge Surfer fully capitalizes on Electric Terrain, turning it into a serious revenge killer, capable of outspeeding threats such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Mega Aerodactyl, and Iron Valiant under Quark Drive. Iron Hands and Zeraora are prominent partners for Tapu Koko complementing it as Physical breakers, both being able to take care of foes such as defensive Zapdos, Ursaluna and Alolan Muk which hinder Tapu Koko and other Special attackers. Iron Hands has more bulk and longevity, but Zeraora brings near unmatched Speed to the table. Both of them also appreciate Tapu Koko's ability to remove Mega Sableye and Skeledirge and luring in and critically damaging Landorus-Therian with Hidden Power Ice. Regieleki brings raw Electric-type power in the form of a boosted Rising Voltage, which is capable of sweeping teams that don't have an answer to it, and it also provides hazard removal thanks to Rapid Spin. Magnezone provides an immunity to Poison, which Tapu Koko appreciates, and more importantly traps and removes threats such as Mega Scizor and Excadrill with Hidden Power Fire.</p>"

Grass Knot hits foes such as Gastrodon, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Swampert, and it takes advantage of Tera Grass to potentially break Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam allows Tapu Koko to OHKO Mega Medicham and Weavile after Stealth Rock, and it dents other foes such as Tera Dragon Toxapex and Garchomp. Hidden Power Ice improves the matchup against Landorus-T and Gliscor while still hitting foes such as Garchomp, Tangrowth, and Dragonite. Tera Grass boosts the power of Grass Knot while granting Tapu Koko key resistances, allowing it to lure foes such as Barraskewda, Floatzel, and Mega Swampert, all while improving its matchup against Rotom-W. Tapu Koko must be careful when using Tera, however, as it becomes unable to safely switch into Tornadus-T once it Terastallizes. Pokemon that utilize Electric Terrain such as Iron Valiant, Iron Hands, and Mega Medicham make for excellent teammates, as it activates Quark Drive for the former two and increases the power of Thunder Punch for the latter, 2HKOing foes such as Gholdengo. Tapu Koko also forms strong pivoting cores with teammates like Tornadus-T and Mega Lopunny, which take advantage of its checks such as Ferrothorn and Clodsire to generate momentum. Wallbreakers such as Weavile, Urshifu-R, and Zamazenta also appreciate Tapu Koko letting them switch in against its checks for free, such as Assault Vest Tangrowth. In return, they beat foes such as the aforementioned Tangrowth, Clodsire and Ferrothorn.</p>"

Taunt denies Defog from foes such as Tornadus-T and Rotom-W while also denying entry hazards from foes such as Ferrothorn. It also prevents foes such as Dragonite and Volcarona from using Tapu Koko as setup fodder. U-turn allows Tapu Koko to generate momentum and pivot into teammates such as Volcarona and Dragapult after setting screens. Tapu Koko will very rarely use Tera since teammates such as Dragonite or Volcarona rely on it to be effective. In a pinch, however, Tera Flying offers a Ground immunity for foes such as Clodsire. Pokemon that take advantage of dual screens, such as Volcarona, Dragonite, and Dragapult, are good partners, as they allow them to set up safely and survive potential revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Kingambit, and Mega Scizor. Iron Valiant also benefits greatly from Tapu Koko setting Electric Terrain in addition to dual screens. Tapu Koko is also weak to Stealth Rock setters such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, and it can have difficulty denying entry hazards from them, so it appreciates teammates such as Dragonite and Gyarados pivoting in to Ground-type attacks from them.</p>"

Tapu Lele's presence also sets up Psychic Terrain, shielding itself and its team from dangerous priority such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. Focus Blast lets it easily take care of the pesky Steel-types that resist its STAB attacks such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Iron Treads. Future Sight lets Tapu Lele set up an attack for later and then switch out to a teammate such as Victini or Mega Gallade to help it set up or get a KO. Shadow Ball lets it beat Gholdengo and clean up against Psychic and Ghost teams, while Thunderbolt gives it general coverage versus foes like Mantine and Celesteela. Tapu Lele is often not able to beat specially defensive walls such as Alolan Muk and Blissey; hence, it appreciates partnering up with Mega Gallade to eliminate them. Mega Alakazam is a good partner, as it helps in the Electric and Water matchups courtesy of Trace copying Surge Surfer and Swift Swim, respectively, and it appreciates Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain boosting its Expanding Force. Slowbro sponges hits from faster Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Galarian Zapdos, and can also pivot Tapu Lele in with Teleport to wreak havoc. Victini and Armarouge can eliminate Steel-types, especially Aegislash and Gholdengo, easing the burden for Tapu Lele.

Additionally, Psychic Terrain blocks priority moves like Mega Lopunny's Fake Out and Weavile's Ice Shard, which is useful for Tapu Lele itself and teammates that aim for a sweep such as Hawlucha and Volcarona. Focus Blast lets Tapu Lele hit common Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Psyshock allows Tapu Lele to hit foes with weaker Defense stats like Assault Vest Tornadus-T and Volcarona, along with shutting down Calm Mind Tera Poison Cresselia. Future Sight can be used to hit in tandem with teammates such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta, threatening Toxapex and Zapdos looking to switch into their attacks. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire nails Mega Scizor along with hitting Ferrothorn more consistently than Focus Blast. Tera Psychic is the premier Tera option, as it boosts Tapu Lele's Psychic STAB attacks to ludicrous heights, smashing through most neutral targets such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko. Tera Fairy is a niche alternative, boosting Moonblast to powerful levels while minimizing the threat of Pursuit from Mega Tyranitar and Weavile. Despite having Focus Blast, Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn are still effective checks to Tapu Lele, so teammates such as Gliscor and Mega Lopunny can be used to mitigate this. Hawlucha can both utilize Psychic Terrain to activate Unburden while helping break through Mega Scizor, allowing Tapu Lele to clean up with ease late-game.</p>"

Psyshock can hit Galarian Slowking, 2HKO Chansey, and OHKO Assault Vest Tornadus-T. Future Sight can help teammates like Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny wallbreak, as it deals good damage to switch-ins like Alomomola, Toxapex, and Landorus-T. Late-game cleaners like Mega Lopunny, Volcarona, Urshifu-R, and Bulk Up Great Tusk really appreciate Tapu Lele's ability to force damage onto would-be checks such as Corviknight and Heatran. However, Tapu Lele is very prediction reliant and can often invite in Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Iron Crown, and Mega Scizor. Additionally, it struggles against common revenge killers such as Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Lopunny. Therefore, a strong defensive core is recommended when building around Tapu Lele to minimize the impact of these offensive threats, especially having a switch-in to the aforementioned Steel-types that may come in on a Psychic or Moonblast. Good switch-ins to these include Heatran and Alomomola, with the latter serving as a pivot with Flip Turn to safely get Tapu Lele on the field against passive foes like Toxapex and Gliscor.</p>"

Taunt, besides preventing the aforementioned Pokemon from relaying hazards in front of Tapu Fini, also denies healing and setup attempts from Pokemon like Clefable and Blissey, particularly when used in combination with Nature's Madness to more quickly wear down said targets. 96 Speed EVs ensure that Tapu Fini outruns Adamant Scizor, letting it shut down potential Swords Dance attempts against it, while the rest is put into Defense to maximize its walling capabilities against Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Psyshock Latios, and Excadrill. Defog Tapu Fini fits onto many bulky offense and balance teams for its valuable role compression. Tapu Fini is prone to being overwhelmed and lacks any form of healing outside of Leftovers, which makes other defensive Pokemon that can support it against the aforementioned threats extremely valuable; these include Pokemon such as Skarmory and Assault Vest Tangrowth.

However, its vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards and lack of longevity make it a poor candidate to do it consistently. Ice Beam can be run to potentially 2HKO offensive Tornadus-T and OHKO Landorus-T, while Nature's Madness is an option to dent its checks hard—especially ones that lack reliable recovery—such as Ferrothorn, Galarian Slowking, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. However, forgoing Taunt or Defog loses out on Tapu Fini's utility, which makes shutting down walls and supporting its team needlessly more difficult. Tera Steel allows Tapu Fini to emergency check threats like Tapu Lele and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T; it also provides a better defensive typing against walls like Toxapex and Ferrothorn, which is more useful if using Taunt. The Speed EVs allow Tapu Fini to outspeed +1 Mega Gyarados, while the Special Attack EVs allow it to KO Urshifu-R after Stealth Rock. Gholdengo, Tornadus-T, and Ferrothorn are great teammates to deal with faster threats like boosted Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf users such as Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Landorus-T; Ferrothorn also provides Spikes to chip down foes like Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Garganacl into Tapu Fini's KO range, compensating for its middling damage output. Offensive teammates like Volcarona, Kartana, and Weavile love its Misty Terrain to protect them against debilitating status from walls like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Skeledirge, letting them set up and attack more safely; Volcarona also enjoys Tapu Fini luring in and crippling their shared checks like Toxapex and Clodsire with Trick, while Choice Band Weavile appreciates Tapu Fini removing Stealth Rock with Defog.</p>"

Buzzwole sets itself apart from other physical walls with its high Attack stat and strong moves, allowing it to exert immediate pressure against the opposing team. Close Combat is Buzzwole's STAB move of choice, as its high Base Power is preferred over alternatives like Drain Punch against threats such as Scizor and Iron Hands. Earthquake is a solid coverage move that allows Buzzwole to threaten Iron Moth and Ceruledge, which would otherwise be able to switch in for free. The final moveslot offers a bit more flexibility, with Toxic being used the most in order to status common switch-ins such as Latios, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth. Alternatively, Thunder Punch can be utilized for more immediate pressure against Water- and Flying-types such as Tapu Fini and Enamorus. Finally, Bulk Up can be used on defensive teams to allow Buzzwole to act as a wincon. The Defense boosts can also help in one-on-one situations against other Attack-boosting threats such as Iron Hands. The Attack EVs ensure Buzzwole 2HKOs defensive Celesteela with Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage, while 112 Speed EVs allow Buzzwole to outspeed Adamant Tyranitar. This Speed benchmark is largely trivial, however, and can be adjusted to account for other specific threats such as Bisharp and Scizor. Buzzwole’s ability to switch into Ground- and Fighting-type moves is valued by Pokemon such as Excadrill and Tyranitar, and its resistance to Bug and Dark is greatly appreciated by Psychic-types such as Mega Latias and Slowking. Due to its poor special bulk, Buzzwole can quickly be overwhelmed by strong special attackers and Future Sight. Therefore, it appreciates specially defensive teammates such as Blissey and Hippowdon. Physical wallbreakers are often paired with Future Sight support; therefore, Pokemon such as Celesteela and Mega Aggron can prove helpful because of their high Defense paired with a Psychic resistance. Pokemon that can cover Buzzwole's weaknesses to Flying, Fairy, Fire, and Psychic are also greatly appreciated. As such, Mega Latias, Clefable, and Tyranitar are natural partners.</p>"

Bulk Up accumulates boosts alongside Pokemon such as Howl Zamazenta, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and defensive Mega Scizor, meaning they cannot overwhelm Buzzwole. Toxic is a niche alternative if Buzzwole's team wishes to play more proactively, as it cripples the likes of Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and Skeledirge that would otherwise take advantage of Buzzwole. Heavy-Duty Boots ignores entry hazards, letting Buzzwole consistently switch into the Pokemon it gets tasked to counter without being worn down. Tera Water gives Buzzwole a Water resistance, allowing it to wall Pokemon such as Urshifu-R, Floatzel, and Barraskewda in rain. The given EV spread maximizes Buzzwole's physical bulk while ensuring it always outspeeds Kingambit. Buzzwole fits best on defensive teams, which appreciate it as a fallback measure against the myriad of physical wallbreakers while not caring for its relative passivity. Pokemon such as Clodsire and Hippowdon can shore up Buzzwole's weakness to common special attackers such as Mega Diancie, Dragapult, and Tapu Koko. Buzzwole appreciates pivots such as Toxapex, Tornadus-T, and Gliscor, which can absorb chip damage from moves like Scald, Salt Cure and—for the latter two—Knock Off. Buzzwole has a tendency to thud into Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Tapu Lele if not using Toxic, so it pairs well with the likes of Gholdengo and Weavile that can exploit them.</p>"

Its naturally great bulk and Steel/Flying typing afford it setup opportunities against foes like Scizor and Excadrill, as well as the ability to easily muscle past them. Meteor Beam combined with Power Herb lets Celesteela boost its Special Attack without needing a KO. Given that it's Celesteela's strongest attack, in some situations it should be saved to instead target a foe Celesteela would otherwise have trouble breaking through like Skeledirge or Victini. Air Slash serves as a spammable STAB attack, 2HKOing most of the tier at +1, though it can OHKO many Bug- and Grass-types like Buzzwole and Hisuian Lilligant unboosted. Its chance to flinch its foes can also come in handy against special walls like Gastrodon and Slowking, which could otherwise stop Celesteela's sweep. Fire Blast primarily targets Steel-types, OHKOing foes like Scizor unboosted and opposing Celesteela after a few boosts. Celesteela best fits on offense teams looking for a cleaner, forming a potent offensive combination with other sweepers like Iron Hands and Bisharp. Alternatively, if the opportunity arises, it can instead be used as a mid-game wallbreaker and have a teammate clean using the holes it creates. However, it has no way to break through certain special walls like Blissey and Chansey on its own, making physical attackers like Bisharp and Iron Hands necessary. While they share some overlapping counterplay, special sweepers like Booster Energy Iron Moth and Galarian Moltres also appreciate Celesteela's support for similar reasons, and they can still support each other by weakening some of each other's shared checks, such as Slowbro, Slowking, Latios, and Latias. Entry hazard setters like Lead Mew and Excadrill are crucial for their ability to weaken Celesteela's checks, making it harder for foes like Gastrodon and Tapu Fini to remain healthy enough to check Celesteela.</p>"

Leech Seed is Celesteela’s most defining move, as it is its main way of healing itself and allows it to force progress against would be switch-ins such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Blissey while also discouraging threats such as Mega Latias from setting up against it. Heavy Slam is another vital move that allows Celesteela to pressure threats such as Mega Tyranitar, Clefable, and Enamorus. Protect is good when used with Leech Seed to further wear down threats such as Excadrill and Enamorus without Substitute while also letting it scout Choice-locked foes such as Latios and Victini. Toxic can be used over Protect on more offensive teams to make faster progress against threats such as Mega Latias, Mega Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Galarian Moltres and also wear down bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Gastrodon. Flamethrower is an important coverage move to tackle Steel- and Grass-types such as Excadrill, Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Leftovers synergizes very well with Leech Seed and Protect to recover large swaths of HP. Celesteela struggles a lot against Fire-types such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Victini, so bulky Fire-resistant teammates such as Slowking, Mega Latias, and Mega Tyranitar are greatly appreciated to keep them at bay. Mega Tyranitar in particular is capable of Pursuit trapping Fire-types to deal with them. Electric-types such as Sandy Shocks and both Thundurus formes also annoy Celesteela greatly with Volt Switch, so Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon are important for halting their pivoting, and in return Celesteela can deal with Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu for them. Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss are good at handling Water-types that annoy Celesteela such as Slowbro and Tapu Fini while also being secondary checks to Electric-types. Dangerous physical attackers such as Galarian Zapdos and Swords Dance Scizor can easily overwhelm Celesteela, so physical walls such as Slowbro, Buzzwole, and Mega Altaria make for great partners to help deal with them. In return, Celesteela can help cover them against Fairy-types such as Clefable and Enamorus while also providing them with extra longevity via Leech Seed support.</p>"

Flamethrower targets Steel-types that resist Heavy Slam such as Corviknight, Iron Treads, and Mega Scizor, while Air Slash threatens Fighting-types like Mega Gallade, Great Tusk, and Kommo-o. Alternatively, Toxic may be used to put bulkier Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Gastrodon on a timer, however, without Flamethrower, Celesteela is extremely passive in front of the aforementioned Steel-types, as well as Ferrothorn and Gholdengo which are immune to Leech Seed. Giga Drain is another option to improve the Water and Ground matchups, hitting Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Slowbro as well as improving longevity, however, it's a lot more matchup reliant than the other listed options. Protect in conjunction with Leech Seed is Celesteela's main method of forcing progress, spreading chip damage while also massively boosting its longevity. The given EV spread allows Celesteela to survive two consecutive uses of Close Combat from the likes of Mega Lopunny in addition to Choice Scarf Buzzwole and Terrakion. Heatran is by far Celesteela's most advantageous teammate due to its immunity to Fire-type moves letting it take on threats such as Volcarona and Blacephalon. In return, Celesteela walls Ground-types like Clodsire and Hippowdon. Ferrothorn is an essential teammate due to its ability to check Water-types such as Barraskewda, Mega Swampert, and Rotom-W as well as provide utility in the form of entry hazards and additional Leech Seed support, wearing down teams greatly. Furthermore, Ferrothorn is a great answer to Electric-type Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Alolan Raichu. Ghost-type teammates such as Aegislash and Gholdengo alleviate the Fighting matchup, lessening the amount of pressure put onto Celesteela as a primary switch-in and also removing threats like Skeledirge, Slowbro, and Toxapex. Choice Scarf Iron Treads and Excadrill provide an immunity against the aforementioned Electric-type Pokemon, while the former checks Landorus with Ice Spinner and the latter hinders Mega Sableye with Toxic. Furthermore, Excadrill and Iron Treads are Steel's best answers to Ogerpon-H. Mega Scizor is a great pivot into Knock Off and can take on Fighting-types due to its neutrality to them and access to Roost. Assault Vest Melmetal is a great blanket check to special attackers like Tapu Koko, Kyurem, and Gholdengo, while Hisuian Goodra is an excellent sponge for Water-type attacks, walling Volcanion, Choice Specs Pelipper, and Basculegion-F.</p>"

Giga Impact can be used in conjunction with Normalium Z to turn into a devastating Breakneck Blitz, slicing through Flying-type answers such as Tornadus-T, Dragonite, and Zapdos. Knock Off is an alternative to KO Gholdengo and Dragapult reliably, as well as pressure checks such as Skeledirge and Tornadus-T.

With its impressive 181 Attack stat, Kartana is often able to force opposing entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and Clodsire out and take advantage of this to use Defog. Furthermore, its resistance to Stealth Rock and immunity to Toxic Spikes helps Kartana to switch into entry hazards multiple times. Synthesis provides Kartana with longevity, especially when paired with sun, which allows it to even outheal damage from defensive Landrous-T and Great Tusk's Earthquake. Grassium Z makes up for its loss in power and enables it to pick off weakened walls like Toxapex and Landorus-T, as well as threatening common Stealth Rock users such as Garchomp, Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Clodsire. Knock Off hits Gholdengo for super effective damage. Sacred Sword can be used as an alternative choice to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran, which Kartana otherwise struggles with. However, missing out on hitting Gholdengo makes it less helpful in the current metagame. 120 Attack EVs allow Kartana to OHKO offensive Garchomp with Bloom Doom. while the HP investment ensures that Kartana survives Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Psychic even after taking Stealth Rock damage. Mega Charizard Y has great synergy with this set, since it appreciates Kartana's ability to keep the field clear of Stealth Rock whilst also muscling through common special walls in Chansey and Clodsire. In return, Drought boosts Kartana's longevity by increasing the amount of HP Synthesis recovers. Kartana can also switch into rock moves against Mega charizard Y from opposing Garchomp and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, while Mega Charizard Y removes Steel- and Grass-Type walls such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth that this set struggles with. Due to its poor Special Defence, Kartana is vulnerable to special attackers that outspeed it, like Tornadus-T and Iron Valiant. This requires it to be paired with a good special wall that can check those threats, such as Tapu Fini or Slowking. Kartana can also struggle with entry hazard setters such as Mega Diancie, Heatran, and Skarmory due to its inability to force them out, so teammates that can limit them such as Slowing and Heatran make for good partners.</p>"

Conversely, due to its Stealth Rock weakness, Blacephalon also strongly appreciates teammates that provide entry hazard removal like Arceus-Ground and Rapid Spin Yveltal. Slow pivots like Primal Kyogre and Mega Steelix can bring Blacephalon in safely. Blacephalon can be Imposter-proofed by Imposter Guzzlord, though other options like Fur Coat Ting-Lu and Mega Audino also work.</p>"

Fire Blast provides more power to OHKO foes like Tapu Koko and Great Tusk at the cost of lowered accuracy. Hidden Power Ice targets Ground- and Dragon-types that aren't threatened by Blacephalon's STAB combination such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. Alternatively, Blacephalon may use Psyshock to break through Clodsire, Kommo-o, and Nihilego. Trick immobilizes switch-ins like Alolan Muk, Iron Hands, and Blissey but can also be used on the aforementioned targets of Psyshock. With a Choice Scarf, Blacephalon manages to outpace Weavile, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Tapu Koko, allowing it to revenge kill them. Mimikyu is a great wallbreaker, capable of weakening Dark, Fighting, and Dragon teams, setting Blacephalon up for success late-game. Mega Sableye prevents the setting of Stealth Rock, allowing Blacephalon to pivot freely. Gholdengo threatens Fairy-type Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Clefable and takes advantage of passive Blacephalon switch-ins like Toxapex and Blissey. Hisuian Zoroark's immunity to Ghost-type moves is heavily appreciated, and it lures in Dark-types such as Hydreigon, Mega Tyranitar, and Ting-Lu with Illusion, hitting them with Focus Blast. Furthermore, Hisuian Zoroark can bluff other Blacephalon switch-ins—such as Heatran and Toxapex—to eliminate them, easing Blacephalon's job later into the match. Froslass and Galarian Corsola offer entry hazards to wear down Blacephalon's switch-ins and spread status ailments to ease Blacephalon's sweeping.</p>"

          "description": "<p>A blistering Speed tier, above-average offenses, and potent offensive typing make Zeraora an effective pivot and revenge killer in the tier, threatening important targets in Cinderace, Latios, Enamorus, and Alakazam. Additionally, Zeraora packs significant utility options in Knock Off and Volt Switch that can capitalize on the aforementioned traits and even allow it to make long-term progress against a majority of defensive targets, such as Ting-Lu and Rotom-W. Toxic is usually Zeraora's preferred move in the last slot, allowing it to stifle specific Pokemon that are otherwise able to heal off and withstand its attacks, such as Mega Latias, Hippowdon, and Iron Hands. Alternatively, Zeraora can also make use of Close Combat to pose an immediate threat to most Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon, such as Excadrill, Hydreigon, and Mega Tyranitar, the latter of which it can also outspeed after a Dragon Dance, making it one of the few revenge killers able to remove it from full without the need for a Choice Scarf. On the other hand, Grass Knot is an alternative that puts immediate pressure on Hippowdon and Quagsire, though it becomes more difficult for Zeraora to break through several of the aforementioned targets in Mega Latias, Hydreigon, and Excadrill. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures Zeraora isn't hampered by entry hazards. Zeraora fits best on bulkier teams that appreciate its proficiency in revenge killing offensive threats while possessing added longevity and the ability to generate momentum. Defensive staples such as Ting-Lu, Slowking, and Amoonguss appreciate Zeraora's ability to force out Pokemon that may threaten them, including the likes of Cinderace, as well as Galarian Zapdos lacking Choice Scarf. In return, Ting-Lu can provide entry hazard support to bolster the effects of Zeraora's pivoting capabilities and Knock Off, whereas Slowking can use Future Sight to pressure Pokemon that would otherwise be able to stave off Zeraora's attacks, such as Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur. Similarly, slower wallbreakers like Choice Specs Enamorus, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Choice Band Tyranitar appreciate Zeraora's ability to scare out faster Pokemon while also benefitting from the safe switch-in opportunities provided by Volt Switch. While Zeraora's offensive matchups are impressive, it can struggle to contain many offensive threats that are capable of boosting their Speed, such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Autotomize Celesteela. Thus, specific defensive checks to these Pokemon such as defensive Celesteela, Slowbro, and Thunder Wave Clefable are highly appreciated.</p>"

It also possesses great utility thanks to U-turn and Knock Off. Wood Hammer is Rillaboom's strongest STAB move, dealing massive damage to all non-resistant foes. Knock Off catches would-be checks like Tornadus-T and Zapdos on the switch, getting rid of their item at the same time. Superpower hits Steel-types like Kingambit, Heatran, and Ferrothorn. Tera Grass makes Rillaboom even more threatening; with Terrain-boosted Grassy Glide, it becomes near unstoppable, 2HKOing Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock. Rillaboom fits best on bulky offense teams, which appreciate speed control in Grassy Glide. Grassy Terrain sweepers like Hawlucha and Choice Scarf Kartana appreciate Rillaboom weakening their common checks—namely Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Corviknight—so they can clean late-game. Magnezone is a standout partner for Rillaboom, as it can trap and remove Steel-types like Corviknight, Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn, letting Rillaboom clean more easily. Heatran appreciates Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain giving it passive recovery and weakening Earthquake from the likes of Galarian Slowking.

Knock Off punishes its checks, like Zapdos and Tornadus-T. Superpower allows Rillaboom to threaten Steel-types like Heatran, Kingambit, and Ferrothorn, while Wood Hammer does massive damage to all neutral threats, even without a boost. The given EV spread allows Rillaboom to outspeed Mega Tyranitar while maximizing its bulk. The added bulk maximizes Rillaboom’s longevity, helping it perform long-term and deal with other terrain setters, like Tapu Lele. Life Orb gives Rillaboom a chance to OHKO offensive Tornadus-T with Tera Grass-boosted Grassy Glide, with its recoil being negated by the Grassy Terrain. On the other hand, Leftovers provides increased longevity for Rillaboom, allowing it to setup multiple times throughout a game. Tera Grass gives Rillaboom an even stronger Grassy Glide, allowing it to storm through most offensive teams that have limited resistances to it. Some Flying-resistant Tera types such as Steel and Electric can punish Zapdos and Tornadus-T, but they are usually suboptimal and don't benefit Rillaboom's offensive power. Magnezone works well with this set, as it can trap and remove Steel-types like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor. Hawlucha is a good partner as well, as Grassy Seed will activate Hawlucha's Unburden thanks to Grassy Terrain and Rillaboom can weaken their shared check in Zapdos so it can clean late-game. Since Superpower weakens Steel-types, Pokemon like Weavile and Mega Mawile pair well with Rillaboom. The latter also appreciates Grassy Terrain, as it softens Earthquake from the likes of Gliscor and Landorus-T.</p>"

Pyro Ball is its most reliable move, as it can hit hard while preserving Libero. Sucker Punch gives Cinderace a means to hit faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Dragapult super effectively. Alternatively, Gunk Shot can be run to OHKO Iron Valiant and Hatterene while preserving the team's ability to Terastallize. Court Change is an extremely useful move, as it can provide hazard control that is unaffected by Gholdengo's Good as Gold while also stealing Light Screen and Reflect from hyper offensive teams; however, Cinderace can choose to run High Jump Kick instead to hit Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Ting-Lu harder as well as inflicting more damage against Pokemon that resist Pyro Ball like Garchomp and Garganacl. Tera Fire is the Tera type that Cinderace wants to utilize in order to maximize Pyro Ball's damage, giving it the ability to, with an Adamant nature, OHKO Corviknight after Stealth Rock. It also helps Cinderace hit bulkier targets like Hatterene and offensive Great Tusk, especially if it isn't running Gunk Shot or High Jump Kick. A Jolly nature is preferred to augment Cinderace's role as a fast pivot, allowing it to outspeed Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Iron Treads. However, an Adamant nature can be run instead to increase its damage output.</p> <p>Cinderace works best on balance and bulky offense teams, providing utility and entry hazard control while simultaneously exerting offensive pressure. Defensive Water-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Dondozo can all sponge Water-type attacks while taking neutral damage from Rock- and Ground-type moves, with the exception of Toxapex. In turn, Cinderace can match up well against wallbreakers such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant and Meowscarada, which can all cause difficulties for the aforementioned Water-types. Ground-types that provide entry hazard support such as Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu make it easier for Cinderace to check threats with Stealth Rock and Spikes, especially if it is running an Adamant nature. Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Iron Valiant pair well with Cinderace, as they can eradicate foes that wall it such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Rotom-W. Similarly, Dragonite and Kingambit can check Pokemon such as Hatterene and Skeledirge, which can both cause issues for Cinderace.

Cinderace can force out important offensive threats like Gholdengo and Iron Valiant with the threat of STAB Pyro Ball while keeping up momentum against defensive switch-ins with U-turn. Will-O-Wisp allows Cinderace to cripple physical attackers such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Great Tusk, and it can also negate Leftovers for defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. Specifically, Will-O-Wisp offers a safe way for Cinderace to check Kingambit, since it avoids Sucker Punch mindgames. Finally, Court Change offers unmatched utility in providing entry hazard control that cannot be blocked by Gholdengo and is also able to steal opposing dual screens. The 32 Attack EVs guarantee a KO on Gholdengo sets lacking defensive investment and 2HKO on physically defensive Corviknight after Leftovers. Although this set rarely wants to Terastallize, Tera Fire can potentially come in handy for securing KOs with Pyro Ball, especially with a Blaze boost. Alternatively, Tera Flying grants Cinderace an immunity to Ground-type attacks, such as Great Tusk's Earthquake, which can grant it extra opportunities to KO foes or cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Tera Flying also matches up well against common Ground-type hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, letting Cinderace safely Court Change against them.</p> <p>Cinderace works best on bulkier teams where its ability to guarantee hazard removal shines. Defensive Pokemon such as Dondozo, Slowking, Toxapex, and Amoonguss are great teammates, as they appreciate Cinderace's ability to ensure hazard removal, freeing them up to run items other than Heavy-Duty Boots. Water-types such as Dondozo and Toxapex have notably strong synergy with Cinderace; Dondozo checks Great Tusk and Tera Fire Kingambit, while Toxapex can check Water-types, such as Walking Wake and Greninja. Hazard-weak breakers such as Iron Moth and Choice Band Dragonite also fit well with Cinderace, as it's able to bring them in with U-turn. These breakers also enjoy bulky Water-types like Toxapex or Dondozo being burnt, making it easier to overwhelm them long-term. Cinderace usually requires the presence of another hazard control Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hatterene, or Corviknight so it doesn't get overwhelmed. Corviknight synergizes especially well with Cinderace thanks to its Ground immunity and ability to absorb Knock Off from Meowscarada, which outspeeds Cinderace. Skeledirge and Dragapult can take advantage of bulky Cinderace, since both completely wall it and can potentially set up a Substitute. Kingambit is a great partner, as it can offensively check both Skeledirge and Dragapult. In return, it appreciates Cinderace burning Great Tusk and Ting-Lu, opening up the way for it to sweep.</p>"

Tera Fire boosts Pyro Ball's power, allowing Cinderace to 2HKO foes such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Tera Fairy Garganacl after Stealth Rock. Cinderace must careful when using Tera, however, as Libero will no longer activate, leaving it more vulnerable to foes such as Rotom-W. Cinderace fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its pivoting ability. Tapu Koko forms a potent pivoting core with Cinderace, taking advantage of foes such as Toxapex and Rotom-W while granting Cinderace free entry against foes such as Ferrothorn and Tangrowth. They also overwhelm foes such as Ladorus-T, Gastrodon, and Great Tusk together. Cinderace also appreciates teammates such as Ferrothorn and Gastrodon providing entry hazard support to weaken foes such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk while also checking foes such as Rotom-W and Urshifu-R. Dragapult appreciates Cinderace handling foes such as Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit; in return, it threatens foes such as Skeledirge, which Cinderace struggles against. Future Sight support from teammates such as Slowbro and Tapu Lele helps pressure foes such as Toxapex for Cinderace; in return, Cinderace handles foes that threaten them such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor.</p>"

Pyro Ball lets Cinderace threaten out Sableye trying to take High Jump Kick on Dark-type teams while also dealing high amounts of general damage under sun. Libero-boosted High Jump Kick provides valuable coverage, notably hitting Ting-Lu trying to set entry hazards while dealing large amounts of damage to Pokemon with a Fire resistance trying to switch in on its Pyro Ball, such as Hydreigon and Garganacl. Low Kick is an alternative, letting Cinderace deal decent damage to most heavy foes such as Ting-Lu and Iron Hands without the large risk of High Jump Kick's crash damage. Court Change lets Cinderace force the opposing team to deal with their own hazards while making it unlikely that hazards go up again. U-turn lets Cinderace keep momentum against foes it cannot threaten out like defensive Great Tusk and Garchomp. Alternatively, Sucker Punch lets Cinderace pick off weakened threats such as Flutter Mane and Baxcalibur. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Cinderace come in repeatedly to remove hazards without worrying about residual damage from them.</p> <p>Rotom-H is a great teammate for Cinderace, as its Ground immunity lets it come in on Great Tusk while threatening Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo—that Cinderace can't do much against—with its Electric-type STAB moves. Additionally, Rotom-H can beat Poison teams with its Substitute + Nasty Plot set, which Cinderace greatly appreciates. In return, Cinderace can pivot Rotom-H in with U-turn and keep Stealth Rock off its side of the field. Torkoal is another good teammate for Cinderace, as it provides sun to boost Cinderace's Pyro Ball damage to astronomical levels, provides entry hazard support to chip switch-ins, threatens Chien-Pao and physical Dragapult with a burn, and supplies a secondary source of hazard removal. In return, Cinderace can threaten out Ting-Lu, which might try to switch into Torkoal, while also keeping hazards off against Ghost teams. Scovillain deals with the aforementioned Water-types as well as Gastrodon while appreciating Cinderace removing the hazards that hurt Scovillain's longevity. Volcarona appreciates Cinderace chipping away at the opposing team, facilitating an endgame sweep. In return, Volcarona can hit Dark-types such as Ting-Lu and Hydreigon hard with Bug Buzz, ruin Gastrodon through Giga Drain, and damage Poison-types such as Iron Moth, Toxapex, and Glimmora with Psychic. Skeledirge is able to come in on physical hits like Iron Hands's Earthquake and force it out with the threat of a burn. Finally, Ceruledge can remove Ghost-types such as Dragapult that Cinderace can't do much against. In return, Cinderace can eliminate Dark-types and keep hazards off the field for both.</p>"

U-turn allows Cinderace to pivot out on switch-ins like Well-Baked Body Corviknight and Quaquaval, while Swords Dance changes its role from a pivot to a wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. Gunk Shot further increases its coverage, preying on Fairy-types like Scream Tail and Enamorus-T and threatening switch-ins like Primordial Sea Zapdos and Dragonite, while Will-O-Wisp allows it to cripple its switch-ins like Regenerator Great Tusk and physically defensive Garchomp, and Court Change allows it to control hazards in a pinch. Cinderace's ability to force out Steel-types like Corviknight is greatly appreciated by other physical wallbreakers like Chien-Pao and Galarian Zapdos, which in return can remove Corviknight if it is running Well-Baked Body for Cinderace so it can clean up afterwards. Cinderace is vulnerable to revenge killers like Dragonite, Barraskewda, and Azelf, making walls like Corviknight, defensive Zapdos, and RegenVest Manaphy good partners that can switch into these revenge killers and pivot out. Well-Baked Body Gholdengo completely shuts down Cinderace, so teammates that can remove it like Gengar and offensive Roaring Moon make for great partners.</p>"

It also individually beats hazard setters like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Clodsire. Brave Bird is the preferred option that pressures Dragapult, Zamazenta, Urshifu-R, and Iron Valiant, while Body Press pressures Kingambit, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Weavile. Iron Defense or Bulk Up can be used over Defog to turn Corviknight into a bulky win condition and to improve its ability to check threats like Kingambit, Urshifu-R, and Dragon Dance Dragapult. Body Press should be used with Iron Defense, while Brave Bird can instead be used with Bulk Up. U-turn allows Corviknight to maintain momentum against the threats that it checks while also bringing in frailer teammates. The given HP and Defense EVs allow Corviknight to live a +2 Continental Crush from Landorus-T, while the rest of the EVs being in Special Defense helps out against Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. Rocky Helmet allows Corviknight to chip threats like Mega Lopunny and Weavile. Tera Dragon removes Corviknight's Electric and Fire weaknesses and potentially allows it to turn the tables on Heatran and Rotom-W. Tera Ground can instead be used to halt Volt Switch attempts and surprise Tapu Koko, but the resistances it grants are not as consistently valuable as Dragon. Corviknight's biggest problem by far is Gholdengo, which blocks Corviknight's Defog attempts and sets up on it. Options that deal with it, such as Kingambit, Weavile, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire are therefore mandatory partners. U-turn can bring in the former two to Pursuit trap Gholdengo, while the latter two can stave it off defensively. Kingambit is especially potent with Corviknight, as it appreciates Corviknight's Rocky Helmet applying chip damage onto its checks like Mega Lopunny and Zamazenta. U-turn can also bring in other threats safely, such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Heatran. Corviknight's defensive profile gets taken advantage of by threats like Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona, so options such as your own Heatran, Garchomp, and Toxapex can help out in this regard.</p>"

It also provides a sturdy defensive backbone, consistently checking threats such as Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Dragonite. However, as Corviknight lacks immediate offensive presence and coverage, it suffers from being forced out by the likes of Zapdos and Heatran and being setup fodder from the likes of Kingambit and Gholdengo. Pressure, in conjunction with Substitute, allows Corviknight to PP stall checks like Heatran and Skarmory safely while bypassing status moves like Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp and Clefable's Thunder Wave. Tera Water improves the matchup against Heatran, Weavile, and Urshifu-R, giving crucial resistances to safely let Corviknight boost up. Alternatively, Tera Dragon lets it take on Electric-types like Zapdos and Rotom-W while also helping against Heatran and Urshifu-R. However, Pokemon like Mega Diancie, Weavile, and Dragapult can now almost always force it out, though they do have to watch out for repeated Brave Bird hits. The given EV spread maximizes special bulk while still being able to survive a +2 Continental Crush from Garchomp followed by Stone Edge after Roost; it also lets Corviknight outspeed Skarmory and become only 3HKOed by Great Tusk's Close Combat. However, note that Corviknight will be taking a super effective Body Press from Skarmory after using Roost. Corviknight fits best on bulkier teams, which appreciate its ability to PP stall threats like Heatran and Toxapex while being a solid wincon. Pokemon like Toxapex and Clefable thus work well with it. Toxapex appreciates Corviknight reliably checking Tapu Lele and Landorus-T for it. In return, Toxapex helps check Weavile, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny, which Corviknight struggles to do. Calm Mind Clefable loves Corviknight draining PP from opposing Toxapex’s Haze; in return, it softens up Heatran. Ground-types like Gliscor and Great Tusk make excellent partners, as they absorb Electric attacks from the likes of Tapu Koko and remove entry hazards from the field. In exchange, Corviknight helps take Kyurem and Iron Valiant’s attacks. Due to Corviknight being walled by Electric- and Steel-types, such as Zapdos and Gholdengo, partners that can threaten them such as Mega Tyranitar and Heatran work well with it.</p>"

Iron Head allows Corviknight to handle Flutter Mane and other Fairy-types such as Mimikyu and Hatterene. Body Press hits Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and other Dark- and Steel-types hard. On the other hand, U-turn safely brings in stronger attackers like Dragonite, Iron Jugulis, and Kilowattrel, providing extra counterplay against Pokemon such as Volcarona and Gholdengo, which commonly switch into Corviknight. Pressure is the preferred ability for PP stalling Stealth Rock, while Mirror Armor counters Flutter Mane and Hatterene, which would otherwise overwhelm Corviknight with Mystical Fire. With the listed EV spread and a Careful nature, Corviknight avoids a 2HKO from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball while guaranteeing Iron Head OHKOes Flutter Mane in return. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to ease its matchup against physical threats such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur.</p> <p>Corviknight's capability to take on many offensive threats combined with its Steel typing makes it a stellar asset that almost any offensive Pokemon benefits from. For instance, Iron Jugulis appreciates Corviknight removing Flutter Mane, and Flamigo struggles with Ice Shard variants of Chien-Pao, which Corviknight can safely switch into. Dragonite greatly benefits from Corviknight's ability to soak up Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks while also covering Corviknight's weaknesses to Fire- and Electric-types such as Cinderace, Magnezone, and Volcarona. Gyarados can also act as a reliable wincon against types like Fire and Ground while also making Chien-Pao significantly more managable with Intimidate. Additionally, Kilowattrel is a great offensive pivot to pair with Corviknight, as it removes threats that could harm Corviknight like Greninja, Volcarona, and Azumarill while also absorbing Electric-type attacks. In return, Corviknight counters Iron Treads and Ting-Lu, which threaten Kilowattrel. Pelipper can be paired with Kilowattrel and Corviknight to form a potent rain core that softens the impact of Fire moves and gives Kilowattrel a Water-type Weather Ball, OHKOing many Fire-types that annoy Corviknight including Skeledirge and Rotom-H. Corviknight appreciates having Talonflame as an alternative option against physical attackers, as Talonflame is able to hold off Chien-Pao and burn Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Dragonite, tremendously easing Corviknight's role.</p>"

Body Press targets Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that resist Brave Bird or could take advantage of its recoil like Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Iron Treads, as well as capitalizes off of the Defense boost given by Bulk Up. Alternatively, Taunt prevents Ting-Lu from phazing Corviknight out with Whirlwind and breaks passive teams like Poison due to the prominence of Haze and recovery moves, while Substitute makes it harder to shut down once setup and stalls out Landorus-T's Smack Down. Leftovers provides much-needed recovery and is almost always the preferred item; however, Occa Berry + Body Press can surprise Heatran and Flamethrower Hydreigon. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 80 Def / 180 SpD with an Impish nature allows Corviknight to survive Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R after a Swords Dance, as well as prevents Zamazenta from breaking Substitute with Body Press.</p> <p>Heatran is a great teammate, as it switches into Fire-type moves from Iron Moth, Scovillain, and Moltres and traps and removes Toxapex so Corviknight doesn't need to use Taunt. In return, Corviknight provides an immunity to Ground-type attacks directed at Heatran as well as a Fighting-type neutrality. Gholdengo threatens out Skeledirge and Iron Valiant and takes advantage of walls like Toxapex, opposing Corviknight, and Klefki by setting up Nasty Plot freely. Kingambit checks Ghost-type threats such as Dragapult, Spectrier, and Flutter Mane, as well as heavily wears down teams so Corviknight can setup relatively easily and clean up late-game. Hisuian Goodra is a great specially defenisve tank, taking on Greninja, Basculegion-F, and Volcanion as well as opposing Heatran.

Meanwhile, Iron Head ensures that Corviknight will not be walled by Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, and Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Corviknight might not be fast, but it's fast enough to shut down most other defensive Pokemon with Taunt, such as Dondozo and Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brave Bird</strong>: Brave Bird can be difficult to fit in, but it's a fantastic response against Breloom, and means Corviknight doesn't have to be passive against Amoonguss and Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Corviknight's defensive typing is fantastic, so don't Terastallize too hastily, or else it'll lose to threats it normally checks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Dragon and Fairy weaknesses are devastating, but in the late-game, resisting Electric and Fire can give Corviknight new win conditions against old foes such as Rotom-W, and a shot to seriously damage Chi-Yu with Body Press. Just note that Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Getting STAB on Body Press can give Corviknight a surprisingly decent chance at cleaning weakened teams, with being able to 3HKO specially defensive Ting-Lu being a highlight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: With Tera Water, Corviknight consistently survives all but Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu's Overheat, letting it deal serious damage with Body Press. It also gains a key resistance to Ice for Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: While this set doesn't always use Brave Bird, Tera Flying lets Corviknight keep its typing while using Roost, meaning Earthquake and Fissure can no longer hit Corviknight while its restoring health.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: This lets Corviknight wear down physical threats more quickly while pivoting.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: Safety Goggles ensures Corviknight won't be impacted by Spore from Breloom, Amoonguss, or Brute Bonnet, regardless of having Taunt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's consistent recovery can be quite helpful for taking repeated hits from Ruination when attempting to stall it out with Pressure.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: Mirror Armor's ability to punish Flutter Mane for using Mystical Fire makes it the best ability choice on Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Corviknight's excellent bulk makes Pressure a good alternative for stalling out foes such as Dondozo, and is particularly good at stalling out Ruination from Ting-Lu and Wo-Chien.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also prevents Corviknight from being walled by Flutter Mane and Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: While U-turn with this set may seem strange, Corviknight is still a decent pivot even if it must give up Taunt.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Corviknight has a fantastic defensive typing, so only Terastallize if you need to win certain matchups, especially since it becomes vulnerable to Toxic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: With a Fighting Tera type, Body Press is easier to sweep with, with many Ting-Lu variants now being 2HKOed by boosted Body Press.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Corviknight a way to resist both Chien-Pao's and Chi-Yu's most powerful STAB attacks, though Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: A Dragon Tera type lets Corviknight resist common attacks aimed at it, such as Electric- and Fire-type attacks. However, the new weaknesses to Fairy and Dragon make this an especially reactive Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: A Flying Tera type lets Corviknight retain its Flying typing even when using Roost, making it a more reliable check to Fissure users such as Dondozo and Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: The passive damage from Rocky Helmet against Mimikyu gives Corviknight a much easier time using Taunt over Iron Head.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: When paired with Taunt, Covert Cloak makes Corviknight an effective Garganacl check, though note Corviknight will no longer drop Flutter Mane's Special Attack with Mirror Armor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: With Safety Goggles blocking Spore, this Corviknight is now an excellent check against most offensive Breloom, just watch out for the occasional Tera Fire Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Since this Corviknight attempts to sweep, Sitrus Berry's burst of quick recovery can make it less pressured to spend a turn using Roost.

It's also an important aspect of Espathra Baton Pass teams, but Ting-Lu has made this team archetype much more difficult to use compared to past regulations.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Remember that most of Corviknight's good Tera types leave it vulnerable to Toxic, so Terastallize carefully and only win a win condition is clear.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: This Tera type lets Corviknight retain its Flying typing while using Roost, meaning Fissure users such as Dondozo are much easier to handle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is an effective tool against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, though note that Choice Specs Chi-Yu can OHKO with Tera Fire boosted Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Once Fairy-, Ice-, and Dragon-types are out of the way, the Dragon Tera type allows Corviknight to get around Electric- and Fire-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: If using Power Trip, Tera Dark is highly recommended to boost its damage output.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: In addition to punishing Flutter Mane for using Mystical Fire when not using Covert Cloak, Mirror Armor also protects Corviknight from Charm, Chilling Water, and Intimidate.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Pressure is a reasonable alternative for whittling down PP, which can be especially helpful against Ting-Lu's troublesome Ruination.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: When paired with Taunt, Corviknight can effectively take down Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: While Substitute and Taunt are effective against slower users of Spore like Amoonguss, Breloom's Speed means Safety Goggles are required to truly check it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Sitrus Berry is preferred due to the quicker burst of recovery better fitting a sweeper, but Leftovers can work very well with Pressure in an attempt to out-stall Ruination.</p> </li> </ul>"

Brave Bird is Corviknight's strongest neutral move and hits Ghost-types and key targets like Great Tusk and Galarian Zapdos, while Body Press fits well on Intimidate sets to do more damage to Roaring Moon, Ogerpon-C, and Chien-Pao. Corviknight is exceedingly passive, so it needs powerful and fast offensive teammates like Barraskewda and Azelf to re-gain momentum; in exchange, it provides them safe entry with its slow U-turn and entry hazard removal. Slower wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Ceruledge also appreciate Corviknight's slow pivoting services. Corviknight, especially Fluffy variants, needs a teammate like Swampert, Manaphy, or Well-Baked Body Gholdengo to handle the Fire-types it cannot check.

Stone Edge is Drednaw's hardest hitting move, dealing with Chien-Pao, Pelipper, and Dragonite. Liquidation hits troublesome Ground-types like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu. Earthquake threatens Water Absorb Clodsire, Toxapex, and Kingambit, while Strong Jaw-boosted Crunch nails switch-ins such as Slowbro, Brambleghast, and Bronzong. Swift Swim is preferred to aid Rock in the matchup against Water rain teams; however, Strong Jaw allows Drednaw to muscle through the aforementioned roadblocks when using Crunch. Air Balloon improves Drednaw's performance in the Ground matchup, allowing for more setup opportunities, while White Herb retains Drednaw's defensive stats to have an improved chance against priority move users like Azumarill, Mimikyu, and Kingambit.</p> <p>Garganacl's ability to pressure Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Corviknight with Salt Cure is heavily appreciated, easing Drednaw's time sweeping. Glimmora's colorful movepool allows it to check a myriad of threats like Breloom, Meowscarada, and Iron Valiant with Sludge Wave, Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Quaquaval using Energy Ball, Gholdengo, Toxapex, and Toxicroak with Earth Power, and finally Hydreigon, Chien-Pao, and Gallade using Dazzling Gleam. Choice Band Tyranitar heavily dents walls such as Corviknight, Slowbro, and Toxapex and sets up sand to increase Drednaw's bulk. Lycanroc aids in the Dark matchup due to its useful coverage in Close Combat and Play Rough and takes out faster foes like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane with Accelerock. Coalossal provides entry hazards in Spikes and Stealth Rock, removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and helps against Gholdengo and Meowscarada due to its Fire typing.</p>"

Coalossal does well in the Steel matchup, as it threatens Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Kingambit. Flame Body allows it to fish for burns to weaken physical threats like Kleavor, Scizor, Kingambit, Mimikyu, and Meowscarada. Body Press is a great move thanks to Coalossal's high Defense stat that allows it to deal incredible damage to Chien-Pao and Kingambit. Rapid Spin combined with Heavy-Duty Boots allows Coalossal to come in and remove hazards without taking any chip damage, so its teammates won't get worn down. Will-O-Wisp allows Coalossal to burn physical threats such as Kleavor, Hoopa-U, and Iron Hands. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 92 Def / 164 Spe allows Coalossal to outspeed and burn uninvested Kingambit with Will-O-Wisp. Spikes is another option to run on Coalossal over Will-O-Wisp to help Rock teams stack hazards and wear down foes.</p> <p>Garganacl helps Coalossal by dealing with defensive Pokemon like Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Heatran with Salt Cure. In return Garganacl appreciates Coalossal checking Meowscarada. Air Balloon Shell Smash Drednaw is another good teammate for Coalossal, providing a soft Ground-type immunity and dealing with Ground- and Steel- types like Landorus-T, Sandy Shocks, Iron Treads, Heatran, and Hisuian-Goodra. Choice Scarf Glimmora with its diverse moveset is another option to pair with Coalossal, as it can outspeed and threaten to OHKO non-Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant and Greninja. Glimmora can also deal with Water-, Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon- Types like Quagsire, Hisuian Liligant, Hisuian Samurott, and Hydreigon with its various coverage moves. Furthermore, Glimmora run Air Balloon to act as an alternative Ground-type immunity that can deal with threats like Quagsire and Great Tusk. Tyranitar sets sand for Coalossal to boosts its Special Defense, which can allow Coalossal to tank special attacks from Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Choice Specs Magnezone and threaten them in return. Choice Band Lycanroc-D is a good revenge killer that can help out Coalossal by taking out threats such as Enamorus and Cloyster with Accelerock and Urshifu-R and Clodsire with Psychic Fangs. Hisuian Arcanine is another good revenge killer with Extreme Speed and can act as a wallbreaker, taking out foes such as Toxapex and Clodsire with Head Smash and Flare Blitz, respectively. Kleavor is a good lead for Rock teams, as it can deal damage while setting up Stealth Rock with Stone Axe, which helps with hazard stacking. In return, Coalossal complements Kleavor by dealing with Scizor. Diancie can ease the Fighting match by dealing decent damage to Gallade and Iron Valiant with Moonblast and by being able to take Fighting-type moves due to its Fairy-typing. In return, Coalossal helps Diancie by dealing with Scizor, Kingambit and Meowscarada.</p>"

Dragon Dance means Flapple is able to boost its damage output while also being able to outspeed common threats such as Charizard, Dachsbun, and Rotom-F. Sucker Punch can gives Flapple priority to finish off weakened foes. Tera Blast can be used with Tera Ground to threaten Steel-types such as Perrserker and Tinkatuff, which would otherwise counter Flapple. On Ripen sets, Flapple can opt for Arcobatics, giving it strong coverage into foes such as Gogoat, Crabominable, and Rabsca. Ripen is normally the preferred ability and should be ran with Sitrus Berry, as it allows Flapple to set up and regain HP on Pokemon such as Carbink and Raichu. However, Heavy-Duty Boots can be ran instead with Hustle for more immediate power. Flapple most commonly runs Tera Dragon, boosting its Outrage to incredible amounts of power, allowing it to OHKO or 2HKO the majority of the tier. Tera Ground gives Flapple a solid defensive typing, allowing it to block Volt Switch from Pokemon like Electrode and Raichu and should be ran with Tera Blast. Finally, Tera Steel gives Flapple a great defensive typing that can allow it to set up on foes it otherwise could not on such as Skuntank and Masquerain.</p> <p>Flapple's primary struggles are often having issues with setting up safely and Steel-types walling Flapple sets without Tera Blast. Pivots such as Alolan Persian and Rotom-F can help get Flapple in safely to sweep. Alolan Persian is a particularly notable partner, as it can cripple threats that would normally be faster than Flapple even after a boost with Thunder Wave, such as Choice Scarf Skuntank and Lycanroc-N. Fire- and Ground-types such as Charizard and Alolan Dugtrio can check the Steel-types that otherwise give Flapple issues, such as Perrserker and Tinkatuff. In return, Flapple threatens out the defensive Water-types the Fire- and Ground-types would struggle with, such as Whiscash. Poison-types such as Skuntank and Swalot can absorb Toxic Spikes and check opposing Poison-types that cause issues for Flapple. Indeedee-F is also a notable partner, as it can use Healing Wish to heal Flapple back to max health and allow Flapple to be able to set up twice in the game. Spikes from Pokemon such as Carbink and Whiscash help wear down Steel-types for Flapple.</p>"

Stone Edge threatens Defoggers and Flying-types like Drifblim and Vivillon and hits Eelektross and Rotom neutrally. Rocky Helmet wears physical attackers like Passimian and Muk down and discourages the use of moves like U-turn, while Leftovers provides Sandaconda passive recovery and makes it less reliant on Rest. Tera Ghost lets Sandaconda completely wall most Fighting-types and other threats such as Zangoose.

Flip Turn forms a pivoting core with teammates like Rotom-W, Pelipper, and Greninja, slowly chipping away at switch-ins like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Dragonite. Close Combat hits Water-resistant Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon. Ice Fang may be used to hit Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Dragonite. Psychic Fangs nails common switch-ins such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Kommo-o, as well as removes dual screens in the Fairy matchup. Alternatively, Crunch may be used to break Sinistcha, Brambleghast, and Dragapult. A Jolly nature is preferred to outpace Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao outside of rain; however, Barraskewda may opt for an Adamant nature to notably 2HKO Baxcalibur and Zamazenta in rain with Liquidation.</p> <p>Pelipper sets rain for Barraskewda and brings it in safely with U-turn, as well as weakens walls like Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Toxapex with a Choice Specs set. Gastrodon and Quagsire provide entry hazards and an Electric immunity, allowing Gastrodon to switch into Regieleki and Sandy Shocks while Quagsire walls Iron Hands, Pawmot, and Magnezone. In return, Barraskewda lures in aforementioned Grass-types like Amoonguss and Brambleghast and removes them with the corresponding coverage moves. Toxapex provides a Grass neutrality, notably walling Meowscarada and Ogerpon-W, and offers entry hazards to wear down Barraskewda checks, while Barraskewda removes Ground-types like Landorus, Gliscor, and Mamoswine for it. Empoleon sets up Stealth Rock to wear down Barraskewda's checks as well as walls Dragon-types like Walking Wake and Kommo-o lacking adequate Fighting-type coverage. Quaquaval offers entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin and switches into Steel-types like Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit. Hisuian Samurott threatens Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon like Brambleghast, Slowbro, and Sinistcha while also providing utility support with Knock Off and Spikes set up via Ceaseless Edge. Urshifu-R is great in the Steel and Dark matchups, threatening Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Kingambit. Manaphy forms a wallbreaking core with Barraskewda in the Poison and Steel matchups, taking out Corviknight, Toxapex, and Amoonguss for Barraskewda, while Barraskweda hits Galarian Slowking and Alolan Muk in return. Choice Scarf Walking Wake is great in the Dragon matchup, notably outpacing and removing Baxcalibur, Dragapult, and Kommo-o, while a Choice Specs set weakens walls like Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra, and Slowbro. Basculegion-F is a huge asset in the Ghost and Psychic matchups, taking out Sinistcha, Slowbro, and Brambleghast.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its high offensive stats alongside Swift Swim, Choice Band Barraskewda is a premier wallbreaker, offensive pivot, late-game cleaner, and revenge killer on rain teams. Its blistering Speed tier allows it to nearly outpace the entire metagame under rain, including boosted foes like Dragon Dance Dragapult and Mega Swampert. Liquidation's Defense drop lets it potentially 2HKO Pokemon such as Dragapult and Pelipper, while Waterfall's flinches gives Barraskewda slightly better odds to muscle past the likes of Slowbro and Toxapex. Flip Turn keeps up momentum by providing free entry for its teammates while chipping down switch-ins like Dondozo and Tangrowth. Close Combat hits Water-resistant foes such as Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Gyarados, and it provides strong neutral coverage against the likes of Tera Water Great Tusk, Tera Grass Volcarona, and Gastrodon. Aqua Jet prevents Barraskewda from being revenge killed by priority attacks like Kingambit and Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch and—if rain is not active—lets it pick off faster threats such as Sand Rush Excadrill and boosted Volcarona and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, Psychic Fangs pressures Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Water Absorb Clodsire better. Tera Water skyrockets Barraskewda's rain-boosted STAB moves further, potentially 2HKOing even Water-resistant Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Pelipper is a necessary teammate that spearheads rain teams by reliably summoning rain with Drizzle. Mega Swampert is a fantastic offensive partner that can overwhelm shared checks like Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Slowbro and appreciates Barraskewda's Flip Turn to bring it in safely on foes such as Toxapex, Dragapult, and Dragonite. Tornadus-T and Ferrothorn are rain team staples that support Barraskewda with Knock Off, crippling walls such as Rotom-W and opposing Ferrothorn; Ferrothorn in particular helps threaten Gastrodon with Power Whip and sets entry hazards to soften up foes. The aforementioned Pelipper and Tornadus-T also provide Defog support for Barraskewda to pivot throughout the game unperturbed, bring it in safely via U-turn, and threatens problematic Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tera Grass Heatran.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Barraskewda functions as one of the best sweepers on rain Water teams, in part thanks to its high Speed tier, which is increased further under rain due to its ability Swift Swim, allowing it to outspeed the entire tier, as well as its strong coverage options to threaten Water-resistant Pokemon. Liquidation is Barraskewda's strongest spammable STAB option, which under rain 2HKOes Water-resistant targets like Kommo-o after hazard support and OHKOes neutral targets like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to pivot out of Pokemon like Corviknight and Rotom-W, which are not OHKOed by rain-boosted(AH) Liquidation, while still dealing respectable damage and maintaining momentum to get in its teammates to deal with these Pokemon. Close Combat is the strongest coverage move that Barraskewda has access to and it most notably threatens Ferrothorn, which is able to take Liquidation from Barraskewda. Psychic Fangs in conjunction with an Adamant nature lets Barraskewda 2HKO Mega Venusaur and Toxapex, and its secondary effect of destroying dual screens, while situational, is useful in the Fairy matchup. Crunch is an alternative option to let Barraskewda target Psychic-types like Latios, Mega Latias, and Slowbro, which are able to switch into Liquidation. Poison Jab is also an option to target specifically Tapu Bulu and Azumarill, which resist Liquidation and Close Combat. Barraskewda can run a Jolly nature in order to outspeed base 130 Speed Pokemon outside of rain, in particular Tapu Koko, while also being faster than Mega Lopunny, whereas an Adamant nature can also be run to achieve the aforementioned results with Psychic Fangs. Pelipper is a mandatory partner of Barraskewda, as it not only sets rain but also offers a slow U-turn as a form of pivoting, which lets Barraskewda get on the field safely, and its ability to threaten opposing Grass teams with Hurricane helps Barraskewda get past Pokemon like Mega Venusaur. Mega Swampert can form a potent Swift Swim offensive core with Barraskewda, with its superior bulk and defensive typing allowing it to stay in on certain Pokemon like Baxcalibur to achieve the 2HKO with Earthquake. Swampert also works well with Barraskewda, offering hazard support in Stealth Rock to weaken opposing Pokemon so Barraskewda can secure KOs. It also provides slow pivoting with Flip Turn, and its Ground typing is a must to stave off opposing Electric-types like Regieleki, which are faster than Barraskewda outside of rain. Toxapex is also a strong defensive teammate for Barraskewda, being able to cripple Barraskewda's checks with Toxic and also handle setup sweepers like Mega Altaria and Mega Scizor with Haze. Greninja is able to break past physically defensive walls like opposing Toxapex, Mega Scizor,(AC) and Mega Venusaur, which are reliable answers to Barraskewda, while Greninja appreciates Barraskewda being able to handle specially defensive walls like Blissey and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Greninja offers Spikes support, which also assists Barraskewda in wallbreaking more efficiently.</p>"

Its Ghost typing also blocks common priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Breloom's Mach Punch, which allows it to sweep even when Psychic Terrain is not active. Though it is resisted by Steel-types, a Psychic Terrain-boosted Stored Power can still heavily damage even Corviknight, 2HKOing physically defensive variants after just one Shell Smash. Shadow Ball is a consistent STAB move with excellent neutral coverage to hit most Steel- and Psychic-types hard, OHKOing Gholdengo and Hatterene. Tera Blast with Tera Fighting fills a gap in Polteageist's coverage, eliminating Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Kingambit while Psychic Terrain is active, and Hydreigon. Tera Fighting can also let it survive their Dark-type attacks. Weak Armor alongside a Focus Sash allows Polteageist to punish a stray physical attack, further boosting its Speed—it can outspeed +1 foes like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth—and Stored Power's damage. Focus Sash also lets Polteageist set up against threats that would otherwise outpace it or survive an attack and OHKO it, such as Kingambit, Choice Specs Dragapult, and offensive Great Tusk. A Timid nature is run to outpace +1 Walking Wake after a single Shell Smash.</p> <p>Polteageist is a staple on Psychic Terrain offense teams. Indeedee's Psychic Terrain protects Polteageist against priority attacks from Kingambit, Azumarill, and Floatzel while powering up its Stored Power, though Polteageist requires both a Shell Smash and a Weak Armor boost to outpace Swift Swim Floatzel. Indeedee can also let Polteageist set up with Encore or give it a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish, although if Polteageist has already consumed its Focus Sash, it will struggle to set up as reliably a second time. Armarouge is an excellent teammate and another staple on Psychic Terrain teams, as it can eliminate Steel-types like Kingambit with Armor Cannon to enable Polteageist's late-game sweep and it can use Endure to activate Weak Armor multiple times against Dragon Darts Dragapult, which Polteageist cannot reliably set up against. In return, Polteageist can greatly weaken or outright eliminate Unaware walls, set up against specially offensive Dragapult if its Focus Sash is intact, and can safely utilize Tera Fighting to eliminate Roaring Moon and wear down Ting-Lu, which allows Armarouge to sweep. Entry hazard removal is extremely important to maintain Focus Sash's protection. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support, can safely get Polteageist in after using a strong Headlong Rush or Close Combat, and can also switch into and threaten Dark-types for Polteageist. Magic Bounce Hatterene deters entry hazards, spreads paralysis with Nuzzle, and can provide Healing Wish support. Also, Eject Button lets it safely pivot Polteageist in, even against U-Turns from Corviknight, Cinderace, or Meowscarada, giving it much easier setup opportunities. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragapult appreciate Polteageist breaking past Unaware walls and wearing down Steel-types. In return, Dragapult can use its multi-hit attacks to threaten opposing Psychic Terrain teams.</p>"

With Magic Bounce, it can switch into and reflect entry hazards from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Blissey. From there, it can begin setting up Calm Mind to pose a greater threat itself and overwhelm the opponent's defensive answers to it. Draining Kiss acts as pseudo-recovery and can help Hatterene heal off damage it's taken from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk. Psyshock allows Hatterene to deal high damage to special walls such as Blissey and Clodsire and win potential setup wars against other Hatterene. Stored Power fulfills a similar role to Psyshock in enabling Hatterene to break through special walls and other Calm Mind users and can also help Hatterene defeat various Unaware Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Dondozo, but it requires Hatterene to set up multiple Calm Minds before it becomes truly potent. Mystical Fire deals high damage to many of Hatterene's common switch-ins such as Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Kingambit and has the nice bonus of lowering the target's Special Attack, which is particularly useful against Gholdengo that aren't running Covert Cloak. Nuzzle is another option to cripple switch-ins with paralysis, which can act as useful speed control for Hatterene's teammates. Substitute is another alternative that allows Hatterene to more easily set up in the face of weak hits such as Garganacl's Salt Cure and Clodsire's Earthquake. Tera Water nullifies all of Hatterene's weaknesses, which can grant it more opportunities to use Calm Mind against its checks such as Gholdengo, while Tera Fire can similarly neutralize all of Hatterene's weaknesses and comes with additional benefits such as boosting the damage of its Mystical Fire and letting it check Iron Valiant better. However, Tera Fire also comes with notable downsides, namely giving Hatterene a weakness to Ground-type moves and Stealth Rock, which can hinder its matchups against common entry hazard setters. The EV spread allows Hatterene to move reliably switch into physical attacks from common entry hazard setters while also outspeeding Toxapex and Garganacl.</p> <p>Hatterene's ability to discourage the use of entry hazards will be appreciated by almost any team. Pokemon vulnerable to entry hazards and those that frequently pivot in and out of battle such as Meowscarada, Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Dragapult enjoy Hatterene's support. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight are also good partners, as Hatterene's presence can ease the burden placed on them to remove entry hazards and grants the team greater flexibility in dealing with entry hazard setters. Furthermore, while Hatterene can switch into entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, it can be worn down quickly from their repeated Ground-type attacks. Great Tusk and Corviknight can reduce Hatterene's need to switch in as often by acting as alternative switch-ins. Due to relying on Leftovers and Draining Kiss for recovery, Hatterene can struggle to stay healthy, particularly if it loses its Leftovers to Knock Off or is hit by Salt Cure, so it is recommended to have teammates that can switch into these moves. Corviknight can switch into Knock Off from hazard setters such as Meowscarada and Great Tusk, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo can neutralize Salt Cure. Pokemon holding Rocky Helmet such as Corviknight can be troublesome for Hatterene, as they will wear Hatterene down when it uses Nuzzle or Draining Kiss. Covert Cloak users, especially Gholdengo, are similarly irritating for Hatterene due to nullifying the secondary effect of its Nuzzle or Mystical Fire. Knock Off support from Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and Iron Valiant is thus appreciated to remove these items from the opponent's Pokemon. Hatterene's weakness to Steel- and Ghost-type attacks can be exploited by strong attackers such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Kingambit. Kingambit and Tera Water Garganacl can reliably switch into Gholdengo and Dragapult, while Great Tusk and Dondozo can counter Kingambit.</p>"

Psychic and Dazzling Gleam are STAB moves that let Hatterene remain threatening against hazard setters such as Toxapex, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Garchomp.

Alternatively, Mystical Fire lets Hatterene punish Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo that try to switch into it. Eject Button lets Hatterene sponge hits for its teammates and brings an offensive Pokemon safely onto the field. The Speed EVs allow Hatterene to outspeed Ting-Lu and paralyzed Adamant Dragonite, while the rest of its EVs are dedicated to its bulk. Tera Steel removes all of Hatterene's weaknesses which can, in turn, allow it to use Healing Wish in front of Pokemon that would otherwise directly threaten it such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Glimmora.</p> <p>Healing Wish Hatterene finds a place on hyper offense, sun, and Psychic Terrain teams, which all enjoy Hatterene's ability to stop entry hazards from going up and breaking Focus Sash and severely chipping Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock while also keeping momentum thanks to Eject Button. As such, Pokemon usually seen on these archetypes like Dragonite, Ceruledge, Iron Moth, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake, as well as Focus Sash users such as Breloom, Armarouge, and Polteageist, enjoy the presence of Hatterene. Offensive pivots such as Roaring Moon and Cinderace invite in defensive walls like Dondozo and Toxapex, against which Hatterene can use Healing Wish safely. Great Tusk can act as a secondary entry hazard control alongside Hatterene, preventing the latter from getting overwhelmed by repeating hits from entry hazards users like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and opposing Great Tusk. Said support is particularly useful on sun teams as keeping Stealth Rock off the field allows for Torkoal to remain healthy and thus set up sun repeated timed throughout the game.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Hatterene's access to Magic Bounce, a vast support movepool, and Eject Button gives it a key role on offense teams as a pivot and a way to prevent entry hazards. Healing Wish gives Hatterene the ability to fully heal one of its teammates, giving wallbreakers and setup Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Kingambit another chance to break through the opposing team. Mystical Fire is generally preferred over Dazzling Gleam to hit Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Kingambit on the switch, but Dazzling Gleam can be used to threaten Dragonite, Garchomp, and Dragapult. Nuzzle provides Hatterene with a way to punish Pokemon that would safely pivot into it otherwise, such as Heatran and Tornadus-T. Eject Button gives Hatterene the ability to take a hit and pivot into a teammate, letting frail wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y and Weavile come onto the field. Tera Steel removes Hatterene's weaknesses to Ghost and Steel, letting it pass a Healing Wish or cripple an opposing Pokemon such as Dragapult and Gholdengo while retaining its advantage against Dragon-types, though typically you would want to Terastallize a teammate for more offensive pressure. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Garganacl and Toxapex while maximizing its ability to pivot into physical attacks. Hatterene greatly benefits teams that rely on keeping entry hazards off the field, such as sun teams and some offense teams. As such, Mega Charizard Y is a fantastic partner, as it appreciates Hatterene keeping Stealth Rock off the field and walling Toxapex; in return, it is able to pressure Pokemon Hatterene brings in, such as Gholdengo and Kingambit. Focus Sash users such as Polteageist and Cloyster also make for good teammates thanks to Hatterene's ability to keep off hazards. Similarly, pivots such as Tapu Lele and Dragapult appreciate Hatterene's ability to keep off hazards and give them a second chance with Healing Wish, letting them come in safely and consistently. Hatterene's lack of longevity means that it usually cannot act as the sole form of hazard control. As such, Rapid Spin Great Tusk is a good partner alongside Hatterene for keeping hazards off of the field while also being able to support Mega Charizard Y on sun teams.</p>"

Magic Bounce gives Hatterene a way to switch into entry hazard setters, utilize Calm Mind to force them out, and avoid status from Pokemon such as Garchomp and Toxapex. Psyshock lets Hatterene beat opposing Calm Mind and Quiver Dance sweepers like Iron Valiant and Volcarona, while Stored Power lets it bypass Skeledirge with enough Calm Mind boosts. Mystical Fire hits Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Ferrothorn super effectively. Draining Kiss acts as a form of recovery for Hatterene. Tera Water gives Hatterene a solid defensive typing while removing its weakness to Steel-type attacks from the likes of Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Mega Scizor. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Garganacl and Toxapex, letting Hatterene take out Toxapex with an attack before having its boosts removed by Haze. Hatterene works well when paired with Pokemon that dislike entry hazards, such as defensive Pokemon without Heavy-Duty Boots. These include partners like Toxapex and Garganacl, which can check other offensive and defensive Pokemon, giving Hatterene the leeway for a late-game sweep. Flyinium Z Tornadus-T appreciates Hatterene being able to Terastallize to force opposing Gholdengo to Terastallize, as well as keeping hazards off the field for it. Kingambit and Garganacl are great partners for their ability to reliably check Ghost-types like Dragapult and Gholdengo, with Kingambit even being able to Pursuit trap them. Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor can check Kingambit for Hatterene as well. Hatterene's lack of longevity outside of Draining Kiss means that it appreciates a secondary form of entry hazard removal from teammates such as Tornadus-T, Zapdos, Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T. Alternatively, Hatterene enjoys pairing up with Spikes users such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, as they pressure the opponent into using Defog, alleviating Hatterene's need to block entry hazards, as well as wearing down Hatterene's answers such as Heatran and Gholdengo.</p>"

Espathra forms a strong offensive core with Hatterene that can threaten a wide range of types such as Water, Dragon, and Ground once Hatterene breaks down Espathra's checks. This core can be enabled further by setting up dual screens with Scream Tail. Indeedee and Gallade ease pressure from Ghost- and Dark-types, respectively. The former's Psychic Surge can power up Hatterene's Psyshock, and the latter can check Steel-types for Hatterene thanks to its strong Fighting-type STAB attacks.</p>"

Magic Bounce is especially notable, as it is the only form of entry hazard denial for Fairy teams. Calm Mind turns Hatterene into a deadly sweeper, notably stopping unboosted Flutter Mane from OHKOing it, instead OHKOing Flutter Mane in return after a single boost with Psyshock and letting Hatterene overheal Ting-Lu's Earthquake with Draining Kiss. Psyshock also lets Hatterene break through Unaware Clodsire, Dragalge, and Assault Vest Iron Hands, whereas Psychic 2HKOes Amoonguss and Toxapex as well as generally hitting targets for more damage overall. Draining Kiss gives Hatterene much-needed recovery, allowing it to heal against neutral and super effective targets, notably Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu. It can even beat Heavy Slam Ting-Lu with Reflect support from Klefki and Grimmsnarl. Mystical Fire threatens Steel-types like Scizor, Pressure Corviknight, and Gholdengo, which would otherwise safely switch into Hatterene and force it out. Alternatively, Giga Drain allows Hatterene to surprise foes like Gastrodon and Quagsire with an OHKO and generally allows Hatterene to win the Ground- and rainless Water-type matchups alone with minimal support; it can even be used sometimes over Draining Kiss depending on the team's needs, although the amount of HP regained is substantially less. Nuzzle can be used over Mystical Fire or Giga Drain to better support the team via paralysis. The given EVs let Hatterene outspeed an uninvested Toxapex so it can attack before its Calm Mind boosts are removed by Haze, with the rest of the EVs put into Defense to maximize bulk. If preferred, however, 204 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature can be used instead to have increased offensive potential, although at the cost of being more reliant on dual screens support; most notably, this lets Psyshock often OHKO Clodsire and Psychic always 2HKO both Unaware Clodsire and Quagsire. Heavy-Duty Boots is also an option over Leftovers as to more safely switch in when entry hazards are up, either from those that Hatterene could not block or simply was too pressured to switch into, although this does remove a large source of longevity.</p> <p>Dual screens support from Klefki and Grimmsnarl is almost essential, as it allows Hatterene to be much more aggressive with its Calm Mind boosts and switch-in opportunities. These teammates also provide extra support in Spikes from the former and both Taunt and Parting Shot from the latter, and in return, they can use Hatterene to block entry hazards from being set up, especially from Bombirdier and Ting-Lu. Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant can remove threats to Hatterene like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, Kingambit, and Chien-Pao as to facilitate setup opportunities for Hatterene, and they can rely on Hatterene to block hazards, especially Stealth Rock and Spikes. Tinkaton can neutralize Fairy- and Poison-type threats like Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, opposing Tinkaton, and Skuntank, which would otherwise impede on Hatterene's sweep, and set Stealth Rock and spread paralysis via Thunder Wave to ease sweeping opportunities further. Trick support from Iron Valiant and Gardevoir also helps Hatterene sweep, as this prevents bulkier Pokemon like Unaware Clodsire and Quagsire, Toxapex, and Dondozo from healing any damage taken and instead becoming setup fodder. Gardevoir also helps in the rain and sun matchups, as Trace copying Swift Swim and Chlorophyll removes the burden that Barraskewda, Floatzel, and Scovillain place by outspeeding and OHKOing all three. Azumarill and Mimikyu can support Hatterene as extra sweepers in order to overload the enemy's defensive core and majorly help in the Steel-type matchup that Hatterene dreads so much, notably pressuring Iron Treads, Kingambit, Corviknight, and Gholdengo.</p>"

It also prevents foes such as Volcarona and Annihilape from using Grimmsnarl as setup fodder. Spirit Break chips foes such as Ting-Lu and makes it easier to set up dual screens in front of special attackers such as Tapu Lele.

          "description": "<p>Indeedee-M's ability Psychic Surge along with its good utility movepool allows it to be a functional Psychic Terrain setter and staple on Psychic Terrain teams. Dazzling Gleam is good coverage that allows Indeedee-M to hit Dark-types like Roaring Moon and Hydreigon. Encore can punish foes by locking them into undesirable moves, such as Recover for Garganacl and Skeledirge, as well as preventing dangerous setup sweepers, such as Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant, and Substitute users, such as Hydreigon and Dragapult, from setting up. It can also lock foes into moves that Indeedee-M's teammates resist, allowing them to be used as setup fodder. Healing Wish sacrifices Indeedee-M in exchange for fully healing a teammate, which facilitates wallbreakers such as Armarouge, Volcarona, and Polteageist further weakening the opposing team. Additionally, Healing Wish provides a teammate a free switch-in, maximizing the number of turns in which they can take advantage of Psychic Terrain. Tera Fairy boosts the power of Dazzling Gleam, allowing Indeedee-M to OHKO Roaring Moon, Greninja, Meowscarada, and Dragapult after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fairy also allows Indeedee-M to use Healing Wish in front of Pokemon where it wouldn't usually be able to do so, such as Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, and Bug Buzz Volcarona, though it is almost always better to Terastallize a teammate instead, as Indeedee-M's immunity to Ghost-type attacks eases the matchup against Pokemon that are otherwise very threatening to Psychic Terrain teams, such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult.</p> <p>Indeedee-M is mandatory on Psychic Terrain teams. As such, teammates that effectively utilize the power boost to Psychic-type moves and enjoy the immunity to priority Psychic Terrain provides are good partners. Therefore, teammates such as Armarouge, Polteageist, and Volcarona are good partners that appreciate the power boost to Expanding Force, Stored Power, and Psychic, respectively. In particular, the Psychic Terrain boost allows +1 Tera Psychic Volcarona to OHKO Assault Vest Toxapex after Stealth Rock damage, demonstrating the potency wallbreakers have when Psychic Terrain is up. Additionally, teammates that provide entry hazard control are also good partners, as they allow Indeedee-M to set Psychic Terrain repeatedly throughout the game and keep the team's wallbreakers healthy. Therefore, Eject Pack Great Tusk and Eject Button Hatterene are good partners, as they do this while conserving momentum, providing opportunities for the team's wallbreakers.</p>"

Trick allows Indeedee-F to debilitate walls that would otherwise wall it, such as Tinkatuff and Misdreavus. Psyshock hits Special Walls such as Articuno and Lumineon harder due to their weaker physical bulk, but Psychic can be used instead, as it does more damage to more physically bulky Pokemon such as Perrserker and Gabite. Indeedee-F's last two moveslots are very flexible; Hyper Voice provides a strong alternative STAB move which also allows Indeedee-F to damage Dark-types such as Houndoom. Tera Blast provides a STAB move before Terastallizing and can be used with a Ground or Fairy Tera to allow Indeedee-F to hit Steel-types and Dark-types that would normally check it such as Perrserker, Tinkatuff, and Skuntank; however, it is weaker than Hyper Voice. Healing Wish can sacrificially and allow a partner Pokemon to come back in healthy after it has been damaged, building momentum. Indeedee-F can also viably run Tera Psychic, boosting up its Psychic-type attacks even further. Indeedee-F's preferred item is Choice Scarf, which allows it to act as a solid revenge killer against threats such as Alolan Persian and Zangoose, aswell as outspeeding other Choice Scarf users such as Skuntank, Lycanroc-N, and Honchkrow. Alternatively, Indeedee-F can opt for a Choice Specs set that allows it to be very powerful, enabling to OHKO or 2HKO the majority of the tier.</p> <p>Indeedee-F's main flaws are having issues breaking through common Steel- and Dark-types such as Tinkatuff and Skuntank if it does not want to Terastallize, or a teammate had previously Terastillized and it's difficult to get in safely. As such, Pokemon like Dugtrio, Charizard, and Carbink are excellent partners. Dugtrio in particular is an excellent partner, as with Indeedee's Psychic Terrain it does not fear getting revenged killed from priority from Basculin's Aqua Jet and Zangoose's Quick Attack. U-turn and Volt Switch from Pokemon such as Articuno and Ampharos can give Indeedee-F a free switch in the battle. Sticky Web Masquerain can be used with Choice Specs variants to help with the lackluster speed. Pokemon that struggle against walls, like Golduck, appreciate Choice Specs Indeedee-F breaking through bulkier foes like Articuno and Gogoat. Pokemon normally easily revenged killed by priority such as Pyroar and the aforementioned Dugtrio appreciate having Indeedee-F help keep their HP high with Healing Wish as well as setting up Psychic Terrian.</p>"

Slush Rush lets Arctozolt outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under snow, including foes such as Dragapult and Weavile, though its inability to outspeed boosted foes such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and its pitiful Speed outside of snow hinders its sweeping potential. Freeze-Dry is an alternative to Blizzard that lets Arctozolt break through foes such as Gastrodon and Mega Swampert, but the lack of consistency outside of these matchups makes it a less desirable choice. Low Kick provides coverage for foes such as Ferrothorn, Kingambit, and Mega Tyranitar. Substitute takes advantage of forced switches against foes such as the aforementioned Toxapex and Tornadus-T to ease prediction and avoid potential revenge killers such as the aforementioned Tapu Lele, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lopunny. The Defense boost from snow also helps preserve Arctozolt's Substitute, granting it more safe turns. Heavy-Duty Boots alleviates Arctozolt's major Stealth Rock weakness, granting it more opportunities to wallbreak. Alternatively, Leftovers can be used with entry hazard control to improve Arctozolt's longevity and grant more opportunities to use Substitute. Tera Electric is used to boost Bolt Beak's power and remove Arctozolt's weakness to Stealth Rock, but it loses the Defense boost from snow. Slowking is a mandatory teammate to support Arctozolt, setting snow and acting as a slow pivot to grant it safe entry. Mega Diancie provides entry hazard support to weaken foes such as Ferrothorn and helps deny opposing entry hazards for Arctozolt. Arctozolt struggles against revenge killers such as Mega Scizor and Choice Scarf Kartana, so it appreciates teammates such as Heatran and Tornadus-T handling them. Tornadus-T also provides reliable entry hazard removal so Arctozolt can use Leftovers.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Hex Dragapult serves as great offensive support for Dragon teams, catching common switch-ins to Choice Specs Dragapult, such as Alolan Muk and Iron Hands, off guard by incapacitating them with Will-O-Wisp. With Substitute, Dragapult acts as a stallbreaker against types like Water, Poison, and Ground lacking Ursaluna-B, as burned defensive pivots like Clodsire will be unable to break its Substitute, allowing Dragapult to fire off powerful moves in Hex in conjunction with status ailments and Dragon Darts. Will-O-Wisp also punishes Sucker Punch users like Kingambit, granting Dragon a bit more breathing room against these threats, as well as bulky setup sweepers like Zamazenta and Corviknight. Thunder Wave can be considered if Shed Tail support from Cyclizar is available, as this allows Dragapult to neutralize threats like Iron Valiant, Volcarona, and special Choice Scarf users like Flutter Mane and Enamorus, which do not mind being burned. With 148 SpA EVs, Dragapult OHKOes Flutter Mane with Hex after it is statused, while the remaining EVs are invested in Attack and Speed to maximize the potency of Dragon Darts to make Dragapult as threatening as possible in the Dragon matchup. Infiltrator lets Dragapult OHKO statused Flutter Mane regardless, even behind Light Screen, revenge kill Frosmoth and Baxcalibur behind Substitute, and also inflict burns on Iron Defense Zamazenta behind Substitute.</p> <p>Since Hex Dragapult weakens the offensive capabilities of bulky walls such as Corviknight, Alolan Muk, and Iron Hands, teammates like Dragon Dance Baxcalibur, Clangorous Soul Kommo-o, and Dragon Dance Dragonite can capitalize on these openings to set up and tear through opposing Flying-, Dark-, and Fighting-type teams. Baxcalibur also helps in breaking down bulkier types like Flying, Ground, and Poison, cleans up types like Dragon late-game, and picks off Choice Scarf Enamorus and Meowscarada with Ice Shard. Kommo-o provides powerful priority in Vacuum Wave to deal with Chien-Pao and Kingambit and has the ability to clean types such as Ice and Dark after a Clangorous Soul boost. Wallbreakers like Choice Specs Walking Wake and Choice Band Roaring Moon help Dragapult overwhelm threats such as Alolan Muk, Iron Hands, and Gholdengo, which can be hard to take down for Dragon teams. Alternatively, these teammates can don a Choice Scarf, allowing Walking Wake to deal with Chien-Pao and boosted Baxcalibur and Roaring Moon to obliterate Flutter Mane and opposing Dragapult. Entry hazard support from Grachomp and Dragalge are also great, as they make Dragapult more punishing to swap into, and Dragalge's Toxic Spikes are able to status Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, which lets Dragapult spam Hex and prioritize getting a Substitute up in matchups like Fairy and Fighting. Garchomp also punishes prospective Knock Offs against Dragapult from Roaring Moon, Empoleon, and Iron Treads, thanks to Rough Skin and its typing to punish these threats back. Cyclizar can Shed Tail into Dragapult, enabling it to use another status move. In return, Dragapult dissuades Fighting-type attacks by its mere presence on teams, allowing Cyclizar to more safely enter the field. Cyclizar itself also supports Dragapult by providing a Ghost immunity, which is useful in dealing with foes such as Ceruledge and Gengar, and provides hazard removal to prevent Dragapult from being chipped down and let it more freely set up Substitutes. Hisuian Goodra is a great special wall that is able to take on Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant for Dragapult. In return, Dragapult burns and wears down opposing defensive pieces like Iron Hands for it.</p>"

          "description": "<p>As the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the Monotype metagame, Choice Specs Dragapult is an excellent offensive threat that deals with Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Greninja for Dragon teams. Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball are helpful against a variety of types lacking the necessary immunities and can be used to decimate types such as Dark, Flying, Fairy, and Ghost. Flamethrower roasts Steel-types such as Corviknight and Scizor without the risk of getting stalled by Pressure, and Thunderbolt nails Toxapex and Dondozo and cleans Water teams late-game. Alternatively, U-turn brings in team mates like Baxcalibur, Garchomp, and Hydreigon, which take advantage of common switch-ins such as Ting Lu, Clodsire, and Kingambit. Infiltrator lets Dragapult bypass dual screens, which is sorely needed to properly deal with Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Since Dragapult excels at cleaning teams with its natural speed, wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Hydreigon, Baxcalibur, and Choice Band Haxorus, as well as entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Dragalge are excellent teammates. Dragonite loves Dragapult's ability to wear down or outright remove Steel-, Water-, and Ghost-types such as Klefki, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, allowing it to clean up types such as Fairy, Water, and Fire with a Dragon Dance or Choice Band set. Choice Scarf users like Baxcalibur, Hydreigon, and Roaring Moon are appreciated, as these deal with opposing Choice Scarf users such as Gallade and Gholdengo, which revenge kill Dragapult with ease.

        "Hex (Ghost)": {
          "description": "<p>Dragapult carries a plethora of utility options in its movepool to hinder the opposition. It leverages its high Speed to outspeed and threaten Zamazenta, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao with status for its teammates. Heavy-Duty Boots also enables Dragapult to switch in much more often. Will-O-Wisp weakens physical attackers that pose a threat to Ghost teams, such as Great Tusk, Urshifu-R, and Kingambit, while Thunder Wave disrupts faster opposition such as Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott, Ogerpon-H, and Zamazenta. Hex is also a great choice for beating Gliscor and other Pokemon affected by Dragapult spreading status. U-turn is another great form of support as it lets Dragapult, scout switches and bring in its teammates safely. Dragapult's ability, Infiltrator, also grants it the capability to hinder the likes of Substitute Zamazenta and Enamorus, and ignore dual screens set up by Klefki in the Fairy matchup. The given EV spread allows Dragapult to guarantee a 2HKO against Hatterene after recovery from Leftovers and always outspeed Zamazenta.</p> <p>Flutter Mane is the biggest beneficiary of Dragapult's services, as it can outspeed Choice Scarf users crippled by Thunder Wave or live a few physical attacks from foes burned by Will-O-Wisp such as Earthquake from Landorus-T and Dire Claw from Sneasler. Flutter Mane repays Dragapult by blasting through Dark-types that give Ghost teams trouble such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Darkrai, and, if using a Choice Scarf, Chien-Pao. Spectrier is another great teammate for taking advantage of the status spread by Dragapult by threatening to win games with Hex. Dragapult's status also allows Spectrier to freely run Substitute and Nasty Plot together without needing to run Will-O-Wisp. Dragapult also safely pivots both Flutter Mane and Spectrier in, which is useful as both are quite frail. Gholdengo is an excellent choice, as with a Hex set, it is able to use the status spread by Dragapult to great effect and enhance its power, while with a Choice Scarf, it can threaten Chien-Pao, poses a threat to Dragapult with its priority moves. Skeledirge is a good choice as well, as it can withstand hits and reply back with a boosting Torch Song while also posing a threat to Heatran with Earth Power. Skeledirge also threatens Ice-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Frosmoth. Hisuian Zoroark is a much appreciated Ghost immunity that can deceive opponents into thinking it may be Dragapult or its vulnerable teammates, then take advantage of that to unleash powerful attacks against opposing Spectrier and Ceruledge or cripple walls such as Toxapex and Empoleon with Knock Off. Substitute Sinistcha is another choice to take care of one of Ghost's biggest problems in Ursaluna-B. Dragapult's spreading of status also allows for Mimikyu and Ceruledge to set up much more easily to threaten Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Steel-types like Corviknight, respectively. Mimikyu is also a one-time check to Chien-Pao and Kingambit with Disguise, both of which greatly threaten Ghost teams. Brambleghast can set up Spikes, which can wear down the opposition quickly in conjunction with burns from Dragapult's Will-O-Wisp, while Gengar can set up Toxic Spikes, letting Dragapult and Spectrier use Hex much more often.</p>"
        },
        "Dragon Dance (Ghost)": {
          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance gives Dragapult the ability to not just boost its fantastic Speed to new heights, allowing it to outspeed fast Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada and Roaring Moon, but also beef up its decent Attack stat. Dragon Darts is a reliable, hard-hitting Dragon-type STAB move that allows Dragapult to break Breloom's Focus Sash and Dragonite's Multiscale. Phantom Force is Dragapult's best choice for Ghost-tpye STAB move, as otherwise it is walled by any Fairy- or Steel-type, while Disable can disrupt Choice-locked Pokemon from potentially breaking its Substitute or attacking Dragapult in general. Substitute allows Dragapult to ease prediction and also adds a layer of protection against status moves, allowing it to set up on more passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. It also synergizes well with Disable, allowing Dragapult to set up with ease. Will-O-Wisp is another option over Disable to allow Clodsire and Quagsire to become setup bait, while also crippling Kingambit and Ting-Lu; however, Disable is more consistent. Leftovers allows Dragapult to use Substitute multiple times throughout a game and be more annoying overall with Disable, while Dragon Fang is a good choice to boost Dragon Darts.</p> <p>Skeledirge is a fantastic partner, as it can wall Fairy-types such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Hatterene while also threatening foes like Kingambit that can easily take out Dragapult with their STAB priority moves. Gholdengo is another fantastic partner that can threaten Fairy-types like Klefki and Flutter Mane, if Gholdengo uses a Choice Scarf, and take care of physical walls such as opposing Skeledirge. Brambleghast is another good partner, as it can keep entry hazards off of the field, allowing Dragapult to come in multiple times, as well as providing Spikes support to soften up Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Iron Treads. Hisuian Zoroark provides the team with not just a Ghost immunity, but also can easily use Illusion to disguise itself as Dragapult and lure in foes that would normally threaten it, such as Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and opposing Dragapult, to open up for a potential Dragapult sweep. Flutter Mane is another great partner thanks to its ability to handle opposing Dragon-types such as Baxcalibur, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. It can also provide immediate speed control if need be to take care of other Choice Scarf users that could revenge kill Dragapult before it gets a Dragon Dance up. Mimikyu is an amazing wallbreaker that can either help wear down physical walls for Dragapult to clean up or can take advantage of Dragapult punching holes in the opponent's team to clean up itself. Mimikyu can also heavily threaten opposing Ghost-types for Dragapult like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo thanks to its STAB priority in Shadow Sneak. It also provides a one-time check to setup sweepers such as Chien-Pao and Kingambit thanks to its ability Disguise.</p>"

Zacian can struggle to handle extremely powerful physical wallbreakers like Groudon and Mold Breaker Koraidon by itself, so secondary physical walls like Fur Coat Arceus formes are appreciated as teammates; they can also Imposter-proof Zacian. Despite outspeeding threats like Palkia-O and Flutter Mane, Zacian cannot switch in, so a special wall like Ice Scales Dialga-O or Chansey can help pivot Zacian in.

Knock Off users like Ting-Lu and Groudon are mandatory for Wide Lens sets to remove Rocky Helmet. While Zacian can remove hazards with Rapid Spin, hazard setters often carry moves that can heavily cripple it like Nuzzle and Knock Off, making another hazard remover like Tidy Up Groudon or Mortal Spin Ting-Lu a good choice. Groudon notably also pressures Fairy-resistant Pokemon like Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Fire well.

Substitute is an option that should be used exclusively on hyper offense teams, allowing Zacian-C to generate momentum on a predicted switch into a check like Skeledirge.</li> <li>While Intrepid Sword allows Zacian-C to threaten to KO many staples in the tier such as Arceus-Fairy, Kyogre, and Eternatus, Intrepid Sword only working once per battle means that one should think twice before sending Zacian-C onto the field, as wasting its ability makes for massive loss in damage output.</li> <li>Tera Blast can be used in conjunction with Tera Ground or Tera Water as a way to 2HKO Skeledirge. Wild Charge can be used instead to deal with Toxapex, Corviknight, defensive Kyogre, and Arceus-Water.

A Defense drop on the switch can also force it out. Tera Dark can be used in combination with Crunch, as it then 2HKOes Skeledirge.</li> <li>Tera Fire allows Zacian-C to take on Skeledirge and Arceus-Fairy more comfortably, making it immune to Will-O-Wisp and giving it a resistance to Fire.</li> <li>Tera Flying is another great tool to take Ground-types that would otherwise offensively check Zacian-C, like Groudon and Arceus-Ground, by surprise, transforming its weakness into an immunity and allowing Zacian-C to have a crucial free turn to beat its would-be checks.</li> <li>Tera Ground and Tera Water let Zacian-C 2HKO Skeledirge on the switch with Tera Blast and allow it to survive previously super effective moves like Groudon's Precipice Blades, Arceus-Ground's Judgment at +1, and Arceus's Earthquake at +2.</li> <li>Zacian-C's excellent traits make it one of the best choices for bulky offense and hyper offense teams. Its blistering Speed lets it revenge kill many unboosted tier staples such as Koraidon, Miraidon, Arceus, and Eternatus. Its excellent Fairy typing also lets it check Choice Scarf Miraidon and Koraidon locked into a Dragon-type attack, and its high physical firepower makes it one of the best wallbreakers at forcing Calm Mind Arceus variants out.</li> <li>Zacian-C has trouble breaking through physical walls like Groudon, Skeledirge, Corviknight, and Toxapex, which makes Miraidon a good teammate, as it threatens to OHKO them with its powerful STAB moves. Hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Groudon also make for good partners, as they help to put Zacian-C's targets into OHKO range. Ting-Lu can also check Miraidon sets, while Groudon is a good check to most Koraidon sets.</li> <li>Kyogre makes for a good teammate, as it sets rain that reduces the damage Zacian-C takes from Fire-type attacks while also boosting Tera Blast Water, allowing Zacian-C to 2HKO Tera Fairy Skeledirge.</li> <li>Choice Band Koraidon is a particularly strong partner for Zacian-C, as it can force Skeledirge to commit to using Tera Fairy due to Dragon Claw being able to 2HKO it otherwise, letting Zacian-C pressure it heavily with Behemoth Blade. In return, if Zacian-C forces Skeledirge to commit to using Tera Fairy, Choice Band Koraidon can then threaten to OHKO it with a Tera Fire- and Orichalcum Pulse-boosted Flare Blitz.

Wild Charge, when boosted by Swords Dance, breaks through Toxapex, defensive Kyogre, and Arceus-Water. Close Combat OHKOes Arceus, breaks through Tera Steel Giratina-O, and eases prediction versus Tera Fire or Steel Koraidon. Crunch can instead be used to pressure Skeledirge, but this option is generally outclassed by the others. Tera Fire lets Zacian-C resist Koraidon's Flare Blitz and gives it a burn immunity. Tera Flying lets Zacian-C flip the matchup versus Landorus-T, defensive Arceus-Ground, and defensive Groudon, giving it more chances to set up. Tera Steel is another option to power up Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade, giving it favorable odds to OHKO Landorus-T, Arceus-Ground, and defensive Groudon after Swords Dance with a layer of Spikes. Zacian-C fits well on bulky offense and hyper offense builds, where it can act as both a revenge killer and sweeper and take advantage of Arceus-Fairy. Zacian-C can come in on Dragon-type moves from Koraidon, Miraidon, and Eternatus and force them out with its powerful STAB attacks. This is appreciated by offensive teams without a solid defensive core and those with Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Koraidon. However, Zacian-C has issues breaking through physical walls such as Skeledirge, Landorus-T, and Toxapex without Terastallization. As a result, partners that can overwhelm these walls, such as Koraidon and Arceus, or switch into them, like Kyogre and Giratina-O, are appreciated. Calyrex-S pairs well with Zacian-C by heavily pressuring all of Zacian-C's checks and using them as setup fodder with Nasty Plot. Conversely, Zacian-C checks Arceus for Calyrex-S. Calyrex-S is another issue for Zacian-C, since it outspeeds Zacian-C and threatens to OHKO it when using Choice Specs or with enough chip damage, so partners such as Arceus and Choice Scarf Koraidon on all builds, Ting-Lu on bulky offense and balance, and Kingambit on hyper offense are good for pressuring Calyrex-S. Choice Scarf users such as Koraidon and Miraidon can also revenge Zacian-C, so checks to them such as Landorus-T and Ting-Lu, respectively, are appreciated.</p>"

Its natural bulk and Dauntless Shield give it opportunities to wallbreak via its prowess in offensively checking Mega Lopunny, Hisuian Samurott, and Ogerpon-W. Stone Edge pairs fantastically with Zamazenta's STAB, nailing Volcarona, Zapdos, Moltres, and Tornadus-T while avoiding adverse contact effects from the former three. Ice Fang is Zamazenta's only option to break through Gliscor and Landorus-T and its strongest attack against Dragonite. Heavy Slam is the preferred last coverage move to hit Clefable and render Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant incapable of soft checking Zamazenta, while Crunch threatens Psychic-types in Galarian Slowking, Slowbro, and Mega Latias. Wild Charge is Zamazenta's strongest attack against Toxapex but deals pitiful damage regardless without a Choice Band and can still be easily pivoted against even with the boost. Heavy-Duty Boots increase Zamazenta's longevity, allowing it to switch in and threaten opposing teams more often, whereas Choice Band provides more immediate power, albeit at the cost of being incredibly prediction-reliant to break through most teams carrying multiple Fighting-resistant foes. Rockium Z is a niche alternative that reduces difficulties in KOing Zapdos by minimizing the need for prior chip damage mitigating and Stone Edge's meager accuracy. It also helps in breaking through Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Clefable and Galarian Slowking without the correct coverage move once properly chipped. Tera Fighting is preferred to boost Close Combat's power against neutral targets such as Ogerpon-W and Alomomola, with chances to OHKO and 2HKO them, respectively, without Choice Band and muscle through checks such as Tornadus-T. Alternatively, Tera Steel flips the tables against Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's revenge killing attempts and secures the KO on Clefable after minimal chip. Zamazenta can fit on more defensive teams as speed control that forces out offensive terrors such as Ogerpon-W to supplement a defensive core, or it can be used on offensive teams supported by other wallbreakers while helping check threats to such teams such as Mega Lopunny with its natural bulk and Dauntless Shield. Regardless, its best support remains Future Sight from Tapu Lele, Galarian Slowking, or Slowbro, as Zamazenta is most often handled by switching between Pokemon that resist its moves and physically bulky pivots such as Galarian Slowking, Landorus-T, and Alomomola or stopped in its tracks by Toxapex. Future Sight punishes these situations by dealing massive damage, particularly against Toxapex. Similarly, Pursuit support from Mega Tyranitar and Weavile weakens or removes pivots such as Galarian Slowking, Mega Latias, and Zapdos.</p>"

Alternatively, Crunch can be used to deal with Galarian Slowking and is also stronger than Heavy Slam against Pokemon such as Ferrothorn that commonly Terastallize into the Ghost typing, and Stone Edge is another option that threatens Volcarona and Zapdos while avoiding Flame Body and Static, respectively, and allows Zamazenta to deal with Tornadus-T without the need to Terastallize. Zamazenta struggles to break through Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking, Zapdos, and Toxapex that have the bulk to take multiple boosted Body Press and either threaten it back directly or can use Haze to remove Zamazenta's boosts. Therefore, teammates such as Mega Tyranitar that can Pursuit trap and wear down these Pokemon are invaluable. Other options such as Calm Mind Iron Valiant can also trade for heavy damage against most of these Pokemon, clearing the way for Zamazenta to sweep. Tera Electric allows Zamazenta to turn Zapdos into a setup opportunity, resisting both of its STAB attacks and being unafraid of Static, while Tera Steel allows Zamazenta to set up on Choice-locked Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant as well as turning Heavy Slam into an OHKO on both.</p>"

Finally, Crunch targets opposing Ghost-types such as Spectrier and Gholdengo. 8 HP EVs in conjunction with 32 Special Defense EVs prevent Zamazenta from being OHKOed by Choice Scarf Flutter Mane's Moonblast, allowing Zamazenta to revenge kill it with Heavy Slam.</p> <p>Choice Band Zamazenta appreciates Great Tusk's ability to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin so it is not chipped down over time by Spikes. Great Tusk is also able to assist Zamazenta by setting Stealth Rock so Zamazenta has an easier time securing OHKOs against Pokemon such as Gliscor. Choice Scarf Sneasler pairs well with Zamazenta due to its ability to dispatch opposing Fairy-type Pokemon like Enamorus and Azumarill. Sneasler can also use Switcheroo to disrupt defensive walls such as Toxapex by removing their items and locking them into a status move, allowing Zamazenta to eventually wear them down. Iron Valiant is a beneficial partner for Zamazenta, being able to threaten Sableye and Mandibuzz as well as other physical walls such as Toxapex and Gliscor, which can be useful depending on Zamazenta's choice of coverage moves. With a Choice Scarf, Iron Valiant can further threaten Dragapult and opposing Zamazenta, and cripple defensive walls with Trick. Assault Vest Iron Hands can act as a switch-in to opposing Fairy-type Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Flutter Mane and threaten them back with Heavy Slam. Iron Hands is also useful in handling opposing Flying-types like Corviknight, Articuno, and Gliscor thanks to its Electric and Ice coverage, and can further provide Zamazenta with a safe switch in thanks to Volt Switch. Kommo-o can block Gholdengo's Shadow Ball with Bulletproof and threaten it in return with Flamethrower, which is useful as this is a foe Zamazenta struggles to deal with. Kommo-o finds extra utility as a switch-in to Skeledirge, and can force it out if opting to run Choice Specs. In return, Zamazenta can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and threaten them with Heavy Slam, which otherwise stop Kommo-o easily. Hisuian Lilligant pairs well with Zamazenta, taking on defensive Gliscor, Clodsire, and Dragonite with its Hustle-boosted Ice Spinner. It is also able to use its Grass-type STAB moves to threaten bulky Water-types that can switch into Zamazenta such as Dondozo and Azumarill. Gallade threatens opposing Poison-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Amoonguss; in exchange, Gallade appreciates Zamazenta's ability to punish Landorus-T with Ice Fang. Okidogi, like Sneasler, can threaten Fairy-types like Azumarill and Iron Valiant. In addition, Okidogi's use of Taunt + Bulk Up can stallbreak Zamazenta's defensive checks like Toxapex and Corviknight. Urshifu-R is another excellent teammate to Zamazenta, with its Surging Strikes proving deadly to many of Zamazenta's most troublesome foes such as Gliscor, Skeledirge, Ceruledge, and Volcarona.</p>"

        "Iron Defense": {
          "description": "<p>Zamazenta excels in matchups that Fighting typically struggles against, such as the Fighting mirror, Ground, and Fairy, since it is able to outspeed threats such as Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, set up Iron Defense on physical attackers, and punish more passive Pokemon. Substitute allows Zamazenta to take advantage of passive foes such as Gliscor, Clodsire, and Amoonguss that can't break its Substitute in one hit, allowing it to start setting up Iron Defense and preventing it from being hindered by status. Heavy Slam is important, as Zamazenta outspeeds big Fairy-type threats such as non-Choice Scarf Enamorus and Flutter Mane. Heavy Slam also prevents Zamazenta from being walled by Iron Valiant in the Fighting mirror matchup. 252 Speed EVs allow Zamazenta to outspeed Jolly Barraskewda outside of rain and Flutter Mane, while 248 HP EVs allow it to set up four Substitutes.</p> <p>Iron Hands, with its great special bulk paired with Assault Vest, complements Zamazenta's physical bulk well, being able to take hits from threatening Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene while also being a big help in the Flying matchup with its access to Ice Punch and Thunder Punch to hit Zapdos and Enamorus-T. Great Tusk provides great physical bulk alongside Zamazenta and is also able to bring wallbreaking potential, with access to Ice Spinner to hit Flying-types such as Gliscor and Headlong Rush to hit Poison-types such as Unaware Clodsire and Toxapex, which are both hindrances for Zamazenta. Great Tusk is also able to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin to prevent passive chip on Zamazenta while also running Knock Off to prevent Ghost-types from spinblocking. Iron Valiant provides the special offense Fighting desperately needs in order to break physical walls such as Dondozo and Slowbro that Zamazenta struggles against, and is also able to hit Ghost-types that can wall Zamazenta, such as Skeledirge and Sinistcha, with Shadow Ball. Iron Valiant can also run Trick to disable Toxapex and Clodsire and stop them from stalling out Zamazenta. Sneasler provides great coverage against Fairy-types, with Dire Claw being able to hit threats such as Enamorus. Additionally, Choice Scarf Sneasler outspeeds Choice Specs Flutter Mane while also being able to set up Toxic Spikes to cripple more defensive Pokemon such as Scream Tail. Sneasler also can run Switcheroo to hinder Toxapex and Clodsire, similarly to Iron Valiant. It also offers great pivot potential with U-turn, and can put Pokemon like Unaware Quagsire, which normally walls Zamazenta, on a timer when paired with Poison Touch. Hisuian Lilligant is a great setup threat with its access to Victory Dance and is able to threaten Flying- and Water-types such as Azumarill, Zapdos, and Toxapex with Ice Spinner and Leaf Blade at +1. Hisuian Lilligant also has access to Healing Wish as support for Zamazenta. Choice Band Galarian Zapdos is a great wallbreaker, 2HKOing Toxapex and Sinistcha. Another great wallbreaker is Urshifu-R, which helps with the Ghost matchup because it can deal with Gholdengo and Skeledirge if it is using a Choice Band or after a Swords Dance boost. Gallade is a niche Pokemon to use but helps with the Poison matchup that Zamazenta struggles with, thanks to its access to Sharpness-boosted Psycho Cut. It's also able to run Assault Vest to lure and remove Enamorus's Choice Scarf with Knock Off, which allows Zamazenta to use Heavy Slam against it. Assault Vest also lets Gallade deal with Quagsire and Toxapex instead of forcing a prediction.</p>"

In either case, the loss of Flamethrower leaves Eternatus more passive generally.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb is much less reliable at setting poison than Toxic is; however, it allows Eternatus to have a chance against Calm Mind Tera Fairy Kyogre sets, which may otherwise use Substitute to block Toxic.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Eternatus to outspeed base 120 Speed Pokemon like Arceus and Palkia-O, with the rest of the EVs dumped into bulk.</li> <li>Heavy-Duty Boots is optimal on teams lacking entry hazard removal, while Leftovers works better when Eternatus is paired with Giratina-O or Corviknight.</li> <li>Tera Fairy is used, as its Dragon-type immunity is useful against Koraidon and Miraidon, and it provides a neutrality to Ice. Tera Water provides Eternatus with a resistance to Ice, making it much more reliable against Kyogre sets lacking Thunder, and a resistance to Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade.</li> <li>Eternatus is very difficult to switch into generally, since it has strong neutral coverage and can poison most switch-ins. Its most reliable checks are Clodsire, Blissey, and Arceus-Poison, all of which don't care about being poisoned and can use Eternatus as a free setup opportunity. Exerting enough offensive pressure helps deal with these threats.</li> <li>Eternatus works well as a third or fourth pokemon on defensive cores, since it absorbs Toxic Spikes and takes on the aforementioned Arceus formes and Kyogre.

Dragon Tail phazes setup sweepers like Arceus and Calm Mind Kyogre, and it can also annoy switch-ins to Eternatus such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire with Toxic Spikes able to poison the former. Toxic is used to immediately put Pokemon such as Calm Mind Arceus formes on a timer, while Toxic Spikes is used to spread status across the opposing team. Tera Fairy makes Eternatus immune to Dragon-type moves from Pokemon such as Miraidon and Koraidon.

Both Fire Blast and Flamethrower are used for Zacian-C and Tera Steel Pokemon. Fire Blast is preferred because it OHKOes Zacian-C with one layer of Spikes, but Flamethrower is a more reliable, weaker alternative. Recover allows Eternatus to preserve its HP, allowing it to have its presence for longer in the game. After one Agility, Eternatus outspeeds the whole metagame, making it harder to revenge kill and potentially letting it clean up weakened teams. Since Agility makes Eternatus faster than the whole metagame, a Modest nature can be run for more power. Alternatively, Toxic Spikes can be run to rack up poison damage on foes for teammates. Tera Steel gives Eternatus a much-needed resistance to Dragon-type moves from Koraidon and Miraidon, Extreme Speed from Arceus, Psychic-type moves from Calyrex-S, and Steel- and Fairy-type moves from Zacian-C. Tera Fire also helps against Zacian-C, lets Fire Blast OHKO Tera Steel Giratina-O after Stealth Rock, and lets Flamethrower OHKO Zacian-C.

Calyrex-S, Eternatus, and Miraidon weaken Ting-Lu for each other, enabling one of them to potentially sweep. This allows Pokemon like Extreme Killer Arceus, Arceus-Fairy, and Arceus-Ground to use Eternatus getting revenge killed as an opportunity. Extreme Killer Arceus can use Choice-locked Calyrex-S as an opportunity to set up Swords Dance, Arceus-Fairy can use Koraidon to set up Calm Mind, and Arceus-Ground can threaten out Zacian-C, enabling it to set up Dragon Dance or Calm Mind.

          "description": "<p>With the Speed boost from Choice Scarf, Urshifu-R is one of the strongest pivots and cleaners in the metagame. It can outspeed many common threats like Mega Lopunny, Greninja, Ogerpon-W, Mega Diancie, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele while also being able to revenge kill many setup sweepers even after a boost, such as Mega Gyarados and Gouging Fire. Addtionally, Surging Strikes allows Urshifu-R to OHKO Focus Sash users like Glimmora and Landorus-T while also improving its matchup against Zamazenta, bypassing its Dauntless Shield Defense boost. U-turn provides Urshifu-R the utility to gain momentum from its checks like Alomomola, Slowbro, Toxapex, and Corviknight. Aqua Jet can serve as a backup plan to revenge kill faster setup sweepers like Volcarona, while Thunder Punch can hit bulky Water-types like Alomomola, Toxapex, and Slowbro as well as Corviknight. Tera Water enables Urshifu-R to achieve valuable OHKOes versus the likes of Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Mega Lopunny, while also strengthening Aqua Jet to better combat setup sweepers like Iron Boulder. Teammates like Raging Bolt and Tapu Lele appreciate Urshifu-R's ability to bring them in against bulky defensive walls like Corviknight, Alomomola, and Toxapex. Tapu Lele can also set strong Future Sight for Urshifu-R to abuse and break through Toxapex. However, it is recommended to not to use Aqua Jet when Urshifu-R is paired with Tapu Lele due to its Psychic Surge. Abilities like Rough Skin, Static, and Flame Body as well as Rocky Helmet punish Choice Scarf Urshifu-R due to the multi-hit nature of Surging Strikes, so teammates with access to Knock Off like Landorus-T and Tornadus-T are useful to help Urshifu-R by removing Rocky Helmet from the aforementioned foes as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Zapdos and Moltres.</p>"

        "Swords Dance (Water)": {
          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Urshifu-R is a good choice on Water teams thanks to its high Attack - further boosted by Swords Dance - and decent Speed tier, allowing it to dispatch many of the metagame's defensive staples such as Unaware Clodsire, Alolan Muk, and Corviknight. Swords Dance allows Urshifu-R to set up on a predicted switch. Surging Strikes is a generally powerful move that allows Urshifu-R to muscle past threats such as Bulk Up Corviknight and defensive Gholdengo after a Swords Dance. Close Combat hits Dark- and Steel-types such as Hydreigon and Hisuian Goodra that try to switch in on Surging Strikes, while Drain Punch is weaker but provides some much-appreciated recovery. Finally, Urshifu-R has many viable options for its 4th moveslot; Aqua Jet deters Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane from attempting to revenge kill Urshifu-R, Thunder Punch hits Flying-types such as Pelipper as well as heavily damaging Toxapex, and Ice Punch hits Water Absorb Clodsire, Garchomp, and Flying-types such as Zapdos and Dragonite. Zen Headbutt can be run to damage Amoonguss and do well against Poison teams. Punching Glove allows Urshifu to gain a small boost to its punching moves while being protected from Zapdos's Static and other contact-punishing abilities.</p> <p>Greninja and Hisuian Samurott are great teammates for Urshifu-R, as they take Psychic-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Indeedee's Psychic and Choice Band Hoopa-U's Zen Headbutt with impunity and punish them with Dark Pulse and Ceaseless Edge, respectively. Hisuian Samurott also sets Spikes to aid in Urshifu-R's wallbreaking efforts, while Greninja can threaten Fighting-types that Urshifu-R struggles with such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Sneasler with Extrasensory. In return, Urshifu-R can take Bug-type attacks such as Choice Band Scizor's U-turn and Choice Scarf Kleavor's X-Scissor, as well as threaten opposing Dark-types such as Chien-Pao. Pelipper provides rain support to augment Urshifu-R's already scary wallbreaking abilities as well as a Grass neutrality to take Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Flower Trick. Toxapex and Quagsire take Fairy- and Electric-type attacks, respectively, while both wearing attackers down with Toxic. Toxapex also removes Toxic Spikes, which can put Urshifu-R on a timer. Gastrodon is an alternative Electric immunity, sacrificing physical bulk for a better specially defensive profile. Rotom-W does well in the Water mirror matchup, as well as doing good damage to Toxapex with Volt Switch. Additionally, it can create setup opportunities for Urshifu-R by burning physical attackers such as Dragonite and Great Tusk thanks to Will-O-Wisp. Barraskewda provides a good source of speed control as well as respectable power, while Basculegion-F is a good special attacker that can blow through common Urshifu-R checks such as physically defensive Toxapex and Quagsire. Both of these appreciate Urshifu-R breaking through their checks: Bulk Up Corviknight for Barraskewda and Gastrodon for Basculegion-F. Finally, Walking Wake can blow through defensive staples such as Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Amoonguss with Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteors. In exchange, Urshifu-R takes care of Hisuian Goodra.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Urshifu-R is a great wallbreaker on Fighting teams thanks to its deadly STAB combination, decent Speed tier, and access to Swords Dance, allowing it to be a good asset versus types like Poison, Water, and Fire. Close Combat is preferred due to its superior damage output; however, Drain Punch may be used instead for recovery and to ignore adverse contact effects thanks to Punching Glove. Aqua Jet threatens frailer revenge killers, taking out faster targets like Flutter Mane, Sandy Shocks, and Volcarona after a Swords Dance boost. Alternatively, Thunder Punch may be used to better deal with Azumarill, Pelipper, and Toxapex, while Zen Headbutt hits Amoonguss in addition to Toxapex and Clodsire. Surging Strikes notably deals with Landorus-T, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk as well as threatening Bulk Up Corviknight and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Other options include Ice Punch to hit Amoonguss while also threatening Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Dragapult and Taunt to prevent Toxapex, Quagsire, and Water Absorb Clodsire from using recovery moves as well as Toxic and Haze. Heavy-Duty Boots improves the matchup against hazard stacking teams like Poison; however, Punching Glove is preferred to use Surging Strikes freely without activating Rocky Helmet chip or Static, easing the Flying matchup and minimizing the need for predictions.</p> <p>Great Tusk is an amazing teammate, providing Stealth Rock to enhance Urshifu-R's wallbreaking abilities and removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin if Urshifu-R isn't using Heavy-Duty Boots. Furthermore, Great Tusk deals with Toxapex if Urshifu-R isn't using coverage to hit it. Iron Hands provides a buffer in the Flying, Water, and Fairy matchup, threatening Corviknight, Pelipper, and Basculegion-F as well as hitting Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Iron Valiant with Heavy Slam. Furthermore, Assault Vest Iron Hands acts as a great pivot into special attacks, as Urshifu-R's Special Defense is rather lackluster. In return, Urshifu-R deals with the Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads along with Skeledirge. Sneasler is great in the Fairy matchup and provides pivoting and Toxic Spikes to accentuate Urshifu-R's wallbreaking potential. Zamazenta appreciates Urshifu-R heavily wearing down teams to allow it to easily clean up late-game with Iron Defense. Iron Valiant removes threats such as Hisuian Lilligant, Meowscarada, and Greninja while also being a huge asset in the Flying matchup thanks to Thunderbolt. Iron Valiant also values Urshifu-R's ability to break Clodsire and lure in Toxapex.</p>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its excellent typing and Surging Strikes breaking through Focus Sash, Urshifu-R is among the premier physical attackers of the metagame!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Aqua Jet</strong>: Aqua Jet is perfect for picking off weakened foes that are faster than Urshifu-R, such as Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane, but this does come at the cost of coverage or a setup move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: With Swords Dance, Urshifu-R becomes far more difficult to wall, with Surging Strikes now 2HKOing even the bulkiest Cresselia.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch versus Ice Spinner</strong>: While Ice Spinner is more powerful when not using Punching Glove, Ice Punch is still preferred because it reveals less information about Urshifu-R's set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Punch</strong>: Thunder Punch is overpowered by Close Combat even against foes that are weak to it, but it can potentially 3HKO Dondozo when using Tera Electric and Punching Glove and is a safer option against opposing Urshifu-R than Close Combat. This is also Urshifu-R's most powerful attack against Azumarill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jolly versus Adamant</strong>: Jolly is preferred for outspeeding Mimikyu, a key target of Surging Strikes. Adamant can make sense if using Swords Dance and Aqua Jet together, having a better chance of sweeping late-game against fast threats that often run some bulk investment, such as Flutter Mane and Thundurus-T.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Drain Punch</strong>: While it offers no wallbreaking potential, Drain Punch is a good idea on bulkier sets with Punching Glove, letting Urshifu-R stick around much longer and potentially beat faster Urshifu-R that use Close Combat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulk Up</strong>: Bulk Up takes advantage of Urshifu-R's underrated physical bulk, though it will fail to easily wallbreak defensive foes like Cresselia as easily.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trailblaze</strong>: While difficult to fit in coverage-wise, Trailblaze's Speed boost can be a shocking win condition considering Urshifu-R's decent Speed, letting it outspeed even Dragapult and Iron Bundle!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Urshifu-R is able to function perfectly fine without Terastallization, though it has both offensive and defensive uses for it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: The Tera Water boost to Surging Strikes makes Urshifu-R even more difficult to wall, with even Ting-Lu that lack Sitrus Berry being OHKOed by +2 Surging Strikes. It also makes Aqua Jet a more effective cleaning move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: When paired with Thunder Punch, this is Urshifu-R's best shot of wearing down Dondozo, in addition to giving it a useful Electric-type resistance and paralysis immunity, making Zapdos and Thundurus-T far less reliable checks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a strong defensive option for Urshifu-R, letting it take on Fairy, Grass, Flying, and Psychic attacks that normally threaten to OHKO it. It also means Iron Bundle will no longer OHKO Urshifu-R with Freeze-Dry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison isn't quite as strong defensively as Tera Steel, but it does let Urshifu-R absorb Toxic Spikes and gives it a useful Fighting-type resistance instead of a weakness.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove versus Protective Pads</strong>: Both of these items protect Urshifu-R from taking devastating damage by hitting Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin with Surging Strikes. Punching Glove is a great option since it boosts the damage of Surging Strikes and other punching moves, but Protective Pads does let Close Combat and Aqua Jet bypass chip damage as well, and unlike Punching Glove, Protective Pads lets even punching moves ignore Protect from common foes like Garganacl and Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: While it might seem strange with Urshifu-R's good physical bulk, Focus Sash lets it survive extremely powerful physical moves such as Chien-Pao's Electric Tera Blast and Landorus-T's Flying Tera Blast and powerful special attackers such Flutter Mane and Thundurus-T.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>244 HP / 20 Atk / 156 Def / 36 SpD / 52 Spe with Impish</strong>: This bulky EV spread allows Urshifu-R to survive a wide variety of useful attacks, usually allowing to survive Jolly Life Orb Chien-Pao's super effective Tera Blast and allowing Tera Water or Tera Electric Urshifu-R to survive Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast. The Speed EVs outspeed Adamant Breloom, and the Attack EVs give Urshifu-R a high chance to OHKO Focus Sash Chien-Pao with Tera Water Surging Strikes.</li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Female Gender</strong>: While very rare, Urshifu-R is vulnerable to Enamorus's Cute Charm if making contact, so using a female gender has no drawbacks.</li> </ul>"

While Ice Spinner is more powerful, Ice Punch is preferred due to revealing less about Urshifu-R's set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Punch</strong>: If using Tera Electric, Thunder Punch deals good damage to Dondozo and is its best way of dealing big damage to Azumarill,</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Aqua Jet</strong>: Aqua Jet is a good way for Choice Band Urshifu-R to clean up weakened teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf versus Choice Band</strong>: Choice Scarf transforms Urshifu-R into an effective revenge killer, outspeeding important threats such as Chien-Pao and Dragapultand even Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle that lack Booster Energy. Choice Band, on the other hand, makes Urshifu-R a far more effective wallbreaker, letting it deal massive damage to foes like Dondozo and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Urshifu-R has both offensive and defensive uses for Terastallization, but it isn't vital for it to function.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Surging Strikes a healthy boost in power, letting Choice Scarf Urshifu-R OHKO Focus Sash Chien-Pao and Choice Band Urshifu-R 2HKO Cresselia.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Not only does Tera Electric make Thunder Punch a good option against Dondozo, it also gives Urshifu-R a vital immunity to paralysis and resistance against Electric and Flying attacks from Zapdos and Thundurus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting works fantastically with Choice Band, letting Close Combat 2HKO even the bulkiest Dondozo! It's also reasonable on Choice Scarf Urshifu-R for cleaning weakened teams more easily.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a great defensive option, letting Urshifu-R survive Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry and Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison doesn't cover as many of Urshifu-R's natural weaknesses as Tera Steel, but it still offers a vital Fairy-type resistance and makes Urshifu-R a decent absorber of Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Female Gender</strong>: Urshifu-R's gender is not vital for this set's function, but it does protect it from activating the very rare Cute Charm on Enamorus, making a female gender slightly better on Urshifu-R.</li> </ul>"

Power Whip is an excellent STAB move that allows Zarude to 2HKO Toxapex and Hatterene. Drain Punch grants Zarude a form of recovery while still 2HKOing Hisuian Goodra and Heatran, whereas Close Combat grants Zarude a stronger Fighting-type coverage. Alternatively, Jungle Healing allows Zarude access to longevity and removing its own status safely, as it forces many switches.</p> <p>Amoonguss is a great defensive partner for Zarude, as it is able to resist Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from Flutter Mane, Sneasler, and Iron Valiant, melt Toxic Spikes, and spread status for more offensive teammates with either Toxic or Spore. In return, Zarude can threaten the Psychic-types Amoonguss loses to, like Hatterene, Armarouge, and Iron Leaves. Choice Scarf Meowscarada makes for another good teammate, as it can outspeed and threaten Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Dragapult, and Hydreigon with Play Rough. In return, Zarude can handle the aforementioned Steel-types that Meowscarada struggles with, and the two of the form a strong U-turn core to complement their teammates. Hisuian Electrode and Rotom-C is a great addition on any Grass team, as thanks to its Speed tier and Electric typing, it can threaten slower Flying-types such as Corviknight and Enamorus as well as Water-types like Toxapex and Volcanion. Zarude's wallbreaking and support role enables sweepers like Hisuian Liligant to sweep Flying thanks to the latter's access to Ice Spinner as well as being able to clean Steel teams. Brambleghast and Toedscruel make for great teammates, as they can set up hazards to wear down incoming Pokemon for Zarude to break easier and remove them with Rapid Spin to enhance Zarude's pivoting ability. Toedscruel also has enough Special Defense to survive a Flamethrower from Choice Scarf Iron Moth and OHKO it back. On the other hand, Brambleghast's Ghost typing also allows it to spinblock, thus preserving hazards on the field, and thanks to its ability Wind Rider, it can switch into anticipated Flying-type attacks. Iron Leaves makes for another great partner, being able to provide Grass teams a positive matchup against Fighting and Poison teams.

Volt Switch lets Regieleki punish foes like Amoonguss, Galarian Slowking, and Hisuian Goodra, which can take advantage of it, allowing teammates like Zapdos and Iron Hands to exploit them instead. Rapid Spin leverages Regieleki's capability to force opponents to bring in a Ground-type or risk significant damage, providing Electric teams with much-needed entry hazard control. Thunder Wave mitigates the threat of Hisuian Lilligant, Spectrier, and Zamazenta if Regieleki is unable to finish these off. Heavy-Duty Boots enhances Regieleki's ability to pivot and consistently remove entry hazards. Alternatively, 28 Atk EVs in conjunction with a Naive nature could be considered, and Magnet is recommended when using Regieleki with Wild Charge to secure an OHKO against Flutter Mane. Magnet also enables Regieleki to reach specific damage thresholds, such as OHKOing Iron Valiant with Thunderbolt. A Timid or Naive nature with maximum Speed EVs is needed to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Hisuian Zoroark.</p> <p>Given that Ground-types like Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Quagsire shut down Regieleki's antics, teammates like Nasty Plot Rotom-W, Swords Dance Iron Hands, and Substitute Zapdos that capitalize on these are crucial for its success. It's important to keep in mind that the player using Regieleki can also choose to double out when anticipating a Ground-type switch-in, allowing teammates to threaten these walls. In return, Regieleki eliminates Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao, which threaten its allies. Magnezone can equip an Assault Vest to check Choice Scarf users like Flutter Mane and Greninja, which zoom past Regieleki, and it can wear down Landorus-T and Quagsire as they repeatedly switch in. Sandy Shocks provides entry hazards to further wear down the opposing team, is bulky enough to bear a hit from and deal with Choice Scarf Sneasler, and puts pressure on Quagsire and Glimmora. Pawmot handles fast Ground-types like Landorus, applies pressure on Flying and Water teams with its Ice- and Grass-type coverage, and grants Regieleki a second chance at sweeping through Revival Blessing. Thundurus-T and Rotom-C are also appreciated, as Thundurus-T provides colorful coverage to deal with Poison- and Ground-types like Amoonguss and Great Tusk, while Rotom-C is able to greatly threaten the entirety of Water teams with its STAB moves.</p>"

Tera Blast 2HKOes defensive Great Tusk and chips defensive Kommo-o and Zapdos, while Thunderbolt can be used to better pressure Corviknight and Ice-resistant foes such as Manaphy, Iron Moth, and Heatran attempting to switch in. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Regieleki ignore the entry hazards it removes, while Never-Melt Ice lets Extreme Speed OHKO Hisuian Electrode and specially defensive Garchomp and lets Tera Blast 2HKO defensive Zapdos. Wallbreakers such as Ceruledge and Ogerpon-H appreciate Regieleki being able to safely pivot them in on Pokemon they threaten such as Iron Moth and Heatran while also removing the entry hazards they're weak to; in return, they can threaten the bulky Pokemon that Regieleki struggles to break through such as Scream Tail, Hisuian Goodra, and Volt Absorb Empoleon. Additionally, Regieleki's ability to outspeed and threaten Choice Scarf Azelf is valuable, as Azelf can OHKO the aforementioned wallbreakers after Stealth Rock chip. Regieleki's poor bulk makes it an unreliable entry hazard remover on its own; therefore it's recommended to pair it with another hazard remover such as Great Tusk, Corviknight, or Mandibuzz, with the latter two forming a VoltTurn core with the momentum they generate from their pivoting moves. Physical pivots such as Barraskewda, Roaring Moon, and Meowscarada are also recommended teammates, as they also create a VoltTurn core, while Regieleki lures in special walls such as Heatran, Meloetta, and Manaphy that they can force out.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Spectrier is a deadly special attacker that is able to quickly snowball against teams thanks to its high Speed, outrinning some of the metagame's fastest threats like Greninja and Iron Valiant. Spectrier utilizes Draining Kiss to hit Dark-type Pokemon that would otherwise resist its STAB Shadow Ball like the aforementioned Greninja as well as non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Roaring Moon. Draining Kiss also serves as a secondary recovery option to help heal off the damage taken by setting up a Substitute. Nasty Plot is used to elevate Spectrier's Special Attack to incredible heights without having to KO foes beforehand. Spectrier shines best when it is able to set up a Substitute, and subsequently a Nasty Plot, in the face of a more passive foe like Toxapex, then begin spamming its scarcely resisted Shadow Ball + Draining Kiss combination. Leftovers is used to provide more substantial recovery than Draining Kiss, but Colbur Berry is an option to take a Dark-type attack from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Chien-Pao, and Barraskewda. Will-O-Wisp should be used instead of Substitute if Colbur Berry is the item of choice, as it allows Spectrier to capitalize on surviving an attack from these extremely potent physical threats. If Will-O-Wisp is preferred over Substitute, Hex can also be used to deal more damage to burned threats.</p> <p>Skeledirge can switch into strong physical attacks from Pokemon that threaten Spectrier such as Choice Scarf Gallade, Scizor, Ceruledge, and Mimikyu lacking Shadow Claw, then scare them with Will-O-Wisp. Mimikyu is also a great teammate, as it can help Spectrier deal with Pokemon that may not go down to a single Draining Kiss, such as Ting-Lu, as well as Kingambit and Chien-Pao if Disguise is in tact. Mimikyu is also able to finish off threats such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult with Shadow Sneak. Froslass and Brambleghast are teammates that work well with Spectrier, setting up Spikes for Spectrier to nab easier KOs and snowball with Grim Neigh. Froslass is also able to use Thunder Wave to slow down faster Pokemon, while Brambleghast is able to remove entry hazards via Rapid Spin, allowing Spectrier to pivot more freely. Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is a great teammate thanks to its incredible Speed and ablility to deal with common Choice Scarf users that give Spectrier trouble such as Gholdengo, Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk. STAB Moonblast can also damage or remove Dark-type Pokemon to make Spectrier's job easier. Finally, Hisuian Zoroark is a solid teammate due to its ability to switch into Ghost-type attacks that would otherwise threaten Spectrier and all of its other teammates. Hisuian Zoroark can also apply utility support by wearing down opposing teams with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off. Dragapult is a great teammate, as it can burn and force damage on common walls like Quagsire, Clodsire, Alolan Muk and Ting-Lu, and forcing damage on them to make sweeping easier. It is also important to note that burned Quagsire and Clodsire cannot break Spectrier's Substitute in one hit, making setting up a lot easier. Finally, bulky Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a great teammate for Spectrier. Gholdengo can wear down Dark- and Poison-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Clodsire, which Spectrier struggle with, while Spectrier can help with faster threats like Dragon- and Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Hydreigon and Great Tusk.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Spectrier is an exceptional setup sweeper on Ghost teams due to its great Speed tier, incredible ability, and access to various utility options, allowing it to snowball through Poison, Ground, and Flying teams. Spectrier's combination of Calm Mind and Will-O-Wisp is notably important, as it allows Spectrier to be an annoyance to both physical and special attackers. Hex in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp deals immense damage versus threats like Corviknight, Toxapex, and Hisuian Goodra as well as takes advantage of Pokemon reliant on status ailments to function such as Poison Heal Gliscor and Guts Heracross. Substitute protects Spectrier from status ailments inflicted by passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Quagsire. Furthermore, Substitute provides more opportunities to set up Calm Mind boosts and denies the opponent of a chance to revenge kill Spectrier. The given EV spread allows Spectrier to outpace non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada, prevents Spectrier's Substitute from being broken by burned Assault Vest Iron Hands, and prevents Spectrier from being OHKOed by a burned Supreme Overlord Kingambit using Kowtwo Kleave with five fainted allies.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is incredibly valued as a teammate due to its ability to threaten Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Greninja, Baxcalibur, Galarian Moltres, and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon as well as faster Ghost-types such as Swift Swim Basculegion, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. In return, Spectrier threatens special walls like Hisuian Goodra, Clodsire, and Gliscor. Focus Sash Ceruledge threatens special walls like Articuno and Heatran as well as takes on faster Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult with Shadow Sneak, appreciating Spectrier's ability to burn walls. Air Balloon Gholdengo is a great asset in the Fairy and Ice matchups, beating Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Baxcalibur, and Alolan Ninetales as well as Ursaluna-B and Empoleon. Hex Dragapult spreads even more status ailments to set up Spectrier for success late-game and threatens Kommo-o, Hydreigon, and Baxcalibur. Additionally, Choice Band Dragapult 2HKOes Alolan Muk with Dragon Darts, threatens opposing Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo with Sucker Punch, and OHKOes Hoopa-U with U-turn, also offering pivoting. Choice Scarf Dragapult also provides U-turn and can outpace Choice Scarf users like Roaring Moon and Walking Wake. Brambleghast and Froslass wear down defensive switch-ins such as Heatran, Ting-Lu, and Alolan Muk with Spikes, while Brambleghast also removes Toxic Spikes using Rapid Spin. Hisuian Zoroark offers a Ghost-type immunity and can spread burn with Will-O-Wisp, easing Spectrier's time setting up. Skeledirge checks Ogerpon-H, Choice Scarf Infernape, and Heatran using Earth Power and takes on setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Frosmoth while also outpacing Kingambit. Mimikyu checks Dark-types like Hoopa-U, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and Hydreigon while also offering a one-time check to Chien-Pao, Greninja, and Kingambit due to Disguise. Sinistcha beats Water-types like Barraskewda and Urshifu-R as well as Ground-types such as Ursaluna-B and Landorus. Gengar offers Toxic Spikes to accumulate chip damage via Spectrier's Substitute and enhance the power of Hex.</p>"

Tera Blast is a more niche option for the fourth moveslot that OHKOes Pokemon like Arceus and Wo-Chien at +2 with Tera Fighting. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Calyrex-S repeatedly switch in and fire off attacks, likely allowing it to outlast its checks. At +2, Tera Grass-boosted Grass Knot OHKOes Arceus after slight chip damage and OHKOes Ting-Lu; Tera Grass also allows Calyrex-S to take attacks like Arceus's Shadow Claw, Ting-Lu's Payback, and Arceus-Ground's Earthquake. Tera Ghost lets Astral Barrage achieve feats such as OHKOing Koraidon with a layer of Spikes, OHKOing Zacian-C after Rocky Helmet damage from a teammate, OHKOing defensive Arceus formes at +2, and 3HKOing Terastallized Ting-Lu. All Koraidon sets threaten Ting-Lu and Arceus, the primary switch-ins to Calyrex-S, and Choice Scarf Koraidon can use U-turn to safely pivot Calyrex-S in against Pokemon like Skeledirge, while Scale Shot Koraidon appreciates Encore Calyrex-S taking advantage of Arceus aiming to revenge kill it with Extreme Speed. Calyrex-S pairs well with checks to Arceus and Choice Scarf Koraidon, such as Landorus-T, Toxapex, and Skeledirge. It also appreciates Ting-Lu checking other Choice Scarf users such as Miraidon and opposing Calyrex-S; moreover, Ting-Lu, like Landorus-T, can trade entry hazards with opposing Ting-Lu that switch into Calyrex-S. Calyrex-S, Miraidon, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground can weaken Ting-Lu for each other, potentially enabling one of them to sweep.</p>"

Trick cripples Calyrex-S's common switch-ins, Ting-Lu and Arceus, and forces Arceus to lock into Shadow Claw. Grass Knot offers good neutral coverage and the ability to hit the omnipresent Ting-Lu. Psyshock is preferred over Psychic because it hits Calm Mind Arceus formes harder, whereas Psychic always 2HKOes Arceus. Tera Ghost boosts Astral Barrage's damage to horrific levels, making it capable of OHKOing defensive Arceus formes after minor chip damage, and the lessened Ghost- and Dark-type weaknesses let Calyrex-S live Arceus's Shadow Claw and Arceus-Dark's Foul Play. Tera Grass instead boosts Grass Knot to be on par with Astral Barrage; it easily 2HKOes Arceus and Arceus-Dark and OHKOes Ting-Lu with two layers of Spikes. Calyrex-S's self sufficiency as a wallbreaker and tendency to overwhelm its checks make it very easy to fit on a variety of teams. Offensive teams appreciate its massive power and the utility provided from it outspeeding and OHKOing most offensive threats and can provide it ample opportunities with U-turn from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Koraidon. Balance teams appreciate its self-sufficient nature while providing it with refuge from revenge killers, like Choice Scarf Koraidon and Giratina-O, with Pokemon like Toxapex and defensive Arceus formes. Koraidon is a great partner that threatens Ting-Lu and Arceus—which would otherwise deter Calyrex-S from using Astral Barrage—and can use U-turn to safely pivot Calyrex-S in against its own counters that Calyrex-S terrifies, like Skeledirge and Toxapex.

Grass Knot deals significant damage to Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground. Psychic allows Calyrex-S to OHKO Koraidon, unlike Psyshock, while also helping out with Extreme Killer Arceus. Trick is used to cripple switch-ins such as Ting-Lu and Extreme Killer Arceus, providing utility especially in matchups where Speed is less important. Tera Ghost boosts the power of Astral Barrage, allowing Calyrex-S to OHKO Zacian-C after some chip damage and 2HKO defensive Arceus formes, and it lets Calyrex-S survive Shadow Claw from Extreme Killer Arceus and Payback from Ting-Lu due to the reduced weaknesses. Tera Grass is an alternative option to 2HKO Ting-Lu with Grass Knot. Calyrex-S appreciates offensive teammates such as Koraidon, Zacian-C, and Extreme Killer Arceus, which can threaten its checks such as Ting-Lu, opposing Arceus, and Arceus-Dark; in return, it threatens their checks such as Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Landorus-T. Miraidon and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground are also excellent teammates for Calyrex-S, as all three weaken each other's checks, potentially leading to one of them cleaning up late-game.

Encore is an alternative to take advantage of Arceus by locking it into Extreme Speed and setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Arceus formes. Grass Knot primarily pressures Ting-Lu and Arceus formes. Psyshock is an alternative to Psychic that's stronger against Eternatus and Calm Mind Arceus formes. Tera Grass makes Calyrex-S's Grass Knot much more spammable, letting it 2HKO Arceus formes and more easily break past Ting-Lu, lose a weakness to Shadow Claw from Arceus and Payback from Ting-Lu, and resist Ground-type coverage from Arceus-Ground and Ting-Lu. Calyrex-S is a superb wallbreaker, so partners such as Miraidon and Calm Mind Arceus formes appreciate it forcing progress against special walls in Ting-Lu and Arceus. Calyrex-S can be pressured by a surprise Terastallization from Pokemon such as Giratina-O and Arceus, so having a solid defensive core with Arceus formes and Landorus-T or Toxapex is appreciated to check them. Calyrex-S is also forced out by Choice Scarf users such as Koraidon, Miraidon, Kyogre, and other Calyrex-S, so having checks to them such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, Eternatus, and Arceus, respectively, are appreciated. Entry hazard support from the aforementioned Pokemon and Glimmora also makes it easier for Calyrex-S to break through defensive structures. Hyper offense leads such as Grimmsnarl and Ribombee can support Calyrex-S by making it harder to revenge kill.

Thanks to a Jolly nature and Choice Scarf, it's able to outspeed foes such as Flutter Mane, Chien Pao, and Dragapult and deal heavy damage. Sharpness-boosted Stone Axe smashes common Flying- and Fire- types, such as Enamorus, Skeledirge, and Cinderace, while also setting up Stealth Rock in the same turn. Night Slash punishes Gholdengo, which resists all of Kleavor's other moves, though be wary that Kleavor can only 2HKO it even with Stealth Rock up. Aerial Ace is also an option to hit Great Tusk if it tries to switch in and remove entry hazards set by Kleavor. U-turn picks up momentum for the team and switches Kleavor out against foes such as Landorus-T, Iron Hands, and Azumarill. X-Scissor can be used to deal much more damage than U-turn thanks to being boosted by Sharpness, 2HKOing Amoonguss and Sableye. Close Combat helps Kleavor deal with Steel-types such as Kingambit and Heatran, though the latter requires chip damage to OHKO.</p> <p>All of Kleavor's teammates enjoy its ability to set up Stealth Rock while also dealing damage in the same turn. Volcarona and Frosmoth appreciate Kleavor's entry hazard support wearing down the opposing team and its ability to deal with Flying- and Fire-types, which enable them to set up and sweep late-game. In return, Volcarona can deal with Steel-types such as Corviknight and Gholdengo, while Frosmoth can deal with Ground- and Water-types such as Landorus-Th and Quagsire. Frosmoth is also a wincon against Flying- and Dragon-types when Stealth Rock is set up. Scizor acts as a sweeper that takes advantage of Kleavor weakening opposing teams, and it also forms a U-turn core that appreciates Kleavor's Fire neutrality with it. Additionally, Scizor can block Toxic from Clodsire and Mortal Spin from Glimmora, and threaten them with either Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch or setting up with Swords Dance. Lokix, Heracross, and Slither Wing also appreciate the opposing team being weakened by Kleavor, as well as the speed control Kleavor provides. This enables them to finish off foes by making use of priority moves and strong physical attacks, such as Lokix taking out Gholdengo with Sucker Punch or Throat Chop. Forretress provides great hazard control thanks to Rapid Spin, and it's also able to switch into strong physical attacks to scout thanks to its high physical defense and additional Steel typing that grants valuable neutralities that cover Kleavor's weaknesses. Forretress also makes a good pivot thanks to its slow speed and access to Volt Switch.</p>"

Close Combat synergizes well with Kleavor's STAB moves, crushing Steel-types like Iron Treads. U-turn allows Kleavor to pivot out of Great Tusk and Skarmory to bring in teammates like Araquanid or Volcarona. Night Slash banishes Ghost-types like Gholdengo, Knock Off softens walls like Corviknight and Porygon2 for its teammates, and X-Scissor takes down Slowbro to make way for Mega Pinsir. Araquanid and Galvantula are excellent teammates, as these set up Sticky Web to patch up Kleavor's unassuming speed, even when using a Choice Scarf, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Blacephalon. Additionally, they also help in dealing with pesky Fire- and Flying-types like Volcarona and Landorus, respectively. Physical setup sweepers benefit from Kleavor's ability to set hazards offensively, Knock Off items from walls, and deal with Skeledirge and Slowbro, which often wall Mega Pinsir, Scizor, and Mega Scizor. In return, they deal with Fighting- and Fairy-types like Great Tusk and Mega Diancie. Quiver Dance Volcarona appreciates Skeledirge removed, as this lets it clean up Ghost teams at +1; it can also be brought in against passive walls like Slowbro and Skarmory. Forretress provides Rapid Spin and loves Kleavor's ability to set Stealth Rock, as this allows it to run other hazards like Toxic Spikes or Volt Switch to better support the team. Lokix provides great offensive support with its access to priority in First Impression and Sucker Punch to finish off teams weakened by Kleavor through entry hazards and repeated Knock Offs. It is also a secondary check to Skeledirge, which Bug teams appreciate.</p>"

Headlong Rush is generally preferred for its higher power, but Earthquake is another good option that avoids Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet damage and lets Ursaluna leverage its good bulk. Fire Punch hits Corviknight, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Air Balloon Kingambit, which resist Ursaluna's STAB combination. Tera Normal boosts Facade to breathtaking levels, allowing it to cleanly 2HKO physically defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock. Tera Ghost is an alternative that lets Ursaluna avoid being revenge killed by Fighting-type attacks such as Close Combat from Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, or Sneasler. The given EV spread maximizes Ursaluna's damage output while also ensuring it outspeeds Skeledirge and standard Corviknight. On Trick Room teams, Ursaluna should run maximum Attack and HP investment, a Brave nature, and 0 Speed IVs.</p> <p>Ursaluna serves as an exceptionally powerful wallbreaker on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Garchomp is appreciated to make Ursaluna even more difficult to wall. Dual screens support from Dragapult can also be considered, since it will further reinforce Ursaluna's excellent bulk, and Dragapult can even provide free switches through Curse or U-turn. Against slower-paced teams, Ursaluna's great bulk and immunity to status give it many opportunities to switch in and start wreaking havoc, but it can struggle against faster-paced, more aggressive teams. Good partners for Ursaluna that excel against offense include Kingambit, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Zamazenta, which, in return, appreciate Ursaluna breaking through Pokemon such as Dondozo and Corviknight. Ursaluna enjoys U-turn or Volt Switch support from Rotom-W, Landorus-T, or Dragapult, letting it hit the field multiple times to fire off its insanely powerful attacks. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate for Ursaluna, as it can both provide momentum with Chilly Reception and supplement Ursaluna's firepower with Future Sight. Galarian Slowking can also switch into and pressure some of the Pokemon that give Ursaluna trouble, such as Iron Valiant. Trick Room support from Hatterene and Cresselia is an interesting option to turn Ursaluna's low Speed into an advantage.</p>"

After Flame Orb activates, Facade 2HKOes the bulkiest Pokemon in the metagame such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Amoonguss. Because of Flame Orb, Ursaluna can also function as a great status absorber. Earthquake is preferred over Headlong Rush, because it allows Ursaluna to maintain its remarkable bulk as well as having the added benefit of avoiding Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin damage. Swords Dance can be used to bolster Ursaluna's Attack to incredible heights, giving everything a tough time switching in. Drain Punch can be used to give Ursaluna more longevity, while Fire Punch can be used to hit targets like Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo for super effective damage. Alternatively, Ursaluna can run 140 Speed EVs in order to keep up with other pokemon in its Speed tier, such as Kingambit, and outspeeding slightly faster Pokemon that do not run any Speed investment such as Corviknight and Skeledirge. Max HP is used to maximize Ursaluna's bulk, while the 4 Speed EVs are used to outspeed any uninvested Pokemon of the same Speed tier, such as Iron Hands and Alolan Muk.</p> <p>Ursaluna greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Ting-Lu and Quagsire, as the extra damage could be the difference between a 2HKO and a 1HKO on physically defensive Rotom-W. Ursaluna also appreciates a teammate like Clodsire, which can switch into Water- and Fighting-type attacks from Urshifu-R, Azumarill, and Sneasler, both of which Ursaluna is weak to. Another great teammate for Ursaluna is Landorus-T, which can U-turn and allow Ursaluna to come in freely and launch its extremely powerful attacks. Alternatively, Landorus-I is a fantastic teammate for Ursaluna. Ursaluna is able to deal with the special walls that check Landorus and vice versa. Iron Treads is another great teammate for Ursaluna, as it keeps hazards off the field in order to prevent Ursaluna from taking more damage. Bulkier Pokemon that want to stick around for a long time, such as Ting-Lu, Quagsire, and Clodsire, greatly appreciate Ursaluna's presence, as it can freely switch in to status moves and Knock Off once Flame Orb has activated. Finally, Choice Scarf Great Tusk is another teammate that appreciates Ursaluna. Great Tusk is able to outspeed and OHKO Pokemon that check Ursaluna such as Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Choice Specs Greninja.

          "description": "<p>Ursaluna possesses an absurd level of wallbreaking power between Guts, STAB Facade, and a massive 140 base Attack. Facade coupled with a Ground-type STAB move and Fire Punch as coverage allows Ursaluna to break most defensive cores featuring Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Gliscor, Rotom-W, and Toxapex. Headlong Rush is preferred for immediate power, capable of guaranteeing an OHKO on Garganacl to prevent it from afflicting Ursaluna with Salt Cure. Earthquake is an alternative, as not dropping defenses allow Ursaluna to stay in and trade more efficiently with faster threats such as Tapu Lele and Ogerpon-W, which suits teams that have means to heal Ursaluna via Wish from Alomomola or Lunar Dance from Cresselia. Fire Punch is the optimal coverage move to hit Steel-types that are neutral or immune to Ground-type moves, such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory. Tera Normal cranks up Ursaluna's wallbreaking power to the maximum, now able to OHKO nearly anything at +2; even the bulkiest resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory are KOed once slightly chipped. 164 Speed EVs are used to outrun uninvested Skarmory, but 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD with 0 Speed IVs accompanied by a Brave nature should be used on Trick Room teams. On that note, Ursaluna pairs well with Trick Room setters like Cresselia and Hatterene, as they can alleviate its low Speed as well as potentially provide Lunar Dance and Healing Wish. Unfortunately, outside of Trick Room, Ursaluna is held back by its poor Speed and defensive typing, which, despite its respectable defenses, leaves it unable to switch into many moves and vulnerable to faster offensive foes like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, especially after it has taken chip damage. It is also prone to having its Flame Orb removed via Knock Off before it can activate, dampening its power significantly. Thus, teammates that can bring Ursaluna in safely, like Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Alomomola, to keep it as healthy as possible are greatly appreciated. Alomomola also has the added benefit of passing Wishes to Ursaluna. In addition, entry hazard setters like Landorus-T and Heatran are good allies, as hazards can further pressure the switches forced by Ursaluna.</p>"

Braviary is a bulkier partner that uses its Fighting neutrality to switch into opposing Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Quaquaval. Braviary also offers entry hazard removal with Defog to assist in Ursaluna-B's longevity and a slow U-turn to get it in safely. Cyclizar can also provide hazard removal with Rapid Spin, getting rid of Toxic Spikes, which hinder Ursaluna-B's ability to clean late-game. Furthermore, Cyclizar can use Shed Tail on passive Pokemon like Quagsire to bring in Ursaluna-B safely, allowing it to use Calm Mind freely once. Snorlax's physical wallbreaking ability is also appreciated to chip down specially defensive Pokemon like Articuno. Thick Fat also gives it a pseudo-Ice resistance in order to check Pokemon like Frosmoth, which Ursaluna-B struggles against, and it also checks other threatening special attackers like Greninja and Flutter Mane. Choice Scarf Ditto is able to copy setup sweepers that attempt to force out Ursaluna-B like Swords Dance Ogerpon-W and Chien-Pao and can threaten a reverse sweep. Blissey is a defensive partner that checks most special attackers that threaten Ursaluna-B such as Choice Specs Greninja and Galarian Moltres. Blissey also provides hazard support in Stealth Rock, which gives Ursaluna-B an easier time wallbreaking and winning one-on-one against Ogerpon-H by guaranteeing the OHKO with Blood Moon, as well as cripple incoming switch-ins with Thunder Wave. Indeedee provides support to Ursaluna-B with Healing Wish to improve its longevity if it has been badly poisoned or chipped to low HP. Indeedee's Psychic STAB also threatens opposing Fighting-types like Iron Valiant, Zamazenta and Iron Hands. Arboliva can switch into Water-type moves from foes such as Ogerpon-W, Dondozo, and Barraskewda while setting Grassy Terrain to improve Ursaluna-B's longevity.</p>"

        "Wallbreaker (Ground)": {
          "description": "<p>Boasting a great Special Attack stat, substantial physical bulk, and access to recovery, Ursaluna-B is a premier wallbreaker on Ground teams, offering major support in the Dark, Ghost, and Dragon matchups. Blood Moon paired with Mind's Eye allows Ursaluna-B to OHKO Ghost-type threats like Brambleghast, Dragapult, and Spectrier while also doing considerable damage to walls such as Rotom-W, Gliscor, and Gastrodon. Earth Power nails Steel-types such as Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, and Empoleon, forming a nearly unresisted combination of coverage with Blood Moon. Vacuum Wave prevents Ursaluna-B from being revenge killed by faster Ice-type threats, OHKOing Alolan Sandslash and having a chance to OHKO Chien-Pao. Wise Glasses may be used instead of Heavy-Duty Boots to secure an OHKO on Chien-Pao as well as make it easier to clean up weakened Meowscarada, Greninja, and Darkrai. However, Ursaluna-B is often pivoted in due to its bulk, putting it at risk for chip damage if not running Heavy-Duty Boots. The given EV spread allows Ursaluna-B to outpace uninvested Hisuian Goodra, Clefable, and Empoleon while maximizing power and bulk.</p> <p>Gliscor is an excellent teammate due to its resistance to Fighting, switching into Great Tusk, Infernape, and Sneasler for Ursaluna-B. Furthermore, Ursaluna-B recieves a plethora of utility support from Gliscor via Toxic, Spikes, and pivoting with U-turn, enhancing Ursaluna-B as a wallbreaker. In return, Ursaluna-B picks off Chien-Pao and swaps into Ghost-type moves from Hisuian Zoroark, Skeledirge, and Spectrier. Furthermore, Ursaluna-B can sponge Ice Spinner from Great Tusk and Iron Treads using Gliscor's Protect to scout them. Iron Treads is appreciated due to its entry hazard removing ability and Steel typing, warding off Ice- and Fairy-types, such as Alolan Ninetales, Flutter Mane, and Frosmoth, as well as switching into Toxic. In return, Ursaluna-B breaks past Ground-types like Gliscor, defensive Great Tusk, and Quagsire. Clodsire and Gastrodon offer an immunity to Water-type attacks from Barraskewda, Greninja, and Walking Wake while also setting up a mix of entry hazards to wear down teams for Ursaluna-B. Additionally, Clodsire is a very bulky specially defensive wall, capable of fighting off Grass- and Fairy-types such as Meowscarada, Iron Valiant, Sinistcha, and Alolan Ninetales, while Ursaluna-B threatens Sableye and Hatterene for Clodsire. Choice Scarf Great Tusk outpaces and removes threats like Baxcalibur, Mamoswine, and Ogerpon-W. Great Tusk, in return, appreciates the removal or weakening of Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Gliscor. Choice Scarf Landorus provides a Fighting-type resistance and an adequate Speed tier threatening Great Tusk and Zamazenta while also removing Dragon Dance Baxcalibur lacking Ice Shard. Mamoswine is heavily valued due to its ability Thick Fat, allowing it to combat Alolan Ninetales, Articuno, and non-Choice Band Chien-Pao as well as Grass-types like Meowscarada and Hisuian Lilligant using Ice Shard. In return, Ursaluna-B threatens Rotom-W and Skeledirge. Garchomp is a valued wallbreaker due to its ability to take out Kommo-o, Ogerpon-W, and Baxcalibur lacking Ice Shard while appreciating Ursaluna-B removing physically defensive walls. Quagsire provides chip damage buildup with Stealth Rock and Toxic as well as checks threats such as Chien-Pao, Zamazenta, and Azumarill. Sandy Shocks is a great asset in the Water and Flying matchups, threatening Urshifu-R, Corviknight, Basculegion-F, and Pelipper as well as stacking entry hazards for Ursaluna-B's wallbreaking.</p>"

Choice Band is the preferred item for more power so long as it has pivots to fall back on, such as Pelipper, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos. Tera Water is the premier Tera option to pump as much power into Wave Crash as possible, allowing it to 2HKO even Water-resistant foes such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn. Tera Water also removes its weakness to Sucker Punch from the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Mega Mawile, and it maintains its resistance to Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, although it removes its immunity to Fake Out from Mega Medicham. This also leaves Basculegion-M susceptible to Wave Crash's heavy recoil damage, so Liquidation is used to mitigate this, and it should be used once Basculegion-M’s checks have been worn down in order to ensure that it does not KO itself with recoil. Basculegion-M thus benefits from an offensive partner like Mega Swampert, which can finish off threats weakened by Basculegion-M. Pelipper is necessary to set up rain for Basculegion-M and also serves as a pivot to give it a free switch, something Basculegion-M has trouble doing, as it prefers to preserve its HP for recoil. Other pivots like Eject Button Ferrothorn and Tornadus-T are also helpful to support Basculegion-M by giving a point of entry to start breaking.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Basculegion-F finds itself a useful niche on rain teams, that being one of few special rain exploiters in the tier. Its access to Swift Swim as well as strong STAB options in Surf and Shadow Ball allows it to be immensely threatening once it's brought in, and its ability to hit hard on the special side allows it to pick up 2HKOs on many common Water resistances in the tier such as Rotom-W or Toxapex. Swift Swim is a fantastic ability for Basculegion-F, as it allows the capability to run a Modest nature over Timid, boosting Basculegion-F's breaking capabilities even further. A Speed-boosting nature is unnecessary due to hitting a whopping 510 Speed in rain, outrunning almost every Pokemon in the tier except for Choice Scarf Kartana and Iron Valiant in Electric Terrain. Surf is a great option as a reliable STAB move, because its above-average Base Power and perfect accuracy allow it to be spammed with little to no drawback, while Hydro Pump is a great option for the raw power, 2HKOing Tera Grass Heatran with minimal chip damage and OHKOing Mega Charizard Y in sun. Both of these moves are perfectly complemented by Basculegion-F's secondary STAB option, Shadow Ball, which provides neutral coverage against a majority of the metagame. Very few Pokemon can resist Basculegion-F's STAB combination, which is even further bolstered by Ice Beam as a coverage option. Ice Beam allows Basculegion-F to deal serious damage to Pokemon like Tera Grass Heatran and Dragonite. Basculegion-F is also a phenomenal Terastallization user, as it's able to use Tera Water to both shed its weakness to Kingambit's Sucker Punch and boost Surf to terrifying levels of power, making it capable of sweeping most teams with little to no chip damage. Basculegion-F pairs extremely well with Pelipper, since it's able to set rain and use U-turn to bring Basculegion-F in safely. It also appreciates support from the likes of Ferrothorn and Zapdos, as Ferrothorn can answer Iron Valiant's Moonblast and spread chip damage very effectively with Iron Barbs, and Zapdos can check Choice Scarf Kartana and Rillaboom defensively and threaten crippling paralyses. In turn, Basculegion-F supports them back by KOing Pokemon that'd normally be able to force them out or pivot around utilizing resistances and immunities. For example, it can bait Leaf Blade from Kartana to guarantee a safe switch into Zapdos or it can lure Grassy Glide from Rillaboom, allowing Ferrothorn to come in and start spreading chip damage.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Sneasler is a deadly sweeper with its high Attack stat in conjunction with Swords Dance and Unburden. Dire Claw is generally preferred over Gunk Shot for its perfect accuracy and a high chance to cripple the target with status. However, Gunk Shot has considerably more power, allowing Sneasler to OHKO most Zapdos at +2. Acrobatics is Sneasler's most spammable attack, especially if it has Terastallized, as it hits many neutral targets such as Tornadus, Dragapult, and Toxapex for high damage. Sneasler should be brought out when the Terrain matching its item is active, consuming its item and boosting Acrobatics. An Electric Seed or Psychic Seed is recommended to instantly activate Unburden, and the boost to Sneasler's otherwise poor defenses may also facilitate setup. Tera Flying turns Sneasler's Ground weakness into an immunity, which often buys it a turn to set up. Tera Flying also grants STAB on Acrobatics, allowing Sneasler to OHKO Dragapult and physically defensive Great Tusk with Acrobatics after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Sneasler serves as an excellent late-game cleaner on hyper offense teams. Entry hazard setters such as Mega Diancie or Landorus-T are useful teammates to help wear down Snealser's checks, such as Toxapex and opposing Landorus-T, into KO range for its attacks. Given Sneasler's item, a Terrain-setting partner such as Tapu Koko or Tapu Lele is mandatory. Tapu Koko provides entry opporunities with Volt Switch and U-turn while also setting Reflect and Light Screen, which facilitates setup. Tapu Lele pressures Toxapex, and its Psychic Terrain blocks priority attacks such as Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, Fake Out from Mega Lopunny, and Sucker Punch from Kingambit, all of which can otherwise pick off a weakened Sneasler. However, one should be aware that Psychic Terrain will no longer block priority moves against a Tera Flying Snealser that has Terastallized. Other offensive partners that synergize well with Sneasler include Kingambit, Dragonite, and Volcarona, all of which can either assist in breaking through Sneasler's checks, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, or Toxapex, or finish off a team weakened by Sneasler.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Sneasler can use its combination of high Attack and Speed to function as a potent pivot, racking up chip damage against defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Zapdos, Great Tusk, and other tanks. Its ability, Poison Touch, alongside Dire Claw allows it to spread status and cripple its checks, mainly to enable Hex Dragapult and hit would-be checks like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Clefable for massive damage. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Sneasler to ignore Stealth Rock and Spikes to continue switching in and retain its offensive presence throughout the game. However, Sneasler is also hindered by contact punishment from the likes of Ferrothorn, defensive Landorus-T and Garchomp, and Zapdos, so Protective Pads helps provide more longevity. U-turn allows Sneasler to function as a pivot, bringing in other offensive threats such as Dragapult along with other special attackers like Tapu Lele to take advantage of physical tanks that can wall Sneasler such as Toxapex, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. U-turn also allows it to easily spread poison with Poison Touch. Fake Out allows Sneasler to safely chip and poison faster threats like offensive Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf users such as Urshifu-R or Landorus-T, along with powerful priority users like Extreme Killer Dragonite. As such, Sneasler benefits from having a sturdy defensive backbone with Pokemon like Toxapex or Ferrothorn to tank hits that Sneasler dislikes. Sneasler also forces a lot of switches, so it benefits from allies that can set hazards like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, or Heatran, which also switch in on Flying- and Psychic-type moves for Sneasler. Sneasler also has a tendency to be completely walled by the likes of Toxapex, Gliscor, and Landorus-T and benefits greatly from having allies that it can pivot to in order to exploit these checks for damage, like Tapu Lele or Zapdos.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Sneasler is one of the best cleaners for Poison teams thanks to its powerful STAB moves, like Dire Claw and Close Combat, along with U-turn, which allows Poison teams to preserve momentum while threatening poison with Poison Touch. Choice Scarf allows Sneasler to outspeed Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Regieleki, and opposing Choice Scarf threats like Hisuian Samurott, Enamorus, Iron Treads, Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon and Cinderace. Dire Claw paired with Sneasler's ability Poison Touch gives it a 41.67% chance to inflict poison upon foes, which helps to gradually wear down walls like Ting-Lu and Quagsire, along with a 23.33% chance to inflict paralysis or sleep, disrupting the threat that opposing sweepers pose to the team. While Steel-types are immune to Sneasler's Dire Claw, it can still threaten some of them such as Heatran and Iron Treads with Close Combat. Paired with Switcheroo, it is able to deny opposing walls like Toxapex and Corviknight recovery by passing them the Choice Scarf and forcing them to lock into one move. With the threat of Switcheroo, it also reduces the threat of Pokemon like Dragon Dance Dragonite.</p> <p>Sneasler pairs well with Amoonguss, which threatens to use Spore against foes and threatens walls like Quagsire and Gastrodon with Giga Drain, along with offensive Pokemon like Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Although Amoonguss can act as a switch-in to Landorus-T, it gets completely countered by its Substitute + Bulk Up set. In addition to that, Amoonguss can use Foul Play to dissuade Ghost-type wallbreakers like Dragapult and Mimikyu from setting up with Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, respectively. Galarian Slowking also synergizes incredibly well with Sneasler, as they form a pivoting core with U-turn and Chilly Reception. Galarian Slowking appreciates Sneasler breaking through Steel-types and spreading status, and Galarian Slowking can support Sneasler by threatening opposing Poison-types with Future Sight, switching in on Gholdengo and threatening it with Flamethrower, and tanking one Earth Power from Landorus and OHKOing it with Ice Beam if Galarian Slowking is running Assault Vest. Toxapex can set up Toxic Spikes for Sneasler to clean easily while the opposing team takes residual damage. It also forms a Regenerator core with Amoonguss and Galarian Slowking and aids Alolan Muk against setup with Haze, thus synergizing well with the momentum provided by Sneasler's U-turn. Alolan Muk is also a great partner for Sneasler, as it provides an immunity to Psychic-type attacks and boasts great special bulk, which allows it to tank attacks from Choice Specs Dragapult and Spectrier and threaten them with Knock Off. Glimmora can set Stealth Rock to support Sneasler's cleaning capability and spin away entry hazards to prevent Sneasler from being worn down, as well as threatening slow Great Tusk with Energy Ball and being a Ground-immune Pokemon that Sneasler can pivot into with Air Balloon. Iron Moth and Salazzle greatly benefit from Choice Scarf Sneasler beating threats like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao, allowing them to take out foes like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Klefki, which Sneasler can't break. Salazzle and Glimmora also form a Corrosion core, which helps in the Poison mirror matchup, which Sneasler struggles with. Clodsire is a great teammate to absorb attacks from Iron Valiant, Greninja, and Skeledirge.</p>"

        "Boots Pivots (Poison)": {
          "description": "<p>Sneasler fills a very unique role on Poison teams, as it's the best offensive pivot the type has access to thanks to an incredible base 130 Attack and 120 Speed stats. U-turn combined with Heavy-Duty Boots will allow it to stay safe throughout the entire game by switching out against an opposing threat to bring that can deal with it; in addition, U-turn comes with a 30% chance to poison thanks to Poison Touch ,which helps make progress when Toxic Spikes aren't down or against Flying-types. Close Combat is a strong nuke against many of the tier's common Dark- and Steel-types like Hydreigon, Kingambit, and Heatran along with other notable Fighting-weak threats such as Baxcalibur, Ursaluna and Hisuian Arcanine. Dire Claw's incredible chance to inflect status allows it to not only slash through prominent Fairy-types like Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Hatterene but also to make progress in matchups where its traits aren't as valuable like Ghost by inflicting crippling statuses on targets like Hisuian Zoroark and Skeledirge. Fake Out can chip threats down and rack up poison damage or fish for poison before using U-turn to leave, while Taunt takes advantage of Sneasler's incredible speed can stop the dangerous status effects from Salazzle and Amoonguss or recovery moves from Toxapex and Corviknight on Flying teams.</p> <p>Thanks to U-turn, Sneasler can bring in teammates such as specially defensive Alolan Muk or physically defensive Amoonguss to handle would-be answers. In particular, Alolan Muk for with special Psychic- and Ghost-types like Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Basculegion-F with its strong STAB Knock Off. Physically defensive Amoonguss can be bought in on many of the Ground- and Water-types that threaten Sneasler like Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Urshifu-R. Any other physical threat that can threaten Sneasler like Kleavor, Hisuian Arcanine, or Swords Dance Mimikyu can be dealt with by physically bulky Rocky Helmet Toxapex thanks to Infestation trapping and Haze to deal with boosts. Galarian Slowking's incredible special bulk can allow it to sponge hits for Sneasler from powerful special attackers such as Zapdos, Articuno, and Moltres and then safely pivot back into Sneasler with Chilly Reception; it can also use Future Sight combined with Sneasler's incredible Fighting STAB move to deal immense damage to any foe wishing to tank the hits for its team. Air Balloon Glimmora is a valuable ally that can fight off Ground-types like Choice Scarf Iron treads and Sandy Shocks, hit powerful Flying-Type threats like Moltres and Dragonite with Power Gem, remove hazards if Sneasler loses its Heavy-Duty Boots, and put threats that Sneasler detests such as Toxapex, Corviknight and Sableye on a timer with Corrosion Toxic. Salazzle can also spread Toxic against these threats and use Encore to punish setup from Hisuian Goodra and Kingambit. Choice Scarf Gengar helps majorly against Ghost-types that can outspeed Sneasler like Spectrier, Dragapult. and Flutter Mane while Choice Specs with Icy Wind can remove high profile threats like Garchomp and both formes of Landorus, with both Choice sets having powerful coverage in Thunderbolt to shock Flying-Types such as Moltres, Corviknight, and Pelipper.</p>"

Close Combat and Dire Claw have near-perfect synergy, aside from Dire Claw's ability to punish passive answers—like Toxapex and Slowbro—that swap into its STAB moves. U-turn pivots Sneasler out of switch-ins such as Skeledirge, Aegislash, and Gliscor, bringing in Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Mega Gallade. Switcheroo further punishes walls like Corviknight if the extra speed is unneeded. Alternatively, Rock Slide lets it revenge kill Quiver Dance Volcarona, freeing up a moveslot on Iron Hands, while Toxic Spikes greatly pressure Fairy teams wary of Dire Claw. Night Slash can also be the final move for Sneasler, as it notably hits Gholdengo and Aegislash, but pivoting out of these threats is usually the better option. Choice Scarf Sneasler is a late-game cleaner, so wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as the aforementioned Kommo-o and Mega Gallade are appreciated, as these deal with Corviknight, Gliscor, and Toxapex. Kommo-o also benefits from Sneasler dealing with Fairy-types, as this allows Kommo-o to use Clangorous Soulblaze. Choice Specs Iron Valiant loves being pivoted in safely against physical walls like Skeledirge and Mega Sableye, which wall Sneasler. Assault Vest Iron Hands is a soft check against Gholdengo and Volcarona and can pivot Sneasler in against walls, which it can inconvenience. Hisuian Lilligant and Breloom deal with Gastrodon and Quagsire and also ease the Water and Ground matchups. As with the other setup sweepers, these also love the setup opportunities Sneasler opens up by being able to punish walls with Dire Claw's additional effects or with Switcheroo. Entry hazard support from Cobalion and Great Tusk is also appreciated, and these provide a secondary answer to Mimikyu and Zeraora, respectively. These teammates also appreciate Sneasler's ability to remove Toxic Spikes, greatly easing the matchup against Water and Poison teams.</p>"

Its expansive coverage in Earth Power and Mystical Fire allows it to hit every Steel-type in the tier, such as Celesteela, Skarmory, and Scizor, for super effective damage, securing either an OHKO or a 2HKO on them with a Calm Mind boost. It also allows Enamorus to work around other Fairy-resistant foes such as Skeledirge and Iron Moth as well as offensive checks in Hisuian Arcanine and Victini, while its Speed tier allows it to outspeed and OHKO Nihilego. Taunt is an option to potentially beat and deny recovery from status users like Clefable, Hippowdon, and Chansey that try to slow down or stall Enamorus. Similarly, Iron Moth enjoys many of its checks being removed, particularly Mega Tyranitar and Latias. However, Enamorus's frailty and lack of immediate power makes it difficult for it to break past checks such as Mega Venusaur and Celesteela, which threaten to OHKO it with Sludge Bomb and Heavy Slam, respectively, and aren't OHKOed after a Calm Mind boost. Similarly, Chansey can use Toxic and Seismic Toss to take advantage of Enamorus's lack of longevity. This means it appreciates partners such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, which are capable of Pursuit trapping special walls like Chansey, as well as Cinderace, which can break past Celesteela as well as provide pivoting to bring Enamorus in safely. Its Speed tier also means it is pressured by faster threats such as Iron Moth and Latios. This means it enjoys speed control from partners such as Cinderace and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, which are able to outspeed its offensive checks. To compensate for its relative frailty, it also enjoys slow pivots to bring it in safely, such as Slowbro, Slowking, and Scizor, and in return it provides an offensive check to the Dark-types they are threatened by, such as Mega Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Hydreigon.</p>"

In addition to Earth Power and Mystical Fire, Superpower allows it to threaten a 3HKO on Chansey. This also allows Enamorus to potentially snowball through weakened teams once faster foes like Cinderace have been removed. Alternatively, Psychic hits Poison-types that aren't weak to Earth Power, such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. In addition to Pursuit trappers like Mega Tyranitar, speed control from the likes of Cinderace, and slow pivots like Slowbro, Choice Specs Enamorus functions as an excellent partner to special sweepers such as Iron Moth, Keldeo, and Blacephalon due to its ability to remove checks to it without competing for the same team slot. These options can also be used to remove Steel- and Poison-types to allow Enamorus to use its powerful Moonblast more freely. As Enamorus is weak to Stealth Rock, it appreciates being partnered with strong entry hazard removal options, such as Rapid Spin Excadrill, Defog Salamence, Defog Tapu Fini, and Court Change Cinderace, which allow it to more easily work around opposing entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and suicide leads like Excadrill. Due to its Choice Specs, however, Enamorus becomes prediction-reliant against teams that stack multiple Fairy-resistant foes, so Stealth Rock and Knock Off support from Clefable, Tyranitar, and Scizor allows it to more effectively break down its checks over the course of a game.</p>"

Earth Power targets Steel-types like Excadrill and Aegislash, Fire-types like Victini, Cinderace, and Iron Moth, and it's also Enamorus's strongest attack against Mega Venusaur. Mystical Fire hits specific Steel-types that don't mind Earth Power, namely Skarmory, Scizor, and Celesteela; its Special Attack-lowering effect also provides some utility against Autotomize variants of the latter. Alternatively, Grass Knot can 2HKO Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Finally, Focus Blast serves as a middle ground option against Steel-types like Excadrill and Skarmory while also OHKOing the Tyranitar formes, though its shaky accuracy combined with Enamorus's frailty makes it risky to use. Enamorus best fits on offense teams looking for a form of speed control that can revenge kill fast threats such as Cinderace. Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, entry hazard removers such as Excadrill and Tapu Fini are essential teammates. Due to Enamorus's low bulk, pivots such as Cinderace can help it safely get onto the field. Enamorus also appreciates the defensive backbone provided by bulky partners such as Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Skamory; Pokemon that resist Steel like the latter are important as checks to Scizor and Sand Rush Excadrill. Enamorus lacks the power to OHKO certain foes like Victini and Thundurus-T from full health, while they can often cripple or OHKO it back, making hazard setters like Excadrill and Mew good partners as they can chip these foes into KO range. Enamorus struggles to get past certain Poison-types like Mega Venusaur, making checks to them like Choice Specs Latios useful. Enamorus also has no way of getting past Blissey and Chansey, making physical wallbreakers such as Buzzwole necessary teammates. Healing Wish is best used to either give a sweeper like Dragon Dance Tyranitar or Celesteela a second opportunity to sweep, or a bulky wallbreaker like Iron Hands or Scizor the health needed to continue breaking holes into the opposing team.</p>"

Alternatively, Enamorus can forgo Mystical Fire for Substitute to take advantage of pivoting attempts as well as sponge attacks from revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Iron Valiant, although it makes it less effective at hitting Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. If using Substitute, Enamorus can opt for Leftovers instead of the standard Heavy-Duty Boots to potentially set up more Substitutes. Tera Ground boosts the power of Earth Power, allowing it to KO most Toxapex and Gholdengo sets after a boost, as well as giving it an immunity to Tapu Koko and Rotom-W's Electric-type attacks.

What Draining Kiss may lack in power, it makes up for with its ability to keep Enamorus-T healthy, which is critical, since this set is focused on longevity over raw damage. Earth Power pairs exceedingly well with it, giving Enamorus-T impressive coverage that is resisted by only a few Pokemon while hitting threats like Gholdengo and Heatran super effectively. Leftovers help keep Enamorus-T healthy while it racks up boosts, but Heavy-Duty Boots keeps it safe from Stealth Rock, which poses to cut away a significant amount of HP once Enamorus-T switches in. Grassy Seed can also be run if Enamorus-T is paired with Rillaboom, as the instant Defense boost can aid it greatly in setting up. Terastallization aids Enamorus-T's ability to set up by mixing up its defensive profile;Tera Steel allows it to deal with Poison- and Steel-types, giving it a chance to take Dire Claw from Sneasler and Iron Head from Kingambit, respectively. It also removes its weakness to Electric, giving it a better matchup against Zapdos. In addition, with Overcoat, Tera Steel makes Enamorus-T a very capable Amoonguss switch-in, letting it use it as setup fodder for a potential sweep. Tera Water maintains the resistance to Steel while also giving it a resistance to Ice, and can turn Enamorus-T into a useful Walking Wake check in a pinch.

Offensive hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott also help by wearing down the opponent's team. If Enamorus-T is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, then hazard removal is a necessity, so Pokemon like Great Tusk and Cinderace are further appreciated.</p>"

Flower Trick makes Meowscarada a great late-game cleaner against Ground and Water teams, or just in general, taking out threats such as Great Tusk, Greninja, and Flutter Mane. Knock Off can target Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon, such as Gholdengo and Espathra, while removing items from walls such as Toxapex's Black Sludge, Klefki's Light Clay, and Skeledirge's Heavy-Duty Boots. Play Rough allows Meowscarada to clean through weakened Dragon teams, and it's a useful move late-game against other Dark teams. Alternatively, Meowscarada can run Toxic Spikes to cripple foes such as Great Tusk. U-turn picks up momentum for its team on forced switches, for example against Greninja. Choice Scarf plus its Speed and Protean allows it to take on threats such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Great Tusk, and Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Greninja and Meowscarada can break through each other's checks: Greninja can beat Toxapex and Corviknight for Meowscarada, while Choice Scarf Meowscarada can revenge kill Flutter Mane for Greninja. Chien-Pao can prevent walls such as Toxapex from healing with Taunt, allowing Meowscarada to better pressure Water teams; it can also pressure Flying- and Dragon-types for Meowscarada, beating threats such as Dragonite. Chien-Pao can also break past walls such as Clodsire and Amoonguss for Meowscarada. Kingambit is an incredible late-game sweeper, picking off faster threats like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane with Sucker Punch, and it beats down Fairy-types such as Hatterene for Meowscarada. In return, Meowscarada can pick off Iron Valiant, allowing Kingambit to better pressure Fairy teams. Ting-Lu sets Stealth Rock and Spikes, allowing Meowscarada to clean more easily late-game. Additionally, it can check slower Pokemon such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clodsire with Taunt alongside Earthquake or Ruination. It can also stomach strong special attacks such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast, OHKOing Flutter Mane in return with Heavy Slam. Sableye can switch into Fighting-type attacks for Meowscarada, such as Great Tusk's Close Combat, and either cripple their users with Prankster Will-O-Wisp or force them to switch with Prankster Encore. Sableye can also prevent Pokemon like Clodsire and Brambleghast from setting entry hazards thanks to Prankster Taunt. Skuntank can ease the Fairy matchup by beating Hatterene one-on-one, which lets Meowscarada set Toxic Spikes safely. It can also trap Klefki with Fire Spin, preventing dual screens from staying on the field for too long. Finally, Hydreigon can take on walls such as Toxapex for Meowscarada with Substitute + Nasty Plot, safely setting up and overpowering them.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Meowscarada finds itself as the best revenge killer to threatening setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Hydreigon, and Armarouge available to Grass teams thanks to its good offensive stats paired with a strong ability in Protean. This is further supported by a great Speed tier, which allows it to serve as a strong cleaner in multiple matchups such as versus Water, Fighting, Dark and Ghost teams with a Choice Scarf. Flower Trick enables Meowscarada to break through Defense boosted Pokemon such as Curse Dondozo, as well as Pokemon behind dual screens such as Flutter Mane. Play Rough provides the Fairy coverage that enables Meowscarada to threaten Fighting, Dragon, and Dark teams. U-turn is used to allow Meowscarada to pivot out against checks to it, such as Toxapex and Skeledirge, to bring in a teammate that can break through it, such as Breloom and Toedscruel, while also maintaining momentum.</p> <p>While Meowscarada is an effective cleaner, it cannot exactly break through certain Pokemon by itself. Choice Band Breloom is a great teammate for Meowscarada, as it can break through Meowscarada's checks such as Toxapex, Kingambit, and Clodsire. Meowscarada is also vulnerable to Pokemon with strong priority and revenge killers faster than it such as Breloom and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane. Defensive walls such as Amoonguss and Wo-Chien can switch into said priority attacks and revenge killing attempts for Meowscarada. Amoonguss in particular also removes Toxic Spikes, which can be useful for Meowscarada and its teammates. Brambleghast and Toedscruel provide entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin, while also setting up hazards of their own in Spikes. Abomasnow gives an important Ice neutrality to Grass teams, which in tandem with the Defense boost provided by Snow allows it to serve as an answer to Ice-type threats such as Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Swords Dance Iron Leaves and Rotom-C provide counterplay to Corviknight that Grass teams otherwise lack, with the former appreciating Meowscarada pivoting out to it when facing Poison-types such as Dragalge and Toxapex, threatening Poison teams in general with its Psychic-type STAB moves and Fighting-type coverage attacks, while the latter forms a pivoting core with Meowscarada.</p>"

Flower Trick's guaranteed critical hit is also very useful in the Fairy matchup and lets Meowscarada revenge kill Azumarill and a weakened Tapu Lele behind Reflect. U-turn allows Meowscarada to maintain an advantage against its defensive checks like Corviknight by being able to pivot into its teammates like Scovillain. Knock Off is a tool to cripple Meowscarada's defensive switch-ins like Toxapex and Klefki in addition to the aforementioned Corviknight. Play Rough is a strong coverage option to threaten opposing Dragon-type Pokemon like Kommo-o, Kyurem, and Latios, which Grass teams tend to struggle against. Low Kick is a less frequent option but lets Meowscarada OHKO Bisharp while threatening Heatran with a 2HKO; however, Play Rough is preferred to have an easier time against Dragon teams. Meowscarada has an easier time revenge killing foes with entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Cradily. Ferrothorn appreciates Meowscarada's ability to check Fighting-types like Mega Gallade, Iron Valiant and Galarian Zapdos with STAB Play Rough. Hisuian Lilligant is also a fantastic offensive partner for Meowscarada. It is able to check the Flying-types that switch into Meowscarada like Celesteela and Landorus-T while also assisting in the Dragon matchup, outspeeding common Pokemon like Garchomp and Dragonite. Hisuian Lilligant also makes the Steel matchup easier for Grass; its ability to threaten Heatran is appreciated by Meowscarada, while Meowscarada can threaten Gholdengo with Knock Off, which Lilligant cannot beat. Mega Venusaur is also a mandatory defensive partner for Meowscarada; its Bug neutrality and bulk allows it to act as a consistent check to Mega Scizor, which easily switches into any move of Meowscarada, and Venusaur is able to check it with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Venusaur also checks opposing Fairy-types for Meowscarada like Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Iron Valiant, while Meowscarada is able to threaten the Psychic-types that force out Mega Venusaur such as Latios, Mega Alakazam, and Victini. Whismicott is one of the best hazard removal options on Grass, and Meowscarada appreciates not having Stealth Rock and Spikes chip it down, because it comes in often to threaten a KO. Whimsicott's Fairy typing also allows Meowscarada and its teammates not to be overwhelmed by Dragon-types like Garchomp, and it can encore Calm Mind Mega Latias.

U-turn gives coverage against other Grass-types like Rillaboom, Serperior, and opposing Meowscarada, as well as pivoting out Meowscarda from its checks and gaining momentum.

Meowscarada is vulnerable to revenge killers like Dragonite, Zamazenta-C, and Chien-Pao, so teammates that can switch into these threats like Corviknight and Quaquaval make good partners.</p>"

Tera Flying gives Skeledirge an immunity to Ground-type moves, which can be helpful against Arceus-Ground and Stomping Tantrum Koraidon.

As a result, it may be advantageous to anticipate U-turn in these scenarios.</li> <li>Taunt is often employed as a method to bypass Skeledirge's Will-O-Wisp, especially by Koraidon and E-Killer Arceus. If you expect the foe to use Taunt, taking advantage of the situation and gaining Special Attack boosts with Torch Song is a great way to limit their ability to wallbreak.</li> <li>Ting-Lu and Clodsire are excellent teammates for Skeledirge, as they cover most of the special attackers that come in on it, especially Miraidon, while Skeledirge can in turn handle most physical threats. Together they form a solid defensive backbone.</li> <li>Skeledirge is unable to take on Ground-type physical attackers like Arceus-Ground, Tera Ground Zacian-C, and Groudon without using Tera itself. As a result, Pokemon that resist or are immune to Ground like Corviknight, Giratina-O, Landorus-T, and Arceus-Grass make for good partners. Corviknight has the additional benefit of solidifying the matchup against E-Killer Arceus.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy is useful as a backup check to Koraidon, and it makes it much more difficult for Koraidon to get easy momentum with U-turn.</li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Skeledirge is a fantastic defensive Pokemon thanks to its great bulk and Unaware letting it check dangerous Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Volcarona, and Hatterene. Unlike other walls, however, Skeledirge can also be a foreboding wincon with Torch Song and its great offensive typing, which gives it nearly unresisted coverage. Will-O-Wisp gives it value against switch-ins such as Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Clodsire and cripples physical attackers like Great Tusk and Garchomp. Hex benefits from Skeledirge spreading burns, 2HKOing Pokemon such as Dragonite, Iron Hands, and physically defensive Dondozo unboosted, and Toxapex after a single boost from Torch Song. Tera Fairy bolsters Skeledirge against Dragon-types that would otherwise overwhelm it like Dragapult, Dragonite, and Garchomp. It also lets Skeledirge beat Quaquaval and lose its Ground weakness, letting it more easily spread burns against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Garchomp. In a pinch, it can bait Dark-type moves from Pokemon like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Meowscarada, Terastallize the same turn, and punish them with Will-O-Wisp. Tera Fairy also maintains Skeledirge's ability to beat Iron Valiant, Volcarona, and Hatterene.</p> <p>Skeledirge fits on many bulky offense, balance, and stall teams as a much-appreciated answer to common wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene. Skeledirge often ends up entry hazard fodder for Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Thus, secure hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight are excellent partners. Additionally, Great Tusk can 2HKO the aforementioned Pokemon, helping set Skeledirge up for a potential sweep, while Corviknight walls the aforementioned Ground-types, can bring Skeledirge in later with U-turn, and can absorb Knock Off from the likes of Great Tusk, Meowscarada, and Iron Treads. Pokemon such as Meowscarada and Iron Valiant can overwhelm Skeledirge answers like Gholdengo, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu. In addition to this, they appreciate Skeledirge's ability to beat Hatterene and, after Terastallizing, Dragapult. Covert Cloak Gholdengo can beat any Garganacl using Skeledirge as setup fodder. Bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Toxapex help deal with offensive Water-types like Greninja and Quaquaval. Additionally, they can both spread status, facilitating Skeledirge's Hex. Rotom-W in particular can offensively check Ground-types like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Ting-Lu too, although it cannot directly switch into them. Offensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Dragonite appreciate Skeledirge halting scary Pokemon, like Volcarona and Iron Valiant, and they help it overwhelm checks like Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire.</p>"

        "Substitute": {
          "description": "<p>With Substitute, Skeledirge can use its typing and bulk to consistently check Garganacl and more easily snowball with Torch Song. Substitute also allows Skeledirge to scout Choice item Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Dragonite, as well as protecting it from revenge killers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon more reliably. Substitute also lets Skeledirge set up against the likes of Garganacl and Cinderace, and it blocks from status from the likes of Toxapex, Clodsire, and Thunder Wave Rotom-W. Maximum HP investment means that Garganacl cannot break Substitute with Salt Cure. 40 Defense EVs let Skeledirge survive two Bulldozes from Focus Sash Breloom, meaning it can consistently outheal Bulldoze, barring a critical hit. 188 Special Defense EVs ensures it survives a Shadow Ball from non-Tera Ghost Choice Specs Dragapult, while 28 Speed EVs let it outspeed Kingambit. Tera Fairy helps stop the likes of Dragapult and Great Tusk from overwhelming Skeledirge, especially the former, which bypasses Substitute with Infiltrator but cannot 2HKO Skeledirge after it Terastallizes. Tera Fairy also prevents Garganacl's Earthquake from breaking Substitute.</p> <p>Substitute Skeledirge fits best on bulky offense and balance teams as a good check to Garganacl. Pokemon Garganacl can overwhelm such as Dragonite, Hex Dragapult, Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, Calm Mind Hatterene, Corviknight, Toxapex, and Dondozo can lure it in for Skeledirge to set up Substitute on and snowball. Additionally, the former can break through Pokemon that wall Skeledirge, namely Toxapex and Clodsire, and Dragapult and Corviknight also boast U-turn, letting them pivot into Skeledirge on a Garganacl switch-in. The setup sweepers enjoy Skeledirge's potent wallbreaking, too. Toxapex and Dondozo also check Pokemon that overwhelm Skeledirge, such as Dragapult and Greninja. Pokemon that do not mind Knock Off like Great Tusk and Corviknight greatly help this set, as Skeledirge is both weak to Knock Off and reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots due to its Stealth Rock weakness. These Pokemon also double as entry hazard removers, with the former preventing Gholdengo from entering safely and the latter checking Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Meowscarada can chip down Pokemon that wall Skeledirge like Ting-Lu and Clodsire. In return, Skeledirge can threaten common entry hazard answers like Hatterene and Corviknight, as well as spinblocking in a pinch.</p>"

These traits make it a hard-to-break physical wall and a potential wincon as well. Will-O-Wisp lets it cripple physical attackers such as Mega Tyranitar, Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T while also punishing Water-types such as Rotom-W. Combined with Will-O-Wisp, Hex helps it overwhelm passive checks in Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Clodsire while also allowing Skeledirge to sweep statused teams. While not as strong as Hex, Shadow Ball is a decent option as it's more consistent. Tera Water allows Skeledirge to beat rain teams by spreading burns against rain sweepers such as Mega Swampert, Barraskewda, and Floatzel. On the other hand, Tera Fairy allows it to counter Dragon Dance Dragapult and avoid Pursuit from Kingambit, Mega Tyranitar, and Weavile while also keeping a Fighting resistance, meaning it can still check Zamazenta. It also removes Skeledirge's Ground weakness, allowing it to comfortably burn Pokemon like Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T. Skeledirge struggles against Heatran and Garganacl, as it can't burn them nor deal significant damage to them. Therefore, Pokemon that pressure them like Garchomp and Rotom-W for the former and Cover Cloak Gholdengo for the latter make good partners. Skeledirge also hates losing its item, so Knock Off absorbers like Flyinium Z Tornadus-T and Gliscor make for good teammates. The former can also weaken Heatran for it while Skeledirge can burn Mega Tyranitar. Special sponges like Gastrodon, Clodsire, and Toxapex all appreciate Skeledirge's ability to cripple physical attackers such as Kartana, Mega Lopunny, and Kingambit, alleviating the pressure these Pokemon exert on them. In return, they can all handle special attackers like Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Mega Charizard Y.</p>"

Torkoal pairs well with Skeledirge due to its ability to both remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and set them up, all while also powering up Skeledirge's Torch Song.

Earth Power is an option that chips Miraidon and Eternatus as well as giving it a super effective hit against Tera Fire Zacian-C and Koraidon. Fairy is the ideal Tera type, giving Skeledirge an immunity to Koraidon's Dragon-type attacks and removing its weaknesses to Ground- and Ghost-type attacks from foes like Arceus-Ground, Calyrex-S, and Giratina-O. Tera Flying is a niche option that further improves its matchup against Arceus-Ground while avoiding super effective Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C. Skeledirge is a good fit on balance teams that appreciate it checking common setup threats and carrying teammates that make up for its shortcomings and bad matchups. Skeledirge is very vulnerable to Miraidon, Kyogre, Calyrex-S, and Arceus-Ground, so it appreciates teammates like Ting-Lu, Eternatus, Wo-Chien, and Giratina-O to handle these powerful attackers. Likewise, Skeledirge pairs well with fast attackers and priority users such as Calyrex-S, Choice Scarf Koraidon, and Extreme Killer Arceus, which can threaten the foes that force Skeledirge out and revenge kill Pokemon it checks if it is overwhelmed.</p>"

Aqua Cutter gives up some power compared to Liquidation but does not make contact, which avoids activating Greavard's Fluffy and Voltorb's Static, and removes the risk of activating Pawniard's Defiant with a Defense drop. Aqua Jet is STAB priority that OHKOs Hisuian Growlithe, while Brave Bird provides super effective coverage versus Grass- and Fighting-types like Toedscool and Foongus. Encore can lock opposing Pokemon into unfavorable moves, such as weak setup moves, gaining momentum for Quaxly's team. Quaxly can use Tera Grass for a better matchup versus Electric- and Grass-types as well as a valuable immunity to Spore from Foongus and Toedscool. Tera Flying can also be used with Brave Bird to turn Quaxly into a more potent offensive threat. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Hisuian Growlithe, Wingull, and Nymble, are great partners for Quaxly, as they appreciate the removal of entry hazards to be used at their full potential. Foongus is another good partner, as it can safely switch into Grass-types and provides valuable Spore support. Pokemon such as Toedscool and Wattrel check Electric-types for Quaxly.</p>"

Bulk Up lets it more easily take out threats like Great Tusk, Armarouge, and Ting-Lu and survive attacks from Pokemon such as Tera Flying Roaring Moon and Azumarill. Close Combat hits Pokemon that can take an Aqua Step, like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Hydreigon, super effectively. Roost gives Quaquaval longevity to accumulate and take advantage of its boosts, and it allows Quaquaval to switch into Kingambit and Cinderace without fearing chip damage. Taunt shuts down Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Skeledirge by preventing the use of recovery and status-inflicting moves. It also blocks Defense-boosting attempts from Curse and Bulk Up users like Great Tusk and Garganacl. Ice Spinner is a great coverage move that hits Pokemon that would otherwise resist Quaquaval's STAB attacks, like Dragonite, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Amoonguss. 112 Speed EVs allow Quaquaval to outspeed Iron Moth after a boost. Tera Water boosts Aqua Step's power and removes Quaquaval's weakness to threats like Iron Valiant, Azumarill, and Future Sight Slowking. Tera Fighting boosts Close Combat’s power to dent threats like Garchomp and Breloom. It also allows Quaquaval to take less damage from Garganacl’s Salt Cure. Tera Poison is a defensive option that allows Quaquaval to resist Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Azumarill, absorb Toxic Spikes, and be immune to Toxapex and Clodsire's Toxic.</p> <p>Quaquaval fits best on offense teams that support its ability to set up and sweep. Entry hazards from Pokemon like Meowscarada and Glimmora give Quaquaval an easier time taking out foes. Pivots like Rotom-W and Cinderace bring Quaquaval safely onto the field against threats like Volcarona and Great Tusk. Cinderace in particular is able to provide entry hazard control with Court Change and can burn foes with Will-O-Wisp, giving Quaquaval an easier time to set up and sweep. Quaquaval targets common Fire-, Ground-, and Dark-types; therefore, it can support teammates weak to them like Corviknight and Gholdengo. In return, Corviknight can pivot Quaquaval into battle, come in on Assault Vest Toxapex, and remove entry hazards. Gholdengo blocks status that prevent Quaquaval from sweeping should it not run Taunt. Quaquaval struggles against Pokemon like Dragonite, Dragapult, and Azumarill; therefore, threats to them like Scizor and Iron Valiant make good teammates. Scizor checks Azumarill, while Iron Valiant checks Dragonite and Dragapult.</p>"

Alternatively, Brick Break may be used to retain Quaquaval's defensive stats and clear dual screens in the Ice and Fairy matchups at the cost of extra damage. Aqua Step enables Quaquaval to function as a potential late-game cleaner and threatens Pokemon like Volcarona, Skeledirge, and Unaware Clodsire. Rapid Spin is used to clear entry hazards, aiding against entry hazard-stacking teams. The given EV spread allows Quaquaval to outpace Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao after a single Rapid Spin or Aqua Step boost, OHKO Flutter Mane after one Moxie boost, and better deal with priority moves from Breloom and Kingambit.</p> <p>Greninja breaks past troublesome walls like Toxapex, Sableye, and Water Absorb Clodsire due to its wide range of coverage.

Gastrodon and Quagsire are valued for their Electric-type immunity against Pokemon like Rotom-W, Sandy Shocks, and Magnezon as well as their entry hazards, supporting Quaquaval as a cleaner. Pelipper can set rain to boost Quaquaval's Aqua Step and pressures Grass-types like Breloom, Infiltrator Brambleghast, and Meowscarada with Hurricane.

Its ability to scare out many common threats such as Espathra, Chien-Pao, and Dragapult is highly valuable. Lokix struggles to break past many physically defensive walls like Quagsire, Dondozo, and Corviknight; however, it can pivot in teammates—such as Vivillon and Volcarona—that can beat them. A Choice Band with an Adamant nature maximizes Lokix's damage output and can utilise Axe Kick to lure and defeat Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Life Orb avoids a Choice lock and makes use of Sucker Punch to pick off threats that First Impression alone cannot such as Gholdengo and Flutter Mane. Throat Chop lets Lokix deal good unresisted STAB damage and prevents Skeledirge from using Torch Song, which is extremely valuable and one of the reasons Lokix is a necessity for Bug teams.</p> <p>Lokix is highly susceptible to entry hazards and is often not quite strong enough to OHKO many Pokemon. Forretress is a great entry hazard remover and entry hazard setter, fixing both of those issues. Forretress also has a good defensive profile, acting as a sponge for absorbing damage, and it can even form a VoltTurn core with Lokix. Scizor removes Fairy-types that threaten Lokix such as Hatterene and Iron Valiant and allows Lokix to clean up after it has done enough damage. Volcarona takes care of Steel-types that don't fall to Axe Kick such as Corviknight and Scizor. Lokix can remove Ghost-types—such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane—to enable Slither Wing and Heracross, letting them spam their powerful Fighting-type moves and clean up after Lokix. Frosmoth can deal with many bulky Ground-types—such as Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu—and Vivillon improves the Fighting-type matchup by beating Great Tusk, Gallade, and Paldean Tauros-W and can answer Dondozo with the combination of Sleep Powder and Energy Ball.

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its high Speed, unique typing, and powerful Electric-type STAB move in Double Shock, Pawmot sets itself apart as one of the premier wallbreakers in UU. Seed Bomb allows Pawmot to lure common checks such as Quagsire and Gastrodon and OHKO them handily. Alternatively, Ice Punch provides a solid middle ground against Ground- and Flying-types, in cases where losing Pawmot's Electric typing via Double Shock is not ideal, as well as allowing Pawmot to hit Brambleghast effectively, although this does require backup for Gastrodon and Quagsire. Natural Cure allows it to not worry about Talonflame's Flame Body and use Rest to improve its longevity, offsetting the damage from Life Orb and entry hazards. Tera Electric allows for Pawmot to continuously use Double Shock without switching out and increases its power, making it even more difficult to handle. This also helps Pawmot's defensive matchup against threats such as Gardevoir, Noivern, and Brave Bird Talonflame; although, one should still be aware of losing important resistances to strong priority attacks such as Slither Wing's First Impression and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Heavy-Duty Boots is also an option over Life Orb to preserve Pawmot's longevity.</p> <p>Pawmot fits well on teams that benefit from its ability to handle common threats such as Tinkaton, Slowking, and Tyranitar by breaking through them with raw power, as well as offensive teams that appreciate its excellent Speed. Reliable entry hazard setters such as Tinkaton and Sandy Shocks are worth considering, as the chip damage they provide makes it even easier for Pawmot to break through defensive threats, with the former also boasting Encore to help generate free turns. Grass-types such as Wo-Chien, Brambleghast, and Tsareena are also appreciated to handle Gastrodon and Quagsire, especially if Pawmot chooses Ice Punch, with the latter two also offering reliable hazard removal. Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Lycanroc-D that handle Talonflame as well as other Flying-types such as Iron Jugulis and Noivern are also appreciated. Scream Tail is also a teammate worth considering, as it has access to Stealth Rock and Encore, as well as Wish to keep Pawmot healthy and Thunder Wave to cripple fast threats like Grafaiai and Gengar while also having a strong matchup against revenge killers such as Noivern and Iron Jugulis. Pawmot also appreciates teammates with pivoting moves, such as Scizor, Tsareena, Noivern, and Grafaiai, to allow it to come in safely, especially against targets such as Tinkaton and Slowking.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Pawmot is a solid threat in the UU metagame and becomes an excellent revenge killer when paired with Choice Scarf, threatening Pokemon like Talonflame, Wo-Chien, and Salamence. Pawmot's last moveslot can be either Revival Blessing or Seed Bomb. Revival Blessing allows Pawmot to revive a teammate on a forced switch, while Seed Bomb can threaten Pokemon like Quagsire and Gastrodon better. Revival Blessing is more commonly run, as Close Combat can usually do enough damage to break these walls with some entry hazard assistance. An Electric Tera type is vital for Pawmot, as it allows Pawmot to spam Double Shock without repercussion. Natural Cure allows Pawmot to shrug off burns from the likes of Talonflame and Altaria, as they would otherwise hinder Pawmot's offensive presence.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Pawmot best fits on Spikes stacking teams in need of speed control. This makes Pokemon like Quagsire and Gastrodon good teammates, as they enjoy setting up Stealth Rock or Spikes, and the former can also use Toxic to chip teams down more efficiently for Pawmot. Pawmot struggles to deal with bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon, making teammates like Brambleghast and Wo-Chien appreciated due to their ability to soak up Earthquake while also removing hazards or removing Heavy-Duty Boots to rack up entry hazard damage, respectively. Pokemon that can outspeed Pawmot, like Choice Scarf Gengar and +2 Polteageist, can cause major issues, making priority users like Scizor and Lycanroc-D good partners to KO these threats.</p>"

        "All-out Attacker (Electric)": {
          "description": "<p>Pawmot is a great wallbreaker on Electric teams, outspeeding foes like Garchomp, Landorus, and Sandy Shocks. Close Combat does not receive the benefits of Pawmot's ability and item, but it helps beat pesky foes like Ursaluna-B, Hisuian Goodra, and Baxcalibur, which are immune to or resist its Electric-type attacks. Close Combat is also a good move to beat foes like Ting-Lu and Kingambit which Pawmot's teammates might struggle against. Thunder Punch is an alternative STAB move, as it hits common walls like Corviknight and Toxapex while also threatening Pelipper on rain teams, thus preventing the opponent from setting up rain for Barraskewda repeatedly. Thunder Punch also helps versus Belly Drum Azumarill, preventing it from setting up. Mach Punch is Pawmot's preferred second STAB move, as it offers strong priority, securing an OHKO on foes like Chien-Pao, Meowscarada, and Greninja after a single layer of Spikes. Mach Punch also nullifies Kingambit's Sucker Punch by outspeeding it with priority. Revival Blessing is another alternative that can be used over Mach Punch, as it offers a unique and valuable type of utility by allowing a teammate to be revived. This may prove to be a huge benefit in some matchups like the Electric mirror, where Pawmot can revive teammates like Sandy Shocks after the opposing Rotom-W is low on HP or has already fainted. Ice Punch hits foes like the Landorus formes, Gliscor, Clodsire, and mixed Amoonguss. The last coverage move is Seed Bomb, as it hits Pokemon like Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Rotom-W, which can prove troublesome for Pawmot's teammates to break. Seed Bomb also compounds with Thunder Punch to hit every Water-type in the game for super effective damage, making Pawmot incredibly powerful in the Water matchup. Punching Glove helps Pawmot avoid chip damage from Rocky Helmet on foes like Rough Skin Garchomp while also avoiding status effects like burn from foes like Flame Body Volcarona, Moltres, and Talonflame.</p> <p>Pawmot greatly benefits from teammates like Regieleki, which can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards for Pawmot and pivot well into other teammates with the help of Volt Switch. Regieleki's extremely high Speed tier also allows it to revenge kill foes like Enamorus, weakened Walking Wake, and, if using Magnet and Wild Charge, Flutter Mane. In return, Regieleki appreciates Pawmot dealing with Ground-type Pokemon, like Quagsire and Gliscor, with the help of Seed Bomb and Ice Punch due to Regieleki's lack of coverage moves. Iron Hands is another great teammate, as it allows Pawmot to run alternative sets, like Thunder Punch over Fighting-type STAB moves, since Iron Hands can run these moves in its stead. Assault Vest Iron Hands also has immense bulk and acts like a sponge for special attacks from foes like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Volcarona, which can cause great problems for Pawmot, since it is relatively frail. Iron Hands can also slow pivot into Pawmot with the help of Volt Switch. In return, Pawmot deals with walls like Quagsire and offensive Rotom-W, which Iron Hands may face difficulty in breaking. Sandy Shocks sets hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes to boost Pawmot's wallbreaking potential by providing necessary chip on foes while also being able to provide a Ground immunity thanks to Air Balloon, thus behaving like a switch-in against foes like opposing Sandy Shocks, Choice Scarf Iron Treads, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge. In exchange, Pawmot helps break foes like the Landorus formes and Gliscor that wall Sandy Shocks completely. Pawmot also threatens foes like Baxcalibur, Dragonite, mixed Amoonguss, and Galarian Slowking, which can cause problems for Sandy Shocks. Rotom-W is an essential teammate for Pawmot, as it provides a much-needed Ground immunity while also offering great utility with its defensive sets that run Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Hydro Pump on Rotom-W deals with pesky Ground-types like Great Tusk and Mamoswine, which Pawmot struggles against. Defensive Rotom-W benefits from Pawmot's ability to take down foes like Water Absorb Clodsire and Gastrodon. Thus, together they form a strong core on Electric-type teams. Teammates like Thundurus, Thundurus-T and Zapdos provide a Ground immunity for Pawmot while also threatening strong Fighting-type foes like Zamazenta and Great Tusk. Zapdos can break these physically bulky Pokemon with the help of Hurricane, while Thundurus-T can use Psychic as a coverage move for Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and physically defensive Amoonguss. In return, they appreciate Pawmot's ability to break specially defensive walls that hinder Zapdos and Thundurus-T's wallbreaking capability. Thundurus provides great support with Prankster Thunder Wave, paralyzing fast foes like Dragapult and Flutter Mane and allowing Pawmot to outspeed them. Magnezone pairs well with Pawmot, as it can act like a sponge for Fairy-type moves from foes like Hatterene, Iron Valiant, and Flutter Mane and force them out with Flash Cannon. In return, Pawmot helps to break special walls like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire, which Magnezone can't break.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Pawmot is a great Choice Scarf user on Electric teams by virtue of its coverage and utility, being able to deal with Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane. With Revival Blessing, Pawmot can give second chances to fallen offensive Pokemon such as Iron Hands and Choice Specs Zapdos to punch holes in opposing teams. Double Shock allows Pawmot to OHKO threats such as Flutter Mane and Azumarill as well as finishing off Iron Valiant, but this comes with the downside of Pawmot immediately being forced out after using the move. Ice Punch allows Pawmot to deal decent damage to Ground-types that resist both its STAB moves, notably OHKOing both Landorus formes as well as 2HKOing both Iron Leaves and Clodsire. Volt Switch allows Pawmot to pivot out of a check such as Amoonguss into one of its teammates to deal with it. Play Rough and Seed Bomb are usable alternatives, with Play Rough being able to 2HKO Sableye while still hitting Dragon-types and Seed Bomb dealing with Water/Ground types that most Electric-type Pokemon cannot handle efficiently. Notably, Seed Bomb OHKOes specially defensive Gastrodon and 2HKOes physically defensive Quagsire. Grass Knot can also be used, being able to 2HKO Quagsire as well as Great Tusk.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks provides great hazard support to wear down incoming foes for Pawmot to take advantage of. Ground-immune Pokemon such as Zapdos and Rotom-W are appreciated by Pawmot, being able to switch into an anticipated Ground-type attack from the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Zapdos can also threaten Grass-types such as Amoonguss, while Rotom-W together with Pawmot can overwhelm Quagsire. In return, Pawmot can revive one of them so it can continue checking Ground-types when needed. Regieleki provides hazard removal and a fast pivot for Electric teams, and in return it appreciates Ground-types being lured in and removed by Seed Bomb Pawmot variants. Assault Vest Iron Hands is another great teammate, being able to switch into attacks that could OHKO Pawmot such as Dragapult's Draco Meteor and Enamorus's Moonblast. Iron Hands can also OHKO the latter when running Heavy Slam. In return, Pawmot can run Seed Bomb to handle Water/Ground types Iron Hands cannot efficiently threaten such as Quagsire, and Swords Dance variants of Iron Hands appreciate it removing Flutter Mane and wearing down Sableye. Magnezone is a great partner, being able to threaten the Fairy-types that can threaten Pawmot such as Hatterene and Flutter Mane.</p>"

Its great typing and decent overall bulk give it ample opportunity to keep itself and its teammates healthy while checking threats like Gabite and Alolan Persian. Well-Baked Body also lets Dachsbun switch into Fire-types like Charizard and Houndoom as well as absorb Will-O-Wisp from Misdreavus and Charizard, all of which threaten other Wish passers like Leafeon. Body Press prevents Steel-types from walling Dachsbun and also gets stronger if Well-Baked Body has already been triggered. Play Rough is good coverage alongside Body Press and hits Misdreavus, but Roar can be used instead to force setup sweepers like Gogoat and Carbink out as well as rack up chip damage if entry hazards are up. Copycat can be used to copy entry hazards from Pokemon like Whiscash as well as beat certain setup sweepers like Iron Defense Carbink one-on-one. Tera Steel lets Dachsbun absorb Steel- and Poison-type attacks and gives it an edge against Pokemon such as Sludge Bomb Houndoom, Articuno, and Indeedee-F. Dachsbun can run 64 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral-natured Honchkrow at the cost of some bulk. Dachsbun can also opt for a physically defensive spread to better take on Pokemon like Lycanroc-N and, after Terastallizing, Zangoose.</p> <p>Dachsbun fits best on balance teams in need of cleric support and a blanket check to various offensive threats. Pokemon like Gabite, Mareanie, and Tinkatuff can check Steel- and Poison-types like Alolan Dugtrio and Skuntank for Dachsbun, and they appreciate Dachsbun coming to their aid against foes such as Articuno and Pyroar. Charizard is another great partner that switches into Steel-types like Perrserker and non-Rock Slide Alolan Dugtrio and can do so repeatedly thanks to the Wishes Dachsbun passes. Setup sweepers like Rotom-F and Gogoat find it easier to boost multiple times in a game with Dachsbun keeping them healthy. Wish support also gives Gogoat an easier time preserving Milk Drink's limited PP, which allows it to play more recklessly early on against threats that Dachsbun baits in, such as Basculin. In return, these setup sweepers make up for Dachsbun's passivity and can threaten out nuisances like Vespiquen and Whiscash. Misdreavus can spread burns to give Dachsbun an easier time against physical attackers like Crabominable and slow opposing walls down with Taunt. Meanwhile, Dachsbun can stand up to Fire-types like non-Tera Steel Charizard, check Dark-types like Alolan Persian and Honchkrow, and reduce Misdreavus's reliance on Pain Split for recovery.</p>"

It can take hits from Dragapult, Zapdos, and Iron Moth as well as sit on passive walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and non-Grass Knot Amoonguss, giving it plenty of opportunites to enter the field. In addition to letting it contest with Attack-boosting foes like Dragonite, Dragapult, and Roaring Moon, Curse boosts Salt Cure's initial damage to threaten Pokemon like Corviknight, which would otherwise exhaust Salt Cure's PP with Pressure. Curse also works well with Earthquake, breaking past Covert Cloak Gholdengo, non-Haze Toxapex, opposing Garganacl, and Skeledirge's Substitute. Stealth Rock is a viable alternative if the team lacks a Stealth Rock user, since Garganacl tends to force multiple switches with Salt Cure and can outlast and annoy common entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight. Tera Water lets it take on Kingambit, Gholdengo, Azumarill, and rain teams better, while Tera Fairy improves its matchup against Dragapult, Great Tusk, and Meowscarada, the latter of which can bypass Garganacl's boosts with Flower Trick. The EV spread prevents a 2HKO from offensive Great Tusk's Close Combat or Headlong Rush after Curse, even after its Leftovers is removed by Knock Off.</p> <p>Curse Garganacl is a valuable asset for balance teams. Defensive teammates such as Corviknight, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Clodsire cover threats like Great Tusk, Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo, respectively. Skeledirge in return appreciates Garganacl switching into Shadow Ball from Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark, with Tera Water variants dealing with Gholdengo and Water-types as well, while Ting-Lu and Clodsire are secondary checks to Dragapult, Heatran, and Iron Moth, which keeps Garganacl moderately healthy early-game so it can have an easier time sweeping later on. Knock Off users such as Great Tusk and Meowscarada are crucial to remove Covert Cloak and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Amoonguss, Clodsire, Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Slowking. Great Tusk, Meowscarada, Toxapex, and Clodsire can also set entry hazards of their own, either allowing Garganacl to forgo Stealth Rock or forming an entry hazard stacking core. Offensive teammates like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Meowscarada are great against offensive teams that contain the likes of Dragonite and Roaring Moon—which can overwhelm Garganacl prior to boosting—and can clean up late-game in case Garganacl is unable to fully sweep. In return, Garganacl matches up well against defensive foes that they struggle with, such as Clodsire and Toxapex, especially with Dragapult bringing it into them safely via U-turn.</p>"

Protect alongside Salt Cure wears down entry hazard removal options such as Great Tusk and especially Corviknight due to its limited Roost PP and typing's vulnerability to Salt Cure. Protect also scouts out the intentions of Choice locked Pokemon such as Gholdengo and gives extra Leftovers recovery. Terastallization, lets Garganacl turn the tables on Great Tusk and Iron Treads lacking Iron Head, and makes it an incredibly consistent Stealth Rock setter. Specifically, Tera Fairy lets it completely wall Dragapult, while Tera Water lets it check Gholdengo, though this makes its matchup against opposing Garganacl much tougher. 116 Special Defense EVs let Garganacl take a Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Tera Dragon Dragapult at full health.</p> <p>Garganacl fits on a wide variety of teams from bulky offense to stall thanks to it setting up Stealth Rock easily and having fantastic longevity. Ting-Lu is a fantastic partner since it can lay Spikes, and check Gholdengo and unboosted Kingambit, and wear down Corviknight much faster with Ruination thanks to Garganacl running Stealth Rock. Meowscarada and Great Tusk provide Knock Off support by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak from Gholdengo and Toxapex to let Garganacl accrue Salt Cure damage more freely. Great Tusk also removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Gholdengo appreciates Great Tusk being worn down, since it shuts down other forms of entry hazard control well and fits alongside Garganacl and other entry hazard setters such as Garchomp. Cinderace lures in and uses U-turn on bulky Water-types such as Dondozo and Toxapex, giving Garganacl free entry to pressure them with Salt Cure.</p>"

          "description": "<p>The combination of Iron Defense + Body Press lets Garganacl serve as a bulky and dangerous setup sweeper, allowing it to beat Pokemon it otherwise loses to, such as Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit. Salt Cure wears down common switch-ins such as Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Rotom-W, and Hatterene, as well as passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Corviknight, and forces them to burn recovery PP more often. Recover keeps Garganacl healthy throughout a game to check Pokemon like Ceruledge and Iron Moth and makes it more sustainable as a wincon. Purifying Salt prevents it from being crippled by Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Clodsire. It also provides a handy Ghost resistance, letting Garganacl potentially switch in on predicted Ghost-type moves from Pokemon like Dragapult and Skeledirge. Leftovers provides valuable passive recovery, reducing Garganacl's reliance on Recover. Maximum Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature maximize Garganacl's bulk, making it easier for Garganacl to switch in on Pokemon such as Dragapult, Zapdos, and Heatran and use them as setup fodder. Tera Water provides incredibly valuable resistances, letting Garganacl potentially check Gholdengo and Scizor while retaining its ability to pivot in on Fire-types like Cinderace. Tera Fairy allows Garganacl to turn the tables on Great Tusk while also preventing Breloom from revenge killing it. However, this does remove its resistance to Fire, making it more susceptible to Pokemon like Skeledirge and Ceruledge. Tera Ghost prevents Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk from reliably revenge killing Garganacl, letting it use them as setup fodder. It does negate the Ghost resistance provided by Purifying Salt, however, so another switch-in to Dragapult's Shadow Ball should be used.</p> <p>Checks to strong wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Breloom are good teammates; examples include the likes of Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. While Garganacl is given a Ghost resistance from Purifying Salt, it cannot fully check Dragapult and Gholdengo prior to Terastallization, with the latter completely countering it if it uses Covert Cloak. As such, Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire make for great teammates. Pokemon like Corviknight and Scizor appreciate Garganacl checking Fire-types like Ceruledge and Skeledirge. Corviknight is notable in that it also forms a strong defensive core with Garganacl, checking Meowscarada for it. Entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Corviknight are appreciated, as Garganacl is heavily pressured by entry hazards and cannot set up reliably if it is worn down. Frail, offensive Pokemon like Cinderace appreciate chip damage being forced onto their checks and having a strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on. Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Iron Valiant can pave the way for Garganacl to clean late-game, wearing down or significantly pressuring its checks in Gholdengo, Meowscarada, and Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Garganacl eases the Water and Steel matchups thanks to its signature move, Salt Cure. Iron Defense allows Garganacl to set up, tanking super effective physical hits due to its astronomical base 130 Defense, while also boosting the power of Body Press, which helps nail Dark- and Steel-types such as Ting-Lu, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit. Curse is another option that can buff its Attack, boosting the damage of Salt Cure, but it prevents Garganacl from easily stonewalling physical attackers—such as Dragonite and defensive Quaquaval—and also lowers Garganacl's Speed. Salt Cure is a fantastic STAB move, neutering setup sweepers such as Mimikyu, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as it puts them on a timer, which Garganacl can potentially stall out as it sets up or heals via Recover. Purifying Salt is particularly useful, as it allows Garganacl to absorb incoming status moves such as Toxic from Quagsire or Toxapex as well as Will-O-Wisp from Dragapult or Sableye and punish them with Salt Cure. Garganacl is also able to tank Ghost-type STAB moves from the likes of Choice-locked Flutter Mane and Dragapult. Leftovers is the best item to provide passive recovery; however, Heavy-Duty Boots can allow Garganacl to come in without taking entry hazard damage, as entry hazard stacking is extremely common. As an alternative to the given EVs, 52 Defense EVs with an Impish nature let Garganacl potentially overwhelm Choice Band Scizor, Tinkaton, and defensive Quaquaval if used with Iron Defense.</p> <p>Tyranitar is an amazing partner for Garganacl, as it sets sand. Tyranitar can also be used as one of the few special attackers Rock teams have access to to nail physical walls such as Great Tusk with Ice Beam; it is also Rock's best check to Kingambit due to it being able to survive a boosted Sucker Punch and OHKO back with Fire Blast. Choice Scarf Glimmora can take on Grass- and Fighting-types such as Breloom and Iron Valiant that may threaten Garganacl out. Glimmora also has fantastic coverage, being able to take on Steel-types such as Gholdengo with Earth Power and Water-types such as Gastrodon and Quagsire with Energy Ball. Glimmora can also provide Toxic Spikes support thanks to its ability, Toxic Debris, which can help Garganacl further wear down and pressure the opposing Pokemon. Teammates that utilize Air Balloon such as Iron Thorns and Drednaw can switch into powerful Ground-type attacks aimed at Garganacl. Drednaw can also utilize its Water-type STAB move to take out opposing Ground-types such as Iron Treads, Unaware Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Drednaw can also turn the tide against rain Water teams thanks to its ability, Swift Swim. Lycanroc-D is also a really good partner for Garganacl that appreciates its ability to wear down foes so it can clean up late-game. Coalossal is also a good partner that can not only burn foes but also lay down entry hazards. Coalossal can also clear its side of the field as well with Rapid Spin, alleviating chip damage on the team. It also acts as a soft check to Scizor and Meowscarada due to its neutralities and can potentially neuter them with Flame Body.</p>"

Salt Cure heavily chips common Steel- and Water-types such as Heatran, Alomomola, and Ferrothorn while also impairing the longevity of sweepers like Cresselia and opposing Garganacl, making them passive and more easily exploited by teammates. Recover allows Garganacl to check Pokemon like Heatran and Volcarona and increase its sustainability as a sweeper. Tera Water allows Garganacl to check Pokemon like Urshifu-R while providing valuable resistances to other attacks like Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. Additionally, it allows Garganacl to stave off rain attackers such as Mega Swampert and Barraskewda. Alternatively, Tera Fairy lets Garganacl reliably set up in front of Pokemon like Great Tusk and Zamazenta while becoming a sturdy check to Mega Lopunny. Tera Ghost is another option, letting Garganacl stop Sneasler and Mega Medicham in their tracks, but it must be wary of Pursuit from Weavile and Mega Tyranitar after the fact. Teammates who can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from pivots such as Toxapex and Alomomola greatly assist Garganacl in making progress with the combination of entry hazards and Salt Cure, making Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar great allies.

Garganacl can safely set up Stealth Rock against common pivots like Ferrothorn, Alomomola, and Galarian Slowking. Common Defog users like Zapdos, Corviknight, and Moltres can barely threaten Garganacl and take dangerous passive damage from Salt Cure. Other entry hazard removal Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk also dislike Salt Cure as they rely on Leftovers for passive recovery. Protect is crucial for Garganacl for passive recovery from Leftovers and to exacerbate chip damage from Salt Cure. It can also help to scout moves from Choice item users like Tapu Lele and Rillaboom, as well as stalling weather turns against rain and sun teams. However, it is important not to rely on Protect too much to the point where Garganacl can be exploited by opponents. Garganacl has a variety of good Tera types; Tera Water turns the tables versus Pokemon like Urshifu-Rapid-Strike and Mega Scizor and performs better against rain and sun, but leaves it vulernable to opposing Garganacl and Electric-types like Raging Bolt and Tapu Koko. Tera Dragon has most of the advantages of Tera Water in addition to checking Ogerpon-W and Mega Charizard Y, but it makes Garganacl weak to Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Tera Fairy and Tera Ghost both help Garganacl to check Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny. Teammates like Ogerpon-W and Mega Lopunny appreciate Garganacl's ability to threaten Water- and Flying-types. Garganacl also benefits from them dealing with offensive targets like Tapu Lele and opposing Ogerpon-W. Garganacl's main way to gain momentum is via Salt Cure, so foes with Abilities like Regenerator and Poison Heal can nullify its chip damage. It is therefore very helpful to have teammates like Weavile, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko to spam Knock Off or threaten common Regenerator pivots.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Garganacl finds itself as a Stealth Rock setter that fits on balance and stall teams with its ability to force progress through passive damage and maintain entry hazards by annoying popular hazard removal options with Salt Cure. Toxic Debris allows Garganacl to punish weak physical attacks like U-turn from Corviknight and Meloetta, while Earth Eater allows it to check and set up with Iron Defense or Curse on Ground-types like Iron Treads, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, and Water Absorb allows it to check Greninja, Inteleon, and Quaquaval lacking Close Combat. Stealth Rock pairs well with Salt Cure, as Salt Cure heavily chips common hazard removal options like Iron Treads and Corviknight, while Iron Defense and Curse allow Garganacl to act as a bulky cleaner late-game. Protect allows Garganacl to scout the opponent's move, heal with Leftovers, and force more passive damage on foes, while Earthquake and Body Press hit Magic Guard Pokemon like Quaquaval and Heatran that otherwise switch in freely. Garganacl's inability to check common special wallbreakers like Sheer Force Iron Moth and Enamorus-T makes pivots like Regieleki and Slither Wing and physical wallbreakers like Chien-Pao great partners; in return, they appreciate Garganacl's ability to maintain Stealth Rock on the field and annoy their checks like Hisuian Goodra and Corviknight with Salt Cure. Garganacl gets rapidly worn down by entry hazards when carrying Leftovers, making physically defensive hazard removal options like Corviknight and defensive Quaquaval good partners; these Pokemon also check physical wallbreakers that threaten Garganacl like Galarian Zapdos, while it checks the special wallbreakers that threaten them. The aforementioned Magic Guard Quaquaval checks Garganacl lacking Iron Defense + Body Press and can spin away Garganacl's Stealth Rock; Desolate Land Skeledirge can spinblock Quaquaval effectively, making it a good partner for Garganacl.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>With solid defenses and access to reliable recovery, Garganacl can perform well in a utility role or with setup in Iron Defense. Its biggest selling points are its unique move and ability: Salt Cure offers valuable passive damage, synergizing well with its natural bulk, while Purifying Salt provides a useful immunity to status moves such as Spore and Toxic. Garganacl is difficult to break for many Pokemon, but it matches up notably well into Fire-types such as Chi-Yu and Arcanine, Flying-types like Dragonite and Iron Jugulis, and Amoonguss due to Purifying Salt. As one of the best Wide Guard users, Garganacl can block the format's many powerful spread attacks such as Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Chi-Yu's Heat Wave, and Armarouge's Expanding Force. Iron Defense lets Garganacl play as a potent wincon instead, increasing its Defense whilst simultaneously strengthening its offensive presence through Body Press. These sets can be very difficult to take down, though they often rely on using up Terastallization to be most effective. Garganacl's abysmal Speed means it will usually be relegated to moving last. Rock typing also leaves Garganacl with countless weaknesses, including to Water-, Steel-, and Fighting-type moves, meaning common Pokemon such as Palafin, Gholdengo, Iron Bundle, Iron Hands, and Great Tusk all significantly threaten it. Amoonguss is one of the best partners for Garganacl, being helpful against several of the aforementioned threats, while Garganacl checks Fire-types like Chi-Yu in return, with redirection support and healing being especially critical for Iron Defense sets. Garganacl also appreciates teammates that can check Gholdengo, especially if not using Wide Guard, so Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Arcanine, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit are other desirable additions.</p>",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Other defensive Tera types are also usable depending on team needs. For example, Tera Poison still provides a Fighting-type resistance but doesn't gain the Dark-type weakness that Tera Ghost does. This means after Terastallization, Garganacl will still be good against Chi-Yu and gains immunity to Toxic Spikes, at the cost of not losing its Ground-type weakness. Tera Water is another alternative, offering helpful resists against Water-types like Palafin and Steel-types like Gholdengo.</p>",

        "Psychic Terrain Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>Armarouge carves a niche for itself with its powerful STAB moves and passable Speed alongside its unique setup and offensive utility. Endure allows Armarouge to survive any direct attack, and when combined with Weak Armor's speed boost, it can allow Armarouge to turn the tables on faster physical threats like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Baxcalibur, and Garchomp. Expanding Force is Armarouge's most powerful attack in Psychic Terrain and 2HKOed all neutral targets besides the uncommon Blissey. Moreover, with Spikes support or Tera Psychic, it can reliably OHKO the likes of Clodsire and Baxcalibur. Armor Cannon is Armarouge's strongest move outside of Psychic Terrain and complements Expanding Force well, OHKOing Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Corviknight and 2HKOing Hatterene. Calm Mind capitalizes on the switches it forces, allowing it to always OHKO Rotom-W and Volcarona with Expanding Force while often OHKOing Garganacl. Destiny Bond can instead force a trade against threats it cannot OHKO normally, such as Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and bulky threats like Ting-Lu and Dondozo. If Psychic Terrain is not active, Destiny Bond forces Sucker Punch users like Kingambit into a difficult situation, where they must either KO Armarouge next turn and faint or switch out and let Armarouge land a powerful attack for free. Tera Psychic powers up Expanding Force to ludicrous levels, allowing it to 2HKO specially defensive Skeledirge and OHKO Dondozo, physically defensive Garganacl, Clodsire, Garchomp, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur while OHKOing Assault Vest Toxapex after a Calm Mind boost. Focus Sash gives Armarouge space to survive at least one hit from full HP, allowing it to set up a Calm Mind or hit attackers back, and it can punish a contact move without committing to Endure. A Modest nature gives Armarouge the best odds of OHKOing Clodsire, Rotom-W, Walking Wake, and Baxcalibur after chip damage from entry hazards, but a Timid nature helps Armarouge sweep late-game by outpacing Speed-boosting Walking Wake with Protosynthesis active, outpacing +1 Iron Moth, and tying with +1 Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Armarouge is a staple on \"Psychic spam\" teams, which use Psychic Terrain and a litany of powerful setup sweepers to overwhelm opponents at a breakneck pace. Psychic Terrain blocks priority moves, including Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, rendering Armarouge very difficult to revenge kill after a Weak Armor boost. Indeedee is a mandatory teammate to set Psychic Terrain, and it can wear down Dark-types with Dazzling Gleam. Furthermore, its Healing Wish can give a weakened Armarouge or one of its teammates a second chance to sweep. Polteageist is another common Psychic spam threat that can threaten the Dark-types Armarouge struggles against with a Fighting-type Tera Blast; in return, Armarouge can handle Steel-types, which Polteageist would otherwise be forced to Terastallize against. One of Armarouge or Polteageist can also wear down Ting-Lu, allowing the other to break past it and sweep late-game. Entry hazard control is extremely important, especially hazard removal, since Armarouge greatly prefers having Focus Sash active to sweep. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides excellent role compression for these teams, since it provides both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, and it can get Armarouge in safely by activating Eject Pack with Close Combat or Headlong Rush; notably, Armarouge can use Stealth Rock to more easily OHKO Rotom-W, Assault Vest Toxapex, and Clodsire without using up its team's Terastallization. Hatterene can deter opposing entry hazards with Magic Bounce while spreading paralysis with Nuzzle and weakening Dark-types with Dazzling Gleam; it can also use Eject Button to reliably pivot in Armarouge if Psychic Terrain is up. Magic Bounce also deters Taunt users, which can otherwise prevent Armarouge from setting up with Calm Mind and Endure, and Hatterene can also offer Healing Wish support. Lastly, many other setup sweepers can fit well on Psychic Terrain teams to open up a sweep for Armarouge, or to sweep once Armarouge punches holes for them. Volcarona and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur can weaken or eliminate Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon, which Armarouge struggles greatly against, while Armarouge can break past Clodsire and Unaware walls for Volcarona to sweep, and it can deal with Steel-types to assist Baxcalibur.</p>"

Additionally, Ceruludge's immunity to Will-O-Wisp thanks to Flash Fire is a major advantage, making it more consistent against Pokemon like Rotom-W and bulky Volcarona. Bitter Blade offers Ceruledge much-appreciated recovery, letting it maintain longevity and more easily set up. Shadow Sneak is valuable priority, letting Ceruledge pick off threats such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, Iron Valiant, and opposing Ceruledge that have been worn down. Taunt is important for preventing phazing from the likes of Ting-Lu while also preventing Toxapex's Haze. It also prevents status from the likes of Toxapex and Rotom-W, as well as recovery from defensive Pokemon like Clodsire, Toxapex, and Skeledirge. 12 Speed EVs ensure that Ceruledge is able to outspeed defensive Rotom-W, letting it prevent Thunder Wave with Taunt while being able to set up after Terastalization. Tera Bug gives Ceruledge a generally solid defensive typing with few weaknesses that synergizes well with Flash Fire. Additionally, it turns Ceruledge's Ground weakness into a resistance, letting it more easily take on Pokemon like Great Tusk and Tera Ground Volcarona. Meanwhile, Tera Fairy lets Ceruledge withstand hits from the likes of Choice Specs Dragapult and mixed Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Ceruledge fits on various offensive teams as a potent wincon thanks to its combination of Bulk Up and Bitter Blade giving it good longevity. Wallbreakers such as Kingambit, Iron Valiant, and Greninja can break through Pokemon that would otherwise check Ceruledge like Dondozo and Garganacl, letting Ceruledge more easily find opportunities to clean. Pokemon like Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and Breloom appreciate Ceruledge's ability to check Volcarona. In return, these Pokemon can wear down threats like Rotom-W for Ceruledge to take advantage of later. Ceruledge's typing leaves it vulnerable to Dark-type Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Hydreigon. Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Scream Tail make for solid teammates, as they can take a hit from and overwhelm these threats. In return, Ceruledge can act as a much-appreciated check to Pokemon like Iron Moth and Cinderace. Breloom also appreciates Ceruledge's ability to check Fire-types, and in return it can OHKO both Hydreigon and Roaring Moon with Mach Punch.

          "outdated": true,
          "description": "<p>Ceruledge’s access to Swords Dance lets it leverage its powerful STAB combination and great attacking options to function as a threatening wallbreaker. At +2, Ceruledge is capable of OHKOing Corviknight, Amoonguss, bulky Volcarona, and defensive Gholdengo with Bitter Blade. Shadow Sneak serves as a secondary STAB attack, preferred for its priority that lets it heavily damage faster threats like Iron Valiant and Dragapult at +2, OHKOing the latter and making offensive counterplay to Ceruledge harder. Taunt can be run over Shadow Sneak to stop entry hazard setters and sweepers from setting up, giving Ceruledge a chance to break foes with recovery such as Clodsire without the opponent gaining too much progress. Taunt also prevents Ceruledge by being statused by the likes of Clodsire and Rotom-W. Close Combat OHKOs specially defensive Garganacl after a Swords Dance boost while 2HKOing Ting-Lu, physically defensive Garganacl, and Rotom-W, all of which are not threatened by Bitter Blade. Solar Blade threatens Dondozo, Garganacl, Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Great Tusk while sun is active. Focus Sash can ensure that Weak Armor and Swords Dance are activated, allowing Ceruledge to sweep more reliably. Life Orb is an alternative option that makes it possible to OHKO Ting-Lu and 2HKO Great Tusk at +2. Weak Armor couples incredibly well with Focus Sash, and its resistances to types like Bug and Fire, allowing Ceruledge to gain a free Speed boost by switching into U-turn from pivots like Corviknight and Cinderace, as well as Pyro Ball from the latter. Flash Fire lets Ceruledge function as a more reliable switch-in to Fire-types like Iron Moth, while potentially powering up Bitter Blade. Tera Fire provides extra power to Bitter Blade in order to OHKO Amoonguss and 2HKO Tera Steel Toxapex before Swords Dance. Tera Fighting provides Ceruledge with a Dark-resistance, allowing it to take attacks from the likes of Kingambit and Roaring Moon, particularly Sucker Punch from the former, in order to gain a Speed boost from Weak Armor. However, beware of other neutral attacks from such threats, as Choice Band Roaring Moon will still be able to OHKO Ceruledge with Dragon Claw. After a Swords Dance, Tera Fighting gives Close Combat enough extra power to OHKO all Garganacl sets, Ting-Lu, and Rotom-W after Stealth Rock chip. Tera Grass can be used together with Solar Blade in order to 2HKO Dondozo under sun. If running a Jolly nature, Ceruledge can outspeed Gholdengo, as well as Booster Energy Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and +1 Roaring Moon and Adamant Dragapult after a Weak Armor boost. Jolly, however, notably misses out on Adamant’s chance to OHKO Great Tusk and Ting-Lu at +2 with Tera Fighting Close Combat, as well as ensuring a 2HKO against Clodsire with Bitter Blade after Stealth Rock chip.</p> <p>Ceruledge fits best on offensive teams, mainly those that use sun, in addition to some bulky offense teams that can provide it opportunities to enter battle and set up safely. As one of few viable physical Fire-types, Ceruledge has great synergy with Torkoal, which can activate sun to boost Bitter Blade’s power and allow Solar Blade to be used in one turn. Torkoal also sets Stealth Rock, removes hazards with Rapid Spin, and can spread status with Lava Plume and Yawn to allow Ceruledge safe entry. Walking Wake benefits from Ceruledge’s unique coverage on sun teams, as it appreciates foes like Azumarill and Slowking being removed. In return, Walking Wake can pressure foes like Skeledirge and Great Tusk. Great Tusk and Hatterene are also good partners on sun teams, as they can keep entry hazards off the field so that Ceruledge can enter battle safely with its Focus Sash intact. Ceruledge struggles with physical walls like Rotom-W and Great Tusk, as well as Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo. Choice Specs Iron Valiant has coverage for these foes, while Booster Energy variants threaten faster attackers like Roaring Moon and Dragapult. Mixed Garchomp puts pressure on most of Ceruledge’s checks, like Dondozo and Skeledirge, while luring in Corviknight so that Ceruledge can take advantage of its U-turn in order to activate Weak Armor. Corviknight itself is a good partner, as it is able to lure in Cinderace, another Pokemon Ceruledge can take advantage of, and pivot Ceruledge into battle safely. But, it can be a drain on momentum for more offensive teams. Ceruledge works well with hazard setters, as extra chip damage helps Ceruledge break foes like Garganacl and Rotom-W. In return, Ceruledge pressures Corviknight and can spinblock with its Ghost typing, but it doesn’t often do so due to bad matchups against common Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk. Examples of hazard-setting teammates include Great Tusk and Meowscarada, with the former being able to check Dark-types like Kingambit in the event Ceruledge cannot Terastallize, and the latter checking Rotom-W and Great Tusk.</p>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Bulk Up Ceruledge makes excellent use of both its respectable bulk and Bitter Blade's high recovery. By changing its typing to a more defense oriented one, while maintaining the Fire immunity thanks to Flash Fire, Ceruledge can set up Bulk Ups on a variety of common Pokemon, ranging from Corviknight, Kingambit, Azumarill and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt lets Ceruledge set up Bulk Up without needing to fear common phasing moves (with the exception of attacking moves such as Dragon Tail), as well as opposing setup moves such opposing Bulk Up and Iron Defense, provided you outspeed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Sneak</strong> Priority of some form is always nice to have on a Pokemon, which makes Shadow Sneak an easy contender for the last move. Gaining extra added strength against Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Dragapult and Annihilape is certainly charming.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass Tera Blast</strong>: This allows Ceruledge to eliminate Dondozo more quickly. While Taunt can shut down Dondozo's Yawn, it cannot shut down Fissure. The only way to beat Dondozo would be to eliminate it as quickly as possibly, which Grass Tera Blast aids with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flame Charge</strong>: Flame Charge provides Ceruledge an extra net of safety against potential Scarf users and Annihilape, who are capable of turning the tides against it. While normally, Ceruledge is prone to faster Taunt + Bulk Up users and Scarfed Trick, Flame Charge helps mitigate both of those weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Ceruledge can be a status spreader in games where it can't set up as easily. It also helps Ceruledge set up more easily against threats such as Unaware Clodsire.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy helps Ceruledge's matchup against prominent Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: An immunity to Spore and a resistance to Water makes Grass the most notable Tera type for this set. Flash Fire eliminating one of Grass's many weaknesses is also noteworthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Increasing Bitter Blade's power will always be a valuable trait. Eliminating Ghost's weaknesses to Ghost and Dark also allows Ceruledge to set up more comfortably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Tera Bug is similar to Tera Grass, but in exchange for losing the Water resistance and maintaining the Rock weakness of Fire / Ghost, Ceruledge can tank Volcarona's Bug Buzz with significantly more ease.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: Investing into Defense prepares Ceruledge and its mediocre physical bulk for the physical-biased metagame. Bulk Up will boost its Defense, but it can struggle to take some physical hits even after a boost, and its special bulk is naturally high.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: A faster spread helps Ceruledge outspeed other Bulk Up users, like Annihilape opting to invest in bulk. Being faster, more often than not, lets Ceruledge win these matchups with ease.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: While most threats in the metagame at the moment are physical, a specially defensive spread is still noteworthy for its ability to surprise Hydreigon.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With a stellar offensive typing, a unique set of attacks, Weak Armor allowing it to outspeed a large part of the metagame, and its immunity to Extreme Speed and Mach Punch, Ceruledge proves itself to be a very solid Focus Sash option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bitter Blade</strong>: Bitter Blade's recovery can make Focus Sash usable even if entry hazards chip it. If Ceruledge is brought down to 1 HP, a +2 Bitter Blade can heal it to the point that it can tank an extra attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Shadow Claw</strong>: Close Combat hits the Normal-, Dark-, and Rock-types that resist Ceruledge's STAB combination. Still, Shadow Claw is a noteworthy choice to guarantee the KO on Mimikyu and let Ceruledge pressure Skeledirge. Note, however, that maximum Defense Skeledirge can recover more than Shadow Claw's damage, barring critical hits, and a Terastallized Skeledirge can completely wall this set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance versus Destiny Bond</strong>: As powerful as Swords Dance boosted attacks from Ceruledge are, the abundance of Unaware Pokemon, primarily Dondozo, has made some players opt to use Destiny Bond to snag surprise kills. Destiny Bond can also make the matchup against KOing common Sucker Punch Pokemon, such as Meowscarada and Kingambit, easier to win without having to rely on predictions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant's added damage output is valuable, but Jolly allows Ceruledge to outspeed non-Scarf Gholdengo, and gives it a chance at outspeeding Modest Rotom formes and Glimmora. All of the mentioned examples are Special Attackers, meaning Ceruledge's Weak Armor often does not trigger in these matchups.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Giving Bitter Blade an extra push in damage is quite useful, giving Ceruledge more recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Normal is an exceedingly common Tera Type on Ghost types due to the immunity it brings to the table. Ceruledge makes particularly excellent use of Normal Tera by resisting both Steel and Fairy, making it very difficult for Gholdengo and Mimikyu to click anything other than a Ghost type move when facing off against Ceruledge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Giving extra reach pwer to Close Combat, a powerful option against Pokemon such as Hydreigon, makes Fighting a solid choice for a Tera Type.</p> </li> </ul>"

At +2, Bitter Blade and Poltergeist cleave through common defensive staples like Celesteela, Clefable, and Slowbro; the former's healing also makes Ceruledge much harder to KO with residual damage like sand and Toxic as well as some neutral hits such as Iron Hands's Thunder Punch. Shadow Sneak lets Ceruledge take out faster foes that are chipped such as Enamorus and Galarian Zapdos, and at +2 it can even OHKO some Ghost-weak foes like Latios. Close Combat is an alternative, primarily used to OHKO Tyranitar and its Mega forme as well as 2HKO Hydreigon, which resist Ceruledge's STAB attacks. It is also Ceruledge's strongest option against Normal-types, 2HKOing Blissey and Chansey. Weak Armor allows Ceruledge to boost its Speed by taking advantage of physical attackers that can't OHKO it like Iron Hands and Cinderace. Air Balloon allows Ceruledge to soft check foes that rely on Ground-type moves to threaten it like Buzzwole, Excadrill, and Enamorus; against physical attackers, Air Balloon can force them to use a weak attack to pop it granting, Ceruledge a Weak Armor boost. Focus Sash is an alternative, guaranteeing Ceruledge at least one turn of setup and, against physical attackers, one Weak Armor boost. Ghostium Z is another option that provides Ceruledge the power to OHKO Pokemon it otherwise can't, such as Tapu Fini and Iron Hands at +2; it also lets Ceruledge use a powerful Ghost-type move against targets that lack an item, which is situationally useful against certain foes like itemless Slowbro and Booster Energy Iron Moth because Poltergeist does not work on them. Ceruledge fits best on hyper offense teams, which can stack offensive teammates like Iron Hands, Iron Moth, and Thundurus-T to weaken each other's checks. Ceruledge struggles against bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and is notably stonewalled by the rare Quagsire, making Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and certain sweepers like Z-Dragon Dance Salamence and Iron Moth natural partners. Ceruledge dislikes Stealth Rock, especially if it's holding Focus Sash, so it enjoys the support of teammates that can remove entry hazards like Excadrill.</p>"

Shadow Sneak picks off weakened foes like Gholdengo and Iron Boulder and OHKOes frailer targets like Sheer Force Deoxys-S, while Close Combat nails potential Dark-type switch-ins like Roaring Moon. Sword of Ruin offers the most all-around damage amplification, while Desolate Land supercharges Bitter Blade and provides a useful immunity to Water; similarly, Life Orb provides extra power, letting Ceruledge achieve feats like OHKOing Deoxys-D, while Heavy-Duty Boots is useful on teams with weak entry hazard removal. Ceruledge can be overwhelmed by Pokemon like Barraskewda, Ogerpon-W, and Psychic Surge Deoxys-S, making defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Deoxys-D good teammates. Ceruledge's low Speed means that it can easily be outsped by foes, making offensive Pokemon like Choice Scarf Azelf, Dragonite, and Chien-Pao good teammates that help make up for it thanks to their high Speed. Ceruledge's poor defenses and weakness to entry hazards makes slow, hazard-removing pivots like Corviknight and Mandibuzz ideal teammates.

With rain support, Thunder can be used as Kilowattrel's hard-hitting STAB attack to hit Pokemon—such as Toxapex—that Flying teams can struggle to take down. Thunderbolt is a fine substitute on Flying teams that do not utilize rain. Volt Switch allows Kilowattrel to pivot, making use of Kilowattrel's high Speed tier to get off damage while not being Choice locked. Hurricane couples with the preceding moves to cover Kilowattrel's STAB combination, specifically hitting Ground-types such as Quagsire and Gastrodon. The last slot depends on whether rain is being taken advantage of: on rain teams, Weather Ball can be used to hit Ground-types such as Unaware Clodsire, while Air Slash is another option for non-rain teams that can make up for Hurricane's lower accuracy. Choice Specs allows Kilowattrel to hit extremely hard, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Azumarill with Volt Switch and Amoonguss with Hurricane. Volt Absorb provides the only Electric immunity for Flying-type teams.</p> <p>Corviknight is one of Kilowattrel's greatest assets; beyond providing a neutral switch-in to Ice-type attacks—especially in the cases of Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Greninja—Corviknight provides a physical wall that Kilowattrel can pivot into. It is also Flying's most common Defogger, which is essential, as Kilowattrel is susceptible to Stealth Rock damage, hindering its pivoting. Pelipper is very useful in supporting Kilowattrel, as rain support ensures accuracy of Kilowattrel's Thunder and Hurricane, and U-turn on Pelipper ensures safe pivoting. Talonflame is another defensive supporter, covering Kilowattrel's weakness to Ice-types and offering another Defogger. Dragonite hits the specially defensive walls that Kilowattrel struggles with such as Clodsire and Blissey. Gyarados finds great support from Kilowattrel; as Kilowattrel punches holes in defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Toxapex, Gyarados will have a better chance to sweep late-game. While Kilowattrel has excellent Speed itself, Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo and Salamence can revenge kill Pokemon such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane that outspeed Kilowattrel. Bombirdier offers Stealth Rock support and uses Knock Off to remove key items such as Leftovers on Gastrodon, which puts it into 2HKO range of Hurricane after Stealth Rock damage.</p>"

Destiny Bond can remove unsuspecting threats like Scyther as well as setup sweepers like Eelektross, Ursaring, and Jolteon, with Choice Scarf usually letting Mabosstiff act first. Use Destiny Bond carefully, though, as it becomes much easier to play around once it's been revealed. Tera Dark boosts Crunch's power, but Tera Fairy can be used instead to strengthen Play Rough and get rid of Mabosstiff's Fighting and Bug weaknesses. Entry hazard support from Qwilfish and Chansey is very helpful, allowing Mabosstiff to 2HKO walls like Sandaconda on the switch in with Tera Dark Crunch as well as clean with greater ease. Strong wallbreakers like Medicham, Ursaring, and Clawitzer are good at making up for Mabosstiff's low raw damage output.

Play Rough takes out Dark-resistant foes like Paldean Tauros, Umbreon, and Passimian. Psychic Fangs hits Qwilfish and Fighting-types, like Passimian and Toxicroak, with an added niche of breaking screens. Retaliate is difficult to switch into after a teammate has been KOed. Facade can keep a statused Mabosstiff useable. Tera Dark boosts Crunch's damage output while Tera Fairy powers up Play Rough and grants a resistance to U-Turn and Fighting moves from Passimian. Offensive checks to Mabosstiff, like Scyther and Choice Scarf Passimian, can often gain momentum by forcing it out, so teammates with a Rocky Helmet like Sandaconda and especially Poison Point Qwilfish are helpful.

At 18 Speed it outspeeds most of the metagame and can cripple foes by removing their Eviolite or Oran Berry. A fast U-turn also lets it pivot on most unboosted Pokemon while forcing some chip damage on key enemies like Gothita and Dark-types like Alolan Grimer to bring a setup sweeper in, while Prankster Parting Shot allows Shroodle to retain momentum in a fast-paced metagame by shutting down potential non Dark-type offensive threats.  Shroodle also excels in an offensive metagame full of setup sweepers, shutting down setup Pokemon  such as Shellder, Crabrawler, and Numel with Encore.  Copycat can be used over Gunk Shot in some situational cases, such as to copy moves like Memento, Stealth Rock, and even damaging moves to potentially revenge kill opponents. Dark-type is the prefered Tera type for its potential to make Shroodle's utility even better. Tera Dark removes the weakness to Psychic and to Gothita's ability to trap and revenge kill it, allowing it to beat Gothita and Unburden Drifloon with STAB Knock Off.</p> <p>Shroodle is incredibly versatile with its utility, ability to absorb Toxic Spikes, and resistance to Grass. It pairs well with Hisuian Voltorb, Grookey, Hisuian Zorua, and other offensive pivots to pressure teams with VoltTurn spamming while also fitting on offensive structures to safely bring setup sweepers in with Prankster Parting Shot. Grookey can also act as a lure from team preview for opponents who might play around this set with the terrain sweeper set in mind. Shroodle's lack of bulk makes it quite frail, making it hard to switch in sometimes and easy to revenge kill by trapper Gothita and opposing priority users. Shroodle also gets shut down by Dark-types as well as opposing setup sweepers that can Terastalize into the Dark typing such as Swords Dance Pawniard, Shellder, and Numel.</p>"

Leaf Storm OHKOes foes like Great Tusk, Greninja, and Rotom-W while hitting Ting-Lu for a good amount as well. Rapid Spin is useful because Toedscruel is faster than every Stealth Rock setter in the tier besides Garchomp and Iron Treads, letting it switch in late-game to clear entry hazards if needed. Earth Power is an alternative over both moves, as it hits Clodsire, Torkoal, Kingambit, Iron Moth, and Glimmora while also chipping Dragapult. The combination of Earth Power and Rapid Spin allows Toedscruel to be a great lead into Glimmora, as it can use Earth Power to take Glimmora down to its Focus Sash, then Rapid Spin to remove the entry hazards that were set. Both of its STAB moves hit Garganacl quite hard, another common Stealth Rock setter, which hyper offense teams appreciate being scared out. Another great application of this combination is against spin blockers such as Ceruledge, Skeledirge and Gholdengo, which are all threatened to Tera or switch out by Earth Power, letting Toedscruel Rapid Spin. Tera Ghost allows Toedscruel to block Rapid Spin against Iron Treads and Great Tusk in a pinch.</p> <p>Lead Toedscruel is only seen on hyper offense teams, as it guarantees a critical layer of Spikes or a slept foe, regardless of abilities such as Good as Gold, Purifying Salt, and Magic Bounce, assisting in the late-game; the former is helpful for damage rolls and breaking Focus Sash, while the latter gives setup sweepers free turns. With that in mind, great partners include setup sweepers like Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit, the latter of which also appreciates Toedscruel fainting early-game, giving it a Supreme Overlord boost. Some threats to this set include Meowscarada, which is incredibly annoying because Taunt shuts down Toedscruel's entry hazards and Spore, and it cannot punish this, as it resists both Leaf Storm and Earth Power. Kingambit is a great choice for dealing with Meowscarada, as it resists Leaf Storm and Knock off and can threaten it with a powerful Low Kick or Iron Head without fear of Taunt. Hydreigon is also quite troublesome; its resistance to Leaf Storm and immunity to Earth Power allows it to set up a Substitute without fear of being put to sleep due to Mycelium Might causing Spore to move second. Dragapult serves as a great teammate, as it can threaten Hydreigon behind Substitute. Choice Band Dragapult is bothersome, as it OHKOes Toedscruel with Dragon Darts, but it is easily taken advantage of by Fairy-types like Azumarill and Iron Valiant if it OHKOes Toedscruel. Gholdengo is also a fantastic teammate, as it blocks attempts to clear Toedscruels's entry hazards and takes advantage of Spore by setting up with Nasty Plot.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Klawf is an amazing defensive wall, offering utility through Stealth Rock and Knock Off, being very hard to wear down thanks to Regenerator, and using it's solid bulk and typing to check common threats such as Skuntank and Charizard. When compared to other Rock-type walls like Carbink and Hisuian Avalugg, which offer higher bulk and hazard control like Spikes and Rapid Spin, Klawf's Knock Off, Regenerator, and overall versatility are what make it the preferred option on many teams. Furthermore, Klawf's Regenerator and Heavy-Duty Boots give it more longevity than other Knock Off users like Tinkatuff and Thwackey. Klawf's STAB move of choice isn't overly important and can be chosen between Stone Edge for more power and Rock Slide for more reliability. Swords Dance helps with the lack of Attack investment and makes Klawf a larger offensive threat. High Horsepower provides coverage for Steel-types like Perrserker and Tinkatuff and various other targets like Skuntank and Raichu. Klawf's naturally high Defense allows it to invest into Special Defense, making it a mixed wall and improving its ability to check special threats like Pyroar and Haunter. 232 HP EVs maximize Klawf's recovery from Regenerator while lessening damage from Skuntank and Electrode's Aftermath and hazards if Heavy-Duty Boots is removed. 56 Speed EVs alongside Jolly nature allow Klawf to outspeed 252 Speed Cacturne and uninvested Lumineon. That being said, Klawf's EV spread and nature are very flexible, and you can choose to invest into Defense to make it a dedicated physical wall, running Careful nature to further improve its special bulk while still outspeeding Tinkatuff and max Speed Perrserker, or go down a more offensive route with max Attack. Dragon is Klawf's preferred Tera type, losing its weaknesses to Water- and Grass types like Basculin and Thwackey while being a great defensive typing overall. But its Tera type is also flexible, such as Tera Ground for a Volt Switch immunity and STAB High Horsepower, Tera Ghost to spinblock and gain a Fighting immunity, and Tera Flying to gain resistance to moves like like Alolan Dugtrio's Earthquake, Cacturne's Giga Drain, and Charizard's Focus Blast.</p> <p>Klawf's utility and versatility make it viable on virtually any archetype. With Klawf being the best Knock Off user in a metagame full of Heavy Duty-Boots users and not much of hazard removal, it pairs greatly with other hazard setters. Spikes Whiscash is a common partner for Klawf because of this while also forming a great defensive core with Klawf to check threats like Perrserker and Gabite. Swalot, Mareanie, and Skuntank can set Toxic Spikes to slowly stall foes out while checking Grass-types like Gogoat and offering other utility like Toxic, Encore, Taunt, and Haze. Mareanie is also notable, since it forms a Regenerator core with Klawf. Finally, in terms of hazards, Knock Off paired with Masquerain's Sticky Web makes it easier for setup sweepers like double dance Wyrdeer and Nasty Plot Haunter to sweep. Fast teammates like Pyroar, support Alolan Persian, and the previously mentioned setup sweepers also appreciate Knock Off removing any Choice Scarfs, making them harder to revenge kill. The former two also offer support with Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Thunder Wave. Alolan Persian's Parting Shot and other pivots like Rotom-F and Electrode give Klawf more opportunities to come in and switch out to activate Regenerator. Grass-types like Gogoat and Leafeon check Water-types like Basculin and Golduck, while Klawf checks Flying- and Fire-types like Charizard and Pyroar for them. Leafeon's Wish also improves Klawf's longevity, as do other clerics like Heal Bell Chansey and Wish Komala.</p>"

Using Anger Shell and the spread 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can turn Klawf into a more immediately threatening sweeper even if it doesn’t manually boost, but this limits its longevity and consistency.</p> <p>Sample set.

Growth is run for Scovillain to boost its damage output while under sun, letting it secure KOs more easily. Giga Drain threatens Pokemon like Ting-Lu, allowing Scovillain's teammates to break through them late-game, and it also aids in improving Scovillain's longevity by recovering its HP. Fire Blast can be used to have a chance of 2HKOing Skeledirge and Clodsire under sun, but Flamethrower is the preferred Fire-type STAB move, since its accuracy is higher than Fire Blast's. Stomping Tantrum hits opposing Fire-types such as Iron Moth. Solar Beam is an alternative to Stomping Tantrum, OHKOing the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Toxapex after Growth in sun. Life Orb and 32 Attack EVs maximize Scovillain's power, letting it 2HKO specially defensive Clodsire with Stomping Tantrum after Stealth Rock damage. If opting for Solar Beam, the remaining EVs go into HP. A Naive nature allows Scovillain to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Great Tusk and Iron Moth under sun while not losing out on Stomping Tantrum damage.</p> <p>Torkoal is a mandatory partner for Scovillain, as its ability to set up sun allows Scovillain to outspeed many faster threats like Iron Treads, Iron Jugulis, and Quaquaval, dealing heavy chip damage or outright KOing them. Scovillain appreciates Torkoal getting rid of entry hazards; in return, Scovillain deals with Water- and Ground-types like Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Sandy Shocks. Paldean Tauros-F is a great offensive partner for Scovillain, granting benefits such as breaking dual screens from Pokemon like Klefki and Grimmsnarl, which impede Scovillain's sweeping ability. Paldean Tauros-F is also able to check specially defensive walls like Blissey; in return, Scovillain breaks past bulky Water-types like Slowking and Toxapex after one Growth under sun. Cinderace can offer alternate entry hazard removal with Court Change, which helps Scovillain's longevity. Furthermore, Cinderace's Speed tier allows it to handle offensive Pokemon that naturally outpace Scovillain outside of sun like Hydreigon and Iron Treads, the former of which Scovillain cannot hit neutrally. Scovillain also appreciates Volcarona as an offensive partner thanks to its non-weather-reliant sweeping potential in Quiver Dance, dealing with Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Garchomp, while Scovillain can weaken Volcarona's checks like Ting-Lu, Unaware Clodsire, and Toxapex throughout the course of the game.</p>"

It's notably also strong enough to score a 2HKO on physically defensive Toxapex after minimal chip damage, allowing Scovillain to beat Poison teams if it hits every move. Alternatively, Overheat has better accuracy and still 2HKOes Skeledirge and Clodsire, but the Special Attack drop makes it less spammable. Giga Drain threatens a 2HKO on Pelipper, which may be tempted to come into Scovillain to block Solar Beam, and also provides Scovillain a form of recovery. A Timid nature lets it outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Gengar and Protosynthesis-boosted Choice Specs Walking Wake to burn them to a crisp, while a Modest nature has better odds of 2HKOing Toxapex with Giga Drain and OHKOing Baxcalibur with Flamethrower at the cost of outspeeding only up to non-Speed boosting Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks.</p> <p>Torkoal is a mandatory teammate, as it sets sun, which Scovillain needs to boost its Speed with Chlorophyll, and provides entry hazard support with its ability to set Stealth Rock and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Other forms of entry hazard support in Defog Talonflame and Court Change Cinderace are also appreciated; they also have access to U-turn, which allows Scovillain to get in more times to wallbreak. Ceruledge packs Shadow Sneak to deal with Flutter Mane, which otherwise outspeeds and dispatches Scovillain with ease. In return, Scovillain obliterates bulky Unaware walls like Quagsire, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, all of which hinder Swords Dance Ceruledge from cutting down Water and Ghost teams. Similarly, Volcarona and Iron Moth love Scovillain's ability to eliminate bulky walls like Clodsire and Ting-Lu, allowing them to clean up Poison and Ground teams late-game. Skeledirge deals with Kingambit and Choice Scarf Meowscarada, which threaten Scovillain with priority or by outspeeding it and picking it off.</p>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>The metagame's abundance of Unaware Pokemon makes it difficult to maneuver Moody Pokemon in general. On top of that, Scovillain is held back by the powerful Dragon-types that resist its STAB combination. However, Scovillain still carves a niche for itself by being the only Moody Pokemon with excellent recovery moves, Leech Seed and Ingrain, allowing it to win a variety of matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect and Substitute</strong>: Protect and Substitute are mandatory to get the most opportunities to activate Moody. Once you gain enough Defense or Special Defense boosts that Scovillain's Substitute can tank an attack without breaking, it tends to be easy to win the game. Note, however, that Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers's animation make Scovillain very vulnerable to losing via timer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: With enough Moody boosts, Scovillain's Flamethrower tends to be enough to break through an entire team. There are very few Pokemon that are immune or quadruply resistant to Fire, and Flamethrower has good PP and accuracy, which makes it an easy pick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: Unlike Flamethrower, Giga Drain gets shrugged off by a lot of Pokemon, even at +6, notably Corviknight and Dragonite. However, an attacking move that helps recover HP lost from Substitutes gives Scovillain more mileage off of Moody. Giga Drain is also notable to more reliably defeat Dondozo, one of the Unaware Pokemon that would give Scovillain a lot of trouble otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leech Seed</strong>: Leech Seed combined with Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers helps Scovillain restore HP while collecting Moody boosts, as well as chipping Pokemon it'd otherwise have trouble against, such as Clodsire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain</strong>: Ingrain is an alternative recovery option that makes Scovillain impervious to phazing moves. When purely considering recovery, it's more reliable than the inaccurate 90% accurate Leech Seed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast with Tera Fairy is an excellent option that helps remedy Scovillain's Dragon susceptibility, particularly making the Infiltrator Dragapult and Roaring Moon matchup easier.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: The Water resistance helps Scovillain beat Dondozo. Even though Dondozo ignores Scovillain's Defense boosts via Unaware, with Tera Water, Scovillain's Substitute can tank a Wave Crash. Tera Water also keeps the Scovillain's Steel resistance, unlike Tera Grass, which makes it easier to check Scizor—a common priority user that people attempt to use to check Moody Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy mitigating Scovillain's weakness to Dragon-types is massively helpful.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>180 HP / 220 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 100 Spe with Bold</strong>: This spread bolsters Scovillain’s physical bulk. Notably, Tera Water Scovillain's Substitute manages to survive Dondozo's Wave Crash with this spread. The Speed allows Scovillain to outspeed slow Baxcalibur and Gholdengo, as well as Dragapult with one Moody Speed boost. The HP is adjusted to make maximum use of Leftovers, with the resulting stat having a remainder of 1 when divided by 16. The remaining EVs are split between Special Attack and Special Defense because, at level 50, investing 8 EVs in either stat has no benefit over investing 4.</li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Rabsca is a fearsome, albeit relatively niche, late-game sweeper that makes use of Trick Room, healthy Special Attack, and good coverage to perform cleaning and wallbreaking duties. Psyshock takes precedence over Psychic, as it allows Rabsca to pressure specially defensive foes like Articuno and setup sweepers like Calm Mind Misdreavus; it also lets Rabsca deal considerably more damage to Crabominable. Earth Power deals considerable damage to Skuntank, Pyroar, Alolan Dugtrio, and Tinkatuff and complements Psyshock by pressuring targets like Iron Defense Carbink. Bug Buzz is Rabsca's best move to pressure foes like Gogoat and Alolan Persian. Recover allows Rabsca to mitigate entry hazard chip damage as well as to play a more active role during early-game as a switch-in to targets like Indeedee-F and Raichu, although forgoing Bug Buzz notably leaves it unable to hit Honchkrow and limits its ability to check Gogoat. Life Orb greatly increases Rabsca's damage output, notably allowing it to OHKO targets like Skuntank and Crabominable before Terastallizing, as well as 2HKO specially defensive Articuno after slight chip damage. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used for easier setup and more reliable checking of targets, like Carbink, should Rabsca choose to run Recover, but it usually prefers the increased damage output. Tera Ground and Tera Bug can be used to boost Earth Power and Bug Buzz's damage output, respectively; they also notably ease its ability to set up on Misdreavus, which otherwise threatens it with Shadow Ball or Hex, as well as prevent Skuntank and Honchkrow's Sucker Punch from prematurely ending its sweep. Tera Psychic is less reliable, as it limits Rabsca's setup opportunities, but it is otherwise effective for beating Articuno. A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs allow Rabsca to outspeed the entire metagame, aside from other dedicated Trick Room attackers like Crabominable and Camerupt, while Trick Room is active.</p> <p>Rabsca works best as a late-game sweeper, making it a good fit on offensive teams that can wear opposing Pokemon down throughout the match and take care of Pokemon like Misdreavus and Alolan Persian that can make Rabsca's job of setting up with Trick Room difficult. Pivots like Alolan Persian, Rotom-F, and Articuno can create safe switch-in opportunities for Rabsca if it is needed to check a target early-game or set up late-game. Bulky Alolan Persian can switch into Pokemon that threaten Rabsca out like Lycanroc-N, and it appreciates Rabsca pressuring foes like Dachsbun and Tinkatuff for it. Rotom-F and Articuno appreciate Recover variants of Rabsca, which are able to check Carbink, and in return, they can pressure threats like Masquerain and Misdreavus for it. Raichu, as well as Tinkatuff, can create setup opportunities for Rabsca with Encore; the latter is especially notable for making Rabsca's late-game cleaning easier by accelerating the opposing team being worn down by hazards with Knock Off. Indeedee-F can form an efficient Psychic-type core with Rabsca, and it notably gives Life Orb variants optimal entry with Healing Wish as well as boosting Psyshock and blocking priority from Pokemon like Skuntank and Basculin with Psychic Terrain. Crabominable greatly appreciates Recover variants' ability to check Carbink, and it can make use of leftover Trick Room turns to wallbreak. Hazard removers like Dartrix and Quaxwell can ease Life Orb variants' task of setting up late-game without relying on recovery.</p>"

Stored Power's base power quickly raises with the combination of Speed Boost and Calm Mind, reaching astronomical levels that can break through foes which resist it like Corviknight, Hatterene, and Gholdengo. With enough boosts, Stored Power is powerful enough to break through Unaware walls like Skeledirge, Dondozo and Clodsire. Dazzling Gleam complements Stored Power well, as it can beat Dark-types which would otherwise wall Espathra such as Sableye, Meowscarada, and Greninja. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Espathra ignore entry hazards when switching in and couples well with Roost to increase Espathra's longevity, letting it set up easily. Alternatively, Leftovers in conjunction with Substitute and Roost or Protect lets Espathra safely get Speed boosts while also being able to scout foes' moves. 56 Speed EVs let Espathra outspeed Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gallade and Hoopa-U at +1 Speed, while the rest are placed into HP and Defense, giving Espathra enough bulk to set up with ease against physical attackers such as Garchomp, Great Tusk and Corviknight.</p> <p>Espathra appreciates teammates that can accentuate its offensive prowess. Scream Tail can set dual screens and paralyze opponents with Thunder Wave to make setting up easie while also setting Stealth Rock and can even Wish pass to Espathra. Gallade, along with Scream Tail with the set of Substitute, Bulk Up, Drain Punch and Play Rough can also punish Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Kingambit.

Indeedee is a Ghost-type switch-in and sets up Psychic Terrain for Espathra, protecting it from priority attacks like Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch. Indeedee is also able to Healing Wish to give Espathra a second chance to sweep. Stored Power Armarouge forms a dangerous core with Espathra, which can break for Espathra, clean after it, and also beat Steel teams. Hatterene bounces back entry hazards for Espathra if it forgoes Heavy-Duty Boots while also beating Dark- and Dragon-types.

Tinkatuff's abilities as a Stealth Rock setter are complemented by Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots of common switch-ins to it like Charizard and Pyroar, greatly hindering their longevity. Knock Off can also cripple the most common hazard removers, Dartrix and Quaxwell, both of which greatly rely on their Eviolite. Encore is used to halt setup sweepers like Gogoat, Carbink, and Masquerain, letting a teammate threaten them out. Rest can also be run to ensure that Tinkatuff is a long-term switch-in to Pokemon like Indeedee-F, Alolan Persian, and Skuntank; however, this forces Tinkatuff to remain immobile for multiple turns, compounding its issues with passivity. Mold Breaker is used for two niche applications: removing items from Sticky Hold Swalot and paralyzing a Terastallized Raichu with Thunder Wave.

          "description": "<p>Tinkaton is a solid Pokemon in UU thanks to its amazing typing, good bulk, and coveted utility movepool. It’s a good Stealth Rock setter due to its typing letting it set up on Tyranitar, Grafaiai, and Scream Tail. Knock Off removes crucial items such as Talonflame's Heavy-Duty Boots and Bisharp's Eviolite. Encore shuts down setup sweepers such as Quiver Dance Oricorio-E and can lock Quagsire and Gastrodon into Toxic, Ice Beam, and Recover. Thunder Wave can catch Talonflame attempting to switch into it to clear Stealth Rock, but Encore is more consistent overall. Mold Breaker lets Tinkaton ignore Mimikyu's Disguise, letting it force progress on offensive teams. Tera Dark allows Tinkaton to better check Gengar while giving Knock Off a boost. Tera Ghost turns Tinkaton into an emergency check to Slither Wing and Lucario while also spinblocking against Tatsugiri. However, it's not recommended to use since it makes it weak to Pokemon that it is supposed to check such as Gengar and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Utility Tinkaton fits on every single playstyle except hyper offense thanks to its good typing and movepool. Spikes users like Quagsire and Gastrodon can form entry hazard stack cores with Tinkaton while also handling Pawmot, Quaquaval, Scizor, and non-Tera Grass Sandy Shocks. Quagsire is able to spread Toxic against hazard removers such as Defog Talonflame and Donphan, while Tinkaton can use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from Salamence and Wo-Chien to wear down foes further. Gengar is a fantastic partner, since Tinkaton is able to handle opposing Gengar and Grafaiai for it and remove Gastrodon's Heavy-Duty Boots. This helps Gengar break down Gastrodon more easily without having to use Energy Ball. Hippowdon appreciates Tinkaton running Stealth Rock and checking Decideueye, allowing it to run both Stone Edge and Roar. In return, it checks Pokemon that take advantage of Tinkaton, such as Sandy Shocks and Iron Jugulis.</p>"

With Mold Breaker ignoring Multiscale, fully invested Adamant Tera Fairy Play Rough almost always OHKOs offensive Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground thwarts Volt Switch pivoting, potentially giving Tinkaton extra turns to set up for itself or teammates.

Knock Off is helpful for keeping Stealth Rock up, punishing Hattrem and Defoggers like Drifblim, Scyther, and Oricorio-F, in addition to pressuring walls like Umbreon and Eelektross. Parting Shot is an alternative to U-turn that gives frailer teammates an easier time switching in, which can be extremely useful on offense teams, though it doesn't deal any damage and unfortunately activates Passimian's Defiant and Lurantis's Contrary. With 72 Speed EVs, Bombirdier outruns and usually beats Modest Clawitzer one-on-one. The Speed investment also allows Bombirdier to outspeed Cacturne and defensive Qwilfish. Tera Ground lets Bombirdier block Volt Switch from Rotom and resist Haunter's Sludge Bomb, which can translate to a surprise OHKO against both foes.</p> <p>Electric-types like Eelektross, Rotom, and Jolteon are among the biggest threats to Bombirdier and should be accounted for when using it. Grass-types like Appletun and Lurantis are very sturdy checks to such Pokemon, while Ground-types like Sandaconda can block Volt Switch. Fighting-types like Toxicroak and Paldean Tauros can easily set up on Bombirdier, so it appreciates having partners like Sandaconda, Drifblim, and Bruxish that can check them. In return, Bombirdier scares out Grass- and Dark-types like Lurantis and Cacturne. Some Pokemon that Bombirdier can check like Mabosstiff, Farigiraf, and Indeedee-F pack super effective coverage for it, so backup checks to them like Qwilfish, Muk, and Chansey are important to have. Additional pivots, such as Passimian and Eelektross, help maintain momentum alongside Bombirdier and love having their switch-ins worn down by Knock Off and Stealth Rock.</p>"

        "Dedicated Lead": {
          "description": "<p>Bombirdier is a great dedicated entry hazard lead due to the incredibly deep utility movepool. Stealth Rock and Taunt are a classic staple for any dedicated lead, quickly setting up hazards while preventing the opponent from removing them or setting up their own. Bombirdier makes great use of its STAB Knock Off to deal a decent chunk of damage before going down while also hindering the longevity of the many Flying-type Defog users like Braviary, Drifblim, and Scyther by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Memento is an amazing move for Bombirdier, facilitating the hyper offensive teams it's commonly found on. Memento can block an incoming Defog, but its main purpose is to allow for easy setup of an ally like Lilligant or Hisuian Sneasel against a weakened foe. Rock Blast allows Bombirdier to get the edge on opposing dedicated leads like Bombirdier and Froslass, breaking their Focus Sash and potentially OHKOing them. Tera Ghost simply blocks Rapid Spin, namely from the likes of Cryogonal and Avalugg, both of which also greatly dislike having their Heavy-Duty Boots removed and taking powerful Rock-type attacks. Tera Ground lets Bombirdier potentially block an Electric-type attack; OHKOing Rotom with Knock Off or heavily damaging Eelektross could be crucial for Bombirdier's teammates, but as a dedicated lead, Bombirdier will not be Terastallizing often because it is best reserved for its offensive teammates.</p> <p>As mentioned, Bombirdier is often relegated to hyper offensive teams, which make the most use out of the hazards and momentum generated by it. Fast setup sweepers like Lilligant, Hisuian Sneasel, and Vivillon all greatly appreciate both the entry hazard support and the setup opportunity granted through Memento. Bombirdier can be coupled with a dedicated Froslass lead, which can set Spikes and double up the entry hazards and support for the team, although Froslass is also direct competition for Bombirdier's role. Faster Taunt users like Pyroar and Qwilfish can shut down Bombirdier but must be wary of Bombirdier's attacks. Bombirdier is often dealt with by physical walls like Sandaconda and Qwilfish; using Knock Off to remove their Rocky Helmet and weaken them greatly assists physical sweepers like Hisuian Sneasel, Scyther, and Tauros.</p>"

        "Choice Item": {
          "description": "<p>Bombirdier makes good use of Choice Scarf and Choice Band thanks to its great speed and access to pivoting moves. U-turn breaks Focus Sash and deals some damage, while Parting Shot lets other offensive teammates hit the field more comfortably and avoids contact with the opposing Pokemon. Bombirdier has access to some of the best offensive STAB moves in the game, with the highly coveted Knock Off, high-Base Power Brave Bird, and Rocky Payload-boosted Rock-type moves.</p> <p>Other useful options would be to use Stone Edge as a Rock-type pseudo-STAB attack; it has more power than Rock Blast but comes with more risk due to its lower accuracy. Additionally, Memento is an option over Parting Shot, which would further weaken an enemy to allow for a safer setup turn with a sweeper like Dudunsparce or Veluza. With this set, the Tera Dark is recommended to increase the damage of Knock Off; Tera Rock can also be considered, but most of the time, if you want to deal damage, Knock Off is more reliable. Brave Bird, the second STAB move, is another spammable option that helps Bombirdier deal with Fighting-type Pokemon that can take Dark and Rock moves, like Paldean Tauros and Toxicroak. With Choice Band, Bombirdier can deal some real damage off its great Attack stat.</p> <p>As for teammates, we have some options. Sandaconda its a good option because of its Electric immunity, and Parting Shot can help it boost up safety. Setup sweepers like Bruxish, Lilligant, and Farigiraf greatly benefit from Bombirdier's Parting Shot and Knock Off weakening the opposition. To continue the pivot partners, Scyther and Choice Scarf Rotom make a solid VoltTurn core with Bombirdier. Due to its Stealth Rock weakness, Bombirdier appreciates entry hazard removal from Braviary and Cryogonal.</p>"

It's possible to drop if coverage is desperately needed, but forcing Palafin to switch and losing out on a useful pivot move is not the right call in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch is Palafin-H's best bet against Dragonite before it Terastallizes, and deals decent damage to Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Drain Punch</strong>: Close Combat is good coverage, hitting Rotom-W for neutral damage and covering Baxcalibur, Iron Bundle, and Roaring Moon. While weaker, Drain Punch's lack of defensive stat drops makes sense for a better matchup against Focus Sash Chien-Pao and restoring a good amount of health against Iron Bundle before usually KOing it with Jet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: An Adamant nature increases the damage Wave Crash and Jet Punch inflict, making Palafin-H a more effective wall breaker and revenge killer.

However, it does make Palafin-H particularly vulnerable to Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water helps Palafin-H pick off more threats with Jet Punch, having a good shot to OHKO offensive Flutter Mane unboosted after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Besides offering a useful Fairy resistance, Tera Poison lets Palafin-H absorb Toxic Spikes and stop Toxic without a support move, making it a viable alternative.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers takes advantage of Palafin-H's slow setup and is a requirement if using Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove</strong>: If using Taunt, Punching Glove is a good option to free up Leftovers for a teammate. Palafin-H appreciates the extra power Jet Punch and Drain Punch gain, and it becomes harder for Rocky Helmet Dragonite to wear it down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If using Taunt, Covert Cloak turns the tables on the Garganacl matchup in addition to protecting Palafin-H from surprise Light Ball Flings from foes like Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 140 SpD / 116 Spe with Careful</strong>: This spread maximizes Palafin-H's Special Defense while still outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximizing Speed allows Palafin-H to outspeed fast support Pokemon like Mimikyu and Annihilape so it can Taunt them. This spread also outspeeds the rare Choice Specs Hydreigon, which can deal massive damage with Draco Meteor if not using Tera Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 140 Atk / 116 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This is a far more offensive approach to the set, letting Palafin-H function more as a revenge killer with the potential to sweep rather than a bulky setup Pokemon. This is best used with Tera Water, as Palafin-H will then OHKO offensive Flutter Mane with unboosted Jet Punch. The given Speed is for outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> </ul>"

Even with its strong coverage moves, Palafin struggles mightily against opposing Desolate Land, so reliable switch-ins like Well-Baked Body Slither Wing are strongly recommended. Palafin struggles against Dondozo, making teammates that can punish it like Meowscarada and Spikes Garchomp good additions.</p>"

Jet Punch circumvents common speed control and is threatening against the frailer metagame, notably OHKOing Chi-Yu and Landorus at +1. Drain Punch is a reliable means of recovery in addition to Leftovers while also hitting popular Dark-types like Kingambit and Chien-Pao, as well as common Water-resistant or immune foes such as Rillaboom and Volcanion harder. Tera Grass provides an immunity to Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, as well as resistances to Grass- and Electric-type attacks such as Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Iron Hands's Wild Charge, which would otherwise OHKO Palafin. Palafin's base forme has poor damage output and bulk, so it is often ideal for it to lead and pivot out immediately to activate Zero to Hero. This is so crucial to Palafin's functioning that it is very telegraphed and easily exploitable with powerful attacks directed at it. To cover for this, Palafin may lead together with a Fake Out user or a redirector to reduce incoming damage. Bulk Up Palafin pairs well with partners that can remove Psychic Terrain, use Fake Out to generate free turns for Palafin to set up, and extend Palafin's longevity. Rillaboom fulfills all of these roles, with Grassy Terrain granting additional passive recovery. Cresselia is another good partner, as its Lunar Blessing heals Palafin and cures burn and poison, which would otherwise severely limit Palafin's offensive output or the turns it can stay on field. Amoonguss's Rage Powder redirects threatening attacks such as Iron Hands's Wild Charge, removes Toxic Spikes that reduce Palafin's longevity, and provides a major source of recovery for Palafin with Pollen Puff. Iron Hands is a Fake Out user whose Electric-type attacks eliminate opposing Water-types that resist Jet Punch. Grimmsnarl can also increase Palafin's bulk and create setup opportunities with its dual screens. As Amoonguss effortlessly walls Palafin and undoes its progress with Clear Smog, Palafin requires partners that deal with it effectively, like Heatran, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p>"

Mortal Spin's poison wears down entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and Hatterene looking to bounce back Stealth Rock over time. Steel-types like Iron Treads, Heatran, and Gholdengo can block Mortal Spin, so Earth Power is great, as it punishes these for switching into it; however, Stealth Rock is usually the better option, as it helps Poison teams wear down opposing teams more quickly. For similar reasons, Toxic is great for putting Steel-types, notably Corviknight, on a timer, and it also eases the Poison matchup, as Glimmora outspeeds and can inflict Toxic on the aforementioned walls before it faints. Power Gem prevents Glimmora from being too passive and lets it threaten non-Glaive Rush Baxcalibur if its Air Balloon is intact and Substitute + Bulk Up Corviknight. Energy Ball lets Glimmora threaten Water-types like Quagsire, which normally threatens it out. Maximum Special Attack and Speed boost Glimmora's offensive presence, allowing it to outspeed and possibly win against Gholdengo one-on-one with Earth Power. Air Balloon further increases Glimmora's utility, as it lets Gholdengo double as a switch-in to Choice-locked threats such as Great Tusk and Iron Jugulis, which tend to lock into a Ground-type move against Poison. Alternatively, Black Sludge along with a more defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 212 Def / 44 Spe and a Bold nature improves Glimmora's longevity, notably allowing it to survive a +2 Crunch from Chien-Pao and outspeed and inflict Toxic on Jolly Kingambit. If this is desired, Spiky Shield is a better option over Stealth Rock to further rack up recovery.</p> <p>As Glimmora's typing is horrible into types such as Water and Ground, Toxapex and Amoonguss are great partners, as both sponge hits from threats such as Barraskewda, Quagsire, and non-Choice Band Great Tusk with ease. Furthermore, these Pokemon allow Glimmora's Toxic to do its job and take out Bulk Up Corviknight, opposing Amoonguss, and Clodsire by completely walling them. Amoonguss in particular is great into Ground-types like Landorus-T, which Glimmora can't do much against. Alolan Muk provides a Psychic-type immunity and is an extremely bulky special wall that helps against Choice Specs Dragapult, Hatterene, and Flutter Mane. It also provides Knock Off support, which leaves walls such as Toxapex to be vulnerable to Glimmora's entry hazards. Clodsire provides Spikes, checks other special attackers such as Quiver Dance Volcarona, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Regieleki. Alternatively, Overqwil may also be considered as Glimmora's entry hazard stacking partner, as it can deal with Iron Valiant and Belly Drum Azumarill. Salazzle forms a Corrosion core with Glimmora and can land Toxic on threats such as Heatran, which loathe coming into Glimmora. It also provides Encore to neutralize Swords Dance Kingambit and Bulk Up Landorus-T and has access to Knock Off to further disrupt foes. Sneasler threatens Kingambit and loves Glimmora's ability to wear down walls like Toxapex and Corviknight and lure in Gholdengo and hit it with Toxic or Earth Power, allowing Sneasler to clean up Water and Steel teams late-game. Iron Moth also appreciates Glimmora wearing down teams with its entry hazards and dealing with Skeledirge; it is also the best response Poison teams have against Nasty Plot Gholdengo. Galarian Slowking is also an option, as it makes progress in the Poison matchup with Future Sight and retains the ability to pivot or damage with special attackers like Basculegion-F, Landorus, and Nasty Plot Rotom-W, but it can be quickly taken advantage of by the multitude of Dark- and Ghost-types in the tier.</p>"

        "Choice Scarf (Rock)": {
          "description": "<p>Glimmora is a decent Choice Scarf user for Rock teams due to its high Special Attack and Speed to take on threats like Ogerpon-W, Hisuian Lilligant, and non-Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. Earth Power threatens Steel- and Poison-types like Gholdengo, non-Air Balloon Heatran, Iron Moth, and Sneasler. Sludge Wave is a strong STAB move that can take on Fairy- and Grass-types such as Hisuian Lilligant, Ogerpon-W, Ogerpon-H, and non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant. Dazzling Gleam takes out Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types like Sableye, Hydreigon, and Kommo-o. Energy Ball allows Glimmora to deal with Water- and Ground-types like Quagsire and non-Choice Scarf Greninja and Great Tusk. Mortal Spin can be run over Energy Ball to help remove entry hazards and poison foes in the process. Power Gem can be run instead to deal with Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Kleavor.</p> <p>Tyranitar provides sand and a Psychic immunity while also taking on special attackers for Glimmora such as Spectrier, Espathra, and Hisuian Zoroark. Thanks to the sand Tyranitar provides, Glimmora can survive a Choice Specs Draco Meteor from Dragapult due to the Special Defense boost and 2HKO it with Dazzling Gleam. In return, Glimmora also takes out Hisuian Samurott, Quagsire, and Ogerpon-W for Tyranitar. Ogerpon-C can compensate for Glimmora's Ground weakness, and, after setup, it can eliminate Ursaluna-B, Dragonite, and Landorus. Glimmora aids Ogerpon-C by handling threats such as Kleavor when running Power Gem, Iron Valiant, and Hisuian Lilligant. Glimmora can further aid Ogerpon-C with Mortal Spin by removing entry hazards to help prevent Ogerpon-C's Sturdy from breaking. Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine is a strong wallbreaker that can deal with Corviknight, Clodsire, and Toxapex. Coalossal can serve as entry hazard control to allow Glimmora to drop Mortal Spin; it can additionally support the team with Spikes, facilitating Glimmora's cleaning. Coalossal also deals with Scizor, Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Corviknight. Glimmora returns the favor by threatening Clodsire and Toxapex, which can threaten Coalossal. Lead Kleavor can set up Stealth Rock and potentially break opposing Ceruledge's Focus Sash. In exchange, Glimmora eliminates physical walls like Quagsire and non-Air Balloon Heatran for Kleavor. Iron Defense Garganacl is a stallbreaker that can force progress with Salt Cure in matchups against defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra, and Galarian Slowking. Glimmora dispatches Choice Band Mamoswine after Stealth Rock, entry hazard chip and Urshifu-R, which can threaten Garganacl. Alolan Golem can trap and eliminate Steel-types like Scizor and Corviknight. Diancie can set up Stealth Rock while also OHKOing Chien-Pao with Body Press and Kommo-o with Moonblast if Glimmora is not running Dazzling Gleam.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Glimmora is a valuable dedicated lead on hyper offense teams that can reliably set up multiple entry hazards in Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, and potentially Spikes, as well as remove opposing ones with Mortal Spin. It can make use of its solid coverage options and remarkable Special Attack to pose a noticeable offensive threat itself, especially against common entry hazard setters, removers, and other dedicated leads. Power Gem threatens the metagame's best Defogger in Tornadus-T, while Sludge Bomb dents screens setters such as Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko and—if Focus Sash is still intact—Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant as well, which can be problematic against offensive teams. Earth Power pressures Steel-types like Heatran, Gholdengo, and Kingambit that would otherwise block Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Energy Ball deals with other entry hazard setters and removers such as Great Tusk, Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Rotom-W. Focus Sash guarantees that Glimmora can set at least one layer of entry hazards, potentially letting Toxic Debris trigger twice as well. Tera Ghost is used in a pinch to spinblock foes such as Great Tusk and Excadrill and remove its Ground weakness to set up multiple entry hazards in the face of other setters like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gastrodon. Gholdengo is a near-mandatory teammate to keep up entry hazards by blocking every attempts to remove them, such as Defog and Rapid Spin. Setup sweepers like Kingambit, Volcarona, Dragapult, Dragonite, and Iron Valiant appreciate entry hazards wearing down foes such as Dondozo and Clodsire and not being chipped down by opposing ones themselves; particularly, Kingambit's Knock Off can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Volcarona to make them vulnerable to Glimmora's entry hazards.</p>"

Memento is used to remove any boosts obtained by Pokemon trying to set up on Glimmora while also gaining momentum. Mud Shot is used to deter setup from the likes of Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, and Calm Mind Arceus formes. Tera Steel enables Glimmora to spinblock opposing Glimmora. Tera Fairy grants an immunity to Scale Shot from Koraidon, which may otherwise break through Glimmora's Focus Sash. Tera Ghost is an alternative option to prevent Rapid Spin from opposing leads such as Great Tusk. A bulky EV spread of 80 Def / 224 SpA / 204 Spe with a Bold nature can be used to prevent Scale Shot Koraidon from OHKOing non-Terastallized Glimmora.

          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Fillet Away is one of the best setup moves in the game, doubling Veluza's Speed and power at the cost of half its health. Aqua Cutter and Psycho Cut are both boosted by Sharpness, and after a Fillet Away will OHKO many neutral targets, such as Rotom, Mabosstiff, and Clawitzer. For Veluza's last move, Substitute can be used to ease prediction, facilitate setup, and avoid Sucker Punch. Aqua Jet can also be used to revenge kill weakened foes and, after setup, outprioritize other priority moves such as Lycanroc's Accelerock. Tera Blast is an option with Tera Fairy to blast past Cacturne, which otherwise completely walls it. Otherwise, Tera Water is good choice to further boost the power of Veluza's Aqua Cutter, giving it a guaranteed OHKO on specially defensive Umbreon after Stealth Rock. Sitrus Berry helps Veluza set up sucessfully, and 4 HP EVs ensure that it will activate after a Fillet Away. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize Veluza's damage output, but a Jolly nature enables Veluza to outspeed Timid Farigiraf prior to setup and Choice Scarf Zoroark post-setup.</p> <p>Veluza's incredible Speed and power after setup make it an excellent choice for hyper offense teams. Entry hazard support from Lycanroc and Qwilfish can help chip Veluza's checks into range of its attacks. Bulk Up Paldean Tauros is a great partner for Veluza, as it can easily switch into and set up against Pokemon that give Veluza trouble, such as Cacturne. In return, Veluza can set up on Pokemon used to revenge kill or force out Paldean Tauros, like a Choice Scarf Indeedee-F locked into Psychic or Psyshock. Paldean Tauros also helps Veluza break past shared walls in Vaporeon and Tera Water Sandaconda, enabling one of them to sweep late-game. Other good offensive partners to pair with Veluza include Jolteon and Quiver Dance Vivillon. Jolteon provides an Electric immunity for the team while also giving Veluza points of entry through Volt Switch. Vivillon threatens Cacturne, and its Sleep Powder may cripple one of Veluza's checks, allowing it to sweep. Indeedee-F is another good teammate for Veluza, as Psychic Terrain shields Veluza from priority attacks, such as Sucker Punch, while boosting the power of Psycho Cut to absurd levels.</p>"

Sleep Talk enables Dondozo to further take advantage of Rest, allowing it to continue to setup or attack its target while asleep. Dondozo takes advantage of its STAB through the use of Waterfall, doing more damage, but Avalanche allows Dondozo to OHKO Meowscarada, as well as pressure Water-immune Pokemon such as Clodsire and Gastrodon.

Gastrodon can also stack Spikes or set Stealth Rock, wearing down foes for Dondozo. The defensive core of Dondozo, Toxapex, and Gastrodon also gives Water teams opportunities to scout powerful attacks by allowing for each to switch-in for another, such as Dondozo switching in for Gastrodon or Toxapex to tank Chien-Pao's Crunch. Earthquake also allows it to take on Poison- and Electric-type Pokemon such as Clodsire and Sandy Shocks.

          "description": "<p>Dondozo is a sturdy physical wall on defensive teams, with its nigh-unbreakable Defense combined with Unaware letting it wall an array of terrifying threats such as Sneasler, Mega Swampert, and Urshifu-R. However, passivity and reliance on Rest for recovery limit its usefulness outside of incredibly defensive teams. Liquidation is Dondozo's STAB move of choice for its slightly higher Base Power increasing its odds of 2HKOing targets such as Heatran and Landorus-T after Stealth Rock, while Waterfall is appreciated for its higher PP. Curse aids Dondozo in taking even less damage from physical attackers while potentially turning it into a late-game wincon, while Body Press is an option to hit Water-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Urshifu-R, and Ogerpon-W. Rest is Dondozo's only option for recovery, while Sleep Talk allows Dondozo to damage Pokemon while asleep, preventing it from being completely passive. Heavy-Duty Boots  is the preferred item, ensuring Dondozo avoids damage from entry hazards and minimizing its need to use Rest. Leftovers are is an alternative on teams with fantastic entry hazard removal to grant it passive longevity. Fairy is the ideal Tera Type to resist Fighting-type attacks such as Close Combat from Zamazenta and Mega Medicham as well as Dark-type attacks such as Mega Gyarados and Hisuian Samurott's STAB moves. Dondozo fits best on bulky balance or stall teams that appreciate its unparalleled ability to check physical threats. Special walls such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, Gliscor, and Blissey check special attackers that Dondozo struggles with, such as Volcarona, Zapdos, and Rotom-W; the aforementioned Ground-types also provide an immunity to Volt Switch from Zapdos and Rotom-W, which Dondozo would otherwise grant free pivoting opportunities to. Solid Knock Off absorbers such as Gliscor and Tornadus-T pair well with Dondozo, as losing its item would open up to it taking entry hazard damage. However, if Dondozo opts to use Leftovers, Gliscor and Tornadus-T can act as Defoggers to alleviate entry hazard pressure. Electric Terrain offense teams trouble Dondozo by cutting off its recovery, so teammates such as Toxapex and Gliscor aid it against common threats on such teams, including Iron Valiant and Sneasler. On stall teams, Wish passers such as Alomomola and Clefable allow Dondozo to switch into such attackers and regain its lost HP.</p>"

Just note that Chien-Pao is shockingly heavy, so Body Press or Wave Crash is preferred against that threat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake offers more reliable Ground-type coverage at the cost of not being an instant KO like Fissure.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization will help against some specific checks to Dondozo, it's typing is great for general purposes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass removes Dondozo’s usual set of weaknesses and allows it to absorb spore from the likes of Amoonguss, Breloom, and Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy grants Dondozo a new set of resistances to take advantage of with its phenomenal bulk and also grants it a powerful STAB to hit Dragon- and Fighting-types with if it runs Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: When paired with Heavy Slam, Dondozo can now 2HKO Iron Bundle without Stealth Rock support, in addition to gaining a fantastic defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Terastallizing into a Ground-type allows Dondozo to block the Electric-type attacks commonly aimed at it while also giving it STAB on Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Tera Dragon gives Dondozo a resistance to both Electric- and Water-type attacks, allowing it to stand up to Rotom-W much better.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>44 HP / 212 Atk / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: This EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Choice Specs Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This more offensive spread makes sense if you have better options for Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thanks to great bulk and the dangerous Rage Fist, Annihilape is one of the premier bulky set-up sweepers of Battle Stadium Singles.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt helps you deal with annoying Pokemon like Whirlwind Ting-Lu, Dondozo, Will-O-Wisp Skeledirge, and Hippowdon, to mention a few, forcing them to attack and boost Rage Fist. This can work on Toxapex, but be warned that Toxapex commonly carries Mental Herb, which could get Annihilape poisoned if it doesn't Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore is an interesting alternative to Taunt, not able to directly shut down defensive answers to Annihilape, but it severely punishes them when Annihilape switches into a support move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: With Vital Spirit, Annihilape can absorb Spore from foes like Breloom, Brute Bonnet, and Amoonguss.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization is quite helpful at saving Annihilape from certain extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Flutter Mane, but Annihilape is perfectly functional without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: In addition to giving a useful resistance to Fairy, Fire, and Ice attacks from dangerous foes like Flutter Mane, Chi-Yu, and Chien-Pao, Tera Fire also prevents Will-O-Wisp from hitting.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel turns Annihilape's Psychic and Fairy weakness into resistances, as well as being an excellent defensive type overall. It lets Annihilape set up freely on Amoonguss and Toxapex, gives it a better chance of defeating Flutter Mane, and resisting Flower Trick means Meowscarada has a much harder time revenge killing it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: While not as sturdy of a defensive typing as Tera Steel, Tera Poison offers a better matchup against Flutter Mane, does well against Meowscarada, and lets Annihilape freely switch into Toxic and Toxic Spikes later in the match. This also drastically reduces the risk of Taunting Toxapex, which makes this Tera type a menace against stall teams!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying helps a lot to avoid Fissure from Dondozo and Ting-Lu, forcing it to attack with moves that boost Rage Fist. It also improves Annihilape's match-up against Great Tusk, and makes Hippowdon an easy foe to set up on.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a good choice against Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Palafin-H.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's residual recovery eases the long-game of setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs</strong>: Reducing the HP EVs to 244 gives Annihilape an even HP stat, which lets Annihilape recover its health with Sitrus Berry the moment it gets hit by Ruination. This makes dealing with Ting-Lu and Wo-Chien an easier task.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak makes Annihilape immune to being Salt Cured, making it a great check against Garganacl. It also gives peace of mind, avoiding potential flinches from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, or Special Defense drops from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove</strong>: Removing contact damage from Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin is helpful against defensive Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximum Speed mainly helps Annihilape outspeed Gholdengo, Great Tusk, Baxcalibur, and Modest Chi-Yu. With Bulk Up and Rage Fist improving its offense, Annihilape can invest in HP over Attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 244 SpD / 12 Spe with Careful</strong>: More special bulk can make it much more difficult for special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu to revenge kill Annihilape. This spread in particular has a 62.5% chance of surviving Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 164 Def / 100 SpD with Careful</strong>: This EV spread avoids an OHKO from +2 Chien-Pao, which can be especially helpful with Covert Cloak blocking the flinch chance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 SpD / 100 Spe with Careful</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom and Cloyster while still giving Annihilape good special bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 196 Def / 60 Spe with Impish</strong>: This physically defensive spread will survive Tera Flying Adamant Dragonite's Tera Blast, while outspeeding 4 Speed EV Mimikyu and Jolly Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Annihilape's good bulk and significant offensive presence makes it an easy to use Stealth Rock setter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rage Fist</strong>: Rage Fist is Annihilape’s strongest move; its power and coverage often lets Annihilape either defeat or significantly chip one of the opponent’s Pokemon on top of getting Stealth Rock up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drain Punch versus Close Combat</strong>: The huge amount of Dark-types in this metagame necessitates a Fighting STAB attack. Drain Punch is preferred in most cases for the extra recovery, but Close Combat makes plenty of sense if using Focus Sash and an offensive EV spread.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt gives Annihilape a strong matchup into bulky walls such as Ting-Lu and opposing setup foes like Volcarona, while also making it easier to boost Rage Fist’s power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Final Gambit</strong>: Annihilape's impressive HP stat makes Final Gambit into a powerful KO trading tool, being able to take out bulky foes like Garganacl, Corviknight, Wo-Chien, and Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb versus Bulldoze</strong>: Rock Tomb is an excellent Speed reducing move for its ability to hit Dragonite, and threaten Volcarona and Iron Bundle. Its low accuracy should be noted as a risk, however. Bulldoze trades hitting Dragonite in exchange for dealing good damage against Gholdengo and Iron Moth.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore is an incredibly powerful move that can lock the opponent into an attacking move to boost Rage Fist's power. Alternatively, it can lock the opponent into a status move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fling and Light Ball</strong>: This gives Annihilape a chance to paralyze a foe, including Gholdengo that lack Covert Cloak, and break potential Focus Sashes too.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curse</strong>: This is an excellent way for Annihilape to retire itself from the battle while putting significant pressure on the opponent to switch out and shutting down gimmicks such as Baton Pass.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This Annihilape is often used quite early in the game to set up Stealth Rock, so Terastallization is often not needed unless it must check a specific threat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel has excellent defensive synergy with Annihilape thanks to the Fairy resistance and doing particularly well on spreads that are faster than -1 Chien-Pao to move before Sacred Sword lands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Beyond offering a valuable Fairy resistance, the Ice and Fire resistances make Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu easier to deal with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Ghost-type attacks are incredibly common. Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and opposing Annihilape all struggle against an unexpected Tera Normal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison has a good matchup against Flutter Mane, and lets Annihilape deal with Toxic and Toxic Spikes without needing to Taunt.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Even when using bulky EV spreads, Focus Sash is useful for surviving an attack from foes that can be difficult to EV for, such as Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry can be used with specialized spreads to avoid certain 2HKOs. Just make sure to have an even HP stat, to ensure that Sitrus Berry activates after getting hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roseli Berry</strong>: Roseli Berry works well on specially defensive EV spreads designed defeat Flutter Mane leads that lack Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: Vital Spirit adds to Annihilape’s reliability as a lead. Immunity to sleep moves from common Pokemon such as Breloom, Brute Bonnet, Dondozo, Hippowdon, and Skeledirge lets Annihilape thrive with more defensive EV spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Defiant</strong>: While Intimidate Pokemon are far from common from the format, Defiant can take advantage opposing Speed control moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Inner Focus</strong>: This niche ability prevents flinches from Chien-Pao and Dragonite from happening.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>172 HP / 4 Atk / 212 Def / 4 SpD / 116 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This Speed drop based spread allows Annihilape to outspeed -1 Iron Bundle and avoids getting 2HKOed by Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: If using Focus Sash and Close Combat together, maximizing Attack and Speed will win the most matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>220 HP / 244 SpD / 44 Spe with Careful</strong>: This Roseli Berry based spread lets Annihilape survive Modest Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball and outspeed -1 Garchomp and 4 Speed EV Tinkaton.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Sitrus Berry EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 180 SpD / 100 Spe with Careful</strong>: This Sitrus Berry optimized EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, while outspeeding Adamant Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 244 Def / 20 Spe with Impish</strong>: This defensive spread is Annihilape's best chance at being a soft check to Chien-Pao, though note that Swords Dance and Terastallization together can still overwhelm Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul>"

If you can manage to get Annihilape into a weak attack, though, Rage Fist has much more reward associated with it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Final Gambit</strong>: If using maximum HP, Final Gambit can potentially OHKO major defensive threats if Annihilape is healthy, such as Garganacl and Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Very Situational</strong>: Since Annihilape often sacrifices itself with Final Gambit, Terastallization is usually a bad idea unless absolutely needed for a highly specific, match dependent win condition.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: A Ghost Tera type makes Shadow Claw OHKO Dragapult, as well as giving it a 56.3% chance of OHKOing 4 HP Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal gives Annihilape an immunity to Ghost-type attacks, potentially getting it a revenge kill against a bulky Flutter Mane it wouldn't otherwise.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: The immunity to Spore gives Annihilape a good opportunity to switch into Breloom, and it need not worry about Yawn.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Defiant</strong>: While Intimidate is not particularly common, punishing that and Speed drops can lead to devastating surprise sweeps.</p> </li> </ul>"

Its fantastic defensive typing allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes and nets it nice resistances to Fighting and Fairy, letting it check a unique combination of threatening offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W. To aid in checking them, it runs Toxic to put these Pokemon on a timer, stalling with Recover as poison damage increases. When they're inevitably forced to switch, their replacement takes damage too since Clodsire sets Stealth Rock or Spikes, racking up even more damage. Leftovers can be used to help preserve Recover’s PP and stay in longer, while Heavy-Duty Boots helps Clodsire switch in and out to wall threats. Earthquake, besides providing direct damage, super effectively damages Pokemon that can't be poisoned like Gholdengo and other Clodsire. Terastallization gives Clodsire much more defensive flexibility as well; Tera Water can help it resist powerful STAB moves from Dondozo and Azumarill which would otherwise scare it out. Tera Flying is another useful option, turning its Ground weakness into an immunity while preserving its Fighting resistance, allowing it to stay in against Great Tusk and Focus Sash Breloom.</p> <p>Clodsire fits neatly into plenty of balance or stall teams looking for a way to handle special hits, offering support with both setting up hazards and removing Toxic Spikes, and walling sweepers with Unaware. Other hazard setters in particular love stacking hazards alongside it; since it learns both Stealth Rock and Spikes, it can fit with many options, like Spikes Meowscarada or Stealth Rock Garganacl. However, its mediocre Defense and weaknesses to Ground and Ice leave it particularly vulnerable to the the tier's physical wallbreakers, most notably Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Garchomp. As such, Clodsire greatly appreciates having teammates who can check these Pokemon and easily switch into Earthquake or Icicle Crash like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Tera Water Garganacl. In particular, Clodsire is completely stonewalled by Hatterene and Air Balloon or Tera Flying Gholdengo. The former reflects both Toxic and entry hazards while overpowering its healing with Psyshock, and the latter is immune to Toxic via Good as Gold, even if it loses its Steel typing. Great teammates to help check these two are Gholdengo itself for Hatterene, which threatens Hatterene with Make It Rain and its unpredictable set versatility, and Kingambit for opposing Gholdengo, which resists both of Gholdengo's STAB moves and can immediately threaten to OHKO it back. In turn, these two appreciate Clodsire checking the Fire-types that scare them out, especially Iron Moth and Skeledirge. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo can check the Water-type threats Clodsire fears, like Floatzel and Azumarill.</p>"

Spikes are preferred on Clodsire, as the move has more limited distribution and Clodsire enters the field commonly enough to have the opportunity to use the move. However, Stealth Rock can be used if Clodsire's team requires it. Toxic is used to cripple common switch-ins to Clodsire, such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Great Tusk. Poison Jab can be used to poison post-Tera Gholdengo attempting to remove its Ground weakness, and it forces damage on Tornadus-T faster. Heavy-Duty Boots are preferred on Clodsire to negate its weakness to opposing Spikes teams, although Leftovers are also viable to increase Clodsire's longevity. Unaware is preferred over Water Absorb to negate Clodsire's passivity against setup sweepers, and Water Absorb does little to help against the likes of Mega Swampert and Gastrodon. Tera Dark grants Clodsire a Ghost resistance, which helps against Choice Specs Dragapult and Gholdengo, especially if using Poison Jab against the latter. It also grants Clodsire with a Pursuit resistance against the likes of Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar, which can both exploit its physical frailty. Clodsire fits best on defensively oriented teams that appreciate its special walling and entry hazard support. As Clodsire is weak to most physical attackers such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Dragonite, teammates that can cover them, such as Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Buzzwole, make for good partners. In return, Clodsire can switch into Electric-type attacks for the former, and powerful special attackers such as Dragapult for the latter two. Pokemon that benefit from Spikes support, such as Tornadus-T and Gholdengo, also pair well with Clodsire, as Spikes puts pressure on checks to them such as Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar. In return, Clodsire appreciates these teammates being able to make more immediate progress. Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Tornadus-T as well as Weavile and Mega Scizor pair well with Clodsire, crippling Heavy-Duty Boots users such as opposing Clodsire and Toxapex, giving Clodsire's entry hazards support a greater impact.</p>"

Poison Jab hits threats like Meowscarada, Rotom-C, and Iron Valiant, while Gunk Shot provides more power against bulkier foes such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Toxic Spike eases the Dark and Fairy matchups due to their lack of entry hazard removal and applies pressure on teams in general, completing Ground's entry hazard stacking core.

Spikes lets Clodsire take advantage of forced switches and synergizes well with Glimmora, Toxapex, and Skuntank, all together forming Poison's entry hazard-stacking core.

Amoonguss can also run Growth, which helps in the Ground matchup, while Toxapex also chips down the opposing team by setting Toxic Spikes and wearing down threats like Chien-Pao with Infestation, Baneful Bunker, and Rocky Helmet. Skuntank is a Psychic-immune teammate that switches into Hatterene, Espathra, and Indeedee, and it can set Toxic Spikes better against types like Fairy and Psychic by trapping switch-ins such as Klefki and Bronzong with Fire Spin. Glimmora provides entry hazard support and removal with Stealth Rock and Mortal Spin, respectively, and it can run Air Balloon or Choice Scarf to handle Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads due to its great coverage. Glimmora can also run Corrosion with Toxic and Mortal Spin, improving the Poison matchup and putting defensive Pokemon such as opposing Clodsire and Amoongus on a timer.

The Ice- and Fairy-type resistances for Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane are also great to have.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Espathra's Stored Power is a big issue for Clodsire, so Tera Dark can flip the tables on it. Don't use this to block Psyshock, however, as most users of it also have Fairy-type coverage; a Tera typing neutral to Psyshock is normally enough.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric doesn't have as many benefits as other Tera types, but it is notable for being the most stable option into Gholdengo, a very common check to Clodsire. It not only provides a critical Make It Rain resistance but also blocks Thunder Wave from defensive sets.

However, it faces competition from Ting-Lu, which similarly checks Miraidon and Calyrex-S, has more offensive pressure, and gets Spikes up more easily. Spikes and Toxic Spikes give Clodsire a way to exert offensive pressure, alongside Earthquake which punishes Miraidon and Zacian-C on switch-in. Poison Jab can be used over Toxic or Toxic Spikes to potentially punish Taunt variants of Arceus-Fairy, but it is generally outclassed by the other options. Water Absorb makes Clodsire a more solid check to Miraidon, since Unaware ignores Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop, and lets Clodsire check Arceus-Water and variants of Kyogre without Substitute. Unaware is an alternative checks Calyrex-S more consistently. Tera Steel flips Clodsire's weakness to Ice- and Psychic-type attacks such as Kyogre's Ice Beam and Calyrex-S's Psyshock, while making Clodsire more reliable into Miraidon's Draco Meteor. Tera Dark makes Clodsire weaker to Arceus-Fairy and Miraidon, but checks Calyrex-S without a Fighting- or Fairy-type move, as well as Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Clodsire's ability to both absorb Toxic Spikes and check various special attackers gives it a niche on balance and stall teams. Clodsire pairs well with physical walls such as Gliscor, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, as they can check Koraidon, physical variants of Arceus formes, and Zacian-C. Secondary special walls such as Blissey are appreciated to ease the burden on Clodsire against Calyrex-S, Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, and Kyogre. Wo-Chien also checks these threats and helps against Dragon Dance variants of Arceus-Ground. Arceus is another partner for Clodsire that can pivot into Calyrex-S on balance teams, and appreciates Clodsire setting Spikes and clearing Toxic Spikes for it.</p>"

Sitrus Berry and Cud Chew allow Farigiraf to shrug off a majority of neutral attacks in the tier, greatly improving its survivability to grant Farigiraf the two turns of setup that it needs. The other alternative to Sitrus Berry is Cud Chew + Lum Berry, giving Farigiraf status immunity for 2 turns, which could allow Farigiraf to set up on the likes of Glare Sandaconda and Toxic or Thunder Wave Qwilfish. The Speed EVs let Farigiraf outspeed neutral-natured Clawitzer &amp; positive Speed-natured Cacturne and Ursaring at +0 while outrunning Choice Scarf Bruxish after an Agility, with the rest of the EVs being invested into Special Attack for maximum damage output. Dazzling Gleam is often preferred over Tera Blast for the ability to hit Dark-types without needing to Terastallize. Tera Fairy is very useful for its Dragon Tail immunity against Eelektross and Appletun, and turns Farigiraf's weaknesses to Dark and Bug into resistances, and also boosts Dazzling Gleam. Sap Sipper can also complement Tera Fairy to completely blank Appletun's dual STAB combination, with Cacturne and Lurantis being bonus setup targets. Armor Tail can be considered to stop priority moves from Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Bruxish while turning Sableye into setup fodder. Farigiraf can also use Calm Mind and a bulkier spread to set up more reliably on weaker special attackers such as Abomasnow, Raichu, and non-Trick Rotom. With Tera Steel, Farigiraf is able to better take on common Haze users like Articuno, Cryogonal, and Hisuian Qwilfish, hitting the former two super effectively with Tera Blast and gaining an immunity to the latter's Poison-type attacks.</p> <p>Farigiraf's low Speed often mandates using Agility first and also means it generally cannot threaten the opponent until turn 3, as it takes two turns to set up Agility followed by Nasty Plot. Strong teammates that can apply quick and immediate pressure on the opponent make for good partners, such as Tauros, Hisuian Sneasel, and Rotom. Pokemon that can also handle Farigiraf's checks and counters, namely Dark-types and Haze users, are especially appreciated. Nasty Plot + Taunt Houndoom and Trick Rotom or Haunter can bait out defensive responses such as Umbreon, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Blissey in order to cripple them. A double Psychic core involving Farigiraf and either Bruxish or Mesprit can also work to wear down their shared checks and prevent them from answering one or the other. Rest Sandaconda can shrug off attacks from Umbreon and Hisuian Qwilfish while even smacking the latter with Earthquake. Hisuian Sneasel and Toxicroak can threaten Umbreon and Hisuian Qwilfish, whereas Magneton, Pyroar, Houndoom, and Perrserker can switch into Haze Cryogonal and Articuno to apply offensive pressure. Scyther, Bombirdier, Magneton, and Perrserker can force out the opponent's less defensive Pokemon and pivot to give Farigiraf a window of opportunity to set up, with Bombirdier being particularly notable due to its access to Parting Shot and Memento. Abomasnow can provide Aurora Veil support for Farigiraf to make setting up easier.</p>"

          "description": "<ul> <li>Kingambit is a very threatening sweeper in Ubers thanks to Supreme Overlord, which grants it a guaranteed presence in the late-game. This is coupled with its access to Swords Dance, which not only enhances its already strong late-game but also gives it a tool to break holes in the opposing team during the early- and mid-game without needing teammates to faint. Kingambit's typing also allows it to be, at the very minimum, a one-time switch-in to very threatening Pokemon to the offensive teams it usually sees play in, like Flutter Mane.</li> <li>Unfortunately, the prevalence of Tera Fairy in the metagame means that Sucker Punch will, most of the time, be resisted. This, coupled with the fast-paced nature of the metagame, makes Kingambit a relatively slow and ineffective revenge killer when unboosted. Koraidon and Zacian-C are top-tier threats that resist Kingambit's Dark-type STAB attacks and can OHKO or heavily dent it. Lastly, Intimidate Landorus-T helps opposing offensive teams pivot into Kingambit more easily, especially if Kingambit is not running Leftovers, as it will not passively heal the damage it takes from foes pivoting out</li> <li>The listed EV spread allows Kingambit to outspeed Skeledirge while maximizing its offensive prowess. The HP EVs help Kingambit tank hits from Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Calm Mind Arceus a little better, giving it a favorable chance to avoid the 2HKO from Judgment and Earth Power from Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Low Kick hits Koraidon hard while also allowing Kingambit to hit Pokemon like Tera Steel Giratina-O and Extreme Killer Arceus supereffectively. However, this leaves Kingambit hopelessly walled by Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Tera Dark empowers Kingambit's Dark-type STAB attacks to absurd levels, giving it a chance to OHKO Koraidon with 5 fainted allies after a Swords Dance. Tera Dark also removes Kingambit's Ground-type weakness, allowing it to boost itself or hit Pokemon like Landorus-T more comfortably. Tera Flying is another option that makes Kingambit immune to Ground-type attacks, giving it the opportunity to freely set up or hit Pokemon like non-Whirlwind Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, Groudon, and Gliscor, while also giving it a resistance to Koraidon's Fighting-type attacks and a neutrality to its Flare Blitz. Tera Fire gives Kingambit a resistance to both of Zacian-C's STAB types and an immunity to burn from Pokemon like Groudon, Alomomola, and Skeledirge, the last of which can also leverage Tera Fairy to resist Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave.</li> <li>Kingambit fits best on offensive teams, as they can weaken opposing Pokemon to the point where Kingambit sweeping is likely. Teammates like Koraidon, Zacian-C, Miraidon, Flutter Mane, and Arceus can help Kingambit by weakening its checks and breaking holes. Kingambit can revenge kill and potentially sweep through the broken holes in return. Spikes from Pokemon like Groudon and Meowscarada can weaken Zacian-C and Koraidon for Kingambit. Lastly, Pokemon that can switch in on Landorus-T, like Calm Mind Arceus formes, are also good partners, as Kingambit doesn't appreciate taking Rocky Helmet damage.</li> </ul>"

Swords Dance allows Kingambit to capitalize on its already great Attack stat, letting it threaten defensive walls such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. Making up for its lack of Speed, Sucker Punch fits perfectly on Kingambit. In tandem with three boosts from Supreme Overlord, Sucker Punch OHKOes Flutter Mane; it also OHKOes Volcarona after Swords Dance in tandem with two Supreme Overlord boosts. Kowtow Cleave is a reliable heavy-hitting STAB attack, and Iron Head hits Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Supreme Overlord is one of Kingambit's main selling points, allowing it to 2HKO Specially Defensive Corviknight and almost always 2HKO Quagsire after Stealth Rock. The Speed EVs allow Kingambit to outspeed both Corviknight and Skeledirge, both which otherwise can threaten Kingambit with Body Press and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Leftovers are used to support Kingambit's solid defensive stats, giving it a form of recovery.</p> <p>Kingambit functions as an excellent late-game sweeper, making use of its ability and setup potential; thus, Kingambit greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Ting-Lu to pressure offensive teams who lack hazard removal. Greninja and Hydreigon cover physically defensive walls, hitting Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Amoonguss that Kingambit would otherwise struggle with. Sableye provides an important Fighting-type immunity to make up for Kingambit's typing. Skuntank can be used in combination with Kingambit to ease the Fairy-type matchup and set Toxic Spikes, chipping foes and making it easier for Kingambit to sweep late-game. Chien-Pao and Meowscarada help make up for some of Kingambit's type weaknesses. Chien-Pao can hit Ground-types such as Garchomp and Great Tusk. Meowscarada can make use of Choice Scarf combined with Play Rough to hit Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant while also hitting Ground- and Water-types such as Quagsire.</p>"

Kowtow Cleave allows it to break through walls that don't resist it such as Skeledirge, which poses a major complication for Steel teams, as well as 2HKOing Quagsire if all teammates have fainted. Sucker Punch can allow Kingambit to defeat threats like Barraskewda and Flutter Mane, which can massively threaten Steel teams. Iron Head damages Pokemon that don't mind Sucker Punch or Kowtow Cleave, such as Ting-Lu or Azumarill. Alternatively, Brick Break destroys dual screens and OHKOes other Kingambit trying to take its STAB moves. 140 Speed EVs allow Kingambit to outspeed walls such as uninvested Skeledirge and Corviknight. Black Glasses boosts its Dark-type moves to dangerous levels without it having to set up Swords Dance, but Leftovers may be used to increase Kingambit's survivability. Chople Berry has a niche in allowing Kingambit to survive Fighting-type moves such as Chien-Pao's Sacred Sword, while Heavy Duty Boots helps it pivot in and out to exert pressure on the opponent without getting chipped.</p> <p>Scizor's U-turn safely pivots Kingambit in to wallbreak while dealing substantial chip damage; also, its Bullet Punch deals with threats to Kingambit such as Chien-Pao and Iron Valiant, and Close Combat allows it to check threats such as Iron Treads and Ting-Lu. Gholdengo is an excellent partner to freely switch into Fighting-type moves and Will-O-Wisp. Corviknight serves as a potent check to Chien-Pao and clears entry hazards to increase Kingambit's longevity, Magnezone breaks through bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo, and it preserves momentum through Volt Switch. Iron Treads serves as another hazard clearer, can set up Stealth Rock to chip any walls Kingambit wants to break through, and can serve as speed control with a Choice Scarf. Klefki sets up dual screens, which allow Kingambit to use Swords Dance far more easily. Tinkaton can wall any Fairy-type moves meant to chip or finish off Kingambit, such as Flutter Mane's Moonblast, and KO many of their users with Gigaton Hammer. Orthworm's Shed Tail can be used with Kingambit to great effect, allowing it to freely use Swords Dance and threaten to sweep the opponent's team.</p>"

On its own, it possesses a valued Dark / Steel typing, letting it switch in on Mortal Spin users like Toxapex and Amoonguss to block entry hazard removal, which, combined with Kingambit's overall good bulk and high base Attack, makes it a very valuable part of teams. Swords Dance is the best move Kingambit has for improving its already impressive Attack, making it incredibly hard for Pokemon that do not resist it to survive a +2 Behemoth Bash or Behemoth Blade. Kingambit gains access to Knock Off, which is great for removing items of importance such as Covert Cloak and targeting physical walls that otherwise resist its Steel-type STAB moves such as Skeledirge and Toxapex. Sucker Punch is Kingambit's strongest priority attack and is needed for revenge killing purposes, as Kingambit has a low Speed stat. Bullet Punch is a reliable alternative move that can be run on Tera Steel sets and is not as prediction reliant as Sucker Punch is.</p> <p>Leftovers lets Kingambit passively heal and survive more, as it may need to switch in against a lot of teams that have Toxapex. Alternatively, Heavy-Duty Boots lets it switch in more against entry hazard-stacking teams that run Spikes as well, but this may require Wish support for Kingambit to consistently succeed in its role. Covert Cloak is a reliable item to avoid annoying secondary effects such as burns, Salt Cure, and stat drops. Metal Coat and Black Glasses are viable alternative item choices, as they work with Supreme Overlord's multiplier.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Kingambit outspeed uninvested slow Pokemon in the tier that would outspeed it otherwise such as Corviknight, Skeledirge, and Sylveon. Tera Flying allows it to completely flip its type matchup, as it makes Kingambit immune to Spikes, resist Fighting-type moves, and immune to Ground-type moves, letting it stay in against Pokemon like Great Tusk, which would otherwise be a fantastic check to Kingambit. Tera Steel allows it to maintain its Mortal Spin blocking capabilities while boosting the power of Behemoth Blade or Behemoth Bash and remaining resistant to Stealth Rock. Good partners are Pokemon that can pivot Kingambit in safely such as Toxapex. Rotom-W and Sandy Shocks are valuable partners against physical walls such as Dondozo and Great Tusk.</p>"

Tera Steel combines the Flying resistance from Electric with the Fairy resistance and Toxic immunity from Poison while adding on a Psychic resistance at the cost of being weak to Fighting. Due to its relatively low Speed tier even after a boost, Great Tusk will need help against revenge killers like Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, so Pokemon that can handle the two, such as Mega Scizor, Slowking-G, and Heatran, are appreciated.

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Great Tusk's primal physical prowess and great support options make it a good choice for a bulky Fighting-type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Headlong Rush</strong>: Headlong Rush's defensive drops and vulnerability to Rocky Helmet make it a riskier option than Earthquake, but the extra power OHKOes maximum HP Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: This is highly recommended to avoid getting walled by Dragonite before it Terastallizes, while also dealing good damage to common Tera Flying Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rapid Spin</strong>: Great Tusk is one of the best Rapid Spin users, being able to take advantage of it offensively and heavily pressuring Ting-Lu to Terastallize or switch out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Beyond the usefulness of removing items, this is Great Tusk's best move against Air Balloon Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb</strong>: Rock Tomb is a good speed control option, great for breaking through Dragonite's Multiscale while nullifying its potential Speed boost, while letting other teammates take advantage of speed control. It also lets Great Tusk hit troublesome Focus Sash Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane and Gengar, something Rapid Spin can't do.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head</strong>: If using Tera Steel, Iron Head is a decent option for OHKOing Flutter Mane without using Headlong Rush, and it deals heavy damage to Baxcalibur and Tera Fairy Rotom-W.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization can help with Great Tusk's poor special bulk by resisting certain hits, but it works fine without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel greatly aids against the many Fairy-, Ice-, and Flying-types that would otherwise prey on Great Tusk, such as Mimikyu, Iron Bundle, and Tera Flying Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water massively improves the matchup against Chien-Pao, and can let Great Tusk survive an encounter with offensive Iron Moth or Chi-Yu that lack Choice Specs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: The furious increase in power Tera Ground provides can be useful late game, giving Earthquake a high chance to OHKO even defensive Gholdengo and Headlong Rush the ability to 2HKO Terastallized Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Not only does Tera Fighting improve the Chien-Pao matchup, but it OHKOs even the bulkiest Ting-Lu with Close Combat.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: This patches up Great Tusk's poor Special Defense, which can be paired with the correct Tera Type to help against foes like Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, Iron Moth, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: When saving Great Tusk for late-game sweeps, Booster Energy is preferred over Life Orb for preserving its HP against priority attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash on such a bulky Pokemon may seem wasteful, but it vastly improves Great Tusk's matchups against special attackers such as Rotom-W and makes setting up Stealth Rock a far simpler task. If using Focus Sash, consider using the first alternate EV spread below.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>4 HP / 12 Def / 236 Atk / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This EV spread survives Adamant Focus Sash Meowscarada's Flower Trick followed by Sucker Punch, making it a good spread to use if using Focus Sash and Rapid Spin.</li> </ul> <h1>Assault Vest EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p>All of these EV spreads will at least avoid a 2HKO from Modest Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire if using Tera Steel. If using a different Tera type, 16 Special Defense EVs can be redistributed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>52 HP / 148 Atk / 4 Def / 164 SpD / 140 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom, and the rare Timid Abomasnow.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 44 Atk / 4 Def / 164 SpD / 244 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is for Rapid Spin, outspeeding Iron Bundle after a Speed boost.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Great Tusk's fantastic Defense stat makes it a great option for setting up Bulk Up late-game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt versus Substitute</strong>: Taunt preys on defensive Pokemon such as Wo-Chien and Corviknight, while Substitute protects Great Tusk from Garganacl's Salt Cure. Dragon Tail from Garchomp and Dragonite, and OHKO moves from the likes of Dondozo and Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Dragonite is such a problematic foe that hitting it hard is worth more than a Fighting-type STAB move.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Body Press</strong>: Although it is difficult to fit in without sacrificing utility or coverage, Body Press is a reasonable option if a Fighting-type STAB move is needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: Close Combat does not gel well with the defensive nature of this set, but it deals far more damage to Ting-Lu than any of Great Tusk's other options.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Great Tusk is a good bulky sweeper on its own, but Terstallization makes it far more difficult to revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Not only is Tera Water an excellent option against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, but it also means Dondozo will never break Great Tusk's Substitute with Wave Crash, and Assault Vest Azumarill become an easy target to set up on.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a great option for dealing with Great Tusk's weaknesses, such as Fairy-types and makes Iron Bundle usually fail to 2HKO specially defensive Great Tusk without Choice Specs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a decent alternative to Tera Steel, providing the vital Fairy-type resistance without the weaknesses to Fighting- and Fire-type attacks and an extremely useful immunity to being poisoned that eases the match-up against Toxic Spikes foes such as Clodsire and Meowscarada.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Fire is not a great defensive type; however, not only does it do well against Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane, it also protects Great Tusk from fast Will-O-Wisp users such as Dragapult, Mimikyu, and Volcarona.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: The residual recovery from Leftovers best suits the slow set-up of this set, especially if using Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Depending on the EV spread, Booster Energy can boost Attack or Speed to increase Great Tusk's late-game cleaning potential.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If a Garganacl check is desperately needed, Covert Cloak Great Tusk is up for the task.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 140 Atk / 4 Def / 36 SpD / 140 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom and the rare Timid Abomasnow, survives Timid Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry, and has a very good chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Adamant Azumarill after using Bulk Up. The Attack EVs OHKO Chien-Pao and defensive Gholdengo with Earthquake after Bulk Up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread gains a Speed boost from Protosynthesis, making Great Tusk an even better late-game sweeper at the cost of physical bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 20 Atk / 84 Def / 20 SpD / 140 Spe with Impish</strong>: This EV spread is meant for use with Tera Steel or Tera Poison, maintaining Great Tusk's Substitute against Dondozo's Wave Crash after Terastallization. It also outspeeds Adamant Breloom and the rare Timid Abomasnow, and survives Timid Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: Maximum investment in special bulk makes Great Tusk much more difficult to revenge kill with the likes of Gholdengo and Iron Bundle. The 4 Attack EVs gives an Attack boost from Protosynthesis, which is preferred for improving the Skeledirge matchup and sweeping more easily.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Great Tusk is a fantastic physical wall with a high base HP and Defense stat as well as a good defensive typing in Ground / Fighting. Earthquake provides great coverage against many Pokemon in the tier, such as Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Gholdengo. Thunderous Kick is a powerful Fighting-type move that lowers the target's Defense by one stage; this can be helpful in taking down opposing Pokemon that would otherwise halt Great Tusk like opposing Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Knock Off can cripple foes by removing their items, which is great against a lot of Pokemon, as it gets rid of annoying items such as Heavy-Duty Boots, Leftovers, and opposing Covert Cloak from Pokemon such as Garganacl, opposing Great Tusk, and Skeledirge. Rapid Spin is a potent utility move that allows Great Tusk to remove entry hazards from the user's side, while Spikes is an alternative to Rapid Spin, as it allows Great Tusk to set up hazards of its own if the user's team already has reliable hazard removal. Shore Up is a good recovery move, as it gets powered up by sand, and Great Tusk can use it often due to its decent Speed and bulk. Covert Cloak is the best item choice for Great Tusk, as it allows it to shrug off secondary effects from moves like Mortal Spin, Thunderous Kick, and Salt Cure without getting punished. This EV spread allows Great Tusk to maximize its physical bulk while still outspeeding some slower Pokemon such as Adamant Tyranitar and base 100 Speed Pokemon like Volcarona after a well-timed Rapid Spin. Maximizing Attack instead of HP is an alternative option due to Great Tusk's impressive base Attack stat; however, maximizing HP is the preferred way to go to maximize overall bulk. Tera Water allows Great Tusk to turn the tables on physically offensive Water-types such as Palafin, and Gyarados; this allows Great Tusk to tank their STAB moves if needed. Additionally, Tera Ghost is an option to block Rapid Spin from opposing Great Tusk and punish them for not carrying Knock Off. Good partners for Great Tusk include Corviknight, Tyranitar, Slowking, and Toxapex; these Pokemon can provide a way to take on special attacks and help pivot Great Tusk into the battle. Tyranitar can also set up sand, which can increase Great Tusk's Shore Up recovery.</p>"

This opens up powerful teammates like Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle.</li> <li>Earthquake makes Great Tusk harder to revenge kill than Headlong Rush does, as it doesn’t drop its defenses.</li> <li>Rapid Spin works well for teams weak to entry hazards. It's a great way to support powerful threats weak to Stealth Rock, like Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Iron Bundle.</li> <li>Knock Off provides fantastic item-removing support, and it especially cripples walls reliant on Leftovers like Scream Tail and Dondozo, allowing its team to more easily break past them.</li> <li>Play Rough can be used to OHKO Koraidon without Terastallizing, as well as beating opposing Great Tusk. However, it has very little practical use outside of this.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Great Tusk functions most effectively as a wallbreaker in the early- and mid-game, suited best for offensive structures that struggle with physical walls like the aforementioned Scream Tail and Dondozo. When building teams, remember Great Tusk must use Terastallization to actually break through said walls, so it may be hard for teammates to Terastallize.</li> <li>Choice Band Great Tusk only functions well on Sticky Web teams, where the stronger and slower set appreciates Sticky Web dropping foes' Speed.</li> <li>Koraidon is a great partner, setting up sun and activating Protosynthesis for Great Tusk. It further resists Water- and Grass-type moves aimed at Great Tusk, weakening the former. Koraidon also effectively baits in Skeledirge, which Great Tusk reliably threatens.</li> <li>Miraidon is also a great partner, as it can threaten Flying-types, like Corviknight and the rarer Pelipper and Dragonite. This helps to make Great Tusk’s Headlong Rush much more spammable.</li> <li>Gholdengo is also a good partner for Great Tusk, as it resists Ice-, Fairy-, and Grass-type moves aimed at Great Tusk, and it can threaten to KO Ice- and Fairy-types with super effective STAB Make It Rain. In addition, Gholdengo also blocks all hazard removal, helping to wear down walls for Great Tusk's team to eventually break through.</li> </ul>"

If paired with teammates that set Stealth Rock, then the best set would be Rapid Spin / Headlong Rush / Close Combat / Knock Off. Knock Off makes progress on Corviknight and covers the Air Balloon Gholdengo matchup.</li> <li>Tera Ground lets Great Tusk deal incredible damage with Headlong Rush while also letting it survive Flutter Mane's Moonblast from full HP. Tera Steel flips the Fairy matchup and lets Great Tusk take on Ice- and Dragon-type attacks, but the additional weaknesses to Fighting and Ground make Great Tusk unable to take on Koraidon, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads easily.</li> <li>Great Tusk can be used to take on entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Iron Treads one-on-one by forcing them out and removing hazards. Jolly is usually preferred to outspeed Gholdengo, Modest Chi-Yu, and Glimmora, but Adamant lets Tera Ground Headlong Rush OHKO Koraidon and specially defensive Annihilape after one layer of Spikes or Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Great Tusk should be used aggressively to force out and keep entry hazards off the field against other setters, such as Ting-Lu and Iron Treads, since Great Tusk is generally difficult to switch into. Great Tusk pairs well with Koraidon thanks to Orichalcum Pulse's sun, letting Great Tusk become an incredibly potent wallbreaker, and Great Tusk can clear entry hazards so that Koraidon can repeatedly come in. Miraidon also appreciates Great Tusk, as it forces out common checks such as Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Iron Treads. Great Tusk also appreciates Blissey being able to take on all of the special attackers that force Great Tusk out, such as Flutter Mane, Miraidon, and Iron Bundle.</li> </ul>"

It can comfortably set up on common physical walls like Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, Corviknight, and defensive Great Tusk.</li> <li>The STAB combination of Headlong Rush and Close Combat hits most physical walls for at least neutral damage. Earthquake may be used as the Ground-type STAB move to avoid defensive drops, but it is a weaker move, and it can't secure important OHKOs and 2HKOs at +1 Attack against some physical walls such as Toxapex, Scream Tail, and Alomomola.</li> <li>A Jolly nature is used to outspeed all viable unboosted Pokemon after one Rapid Spin. An Adamant nature makes Great Tusk stronger while still letting it outspeed unboosted Iron Bundle at +1 Speed, but it misses out on outspeeding maximum Speed Gholdengo and tying Jolly Great Tusk.</li> <li>Terastallizing into the Ground typing boosts Headlong Rush and guarantees some additional OHKOs and 2HKOs on foes like Toxapex and Scream Tail. Additionally, getting rid of the Fighting typing lets Great Tusk survive Fairy-type attacks such as Dazzling Gleam from Miraidon and Moonblast from Flutter Mane without Life Orb or Choice Specs, and it facilitates taking Dazzling Gleam and Play Rough from Scream Tail and Alomomola.</li> <li>Alternatively, using Tera Steel gives Great Tusk resistances to Fairy-type attacks, Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle, and Draco Meteor from Miraidon, allowing it to surprise them with a strong attack.</li> <li>Koraidon is a solid partner because its sun activates Great Tusk's Protosynthesis, making its attacks even stronger. In return, Great Tusk can break through or strongly dent common Koraidon checks like Scream Tail, Alomomola, and Skeledirge, which allows Koraidon to clean more easily. Miraidon is also an excellent teammate, since Great Tusk can easily hard switch into its common checks and either threaten them with its attacks or set up on them.</li> <li>Special attackers like Miraidon, Flutter Mane, and Iron Bundle hugely threaten Great Tusk, so it is recommended to pair it with appropriate special walls like Blissey, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Clodsire. Gothitelle is a less popular pick but it helps eliminate bulky checks like Dondozo and Pelipper, allowing Great Tusk to sweep more easily.</li> </ul>"

Knock Off can be used to take on Air Balloon Gholdengo and wear down foes that want to switch into Great Tusk such as Corviknight and Annihilape, but it is generally outclassed by the sheer utility of Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock. The combination of Knock Off and Body Press can be used to pressure Corviknight switch-ins.</li> <li>Bulk Up is an option to boost alongside opposing Great Tusk and Swords Dance Kingambit and Koraidon.</li> <li>Great Tusk can Terastallize into the Fairy typing to take on physical attackers such as Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and Palafin in sun. However, be wary of Terastallizing against Koraidon that can still Terastallize themselves, as Choice Band Tera Fire Koraidon can take on Great Tusk one-on-one. Great Tusk can also Terastallize into the Ground typing or the Water typing, with both options removing its weakness to Fairy. The former also lets it fire off stronger Earthquakes as well, while the latter provides useful resistances to Fire moves from Koraidon as well as Ice- and Water-type moves, barring Freeze-Dry, from Iron Bundle.</li> <li>Great Tusk fits on most teams as a bulky Stealth Rock setter and Koraidon check. Great Tusk can utilize Rocky Helmet to punish the use of U-turn, though this hurts its longevity, as it then loses Leftovers's passive recovery.</li> <li>Great Tusk pairs well with defensive Scream Tail and Blissey, both of which can take on Iron Bundle while also providing Wish support for Great Tusk. Blissey can also take on Chi-Yu and Miraidon, while Scream Tail can take on Iron Valiant.</li> <li>Great Tusk also pairs well with Gholdengo, as it appreciates Great Tusk forcing out Koraidon while preventing hazard removal in exchange. Choice Scarf Chi-Yu is a good partner due to its ability to pressure faster special attackers that trouble Great Tusk such as Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane. Great Tusk also pairs well with Miraidon, as non-Heavy-Duty Boots Miraidon appreciates it removing entry hazards and taking on Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu. Finally, Koraidon is a good partner, as it can set up sun, pivot into Great Tusk, and force out most hazard removal options besides opposing defensive Great Tusk.</li> </ul>"

Ice Spinner OHKOes Primordial Sea Zapdos after a Bulk Up, OHKOes Dragonite and 2HKOes Landorus-Therian, while Knock Off threatens Skeledirge and Ceruledge if not running Headlong Rush and cripples defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Quaquaval, and Earth Eater Gholdengo looking to switch in. Close Combat threatens Earth Eater Kingambit and Empoleon, as well as Roaring Moon, while Headlong Rush threatens Iron Moth, Skeledirge and Ceruledge. Fluffy helps Great Tusk set up Bulk Up more easily with its heightened physical bulk, making it a powerful tank. Great Tusk is a potent wallbreaker and entry hazard remover, so Pokemon that are vulnerable to entry hazards like Ogerpon-H and Chien-Pao benefit from its presence. In return, they threaten common defensive Pokemon that wall Great Tusk, such as Manaphy and Corviknight. Great Tusk has terrible special bulk and appreciates pivoting, so special walls like RegenVest Roaring Moon and the aforementioned Manaphy make for great teammates.

Its defensive typing and high Speed make it a good answer to Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Walking Wake. Dazzling Gleam is this set's only attacking move, letting it hit Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Iron Valiant and prevents it from being shut down by Taunt from Pokemon like Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Greninja. Wish gives Scream Tail a recovery move while letting it heal teammates such as Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Hatterene that lack reliable recovery and are vulnerable to being overwhelmed by repeated hits. Protect synergizes well with Wish, making it much more reliable as a recovery move. Additionally, Protect scouts the intentions of Choice-locked Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Hisuian Zoroark. Encore prevents setup sweepers like Volcarona, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Bulk Up Great Tusk from using Scream Tail as a setup opportunity, letting Scream Tail's teammates switch in and take advantage of these threats. It can also be used to annoy passive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Dondozo. Tera Fairy gives Scream Tail better matchups against Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Hisuian Zoroark, with the former two being susceptible to being OHKOed by Dazzling Gleam. Alternatively, Tera Water lets Scream Tail maintain a solid defensive typing while also helping it check Walking Wake, Skeledirge, and Greninja. With a Timid nature, 152 Speed EVs let Scream Tail outspeed Hydreigon, while 236 Special Defense EVs ensure that Scream Tail gets a Special Defense boost with Protosynthesis under sun, letting it more easily take on threats such as Walking Wake and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 84 SpD / 172 Spe with a Calm nature lets Scream Tail outspeed unboosted Great Tusk and pass beefier Wishes.</p> <p>Scream Tail fits on many sun, balance, and stall teams thanks to its bulk, ability to pass Wish to teammates, and create momentum with Encore. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo make for good teammates, as they are able to check Greninja and Ceruledge, respectively. Moreover, Toxapex also checks Pokemon like Iron Moth and Glimmora as well as spread status, making Encore much more of a detriment to setup sweepers like Volcarona and Iron Valiant, while Dondozo blanket checks physically oriented Pokemon that can overwhelm Scream Tail, namely Booster Energy Roaring Moon and Ceruledge. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for excellent teammates, as a lack of hazards means that Scream Tail can accomplish feats such as surviving two Choice Specs Greninja Hydro Pumps from full HP. Additionally, Great Tusk appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Scream Tail answers such as Kingambit. Torkoal is a great teammate thanks to its sun activating Scream Tail's Protosynthesis. In addition, Torkoal very much appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Pokemon like Kingambit. Meanwhile, Scream Tail is able to sponge special attacks from the likes of Walking Wake. Under sun, Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Brute Bonnet appreciate Scream Tail facilitating their sweeps with its combination of Encore and Wish, keeping them healthy while leveraging setup opportunities for them. Hydreigon is another excellent offensive partner, checking Gholdengo and finding more opportunities to set up Substitute thanks to Scream Tail's Wish.</p>"

          "description": "<p>A blend of a great Speed stat and solid mixed bulk, combined with great utility options and an interesting defensive typing, Scream Tail a solid niche in the tier, allowing it to check dangerous threats such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham. Wish and Protect provide Scream Tail with recovery, with the latter also scouting Choice-locked Pokemon such as Dragapult and Kartana. Dazzling Gleam punishes Great Tusk and Iron Valiant and prevents them from freely exploiting Scream Tail. Encore pairs excellently with Scream Tail's high Speed, allowing it to shut down setup sweepers such as Urshifu-R, Cresselia, and Garchomp for its teammates to defeat. Leftovers provides Scream Tail with recovery that makes it less susceptible to being exploited by Wish, granting Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Heatran free switches. The given EVs maximize Scream Tail's bulk while allowing it to outspeed Enamorus and shut down Calm Mind variants with Encore. An alternative spread of 120 HP / 236 SpD / 152 Spe can be used to outspeed Hydreigon while receiving a Special Defense boost in Mega Charizard Y's sun, further amplifying Scream Tail's bulk and allowing it to check Charizard under sun. Tera Steel grants a resistance to Ice- and Fairy-type attacks from Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant in a pinch, while Tera Fairy ensures Scream Tail resists Pursuit from Weavile and Mega Tyranitar and increases the power of Dazzling Gleam to potentially 2HKO and OHKO Garchomp and Iron Valiant, respectively. Scream Tail fits best on defensively oriented teams that appreciate its unique defensive attributes while being able to support it sufficiently in return. Pokemon with unreliable recovery such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Assault Vest Toxapex appreciate Scream Tail's high-HP Wishes, while in return they check Pokemon Scream Tail struggles with such as Mega Scizor and Volcarona. Due to its reliance on Protect and Leftovers for passive recovery, entry hazard control from teammates such as the aforementioned Great Tusk and Tornadus-T can help mitigate its recovery. Scream Tail's passive nature means it can be exploited by Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, so Pokemon that aid against them while providing a more dangerous presence such as Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Swords Dance Gliscor pair well with it.</p>"

Flutter Mane can handle Psychic-type foes such as Espathra and Hatterene, while Iron Valiant takes care of Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Flutter Mane can fall back on either Hatterene or Tinkaton when faced with an unfavorable matchup. Both of these Pokemon provide dependable defensive options and some type of entry hazard control, but Hatterene is particularly useful due to it breaking down walls like Dondozo and Clodsire. Flutter Mane also pairs well with setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Mimikyu, as it is able to poke holes in the opponent's team, allowing them to clean late-game. In return, Azumarill can take care of priority users, such as Ceruledge and Chien-Pao. In terms of support options, Flutter Mane can rely on Fairy's Prankster users, Klefki and Grimmsnarl, to set up dual screens, therefore allowing it to withstand hits such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Grimmsnarl can then bring in Flutter Mane relatively safely thanks to Parting Shot. Klefki's Spikes and Tinkaton's Stealth Rocks also support Flutter Mane in breaking its checks such as Iron Hands and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard stacking proves particularly useful against less bulky teams, as it highly limits their capacity to scout Flutter Mane without having to sacrifice a member in the process.</p>"

        "Choice Scarf (Ghost)": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is an incredibly potent revenge killer and late-game cleaner thanks to its strong STAB combination, solid coverage options, and blazing Speed tier. Notably, it outspeeds faster Pokemon like Dragapult, boosted threats such as Baxcalibur and Quaquaval, and Choice Scarf users like Greninja and Meowscarada, all of which can threaten the offensive teams that Flutter Mane is part of. Mystical Fire threatens Steel-types such as Corviknight and Iron Treads, while Psyshock revenge kills Choice Scarf Iron Moth and hits specially bulky Pokemon like Clodsire. Thunderbolt pressures Corviknight better and 2HKOes physically defensive Toxapex after Stealth Rock, while Energy Ball takes care of Gastrodon.</p> <p>Spikes from the likes of Brambleghast and Froslass are terrific support options, chipping down bulky foes like Toxapex and Ting-Lu that would otherwise switch into Flutter Mane freely. Thanks to Good as Gold blocking Defog and its Ghost-typing, Gholdengo is a notable partner to keep Spikes up. Brambleghast also helps threaten Gastrodon and provides Rapid Spin support as well. Wallbreakers like Mimikyu and Gholdengo can pressure the opposition early-game, allowing for Flutter Mane to clean up late-game with ease; moreover, Mimikyu can overwhelm Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads with Drain Punch, while Gholdengo can make use of Trick to cripple walls like Clodsire and Corviknight. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Swords Dance Ceruledge are valuable teammates that function as back-up late-game cleaners, especially against types Flutter Mane can struggle with such as Poison and Steel. Moreover, Ceruledge and Mimikyu have the added benefit of safely revenge killing opposing fast threats Flutter Mane can't handle easily, like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Dragon Dance Dragapult, with Shadow Sneak. Skeledirge is a notable partner to compensate for Flutter Mane's lack of physical bulk, taking on Bullet Punch users like Scizor and Lucario as well as being fantastic in the Steel, Fighting, and Bug matchups.</p>"

        "Bulky Choice Specs (Fairy)": {
          "description": "<p>Bulky Choice Specs Flutter Mane serves as a strong specially offensive wallbreaker that can survive one hit from most unboosted physical attacks, such as Ting Lu's Heavy Slam and Baxcalibur's Icicle Crash, with relative safety. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to break through most Poison cores on its own with proper hazard support, most notably 2HKOing Clodsire, which otherwise walls it. Alternatively, Mystical Fire lets Flutter Mane break through defensive Steel-types like Iron Treads and and surprise more offensive Steel-types like Scizor behind Reflect, while Energy Ball targets would-be Rock-, Water-, and Ground-type walls like Garganacl and Gastrodon. The given EVs let Flutter Mane outspeed Spectrier, always survive +1 Dragonite's Earthquake, and almost always win the one-on-one matchup against Ting-Lu by having a 15/16 chance to survive its Heavy Slam and a 78% chance to 2HKO it with Moonblast in return after Leftovers recovery, using the minimum HP and Defense EVs possible.</p> <p>Bulky Choice Specs Flutter Mane takes advantage of its unexpected bulk to create surprise KOs, such as versus Dragon Dance Dragonite, while retaining its ability to remove key threats like Skeledirge, Corviknight, and Galarian Slowking. For this reason, setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Calm Mind Hatterene are strong partners, as they can take advantage of the holes that Flutter Mane creates in defensive cores. Iron Valiant is another strong partner, as it can take advantage of both the specially defensive Pokemon that Flutter Mane may not be able to remove, such as Hisuian Goodra, Alolan Muk, and Heatran, while creating a generally strong offensive core. As Flutter Mane is slower than Chien-Pao and opposing Flutter Mane, Choice Scarf Pokemon such as the Enamorus and the aforementioned Iron Valiant are necessary to handle these threats. Choice Scarf Enamorus in particular is a strong partner, as it can reduce the necessity of Flutter Mane on the field while threatening its own powerful late-game cleanup with Contrary Superpower, supporting its team with Healing Wish, and using Iron Head to KO opposing Flutter Mane after hazard chip; it also has the added benefit of having a stronger matchup versus Choice Scarf Meowscarada than Iron Valiant. On the other hand, Choice Scarf Iron Valiant is more immediately threatening with a Choice Scarf, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Iron Moth and Gengar, Chlorophyll Scovillain, and Slush Rush Cetitan, and OHKO threats that Enamorus could only dream of removing, such as Ice Shard Chien-Pao. Flutter Mane also struggles versus Steel-types like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Choice Scarf Iron Treads, so support from Klefki and Tinkaton, along with offensive checks like Azumarill, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus, allows Flutter Mane to break through these cores much more reliably. The Poison-type matchup is particularly difficult, so Steel-types like Klefki and Tinkaton and Magic Bounce support from Hatterene help Flutter Mane, as they can provide hazard support while blocking or punishing Toxic Spikes. In return, Flutter Mane can pressure Clodsire and Galarian Slowking and chip Alolan Muk by capitalizing on the lack of switch-ins to the combination of Psyshock, Moonblast, Shadow Ball, and entry hazards.</p>"

Moonblast threatens Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Darkrai, and Walking Wake. Energy Ball hits Ground- and Water-type foes such as Mamoswine, Dondozo, Gastrodon, and Quagsire. Thunderbolt nails Water-types like Pelipper, Toxapex, and Empoleon, allowing Flutter Mane to threaten every Water-type Pokemon super effectively in tandem with Energy Ball. Furthermore, Thunderbolt wards off Flying-types such as Corviknight and Moltres. The given EV spread permits Flutter Mane to take a Shadow Sneak from Life Orb Mimikyu, easing the Ghost matchup.</p> <p>Gholdengo is an excellent teammate, as it takes advantage of Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon like Sneasler, Empoleon, and Amoonguss for Nasty Plot setup, while in return Flutter Mane threatens Ground-types such as Sandy Shocks and Gastrodon. Focus Sash Ceruledge is a really good wallbreaker against Steel and Dark teams, easily taking out Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit. Colbur Berry Spectrier excels in the Poison and Fighting matchups, weakening shared checks like Assault Vest Iron Hands and specially defensive Toxapex using Will-O-Wisp as well as takes out potential revenge killers like Choice Scarf Roaring Moon with Draining Kiss. Additionally, Choice Scarf Spectrier is great in the Ghost mirror matchup, threatening Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Flutter Mane, appreciating Flutter Mane removing Dark-types like Hydreigon and Darkrai in return. Brambleghast and Froslass provide Spikes setup to push Flutter Mane's targets into OHKO ranges, while the former also applies additional pressure on Water and Ground teams. Skeledirge wears down teams by spreading Will-O-Wisp and bypassing Substitute with Torch Song, walling and shutting down setup Pokemon such as Zamazenta and Iron Hands. Hisuian Zoroark provides a Ghost-type immunity, switching into attacks from opposing Ceruledge and Flutter Mane as well as providing utility via Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off, weakening physical attackers that Flutter Mane is vulnerable to such as Clodsire, Corviknight, and Poison Jab Toxapex and rendering foes susceptible to Spikes. Dragapult provides utility via Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, hindering threats like Chien-Pao and opposing Flutter Mane. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Dragapult removes other Choice Scarf users like Meowscarada and Roaring Moon.</p>"

This is especially strong for winning Flutter Mane mirrors: if your Flutter Mane goes first, it can cushion even an opposing Choice Specs Shadow Ball with the Special Defense boost, then fire back next turn with a +1 Shadow Ball of its own.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Perish Song</strong>: This is an effective late-game win condition against a wide variety of Pokemon, and is one of the best ways to shut down Baton Pass foes like Espathra in the game.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Taunt and Thunder Wave</strong>: Taunt and Thunder Wave take advantage of Flutter Mane's incredible Speed to disrupt opposing setup strategies, though these options tend to be less reliable than Charm sets.</li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Flutter Mane's incredible Speed is put to good use, outspeeding almost everything in the metagame with the major exceptions being Booster Energy Iron Bundle and Choice Scarf Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: With Choice Specs, Flutter Mane becomes a potent wall breaker, 2HKOing almost anything that doesn't resist it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash patches up Flutter Mane's poor physical bulk, giving it new revenge kill chances.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Scarf's consistent Speed boost allows Flutter Mane to run EV spreads that give a better balance of bulk and power, since Speed no longer has to be the highest stat for Booster Energy boosts.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Flutter Mane benefits from Terastallization, it's generally flexible enough to go without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy makes Moonblast a potent sweeping move, while reducing damage against Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch and Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water has a niche for giving a resistance to Steel, Ice, and Fire, giving improved matchups against Scizor, Ting-Lu, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal is a purely defensive option, ridding Flutter Mane of its troublesome Ghost-type weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives Flutter Mane a resistance to Steel, most notably living Scizor's Bullet Punch. It also boosts the power of Mystical Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost powering up Shadow Ball can be a devastating surprise against bulky Fairy resistances such as Iron Moth.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li>Flutter Mane's lack of physical bulk makes it extremely vulnerable to getting revenge killed, so consider these alternative EV spreads if a simple offensive spread is not working well.

If outspeeding Timid Chi-Yu and Jolly Garchomp is more important, Flutter Mane can use Timid instead of Bold at the cost of some bulk against priority.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>116 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 132 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Jolly Roaring Moon and survives an opposing Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball without Terastallization.

It features as a prominent Dragon-type switch-in on teams that forgo Zacian-C or Arceus-Fairy, which is especially helpful for Miraidon. Its Normal- and Fighting-type immunities come in handy for both Koraidon and Extreme Killer Arceus. It should be noted, however, that switching into these is very high-risk, high-reward, as while Flutter Mane can take great advantage of its immunities, a wrong prediction will result in an easy OHKO for the opponent.</li> <li>Flutter Mane's extremely threatening nature and low defenses mean that it often forces a reactionary Tera from the opponent, often Tera Fire from Koraidon or Zacian-C or Tera Poison from Arceus formes.

Dazzling Gleam is a source of reliable spread damage that Flutter Mane can use late-game to clean up heavily weakened foes or to provide the chip damage its teammates need to secure KOs.</p> </li> <li> <p>The HP and Defense EVs allow Flutter Mane to survive a Tera Dark Black Glasses Kingambit's Sucker Punch. The Speed EVs with the Timid nature provide enough Speed to outrun Tornadus, as well as making Protosynthesis boost Speed. When Booster Energy activates Protosynthesis, Flutter Mane will outspeed all unboosted Pokemon with the exception of the uncommon Regieleki.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Fairy can be used to amplify the wallbreaking power of Flutter Mane's Fairy STAB attacks. It can also be used to gain a resistance to Dark-type attacks, most notably Sucker Punch from the Dark-type powerhouses Kingambit and Chien-Pao. Tera Ghost allows Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball to get the OHKO on Basculegion-F and opposing bulky Flutter Mane. Defensively, it allows Flutter Mane to lose its commonly targeted weakness to Steel-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flutter Mane's Ghost typing can often be very valuable for its immunity to Normal-type attacks, particularly against Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite that are looking to lock into Extreme Speed, so it's sometimes valuable to preserve this and avoid Terastallizing Flutter Mane into a pure Fairy-type.</p> </li> <li> <p>As Booster Energy is a consumable held item, it's important to be careful about when Flutter Mane is brought in for the first time, to take advantage of the Speed boost. This means leading with Booster Energy Flutter Mane is often ill advised against teams with fast Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and common Choice Scarf users like Basculegion-F, as it may need to preserve the Speed boost until the right moment to pressure these fast Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Against bulky teams with slower Pokemon, Flutter Mane can usually afford to be less cautious with the timing of its Booster Energy use, as it will outspeed many Pokemon without its Protosynthesis active. However, it is very notable that with the Speed boost Flutter Mane is capable of outspeeding many of these slower Pokemon even when they are supported by Tailwind, which can be key tool in these matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p>With the damage output of this set being lower compared to the common Choice Specs, Booster Energy Flutter Mane isn't often getting OHKOs. This means it trades poorly with some of the tier's bulkier Pokemon such as common Assault Vest users like Rillaboom and Iron Hands, if they're still healthy. Because of this, Flutter Mane often wants to come in on weakened foes to pick them off safely using its Speed advantage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mane can find a spot on practically any style of team. Common checks to Flutter Mane include bulky Fairy-resisting Pokemon such as Volcanion, Heatran, and Amoonguss, which can comfortably take Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball. The former two often aim to respond with their Steel-type attacks, while the latter can shut down Flutter Mane with Spore. One option to handle these is Landorus-T, which threatens the Fire-types with a super effective Stomping Tantrum and shuts down Amoonguss with Taunt. With Stealth Rock, Landorus-T can also significantly weaken Volcanion each time it switches in and chip other foes to put them in Flutter Mane's KO range. Landorus-T's Intimidate also helps Flutter Mane take physical attacks better, as it has very low Defense.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chi-Yu is another strong partner for Flutter Mane. Chi-Yu's Beads Of Ruin boosts Flutter Mane's damage output, as well as Chi-Yu threatening Rillaboom and Amoonguss with powerful Fire-type attacks. In addition, Chi-Yu can use Snarl to make Flutter Mane extremely difficult to take down with special attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Two other attack options are Hex and Icy Wind. Hex, as an alternative to Shadow Ball, can be used on teams with abundant status options, such as Glimmora's Toxic Debris, Amoonguss's Spore, and Thundurus's Thunder Wave. Icy Wind on the other hand is a dynamic speed control option with which the high Speed Flutter Mane supports its slower teammates.</p> </li> </ul>"

At +2, Flutter Mane is capable of 2HKOing even Ice Scales Arceus formes with Astral Barrage. Due to Flutter Mane's naturally low HP stat, Pain Split is an effective way to increase its longevity while notably annoying Chansey and being ineffective for Imposter users. Tera Fairy boosts Moonblast's damage while shedding Flutter Mane's Ghost weakness, making it useful against Knock Off and stray Ghost-type moves. Tera Ghost further boosts Astral Barrage, helping Flutter Mane break past walls like Calm Mind Ice Scales Arceus formes, and helps defensively against Dialga-O's Revelation Dance. Tera Steel prevents potential revenge killing from Iron Bundle's Boomburst and Koraidon's Gigaton Hammer, as well as resisting Dialga-O's Revelation Dance. Flutter Mane pairs very well with other special attackers, such as Palkia-O, Eternatus, and setup Arceus formes, that place heavy pressure on opposing special walls like Chansey and Ice Scales Dialga-O. Setup Arceus formes can also inflict Chansey with poison using Toxic or Mortal Spin, greatly increasing Flutter Mane's capability of stalling it out of recovery. Defensive pivots like Ting-Lu can provide entry hazard support, deny momentum from Chansey, and pivot Flutter Mane in safely. Paralysis support from the likes of Ting-Lu can also slow down the troublesome Zacian, which outspeeds and threatens Flutter Mane. Imposter-proof Flutter Mane with a special wall with a relatively low HP stat like Ice Scales Zacian, though your Chansey can also Imposter-proof it at the risk of providing Pain Split healing for the opposing Imposter.</p>"

Trick is an alternative to cripple special walls like Chansey for teammates. Tera Fairy further boosts Boomburst's damage output, letting it 2HKO Ice Scales Zacian, as well as 2HKOing Ice Scales Dialga-O and Arceus formes after 1 layer of Spikes. Flutter Mane greatly appreciates Knock Off support from teammates like Ting-Lu to remove items like Assault Vest, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Chansey's Eviolite to enhance its offensive potential. Entry hazards and paralysis support from the likes of Ting-Lu and Dialga-O help chip down special walls into 2HKO range and neutralize faster threats like Zacian, respectively. Other special attackers like Palkia-O and Eternatus can capitalize on crippled special walls from Flutter Mane's Trick. Flutter Mane can be easily Imposter-proofed by your own Chansey, but a Ground-type like Ice Scales Arceus-Ground can deny momentum from the Imposter user's Volt Switch.</p>"

        "Offensive Pivot": {
          "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks can work as an excellent pivot on offensive teams, leveraging its high Speed and Special Attack to confound switch-ins with Volt Switch, which significantly chips even most Electric-resistant foes like Dragapult and Breloom and allows for a powerful teammate like Meowscarada to be brought in safely. Tera Fairy Tera Blast also provides Sandy Shocks with incredible coverage alongside its STAB moves, threatening Pokemon such as defensive Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Dragapult that are otherwise mostly satisfactory switch-ins and that threaten Sandy Shocks out in turn. In particular, Great Tusk goes from an adequate check to being cleanly OHKOed by Tera Blast assuming it is safe to stay in. Tera Fairy also lets Sandy Shocks resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Stealth Rock and Spikes both provide invaluable entry hazard support for Sandy Shocks and its teammates to wear down counters, while Thunderbolt is a solid option to maintain an Electric-type STAB move without being forced to switch out, especially when it can immediately threaten a KO late-game on chipped targets like Slowking and Rotom-W. With 252 Speed EVs, even a Modest Sandy Shocks still crucially outpaces all variants of Great Tusk, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W; a Timid nature can be run instead to also outpace Hydreigon at the cost of some power. When it comes to the item slot, Heavy-Duty Boots is perhaps the most straightforward item for Sandy Shocks, as being a pivot, Sandy Shocks gaining an immunity to hazards, which allows it to come in and wreak havoc many more times per game. However, Expert Belt provides a much-appreciated power boost, especially when going Modest for extra damage, since Sandy Shocks's Electric + Ground + Fairy coverage hits nearly the entire metagame super effectively. In particular, it guarantees that Earth Power will always 2HKO Clodsire and guarantees the OHKO on bulky Kingambit.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks shines on momentum-based bulky offense teams, so other Pokemon that can maintain momentum such as Choice item Dragapult, Meowscarada, Slowking, Rotom-W, and Scizor, as well as Eject Button users like offensive Great Tusk are good teammates. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Meowscarada, Garchomp, and Great Tusk is also excellent, since the hazard chip will stack with the numerous switches forced by Sandy Shocks. Additional Stealth Rock users in particular are appreciated because they free Sandy Shocks's fourth moveslot up to run Spikes or Thunderbolt more freely. Meowscarada is an excellent choice with several of its sets, as its Knock Off removes the Heavy-Duty Boots that Sandy Shocks's switch-ins rely on to not get worn down by hazards, it can set hazards itself, its U-turn forms the potent VoltTurn combination with Sandy Shocks, and its Flower Trick is extremely threatening to the Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu that can tank Sandy Shocks's Volt Switch assault. If not running Heavy-Duty Boots, Sandy Shocks can be worn down itself by Spikes, minimizing its effectiveness, and so hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight form prurient teammates. Sandy Shocks's relative frailty and weakness-laden typing means that faster Pokemon like Meowscarada, Garchomp, Dragapult, Cinderace, and Walking Wake, as well as Choice Scarf users such as specific variants of Rotom-W and Gholdengo, can immediately force Sandy Shocks out, lest its meager bulk causes it to be unceremoniously OHKOed. Strong priority moves like Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet present similar issues. As such, additional, more defensive pivots such as the aforementioned Corviknight and Rotom-W serve double duty, as they can act as a buffer against these threats without completely ceding momentum.</p>"

        "Booster Energy": {
          "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks's appeal comes from its high Special Attack and ability to come in at +1 Speed with Booster Energy to pressure common spinners, letting it be one of the best offensive entry hazard setters in the tier. With the lack of reliable Ground-resistant Pokemon, Earth Power becomes incredibly spammable, targeting opposing hazard setters like Glimmora, Garganacl, Iron Treads, Torkoal, and Iron Moth. Earth Power also deals massive damage to Great Tusk, limiting its spinning capabilities. Thunderbolt is an excellent second STAB move, as it targets Flying-types such as Corviknight, Pelipper, and Iron Jugulis, as well as heavily punishing Rotom-W. Thunderbolt also hits threatening Water-types, 2HKOing Azumarill, Dondozo, and Slowking while also OHKOing Greninja. Both of these STAB moves 2HKO Toxapex as well. Stealth Rock or Spikes are very useful on Sandy Shocks because it threatens out almost every entry hazard remover, namely Great Tusk, Torkoal, Corviknight, Cinderace, Glimmora, and Talonflame. Tera Fairy Tera Blast is the perfect coverage tool for Sandy Shocks because it targets threats that would normally wall it, such as Hydreigon and Meowscarada, and it can land surprise KOs on would-be switch-ins like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Roaring Moon while also 2HKOing Garchomp. The Fairy typing has great defensive utility as well, resisting priority moves such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit and Meowscarada and Mach Punch from Breloom.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Its ability to immediately get up entry hazards and threaten other hazard setters is instrumental for the success of hyper offense, and not activating Glimmora's Toxic Debris in the hyper offense mirror match is very useful. On bulky offense teams, it can offer more flexibility, setting up hazards and pressuring opposing defensive cores. With its great Speed stat after a Protosynthesis boost, Sandy Shocks threatens offensive Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed it like Dragapult. It also forces damage on bulkier Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Rotom-W, so teammates such as Iron Moth and Dragonite that appreciate these being weakened work best. Ground-immune teammates like Dragonite and Rotom-W also help Sandy Shocks on bulky offense teams, switching into foes like Great Tusk. Opposing Meowscarada is problematic for this set, as it essentially forces it to Terastallize, so teammates that can handle it like Kingambit and Iron Valiant are also very useful. Amoonguss can generally take advantage of Sandy Shocks too, threatening Spore on teammates, so Gholdengo is another great teammate; it also blocks Rapid Spin and Defog.</p>"

Earth Power targets Rock-, Steel, and Fire-types, OHKOing the likes of Iron Moth and Excadrill while dealing significant damage to foes like Mega Tyranitar. Spikes can be used to chip down foes, though it forces Sandy Shocks out after using it, making it risky against setup sweepers. Alternatively, Power Gem deals super effective damage to Thundurus and Thundurus-T and chips Hydreigon. Sandy Shocks can pair excellently with other entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Mega Tyranitar, and Skarmory, as they help it guarantee a 2HKO on foes such as defensive Celesteela after Stealth Rock chip, and they can also wear down checks like Tapu Bulu and Hippowdon for it. In return, Sandy Shocks can spread hazards alongside them while also threatening removal options like Tapu Fini and Excadrill.

        "Gravity (Ground)": {
          "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks is an incredibly useful part of any Ground team thanks to its combination of being able to threaten common types that Ground struggles against such as Flying and Water and good team support in Gravity, making its teammates' and its Ground STAB attacks more threatening without any Ground-immune Pokemon. Its Speed tier is also good enough to outspeed Urshifu-R, a big threat to Ground-type teams, while allowing Ground teams to muscle past Moltres Flying teams, which can outlast Ground teams. Gravity not only allows it to hit Flying types such as Thundurus-T and Zapdos that don't care about its Electric STAB moves, but it also lets its teammates such as Landorus, Ursaluna, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk spam their Ground-type attacks without worrying about Ground-immune Pokemon. While Gravity is certainly useful, it comes with the drawback that opposing Ground-type moves from Pokemon such as Landorus-T or Iron Treads cannot be avoided. Earth Power is its Ground STAB attack, which also benefits from the Gravity that Sandy Shocks sets up and hits Electric-immune Pokemon such as Clodsire and Quagsire hard. This, along with Thunderbolt, allows Sandy Shocks to threaten the whole of Water teams. Finally, Volt Switch lets Sandy Shocks pivot out into a teammate that can either take an attack for it or deal big damage. Heavy-Duty Boots is Sandy Shocks's item of choice, allowing it to switch in multiple times to set Gravity and pivot out with Volt Switch without worrying about residual hazard damage. An alternative EV spread of 48 HP / 208 SpA / 252 Spe can be used for a Speed-boosting Protosynthesis, but this spread worsens the chance of a 2HKO on Quagsire.</p> <p>Landorus is a great teammate for Sandy Shocks, as Landorus's already-scary STAB- and Sheer Force-boosted Earth Power gets even scarier when almost nothing is immune to it. Additionally, Landorus can take Ground-type attacks aimed at Sandy Shocks by virtue of its Flying typing while hitting Grass- and Fairy-types hard with Sheer Force-boosted Sludge Bomb. In return, Sandy Shocks can pivot Landorus in using Volt Switch, as well as offensively threatening Water-types that threaten Landorus such as Urshifu-R. Ursaluna is another good teammate, as it is simply terrifying when Flying-types cannot safely switch into its Earthquake alongside being able to smash Grass-types with Fire Punch and crush Ghost-types with the sheer power of its Guts-boosted Earthquakes and its ability to deal with Spectrier thanks to Guts. Additionally, Ursaluna's bulk lets it take a hit when it switches in through Sandy Shocks' Volt Switch. Great Tusk provides Rapid Spin support on Bulk Up sets and speed control by virtue of its Choice Scarf set alongside Ice Spinner to help Sandy Shocks deal with opposing Landorus and Grass-types such as Hisuian Lilligant. Additionally, Great Tusk's power under Gravity cannot be understated, as its Ground STAB moves deal serious damage and can easily break through opposing teams. Clodsire can take Grass- and Fighting-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Flower Trick and Zamazenta’s Close Combat with ease alongside forming a chip damage core with Sandy Shocks through Volt Switch and Toxic damage. Additionally, Clodsire's Water immunity lets it soak up attacks such as Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Basculegion-F's Water STAB move of choice, and it is generally a rather good special wall. Quagsire is a good defensive partner for Sandy Shocks, as it can wall Chien-Pao and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and threaten them back with Body Press, as well as being able to set hazards. Iron Treads functions as a check to Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Flutter Mane who can take Sandy Shocks' attacks and threaten it back while also having Ice-type coverage to hit Flying- and Grass-types. Alongside those attributes, Iron Treads also has Knock Off, allowing it to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from common users such as Quagsire and Amoonguss, letting Sandy Shocks gradually wear them down over the course of the game. Finally, Ting-Lu's sheer bulk allows it to take strong hits such as Dragonite's boosted Extreme Speed that Sandy Shocks can't while setting up hazards to chip away at common answers to Sandy Shocks such as opposing Ting-Lu.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks functions as a great offensive pivot thanks to its excellent offensive typing and ability to set entry hazards. Volt Switch lets Sandy Shocks pivot out of problematic matchups such as RegenVest Roaring Moon and Meloetta. Stealth Rock and Spikes allow Sandy Shocks to set up hazards against foes like Corviknight, Manaphy, and Zapdos, which are normally forced to switch out. Choice Scarf helps Sandy Shocks with its average Speed, turning it into a revenge killer and letting it outpace and OHKO other revenge killers like Barraskewda, Chien-Pao, and Iron Moth, while Heavy-Duty Boots lets it come in safely more often and also does not lock it into a move. Sandy Shocks forms great VoltTurn cores, so other offensive pivots such as Barraskewda, Meowscarada, and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon are great teammates. Stronger wallbreakers like Walking Wake and Gengar appreciate Sandy Shocks's ability to chip down special walls such as Empoleon, RegenVest Manaphy, and Hisuian Goodra, which gives them an easier time breaking through these foes. Sandy Shocks is completely walled by the likes of Landorus, Iron Treads, and Volt Absorb Corviknight, so physical wallbreakers like Ogerpon-C and Chien-Pao are helpful in order to pressure them. Sandy Shocks is vulnerable to faster revenge killers like Barraskewda and Chien-Pao if it's not running Choice Scarf, meaning that defensive pivots like Corviknight and Manaphy are appreciated as well.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Immunity ability Sandy Shocks is a decent physical tank when it gets going due to its access to Iron Defense + Body Press and utility like Spikes. Iron Defense allows it to defend itself from common physical attackers like Great Tusk and Ogerpon-H, and Body Press threatens Electric-immune Pokemon like Volt Absorb Empoleon and Corviknight, as well as Motor Drive Manaphy. However, Spikes + Earth Power is an alternative to Iron Defense + Body Press, as it provides entry hazard utility and a secondary STAB move option. Substitute takes advantage of the free turns it can generate with its immunity ability and can block status from slower walls. Since Sandy Shocks doesn't have any form of reliable recovery, Leftovers is the preferred item. The ability choice comes down to team need; Earth Eater punishes Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Garchomp, while Water Absorb is an excellent check to Barraskewda and Zapdos that also can block pivoting from Empoleon. Sandy Shocks works well on hyper and bulky offense, as it can set up easier and can counter passive walls. Therefore, Pokemon that appreciate this ability like Chien-Pao and Dragonite make for good teammates. Despite its ability to increase its physical bulk, it is very vulnerable on the special side, making Pokemon like Gengar and Iron Moth threatening foes. Because of this, Pokemon like RegenVest Roaring Moon and Manaphy make for good teammates.</p>"

Earthquake hits Skeledirge, Toxapex, Garganacl, Gholdengo, Glimmora, and Kingambit super effectively, while Iron Head hits Hatterene, Iron Valiant, and Tera Fairy Garganacl super effectively. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can turn Iron Treads into a fast hazard setter that exerts offensive pressure. Knock Off provides utility in removing Leftovers from Dondozo, Rotom-W, and Corviknight. Rapid Spin provides the most utility, as it keeps entry hazards clear to better help its teammates switch in without fearing chip damage. Booster Energy allows Iron Treads to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, notably outspeeding fast threats such as +1 Dragonite, Dragapult, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Meowscarada, and Iron Valiant. A Ground Tera Type is ideal to maximize Earthquake's damage output against Garganacl, Dragapult, Skeledirge, and Volcarona while removing its weakness to Fire.

It faces stronger competition from its counterpart, Great Tusk, due to the latter's typing, better physical bulk, better Attack, and a wider movepool. However, Iron Treads stands out due to its faster Speed and its access to Volt Switch, which allows it to serve as a fast offensive pivot. With Stealth Rock, Iron Treads can wear down Pokemon that dislike entry hazards like Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Booster Energy Iron Moth, limiting their opportunities to switch in. Rapid Spin allows Iron Treads to remove hazards from its side while also boosting its Speed, allowing it to threaten Pokemon that would normally outspeed it like Cinderace. Volt Switch not only allows Iron Treads to perform as a pivot but also deals super effective damage to Flying-types like Corviknight and Tera Flying Kingambit. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to remove important items such as Leftovers from defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Garganacl as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon vulnerable to hazards such as Dragonite and Skeledirge. Knock Off also allows Iron Treads to deal super effective damage to Air Balloon Gholdengo. Tera Flying completely removes Iron Treads's weakness to Ground-types and turns it into an immunity, allowing it to switch into Great Tusk. Leftovers grants Iron Treads a form of longevity so it can find more opportunities to pivot into teammates. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used as well to help Iron Treads pivot more consistently into teammates while not getting worn down from hazards.</p> <p>Iron Treads fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its offensive utility in order for their team members to function in their roles more effectively.

Garchomp, Meowscarada, and Greninja make for great partners, since the three of them can stack Spikes with Iron Treads to wear down incoming foes into KO range from one of the team's offensive Pokemon. If Iron Treads is running Volt Switch, it could have a hard time pivoting into its teammates, since Ground-types like Great Tusk and Garchomp can switch into it if its predicted. Hence, teammates that can handle Ground-types like Rotom-W pair well with Iron Treads. Lastly, sweepers such as Walking Wake, Dragonite, and Azumarill appreciate Iron Treads bringing them to sweep.

Steel Beam allows Iron Treads to sacrifice itself quickly in order to deny Defog attempts from the likes of Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W. It is also Iron Treads's main tool of pressuring Hatterene, and it is generally powerful enough to chunk certain Ground-resistant and immune Pokemon, like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Buzzwole.

Tera Ghost allows Iron Treads to block opposing Rapid Spin attempts from Great Tusk if necessary. Iron Treads should be used as a lead on hyper offense teams, so other support teammates and sweepers are natural partners. Dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko allow their sweeping teammates another layer of support and safety, and they can use Taunt to consistently deny Defog attempts even after Iron Treads has fainted. Common hyper offense sweepers, like Mega Gyarados, Galarian Moltres, Kingambit, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur appreciate Iron Treads laying Stealth Rock while keeping hazards off at the same time.

Iron Treads can opt to be a hazard setter itself with Stealth Rock, keep up momentum with Volt Switch on targets like Corviknight, or use Heavy Slam as a strong STAB option for Scream Tail and Chien-Pao. Levitate allows Iron Treads to be immune to Spikes while also being able to spin them away, whereas Earth Eater can be used as an alternative for better longevity against hazard setters like Garchomp and Smack Down Landorus-T. Offensive Pokemon that are weak to hazards such as Chien-Pao and Thundurus-T appreciate Iron Treads's ability to keep hazards off the field, as well as being able to pivot them in safely with Volt Switch. Strong physical attackers like Galarian Zapdos and Kingambit also are good teammates for Iron Treads, as they can more easily break through Corviknight with Knock Off support from Iron Treads. Iron Treads can be overwhelmed by coverage options from hazard setters such as Liquidation Garchomp, so running Wish Scream Tail, which can increase Iron Treads's longevity, or a secondary hazard remover like Corviknight and Quaquaval, which can also stave off hits, is recommended. Iron Treads is also vulnerable to strong Fighting-type attackers such as Galarian Zapdos and Slither Wing, so it is advised to pair it with a Fighting-resistant teammate such as Scream Tail or Fluffy Zapdos.</p>"

If there is already a Stealth Rock user on the team, Iron Treads can instead use Heavy Slam to check Calm Mind Scream Tail and Enamorus-T, Rock Slide to OHKO Talonflame and Volcarona, or Volt Switch to bring in teammates safely. 236 Speed EVs are used to outspeed and threaten an OHKO on Jolly Hisuian Arcanine. Pixilate Scream Tail and Primordial Sea users like Inteleon, Greninja, and Quaquaval all appreciate Iron Treads switching into their checks in Desolate Land Fire-types like Iron Moth and Ceruledge. Physical wallbreakers like Chien-Pao and Hisuian Arcanine appreciate Iron Treads removing items from shared switch-ins like Corviknight and Quaquaval. Fighting- and Ground- types like Galarian Zapdos, Slither Wing, and Garchomp threaten Iron Treads, so defensive partners like Scream Tail, Quaquaval, and Corviknight are recommended. Iron Treads's Rapid Spin also supports the hazard stacking effort from partners like Garchomp and Ting-Lu. Certain Fire-types like Cinderace and Ceruledge can still threaten Iron Treads with their coverage moves, so it appreciates a secondary check to them like Primordial Sea Zapdos.</p>"

          "description": "<p>On account of its enormous stats, offensive typing, and diverse attacking options in conjunction with Swords Dance, Iron Hands makes for a powerful offensive tank on a variety of teams. At high HP, it is bulky enough to survive attacks from faster revenge killers such as Excadrill, Latios, and Psychic Thundurus-T while also being able to trade with defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Magic Guard Clefable, and Gastrodon after a boost. Added onto this, Iron Hands's resistances can also allow it to check physical threats such as both Tyranitar formes and Bisharp when needed. Thunder Punch is normally used for its consistency, but Wild Charge is an alternative with a higher Base Power, most notably improving damage rolls against threats such as Ceruledge and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini unboosted while also allowing it to power through defensive stalwarts such as Mega Sableye more easily at +2, albeit at the cost of recoil. Drain Punch, aside from being a consistent secondary STAB option, also provides recovery against Pokemon that Iron Hands may stay in against, such as Tyranitar and Gastrodon, and avoids dropping Iron Hands's defenses for dealing with subsequent attacks. Alternatively, Close Combat provides a stronger option that has a chance of breaking through specific defensive Pokemon, such as 2HKOing Quagsire after slight chip damage. Ice Punch provides Iron Hands with coverage against targets that would otherwise resist its attacking combination, such as Mega Latias, Thundurus-T, and Amoonguss, while Earthquake can be used to 2HKO Skeledirge, in addition to OHKOing most opposing Iron Hands at +2. Substitute, despite the opportunity cost, is an interesting option that can allow Iron Hands to avoid status from Pokemon otherwise reliant on doing so to cripple it, like Mega Sableye and Gastrodon. The given EVs specifically allow Iron Hands to OHKO Slowbro at +2 with a Punching Glove-boosted Thunder Punch while outspeeding uninvested Clefable, with the rest of the EVs allocated into Special Defense to improve its ability to take special hits from attackers like Iron Moth, Clefable, and Thundurus-T. When using Leftovers, a minimum of 16 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature should be used instead to guarantee an OHKO on Excadrill with Drain Punch. Iron Hands pairs remarkably well with frailer offensive teammates that can take advantage of the gaping holes it can threaten to leave early on; chief among these are fast late-game cleaners such as Autotomize Celesteela, Booster Energy Iron Moth, and Swords Dance Ceruledge, which each appreciate Iron Hands's ability to weaken teams filled with bulky Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Hippowdon lacking Whirlwind, and Mega Tyranitar. In return, these Pokemon can also deal with several of the faster Pokemon used to force out Iron Hands, like Latios and Enamorus, allowing it to preserve its bulk into more useful situations. Similarly, Iron Hands can struggle to preserve its HP when subjected to chip damage overtime, like Spikes from Skarmory. Thus, Pokemon that can prevent or clear entry hazards, such as Tapu Fini and Excadrill are incredibly valuable to have as teammates—Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain support also helps shield Iron Hands from potential status elements. Other pivots such as Cinderace and Slowbro are similarly effective at allowing Iron Hands to have safe switch-in opportunities into Pokemon that it can force out, such as Tyranitar. Slowbro can also utilize Future Sight to compensate for Iron Hands's difficulties getting past faster physical walls, such as Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur.</p>"

        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Band Iron Hands makes the most of its colorful coverage options to be an effective wallbreaker. Ice Punch cleanly OHKOes Salamence, preventing it from chipping Iron Hands down via Wild Charge recoil and Roost, while also dealing significant damage to other Dragon-types like Latios, Latias, and Mega Altaria. Earthquake severely dents Skeledirge and OHKOes Victini. Alternatively, Heavy Slam can be used to OHKO physically defensive Clefable, preventing it from being able to safely scout Iron Hands. The given EV spread maximizes Iron Hands’s wallbreaking power while allowing it to outrun uninvested Skarmory. Choice Band Iron Hands fits best on bulkier teams that need a strong wallbreaker against defensive cores while also providing residual defensive utility in being able to slow down specific wallbreakers on more offensively-oriented teams, such as Galarian Zapdos and Bisharp, when necessary. Bulky teammates commonly featured on these teams, such as Skarmory, Slowking, and Amoonguss, each appreciate Iron Hands's ability to directly threaten several Pokemon used to take advantage of them, such as Celesteela and Mega Tyranitar. Slowking is also able to use Future Sight to dissuade the likes of Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur for Iron Hands. As Iron Hands lacks the longevity to batter away at and trade with defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth and is somewhat prediction-reliant, entry hazard support from the likes of Hippowdon, Jirachi, and Iron Moth can help Iron Hands in breaking through these Pokemon more effectively. More offensive teammates such as Latios and Mega Aerodactyl can be similarly effective in providing additional forms of offensive pressure to punish these Pokemon. Iron Hands's lack of defensive investment also makes it more vulnerable to revenge killers such as Enamorus, Latios, and Excadrill, and it can also struggle to check the likes of Scizor long-term, particularly fearing the loss of its item in the process. Thus, specific answers to these respective Pokemon, such as Cinderace, Celesteela, and Mandibuzz, are highly useful to help keep them in check offensively.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Iron Hands is a potent wincon, using its amazing bulk in conjunction with its perfect coverage to punch holes in faster teams that lack the means to consistently wall it and trade extremely well. Wild Charge and Close Combat are higher power options over Thunder Punch and Drain Punch that allow for a few notable benchmarks, such as having a chance to 2HKO Tera Water Skeledirge and OHKOing defensive Rotom-W after Stealth Rock and a Swords Dance, but they both greatly sacrifice longevity. Ice Punch lets it nail Ground-, Flying- and Dragon-types that resist its STAB combination such as Landorus-T, Dragonite, Zapdos, and Great Tusk. Tera Water lets Iron Hands gain a much stronger defensive type overall, preventing Ground-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types from revenge killing it while improving the rain matchup significantly. The given EV spread allows Iron Hands to KO Tapu Lele with Thunder Punch after a Swords Dance and outspeed Chansey, with the rest dumped into Special Defense to maximize its lower special bulk. Entry hazard support from Garchomp, Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, and Mega Diancie is crucial to Iron Hands, as it quickly wears down all of its checks for it to clean late-game. Future Sight support is also notable, as it allows Iron Hands to bypass would-be checks such as Buzzwole and Skeledirge. Pivots such as Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T also work well with Iron Hands, as they bring it in safely and prevent it from being worn down quickly. Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain also activates Iron Hands's Quark Drive, boosting its Attack even further. Due to its great defensive utility, it partners well with Pokemon like Slowbro and Dragapult, as it takes advantage of Dark-types that pressure these two out, with Slowbro providing Future Sight support and Dragapult taking advantage of Iron Hands’s checks like Buzzwole and Skeledirge. Due to its lack of longevity, it is a poor singular check to threats such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Kartana, so pairing it up with Pokemon like tank Garchomp, Tapu Fini, and Rotom-W to form defensive a defensive core works wonders.</p>"

Trick Room support from Porygon2 and Diancie is appreciated, as Iron Hands is slower than the majority of the metagame bar Amoonguss and Torkoal. Amoonguss's Pollen Puff can greatly bolster Iron Hands's longevity, while it appreciates Iron Hand's ability to pressure Chi-Yu and Chien-Pao in return. Fire-types like Volcanion and Entei offer a resistance to Fairy and a means to deal with Amoonguss, which Iron Hands greatly benefits from. Rillaboom can form a double Fake Out core with Iron Hands and acts as a solid Flutter Mane check and a source of passive recovery via Grassy Surge.</p> </li> </ul>"

Hurricane destroys many offensive Pokemon that can take Dark Pulse, including Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Quaquaval, and Volcarona. Taunt allows Iron Jugulis to function as a dangerous stallbreaker by shutting down passive walls such as Clodsire, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. It also prevents Slowking from pivoting with Chilly Reception and threats such as Dragonite, Volcarona, Polteageist, and Roaring Moon from setting up. Flamethrower hits Steel-types such as Corviknight, Kingambit, and Iron Treads. Fire Blast trades some of Flamethrower's accuracy for more power, most notably OHKOing the aforementioned Steel-types with Tera Fire. Alternatively, Earth Power OHKOes Iron Moth and lands a stronger hit on Clodsire, Garganacl, Cinderace, Iron Hands, and Toxapex. Tera Dark boosts the power of Dark Pulse, making it easier to pressure walls such as Garganacl, Rotom-W, and Toxapex with its flinch chance. Tera Flying strengthens Hurricane, OHKOing Greninja, Amoonguss, and Cinderace most of the time and 2HKOing Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge. Tera Fire strengthens Flamethrower or Fire Blast and gives Iron Jugulis crucial resistances to Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Iron Jugulis is best used on hyper offense teams that appreciate its ability to trouble stall teams and keep fast sweepers in check. Due to its only decent power, Iron Jugulis greatly appreciates entry hazards from teammates such as Glimmora, Greninja, Meowscarada, and Garchomp to wear down its checks. Additionally, Iron Jugulis's Stealth Rock weakness makes entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads very valuable partners; they can also pressure Clodsire and Iron Moth to free up Iron Jugulis to run a Fire-type move. Powerful wallbreakers such as Breloom and Dragapult can soften up the opposing team for Iron Jugulis to clean up late-game. Conversely, Iron Jugulis's ability to break through special walls with Taunt opens up other special sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth. Gholdengo can also cripple walls with Choice item + Trick and handle Booster Energy Iron Valiant, one of the only threats capable of outspeeding and threatening Iron Jugulis. Iron Jugulis is also effective on rain teams, providing it with a perfectly-accurate Hurricane and featuring extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Floatzel and Walking Wake that can punch holes for it to sweep late-game.

          "description": "<p>Iron Moth fills its role on Poison teams as an offensive powerhouse and potent revenge killer thanks to its high Speed, great Special Attack, and wide movepool of devastating options to blast any obstacle with. Its STAB Flamethrower melts through Steel-types such as Corviknight, Scizor, and Gholdengo that its teammates are unable to handle. Discharge eviscerates Flying- and Water-types like Pelipper, Talonflame, and Toxapex. Dazzling Gleam fells the mighty Dark- and Dragon-types of the tier such as Hydreigon, Sableye, and Dragapult. For its last moveslot, Energy Ball is a nice option in the Ground matchup, being able to threaten Quagsire, Great Tusk, and Sandy Shocks along with hitting Rotom-W in the Water- and Electric-type matchups, while U-turn allows Iron Moth to safely pivot out of unfavorable matchups against Tyranitar and Dragonite and pairs nicely with Poison's Regenerator Pokemon. Fiery Dance can be an alternative to Flamethrower, with its Special Attack boosting capabilities pairing nicely with Choice Scarf to make Iron Moth unstoppable.</p> <p>Iron Moth greatly appreciates bulky teammates like Amoonguss and Skuntank providing safe switches against threats that are either bulky enough to survive Iron Moth's attacks, like Garchomp, Dondozo, and specially bulky Iron Treads, or threaten to outspeed and KO it, like Chien-Pao and Meowscarada. Physically bulky Amoonguss is Iron Moth's best friend, being able to take on nearly every physical attacker and Ground-type like Garchomp, Dondozo, Meowscarada, and Iron Hands thanks to its Ground neutrality, reliable recovery, and Spore. Physically bulky Toxapex handles most other physical threats Amoonguss is unable to, such as Chien-Pao and Ceruledge, while setting up Toxic Spikes. Specially bulky Skuntank provides a safe answer to bulky Psychic-types like Hatterene and Slowbro as well as Ghost-types like Flutter Mane and Gengar thanks to its high special bulk, good typing, and useful STAB moves. Specially defensive Clodsire provides entry hazard support with Stealth Rock, along with checking threats like Volcarona, Kilowattrel, and Blissey. Corrosion Glimmora can also provide hazard support and use Toxic to wear down opposing special walls like Clodsire, Iron Treads, Ting-Lu, and Iron Hands. Dry Skin Toxicroak deals with Barraskewda and Floatzel, which outspeed Iron Moth, along with switching into Aqua Jets from Belly Drum Azumarill thanks to its immunity to Water-type moves. It also checks many of the Dark-types Iron Moth can't handle, such as Ting-Lu, Tyranitar, and Kingambit, thanks to its Fighting-type STAB move of choice.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Scarf (Fire)": {
          "description": "<p>Iron Moth establishes itself as a premier Choice Scarf user on Fire teams, boosting its already good Speed stat in order to act as speed control to immediately threaten Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and Greninja as well as a late-game cleaner. Its wide array of coverage options, good STAB combination, and very high Special Attack make it a difficult Pokemon to answer. Dazzling Gleam allows Iron Moth to hit Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Hydreigon, while Discharge and Energy Ball both provide coverage against Water-types; Discharge covers targets neutral to Energy Ball such as Toxapex and Pelipper, while Energy Ball is stronger and also hits Water/Ground types such as Gastrodon and Quagsire. U-turn forgoes a coverage move in order to allow Iron Moth to maintain momentum even when it cannot break through a team. Fiery Dance can be run instead of Flamethrower, forgoing a bit of power and burn chance in exchange for the potential to snowball into a sweep.</p> <p>Iron Moth pairs well with wallbreakers that can open holes for it such as Scovillain and Hisuian Arcanine. The former aids with bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Gastrodon that may give Iron Moth trouble depending on its coverage, while the latter appreciates Iron Moth's speed control and potential pivoting capabilities to destroy problematic Fire-types and special walls, including Skeledirge and Hisuian Goodra. Torkoal provides Stealth Rock, status, and Rapid Spin support as well as powering up Iron Moth's Flamethrower with the sun. Paldean Tauros-F can threaten Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Heatran that wall Iron Moth, while Iron Moth can discourage faster Pokemon such as Greninja and Iron Treads from switching in—neither of which Paldean Tauros-F wants to take on. Volcarona can aid Iron Moth in wearing down a team, as both Pokemon can make progress to help the other break through; additionally, Volcarona can heavily damage Psychic- and Dark- types such as Espathra and Ting-Lu that can give Iron Moth trouble. Finally, Iron Moth's bad bulk makes pivoting support from Cinderace, Talonflame, and Moltres appreciated to help it get in easier; Cinderace can also provide hazard control with Court Change, while Talonflame can achieve the same with Defog.</p>"
        },
        "Substitute + Three Attacks (Poison)": {
          "description": "<p>With a pair of Heavy-Duty Boots, Iron Moth can switch in safely on entry hazards and go to town. It can easily set up a Substitute on foes such as Articuno, Moltres, and Amoonguss or predicted Sucker Punches from the likes of Kingambit to begin causing havoc while being safe from strong attacks. Fiery Dance pairs nicely with Substitute to give Iron Moth plenty of chances to boost up its Special Attack. However, Flamethrower is more consistent, being able to reliably OHKO Alolan Ninetales and fast Kingambit. Either Fire-type STAB melts Steel- and Ice-type threats like Corviknight, Scizor and Frosmoth. Discharge shocks Water-type switch-ins like Toxapex, Empoleon, and Azumarill, along with scaring Flying-types like Moltres and Enamorus out. Energy Ball gives Iron Moth the ability to threaten all Water-types with the exception of Ogerpon-W by hitting Quagsire and Rotom-W, along with blasting through Ground- and Rock-types like Ursaluna-B, Mamoswine, and Garganacl.</p> <p>Galarian Weezing's immunity to Ground-type attacks and high physical bulk make it an invaluable partner for Iron Moth, enabling it to safely come in against monsters like Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Mamoswine and threaten them out with the fear of Will-O-Wisp burns, and in return Iron Moth threatens Steel-types like Corviknight and Gholdengo. Physically defensive Amoonguss's Grass typing lets it take on many of the Water- and Ground-type threats Iron Moth is typically scared of like Urshifu-R, Quaquaval, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads with its STAB attacks. Spore also creates opportunities for Iron Moth to safely switch in and set up Substitute. Physically defensive Toxapex handles faster threats and Fire-types like Chien-Pao, Kleavor, Hisuian Arcanine, and Ceruledge with its STAB Surf and Haze. Alolan Muk's incredible special bulk and ability to handle threatening Ghost-, Dark- and Psychic-type threats like Flutter Mane, Spectrier, Greninja, Darkrai, and Espathra is invaluable. Overqwil can deal with Psychic-types like Galarian Slowking, Hatterene, and Espathra while setting Spikes, which Iron Moth can use to add to its offensive pressure and Fiery Dance sweeping potential. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking serves as another incredible special wall, being able to threaten out foes such as Kommo-o, Volcarona, and opposing Iron Moth. Galarian Slowking can further use STAB Future Sight to set traps to catch opposing switch-ins to Iron Moth such as Iron Hands and Clodsire. Water Absorb Clodsire handles Fire-types that would switch into Iron Moth's STAB moves like Ninetales and Volcanion with STAB Earthquake. It can also use Unaware to check Volcarona and set up Stealth Rock to pressure Fire-types. Glimmora can also set Stealth Rock and threaten out Fire-types like Talonflame and Skeledirge with its STAB Power Gem and Heatran with Earth Power, and using Corrosion, it can ruin special walls like Alolan Muk, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire with Toxic. Sneasler's higher base Speed and STAB moves can allow it to blast through threats like Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Heatran, the Ogerpon formes, and Kingambit. Alternatively, Sneasler can use a Choice Scarf to outspeed and remove Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur even after it gets a Speed boost while using Switcheroo to mess up walls like Clodsire. Okidogi can remove threats like Kingambit, Heatran and Ogerpon-C while softening up other threats such as Toxapex and Clodsire with Knock Off.</p>"

          "description": "<p>With the Speed boost from Agility and Special Attack Boost from Booster Energy, Iron Moth can effectively serve the role of a cleaner. Fiery Dance and Sludge Wave serve as spammable STAB attacks that hit the majority of the tier for neutral damage; the former has the potential to snowball through teams, thanks to its chance to raise the user's Special Attack further. Energy Ball primarily targets Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types like Hippowdon, Mega Tyranitar, and Slowking. Due to the all-or-nothing nature of this set, Iron Moth best fits on offense teams looking for a cleaner. It struggles against Ground-, Rock- and Water-types, so Grass- and Water-types like Mega Venusaur and Calm Mind Tapu Fini make good partners, as they can handle these threats. Physical wallbreakers like Iron Hands and Buzzwole are also important, as Iron Moth has no way to get past Blissey and Chansey. Skeledirge also walls Iron Moth thanks to their typings and bulk, so Ghost- and Dark-types, and notably Pursuit users like Mega Tyranitar, can eliminate them for it. Iron Moth despises losing 25% of its health to Stealth Rock when switching in, so partners that can remove them, like Excadrill and Tapu Fini, are much appreciated. Stealth Rock support is greatly appreciated, as it can push certain targets like Choice Band Tyranitar outside of Sandstorm and Hydreigon into KO range.</p>"
        },
        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<p>Offensive Iron Moth leverages its high number of resistances and good power to act as a dangerous offensive threat with Heavy-Duty Boots. Fire Blast serves as a powerful STAB move that threatens every neutral target that doesn't have immense special bulk. Fiery Dance is an alternative; it's notably weaker, missing out on the OHKO on Autotomize Celesteela and 2HKO on Iron Hands. However, in exchange, it has perfect accuracy, more PP, and its ability to boost Iron Moth's Special Attack can let it sweep late-game. Sludge Wave is Iron Moth's other STAB attack; besides hitting opposing Dragon- and Fire-types for neutral damage, it also breaks through Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Fini. Due to the amount of Pokemon it threatens out, such as Aegislash and Mega Sableye, Iron Moth is an effective setter of Toxic Spikes; Energy Ball is an alternative, serving as coverage against opposing Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types, like Gastrodon and Tyranitar, and finally, U-turn is another alternative, as the switches Iron Moth forces out let it act as an effective offensive pivot. Morning Sun gives Iron Moth reliable recovery, letting it avoid getting worn down by repeated attacks and Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots are removed. Iron Moth best fits on balance and offensive teams looking for a fast and powerful special attacker with good utility. While Iron Moth can check most special attackers, even resisted hits from physical attackers like Cinderace can 2HKO it. Thus, physical walls and tanks like Buzzwole and Slowbro can check these foes for Iron Moth. Pivots, like the latter two, can also help Iron Moth find opportunities to switch in. If it is carrying U-turn, wallbreakers like Choice Band Scizor, Choice Specs Latios, and Enamorus appreciate Iron Moth's ability to pivot them in safely, while in return they can smash through the walls and many offensive threats that give Iron Moth trouble. Speed control, namely powerful priority users like Scizor and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Fini and Hydreigon, can also help eliminate physical attackers. Physical wallbreakers like Iron Hands and Buzzwole can help against Blissey and Chansey, which wall Iron Moth. Chansey and Skeledirge also wall Iron Moth, so Ghost- and Dark-types, notably Pursuit users like Mega Tyranitar, can remove them for it.</p>"

        "Booster Energy: Speed": {
          "description": "<p>Iron Moth is a good sweeper primarily seen on hyper offense and offense teams thanks to Booster Energy bolstering its Speed and giving it the immediate ability to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Sandy Shocks. It also has high Special Attack and access to a threatening movepool. Fiery Dance serves as a spammable Fire-type STAB move that has the power to 2HKO bulky foes like Celesteela, Aegislash, and Amoonguss, and its ability to boost Iron Moth's Special Attack can let it sweep late-game. Sludge Wave helps break through Fire-resistant and Fairy-type Pokemon like Hydreigon, Volcanion, Tapu Fini, and Clefable, and it can help get KOs on neutral targets that Fiery Dance cannot. Substitute lets Iron Moth make use of switches it forces against foes like Celesteela and Buzzwole and take advantage of some defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth lacking Earthquake and Amoonguss. Energy Ball hits Ground-types like Gastrodon, Ting-Lu, and Hippowdon, as well as providing a way to chip Mega Tyranitar. Psychic is an alternative that helps deal with Iron Hands, Mega Venusaur, and opposing Iron Moth. This given EV spread maximizes Special Attack while ensuring that Booster Energy will boost Speed, while the rest is put into Defense to augment its physical bulk and to help against priority moves. Entry hazard setters, notably suicide leads like Excadrill also pair nicely with Iron Moth, being able to chip down targets like Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu. Due to Iron Moth's Stealth Rock weakness that can give it a harder time sweeping, hazard removers like Tapu Fini and Excadrill make good teammates. Iron Moth primarily struggles to break through its checks like Chansey, Blissey, and Skeledirge, making fellow physically offensive Pokemon like Ceruledge and Mega Aerodactyl good teammates.</p>"

        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<p>Iron Moth's power, Speed tier, and U-turn allow it to function well as an offensive pivot. Energy Ball hits Gastrodon and Garganacl while U-turn allows Iron Moth to pivot out of bad matchups, such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge. Alternatively, Psychic hits Toxapex, but it makes Iron Moth a significant momentum sink against Heatran and Mega Tyranitar. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Iron Moth to act as a pivot consistently without having to worry about entry hazard chip, which it is otherwise very vulnerable to. Tera Grass surprises Mega Swampert, Mega Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Garchomp defensively before hitting them back with a powerful Energy Ball. Iron Moth fits well on VoltTurn offenses, specifically those including Tapu Koko, who is a natural partner for it. Tapu Koko can set Electric Terrain for Iron Moth in order to boost its Special Attack and benefits from Iron Moth bringing it in on Toxapex. Conversely, Tapu Koko can bring Iron Moth in on threats to it, such as Ferrothorn and Rillaboom. Iron Moth also benefits heavily from Future Sight support, as it prevents Toxapex from safely switching in while also applying some chip onto Heatran. Slowbro can pivot into threats to Iron Moth, such as Garchomp, Mega Lopunny, and Zamazenta, while Slowking helps out even more against Heatran. Entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn, Mega Diancie, Garchomp, and Landorus-T wear down Iron Moth's checks like Heatran, Garchomp, and Mega Tyranitar. Garchomp in particular pivots into Heatran relatively well. Powerful offensive threats like Dragapult, Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Lele appreciate Iron Moth bringing them in safely on threats like Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge while also being a decent wallbreaker in its own right. The former three can also use their good Speed tier to help out Iron Moth against more offensive builds.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Specs": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Iron Moth is a prediction-reliant but extremely dangerous wallbreaker that can systematically break down defensive cores while still being useful against offense due to its decent Speed tier. Energy Ball hits threats such as Gastrodon, Garganacl, and Garchomp. Psychic hits Toxapex and Clodsire hard, while also having a decent chance of 2HKOing physically defensive Skeledirge. Iron Moth can also opt for Tera Blast + Tera Ground to hit Toxapex, Heatran, Skeledirge, and Clodsire all at once while removing its irritating Stealth Rock weakness. This makes Iron Moth very reliant on Terastallizing to break certain teams, however. Tera Grass should be used otherwise, as it still lessens Iron Moth's Stealth Rock weakness while also allowing it to potentially turn the tables on Garchomp, Mega Swampert, and Urshifu-R. U-turn can also be used to ease prediction and safely bring in teammates, but Iron Moth's Stealth Rock weakness makes this a risky proposition. Iron Moth needs very solid entry hazard control, so options such as Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, Cyclizar, and Great Tusk make for solid teammates; the former three can also bring Iron Moth in safely via pivoting. Tapu Koko is another great option, as Electric Terrain jacks up Iron Moth's power to titanic levels, cleanly 2HKOing Clodsire, Garchomp, and Skeledirge with Fire Blast after the Quark Drive boost. It also allows Iron Moth to deal sizable damage to physically defensive Toxapex with Fire Blast, potentially 2HKOing it after some chip. Heatran switch-ins such as Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Slowking are appreciated, as its presence makes it very hard for Iron Moth to safely use its STAB moves. The latter two can use pivot moves to bring Iron Moth in. Heatran can beat these with Tera Grass and Tera Blast, but Iron Moth will be able to use Sludge Wave on it if Terastallization is forced. Powerful anti-offense Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Dragapult, and Iron Valiant are good teammates, as they appreciate Iron Moth wearing down defensive cores while supporting Iron Moth against fast offenses that exploit its Speed tier.</p>"

In combination with a Poison-resistant Pokemon like Venomicon, Iron Moth can cede crucial momentum, providing the opponent with an opportunity for a comeback. Flash Fire Ceruledge is Iron Moth's hardest counter, being immune to Overheat and Fiery Dance,  resistant to Solar Beam and Sludge Wave, and able to strike back with a boosted Shadow Sneak. However, Iron Moth can run Tera Ground + Tera Blast specifically to circumvent these counters.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock wears down Iron Moth exceptionally quickly. This is particularly notable with its Choice Specs set, which needs to switch out often to reset Overheat's Special Attack drops.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Sucker Punch Kingambit and Extreme Speed Dragonite can prey on Iron Moth's weak physical defense. Kingambit must be wary of Tera Fairy Iron Moth, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Roaring Moon, Cinderace, Meowscarada, Greninja, and Psyshock Iron Valiant can pick off Iron Moth before it can respond.</p> <p><strong>Special Tanks</strong>: Clodsire, Skeledirge, Arghonaut, and Ting-Lu can easily tank most moves from Booster Energy Iron Moth, but they are 2HKOed by its sun-boosted Choice Specs Overheat with any prior damage or if it Terastallizes.</p> <p><strong>Rain Teams</strong>: Pelipper can override Jumbao's sun with rain, which weakens Iron Moth's best attacks.

      "sets": {
        "Choice Specs": {
          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Specs Iron Moth is the strongest wallbreaker available for sun teams. Its Tera Fire Overheat under sun can 2HKO Arghonaut and Skeledirge, two of the best special walls in the metagame, and still deal massive damage to frailer targets at -2. Solar Beam more reliably 2HKOes Arghonaut, Toxapex, and Garganacl so that Iron Moth isn't required to Terastallize to be effective. Fiery Dance lets Iron Moth snowball and end games once the opposing team has no remaining Unaware users and is sufficiently weakened. Sludge Wave 2HKOes Astrolotl and Dragonite and OHKOes Cinderace outside of sun, which could otherwise tank an Overheat and pivot around the weakened hit. Ground-type Tera Blast OHKOes Ceruledge, Astrolotl, Skeledirge, and opposing Iron Moth with a surprise hit.</p> <p>Drought Jumbao is a required teammate to set up sun. Healing Wish can help Iron Moth offset Stealth Rock damage and get into battle late-game. Other Protosynthesis users like Roaring Moon and Great Tusk fit fantastically alongside Iron Moth. Roaring Moon's Choice Band-boosted attacks complement Iron Moth's strong special attacks, and its U-turn can bring Iron Moth in safely against a Fairy- or Steel-type switch-in. Great Tusk can remove entry hazards and switch into strong physical attackers like Roaring Moon and Kingambit. In return, Iron Moth very easily switches into Jumbao, one of Great Tusk's hard counters. Eject Button Hatterene is a fantastic teammate that helps keep Stealth Rock off the field and give Iron Moth a crucial free switch.</p>"
        },
        "Booster Energy": {
          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Booster Energy Iron Moth fits best on hyper offense teams where Booster Energy's one-time use can be easily justified. Although it faces some competition  from Quiver Dance Volcarona, its instant power and higher natural Speed tier gives it a niche over Volcarona. Fiery Dance allows Iron Moth to snowball quickly, while Sludge Wave forces Arghonaut and Garganacl to think twice before Terastallizing into a Fairy-type. Energy Ball 2HKOes Arghonaut, Krilowatt, and Garganacl, but Psychic maintains coverage against Arghonaut while pressuring Venomicon, Dragapult, and Clodsire harder. Ground-type Tera Blast allows Iron Moth to push past Skeledirge, Astrolotl, Clodsire, and Ceruledge, which would otherwise give it serious trouble. Dazzling Gleam is best when Iron Moth is Tera Fairy, hitting Roaring Moon and Dragapult more effectively. Tera Fairy allows Iron Moth to stomach Roaring Moon's STAB moves and Kingambit's Sucker Punch, removing them for a surprise KO. Agility helps Iron Moth sweep better, but it displaces a coverage move and is generally outclassed by Volcarona as a setup sweeper. Tera Grass is the best option, turning Iron Moth's severe Ground weakness into a resistance and boosting Energy Ball. An EV spread of 124 Def / 132 SpA / 252 Spe can be used so that Booster Energy raises Iron Moth's Speed, but the drop in power is noticeable. Booster Energy Iron Moth can also fit on sun teams to thwart typical counterplay to its Choice Specs set. Solar Beam should be run to OHKO specially defensive Garganacl at +1 and with Quark Drive active. However, Choice Specs is usually more effective against unprepared teams.</p> <p>Iron Moth fits excellently on hyper offense teams. Entry hazard setters like Meowscarada, Greninja, and Garchomp enable Iron Moth to net KOs more easily. Rapid Spin users like Caribolt and Great Tusk remove Stealth Rock to help Iron Moth leverage its good special bulk. Other hyper offense sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, Swords Dance Iron Valiant, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Scale Shot + Swords Dance Miasmaw tend to struggle with Jumbao, which Iron Moth can help deal with. Supreme Overlord Kingambit can clean up games after Iron Moth has broken holes and fainted.</p>"

If using Choice Specs and Tera Poison, it becomes extremely difficult to check defensively without Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Discharge</strong>: Discharge trades hitting Rotom-W hard for Toxapex, at the cost of being far more vulnerable against Ground-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flame Charge</strong>: If not using a Choice item, coverage can be sacrificed in exchange for giving Iron Moth the ability to outspeed major threats such as Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, and Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: Iron Moth is fully capable of being a reasonable pivot, though U-turn is rather weak.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Iron Moth's sheer offensive power and good Speed tier means Terastallization isn't integral to it, but it can be a good tool to stop revenge kills.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass massively improves Iron Moth's matchup against common Ground-types like Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Garchomp, and the high powered Energy Ball helps against Palafin-H and Assault Vest Azumarill. The immunity to Spore can help in a pinch against Brute Bonnet and Breloom too.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: With Tera Blast, Tera Water improves the Chi-Yu and Iron Moth matchup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: When paired with Overheat and Choice Specs, Tera Fire means Fire-resistant foes aren't safe; even physically defensive Skeledirge is 2HKOed!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: The Dark-type resistance Tera Fairy provides can be a good way to catch Chien-Pao off guard after its Focus Sash has been broken. The boost given to Dazzling Gleam also makes Tera Fairy far more effective against Dragon-types, now being able to OHKO Dragapult and even OHKO Garchomp if using Choice Specs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison gives Sludge Wave good damage potential and removes Iron Moth's annoying Stealth Rock weakness. It also turns Acid Spray into a deadly wall-breaking move.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: While Booster Energy does make this Iron Moth less flexible in terms of switching out, the extra power can allow Iron Moth to run bulkier EV spreads, and the lack of recoil like Life Orb can make it a good late-game cleaner too.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs turns Iron Moth into a full blown wallbreaker.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Iron Moth's good special bulk makes Assault Vest a fine choice, letting it survive new attacks such as an unboosted Hydro Pump from Iron Bundle and Rotom-W. It can be paired with bulkier EV spreads for even more impressive feats!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Scarf outspeeds important threats such as Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, and Dragapult, who could otherwise outspeed and KO Iron Moth. Note that this item does compete heavily with the more powerful Chi-Yu, so make sure aspects of Iron Moth like Toxic Spikes absorption are important to the team.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Bulkier EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>164 HP / 100 Def / 60 SpA / 4 SpD / 180 Spe with Modest</strong>: This EV spread survives Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Life Orb Chien-Pao's Throat Chop from full health, survives two Shadow Balls from Modest Flutter Mane that lack an offensive boost, and outspeeds Modest Chi-Yu, Jolly Baxcalibur, and Jolly Great Tusk. If using Assault Vest, even Choice Specs Flutter Mane fails to 2HKO with Shadow Ball!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 28 Def / 160 SpA / 180 Spe with Modest</strong>: This Assault Vest based spread avoids a 2HKO from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball, and OHKOes Iron Bundle with Fiery Dance.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Iron Moth may seem like a strange Pokemon to use as a bulky Toxic Spikes setter, but it sets itself apart from other Pokemon like Toxapex thanks to being far less passive.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fiery Dance</strong>: While Fiery Dance is not a particularly reliable away to sweep, taking the chance is worth it considering Iron Moth's Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Whirlwind</strong>: A phazing move may not seemingly gel well with Speed investment, but it has incredible utility when Toxic Spikes are set up, punishing teams that leave their Toxic Spikes absorber in on Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sludge Wave versus Tera Blast</strong>: Giving up on Whirlwind does lose a unique selling point as a Toxic Spikes setter, but in exchange makes Iron Moth much harder to check with Fire-type checks like Azumarill and Chi-Yu. Sludge Wave is preferred for its reliability, but Tera Blast makes sense with certain Tera Types like Water.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: When the aim is to simply set up Toxic Spikes, Terastallization is not that important. However, Iron Moth's typing gives it enough weaknesses that Terastallization can give it a far longer life span.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Iron Moth a resistance to Water moves without losing its resistance to Ice and Fire, which is helpful against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu. It's also a great type to use with Tera Blast for dealing damage to Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass lets Iron Moth deal with powerful Earthquakes from the likes of Ting-Lu and Garchomp, gives it a vital resistance to Water, and nullifies Spore. If using Tera Blast, it also can threaten Azumarill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dark resistance can surprise Chien-Pao looking to revenge kill Iron Moth and protects it from powerful Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Baxcalibur, Dragapult, and Choice Band Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire's defensive benefits are not particularly helpful, but it makes late-game sweeping with Fiery Dance far more likely.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison doesn't offer too many amazing defensive benefits beyond removing the irritating weaknesses to Water and Rock, but it does retain Iron Moth's valuable Toxic Spikes absorption powers and makes Black Sludge far more viable.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak protects Iron Moth from the dreaded Salt Cure, which can otherwise put a timer on phazing. It also prevents specially defensive Iron Moth from losing to Chi-Yu's flinch chance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Passho Berry</strong>: Passho Berry lets Iron Moth survive most special Water-type attacks without needing to Terastallize, such as Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, as well as weaker priority moves from Azumarill and Palafin-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: The quick burst of recovery Sitrus Berry gives can be paired with specialized EV spreads, allowing Iron Moth to survive a wider range of attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Black Sludge</strong>: Leftovers's residual recovery pairs well with using Whirlwind as much as possible, but it's a fairly high-value item. Black Sludge is an acceptable alternative, but note that it will hurt Iron Moth after Terastallization if not using Tera Poison.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy can be paired with specialized EV spreads to either get easier KOs, gain a Speed boost, or survive surprising special attacks at the cost of the flexibility of more general EV spreads designed to switch in multiple times.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>General EV Spread Examples</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 228 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 36 Spe with Modest</strong>: This EV spread survives Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Psyshock from full health.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 HP / 132 SpD / 180 Spe with Calm</strong>: This EV spread almost always avoids the 2HKO from Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse while outspeeding it alongside Jolly Baxcalibur and Jolly Great Tusk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 164 SpD / 100 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Jolly Annihilape and, as a bonus, gives Leftovers Iron Moth a nearly guaranteed chance to avoid being 2HKOed by Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse and Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 52 Def / 4 SpA / 12 SpD / 196 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread sacrifices some bulk to outspeed Garchomp while still surviving Life Orb Chien-Pao's Throat Chop and having a great shot of surviving two uses of Dark Pulse from Timid Chi-Yu. It also gets a Speed boost from Quark Drive.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 236 Def / 36 Spe with Bold</strong>: This very physically defensive EV spread will allow a full health Iron Moth to survive Tera Dark Black Glasses Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave after Supreme Overlord has been boosted by two KOed teammates.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Sitrus Berry Exclusive EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p>When using Sitrus Berry, make sure to run an even HP stat, so that one use of Ruination will activate it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>180 HP / 228 Def / 100 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread almost always survives two hits from Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Throat Chop with Sitrus Berry, and it outspeeds Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 188 Def / 12 SpA / 12 SpD / 52 Spe with Bold</strong>: This EV spread usually prevents Iron Moth from getting 2HKOed by Timid Flutter Mane's Psyshock and avoids a 2HKO from Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Throat Chop as well. The minor Special Defense investment also avoids a 2HKO from Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse and Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Booster Energy Exclusive EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 244 Def / 36 SpA / 4 SpD / 36 Spe with Modest</strong>: This Booster Energy optimized spread OHKOes 4 Special Defense EVs Iron Bundle with a Quark Drive-boosted Fiery Dance while having good enough physical bulk to have a good chances of surviving powerful attacks from full health, like Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Psyshock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 220 SpD / 36 Spe with Calm</strong>: This EV spread gives Iron Moth a Special Defense boost with Quark Drive, making it so bulky that even a Modest Choice Specs Chi-Yu has a low chance of 2HKOing it with Dark Pulse!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Benchmarks for Speed EVs</h1> <p>Like many fast bulky Pokemon, Iron Moth has a huge variety of viable EV builds. If you'd like to make your own EV spread though, keep these Speed tiers in mind! Natures that can efficiently use these Speed tiers will be mentioned.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>36 Speed EVs with any Neutral Nature</strong>: This is the minimum amount of Speed to run, outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>52 Speed EVs with any Neutral Nature</strong>: This outspeeds Modest Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>76 Speed EVs with Timid or 180 Speed EVs with Calm</strong> This outspeeds Modest Chi-Yu, Jolly Baxcalibur, and Jolly Great Tusk. Note that Timid will give Iron Moth a bonus point to Speed, but a Calm nature has a greater chance of surviving some special attacks with specific EV spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>132 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This is the minimum investment for Iron Moth to get a Speed boost from Quark Drive, assuming no Special Attack investment, since doing so will increase Special Attack instead.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>148 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Baxcalibur is an excellent setup sweeper boasting coverage to ease the Poison matchup and serves as a great wincon versus typings like Ground, Flying, and Dragon. Additionally, Baxcalibur's neutrality to Ice-type attacks allows it to combat Chien-Pao lacking Fighting-type coverage and Ice Beam Greninja. Ice Shard allows Baxcalibur to use an Adamant nature to revenge kill weakened targets such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane. Alternatively, Glaive Rush may be used instead to deal more damage to Chien-Pao and opposing Baxcalibur. Icicle Spear in conjunction with Loaded Dice is a potent combination, dealing enough damage to break past Quagsire and Corviknight with an Adamant nature. Icicle Crash is a great option instead, as it doesn't require an item to function well; however, it has a decreased Base Power. Earthquake is a great coverage move, allowing Baxcalibur to threaten Skeledirge, Kingambit, and Gholdengo.</p> <p>Baxcalibur is capable of switching into Will-O-Wisps from the likes of Sableye and Skeledirge with its ability Thermal Exchange, keeping other physical attackers like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Roaring Moon safe. Cyclizar is an exceptional teammate, as it uses Shed Tail to keep Baxcalibur safe from status ailments induced by Toxapex and Grimmsnarl as it sets up with Dragon Dance. Furthermore, Cyclizar removes entry hazards such as Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Dragapult is capable of outpacing threats like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and opposing Baxcalibur as well as pressuring Dondozo with Thunderbolt. Garchomp eases Baxcalibur's sweeping by setting entry hazards and phazing opposing Pokemon through Dragon Tail to rack up damage. Dragalge sets up Toxic Spikes and checks Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant thanks to its Fairy-type neutrality along with STAB Gunk Shot. Hydreigon threatens physical walls like Slowbro, Dondozo, and Toxapex by disabling their recovery options with Taunt and setting up on them using Nasty Plot.

However, it struggles to break through Unaware walls, such as Quagsire and Dondozo, and Pokemon that resist its STAB Combination and threaten it, such as Scizor and Azumarill. Thermal Exchange lets it switch into and punish Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-W and Sableye and Fire-type moves from Ceruledge and Fire Spin Skuntank. Glaive Rush hits Rotom-W, Toxapex, Volcarona and Quaquaval, while Ice-type STAB moves let it threaten Meowscarada, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Earthquake is a great option to hit Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Kingambit super effectively, while Ice Shard lets it pick off weakened Pokemon and Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada, Flamigo, and Dragapult. An Adamant nature maximizes Baxcalibur's power while outspeeding Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao at +1; however, a Jolly nature outspeeds Gholdengo and Quaquaval and Speed ties Choice Scarf Great Tusk at +1.</p> <p>Baxcalibur appreciates teammates that can provide it with setup opportunities. Froslass can set Spikes and stop opposing hazards with Taunt, spread burns, and use Destiny Bond to KO opposing threats to Baxcalibur. Abomasnow provides Baxcalibur with snow's defense boost and Aurora Veil to help it set up while also checking Dondozo and Quagsire. Swords Dance Chien-Pao can break Skeledirge, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit and can pick off Pokemon that Baxcalibur has weakened with Ice Shard or Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Chien-Pao can effectively clean up the battle once Baxcalibur has dealt significant damage. Avalugg and Cloyster can both remove hazards for Baxcalibur in case its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed. Cloyster can also clean up after Baxcalibur with Shell Smash, while Avalugg can beat Kingambit, Iron Treads, and more with Iron Defense + Body Press if Baxcalibur forgoes Earthquake. Cryogonal's combination of Freeze-Dry and Rapid Spin can help Baxcalibur deal with Quagsire while also removing entry hazards that Ice-type teams often struggle with.</p>"

Additionally, Swords Dance grants it the ability to eliminate would-be checks to Dragon Dance sets, like Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos and Flutter Mane, with these being OHKOed by a +2 Ice Shard. At +2, Icicle Crash OHKOes specially defensive Ting-Lu and 2HKOes Corviknight, preventing these walls from phazing or heavily damaging Baxcalibur. Alternatively, Icicle Spear in combination with Loaded Dice enables Baxcalibur to outright OHKO Corviknight and physically defensive Great Tusk at +2. It can also break through Quagsire if it manages to land five hits. However, Dragon teams do not have consistent entry hazard removal, making Loaded Dice a bit unreliable. If Icicle Crash is used, Glaive Rush becomes much more important, since it has a chance to 2HKO Quagsire if using an Adamant nature. This move also enables Baxcalibur to indiscriminately break down bulkier teams like Poison and Water. Ice Shard allows Baxcalibur to clean up types such as Dragon, Ground, and Flying after dealing with bulky Pokemon like Walking Wake, Great Tusk, and Corviknight. A Jolly nature allows Baxcalibur to outpace threats like Glimmora and Gholdengo. This makes Earthquake a better choice, since it OHKOes both at +2 while retaining its ability to threaten Poison and Steel teams. However, this comes at the cost of being unable to break Quagsire.</p> <p>Cyclizar is one of the best teammates for Baxcalibur due to its ability to remove entry hazards, remove items from bulky walls like Quagsire and Toxapex, and pass a Substitute to Baxcalibur with Shed Tail. Garchomp provides entry hazard support and can shuffle opposing teams with Dragon Tail. It also pressures Steel-types like Gholdengo immensely, which is appreciated especially if Baxcalibur lacks Earthquake. Choice Specs Dragapult deals with Flutter Mane, Quagsire, and Gholdengo, pivots Baxcalibur into special walls like Clodsire and Alolan Muk, and spreads status on unsuspecting threats like Kingambit, Quagsire, and Corviknight, making them easier to deal with. Hisuian Goodra checks Fairy-types like Hatterene, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, and Flutter Mane. In return, Baxcalibur deals with Enamorus, Breloom, and Landorus, which all pose a threat to Hisuian Goodra. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Iron Defense Hisuian Goodra work in tandem with Baxcalibur, as they wear down each other's checks to eventually win the Water, Fighting, Steel, and Fairy matchups. Hisuian Goodra and Dragonite also appreciates Baxcalibur's ability to swap into predicted Will-O-Wisps from Sableye. Choice Scarf users like Walking Wake and Roaring Moon are also appreciated, as Walking Wake deals with fast threats like Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Chien-Pao, while Roaring Moon takes care of Iron Valiant and Dragapult.</p>"

Additionally, Baxcalibur's ability Thermal Exchange allows it to get swapped in freely on Pokemon like Sableye, Rotom-W, and Skeledirge to absorb Will-O-Wisp and the latter's Fire-type moves. Loaded Dice in conjunction with Icicle Spear provides Baxcalibur with a superior Ice-type move to Icicle Crash, capable of breaking through Galarian Weezing and Corviknight after a Swords Dance boost as well as Quagsire if it lands all five hits. Scale Shot, which also takes advantage of Loaded Dice, hits Volcarona, Urshifu-R, and Quaquaval as well as gives Baxcalibur a Speed boost, allowing it to easily tear through teams.

Chien-Pao threatens Pokemon like Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Jirachi as well as 2HKOes Quagsire and Corviknight with a Choice Band. In return, Chien-Pao appreciates Baxcalibur weakening shared checks, namely Toxapex and Corviknight. Mamoswine and Froslass provide entry hazard support for Baxcalibur's wallbreaking; the former breaks bulky Steel-types like Heatran and Kingambit should Baxcalibur opt for Ice Shard and removes Corviknight with Smack Down, while the latter offers a Fighting-type immunity. Avalugg and Alolan Sandslash remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin; the former also prevents faster threats like Choice Scarf Urshifu and Iron Defense Iron Treads from sweeping, while the latter provides speed control, checking Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant. Alolan Sandslash also deters spinblockers with Knock Off and walls and removes Toxapex.

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Gholdengo's flexible statline gives it the ability to deal with a lot of other threats if it wishes to. For instance, 224 Speed EVs can be invested to outrun Adamant Choice Band Mamoswine, which Ghost teams don't have a defensive answer to. A spread of 252 HP / 108 Def / 84 SpD / 64 Spe with either of the prescribed natures lets Gholdengo survive a hit from non-Choice Band Chien-Pao and Expert Belt Flutter Mane and OHKO back while still being able to outspeed Jolly Azumarill. Hex in conjunction with Thunder Wave is decent in supporting team mates, notably outright OHKOing Gliscor at +2 if running a Modest nature. However, Steel-type coverage is usually more useful, and Ghost has no shortage of Pokemon that inflict status. Focus Blast is also notable, as Gholdengo is not OHKOed by fully Supreme Overlord-boosted Sucker Punch from Kingambit and OHKOes it back with that move. However, this move has low PP and has a big chance to miss. Rocky Helmet is great to wear down and punish physical attackers like Urshifu-R and Iron Hands, but the Ground immunity of Air Balloon is almost too good to pass up on.</p> </section>",

        "Nasty Plot (Steel)": {
          "description": "<p>Boasting an impressive Special Attack stat, Gholdengo provides Steel teams with a fantastic special attacker, which are scarce on said type. Nasty Plot lets Gholdengo overwhelm walls such as Gastrodon and Amoonguss. Shadow Ball is a fantastic STAB move that has great neutral coverage and allows Gholdengo to threaten Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Gallade. Focus Blast hits Dark-types that resist Shadow Ball like Kingambit and Ting-Lu. A single Nasty Plot boost enables Gholdengo's Focus Blast to OHKO physically defensive Ting-Lu after a layer of Spikes. The last slot is extremely flexible; Make It Rain is a powerful STAB move that hits harder than Shadow Ball against Dark-types like Grimmsnarl and Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Substitute can be used instead to give Gholdengo some security against faster threats that can take it out such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Recover is also another option to keep Gholdengo healthy, since it can be worn down fairly easily. Good as Gold allows Gholdengo to switch into status-using Pokemon like Sableye and Grimmsnarl, allowing Gholdengo to set up on them. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to switch into Pokemon like Great Tusk and Clodsire with ease as well as avoid Spikes as long as it stays intact. This allows Gholdengo to be a decent spinblocker as well.</p> <p>Kingambit is a fantastic partner, as it not only resists Dark-type moves directed at Gholdengo, but it also has STAB priority in Sucker Punch to threaten opposing Ghost-types that can take out Gholdengo such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane. Kingambit also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take on Breloom so as to not be revenge killed. Scizor appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take care of physical walls, allowing it to clean up with STAB Bullet Punch. Scizor can also pivot into Gholdengo on physical walls such as Skeledirge, allowing Gholdengo to threaten the opposing Pokemon easier. Nasty Plot Lucario is another fantastic partner thanks to its ability to get rid of Dark-types for Gholdengo and pressure special walls. Choice Scarf Iron Treads also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to break physical walls such as opposing Corviknight and Great Tusk early-game so that it can sweep late-game. Dual screens support from Klefki allows Gholdengo to have an easier time setting up and potentially sweeping. Another good partner for Gholdengo is Corviknight, as it removes entry hazards while also providing a Ground immunity once Air Balloon is gone. Corviknight can also run a Bulk Up or Iron Defense set that appreciates Pokemon like Skeledirge being taken care of while helping Gholdengo have an easier time breaking stall. Orthworm is another good choice, as it provides Shed Tail support as well as having access to Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong is also an amazing partner as well, as it can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also tank Fire-type moves thanks to Heatproof.</p>"

        "Nasty Plot (Ghost)": {
          "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a bulky setup sweeper for Ghost teams, leveraging its stellar typing and fantastic stats to break down walls such as Articuno, Hisuian Goodra lacking Flamethrower, and Corviknight, which Ghost teams struggle with. Its ability, Good as Gold blocks status moves such as Encore from Sableye and phazing from Empoleon, heavily aiding Gholdengo as a setup sweeper. Make It Rain's extra power makes it a notable option over Flash Cannon, as it OHKOes Ursaluna-B and Articuno at +2 and will always OHKO Flutter Mane and Baxcalibur. However, it can be stalled out by Pressure, and the Special Attack drop can provide setup opportunities for enemies such as Azumarill and Gliscor. Alternatively, Flash Cannon provides a less strong but more reliable STAB move that is extremely helpful in the Fairy and Ice matchup. 104 Speed EVs let Gholdengo outspeed threats like Adamant Scizor and Jolly Azumarill and most walls, including uninvested Gliscor and Articuno. A Bold nature prevents Alolan Muk from 2HKOing Gholdengo before the Air Balloon breaks, while a Modest nature provides Gholdengo with more favorable damage calculations, namely giving it a chance to OHKO Gliscor and Galarian Moltres with +2 Make It Rain and Scizor with a boosted Shadow Ball and knocking out Alolan Muk over two turns with Make It Rain after a Nasty Plot. An Air Balloon lets Gholdengo provide a unique defensive niche, walling out a lot of Ground-types like Gliscor variants with no attacking moves besides Earthquake, Landorus, and Quagsire as long as it isn't popped, protecting Gholdengo from Poltergeist users such as Brambleghast once the item is popped, and also making it a generally safe switch-in to block Mortal Spin from Earth Power Glimmora.</p> <p>Flutter Mane and Nasty Plot Spectrier appreciate Gholdengo's wallbreaking ability to remove roadblocks like Gliscor, Clodsire, and Articuno. In return, Gholdengo is able to take a hit from non-Choice-Band Chien-Pao and OHKO it back for its teammates. In return, Flutter Mane and Spectrier both act as cleaners and deal with faster-paced matchups like Fighting and Ghost for Gholdengo. Both are also able to remove Dark-types like Greninja, while Spectrier can lure and incapacitate Dark-types like Roaring Moon if using a Colbur Berry. Flutter Mane can also don a Choice Scarf, to deal with Dragapult and Chien-Pao. Gholdengo's vulnerability to Water- and Fire-type coverage is notable, so teammates like Sinistcha to readily deal with Dondozo and Skeledirge to take on Gastrodon and Volcarona benefit Gholdengo. Skeledirge, especially with Earth Power, puts in work in the Steel and Fire matchup, while Sinistcha helps in the Ground matchup, which Gholdengo does not fare well against. Both also have the ability to inflict burn on key walls like Alolan Muk, Clodsire, and Iron Hands, making it easier for Gholdengo to set up. Ceruledge is an exceptional teammate, as it deals with Gholdengo's nemesis, Heatran, and also put in work on matchups like Steel and Fire. Spikes support from Froslass and Brambleghast is also great, as this synergizes with Gholdengo's ability to block Defog; Froslass also is fast enough to deal with Landorus, while Brambleghast's entry hazard removal is rare on Ghost and is appreciated once Gholdengo's Air Balloon gets popped. Dragapult's great Speed tier enables it to fend off Choice Specs Flutter Mane or Choice Scarf Roaring Moon when equipped with a Choice Specs or Choice Scarf of its own, and it can pivot Gholdengo in against walls like Clodsire with U-turn, as well as burn Alolan Muk, Iron Hands, and Ting-Lu for it. Dragapult can also run a Choice Band set, allowing it to 2HKO Alolan Muk as well as take out opposing Ghost-types with Sucker Punch, or even a Dragon Dance set to threaten walls such as Clodsire that bother Gholdengo. Choice Scarf Hisuian Zoroark takes advantage of Gholdengo's Speed tier and typing with Illusion, luring and removing threats like Hisuian Samurott while also being able to eliminate Hoopa-U with U-turn. It is also able to lure in and heavily damage Ghost-types like Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Spectrier, which use their Ghost-type coverage to defeat Gholdengo. Mimikyu can serve as a check to threats like Hoopa-U and Hydreigon as well as a one-time answer to Darkrai, Greninja, and Chien-Pao using Disguise. In return Gholdengo takes on Corviknight, Iron Defense Iron Treads, and Galarian Weezing.</p>"

        "Choice Scarf (Ghost)": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gholdengo's ability to revenge kill threats such as Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao lacking Sucker Punch, and Dragapult, come into status-spreading Pokemon such as Klefki and Breloom due to Good as Gold, and inconvenience bulkier teams by preventing all forms of entry hazard removal with its ability and typing make it a prime pick for Ghost teams. Make it Rain greatly weakens Dark- and Normal-types such as Hydreigon and Indeedee, and it OHKOes Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao. Shadow Ball lets Gholdengo clean types such as Psychic and Ghost late-game. Trick neutralizes defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, which typically switch into it. The last move of choice is dependent on what the Ghost team lacks; Focus Blast gives the team another way to defeat Choice Specs Greninja, Thunderbolt cleans Water- and Flying-teams, or Nasty Plot which turns Gholdengo into a massive threat against bulkier teams especially after their main specially defensive wall has been given a Choice Scarf with Trick.</p> <p>As Gholdengo provides the needed revenge killing capabilities on Ghost teams, teammates such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult are free to run sets like Choice Specs and Dragon Dance, respectively. Both also break down walls such as Clodsire and Gastrodon; in return, Gholdengo deals with Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Gallade. Skeledirge walls most physical attackers and Fire-types such as Scovillain and Volcarona. Mimikyu provides a safety net against offensive types like rain Water and Ghost, checking Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane for the team, and it loves Gholdengo shutting down defensive walls such as Toxapex with Trick. Entry hazard setters in Brambleghast and Froslass are is also greatly appreciated, as they can set, remove, or prevent entry hazards for Gholdengo; in return, Gholdengo prevents their entry hazards from getting removed by Glimmora. Brambleghast also switches into Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and deals with Water-types like Gastrodon and Dondozo, while Froslass can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave and bring down an opposing Pokemon with its Destiny Bond.</p>"

Shadow Ball provides excellent neutral coverage, hitting Manaphy, Hisuian Goodra, and Empoleon. Hex is an alternative with Toxic Spikes or other status support and bypasses Bulletproof. Recover gives Gholdengo the ability to heal off damage taken while setting up, as well as simply giving it the longevity to attack the opponent's team throughout the battle. Alternatively, Focus Blast hits Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra, while Thunder Wave slows down faster attackers like Iron Moth and Roaring Moon that try to threaten Gholdengo while powering up Hex to break down bulkier Pokemon like Manaphy. Gholdengo's ability to beat down balanced cores with the sheer strength of Steel Beam benefits faster cleaners like Barraskewda, Chien-Pao, and Choice Scarf Azelf and Walking Wake. If Gholdengo runs Thunder Wave, it can also support other offensive Pokemon that appreciate faster attackers getting slowed down, such as Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Dragonite. However, Gholdengo is vulnerable to faster Dark-types like Chien-Pao, so Pokemon that can check them like Corviknight and Quaquaval are appreciated. Corviknight can even safely bring in Gholdengo with its U-turn. Additionally, if Gholdengo is not using Thunder Wave and Hex, RegenVest users like Manaphy and Meloetta completely wall it, so Pokemon that beat them with super effective STAB moves or physical attacks like Desolate Land Ogerpon-H and Roaring Moon are appreciated.</p>"

Hex can be used over Shadow Ball with Thunder Wave or Toxic Spikes support, with Life Orb sets 2HKOing badly poisoned RegenVest Manaphy while also threatening Bulletproof Gholdengo. Recover gives Gholdengo significant longevity and multiple opportunities to use Nasty Plot, while Substitute gives it a free turn to set up Nasty Plot or Thunder Wave against foes like Corviknight and Kommo-o and dodges phazing attempts from Dragon Tail users like Hisuian Goodra and Roaring Moon. Focus Blast hits Roaring Moon, Kingambit, and Hisuian Goodra, while Thunder Wave can boost the power of Hex and spread useful paralysis against threats like Manaphy, Roaring Moon, and Ogerpon-C. Leftovers and Colbur Berry both boost its longevity, with the latter letting Gholdengo survive Knock Off from Roaring Moon or +2 Ogerpon-C, while Life Orb boosts Gholdengo's power significantly, granting it feats such as guaranteeing a 2HKO on specially defensive Garchomp with Make It Rain. If running Focus Blast, Beads of Ruin is an option over Adaptability, boosting Focus Blast's power at the cost of revealing Gholdengo's ability and slightly decreasing the power of its STAB moves. Gholdengo can struggle to break through common special walls like Blissey, Bulletproof Empoleon, and RegenVest users like Hisuian Goodra and Meloetta, so it appreciates powerful offensive teammates like Roaring Moon, Ogerpon-C, and Galarian Zapdos that can handle these walls while Gholdengo picks off physical walls like Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Kommo-o. Gholdengo appreciates defensive pivots like Corviknight, Manaphy, and Empoleon that can take a hit and bring Gholdengo in against foes it forces out such as Kommo-o, Pixilate Scream Tail, and Galarian Zapdos.</p>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With excellent bulk and a unique array of moves to support it, Wo-Chien stands out as a dangerous user of Leech Seed and a prime Pokemon to stall matches out with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Foul Play versus Knock Off</strong>: Foul Play is Wo-Chien's most consistent offensive move that also happens to punish setup sweepers, while Knock Off's support is especially helpful against Trick users such as Gholdengo and Rotom-W. Note that both are viable together if you're willing to give up a support move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: When paired together with Toxic Spikes, Protect and Substitute makes even foes that should beat Wo-Chien get worn down before they can KO it, such as Chi-Yu. Substitute itself protects Wo-Chien from slow users of Yawn such as Dondozo and Hippowdon, and slow OHKO moves from Ting-Lu, Dondozo, and Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ruination</strong>: Ruination gives Wo-Chien powerful chipping down potential, though it should never be used as Wo-Chien's only attack due to it being extremely difficult to KO with. When paired with Knock Off, it's especially useful against Wo-Chien mirror matches.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: With Stealth Rock support, Giga Drain OHKOes Iron Bundle and almost always 2HKOes Chien-Pao. If you allocate 60 EVs to Special Attack, Giga Drain will OHKO Iron Bundle regardless of Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt does an excellent job of surprising other Taunt Pokemon switching in, such as Annihilape and Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes Partners</strong>: Wo-Chien becomes far more deadly with Toxic Spikes support, letting it quickly wear down a wide variety of foes even faster. Toxapex is one of the best options thanks to its good defensive synergy with Wo-Chien, but other options include Iron Moth, Glimmora, Clodsire, Focus Sash Meowscarada, and the niche Gengar.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Snarl</strong>: Snarl makes fearsome special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu far easier to switch into when Wo-Chien needs to escape, though Wo-Chien will need to have the correct Tera Type to outstall these foes itself.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain</strong>: In addition to providing some extra recovery, Ingrain makes phazers such as Ting-Lu and Hippowdon fail to stop Wo-Chien consistently, though Wo-Chien being trapped is a serious drawback.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Despite Wo-Chien's fantastic bulk, its vulnerability to Toxic Spikes and poor defensive typing mean it must often Terastallize to stall out teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison provides a vital resistance to Fairy and Fighting, and it also lets Wo-Chien absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Besides being a great defensive type, Tera Fairy helps Wo-Chien against Fighting-types that'd normally beat it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water provides Ice and Fire resistances, helpful against Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives useful resistances to Fairy, Fire, and Ice, which help against major threats like Flutter Mane, Baxcalibur, Chi-Yu, and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Wo-Chien's stalling playstyle makes Leftovers the most consistent recovery item.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Big Root</strong>: If another Pokemon desperately needs Leftovers, Big Root is a viable alternative for getting extra recovery from Leech Seed and Giga Drain.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads and Adjustments</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish or Bold</strong>: Maximizing Wo-Chien's physical bulk lets it pull off some incredible stunts, such as avoiding a 3HKO from Breloom's Mach Punch with Leftovers and, after Terastallization, avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Band Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Careful or Calm</strong>: With the correct Tera Type and maximum Special Defense, Wo-Chien can take on Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle much more effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using 60 SpA EVs</strong>: If you're willing to give up a bit of bulk, this investment is required to OHKO Iron Bundle with Giga Drain with either a Bold or a Calm nature.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using 100 Speed EVs</strong>: With some sacrifice to bulk, this Speed investment lets Wo-Chien outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Kingambit, and it can be vital in Wo-Chien mirror matches after Terastallization makes it vulnerable to Leech Seed, due to Substitute blocking Leech Seed.</p> </li> </ul>"

Leech Seed reduces Wo-Chien's passivity while allowing teammates to heal after switching in. Ruination hits foes like Arceus-Fairy, Ting-Lu, and Giratina-O. Foul Play is a stronger alternative against physical attackers like Arceus and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground that also does a decent chunk of damage to Koraidon and Zacian-C and allows Wo-Chien to punish physical attackers that have Taunt. Knock Off gives Wo-Chien more of a niche due relevant Pokemon that learn it being rare, and it is useful against foes like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T. However, Arceus formes, which can absorb Knock Off without losing their items, are quite omnipresent. Protect lets Wo-Chien safely rack up Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery. Alternatively, Taunt shuts down setup and entry hazard Pokemon such as Arceus formes and Ting-Lu on the switch. Tera Poison gives Wo-Chien key resistances to attacks like Koraidon's Low Kick, Zacian-C's Play Rough, Double Dance Miraidon's Dazzling Gleam, and the omnipresent U-turn from foes like Landorus-T, Koraidon, and Miraidon while also offering an immunity to Toxic and letting Wo-Chien absorb Toxic Spikes. However, Tera Poison also makes Wo-Chien weak to Ground-type moves from Arceus-Ground and Psychic-type moves from Calyrex-S, respectively. Wo-Chien fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to check Calyrex-S and Arceus-Ground while offering good recovery via Leech Seed to teammates. Wo-Chien benefits from teammates such as Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Landorus-T, which check Koraidon and Zacian-C for it. Special attackers in Arceus-Fairy, Substitute Kyogre, and Eternatus trouble Wo-Chien, so offensive checks to them such as Zacian-C, Choice Scarf Koraidon, Arceus, and Calyrex-S are appreciated. Water Absorb Closdire as a defensive teammate checks Arceus-Fairy, Kyogre, and Eternatus while setting up hazards.</p>"

        "All-Out Attacker (Dark)": {
          "description": "<p>Chien-Pao is an imposing force for any Dark team with its sky-high Speed, blitzing past threats like Iron Valiant and Greninja, and great Attack. Sword of Ruin lets it beat physical walls like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Toxapex, though it doesn't have great bulk, has to watch out for super effective priority moves from Scizor, Lokix, and Slither Wing, and struggles to break past walls like Dondozo and Quagsire. With Swords Dance, it can boost up to beat even the likes of Corviknight and Toxapex if it has Crunch. Fighting-type coverage picks off Dark-types like Kingambit and Greninja. Sacred Sword picks off weakened Garganacl, while Brick Break destroys opposing Dark or Fairy team's dual screens. Ice Shard stops common revenge killers like Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Flutter Mane, and Great Tusk.</p> <p>As Chien-Pao focuses on breaking down foes with its sheer power and Speed, it appreciates support from its teammates. Ting-Lu can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, while Skuntank can set up Toxic Spikes and pressure Fairy-types, all of which make wallbreaking for Chien-Pao easier. Grimmsnarl provides Chien-Pao with dual screens support, making setting up easier. Sableye can burn opposing Pokemon and cripple them with Taunt and Knock Off, removing Heavy-Duty Boots and making foes susceptible to entry hazards, while also acting as a Fighting-type move switch-in. Choice Specs Greninja can clean up after Chien-Pao has done enough damage while also countering Fire-types that would annoy Chien-Pao such as Skeledirge and Cinderace if Chien-Pao does not have Crunch. Hydreigon can break Steel-types for Chien-Pao if it forgoes Fighting-type coverage or Swords Dance, beating Fighting-neutral Steel-types like Corviknight and Scizor. Choice Scarf Meowscarada is able to threaten Pokemon that counter Chien-Pao such as Quaquaval and Choice Scarf users such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Great Tusk while also being able to pivot to Chien-Pao with U-turn.</p>"

        "Swords Dance Sweeper (Ice)": {
          "description": "<p>Chien-Pao's high Speed, solid Attack, and good offensive typing allow it to be a very potent setup sweeper. Icicle Crash is preferred over Ice Spinner for its flinch chance and higher Base Power, the latter of which—among other things—allows it to always 2HKO Sableye and bulky Great Tusk, while Ice Spinner may miss out on these 2HKOs. Crunch allows Chien-Pao to hit Skeledirge and Gholdengo—two problematic Pokemon for Ice teams. Sacred Sword and Brick Break both allow Chien-Pao to threaten Dark-, Steel-, and Ice-types such as Kingambit and opposing Chien-Pao. Sacred Sword is stronger and comes with the ability to ignore Defense boosts, while Brick Break removes Reflect and Light Screen, which is extremely helpful against teams with support from Grimmsnarl or Klefki. Psychic Fangs is an alternative option to Sacred Sword or Brick Break to hit Toxapex and Fighting-types such as Paldean Tauros-F. Sucker Punch is significantly stronger than Ice Shard and allows Chien-Pao to hit Pokemon like Gholdengo, Scizor, and Flutter Mane.</p> <p>This set very much appreciates Aurora Veil support from Abomasnow, as it allows Chien-Pao to set up on many Pokemon that would otherwise threaten it out as well as allowing it to survive revenge killing attempts from the likes of Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Extreme Speed Dragonite. Spikes support from Froslass is also greatly appreciated, as they wear down Pokemon that may otherwise be difficult for Chien-Pao to break, such as Dondozo and Klefki. Although Chien-Pao is able to fit on practically any team, it pairs especially well with other powerful sweepers such as Baxcalibur and Cloyster, weakening or even KOing their checks such as Air Balloon Gholdengo and Skeledirge. Baxcalibur in particular can take on Pokemon such as Toxapex and Paldean Tauros-F with a powerful Earthquake, allowing Chien-Pao to KO them and sweep the opposing team; furthermore, Choice Band Baxcalibur pressures Chien-Pao answers such as Quagsire and Corviknight. Baxcalibur's Thermal Exchange also allows it to switch into Will-O-Wisp that would cripple Chien-Pao as well as be an emergency switch-in to a Fire-type attack. Shell Smash Cloyster appreciates the removal of Skeledirge and Froslass.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band Wallbreaker (Ice)": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Band Chien-Pao is a potent mid-game threat, powerful wallbreaker, and good late-game cleaner. Additionally, it is capable of breaking through physically defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Quagsire, both of which tend to be tough matchups for many other Ice staples. Icicle Crash is preferred over Ice Spinner for its flinch chance and slightly higher Base Power, notably being favored to 2HKO Azumarill and OHKO offensive Pelipper, neither of which are feats Ice Spinner is capable of. Sacred Sword and Brick Break provide crucial coverage for Pokemon such as Kingambit and opposing Chien-Pao, and Sucker Punch allows Chien-Pao to KO faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p> <p>This set heavily appreciates Spikes from Froslass to wear down its switch-ins, sometimes allowing it to grab KOs it would otherwise miss out on; for example, Crunch always 2HKOes physically defensive Toxapex with one layer of Spikes, but it is favored to not 2HKO without any Spikes. Rapid Spin support from Avalugg is also appreciated, allowing Chien-Pao more opportunities to enter the field. Since this set focuses on opening holes in teams, setup sweepers are excellent partners for it, as Chien-Pao can dent or remove their checks to allow the sweep to happen much more easily. Shell Smash Cloyster in particular appreciates Chien-Pao's ability to beat Gholdengo and significantly damage other Pokemon such as Corviknight that Cloyster may otherwise struggle to break through. Dragon Dance Baxcalibur appreciates Chien-Pao's ability to 2HKO Quagsire and physically defensive Corviknight, which normally would stop Baxcalibur in its tracks. Finally, Belly Drum Cetitan appreciates Chien-Pao's ability to break Unaware walls such as Skeledirge and Quagsire; in return, Cetitan acts as speed control if snow is in effect, aiding in Chien-Pao's weakness to Choice Scarf users such as Iron Moth.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band (Dark)": {
          "description": "<p>Chien-Pao is a weapon of destruction for Dark teams, boasting a lofty Speed tier that allows it to outspeed most Pokemon in the metagame like Spectrier, Sneasler, and Tornadus-T. Icicle Crash helps significantly in the Flying matchup, 2HKOing Articuno and defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock, thus preventing any Flying Pokemon from switching in safely, and in the Dragon matchup, OHKOing Walking Wake after Stealth Rock and 2HKOing Hisuian Goodra. Icicle Crash also OHKOes foes like Ursaluna-B, 2HKOes foes like defensive Great Tusk, and secures a 2HKO on defensive Quagsire. Crunch helps in securing an OHKO on Colbur Berry Spectrier and 2HKOing bulkier foes like Hatterene and mixed Toxapex after one layer of Spikes. Ice Shard's priority allows Chien-Pao to OHKO faster targets such as Dragapult and Choice Scarf Enamorus, Landorus, Meowscarada, and Flutter Mane after Stealth Rock. Sacred Sword allows Chien-Pao to secure an OHKO on foes like Kingambit, Choice Specs Greninja, Mamoswine, and Baxcalibur. It also allows Chien-Pao to hit opposing Chien-Pao, albeit with the threat of a Speed tie.</p> <p>Chien-Pao appreciates Mandibuzz's Defog support to prevent it from being worn down by entry hazards. It can also bring Chien-Pao in safely using a slow U-turn. Mandibuzz is a great switch-in for Fighting-type attacks from enemies like Choice Scarf Sneasler and Choice Scarf Great Tusk as well, which Chien-Pao is extremely vulnerable to, as well as being capable of checking setup sweepers like Azumarill and Scizor with Foul Play. In return, Chien-Pao deals with opponents like Sandy Shocks and Baxcalibur, which can cause problems for Mandibuzz. Kingambit has impressive offensive synergy with Chien-Pao due to its neutrality to Fairy-type attacks, being able to eliminate foes like Hatterene with Iron Head and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock. In return, Chien-Pao hits threats to Kingambit like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Iron Treads, Landorus-T, and defensive Gliscor, whose Earthquake can prove disadvantageous for Kingambit. Sableye is a great teammate for Chien-Pao, as its Fighting-type immunity helps it switch directly into attacks from threats like Iron Hands and Zamazenta. Paired with Prankster, Sableye can easily burn threats to Chien-Pao like Azumarill and the aforementioned Fighting-types and paralyze foes like Dragapult, Volcarona, Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, allowing Chien-Pao to break them with ease. Sableye also offers Knock Off support against foes like Articuno and Toxapex, which will suffer damage from hazards after the removal of Heavy-Duty Boots. Greninja is also a great teammate for Chien-Pao due to its excellent coverage, being able to OHKO Fire-type threats like Volcarona and Ogerpon-H after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump and outspeed Choice Scarf users like Enamorus and Galarian Zapdos and eliminate them with Ice Beam when running Choice Scarf itself. Choice Scarf Greninja also takes care of opposing Chien-Pao and Kingambit with Low Kick, while Extrasensory 2HKOes threats like physically defensive Toxapex and Zamazenta and secures an OHKO on Okidogi. In return, Chien-Pao deals with Ogerpon-W, Alolan Muk, and Articuno, which can take advantage of Greninja. Choice Scarf Meowscarada boasts great synergy with Choice Band Chien-Pao, allowing fast pivoting with U-turn and sweeping in the Dark mirror with the help of Play Rough. It also threatens Quagsire, Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Urshifu-R, and Quaquaval with Flower Trick. In return, Chien-Pao breaks foes like Clodsire, Kingambit, Alolan Muk, and opposing Chien-Pao that can hamper Meowscarada's ability to sweep. Teammates like Ting-Lu and Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes for Chien-Pao, boosting its wallbreaking ability and breaking potential Focus Sashes from opponents like Ceruledge. Alolan Muk absorbs Fairy-type attacks from foes like Flutter Mane, Enamorus, and Hatterene for Chien-Pao and threatens them with Poison Jab. Overqwil, on the other hand, switches in against opposing Chien-Pao and Meowscarada with the help of Intimidate and threatens them back with Barb Barrage. Teammates like Galarian Moltres and Hydreigon are other alternatives that can help break foes like defensive Great Tusk and Heatran, which Chien-Pao appreciates. Hydreigon can switch into Fire-type moves aimed at Chien-Pao from foes like Moltres and Ceruledge and set Stealth Rock to facilitate its wallbreaking.</p>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its high Attack and Speed, and incredible ability in Sword of Ruin, Chien-Pao is one of the strongest physical attackers in the game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Icicle Crash</strong>: While Ice Spinner is perfectly accurate, Icicle Crash’s higher power and flinch chance makes it the preferred attack. Additionally, not being a contact move allows Chien-Pao to avoid unnecessary chip damage from Rocky Helmet users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sucker Punch vs Crunch</strong>: Sucker Punch offers priority with a strong base power at the cost of necessitating prediction, while Crunch is a more standard attack whose Defense drop can allow Chien-Pao to potentially break through bulky foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Shard</strong>: Ice Shard is a more consistent albeit weaker alternative to Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sacred Sword</strong>: Sacred Sword provides coverage for Pokemon that resist one or both of Chien-Pao’s STAB attacks, like Heatran, Chi-Yu, and other Chien-Pao. Additionally, ignoring defense boosts allows Chien-Pao to deal more consistent damage to foes who boost their Defense.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: While it can be difficult to fit and very reliant on Focus Sash, Swords Dance boosts Chien-Pao’s Attack to unwallable levels, making it a very potent sweeper.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>0-1 SpA IV</strong>: If using Tera Blast on Jolly Chien-Pao, make sure to to use a SpA IV that's 0-1. This is because if Flutter Mane uses Charm, any SpA IV that's higher will result in Tera Blast becoming a Special Attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Throat Chop</strong>: Throat Chop disables the use of sound-based moves from targets like Skeledirge and Sylveon, but these matchups are so uncommon that it generally isn't worth using over Crunch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Ice Spinner can be used as a more consistent Ice STAB, however it makes Chien-Pao more vulnerable to Rocky Helmet users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sheer Cold</strong>: While it may seem alluring, Sheer Cold is usually a waste of a slot on Chien-Pao sets like this, as its standard attacks already hit most relevant foes. Even if Chien-Pao fails to KO a foe, it will generally leave it within range for a teammate.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li>With few exceptions, Chien-Pao is about all-out offense. However, its choice of item drastically affects its strategy. Tera Types have been organized by item choice to better clarify how each Tera Type works in that context.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Tera Types for Focus Sash and Life Orb</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Chien-Pao offers power in spades without needing to Terastallize, only needing it on very rare occasions to break past specific walls or dodge priority moves aimed at it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric can be used in tandem with Tera Blast to improve Chien-Pao’s matchup against key threats such as Urshifu-R and Dondozo while also making it immune to paralysis.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost doesn’t offer much offensive benefit, but it allows Chien-Pao to dodge Dragonite’s Extreme Speed, which can be particularly useful if using Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass lets Chien-Pao survive Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes, which otherwise threatens to OHKO through Focus Sash. Combined with Tera Blast, Chien-Pao still threatens big damage into Urshifu-R and Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosts Sucker Punch to extreme power levels while making Crunch exceptionally difficult to switch into without a resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice can allow Chien-Pao to finish foes off with Ice Shard from higher ranges and makes Icicle Crash an even more formidable tool.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Tera Types for Choice Band</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Chien-Pao is already plenty powerful, Choice Band combined with Tera can elevate 2HKOs to OHKOs on some of the bulkiest walls in the meta. For this reason, Tera can be worth using on Choice Band sets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark turns Choice Band Crunch into a devastating wallbreaker move that few can withstand, OHKOing Max HP Annihilape and Scizor if using an Adamant nature. Neutralizing Chien-Pao’s Steel-type weakness also makes it less vulnerable to Scizor’s Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice gives Choice Band Icicle Crash enough power to challenge even physically defensive Ting-Lu, having approximately a 69% chance to OHKO if using an Adamant nature; be warned, however, that Ting-Lu often Terastallizes in front of Chien-Pao, making this inconsistent. The extra power behind Ice Shard is also a welcome boost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy combined with Choice Band Tera Blast handily defeats some of Chien-Pao's less common checks, OHKOing standard variants of Annihilape and Assault Vest Iron Hands. It also removes several weaknesses, most notably turning Chien-Pao's 4x Fighting-type weakness into a resistance.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly or Adamant</strong>: This offensive spread works with all standard sets. Adamant gives Chien-Pao a significant power boost, but Jolly is important for Speed tying with Flutter Mane and opposing Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 68 Def / 188 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This alternate spread is commonly associated with Choice Band, fully maximizing Attack while still maintaining enough Speed to outrun Timid Iron Moth. When used with an appropriate Tera type, the Defense investment lets Chien-Pao survive Life Orb Mimikyu's Play Rough into Shadow Sneak.</p> </li> </ul>"

Chien-Pao can have a hard time breaking through defensive Pokemon like Intimidate Corviknight and Quaquaval, making partners like Gouging Fire and Dragonite appreciated. Choice Scarf users like Walking Wake can be tough foes for Chien-Pao, forcing it out; this makes slow pivots like Meloetta and RegenVest Manaphy good teammates, as they can deal with these Choice Scarf users and also help bring it in safely after taking a hit. Chien-Pao's weakness to Stealth Rock can become a problem quickly if not accounted for, so entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and Mandibuzz are good partners.</p>"

The preference will come down to how much the team relies on Ting-Lu to phaze setup threats such as Calm Mind Arceus and Miraidon.</li> <li>Leftovers is mandatory on Ting-Lu since it does not have any form of reliable recovery.</li> <li>Ting-Lu will very rarely need to use its Tera types, as its natural typing provides a strong Electric immunity for Miraidon. Tera Steel provides a Dragon resistance versus Miraidon while also letting Ting-Lu handle Dazzling Gleam from Calm Mind + Tera Fairy Miraidon, and it also grants an immunity to Toxic from Eternatus and Toxapex. Tera Fairy provides a Dragon immunity against Miraidon, allowing Ting-Lu to better answer Tera Dragon sets with Calm Mind or Choice Specs, and Ting-Lu becomes resistant or immune to Koraidon's STAB moves.

Tera Water allows it to take Kyogre's STAB moves while also resisting Koraidon's Flare Blitz. It also lets Ting-Lu check the rare, but otherwise hard to check, Chi-Yu and Walking Wake.

          "description": "<p>Ting-Lu is a fantastic asset for Dark teams due to its access to entry hazards and great bulk, supported further by Vessel of Ruin weakening special attackers such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene. Earthquake is a reliable STAB move that hits most of the metagame for decent damage while also scaring Clodsire out and preventing it from setting Toxic Spikes. Heavy Slam hits Fairy-types that would otherwise overpower Ting-Lu, such as Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, while also threatening Hatterene trying to bounce back hazards. Stealth Rock and Spikes allow Ting-Lu to support wallbreakers such as Meowscarada or Greninja. Whirlwind allows Ting-Lu to phase out setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Curse Dondozo and rack up entry hazard damage, while Ruination provides consistent damage against other walls such as Amoonguss and Corviknight that don't mind any of Ting-Lu's other moves.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Greninja all appreciate Ting-Lu's ability to set entry hazards, as they wear down common defensive answers such as Toxapex, Iron Treads, and Dondozo. In return, they can scare out threats to Ting-Lu; Meowscarada can deal with Greninja, Chien-Pao and Greninja can threaten Great Tusk, and Kingambit can force out Fairy-types such as Hatterene. Skuntank is a good partner as well, since it offers a crucial neutrality to Fairy, threatens Fairy-types, and sets and clears Toxic Spikes, augmenting Ting-Lu's entry hazards and improving its longevity. Additionally, Skuntank can utilize Fire Spin to further chip down teams and trap Klefki, improving Ting-Lu's matchup against Fairy. In return, Ting-Lu can assist in Ground matchups through its bulk. Sableye is also a great partner due to its Fighting immunity, taking attacks Ting-Lu can't such as Great Tusk's and Iron Hands's Close Combat.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Ting-Lu's exceptional bulk and utility options make it an invaluable asset to Ground teams, walling threats like Dragapult, Espathra, and Hydreigon. Earthquake threatens Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Volcarona. Alternatively, Throat Chop hits Espathra for more damage and shuts down Air Balloon Gholdengo. Ruination allows Ting-Lu to quickly wear down the likes of opposing Ting-Lu, Hatterene, and Dragonite, while Body Press may be used to deal more damage to Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Hydreigon. Spikes or Stealth Rock in conjunction with Whirlwind sets Ting-Lu apart from other entry hazard setters; it's capable of wearing down the opponent's defensive core and weakens threats such as Greninja, Meowscarada, and Baxcalibur. Additionally, Whirlwind phazes threatening sweepers like Scizor and Ceruledge.</p> <p>Ting-Lu's entry hazards are heavily appreciated by Great Tusk, which threatens out Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Gallade, and Greninja; Sandy Shocks, which deals with Water-types like Pelipper, Quaquaval, and Dondozo; and Garchomp, which threatens Corviknight, Rotom-C, and Breloom with its Fire-type coverage. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Great Tusk removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Sableye and Brambleghast via Knock Off to enhance Ting-Lu's phazing, which enables Clodsire and Gastrodon as entry hazard setters to wither down threats such as Greninja and Ceruledge more efficiently. Water Absorb Clodsire adds a Water immunity, can switch into attacks from Greninja, Quaquaval, and Meowscarada, and helps wear down the opposing team with Toxic Spikes or Toxic. Gastrodon walls Water-type Pokemon like Pelipper, Dondozo, and Rotom-W and assists with spreading entry hazards. Iron Treads eases Ting-Lu's pivoting by removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin and checks Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Hatterene. Quagsire stalls out physical setup sweepers such as Mimikyu, Chien-Pao, and Iron Hands and also helps wear down defensive cores using Toxic.</p>"

Note that while using Taunt against Toxapex can be useful, it is highly likely to run Mental Herb, which risks getting Ting-Lu poisoned.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect with Leftovers is a strong choice when running Ting-Lu with high sustain teammates such as Toxapex.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fissure</strong>: Fissure lets Ting-Lu potentially punish passive Pokemon without Substitute, such as Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: Getting Stealth Rock and Spikes together makes Whirlwind a very effective damage dealing tool, in addition to supporting other offensive Pokemon. However, it can be difficult to set up without compromising Ting-Lu's damage output.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Even with Ting-Lu's fantastic bulk, Terastallization greatly increases the amount of Pokemon it can beat one-on-one, such as Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: In addition to a useful Fighting resistance, Tera Fairy helps Ting-Lu against powerful Dragon-types like Choice Band Dragonite and Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison gives Ting-Lu an important resistance to Fairy and Fighting, and it lets it absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: With Tera Water, Ting-Lu has a significantly better matchup against Urshifu-R. The Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu matchups can also benefit, but be mindful of potential Tera Blast coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel retaining a Fighting weakness is unfortunate, but in exchange, Heavy Slam will OHKO even most bulky Flutter Mane, and it gives Ting-Lu a good matchup against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Ting-Lu's lack of reliable recovery usually makes Sitrus Berry the most reliable method of surviving an extra attack. Leftovers is a good alternative if Sitrus Berry is needed somewhere else, and even preferable if running Protect.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: Mental Herb can be used to nullify one use of Taunt or Encore, which Ting-Lu is fairly vulnerable to, at the cost of reducing its lifespan with a lack of any recovery.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Maximum Physical Defense versus Maximum Special Defense</strong>: Specializing in one defensive stat depends on which threats Ting-Lu needs to handle, with physically defensive variants preforming better against threats like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Kingambit, and when Terastallized, Chien-Pao, Azumarill, and Baxcalibur. For specially defensive variants, major targets include Gholdengo and Iron Moth, and when Terastallized, Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>212 HP / 4 Atk / 116 Def / 156 SpD / 20 Spe with Impish</strong>: When Terastallized to a neutral typing, Ting-Lu survives up to four Icicle Crashes from Jolly Focus Sash Chien-Pao. With Leftovers and Protect, it also avoids the 2HKO from Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage. The Speed EVs let it outrun uninvested Hippowdon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>44 HP / 252 Def / 212 SpD with Careful</strong>: This EV spread is optimized for use with Sitrus Berry, letting Ting-Lu avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage, and Timid Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast when Terastallized to a neutral typing.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Ting-Lu is an effective defensive support in STABmons, as with Ceaseless Edge or Spikes, it can serve as a very bulky entry hazard setter. In addition, thanks to its ability, its well-distributed stats, and Shore Up, it is able to check many attackers such as Iron Moth, Ceruledge, and Garganacl. Spikes should be used if reliability and lack of PP are a concern, especially on stall teams. Precipice Blades maximizes damage against Toxapex and other Ground-weak Pokemon like Iron Hands; however, Earthquake is a fine option if accuracy is a concern. There are multiple options for the last moveslot: Parting Shot lets Ting-Lu safely bring in offensive teammates via a slow pivot, Foul Play gives it a better matchup against setup sweepers like Salamence, Whirlwind phazes setup sweepers that Ting-Lu can't handle like non-Taunt Annihilape, and Knock Off can remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots from pivots like Tyranitar. Covert Cloak prevents Ting-Lu from being poisoned from Mortal Spin users like Toxapex, while Leftovers gives to it more passive recovery. Both Tera Ghost and Tera Poison allow Ting-Lu to surprise Fighting-types like Iron Hands; Tera Poison grants it an immunity to Toxic and lets it resist Grass-type attacks, while Tera Ghost allows it to spinblock. Alternatively, Tera Fairy and Tera Water provide great resistances to Roaring Moon and Palafin, respectively. Ting-Lu fits in a variety of teams, ranging from bulky offense to stall. Offensive teammates such as Iron Valiant, Palafin, and Iron Hands appreciate that Ting-Lu can both set Spikes and act as a slow pivot with Parting Shot. These three Pokemon also beat Great Tusk, one of Ting-Lu's biggest checks, as it is able to beat it with Fighting-type moves and remove its entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Dondozo are able to check Pokemon that Ting-Lu can't, which include Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Mimikyu. Ting-Lu struggles to make progress with entry hazards up, so entry hazard removal from the likes of Great Tusk, Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Corviknight is recommended.</p>"

Whirlwind forces entry hazard damage onto foes and ensures Ting-Lu isn't setup fodder for threats like Talonflame and Quaquaval.

An incredible defensive profile allows Ting-Lu to be a consistent, valuable check to Calyrex-S, Miraidon, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Taunt prevents Arceus formes from setting up or healing and shuts down Toxapex. Ruination reduces Ting-Lu's passivity and hits Giratina-O and Landorus-T. Earthquake hits Miraidon and prevents Zacian-C from safely switching in, while Payback OHKOes Calyrex-S and—with Ting-Lu's low Speed—consistently has 100 Base Power. Whirlwind can be used over Taunt or Ruination on teams that are more vulnerable to setup sweepers like Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Fissure is a niche alternative over Ruination that helps with Taunt Arceus formes and is more of a threat to setup Pokemon. Tera Grass, Poison, and Steel all allow it to resist Calyrex-S's Grass Knot and offer varying defensive utility, with Tera Grass helping with Kyogre and Arceus-Ground, Tera Poison helping with Koraidon and Toxic Spikes, and Tera Steel helping with Arceus and Miraidon. Ting-Lu's defensive utility and the pressure brought by its entry hazards are appreciated by nearly every team bar hyper offense. Ting-Lu is vulnerable to strong physical attackers like Zacian-C and Koraidon, so teammates that can check them, like Landorus-T on bulky offense teams and Toxapex and Skeledirge on balance teams, make for natural partners. Extreme Killer Arceus is a great partner that helps check Calyrex-S and appreciates Ting-Lu's Spikes bringing opposing Pokemon into Extreme Speed range.

It also eases the matchup against Palafin-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy has good synergy with Chi-Yu's former typing, giving it a vital Fighting-type resistance and ensuring Chi-Yu is not walled by Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is a huge help against Azumarill and Palafin-H and lets Chi-Yu more safely set up Flame Charge against Spore users like Breloom and Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost is Chi-Yu's best hope against Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Breloom's Mach Punch.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Chi-Yu has shockingly decent Special Defense, so Assault Vest lets it preform much better against Flutter Mane and opposing Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb lets you get away with playing this set far more offensively at the cost of being even weaker to priority attacks than usual.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: If using a more offensive spread, Focus Sash can be worth it to flip the tables on fast offensive foes such as Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Eject Pack</strong>: This turns Overheat into a one-use pivot move, surprising foes with a momentum shift in your favor.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EVs</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 12 Def / 124 SpA / 4 SpD / 140 Spe with Modest</strong>: This bulky spread is perfect for Assault Vest and Flame Charge, letting Chi-Yu outspeed Iron Bundle after a boost and avoid an OHKO from Breloom's Mach Punch.

Beads of Ruin also not only indirectly makes Chi-Yu hit harder but also empowers its special attacking teammates, with Iron Bundle and Gholdengo in particular being excellent partners due to their ability to either overwhelm shared checks like Ting-Lu or outright beat some of Chi-Yu's checks, such as Garchomp for the former and Glimmora for the latter. Furthermore, Chi-Yu has very good Speed, allowing it to naturally outspeed a considerable portion of the metagame. However, Chi-Yu is not without glaring weaknesses, as its HP and Defense are absurdly low, which leaves it vulnerable to common priority moves such as Palafin's Jet Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. In addition, despite Dark / Fire being a good type combination offensively, it leaves Chi-Yu vulnerable defensively, as its weaknesses to Ground-, Rock- and Water-type moves in addition to Stealth Rock compromise its ability to switch in and fire off more attacks. Finally, Pokemon such as Glimmora, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp have the ability to potentially switch into Chi-Yu and threaten it out, with Ting-Lu's Tablets of Ruin being a particular annoyance due to it offsetting Beads of Ruin.

Tera Steel also powers up Roaring Moon's Iron Head.</li> <li>Tera Fairy allows Roaring Moon to resist Fighting-type attacks while becoming immune to Dragon-type attacks, letting it defeat Koraidon and Iron Valiant, both of which outspeed and threaten to OHKO Roaring Moon otherwise.</li> <li>Roaring Moon loves the support of Koraidon, as it activates Roaring Moon's Protosynthesis via Orichalcum Pulse and reliably threatens Pokemon such as Koraidon, Miraidon, and Ice-types like Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle. In return, Roaring Moon threatens non-Terastallized Skeledirge.</li> <li>Koraidon and Roaring Moon both struggle with defensive Great Tusk, so they can team up with Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao, which threaten all Great Tusk sets. Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao also threaten Koraidon and Miraidon, with Iron Bundle naturally outspeeding non-Choice Scarf variants and Chien-Pao threatening them with priority Ice Shard.</li> <li>Defensive Great Tusk and Ting-Lu also work well with Roaring Moon, as they can set up entry hazards for Roaring Moon's team and check Koraidon and Miraidon, respectively. Great Tusk in particular can use Rapid Spin, giving Roaring Moon more opportunities to switch in, while Ting-Lu can phaze threatening boosters like Espathra with Whirlwind and set up Spikes.</li> <li>Specially defensive Corviknight can check Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, both of which outspeed and threaten Roaring Moon, and can Defog hazards away, giving Roaring Moon more opportunities to switch in.</li> <li>Roaring Moon can easily pivot into Chi-Yu, which takes advantage of the sun set by Koraidon and threatens walls like Great Tusk, Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Terastallized Skeledirge.</li> <li>Gholdengo also makes for a decent partner, as not only does it have perfect defensive synergy with Roaring Moon, but it can also reliably block all common forms of hazard removal. This allows Roaring Moon’s team to keep up hazards, in particular Spikes, for it to eventually break down walls.</li> </ul>"

Thunderbolt is a good option to hit Corviknight, Dondozo, and Toxapex super effectively and make cleaning up against Flying and Water teams easier after the Ground-type is removed. Energy Ball is a good alternative to more easily beat specially defensive Gastrodon and Rotom-W, but Grass Knot is an option to beat Dondozo after Spikes.

Hence, it appreciates teammates that can cover what it cannot, and it also appreciates teammates that help it switch in, as it is quite frail. Klefki can set up dual screens, which aids it in switching, and also set up Spikes, which makes it easier for Iron Valiant to clean. Klefki is also a good switch-in against opposing Fairy-types like Mimikyu. Flutter Mane and Mimikyu can weaken teams to let Iron Valiant clean up or they can clean up after it.

Azumarill checks Fire-types such as Paldean Tauros-F, Volcarona, and Iron Moth and Ground-types such as Iron Treads and Clodsire. Hatterene is a great partner, as it can break through Poison-types like Glimmora, Toxapex, and Amoonguss while also preventing entry hazards.

Flutter Mane is another good partner for cleaning up after Koraidon breaks through defensive Arceus formes and Zacian-C.

Outrage does sport overwhelming power and can 2HKO Toxapex and Alomomola, which Dragon Claw cannot do without entry hazard support.

Tera Fire has the additional benefit of granting a Fairy resistance and a burn immunity.</li> <li>While not providing any boost in offensive power, Tera Steel offers several useful resistances to Fairy, Ice, and Dragon, which can help Koraidon take on Pokemon like Zacian-C, Miraidon, Arceus-Fairy, and Chien-Pao.</li> <li>Choice Band Koraidon is an insanely powerful wallbreaker that can break past all of its normal checks and switch-ins. However, it tends to be worn down easily due to being vulnerable to all entry hazards and often taking Rocky Helmet damage and Flare Blitz recoil. Thus, it pairs best with teammates like Zacian-C, which can clean up after Koraidon has broken down the main defensive core.

This is better than Close Combat, as it doesn't drop Koraidon's defenses while still having 120 Base Power against crucial targets.</li> <li>Stomping Tantrum allows Koraidon to 2HKO Toxapex and Skeledirge without power boosts.

Usually, Flame Charge needs the boost from Tera Fire to fix its low Base Power and allow Koraidon to pick up KOs on healthier targets.</li> <li>Flare Blitz is a more powerful alternative to Flame Charge, which makes Koraidon significantly less reliant on Terastallization to score KOs on the opponent's defensive Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy after Swords Dance. This can open up opportunities for its fellow sweeping teammates.</li> <li>Dragon Claw fixes Koraidon's issues with Rayquaza and Giratina; however, it does make Koraidon much less threatening against Skeledirge and Toxapex, as it can no longer 2HKO either.</li> <li>Life Orb is the key to Koraidon's functioning. Life Orb is absolutely necessary, as the power boost and recoil differentiate how this Koraidon is used compared to its other sets.</li> <li>Tera Fire is necessary, as it gives Koraidon an immunity to Will-O-Wisp, resistances to Fairy and Steel, and a huge power boost to Koraidon's Fire-type attacks. This is especially efficient with Flame Charge and is often key to enabling Koraidon to sweep.</li> <li>Life Orb Koraidon fits well on any remotely offensively-minded team because it has the ability to lure in defensive Pokemon and beat them due to its unexpected Life Orb-boosted power. This can be used to open up teammates like Swords Dance, Dragon Dance, or offensive Calm Mind Arceus formes, Zacian-C, and Double Dance Miraidon.</li> </ul>"

Low Kick threatens Arceus and Ting-Lu and is Koraidon's preferred STAB move for its 120 Base Power against the majority of the metagame without Close Combat's downside. Outrage and Dragon Claw both OHKO Miraidon and opposing Koraidon, but Outrage is preferred for its ability to 2HKO Toxapex and Skeledirge, though it lets any remaining Fairy-types easily revenge kill Koraidon. An Adamant nature allows Choice Scarf Koraidon to 2HKO Arceus-Fairy after Stealth Rock and always OHKO Calyrex-S. Tera Fire boosts Flare Blitz's power to insane levels, gives Koraidon a Will-O-Wisp immunity, and allows it to resist attacks from Arceus-Fairy and Zacian-C. Tera Ghost makes Koraidon immune to Extreme Speed, letting it more effectively serve as an Extreme Killer Arceus check. Koraidon can use U-turn to safely pivot in Pokemon like Calyrex-S and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, which threaten its checks such as Toxapex and Skeledirge. Teammates like Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, and Arceus can weaken Koraidon's checks and potentially bait out Terastallization, enabling Koraidon to clean up late-game. Defensive teammates like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T are appreciated. Ting-Lu checks Choice Scarf users faster than Koraidon, such as Calyrex-S and Miraidon, and provides entry hazard support. Landorus-T offers immense utility via U-turn, bringing pokemon like Calm Mind Arceus-Ground and Calyrex-S in to threaten Koraidon's checks. Rocky Helmet also helps to chip opposing Koraidon, Zacian-C, and Extreme Killer Arceus to bring them into Low Kick range.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Koraidon is one of the best setup sweepers thanks to its perfect coverage and good Speed tier. Scale Shot, when paired with Loaded Dice, gives Koraidon an incredibly strong Dragon-type STAB attack that lets it outspeed Zacian-C and Calyrex-S and break Eternatus, Giratina-O, Skeledirge, and Toxapex. Flare Blitz is Koraidon's best way of hitting Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, and Calyrex-S. Low Kick is Koraidon's most spammable move, being 120 Base Power against most of the metagame without the drawback of Close Combat, and it threatens Arceus. Tera Fire gives Koraidon a Fairy-type resistance, letting it beat both Arceus-Fairy and Zacian-C, gives Koraidon a Will-O-Wisp immunity, and increases Flare Blitz's damage output. Tera Ghost gives Koraidon an immunity to Extreme Speed. Koraidon fits best on offensive teams, where it can break through physical walls for its teammates. Teammates like Zacian-C and Arceus can bait out Terastallization, making it easier for Koraidon to sweep. In return, Koraidon can break through physical walls such as Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Landorus-T for them, as it 2HKOes all three with Scale Shot. Koraidon is reliant on Scale Shot's Speed boost to avoid being revenge killed by Calyrex-S, Zacian-C, and Choice Scarf Koraidon, so having teammates that can take advantage of Fairy-types that switch into Koraidon, such as Landorus-T and Skeledirge for Zacian-C and Zacian-C and Toxapex for Arceus-Fairy, are appreciated. Finally, Scale Shot's Defense drop means that Koraidon is susceptible to priority such as Arceus's Extreme Speed. As such, Pokemon that can switch into Arceus, such as Landorus-T and Zacian-C, and Pokemon that can break through it, such as Life Orb Calyrex-S, are appreciated.</p>"

Volt Switch does the same thing with much more power but requires that the opposing team's Ground-types be eliminated first.</li> <li>Overheat annihilates Iron Treads, and since immunities to both of Miraidon's STAB attacks are common, it can ease prediction against players attempting to cycle between Ground- and Fairy-types.</li> <li>Tera Dragon allows Miraidon to 2HKO Ting-Lu, one of the only Pokemon capable of taking two consecutive Choice Specs Draco Meteors.</li> <li>Tera Electric lets Miraidon break nearly any Pokemon without an Electric immunity in the game, even 2HKOing Blissey outright. Tera Electric is also useful to overpower Calm Mind Arceus formes without the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor.</li> <li>Since Choice Specs Miraidon has no reliable check in the metagame, it works excellently as a wallbreaker for the vast majority of teams.</li> <li>Its ability to break or greatly weaken Ting-Lu is a boon for teammates like Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost, Arceus-Poison, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Dark and is helpful to prevent Ting-Lu from laying Spikes at all.</li> <li>Miraidon can lure in and KO Clodsire, so Pokemon that appreciate Clodsire taken out make good partners such as Eternatus, Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy, and Kyogre.</li> <li>Physically offensive teammates like Zacian-C can make for good partners, as Miraidon can come in on many of their checks such as Skeledirge and Toxapex with little worry.</li> <li>Since Miraidon can quickly overwhelm Ting-Lu and Clodsire, it's important to anticipate Tera Steel or Tera Fairy from them and react accordingly.</li> </ul>"

This also usually lets Miraidon win against Blissey without Tera Ground. Electro Drift's higher damage output allows Miraidon to OHKO bulky Arceus-Fairy sets and OHKO Zacian-C from behind a Substitute.</li> <li>The fourth slot is flexible. Substitute eases prediction and can take advantage of passive walls and foes that attempt to pivot around Miraidon. Overheat nails Iron Treads and can also hit Ting-Lu or Clodsire, which often use Tera Steel on Miraidon's Draco Meteor, and it can also be used as a neutral hit to prevent switching between Ground- and Fairy-types to stall out Electric Terrain turns. Taunt can help prevent setup from Pokemon that could take advantage of Miraidon after a Draco Meteor stat drop such as Calm Mind Arceus formes and Ting-Lu or Clodsire using Spikes.</li> <li>If the opponent has not already Terastallized, care should be taken when facing Ting-Lu and Clodsire, as their Tera Steel or Tera Fairy can turn the tide against Miraidon quickly. While this leaves both foes open to being chipped down, Miraidon can in turn be hit by Whirlwind, Toxic, or damaged heavily outright by Earthquake and Ruination. If Miraidon wins the exchange, it's often left at low HP and open to being revenge killed.</li> <li>This set works excellently on Sticky Web teams in particular, as it greatly appreciates being able to outspeed Zacian-C and Choice Scarf Pokemon like Eternatus. At the same time, it also works excellently for bulky offense and balance teams that are seeking a solid way to break opposing balance and stall teams.</li> <li>Spikes support can be crucial for this set, as the chip damage can guarantee the OHKO on opposing Ting-Lu; Ting-Lu, Groudon, or Clodsire can set up Spikes for Miraidon.</li> <li>Arceus formes such as Arceus-Ghost, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Dark make for good offensive partners, as all of them like Ting-Lu being taken out of the picture.</li> <li>Zacian-C is a huge annoyance thanks to its higher Speed and Dragon-type immunity; as such, solid checks to it such as Skeledirge, Groudon, and Toxapex are much appreciated. Lures for Zacian-C such as Thunder Wave Arceus-Fairy or Arceus-Grass can cripple Zacian-C and leave it as an easy target for Miraidon later in the game.</li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Walking Wake is a terrifying wallbreaker on Water teams due to its powerful STAB combination, great offensive stats, and Dragon typing that aids against Dragon, Grass, Poison and Electric teams. Draco Meteor OHKOes Dragon-types like Baxcalibur, Kommo-o, and Hydreigon and deals with troublesome Water-type answers such as Toxapex, Sinistcha, Volcanion, and Gastrodon. Hydro Pump offers a powerful Water-type STAB attack to hit Steel- and Fairy-types like Gholdengo, Clefable, Kingambit, and Heatran as well as OHKOes Volcarona after a Quiver Dance. Scald offers a reliable Water-type STAB attack due to its accuracy and ability to potentially burn switch-ins such as Alolan Muk, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Snorlax, while Flip Turn provides Walking Wake with a pivoting move, reducing the need to predict and also maintaining momentum in a match. Alternatively, Hydro Steam not only is reliable accuracy-wise but also aids against sun Fire teams, tearing through every Pokemon barring Volcanion in conjunction with Protosynthesis. Flamethrower may be used instead to threaten the aforementioned Steel-types as well as Ice- and Grass-types such as Alolan Ninetales, Frosmoth, and Amoonguss The given EV spread ensures that Protosynthesis always give a Speed boost under sun, allowing Walking Wake to outpace threats like Ogerpon-H and Choice Scarf Ninetales.</p> <p>Empoleon offers a resistance to Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks, walling opposing Walking Wake, Flutter Mane, Hydreigon, and Alolan Ninetales. Furthermore, Empoleon has a notable Freeze-Dry neutrality and provides Stealth Rock and Knock Off support to wear down walls like Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Iron Hands. In return, Walking Wake threatens Pokemon like Baxcalibur, Great Tusk, and Zapdos and forms a pivoting core via Flip Turn. Toxapex is heavily valued for its Fairy-type resistance, switching into threats such as Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus, as well as adds on to Walking Wake's offensive pressure via Toxic Spikes. Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W break special walls like Empoleon, Gastrodon, and Clodsire. In return, Walking Wake threatens Poison-type walls such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Galarian Weezing. Pelipper provides rain support to enhance Walking Wake's wallbreaking capabilities, notably allowing Walking Wake to 2HKO Assault Vest Iron Hands with Hydro Pump, as well as Knock Off to remove vital items like Iron Hands and Galarian Slowking's Assault Vests and U-turn to form a pivoting core and bring in Walking Wake safely. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott removes faster Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Dragapult, Greninja, and Flutter Mane using its Fighting- and Dark-type coverage while providing Spikes support with Ceaseless Edge. Additionally, Hisuian Samurott offers vital pivoting with Flip Turn, preserving momentum and wearing down switch-ins while also luring in entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Great Tusk for Walking Wake. Quaquaval offers entry hazard removal via Rapid Spin to allow Walking Wake to pivot more freely, as well as Knock Off support and pivoting using U-turn and Flip Turn. Choice Scarf Greninja is a great speed control option and a great check to enemies like Iron Valiant and Dragapult. Gastrodon can wall Choice Specs Dragapult and Flutter Mane lacking Energy Ball and provides entry hazards to aid in Walking Wake's wallbreaking. Manaphy can heavily wear down Steel and Poison teams and wears down shared checks like Alolan Muk and Water Absorb Clodsire. In return, Manaphy appreciates Walking Wake taking care of Electric-types such as Zapdos, Thundurus-T, and Rotom-W and Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Baxcalibur.</p>"

It also outspeeds common Choice Scarf users such as Great Tusk, Flamigo, and Iron Treads, which lets it clean Ground, Flying, and Fire teams late-game. With strong STAB moves in Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump, Walking Wake blows past Baxcalibur and Great Tusk. Flamethrower roasts Steel-types like Scizor and Gholdengo, though it lacks the firepower to 2HKO specially defensive Corviknight. Hydro Steam, emboldened by sun, lets Walking Wake demolish Fire teams. Alternatively, Dragon Pulse provides a weaker but more consistent STAB attack, which is great against opposing Dragon teams. The given EV spread and Timid nature cause Protosynthesis to boost Speed, allowing Walking Wake to outspeed Chlorophyll Scovillain and Choice Scarf Cinderace.</p> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult is an excellent teammate, as it can wear down or eliminate bulky threats such as Corviknight and Hatterene and is also fast enough to deal with Choice Specs Flutter Mane for Walking Wake. Baxcalibur, Hydreigon, and Haxorus appreciate Walking Wake providing speed control, allowing them to wallbreak more effectively. These teammates also batter down defensive walls such as Clodsire, Gholdengo, and Toxapex, making cleaning up with Walking Wake much easier. Dragalge can pivot into Fairy-type moves from Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant as well as set Toxic Spikes to further wear down the opposing team. This also synergizes well with Garchomp, which sets entry hazards in Spikes and Stealth Rock, phazes the opposition with Dragon Tail or Roar, and pressures Poison- and Steel-types like Clodsire and Klefki. Cyclizar gets rid of entry hazards for Walking Wake, allowing it to come onto the field more.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p>Dragon Pulse is a nice option to consistently wear down Regenerator cores when combating Poison teams, not leaving Special Attack drops like Draco Meteor.</p> </section>"

Toxic Chain and Guard Dog are both helpful in allowing Okidogi to break through teams. Toxic Chain puts more pressure on bulky walls like Sableye, Avalugg, Quagsire, and Skeledirge, which forces them to either switch out or repeatedly use recovery moves. Guard Dog, on the other hand, punishes Intimidate from the likes of Landorus-T, Gyarados, and Paldean Tauros-F and stops phazing from threats such as Ting-Lu and Empoleon. Drain Punch is a useful STAB move that keeps Okidogi healthy and deals solid damage against threats like Kingambit, Garganacl, and Heatran. Knock Off is used to punish Ghost-types like Gholdengo, Ceruledge, and Dragapult that effortlessly wall Okidogi otherwise. It also annoys switch-ins like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Quagsire by removing their Black Sludge. For the final moveslot there are three main options. Taunt prevents Haze from Toxapex and Articuno, Substitute is useful to set up in the face of Pokemon like Amoonguss and Galarian Weezing, and Ice Punch blows through Flying- and Ground-types like Dragonite, Clodsire, and Gliscor. 96 Speed EVs allow Okidogi to outspeed threats like Adamant Torterra, Jolly Kingambit, and Jolly Azumarill, with the rest of the EVs maximizing Okidogi's specially defensive bulk, allowing it to comfortably survive offensive Heatran or Glimmora's Earth Power.</p> <p>Okidogi's crippling weakness to any Psychic-type attack makes Alolan Muk an essential teammate, being able to handle threats like Espathra, Iron Valiant, Hisuian Zoroark, and Hatterene with its STAB moves. Overqwil, while not as specially bulky, still provides a Psychic immunity while providing support in stacking entry hazards to ease Okidogi's sweep. Galarian Weezing similarly fills an important role with its immunity to Ground-type attacks from threats like Great Tusk, Mamoswine, and Clodsire. Once switched in, it can burn physical threats along with removing hazards, allowing Okidogi to have a much easier time switching in and setting up late-game. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can soak up special attacks from foes such as Greninja and Walking Wake, remove Landorus with Ice beam, and provides a Psychic neutrality and the ability to create Future Sight traps for Okidogi to exploit. Amoonguss provides assistance in scaring off Ground- and Water-types like Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Urshifu-R with its Grass-type STAB attacks and provides Spore support to give Okidogi a safe opportunity to switch in and begin setting up. Toxapex's solid physical bulk in conjunction with Haze and a Rocky Helmet provides utility in wearing threats down like Zamazenta, Mimikyu, and Ceruledge. Salazzle, thank to its high Speed and ability to wear down physical walls like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Corviknight with Corrosion-enabled Toxic and ability to impede setup sweepers, such as Baxcalibur, Manaphy, and Ogerpon formes, with Encore excels at removing threats Okidogi doesn't like. Glimmora provides similar Corrosion utility, along with the ability to set up hazards and threaten dangerous Flying-types like Dragonite, Moltres, and Zapdos with STAB Power Gem. It can also remove hazards with Mortal Spin to give Okidogi safe entry. Choice Specs Iron Moth's Overheat is great at removing dangerous threats such as Gliscor and Landorus instantly, along with using Discharge to remove Flying- and Water-types like Moltres, Enamorus, and Toxapex. Gengar has valuable utility in its ability to remove pesky Ghost-types like Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Brambleghast along with being able to Trick its Choice Specs onto walls like Clodsire, making them far easier to break through. Choice Scarf Sneasler makes a solid friend for Okidogi, being able to handle faster threats like Baxcalibur and Chien-Pao, along with using Switcheroo against their shared checks like Skeledirge and Quagsire.</p>"

However, Ogerpon faces stiff competition from other offensive Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana, as well as the other Ogerpon formes that possess a beneficial dual typing and an automatic 1.2x boost to their attacks. Superpower allows Ogerpon to wreak havoc on defensive cores using Ferrothorn and Heatran as Grass-type switch-ins, scoring a clean OHKO on Heatran and heavily denting physically defensive Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance. Meadow Plate is the item of choice, OHKOing Gliscor after Swords Dance with Stealth Rock chip, as well as potentially OHKOing Toxapex after Tera Grass and Swords Dance. Knock Off is Ogerpon's strongest option to hit Tornadus-T, Moltres, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking. Additionally, Defiant leverages Landorus-T's Intimidate against it; however, its poor matchup versus Defog users such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Corviknight render it unable to effectively switch in on Defog attempts and activate Defiant.

Aside from this, its ability makes it great in the Water mirror matchup, since it is able to switch safely into Manaphy without fearing burn from Scald.

Knock Off grants Ogerpon-W some degree of utility, being able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Dragonite and Amoonguss to make them more vulnerable to entry hazards; it also hits Sinistcha and Brambleghast, which resist both of Ogerpon-W's STAB moves.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott and Empoleon make for good partners for Ogerpon-W, as the two of them are able to stack hazards to make Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking easier. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott is also able to outspeed and remove faster threats to Ogerpon-W like Chien-Pao and Dragapult, while Empoleon can bring it in safely with Flip Turn, wall Alolan Ninetales, and provide a neutrality to Freeze-Dry. In return, Hisuian Samurott appreciates Ogerpon-W breaking through Corviknight, while Empoleon benefits from the removal of Great Tusk. Pelipper makes for another great teammate for Ogerpon-W, setting up rain to strengthen Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel. Aside from rain, Pelipper can pivot into Ogerpon-W via U-turn and threaten Hisuian Lilligant and Amoonguss with Hurricane. Entry hazards from the likes of Gastrodon, Toxapex, and Quagsire can wear down incoming foes for Ogerpon-W to take advantage of. Quagsire can also remove setup sweepers that can outspeed and threaten Ogerpon-W out like Dragonite and Baxcalibur thanks to a combination of Unaware and Toxic, while Toxapex is able to serve as a wall against the likes of Chien-Pao and Meowscarada. As Ogerpon-W struggles with certain bulky Pokemon, such as Galarian Weezing and Zamazenta, it appreciates teammates that can either remove them or wear them down for Ogerpon-W to finish off, such as boosted Manaphy for the former and Basculegion-F under rain for the latter. Urshifu-R pairs well with Ogerpon-W, as it can break bulky Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon. Lastly, Toxapex and Amoonguss can stop any Ogerpon-W wallbreaking attempts; hence, Choice Specs users such as Walking Wake and Greninja make for great partners.</p>"

          "description": "<p>A complementary typing and a great Attack stat, especially when considering the 1.2x boost from its Wellspring Mask, give Ogerpon-W a niche as a powerful wallbreaker. Water- and Grass-type attacks hit most Pokemon for at least neutral damage, and after a Swords Dance boost, anything that doesn't resist its STAB combination is KOed. Even checks such as Baxcalibur and Tera Grass Heatran struggle to take a Swords Dance-bolstered Ivy Cudgel, and some of the stoutest walls, such as Toxapex, take heavy damage from a boosted Power Whip. Ivy Cudgel is its strongest Water-type STAB option and hits most Pokemon for neutral damage. Power Whip punishes common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Alomomola and is preferred to Wood Hammer despite the potential inaccuracy to avoid recoil. Horn Leech can also be used in order to supplement Ogerpon-W's longevity and let it come in more often. Trailblaze is another niche option, usually seen on Aurora Veil or dual screens hyper offense teams, boosting Ogerpon-W's Speed and allowing it to sweep. Play Rough notably hits Dragon-types that otherwise could resist Ogerpon-W's STAB combination such as Baxcalibur and Dragonite. Superpower is another great option, notably KOing Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance boost. Due to its great wallbreaking capability, setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Booster Energy Iron Valiant appreciate defensive cores being heavily weakened, allowing them to sweep. Water Absorb is a particularly useful ability prior to Terastallizing, as Ogerpon-W can find opportunities to set up on Pokemon such as Mega Swampert and Manaphy, as well as block Alomomola's Flip Turn. Ogerpon-W also appreciates entry hazards from Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T, as the chip helps it pressure defensive cores even further. Despite all this, bulky Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Kartana can check Ogerpon-W, so Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Medicham, and Zapdos are beneficial as teammates. Ogerpon-W is also threatened by faster attackers like Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny, so defensive pivots such as Landorus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Mega Scizor are also extremely useful. Despite being locked to Tera Water, this is actually very beneficial to Ogerpon-W, taking away its weaknesses to Flying- and Poison-type attacks and letting it stay in on threats such as Tornadus-T and Sneasler. In addition, Tera Water boosts its Ivy Cudgel to stupendous amounts, 2HKOing Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock and minimal chip at +2. The 1.5x Special Defense boost granted upon Terastallizing can also help mitigate attempts to revenge kill Ogerpon-W by foes like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p>"

Apart from this, its part Grass typing allows Ogerpon-H to match up well against various Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types such as Dondozo, Garganacl, and Great Tusk. With Hearthflame Mask, Ogerpon-H's Ivy Cudgel becomes a Fire-type move capable of 2HKOing Baxcalibur and Clodsire without a Swords Dance boost while also breaking through sturdy walls such as Hisuian Goodra, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Weezing after a Swords Dance boost. With Horn Leech, Ogerpon-H has access to some form of recovery especially against the Ground-types that most Fire-types tend to struggle against such as Ursaluna-B and Gastrodon. Play Rough allows Ogerpon-H to threaten the Dragon-types that take little from its STAB moves, OHKOing Kommo-o without a Swords Dance boost and OHKOing tanky Garchomp after a Swords Dance boost. On the other hand, Trailblaze allows Ogerpon-H to outspeed Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane after it is used once.</p> <p>Ninetales and Torkoal are key teammates for Ogerpon-H, as they set up sun to boost Ogerpon-H's damage from Ivy Cudgel to devastating levels. Notably, it is able to 2HKO Gliscor under sun without a Swords Dance boost. Torkoal is also able to set up Stealth Rock to weaken foes, putting them in OHKO range from Ogerpon-H's attacks. Ogerpon-H appreciates forms of entry hazard removal such as Cinderace's Court Change, Torkoal's Rapid Spin, and Talonflame's Defog. Court Change is notable, since it can possibly gain dual screens placed by foes such as Klefki and Alolan Ninetales, although it is best used when any hazards are not on the opponent's side of the field. Ogerpon-H struggles with certain walls such as Toxapex, so it appreciates Heatran being able to trap and eliminate it with Earth Power. In return, Ogerpon-H is able to threaten Ground-types Heatran struggles with such as Ting-Lu. Volcanion and Hisuian Arcanine make for great partners, as they are able to check various offensive Pokemon Ogerpon-H struggles with. Volcanion, with its immunity Water and its great bulk, checks the likes of Azumarill and Greninja, while Hisuian Arcanine is able to revenge kill sweepers like Dragonite and Baxcalibur. Lastly, Ogerpon-H's wallbreaking allows it to enable sweeps from Ceruledge and Volcarona, with the former appreciating Great Tusk's removal, while the latter appreciates Dondozo's removal.</p>"

Aside from this, its access to Mold Breaker allows it to bypass abilities such as Heatran's Flash Fire, Dondozo's Unaware, and Dragonite's Multiscale. With Hearthflame Mask, Ivy Cudgel turns into a powerful Fire-type move, and combined with its Speed, Ogerpon-H is able to beat the likes of Alolan Ninetales and Corviknight before a Swords Dance boost, as well as Hisuian Goodra after. Horn Leech grants Ogerpon-H some form of longevity. Play Rough allows Ogerpon-H to threaten the likes of Kommo-o, and after a Swords Dance Boost, it can 2HKO Dragonite. Alternatively, Trailblaze gives Ogerpon-H potential as a sweeper. After one Trailblaze, Ogerpon-H outspeeds the likes of Chien-Pao and Choice Specs Greninja. Lastly, with Zen Headbutt, Ogerpon-H can surprise would-be switch-ins such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Iron Moth.</p> <p>Entry hazard support from the likes of Brambleghast and Toedscruel is appreciated to wear down foes into OHKO range from Ogerpon-H. Notably, Ogerpon-H has a chance to OHKO Kingambit with one layer of Spikes. The two of them also have access to Rapid Spin, allowing them to remove hazards so that Ogerpon-H has more opportunities to switch in without getting worn down. Toedscruel can also take Fire-type attacks from Iron Moth and KO it back, while Brambleghast can switch into a predicted Flying-type move as well as revenge kill Flutter Mane with Shadow Sneak. Amoonguss is another great teammate, as its bulk and access to Spore allow it to either incapacitate or force out foes such as Dragonite. Choice Scarf Meowscarada outspeeds and removes potential threats to Ogerpon-H like Spectrier and faster Dragon-types, and it can bring Ogerpon-H in safely. Ogerpon-H's wallbreaking enables sweepers such as Hisuian Liligant and Torterra. In return, the two of them can handle foes Ogerpon-H struggles with, such as Landorus for the former and Toxapex for the latter. Rillaboom is a great revenge killer and wallbreaker to pair with Ogerpon-H, as with Grassy Glide, it can remove faster threats such as Flutter Mane and Hoopa-U. Aside from this, Rillaboom also provides Grassy Terrain to boost the power of Ogerpon-H's Grass-type moves. In return, Rillaboom appreciates Ogerpon-H removing foes Rillaboom struggles with such as Corviknight and Articuno. Breloom is another great teammate, as due to its Fighting typing and access to Mach Punch, it can easily deal with Kingambit. Lastly, Abomasnow has some niche as a teammate, as it can set up Aurora Veil to make Ogerpon-H and its teammates harder to KO.</p>"

Superpower allows Ogerpon-C to hit Ferrothorn, although this breaks Sturdy, along with Tera Steel foes like Iron Valiant. Ogerpon-C's main weakness lies in its reliance on Sturdy to set up against more powerful foes and its lack of immediate power before setting up. Thus, it is better off being saved as a cleaner for the later stages of a game. Entry hazard support, in particular Spikes, is highly valued to allow Ogerpon-C to KO many more threats; it can capitalize on hazard chip, for instance KOing even bulky foes like defensive Great Tusk unboosted once they are chipped. Thus, allies that can set hazards early-game like Hisuian Samurott and Garchomp are good partners. Ogerpon-C is also held back by its middling Speed tier, which leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed by Mega Lopunny, as it is capable of bypassing Sturdy, along with many other foes like Iron Valiant if Ogerpon-C has already lost Sturdy.

Superpower is a strong coverage move as it is able to deal with Steel- and Dark-types like Iron Treads, Hisuian Goodra, Urshifu-S, and Kingambit while being able to OHKO Snorlax at +2.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Glimmora, with its colorful moveset, deals with faster threats that outspeed Ogerpon-C like non-Choice-Scarf Greninja, Kommo-o, and Iron Valiant. In return, Ogerpon-C deals with Azumarill and Ursaluna-B for Glimmora. Air Balloon Glimmora can switch into threatening Ground-type moves while taking on foes like Great Tusk, clear entry hazards with Mortal Spin to make sure Ogerpon-C's Sturdy isn't broken, and sets its own hazards to enable Ogerpon-C's sweep. Tyranitar sets up sand to allow Ogerpon-C to set up easier due to the Special Defense boost, allowing Ogerpon-C to survive a Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Walking Wake. Tyranitar also acts as a specially defensive tank for Ogerpon-C and deals with Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Spectrier. Ogerpon-C aids Tyranitar by dealing with Landorus-T and non-Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott. Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine is a strong wallbreaker, using Head Smash and Flare Blitz to break through walls like Gholdengo and Corviknight. Hisuian Arcanine appreciates Ogerpon-C being able to deal with pesky Water- and Ground-types like Belly Drum Azumarill, Landorus, and Sandy Shocks. Coalossal is a decent physical wall that can remove hazards, which prevents Ogerpon-C's Sturdy from breaking, and deals with Chien-Pao, Kingambit, Scizor, and Corviknight. Coalossal also sets up Spikes to enhance Ogerpon-C's wallbreaking. Ogerpon-C takes care of Ursaluna-B and Manaphy for Coalossal. Iron Defense + Body Press Garganacl can act as a defensive stallbreaker, using Salt Cure to weaken impediments to Ogerpon-C sweeping, like Skeledirge, Dondozo, and Hisuian Goodra. Ogerpon-C shuts down Choice Band Mamoswine, which would otherwise destroy Garganacl. Lead Kleavor is another option that can set Stealth Rock with Stone Axe, potentially breaking a Focus Sash on Ceruledge, Breloom, and Ribombee that can hinder Ogerpon-C's sweeps otherwise. Assault Vest Diancie eases the Fighting and Dragon matchups by being able to take on non-Choice Band Urshifu-S, Iron Valiant, Baxcalibur, and Dragapult. Alolan Golem can trap and eliminate Steel-types such as Corviknight and Scizor for Ogerpon-C. In return Ogerpon-C destroys Ground-types like Quagsire and Ursaluna-B.</p>"

Power Whip is a more powerful Grass-type STAB move, while Horn Leech is more reliable and provides better longevity.

Raging Bolt’s good typing allows it to break through defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and bulky Water-types like Alomomola, Toxapex, and Rotom-W while also checking threats like Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Kartana. Thunderclap offsets Raging Bolt’s subpar Speed stat, allowing it to revenge kill offensive threats such as Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Lopunny as well as weakened setup sweepers like Iron Boulder, Volcarona, and Swords Dance Kartana, while Thunderbolt gives Raging Bolt a consistent damaging attack that doesn’t rely on prediction like Thunderclap and has significantly higher PP, allowing Raging Bolt to use its Electric-type moves in longer games. Substitute is an alternative to nullify passive Pokémon that can’t touch Raging Bolt such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos and give it more opportunities to set up, while Taunt can be used to deny setup from Garganacl and Mega Scizor but at the cost of a worse matchup against Galarian Slowking. Draco Meteor in tandem with Dragonium Z lets it break through Electric-immune Pokemon such as Gliscor, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu as well as other specially bulky Pokémon that can take on Raging Bolt such as Mega Tyranitar and Galarian Slowking. Alternatively, Leftovers is also an option on Substitute sets to passively heal the chip taken from Substitute and give Raging Bolt some form of recovery. Tera Flying grants Raging Bolt a Ground immunity while giving a Fighting resistance that helps against Great Tusk and Zamazenta while also avoiding any Ground-type coverage from Serperior. Tera Fairy gives this same Fighting resistance while giving Raging Bolt an immunity to Dragon-type moves from the likes of Garchomp and Gouging Fire. The EV spread allows Raging Bolt to live a Choice Scarf Landorus-T Earthquake from full HP and have a chance to OHKO Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock; the EVs also give a chance to OHKO Galarian Slowking with a boosted Devastating Drake as well as OHKO Iron Valiant with a boosted Thunderclap after Stealth Rock chip. Raging Bolt struggles against fast Ground- and Fairy-types like Garchomp, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Great Tusk, Tapu Koko, Iron Valiant, and especially Tapu Lele; Tapu Lele in particular can give Raging Bolt some trouble as well, as its Psychic Surge renders Thunderclap useless. Teammates like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, and Galarian Slowking help beat these checks. Since Raging Bolt has no reliable recovery, Alomomola is a good partner to pass huge HP wishes to it and pivot it in. Other pivots like Tornadus-T, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T also help bring Raging Bolt in safely. Teammates like Great Tusk and Zamazenta appreciate Raging Bolt taking care of Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos as well as bulky Waters like Rotom-W and Alomomola. In return, they help check Ferrothorn and Weavile. Great Tusk is another good partner, because it helps remove entry hazards, which harm Raging Bolt greatly, particularly Spikes.</p>"

It has access to a strong STAB move in Mighty Cleave that bypasses Protect, which can be useful against a weakened Gliscor. Close Combat has great coverage alongside Mighty Cleave and hits Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Garganacl, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Tyranitar for massive damage, being able to OHKO all of them at +2 Attack with Tera Fighting. Zen Headbutt hits Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Urshifu-R. Substitute allows Iron Boulder to scout for switches, as well as become immune to certain status moves like Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp. Iron Boulder can use Tera Flying to become immune to Earthquake that would otherwise OHKO it from Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Great Tusk. If your team has Tapu Koko to provide Electric Terrain, one option is to use Rockium Z over Booster Energy to power up Mighty Cleave to insane levels, OHKOing Gliscor and all but the bulkiest Landorus-T with Stealth Rock support after a Swords Dance. However, this option does make Iron Boulder dependent on Electric Terrain to retain its boosted Speed. Tapu Koko can also set up Reflect and Light Screen to help facilitate a sweep. Iron Boulder fits best on highly offensive teams, and functions as a late-game cleaner as well as a emergency check to speedy threats including Dragon Dance users like Gouging Fire and Booster Energy Iron Valiant. Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Mega Lopunny, and Urshifu-R benefit from having Iron Boulder on the team, as Iron Boulder can take advantage of and switch into Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T that such allies are weak to. Teammates such as Hawlucha, Kartana and Iron Valiant can appreciate Rockium Z Iron Boulder's massive damage onto Landorus-T and Gliscor. Non-Rockium Z Iron Boulder can struggle with Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Great Tusk. Because of this, having a switch-in like your own Landorus-T or Gliscor is very helpful. Additionally, Iron Boulder can be revenge killed by Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, so having answers to it like Volcarona and Gouging Fire is important. Iron Boulder appreciates hazard support from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Glimmora, as it can chip checks that would otherwise just fall short of a KO. Furthermore, physical wallbreakers such as Kartana and Mega Lopunny that can put Landorus-T and Gliscor in range of a +2 Mighty Cleave are also appreciated, especially since Gliscor can’t use Protect to heal with Poison Heal against Mighty Cleave, and Landorus-T doesn't have any reliable recovery. Finally, Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Volcarona that can break through foes like Alomomola, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mega Scizor are also greatly appreciated.</p>"

      "comments": "<h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Common Fairy-types such as Jumbao and Iron Valiant take a pittance from Arghonaut's attacks and can break through it easily with their STAB moves. Hatterene deserves a special mention, as it can bounce back Arghonaut's Spikes with Magic Bounce. However, Tera Fairy Arghonaut can wall most Iron Valiant sets and phazes it.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Venomicon, Toxapex, and Amoonguss wall Arghonaut with ease and threaten it out with Hurricane or Sludge Bomb. Venomicon-E and Plasmanta can both hit Arghonaut super effectively before and after Terastallizing thanks to their STAB combinations; the former can also absorb Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Great Tusk, Breloom, and Iron Moth are capable of 2HKOing Arghonaut even after it Terastallizes. Meowscarada and Krilowatt deal significant damage to Arghonaut before it Terastallizes, but Arghonaut has little to fear from them after Terastallizing. Furthermore, Krilowatt must be careful when switching in, since it is heavily crippled by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Miasmaw</strong>: Miasmaw ignores Unaware thanks to Neutralizing Gas, making it extremely difficult for Arghonaut to handle. After a Swords Dance, Miasmaw can easily 2HKO Arghonaut with Scale Shot or Gunk Shot and OHKO Tera Fairy Arghonaut with the latter move. However, Miasmaw dislikes being phazed due to its Stealth Rock weakness.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic from Pokemon such as Clodsire and Snaelstrom puts Arghonaut on a timer, greatly reducing its ability to stay in and wall powerful threats. On the other hand, burn from threats such as Astrolotl, Rotom-W, and Dragapult makes Arghonaut significantly more passive, reducing its ability to pressure resilient threats such as Gholdengo.</p>",

          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Great mixed bulk and Unaware make Arghonaut one of the metagame's most formidable walls, capable of taking on threats such as Gholdengo, Volcarona, Stratagem, and Kingambit. Additionally, Arghonaut's ability to force switches and strong matchup into Equilibra make it an excellent user of Spikes. Circle Throw phazes common setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Baxcalibur and whittles down the opposing team in conjunction with Spikes. Knock Off is Arghonaut's best way to force progress against walls such as Garganacl and Venomicon and deals heavy damage to Ghost-types trying to switch into Circle Throw such as Dragapult and Gholdengo. Leftovers provides Arghonaut with extra longevity and makes it less reliant on Recover, while Covert Cloak shields it from chip damage from Salt Cure and other bothersome secondary effects such as Special Defense drops from Shadow Ball. The given EVs allow Arghonaut to avoid the 2HKO from Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush and from Krilowatt's Tera Water Surf. Tera Fairy flips many of Arghonaut's bad matchups, letting it check a wide array of threats including Venomicon lacking Sludge Bomb, Krilowatt, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult.</p> <p>Arghonaut fits mostly on balance and stall teams that appreciate its ability to blanket check various offensive threats and force progress with Knock Off and Spikes. Stealth Rock setters such as Venomicon, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu are strong partners that can stack entry hazards with Arghonaut. Venomicon additionally handles threats to Arghonaut such as offensive Great Tusk, Meowscarada, and Iron Valiant, while Garganacl appreciates Arghonaut removing Covert Cloak from opposing Arghonaut and Gholdengo. Ground-types such as Equilibra, Great Tusk, and Garchomp can deal with Electric- and Poison-types such as Iron Hands and Toxapex, while in return Arghonaut can switch into Greninja lacking Grass Knot. Skeledirge forms a formidable Unaware core with Arghonaut, taking on Jumbao, Venomicon, and Iron Valiant while Arghonaut covers it against threats like Snaelstrom, Garganacl, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Bulky setup sweepers such as Naviathan, Ceruledge, and Hatterene take advantage of Arghonaut whittling down their checks with Spikes and Knock Off over the course of the game.</p>"

While Cinderace has to be more wary of repeated hits, it can switch into Jumbao at least once with relative impunity and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Amoonguss switches into Jumbao relatively well and can use Spore as it is forced out but must watch out for Tera Blast Fire.

Tera Blast Fire pressures the Steel- and Poison-types that resist Jumbao's STAB combination, such as Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Venomicon. Alternatively, if Jumbao is paired with teammates that rely on Terastallizing, Focus Blast can be used to retain the OHKO on Kingambit. Synthesis lets Jumbao continuously keep sun up with Heat Rock and outlast Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Roaring Moon. Tera Fire allows Jumbao to take advantage of Tera Blast Fire's coverage and improves its matchup against Steel-types such as Scizor and Gholdengo by removing its Steel weakness.</p> <p>Jumbao can fit comfortably on a variety of playstyles from bulky offense to balance thanks to the team support it provides through Drought. Fire-types such as Skeledirge, Cinderace, Ceruledge, and Iron Moth and Protosynthesis users such as Roaring Moon, Sandy Shocks, and Great Tusk are Jumbao's best offensive partners, as they all become extremely dangerous under sun. Since Jumbao is incredibly vulnerable to opposing Fire-types, defensive Pokemon that can handle them, such as Toxapex, Arghonaut, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, are excellent partners. The latter three can also set entry hazards to help Jumbao wallbreak, while Toxapex can handle opposing Jumbao and Glimmora. Toxapex and Hatterene can create momentum for sun teams with Eject Button, the latter of which also keeps entry hazards off the field for Fire-type teammates. Bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight and Equilibra can check Poison-types that Jumbao struggles to break such as Amoonguss and Venomicon and appreciate Jumbao handling their checks, such as Krilowatt and Great Tusk.</p>"

          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Jumbao picks off normally faster threats such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Krilowatt and supports offensive teammates with Healing Wish. Drought allows Jumbao to use Solar Beam quicker and provide sun support for teammates such as Great Tusk and Cinderace. Trace, on the other hand, allows Jumbao to copy valuable abilities such as Toxapex's Regenerator and Venomicon-E's Tinted Lens; however, it requires Jumbao to run Leaf Storm to retain a powerful Grass-type STAB move because of Solar Beam's two-turn wait outside of sun. Tera Fire with Tera Blast grants Jumbao coverage to hit Steel-types such as Corviknight and Gholdengo and resistances to key attacks such as Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Iron Valiant's Moonblast, and Baxcalibur's Ice Shard. Focus Blast, on the other hand, lets Jumbao OHKO Kingambit without Terastallizing.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Jumbao is a strong asset to bulky offense teams, providing them with speed control and incredibly useful Healing Wish support. Defensive pivots that lack reliable recovery, such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Equilibra, and Rotom-W, benefit immensely from Jumbao's ability to bring them back to full health late in the game, which gives them the freedom to take more hits early on. These Pokemon can also handle the Steel- and Fire-types that can take Jumbao's STAB attacks, such as Cinderace, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth. Pivots like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Cinderace can bring Jumbao in safely against Pokemon it threatens, such as Krilowatt and Hydreigon. Bulky setup sweepers such as Hatterene and Kingambit can break down teams for Jumbao to clean late-game and greatly appreciate Jumbao giving them a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish. Poison-types such as Toxapex, Venomicon, and Clodsire wall Jumbao, so wallbreakers that can threaten them, such as Dragapult, Baxcalibur, and Smokomodo, are good teammates. Lastly, if Jumbao opts to use Drought, it can set sun to support Fire-types such as Skeledirge and Iron Moth and Protosynthesis users such as Great Tusk and Roaring Moon.</p>"

Double-Edge with Galvanize can break through even the tier's most stalwart walls, 2HKOing Pokemon like Skeledirge and Garganacl with ease, especially once Caribolt Terastallizes. Horn Leech provides some modicum of recovery to compensate for Double-Edge's recoil. Rapid Spin both increases Caribolt's Speed, giving it sweeping potential, and supports teammates weak to Stealth Rock like Baxcalibur and Iron Moth, allowing them to forego Heavy-Duty Boots. Leftovers helps make up for Double-Edge's recoil alongside Horn Leech, while Magnet powers up Caribolt's Electric-type attacks even further. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Choice Scarf Jumbao at +1 Speed and Krilowatt at +0, but Adamant is an option to deal as much damage as possible, supporting its hyper offense teammates. Tera Grass is an option to turn Ground-types like Equilibra and Great Tusk into setup fodder, but Caribolt's main focus should be on wallbreaking as much as possible for its teammates.</p> <p>Caribolt is best utilized on hyper offense teams, which appreciate its incredible wallbreaking ability. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Iron Moth, Baxcalibur, and Venomicon-E appreciate Caribolt removing the hazard, allowing Iron Moth and Baxcalibur to run more offensive items over Heavy-Duty Boots. Other physical sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and Dragonite love Caribolt powering through Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Arghonaut; Roaring Moon pairs particularly well with Caribolt, as it can threaten the Grass-types like Jumbao and Amoonguss that give Caribolt trouble with Tera Flying + Acrobatics. This love is shared by special sweepers like Iron Valiant and Hatterene, which need Skeledirge off the table before attempting a sweep. Caribolt appreciates entry hazards weakening physically bulky Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu—which can beat Caribolt if it Terastallizes—into KO range of its attacks, so pairing it with a dedicated lead like Greninja or Meowscarada is suggested.</p>"

Levitate is the recommended ability, as it drastically improves Equilibra's matchups against opposing Ground-types, such as Clodsire and Garchomp, while also presenting more opportunities to clear entry hazards without worrying about taking Spikes damage. Alternatively, Bulletproof blocks Focus Blast from Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Jumbao and Shadow Ball from Ghost-types such as Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark. Protect allows Equilibra to scout the foe's moves and get additional healing from Leftovers, while Pain Split gives it an alternative form of recovery, lowering its reliance on Leftovers. Alternatively, Aura Sphere allows Equilibra to beat opposing Levitate Equilibra and improves its matchup against Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Colossoil. The given EV spread allows Equilibra to avoid an OHKO from Choice Specs Greninja's Hydro Pump, survive the combination of Moonblast into Close Combat from mixed Tera Fairy Iron Valiant, and outspeed Adamant Breloom after getting a Speed boost from Rapid Spin. Tera Water allows Equilibra to tank Fire-type attacks from Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Astrolotl, and Skeledirge.

Venomicon is one of the best defensive partners for Equilibra, since it walls many of the Fighting- and Ground-types that Equilibra struggles against such as Great Tusk; in return, Equilibra deals with Pokemon that Venomicon struggles against, such as Stratagem and Hatterene. Equilibra relies heavily on Leftovers for recovery, so it appreciates support from teammates that don't mind taking Knock Off, like Corviknight and Toxapex.
