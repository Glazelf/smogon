Offensive threats such as Zacian-C and Poison Heal users such as Arceus-Fairy appreciate the information Imposter Chansey provides through scouting, with Poison Heal users also acting as Knock Off absorbers. Imposter Chansey appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon like Dondozo and RegenVest Ting-Lu for safe scouting; these Pokemon can also provide Knock Off support, aiding against Judgment users like Miraidon that can otherwise defeat Imposter Chansey. Tera Normal gives Chansey a STAB boost on Judgment, improving its matchup into Pokemon like Miraidon, while Tera Fire and Tera Ghost are useful against Zacian-C and trapping moves, respectively.</p> "

Will-O-Wisp + Hex spreads chip damage, neuters physical attackers, and gives Skeledirge the most firepower; Roar + Shadow Ball is a more consistent alternative that deters setup and racks up entry hazard chip. Teammates that can reliably set entry hazards long-term such as Fur Coat or Regenerator Garchomp and Regenerator Ting-Lu are great partners, as they greatly appreciate Skeledirge's ability to deter hazard-removing attempts. Pokemon that check the likes of Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle such as Ice Scales Corviknight and specially defensive Desolate Land Volcarona make for great defensive partners alongside Skeledirge. Strong wallbreakers such as Great Tusk, Iron Bundle, Iron Valiant, and Flutter Mane appreciate Skeledirge’s ability to keep entry hazards up by preventing Corviknight's Defog—and potentially risk a spinblock against Great Tusk and Iron Treads—allowing them to further pressure the opposing team. 12 Speed EVs let Skeledirge outspeed and either damage or burn Corviknight.</p> "
