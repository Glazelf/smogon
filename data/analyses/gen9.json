Against either option, Encore can turn Dragonite practically invincible allowing it to reside on the field indefinitely in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fire Spin allows Dragonite to defeat almost any Pokemon universally by simply making full use of its longevity. Trapping an Encore locked Pokemon in the field is also highly valuable. Fire Spin is used instead of Wrap because it affects Ghost-types and doesn't trigger chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Encore is most effective against slower foes. Thunder Wave allows Dragonite to lock a much wider variety of Pokemon into their moves, while also giving it more opportunities to keep Multiscale up via potential paralysis.</p> </li> <li> <p>Substitute adds to Dragonite's longevity. Baiting a status move such as Toxic or Yawn, blocking it with Substitute, and locking the move in with Encore guarantees Dragonite an active Substitute while defeating the opposing Pokemon. Most notably, managing to leave a Substitute against Garganacl's Salt Cure or Corviknight's U-turn gains a lot of momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p>Draco Meteor is a powerful move that can catch opposing Dragon-types off- guard and snatch a surprise KO. This Dragonite set has more than enough capability to run the timer out, so guaranteeing the number advantage is significant. It is also a significantly better offensive option against opposing Dragonite, which can avoid Encore via the use of Extreme Speed, raise its own Speed with Dragon Dance, and ignore Thunder Wave with the common Lum Berry.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Fairy</strong>: Due to Dragonite’'s low Speed compared to other Dragon-types, it has a difficult time without a Fairy Tera type.</li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid: In order to make the most use of Encore, max Speed is recommended.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Bold</strong>: A more defensive spread lets Dragonite preserve Terastallization against certain physical attackers, which makes it a noteworthy choice. In particular, max Defense Dragonite can use Roost to mitigate the damage from Choice Band Meowscarada without needing to Terastallize, and Substitute can survive Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers Generally, Leftovers preserves Dragonite’'s longevity best, as it cancels out the damage from Sandstorm and makes timer stall easier.

Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred to avoid entry hazard chip damage from repeated switch-ins, but Leftovers provides passive recovery. Physically defensive teammates like Fur Coat Avalugg and Flogres help cover the physical attackers that threaten Blissey, like Aerilate Dragonite and Dragon Rush Dragapult. Slow but powerful wallbreakers such as Slither Wing and Ceruledge appreciate Blissey paralyzing offensive foes, giving them more chances to wallbreak.</p> "

Fur Coat makes Garchomp it significantly better at handling targets such as Aerilate Dragonite and Adaptability Kingambit; however, Regenerator provides far better longevity, letting Garchomp set entry hazards multiple times. Due to Garchomp mainly being an entry hazard setter, it greatly appreciates teammates such as Good as Gold Skeledirge to keep the entry hazards up in the face of Defog and Rapid Spin. Garchomp also works well with offensive threats such as Sheer Force Iron Valiant, as the entry hazards can wear down Iron Valiant's checks into KO range. Garchomp struggles to check common attackers like Dragapult and Iron Valiant, so secondary checks like physically defensive Clodsire are appreciated.</p> "

Tera Water lets it survive a Fire-type attack without giving it too many weaknesses. Tera Flying allows it to pair with an Earthquake user and continue to provide support.

          "description": "<p>Possessing OU's highest unboosted Speed tier makes Choice Specs Dragapult a very remarkable special wallbreaker, revenge killer, and offensive pivot. It outspeeds and threatens common offensive threats like Cinderace, Iron Moth, and even boosted foes like Choice Scarf Rotom-W and Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. Moreover, it's immune or resistant to common priority attacks like the aforementioned Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Breloom's Mach Punch, and Slither Wing's First Impression, which makes it much harder to revenge kill. A coverage move in either Flamethrower or Thunder lets Dragapult nail Corviknight, with the former also hitting other Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads, while the latter pressures Toxapex and Tera Water Garganacl. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to bypass Grimmsnarl's dual screens, Orthworm's Shed Tail, and Substitute users like Gholdengo, which gives it an edge against hyper offense teams. Tera Ghost maintains an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and strengthens Shadow Ball—its most spammable attack—notably guaranteeing the 2HKO on Corviknight and Assault Vest Iron Treads after Terastallizing. Tera Fairy prevents Dragapult from being picked off by opposing Dragapult and Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Meowscarada. Finally, Tera Dragon turns Draco Meteor into an even more powerful nuke. This takes advantage of the lack of prominent bulky Steel- and Fairy-types in the metagame, notably chunking answers to Ghost-types like Purifying Salt Garganacl and Ting-Lu and 2HKOing Unaware Clodsire.</p> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult fits perfectly on bulky offense and VoltTurn teams. Physical wallbreakers like Chien-Pao and Great Tusk appreciate Dragapult's U-turn bringing them in safely, and they are able to pressure its switch-ins like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Garganacl. Entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Great Tusk allow Dragapult to pivot throughout the game unperturbed; the former can also pivot it in safely via U-turn, letting it threaten Gholdengo, which tends to switch into Corviknight to block its Defog. Furthermore, Corviknight and Great Tusk provide the necessary defensive backbone to switch into boosted threats such as Roaring Moon, as well as revenge kill attempts from Sucker Punch users like Kingambit and Chien-Pao. Gholdengo forms a Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can overwhelm a shared check in Ting-Lu, use non-Calm Mind Blissey as setup fodder, and either cripple Tera Water Garganacl with Trick or straight up dent Tera Fairy variants. Entry hazards from Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Garganacl can quickly put foes into Dragapult's KO range, especially as it tends to force a lot of switches; in return, Dragapult spinblocks foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch. Setup sweepers like Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Swords Dance Chien-Pao appreciate Dragapult wallbreaking early-game for them to clean up late-game easily.</p> "

        {
          "name": "Choice Band",
          "description": "<p>Choice Band Dragapult utilizes its near-unresisted STAB moves, its blistering Speed stat, and its excellent Attack stat to function as a strong physical wallbreaker. The choice for the second move depends on what Tera type Dragapult chooses. Tera Dragon Dragapult uses Phantom Force for a Ghost-type STAB move, but Tera Ghost uses Tera Blast, since, unlike Phantom Force, it is not a two-turn move. Sucker Punch allows Dragapult to revenge kill weakened sweepers such as opposing Dragapult, as well as Iron Moth and Tera Flying Roaring Moon after some chip damage. However, be careful when using Sucker Punch, since opponents can predict it and set up. An Adamant nature gives Dragapult extra wallbreaking power, at the cost of being outsped by threats like Chien-Pao. Alternatively, a Jolly nature allows Dragapult to outspeed the entirety of the unboosted metagame. With Tera Dragon, Dragapult's Dragon Darts becomes harder to switch into; it 2HKOes walls Dragapult normally struggles with such as Ting-Lu. Tera Dragon Dragapult is also less susceptible to Sucker Punch, albeit at the cost of losing its immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is a fantastic partner, since it's able to check Dark-types such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Hazard removal from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for good partners, since Dragapult's lack of longevity makes it difficult to switch in when hazards are up. Great Tusk and Corviknight are able to beat both Scizor and opposing Great Tusk, while Cinderace can threaten bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight. Dragapult benefits from entry hazards from the likes of Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, since it can more effectively wallbreak with entry hazards up. Other pivots such as Scizor and Rotom-W appreciate that Dragapult's U-turn can bring them in. In return, Scizor can revenge kill Ice-types such as Chien-Pao, while Rotom-W can check both Corviknight and defensive Great Tusk. Paralysis support from Rotom-W can shutdown offensive Pokemon like opposing Dragapult and Roaring Moon. Lastly, Gholdengo makes for a good teammate, since it can spinblock and deny Defog and can help Dragapult overwhelm shared checks like Kingambit and Ting-Lu.</p> "

        {
          "name": "Utility",
          "description": "<p>Unlike its more offensively oriented Choice item sets, this Dragapult set goes for a more multifunctional approach. Dragapult's unmatched Speed tier, in conjunction with STAB Dragon Darts, allows it to snipe key offensive threats such as Roaring Moon, Iron Moth, and Cinderace with some prior chip damage. This often means that Dragapult will force a lot of switches which can be capitalized on with Will-O-Wisp to spread status and power up Hex. Will-O-Wisp also allows Dragapult to avoid Sucker Punch, which can come in handy against Cinderace, Kingambit, and Meowscarada. With a burn and Stealth Rock up, Hex 2HKOs Defensive Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Dondozo, allowing Dragapult to pick apart balanced cores. Finally, U-Turn rounds out the set, letting Dragapult keep momentum up even against hard counters like Ting-Lu and Garganacl. 252 Speed EVs with a Hasty nature ensure that Dragapult outspeeds the entire unboosted tier. 76 Attack EVs ensure an OHKO on Roaring Moon with Dragon Darts, while the rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack. Although Dragapult does not typically find itself needing to Terastallize very often, Ghost is most commonly used to power up Hex even further. For example, Tera Ghost Hex does a minimum of 84% to a burnt Defensive Great Tusk. In a pinch however, Terastallization can be used defensively to avoid OHKOs like from Chien-Pao's Ice Shard.</p> <p>Because of the amount of utility it provides, Dragapult appreciates plentiful chip damage from its teammates, as it lacks immediate power. All forms of entry hazards are greatly appreciated due to Dragapult's ability to force out the opponent, so entry hazard setters like Garganacl, Great Tusk, Glimmora and Ting-Lu form good teammates. Stealth Rock is particularly important since it secures important 2HKOs with Hex. Among the entry hazard setters, Garganacl has fantastic synergy with Dragapult, as it is able to set up Stealth Rock while also chipping down foes with Salt Cure. Partners that can spread status such as Rotom-W and Skeledirge are also excellent teammates. Since Ting-Lu and Garganacl stonewall this set, teammates that scare them out such as Offensive Great Tusk and Banded Meowscarada are great partners. Tera Flying Covert Cloak Gholdengo forms a particularly potent Ghost spam core with Dragapult, as it can turn common counters to Dragapult such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Garganacl into setup fodder. Physical sweepers like Chien-Pao and Kingambit appreciate having their counters like Corviknight and Great Tusk crippled with burns and have solid type synergy with Dragapult. Due to this set being most potent in the mid- to late-game, it's more at home in teams with solid defensive backbones that can sponge hits. Defensive pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Hatterene, Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Amoonguss can all soak damage for Dragapult from common checks like Garganacl, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit while setting up entry hazards, spreading status, or dealing chip damage, allowing Dragapult to clean up later in the game.</p> "

          "description": "<p>The combination of Iron Defense + Body Press lets Garganacl serve as a bulky and dangerous setup sweeper, allowing it to beat Pokemon it otherwise loses to, such as Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit. Salt Cure wears down common switch-ins such as Great Tusk, Gholdengo, Rotom-W, and Hatterene, as well as passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Corviknight, and forces them to burn recovery PP more often. Recover keeps Garganacl healthy throughout a game to check Pokemon like Ceruledge and Iron Moth and makes it more sustainable as a wincon. Purifying Salt prevents it from being crippled by Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Clodsire. It also provides a handy Ghost resistance, letting Garganacl potentially switch in on predicted Ghost-type moves from Pokemon like Dragapult and Skeledirge. Leftovers provides valuable passive recovery, reducing Garganacl's reliance on Recover. Maximum Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature maximize Garganacl's bulk, making it easier for Garganacl to switch in on Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Dragapult and use them as setup fodder. Tera Water provides incredibly valuable resistances, letting Garganacl potentially check Gholdengo and Scizor while retaining its ability to pivot in on Fire-types like Cinderace. Tera Fairy allows Garganacl to turn the tables on Great Tusk and Sacred Sword Chien-Pao while also preventing Breloom from revenge killing it. However, this does remove its resistance to Fire, making it more susceptible to Pokemon like Skeledirge and Ceruledge. Tera Ghost prevents Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk from reliably revenge killing Garganacl, letting it use them as setup fodder. It does negate the Ghost resistance provided by Purifying Salt, however, so another switch-in to Dragapult's Shadow Ball should be used.</p> <p>Checks to strong wallbreakers like Iron Valiant, Breloom, and Chien-Pao are good teammates; examples include the likes of Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. While Garganacl is given a Ghost resistance from Purifying Salt, it cannot fully check Dragapult and Gholdengo prior to Terastallization, with the latter completely countering it if it uses Covert Cloak. As such, Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire make for great teammates. Pokemon like Corviknight and Scizor appreciate Garganacl checking Fire-types like Ceruledge and Skeledirge. Corviknight is notable in that it also forms a strong defensive core with Garganacl, checking Meowscarada for it. Entry hazard removers like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Corviknight are appreciated, as Garganacl is heavily pressured by entry hazards and cannot set up reliably if it is worn down. Frail, offensive Pokemon like Cinderace and Chien-Pao appreciate chip damage being forced onto their checks and having a strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on. Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Iron Valiant can pave the way for Garganacl to clean late-game, wearing down or significantly pressuring its checks in Gholdengo, Meowscarada, and Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Great Tusk.</p> "

Heavy-Duty Boots, notably eases Dondozo's pivoting, while Rocky Helmet punishes contact moves such as U-turn and V-create. Covert Cloak protects against secondary effects like confusion from Zacian-C's Magical Torque and burns from Scald. Tera Fire allows Dondozo to resist Magical Torque and Grass-type moves from Zacian-C, and it maintains Dondozo's resistance to Fire-type moves such as V-create.

After using Swords Dance, Kingambit threatens the entire tier, including incredibly bulky physical walls such as Fur Coat Corviknight and Hippowdon. Sucker Punch picks off faster threats, such as Iron Bundle and Dragapult, making it difficult to check offensively. Life Orb provides the highest damage boost to Kingambit's attacks, notably ensuring a 2HKO on Fur Coat Corviknight; alternatively, Black Glasses provides a damage boost without digging into Kingambit's limited healthpool, while Leftovers allows Kingambit to reliably switch in on weaker attacks. Kingambit best fits on offense teams, which appreciate its massive damage output and can provide opportunities for it to switch in safely. Slow pivoting teammates, such as RegenVest Iron Treads and Ice Scales Corviknight, are recommended, as they can safely pivot Kingambit in and also clear entry hazards. 144 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Corviknight. Kingambit is incredibly threatened by Great Tusk and Iron Hands, as both can easily live even boosted hits and threaten to OHKO back, so teammates like Florges and Iron Valiant are appreciated.</p> "

It can adequately check Pokemon like Kingambit, Cinderace, and Iron Hands, threatening them with a strong Earthquake in return. Stealth Rock lets Great Tusk compress even more roles, chipping away at the opposition. If another Stealth Rock user is already on the team, however, Body Press can take advantage of its high Defense stat and better threaten the likes of Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon. Body Press also lets Great Tusk catch Rotom-W with greater chip damage than Knock Off does on the switch. Knock Off provides valuable item removal, getting rid of Leftovers from Pokemon like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Volcarona and Dragonite. Additionally, Knock Off is Great Tusk's only initial way to hit Air Balloon Gholdengo, which can't OHKO this defensive set. Rapid Spin, besides clearing entry hazards, also allows Great Tusk to outspeed faster foes like Focus Sash Glimmora and Gholdengo. Tera Fighting gets rid of Great Tusk's Ground typing, giving it a better matchup against Pokemon like Chien-Pao while also strengthening Body Press if it is used. Alternatively, Tera Steel can give Great Tusk valuable resistances to Fairy, Grass, and Ice, turning the tables on Hatterene and Chien-Pao. Leftovers greatly increases Great Tusk's longevity; however, Rocky Helmet can be used to wear down Pokemon like Scizor and Cinderace over time.</p> <p>After Great Tusk sets Stealth Rock, Corviknight effortlessly switches in and uses Defog to remove entry hazards, so Pokemon like Cinderace, Gholdengo, and Rotom-W that handle it are great partners. With no good way to hit Flying-types and Pokemon that use Tera Flying, Great Tusk can be set up on very quickly, most notably against the likes of Dragonite and Roaring Moon;even though the former dislikes Knock Off. Therefore, checks to these such as Dondozo and Corviknight are appreciated. A different Stealth Rock setter like Garganacl or Ting-Lu lets Great Tusk comfortably run Body Press without losing out on anything major. Ting-Lu also forms a potent entry hazard-stacking core with Great Tusk via Spikes. Further, it takes on the special attackers that Great Tusk struggles with, like Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Volcarona. Great Tusk is forced out by wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Quaquaval, so teammates that can check them like Amoonguss and Toxapex are welcome. Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Ceruledge, and Iron Moth appreciate the entry hazard removal that Great Tusk provides. Great Tusk's defensive qualities greatly help frail wallbreakers like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao, as these Pokemon need strong defensive Pokemon to fall back on very often.</p> "

Slither Wing loves being partnered with bulky pivots such as Chilly Reception Slowking, Corviknight, and Desolate Land Volcarona to get it in safely against the opposing team and start punching holes in defensive cores.

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Miraidon is a fierce wallbreaker that can reliably threaten nearly the entire tier with its lethal offensive typing. Volt Switch helps maintain momentum and can scout opposing Terastallization. Trick ruins Ice Scales users like Hisuian Goodra and Arceus-Grass lacking a held Plate, and Steam Eruption threatens burns and targets Ground-types like Ting-Lu and Clodsire; Grass Knot hits many of the same targets but makes Miraidon easier to Imposter-proof. Miraidon's massive damage potential and ability to break down defensive cores makes it an excellent fit on offense. Palkia-O and Final Gambit Eternatus make good partners, as they can help remove Ground-types and weaken special walls with Dragon Energy. Terastallizing into one of its original types is useful to supercharge Miraidon's damage output; however, Tera Steel can be useful to get a surprise KO on Zacian-C, and Tera Fairy is useful for blanking an Imposter user's Dragon Energy. Imposter-proofing is generally done with a specially defensive Ground-type teammate like Ting-Lu or Groudon.</p> "

Nasty Plot provides higher immediate power, whereas Quiver Dance makes setting up easier, enables the use of a Modest nature, and allows Miraidon to outspeed and threaten Zacian-C. Draco Plate + Judgment is used so Miraidon can fully self Imposter-proof, in addition to being usable at low HP, unlike Dragon Energy. Miraidon's best fit is on bulky teams that appreciate its instant damage output, potential to sweep, on top of its innate self-Imposter-proofing and good matchup into common Prankster users. Teammates that can help destroy Ice Scales users, such as Final Gambit Eternatus and Pixilate Enamorus are appreciated. Miraidon should be careful when Terastallizing, as this removes its 4x Electric-type resistance and makes it more vulnerable to being PP stalled by Imposter; however, Tera Electric or Tera Dragon are useful for damage output, and Nasty Plot sets enjoy having Tera Steel for Zacian-C.</p> "
