It also has a solid offensive presence due to its very high Special Attack, which lets it 3HKO Pokemon like Keldeo and Iron Hands. Sludge Bomb hits the plethora of Grass- and Fairy-types, most notably Tangrowth, Tapu Fini, Clefable, and Mega Altaria. Earth Power provides coverage against Steel-types like Aegislash and Excadrill, and it can also be useful to hit targets like Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Mega Tyranitar. Knock Off can cripple switch-ins like Latios and Chansey, and Giga Drain hits Water- and Ground-types, threatening the likes of Slowbro, Hippowdon, and specially defensive Gastrodon. Leech Seed lets Mega Venusaur passively heal from Pokemon like Blissey. Synthesis can keep Mega Venusaur healthy in the face of entry hazards and heal in front of targets like Tangrowth that can't damage it heavily. This given EV spread allows Mega Venusaur to outspeed Choice Band Tyranitar. Mega Venusaur, even with its ability, can have a hard time dealing with most Fire-types like Victini and Iron Moth that can potentially overwhelm it with their boosted attacks, so it appreciate defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex. Mega Venusaur also has a hard time dealing with special attackers like Alakazam and Choice Specs Hydreigon, making specially defensive teammates like Celesteela and Chansey good teammates. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Mew, and Excadrill can appreciate having Mega Venusaur as a teammate, as it can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Iron Moth. Mega Venusaur is very susceptible to being chipped by entry hazards so it appreciate entry hazard removal options like Excadrill, Salamence, and Tapu Fini. It is also chipped by sand and burns, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Tyranitar and Hippowdon, such as Excadrill, Keldeo, and Hisuian Lilligant, as well as Pokemon immune to burn like Victini and Iron Moth make good partners.</p>"

The Speed EVs allow Mega Venusaur to outpace Adamant Azumarill. Mega Venusaur's teammates greatly appreciate its ability to handle threats like Mega Diancie and Mega Scizor and clear Toxic Spikes. Ferrothorn and Cradily form a solid defensive core, absorbing hits from Flying- and Psychic-types such as Galarian Moltres and Tapu Lele, while Mega Venusaur tanks Fire-, Ice-, and Fighting-type attacks. Whimsicott and Tapu Bulu help with the Dragon matchup, and Celebi handles the problematic Poison-types like Toxapex and Nidoking. Rillaboom and Breloom provide strong priority, allowing them to threaten faster threats such as Nihilego.

Sludge Bomb allows Mega Venusaur to threaten Fairy-types like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. Earth Power is required to hit Heatran and also to prevent the likes of Gholdengo, Sneasler, and Kartana from taking advantage of Mega Venusaur’s STAB options. Giga Drain hits most foes that resist its coverage moves like Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Great Tusk for neutral damage. It also gives more healing opportunities, since Synthesis has low PP. The given EVs allow Mega Venusaur to outspeed Landorus-T and Moltres, potentially KOing them with a crucial Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb, respectively. Mega Venusaur pairs well with teammates with a strong offensive presence, since they can fall back on its defensive capabilities to break throughout the course of a game. Specifically, since Mega Venusaur is unfazed by Knock Off and status conditions, it can reliably check Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Kartana can utilize its defensive capabilities and ability to switch into their checks to wallbreak more consistently. However, Mega Venusaur is very vulnerable to entry hazards, so allies that can remove them like Rotom-W and Great Tusk make great partners. Mega Venusaur is also easily checked by the likes of Zapdos and Tapu Lele, which can threaten it with powerful STAB moves, and Skarmory, which ignores damage from its moves. Some good teammates that can cover and check these include Gliscor, Heatran, and Gholdengo; in exchange, Mega Venusaur can check opponents like Rotom-W and Landorus-T. Finally, since Synthesis heals less in rain, Mega Venusaur has reduced longevity against this archetype despite its resistance to Water, so it will need additional support from teammates like Gastrodon and Rotom-W to cover this.</p>"

While U-turn can grab momentum against foes such as Latios and Mega Latias, and Poison Jab has some utility in targeting Fairy-types like Clefable, Bug and Poison is an atrocious STAB combination that has no way to break through common defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Buzzwole, and it notably struggles to even touch Steel-types. Skarmory and Celesteela stonewall Mega Beedrill, and while other Steel-types dislike Drill Run and Knock Off, virtually every Steel-type, from Bisharp to Excadrill, can usually beat Mega Beedrill one-on-one.

Mega Beedrill's paltry defensive stats and terrible typing give it practically no defensive utility, rendering it extremely vulnerable to Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Zapdos and priority moves like Scizor's Bullet Punch and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Pursuit is another seemingly useful option, with its ability to outpace the likes of Choice Specs Latios and Mega Latias working well in tandem with Mega Beedrill's ability to hit them super effectively. However, Mega Beedrill is outclassed as a Pursuit trapper by Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Tyranitar, both of which have a much better offensive and defensive presence thanks to their better typings. For teammates, entry hazard removers like Excadrill and Tapu Fini are mandatory. Special attackers that can remove or chip physical walls, such as Iron Moth and Thundurus-T, are necessary to let Mega Beedrill have any hope of threatening the opposing team. Magnezone is notable for its ability to trap and remove Skarmory and Celesteela. Entry hazards from setters like Ting-Lu and Skarmory can chip Mega Beedrill's targets and help it actually KO its targets.

Paralysis spam through Nuzzle and Glare ensures Pikachu always outspeeds opposing threats like Mega Mewtwo X, and it can also generate free turns. Knock Off invalidates Pikachu, so Knock Off absorbers, such as Arceus with a held Plate are recommended.

Moreover, Alolan Ninetales handles the Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and Great Tusk that Alolan Sandslash is extremely weak to. With a Nasty Plot + Encore set, Alolan Ninetales can also take advantage of and remove Dondozo, Toxapex, Calm Mind Clefable, and Iron Defense Corviknight. Baxcalibur makes an excellent pairing with Alolan Sandslash, greatly appreciating Alolan Sandslash eliminating targets such as Flutter Mane and Alolan Ninetales and removing entry hazards to allow it to sweep unimpeded. Choice Band Chien-Pao is another teammate that appreciates Alolan Sandslash pressuring Fairy-types, clearing entry hazards, and generally softening up the opposing team so it can avoid being chipped down over the course of a game and easily clean. In exchange, Chien-Pao can threaten Corviknight and Kingambit. Froslass absorbs Fighting-type moves for Alolan Sandslash and enjoys it removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and Empoleon via Knock Off, rendering them vulnerable to Froslass’s Spikes. Smack Down Mamoswine similarly appreciates Alolan Sandslash’s Knock Off with regard to its Stealth Rock and can take out Corviknight, which otherwise walls Alolan Sandslash. Frosmoth values Alolan Sandslash bringing down Articuno and Flutter Mane, while in return threatening the pesky Quagsire, Great Tusk, and Ursaluna-B. Cetitan and Cloyster are other examples of Ice-type sweepers that massively benefit from Alolan Sandslash clearing entry hazards prior to their setup.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Clefable’s excellent utility, movepool, and defensive typing allow it to function as a powerful defensive piece. Its excellent pure Fairy typing creates favorable matchups versus Pokemon such as Latios, Buzzwole, and Iron Hands. Clefable acts as a Toxic immunity thanks to Magic Guard and also possesses a permanent immunity to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and sandstorm. On offensive teams, Clefable usually fills the role of hazard setter through Stealth Rock. It can use Knock Off to limit the longevity of potential switch-ins such as Celesteela, Amoonguss, and Leftovers variants of Excadrill. Thunder Wave is another useful option, adding the potential to cripple offensive threats such as Latios, Iron Moth, Enamorus, and Z-Celebrate Victini. Defensive teams may choose to employ a more passive variant of Clefable using Wish and Protect to provide longevity to Pokemon without access to reliable recovery such as Mega Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Celesteela. Aromatherapy is similarly useful to allow teammates to outlast the opposing team. Additionally, it allows for more aggressive play against Pokemon reliant on status such as Skeledirge, allowing for them to be safely Pursuit trapped by Mega Tyranitar. Clefable’s ability to spread chip damage through utility moves such as Stealth Rock and Knock Off lends it to supporting wallbreakers like Latios, Galarian Zapdos, and Excadrill. Clefable also pairs well with entry hazard users such as Mega Tyranitar, Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Sandy Shocks to wear down the opposition, as it can get rid of items from entry hazard removers such as Excadrill, Tapu Fini, and Rotom-W. Clefable struggles with heavy hitters able to trade powerful attacks for the chip damage inflicted by Clefable, such as Iron Moth, Excadrill, and Enamorus. This weakness is mitigated by teammates able to act as revenge killers like Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos, Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, and Mega Aerodactyl. Defensive partners such as Slowbro, Celesteela, Mega Tyranitar, and Blissey can beat Steel, Poison, and Fire-types which often beat Clefable. In return, Clefable can beat Dark- and Fighting-types such as Buzzwole, Iron Hands, Hydreigon, and Mandibuzz. Clefable is also a good switch-in to many Knock Off users that might cripple many of its partners, most notably Assault Vest Tangrowth and Chansey.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Calm Mind Clefable is a strong wincon, becoming extremely difficult to threaten once boosted. Magic Guard allows it to set up in the face of defensive Pokemon that would otherwise rely on status moves to threaten it, such as specially oriented Buzzwole, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Leftovers is the preferred item to decrease the likelihood of running out of Soft-Boiled PP, but Life Orb can also be used in combination with Magic Guard for a significant increase in damage, helping defeat Pokemon such as specially defensive Celesteela, Taunt Tapu Fini, and Excadrill. Flamethrower is preferred to hit Steel-types such as Excadrill, Aegislash, Celesteela, and Scizor. Thunder can also be used for passable neutral coverage in addition to the chance to paralyze foes such as Iron Moth, Hisuian Arcanine, and Mega Venusaur. Knock Off offers more permanent damage on Steel-types, removing their items such as Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots at the cost of being unable to directly break through them. Aromatherapy is often seen on stall teams in addition to Unaware, allowing Clefable to function as both the team’s cleric and wincon. Clefable naturally checking Fighting-types makes it a good teammate for Pokemon such as Excadrill and Bisharp. Mega Tyranitar appreciates this while providing Clefable with crucial Pursuit support, trapping Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge. Offensive pivots such as Choice Band Galarian Zapdos and Choice Scarf Hydreigon appreciate Clefable taking advantage of the defensive walls they might be unable to break through. Calm Mind Clefable is vulnerable to foes able to immediately threaten it such as Excadrill, Celesteela, and Iron Moth. Steel- and Poison-resistant teammates such as Celesteela, Slowbro, and Mega Aerodactyl can cover for Clefable, giving it more opportunities to set up. Unaware Clefable being pressured by entry hazards means it necessitates strong hazard control options, such as Defog Skarmory, Mega Sableye, and Salamence. A relative lack of bulk and initial power means friendly entry hazards are appreciated from teammates including Skarmory, Chansey, Hippowdon, and Jirachi that can help wear down incoming defensive Pokemon more quickly.</p>"

It's able to fulfill many roles such as a Stealth Rock setter, a support Pokemon thanks to Thunder Wave and Knock Off crippling its checks like Heatran and Mega Scizor, and a potent sweeper with Calm Mind. Magic Guard lets Clefable absorb status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp for teammates like Ting-Lu, Ferrothorn, and Gastrodon. It also allows it to ignore entry hazards, helping it check Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Dragapult. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn from Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T. Tera Water allows Clefable to have a better matchup into rain teams while resisting Steel-type attacks from Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Kingambit, allowing Clefable to catch them off-guard and cripple them. Tera Steel, on the other hand, allows Clefable to catch Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant with a Thunder Wave. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn appreciate Clefable's ability to incapacitate common Defog users such as Tornadus-T and Rotom-W thanks to Knock Off. They also appreciate having one moveslot being freed if Clefable carries Stealth Rock. Similarly, Clefable can cripple common entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Heatran, helping Defog users like the aforementioned Tornadus-T and Rotom-W perform their role. Toxapex works well with Clefable, as it checks Poison- and Steel-types like Iron Moth and Mega Scizor, helping Clefable spread Thunder Wave or set up with Calm Mind. They can also both overwhelm Ferrothorn, as the former can burn it and the latter nullifies Leech Seed's recovery. If Thunder Wave is used, Hex users like Gholdengo and Dragapult can be used to break Pokemon like Toxapex and Heatran that would otherwise stop Clefable from sweeping with Calm Mind.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Boasting a great ability and various coverage options, Clefable cements itself as a great bulky setup sweeper on Fairy teams, threatening hard-to-beat Pokemon like Corviknight, Toxapex, and Empoleon. Moonblast provides a reliable and powerful STAB move that hits neutral targets such as Gastrodon, Mamoswine, and Ogerpon-W. Alternatively, Ice Beam may be used to hit Ground- and Flying-type Pokemon like Clodsire, Zapdos, Ursaluna-B, and Gliscor. Thunderbolt threatens the aforementioned Corviknight, Toxapex, and Empoleon as well as Basculegion-F, Moltres, and Manaphy. Flamethrower may be used to hit Steel-types such as Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Scizor; it should also be noted that Clefable survives a Bullet Punch from Choice Band Scizor and OHKOes it back. Magic Guard notably offers Clefable an extremely valuable immunity to entry hazards due to the Fairy type's lack of entry hazard removal, in addition to negating Toxic from Toxapex, Gliscor, and Clodsire and letting Clefable use Life Orb without recoil, enhancing its setup ability. Furthermore, Magic Guard allows Clefable to combat Alolan Muk more effectively, and Life Orb enables valuable damage rolls like 2HKOing Toxapex with unboosted Thunderbolt, 2HKOing Assault Vest Iron Hands using Moonblast after a Calm Mind, OHKOing Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao with Calm Mind-boosted Thunderbolt and Moonblast, respectively, and applying additional pressure on Quagsire. Leftovers is the preferred item, however, due to Moonlight's limited recovery and Clefable's mediocre bulk. The given EV spread allows Clefable to outpace Corviknight and maximizes its physical bulk, lessening the chance of Clefable being revenge killed once set up, notably letting it take two Iron Heads from Corviknight.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is an excellent teammate due to its ability to remove Steel-types like Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit as well as beat Poison-types such as Okidogi and Clodsire using Psyshock. Iron Valiant also provides setup opportunities for Clefable via Trick, hindering walls like Gastrodon and Heavy Slam Ting-Lu. In return, Clefable wears down Flying-types like Corviknight, Moltres, and Gliscor as well as Poison-types such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. Klefki provides dual screens support to aid in Clefable's Calm Mind setup, deters setup sweepers such as Scizor and Ogerpon-W with Foul Play, and sets up Spikes to wear down foes like Alolan Muk. Azumarill is a major asset in the Ground, Fire, and Steel matchups, threatening Clodsire, Hisuian Arcanine, and Gholdengo as well as aiding in the Poison matchup by removing walls like Alolan Muk and Galarian Slowking. Flutter Mane aids in the Ghost matchup, taking out threats like Gholdengo and Ceruledge and eliminating threats such as Articuno and Volcarona with Power Gem and Okidogi and Clodsire with Psyshock. In return, Flutter Mane appreciates Clefable chipping down Toxapex, Gliscor, and specially defensive Corviknight. Hatterene takes on Poison-types such as Sneasler and Okidogi as well as threatening Gastrodon and Barraskewda via Giga Drain and can free up a moveslot for Clefable to use Thunderbolt if using Mystical Fire. Tinkaton offers a Poison-type immunity, Stealth Rock support, and the removal of roadblocks like Galarian Slowking, Articuno, Hatterene, and Alolan Muk. Furthermore, Tinkaton aids in Clefable's setup via Knock Off and Encore by taking away passive healing from Pokemon like Clodsire, Alolan Muk, and Iron Treads and locking walls into moves. Choice Scarf Enamorus provides a Ground-type immunity and various anti-Steel coverage options to combat Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Heatran as well as provides Healing Wish support to give Clefable more setup opportunities late-game.</p>"

Aside from this, with a Choice Scarf, Ninetales is able to outspeed and threaten the likes of Choice Scarf Great Tusk and non-Choice Scarf Iron Treads. With Will-O-Wisp, Ninetales is able to weaken physical attackers such as Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Dragonite. Solar Beam allows Ninetales to threaten the likes of Gastrodon, Quagsire, Barraskewda, and Rotom-W, which all resist its Fire-type STAB attacks. With Encore, Ninetales can force out passive Pokemon to create an opportunity to freely switch out into one of its teammates, as well as lock Pokemon like Baxcalibur and Iron Defense Zamazenta into their setup moves.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Ceruledge are two of the biggest beneficiaries of Ninetales's sun, boosting their Fire-type STAB moves to great levels. In return, they can threaten Kommo-o and Flutter Mane with Psychic and Poltergeist, respectively. Sun's boost to Bitter Blade can also increase Ceruledge's longevity. Ogerpon-H's part Grass-typing allows it to match up well against Pokemon Ninetales struggles with, such as Gliscor, Heatran, and Empoleon. Because Ninetales is susceptible to entry hazards, hazard removal from the likes of Cinderace and Talonflame is appreciated. Talonflame's typing also allows it to check various Ground-types such as Gliscor and Iron Treads for Ninetales. Heatran is another great teammate, as with a combination of Taunt and Magma Storm, it is able to trap and remove walls Ninetales struggles with like Toxapex.

Freeze-Dry is useful against Water teams, being able to threaten Pelipper and Quagsire out and win the weather war against rain. Moonblast is useful against the ubiquitous Fighting- and Dragon-types in the tier, as it hits Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Baxcalibur, and Kommo-o that are otherwise problems for Ice teams. Encore allows Alolan Ninetales to lock a defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex, into a weak move or a setup sweeper, such as Iron Defense Corviknight, into a stat-boosting move, letting Alolan Ninetales's teammates take care of the aforementioned Pokemon.</p> <p>Baxcalibur is an amazing teammate for Alolan Ninetales, as it is an incredibly dangerous sweeper that can run through teams after one Swords Dance or Dragon Dance, which is easily facilitated by Alolan Ninetales's snow and Aurora Veil. It also appreciates Alolan Ninetales giving it setup opportunities thanks to Encore and eliminating Quagsire thanks to Freeze-Dry. Alolan Ninetales appreciates Baxcalibur's ability to switch in on Fire-type moves and gain an Attack boost for itself, as well as run through Poison and Steel teams. Chien-Pao provides wallbreaking power or clean-up potential depending on its set while also hitting Steel-types such as Heatran, Kingambit, and Empoleon with a strong Sacred Sword. It appreciates Alolan Ninetales's ability to hit Fighting-types. Mamoswine can threaten Fire-types like Heatran and Torkoal with Earthquake, while packing Thick Fat for a pseudo-Fire neutrality. Additionally, it sets Stealth Rock, which can help Alolan Ninetales pick off weakened threats such as Baxcalibur. It also appreciates the bulk boost in snow. Cetitan is a great partner, as Slush Rush allows it to outspeed and OHKO most of the metagame after a Belly Drum boost, which is easier to acquire thanks to snow and Aurora Veil from Alolan Ninetales. Alolan Sandslash appreciates snow and Aurora Veil both bolstering its bulk and Slush Rush doubling its Speed. In exchange, Alolan Sandslash can use Rapid Spin to clear entry hazards and deal with Hatterene and Flutter Mane, which can both take advantage of Alolan Ninetales. It can also threaten Fire, Steel, and Poison teams with Earthquake. Cloyster brings a lot to the table: namely another Fire neutrality, a way to hit Fire-types such as Talonflame and Ceruledge thanks to Rock Blast and Water-type coverage, and a high Defense stat that makes it nearly unbreakable in snow. In return, Alolan Ninetales facilitates Cloyster's Shell Smash thanks to Aurora Veil and snow support. It also appreciates Alolan Ninetales locking defensive answers to Cloyster, such as Toxapex and Corviknight, into unfavorable moves. Avalugg is a defensive behemoth that, when under snow and Aurora Veil, takes on almost every physical attacker in the tier. It can also remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin to improve Alolan Ninetales's lacking longevity. Finally, Frosmoth becomes a dangerous sweeping threat under snow and Aurora Veil thanks to Quiver Dance, letting it potentially win the Ground, Flying, and Fairy matchups.</p>"

Heavy-Duty Boots helps to provide more opportunities for Alolan Dugtrio to come in by negating entry hazards, while Life Orb provides a damage boost, which can be especially helpful if Alolan Dugtrio chooses not to run Swords Dance. Air Balloon is also a choice, making Alolan Dugtrio immune to Ground-type moves, like Dugtrio or Gabite's Earthquake, as well as providing a temporary immunity to Sticky Web and Spikes. Tera Ground allows for Alolan Dugtrio's Earthquake to deal even more damage, which is especially helpful against neutral targets like Gabite. Tera Steel is also an option, as it provides key resistances against moves such as Gogoat's Horn Leech and Choice Scarf Rotom-F's Blizzard while also boosting the power of Iron Head.</p> <p>Alolan Dugtrio serves as an excellent wallbreaker for fast-paced offensive teams that need a combination of speed and power to deal with threats such as Carbink, Pyroar, and Dachsbun. Due to being one of the few Steel-types available in the tier, Alolan Dugtrio's access to a strong, fast Iron Head is a quality greatly appreciated by common Fire-type wallbreakers such as Charizard, Pyroar, and Houndoom, which struggle against common Rock-types such as Carbink and Lycanroc-N. In return, Alolan Dugtrio greatly appreciates the Fire-types' ability to deal with Grass-types such as Gogoat and Thwackey, as these Grass-types resist Earthquake and also often have good matchups against the entry hazard setters it is paired with. This especially applies to Thwackey, which further reduces the damage of Alolan Dugtrio's Earthquake by setting Grassy Terrain. A teammate that can deal with Misdreavus, such as Haunter or Houndoom, is also imperative, as Misdreavus can easily cripple Alolan Dugtrio with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

        "Choice Item": {
          "description": "<p>Alongside Alolan Dugtrio's amazing typing, great Speed, and decent Attack, Choice items make it a more immediate offensive threat compared to support items such as Heavy-Duty Boots. Stone Edge is Alolan Dugtrio's best coverage option, hitting the few Pokemon that resist its STAB combination like Rotom-S and Charizard. Sucker Punch can also situationally be used alongside Choice Scarf to move before foes like Aqua Jet Basculin. Memento is good late-game, allowing Alolan Dugtrio to provide momentum and offer potential setup opportunities for teammates. Stealth Rock is a niche option on Choice Scarf sets if a team has no space for it otherwise, and, although it is a bad move to be locked into, it can also be used to fake being non-Choice Scarf. Jolly is by far the preferred nature to outspeed threats such as Basculin and Pyroar, but Adamant can be used with Choice Band to further Alolan Dugtrio's wallbreaking capabilities. Tangling Hair is situational but can punish moves such as Skuntank's Sucker Punch and Choice Scarf Sawsbuck's Horn Leech. Tera Ground and Steel power up Alolan Dugtrio's STAB moves to harder hit select targets, such as Earthquake against Whiscash and Lumineon and Iron Head against Gogoat and Misdreavus. They also offer defensive perks, such as Tera Ground making Alolan Dugtrio lose the weakness to Gabite's Earthquake and Tera Steel the weakness to Basculin's Aqua Jet. Choice Band makes Alolan Dugtrio a threatening wallbreaker, and Choice Scarf provides speed control for fast threats such as Alolan Persian, Dugtrio, and +1 Quiver Dance Masquerain. Alolan Dugtrio is notably one of the fastest Choice Scarf users, outspeeding not only other Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F and Haunter but also Speed-boosting setup move users such as Dragon Dance Charizard and Agility Wyrdeer. This also means that even without the extra Speed, Choice Band Dugtrio still makes for solid Speed control, especially alongside Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Alolan Dugtrio makes for great glue on balance and offensive teams, being flexibly able to swap Choice items based on the team's need of either a wallbreaker or speed control while also being a last resort option for roles such as Stealth Rock setter and Volt Switch immunity if need be. Due to being Choice-locked, Alolan Dugtrio is very prediction reliant, which means an incorrect prediction could allow common threats such as Dragon Dance Charizard and Bulk Up Gogoat to use it as setup fodder. Bulky teammates with utility moves can stop this from getting out of hand, such as Haze Mareanie, Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp Misdreavus, and Roar Dachsbun. Being Choice-locked will inevitably also lead to a lot of switches, and while Alolan Dugtrio's typing allows it to switch into a handful of moves such as Lycanroc's Stone Edge and Rotom-F's Volt Switch or Discharge, its common weaknesses and frailty leave it at risk of being OHKOed by attacks such as Close Combat and Blizzard. Pivots such as Alolan Persian, Raichu, and Lumineon can help take away this risk and increase Alolan Dugtrio's overall longevity. Alolan Persian and Raichu can also run Nasty Plot sets, which benefit from Alolan Dugtrio's Memento making setting up easier. Alolan Dugtrio can be paired with other Choice item users like Haunter and Basculin to create mind games as to which the wallbreaker and Choice Scarf user are while also helping one another weaken foes and clean up the match, respectively. An alternative option to Alolan Dugtrio is its Kantonian form, Dugtrio. Dugtrio's higher Speed allows it to naturally outspeed Alolan Persian and Raichu, although lack of secondary STAB makes it worse with Choice items and is overall better used as a setup sweeper or wallbreaker. Alolan Dugtrio should be used if seeking immediate power as a wallbreaker with Choice Band or reliable speed control with Choice Scarf.</p>"

Tera Fighting allows Mankey to hit as hard as possible with Close Combat in situations where an unboosted hit is insufficient.

Scald serves as a spammable STAB attack that can cripple targets with burns, dissuading otherwise decent checks like Mega Tyranitar from setting up. Even foes that don't rely on physical attacks, like Latios, tend to dislike the chip from burn. Future Sight supports wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar, Buzzwole, and Enamorus in breaking through their checks such as Tangrowth and Skarmory for the former two and Mega Venusaur for the latter. It also synergizes excellently with Teleport. Slack Off serves as reliable recovery that doesn't require Slowbro to switch out. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Slowbro to avoid taking damage from entry hazards, maximizing HP regained from Regenerator, though Rocky Helmet can be held instead to punish contact move users, notably foes that run U-turn like Victini. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to make Slowbro as slow as possible, maximizing its odds of moving slower than opposing Teleport users. Slowbro best fits on bulky offense and balance teams looking for a reliable defensive pivot that can also generate momentum for wallbreakers. Hazard-stacking teammates like Skarmory, defensive Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Hippowdon pair up nicely with Future Sight, further putting pressure on opposing defensive cores. Many hazard-stacking teammates can also double as checks to Pokemon Slowbro struggles against, such as Clefable and Ting-Lu checking Dark-types like Hydreigon, Skarmory handling Bug- and Grass-types like Buzzwole and Tapu Bulu, and Hippowdon and Ting-Lu checking Electric-types like Iron Hands. Similarly, pivots like Scizor also check threats like Clefable while pairing nicely with Slowbro's own pivoting potential to maintain offensive momentum. If it isn't running Heavy-Duty Boots, hazard control from teammates like Hydreigon, Excadrill, and Mega Altaria is necessary.</p>"

Abomasnow also has Leech Seed support to improve Cloyster's longevity and handles Unaware Pokemon Quagsire and Dondozo with its STAB Giga Drain. Cloyster is able to threaten Fire's weather setter Torkoal after a boost, which benefits Abomasnow, as it can come back in to reset the weather for its teammates. Cloyster also appreciates Chien-Pao as an offensive partner, as Swords Dance sets are able to weaken its defensive checks like Toxapex, Kingambit and Rotom-W. Choice Scarf sets are also able to clean up late-game more easily thanks to Cloyster's sweeping. Baxcalibur is also one more offensive partner for Cloyster, as its ability to switch into Will-o-Wisp from Pokemon like Sableye and Rotom-W supports Cloyster's sweeping capabilities, while Cloyster offers additional support against the Dragon-types that threaten Baxcalibur like Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Hydreigon. Choice Band Baxcalibur can also wear down defensive walls like Corviknight and Skeledirge, which gives Cloyster an easier sweep. Glaceon also pairs well with Cloyster, as it can threaten defensive Water-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Dondozo with Freeze-Dry. Avalugg can support Cloyster with its Rapid Spin to remove hazards, so Cloyster can come in easier and set up. Avalugg is also able to handle Cloyster's offensive checks like Great Tusk under snow. Froslass is Ice's only viable option for Spikes, which Cloyster appreciates, as defensive Pokemon like Hatterene and Iron Hands aren't able to check it properly after a boost.</p>"

Sludge Bomb threatens Pokemon such as Appletun and Cacturne and can inflict poison on special walls like Eelektross, which pressures them throughout the match. It can also threaten various Pokemon such as Tera Fairy Umbreon and Drifblim. Nasty Plot can be run instead to give Haunter a boosting option after it has gotten rid of its Choice Scarf via Trick, threatening Pokemon such as Umbreon much more effectively. Destiny Bond can be used as a last resort to neutralize dangerous setup sweepers such as Coil Eelektross, Coil Sandaconda, and Bulk Up Ursaring as well as punish offensive threats such as Passimian, Zoroark, and Scyther that may attempt to revenge kill Haunter after it has lost its Choice Scarf. Tera Ghost is able to increase Haunter's cleaning potential by powering up Shadow Ball. Tera Fighting can be used to assist Haunter versus Pokemon such as Cacturne and Lycanroc by granting resistances to Sucker Punch and Accelerock, and it also powers up Focus Blast. Haunter has horrible bulk and cannot take even resisted hits well, so it is advised that you pair it with pivots such as Eelektross, Passimian, and Scyther. Furthermore, Haunter struggles with special walls such as Chansey, Umbreon, and Muk, so powerful physical attackers such as Passimian and Medicham can assist in solving this issue.</p>"

Taunt shuts down recovery attempts from checks like Gogoat, setup attempts from Pokemon like Rotom-F, and entry hazards from foes like Carbink and Tinkatuff. The move pairs well with Electrode's nature as a pivot, giving partners an easier time setting up without dealing with annoying status. Due to Electrode's relative fragility and the prevalence of entry hazards, Aftermath is more effective at punishing priority users like Alolan Dugtrio and Basculin, as they are much more afraid of the guaranteed chip damage when revenge killing Electrode than the potential paralysis that Static provides. Tera Blast Fighting is an solid option that lets Electrode revenge kill Alolan Dugtrio, Houndoom, and Rotom-F as well as dent walls like Hisuian Sliggoo and Dunsparce. Tera Blast Ice is very useful for hitting Ground- and Grass-types like Gabite and Gogoat, although its inability to OHKO Whiscash does hinder its viability. Tera Water increases Electrode's revenge killing capability against Fire-types like Charizard and Pyroar, as well as Alolan Dugtrio; however, it also leaves it susceptible to Electric-types like Raichu and opposing Electrode in the one-on-one matchup. Lastly, Tera Grass is useful for hitting Whiscash, Carbink, and Klawf all in the same slot, something no other Tera type allows Electrode to do, while Tera Ground is also an option to specifically hit Raichu.</p> <p>Electrode fits best with strong mid-game wallbreakers that struggle to get in, such as Zangoose and Basculin. Not only do they enjoy the free turn on Pokemon such as Gogoat and Carbink, they can also break down shared checks such as Gabite, making it easier for Electrode to win late-game. Whiscash is a major annoyance for Electrode, as it is immune to Taunt and is the only viable Ground-type to not take super effective damage from either of Electrode's common Tera types; thus, a strong Grass-type like Gogoat or Sawsbuck is recommended as a partner. They can also potentially force Whiscash to Terastallize, removing its Electric immunity for Electrode. Other fast Pokemon like Alolan Persian and Rotom-F can form a VoltTurn core with Electrode, utilizing entry hazards and a good Speed tier to pivot into each other's checks, such as Flapple, Skuntank, and Misdreavus, racking up chip damage.

Other Water-types such as Basculin and Wugtrio enjoy having their Water-moves boosted as well. Masquerain is a particularly notable partner, as it has its Hurricane made 100% accurate, it can set up on foes it could normally not set up on outside of rain, such as Pyroar and Camerupt and has its Water-type coverage boosted as well, letting it chip foes like Carbink harder. Electric-types such as Raichu and Rotom-F enjoy being able to use a 100% accurate Thunder and can offensively check the opposing Water-types that would want to take advantage of rain, such as Basculin.

          "description": "<p>Galarian Weezing finds itself serving a key role on Poison thanks to its high physical bulk, wonderful support moves, and, most critically, Levitate giving it a critical Ground immunity to deal with both offensive and defensive Ground-types, such as Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Mamoswine, without much worry. Its secondary Fairy typing is also a major boon for Poison, making it immune to Dragon, which gives it utility in absorbing high powered Dragon moves like Glaive Rush from Baxcalibur and completely checking Garchomp. It also provides a helpful resistance to Dark, giving it added bulk against Dark-types like Alolan Muk and Meowscarada. Strange Steam is used for its STAB attack, dealing solid damage and threatening Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-types such as Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Roaring Moon. Defog is incredibly valuable, being the only consistent form of entry hazard removal on Poison, which Galarian Weezing can easily switch in and use thanks to its immunity to Spikes and neutrality to Stealth Rock This also allows it to run Black Sludge to further increase its longevity. Pain Split acts as a form of recovery and offensive pressure, allowing it to drain away health from opposing walls such as Toxapex and Gliscor while healing itself back up. Will-O-Wisp threatens physical attackers from those that it walls like Great Tusk and Dragonite and impairs others that do threaten it like Iron Treads and Corviknight, making them much easier to handle.</p> <p>Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking are amazing teammates for Galarian Weezing that cover Galarian Weezing's biggest weakness: low Special Defense. As specially bulky tanks, they can switch into strong special attacks, such as Choice Specs Greninja's Extrasensory, while majorly appreciating Defog from Galarian Weezing to maximize their longevity. Alolan Muk handles Psychic- and Ghost-type attacks from foes like Flutter Mane, Spectrier, and Espathra with ease thanks to its Dark typing and STAB Knock Off. Meanwhile, Galarian Slowking can soak up hits from Heatran, Regieleki, and Volcarona while responding back with its myriad of coverage, as well as create traps with Future Sight, which Galarian Weezing can exploit with Strange Steam or use as a chance to Defog safely. Toxapex's Water typing allows it to switch into and wall the many Steel-types of the tier like Scizor, Tinkaton, and Empoleon. It also handles other powerful threats such as Chien-Pao and Ceruledge, using Haze to stop their setup and Infestation or Surf to do damage. Toxapex is also a valuable Knock Off absorber in the Dragon, Dark, and Ice matchups, preventing Galarian Weezing from losing its Black Sludge from foes such as Cyclizar, Sableye, and Alolan Sandslash. Amoonguss appreciates Galarian Weezing taking the stress off it in the Ground matchup and allowing for it to have a much easier time taking on threats, such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Mamoswine, after they have been burned. Amoonguss is also able to handle threats to Galarian Weezing like Gastrodon and Sandy Shocks. Thanks to Defog allowing Salazzle safe entry, it can threaten every Steel-type in the tier with a mix of its STAB Flamethrower and Toxic thanks to Corrosion, which puts Steel-types that try to threaten it, such as Heatran and Hisuian Goodra, on timers, and it means Galarian Weezing won't have to worry about them late-game. Glimmora can be used instead of Salazzle, as it also can use Toxic thanks to Corrosion, has Earth Power to hit Heatran, has Energy Ball to help out against Ground-types, such as Great Tusk and Gastrodon, and if its Air Balloon is still intact, it can inflict Toxic onto Clodsire with no fear. With Defog support, Choice Scarf Sneasler can come onto the field safely and fire off strong its strong STAB Close Combat and Dire Claw against threats like Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Enamorus. Okidogi also works well as a Fighting-type that majorly appreciates burn being spread to have an easier time setting up before tearing into threats like Kingambit and Heatran with its STAB moves. Defog support will also allow safe entry for Iron Moth, which melts Steel-types with its powerful Fire-type STAB attacks, such as Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Corviknight, as well as being able to eradicate Landorus if using Choice Specs with Overheat. Gengar is another solid Choice Specs user that can scare out Skeledirge, which otherwise uses Galarian Weezing for setup and can also deal with Landorus with Icy Wind.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its gargantuan Eviolite-boosted special bulk alongside a lack of relevant weaknesses, Chansey stands firmly as a formidable wall that blanket checks the metagame's special attackers, including Dragapult, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona. Toxic lets Chansey whittle them down, especially in conjunction with repeated Seismic Tosses, while Thunder Wave punishes poison-immune foes like Heatran and Toxapex and cripples switch-ins such as Mega Lopunny and Kingambit. Chansey can provide cleric support with Aromatherapy, especially since it can switch into status users like Clodsire and Rotom-W thanks to Natural Cure. However, Stealth Rock can be used if the team lacks another user, and Chansey can do it sufficiently by outlasting common entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T. Tera Steel allows it to reliably check Tapu Lele, Hatterene, and Tornadus-T, and it prevents Chansey from being poisoned. Chansey is generally reserved for bulkier builds that appreciate its defensive profile and can tolerate its overall passivity. Sturdy walls like Skeledirge, Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Corviknight can cover physical attackers like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Kartana for Chansey. Skeledirge's Unaware helps against setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Mega Charizard X that attempt to use Chansey as setup fodder, while Corviknight's Defog alleviates Chansey from entry hazard pressure that would overwhelm it easily. Knock Off and Trick absorbers like Clefable, Toxapex, Mega Scizor, and Gholdengo make sure that Chansey can keep its valuable Eviolite; Additionally, Mega Scizor helps deal with Psyshock Tapu Lele, Gholdengo threatens Calm Mind Hatterene, and Calm Mind Clefable overwhelms Heatran—especially if it's paralyzed—all of which are special attackers that can beat Chansey one-on-one.</p>"

This provides a myriad of benefits, including blanket checking most Pokemon, scouting sets, and PP stalling less threatening foes. These traits make Imposter Chansey a valuable addition to almost every team. The given moves offer the most utility in the rare situations Chansey is not transformed, allowing it to Imposter-proof certain special attackers and act as a cleric. While Eviolite is usually the best item, Covert Cloak is useful against Spirit Shackle and Salt Cure users, and Spooky Plate allows Chansey to threaten Arceus-Ghost and Lunala that would otherwise defeat it with Judgment. Offensive threats such as Ultra Necrozma appreciate the information Imposter Chansey provides through scouting; physical attackers in particular highly appreciate moves like Burning Bulwark being discovered. Special attackers enjoy Imposter Chansey taking advantage of RegenVest users and potentially Imposter-proofing them. Imposter Chansey appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon like Celesteela and Mega Steelix so it can safely scout. Specially defensive Pokemon like Ice Scales Arceus formes and Magic Guard Blissey can serve as checks to opposing Take Heart Arceus formes, which can beat Imposter Chansey one-on-one, while also checking Dragon-type attackers like Eternatus and Miraidon that can hit it hard.</p>"

Close Combat strikes Steel-types like Orthworm and Copperajah as well as Coalossal. Alternatively, if your team needs extra late-game potential, Swords Dance helps Scyther sweep once its checks are weakened or removed.

These pivots can threaten physical walls like Sandaconda, Qwilfish, and Orthworm; in return, Scyther can pressure special walls like Goodra and Assault Vest Hariyama.

Close Combat hits Steel- and Rock-types like Orthworm and Coalossal for super effective damage. Alternatively, U-turn lets Scyther pivot against physical walls like Sandaconda and Gligar, as well as Pokemon that resist Dual Wingbeat like Orthworm and Copperajah. Quick Attack lets Scyther OHKO faster foes like Jolteon and Salazzle after it Terastallizes and boosts with Swords Dance. Tera Grass removes Scyther’s 4x weakness to Stealth Rock and allows Scyther to 2HKO Sandaconda with +2 Trailblaze, while Tera Flying strengthens its Dual Wingbeat to frightening levels and makes non-resistant foes easy to get by.</p> <p>Swords Dance Scyther is best used mid- to late-game, where it has a better chance of picking off sufficiently weakened physical walls like Gligar and Sandaconda. If U-turn is selected, VoltTurn pivots like Rotom-C, Jolteon, and Mesprit are excellent teammates, threatening out walls like Sandaconda and Qwilfish while providing additional utility or coverage. Revenge killers like Tauros and Choice Scarf Rotom-C can preemptively cause Scyther to Terastalize or stop its sweep altogether, so specific checks to them like Sandaconda and Goodra, respectively, can help preserve Scyther's longevity. Special wallbreakers like Goodra, Hoopa, and Salazzle can remove physical walls so Scyther can find better chances to sweep late-game.</p>"

Swords Dance boosts its power even further, overpowering foes such as Toxapex and Celesteela. Return is its main Flying-type STAB move, hitting Grass-, Bug-, and Fighting-types such as Mega Venusaur, Volcarona, and Kommo-o,. Using Frustration with 0 happiness is also an option, as it prevents Ditto from doing too much damage after copying Mega Pinsir. Quick Attack allows Mega Pinsir to revenge kill fast threats such as Iron Valiant, Ogerpon-H, and +1 Kommo-o. Close Combat nails Steel- and Rock-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar, but Earthquake is also viable to hit Gholdengo and Aegislash, as well as Fire-types such as Torkoal and Volcanion. Mega Pinsir's secondary Flying typing makes it 4x weak to Stealth Rock, so it appreciates entry hazard removal from Rapid Spin users such as Forretress and Armaldo. Forretress also provides great defensive utility, taking physical Flying- and Rock-type moves with ease while having Volt Switch to pivot Mega Pinsir onto the field safely. Mega Pinsir appreciates entry hazards on the opposing side as well, such as Stealth Rock from Kleavor, Spikes and Toxic Spikes from Forretress, and Sticky Web from Araquanid and Galvantula. Furthermore, Kleavor can deal with Flying- and Fire-types such as Zapdos and Moltres, and Araquanid can deal with Fire-types as well as take on strong special attacks from the likes of Tapu Lele and Gholdengo, dealing damage back with Mirror Coat. Araquanid's access to Magic Coat allows it to deflect status and hazards as well. Scizor can check Ice- and Rock-types such as Baxcalibur and Ogerpon-C with its STAB Bullet Punch, as well as pivot with U-turn and remove Stealth Rock with Defog. Choice Scarf Buzzwole is a great partner and revenge killer, being able to wipe out the remaining foes if Mega Pinsir is knocked out. Volcarona appreciates Mega Pinsir's ability to deal with Kommo-o and Mega Venusaur, and in return, it acts as a special sweeper that can deal with physical walls such as Skarmory. Lokix is a great revenge killer thanks to its strong First Impression putting foes into range of Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack. Its access to Throat Chop and Knock Off also deals with Ghost-types, and the former prevents Skeledirge from using Torch Song, which would otherwise be a pain to deal with, while the latter removes items. Equipping Lokix with a Z-Crystal, such as Buginium Z or Darkinium Z, can deal massive damage to foes that would otherwise be difficult to break through.</p>"

Mega Gyarados also possesses a valuable defensive typing that helps against foes such as Gholdengo, Volcarona, and Kingambit. Mold Breaker lets Mega Gyarados break through foes such as Tera Fairy Gastrodon and Skeledirge, the latter being a troublesome foe for teammates such as Dragonite and Dragapult. Substitute allows Mega Gyarados to avoid status from foes such as Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W while also avoiding revenge killers such as Tapu Lele and Kartana. Alternatively, Earthquake lets Mega Gyarados break through Toxapex and Rotom-W. Taunt can also be used to deny recovery, Haze, and Iron Defense from Toxapex and Skarmory, though it is generally not preferred since it leaves Mega Gyarados vulnerable to Scald burns and revenge killers such as Tapu Lele. Mega Gyarados appreciates dual screen support from Tapu Koko, which allows it to set up more easily. In return, Mega Gyarados can pivot into Ground-type attacks from foes such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Mega Gyarados struggles against physical walls such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Buzzwole, so it appreciates teammates such as Volcarona and Iron Valiant handling them. Entry hazard support from teammates such as Landorus-T and Glimmora helps weaken defensive foes such as Tangrowth and Tera Water Landorus-T for Mega Gyarados. Teammates such as Dragonite also appreciate Mega Gyarados weakening defensive foes such as Skeledirge and Ferrothorn so it can clean late-game.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to Ditto's signature ability Imposter, which also copies enemy stat changes, Ditto is one of the best revenge killers in the tier. Ditto's presence alone scares off sweepers like Baxcalibur and Azumarill from setting up. Ditto does not copy the enemy HP stat, so 248 HP EVs are used to minimize damage taken from entry hazards before transforming while maximizing Ditto's HP stat, as well as allowing Ditto to use Struggle 4 times before it faints. 252 Defense EVs minimize the damage Ditto takes from opposing Ditto in the extremely rare mirror matchup. Finally, a Relaxed nature coupled with 0 Speed IVs guarantees that Imposter will never activate first, which ensures that Ditto will have more Transform PP in the aforementioned mirror match.</p> <p>Ursaluna is a great teammate for Ditto, as it can switch into walls and begin applying immediate pressure. Ditto also appreciates Ursaluna's unrivaled ability to punch holes in the opposing team, making a late-game Ditto sweep much easier. If Ditto copies certain targets like Chien-Pao and a majority of the opposing team is weakened, Ditto can win the game. Indeedee is a good teammate for Ditto, as its Psychic Surge ability prevents Ditto from being picked off by priority moves. Blissey is a nice partner for Ditto, as it can absorb status moves that would otherwise cripple Ditto and then shrug them off via Natural Cure. Blissey can also use Thunder Wave to slow down opposing Choice Scarf users that would otherwise Speed tie with Ditto such as Meowscarada and Enamorus Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a powerful teammate that pairs well with Ditto, as Ditto can copy the stat boosts from setup sweepers that aim to take advantage of a Choice-locked Hisuian Zoroark. Cyclizar can be used to remove entry hazards so that Ditto can switch in frequently without getting chipped. Additionally, it is able to keep hazards away and use Shed Tail to bring Ditto in behind a Substitute and make it even more threatening. Maushold can use its high speed tier to lock Bulk Up users like Landorus-Therian that would otherwise be able to stall out Ditto. Additionally, Maushold is able to break down walls due to the sheer power of Population Bomb. Pivots are great teammates for Ditto because they can lure in targets for Ditto to copy. Choice Scarf Staraptor and Defensive Braviary are solid picks, as they can use U-turn to go right into Ditto. Braviary is also capable of using Defog to keep Ditto alive for longer.</p>"

Reversing the momentum of fast offensive threats such as Iron Valiant, Mega Charizard X, and Excadrill allows Ditto to force counterplay against offensive teams. Ditto can also take advantage of entry hazard setters and removers, such as Ferrothorn, Kleavor, and Zapdos, using their own longevity or utility against them. In order to take advantage of Pokémon that use either Return or Frustration, such as Mega Altaria or Mega Pinsir, Ditto likes to run 128 Happiness instead of 252 or 0. Walls like Blissey and Porygon2 appreciate Ditto being able to prevent threats such as Baxcalibur and Spectrier from using them as setup fodder, while Ditto appreciates both defensive switch-ins and slow pivots via their use of Teleport. Mega Lopunny is a staple on Normal teams that accents Ditto's role expertly; many of the offensive threats and setup sweepers that revenge kill Mega Lopunny, such as Mega Charizard X, Kommo-o, and Galarian Moltres, are usually very weak to their own sets or coverage. Mega Lopunny can lure a threat in and pivot with U-turn, allowing Ditto to come in safely and transform. Ditto appreciates Mega Lopunny's Speed tier and fast pivot with U-turn, as well as potentially setting up Ditto with Encore Sets to stop foes from using Substitute or setting up completely. Hisuian Zoroark makes for another stellar teammate for Ditto, as Hisuian Zoroark disguised as a passive Pokemon, such as Blissey, or another offensive threat, such as Diggersby or Mega Lopunny, can lead to Hisuian Zoroark wallbreaking and netting KOs on vital foes, making it easier for Ditto to sweep once it has transformed. While Ditto is immune to Sticky Web, it is susceptible to other hazards such as Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, so forms of hazard control such as Staraptor or Cyclizar are appreciated. Staraptor is another defensive option, while Cyclizar can enable Ditto to utilize Transform with a Substitute from Shed Tail. Smeargle on more offense-oriented teams' pairs well with Ditto, as Smeargle can set hazards with Stone Axe or Ceaseless Edge and spread status with Nuzzle, Mortal Spin, or Spore, allowing Ditto to exploit the opposing team easier. Smeargle will usually give up Sticky Web when paired with Ditto so as to not hinder Ditto's revenge killing prowess.</p>"

Earthquake provides Mega Aerodactyl with perfect neutral coverage, hitting Rock-resistant Pokemon as well as targets that are weak to it, such as Tyranitar, Zeraora, and Bisharp, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to threaten them. Dual Wingbeat provides a secondary STAB option that ensures Mega Aerodactyl hits important targets such as Buzzwole, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss super effectively. Taunt can be used instead to deny the likes of bulkier targets, such as Clefable, Skarmory, and Hippowdon, from accessing their healing moves, on top of shutting down setup options from specific setup sweepers, such as Mega Latias. Mega Aerodactyl can even serve as an effective Pursuit trapper; with the Tough Claws boost, it makes for an effective option to use against the likes of Iron Moth, Latios, and Alakazam. Roost is mandatory in the last slot to offset Mega Aerodactyl's Stealth Rock weakness while also allowing it to repeatedly switch into foes such as Iron Moth, resisting most of its attacks in the process. Mega Aerodactyl fits best on bulky offense and balance teams in need of an offensive backbone with solid secondary defensive applications. Bulkier Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Rotom-W appreciate Mega Aerodactyl's ability to relieve pressure in dealing with offensive threats which they may be overwhelmed by, such as Victini and Enamorus. In return, the former two provide hazard support to help Mega Aerodactyl secure damage rolls against Pokemon it would otherwise miss out on, such as against Autotomize Celesteela with Stone Edge and Mega Tyranitar with Earthquake, whereas the latter provides additional pivoting support, hazard removal in Defog to offset Mega Aerodactyl’s weakness to Stealth Rock, and the ability to take on several setup sweepers which it struggles to take on, such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Swords Dance Scizor. Similarly, other Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, such as Excadrill and Mandibuzz, are effective at ensuring Mega Aerodactyl isn’t being dug into by Stealth Rock. On the other hand, offensive Pokemon such as Choice Band Galarian Zapdos, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Tapu Bulu can benefit from Mega Aerodactyl's ability to check or remove faster Pokemon which they may be dissuaded by, such as Iron Moth and Keldeo. Mega Aerodactyl's ability to force in defensive Pokemon can also lead to some interesting synergies with other offensive Pokemon, particularly when carrying Taunt; setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Enamorus, Bulk Up Buzzwole, and Swords Dance Iron Hands each benefit from Mega Aerodactyl's ability to lure in and weaken walls such as Skarmory, Tapu Fini, Slowbro, and Mega Venusaur.</p>"
        },
        "Dragon Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance turns Mega Aerodactyl into a threatening sweeper, leveraging its combination of power, Speed, and coverage to great effect. It particularly preys on faster teams that over-rely on using faster speed control options to check most sweepers, such as Choice Scarf users Galarian Zapdos and Keldeo. Earthquake nails several Ground-weak targets in Excadrill, Tyranitar, and Bisharp after a Dragon Dance, OHKOing the latter. Dual Wingbeat, especially with the boost from Tough Claws, flattens many neutral targets after a Dragon Dance, such as Clefable, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Mega Latias, while also allowing it to beat walls such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth. Alternatively, Mega Aerodactyl can run Roost in the last slot to offset its lack of longevity, potentially grabbing multiple setup opportunities against weaker Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Clefable lacking Thunder Wave. Due to its offensive prowess, this Mega Aerodactyl set fits best on fast-paced teams as an effective mid-to-late game cleaner. Early-game wallbreakers such as Latios and Iron Hands can help Mega Aerodactyl by opening up gaps in the opposition through their numerous offensive applications against walls which the latter may find itself being stopped by, such as Slowbro, Scizor, and Iron Defense Skarmory. Conversely, Mega Aerodactyl’s tendency to find opportunities against specific targets such as Ting-Lu and Mega Venusaur can also work to the benefit of other late-game cleaners, such as Booster Energy Iron Moth and Weakness Policy Latios. As Mega Aerodactyl often finds itself leveraging its bulk to make the most of its setup capabilities, teammates that can prevent entry hazards from going up, such as Taunt Mew, Excadrill, and Tapu Fini, make for excellent partners. Mega Aerodactyl also benefits from entry hazard support provided by the former two, as well as others like Spikes Sandy Shocks, which help it secure OHKOs against Pokemon such as Hydreigon after a Dragon Dance.</p>"

Freeze-Dry is the only offensive move Articuno needs, pressuring many crucial targets throughout the metagame such as both Landorus formes, Toxapex, Quagsire, Ogerpon-W, Manaphy, and Enamorus. Aside from hitting Water-types for super effective damage, Freeze-Dry is also particularly useful on this relatively passive set due to its high 32 PP. This allows Articuno to stay threatening over longer games despite only using one attacking move as well as repeatedly fish for freezes against neutral targets such as Hatterene and Galarian Weezing. Substitute blocks Toxic from Toxapex, Quagsire, Clodsire, and Mandibuzz, allowing Articuno to duel these Pokemon and come out on top. Furthermore, Substitute combined with Roost and Pressure allows Articuno to stall out foes such as Frosmoth and Ursaluna-B, draining their PP so Articuno’s teammates can come in and take advantage of them. As an alternative to Substitute, U-turn can be used to make Articuno less passive and safely bring in teammates against faster foes, which is especially beneficial for teammates such as Choice Band Dragonite and Galarian Moltres. Haze rounds out this set by preventing Articuno from becoming setup fodder against foes such as Sinistcha, Ursaluna-B, Manaphy, and Hatterene. Furthermore, Haze can be used to neutralize Belly Drum Azumarill’s boosts, as with these EVs Articuno will always outspeed it and survive a +6 Aqua Jet from full HP. The given EVs allow Articuno to outrun uninvested Landorus-T, Adamant Torterra, and maximum Speed Azumarill while maximizing special bulk.</p> <p>Gliscor is an excellent partner to Articuno, nullifying Electric-type attacks and Toxic aimed at Articuno, absorbing Knock Off to prevent the removal of Articuno’s Heavy-Duty Boots, and threatening Steel-types such as Heatran and Hisuian Goodra with its STAB Earthquake. In exchange, Gliscor appreciates Articuno taking Ice Beam from threats such as Greninja and handling Water-types such as Walking Wake and Manaphy. Alternatively, physically defensive Landorus-T complements Articuno by threatening Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Kleavor and absorbing Electric-type hits while forming a defensive core with it. Landorus-T similarly appreciates Articuno taking on foes such as Frosmoth and Ogerpon-W while being offensively threatening against Steel- and Fire-types that wall Articuno such as Empoleon, Ceruledge, and Hisuian Arcanine. Physically defensive Corviknight is another teammate that forms a defensive core with Articuno, serving as a check to many physical sweepers that would otherwise take advantage of it, such as Scizor, Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit, especially if running Iron Defense. Moreover, Corviknight can block Toxic aimed at Articuno and clear Stealth Rock using Defog in the event that Articuno has its item removed. In return, Articuno can deal with various special threats that would threaten or take advantage of Corviknight, such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Manaphy, and Slowbro. The combination of Articuno, Corviknight, and specially defensive Gliscor also allows Flying to safely handle all standard variants of Flutter Mane, which is of great use due to how threatening this Pokemon can be to Flying teams if left unchecked. Moltres pairs nicely with Articuno, checking various physical threats such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Ogerpon-H, while Articuno answers Water-types for it. Zapdos and Thundurus-T can take out barriers to Articuno such as Empoleon and Corviknight with their Electric-type STAB moves; physically defensive Zapdos using Heat Wave can also answer Iron Treads and compounds nicely with Articuno’s special walling capabilities and neutrality to Ice. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite, Galarian Moltres, and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T enjoy Articuno removing impediments to their sweeping such as Quagsire, Clodsire, Slowbro, and Amoonguss. Choice Scarf Enamorus supports Articuno by revenge killing foes such as Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and both Urshifu formes, and can use Healing Wish to cure Articuno’s status condition and bring it back to full HP in a pinch. Galarian Zapdos is an alternative Choice Scarf user that also hits the aforementioned targets while lacking a Stealth Rock weakness, possessing the ability to pivot with U-turn, and being more useful against types such as Bug. Physically defensive Gyarados can also aid Articuno by serving as a response to sweepers like Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Dragonite; to return the favor, Articuno deals with Quagsire and Clodsire. It should be noted that this is by no means an exhaustive list of potential teammates for Articuno, as virtually every Flying option appreciates it soaking up Ice Beams and walling special threats.</p>"

Haze helps stop setup sweepers like Farigiraf, Mesprit, and Lilligant, but Hurricane can be used to hit Pokemon like Appletun, Abomasnow, and Cryogonal harder while also helping against Fighting-types such as Hiusian Sneasel and Toxicroak in a pinch. U-turn lets Articuno pivot on incoming Ice-resistant foes like Magneton and Cryogonal while also generating momentum for offensive teammates on the switches Articuno can force against the bevy of Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-types in the tier. The given EV spread allows Articuno to outspeed maximum Speed Cacturne and Ursaring while maintaining as much special bulk as possible. Tera Ground gifts an Electric-type immunity, letting Articuno easily handle Rotom and Eelektross, and it gets a Stealth Rock resistance, which helps Articuno if it gets hit by a Knock Off; Tera Steel helps against setup sweepers such as Mesprit, Lilligant, and Farigiraf so that Articuno can use Haze without fear of being OHKOed; and Tera Fairy can be used to take care of Fighting-types which overwhelm it otherwise with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p>Articuno easily falters in the face of physical wallbreakers like Mabosstiff, Medicham, and Tauros, so Pokemon like Sandaconda, Sableye, and Mesprit to check them pair well with Articuno as they love a partner to tank special attacks. Electric-types like Magneton, Eelektross, and Rotom tend to overpower Articuno; therefore, partners like Appletun, Lurantis, and Eelektross pair well alongside it. Item displacement from Knock Off or Trick is very detrimental for Articuno’s longevity. To combat this, Knock Off absorbers like Sandaconda and Sticky Hold Muk work well to help it. Entry hazard support from Hattrem, Drifblim, and Lurantis also helps Articuno if it happens to lose its item. Wallbreakers such as Samurott, Bruxish, and Pyroar work well alongside Articuno, as it can take care of their checks like Cacturne, Appletun, and Qwilfish. Because Articuno beats Ground- and Grass-types, Electric-types pair well as partners, as they can create a VoltTurn core and whittle down each other’s checks.</p>"

Zapdos effectively switches into physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, Kartana, and Great Tusk, discouraging them from attacking by threatening a chance of paralysis. Zapdos can Volt Switch out as it pleases because of common Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and the aforementioned Great Tusk fearing its powerful Hurricane. Hidden Power Ice can be used to threaten Ground-types like the aforementioned Landorus-T and Garchomp while additionally hitting Gliscor harder and much more reliably than Hurricane. Carrying Heat Wave is recommended with Hidden Power Ice to maintain the ability to OHKO Kartana. These positive matchups into many Ground-types allow Zapdos to serve as a solid Defog user, but it struggles to beat bulkier Stealth Rock users such as Heatran, Mega Tyranitar, and Clodsire. Alternatively, Zapdos can forgo Defog for Heat Wave, allowing it to threaten Pokemon such as Kingambit, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Gholdengo. Tera Steel is utilized by Zapdos to flip its Rock- and Ice-type weaknesses versus Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar, Weavile, and Mega Diancie as well as check Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele in a pinch. However, it becomes weak to common Ground- and Fighting-type moves from Pokemon it wants to check. Tera Dragon is a alternative option to check Ogerpon-W and Urshifu-R in a pinch, and allow Zapdos to pivot or land a Hurricane on the aforementioned two. Teammates that appreciate the spread of paralysis, such as Mega Medicham, Urshifu-R, and Weavile, naturally pair well with Zapdos. Mega Medicham particularly pairs nicely with it, as Mega Medicham threatens Clodsire while enjoying Zapdos pivoting it into favorable matchups such as Heatran, with Zapdos punishing Tornadus-T and Mega Lopunny looking to revenge kill Mega Medicham in return. Pursuit users like Kingambit and the aforementioned Weavile are useful teammates to assist in chipping down Clodsire as well as punishing Dragapult.

Volt Switch allows Zapdos to freely pivot while doing very good damage, especially due to common Ground-types like Landorus-T and Great Tusk being greatly threatened by Hurricane. Hidden Power Ice allows Zapdos to hit Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor for massive damage. Heat Wave is used to surprise Ferrothorn trying to come in on a Thunderbolt or Hurricane as well as consistently threaten Mega Scizor. Flyinium Z allows Zapdos to KO chipped defensive Pokemon that would otherwise be out of range of a Hurricane. If Zapdos is not using Flyinium Z, then it can Tera Flying for stronger Hurricanes. Pokemon like Iron Boulder appreciate offensive Zapdos, as it can rack up chip damage on Pokemon that would otherwise annoy Iron Boulder, such as Garganacl, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn. For rain teams, Zapdos can do good chunks of damage to Pokemon rain teams would otherwise struggle to break, such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn. Galarian Slowking can comfortably take any of Zapdos's moves, and then set up a Future Sight, threaten to poison with Sludge Bomb, or pivot out into an offensive check with Chilly Reception.

Bulky Pokemon that resist one of Zapdos's STAB moves and then threaten Zapdos, like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, can prove to be annoying.

Hurricane is Zapdos's strongest STAB move, being able to OHKO Sableye, Amoonguss, and possibly Quagsire, and also being able to 2HKO physically defensive Skeledirge and Ursaluna. Zapdos can also take advantage of matchups against rain teams by being able to spam Hurricane without fear of missing. Volt Switch allows Zapdos to bring in teammates safely against special walls like Assault Vest Iron Hands, Assault Vest Galarian Slowking, and Heatran. Heat Wave provides Zapdos great coverage, allowing it to 2HKO Magnezone, as well as Klefki under Light Screen and Iron Treads. Static has a chance to paralyze Pokemon that make contact with Zapdos such as Dragonite and Mimikyu.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks makes for a great partner, being able to provide entry hazard support with both Stealth Rock and Spikes, as well as being able to threaten Heatran with Earth Power. Regieleki is another great partner, as it is able to remove hazards with Rapid Spin so that Zapdos can switch in more often without losing a good amount of its health to Stealth Rock. It is also able to outspeed Pokemon that outspeed Zapdos such as Flutter Mane and non-Choice Scarf Greninja. Pokemon with great special bulk such as Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Tyranitar can be tough for Zapdos, with the latter being able to threaten it with Stone Edge. Hence, Iron Hands pairs well with Zapdos, as it is able to threaten Galarian Slowking with Earthquake and Tyranitar with Drain Punch. In return, Zapdos can switch into anticipated Ground-type attacks from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Magnezone is another great partner, being able to threaten Hatterene and Flutter Mane, as well as potentially winning the Chien-Pao matchup. Lastly, Zapdos's wallbreaking opens up sweeping opportunities for fast sweepers such as Nasty Plot Rotom-W and Choice Scarf Pawmot.

It can also scout switches against teams reliant on dealing with Galarian Zapdos through Pokemon that resist Flying and Fighting, as well as allow it to beat faster revenge killers like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Enamorus. Alternatively, Knock Off is an option to slam Slowking and Slowbro if needed, as well as allow Galarian Zapdos to force progress against bulkier targets like Iron Hands and Clefable. Trailblaze is another option on hyper offense teams that can allow Galarian Zapdos to leverage its Bulk Up boosts to sweep by boosting its Speed. Trailblaze also hits Quagsire harder than Brave Bird, which can allow partners on hyper offense builds like Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar to sweep later in the game. Leftovers is an option on Galarian Zapdos if another teammate is using the Z-crystal, and it grants Galarian Zapdos more longevity. It pairs especially well with Substitute, as Leftovers recovery can allow for Galarian Zapdos to set up Substitute multiple times over the course of the game. Bulk Up Galarian Zapdos is mainly used on hyper offense teams and is especially great alongside Ribombee, as it can punish Defog users attempting to remove Ribombee's Sticky Web. It can also be used on balance or fat teams looking for a wincon that can attempt to set up and wallbreak multiple times in a game. Teammates like Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria appreciate Galarian Zapdos switching into and breaking foes like Skarmory and Celesteela, respectively, so they can sweep in the late-game.

Tera Fairy removes all of Moltres' previous weaknesses and strengthen its matchup against Kingambit and Roaring Moon. Alternatively, Tera Water is a solid defensive type that also improves Moltres's rain matchup allowing it to live rain-boosted Tera Water Wave Crash from Floatzel and Basculegion and be able to threaten them back with Will-O-Wisp. 248 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature can be used instead of the Defense investment and Bold nature to more comfortably take on Enamorus and most special Iron Valiant sets. Great Tusk can form a good core with Moltres thanks to Great Tusk's ability to threaten Moltres's switch-ins, such as Garganacl, Ting-Lu, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran, and remove Stealth Rock if Moltres loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. Ting-Lu can take advantage of Moltres's switch-ins such as Zapdos, Dragapult, and Iron Moth to lay entry hazards while Moltres covers it against Fighting- and Fairy-types such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler. Similarly, Gholdengo handles offensive threats that may overwhelm Moltres, such as pivot Sneasler and Iron Valiant, while Moltres covers it against Cinderace and Kingambit. Setup sweepers such as Kingambit and Iron Valiant can make great use of Moltres's ability to generate free turns by pivoting them into play and spreading burn for easier setup.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Moltres’s main niche comes from its variety of useful qualities making it a prominent defensive Pokemon. It is a defogger that can threaten Gholdengo; a check to common Stealth Rock setters like Great Tusk, Heatran, and Garchomp; and a deterrent to contact attackers like U-turn users, Kartana, and Mega Lopunny. However, its main weakness lies in its overreliance on its Heavy-Duty Boots—although Tera could let it drop its weakness to Rock, Tera is usually better spent on other Pokemon, so Moltres still fears Knock Off from opponents it would otherwise check, like Iron Valiant, Landorus-T, Kartana, and Mega Scizor. Tera Water is used to ease the matchup against rain, becoming a check to common rain abusers like Basculegion-M, Mega Swampert and Barraskewda and threatening to burn them with Flame Body. Tera Ground instead grants a resistance to Stealth Rock and Stone Edge from Choice Scarf Landorus-T and an immunity to Volt Switch from Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W and Thunderbolt from Iron Valiant. Mystical Fire is chosen over Flamethrower, as its Special Attack drop is useful to more easily check Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Charizard Y, and Gholdengo. Scorching Sands is used to beat Heatran and also deter physical attackers looking to set up due to its high burn chance. Hurricane allows Moltres to OHKO Great Tusk and Mega Lopunny while heavily denting Volcarona and is useful in general as a powerful STAB option, U-turn allows Moltres to function as a pivot, pivoting out on foes like Heatran and Garganacl, and Toxic allows Moltres to punish Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp looking to soak up its STAB options. The given EVs allow Moltres to survive two Frustration from Mega Lopunny without Stealth Rock damage. However, there are still many opponents that can pressure Moltres, like Garganacl, Toxapex, and Tapu Koko. Moltres thus pairs well with wallbreakers that can take advantage of such switch-ins to come in, like Tapu Lele or Iron Valiant. Moltres also dislikes having its Heavy-Duty Boots removed, so teammates that can absorb Knock Off are appreciated, including Mega Scizor and Gliscor.</p>"

After one Nasty Plot boost, it can 2HKO the likes of Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Curse Garganacl, and after one Agility boost, it can outspeed would-be faster Pokemon such as +1 Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and +1 Walking Wake. Tera Blast Fairy lets it OHKO Hoopa-U while also being able to net 2HKOs on Kingambit, Assault Vest Hoopa-U, and Dragonite, all after one Nasty Plot boost. Tera Fairy also maintains its Dark resistance while letting it potentially set up in the face of Dragon-type attacks from foes like Dragapult. Alternatively, Hurricane is a strong neutral STAB move that prevents Galarian Moltres form relying too much on Terastallization to function. Tera Dark boosts Fiery Wrath's power, being able to OHKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowking after a Nasty Plot boost and Stealth Rock damage, as well as being able to 2HKO specially defensive Moltres and Assault Vest Toxapex after a Nasty Plot boost. Tera Flying is only to be used if running Hurricane, which can OHKO Zamazenta without a Nasty Plot boost, as well as non-Assault Vest Azumarill and Enamorus after a Nasty Plot boost. Sitrus Berry lets it set up much more easily, and can potentially let it trigger Berserk twice. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to ignore Stealth Rock. Finally, Weakness Policy is a viable alternative if running dual screens support to take on super effective hits more comfortably. Because of its reliance on setup, Galarian Moltres is best utilized on hyper offense teams. Hence, it appreciates entry hazard support from suicide leads such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Meowscarada so that incoming foes can be worn down for Galarian Moltres to clean. Dual screens from Dragapult lets it setup much more easily, esepcially for Weakness Policy variants. Hazard control is a must when running Galarian Moltres due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, so it appreciates partners such as Great Tusk and Hatterene with their access to Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce. The two of them can also threaten special walls that can hinder a Galarian Moltres sweep, with Great Tusk being able to OHKO Galarian Slowking and 2HKO Ting-Lu, while Hatterene can 2HKO Clodsire. In return, Galarian Moltres can set up on and threaten Zamazenta for Great Tusk and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo as well as special walls like Garganacl prevent Galarian Moltres from performing its sweep. Hence, offensive Zapdos pairs well with Galarian Moltres, being able to 2HKO both of the aforementioned Pokemon, provided Garganacl is Tera Water. Lastly, Galarian Moltres can facilitate sweeps from physically oriented sweepers like Kingambit by removing obstacles like Great Tusk and Gholdengo.</p>"

It provides an important buffer against offensive threats such as Hisuian Zoroark and Alakazam while also finding setup opportunities against a large portion of defensive staples, such as Slowbro and Mega Venusaur. Nasty Plot boosts Galarian Moltres's Special Attack to absurd levels, allowing it to reliably pressure specially defensive tanks such Hippowdon and Clefable. Agility allows Galarian Moltres to outspeed common revenge killers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Keldeo after one round of setup while giving it the opportunity to clean up opposing teams late-game when its wallbreaking prowess with Nasty Plot isn't as necessary. Taunt, on the other hand, can be used to prevent status and healing from Pokemon such as Blissey and specially defensive Hippowdon, allowing Galarian Moltres to wear them down or use them as setup fodder. Hurricane, in conjunction with Flyinium Z, gives Galarian Moltres a powerful one-time nuke in Supersonic Skystrike that can break through neutral targets such as Blissey and Gastrodon, threatening to outright OHKO the latter at +2 while also offsetting Hurricane’s middling accuracy in the process. As Galarian Moltres can struggle to safely find setup opportunities against faster threats such as Mega Aerdocatyl and Enamorus, it pairs best with offensive teammates that can also complement its wallbreaking prowess; late-game cleaners such as Dragon Dance Salamence, Meteor Beam Nihilego, and Booster Energy Iron Moth capitalize on Galarian Moltres's ability to weaken specific answers, such as specially defensive Celesteela and Skeledirge, respectively, allowing them to sweep opposing teams with greater ease late-game. The latter two can also invite in and weaken Rock-types such as both Tyranitar formes and the rare Nihilego, which Galarian Moltres can struggle to break through otherwise. Galarian Moltres's Stealth Rock weakness and inability to run Heavy-Duty Boots necessitates strong anti-hazard options, leads such as Excadrill and Mew can all shut down common entry hazard setters, the former via Rapid Spin and the latter via Taunt.</p>"

Agility allows Galarian Moltres to outpace dangerous revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Choice Scarf Kartana. However, Taunt is also a valuable alternative to Agility in order to shut down defensive checks like Haze Toxapex and Unaware Clodsire while also preventing common status spreaders like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran from limiting its sweep. Heavy-Duty Boots negates chip damage from entry hazards and allows Galarian Moltres to set up more reliably. Flyinium Z is used in order to quickly eliminate bulkier threats such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn without risking a miss due to Hurricane's poor accuracy; however, this leaves Galarian Moltres unable to Terastallize against threats such as Tapu Lele. Sitrus Berry is another option that lets Galarian Moltres maintain its health and trigger Berserk twice. Galarian Moltres is a great user of Terastallization, using Tera Steel to set up on its standard checks in Tapu Lele, Toxapex, Tapu Koko, and Clefable. Tera Steel also lets it resist many forms of priority including, but not limited to, Mega Lopunny's and Mega Medicham's Fake Out, Weavile's Ice Shard, and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. However, Galarian Moltres's new weaknesses mean that it has a harder time setting up on Mega Lopunny, Heatran, and Landorus-T while also being susceptible to other forms of priority like Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Galarian Moltres enjoys dual screens support to let it set up incredibly easily, so Tapu Koko makes for a great partner as both a solid pivot and dual screens setter. Galarian Moltres can struggle against threats such as Mega Diancie, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Mega Tyranitar, so Mega Scizor and Hawlucha make for great partners to handle its checks offensively; in return, Galarian Moltres can break through Pokemon such as Toxapex, Landorus-T, and Gholdengo for them. Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta are also good partners that can check threats like Heatran, Kingambit, and Garganacl for Galarian Moltres. Iron Valiant, in particular, also synergizes well with dual screens Tapu Koko, making it a fantastic cleaner after Galarian Moltres has broken through the opposing team.</p>"

In addition, its part-Flying typing provides Dark teams with a great offensive option against Fighting and Bug teams, as well as a greatly appreciated neutrality to the aforementioned types. After one Nasty Plot boost, Galarian Moltres 2HKOes physically defensive Toxapex, physically defensive Ting-Lu, and Celesteela. After one Agility boost, it is able to outspeed would-be faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, Regieleki, and +1 Volcarona, as well as Mega Swampert in rain. With Flyinium Z , a Nasty Plot-boosted Supersonic Skystrike OHKOes Mega Diancie, Tapu Koko, and specially defensive Toxapex. An unboosted Supersonic Skystrike is still able to OHKO Terrakion after Stealth Rock damage. Hisuian Samurott provides entry hazard support in order to wear down incoming foes into OHKO range for Galarian Moltres, and in return, Galarian Moltres can threaten the Grass- and Fighting-types the two of them struggle with such as Mega Venusaur and Urshifu-R. Grimmsnarl is another great teammate, as it is able to set up dual screens to further make Galarian Moltres difficult to KO, and it can also run Taunt to prevent Stealth Rock from being set. Because of Galarian Moltres's part-Flying-typing, it is vulnerable to Stealth Rock. Because of this vulnerability, it appreciates hazard control from Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce, and Mega Sableye is also able to cripple opposing foes with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off. Choice Band users such as Weavile, Roaring Moon, and Meowscarada can check walls Galarian Moltres struggles with like Dondozo and Clodsire. In return, Meowscarada and Weavile appreciate Galarian Moltres matching up well against Volcarona and Roaring Moon appreciates Galarian Moltres matching up well against Great Tusk. Lastly, Galarian Moltres can be paired with other sweepers such as Swords Dance Weavile and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon to soften each other's checks to enable each other to sweep. For example, Weavile is able to threaten Ting-Lu and Clodsire, while Galarian Moltres is able to handle Choice Scarf Gholdengo in return. When Galarian Moltres is not able to complete an outright sweep, it can set up for Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada and Greninja to clean up.</p>"

Cyclizar's Shed Tail in conjunction with Multiscale grants Dragonite many chances to set up and prevents it from being affected by status effects inflicted by Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Skeledirge. Garchomp sets up entry hazards in the form of Stealth Rock and Spikes, chipping down Dragonite's switch-ins such as Forretress, Kingambit, and Quagsire.

        "Extreme Killernite": {
          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Tera Normal, Dragonite can do its best impression of Arceus, with a powerful Extreme Speed that makes Dragonite a great revenge killer, and even a sweeper if using Dragon Dance!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake offers the best coverage against the widest variety of Normal-type resistances, with Archaludon, Garganacl, and Glimmora being big targets. Just note that some Levitate Pokemon such as Tera Steel Latias and Air Balloon Gholdengo can completely wall Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore can be tricky to fit in on Dragonite, since giving up Roost greatly harms Dragonite's lasting power, and giving up Dragon Dance makes sweeping much more difficult. However, the amount of match-ups it lets Dragonite win against passive Pokemon, and the amount of switch-ins it gives it, make it a worthy move to consider regardless.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: This set benefits immensely from the ability to Terastallize to both boost Extreme Speed's power while also removing Dragon type weaknesses. However, care should be taken on the timing of Terastallization depending on the matchup, as Dragonite more effectively checks several prominent threats, such as Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W, with its base typing.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Fire Punch</strong>: Fire Punch gets around Dragonite's issue with Tera Steel Levitate Pokemon such as Latias, but its pretty weak otherwise.</li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Stealth Rock is commonly set up specifically to break Dragonite's Multiscale, so Heavy-Duty Boots are a good way to always preserve Dragonite's ability to set up and revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet lets Dragonite play more passively against physical threats, which is especially relevant before it Terastallizes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: The residual recovery of Leftovers makes it easier to maintain Multiscale when using Roost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry gives Dragonite a good safety net against common Yawn + Stealth Rock users such as Hippowdon and Swampert, especially when Encore is there to punish Stealth Rock.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish</strong> Going fully defensive means Dragonite won't sweep nearly as easily, but Dragonite is still capable of being an effective defensive Pokemon even after Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 Def / 100 Spe with Impish or 156 HP / 252 Atk / 100 Spe with Adamant</strong>: These EV spreads outspeeds Jolly Ursaluna, who while not common, can seriously threaten to break past Dragonite with Guts boosted Facade.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>52 HP / 252 Atk / 204 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This EV spread is the minimum amount of Speed needed to outspeed Flutter Mane after Dragon Dance, the two Pokemon immune to Extreme Speed. Outspeeding Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao can also be useful since both are known to sometimes use Tera Ghost for Extreme Speed. 236 Speed EVs can be run as well if the rare Dragapult is a serious issue.</p> </li> </ul>"

Since the latter two frequently run Booster Energy for Speed, it is usually more worth it to maximize damage with Adamant.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Low Kick</strong>: Low Kick gives Dragonite the most damage output against Ursaluna-B, which is otherwise strong at stopping Dragonite's momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire Punch</strong>: Fire Punch is an alternative to Earthquake for hitting Steel-types and is ideally run with Tera Fire. While weaker overall, it deals far more damage to Scizor and gives a way to pressure the occasional Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore with Dragon Dance makes it easier to set up on passive foes, but the sacrifice in coverage can make it difficult to fit.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Dragonite's bulk and Multiscale still go a long way in helping it set up, but Terastallization can extend its reach and make it harder to revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a powerful response to Fairy-types like Flutter Mane, resisting Moonblast and boosting Iron Head. The resistance to Normal-type moves is also strong, helping cushion Ursaluna-B and opposing Extreme Speed Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy removes all of Dragonite's previous weaknesses, but its true worth lies in preventing Scale Shot setup from the opponent.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire is a more niche option that can be run with Fire Punch and boasts very useful resistances against Ice- and Fairy-type attacks.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Choice Band makes Dragonite both an effective late-game cleaner and revenge killer with Extreme Speed, and a powerful wall-breaker against foes such as Ursaluna-B, Archaludon, and Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Outrage</strong>: Outrage is strong enough to potentially 2HKO Bold Ursaluna-B and Impish Dondozo after Stealth Rock damage, though it leaves Dragonite very vulnerable to getting revenge killed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head</strong>: While Steel-type coverage isn't incredible, it allows Dragonote to punish Levitate Pokemon that sometimes Terastallize into Fairy-types, like Latias, and it deals massive damage to Flutter Mane even after being hit by Charm.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire Punch</strong>: Fire Punch covers Steel-types that are immune to Ground-type attacks, such as Air Balloon Gholdengo and Tera Steel Latios.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Special Attack IV of 17 or lower</strong>: If using Tera Flying, a Special Attack IV of 17 or lower is needed to prevent Tera Blast from flipping to a Special Attack after being hit by Flutter Mane's Charm.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Aqua Jet</strong>: Aqua Jet works as a secondary priority move to pick off Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, and Gholdengo.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: This Dragonite will usually want to Terastallize to either increase its revenge killing or wall-breaking capabilities, but Choice Band's power doesn't make this strictly necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal massively boosts Dragonite's revenge killing potential with Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: With Tera Blast, Tera Flying is a strong wallbreaking option that lets Dragonite potentially 2HKO bulky Pokemon like defensive Ursaluna-B. It also lets Dragonite demolish offensive Urshifu formes without the need for Outrage.</p> </li> </ul>"
        },
        "Paraflinch": {
          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Paraflinch Dragonite is a defensively oriented Dragonite set that takes full advantage of Terastallization and the element of surprise to cripple and downright defeat numerous Pokemon. Multiscale allows Dragonite to paralyze its foes relatively safely, becoming a massive nuisance for unprepared opponents.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Slash vs. Iron Head</strong>: Air Slash is a more practical move for this set, as it can cover a wider range of Pokemon for at least neutral damage. Air Slash also does not trigger Rocky Helmet and is naturally boosted by Dragonite's STAB. The Iron Head variant of Paraflinch, however, gives Dragonite an easier time against a number of common threats such as Flutter Mane, at the cost of struggling against Gouging Fire before they Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore vs. Substitute</strong>: Encore will allow Dragonite to effectively check a wider variety of Pokemon such as Ursaluna-B by locking them into an unfavorable move, giving it a free opportunity to land Thunder Wave on your opponent's switch-in on the following turn. Substitute, on the other hand, will give Dragonite a much easier time dealing with defensive Pokemon that rely on status infliction such as Porygon2 and Dragon Tail Archaludon.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Waterfall</strong>: Waterfall can be a viable option. However, the move is less reliable for the application of this set, as its chance to flinch is 20% as opposed to Air Slash and Iron Head's 30%. It does deal more damage to common Electric-types like Thundurus-T though.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel is a great defensive type that provides resistance to Fairy-type attacks, such as Moon Blast from Flutter Mane. If using the physical set, Tera Steel also provides a significant boost to the damage of Iron Head.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is Dragonite's best option against opposing Dragon-types, such as Roaring Moon and Gouging Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water provides Dragonite with the much-needed defensive versatility to paralyze and wall common threats, such as Chien-Pao and Azumarill. Water is an excellent defensive type in general with its only weaknesses being Electric and Grass.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV and IV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 236 Def / 28 Spe</strong>: 52 Speed EVs are the minimum Speed requirement to outspeed paralyzed Iron Bundle that lack Booster Energy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 140 Def / 116 Spe</strong>: This is the minimum requirement to outspeed paralyzed Modest Choice Scarf Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>0 Attack IVs</strong>: If using Air Slash, 0 Attack IVs are highly recommended for having a high chance of retaining Substitute against STAB Foul Play users such as Porygon2</p> </li> </ul>"
        },
        "Defensive Dragon Dance": {
          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Dragonite's good bulk gives it plenty of chances to set up Dragon Dance, while still providing a solid defensive backbone.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore makes setting up on slower defensive foes such as Corviknight fairly easy, though the lack of coverage makes Terastallizing far more important.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake is a reliable move for covering Steel-types, and Fire-types like Gouging Fire if using Iron Head and Tera Steel.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Ice Spinner deals massive damage to Landorus-T and other Flying-types, making it a reasonable coverage option to consider if using a Tera type that can deal with Steel-types, like Water or Electric.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High / Almost Required</strong>: This Dragonite lacks a STAB attack without Terastallization, making it highly recommended. If using Tera Flying with Tera Blast as the only attack, this set will need Terastallization to function.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: With Tera Blast, Tera Flying gives Dragonite a solid mono-attacking option and defensive typing in one, at the cost of almost always needing to Terastallize to function.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy gives Dragonite an excellent mono-attacking Tera Blast that gives it an advantage over other Dragon-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel covers Dragonite's former weaknesses very well, and can still work somewhat well even if not Terastallized thanks to Iron Head, though note it makes this Dragonite much more vulnerable to Urshifu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gifts Dragonite a resistance to Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash without being weak to Sacred Sword, plus it pairs well with Waterfall.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Though this requires extra coverage to be viable, Tera Electric gives Dragonite only a single weakness to Ground-type attacks, and has excellent coverage with Ice Spinner.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet lets Dragonite play more passively thanks to the chip damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Preserving Multiscale even when Stealth Rock is set up can help Dragonite survive attacks in emergencies.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's passive healing gives Dragonite a better matchup against passive foes it can Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: With Covert Cloak, Dragonite becomes a very solid check to Garganacl, as well as no longer fearing Breaking Swipe or flinches.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Weakness Policy</strong>: Since Multiscale makes Dragonite very difficult to OHKO, Weakness Policy is a viable option to turn the tables on foes targeting Dragonite's weaknesses.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads And Dragon Dance Speed Tiers</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 188 Defense / 76 Spe with Impish</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds up to Urshifu after one Dragon Dance, and Iron Bundle after two Dragon Dances.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 148 Defense / 108 Speed with Impish</strong>: This spread outspeeds Garchomp and Chi-Yu after Dragon Dance, all of which are threats that can easily revenge kill Dragonite once Multiscale is broken.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 52 Def / 204 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This is the minimum Speed needed to outspeed Timid Iron Bundle after a boost, and it also outspeeds Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul>"
        },
        "Phazer": {
          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Multiscale's incredible bulk potential and Dragon Tail bypassing Taunt, Dragonite is a unique and very effective phazer that massively ups the danger of entry hazards!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Tail VS. Roar</strong>: Dragon Tail is preferred for it disregarding Taunt and providing some good chip damage. However, Roar can phaze out meddlesome Fairy-types and users of Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Teammates</strong>: For this Dragonite to be at its most effective, you'll need some partners to at least set up Stealth Rock. Ting-Lu and Archaludon are particularly bulky examples that pair well, but other options include Landorus-T, Swampert, and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake VS. Iron Head</strong>: Earthquake is the most wide-reaching coverage move, ensuring good damage against Normal resistances like Garganacl and Archaludon. If using Roar, Iron Head prevents Levitate Pokemon from completely walling Dragonite, and its flinch rate synergies well with Thunder Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Dragonite's bulk makes it an ace at spreading paralysis, making it more of a team supporter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute versus Encore</strong>: Substitute is a fantastic option against Pokemon with status moves that threaten Dragonite's phazing cycles, such as Garganacl, Porygon2, and Toxapex. Encore won't do as well against these threats but does punish opposing foes carrying Substitute that can be a problem for Dragon Tail along with slower foes that use status moves in general such as Ting-Lu and Ursaluna-B. Encore can even be used over extra coverage if teammates can deal with Fairy-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Extreme Speed versus Aqua Jet</strong>: Extreme Speed's ability to pick off threats is useful, even on defensive variants of this set. Despite being half as powerful, Aqua Jet is still worth considering for its ability to pick off weakened Flutter Mane, which can be difficult for this set to handle due to its power when Multiscale isn't in play.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Dragonite's defensive typing can be quite helpful against foes like Urshifu-R and Chi-Yu, but some of the huge exploitable weakness to Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane will require Terastallization to cover.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dragon immunity gels well with Dragonite and is a great defensive typing in general against foes like Chien-Pao and Urshifu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is not only an incredible defensive typing that covers much of Dragonite's former weaknesses, but the power boost it provides to Iron Head lets it OHKO all but the most bulky Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water's Ice and Fire resistance makes it a great pick against Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Heatran and is among the best defensive types in general. The boost to Aqua Jet can also be helpful for picking off threats, though it won't be as powerful as Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal isn't that incredible defensively, but it can be worth it for boosting Extreme Speed's power, letting offensive EV spreads 2HKO Chien-Pao with it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a niche option that lets Dragonite absorb Toxic Spikes and gain a Toxic immunity without being weak to Fighting- and Fire-type attacks like Tera Steel is.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is a high value item, but it's worth using on Dragonite if using Substitute, as it gives Dragonite a serious chance of passively gaining Multiscale's effect back.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet allows Dragonite to play more passively, punishing Pokemon that rely on contact moves like Choice Item Urshifu-R and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots' Stealth Rock immunity makes Multiscale more flexible, especially if Dragon Tail brings in a threat Dragonite isn't equipped to handle.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 Def / 180 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread gives up quite a bit of bulk in exchange for outspeeding Adamant Breloom, while still often mantaining a Substitute against Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 124 Atk / 108 Def / 4 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is optimized for use with Earthquake and Aqua Jet, allowing Dragonite to 2HKO 4 Defense Flutter Mane with that combination of moves without needing to Terastallize. Only Modest Tera Fairy Flutter Mane will have a chance to OHKO through Multiscale.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is a far more offensive approach, mainly for use with Extreme Speed to pick off threats more effectively.</p> </li> </ul>"
        },
        "Encore Trapper": {
          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Due to Dragonite's offensive presence and high bulk, many opponents choose to either check it defensively or set up against it to break through Roost + Multiscale. Against either option, Encore can turn Dragonite practically invincible allowing it to reside on the field indefinitely in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire Spin</strong>: This allows Dragonite to defeat almost any Pokemon universally by simply making full use of its longevity. Trapping an Encore locked Pokemon in the field is also highly valuable. Fire Spin is used instead of Wrap because it affects Ghost-types and doesn't trigger chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Iron Head</strong>: Earthquake prevents Dragonite from being entirely passive against Archaludon, Gouging Fire, and Flutter Mane. Meanwhile, Iron Head fits using Tera Steel, and does massive damage to Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draco Meteor</strong>: With a Bold Nature, Draco Meteor is a powerful move that can catch opposing Dragon-types off-guard and deal big damage to Ursaluna-B and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Dragonite's typing does have some fairly exploitable weaknesses that can harm its defensive capability, but an immunity to Toxic Spikes and useful resistances to common attack types such as Ground, Fire, and Fighting mean that Terastallization is not always the right play.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Due to Dragonite’'s low Speed compared to other Dragon-types, Tera Fairy is a great response against them. This also retains its advantage against Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel massively improves Dragonite's matchups against Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, at the cost of being even more vulnerable to Salt Cure and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water adds a resistance to Ice without losing Dragonite's innate Fire-type resistance, which is helpful against Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: The niche Tera Poison gives Dragonite a way to remove its common weaknesses without being vulnerable to Toxic Spikes, while still resisting Fighting unlike Tera Steel.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Heavy-Duty Boots</strong> Generally, Leftovers preserves Dragonite’'s longevity best, as it cancels out the damage from Sandstorm and makes timer stall easier. However, the increased usage of entry hazard setters in response to Dragonite makes Heavy-Duty Boots a strong option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet makes it easier for Dragonite to defeat Pokemon such as opposing Dragonite, Urshifu-R, and Gouging Fire (while Dragonite is Terastallized), and its residual damage can be used to execute a win condition.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: With Covert Cloak, this Dragonite becomes a very effective check to Garganacl, in addition to no longer being vulnerable to flinches from Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash while Terastallizing.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "Double Priority Lure": {
          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Flying-type Tera Blast OHKOing physically frail and Flying-weak Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Ogerpon-H, and Urshifu-R, this set is effective at fooling opponents into thinking that it's Choice Band Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Aqua Jet</strong>: It may seem redundant with Extreme Speed, but Aqua Jet is a key move for picking off weakened Ghost-types, such as Flutter Mane, and surprising Focus Sash Pokemon that might use Tera Ghost to avoid being sniped by Extreme Speed, such as Iron Bundle. This can also work against Chien-Pao, but Icicle Crash's flinch chance makes this rather risky.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Low Kick</strong>: Earthquake is the preferred coverage move for dealing big damage against Archaludon and Gholdengo, common responses to a Dragonite locked into Tera Blast. Low Kick trades smacking Gholdengo for revenge killing opposing Tera Normal Dragonite and dealing massive damage to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is the best nature for needing less chip damage to revenge kill weakened targets with priority attacks, but Jolly can make sense if outspeeding foes like Modest Gholdengo, Adamant Gouging Fire, and the rare Jolly Breloom is appealing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Almost Required</strong>: This set is highly reliant on using Tera Blast as a luring tool, so Terastallization should be a top priority for Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sharp Beak</strong>: Sharp Beak gives Dragonite the most offensive presence with the fewest drawbacks, giving Flying-type Tera Blast just enough of a boost to usually 2HKO Ursaluna-B, or 3HKO defensive variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Assault Vest vastly improves Dragonite's matchup against Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane, especially if Multiscale's protection has been lost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots means Stealth Rock will no longer remove this set's ability to trade blows with powerful threats.</p> </li> </ul>"

Earthquake threatens Rock- and Steel-types like non-Earth Eater Garganacl, Kingambit, and Gholdengo, while Ice Spinner threatens select Electric-types like Sandy Shocks and Zapdos and removes Azelf's Psychic Terrain. Roost provides Dragonite with much-needed longevity, notably allowing it to turn Corviknight into setup fodder. Sharp Beak is an option over Life Orb to ensure that Dragonite does not wear itself down as quickly; alternatively, Heavy-Duty Boots improves its longevity, allowing it to pose a threat multiple times in a game and leverage its typing to act as a passable check to Water- and Fire-types like Barraskewda and Iron Moth. Dragonite's ability to clean late-game is appreciated by wallbreakers that can break open holes in the opposing team earlier in the game, like Volcarona and Chien-Pao. Its ability to act as potent speed control also allows it to make up for teammates that have middling Speed tiers like Ceruledge, Galarian Zapdos, and Choice Specs Walking Wake. Dragonite's tendency to get forced out by Azelf means it requires a partner that can consistently switch into it like Empoleon, RegenVest Manaphy, or Swampert.

      "overview": "<p>Thanks to the sheer power of Tera Normal Extreme Speed, Dragonite is one of DOU’s biggest threats, threatening to KO a large portion of the metagame. Dragonite also has excellent coverage, allowing it to hit any Pokémon that aren't afraid of Extreme Speed, such as Gholdengo and Iron Treads. Dragonite’s Dragon/Flying allows it to take attacks such as Chi-Yu's Heat Wave and Palafin's Jet Punch while also granting it immunity to Earthquakes from Garchomp and Great Tusk. Tera Normal also allows it to survive threatening Dragon- and Ice-type attacks. Inner Focus lets Dragonite avoid Attack drops from Intimidate and flinches from Fake Out. Dragonite is most commonly paired with Chien-Pao, as Sword of Ruin lowers the Defense of foes, allowing Extreme Speed to deal more damage. This pairing is preferred by offensive teams but can fit on other archetypes appreciate Dragonite's power and priority. Due to Dragonite's heavy dependence on Extreme Speed, Pokemon that can block priority moves such as Farigiraf, Tsareena, and Indeedee-F limit its effectiveness. Dragonite also struggles against Pokémon with high physical bulk that can take an Extreme Speed and threaten it in return such as Great Tusk, Iron Hands, Amoonguss, and Garganacl. Additionally, Dragonite is greatly hindered by Stealth Rock, which nullifies Multiscale and limits its longevity.</p>",

Alternatively, Fire Blast allows it to 2HKO Solgaleo and Magearna while still hitting Gholdengo. Focus Blast hits Dark-types such as Kingambit and Arceus-Dark and is needed over Aura Sphere to hit crucial KO ranges, such as 2HKOing Arceus-Dark and OHKOing Chi-Yu. Recover helps to offset Life Orb's recoil while also increasing Mewtwo's longevity, and it gets many opportunities to use this move due to all the switches it forces. Tera Fighting is mandatory to let Mewtwo's Focus Blast OHKO Arceus-Dark and turn its Dark and Bug weaknesses into resistances, which helps against Chi-Yu and Volcarona. Mewtwo appreciates entry hazard control from allies like Giratina and Great Tusk to help its longevity. Mandibuzz, specially defensive Arceus-Dark, and Solgaleo are often solid checks to Mewtwo, meaning Pokemon like Zamazenta-C and Zacian are good partners for it.

Mewtwo's final moveslot is customizable; Shadow Ball targets Giratina, Deoxys, and opposing Mewtwo. Fire Blast gives Mewtwo coverage against Pokemon like Magearna, Solgaleo, and Arceus-Grass. Flamethrower can be opted for instead, trading power for consistency. However, it misses out on some important benchmarks Fire Blast reaches, such as not guaranteeing an OHKO on Solgaleo and Arceus-Grass after a Nasty Plot. Recover can be used to give Mewtwo more chances to sweep throughout a game, at the cost of its coverage. Expert Belt is the preferred item of choice, as it gives Mewtwo a power boost on targets it hits super effectively. Heavy-Duty Boots can be opted for instead, giving Mewtwo an immunity to entry hazards. Tera Steel gives Mewtwo a resistance to Zacian's STAB attacks and also provides it a resistance to Extreme Speed from Arceus formes and Deoxys. Tera Fighting can be opted for instead, boosting Focus Blast and giving a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch as well as Solgaleo's and Great Tusk's Knock Off. Mewtwo fits best on offensive teams looking for a strong wallbreaker. Mewtwo struggles against faster threats like Zacian, Deoxys, and Choice Scarf Kyurem-W that can revenge kill it, so Pokemon that can take these threats on like Toxapex, Solgaleo, and Magearna can be nice to have as teammates.

Maximum HP with Sitrus Berry highlights Azumarill’s naturally exceptional defensive typing, allowing it to serve as a one time check to OU staples such as Dragapult, Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. Belly Drum is an incredibly threatening option that lets Azumarill take advantage of the switches it forces from Pokemon such as Hydreigon to get setup opportunities. It is also a threatening late-game sweeper, as it can outspeed and OHKO defensive walls such as Clodsire, Slowking, and Garganacl while KOing most neutral faster targets such as Gholdengo and Iron Valiant with a +6 Aqua Jet.

Other setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon complement Azumarill, appreciating Azumarill's ability to break Amoonguss and Toxapex and wearing down each other's checks like Dondozo and Skeledirge. Entry hazard support from Pokémon like Glimmora and Garchomp provides the necessary chip damage to turn near OHKOs into true OHKOs on resisted Pokémon such as Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Meowscarada with Tera Water +6 Aqua Jet. Azumarill can pair well with teammates like Grimmsnarl and Orthworm that provide it with more setup opportunities.

        "Choice Band": {

Combine that with Huge Power, priority from Aqua Jet, and the boost to STAB that comes from Tera Water, and Azumarill goes from powerful to extremely threatening for any ill-prepared team. Ice Spinner as coverage is useful to hit Amoonguss and Water Absorb Clodsire, while Superpower is an alternative to deal with Steel-types like Kingambit and Orthworm that would be harder to damage without it. 140 Speed EVs allow Azumarill to outspeed Corviknight and Skeledirge. The remaining 116 EVs in HP increase its survivability. This, along with the incredible defensive typing of Water / Fairy protecting it from the many Dragon-type threats roaming the tier, such as Dragapult and Walking Wake, gives it the opportunity to safely switch into many otherwise frightening Pokemon. Tera Water and Fairy are for powering up the Choce Band-boosted STAB attacks Azumarill uses. Tera Water is preferred to get the extra boost to Aqua Jet, but Tera Fairy can also be used to reduce the continual damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> <p>Choice Band Azumarill is best used on offensive teams and benefits from the support of Pokemon that can open up opportunities for it to break holes. Pokemon like Dragapult and Rotom-W can be excellent teammates by making ample use of pivoting moves throughout a game to let Azumarill in safely. Special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth can be helpful to break through walls like Dondozo that Azumarill would otherwise struggle with. Faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Roaring Moon are useful as speed control to help cover Azumarill's low Speed. Most importantly though, entry hazards help Azumarill wear down tougher foes to be picked off later in the battle, so hazard setters like Great Tusk and Glimmora, as well as spinblockers like Gholdengo, are always appreciated teammates. Defensive Pokemon that have the tools to deal with Azumarill, like Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Dondozo, are the biggest thorns in Azumarill's side. Having another wallbreaker like Dragonite and Tera Electric Iron Valiant on the team can help mitigate some of these issues.</p>"

        "Assault Vest": {
          "description": "<p>Azumarill leverages its good bulk and typing to check key special attackers such as Walking Wake, Hydreigon, and Greninja while maintaining a powerful offensive presence. An Assault Vest offers a noticeable increase to Azumarill's special bulk, letting it check a wider pool of special attackers such as Hisuian Zoroark and Dragapult while also granting it greater flexibility in its attacking options compared to Choice Band. Liquidation and Play Rough serve as Azumarill's primary STAB attacks, possessing fantastic neutral coverage and hitting many threats such as Dragonite, Walking Wake, and Iron Valiant for super effective damage. Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to revenge kill weakened foes such as Great Tusk and Iron Moth. Ice Spinner is a powerful coverage option, 2HKOing many of Azumarill's common switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Water Absorb Clodsire. Ice Spinner's ability to remove Terrain also makes it particularly useful against opposing Psychic Terrain teams. Tera Water increases the power of Azumarill's Water-type STAB moves, letting it pick off foes such as Iron Moth from higher ranges with Aqua Jet and allowing its Liquidation to 2HKO Hatterene and OHKO offensive Great Tusk. However, Tera Water does come with noticable drawbacks, namely removing Azumarill's immunity to Dragon-type moves and resistances to Fighting- and Dark-type moves, which can make it a shakier check to Walking Wake and Greninja.</p> <p>Assault Vest Azumarill's talents will best be used by more offensive teams looking for a temporary answer to the aforementioned special threats. Partners at risk of being revenge killed by Walking Wake and Iron Valiant, such as Great Tusk and Hydreigon, will greatly appreciate Azumarill's ability to act as a buffer against these Pokemon. Despite Azumarill's good bulk, its tanking prowess can often be undermined by its vulnerability to passive damage from entry hazards and Rocky Helmet. Great Tusk is therefore an excellent partner, providing Rapid Spin support and being able to lure and remove Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Corviknight with Knock Off. Meowscarada is also an excellent ally, being able to shut down opposing entry hazard setters with Taunt while also providing Knock Off support. Furthermore, both Great Tusk and Meowscarada can support Azumarill by laying down entry hazards, which it will greatly appreciate given its ability to force switches. Ting-Lu can similarly lay down multiple layers of entry hazards and ease pressure exerted onto Azumarill in dealing with threats such as Dragapult and Iron Moth. Teammates that can bring Azumarill in safely with a pivoting move, such as Cinderace and Dragapult, are also recommended. Cinderace can assist Azumarill in dealing with entry hazards via Court Change, while Dragapult can deal with Orthworm, which may sometimes use Azumarill as an entry point to pass Shed Tail. In return, Azumarill can check key Pokemon such as Greninja that would threaten them. Azumarill greatly struggles against bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Water Garganacl. Hydreigon can exploit both Toxapex and Garganacl's passivity to set up with Substitute and Nasty Plot, though it must be wary of switching in against Toxic and Salt Cure. Breloom can pressure Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl with Bullet Seed, while Covert Cloak Gholdengo matches up quite nicely against Garganacl and opposing Breloom and can pivot into Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Azumarill is Fairy's premier setup sweeper with immense damage output thanks to Huge Power alongside Belly Drum, which allows Azumarill to handle threats to the type such as Glimmora and Iron Treads. Aqua Jet patches up its below-average Speed tier and threatens faster threats like Iron Moth, Sandy Shocks, and Flutter Mane. Aqua Jet can also sweep late-game, especially against types that lack Water-resistant Pokemon like Steel. Play Rough breaks through sturdier threats that are not OHKOed by Aqua Jet like Hydreigon and Iron Hands. It also threatens opposing Dragon-types like Roaring Moon and Dragalge. Liquidation can be used over Play Rough to OHKO Pokemon like Corviknight, Unaware Clodsire, and Bronzong after Belly Drum. Ice Spinner specifically hits Water Absorb Clodsire and Amoonguss for super effective damage. Body Slam is also another option to significantly threaten Toxapex at +6 Attack while still being able to target the aforementioned Clodsire and Amoonguss for neutral damage. Trailblaze can be used to always beat Quagsire as well. 4 HP EVs are given to make Azumarill's HP an even number so when it activates Belly Drum from full HP, it can activate its Sitrus Berry immediately.</p> <p>One of Azumarill's best partners on Fairy teams is Klefki. Klefki sets up dual screens, which leads to Azumarill having an easier time setting up and sweeping. Klefki also sets Spikes for Azumarill, allowing Azumarill to secure KOs easier after a Belly Drum, particularly against Amoonguss and Toxapex after one layer of Spikes. Klefki also hinders Azumarill's offensive checks like Breloom with Thunder Wave. In return, Azumarill threatens opposing Fire- and Ground-types that threaten Klefki like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Azumarill forms a potent offensive core with Flutter Mane, which threatens the physical walls that may impede Azumarill's sweep like Unaware Quagsire and Toxapex, while Azumarill handles special walls like specially defensive Ting-Lu, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Blissey. Azumarill also appreciates Iron Valiant as an offensive partner, as special sets can answer physical walls like Dondozo and hinder Azumarill's checks like Toxapex by using Trick, and—like with Flutter Mane—Azumarill can deal considerable damage to threats like Clodsire and Gholdengo. Magic Bounce Hatterene also assists Azumarill, as it bounces back entry hazards—particularly Toxic Spikes—which limits Azumarill's sweeping capabilities. Hatterene also has a strong matchup into Ground, Poison, and Water teams; Azumarill appreciates the latter two, since Hatterene is able to threaten Pokemon like Amoonguss and Toxapex.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Azumarill's presence is greatly appreciated on Fairy teams, where it tends to be the Z-Crystal user of choice and a good answer to the Fire, Ground, Rock, Poison and Steel matchups. Z-Belly Drum guarantees a +6 boost to Azumarill's already impressive Attack, turning it into a redoubtable setup sweeper with access to priority, and it can even offer a second setup opportunity if Azumarill gets forced out with its Z-Move unused. Aqua Jet is Azumarill's answer to threats that outspeed it, such as Volcarona, Tapu Koko, and Nidoking. Aside from dealing with Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Slowbro, and Sinistcha, Knock Off is Azumarill's best coverage option against walls that resist its other attacks, such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex and Water Absorb Clodsire. Breakneck Blitz coming off Return beats Mega Venusaur as well as Icium Z Toxapex, which doesn't fear Knock Off. Alternatively, Liquidation could be used as a stronger STAB option for slower foes like Iron Hands, Ting-Lu, and Celesteela, which is important if a Jolly nature is used. Ice Spinner is an alternative that can be used to defeat both Ting-Lu and Mega Venusaur after some chip, along with getting rid of Psychic Terrain to allow for Aqua Jet to be used without being blocked. Klefki is an amazing partner for Azumarill, offering a Poison immunity and dual screens support to ease setup and spreading Spikes to chip the opposing team. Mega Diancie helps in the Fire and Flying matchups and provides entry hazard control, contributing to keeping Azumarill healthy as well as providing Stealth Rock to help its wallbreaking. Tapu Koko deals with Water-types such as Pelipper and Toxapex, making Azumarill's sweep easier down the line, and it also handles Steel- and Flying-types like Celesteela and Corviknight should Azumarill opt for Return. Tapu Bulu also aids in the Water and Electric matchup, handling foes like Quagsire and Rotom-W that Azumarill can struggle to bring down. Iron Valiant deals with most Fighting-types and, when paired with Tapu Koko, outspeeds and defeats faster foes such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Swampert under rain, but it competes with Azumarill for a Z-Crystal. Tapu Lele handles Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Clodsire, but be cautious of Psychic Terrain preventing Azumarill from using Aqua Jet. Babiri Berry Clefable can be used as an alternative to Tapu Lele for checking Scizor, and it also handles Mega Venusaur well, as it can use it as setup fodder.</p>"

Earthquake allows Quagsire to threaten Aegislash more immediately and break Iron Hands' Substitutes, while Scald can be utilized to cripple wallbreakers such as Galarian Zapdos and punish switch-ins immune to Earthquake and Toxic such as Celesteela and Skarmory. Given the lack of reliable Spikers, Quagsire prefers to run Spikes to pressure the opposing team, but it can also run Stealth Rock effectively if the team lacks a Stealth Rock setter. Toxic wears down the bulky Pokemon Quagsire is often tasked with answering, like Iron Hands, and can also punish common Quagsire switch-ins such as Rotom-W and Tangrowth. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Quagsire to more easily answer its main targets, but an alternative spread with 84 Special Defense EVs can be utilized on teams with other answers to physical attackers to allow Quagsire to more reliably switch into Rotom-W, especially if Quagsire's Leftovers has been removed by Knock Off. Due to its passivity, Quagsire is typically seen on bulkier teams that appreciate its defensive profile and ability to set entry hazards. Quagsire is threatened heavily by Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Hydrapple, so answers to these Pokemon, such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Hisuian Goodra, are mandatory. Skarmory can also form a hazard-stacking core alongside Quagsire, and in return, Quagsire can check threats like Victini and Zeraora. Quagsire is unable to handle special attackers and sweepers, such as Latios and Enamorus, so options like Chansey and Clefable are appreciated to help switch into these threats.</p>"

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Umbreon has a myriad of utility options at its disposal, including being able to set up with Calm Mind. Unfortunately, due to Umbreon's terrible Special Attack, a Calm Mind set typically requires too many boosts to be effective. Umbreon can fit two utility moves if it chooses to use Moonlight instead of Wish and Protect, but the limited PP can become a detriment in longer games. Umbreon can beat setup sweepers that typically take advantage of it, such as Quiver Dance Oricorio and Calm Mind Vaporeon, with Tera Ghost and Curse. Umbreon can also use Taunt and a few extra Speed EVs to stop setup sweepers like Sandaconda and Vaporeon or other support Pokemon like Vespiquen and Muk from using their own status moves. Lastly, Umbreon can trap an unsuspecting foe with Mean Look and wear it down with Foul Play or even drop its stats with Tickle to more easily take it out.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: NU has a plethora of Fighting-types, such as Crabominable, Medicham, and Sneasel-Hisui. Umbreon can Terastallize to reverse this weakness, but that always comes with a new set of weaknesses and removes the option to Terastallize later. Other Pokemon like Scyther and Zangoose have a powerful Close Combat that can threaten Umbreon as well.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Utility Moves</strong>: Regardless of Synchronize, a poisoned Umbreon, whether by Toxic or Toxic Spikes, is extremely impaired and struggles to fulfill its role. Trick from a Choice Scarf Haunter or Rotom can completely ruin Umbreon despite it being a suitable check to them otherwise. Taunt from Pokemon like Bombirdier, Qwilfish, and opposing Umbreon can limit Umbreon to only an exploitable Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Special Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers that don't mind Foul Play, mainly special attackers like Oricorio, Vivillon, and a Terastallized Farigiraf can easily boost against Umbreon.</p>",

While Pokemon like Tera Ground Oricorio and Coil Eelektross are immune to Thunder Wave, Yawn can shut down their setup attempts nicely. Synchronize can deter or punish careless status moves used by the likes of Dudunsparce and Drifblim. Umbreon prefers a Poison or Fairy Tera type to turn the tables on Fighting-types and take U-turn better. Tera Poison also provides a Fairy resistance and an immunity to Toxic and Toxic Spikes from common users like Muk, Qwilfish, and Vespiquen.</p> <p>Umbreon appreciates Drifblim and Qwilfish for their Fighting resistance. Drifblim can remove entry hazards and take advantage of Umbreon's status moves with Hex, while Qwilfish can consistently punish Fighting-type moves and U-turn from Pokemon like Passimian and Scyther with Poison Point and Rocky Helmet.

Scald allows Slowking to punish switch-ins like Mega Tyranitar, Ting-Lu, and Tangrowth. Future Sight synergizes well with Teleport by threatening Pokemon like Buzzwole, Mega Venusaur, and Toxapex while aiding wallbreakers like Scizor, Thundurus-T, and Bisharp by giving a free entry with Teleport to better pressure the opposing walls in conjunction with Future Sight. The extra damage provided is useful even against neutral or resistant targets like Gastrodon and Celesteela. Thunder Wave cripples faster targets like Mega Latias, Hydreigon and Enamorus. Teleport is preferred over Chilly Reception due to its negative priority, but the latter can be useful to disrupt sand from Mega Tyranitar and Hippowdon to prevent Excadrill from activating Sand Rush. A Sassy nature with 0 Speed IVs is used to ensure Slowking is as slow as possible to possibly switch out after an opposing Teleport user like Slowbro. Heavy-Duty Boots blocks damage from entry hazards, notably allowing Slowking to better check Choice Specs Enamorus and Latios while maximizing recovery from Regenerator. Slowking fits best on balance and bulky offense teams where its defensive and support capabilities are appreciated by both defensive and offensive partners. Ground-types like Hippowdon, Ting-Lu, and Excadrill can block Volt Switch from Thundurus-T and Zeraora; in return, Slowking can check Water-types like Keldeo and Volcanion. Fighting-types are also amazing partners by pressuring Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar and Hydreigon for Slowking while enjoying Future Sight discouraging common switch-ins like Toxapex, Mega Venusaur, and Clefable. Mega Tyranitar deserves a special mention, as it usually tries to switch in and Pursuit trap Slowking. Good partners to deal with Dark-types include Iron Hands, Buzzwole, and Galarian Zapdos. Choice Specs Latios and Enamorus can put heavy pressure on Slowking with repeated Draco Meteors and Moonblasts respectively, making secondary checks like Celesteela and Scizor useful to help with these threats while Slowking scouts dangerous moves like Mystical Fire for them. Finally, frail offensive Pokemon like Thundurus-T, Victini, and Latios enjoy the free entry Slowking provides with Teleport or Chilly Reception. Thundurus-T is especially notable by threatening most Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar and Hydreigon with Focus Blast or All-Out Pummeling.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its solid special bulk and excellent longevity between Slack Off and Regenerator, Slowking establishes itself as a passable pivot in the metagame. It can switch into foes like Tornadus-T and non-Toxic Heatran, and it can even scout for Choice Specs users such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Lele. Future Sight + Teleport or Chilly Reception lets Slowking support its frail offensive teammates such as Mega Lopunny and Dragapult, giving them safe switch ins and amplifying their wallbreaking prowess afterwards. Teleport is a much more reliable way of pivoting, as its higher PP makes it more valuable in longer games and it provides Slowking's teammates with a safe switch in against Ferrothorn and other Teleport users like Blissey and Slowbro. Alternatively, Chilly Reception's snow helps disrupt weather teams like sun and rain as well as support Ice-type teammates like Kyurem and Weavile with its Defense boost. Tera Fairy improves Slowking's matchup against Dragapult and Tapu Koko and maintains its Fighting resistance against Mega Lopunny, while Tera Dark lets it better stomach Ghost-type attacks from Gholdengo and Dragapult at the cost of being weaker against Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. Both Tera choices importantly prevent Slowking from being Pursuit trapped by Kingambit, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar. Wallbreakers like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, Great Tusk, and Kingambit appreciate Slowking's slow pivoting, with the looming Future Sight pressuring their switch-ins like Toxapex, Buzzwole, and defensive Great Tusk. Moreover, Slowking switches into their revenge killers, notably Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Ting-Lu, and Tangrowth cover foes like Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Kartana, respectively; Ferrothorn and Tangrowth also deal with rain wallbreakers like Mega Swampert and Barraskewda that would otherwise overwhelm Slowking despite its Water resistance, with the latter in particular forming a Regnerator core with Slowking.</p>"

Future Sight allows Galarian Slowking to pressure a number of offensive threats like Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta and do significant damage to defensive foes like Toxapex and Clodsire. Chilly Reception alongside minimum Speed investment allows Galarian Slowking to serve as the metagame's slowest pivot, able to safely bring in offensive teammates safely while changing the weather to snow, which disrupts weather archetypes like rain and sun. Galarian Slowking has a number of options for its last move: Thunder Wave allows it to cripple fast offensive threats like Dragapult and Weavile while preventing Kingambit from freely switching into Galarian Slowking, Toxic wears down opposing walls like Ting-Lu and Dondozo as well as Thunder Wave-immune targets like Raging Bolt, and Slack Off offers immediate recovery, allowing Galarian Slowking to stay on the field longer. Tera Water lets Galarian Slowking stand up to powerful Fire-types like Gouging Fire and Cinderace as well as offensive Water-types like Walking Wake, while Tera Fairy gives it an immunity to strong Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Walking Wake, Raging Bolt, and Kyurem. Tera Dark is another option that turns Galarian Slowking's Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses into resistances, making it more resilient against foes like Greninja and Dragapult. 16 Defense EVs allow Galarian Slowking to live a Knock Off from Meowscarada.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking is an excellent choice for a pivot on balance teams, as frail offensive teammates like Kyurem and Iron Valiant appreciate being brought in safely as well as the pressure applied by Future Sight. Kyurem in particular enjoys the Defense boost from snow, allowing it to stomach attacks from foes like Zamazenta and Kingambit more easily. Due to its average Defense, Galarian Slowking benefits from physically defensive partners like Archaludon and Skarmory to form a solid defensive core. Galarian Slowking struggles against special walls like Ting-Lu and Skeledirge if not running Toxic, so physically offensive teammates like Weavile and Hisuian Samurott that can take care of them make good partners. Additionally, Galarian Slowking is walled by Steel-types like Corviknight and Heatran, so teammates like Volcarona and Great Tusk that can remove them are necessary. Ground-immune teammates like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Corviknight are also good partners for Galarian Slowking due to its weakness to common threats like Great Tusk and opposing Gliscor.</p>"

Sludge Bomb lets it deal with Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele while also letting it fish for poison on Pokemon like Zapdos and Moltres. Chilly Reception lets Galarian Slowking mess with weather like rain and sun while also letting it pivot around offensive Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Koko, and Iron Valiant. Thunder Wave lets Galarian Slowking cripple Pokemon who would use it as setup fodder such as Volcarona and Tornadus-T. Ice Beam lets Galarian Slowking significantly dent Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor, while Flamethrower can let it hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor in a pinch. Slack Off gives Galarian Slowking reliable recovery to handle the aforementioned threats long-term. Tera Steel lets Galarian Slowking handle Tapu Lele even better and let it pivot out into a teammate or damage them with either Flamethrower or Sludge Bomb, respectively. 0 Speed IVs let it pivot out last against slower Pokemon like Ferrothorn. More physically defensive sets can be used as well, but even with Galarian Slowking's great special bulk, it cannot sponge special attacks as well as specially defensive. Tera Water lets it take a Fire Blast from Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona and Thunder Wave in return, or pivot out on them as well. Galarian Slowking is very vulnerable to Pursuit trappers like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile, so teammates that can handle them such as Ting-Lu and Mega Scizor are well appreciated.

Ice Beam lets it immediately threaten switch-ins like Gliscor, but leaves it vulnerable to Heatran. Earthquake can be used to hit Heatran, but using it does come at the cost of not having the utility of a move like Scald. 248 HP EVs optimize Regenerator recovery, and in tandem with 224 Special Defense EVs, it lives 2 Fire Blasts from Mega Charizard Y after Stealth Rock. Tera Steel and Tera Water improve matchups against Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y, respectively. Both types also give it a Pursuit neutrality, leaving it less vulnerable against Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile. Galarian Slowking appreciates Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off to preserve its Assault Vest, so Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Gliscor make for good teammates. The latter forms a good core with Galarian Slowking, punishing and gaining information on passive and offensive Pokemon throughout a game due to the duo's prolonged longevity. Entry hazard removal helps Galarian Slowking not be ruined by Spikes, so Defoggers like Moltres and Zapdos help it not be chipped as much.</p>"

It has a very strong type for this tier, with very few Pokemon able to hit it for super effective damage. It is also the best Rapid Spin blocker in PU because of this. Will-O-Wisp is great for crippling physical attackers like Lycanroc-N, Gabite, and Alolan Dugtrio. Choosing to run Thunder Wave over Will-O-Wisp can make dealing with Alolan Dugtrio and Gabite more difficult. With Misdreavus able to spread status so well, Hex is the best choice for its STAB move. Power Gem is quad effective against Articuno, Masquerain, and Charizard; it also hits other popular Pokemon like Houndoom, Pyroar, and Rotom-F for super effective damage. Thunderbolt can be opted for instead to better hit Water-types like Golduck, Lumineon, Basculin, and Quaxwell. Taunt is also an option over the two attacking moves to disallow setup sweepers such as Gogoat and Carbink from boosting in front of Misdreavus; it also works well at stopping entry hazard setters such as Carbink, Gabite, and Camerupt. The EV spread allows for better recovery with Pain Split by keeping Misdreavus's HP a bit lower than if 252 HP EVs were used while still keeping its overall bulk by adding the EVs taken from HP into both defensive stats. 56 Speed EVs let it out speed neutral natured Honchkrow and Flapple, as well as Timid Glimmet and uninvested Drakloak. Tera Fighting and Tera Fairy both work well to provide a resistance to Dark-type moves from Pokemon like Honchkrow and Alolan Persian. Although, Tera Fighting leaves Misdreavus vulnerable to Flying-type moves from Articuno, Charizard, and Masquerain and Psychic-type moves from Rabsca and Indeedee-F. On the other hand, Tera Fairy leaves it vulnerable to Steel-type moves from Perrserker and Alolan Dugtrio. Tera Electric is great for boosting Thunderbolt and giving Misdreavus zero weaknesses with its ability. Tera Rock boosts Power Gem, letting it OHKO Charizard and Masquerain.</p> <p>Misdreavus works well on balance teams looking for a catch-all defensive Pokemon to deal with many of the metagame's top threats. It also works great on entry hazard stacking teams since it is not bothered by the top Rapid Spin user, Quaxwell. Misdreavus thrives when given teammates like Carbink, Dachsbun, and Tinkatuff to deal with Dark-types such as Alolan Persian, Houndoom, and Skuntank. These same Dark-type threats, Alolan Persian, Houndoom, and Skuntank, can help deal with Ghost-type foes like Banette, Drakloak, and opposing Misdreavus. Specially defensive walls like Articuno, Carbink, and Tinkatuff form a nice core with Misdreavus since it can cover physical Pokemon that give them trouble, like Lycanroc-N, Perrserker, and Alolan Dugtrio. Knock Off absorbers and status absorbers are highly recommended to keep Misdreavus healthy enough to deal with all of these Pokemon. Status absorbers are the likes of RestTalk Gabite, Dragonair, and Zangoose, while Knock Off absorbers are usually Dark-types like Alolan Persian and Skuntank.</p>"

Calm Mind can be used with Draining Kiss and Tera Fairy to turn Misdreavus into a bulky wallbreaker that is difficult to wear down due to Misdreavus's great natural bulk, HP recovery from Draining Kiss, and immediate access to status moves. Tera Fairy is notable for preventing threats like Nasty Plot Alolan Persian from immediately threatening it, and its toolset lends it easy setup opportunities against Gabite, one of the best phazers in the metagame, as well as other passive targets like Dachsbun and Carbink. Alternatively, Nasty Plot can be used along with either Draining Kiss or Power Gem to make Misdreavus more immediately threatening, with Power Gem primarily targeting Fire-types like Pyroar and Houndoom that it would otherwise struggle with as well as specially defensive Articuno. Hex benefits greatly from Misdreavus's ability to spread status and can be amplified with additional status spreaders on the team; alternatively, Shadow Ball can be used on Nasty Plot sets for greater immediate damage output. Will-O-Wisp is useful for preventing targets like Skuntank and Honchkrow from revenge killing it before Terastallization as well as increasing its ability to take hits from Quaxwell. Thunder Wave is another option that cripples special walls like Articuno and opposing setup sweepers like Masquerain. Substitute can also be used as the last move to facilitate setup on forced switches and prevent Skuntank and Rotom-F from crippling it with Toxic or Trick, but it usually gets more value from spreading status. An alternative EV spread of 128 HP / 128 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature can be used on Calm Mind variants for easier setup and more reliable spinblocking.</p> <p>Misdreavus's effectiveness at spinblocking naturally makes it a great fit on entry hazard stacking teams alongside setters like Whiscash, Carbink, and Masquerain as well as strong wallbreakers like Basculin and Rotom-F. Ground-types like Whiscash and Gabite can reliably switch into offensive checks like Alolan Dugtrio and Houndoom as well as Pokemon that may cripple Misdreavus with Thunder Wave or Encore, such as Tinkatuff and Raichu. Carbink can reliably switch into and deal with Dark-types like Houndoom and Alolan Persian that Nasty Plot variants in particular struggle with greatly before Terastallization, and it can also absorb Knock Off. Gogoat can form an effective bulky setup core with Misdreavus, as they deal with each other's checks, like Basculin and Gabite, respectively, and they pressure mutual targets like Articuno and Carbink better together. Thunder Wave users like Alolan Persian and Tinkatuff can facilitate sweeping for Misdreavus by powering up its Hex; the former can also bring it in safely with Parting Shot and ease the pressure of handling Perrserker, and the latter can create setup opportunities with Encore. In addition, both of these can situationally switch into Knock Off from Pokemon like Banette and opposing Tinkatuff.</p>"

While Mega Steelix's mixed bulk is good, it relies heavily on Assault Vest to check things and is often unable to wall anything long-term; as such, teammates like defensive Arceus formes are recommended to help check foes like Mega Diancie and Palkia-O. A major issue with Mega Steelix is Imposter, as its move selection is very annoying to Imposter-proof, and in slower games where Eviolite is less necessary, Imposter users can use it as a relatively safe source of Regenerator recovery. Fur Coat Arceus-Poison is the most effective all-around Imposter-proof, but Jungle Healing users and Steel-types like Celesteela can also work.</p>"

Psychic Fangs allows Snubbull to hit Poison-types like Gastly and Foongus that otherwise wall it. Thunder Wave is a useful tool to hinder opponents, potentially giving Snubbull and its teammates free turns. Thief is a good option for Snubbull in the case that it loses its Eviolite, which happens in nearly every game due to its defensive profile. Earthquake is an option over Thief to hit Steel-types like Pawniard and Tinkatink, as well as OHKOing Hisuian Growlithe. Temper Flare is worth mentioning as well, as it lets Snubbull hit Steel-types and Foongus in one moveslot. The given EV spread allows Snubbull to effectively check the physical attackers it is tasked with taking on while ensuring it still has good power behind its attacks. Snubbull can Terastallize into the Steel typing to cover its weaknesses to Poison- and Steel-type attacks, additionally letting it both resist Vullaby's Brave Bird if Snubbull gets weakened enough for Brave Bird to otherwise KO and survive Snivy's Leaf Storm if it needs to. However, this has the disadvantage of making Snubbull weak to Mienfoo's High Jump Kick, as well as other powerful moves like Mudbray and Trapinch's Earthquake and Hisuian Growlithe's Flare Blitz.</p> <p>Beneficiaries of Snubbull include Stunky, which struggles into the Fighting-types that Snubbull can easily switch into. Mienfoo enjoys Snubbull checking Vullaby, as Vullaby can come in on all of Mienfoo's attacks and threaten teams with its powerful Brave Bird and Knock Off. Snubbull is a decent partner for Pawniard, as Snubbull can switch into Mienfoo's High Jump Kick for Pawniard. Slow, strong Pokemon like Mudbray and Timburr appreciate Snubbull using Thunder Wave to slow down opposing Pokemon. Snubbull itself is threatened by Poison-types such as Foongus and Gastly, with Foongus being able to tank more than one Psychic Fangs and threaten Snubbull with either Sludge Bomb or Spore, while Gastly can threaten an OHKO with Sludge Bomb. Gothita can cover Foongus by trapping it with Shadow Tag, while Stunky can handle Gastly with its natural typing and Knock Off but should be wary of Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

Qwilfish can wear down the opposition with its combination of Spikes and Toxic and even prevent Defog and recovery moves with Taunt. Waterfall is used over Liquidation to potentially cause flinching, which works wonders in conjunction with Toxic, although Surf can be used for a 2HKO on Sandaconda and more damage on other physically bulky Pokemon like Drifblim and Klawf. Despite Intimidate being such a high-value ability, Qwilfish typically prefers Poison Point to punish U-turn from the likes of Passimian and Scyther while not activating Passimian's Defiant in the process. Protect can be used with Leftovers for some extra recovery and also to scout moves from Choice item users like Rotom, Bruxish, and Zoroark. Upon scouting these Pokemon, Qwilfish can invert its weakness to Electric- or Psychic-type moves with a timely Terastallization to a respective Ground or Dark typing, letting it spread more poison and set more Spikes. Umbreon is a great defensive partner, sponging general special attacks while boasting an immunity to Psychic. In return, Qwilfish heavily punishes Fighting-type attacks and U-turn, while also resisting Fairy. Phasers like Dragon Tail Dudunsparce and Eelektross make great use of the Spikes Qwilfish sets up, racking up damage for a faster Pokemon to more easily sweep. Choice Scarf Passimian takes advantage of hazard damage while also punishing Defog with its Defiant ability.</p>"

Intimidate is useful to weaken physical attackers, allowing it to tank strong neutral attacks from the likes of Ursaring and Tauros. Hisuian Qwilfish can also make use of Poison Point to punish contact moves, even generally commitment-free moves like Scyther's and Mesprit's U-turn. Barb Barrage is preferred over stronger options like Poison Jab and Gunk Shot thanks to its high chance to poison, as well as dealing double damage to a poisoned target. Taunt dismantles setup sweepers such as Eelektross while also preventing Defog. Haze is an option over Taunt to prevent setup sweepers like Tera Steel Mesprit and Eelektross from exploiting Hisuian Qwilfish's passivity. Toxic can also be run over Taunt to take advantage of Defog users removing your Spikes and cripple opposing walls like Appletun, Articuno, and Eelektross. Crunch is an extra STAB option that beats Ghost- and Psychic-types like Froslass, Rotom, and Bruxish. Alternatively, Crunch punishes teams that have no grounded Poison-type or entry hazard control. Tera Grass enables Hisuian Qwilfish to set more Spikes against Sandaconda and gives Hisuian Qwilfish a resistance to Volt Switch, allowing it to more easily beat Rotom and Eelektross. Alternatively, Tera Ghost lets it spinblock Cryogonal and Avalugg. 56 Speed EVs allow Hisuian Qwilfish to outspeed maximum Speed Cacturne as well as neutral-nature Abomasnow and Farigiraf; Jolly allows Hisuian Qwilfish to always outspeed the latter two.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Tauros and Mesprit benefit from Spikes weakening checks like Sandaconda and Hisuian Qwilfish that are somewhat easy to put in 2HKO range. To maximize the effect of Spikes and keep them up as long as possible, Hisuian Qwilfish appreciates help from Rotom, Cryogonal, and Articuno, which all put pressure onto Defog users like Braviary and Lurantis. Without Terastallizing, Hisuian Qwilfish folds to Sandaconda and other strong physical attackers that can switch into it like Toxicroak, Hisuian Sneasel, and both Tauros formes. To help solve this issue, Pokemon such as your own Sandaconda, Hattrem, and Drifblim can pivot into their attacks and threaten them with paralysis or burn. Hisuian Qwilfish is hindered by losing its Eviolite via Knock Off or Trick; pair it with Pokemon that can afford to lose their item such as Sandaconda, Sableye, and Sticky Hold Muk.</p>"

Even outside of rain, it's still a good option for late-game sweeping because its coverage and Eviolite-boosted bulk give it good leverage against most countermeasures the opponent could have. The major selling point to this set is Liquidation, as it always OHKOes Sandaconda after Hisuian Qwilfish uses Swords Dance and Terastallizes.</p> <p>If you're using Hisuian Qwilfish on a rain team, pairing it with rain setters like Sableye, Electrode, and Whiscash is a must. Additionally, you'll want Floatzel, which is great at weakening potential checks like Tera Water Sandaconda, Qwilfish, and Avalugg. Golduck is also a staple of NU rain teams and benefits from Hisuian Qwilfish weakening Toxicroak. If you're not using a rain team, simply pair Hisuian Qwilfish with wallbreakers like Medicham, Hisuian Sneasel, and Bruxish.

          "description": "<p>Accounting for its diverse movepool, priority options, and huge base Attack, Scizor makes for an incredibly threatening wallbreaker and cleaner on more offensive teams. Furthermore, Scizor's Steel typing and decent bulk also complements its ability to keep many faster threats in check, such as Enamorus, Mega Latias, and Alakazam, while using them as setup fodder. Knock Off allows Scizor to break past Slowbro and Skeledirge while also OHKOing Victini; it can even prove useful for removing items from several soft checks otherwise reliant on them, such as Leftovers from Rotom-W and Iron Hands. Dual Wingbeat is usually preferred in the last slot for its coverage against specific physical walls able to blank its other attacks, such as Buzzwole, Mega Venusaur, and Tangrowth, but Close Combat can be used instead to deal more damage to Steel-types such as Skarmory, Magnezone, and Bisharp, putting immense pressure on the former at +2 while OHKOing the latter two unboosted. Quick Attack can also be used to give Scizor an extra priority attack, allowing it to finish off weakened foes that would otherwise resist Bullet Punch, such as Iron Moth and Zeraora, although its lack of coverage can leave Scizor to struggle with breaking through the aforementioned defensive targets. Due to its lack of longevity and early- or mid-game prowess, this Scizor set usually fits best on select offensive teams that appreciate its versatility in being able to deal with faster threats. Entry hazard support from the likes of Excadrill and Lead Mew can help push several Pokemon, such as Iron Moth, Tyranitar, and Tapu Fini, into Scizor's KO threshold. Scizor also appreciates specific teammates that can help weaken or take advantage of Fire- and Steel-types, such as Iron Hands and Meteor Beam Nihilego, as it can often be dissuaded from sweeping by their presences in a vacuum while they remain healthy. Conversely, other late-game cleaners such as Swords Dance Bisharp, Z-Celebrate Victini, and Dragon Dance Mega Aerodactyl appreciate Scizor's own ability to force damage onto shared checks such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Choice Scarf Keldeo while allowing Scizor to forgo its late-game approach if attacking early may be more optimal for enabling the rest of its teammates.</p>"

        "Bulky Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Scizor's excellent defensive typing, longevity with Roost, and priority in Bullet Punch can let it serve as an excellent bulky attacker, allowing it to reliably check Pokemon such as Alakazam and Mega Latias throughout a game while retaining its ability to sweep with Swords Dance once opposing walls are appropriately weakened. U-turn allows Scizor to provide pivoting support for its teammates on a forced switch, and in conjunction with Buginium Z, it even gives Scizor access to a one-time nuke that prevents it from switching out, allowing it to KO the likes of Amoonguss and Mandibuzz at +2 after slight chip damage. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to remove important items from the likes of Rotom-W, Celesteela, Salamence, and Iron Hands, allowing it to finish these Pokemon off more easily. Buginium Z is usually the preferred item for its aforementioned power boost to U-turn, on top of reducing damage taken from Bisharp's Knock Off, but Heavy-Duty Boots is an alternative that offsets Scizor's vulnerability to entry hazards. The given EV spread hits an extra Attack point, allows Scizor to reduce the amount of damage taken from attacks such as Excadrill's Earthquake and Mandibuzz's Foul Play and outspeeds Skeledirge and Skarmory. Scizor's pivoting capabilities in tandem with its ability to check faster threats are appreciated by defensive Pokemon otherwise vulnerable to the overwhelming offensive pressure exerted by them. Walls such as Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Slowbro are particularly helpful in this regard; Ting-Lu can check Fire-types such as Iron Moth while setting up entry hazards to help Scizor cripple the opposing team more effectively, whereas Rotom-W and Slowbro can help maneuver around Fighting-types in Galarian Zapdos and Buzzwole while providing Scizor with additional pivoting support. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Enamorus, Choice Specs Latios, and Nasty Plot Hydreigon, each appreciate Scizor's ability to provide safe entry with its U-turn or threaten the removal of items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Slowking and Assault Vest from Tangrowth if running Knock Off, helping in return by opening up the conditions required for Scizor to successfully sweep teams late-game. While Scizor can help teams out in checking faster threats, its lack of initial power on Bullet Punch outside of super effective hits, particularly against bulkier targets such as Galarian Moltres and Autotomize Celesteela, can leave a lot to be desired. As such, partners that can deal with these specific Pokemon, such as Mega Tyranitar, Thunder Wave Clefable, and defensive Tapu Fini, manage to help out in this regard.</p>"

        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Band provides Scizor with immediate power on its attacks, allowing it to be more proficient as a wallbreaker, pivot, and late-game cleaner all at once. Bullet Punch puts substantial pressure on win conditions such as Calm Mind Clefable, Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar, and Tapu Bulu, outright OHKOing the latter from full HP. Knock Off allows Scizor to remove important items from Pokemon otherwise reliant on them to deter it, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Salamence and Rocky Helmet from Buzzwole and Amoonguss. Pursuit takes advantage of Scizor's excellent typing against several Psychic-type Pokemon to trap them, most notably Mega Latias, Choice-locked Latios, and Slowking. Alternatively, Close Combat and Dual Wingbeat are options to pose a more immediate threat to their respective targets, such as Excadrill and Magnezone with Close Combat and Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur with Dual Wingbeat. Scizor fits best on bulky offense teams that can best take advantage of its strong momentum-grabbing capabilities and cleanup potential. Pivots such as Rotom-W, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Sandy Shocks can help Scizor by threatening the physical walls used to stifle it, including Skarmory and Buzzwole; in return, Scizor can help force damage onto walls that normally handle these pivots, such as Tangrowth and Blissey. Scizor also appreciates strong entry hazard removal options to avoid being worn down quickly, including Defog from Rotom-W, Tapu Fini, and Volcanion and Rapid Spin from Excadrill; the aforementioned Defog users are also capable of taking advantage of Fire-types that may pose a threat to Scizor, such as Victini. On the other hand, entry hazard support from the likes of Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Sandy Shocks is imperative to increase the overall impact of Scizor's pivoting capabilities as well as extend its capacity to revenge kill threats like Galarian Moltres and Dragon Dance Salamence with Bullet Punch.</p>"

Knock Off provides item removal against counters such as Toxapex, Volcarona, and Skeledirge; removing key items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers makes threats like these much easier for allies to deal with. U-turn alternatively allows Mega Scizor to function as a potent pivot; It can rack up chip damage while providing free points of entry for wallbreakers, since it switches easily into Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant among others. Roost provides valuable recovery, letting Mega Scizor shrug off chip damage from Stealth Rock and stray Knock Offs. The given defensive EVs allow Mega Scizor to always avoid a 2HKO from Mega Lopunny's Close Combat after Stealth Rock, while the Speed EVs allow Mega Scizor to outspeed uninvested Heatran.  Mega Scizor's Knock Off support is valued greatly by allies such as Hisuian Samurott, which has a much easier time beating checks after they have had their Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots removed. Rotom-W notably forms a strong VoltTurn core with U-turn Mega Scizor, pivoting out on each other's checks to rack up chip damage. Mega Scizor has the added benefit of absorbing Knock Off for its team, so allies like Volcarona and Tornadus-T need not fear their key items being removed. However, Mega Scizor is countered by Fire-types like Heatran and Mega Charizard Y that threaten to OHKO it, so allies that can soak up these attacks such as Heatran itself and Toxapex are recommended.</p>"

Knock Off is an option over Roost to hit Skeledirge and Zapdos, while Sand Tomb is another option to beat Toxapex while also maintaining a good matchup into Heatran, but Roost is more useful in a majority of cases. The given EVs allow Mega Scizor to outrun uninvested Moltres and defensive Landorus-T. Offensive Mega Scizor is a good fit on offensive teams that appreciate its defensive utility, though limited, along with its ability to act as a cleaner with +2 Bullet Punch. It can be used to outspeed and heavily chip threats such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Rotom-W, letting the team break through these foes, especially as they have no reliable form of recovery. Since Mega Scizor can check Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Clefable, and Tapu Lele, partners like Garchomp and Heatran synergize well, as they also switch into Fire-types like Volcarona for it. Without Knock Off, however, Mega Scizor is walled by bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo, so allies like Zapdos are good partners.</p>"

Swords Dance allows Scizor to OHKO the likes of Dragapult and Cyclizar. Technician-boosted Bullet Punch is Scizor's most spammable attack, serving as a priority STAB move to revenge kill sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Flutter Mane. Close Combat answers Steel teams and threaten slower walls like Ting-Lu and Corviknight. Trailblaze allows Scizor to outspeed threats like Great Tusk and Hydreigon at +1 Speed and hits Quagsire and Gastrodon. Fury Cutter provides an additional Technician-boosted STAB move and is mainly used in tandem with Metronome to break Dondozo. Thief offers coverage and allows Life Orb Scizor to answer Gholdengo and 2HKO Skeledirge thanks to the boost from Technician, though Life Orb isn't recommended outside of these scenarios. Alternatively, Metal Coat enhances the power of Bullet Punch without drawbacks. The EV spread maximizes Scizor's damage output and allows it to outspeed uninvested Rotom forms and Adamant Azumarill.</p> <p>Volcarona is the perfect partner for Scizor, as it's less threatened by Fire-types and can sweep through most Steel, Psychic, and Ground teams. It takes care of Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Klefki; in return, Scizor handles Rock-types like Glimmora and Lycanroc-D and weakens the opposing team to facilitate Volcarona's late-game sweep. Slither Wing offers great coverage against types that Scizor struggles to beat, threatening Electric- and Rock-types with Earthquake, Flying- and Water-types with Wild Charge, and Steel-types with Flare Blitz or Close Combat. Similar to Scizor, Lokix gets two powerful STAB priority moves in First Impression and Sucker Punch which, paired with Tinted Lens, allow it to OHKO faster threats like Greninja, Gengar, and Kilowattrel after chip damage. These priority moves, along with Masquerain's Sticky Web support, allow Bug teams to compensate for their generally slower Speed tier. Another good partner to Scizor is Guts Heracross, which can sponge status moves targeting its teammates and sweep through teams that have been weakened by Scizor. With its combination of Sleep Powder and Energy Ball, Vivillon can take out threats that give Bug teams trouble, particularly Dondozo. Rabsca and Forretress provide substantial support; Rabsca's Revival Blessing offers Scizor a second chance at breaking down the opponent's team, while Forretress's entry hazard stacking and Rapid Spin combination allows its teammates to switch in more safely and make holes in the opposing team.</p>"

Thief does offer more consistent damage than Knock Off though, thanks to Technician.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dual Wingbeat</strong>: Dual Wingbeat is Scizor's best option against Ogerpon-H as well Fighting-types like Annihilape and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: Close Combat is Scizor's best option to hit opposing Ursaluna-B and Chi-Yu as well as Steel types, even when using defensive EV spreads.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Scarf is a shocking twist against Ogerpon-H and Urshifu formes to launch off a strong Dual Wingbeat, but this does mean Scizor's bulk is heavily compromised against the threats it usually checks, like Flutter Mane.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization can be quite helpful in either cleaning teams or preparing against Scizor's classic Fire-type issues, the power of its priority and pivoting don't make it needed for it to function consistently.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water turns its Fire weakness into a resistance, giving Scizor a fighting chance against dangerous Fire-types such as Chi-Yu, Gouging Fire, and Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is ideal for more offensive Scizor variants, making Bullet Punch an even better cleaning tool. Tera Steel also softens Scizor's weakness to Fire, letting it avoid the OHKO from attacks like Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire is a great response most Ogerpon-H sets, and shields Scizor from burns that foes like Entei like to deal out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Increasing Dual Wingbeat's power with Terastallization nets Scizor some useful new OHKOs against offensive Urshifu formes and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: While not an incredible defensive typing, Tera Dragon is fantastic against most Fire and Water Pokemon that give Scizor trouble, with Ogerpon formes being a particularly prominent example.

Just note that this will make Scizor focus more on pivoting than revenge killing with Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brave or Relaxed with a Speed IV of 8 or 9</strong>: This Speed IV can be used to use U-turn after some Hippowdon use Yawn, but still outspeed Ting-Lu.

Bullet Punch is Mega Scizor's strongest STAB move, and its priority allows it to revenge kill faster threats such as Mega Diancie, Iron Valiant, and Mega Lopunny. Close Combat is Mega Scizor's strongest coverage move, enabling it to more easily beat Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. After a Swords Dance boost, Mega Scizor becomes strong enough to 2HKO Celesteela, opposing Mega Scizor, and physically defensive Gastrodon. Knock Off removes essential items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Tornadus-T and Black Sludge from Toxapex, and it also provides Mega Scizor with strong coverage against Aegislash, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo. Alternatively, Trailblaze can also be used to 2HKO bulky Water- or Ground-type Pokemon most other Steel-types struggle with such as Mega Swampert and Gastrodon, as well as potentially OHKO Azumarill and Rotom-W after a Swords Dance boost and Stealth Rock damage. 132 Speed EVs are invested in order for Mega Scizor to outspeed Jolly Azumarill as well as Hydreigon and Urshifu-S after a Trailblaze. Heatran and Ferrothorn are great teammates because they are able to set entry hazards to wear down incoming foes, and Heatran also has the added benefit of providing a Fire immunity thanks to its ability. Ferrothorn can also provide passive healing for Mega Scizor via the use of Leech Seed. In return, Mega Scizor is able to threaten faster Fighting-types such as Sneasler and Iron Valiant with Bullet Punch. Gholdengo is able to threaten Toxapex and Tapu Lele, and it along with Aegislash can also hinder foes with Toxic and Thunder Wave respectively if they are running defensive sets, easing set up for Mega Scizor. In return, Mega Scizor can remove Dark-types such as Meowscarada, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Moltres. Specially defensive Celesteela is an excellent special wall that can wall Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Mega Altaria, while also being able to spread status and use Leech Seed to aid Mega Scizor in its sweeping. As Mega Scizor is more vulnerable to hazards compared to other Steel-types, it appreciates hazard removal from the likes of Corviknight, Excadrill, and Iron Treads. Excadrill and Iron Treads also have the added merit of handling Fire-types like Victini and Ogerpon-H. Excadrill can also bypass Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce and inflict poison on it thanks to Mold Breaker, while Iron Treads can threaten both Landorus formes with Ice Spinner.</p>"

Shuckle can generate momentum after setting up hazards by using Final Gambit, allowing teammates such as Shell Smash Omastar, Mega Diancie, and Choice Band Tyranitar to come in and start exerting pressure. Toxic can also be used to punish more passive Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Hippowdon. Mega Diancie can bounce back any hazards or status moves directed at Shuckle and provides amazing offensive pressure and coverage against Poison-, Steel-, and Dragon-types. Sticky Web allows Choice Band Tyranitar to outspeed Choice Specs Gholdengo and Nidoking, both of which are threats to Rock. Omastar and Minior benefit from Stealth Rock breaking potential Focus Sashes and are great partners to have in the Grass and Fighting matchups.

On the flipside, Choice Band sets retain great revenge killing potential because Hisuian Sneasel is so naturally fast, and they're very effective wallbreakers to boot thanks to their solid coverage. For the Pokemon Hisuian Sneasel can't consistently defeat like Tera Ghost Sandaconda, Qwilfish, and Sableye, Switcheroo provides a good means of limiting their defensive capabilities. Picking its Tera type is fairly arbitrary, though Tera Fighting lets Choice Band Hisuian Sneasel 2HKO Sandaconda with Close Combat and Choice Scarf Hisuian Sneasel 2HKO Toxicroak after Stealth Rock; alternatively, Tera Dark provides defensive utility against Mesprit, ensures Night Slash OHKOes Rotom after Stealth Rock, and denies Sableye's Prankster Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Despite Choice Scarf and Choice Band Hisuian Sneasel being somewhat different in function, their teammates are pretty similar. Both benefit from teammates like Clawitzer, Rotom, and Mesprit that can take advantage of Sandaconda so they feel less inclined to Terastallize and deal with it themselves. Where they differ is that Choice Scarf Sneasel is far more suited as a late-game cleaner and, as a result, is more reliant on wallbreakers like Guts Ursaring, Magneton, and offensive Appletun to weaken its checks.

Toxic is an option to put defensive switch-ins such as Skeledirge and Rotom-W on a timer, helping Piloswine's teammates overpower them, but Roar is an alternative choice to force out threats that may use it to set up, such as Mega Scizor, and to rack up hazard damage from its Stealth Rock and Cloyster's Spikes to wear down threats such as Urshifu-R and Mega Venusaur. Piloswine appreciates Alolan Ninetales's snow and Aurora Veil, which let it wall the opposition more easily. Piloswine is, however, extremely vulnerable to Water-types, so partnering it with Kyurem or Arctozolt is appreciated, as they can easily break Water teams. Substitute Baxcalibur also threatens Poison teams, which can cripple Piloswine with Toxic. Weavile with a Z-Crystal is also a good Knock Off absorber for Piloswine, as losing Eviolite ruins Piloswine; Weavile also forces immense progress by removing key items from Celesteela and Skeledirge, which become susceptible to Stealth Rock afterwards, or outright breaking through them with a Z-Move. Galarian Darmanitan and Shell Smash Cloyster can threaten Steel teams with Flare Blitz and Hydro Pump or Hidden Power Fire, respectively. The Stealth Rocks and Toxic spread by Piloswine also accentuates the breaking power of teammates such as Swords Dance or Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Belly Drum Cetitan. IronPress Avalugg and defensive Cloyster with Hidden Power Fire are also good partners in being able to shut down Mega Scizor. Avalugg, Articuno, and Cloyster are also capable of removing entry hazards, with the latter two also being able to pivot in Piloswine with U-turn and Teleport, respectively.</p>"

Iron Defense is typically run alongside Body Press to allow Skarmory to function as a wincon while also making it a better check to Pokemon like Zacian, Palafin, and Baxcalibur. Whirlwind can be used over Iron Defense to rack up entry hazard damage from the Spikes Skarmory sets and phaze foes trying to set up on it. Tera Water allows Skarmory to beat Pokemon like Tera Fire Zacian and Palafin. Skarmory has trouble with special attackers like Kyurem-W, Arceus-Dark, and Chi-Yu, which can easily OHKO it, so specially defensive walls like Giratina and Arceus-Dark form excellent cores with it. In exchange, Skarmory can check Pokemon like Zacian and Zamazenta-C for its teammates.

Its immunity to Toxic and Spikes further accentuates its defensive capabilities, making it a very resilient wall. Aside from granting Skarmory an adequate offensive presence, Iron Defense + Body Press lets it beat and contest with Attack-boosting foes like Mega Scizor, Garchomp, and Kingambit that attempt to break past it. Rocky Helmet punishes the physical attackers it’s tasked to check, notably Mega Scizor, Mega Lopunny, and Landorus-T's U-turn and Great Tusk and Excadrill’s Rapid Spin. Tera Dragon allows it to check Mega Swampert, Urshifu-R, Victini, and non-Dragon Claw Mega Charizard X better at the cost of being weaker against Weavile and Garchomp. Tera Fighting lets Skarmory deal with Kingambit more comfortably. The EV spread allows Skarmory to outspeed Mega Mawile and maximum speed Kingambit. Skarmory fits on defensive builds, ranging from balance to stall. Special walls like Garganacl and Hippowdon are necessary to cover threats like Dragapult and Volcarona that would exploit Skarmory's poor special bulk. Hippowdon is an exceptional partner, as it also deals with foes like Zapdos, Tapu Koko, Mega Charizard Y, as well as mixed attackers like Mega Diancie and Iron Valiant. Moreover, they form an entry hazard-stacking core with Skarmory by providing Stealth Rock and spreading further chip damage with Salt Cure, Toxic, and sand to slowly crumble the opposition. Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Iron Hands, and Zamazenta are a few physical attackers that Skarmory can struggle with; Toxapex, Clefable, Tornadus-T, and Skeledirge, respectively, help handle them. Its inability to threaten Gholdengo can be covered by teammates like Kingambit and Clodsire. Late-game cleaners or bulky setup sweepers like Mega Lopunny, Volcarona, and Gholdengo appreciate Skamory's Spikes chipping down their checks like Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Kingambit, respectively; Gholdengo also prevents most entry hazard removal attempts due to its typing and Good as Gold.</p>"

Rocky Helmet and Body Press let it handle common powerful physical attackers such as Chien-Pao, Kleavor, and Kingambit. Iron Defense allows it to comfortably shrug off hits from threats like Iron Hands, Zamazenta, and Baxcalibur. Spikes and Stealth Rock pressure threats like Gholdengo, Raging Bolt, and Toxapex, with the former being used if another teammate is running Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Gliscor serves as an excellent partner for Skarmory, being able to effortlessly handle incoming Electric-type attacks from the likes of Regieleki and Sandy Shocks along with dealing with powerful Fire-type types like Gouging Fire, Heatran, and Ceruledge; additionally, Gliscor can run a Swords Dance set if Skarmory is running Stealth Rock. Corviknight complements Skarmory incredibly well as a special wall to deal with threatening special attacks from the likes of Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Kyurem along with using Defog to give Skarmory safe entry. Articuno with its high special bulk serves as solid deterrence to threatening special attackers such as Greninja, Dragapult, and Keldeo. Gyarados, thanks to its Water typing, Intimidate, and phazing tools can deter threats such as Gouging Fire, Ceruledge, Chien-Pao, and Barraskewda. Landorus's Ground typing and high offensive stats make it an excellent threat against notable Electric-, Fire-, and Poison-types such as Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, and Toxapex. Enamorus and Dragonite benefit immensely from Skarmory's hazard support to soften up walls like Alolan Muk, Hippowdon, and Hisuian Goodra so they can effortlessly break through them along with Skarmory's ability to take Ice Shard from the likes of Chien-Pao, Mamoswine, and Baxcalibur. Zapdos serves as a solid Electric neutrality along with threatening out opposing bulky Flying-types like Corviknight, Moltres, and Skarmory as well as Water-types like Urshifu-R and Pelipper. Tornadus-T can handle the Ogerpon formes with its Hurricane and remove HeavyDuty Boots from threats like Amoonguss and Sableye with Knock Off, making Skarmory's Spikes even more potent. Mandibuzz gives a solid Ghost resistance against threats like Dragapult and Ceruledge and can also use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots.

          "description": "<p>Skarmory is commonly used as an anti-setup Pokemon, having great bulk and a strong defensive typing that lets it check common offensive physical threats such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, Iron Boulder, and Zamazenta. Skarmory's immense physical bulk allows it to tank hits from the aforementioned Pokemon and punish them with Rocky Helmet chip damage, making it a great sponge on balanced structures. Skarmory is able to set up Iron Defense on physical attackers, increasing its Defense exponentially and massively boosting the power of Body Press while denying any setup opportunities. With enough Defense boosts, Skarmory can turn into a deadly late-game win condition with IronPress, only stopped by Ghost-types. Rocky Helmet makes it impossible for even fully Attack-boosted Pokemon to match its Defense boosts, as Skarmory's access to Roost grants it longevity, letting it outlive almost every physical setup Pokemon in the long term. Iron Defense Skarmory also has access to Spikes and Stealth Rock, making it more proactive against Pokemon such as Gliscor and Ting-Lu that may use it as an opportunity to set up entry hazards. Tera Dragon gives Skarmory a great resistance to Fire, which lets it check Pokemon such as bulky Gouging Fire with no Dragon-type STAB moves and Cinderace; it also eases the matchup against Ogerpon-W. Tera Fighting gives Skarmory extra insurance against Kingambit thanks to its Kowtow Cleave resistance and is especially useful for teams that are potentially weak to Jolly Kingambit late-game. Skarmory is EVed to outspeed Adamant Kingambit, with the remaining EVs allocated to HP and Defense.</p> <p>Iron Defense Skarmory is outstanding on balance teams that struggle against setup Pokemon that take advantage of the team's passivity, synergizing with Pokemon like Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, as they can set up entry hazards to pressure foes as well as remove opposing Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off. It also pairs well with Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, which can sponge special moves that Skarmory is unable to take, and they also check dangerous threats such as Volcarona and Cinderace. These Pokemon are often fodder for opposing Swords Dance Kingambit or Bulk Up Great Tusk; however, Skarmory handles them with ease. Skarmory is also great against Pokemon such as Iron Defense Zamazenta and Rillaboom thanks to its solid typing and immense bulk. Chip damage from Rocky Helmet disincentivizes the aforementioned Pokemon from using physical moves, and Skarmory outlives them eventually thanks to its longevity and recovery capabilities with Roost. Despite Skarmory's great physical bulk, it is vulnerable to special attackers and Ghost-types that may take advantage of it, such as Volcarona, Gholdengo, and Dragapult. Ting-Lu and Galarian Slowking are great for tanking special attackers' hits, the former being a great Ghost-type check. Heavy-Duty Boots Kingambit is also a good choice alongside Skarmory, as it can find opportunities to set up against Ghost-types while being a reliable sponge, as well as having strong priority moves against the special attackers that Skarmory would otherwise struggle against. In return, Skarmory can set Spikes for Kingambit and act as a reliable wall to some of Kingambit's checks, particularly Bulk Up Great Tusk and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Due to its lack of pivoting capabilities unlike Corviknight, Skarmory also appreciates Pokemon that can tank hits and pivot around, such as Rotom-W, U-turn Gliscor, and Meowscarada.</p>"

Skarmory also serves as a valuable Spikes user thanks to it being able to set up against threats such as Buzzwole, Blissey, and non-Flamethrower Clefable. The combination of Iron Defense and Body Press is Skarmory’s preferred choice to make progress against teams, as it allows it to stonewall threats such as Scizor, Bisharp, and Tyranitar while also further pressuring threats such as Blissey and Hippowdon. Dropping Iron Defense and Body Press for Whirlwind or Toxic and Brave Bird respectively is also an option on more offensive teams to pressure threats such as Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur more effectively while also offering extra team support by phasing or spreading poison damage. However, this comes at the cost of being far more passive against Excadrill and lacks a proper response to Bisharp and Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar. On stall teams, Skarmory has the choice of running Defog in place of either Spikes or Iron Defense and can also run an EV spread of 248 HP / 76 Def / 184 Spe with an Impish nature to outspeed Choice Band Tyranitar, allowing it to boost or safely heal up before Tyranitar can 2HKO it. Skarmory’s main item of choice is Rocky Helmet to get residual damage off against foes with U-turn such as Scizor and Galarian Zapdos while also chipping setup sweepers such as Mega Tyranitar, but it can also run Shed Shell on bulkier playstyles such as balance and stall in order to avoid being trapped by Magnezone. Skarmory can struggle a lot against special attackers such as Latios and Enamorus, so specially defensive walls such as Blissey, Chansey, and specially defensive Skeledirge are good partners to shore up that weakness. Mega Tyranitar is another good partner, since it can switch into and Pursuit trap threats that pressure Skarmory such as Iron Moth and Hisuian Zoroark. Common pivots that take advantage of Skarmory such as Latios, Thundurus, and Thundurus-T also hate being Pursuit trapped by Mega Tyranitar. Skarmory also has issues against Fire-types such as Iron Moth and Victini, so bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Alomomola can help deal with them. Electric-types such as Thundurus, Thundurus-T, Sandy Shocks, and Zeraora can also threaten Skarmory, so bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon are good partners to hinder them, but bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur also work as teammates at the cost of being unable to block Volt Switch. The aforementioned Ground-types can also form strong entry hazard stacking cores with Skarmory that bulkier playstyles such as stall enjoy greatly. Offensively, wallbreakers such as Iron Hands, Latios, and Galarian Zapdos make for good partners, since they appreciate Skarmory's Spikes helping them chip their checks so they can wallbreak easier.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its strong offensive typing, access to setup moves, and useful coverage, Houndoom establishes itself as a high level offensive threat in the PU metagame. Fire Blast allows Houndoom to have some extra power and can be especially useful in situations where boosting with Nasty Plot is not possible. It also helps Houndoom to muscle through targets that either are extremely bulky or naturally resist Dark Pulse, such as Tinkatuff. Alternatively, Flamethrower provides a less powerful but more consistent Fire-type STAB attack and eliminates the risk of a missed Fire Blast prematurely ending Houndoom's sweep. Sludge Bomb gives Houndoom a strong special coverage move able to hit certain targets for neutral or super effective damage that would otherwise wall Houndoom handily, such as Carbink, Dachsbun, and opposing Houndoom. Sucker Punch gives Houndoom a safe option against faster, weakened targets that threaten to revenge kill it, such as Dugtrio, Alolan Dugtrio, and Basculin, although one must be wary of these Pokemon's access to their own priority. Trailblaze is another option, allowing Houndoom to remedy its underwhelming Speed and become a much more threatening sweeper, either through a well-timed prediction or by finishing off a weakened target. Heavy-Duty Boots is mandatory on this set to offer Houndoom opportunities to use Nasty Plot, since it is already relatively frail. Flash Fire both sets it apart from and allows it to combat fellow Fire-type attackers such as Pyroar, Charizard, and opposing Houndoom, allowing it to safely switch in on their Fire-type STAB moves while also boosting the power of its own. In a similar manner, it can also take advantage of Will-O-Wisp from targets such as Midreavus and Rotom-S. Tera Dark increases the power of Dark Pulse even further while also removing key weaknesses to Rock, Water, and Ground. Tera Grass offers a resistance to the latter two while also increasing the power of Trailblaze and pairing well with Houndoom's natural Fire immunity. Lastly, Tera Poison increases the power of Sludge Bomb, increasing damage against foes such as Carbink and Dachsbun while also providing a resistance to STAB moves from Pokemon such as Skuntank. Also of note, Houndoom should only use a Hasty nature if it is running Sucker Punch; otherwise, it should use a Timid nature and 0 Attack IVs.</p> <p>Houndoom's greatest challenge is its rather disappointing Speed, especially compared to other Fire-type wallbreakers like Charizard and Pyroar, so a Sticky Web setter such as Masquerain is greatly appreciated. Houndoom also greatly appreciates teammates like Perrserker and Skuntank that can handle Dachsbun and Carbink, especially if it opts not to run Sludge Bomb. Similarly, teammates that can handle bulky Water-types such as Lumineon and Whiscash are welcome, as while Houndoom can do relatively good damage to these Pokemon with Dark Pulse, doing so is extremely risky without a Nasty Plot boost or a defensive Tera. Therefore, Grass-types such as Gogoat and Thwackey are natural partners, with Houndoom especially appreciating the latter's ability to set Grassy Terrain, both allowing Houndoom some passive recovery and lessening the damage from opposing Earthquakes. Fast revenge killers, such as Electrode and Raichu, and Choice Scarf users such as Golduck, are also excellent teammates, as they are able to handily dispose of targets that Houndoom has already heavily damaged.</p>"

Stealth Rock is Blissey's most popular utility move because it lets other Stealth Rock setters run different sets alongside Blissey. Thunder Wave gives Blissey a way of punishing physical attackers such as Toxicroak, Paldean Tauros, and Scyther for switching in. However, this leaves you vulnerable to Pokemon such as Rotom and Haunter, so Shadow Ball can be used to threaten them instead. Heal Bell allows Blissey to relieve its team of status, helping against bulkier teams that may use Toxic. Any two-move combination of Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, Shadow Ball, and Heal Bell can work depending on your team structure. Tera Ghost helps Blissey against many physical attackers, including Toxicroak, Hisuian Sneasel, and Tauros, and makes it easy to paralyze them on the following turn. Alternatively, Tera Fairy gives Blissey an incredible generalist typing that still helps it tank Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p>Pairing Blissey with physical walls such as Sandaconda, Avalugg, and Sableye can help Blissey circumvent its low physical bulk. Stealth Rock Blissey also opens up frees up Sandaconda to run Coil sets instead. Additionally, Taunt users such as Froslass and Hisuian Qwilfish can beat Blissey by shutting down its recovery and utility moves. Having additional Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Bombirdier and Eelektross that can check these Pokemon helps Blissey substantially. Lastly, item disruption from Knock Off and Trick can be troubling for Blissey; without Heavy-Duty Boots, it's liable to being chipped down overtime by entry hazards, while Trick from Choice item users such as Rotom completely cripples Blissey. As a result, having a Knock Off absorber like Sandaconda or a Trick absorber like Sticky Hold Muk is great to support Blissey.</p>"

On the other hand, Dazzling Gleam and Stored Power can be used together for more overall damage output, allowing it to beat opposing Blissey and Braviary. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam can be used as well thanks to their useful coverage against Pokemon like Sandaconda and Bruxish, but they don't synergize well with Blissey's common Tera types. Tera Ghost ensures that Shadow Ball OHKOes non-Eviolite Haunter while also giving Blissey more opportunities to set up against Fighting-types it would otherwise be weak to, such as Hisuian Sneasel, Medicham, and Toxicroak. Tera Fairy also gives Blissey defensive traits such as resisting Fighting- and Dark-type attacks while boosting the power of Dazzling Gleam.</p> <p>Blissey appreciates help from physical walls such as Qwilfish, Sableye, and Sandaconda, which are able to punish common Fighting-types that threaten Blissey like Hisuian Sneasel, Medicham, and Paldean Tauros.

Seismic Toss allows Blissey to pressure anything that isn't a Ghost-type with meaningful damage. Toxic is the preferred option to cripple Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Thunder Wave can also be used to annoy fast threats like Tornadus-T and Iron Valiant. It also allows Blissey to status Steel-types like Kingambit, Heatran, and Kartana. Teleport allows Blissey to safely pivot in teammates like Dragapult, Zamazenta, and Mega Medicham. However, Blissey is an acceptable Stealth Rock user if no other fits on your team. Shadow Ball can be considered as a niche option to break Dragapult's Substitutes and chip offensive Gholdengo, but it usually isn't worth dropping other moves. Tera Fairy gives Blissey a Fighting resistance in exchange for negligible Poison and Steel weaknesses, and it reduces the damage it takes from Pursuit users like Kingambit, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar. This should be used if Blissey absolutely has to take on a Fighting- or Dark-type like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, or Weavile. Blissey's defensive profile makes it a liability into certain Ghost-types, specifically Dragon Dance Dragapult and Gholdengo. Kingambit is a great option that deals with the former two threats while also benefitting from Blissey bringing it in safely with Teleport. Other wallbreakers like Tapu Lele, Dragapult, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Medicham also appreciate pivot support and benefit from Blissey spreading Thunder Wave. A switch-in to powerful physical attackers, like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, and Kingambit, is necessary. Options like Toxapex, Slowbro, Skarmory, and Great Tusk can help out on this front. Knock Off is irritating for Blissey, as losing its Heavy-Duty Boots is quite detrimental to its pivoting efforts. Options such as Flyinium Z Tornadus-T and Gliscor can help out in this regard.</p>"

Seismic Toss is the best move for Blissey to deal consistent damage and not be a completely passive Pokemon despite being ineffective against Ghost-types. Shadow Ball can be used over Seismic Toss in order to not be completely useless against Ghost-types. Stealth Rock helps Blissey's offensive teammates like Ursaluna and Maushold have an easier time getting KOs. Thunder Wave is used to slow down opposing Pokemon so that Blissey's slower, wallbreaking teammates, such as Ursaluna, have an easier time making progress. Alternatively, Healing Wish can be used over Thunder Wave in order to heal one of Blissey's teammates to full health, gaining momentum and making an end-game sweep easier.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Ursaluna and Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark are great teammates for Blissey, as they are capable of dealing with the defensive Pokemon that Blissey is unable to beat, such as Sableye, Toxapex, and Dondozo. In return, Blissey can switch into attacks to keep the wallbreakers safe. Ditto and Blissey make a great pair, as, thanks to Natural Cure, Blissey is able to switch in to status moves that would otherwise cripple Ditto, such as Will-O-Wisp from Sableye, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W, as well as Thunder Wave from Gholdengo, then get rid of the status via Natural Cure. Ditto is also capable of dealing with setup sweepers that would otherwise threaten Blissey such as Baxcalibur and Dragonite. Thunder Wave is also a great option to use on opposing Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant and Meowscarada so Ditto will not have to worry about Speed ties. Hisuian Zoroark is a great teammate for Blissey, as the immunity to Fighting-type moves is extremely valuable. Hisuian Zoroark is also able to burn opposing physical threats like Urshifu-R and Dragonite, which would otherwise make quick work of Blissey, as well as dealing with Ghost-type Pokemon which Blissey cannot damage without Shadow Ball. Hisuian Zoroark's Knock Off can also help Blissey wear down targets by making them vulnerable to entry hazards and removing Leftovers and Black Sludge recovery. Moreover, Hisuian Zoroark can disguise itself as Blissey and catch foes such as Iron Hands, Zamazenta and Sneasler off guard. Cyclizar is a good teammate for Blissey, as Blissey can switch into the fast special attackers that would otherwise threaten Cyclizar such as Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Walking Wake. Cyclizar also carries Knock Off, which, as mentioned previously, works well with Blissey. Choice Specs Cyclizar outspeeds and threatens to OHKO non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, which would otherwise threaten Blissey, with Hyper Voice. Finally, Braviary and Staraptor can function as alternative switch-ins to Fighting-type Pokemon like Quaquaval and Great Tusk and retaliate with their STAB-boosted Brave Bird. Braviary uses Defog to keep Blissey and teammates safe from hazards, while Staraptor is a more offensive Choice Scarf user able to threaten Fighting-type Pokemon.</p>"

Calm Mind + Shadow Ball is enough to beat the few special attackers that can otherwise defeat Blissey one-on-one such as Sheer Force Gengar and Gholdengo. Stealth Rock provides entry hazard support to free up a moveslot for a teammate, while Thunder Wave spreads status, crippling Pokemon like Azelf and Manaphy, and Heal Bell allows Blissey to operate as a cleric. Unaware allows Blissey to check special attackers attempting to set up on it like Gholdengo, Tail Glow Manaphy, and Iron Moth, while Well-Baked Body allows it to check Iron Moth while also giving it a more favorable matchup into Volcarona and Heatran. Magic Guard allows Blissey to avoid chip damage from entry hazards, letting it function as a better wall. Blissey most commonly runs Leftovers, as the extra healing can be extremely helpful, although on teams with more shaky hazard control, Heavy-Duty Boots can be opted for instead. A Calm nature is used to make Blissey function better as a special wall, notiably allowing it to always avoid the 2HKO from Sheer Force Gengar's Focus Blast. Blissey is most notably a special wall that does not require the use of Regenerator, which allows physical walls such as Great Tusk to run it instead. Blissey is most commonly seen on stall and fat team structures. Physically defensive walls like Corviknight and Deoxys-D are a must, as they help deal with Blissey's weakness to physical attackers and make a potent defensive core with it.</p>"

Ruination is a way to make near-guaranteed progress barring a miss, and its consistent damage mitigates Blissey's otherwise-crippling passivity. Topsy-Turvy deters setup attempts from Take Heart and Nasty Plot users by inverting their boosts and likely forcing a switch, in which case Blissey can then pivot out with Teleport or Parting Shot. Blissey's ability to deny Strength Sap healing makes it a great pick on balance teams carrying physical attackers such as Mega Lucario, as Fur Coat walls with Strength Sap usually can't get past Blissey, and physical attackers can force Imposter users out if they switch in while Blissey is pivoting. Blissey's immense frailty means that reliable physical walls, such as Mega Slowbro, are mandatory to cover for it; Arceus-Ghost can also bypass Blissey with either Secret Sword or Triple Arrows, so Yveltal makes for a good teammate.

          "description": "<p>Mega Tyranitar’s excellent defensive stats, typing, and Pursuit enable it to carve a niche as a reliable entry hazard setter and Pursuit trapper. Stone Edge is a strong STAB option that OHKOes Iron Moth while denting neutral targets such as Celesteela and Tapu Fini. Pursuit enables Mega Tyranitar to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latios and Blacephalon. Knock Off offers a strong STAB move to OHKO bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types like Hisuian Zoroark and Latios. It is also the strongest move Mega Tyranitar has to hit Slowbro. Superpower is an option to snipe opposing Tyranitar and severely damage would-be switch-ins such as Excadrill. 176 Speed EVs enable Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Celesteela. Offensive Fighting-types such as Buzzwole, Iron Hands, and Keldeo appreciate Mega Tyranitar removing bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types. In exchange, Buzzwole covers Mega Tyranitar’s weaknesses to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, while Keldeo can bring Mega Tyranitar in safely with Flip Turn. Other teammates such as Iron Moth and Tapu Bulu offer some defensive synergy and appreciate Mega Tyranitar’s ability to remove Psychic- and Fire-types, respectively. Mega Tyranitar’s typing gives its weaknesses to prominent attacking types such as Fighting, Water, and Ground, so Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss can provide switch-ins to these types. The Future Sight support provided by the latter meshes well with Pursuit and dissuades Buzzwole and Iron Hands from switching in. Celesteela and Skarmory can help check Excadrill and Buzzwole, with Skarmory providing Spikes as a bonus. Clefable and Tapu Fini can check Fighting-types for Mega Tyranitar to some degree. Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to being chipped down, so partners such as Choice Scarf Latias and Choice Band Scizor can ease the burden against frail sweepers such as Polteageist and Nihilego. Finally, Sand Rush Excadrill benefits from Mega Tyranitar’s Sand Stream and its ability to wear down Skarmory and Hippowdon.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar utilizes its solid bulk and versatile offensive coverage to act as a threatening late-game cleaner. Ice Punch synergizes well with Stone Edge, as it chunks physically defensive Ground-types like Hippowdon and physically defensive Tangrowth. Earthquake is a valuable coverage option to hit Excadrill. Knock Off is an alternative STAB option that hits Gastrodon and Slowbro hard. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Alakazam with a single Dragon Dance. Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar is usually found on bulky offense or hyper offense since these structures provide adequate tools to facilitate setup. The main hindrances for Mega Tyranitar are physically defensive walls like Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Clefable. Teammates like Mewoscarada, Tapu Fini, Swords Dance Scizor, and Meteor Beam Celesteela can take advantage of these Pokemon. Mega Tyranitar can also be revenge killed by common Fighting-types like Buzzwole, Keldeo, and Iron Hands even after a boost. Teammates such as Polteageist and Latios offer valuable typings and can soft-check Fighting-types. In return, they appreciate Mega Tyranitar’s ability to take advantage of specially defensive walls such as Blissey. Offensive Steel-types such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Scizor can cut a Mega Tyranitar sweep short, and thus Fire-types like Victini and Iron Moth are excellent partners. Magnezone deserves a special mention, as it traps Scizor and Skarmory. Sand Rush Excadrill appreciates Mega Tyranitar’s Sand Stream ability and in exchange offers insurance against Unaware Clefable. Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to chip damage and thus appreciates pivoting support from Victini, Magnezone and Scizor. Slowbro and  Slowking can bring in Mega Tyranitar safely with Teleport and offer Future Sight support for Buzzwole. Finally, Spikes from Skarmory and Mew can wear down walls.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Band Tyranitar is a brutally powerful wallbreaker capable of ripping through common defensive staples such as Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Celesteela. Its absurdly powerful Knock Off and Pursuit combined with its excellent special bulk also make it a premier Pursuit trapper capable of dominating common Psychic-types such as Choice Specs Latios and Slowking as well as physically frail foes like Iron Moth and Blissey. Earthquake targets Rock- and Steel-types such as opposing Tyranitar formes and Excadrill. Aerial Ace is an alternative to hit Fighting-types, notably 2HKOing Buzzwole. Assurance is another option, with it becoming a near-unwallable force when paired with entry hazards and synergizing well with Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots. Tyranitar best fits on offense teams looking for a wallbreaker and Pursuit trapper. It is especially effective at removing special walls such as Blissey, making specially attacking teammates such as Choice Specs Latios and Iron Moth great partners. Pivots, notably specially attacking ones such as Slowbro and the aforementioned Iron Moth, can force in special walls and safely bring in Tyranitar. Entry hazard setters such as Excadrill and Skarmory enjoy Tyranitar's ability to break through most hazard removal options, and it greatly appreciates the chip damage they provide in return, especially if it's running Assurance. Tyranitar is dominated by Fighting-types such as Buzzwole and Iron Hands, making checks to them such as Clefable and Latios mandatory teammates. Sand Stream can notably support Sand Rush variants of Excadrill, and as physical wallbreakers, Tyranitar and Excadrill can weaken their shared physically defensive checks like Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth. While Tyranitar matches up well against many special attackers, it falters against a good deal of them such as Alakazam and Thundurus-T due to its weaknesses, making specially defensive tanks such as Assault Vest Tangrowth useful partners.</p>"

Pursuit lets Mega Tyranitar threaten to trap and remove foes such as Tapu Lele Choice locked into Psychic, Iron Moth, and Heatran. Additionally, the threat of Pursuit forces foes like the Tapu Lele to play quite predictably, easing the burden for teammates such as Galarian Slowking not having to fear Psychic-type attacks lest they be trapped by Mega Tyranitar. A solid matchup into common Defoggers like Zapdos and Moltres allows Mega Tyranitar to proficiently set up Stealth Rock, while Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots allows its own entry hazards to incur damage easier. The given Speed EVs allow Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Rotom-W. Iron Valiant is an incredible teammate for Mega Tyranitar, as Mega Tyranitar can trap and inflict heavy damage or outright remove Clodsire and Galarian Slowking, which are two of the biggest roadblocks for Iron Valiant. Defensively, Alomomola is very common teammate, as it can keep Mega Tyranitar healthy with Wish + Flip Turn and sponge attacks from Fighting-types it fears such as Mega Lopunny and Great Tusk. Gliscor can give Mega Tyranitar trouble, as once its Toxic Orb has been activated, it can switch in consistently without fearing the item loss of Knock Off while clearing Stealth Rock with Defog, so Ferrothorn, Urshifu-R, and Ogerpon-W are good teammates to assist combatting it.</p>"

Tyranitar also has the option of running Parting Shot to pivot on its would be switch-ins. Knock Off removes items like Covert Cloak from Pokemon like Toxapex and Gholdengo, which would otherwise block Salt Cure. The listed EV spread lets Tyranitar outrun most variants of Corviknight while having enough special bulk to survive +2 Make It Rain from defensive Gholdengo under Sand, and avoid a 2HKO from Never-Melt Ice Glacial Lance Kyurem on top of checking other special attackers like Skeledirge, Indeedee, and Rotom-H. Threats to Tyranitar include Annihilape, Iron Valiant, Palafin, Gholdengo, and Great Tusk. Tera Water checks Palafin and Gholdengo, while Tera Flying and Fairy check Great Tusk and Iron Valiant. Heavy-Duty Boots avoids entry hazard damage, which can be useful with Tera Flying, while Leftovers increases Tyranitar’s longevity. Tyranitar prefers bulky teammates like Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Rotom-C to patch up its Ground weakness. Physically defensive Toxapex is appreciated to handle the likes of Palafin and Iron Valiant and covers for Tyranitar's Fighting, Water, and Fairy weaknesses while also providing entry removal with Mortal Spin. Offensive Gholdengo is a good teammate, as it blocks entry hazard removal while also being able to throw off powerful attacks and spread status with Infernal Parade and Thunder Wave.

Stone Edge deals huge damage to key Pokemon that Rock-types struggle with such as Corviknight, Celesteela, and Mega Venusaur. Knock Off means that Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Slowbro have to be careful when facing Tyranitar, along with removing valuable items from Toxapex and Empoleon. Fire Punch OHKOes the likes of Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, both of which are threats to Rock teams. Earthquake helps with the Steel, Poison, and Rock mirror matchups by hitting Heatran, Clodsire, and Garganacl with a lot of power. Heavy Slam is also worth mentioning, as it can OHKO the likes of Tapu Bulu and Clefable and helps the Fairy matchup a tremendous amount. Ice Punch is an alternative as well, as it threatens to OHKO foes such as Landorus and Gliscor. Additionally, Tyranitar is able to set up sand, aiding teammates such as Garganacl, Cradilly, and Nihilego with a Special Defense boost. A Jolly nature allows Tyranitar to outspeed Choice Specs Iron Valiant outside of Electric Terrain and Mega Diancie while Sticky Web is up and OHKO both with Heavy Slam. This does, however, cause a loss of power, making the Steel and Poison matchups much harder by not 2HKOing Corviknight and Mega Venusaur with Stone Edge. Shuckle can set up Sticky Web, which allows Tyranitar to outspeed threats such as Gholdengo and Nidoking. Mega Diancie is a great special wallbreaker that Tyranitar needs on its team to deal with the Fighting-types that threaten it such as Kommo-o and Great Tusk. Cradily gives Tyranitar a switch-in to Ground-type moves that can reliably take hits and proceed to use Recover to maintain its health while also setting up Stealth Rock. Choice Scarf Terrakion pairs amazingly with Tyranitar by taking the physical wallbreaking load off of Tyranitar and splitting it between the two powerhouses. Terrakion is able to revenge kill Mega Lopunny while also benefitting from Tyranitar's Pursuit trapping ability. As a wall, Garganacl appreciates Tyranitar removing Leftovers from Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Ting-Lu. Ogerpon-C creates additional pressure in the Ground and Water matchups, complementing Tyranitar's power with great coverage. Nihilego helps with Tyranitar's weakness to Fairy-types, providing great Special Defense in sand, as well as Poison coverage. Although Tyranitar has great bulk, Rhyperior and Omastar are better checks to Scizor, a huge threat to the Rock type. Rhyperior's great bulk and ability allow it to beat Scizor, while Omastar's neutrality to Steel-type moves allows it to beat Scizor one-on-one.</p>"

Flare Blitz and Brave Bird are reliable STAB moves that deal great damage against the majority of the tier. Magic Guard negates recoil from these moves in addition to various forms of passive damage, such as Stealth Rock and poison. V-create is an option that allows Ho-Oh to have more immediate power over Flare Blitz, notably 2HKOing non-Fur Coat neutral Arceus formes, at the cost of lowering Ho-Oh's defenses and Speed after use. Also, V-create only has 8 PP compared to Flare Blitz's 24, which can cause issues in longer games. Fire Lash is another alternative that allows Ho-Oh to pressure passive walls like Dondozo more easily though consecutive Defense drops, eventually forcing these foes out. Tidy Up and Mortal Spin both serve as hazard removal, and each come with their own advantages. Tidy Up allows Ho-Oh to set up and potentially sweep, and it also somewhat mitigates the stat drops from V-create if it is used. Meanwhile, Mortal Spin applies more pressure to opposing walls, with poison helping to wear them down over the course of a game. Alternatively, Head Smash can be used to nearly OHKO Imposter users that lack Eviolite; otherwise, Ho-Oh risks being walled by its Imposter. Furthermore, Head Smash is Ho-Oh's best move to hit Mega Diancie, cleanly 2HKOing it. Strength Sap pairs well with Magic Guard to give Ho-Oh incredible longevity, ensuring that it can serve as a long-term check to opposing Fire- and Fairy-Types like Arceus-Fire, Arceus-Fairy, and Choice Specs Mega Diancie locked into Boomburst. Ho-Oh can struggle to defeat bulky Dragon- and Water-types such as Fur Coat Miraidon and Dondozo, so offensive teammates such as Mega Diancie and Kartana are appreciated. Ho-Oh also enjoys entry hazard and Knock Off support to push checks into 2HKO range, as well as allowing Head Smash variants to defeat Imposter users more easily. Ho-Oh can be Imposter-proofed by the aforementioned Fur Coat Miraidon and Dondozo, as well as by Fur Coat Arceus formes, although they should all ideally have some move to punish the Imposter user from simply staying in and setting up.</p>"

Haze clears stat boosts from setup sweepers like No Retreat users and Arceus formes. Ho-Oh serves as a good user of Mortal Spin with its STAB moves threatening out Steel-types. Glare cripples Magic Guard Mega Mewtwo X on V-create sets. Knock Off removes important items like Covert Cloak and Eviolite from switch-ins like Miraidon and Imposter users, respectively. Teleport is an option to generate momentum and allow Ho-Oh to safely bring in allies against threats it cannot take on, such as certain Take Heart Arceus formes. Ho-Oh is threatened by certain special attackers such as Mega Diancie with a Rock-type move, Palkia-O, and Primal Kyogre; as a result, teammates such as Arceus-Poison and RegenVest Primal Kyogre make good partners. Ho-Oh also can have trouble against bulky setup Pokemon such as Miraidon and Take Heart Arceus formes, making Pokemon like Dialga-O, Salt Cure users, and Covert Cloak Imposter users good teammates. Fur Coat Dialga-O, Arceus-Poison, and Arceus-Ghost help check physical wallbreakers that break past Ho-Oh and can also absorb Knock Off, which is useful considering that Ho-Oh ceases functioning as a wall without its item. Ho-Oh can be Imposter-proofed by Pokemon like Fur Coat + Take Heart Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Ghost, though a Fire-immune Steel-type like Primordial Sea Registeel can be used to block the Imposter user's Mortal Spin.</p>"

Flip Turn allows Swampert to function as a slow pivot and bring another teammate in safely against Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Clefable, and Slowbro. Toxic cripples Defoggers like Rotom-W and Salamence and walls like Slowbro, Tangrowth, and Gastrodon. Yawn is an alternative that can discourage setup sweepers like Calm Mind Latias or Clefable from taking advantage of Swampert, and it synergizes well with Flip Turn and entry hazards by forcing the opposing Pokemon to switch out and surrender momentum. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs is used to ensure Swampert is as slow as possible, letting it use Flip Turn after the opposing Pokemon attacks. Swampert fits best on offensive teams looking for a pivot that can set up Stealth Rock and safely bring in frail wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Latios against walls like Slowbro. Pivots like Victini and Thundurus-T can create VoltTurn cores and enjoy Swampert bringing them in against Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Celesteela. Celesteela in particular appreciates Swampert's Electric immunity and ability to check Victini, Rotom-W, and Zeraora; in return, Celesteela deals with Grass-types that annoy Swampert like Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Tapu Bulu.

The latter two are especially notable since they can Pursuit trap Slowbro, and all of them enjoy Swampert's ability to keep entry hazards up and maximize their wallbreaking potential. Finally, Swampert is very reliant on Leftovers to check threats like Excadrill as it lacks other forms of recovery, making Knock Off absorbers like Mega Tyranitar, Mega Venusaur, and Z-Move Hydreigon great partners.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Mega Swampert is a staple on rain teams thanks to its great typing and Swift Swim allowing it to outspeed a majority of the metagame. Its immunity to Electric-type moves is greatly appreciated for rain teams, which can struggle with common Electric-types in the tier such as Raging Bolt and Tapu Koko. Flip Turn allows it to maintain momentum against checks like Rotom-W and Alomomola while wearing them down. Ice Punch hits Pokemon such as Dragonite, Serperior, and Mega Latias that would check Mega Swampert otherwise. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used to take advantage of forced switches on Pokemon such as Garganacl and Galarian Slowking, as well as free up a slot for a teammate like Ferrothorn to run Spikes over Stealth Rock. Superpower is another option, which hits checks such as Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Ogerpon-W. As the premier rain setter in the tier, Pelipper is a mandatory teammate for Mega Swampert, being able to grant it free switches with its ability to act as a slow pivot with U-turn. Ferrothorn is another especially good teammate for Mega Swampert for its ability to switch into the defensive Water-types Mega Swampert has trouble dealing with such as Alomomola, Slowbro, and Rotom-W as well as Ogerpon-W lacking Superpower, and it can also make progress by setting hazards and forcing switches against these foes. Ferrothorn is also able to remove items like Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Skarmory, letting Mega Swampert attack more freely, and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Alomomola, making them more easily worn down by hazards. Mega Swampert can also struggle against Grass-types such as Kartana and Rillaboom, which makes Pokemon like Zapdos and Tornadus-T great teammates for their ability to check the aforementioned Pokemon. Mega Swampert also appreciates other Swift Swim users such as Barraskewda as teammates, being able to wear down each others' shared checks such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Archaludon is a good partner, being able to check Grass- and Water-types Mega Swampert has trouble with such as Alomomola, Ogerpon-W, and Serperior. In return, Mega Swampert threatens Ground-types that Archaludon struggles with like Landorus-T and Gliscor.</p>"

Mirror Coat can grab a surprise OHKO on problematic targets like Flutter Mane, but its reliance on prediction makes it inconsistent.

          "description": "<p>Swampert is the best offensive Stealth Rock setter available to Water teams thanks to its great bulk and access to Flip Turn. Its partial Ground typing is also excellent, granting it an Electric immunity which notably lets it block Volt Switch from common threats such as Zapdos, Iron Treads, and Iron Hands. STAB Earthquake strikes fear into the heart of bulky Pokemon that often annoy Water such as Clodsire, Alolan Muk, and Gouging Fire while boasting decent neutral damage even with low investment. Alternatively, Earth Power deals less neutral damage but allows Swampert to lure annoying physical tanks like Archaludon, Torkoal, and Pecharunt and surprise them with a 2HKO. Flip Turn allows Swampert to pivot out of common switch-ins like Amoonguss, Skarmory, and Latios and act as a pivot for frailer teammates. Flip Turn's damage also shouldn't be underestimated; boosts from it being a STAB move, rain, and potentially Torrent can make it a nasty parting gift. As an example, a Flip Turn with all of those multipliers active has a chance to OHKO Gliscor after Stealth Rock. Swampert can set up Stealth Rock itself, providing critical entry hazard support for a type with somewhat limited options for the role; this also lets it break Focus Sash on major threats that use it such as Breloom. Since its STAB combination is excellent on its own, Swampert is free to run a utility move of choice in the last moveslot: Roar lets it rack up passive damage against the opposing team after setting up Stealth Rock and phaze some setup sweepers that it can't threaten to KO, such as Calm Mind Primarina and IronPress Skarmory. Protect lets Swampert make the most of Leftovers recovery while scouting Choice item users such as Choice Band Chien-Pao and Choice Specs Flutter Mane, making them easier to play around. Knock Off gives Swampert extra coverage against foes like Latios and lets it remove Heavy-Duty Boots from its switch-ins, forcing them to take Stealth Rock damage and thus making them easier to outlast. The given EV spread maximizes Swampert's ability to take special hits, achieving such feats as avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Specs Iron Valiant's Moonblast after Stealth Rock and surviving 4x super effective hits like Hydrapple's Giga Drain. 24 Attack EVs guarantee that Earthquake will always 2HKO Garganacl after Stealth Rock damage, as well as OHKO Excadrill, and 2HKO bulky Gouging Fire. On Earth Power sets, use a Calm nature and move the Attack EVs into Special Attack.</p> <p>Since its typing and Stealth Rock make it universally useful to Water, Swampert is highly flexible in what teams it can fit on. Swords Dance Ogerpon-W is a quintessential teammate that enjoys entry hazard support to wear down its checks before a sweep. Empoleon is great for checking Grass-type attackers that threaten Swampert, like Amoonguss and Abomasnow, and discouraging Freeze-Dry spam from Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales; its STAB Flash Cannon also threatens Hatterene and Galarian Weezing, both of which can frustrate Swampert's attempts to set up Stealth Rock. Toxapex is an even sturdier Grass-type check that can deal with Meowscarada and Ogerpon formes, and it stacks hazards with Swampert in the form of Toxic Spikes. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott can check some threats that annoy Swampert like Slowbro, Latios, and Air Balloon Gholdengo while also contributing Spikes. Calm Mind Primarina is a potent wincon that can deal with offensive Dark- and Dragon-types like Chien-Pao and Dragonite, which tend to overwhelm Swampert, and it enjoys Swampert pressuring common special walls, most notably Clodsire. Choice Specs Greninja especially can tear massive holes in the opposing team with help from Swampert's Stealth Rock, and its coverage threatens common hazard-control options like Hatterene, Great Tusk, and Brambleghast. Keldeo can threaten some Rapid Spin users that Swampert has trouble with like Great Tusk, Avalugg, and Alolan Sandslash, and it enjoys Flip Turn support to hit the field safely; other frail offensive threats like Greninja, Barraskewda, and Cloyster love Swampert's reliable ability to pivot as well. Other pivots like Rotom-W, Pelipper, Barraskewda, and Urshifu-R can form an oppressive VoltTurn core with Swampert, continuously wearing down foes in conjunction with entry hazards. Volcanion can punish Grass- and Ice-types similarly to Empoleon while discouraging Corviknight and Forretress from spending a turn on hazard removal with its Fire-type STAB move.</p>"

Earthquake nails Water-resistant foes like Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra, and Water Absorb Clodsire as well as Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Iron Hands, and Zeraora. Furthermore, with sufficient chip damage, it's capable of overwhelming Ferrothorn and Gastrodon. Waterfall is nicely complemented by rain as it outdamages Ice Punch when combatting Flying-types like Zapdos and Corviknight. Waterfall is notably preferred over Liquidation due to its higher PP and potential to break through walls, such as the aforementioned Corviknight, via flinching. Ice Punch targets Dragon- and Grass-types like Dragonite, Latias, and Tapu Bulu due to their resistances to Mega Swampert's STAB combination. Flip Turn allows Mega Swampert to escape unfavorable situations and form pivoting cores with teammates like Pelipper, Greninja, and Barraskewda. Alternatively, Stealth Rock may be used to take advantage of Mega Swampert's ability to force switches, while other options such as Stone Edge and Toxic may be used to threaten Mantine, Pelipper, and Rotom-W which wall it otherwise. A Jolly nature is preferred to outpace Choice Scarf Thundurus-T, Volcarona after one Quiver Dance, and opposing Mega Swampert. However, an Adamant nature may be used for higher damage rolls against Kommo-o, Mega Venusaur, and Gastrodon. Pelipper is a perfect teammate, as it provides rain with Drizzle, slowly pivots into Mega Swampert with U-turn, and removes entry hazards with Defog. In return, Mega Swampert provides an immunity against the aforementioned Electric-type moves and threatens Rock-types such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie. Toxapex provides a buffer against Grass-types like Rillaboom and Meowscarada as well as Kommo-o while also providing Toxic Spikes to enhance Mega Swampert's wallbreaking capabilities. Furthermore, Toxapex appreciates Mega Swampert forcing out Heatran and Gholdengo, as they easily take advantage of Toxapex's passivity. Urshifu-R and Barraskewda deal with threats like Ferrothorn, Hydreigon, and Kyurem, while Mega Swampert removes Toxapex and Water Absorb Clodsire. Other Swift Swim users like Basculegion-F and Barraskewda take on threats like Slowbro and Tapu Koko outside of rain, respectively. Greninja provides speed control outside of rain and beats Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu and Alolan Ninetales with Gunk Shot as well as overloads shared Water-resistant foes like Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur with a Choice Specs set. Empoleon is a good teammate as it can free up Mega Swampert's Stealth Rock moveslot and switch into Freeze-Dry users like Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales.</p>"

It has a good matchup against common special attackers like Miraidon, Eternatus, and Blacephalon. Knock Off is a useful utility move, removing items like Imposter Chansey's Eviolite, Miraidon's Covert Cloak, and Primal Kyogre's Assault Vest. Stone Axe can be used to set up Stealth Rock, and threaten physically frail Pokemon like Mega Beedrill and Blacephalon, while Mortal Spin can be used for entry hazard removal, and in conjunction with Knock Off, poison walls that would otherwise be immune thanks to Covert Cloak, like Miraidon and Ice Scales Primal Kyogre. Mega Swampert is a particularly good user of this Mortal Spin thanks to hitting Steel-types like Mega Steelix and Dialga-O with its Ground-type STAB move. Mega Swampert is mainly used as a special wall and slow pivot, making teammates such as Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Diancie suitable partners. Despite its good special bulk being further boosted by Assault Vest, its physical bulk is middling at best, meaning common mixed attackers like Mega Mewtwo X and Deoxys-A largely don't have trouble with it. Therefore, Fur Coat Miraidon and Ice Scales Arceus-Fairy are nice defensive options.

Surf threatens a number of common Stealth Rock setters such as Gliscor, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T with OHKOs in rain, while Hurricane covers Grass-types like Meowscarada and Serperior while also dealing more damage to Hisuian Samurott. Knock Off can be run instead of Hurricane to cripple foes like Galarian Slowking, making them easier for its teammates to break through. A Speed-reducing nature in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs gives Pelipper its slowest possible U-turn, allowing it to safely bring in teammates to make use of its rain. A physically defensive EV spread lets Pelipper easily handle physical threats like Hisuian Samurott and Zamazenta, running enough Special Defense EVs to guarantee take on Enamorus's Moonblast after Stealth Rock. On the other hand, a specially defensive spread can be used to take less damage from special attackers that would otherwise take advantage of Pelipper's poor Special Defense, such as Gholdengo and Enamorus, as well as avoiding an OHKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor, while running enough Defense EVs to survive two Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge from full. The corresponding negative nature alongside 0 Speed IVs give Pelipper the slowest possible U-turn to bring its teammate in safely, and underspeeding uninvested Tyranitar and the niche Hippowdon allow its rain to override their sand when leading against them. Though Pelipper is rarely Terastallized, Tera Ground can be used to remove its 4x weakness to Electric-type moves from Raging Bolt and Zapdos and safely pivot out of them.</p> <p>Pelipper should be used exclusively on rain teams where it is commonly partnered with powerful wallbreakers like Barraskewda, which is greatly enabled by Swift Swim activation, and Raging Bolt, which benefits from Water-type Weather Ball to break through Ground-types.

Because Damp Rock is needed to maximize the number of rain turns, Pelipper appreciates having a teammate that can switch into Knock Off, such as Kingambit, especially if its Air Balloon has been popped. Due to its 4x weakness to Electric-type moves, Pelipper enjoys Ground-type teammates like Iron Treads that can easily switch into the likes of Raging Bolt.

Hurricane is the STAB move of choice, bypassing the accuracy check in rain while nailing Water-resistant Grass-types, such as Amoonguss, Meowscarada, and Breloom. Roost allows Pelipper to come in multiple times throughout the match to re-set rain if need be. U-turn let's it slow pivot into threats such as Quaquaval and Barraskewda. Knock Off cripples foes, while Surf gives a secondary STAB move boosted by rain, allowing Pelipper to wear down Pokemon like Gholdengo and Kingambit. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to switch in and set rain even if Stealth Rock is up.

It also appreciates Pelipper's slow pivoting with U-turn due to its lack of bulk. Walking Wake is another great rain attacker, since its STAB Dragon-type moves hit most Water-resistant and immune foes, such as opposing Gastrodon and Amoonguss, hard. Quaquaval appreciates Pelipper's slow pivoting to come in safely and can potentially snowball through teams with rain-boosted Aqua Step and Moxie. Quaquaval can also get rid of entry hazards should Pelipper get hit by Knock Off, provided it has Rapid Spin. Gastrodon and Quagsire are also really good partners thanks to their Electric immunities. Both also provide entry hazards, pressuring opponents, and Pelipper can use hazard removal turns to pivot out with U-turn or heal with Roost. Rotom-W can form a VoltTurn core with Pelipper, allowing the team to gain momentum easily and bring in Pokemon fairly safely. Rotom-W can also switch into opposing Electric-types like Magnezone, Iron Hands, and Sandy Shocks if necessary. Toxapex provides a Fighting resistance, a Grass neutrality, and another pivot thanks to its ability, Regenerator. Slowking checks threats such as Indeedee and Walking Wake, and it's another slow pivot thanks to Chilly Reception and Regenerator, bringing Pelipper in safely to set the rain. Both Toxapex and Slowking can also easily pivot into Pelipper with Eject Button, since Regenerator means they won't lose too much health from an attack. Azumarill can take advantage of rain with priority in Aqua Jet, as well as bringing a very strong Water-type STAB move.</p>"

          "description": "<p>The ability Drizzle and access to U-turn allow Pelipper to be the best rain setter in the tier, thus a staple on rain teams. 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature allow Pelipper to pivot teammates in safely with the slowest possible U-turn. Its decent physical bulk alongside Scald lets Pelipper check and threaten to cripple popular offensive presences like Urshifu-R and Mega Lopunny, as well as Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Heatran. Roost keeps Pelipper healthy throughout the course of the game, enabling consistent rain and better longevity against threats such as Urshifu-R. Hurricane can be used to hit foes such as Urshifu-R, Tera Grass Heatran, and most notably, Ogerpon-W, for super effective damage, while Defog is an alternative that removes entry hazards if common partners in Tornadus-T or Zapdos lack it. Tera Ground is used to change Pelipper's 4x weakness to Electric into an immunity to potentially absorb Volt Switch from Tapu Koko or Rotom-W and pivot out. Pokemon that need rain to boost their strength and Speed such as Mega Swampert, Barrsekwda, Battle Bond Greninja, and Urshifu-R are great partners for Pelipper. They particularly appreciate Pelipper being able to bring them onto the field safely and often into a winning position via a slow U-turn. Mega Swampert also serves as a bulky Electric-immune Pokemon that can check Tapu Koko for Pelipper. Other Pokemon like Zapdos and Tornadus-T also benefit from the rain Pelipper sets up and can act both as excellent wallbreakers or entry hazard removers. Furthermore, Ferrothorn and Archaludon can take advantage of Pelipper's typing defensively, with the latter's signature move in Electro Shot pairing especially well with rain.</p>"

Tera Blast Steel lets Masquerain beat targets such as Carbink and Articuno reliably, as well as set up more easily on targets like Gogoat and Misdreavus that can otherwise threaten it with coverage.

Grass-types like Gogoat can switch into some Electric-types like Electrode and Pokemon like Whiscash that may threaten Masquerain with Rock-type coverage; they also pressure Pokemon like Carbink better alongside Masquerain. In return, Masquerain can pressure targets like Charizard and Articuno depending on its Tera type.

Hurricane is Masquerain's normal STAB move of choice, allowing it to hit Pokemon such as Gogoat and opposing Masquerain for good damage. However, Bug Buzz can be used instead, hitting mostly the same targets as Hurricane and being more accurate at the cost of power. Hydro Pump is coverage for Fire-types such as Charizard and Carkol, as well as Carbink and Alolan-Dugtrio, although Surf can be used instead of Hydro Pump, trading off power for accuracy. Masquerain's fourth moveslot is very flexible; U-turn can be used to pivot into a partner Pokemon after setting up Sticky Web and Quiver Dance can make Masquerain more offensively threatening after setting up Sticky Web. Ice Beam can OHKO Dartrix and Gabite, but it is hard to fit, as Masquerain normally finds more usage out of U-turn and Quiver Dance. Masquerain can Terastallize into the Ghost type to prevent spinners such as Quaxwell and Carkol from removing its Sticky Web. Masquerain can also run Heavy-Duty Boots to ease Sticky Web setup later in the game at the cost of being a less effective lead, as well as run Tera Steel for easier setup with Quiver Dance if spinblocking is not a concern.</p> <p>Masquerain's most common teammates are ones that take advantage of Sticky Web slowing down their grounded offensive checks, so wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Zangoose, Squawkabilly, and Choice Band Basculin-B are great partners. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Banette spinblock for Masquerain to keep Sticky Web on the field, and Sticky Web allows them to spread status more easily to normally faster threats such as opposing Basculin-B. Electric- and Rock-types such as Raichu and Choice Scarf Lycanroc-N help deal with the Flying-types that annoy Masquerain and its teammates, such as Rotom-S, as they are immune to Sticky Web.</p>"

Spore gives Breloom setup opportunities and impedes otherwise major threats to the team such as Flying-types like Corviknight and Pelipper and Poison-types such as Toxapex, Iron Moth, and Clodsire. Focus Sash guarantees it can use Spore at least once—provided Breloom can keep itself at full HP—and also gives Breloom the opportunity to use Swords Dance as well. Bullet Seed is a fantastic STAB move that threatens Water-types like Dondozo and Quagsire. Mach Punch provides Breloom with a super strong STAB move with priority to not only circumvent its below average Speed but also threatens faster Pokemon such as Meowscarada, Iron Treads, and Cyclizar. Swords Dance allows Breloom to not only power up its STAB moves but takes advantage of the setup opportunities that Spore can provide. Bulldoze, however, can apply pressure to Poison-types such as Skuntank and Toxapex while also putting the foe at a potential Speed disadvantage.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Paldean Tauros-F and Lucario appreciate Breloom's ability to potentially impede their checks such as Toxapex, Dondozo, and Quagsire, giving them ample setup opportunities. Paldean Tauros-F handles the Dark matchup fairly easily thanks to it avoiding being burned by Sableye while also resisting Meowscarada's and Chien-Pao's STAB moves. Lucario can threaten Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant with its STAB Bullet Punch. Assault Vest Iron Hands is another great partner that can handle the special attacking Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene while also handling Flying-types such as Dragonite and Iron Jugulis which could otherwise threaten Breloom out. Entry hazard control from Great Tusk is imperative to allow Breloom to keep its Focus Sash intact. Great Tusk also helps Breloom by providing Stealth Rock, which racks up chip damage with the switches Breloom can force. Gallade is a great partner that can threaten Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Toxapex. Iron Valiant is another fantastic partner for Breloom, providing Future Sight support to ward off the Poison-types that like to switch into both of Breloom's STAB moves.

Besides boosting Mach Punch, Technician provides Grass teams with powerful Rock-type coverage in its Rock Tomb. These two moves and Focus Sash allow Breloom to handle an assortment of major threats to grass teams, including Volcarona, Chien-Pao, Iron Jugulis, Kilowattrel, Choice Specs Greninja, and Kingambit. With Bullet Seed or Close Combat, it also can function as a good wallbreaker. Spore is an amazing utility move to stop threats and force out Pokemon like Skeledirge. However, with the use of other Spore users like Amoonguss and Toedscruel, Spore can be replaced with Swords Dance. With it, Breloom can set up when opponents predict it will use Spore, increasing its late-game cleaning potential. An Adamant nature is standard, but Jolly Breloom can outspeed Adamant Dragonite, Adamant Cetitan, and Choice Specs Pelipper.</p> <p>Other offensive teammates like Meowscarada and Rotom-C benefit from Breloom forcing out threats with Spore or breaking through Pokemon like Toxapex, Corviknight, or Ting-lu with its high Attack stat and Spore. In exchange, Meowscarada handles Psychic-types such as Gallade and Espathra. Setup Pokemon like Substitute Rotom-C work especially well with Breloom, as they can come in freely on a slept enemy or a physical wall Breloom draws in. The type's more passive defensive Pokemon also support Breloom, with Amoonguss dealing with Fairy-types and Wo-Chien, by using Leech Seed on a foe, allowing chipped Breloom to switch in and restore its Focus Sash protection. Breloom also enjoys Spikes or Toxic Spikes Brambleghast or Toedscruel to chip foes into KO range, including Toxapex and Iron Hands after a Swords Dance. Aurora Veil from Abomasnow can increase Breloom's chances to set up with Swords Dance. Breloom is weak against bulkier Pokemon with multi-hit moves, which can instantly KO it through Focus Sash, like Icicle Spear from Baxcalibur. Thus, entry hazards to wear them down and physical walls, like Body Press Abomasnow, are very important. Once chipped, Breloom's frailty and low Speed make it weak to faster priority users and to other offensive Pokemon not bothered by Mach Punch. To handle the latter, such as Flutter Mane and Paldean Tauros-B, faster teammates like Choice Scarf Meoscarada and Rotom-C can be very helpful.</p>"

Sableye also blanket checks many setup sweepers in the tier as well, such as Dudunsparce, Ursaring, Coil Sandaconda, and Coil Eelektross, with Encore. Knock Off allows Sableye to punish Pokemon that may rely on their items for their bulk or longevity on a switch such as Hisuian Qwilfish, Eelektross, Ursaring, and Bombirdier. Foul Play is a reliable source of damage against physical setup sweepers, such as Scyther and Bruxish, over options such as Knock Off or Will-O-Wisp. Tera Poison gives Sableye an immunity to Toxic and a resistance to Fairy while retaining its positive matchup into Fighting-types. Tera Steel has a similar function but instead retains Sableye's favorable matchup into Psychic-types while giving it some additional resistances to common attacking types such as Ice from Pokemon like Abomasnow. Tera Dark is notable for letting Sableye OHKO Pokemon such as Rotom and Bruxish with Knock Off while providing Sableye with a Ghost resistance.</p> <p>Sableye struggles with the tier's myriad of Dark-types such as Cacturne and Bombirdier, which all ignore Prankster, while Tera Dark users such as Toxicroak, Hisuian Sneasel, and Bruxish can also Terastallize to completely ignore Sableye and use it as setup fodder. To help alleviate this issue, Pokemon like Hisuian Qwilfish, Carbink, Articuno, and Appletun can all help answer these threats. In addition, Sableye is fairly passive in nature with horrible special bulk, which means it can invite special wallbreakers such as Clawitzer and Glaceon.

Knock Off is used for its ability to remove items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from targets like Celesteela and Enamorus, causing them to be worn down more easily. Will-O-Wisp allows Mega Sableye to cripple physical attackers such as Excadrill and Iron Hands with a burn. It can also be used against Pokemon unbothered by Knock Off like Mega Venusaur to slowly wear them down. The final moveslot is typically given to Protect, allowing Mega Sableye to safely get its Mega Evolution off as well as scout the intentions of Choice item users like Enamorus and Keldeo. Toxic is an alternative to status Pokemon that do not mind Will-O-Wisp like Victini and Nasty Plot Hydreigon. Prankster is chosen as the pre-Mega ability on Sableye, allowing it to burn a boosted physical threat in case of emergency. Mega Sableye struggles with strong special attackers, and as such appreciates specially defensive teammates like Blissey, Ting-Lu, and Gastrodon. Its lack of passive recovery in tandem with Recover’s meagre PP means it can get worn down by repeated hits and chip damage from sand. Therefore, Wish passers like Blissey and Clefable will greatly improve its longevity. Mega Sableye can get statused through Magic Bounce by moves like Sludge Bomb and Scald and thus appreciates cleric support from Chansey or Clefable. Pokemon like Clefable and Mold Breaker Excadrill can effectively set up hazards against Mega Sableye. As such, backup hazard control from Pokemon like Skarmory and Mandibuzz can prove helpful.</p>"

Taunt lets it shut down set up attempts from Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Bulk Up Corviknight or hinder opposing defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex and Clodsire. Taunt also blocks entry hazards from going up, which is huge for Dark due to its lack of entry hazard control. Alternatively, Encore lets Sableye halt the aforementioned setup attempts and gain more momentum from them. Knock Off capitalizes on the switches that Sableye forces by knocking off crucial items from Pokemon such as Toxapex or Dondozo. Alternatively, Night Shade deals steady damage throughout the game. Finally, Recover gives Sableye longevity to continually check the aforementioned threats. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Sableye come in and out without worrying about residual damage from entry hazards.</p> <p>Some great teammates for Sableye include Skuntank and Kingambit, as both of them boast a critical neutrality to Fairy that lets them take hits such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant's and Flutter Mane's Moonblasts and force both out.

Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Ting-Lu lets Mega Mawile KO faster threats with Sucker Punch after a Swords Dance and chip damage, such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Mega Swampert, and Garchomp. It also appreciates pivot support from Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W to enter the field safely. Since Mega Mawile is relatively frail, partners such as Landorus-T and Garchomp provide strong defensive checks to common threats in Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Heatran.</p>"

Pure Power gives Medicham an edge over Passimian, one of its main sources of competition, by allowing its Close Combat to 2HKO bulky foes like Vaporeon before Terastallization. Zen Headbutt's Base Power is good against foes like Tera Fairy Chansey, but Psycho Cut is an alternative that doesn't make contact, which helps against Rocky Helmet users, Drifblim, and Poison Point Qwilfish. Thunder Punch and Ice Punch hit Bruxish and Sandaconda respectively, and Flying-types like Drifblim and Oricorio-F. Trick punishes defensive switch-ins like Sandaconda and is especially beneficial to use against bulky teams, since they are generally slower than Medicham anyway. Tera Fighting enhances Medicham's wallbreaking and cleaning potential by powering up Close Combat, and it lets Medicham resist Toxicroak and Bombirdier's Sucker Punch. Partners that commonly run Choice Scarf, such as Zoroark and Rotom, can revenge kill foes instead of Medicham early-on, keeping its set a mystery. Zoroark can also use Illusion to lure in and eliminate Ghost-types, which reduces how many predictions Medicham needs to make, while Rotom checks Flying-types and blanks Sandaconda and Choice Scarf Toxicroak.</p>"

Zen Headbutt is a powerful STAB option that hits Poison-types like Qwilfish and Muk, as they can easily take a Close Combat. Psycho Cut is a weaker alternative that avoids contact effects like Poison Point and Rocky Helmet from the likes of Qwilfish and Sandaconda. Trailblaze allows Medicham to pull off sweeps and patch up its offensive shortcoming in its middling Speed. Trick is used with Choice Band to cripple walls such as Drifblim and Tera Fairy users like Chansey and Umbreon. Ice Punch is great neutral coverage for walls like Drifblim and Sandaconda. Tera Fighting gives Choice Band sets a favorable roll to KO Sandaconda after minimal chip or a single layer of Spikes. Tera Steel allows Medicham to defensively check fast revenge killers like Scyther and Zangoose on top of boosting Bullet Punch's damage output. Medicham struggles against bulky Ghost-types like Drifblim and Rotom, which makes Zoroark, Choice Scarf Rotom, and Haunter great offensive partners. Special sweepers like Dudunsparce, Oricorio, and Jolteon appreciate Medicham's ability to break past Chansey, Umbreon, and Vaporeon. Medicham also enjoys pivots like Scyther, Rotom, and Eelektross; it especially likes the latter two, which threaten out Sandaconda, Qwilfish, and Drifblim.</p>"

Fake Out lets Mega Medicham chip down and revenge kill Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Koko. It also can let Mega Medicham stall out rain, Toxic, and Terrain on foes, all while putting opponents into range for one of its stronger attacks safely. Ice Punch lets Mega Medicham get rid of Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Dragonite, which can enable it to freely use its STAB moves. Bullet Punch can be used to snipe Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Diancie, and Weavile, and it also removes revenge killers like Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny after chip damage. Due to Mega Medicham’s frailty and mediocre Speed tier, it is easily revenge killed by threats such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. Defensive partners like Ferrothorn and Alomomola help check these threats. Knock Off and Pursuit users like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile also support Mega Medicham, as they break through Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon Mega Medicham struggle with, such as Slowbro, Victini, Reuniclus, and Skeledirge, allowing it to consistently use its STAB attacks. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn benefit Mega Medicham, as it forces a lot of switches and entry hazards wear down its checks quickly. Tapu Koko is a good partner for Mega Medicham, as it handles Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Slowbro reliably and can pivot it in on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Heatran, giving Mega Medicham opportunities to wallbreak. Tapu Lele can also be a good partner for Mega Medicham, as it powers up Zen Headbutt to insane levels, but blocking Fake Out and Bullet Punch from being used on grounded foes can be problematic. Pokemon like Volcarona, Kartana, and the aforementioned Tapu Koko appreciate Tornadus-T, Skeledirge, and Gliscor being pressured constantly by Mega Medicham, enabling them to wreak havoc once the checks are removed or chipped.</p>"

Body Press allows Torkoal uses Torkoal's high Defense to heavily damage the likes of Kingambit, Blissey, and Tyranitar, as well as preventing Roaring Moon and Hydreigon from setting up freely. Alternatively, Yawn can be used to force a switch, allowing Torkoal to freely bring a teammate that can benefit from the sun. Heat Rock provides more turns of sun for allies to benefit from, but Heavy-Duty Boots greatly increases Torkoal's longevity. If using the latter, getting fewer turns of sun also allows Fire teams to better manage opposing Protosynthesis sweepers, such as Flutter Mane or Sandy Shocks.</p> <p>Thanks to Chlorophyll and its unique typing, Scovillain pairs well with Torkoal, as the sun allows it to outspeed and KO foes such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Quaquaval. Choice Specs Scovillian can significantly damage to Toxapex with Solar Beam and even 2HKO Clodsire in the sun with Flamethrower. Cinderace is another wallbreaker that thrives under the sun and appreciates Stealth Rock chipping at the opposing team. It can run Court Change, allowing for more entry hazard control if you're running Heat Rock Torkoal, or use a Choice Scarf to defeat foes like Flutter Mane and Choice Specs Greninja. Iron Moth can use sun and Fire Blast to OHKO foes such as Iron Jugulis and Sableye. Ceruledge scares out Flutter Mane, which can otherwise become problematic due to Power Gem and Protosynthesis boosting its Speed in sun. Thanks to its great defensive stats and Unaware, Skeledirge is an amazing partner for Torkoal, handling setup sweepers such as Curse Dondozo and Belly Drum Azumarill for it. Also, sun weakens Water-type moves for Skeledirge and boosts its Torch Song. Rotom-H can tank special hits Torkoal can't withstand from the likes of Iron Valiant, as well as providing a valuable Ground immunity, which allows it to come in on foes such as Clodsire, Sandy Shocks, and Ting-Lu. Volcarona can dismantle Dark-type teams and occasionally weaken physical attackers thanks to Flame Body.</p>"

Mega Altaria perfers to have Natural Cure instead of Cloud Nine to avoid status from targets like Mew and Gastrodon. This given EV spread allows Mega Altaria to outspeed Alakazam at +1. Mega Altaria can have a hard time breaking through some Poison- and Steel-types like Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, Celesteela, and Skarmory, making offensive Fire-types like Victini and Iron Moth good supporting teammates.

Mega Altaria appreciates entry hazard removal options and entry hazard setters, notably suicide leads on hyper offense teams like Excadrill, as well as Salamence on offense teams, which can help to keep Mega Altaria healthy and make it easier to sweep. Stealth Rock chip also enables Mega Altaria to guarantee an OHKO like Mega Latias. In return, Mega Altaria can help against their checks like Buzzwole, Mega Latias, and Galarian Zapdos.

Close Combat hits Steel-types like Perserrker and Tinkatuff that could come in on Facade, as well as being its best tool against Carbink. Night Slash catches Ghost-types like Misdreavus and Banette that would otherwise switch into Zangoose safely and punishes Tera Ghost from Pokemon like Gabite and Whiscash. Quick Attack lets Zangoose kill fast Pokemon like Charizard, Raichu, and Choice Scarf Rotom-F. Swords Dance turns Zangoose into an even more powerful breaker, OHKOing foes like Tinkatuff and Dachsbun at +2, at the cost of being unable to deal with faster Pokemon, making it a good choice against bulkier teams that lack faster Pokemon. Protect lets Zangoose scout Choice Scarf users like Lycanroc-N and Rotom-F as well as consistently activate Toxic Orb, but it is much less consistent overall than the other two options. Toxic Orb is the only item that can activate Toxic Boost on Zangoose, which pairs wonderfully with Facade. Tera Normal gives Zangoose a solid boost of power on Facade and Quick Attack, which is especially useful on sets lacking Swords Dance. It also gives Zangoose an easier time KOing frail, faster Pokemon like Pyroar and Houndoom.</p> <p>Zangoose suffers heavily from the chip damage it accrues, so ways to mitigate this are helpful. Dachsbun is useful for its ability to pass Wish to Zangoose, helping it stay alive and break for a longer time; it is also useful for coming in on Pokemon that force Zangoose out like Alolan Persian and Choice Scarf Lycanroc-N. Fast Taunt users like Electrode and Pyroar can prevent entry hazards from foes like Perserrker and Tinkatuff, limiting the amount of chip damage that Zangoose takes. Electrode can also bring Zangoose in on its checks, like Gogoat and Dunsparce, to help it break. Offensive partners like Sawsbuck and Indeedee-F can help Zangoose overwhelm shared checks like Misdreavus and Tinkatuff, and Indeedee-F's Healing Wish is useful for giving Zangoose more chances to break, although Psychic Terrain from Indeedee-F pairs poorly with Zangoose's Quick Attack. Zangoose also benefits heavily from Sticky Web from Pokemon like Spidops and Masquerain, as being able to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Golduck and other fast Pokemon like Alolan Dugtrio is a massive boon for it.</p>"

However, even though Spikes don't affect the aforementioned Pokemon, it does better at hitting Rock-resistant threats such as Tinkatuff, Gabite, and Alolan Dugtrio. Earthquake can be used over Earth Power for the slightly higher damage, especially against special setup sweepers like Calm Mind Spiritomb and Wyrdeer, but Earth Power is generally preferred for inflicting better damage on physical walls like Klawf, Perrserker, and Alolan Persian and being unaffected by Grassy Terrain set by Thwackey, a common switch-in to Whiscash. Ice Beam is great for doing a chunk of damage on Grass-types like Gogoat, Flapple, and Dartrix. Surf is an option over Ice Beam, landing better damage on neutral targets instead of the previously mentioned foes. Stone Edge is great in the last slot to cover the likes of Charizard, as well as preventing setup sweepers like Rotom-F and Masquerain from taking advantage of Whiscash's relative passivity. Stealth Rock can be opted for instead to compress both forms of entry hazards into one Pokemon, possibly freeing up another team slot. Protect is used for scouting and gaining a bit more Leftovers recovery, but it is not very useful when running the more popular Heavy-Duty Boots. Oblivious allows Whiscash to set up hazards even against Taunt users like Alolan Persian and Misdreavus. Tera Poison is great for removing Whiscash's 4x weakness to Grass, with the added benefit letting it absorb Toxic Spikes. Tera Ghost turns it into a spinblocker in a pinch. The EV spread focuses on Special Defense over Defense because it makes for a better matchup against Volt Switch users like Rotom-F, as well as other special attackers like Alolan Persian and Fire-types like Charizard.</p> <p>Whiscash appreciates spinblockers like Misdreavus and Spiritomb to keep its entry hazards up against Rapid Spin users like Quaxwell. Whiscash appreciates Charizard and Honchkrow's ability to deal with Grass-types; in return, it can take on the Rock- and Electric-types like Choice Scarf Lycanroc-N and Electrode. Grass-types like Gogoat and Dartrix also make for great teammates, as Whiscash can take on Fire- and Poison-types like Charizard, Houndoom, and Skuntank that threaten them. Its presence as an Electric-immune to help the likes of Masquerain and Honchkrow is superb, as it has the typing and bulk to take hits from the coverage moves that Pokemon like Raichu, Rotom-F, and Electrode carry. Dachsbun, Crabominable, and Carbink all benefit from Whiscash, as it can take Steel-type hits from Perrserker and Alolan Dugtrio for them. With a lot of the tier being weak or neutral to Rock, Whiscash finds itself having the typing to help the likes of Charizard, Masquerain, and Rabsca avoid dealing with Lycanroc-N, Dugtrio, and Gabite. It does find a lot of trouble handling Misdreavus, as it lacks the super effective coverage to get past its bulk. This is why pairing it with a Dark-type like Skuntank or Alolan Persian can be beneficial. Since Whiscash doesn't have recovery, it really doesnt like taking Will-O-Wisp from said Misdreavus, and Charizard or Toxic from Skuntank. As a result, status absorbers like Chansey, Dragonair, and Tinkatuff make for great teammates.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its great Attack, good coverage options, and ability to outpace foes such as Mega Aerodactyl, Alakazam, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon at +1, Salamence is a good setup sweeper on offense and hyper offense teams, being able to serve as both a mid-game wallbreaker and a late-game cleaner. Fly alongside Flyinium Z provides Salamence a powerful one-time nuke that can outright OHKO Flying-weak foes like Mega Venusaur and Buzzwole and neutral targets like Mega Sableye, Tapu Fini, and Gastrodon at +1. Outrage is an alternative when not using Flyinium Z that helps deal with opposing Dragon-types like Mega Latias, Latios, and Hydreigon, though it does have the downside of locking in Salamence, which can allow the opponent to respond with a Fairy-type like Tapu Fini, Clefable, or Enamorus. Earthquake helps against Steel-types like Excadrill, Aegislash, and Bisharp that resist both its STAB moves, and it can also help to chip down other Ground-weak foes like Skeledirge and Mega Tyranitar. Substitute lets Salamence make use of switches it forces against foes like Mega Venusaur and Buzzwole and take advantage of some defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Amoonguss; it can also provide a safety net for mispositioning with Fly or Outrage and avoids status from targets like Chansey, Mega Sableye, and Mew. Alternatively Fire Blast hits Skarmory and can also hit Grass- and Steel-types like physically defensive Tangrowth, Celesteela, and Scizor. If Salamence isn't using Fly, Life Orb boosts the damage of all of its moves, OHKOing Mega Latias and Rotom-W with Outrage. Salamence prefers running Moxie as opposed to Intimidate, due to its usefulness on offensively-oriented teams. Salamence has a hard time breaking through Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Clefable, due to their typing and super effective moves, making it pair well with other offensive Pokemon like Thundurus and Swords Dance Iron Hands, which can overwhelm these foes. When not running Fly, Salamence can also struggle to break through Grass-types like Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur, making Fire-types like Iron Moth and Victini also good partners. Salamence can also pair well with entry hazards from setters like Ting-Lu, Mega Tyranitar, and Skarmory, as Fly and Outrage are guaranteed to OHKO foes like Buzzwole and Thundurus-T after Stealth Rock chip. Due to Salamence's Stealth Rock weakness, it appreciates Pokemon that can provide anti-hazard measures, notably dedicated leads like Excadrill, as well as Taunt Mew, while Salamence can deal with Pokemon that can threaten them like Celesteela and Hydreigon. Salamence can be very prone to getting revenge killed by faster targets like Mega Aerodactyl, Alakazam, and Choice Scarf Enamorus, meaning it appreciates bulky partners like Slowbro and Mega Venusaur, appreciating the former's pivoting and the latter's tank-like nature, as well as Pokemon that can set up on the aforementioned targets like Scizor, Mega Latias, and Celesteela.</p>"

Mystical Fire can be used to threaten Gholdengo while still threatening Kingambit and Weavile somewhat, but it leaves it vulnerable to Mega Tyranitar, Heatran, and Hydreigon. Alternatively, Ice Beam + Thunder can be used on Mega Latias to give it perfect coverage and let it threaten Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor, but it lacks immediate power, notably leaving it unable to threaten any Pursuit trappers. Pokemon such as Buzzwole and Toxapex form good defensive cores with Mega Latias, handling Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Kingambit for it while Mega Latias deals with Mega Charizard Y and Zapdos in return.

Psychic allows it to take care of the many Poison-types that can trouble its teammates Dragapult and Dragonite, such as non-Choice Scarf Sneasler, Amoonguss, and Galarian Weezing. Psyshock is an alternative to more easily take care of specially defensive Clodsire as well as 2HKO Assault Vest Iron Hands after Spikes from Garchomp. Trick is another option to provide utility by crippling foes such as Kingambit, Alolan Muk, and Heatran. Lastly, with Healing Wish, Latias gains the ability to grant a second life to its teammates when it is in a pinch. The given EV spread allows Latias to survive a Flutter Mane Moonblast and retaliate with Psyshock, KOing it after Spikes damage.</p> <p>Pivot Dragapult is a great partner to cripple the opposition with status and easily pivot in Latias with U-turn, while offensive Choice Specs Dragapult aids Latias in bombarding foes with a barrage of Draco Meteors as well as being able to take care of Ghost-types such as Skeledirge and Sinistcha. Baxcalibur is another amazing offensive partner that appreciates the removal of Fighting-types such as Zamazenta and Urshifu-R as well as the likes of Porygon2 and Skarmory being hampered by Latias's Trick, letting it safely set up a Swords Dance or Dragon Dance to sweep. Gouging Fire also heavily appreciates Latias breaking down Poison teams that may disrupt it with Toxic, and in return it beats the Steel-types that wall Latias, such as Kingambit and Heatran. Latias is also able to heal Baxcalibur and Gouging Fire with Healing Wish in case they have suffered damage or status. Hisuian Goodra and Archaludon are able to easily dispatch of Fairy-types as well as Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Chien-Pao, which are threatening to Dragon teams. Archaludon is also able to set Stealth Rock, allowing Latias to break through opposition more easily. Garchomp is another great partner for setting both Stealth Rock and Spikes, as well as phazing threats such as Calm Mind Ursaluna-B with Dragon Tail. Raging Bolt and Choice Specs Kyurem have a great matchup against Water and Flying teams. Raging Bolt is also able to beat Kingambit with Thunderclap. Lastly, Dragonite is the biggest beneficiary of Latias's Healing Wish, reinstating its Multiscale if it doesn't carry Roost, making it extremely threatening with its ease of setup. Kommo-o is a great partner by virtue of its defensive sets being able to KO Chien-Pao with Vacuum Wave and set up Stealth Rock and offensive sets being able to mow through Dark-, Steel-, and Ice-types, such as Kingambit, Empoleon, and Mamoswine. Latias holding Choice Scarf also allows other common Choice Scarf teammates, such as Walking Wake and Roaring Moon, to run an alternative item, such as Choice Specs and Choice Band, respectively.</p>"

Calm Mind boosts Mega Latias' naturally high Special Attack and Special Defense to astounding levels, ensuring that it can easily withstand moves such as Clefable's unboosted Moonblast and Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Dark Pulse to sweep weakened teams. Psyshock is crucial to ignore defensive boosts from Calm Mind variants of the aforementioned Clefable while also breaking past special walls such as Blissey and Chansey more easily, preventing them from crippling Mega Latias with status moves. Aura Sphere provides Mega Latias with important coverage against most Dark- and Steel-types, hitting Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Excadrill super effectively. Alternatively, if Tyranitar is handled adequately by Mega Latias's teammates, Mystical Fire can be used to deal more immediate damage to the likes of Scizor and Celesteela instead. Mega Latias fits best on defensive and balance teams, which can provide it with the longevity needed to gain proper setup opportunities. Entry hazard support from the likes of Skarmory and Gastrodon can help wear down opposing walls that would otherwise be difficult to break through late-game, such as Tapu Fini. Similarly, wallbreakers such as Choice Band Iron Hands can make for good options to take advantage of these Pokemon, especially when Mega Latias lacks Mystical Fire to deal with the former. However, although Mega Latias is able to switch into Pokemon like Iron Hands, its lack of initial power can leave it vulnerable to being overwhelmed by their boosted attacks in return. Thus, Speed control options such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Tapu Fini, in addition to certain defensive walls like Unaware Skeledirge are extremely valuable in providing backup against such foes. Conversely, paralysis support from the likes of Clefable is also notable, as they can limit faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon from being able to overwhelm Mega Latias with super effective hits late-game.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Latias is an effective form of speed control that sets itself apart from other Pokemon the same role, such as Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos, with its unique utility options. Draco Meteor serves as its main STAB attack, letting Latias revenge kill most neutral targets such as Thundurus-T and opposing Latias. Psyshock is a more spammable STAB move that also lets it clean weakened teams and threaten Fighting-types as well as Iron Moth. Psychic is very similar, trading a chance to OHKO Iron Moth for a 2HKO on Iron Hands and a slightly higher damage output against most neutral targets. Healing Wish is especially helpful to bulky Pokemon that lack reliable recovery such as Iron Hands and Tapu Fini. It can also grant offensive Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar another opportunity to sweep or wallbreak. Trick is Latias's preferred fourth move, allowing it to cripple otherwise unbreakable foes such as Blissey and Chansey. An alternative is Mystical Fire, which lets Latias threaten the Steel-types that resist its STAB combination, like Aegislash and Excadrill. Its Special Attack-lowering effect makes it especially useful against certain boosting threats such as Autotomize Celesteela. Defog is another alternative, letting Latias clear hazards for its team; however, the fact that Latias loses to most Stealth Rock users such as Mega Tyranitar and Excadrill makes it somewhat unreliable in this role. Latias fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that want a revenge killer and appreciate Latias's utility. Latias struggles the most against special walls like Blissey and Slowking, making physical wallbreakers such as Bisharpand Galarian Zapdos mandatory partners. Fighting-types such as Buzzwole are useful to threaten Mega Tyranitar, which takes minimal damage from Latias's attacks and can trap it with Pursuit; they can also take out Steel-types like Excadrill, something especially important if Latias forgoes Mystical Fire. Latias's ability to force in and cripple special walls with Trick makes a good partner for special attackers like Clefable.</p>"

        "Special Wallbreaker": {
          "description": "<p>Latios is an elite wallbreaker thanks largely to its raw power. Its powerful STAB move in Draco Meteor allows Latios to demolish all but the sturdiest neutral targets, including Tyranitar, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. It can leverage its solid Speed stat versus common offensive Pokemon such as Victini, Galarian Zapdos, Sandy Shocks, and Blacephalon as well as its numerous useful resistances to create opportunities to unleash devastating moves. Psyshock is preferred over Psychic to defeat specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Chansey more easily. Trick is used on Choice Specs sets to cripple would-be walls such as Jirachi and Clefable, while Roost allows Life Orb variants to offset the item's recoil. Mystical Fire is preferred on Latios to hit Steel-types such as Excadrill, Aegislash, and Celesteela. It can also choose to use Thunderbolt to flip important matchups such as Tapu Fini, Slowking, and physically defensive Clefable while also providing a consistent way to damage most Steel-types. Choice Specs is preferred to maximize damage output, but Life Orb can also be chosen in order to enable switching moves, at the cost of the ability to eliminate Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Hippowdon with Draco Meteor. Latios's ability to blow away physical walls makes it an excellent partner to any physical wallbreaker. Latios appreciates opportunities to fire off powerful attacks, so Pokemon with pivoting moves such as Galarian Zapdos and Scizor make for good partners. Latios struggles with Choice Scarf users able to force it to switch, such as Tapu Fini, Blacephalon, and Latias, as well as Pokemon able to naturally outspeed it such as Alakazam. These weaknesses can be alleviated with defensive pivots able to switch into these threats, such as Clefable, Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Skarmory, depending on foe. Latios also pairs well with supportive Pokemon like Clefable and Mega Tyranitar that are able to help it break through walls through utility moves such as entry hazards or Knock Off. Latios pairs especially well with Fighting-type wallbreakers such as Buzzwole, Galarian Zapdos, and Iron Hands due to their favorable matchups into the Steel- and Dark-types looking to switch into Latios's STAB moves. In return, Latios offers a Psychic resistance and a favourable matchup into physically defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Slowbro, and opposing Buzzwole.</p>"

        "Double Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Access to Calm Mind and Stored Power make Latios an overwhelming setup sweeper. It makes use of the synergy between its boosting moves and Weakness Policy to punish opponents both for choosing to attack it and for choosing not to attack it. Stored Power allows Latios to take advantage of stat boosts even versus Unaware Pokemon such as Clefable and Skeledirge. Aura Sphere is chosen to threaten the only Pokemon able to survive a boosted Stored Power: Dark-types like Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon. Latios fits best on hyper offense teams, which require support from Pokemon such as Excadrill and Mew that can set entry hazards for Latios to secure important KOs late-game. It struggles with strategies able to interrupt its setup without activating Weakness Policy, such as phazing moves from Skarmory and specially defensive Pokemon able to trade hits with Latios such as Scizor and Celesteela. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar and Scizor aid with overwhelming Steel-types, while Z-Celebrate Victini and Meteor Beam Celesteela can threaten the Steel-types once they have been forced in. Pokemon halted by Unaware users appreciate Latios's ability to boost past them, namely Dragon Dance Mega Aerodactyl.</p>"

        "Mega Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>Mega Latios's gargantuan Special Attack, excellent bulk for an offensive Pokemon, and Speed tier that outpaces common wallbreakers suchas Thundurus-T, Keldeo, and Enamorus make it powerful threat that can terrorize offensive and defensive Pokemon alike. Aura Sphere is essential for its role, targeting Dark-types, notably 2HKOing the Tyranitar formes and OHKOing Bisharp, foes that can otherwise Pursuit trap Mega Latios. It also targets Steel-types such as Excadrill. Shadow Ball hits opposing Psychic-types such as Latios and Latias. Alternatively, Thunderbolt targets Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Flying-types such as Celesteela; additionally, while Mega Latios doesn't need Thunderbolt to threaten Enamorus and Skarmory, it always OHKOes them after Stealth Rock. Both options have the added benefit of pressuring Slowbro and Slowking, which otherwise stonewall and can pivot out on Mega Latios. Recover lets Mega Latios stay healthy, allowing it to check foes such as Keldeo and Iron Hands throughout a game. Mega Latios best fits on bulky offense teams looking for a fast offensive threat that has strong defensive utility. It has massive competition with Mega Latias, which is a much better setup sweeper thanks to its massive bulk, so teams using Mega Latios must utilize the instant offensive power it provides. Mega Latios is helpless against certain special walls such as Chansey and Blissey, making physical wallbreakers such as Scizor and Iron Hands necessary partners. Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Bisharp are notably effective at removing these walls. While it isn't helpless against Dark-types, foes like Mega Tyranitar and Bisharp can still easily win the one-on-one thanks to their bulk or access to Sucker Punch, making Fighting-types such as Buzzwole and Galarian Zapdos good partners for their ability to check and remove them. Mega Latios can be revenge killed by faster foes such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Hydreigon, making bulky teammates such as Amoonguss and Celesteela useful teammates. Based on its choice of coverage, Mega Latios is either walled by Psychic-types like Latios and Latias or certain Water- and Flying-types like Calm Mind Tapu Fini and Celesteela. The aforementioned Pursuit trappers are excellent at removing the former. Ghost-types like Hisuian Zoroark can also work well at KOing these foes. Against the latter group, Electric-types such as Iron Hands and Zeraora can eliminate them. Given that many of Mega Latios's checks lack recovery and don't hold Heavy-Duty Boots, entry hazard setters like Mew, Excadrill, and Mega Tyranitar can help it break through them.</p>"

Aura Sphere is important coverage to hit Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn as well as to KO chipped Mega Tyranitar. Mystical Fire hits the aforementioned Ferrothorn along with Mega Scizor and Iron Crown. Draco Meteor is a powerful nuke to threaten foes like Galarian Slowking after a Luster Purge drop while also immediately threatening other Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, and Mega Latias. Psychic Noise lets Mega Latios pressure checks that rely on recovery to deal with it, like Heatran and Mega Scizor, while also being a backup STAB attack with sufficient PP compared to Luster Purge. Mega Latios finds itself on many team archetypes including bulky offense and balance due to its versatility. However, it is outsped and revenge killed by Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Darkrai, and Weavile. Thus, teammates that can help with this like fast threats including your own Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant or defensive walls including Heatran and Clefable can help aid Mega Latios. In return, Mega Latios can pressure defensive checks like Heatran and Galarian Slowking for them. Good entry hazard control from allies like Great Tusk and Landorus-T helps, since Mega Latios is somewhat vulnerable to Stealth Rock due to its tendency to switch in and out very often.</p>"

        "Choice Specs (Psychic)": {
          "description": "<p>Boasting amazing offenses, Latios cements itself as a formidable threat on Psychic teams. With Choice Specs, Latios can drop powerful Draco Meteors and pulverize foes such as Gliscor and Gouging Fire that may otherwise trouble Psychic teams. Luster Purge can punish any switch-ins to Draco Meteor and plow through the likes of defensive Articuno and Gholdengo after a Special Defense drop. Latios has a plethora of coverage options, Ice Beam lets it threaten common Ground- and Flying-type threats like specially defensive Gliscor, while Thunderbolt lets it threaten Water-types like Empoleon. Latios can utilize Aura Sphere to counter Steel-types like Kingambit and Heatran without help from teammates. Latios can also hamper the opposition with Trick, being able to cripple foes like Hisuian Goodra, Kingambit and Ting-Lu.</p> <p>Latios appreciates support from Deoxys-S, being able to easily spread entry hazards and help Latios OHKO foes more easily. Alternatively, offensive Deoxys-S appreciates Latios punching holes in the opposition so that it can clean up later with its massive Speed tier. Galarian Slowking and Jirachi are great partners that can pivot Latios in with Chilly Reception and U-Turn, respectively, and take care of Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene that Latios is weak to. Specially defensive Jirachi can also set up Stealth Rock and pressure Ice-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Baxcalibur, as well as spread paralysis against the likes of Zamazenta and Greninja, allowing Latios to outspeed them. Choice Scarf Iron Boulder is a great partner that can clean up after Latios has been KOed and outspeed and threaten to OHKO other Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada, Greninja, and Iron Valiant as well as Dragon Dance +1 Gouging Fire. Choice Scarf Hoopa-U is a good partner to beat Ghost-types such as Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Dragapult. Assault Vest Hoopa-U can also deal with bulky Gholdengo and break apart defensive cores alongside Latios. Stored Power Espathra can act as a wincon once Latios has weakened the opposition. Gallade and Hatterene are good choices for countering Dark-types that are extremely threatening to Psychic teams such as Chien-Pao and Kingambit. Indeedee-M also notably provides a Ghost immunity alongside Healing Wish, giving Latios a second chance late-game. Eject Button Slowbro can provide a safe switch-in against Ceruledge and spread paralysis against or finish off weakened Chien-Pao and Kingambit, easing the burden on Latios.</p>"

Choice Specs Latios isn't quite as effective with this, but its it's still worth considering for crippling defensive foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball VS. Aura Sphere</strong>: Shadow Ball is Latios's best move against Gholdengo and will 2HKO most Flutter Mane sets as well. Aura Sphere leaves Latios reliant on Special Defense drops to deal with Gholdengo, but it is a more direct option against common Tera Steel foes like Dragonite and opposing Latios.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Calm Mind</strong>: While not a defensive set, Calm Mind is a reasonable option for boosting Draco Meteor and Luster Purge to dangerous power levels.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Beam</strong>: Ice Beam is handy for letting Choice Specs Latios OHKO Assault Vest Landorus-T and deal massive damage to Ting-Lu, though Draco Meteor has more general utility in many cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass Knot</strong>: If using Choice Specs, Grass Knot pulls a 2HKO even on Sitrus Berry Ting-Lu, though it being resisted by so many popular Pokemon like Dragonite makes it a risky move to be locked into.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Surf</strong>: If using Tera Water, Surf is a reasonable coverage option against Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: Thunderbolt offers good coverage against most Steel-types, but it is a very risky move to be locked into due to Ground-types like Landorus-T and Excadrill.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Latios's typing isn't amazing defensively, but the very useful resistances to Urshifu-R's and Ogerpon-H's STAB moves mean Terastallization isn't always an upgrade. Still, thanks to Levitate, Latios has some effective defensive options to consider.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel has superb synergy with Levitate, making Latios an effective offensive check against common foes like Landorus-T and Dragonite while giving Latios great counterplay against Fairy-types like Flutter Mane defensively and offensively with Tera Blast. This also lets Latios tank a Blood Moon from Ursaluna-B, though the Vacuum Wave weakness can be bothersome afterwards.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire also gives Latios a vital resistance to Fairy-types while maintaining the resistances against Ogerpon-H's STAB moves and providing a powerful Tera Blast against most Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water covers Latios's issue with Ice-type attacks, which can save it in a pinch against Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle, while still retaining an important resistance to Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric removes all of Latios's weaknesses except from Mold Breaker users with Earthquake like Excadrill and provides a useful paralysis immunity against common status spreaders like Porygon2, Flutter Mane, and Serperior.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a decent alternative to Tera Steel, giving Latios a good option against Dragon-types while still retaining a Fighting-type resistance.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs VS. Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Specs is preferred on Latios for the excellent wallbreaking potential. Choice Scarf Latios is a reasonable revenge killer, but it still doesn't deal well with Chien-Pao due to the Sucker Punch weakness, making it more reliant on unique qualities like Trick and Levitate to separate itself from other Choice Scarf revenge killers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Soul Dew</strong>: While not as effective at breaking walls as Choice Specs, Soul Dew is a reasonable alternative to still take advantage of Luster Purge's Special Defense drops, and it is a great way of getting around Item Clause issues if Latios still needs a power boost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Latios isn't frail, but Focus Sash lets it threaten offensive threats it normally has no bussiness with, such as Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Neutral Nature</strong>: It's best to use a neutral nature with a Timid Mint to ensure that Latios can eat any berry without getting confused after using Trick.</li> </ul>"

Latios pairs well with fast cleaners like Deoxys-S and Hisuian Electrode, as they can readily take advantage of the opposing RegenVest user being removed from the match. Strong physical wallbreakers like Iron Boulder and the Ogerpon formes appreciate Latios bringing them in safely with Flip Turn and even chunking their checks like Corviknight that may try to eat a predicted Psyshock.

Adaptability is more consistent, as it is always active and does not announce itself, while Hadron Engine can support Electric-types and Surge Surf users, disrupt opposing terrain from the likes of Azelf and Deoxys-S, and let Latios OHKO Corviknight with Thunderbolt.

          "description": "<ul> <li>Choice Scarf Kyogre is a solid form of speed control found on bulky offense teams. Its ability to outspeed Zacian-C and pressure common Pokemon found on bulky archetypes, like Ting-Lu, Corviknight, Skeledirge, and Groudon, gives it a decent offensive presence. Choice Scarf Kyogre can also pressure hyper offense teams because those teams don't run Pokemon naturally faster than it. However, Choice Scarf Kyogre is prediction reliant, as there are a lot of Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks in Ubers, mainly metagame staples like Koraidon, Miraidon, and other defensive Pokemon like Water Absorb Clodsire and Eternatus. Choice Scarf Kyogre is also relatively weak, which means that it'll often be forced to use Tera to power up its attacks; even then, Pokemon like Eternatus and Clodsire will still wall Kyogre.</li> <li>Koraidon is the biggest threat to Kyogre, as it commonly switches into it, takes little damage from its Water-type attacks, and sets sun. Catching Koraidon with Ice Beam is extremely important, as it can make the difference between Kyogre sweeping in the late-game or not. This makes Choice Scarf Kyogre extremely prediction reliant, as one single bad move can mean the entire momentum of the battle is lost.</li> <li>Tera Water boosts Kyogre's Water-type moves to insane levels. For instance, Water Spout now OHKOes max HP Arceus formes that are neutral to Water and 2HKOes Arceus formes that resist Water. It also has a good chance to OHKO Groudon even if sun is active.</li> <li>Kyogre should be brought onto the field via pivoting moves like U-turn from the likes of Koraidon, Miraidon, and Landorus-T. Unless there are Water Absorb Pokemon on the enemy team, Water Spout is a relatively free move to spam; however, hitting Koraidon on the switch with a well-timed Ice Beam can be game-changing.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Kyogre appreciates Pokemon that can wallbreak by themselves. A good teammate for this reason is Miraidon, which shares a common check in Clodsire. Taunt Miraidon in particular can shut down Clodsire completely, as Clodsire will be at half HP after switching into Draco Meteor. Miraidon can also bring Kyogre onto the field via U-turn. Arceus-Ground is another great teammate for Kyogre, as it can keep Pokemon like Eternatus, Clodsire, and Miraidon in check.</li> <li>Pokemon that can check Koraidon, like Arceus-Fairy, Groudon, and Skeledirge, are a must, as Koraidon is one of the most annoying Pokemon in Ubers for Kyogre to deal with: it replaces rain with sun, weakening Kyogre's main attacking moves.

Ice Beam lets Kyogre hit Koraidon and Clodsire super effectively, cleanly OHKOing the former lacking bulk EVs and 2HKOing the latter. Thunder is Kyogre's strongest option for breaking through bulky Water-types such as Toxapex, Arceus-Water, and opposing Kyogre.</li> <li>Tera Water lets Kyogre perform feats such as OHKOing Miraidon, Toxapex, Arceus-Water, and Eternatus with Water Spout or Origin Pulse with a layer of Spikes up.</li> <li>An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Def can be used to take on Arceus formes and switch into defensive Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Landorus-T better.</li> <li>Kyogre fits well on bulky offense. It has trouble getting onto the field and loses a significant part of its power if it takes a hit, so it should be paired with pivots such as Koraidon, Miraidon, and Landorus-T. They can bring Kyogre in on their incoming checks such as Arceus-Fairy and Skeledirge, Arceus-Ground, and Ting-Lu, respectively.</li> <li>Kyogre also greatly appreciates entry hazard removal, such as Defog support from Giratina-O and Corviknight, which keeps Water Spout at full power. Speed control options help Kyogre to wallbreak to its fullest, as it tends to have to take a hit before attacking thanks to its lower Speed, such as Thunder Wave from Arceus, Miraidon, Giratina-O, and Groudon, and Sticky Web from Masquerain.</li> <li>Entry hazards support from Ting-Lu and Clodsire is also appreciated to make sure Kyogre's attacks can cleanly OHKO most of their switch-ins. The aforementioned two Pokemon are also able to check Miraidon and Eternatus, both of which can come in on Kyogre and revenge-kill it. Koraidon can force Kyogre out and can switch into its Water-type attacks, so checks to Koraidon such as Skeledirge, Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Arceus-Fairy are also appreciated. That said, Kyogre can also predict Koraidon coming in and catch it with an Ice Beam, which is a clean OHKO on all Koraidon without bulk EVs.</li> <li>Kyogre can also be used as a solid offensive check to Arceus formes, as it can pivot into a Taunt or a Calm Mind and force them out with a strong Origin Pulse or Water Spout. Kyogre can also pivot into opposing Calm Mind Kyogre, forcing it out with Thunder.</li> </ul>"

Ice Beam lets Kyogre hit Miraidon, Koraidon, Eternatus, and Clodsire super effectively, which would otherwise freely switch into Kyogre. Tera Blast can be used if paired with Tera Ground to break through Clodsire, regardless of whether it has used Tera.</li> <li>Substitute can be used to set up on Clodsire, which cannot break it with Earthquake, and avoid status in general. Rest lets Kyogre repeatedly come in and absorb status, though it must be wary of Miraidon's Hadron Engine setting Electric Terrain.</li> <li>Tera Fairy flips Kyogre's matchup against Eternatus and Koraidon, letting Kyogre freely come in on Dragon-type moves and resist Koraidon's STAB attacks. Tera Ground lets Kyogre set up on Miraidon's Electro Drift, although it cannot take Draco Meteor well without previously having set up. Tera Poison is another option for becoming immune to Toxic from Clodsire, Toxapex, and Eternatus while also resisting Koraidon's Fighting-type attacks.</li> <li>Leftovers provides Kyogre with a form of recovery and gives it more chances to enter the field.</li> <li>The given EV spread lets Kyogre take on physical attackers like Groudon and Koraidon better while outspeeding some paralyzed +1 Arceus formes and paralyzed Zacian-C.</li> <li>Kyogre fits best on balance and bulky offense teams thanks to the defensive utility it provides as well as being a solid late-game wincon.</li> <li>Miraidon is a great partner for non-Rest variants of Kyogre, as it can break through Taunt and Calm Mind Arceus formes and pressure bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Arceus-Water. Miraidon can also use U-turn to bring Kyogre in on Ground-types that it can set up on, such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Ting-Lu and Groudon are solid partners for Kyogre, since they can set up Spikes to weaken Kyogre's checks, while also being able to switch into Electric-type attacks that threaten Kyogre. Physical attackers such as Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Chien-Pao, and Koraidon pair well with Kyogre, as they can use Kyogre's checks as an entry for them to start breaking, and Kyogre pressures all of their checks apart from Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Kyogre needs Koraidon eliminated before it can start setting up, as Kyogre is generally forced out by it and its STAB moves are weakened. As such, defensive Pokemon such as Skeledirge, Great Tusk, and Arceus-Fairy are solid partners that check Koraidon effectively. Finally, Kyogre has trouble coming in against faster offense teams, so partners that can pressure these teams such as Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Zacian-C are preferred.</li> </ul>"

Zacian-C in particular helps Rayquaza against Scale Shot Koraidon, one Pokemon that can outright OHKO Rayquaza even through Focus Sash. Flutter Mane is another Fairy-type Pokemon that can help with Scale Shot Koraidon while also dealing with the Taunt Arceus formes that annoy Rayquaza and its team. Rayquaza cannot prevent Pokemon like Ribombee and Glimmora from getting their own entry hazards up; therefore, Pokemon that can remove them, like Great Tusk and Iron Treads, are good partners.</li> </ul>"

Rayquaza offers basically no defensive utility and hates taking status or Knock Off, meaning slow pivoting support from Dondozo and RegenVest users like Dialga-O is mandatory.

Iron Head is chosen as Jirachi’s STAB move thanks to its decent power and high flinch chance, bolstered further by Serene Grace. Stealth Rock provides the team with valuable entry hazard support. Though, if that role has already been covered on the team, Jirachi can also run Fire Punch to hit common checks like Scizor and Aegislash, or Body Slam to paralyze foes like Hippowdon and Celesteela. U-turn allows Jirachi to maintain momentum and bring its teammates in safely. Healing Wish can fully heal whichever one of Jirachi’s worn down teammates is needed the most late-game. Alternatively, the combination of Wish and Protect can be used to vastly increase the Jirachi’s longevity, though it diminishes its support capabilities and renders it more passive. 16 Speed EVs allow Jirachi to outspeed Adamant Bisharp. The remaining EVs are used to maximize Jirachi’s special bulk. Jirachi can instead run 120 Speed EVs to outspeed Jolly Mega Tyranitar, though it will significantly hamper Jirachi’s ability to check special attackers like Alakazam. Jirachi is prone to getting Pursuit trapped by Dark-type Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and Bisharp and thus needs to be positioned carefully to not be taken out too early. It also pairs well with Pokemon that can switch into these threats such as Keldeo and Iron Hands. Jirachi is also weak to common Ground-types like Excadrill and Hippowdon and thus pairs well with Pokemon like Celesteela or Rotom-W that can handle them.

Iron Head is a powerful STAB move that hits Dark-type Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and Hydreigon; as it is a physical move, it allows Jirachi to beat Blissey and Chansey, which otherwise beat most special attackers. Iron Head’s high Serene Grace-boosted flinch chance also allows Jirachi to chip its checks into range for its other moves to KO. Shadow Ball hits Pokemon like Aegislash and Slowking for super effective damage, though Thunderbolt can be used instead to hit Celesteela and Mandibuzz while maintaining super effective coverage for Slowking. Jirachi struggles to do meaningful damage to walls like Ting-Lu and Hisuian Goodra and thus pairs well with Pokemon like Keldeo and Iron Hands that can threaten these Pokemon. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu will further wear these checks down to facilitate its sweep.

Stored Power is Jirachi's main attacking move, nailing most foes that do not resist Psychic&amp;emdash;this also allows Jirachi to match up favorably against Toxapex and Clodsire, the two biggest setup stoppers in the tier. Aura Sphere allows Jirachi to deal with Dark- and Steel-types; these include Hisuian Samurott, Mega Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn. Drain Punch is an alternative to 2HKO Blissey, which otherwise walls Jirachi, and keep itself healthy with recovery when fighting foes like Heatran. Iron Head serves as a secondary STAB move that can also flinch down foes like Galarian Slowking and Dragonite. A Naive nature should be run when using Drain Punch over Aura Sphere. Jirachi pairs well with allies that can take out its main checks, since it can only set up once and thus has to make it count. Magnezone and Heatran are stellar partners, trapping foes like Ferrothorn and Garganacl that may stand in the way of a Jirachi sweep. Offensive Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Garchomp that may struggle against Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant pair well with Jirachi, as it acts as a soft check to these foes and can use them as setup fodder. Tapu Lele is also notable for providing Psychic Terrain that blocks priority such as Sucker Punch from Hisuian Samurott and powers up Stored Power. Finally, dual screens support from Tapu Koko or Grimmsnarl is beneficial to ease Jirachi's setup, as the damage reduction affords Jirachi more opportunities to successfully use Z-Happy Hour.</p>"

Iron Head allows Jirachi to easily revenge kill Fairy- and Ice-types, such as Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Weavile, and has good odds to flinch down any foe that does not resist Steel, as long as they are sufficiently chipped. U-turn allows Jirachi to pivot out into teammates upon forcing out foes, allowing free points of entry for allies such as Ogerpon-W and Zapdos that capitalize on Jirachi's switch-ins in Heatran and Toxapex. Trick cripples most foes that try to switch into Iron Head; foes like Toxapex, Zapdos, Ferrothorn, and Alomomola dislike being locked into a move. Healing Wish gives weakened allies another chance to sweep, additionally curing status like burn and paralysis and offering a point of entry; it is best used on offensive Pokemon, such that they can be used more recklessly early-game and come back later to sweep. Ice Punch alternatively allows Jirachi to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Garchomp particularly hard. Jirachi is best used on offensive playstyles that appreciate its one-off heal and ability to cripple defensive switch-ins. Since Jirachi acts as a soft check to the tier's premier Fairy-types in Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele, allies like Zamazenta and Weavile that dislike them pair well with it, as they can threaten Jirachi's checks in Heatran, Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Slowbro. Jirachi also struggles to revenge kill Mega Gyarados, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Scizor, especially once they set up, so allies like Ferrothorn and Corviknight are needed to act as sturdier checks. Finally, Jirachi is easily exploited by foes like Mega Charizard Y, Mega Scizor, and Garchomp, as all of them can switch into Iron Head and can ignore Trick provided the latter has a Z-Crystal. Allies that can take advantage of them such as Tapu Koko, Iron Moth, and Weavile make for good partners.</p>"

Shadow Ball hits Giratina and Psychic-types like Mewtwo, Hatterene, opposing Deoxys, and Solgaleo. Extreme Speed allows Deoxys to pick off low health priority and Choice Scarf users or such as Palafin, Kyurem-W, and Chi-Yu. Alternatively, Knock Off allows Deoxys to secure KOs on Pokemon like Spectrier and specially defensive Solgaleo. Tera Psychic is generally preferred to boost the power of Deoxys's Psycho Boost, although Tera Ghost and Tera Fighting can be viable options, with the former boosting the power of Shadow Ball and providing a nifty immunity to Extreme Speed and the latter allowing Deoxys to beat Kingambit and Arceus-Dark. Deoxys fits best on offensive teams looking for a strong and reliable revenge killer and wallbreaker. Bulkier walls like Magearna, Giratina, and Solgaleo can take an attack from Deoxys and OHKO it or chip away at it by setting up entry hazards and letting it take Life Orb damage, so Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Arceus-Dark, and Landorus that can deal with these threats are nice. Great Tusk is a notable partner; Deoxys deals with Pokemon like Mewtwo, Kyurem-W, and Clefable that Great Tusk potentially struggles with, and in return, Great Tusk deals with Pokemon like Kingambit and Arceus-Fire.

Generally, Deoxys prefers Stealth Rock in the final moveslot, allowing it to nearly guarantee it sets up both Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes, although Taunt can be run instead allowing it to stop Pokemon from setting up or laying their own entry hazards. Focus Sash allows Deoxys to guarantee at least one layer of entry hazards. Tera Psychic boosts Deoxys's Psycho Boost, although Tera Ghost can be run instead, allowing it to spinblock Pokemon like Great Tusk and Cyclizar and block Extreme Speed from Arceus-Fire, which otherwise troubles it. Deoxys fits best on offense and hyper offense teams looking for a dedicated lead that can set up hazards consistently. Offensive threats like Mewtwo, Zacian, and Ogerpon-H appreciate the entry hazards Deoxys sets up to wear down their switch-ins like Arceus-Dark, Solgaleo, and Giratina. Pokemon like Spectrier and Gholdengo that can spinblock are also nice to have. If Deoxys is not running Taunt threats like Arceus-Fire, Arceus-Dark, and Mewtwo may try to use it as set-up fodder, so Pokemon like Zamazenta-C, Palafin, and Magearna that can counter these threats are helpful to have.</p>"

It outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon in OU and outspeeds plenty of boosted Pokemon as well, such as +1 Great Tusk, +1 Volcarona. and +1 Gouging Fire. Fighting-type coverage is required to hit Dark- and Steel-types that switch into Psycho Boost, like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Superpower can be run to hit special walls like Blissey, but Focus Blast doesn't have any stat drops and also benefits from boosts from Nasty Plot. Knock Off removes items, helping it break down walls like Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. Shadow Ball can be used instead if it's running Nasty Plot and to avoid being walled by Hatterene. In its last move slot, it can run Ice Beam for even greater coverage, letting it destroy Dragonite, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. However, Psycho Boost hits the latter two hard anyway, so Nasty Plot can be ran instead to drastically increase its killing power if it’s running only special moves. For example, +2 Psycho Boost can OHKO Volcarona, +2 Focus Blast can OHKO specially defensive Heatran, and +2 Shadow Ball can OHKO Galarian Slowking, Hatterene, and Gholdengo. Finally, Taunt can be used as utility, denying hazards, setup, and keeping Deoxys-S free from status like Gliscor's Toxic and Clefable's Thunder Wave, and also stopping Galarian Slowking from gaining momentum with Chilly Reception. Other moves Deoxys-S can run include Expanding Force over Psycho Boost if it's used with Psychic Terrain and Stealth Rock or Spikes in its last slot to take advantage of switches. A Timid nature should be ran if using Nasty Plot, but a Naive nature should be used if running a mixed set. A Hasty nature is an alternative to better take special moves like Raging Bolt's Thunderclap, but it makes Deoxys-S weaker into common priority like Extreme Speed and Grassy Glide. Tera Fighting is its premier Tera type, giving it STAB on its Fighting-type coverage, letting it hit Psycho Boost switch-ins harder. It guarantees that Superpower will 2HKO Heatran and Iron Treads and lets +2 Focus Blast OHKO Ting-Lu. It also has defensive utility, like giving it a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Tera Ghost can be useful on Shadow Ball sets to break past its Psychic-type switch-ins, letting it get a 2HKO on Galarian Slowking and Latias. It also gives Deoxys-S an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Finally, Tera Psychic further boosts its Psycho Boosts, which lets it guarantee an OHKO into Walking Wake and Ogerpon-W and gives it a good chance to OKHO Gouging Fire. Life Orb boosts its damage output, but Expert Belt can be used instead to avoid recoil damage. However, missing out on Life Orb can cost Deoxys-S some KOs like missing a 2HKO on Clefable with Psycho Boost and losing the ability to do substantial damage to Corviknight.</p> <p>Deoxys-S is best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Offensive teammates such as Volcarona, Roaring Moon, and Gouging Fire like the holes Deoxys-S pokes into opposing teams. It can damage walls like Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Galarian Slowking for these teammates or check other offensive Pokemon that outspeed them like +1 Kyurem and Dragapult. Its Fighting-type coverage takes care of Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran, removing checks for other teammates like its own Kingambit, Dragapult, and Volcarona. Similarly, its Ghost- or Dark-type coverage lets it take out Hatterene and Gholdengo, opening up opportunities for teammates like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder to clean up late-game. Thanks to its perfect coverage, it is able to deal decent damage to any opponent, further opening holes for its teammates. This includes Pokemon like Dondozo, Roaring Moon, and Corviknight. Offensive teammates also appreciate its fast Knock Off removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from walls like Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard support from teammates like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora help with breaking as well. Similarly, if it runs Taunt, teammates such as Kyurem and Gouging Fire like its fast Taunt denying hazards, stopping setup from opponents, and limiting recovery. While Deoxys-S has great coverage, its base 95 attacking stats are relatively low, and Psycho Boost lowering its Special Attack is less than ideal. As such, it can struggle to break past certain walls it can't hit super effectively like Corviknight and Assault Vest Primarina. Volcarona invites in Primarina and can damage it with Giga Drain. This chip damage can allow Deoxys-S to KO Primarina later in the game, while the chip Deoxys-S does to Primarina can allow Volcarona to sweep. Raging Bolt can freely switch into Corviknight and set up free Calm Minds as it switches out. Despite its massive natural Speed stat, Deoxys-S is still outsped by a lot of prominent boosted Pokemon like +1 Roaring Moon, +1 Iron Boulder, +1 Walking Wake, and Barraskewda in rain. These can be covered by carrying offensive checks to these mons like Kingambit, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Ogerpon-W. Deoxys-S is also horribly weak to priority. It doesn't have many ways to work around Sucker Punch, and other priority like Grassy Glide and Extreme Speed hit it hard. A way around this is having teammates that can easily take common priority like Kingambit, Great Tusk, or Dragonite. Additionally, dual screen setters, like Alolan Ninetales, can help against priority and assist Deoxys-S in setting up Nasty Plots. Psychic Terrain from Indeedee is another option due to it blocking priority, and it also boosts Deoxys-S’s Psychic-type STAB moves.</p>"

        "Dual Screens": {
          "description": "<p>Thanks to its unparalleled Speed tier and access to an array of solid utility options, Deoxys-S is one of the best dual screens setters in OU. Taunt is key in preventing Pokemon like Glimmora, Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T from laying entry hazards, setup threats such as Swords Dance Ogerpon-W and Dragon Dance Kyurem from boosting, and Cinderace from using Court Change. Psycho Boost lets Deoxys-S have some sort of offensive presence; it can obliterate lead Glimmora while overwhelming neutral targets like Dondozo and physically defensive Skeledirge. Deoxys-S generally should not Terastallize, as being unable to Terastallize a wallbreaker later in the match could be game ending. However, in a pinch, Tera Steel can let it more easily set dual screens against priority users like Weavile, Dragonite, and Rillaboom.</p> <p>Deoxys-S is a fixture on dual screens hyper offense teams thanks to its absolutely blazing Speed that surpasses every unboosted Pokemon in the tier, letting it ensure at least one of Reflect or Light Screen go up. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, Iron Boulder, Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Serperior are amazing at making use of Deoxys-S's screens support, taking a hit from Deoxys-S's potential revenge killers such as Kingambit and Cinderace with it and being able to strike back strong. In particular, Volcarona's solid natural bulk and ability to switch in on Pokemon that would otherwise break Deoxys-S like Weavile and Kingambit make it an excellent partner. Cleaners such as Dragon Dance Kyurem, Kingambit, and Choice Scarf Enamorus are similarly potent behind dual screens. Due to Ceaseless Edge, Hisuian Samurott's Spikes cannot be denied by Deoxys-S, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Hisuian Samurott such as Iron Valiant and Enamorus are good teammates. Entry hazard control options like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Hatterene also make for good partners in the event that Deoxys-S is unable to prevent hazards being set. Great Tusk and Hatterene in particular can double as potent bulky setup sweepers with Bulk Up and Calm Mind, respectively. Other bulky setup Pokemon like Latias and Iron Crown benefit similarly from screens.</p>"

Energy Ball hits Swampert and Iron Boulder; alternatively, Dark Pulse OHKOes Azelf and 2HKOes Gholdengo and Deoxys-D while still hitting Iron Boulder. Trick can debilitate defensive Pokemon, but it comes with the cost of weakening Deoxys-S. A Timid nature allows Deoxys-S to outspeed +1 Volcarona and Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks, while a Modest nature gives it more power, allowing it to always 2HKO defensive Gholdengo after slight chip damage. Other special wallbreakers like Iron Moth, Walking Wake, and Latios are appreciated, as they can break down shared checks such as RegenVest users like Manaphy, Swampert, Meloetta, and Hisuian Goodra with Deoxys-S. Deoxys-S is very frail, so slow pivots like Corviknight, Swampert, and Manaphy are very helpful.

Ice Beam OHKOes Zapdos and offensive Roaring Moon after some chip damage and 2HKOes Mandibuzz. Energy Ball 2HKOes RegenVest Swampert, while Thunderbolt can be run instead to threaten Corviknight. Focus Blast lets Deoxys-S damage Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra, while Dark Pulse can be used instead to 2HKO Deoxys-D and Gholdengo. Knock Off is another option that can be used to debilitate opposing Pokemon like Swampert and Manaphy by removing their held items, making them easier for Deoxys-S and its teammates to deal with. Deoxys-S struggles against specially defensive Pokemon like Meloetta and Manaphy, so it pairs well with physically offensive partners like Chien-Pao, Meowscarada, and Galarian Zapdos that can effectively force them out. Due to its relative frailty and lack of recovery, Deoxys-S benefits from pivots like Corviknight and entry hazard removers like Great Tusk that allow it to come in safely.

Pokemon such as Iron Moth and Chien-Pao that threaten Defog users pair well with Deoxys-S, since Defog threatens to remove dual screens after Deoxys-S has left the field. Mandibuzz is the biggest threat to Deoxys-S's dual screens, since its Defog cannot be blocked by Prankster Taunt. Since Deoxys-S is usually used as a suicide lead, it should only be used on hyper offense teams. Deoxys-S pairs well with setup sweepers like Manaphy, Roaring Moon, and Chien-Pao, since it's able to reliably get up dual screens, which allow them set up more easily and make harder to revenge kill. Pokemon weak to entry hazards such as Volcarona appreciate Deoxys-S's ability to block them from being set with Taunt. Dark-types, such as Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, are able to set up in front of Deoxys-S due to being immune to Prankster Taunt, so switch-ins like Great Tusk are required.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Protean Deoxys-S is a fast mixed wallbreaker and late-game cleaner, using its wide list of coverage to its advantage. Thunderbolt is Deoxys-S's most spammable move, as it hits a majority of the metagame for solid damage such as Primarina, Manaphy, non-Volt Absorb Corviknight, and Gholdengo. Ice Beam is used to hit Ground- and Dragon-types hard, such as Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon. Energy Ball can be used to beat Swampert while also pressuring Water- and Ground-types instead of being forced to predict. Superpower acts as Deoxys-S's main physical attack, being able to hit specially defensive walls such as Hisuian Goodra, Blissey, and Meloetta. Knock Off helps Deoxys-S and its teammates by crippling RegenVest users to be taken on better later in the game. Entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes let Deoxys-S potentially weaken defensive checks for itself and its teammates. Life Orb is used to more easily use Deoxys-S's mixed potential but can reduce how many times how many times its able to switch in. Choice Specs can be used instead as an easier way for Deoxys-S to hit 2HKO damage rolls on RegenVest Pokemon and give it more switch-in opportunities, but this gives it less flexibility and physical power. With 236 Speed EVs and a Naive nature, Deoxys-S is able to outrun +1 Jolly Garchomp as well as neutral Regieleki. Setup sweepers and Choice-locked Pokemon like Roaring Moon, Chien-Pao, and Manaphy appreciate Deoxys-S's presence, as it can help with weakening or taking out any of their checks such as Great Tusk, Primarina, and RegenVest users. Teams containing slower attackers also appreciate Deoxys-S, as it can act as a form of speed control. Deoxys-S does struggle with making it onto the field safely due to both hazards and having minimal bulk, so having a defensive pivot or a hazard remover would help it, like Great Tusk, Corviknight, or Mandibuzz.</p>"

Bullet Seed, alongside Loaded Dice, gives Torterra an incredibly strong STAB combination when paired with Headlong Rush and hits things Seed Bomb cannot KO such as Walking Wake and Air Balloon Glimmora. Seed Bomb is a less powerful alternative but comes with the upside of not having to run Loaded Dice for reliability. Headlong Rush allows Torterra to hit Steel- and Poison-types such as Heatran and Amoonguss. Rock Blast is also boosted by Loaded Dice and hits Flying-types, such as Talonflame, Dragonite, and Zapdos, that can ignore Torterra's STAB moves as well as hitting Bug-types such as Volcarona. Alternatively, Heavy Slam provides Torterra with a way to hit Galarian Weezing to secure the Poison matchup alongside being a good option into Fairy teams as a whole. An Adamant nature is preferred to gain as much extra power as possible, but a Jolly nature can outspeed slower Choice Scarf users such as Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. Soft Sand is an alternative to Loaded Dice if Seed Bomb and Heavy Slam are run, which lets Torterra's Headlong Rush have a favorable roll to OHKO Amoonguss with a Shell Smash boost.</p> <p>Ogerpon-H is a great teammate for Torterra, as it can remove Corviknight, an otherwise large barrier for Torterra's sweeping attempts. In return, Torterra breaks through Toxapex, which inhibits Ogerpon-H's sweeping attempts. Choice Scarf Meowscarada provides speed control for Torterra while removing crucial defensive items such as Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from Corviknight and Amoonguss respectively in order to wear them down faster. Additionally, Meowscarada can threaten Dragon-types, such as Choice Scarf Roaring Moon and Walking Wake, that can halt Torterra's sweep by outspeeding it. In return, Torterra easily destroys bulkier team compositions, such as Poison, that Meowscarada struggles to make meaningful progress against. Amoonguss provides opportunities for Torterra to set up thanks to Spore, which Torterra can struggle with finding otherwise. Abomasnow provides Aurora Veil support to aid Torterra in its sweeping efforts, offers a way to beat Dragon teams, and provides an Ice neutrality, allowing it to take a few hits from Chien-Pao, while Brambleghast can remove entry hazards to let Torterra switch in and take advantage of passive switch-ins more readily. Breloom can also put foes to sleep with Spore, while using Mach Punch to remove Choice Scarf users such as Roaring Moon and threaten Baxcalibur, which can each end Torterra's sweeping attempts quickly. Hisuian Lilligant and Rotom-C can also help in the Flying matchup, where Torterra struggles thanks to Ice Spinner and Electric-type STAB moves, respectively, while also being able to scare out Corviknight. Sinistcha is another good teammate for Torterra thanks to Heatproof.</p>"

With Knock Off, Infernape can not only threaten Ghost-types, such as Skeledirge, but it can also remove key items, such as Heavy-Duty Boots, from the likes of Pelipper, Ninetales, and Baxcalibur to make them susceptible to entry hazards. However, Close Combat is generally more useful due to the amount of targets it can remove like Ursaluna-B and Ting-Lu, benefiting Fire teams. Fire Punch can be run over Flare Blitz. Although weaker, using Fire Punch doesn't result in Infernape taking recoil damage, improving its longevity. However, Flare Blitz is more reliable despite its recoil damage, and the recoil damage can be solved when running Ninetales thanks to the its access to Healing Wish.

Close Combat is Infernape's primary Fighting-type STAB move, massively threaten the likes of Ursaluna-B and Baxcalibur. With U-turn, Infernape can safely pivot out of its switch-ins, such as Dondozo, into a teammate that can threaten them. Infernape is also able to serve as a great revenge killer thanks to its access to an Iron Fist-boosted Mach Punch, being able to pick off weakened sweepers such as Baxcalibur, Choice Scarf Hisuian Arcanine, Greninja, and Chien-Pao.</p> <p>Ninetales and Torkoal make for great partners for Infernape, as the two of them up sun to further boost Infernape's Flare Blitz. Ninetales also commonly uses Solar Beam, allowing it to OHKO threats to Infernape, such as physically defensive Quagsire, and can heal Infernape with Healing Wish, while Torkoal can remove entry hazards for Infernape with its access to Rapid Spin. Torkoal and Heatran can set Stealth Rock in order to wear down foes for Infernape to pick off. For example, Infernape is guaranteed a 2HKO on Galarian Weezing after Stealth Rock damage. In return, Infernape can OHKO Landorus with Flare Blitz under sun as well as both Ursaluna-B and Mamoswine without sun. Cinderace is another noteworthy teammate, as not only can it remove hazards with Court Change, but it is also able to revenge kill faster Ghost-types Infernape cannot such as Dragapult and Speed-boosted Ceruledge with Sucker Punch. In return, Infernape's Fighting-type STAB move frees up a moveslot for Cinderace, as the latter no longer needs High Jump Kick. Volcanion is another great teammate, as it provides Fire teams an immunity to Water, and in return, Infernape is able to threaten the likes of Iron Treads and Landorus for it. Talonflame and Moltres provide a Ground immunity, Will-O-Wisp support, and they can bring Infernape in via U-turn. The two of them are also able to lure bulky Pokemon like Ursaluna-B and Ting-Lu for Infernape to break. Talonflame also provides Defog support, while Moltres's bulk allows it to take on Dragonite, which Infernape greatly appreciates. Infernape's wallbreaking enables other wallbreakers and sweepers such as Ogerpon-H, Volcarona, and Ceruledge to clean late-game.

          "description": "<p>Empoleon's access to a nice batch of utility options such as Stealth Rock, Roar, and Defog allows it to support its team with entry hazards, phaze foes, and deter Defog. Empoleon acts as a great special wall, being able to deal with foes such as Choice Specs Walking Wake, Greninja, and Hatterene. Flash Cannon gives Empoleon an easier time dealing with Fairy-type Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Alolan Ninetales, as well as hitting Ice-types like Earthquake-less Baxcalibur and non-Choice Band Chien-Pao. Empoleon also takes neutral damage from Freeze Dry from Alolan Ninetales and Articuno, which have to be extremely wary of Flash Cannon and Knock Off, respectively. Roar is a great option for Empoleon to get rid of setup sweepers such as Manaphy, Volcarona, and Spectrier, as well as applying more Stealth Rock damage to the Pokemon that are forced in. Lastly, Knock Off allows Empoleon to put itself in a better position to take hits from offensive Pokemon such as Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Basculegion-F, as well as crippling defensive Pokemon that rely heavily on their item, such as Articuno, Corviknight, and Alolan Muk. Leftovers synergizes well with Empoleon's Stealth Rock resistance, and it also appreciates the extra longevity Leftovers provides. However, Heavy-Duty Boots is a better option for teams with no entry hazard removal, as Empoleon is prone to getting worn down by Spikes from repeated switching. 60 Speed EVs allow Empoleon to outspeed uninvested Corviknight and 2HKO it with +2 Surf, helping prevent hazard removal.</p> <p>Toxapex forms a nice defensive core with Empoleon, as the support from Toxic Spikes helps whittle down Pokemon that would otherwise beat Empoleon, such as Zamazenta, Meowscarada, and Urshifu-R. Empoleon can also switch into the Psychic-type attacks that would make quick work of Toxapex, and Toxapex can switch in on Fighting-type attacks for Empoleon. Physically defensive Rotom-W provides a valuable Ground-type immunity as well as a slow Volt Switch to help Empoleon get in more easily. Will-O-Wisp support from Rotom-W also allows Empoleon to stand up to a physically attacking foe that it might not otherwise be able to, such as Iron Treads or Alolan Muk. Quagsire is another excellent complement to Empoleon, as it provides a valuable Electric-type immunity, as well as helping chip down walls with Spikes and Toxic support. Quagsire also helps versus Zamazenta, a setup Pokemon that Empoleon struggles to phaze, and Empoleon can in turn take on Sinistcha, a setup Pokemon that tears through Quagsire. The physically defensive prowess of Quagsire and the specially defensive power of Empoleon form an incredibly potent defensive pairing. Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes via Ceaseless Edge and stack hazard damage in tandem with Stealth Rock from Empoleon. Empoleon is also capable of switching into Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon such as Flutter Mane that would otherwise plague Hisuian Samurott. Manaphy is also a strong teammate, as Empoleon's entry hazard and Knock Off support allows it to set up and secure KOs more easily. Empoleon can also switch into foes that wish to poison Manaphy, such as Toxapex. Ogerpon-W is a great physical wallbreaking teammate for Empoleon. Empoleon's entry hazard support from Empoleon, whittles down Pokemon that would otherwise switch into it, and in return Ogerpon-W smashes Ground-type Pokemon that would otherwise beat Empoleon, such as Great Tusk and Gliscor. Choice Specs Greninja is also a great wallbreaking teammate, as it outspeeds and OHKOes many Ground-type Pokemon that would otherwise give Empoleon trouble, such as Landorus, Garchomp, and Quagsire. Empoleon is also able to safely switch into Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Hatterene and Flutter Mane. Urshifu-R thrives with Empoleon's hazard support, as almost nothing will be safe from a +2 Surging Strikes or Close Combat. If Empoleon is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, Quaquaval is a fantastic teammate. Their Fighting and Steel typings have nice synergy, as Quaquaval can take care of Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Kingambit, as well as removing entry hazards via Rapid Spin. Azumarill can deal with Fighting-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk, while Empoleon can handle Poison-type Pokemon such as Galarian Weezing, Glimmora, and Iron Moth. Pelipper is capable of setting rain for Empoleon, as well as taking on Grass-type Pokemon such as Hisuian Lilligant and Meowscarada with it's perfectly accurate Hurricane. Basculegion-F's Normal-type immunity means that Empoleon's Stealth Rock and Hisuian Samurott's Spikes cannot be removed via Rapid Spin.</p>"

Surf is Empoleon's best way of dealing consistent damage as well as taking care of Fire-type Pokemon such as Talonflame, Iron Moth, and Heatran. Knock Off allows Empoleon to soften up defensive staples such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Galarian Weezing, and Porygon2 and remove Choice items from the aforementioned special attackers. Flip Turn is a great pivoting option that allows Empoleon to provide safe switches for wallbreaking teammates such as Kingambit and Choice Specs Gholdengo. Competitive deters opponents from removing hazards via Defog, as the +2 boost to Surf allows Empoleon to deal huge damage.</p> <p>Thanks to Competitive deterring Defog and Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, Empoleon thrives on Steel teams that rely on entry hazards, so hazard-setting teammates such as Archaludon and Skarmory are great picks. Skarmory and Archaludon are also able to use their incredible Defense stats to stand up to physical attackers that Empoleon is unable to deal with, such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, Sneasler, and Baxcalibur. Skarmory is also able to switch into Ground-type attacks that would otherwise threaten Empoleon. Kingambit is a powerful teammate for Empoleon, as the entry hazard damage and removal of items from Pokemon like Choice Specs Walking Wake and Greninja and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Quagsire and Toxapex make Kingambit's job a lot easier. Empoleon is also capable of switching into Fire-type attacks, Matcha Gotcha from Sinistcha, and Will-O-Wisp from Dragapult, as well as threatening to remove their Leftovers. Gholdengo is a great teammate for Empoleon, as it can safely switch into Fighting-type attacks that threaten Empoleon. Gholdengo can also take advantage of the hazards on the field, as its checks, such as Alolan Muk, Ting-Lu, and Heatran, are weakened by them as they switch in. Iron Treads is able to remove hazards via Rapid Spin, which protects Empoleon in case its Heavy-Duty Boots get removed by Knock Off. Air Balloon Iron Treads is also capable of providing as a Ground immunity, albeit temporarily, and threatening foes like Gliscor and Landorus with a strong Ice Spinner. Excadrill is a strong physical attacker that appreciates Empoleon's ability to grant it safe switches with Flip Turn. Excadrill is able to fire off very powerful attacks like Earthquake and Iron Head, all while the opposing team takes chip damage from entry hazards. Both Iron Treads and Excadrill are able to switch into Electric-type attacks from Pokemon like Zapdos, Thundurus-T, Choice Specs Flutter Mane, and Rotom formes while threatening them back with Ice Spinner, Rock Slide, Iron Head, and Mold Breaker Earthquake, respectively. Corviknight can switch into Ground-type attacks as well and is also capable of attacking Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Sneasler, Great Tusk, Ogerpon-W, and Meowscarada with STAB-boosted Brave Bird. Empoleon can form a nice core with Heatran to help stop Fire-type Pokemon such as Volcanion, Volcarona, and Ninetales. Air Balloon Heatran is also capable of completely walling the most common Gouging Fire set. Hisuian Goodra is another formidable special wall that forms a nice core with Empoleon, further helping improve the Fire matchup. Its Dragon Tail also forces foes to switch out, thus racking up more hazard damage.</p>"

Ice Beam is still worth considering for dealing far more damage to Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn versus Surf</strong>: Flip Turn makes Empoleon a good pivot despite its low damage output, though Surf is still a reasonable alternative for doing good damage against Ground-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roost</strong>: Despite Empoleon's good defensive profile, Roost can be hard to fit in since it means either giving up support or coverage. Still, it does make Empoleon a better check with Flutter Mane when paired with Flash Cannon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calm versus Sassy</strong>: In addition to making Flip Turn stronger, Sassy's lower Speed can help Empoleon pivot out last.

Brave Bird makes short work of the aforementioned Fighting-types, as well as bulky Grass-types like Wo-Chien and Amoonguss, and threatens specially defensive Toxapex and Skeledirge with a 2HKO if they switch into it. Close Combat is what gives Staraptor its amazing wallbreaking potential, OHKOing Kingambit, Chien-Pao, Greninja, and Cyclizar while KOing Baxcalibur after Stealth Rock damage and threatening Iron Treads with a 2HKO. Final Gambit, boosted by 28 HP EVs, OHKOes targets Staraptor wouldn't otherwise beat, such as Rotom-W, physically defensive Toxapex, Hatterene, Klefki, and Forretress after Stealth Rock damage—denying dual screens and/or entry hazards from the last two. Alternatively, Double-Edge threatens checks like Rotom-W and Kilowattrel. Finally, U-turn allows this reckless bird to pivot into a teammate, if there really is nothing else it can do, such as against Gholdengo or Corviknight. Equipping a Choice Scarf will let it outspeed Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Walking Wake, which otherwise force it out, and threaten them instead.</p> <p>A great partner for Staraptor is Hisuian Zoroark. When it uses Illusion to disguise as Staraptor, pairing its Fighting immunity with Staraptor's Ground immunity, an apparent \"Staraptor\" could be immune to either type. This uncertainty completely dismantles Great Tusk. Furthermore, disguised as Staraptor, it can bait in an unsuspecting Corviknight, Gholdengo, or Dondozo to cripple or OHKO it. Maushold is another great partner thanks to Tidy Up, which keeps both Stealth Rock and Reflect off the field for Staraptor to not worry about. Also, its Population Bomb can break through Ting-Lu and non-Rocky Helmet Toxapex for Staraptor. A less prominent partner that also provides hazard removal, as well as Knock Off support, is Cyclizar. With Stealth Rock breaking Sturdy and further advancing Staraptor's wallbreaking, Blissey is another highly appreciated teammate to set it up, provide Healing Wish and Heal Bell support, and check both Sandy Shocks and Choice Scarf Greninja for Staraptor. Indeedee, likewise, offers Healing Wish support, as well as checking Poison-types like Toxapex and Glimmora that Staraptor struggles with.

Spikes or Stealth Rock allow Gastrodon to support its teammates by wearing down the opposing team. If the team already has entry hazards covered, Clear Smog can be used to stop common setup sweepers such as Victini and Clefable that would otherwise greatly threaten Gastrodon and its teammates. Scald is used to cripple both physical attackers and poison-immune Pokemon with a burn. Earthquake is an alternative for more immediate pressure against Poison- and Steel-types such as Okidogi and Iron Moth, but it leaves Gastrodon unable to punish switch-ins like Celesteela and Skarmory. The final moveslot is usually given to Toxic, which allows Gastrodon to slowly wear down its answers. Alternatively, Protect can be used in tandem with Leftovers to improve its longevity while also scouting common Choice-locked Pokemon such as Latios and Enamorus.

Gastrodon can get worn down quickly through poison and burn and therefore appreciates cleric support from Pokemon like Clefable and Blissey. Its low Defense also leaves it susceptible to strong physical attackers such as Mega Tyranitar and Bisharp, and therefore, it appreciates physical walls such as Tangrowth and Buzzwole that can handle those threats.

Tera Ground can block a Volt Switch and allow Drifblim to hit Rotom and Eelektross hard before forcing them to switch out.</p> <p>Drifblim can struggle with powerful special attackers such as Eelektross, Pyroar, and Zoroark, which can switch in thanks to Drifblim's passivity and threaten it. As a result, special walls such as Chansey, Muk, and Umbreon can be great partners. Sticky Hold Muk can also absorb Knock Off for Drifblim from physical attackers such as Passimian.</p>"

Fake Out lets Mega Lopunny serve as an exceptional revenge killer, dealing with worn down foes like Meowscarada, Barraskewda, and Alolan Raichu. It also puts Pokemon like Keldeo, Cinderace, and Tapu Koko in range of its other attacks safely. With Scrappy, Close Combat notably lets Mega Lopunny take on threats like Mega Sableye, Aegislash, and Gholdengo, threatening the defensive cores of Dark and Steel teams. U-turn enables Mega Lopunny to work as a potent offensive pivot, escaping unfavorable situations against walls like Slowbro and Mega Venusaur while keeping momentum. Triple Axel threatens common switch-ins such as Gliscor and Mandibuzz, while Return is Mega Lopunny's hardest-hitting move against most Psychic- and Fairy-types, such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. Blissey is a great teammate, taking on the likes of Volcarona and Zapdos thanks to its bulk while offering support in the form of Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Teleport. Staraptor switches into Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Buzzwole, and Tapu Bulu, and its access to Defog and U-turn also prolongs Mega Lopunny's longevity and lets it switch in unscathed. Special attackers like Hisuian Zoroark and Porygon-Z are able to break past physical walls Mega Lopunny can't, like Skeledirge, Corviknight, and Slowbro. Hisuian Zoroark also prevents Fighting-types from spamming their STAB moves aimed at Mega Lopunny.</p>"

It's a fantastic revenge killer thanks to its high-Base Power STAB moves and its ability, Scrappy. Fake Out is a fantastic priority move that inflicts meaningful chip damage onto offensive foes such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Koko, putting them all range of Frustration. U-turn provides momentum and allows Mega Lopunny to pivot out of its checks safely, such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk, and bring in its teammates. Alternatively, Quick Attack can be run to enhance Mega Lopunny's revenge killing capabilities, which helps against faster threats such as Dragapult and Booster Energy Iron Valiant. Triple Axel can also be run over U-turn to hit Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Tornadus-T, though this forgoes more consistent utility. Mega Lopunny sits very well on bulky offense teams, as they benefit from its Speed and pivoting abilities. Therefore, offensive Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Weavile all pair very well with it, forming great offensive cores by wallbreaking alongside Mega Lopunny. Mega Lopunny loses to Choice Specs Dragapult, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Zamazenta. Because of this, defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Heatran, and Gholdengo are appreciated in checking these threats; the former two also set entry hazards, further increasing Mega Lopunny's damage output in conjunction with Fake Out.</p>"

Furthermore, Skuntank's great defensive typing makes it a solid switch-in for foes like Gogoat and Indeedee-F. Crunch is Skuntank's best way to hit targets such as Misdreavus and Indeedee-F, but if instead running only two attacks, Skuntank can use Poison Jab over Gunk Shot for a reliable attack alongside Sucker Punch. Taunt can stop moves from slower foes that may try to abuse or cripple Skuntank such as Tinkatuff's Thunder Wave, Carbink's Iron Defense or Trick Room, as well as entry hazards from both. Toxic is another way to threaten bulky threats like Misdreavus if not running Crunch, Carbink, Gogoat, and Alolan Persian. Toxic Spikes punishes foes that don't hold Heavy-Duty Boots such as Gabite and Choice item Basculin, although it can be less reliable with the abundance of Heavy-Duty Boots in the metagame. If Skuntank is no longer needed, Aftermath allows it to punish contact moves from foes like Honchkrow and Flapple. Tera Dark makes Sucker Punch a more reliable revenge killing option while further boosting Crunch's damage. Tera Ground allows Skuntank to serve as a Volt Switch blocker and pairs well with Tera Blast to hit opposing Skuntank and Tinkatuff. Tera Flying can lure Ground moves like Charizard and Dugtrio's Earthquake to more easily pick them off in addition to removing Skuntank's weakness to Ground.</p> <p>With Skuntank only weak to Ground-types like Whiscash, allies that can absorb Ground-type attacks such as Gogoat, Flapple, and Rotom-F come in handy. Whiscash also makes a good partner to help with threats like Alolan Dugtrio and Tinkatuff, while Skuntank can deal with said Grass-types. Skuntank's Toxic and Toxic Spikes pair well with bulky Pokemon like Dachsbun and Chansey to stall out foes. Dachsbun's Wish and Chansey's Heal Bell also help with longevity. Misdreavus is a notably great teammate, as it offers a Ground immunity, can cripple threats such as Gabite and Perrserker with Will-O-Wisp, and can spinblock. Misdreavus can also run Hex to benefit from any poisoned foes. Item removal, such as Banette's Knock Off and Indeedee-F's Trick, can get rid off foes' Heavy-Duty Boots to benefit Toxic Spikes. Indeedee-F can also help with Skuntank's longevity via Healing Wish, although it is notable that its Psychic Surge temporarily hinders Skuntank's Sucker Punch. While being the best Toxic Spikes setter, Skuntank is also the best way to remove Toxic Spikes with the lack of hazard removal in the metagame.

Protect is also very valuable in scouting their coverage moves, letting Skuntank accumulate Black Sludge recovery, and stalling out poison damage. Aftermath punishes contact attackers like Kingambit and Azumarill, which allows teammates such as Toxicroak to safely come in and finish them off. Skuntank can run Play Rough to threaten common Dark-types of the metagame, such as Chien-Pao and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Physically defensive Amoonguss and Toxapex are valuable teammates that deal with the physical attackers that threaten Skuntank, like Mimikyu, Quaquaval, and Dondozo. Amoonguss also deals with threatening Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Sandy Shocks thanks to its good bulk, Grass-type STAB move, and Ground neutrality. Toxapex, on the other hand, deals with threats like Chien-Pao, Cloyster, and Scizor with Infestation and Haze while laying down Toxic Spikes. Specially defensive Clodsire complements Skuntank by dealing with special attackers it can't handle by itself, such as Gholdengo, Magnezone, and Volcarona. Iron Moth deals with the multitude of Steel-types like Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Corviknight that Skuntank can't do much against. Corrosion Glimmora and Salazzle help cripple Steel-types and opposing Poison-types with Toxic, with each also providing different utilities; Glimmora packs Poison's only entry hazard removal thanks to Mortal Spin, which allows Skuntank to come in safely, while Salazzle's Encore acts as a counterplay against powerful setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Kingambit.</p>"

Rough Skin adds to the support Gabite provides, helping it further wear down physical threats like Basculin and Zangoose for its teammates to finish off. Stone Edge nails Charizard and Articuno and also hits Rotom-F. Dragon Tail is useful against setup sweepers like Gogoat and Tera Fighting Carbink, but Gabite can use Swords Dance instead to double as a bulky wallbreaker. The investment in bulk lets Gabite avoid the 2HKO from Lycanroc-N's Play Rough after Stealth Rock and Charizard's Hurricane at full. 28 Speed EVs allow Gabite to outspeed defensive Misdreavus. Tera Ghost helps against Normal-types like Zangoose and Squawkabilly, provides an immunity to Carbink's Body Press, and lets Gabite spinblock. Tera Fairy is another option that staves off Dark- and Dragon-types like Alolan Persian and Flapple. Alternatively, Tera Steel offers useful resistances like Ice, Flying, and Grass and also lets Gabite come in freely on Toxic and Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Because of its unique blend of offense and defense, Gabite fits well on multiple playstyles. Ice-types like Rotom-F and Articuno are the biggest threat to Gabite and must be accounted for when using it. Charizard, Rotom-F, and Carbink are checks to such Pokemon and appreciate having their switch-ins worn down by Stealth Rock, with Charizard and Carbink also offering Gabite backup against Grass- and Fire-types, respectively. If Carbink runs Spikes, it can even form an entry hazard stacking core with Gabite. Pyroar is another option for checking Ice-types that also pressures Tera Fairy Misdreavus, which is really good at exploiting Gabite, and appreciates Gabite coming to its aid against threats like Alolan Dugtrio and Lycanroc-N. Wallbreakers that struggle against Steel-types, such as Indeedee-F and Honchkrow, benefit from Gabite's presence and can also check Misdreavus for it.

Dragon Tail helps with removing setup sweepers or passive Pokemon that Gabite can't deal with such as Gogoat, Misdreavus, or Vigoroth. However, its phazing ability is also impactful when there are entry hazards on the opponent's field. Rest gives Gabite recovery, while Sleep Talk keeps it from being too passive. 28 Speed allows it to outspeed non-invested Misdreavus, while 116 Special Defense makes Special Charizard's Hurricane a 3HKO. It still has enough physical bulk for Lycanroc-N's Play Rough to only be a 3HKO after Stealth Rock damage. Gabite has the ability to turn into a spinblocker with Tera Ghost, making it an option to keep its team's hazards stay on the field. Tera Fairy helps cover its Dragon-type weakness, which Dragonair and Flapple can exploit, while also providing it a resistance to the strong Dark-types in PU like Alolan Persian, Skuntank, and Houndoom. Tera Steel turns all of its weaknesses into resistances, but be aware of threats it normally can deal with becoming a problem like Alolan Dugtrio, Lycanroc-N, and opposing Gabite.</p> <p>RestTalk Gabite works best on balance and entry hazard stacking teams. Gabite can also fill the role of status absorber, able to take Misdreavus's or Charizard's Will-O-Wisp, Skuntank's Toxic, and Alolan Persian and Tinkatuff's Thunder Wave. It lacks the ability to be a heavy damage dealer with this set, so Pokemon that can hit it super effectively don't have much trouble coming in on it. The likes of Quaxwell, Mareanie, and Lumineon are appreciated for helping take what would be 4x super effective Ice-type attacks from Whiscash, Golduck, and Crabominable. In return, Gabite helps them with an Electric immunity from the likes of Raichu and Rotom-S. Tinkatuff and Perrserker can also help with these threats as well as covering Gabite's other issues with Flapple and Dragonair. Gabite does well at coming in on the premier Fire-type attackers in the tier: Charizard, Pyroar, and Houndoom. Offensive teammates such as Gogoat, Sawsbuck, and Nasty Plot Rotom-F appreciate its presence on their team as a switch-in for the aforementioned Fire-types, or else they struggle to set up. With many of the tier's top Pokemon having a 4x weakness to Rock, such as Articuno, Charizard, and Masquerain, Gabite can pair well with them, because it walls the likes of Lycanroc-N and Dugtrio which typically carry Rock coverage.</p>"

Garchomp's positive matchup versus the latter three in turn allow it to set and maintain Stealth Rock very well. Additionally, Garchomp’s solid natural bulk and good typing lets it find opportunities to set up on Pokemon like Heatran, Volcarona, and Iron Moth. Outrage with Dragonium Z gives Garchomp a stronger option that can notably OHKO Landorus-T at +1 while also OHKOing Great Tusk and Zapdos at +2. However, the Z-Move can require prediction if the opponent has a Fairy-type lest Garchomp become trapped into Outrage and easily revenge killed by foes such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. In comparison, Stone Edge bolstered by Rockium Z provides a more consistent attack for Garchomp outside of its Z-Move while hitting foes such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Corviknight harder than its Dragon-type Z-Move counterpart. Offensive teammates who can exploit the wallbreaking capabilities of Garchomp such as Mega Lopunny, Kartana, and Dragonite are appreciated, while teammates such as Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Ferrothorn give Garchomp a solid option to fall back on in the face of revenge killers such as Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p>"

Garchomp aims to punish physical attackers and force progression with entry hazards and Toxic. Dragon Tail lets Garchomp make the most of entry hazards laid by itself or teammates, being able to force foes to take damage at random if they lack Heavy-Duty Boots. Additionally, it can also be used to deny setup sweepers like Ogerpon-W, Iron Boulder, and Dragon Dance Gouging Fire lacking a Dragon-type STAB move. Garchomp can effectively lay both Stealth Rock and Spikes due to a positive matchup versus common hazard removal options such as Zapdos and Rotom-W while also dissuading Great Tusk from using Rapid Spin, as it will take serious chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. Toxic is another way to avoid passivity; it can be used to wear down foes such as Landorus-T, Alomomola, Zapdos, Great Tusk, and Dragonite. Tera Ghost is best used for deny Rapid Spin or to change its typing to survive other wise super effective hits such as Mega Diancie's Moonblast and Mega Medicham's Ice Punch. 56 Speed EVs are enough to outrun Modest Heatran. Mega Tyranitar is a solid partner, being able to remove Landorus-T and Great Tusk's Leftovers with Knock Off, which allows Garchomp to wear them down more easily with Toxic and Rough Skin in tandem with Rocky Helmet. Mega Tyranitar can also remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Alomomola and certain variants of Great Tusk, letting Garchomp's entry hazards rack up more damage. Garchomp really appreciates Alomomola’s Wish passing because it lacks a source of recovery. Garchomp's matchups against other Defoggers such as Corviknight, Gliscor, and Tornadus-T make it hard to keep hazards up at times, so teammates that can help with these Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos are appreciated alongside it. Galarian Slowking proves very useful to Garchomp because of its ability to check common Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, which usually force out Garchomp.

        "Entry Hazard Support (Dragon)": {
          "description": "<p>Garchomp is a staple of offensive Dragon teams, serving as an unrivaled entry hazard setter, phazer, and threat to key foes such as Iron Treads, Cinderace, Jirachi, and Iron Hands. It excels at getting up multiple layers of entry hazards due to its good bulk and Speed, powerful STAB Earthquake, and access to Rough Skin. The combination of Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet is fantastic for deterring Rapid Spin from foes such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads. It should be noted that if Rapid Spin causes the user to faint due to contact damage, it will not clear entry hazards, making Garchomp particularly adept at keeping hazards up. Moreover, Garchomp has enough bulk to survive an unboosted Ice Spinner from Iron Treads and Quaquaval, so it is relatively unafraid of the metagame’s most common spinners. Outside of warding off spinners, Rocky Helmet + Rough Skin renders Garchomp broadly threatening to physical attackers in general, punishing U-turns from foes such as Sneasler and Cinderace, causing non-Punching Glove Urshifu-R to nearly KO itself from full HP if it uses Surging Strikes on Garchomp, and breaking Dragonite's Multiscale. Dragon Tail rounds out this set by allowing Garchomp to deal good chip damage while forcing out spinners such as Great Tusk and Quaquaval and phazing setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Scizor. The switch forcing capabilities of Dragon Tail synergize incredibly well with this hazard stacking set, enabling Garchomp to rack up entry hazard damage on the opposing team as it repeatedly forces foes out.</p> <p>While Garchomp is excellent at deterring Rapid Spin by itself, Dragapult provides further security for its entry hazards by acting as a true spinblocker. Moreover, Choice Specs Dragapult greatly appreciates Garchomp’s entry hazards pushing foes into KO ranges and punishing switches, bolstering the already formidable offensive pressure these sets create. Dragapult further enjoys Garchomp’s ability to take on Kingambit, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Alolan Muk, while Garchomp is grateful for Choice Specs Dragapult threatening Corviknight and thus preventing Defog. Alternatively to Choice Specs, Hex Dragapult can also become an extremely threatening late-game cleaner when combined with Garchomp's entry hazards, and the burns it spreads further help accumulate chip damage on the opposing team. Additionally, Dragapult serves as a crucial check to Iron Defense Zamazenta, which Garchomp cannot phaze if it's behind a Substitute. Hisuian Goodra makes a great pairing with Garchomp, being able to soak up the Ice and Fairy moves aimed at Garchomp from foes such as Alolan Ninetales, Flutter Mane, and Iron Valiant while crushing them in return with its Heavy Slam. Hisuian Goodra can also tank a hit from Chien-Pao and OHKO it in retaliation with Body Press, soak up hits from Choice Specs Greninja, and handle opposing Choice Specs Dragapult. In exchange, Garchomp can duel physical threats such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Sneasler for Hisuian Goodra. Dragon’s various setup sweepers such as Baxcalibur, Kommo-o, Hydreigon, and Dragonite all greatly value Garchomp’s entry hazards pushing foes into KO ranges and breaking the Focus Sashes of foes such as Ceruledge and Breloom, enabling their sweeps. Of these, Kommo-o is especially notable, as its Vacuum Wave can OHKO Chien-Pao at neutral and Greninja following a Clangorous Soul and Throat Spray boost, both of which are incredibly deadly to Garchomp. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon is a great partner to Garchomp, appreciating Garchomp’s entry hazards and ability to wear down Great Tusk and Iron Treads facilitating its late-game cleaning. Roaring Moon in turn supports Garchomp by smashing through Flutter Mane and opposing Dragapult, as well as opening up foes such as Toxapex and Amoonguss to hazard damage by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots with its brutal STAB Knock Off. Choice Scarf Walking Wake appreciates Garchomp’s entry hazards in the same vein while removing threats such as Landorus, Gliscor, Great Tusk, +1 Baxcalibur, and Chien-Pao. If instead using Choice Specs, Walking Wake’s synergy with Garchomp increases even further, as it can blast through Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Rotom-W with its powerful STAB attacks and coverage. Walking Wake can also use Flip Turn to pivot Garchomp in against foes such as Toxapex and Alolan Muk. Cyclizar can clear entry hazards from its side of the field while keeping Garchomp’s up with Rapid Spin; it can also prevent Defog from Corviknight and Mandibuzz with Taunt and remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off. Dragalge can compound on Garchomp’s entry hazards with its own Toxic Spikes and use its Fairy neutrality and fierce Adaptability-boosted Poison-type moves to eradicate Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant, Azumarill, and Clefable.</p>"

Even on Choice Scarf sets, Scale Shot is a less risky Dragon-type attack over Outrage, and outspeeding extremely fast threats like Booster Energy Iron Bundle is welcome.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head</strong>: With Tera Steel, Iron Head lets Choice Band Garchomp 2HKO Charm Flutter Mane, who can otherwise edge out a victory with Pain Split and repeated Attack drops.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stone Edge versus Rock Tomb</strong>: Rock Tomb is fairly weak, but the speed control can be very useful on Choice Scarf variants if sacrificing Garchomp. Stone Edge deals massive damage to common Tera Flying Pokemon such as Gholdengo, and it prevents it from being walled by Tera Fairy Levitate Pokemon like Latias.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Fire Fang</strong> While weak, this is Garchomp's best option against Corviknight and Tera Steel Latiias when not Tera Fire.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / Low</strong>: When using the slower Choice Band variants, Terastallization becomes important for avoiding revenge kills.

Swords Dance can turn Garchomp into a potential wallbreaking threat, notably OHKOing unboosted Zamazenta-C and threatening a 2HKO on defensive Kommo-o and RegenVest Manaphy at +2, while Fire Blast chips Corviknight and Earth Eater Gholdengo. A Sassy Nature is preferred if running Fire Blast, sacrificing Speed to avoid a cut to Special Attack. Regenerator allows Garchomp to come in repeatedly over the course of a game. Strong attackers like Tail Glow Manaphy, Dragonite, and Zamazenta-C appreciate the entry hazards set by Garchomp softening up foes to be more vulnerable to their powerful attacks while also appreciating the defensive backbone Garchomp provides. Corviknight is an ideal partner for Garchomp, handling monstrous physical threats like Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon, while Garchomp handles special attackers like Iron Moth, Zapdos, and Heatran in return.

Draco Meteor is the STAB move of choice, surprising offensive Great Tusk with a 2HKO, while Fire Blast 2HKOes Corviknight. Download is a niche option over Regenerator, letting it secure a 2HKO on Mandibuzz and offensive Manaphy with Draco Meteor while also freeing your Regenerator slot for a teammate like Kommo-o or Great Tusk, but it comes at the cost of cutting into Garchomp's longevity. Life Orb notably guarantees the 2HKO on specially defensive Garchomp with Draco Meteor. Offensive threats like Manaphy, Azelf, and Iron Moth appreciate Garchomp for its entry hazards and ability to threaten common defensive foes, chipping them down to be picked off later in the game. Defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Zapdos, and RegenVest Manaphy appreciate Garchomp outspeeding and threatening powerful offensive threats such as Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Sandy Shocks, while Garchomp appreciates these defensive partners handling the faster attackers like Azelf and Chien-Pao that force Garchomp out. Garchomp is worn down very easily by hazards and appreciates Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Quaquaval and Wish support from Scream Tail, allowing it to come in repeatedly over the course of the game while greatly improving its longevity, especially if running Download. Garchomp also struggles to break through common defensive foes like Scream Tail and Earth Eater Empoleon, so it appreciates teammates such as Gengar and Zamazenta-C, which can break down these walls.</p>"

Swords Dance allows Garchomp to threaten hazard removers like Quaquaval and act as a potential wincon late-game, while Dragon Tail forces switches, racking up entry hazard chip damage and preventing setup, and Liquidation hits both Landorus formes and Levitate Iron Treads and chips Corviknight. Regenerator allows it to switch in more times throughout a game to find opportunities to set up entry hazards or Swords Dance, while Well-Baked Body punishes Fire-types like Cinderace and Ceruledge for clicking their strong STAB moves and increases its walling capabilities. Garchomp's inability to check threats like Chien-Pao and Galarian Zapdos facilitates another physical wall like Corviknight or Zapdos, which can switch into them and pivot out. Garchomp's inability to check special threats like Azelf, Gengar, and Walking Wake makes special walls like RegenVest Manaphy and Goodra great partners if Garchomp is not using Regenerator; if Garchomp is using Regenerator, Blissey and Empoleon are alternative options as special walls.</p>"

Life Orb, Adaptability, and an Adamant nature provide a crucial power boost, letting unboosted Mega Garchomp OHKO Mega Steelix and 2HKO Fur Coat Arceus-Poison. If desired, Defense EVs can be lowered to allow Mega Garchomp to always OHKO Eviolite Imposter Chansey with +1 Glaive Rush. Mega Garchomp pairs well with other physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X to heavily pressure Fur Coat users like Yveltal and Arceus-Ghost; in return they appreciate Mega Garchomp handling Arceus-Poison and Miraidon.

Its superb bulk enables it to check some of the metagame’s most dangerous threats in Pawmot, Salamence, Tyranitar, and Sandy Shocks. It also provides value through Sand Stream to help combat rain teams if given momentum to get in freely, as it can't hard switch into Water-types. Stone Edge enables Hippowdon to pressure Flying-types like Iron Jugulis and Salamence, in addition to being able to beat Taunt Dragon Dance Tyranitar even after it Terastallizes. Roar is also an option, as it allows Hippowdon to phaze setup sweepers like Polteageist in a pinch and synergizes well with entry hazards. Leftovers is the preferred item, as its residual healing improves Hippowdon's overall longevity and preserves Slack Off's PP. The given spread with an Impish nature and Leftovers avoids a 2HKO from Life Orb Pawmot and prevents Hippowdon from being KOed by Hurricane into Draco Meteor from Salamence after Stealth Rock while avoiding a 2HKO from Sandy Shocks without Stealth Rock. Rocky Helmet is also an option to punish physical attackers, primarily U-turn users and Maushold. A specially defensive spread is an option to handle Gengar if Pawmot is less of a concern. Tera Rock pairs well with its sand, as the Special Defense boost it receives gives it a strong matchup versus special attackers like Gengar, Salamence, and Noivern. Additionally, Tera Rock boosts Hippowdon’s Stone Edge to put more pressure on targets like Salamence. After Hippowdon has Terastallized, it is threatened by Pawmot, Sandy Shocks, and Tyranitar, so be careful when Terastallizing. Tera Ghost is an option that makes Hippowdon a strong response versus Slither Wing, Lucario, and Maushold and lets it spinblock against Donphan. Tera Fairy is an option that grants Hippowdon a generally good defensive typing, including a Fighting resistance, and makes it less vulnerable to Greninja. After becoming a Fairy- or a Ghost-type, Hippowdon is unable to check Gengar, and in the case of the latter, Tyranitar sets running Crunch as well. Tera Dragon makes Hippowdon an effective answer to rain teams through the useful Water-type resistance it provides.</p> <p>Hippowdon most commonly fits on bulky offense or balance teams for its walling capabilities. Talonflame and Noivern make for good partners, as they are capable of grabbing momentum with U-turn off of opposing Decidueye and Wo-Chien swapping in to exploit Hippowdon. Hippowdon can in return easily absorb Knock Off from the likes of Tinkaton in order to preserve the Heavy-Duty Boots they both depend on. Wo-Chien is also a solid pick for a partner as a nice fit on most balance teams, as well as an answer to bulky Water-types that may attempt to annoy Hippowdon. In particular, Wo-Chien’s RestTalk set is capable of swapping in on Quagsire easily, as it is able to shrug off Toxic. Wo-Chien can also relieve pressure from Hippowdon, as it can take on Sandy Shocks. Tinkaton also makes for a good partner, as it is able to take a lot of the pressure off of Hippowdon by taking hits from Gengar and specially offensive Flying-types such as Iron Jugulis, Noivern, and Salamence. Tinkaton is also capable of providing useful Knock Off support by removing opposing Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots to enable Hippowdon’s Stealth Rock and sandstorm damage to stick. In return, Hippowdon being able to carry Stealth Rock means that Tinkaton does not need to run it itself and can fit a more useful option. Assault Vest Cyclizar is able to check Greninja and Wo-Chien for Hippowdon and keep Spikes or Toxic Spikes off the field from the former.</p>"

Hippowdon can Terastallize into the Steel typing to avoid Toxic in addition to Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks while maintaining its sand immunity and Stealth Rock resistance. Even beyond the simple type matchup chart changes, it allows Hippowdon to more easily check its targets such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and Mega Diancie. Maximum Special Defense EVs are ran due to Hippowdon having more valuable special targets than physical, namely the aforementioned Pokemon. Mega Lopunny and Tornadus-T appreciate Hippowdon's presence, as it checks both Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Zapdos while setting up Stealth Rock to help wear down their checks. Defensively, Hippowdon supports Pokemon such as Garganacl and Skarmory; Garganacl appreciates the sand and its attached benefits and Skarmory appreciates the sturdy Ground-type anchor and special wall. Hippowdon struggles to fend off strong physical attackers like Kingambit, Mega Scizor, Kartana, and Mega Gyarados. For this reason, it pairs exquisitely with strong physical walls such as Skarmory and Buzzwole. Hippowdon also suffers from a Spikes vulnerability, meaning it appreciates Defog support from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Zapdos.</p>"

It’s also notable for letting Hippowdon retain immunity to its own Sandstorm chip.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry’s burst recovery is what allows properly invested Hippowdon to avoid 2HKO’s from some of the meta’s strongest attackers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: If Hippowdon is able to execute an extended Yawn loop, Leftovers passive recovery is a great boon. Such loops can often force the opponent to sacrifice something to sleep to prevent Hippowdon from healing up to full.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: While Hippowdon’s support focus makes this a less common item choice, Slack Off combined with smart usage of Terastallization can make this item work to surprising effect.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: Patching up Hippowdon's weaker Special Defense is extremely useful against special attackers. With this maximized spread, Hippowdon has a 6.3% chance of surviving Timid Gholdengo's +2 Make It Rain, always survives Modest Chi-Yu’s unboosted Overheat, and avoids the 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane’s Moonblast if using Sitrus Berry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with Impish</strong>: A physically defensive spread means not even Choice Band Dragonite’s Outrage will be able to 2HKO Sitrus Berry Hippowdon.</p> </li> </ul>"

Tera Dark gives it a useful Psychic immunity to better the odds versus opposing Bruxish while increasing the power of Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Tera Fighting Toxicroak is able to OHKO Sandaconda, which usually checks it, after a Swords Dance. Toxicroak struggles against the aforementioned Drifblim and Rotom and, without Tera Fighting, Sandaconda. Teammates such as Vaporeon, Eelektross, and Rotom can switch in on its checks and bring it into battle safely.

Alternatively, Vacuum Wave is a solid STAB move with priority to help it revenge kill faster threats like Zoroark, Lycanroc, and Tera Ice Jolteon. Tera Fighting heavily increases Focus Blast's already high damage output, allowing Toxicroak to rip through bulkier teams. Tera Fighting Toxicroak can run a Modest nature to give it a favorable chance to 2HKO Muk at +2 with Focus Blast; however, it becomes noticeably slower, getting outpaced by Mabosstiff, Bombirdier, and Braviary. Tera Dark Toxicroak better checks Bruxish while also boosting Dark Pulse's power.</p> <p>Without the use of its Tera type, Toxicroak struggles against bulkier teams that often include Muk or Crocalor, so Pokemon that put pressure on them like Sandaconda and Bruxish pair well with it. Bruxish, as well as other Water-types like Clawitzer, appreciate Toxicroak checking bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Qwilfish. Toxicroak often relies on Spikes from users such as Qwilfish, Vespiquen, and Cacturne to chip away at foes that it can't handle on its own.

Close Combat and Gunk Shot can sweep through even remotely weakened teams, especially with a Tera-Fighting Close Combat. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types that resist Close Combat such as Dachsbun, Florges, and Tera Fairy Drifblim. Earthquake threatens Poison-types such as Muk and Qwilifish. Rock Slide hits Pokemon such as Drifblim and Vespiquen, which may otherwise be troublesome for Toxicroak to deal with.

This pairs well with Encore impairing Pokemon such as Whiscash or Masquerain attempting to set up entry hazards or boost their stats. Storm Drain allows Lumineon to blanket check some Water-type attackers such as Choice-locked Basculin and Golduck. Tera Grass is normally preferred, giving Lumineon a resistance to Grass- and Electric-type attacks that it would otherwise fear from Pokemon such as Gogoat and Raichu. Alternatively, Tera Dragon can give the same resistances as well as an added resistance to Fire-type attacks in exchange for a resistance to Ground-type attacks. Tera Ghost is an option to wall Quaxwell and check offensive Normal-types such as Zangoose and Pyroar better. Lumineon normally uses a specially defensive EV spread with a Calm nature to take on threats such as Pyroar, Houndoom, and Alolan Persian well, but a more physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature allows Lumineon to take on physically offensive foes such as Dragon Dance Charizard, Basculin, and Perrserker better.</p> <p>Lumineon's best partners are ones that appreciate having a pivot to tank hits for them and allow them in safely as well as ones that enjoy Lumineon's ability to tank Water-type attacks.

Fire-types like Charizard and Pyroar form a strong core with Lumineon, with Lumineon absorbing the Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Basculin they fear, and in return they break Grass-type threats like Gogoat and Sawsbuck that Lumineon would struggle against. Other Pokemon with pivoting moves such as Alolan Persian, Perrserker, and Electrode can form a VoltTurn core with Lumineon, with Alolan Persian in particular completing a powerful defensive core with by tanking physical hits Lumineon can normally struggle with.

Earth Power takes care of Steel-types that can easily switch into Abomasnow safely like Magneton and Tera Steel Appletun. Ice Shard can be used to finish off Pokemon like Scyther and Mesprit, but it can be a wasted moveslot at times because you give up coverage or Aurora Veil. Leech Seed can be used to trade hits more easily with Blissey, which walls Abomasnow otherwise. A Timid nature is key to outspeed Modest Magneton and neutral-nature Samurott. A Choice Specs set can be run, but being locked into one move can be somewhat detrimental due to its Stealth Rock weakness and loss of bulk.

While Wood Hammer is more powerful, Seed Bomb can be used over it to still threaten Blissey without recoil. Ice Shard picks off weakened, faster threats like Scyther, Hisuian Sneasel, and Lilligant. Earthquake hits the Steel-types that resist Abomasnow’s STAB moves like Magneton and Tera Steel Appletun. Tera Fire allows Abomasnow to resist hits from Scyther, Pyroar, Magneton, and opposing Abomasnow, giving it a free turn to setup or attack while also granting an immunity to Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Drifblim and Rotom. Tera Ground can be used instead to boost the power of Earthquake, give Abomasnow a Stealth Rock resistance, and surprise Electric-types using Volt Switch.</p> <p>Ice Shard allows Abomasnow to take out offensive checks like Hisuian Sneasel and Scyther after a Swords Dance boost with minimal chip. To get this chip, Rocky Helmet Pokemon like Qwilfish and Sandaconda work well with Abomasnow, enabling it to facilitate a sweep. Flying- and Fighting-types like Scyther and Toxicroak threaten Abomasnow out, so checks like Rotom, Sableye, and Sandaconda pair well alongside it. Choice Scarf Mesprit pairs well with Abomasnow, threatening Fighting-types out and giving Abomasnow a second chance to sweep with the aid of Healing Wish. Articuno acts as a hard wall for Abomasnow, as it gets a Defense boost in snow and access to Haze. Pokemon like Magneton and Rotom can take advantage of Articuno by threatening it with Volt Switch to obtain momentum and crippling it with Trick, respectively. Pyroar also deals with Articuno quite well with Taunt, blocking Articuno’s Roost, in combination with Will-O Wisp, which lets Pyroar chip away at it.</p>"

Its Grass typing provides a way to deal with Water-types such as Azumarill, Basculegion, and Quagsire. Giga Drain is its main STAB move, dealing damage while providing recovery for Abomasnow. Alternatively, it can use Grass Knot in replacement of Giga Drain, allowing it to 2HKO Dondozo. Earth Power allows Abomasnow to hit Steel- and Fire-types, 2HKOing Kingambit and Torkoal and OHKOing offensive Heatran on the switch. The given EV spread allows Abomasnow to outspeed defensive Rotom-W, bulky Gholdengo, and Adamant Azumarill. Abomasnow can run either Icy Rock for more snow turns, which is preferred in Cetitan teams, or Light Clay for more Aurora Veil turns.</p> <p>Cetitan highly appreciates Abomasnow's snow, as it can utilize Slush Rush to outspeed threats such as Iron Moth, Walking Wake, and Iron Treads. With Earthquake, it serves as a good sweeper against Poison, Steel, and Fire teams, which Abomasnow struggles to go against. Other setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Chien-Pao, Frosmoth, Baxcalibur, and Cloyster  enjoy the Defense boost in snow, increasing their survivability and letting them set up and sweep the opposing team. Cloyster is able to survive a Choice Band-boosted Sacred Sword from Chien-Pao under snow and hit it back with a +2 Rock Blast. Baxcalibur is able to survive an Iron Head from Kingambit and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Chien-Pao acts as a strong wallbreaker that appreciates being able to take hits under snow due to its frailty. Frosmoth deals with the Water-type matchup along with Abomasnow, being able to set up a Quiver Dance and sweep the opposing team. The snow also allows the aforementioned setup sweepers to survive revenge killing attempts from foes such as Sucker Punch Kingambit and Extreme Speed Dragonite. Froslass provides team support in Taunt and its own hazards in Spikes, as well as Destiny Bond, which can take out a foe and give Abomasnow a free switch-in. Avalugg's great Defense and access to Rapid Spin make it a great teammate under snow, checking the likes of Kingambit, Iron Treads, and Urshifu-R while also acting as hazard control for its team.</p>"

Weavile also provides excellent speed control for teams, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame besides Darkrai, Zamazenta, Dragapult, and Deoxys-S while being able to slot in Ice Shard to pick off +1 Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Enamorus. Swords Dance allows Weavile to OHKO bulky Pokemon like defensive Great Tusk, Kyurem, and Ting-Lu at +2 with Triple Axel and OHKO Enamorus and Dragapult after Stealth Rock with Ice Shard. Low Kick can be slotted over Swords Dance to OHKO opposing Weavile, Hisuian Samurott, and Kingambit, but dropping Swords Dance limits Weavile's power and leaves it always walled by Skarmory and Clefable. Tera Ice boosts Triple Axel and Ice Shard to increase its wallbreaking and revenge killing potential, with +2 Tera Ice Triple Axel OHKOing Clefable and most Skarmory variants after Stealth Rock damage while +2 Tera Ice Ice Shard OHKOes Dragonite. Tera Dark can be ran to boost Knock Off, with it now having significant odds of OHKOing specially defensive Skeledirge and specially defensive Heatran as well as 2HKOing Alomomola at +2 while still stomaching Kingambit's Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Weavile's excellent wallbreaking capabilities and capability to fit on offense, balance, and semi-stall teams give it great synergy with a wide variety of Pokemon. Spikers are the best Pokemon to pair with Weavile because Weavile is excellent at using Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. On slower teams, spikers that benefit from Weavile include Gliscor, Skarmory and Ting-Lu, while on faster teams, Weavile supports Hisuian Samurott and Deoxys-S. Stealth Rock is less effective against most Weavile answers other than Skarmory and Corviknight, but they still synergize with Weavile's Knock Off. Stealth Rock setters on offensive teams include Glimmora and Landorus-T, while bulkier teams can make use of Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Clefable. Weavile also benefits other physical attackers that appreciate Weavile using Knock Off on Pokemon like Skarmory, Dondozo, Corviknight, and Alomomola. Kingambit is the biggest beneficiary of Weavile's Knock Off, but other physical attackers like Hisuian Samurott and Gouging Fire can also take advantage of its Knock Off to break through Pokemon like Dondozo and prevent chip damage from Skarmory's Rocky Helmet. Special attackers like Volcarona, Raging Bolt, and Dragapult can draw in special walls like Ting-Lu, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire for Weavile to come in on for opportunities to use Knock Off; Dragapult in particular can use U-turn to pivot into Weavile. Weavile struggles with faster Pokemon that can't be threatened with Ice Shard, which includes boosted Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and boosted Iron Boulder. On slower teams, Pokemon that can wall these faster foes are appreciated like Clodsire and Galarian Slowking for Iron Valiant, while Dondozo and Skarmory are best for Iron Boulder and Zamazenta. On faster teams, Gholdengo and priority users like Raging Bolt can check them. Galarian Slowking in particular is excellent, as Weavile appreciates support from Chilly Reception giving it entry on Pokemon like Gholdengo and Ting-Lu, while Future Sight prevents switch-ins like Zamazenta, Dondozo and Skarmory from coming in. Dondozo, Zamazenta and Skarmory can counter Weavile, but Dragapult and Gholdengo can swap into their attacks and force progress; Dragapult threatens heavy damage or burn while Gholdengo can use these Pokemon to boost with Nasty Plot.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Weavile's potent STAB combination and great offensive stats give it an excellent place in the National Dex metagame, with its ability to threaten teams offensively and Pursuit trap Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking, easing matchups for teammates such as Sneasler and Tapu Lele. Triple Axel threatens OHKOs on offensive Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Kartana, and Sneasler and 2HKOs on physically defensive Ferrothorn after minimal chip damage. Knock Off is a powerful STAB option that heavily damages switch-ins predicting Triple Axel such as Rotom-W, Heatran, and Alomomola. Ice Shard gives Weavile some form of speed control and helps finish off weakened foes that normally threaten it such as Mega Lopunny, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Koko, as well as boosted Pokemon such as Tera Flying Unburden Sneasler and Tera Grass Volcarona. Furthermore, Weavile's longevity, and therefore its offensive pressure, is limited by its weakness to Stealth Rock, so Defoggers such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T are all very helpful. Mega Scizor's U-turn and Alomomola's Flip Turn are also appreciated to bring Weavile in safely, due to its frailty. In return, Weavile helps these Pokemon out by getting rid of thorns such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Mega Charizard Y, letting Scizor have a larger role offensively, as well as removing Pokemon like Gholdengo and Zapdos for Alomomola, which can use Alomomola as setup fodder and threaten an OHKO with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch to gain momentum, respectively. Mega Medicham and Iron Valiant are both excellent partners for Weavile, taking care of Toxapex, as well as bulky Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, with Weavile Pursuit trapping Gholdengo for both of them or forcing it to Terastallize. Although Tera Dark is the preferred Tera type in order to mitigate Weavile's weakness to Stealth Rock and boost Knock Off to absurd levels, Tera Ice can also be used, making Ice Shard an extremely threatening priority move, able to even 2HKO Pokemon that pressure Weavile such as Tapu Koko and Iron Valiant.</p>"

        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Weavile is a niche Swords Dance user, being able to use its high Speed in conjunction with powerful STAB moves in Triple Axel and Throat Chop or Knock Off to break or clean amply weakened teams. Darkinium Z with Throat Chop gives Weavile a powerful option to break through the likes of Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Alomomola, especially when boosted; meanwhile, Heavy-Duty Boots provides it with better longevity and lets it use Knock Off instead, giving Weavile a more powerful utility presence for its team by removing Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers from the aforementioned foes. Tera Dark is used with Heavy-Duty Boots to make up for the power lost from the lack of a Z-Move, while notably shedding Weavile's weakness to Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch and Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball. Weavile can help teammates break through bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Alomomola, naturally making Mega Lopunny and Urshifu-R quality teammates, as they can clean up with ease after this. Weavile, however, struggles to find opportunities to use Swords Dance versus more offensive teams, so Mega Lopunny also helps by easing the matchup versus frailer offensive teams. Weavile can be answered by defensive Terastallization from Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Great Tusk, so Tapu Koko, which can freely fire off strong Electric-type attacks once these foes Terastallize, work well in conjunction with Weavile. Additionally, Tapu Koko denies Dondozo, another check to Weavile, the ability to use Rest as it summons Electric Terrain.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Magnezone combines its ability to trap and remove certain Steel-types with potent special wallbreaking prowess that lets it rip through common defensive staples such as Tapu Fini, Clefable, and Mega Tyranitar. It is an effective pivot with Volt Switch, though it must be wary of Ground-types like Hippowdown and Excadrill switching in. Hidden Power Grass primarily targets Gastrodon and Quagsire, and it also hits other, rarer Pokemon that share their type combination like Swampert. Hidden Power Fire is an alternative to hit Excadrill on the switch and also OHKO Scizor after trapping it. Magnezone best fits on offense teams looking for a means to remove Steel-types, primarily Skarmory and Celesteela. Removing the former enables numerous physical attackers, such as Mega Tyranitar and Scizor while removing the latter enables teammates such as Latios and Enamorus. Pivots such as Slowking can form effective pivoting cores with Magnezone, helping it safely switch into foes like Slowbro and Clefable; physically attacking pivots like Scizor can notably lure Skarmory in. Due to Skarmory possessing Sturdy and Body Press, Stealth Rock support from teammates such as Mega Tyranitar and Clefable greatly aids Magnezone. Magnezone struggles to take on Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Ting-Lu, and depending on its choice of coverage, it's walled by Ground / Water types like Gastrodon or Ground / Steel types like Excadrill, making Grass- and Water-types such as Mega Venusaur and Keldeo useful partners. Magnezone struggles to break through special walls like Chansey and Blissey, making the aforementioned physical wallbreakers useful; Pursuit trappers such as Mega Tyranitar and Bisharp are especially effective at removing these foes, and they appreciate Magnezone's pivoting capabilities.</p>"

Hidden Power Grass targets Gastrodon, Quagsire, and some rare foes like Swampert. Electrium Z powering up Thunderbolt helps Magnezone break through certain foes it traps such as Scizor and specially defensive Celesteela; Steelium Z primarily helps against Ground- and Grass-types such as Hippowdon and Mega Venusaur. Magenzone best fits on offense teams looking to remove certain Steel-types, namely Skarmory and Celesteela. This enables numerous teammates such as Mega Tyranitar and Scizor. Since it fears taking Skarmory's Body Press and Celesteela's Flamethrower upon switching in, a pivot that can lure them in like Galarian Zapdos or Scizor is a great partner. A Stealth Rock setter like Clefable can let Magnezone avoid Sturdy to OHKO Skarmory. Magnezone is completely helpless against Excadrill, so Grass- and Water-types such as Tangrowth and Slowbro can help by dealing with them. After removing opposing Steel-types, Magnezone isn't particularly useful, though it's still a reasonably strong special wallbreaker, especially if it still can use its Z-Move. It struggles with special walls like Blissey and Chansey, so physical wallbreakers, notably Pursuit trappers like Mega Tyranitar, can help by removing them.</p>"

Volt Switch lets Magnezone maintain momentum while eliminating foes such as Skarmory and chipping Heatran, which cannot be trapped and removed consistently. Alternatively, Tera Blast + Tera Fighting lets Magnezone remove Kingambit, potentially forcing it to Terastallize as well. Hidden Power Fire hits foes such as the aforementioned Mega Scizor, Kartana, and Ferrothorn. Toxic is another alternative that punishes switch-ins such as Gastrodon, Ting-Lu, and Hippowdon, though it can be difficult to justify over other alternatives, as it hinders Magnezone's effectiveness as a trapper. Magnezone should only Terastallize when it can trap and eliminate Kingambit, since teammates such as Dragapult and Dragonite take advantage of Tera better. The given EV spread allows Magnezone to survive an unboosted Sacred Sword from Kartana. Teammates such as Dragonite and Kartana appreciate Magnezone removing foes such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, allowing them to sweep easier. The former can also safely switch into Ground-type attacks for Magnezone, while the latter threatens troublesome Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Teammates such as Dragapult and Landorus-T provide pivoting support for Magnezone, granting it free entry against foes such as Skarmory and Kingambit to ease prediction. Dragapult in particular appreciates Magnezone trapping and removing Kingambit, allowing it to sweep without fear of being Pursuit trapped.</p>"

It also gives Magnezone a much-appreciated Fire resistance for Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Volcarona, and lets Magnezone take on Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying has wonderful defensive synergy with Magnezone, reversing its Ground and Fighting weaknesses, and lets Tera Blast hit Grass-types harder.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: A Fairy-type Tera Blast is very useful against common Dragon-types, most notably Garchomp and Roaring Moon, and hitting bulky Dark-types such as Ting-Lu, Wo-Chien, and Umbreon hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Gaining a resistance to Dark allows Magnezone to surprise and defeat Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Hydreigon, in addition to dealing plenty of damage to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Grass has excellent defensive and offense synergy with Magnezone, especially through its utility against Ground-type attackers and Spore immunity. Most notably, Tera Blast Grass can OHKO max SpD Hippowdon with Choice Specs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: The boost from Tera Steel makes Steel Beam absurdly powerful, with Analytic letting Choice Specs Magnezone OHKO even offensive Multiscale Dragonite!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground helps against opposing Magnezone, OHKOs Iron Moth, and deals good damage against Gholdengo and Kingambit.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: Magnezone's excellent typing means investing in bulk is a great idea.

If using Calm, Magnezone can even take on Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs gives Magnezone a devastating amount of power, with even Clodsire having trouble handling it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: The temporary Ground-type immunity helps Magnezone against foes like Garchomp and Dragonite without Terastallizing.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Analytic</strong>: A Magnezone boosted by both Choice Specs and Analytic is incredibly hard to switch into, making it easier for Magnezone to generate momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: With Sturdy's guaranteed survivability and Magnezone's high damage output, Magnezone will very likely take down at least one Pokemon per game. Sturdy also helps Magnezone play around Dondozo, as it can safely come in on Fissure and use Volt Switch against it, which renders Yawn moot. However, if Magnezone switches into a Yawn and not Fissure, it should be noted that Dondozo often runs Protect to block Volt Switch and ensure Magnezone falls asleep.</p> </li> </ul>"

Regenerator only serves to further complement the aforementioned defensive traits, blessing it with the longevity needed to repeatedly switch into and answer these Pokemon. Knock Off allows Tangrowth to cripple incoming switch-ins by removing important held items, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Thundurus and Leftovers from Clefable and Celesteela, making them far easier to wear down in the long-term. Hidden Power Fire allows Tangrowth to deal high amounts of damage to Steel and Grass-type Pokemon in a pinch, most notably 2HKOing Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast greatly improves Tangrowth's matchup against Dragon Dance variants of Mega Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Bisharp, being able to OHKO the latter, although its lack of accuracy can be somewhat irritating. Sleep Powder allows Tangrowth to neutralize incoming targets it would otherwise be unable to threaten, such as Iron Moth, offensive Celesteela, and Skarmory while also shutting down setup sweepers like Iron Hands, Calm Mind Clefable, and Mega Altaria. However, Toxic can be used instead to permanently cripple Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Salamence, and Slowking, limiting their ability to pivot into Tangrowth throughout the game. Rocky Helmet allows Tangrowth to punish contact moves from the likes of U-turn  as well as Buzzwole, whereas Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to provide Tangrowth with greater longevity against entry hazards, allowing it to take advantage of Regenerator more effectively; it also helps keep Tangrowth out of KO range of wallbreakers it may try to switch in against, such as Iron Hands and Terrakion when entry hazards have been set. Tangrowth fits best on balance teams that appreciate its longevity and diversity in crippling opposing teams via its utility options. Entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu, Clefable, and Toxic Spikes Iron Moth appreciate Tangrowth's ability to deter opposing hazard removal options such as Tapu Fini and Salamence while further capitalizing on Tangrowth's tendency to remove various items from targets, such as Thundurus-T and Amoonguss, with Knock Off. Specially defensive teammates such as Slowking, Gastrodon, and Celesteela have excellent defensive synergies with Tangrowth, compensating for its low Special Defense by providing a solid backbone against threats such as Latios, Hydreigon, and Alakazam; Slowking and Gastrodon also help Tangrowth play around with the likes of Keldeo, utility Clefable, and Victini, which can overwhelm it easily. In return, Tangrowth can help check the likes of Iron Hands and Bisharp, which may threaten them. Besides the aforementioned Pokemon, offensive teammates such as Victini, Choice Specs Enamorus, and both Thundurus formes appreciate Tangrowth's ability to sponge Knock Off from Pokemon that they may be forced out by, such as Mega Tyranitar, Clefable, and Scizor.</p>"

It can safely switch into and check physical threats like Mega Lopunny, Mega Swampert, Kartana, and Great Tusk as well as scout for Choice item users such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Knock Off provides further utility by crippling switch-ins like Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Heatran, and it hits Dragapult and Gholdengo super effectively. Hidden Power Fire pressures Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor—the former of which can use Tangrowth as setup fodder otherwise—while Hidden Power Ice dents Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Earthquake is an option to threaten Steel-types hard, including Heatran, as well as Tapu Koko and Clodsire. Stun Spore or Sleep Powder cripples foes like Tornadus-T, Volcarona, and Iron Valiant, preventing Tangrowth from being taken advantage of by them, especially if not running the appropriate coverage move. Nature Power—if paired with Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain—immediately pressures Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y. Rocky Helmet chips down the physical attackers that Tangrowth checks, especially pivot attempts from the likes of Mega Swampert and Landorus-T, but Heavy-Duty Boots makes it a sturdier pivot in the face of entry hazards. Tera Steel improves Tangrowth's matchup against foes like Weavile, Tornadus-T, and non-Close Combat Mega Scizor, and it prevents it from being crippled by Toxapex, Clodsire, and Glimmora's poison. Teammates like Clodsire, Heatran, and Garganacl compensate for Tangrowth's exploitable special bulk by checking Pokemon such as Volcarona, Tapu Lele, and Tornadus-T, respectively; in return, Tangrowth handles the likes of Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Mega Swampert. Due to its reliance on Regenerator for longevity, non-Heavy-Duty Boots variants enjoy hazard removal support from teammates such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Great Tusk, with Tornadus-T in particular forming a sturdy Regenerator core with Tangrowth.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Assault Vest Tangrowth is a solid defensive pivot that checks threats such as Iron Valiant, Mega Diancie, and Kartana thanks to its typing, Regenerator, and well-rounded bulk. Knock Off cripples common switch-ins such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Tornadus-T, and Volcarona, both impairing their longevity and increasing their susceptibility to entry hazards. Earthquake hits the likes of Heatran, Iron Moth, Kingambit and Gholdengo. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be used instead to hit Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele while threatening to cripple switch-ins like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y. Focus Blast can also be used to snipe  Kingambit, or even Rock Slide to remove unsuspecting Volcarona that try to set up on the switch—the effectiveness of both options are highly matchup dependent, however. Hidden Power Ice hits bulky Ground- and Dragon-types in Garchomp, Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Gliscor, while Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Kartana. Tera Steel is preferred to turn Tangrowth's common weaknesses into resistances, helping it sponge Ice coverage from Weavile, Baxcalibur, and Mega Swampert and Hurricane from Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Moreover, it can be used in a pinch to resist Moonblast from Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Alternatively, Tera Water turns the tide against threats such as Weavile and Heatran while maintaining Tangrowth's ability to check rain wallbreakers such as Mega Swampert. Tangrowth fits best on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its ability to check Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko. Heatran receives strong support from Tangrowth, as Tangrowth checks threats such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Garchomp and pivots into foes with super effective coverage against Heatran, such as Tapu Lele and Mega Diancie. In return, Heatran checks Weavile, Volcarona, and Tornadus-T. Toxapex and Tornadus-T both benefit from Tangrowth's ability to pivot into threats such as Tapu Koko and Rotom-W, with the former receiving the same level of support from Tangrowth as does Heatran. This trio comprises a formidable Regenerator core, with Toxapex removing Toxic Spikes and checking Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Weavile, and Tornadus-T providing valuable entry hazard removal to reinforce the longevity of the core. Tangrowth is susceptible to entry hazards, which can often put it into 2HKO range of certain attacks; therefore, it appreciates entry hazard removers like the aforementioned Tornadus-T, as well as Rotom-W. Defensive cores supported by Tangrowth can fall victim to Kyurem as a result of its lethal coverage. Volcarona and Mega Scizor are teammates that can take advantage of Kyurem with their ability to set up and reliable recovery. With Tornadus-T forcing Tangrowth out, Rotom-W and Tapu Koko make for stellar teammates with their resistance to Hurricane and ability to pivot. In return, Tangrowth forces out Gastrodon, which otherwise checks the aforementioned teammates.</p>"

Its excellent bulk lets it tank hits from and trade hits with metagame beasts like Zacian-C and Koraidon, with Protect giving Gliscor the ability to scout moves and stay healthy throughout the game.

The aforementioned Zacian-C and Koraidon can also overwhelm Gliscor after a Swords Dance, forcing it to Terastallize to not succumb to their attacks. Lastly, Gliscor's offenses are mediocre, meaning that Taunt Pokemon like Arceus formes and Koraidon can effectively shut it down, as they take very little damage from Earthquake.</li> <li>Gliscor is a good user of Spikes, as it commonly annoys most Defog and Rapid Spin Pokemon, such as Giratina-O and Great Tusk, with Toxic. Corviknight stands out as the only Pokemon that is immune to Toxic, is immune to Earthquake, and can stall out Spikes with Defog and Pressure.</li> <li>Knock Off can be used instead to cripple Pokemon like Landorus-T, Kyogre, and Ting-Lu, as well as opposing Gliscor if it doesn't use Protect before its Toxic Orb has been activated. Knock Off can also cripple Heavy-Duty Boots Pokemon like Eternatus, and it is best used with Pokemon that can lay Spikes, like Ting-Lu and Clodsire, both of which appreciate Gliscor's ability to cripple and wear down hazard removal Pokemon like Giratina-O. However, with Arceus formes everywhere in the tier, which can absorb Knock Off without losing their items, Knock Off is usually unable to cripple most Pokemon. Nonetheless, said Arceus formes still fear Toxic from Gliscor.</li> <li>Lastly, Taunt is also an option for Gliscor to deny entry hazard attempts from slower Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, opposing uninvested Gliscor, and Clodsire while also denying recovery from Arceus formes and Clodsire on the switch.</li> <li>The given spread lets Gliscor outspeed uninvested base 100 Speed Pokemon. The remaining EVs maximize bulk, allowing Gliscor to avoid the 2HKO and OHKO from Zacian-C's +1 and +3 Behemoth Blade, respectively.</li> <li>Another possible EV spread is 244 HP / 80 Def / 140 SpD / 44 Spe with a Careful nature. This makes Gliscor able to survive an unboosted Ice Beam from support Arceus formes from full, letting it use Toxic on them. This can come in handy, as support Arceus formes can be an annoyance to the teams Gliscor usually sees play in. However, this spread leaves Gliscor 2HKOed and OHKOed by a +1 and +3 Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C, respectively, and OHKOed by +2 Scale Shot from Koraidon.</li> <li>Tera Water lets Gliscor resist the Water- and Ice-type attacks that are commonly thrown at it such as Ice Beam from Arceus-Ground, Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I, and Kyogre's moves. Tera Water also allows it to resist Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade and Koraidon's Flare Blitz, which is equally important. However, Terastallizing leaves Gliscor unable to switch into Ground-type Pokemon like Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground. Furthermore, it makes Gliscor become affected by Spikes and take super effective damage from Miraidon's Electro Drift instead of being immune to it.</li> <li>Gliscor wants to activate its Toxic Orb as soon as possible in order to continuously be able to check and switch in on threats, so it is advised to quickly get it in the field and use Protect to ensure it gets poisoned. Gliscor is an annoyance for teams that have multiple physical attackers like Koraidon and Zacian-C, so its HP should be preserved in order to comfortably tank their hits. However, Gliscor should not be the only switch-in to the aforementioned Pokemon, as it can get overwhelmed fairly easily, due to them commonly running Swords Dance.</li> <li>Gliscor's Special Defense is on the lower side, with Pokemon like Calm Mind Arceus formes, Miraidon, Kyogre, and Eternatus taking advantage of this to wreak havoc with powerful attacks or, in Eternatus's case, threaten to set Toxic Spikes. Because of this, Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Water Absorb Clodsire are recommended teammates. Pokemon like Arceus-Water and Kyogre can take on the Ice-type attacks that OHKO Gliscor while also helping it not get potentially overwhelmed by Koraidon and Zacian-C.</li> </ul>"

        "Spikes": {
          "description": "<p>Gliscor is a premier Spikes user. The combination of Poison Heal and Protect allows it to outlast common entry hazard removal options such as Great Tusk and Cinderace, setting it apart from its peers. Gliscor can survive some of the strongest neutral attacks in the tier with ease, including Life Orb Darkrai's Dark Pulse, Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball, and Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave. Its immunity to status conditions helps it against more defensively oriented teams, allowing it to be unfazed by Toxic from opposing Gliscor, Galarian Slowking, and Toxapex or by Will-O-Wisp from Cinderace, Skeledirge, and Dragapult. Protect is not just useful for giving Gliscor a free turn of recovery; it is also useful for scouting the moves of Choice-locked Pokemon that are able to break it, like Kyurem and Walking Wake. Toxic is used to whittle away at the foe’s health, as the combination of Toxic and Protect allows the poison damage to worsen while Gliscor heals itself in the process. Gliscor spreads status exceptionally well because most Pokemon immune to Toxic like Clodsire, Archaludon, and Gholdengo are weak to Earthquake. Toxic is not always required though, as Knock Off can be substituted over it to remove foes' Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing teams that rely on hazard stacking to make progress. On stall teams, Poison Jab can be run instead to allow Gliscor to pressure Hatterene and Taunt Roaring Moon, which otherwise have extremely favorable matchups against stall teams. Knock Off can be slotted in over Toxic or Poison Jab on teams that either lack another Knock Off user or have a different Toxic user. A physically defensive EV spread with an Impish nature lets Gliscor check Pokemon like Great Tusk lacking Ice Spinner, Dragonite, Iron Boulder, Gouging Fire, and Roaring Moon, and the Special Defense EVs provide enough special bulk to survive Choice Specs Enamorus's Moonblast and Life Orb Deoxys-S's Psycho Boost from full. A specially defensive EV spread can be run instead to check Pokemon like Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Gholdengo, retaining enough physical bulk to live Ogerpon-W's unboosted Ivy Cudgel from full. Both sets run 244 HP EVs to maximize the amount of health Gliscor recovers from Poison Heal. Tera Water lets Gliscor flip bad matchups against Water-types like Walking Wake and Hisuian Samurott as well as Ice-types like Weavile while being a great defensive typing in general. However, this is best reserved as a last resort, since Gliscor immensely appreciates its base typing because of its Stealth Rock neutrality and Spikes immunity. Moreover, Gliscor's teammates will generally get more mileage from Tera, so using it on Gliscor is not worth it most of the time.</p> <p>Gliscor functions best on entry hazard stacking balance teams, since its role compression provides flexibility in what Pokemon and sets these structures can run; it is also excellent on stall teams due to its longevity and excellent defensive profile. Gliscor’s role as a Spikes setter and Toxic user gives its team a much easier time breaking down opposing defensive balances and pivoting cores, punishing switches and poisoning foes that decide to stay in. Gliscor works in conjunction with its offensive partners by forcing switches while also soaking up incoming attacks from powerful offensive threats, giving it and its teammates ample opportunities to force progress. With these traits, Gholdengo makes an amazing teammate for Gliscor, since after Gliscor sets up Spikes, Gholdengo blocks all removal options aside from Court Change Cinderace, which Gliscor can beat one-on-one. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate, being able to sponge hits from strong special attackers such as Kyurem, Walking Wake, Serperior, and Enamorus, many of which threaten Gliscor out. In return, Gliscor walls physical Ground-type attackers that easily dispose of Galarian Slowking, like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T. Stealth Rock users such as Ting-Lu and Clefable pair very well with Gliscor, and stacking hazards is a very effective way at making progress. Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Clefable, as well as Meowscarada and Weavile, work well with Gliscor, since they allow it to run Toxic to punish bulkier Pokemon, and they are able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon that do not come in on Gliscor so that its hazards can chip more effectively throughout the game. Late-game cleaners such as Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Kingambit all work well with Gliscor too, as they appreciate their checks having to constantly switch and get chipped by Spikes early- and mid-game, putting them into KO range late-game. Because Gliscor is so excellent on stall teams, teammates like Dondozo, Clodsire, and Blissey greatly appreciate Gliscor's ability to force progress with Spikes and Poison Jab, especially against threats to stall like Calm Mind Hatterene and Taunt Roaring Moon. In return, Dondozo can sponge powerful Ice-type attacks from Meowscarada and Weavile while keeping powerful physical attackers like Gouging Fire and Kingambit at bay, while Clodsire and Blissey can collectively wall the vast majority of special attackers and take some pressure off Gliscor as a result.</p>"

        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Gliscor can make a lot of easy progress throughout the game thanks to its great bulk, being able to use Swords Dance in front of opposing Gliscor and other passive Pokemon such as Clefable, Clodsire, and Toxapex to become an offensive threat. Gliscor being permanently affected by poison allows it to use Facade consistently, which breaks Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W, Hawlucha, and Dragonite.[B] [/B]Swords Dance Gliscor can threaten common Knock Off absorbers like Clefable, particularly on Heavy-Duty Boots spam teams, so it can effectively use Knock Off instead against these teams to punish different foes, especially entry hazard-weak Pokemon such as Volcarona, Zapdos, and Enamorus.[B] [/B]Ice Fang is another option that can be run over Knock Off to shut down opposing Gliscor, which may give the team trouble, or to have better coverage and damage against opposing Dragon-, Flying-, and Grass-types such as Dragapult, Dragonite, and Rillaboom. Tera Water flips Gliscor's matchup against Ice- and Water-types such as Weavile and Barraskewda defensively; however, it becomes a worse check to Pokemon such as Rillaboom. For teams that are not as strong defensively into Grass-types, Tera Dragon is recommended, as it covers for both Water and Grass, and most notably, it shuts down Ogerpon-W and gains a better matchup versus Serperior and other potent offensive threats that would have been able to beat Gliscor even with Tera Water. 16 Special Defense EVs allow Gliscor to survive both a Choice Specs Enamorus's Moonblast and Life Orb Deoxys-S's Psycho Boost from full health, or it can be given more special bulk to better handle common offensive threats like Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Iron Moth, which may chunk it heavily and affect its time on field otherwise. The 36 Defense EVs on the specially bulky EV spread allow Gliscor to comfortably survive Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel from full health.</p> <p>Swords Dance Gliscor best fits on teams that need to break balance structures, most prominently teams that utilize multiple Heavy-Duty Boots users. Gliscor enjoys being a part of Spikes-stacking teams that need guaranteed progress against opposing Heavy-Duty Boots spam teams, which Spikes-stacking teams usually lose to. As a result, Ting-Lu and Skarmory are great teammates, as they can set up entry hazards and directly complement Gliscor defensively. Gholdengo also pairs well, preventing Defog and hindering the removal of hazards. However, Gliscor's lack of Toxic or hazards makes it exert less pressure long-term, prevents it from placing opposing Pokemon on a timer such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, and means it cannot punish any switch-ins to it with a Toxic. Teammates such as Weaville and Choice Specs Dragapult help Gliscor's lack of pressure with great upfront damage. Swords Dance Gliscor is also unable to deal with the common Iron Defense Skarmory on balance teams or muscle through common defensive walls such as Dondozo and Corviknight; however, access to Knock Off allows it remove their items at the very least, which could be helpful in the long run for Gliscor's teammates. Teammates such as, Kyurem and Rotom-W are great with Swords Dance Gliscor, as they can beat the fatter Pokemon that Gliscor is unable to muscle through, such as the aforementioned Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight. Gholdengo and Ogerpon-W are also good options, as they are able to turn threats such as Skarmory and Dondozo into setup fodder.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its respectable bulk and fantastic passive longevity with Poison Heal, Gliscor occupies a fantastic niche on defensive teams. Its lack of use for its item slot after its activation combined with its Spikes immunity allows Gliscor to withstand weaker Knock Off attempts from Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. Gliscor can use its longevity to act as an excellent Defog user, as it can outlast common Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl. Alternatively, Gliscor can opt for Stealth Rock if its team prefers it over Defog. Roost keeps Gliscor healthy alongside Poison Heal, allowing it to drain the PP of moves such as Heatran's Magma Storm and Garganacl's Salt Cure. Toxic allows Gliscor to pressure common entry hazard setters and Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T. It also allows Gliscor to cripple offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult and Tapu Lele in a pinch. Tera Fairy gives Gliscor a generally solid defensive typing with few weaknesses, although at the cost of its Spikes immunity. The given HP EVs maximize Gliscor's recovery from Poison Heal and special bulk, with the remainder in Speed to outspeed Rotom-W. Gliscor fits best on defensive teams that appreciate its immense survivability and great support options. As such, Gliscor pairs well with sturdy physical and special walls, such as Skeledirge, Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Clodsire, since its relatively unremarkable bulk puts it at risk of being overwhelmed often. In return, it can switch into weak attacks with problematic secondary effects, such as Toxapex's Scald and Garganacl's Salt Cure, as well as help teammates keep their held items by absorbing Knock Off. Pokemon weak to entry hazards such as Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Garganacl pair well with Gliscor's Defog support, while they act as threatening late-game wincons after Gliscor has worn down their checks. Gliscor pairs exceptionally well with Toxapex, as they form an incredibly sturdy pivoting core due to their incredible passive recovery.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Gliscor is an incredibly potent wincon, using its incredible longevity and solid bulk to effortlessly setup on passive Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Toxapex, and Clefable. Facade provides Gliscor with an excellent alternative move to hit Ground-resistant and -immune Pokemon such as Skarmory, Zapdos, and Buzzwole, with its ample PP ensuring that it can outstall their recovery PP if necessary. Roost provides Gliscor with instant recovery, allowing it to check Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Heatran. The given EVs allow Gliscor to fulfill this purpose with Special Defense investment, with the HP maximizing its recovery from Poison Heal. Tera Fairy allows Gliscor to leverage a typing with few exploitable weaknesses, given Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo fear its Earthquake, while Tera Water improves Gliscor's matchup against Pokemon like Volcarona and Urshifu-R. However, it comes with more exploitable weaknesses, given the prominence of Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Ferrothorn. Gliscor fits best on balance and fat teams, which appreciate its ability to tear through opposing defensive cores while providing enough of a defensive backbone in return to facilitate this. Pokemon like Toxapex, Skarmory, and Gholdengo can exploit Gliscor's temporary checks such as Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Buzzwole, generating progress of their own. On the flip side, revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Dragapult can threaten offensive teams, given Gliscor's tendency to be overwhelmed when facing multiple strong wallbreakers. Gliscor appreciates Pursuit support from Mega Tyranitar or Kingambit, as it removes Gliscor's few true walls in Tera Ghost Rotom-W and Air Balloon Gholdengo.</p>"

U-turn is an alternative over Toxic to preserve momentum and scout switches. 16 Speed EVs can be used instead of 60 to invest more in Gliscor's special bulk while still outspeeding Modest Pelipper and Adamant Scizor, allowing Gliscor to more comfortably duel foes such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Choice Specs Iron Valiant.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p>Taunt can be used over Protect to prevent foes such as Iron Defense Zamazenta, Iron Defense Corviknight, and Sinistcha from using Gliscor as a setup opportunity, as well as allow Gliscor to act as a stallbreaker against Quagsire and Corviknight.

However, this comes with the trade-off of making Gliscor far more vulnerable to special attackers such as Choice Specs Dragapult and Flutter Mane. 148 Speed EVs can be used to allow Gliscor to fly past Dragonite and Adamant Hoopa-U and remove their Choice Bands before they can attack, but this will impinge on Gliscor's bulk.</p> </section>",

        "Entry Hazard Support (Flying)": {
          "description": "<p>Gliscor is one of the best entry hazard setters for Flying teams, owing to its ability, typing and bulk. The combination of Toxic Orb and Poison Heal gives Gliscor excellent passive recovery and immunity to status from moves like Spore from Amoonguss and Will-O-Wisp from Sableye. Furthermore, Gliscor's Ground / Flying type combination gives it an immunity to Electric-type moves like Thunderbolt from Regieleki and Sandy Shocks, which its teammates are weak to, and a neutrality against Rock-type moves like Stone Axe from Kleavor and Stone Edge from Tyranitar. Gliscor's typing combined with Special Defense investment and Poison Heal also allows it to sit on Pokemon such as non-Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Iron Moth that do not have Ice-type or strong Water-type moves. Access to Stealth Rock and Spikes allows Gliscor to wear down walls like Toxapex and Clodsire and fast threats like Greninja and Basculegion-F throughout the game, and Toxic allows it to spread status against bulkier threats like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Mandibuzz, and Ursaluna-B. Taunt pressures Defog users like Corviknight and opposing entry hazard setters like Clefable and Quagsire. Knock Off hits Air Balloon Gholdengo and removes Leftovers from Corviknight. Earthquake offers decent STAB damage against Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon, which are immune to Toxic, like Clodsire and Gholdengo and prevents foes from setting up in Gliscor's presence. Protect helps Gliscor activate its Toxic Orb against faster enemies with access to Knock Off or status-spreading moves. It also allows Gliscor to scout super effective moves like Ice Spinner from Great Tusk and Iron Treads, and diminish Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon PP by using Protect on Blood Moon turns and walling Ursaluna-B on the cooldown, and safely recover HP from Poison Heal. 60 EVs in Speed serve to outspeed Modest Volcanion and Timid Magnezone.</p> <p>Gliscor appreciates teammates like Articuno, which can use Freeze-Dry to force opposing Gliscor and Water-type Pokemon like Manaphy and Walking Wake to switch. In addition to that, Articuno can easily switch into Ice Beam from threats like Greninja and Frosmoth and other special attacks due to its naturally high Special Defense and neutrality to Ice-type attacks. In return, Articuno appreciates Gliscor's ability to threaten Steel- and Fire-types with Earthquake and block Toxic. Articuno also enjoys Gliscor's ability to absorb Knock Off and prevent the removal of Articuno's Heavy-Duty Boots. Iron Defense Corviknight is also a great teammate for Gliscor, as it serves as an answer to Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Corviknight's great physical bulk and access to Body Press allow it to comfortably switch into Icicle Crash from these Ice-type Pokemon and force them out with the threat of super effective damage. Corviknight also checks Dragon-type wallbreakers like Dragonite and Dragon Dance or Choice Band Dragapult, which Gliscor may struggle against. Articuno, Corviknight and Gliscor thus synergize well with each other and limit the opponent from sweeping through the team with Gliscor's Electric-type immunity. Gliscor also appreciates teammates like Thundurus-T and Zapdos that serve as an answer to Corviknight and threatening Water-type Pokemon like Barraskewda, Urshifu-R, and Basculegion-F, which cause problems for Gliscor. Thundurus-T and Zapdos in return appreciate Gliscor spreading Toxic and setting entry hazards, as the accumulated chip damage lets them break other Pokemon with ease. Dragonite can switch into Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Choice Band Barraskewda and Urshifu-R. In return, Dragonite appreciates Gliscor's ability to absorb status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, which can otherwise greatly hamper its wallbreaking ability. Moltres helps Gliscor spread status against various physical threats like Kingambit and Chien-Pao, with the help of Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp while also pivoting in the rest of the team safely with the help of U-turn. Gliscor supports Choice Scarf Enamorus's cleaning ability due to its hazards and status allowing Enamorus to OHKO offensive threats like Choice Specs Greninja and Choice Specs Walking Wake. Gliscor also boosts Enamorus and Galarian Moltres's wallbreaking potential by serving as an answer to their common checks like Alolan Muk, Clodsire, and Galarian Slowking, thus enabling them to sweep late-game. Gyarados pairs well with Gliscor, as it can act like a check for Urshifu-R, Baxcalibur, and Chien-Pao, owing to its type combination and Intimidate ability. Gyarados can also rack up entry hazard damage with Dragon Tail, thus working well with Gliscor's entry hazards. Landorus is also a great teammate for Gliscor, as it can run Stealth Rock to allow Gliscor to run Spikes instead and threatens physical walls such as Galarian Weezing, Kommo-o, and Great Tusk with its coverage.</p>"

        "Swords Dance (Ground)": {
          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Gliscor is an excellent bulky sweeper for Ground teams, being able to use its superb bulk, status immunity, and Poison Heal recovery to easily set up Swords Dance multiple times and quickly snowball against more passive team archetypes such as Steel, Poison, Water stall, and opposing Ground. Knock Off serves as Gliscor’s secondary attacking move to accompany Earthquake, hitting targets immune to Earthquake such as Landorus and Air Balloon Gholdengo while also removing foes’ items, cutting off foes such as Corviknight and Galarian Weezing from Leftovers or Black Sludge recovery and offensively neutering threats like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, Facade can be used as a strong neutral coverage option that smacks Enamorus, Galarian Moltres, and Galarian Weezing; however, running Facade means that Gliscor will be walled by Air Balloon Gholdengo and will be unable to remove foes' items. Protect allows Gliscor to safely use Poison Heal to recover while scouting foes’ moves, which can be especially useful against Choice item users such as Iron Moth, Dragapult, and Dragonite. Additionally, Protect is particularly valuable against Ursaluna-B, as Gliscor can void its Blood Moon and use the following turn to set up Swords Dance. The given EVs maximize Gliscor’s Poison Heal recovery, allow Gliscor to outrun Modest Pelipper and Adamant Scizor, and maximize its ability to duel special attackers such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Ursaluna-B, and Choice Specs Dragapult.</p> <p>Clodsire is an extremely useful teammate to Gliscor due to its Water immunity via Water Absorb, serving as a crucial check to foes such as Walking Wake, Urshifu-R, and Basculegion-F. Moreover, Clodsire can offer Gliscor Toxic Spikes support, which synergizes brilliantly with Gliscor’s Protect and makes Gliscor even more threatening as a sweeper. In return, Gliscor can absorb burns and Knock Off for Clodsire, deal with threats such as Landorus, Hatterene, and Iron Treads without Ice Spinner, and provide a Ground immunity to counteract Clodsire's weakness. Mamoswine complements Gliscor excellently by offering an Ice resistance to compensate for Gliscor’s weakness, and with a Choice Band it can easily take care of impediments to Gliscor such as Corviknight, Articuno, and Dragonite. In exchange, Gliscor can absorb burns from foes such as Sableye and Moltres and offer a Fighting resistance to answer foes like Iron Valiant and Sneasler. Ursaluna-B is another great pairing to Gliscor, acting as a special wallbreaker that can blast through physical walls such as Quagsire, Dondozo, and Slowbro. Furthermore, with Vacuum Wave, Ursaluna-B can act as a check to Chien-Pao, and if using Calm Mind, it can overwhelm Corviknight variants that do not use Iron Defense. Gliscor returns the favor by taking on Iron Valiant, Choice Band Zamazenta, and Assault Vest Iron Hands for Ursaluna-B. Ursaluna-B can additionally tackle Hex Dragapult and Spectrier, which are otherwise very deadly to Gliscor. Landorus is another option for a special wallbreaker that can use Gravity to ground and threaten Corviknight. As another option, Landorus can also run a Choice Scarf, threatening Ogerpon-W, Chien-Pao, and Zamazenta and providing safe entry for Gliscor with U-turn. Choice Scarf Great Tusk can revenge kill Chien-Pao and can also handle Baxcalibur, Hisuian Samurott, Hydreigon. With Ice Spinner, Great Tusk can further eliminate Dragonite and Swords Dance Garchomp and, if using Megahorn, tear through Ogerpon-W. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Iron Treads can additionally beat Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur while also OHKOing Alolan Ninetales, Flutter Mane, and Enamorus. Quagsire can serve as a defensive answer to key menaces to Gliscor such as Azumarill and Swords Dance Chien-Pao and stack entry hazards to facilitate Gliscor’s sweep. Sandy Shocks can zap Corviknight and Slowbro for Gliscor, provide Gliscor with safe entry points with Volt Switch, and layer entry hazards for Gliscor.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Mamoswine is a staple pick for Ice teams, offering many useful traits, including a Fire neutrality via its ability Thick Fat, an Electric immunity that nullifies Thunder Wave and Volt Switch, and access to Stealth Rock. Mamoswine's primary attacking move is its strong STAB Earthquake, allowing it to threaten bulky Steel-types such as Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Magnezone, which is of great importance for Ice. Mamoswine's Earthquake finds further use as Ice's best way of dealing with Iron Hands, Toxapex, and Okidogi. Ice Shard lets Mamoswine circumvent its middling Speed and pick off weakened offensive threats such as Dragapult, Dragonite, Meowscarada, and Enamorus, as well as OHKO Landorus after Stealth Rock. Smack Down gives Mamoswine the capacity to threaten Corviknight with its powerful Earthquake and force it out, making it adept at keeping Stealth Rock up against Flying teams by making it difficult for Corviknight to use Defog. Smack Down provides further utility by allowing Mamoswine to ground and threaten Zapdos, 2HKO Articuno, and crucially OHKO defensively uninvested Volcarona. As an alternative to Smack Down, Icicle Crash can be used as a broadly powerful Ice-type STAB move that allows Mamoswine to better pressure targets such as Mandibuzz, Ursaluna-B, and Amoonguss, at the cost of making the Flying matchup more difficult. The given EVs render physically defensive Corviknight's Body Press a 3HKO against Mamoswine after Leftovers recovery while maximizing attack power, making Mamoswine much more effective at threatening Corviknight. Furthermore, they allow Mamoswine to live a +1 Flamethrower from offensive Volcarona and OHKO it in return with Smack Down, as well as outpace Adamant Kingambit and Iron Hands.</p> <p>Baxcalibur forms a fantastic offensive core with Mamoswine, providing a burn immunity via Thermal Exchange and a resistance to Water to compensate for Mamoswine's weaknesses. To complement Baxcalibur, Mamoswine sets Stealth Rock and removes bulky Steel-types, such as Empoleon and Corviknight, in order to pave the way for Baxcalibur's sweeping or wallbreaking. Alolan Ninetales pairs excellently with Mamoswine, setting snow and Aurora Veil to improve Mamoswine's defenses even further and dealing with the Fighting-types that threaten Mamoswine such as Urshifu-R and Iron Valiant. In return, Mamoswine can comfortably take Heavy Slams aimed at Alolan Ninetales under snow and threaten their users, including Hisuian Goodra, Iron Hands, and Iron Treads. Froslass can set Spikes to compound the offensive pressure that Mamoswine's Stealth Rock creates while also serving as a Fighting immunity and a spinblocker. Chien-Pao appreciates Mamoswine's Stealth Rock bringing foes down to KO ranges and breaking Ceruledge's Focus Sash to enable its sweeping and wallbreaking; it supports Mamoswine in turn by threatening problematic foes such as Gholdengo and Spectrier, as well as Ogerpon-H and Ogerpon-W if using Choice Band. Frosmoth similarly benefits from Mamoswine setting Stealth Rock and breaking Steel-types such as Heatran, while it threatens physical walls such as Quagsire and Great Tusk in exchange. Alolan Sandslash can neutralize Toxic from foes such as Toxapex aimed at Mamoswine, threaten Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, and use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Amoonguss and Toxapex and open them up to being chipped by Stealth Rock. Moreover, both Alolan Sandslash and Avalugg can help prevent Mamoswine from being worn down by entry hazards by spinning them away. Cetitan and Cloyster are other sweepers on Ice to accompany Baxcalibur that benefit from the offensive pressure that Mamoswine's Stealth Rock creates. Cloyster greatly appreciates Mamoswine's Electric immunity, and Cetitan can only OHKO Corviknight at +6 after Stealth Rock.</p>"

        "Choice Band (Ground)": {
          "description": "<p>Mamoswine is a great offensive option for Ground teams thanks to its huge Attack stat, access to priority, and unique STAB combination. Mamoswine's ability, Thick Fat, also allows for it to act as an extremely valuable resistance to Ice, meaning it can switch into foes like Articuno. Icicle Crash shreds Grass-type Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Sinistcha, and Flying-type Pokemon, such as Mandibuzz and Gliscor, that would otherwise resist or be immune to Ground-type moves. Icicle Crash is extremely threatening to Flying-type teams in particular, as most Flying-type Pokemon are 2HKOed by Icicle Crash, meaning there are no safe switchins. Ice Shard is a fantastic priority move that allows Mamoswine to stand its ground against faster Pokemon such as both Landorus formes, Cyclizar, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Knock Off is a good final option to help deal with walls that may take a bit more time to whittle down, such as Dondozo and Corviknight, as well as create permanent progress against Pokemon such as Baxcalibur and Articuno, which both rely heavily on their items, whether it be offensively or defensively.</p> <p>Mamoswine greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Quagsire, as the extra damage could be the difference between a 2HKO or an opportunity for an OHKO on lots of Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Meowscarada with Ice Shard, Icicle Crash on Corviknight, and Earthquake on Toxapex and Amoonguss. Clodsire is a good teammate for Mamoswine, as it can switch in to Water- and Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Sneasler, and Walking Wake that would otherwise make quick work of Mamoswine, as well as provide Toxic and entry hazard support. Iron Treads is another good teammate for Mamoswine, as it keeps hazards off the field in order to prevent Mamoswine from being chipped down, as well as setts up hazards of its own. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Iron Treads outspeeds and hits Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, which both threaten Mamoswine, for super effective damage. Choice Scarf Great Tusk is another teammate that pairs well with Mamoswine. Great Tusk is able to outspeed and OHKO Pokemon that check Mamoswine such as Choice Specs Greninja and Cinderace. Once faster threats have been taken care of, Mamoswine will have an easy time breaking the opposing team with its extremely powerful attacks. Ursaluna-B is a great teammate for Mamoswine, as it can absorb status conditions from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Sableye, as well as threatening them back with its extremely powerful Blood Moon. Ursaluna-B is also capable of using Vacuum wave to snipe Chien-Pao. Gliscor can also absorb status moves, as well as absorbing status moves and Fighting-type attacks that Mamoswine does not want to deal with. Gliscor is also able to support Mamoswine with Spikes and Toxic. Landorus forms a potent offensive core with Mamoswine, destroying Physical walls such as Quagsire and Slowbro, while Mamoswine deals with special walls such as Gliscor and Gastrodon. Additionally, Landorus can set Gravity for Mamoswine so that it can freely spam Earthquake. Lastly, Sandy Shocks is capable of dealing with Pokemon such as Pelipper and Corviknight, as well as providing hazard and Gravity support. Mamoswine easily takes care of the Ground-types that would wall Sandy Shocks.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Gallade is the premier Choice Scarf user on Psychic teams due to its great coverage options and incredible ability, Sharpness. Being able to fire off Sharpness-boosted Sacred Sword is incredibly valuable, as it hits the Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that give Psychic teams trouble for super effective damage, such as Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Hisuian Goodra. Knock Off is a great way to make progress against bulkier teams, as well as dissuade Ghost-type Pokemon from switching in on a potential Sacred Sword. Night Slash is also an option to deal more consistent damage to Skeledirge and Gholdengo. Leaf Blade is used to threaten bulky Water-type Pokemon like Quagsire and Rotom-W, as well as OHKO Belly Drum Azumarill. Aqua Cutter is an option over Leaf Blade to hit Pokemon like Landorus, Volcarona and Moltres for super effective damage, but Leaf Blade is often better due to the amount of targets it hits. A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant, as it allows Gallade to outspeed and still OHKO Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Sneasler, while the extra attack from Adamant is not necessary as most of the moves Gallade uses receive a Sharpness boost.</p> <p>Espathra is a nice compliment to Gallade, as it appreciates Gallade's ability to deal with Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon like Gholdengo, Hisuian Goodra, Kingambit, and Ting-Lu, which Espathra has little way of hitting for even neutral damage, as well as its ability to remove special walls such as Galarian Slowking and Alolan Muk. Hoopa-U is also a great teammate for Gallade, as the speed of Gallade and sheer power of Hoopa-U synergize nicely to deal with both bulky and fast teams. Hoopa-U is able to threaten an OHKO on defensive staples such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Rotom-W with entry hazard support, while Gallade outspeeds Pokemon that would otherwise shut Hoopa-U down, such as Sneasler and Greninja. Armarouge is a strong partner for Gallade, as it provides a nice resistance to Fairy-type attacks and complementary coverage to Gallade's. Armarouge appreciates the removal of special walls such as Hisuian Goodra and Galarian Slowking, allowing it to set up and apply pressure to the opposing team, and it returns the favor by taking out physically bulky foes such as Dondozo, Zamazenta, and Corviknight. Hatterene is Psychic teams' best form of hazard control, which Gallade appreciates as it tends to switch in frequently and can otherwise get chipped. Hatterene also lures in Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon like Iron Treads and Sneasler, which Gallade can take care of. Indeedee is another good teammate for Gallade, as it sets up Psychic Terrain, further strengthening Gallade's Psycho Cut and protecting it from priority moves like Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch. Indeedee also provides a valuable Ghost immunity, which prevents foes like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo from freely spamming Shadow Ball. Scream Tail is a great defensive teammate for Gallade, as its incredible bulk allows it to switch in to common Choice Scarf users such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Meowscarada, which would otherwise outspeed and OHKO Gallade. Scream Tail's access to a myriad of utility moves, such as Thunder Wave and Wish, allows it to support Gallade nicely by slowing down the aforementioned threats and increasing its longevity. Mew is a good teammate for Gallade on more offense-oriented teams, as lead Mew is the premier hazard setter for Psychic teams, and Gallade greatly appreciates the support. Galarian Slowking is a great teammate for Gallade as well, as it is able to safely switch into special attacks, as well as Fairy-type attacks that would otherwise give Gallade trouble. Galarian Slowking can also utilize Chilly Reception to give Gallade a free switch in.</p>"

Sharpness-boosted Sacred Sword does massive damage, putting pressure on opponents from turn one, as well as checking several problematic matchups, such as Dondozo. Wide Guard removes the most common way to bypass Indeedee-F's Follow Me, spread moves, and presents mind games on opponents on whether Gallade will use Wide Guard or set up Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gallade's typing is amazing offensively, but defensively leaves much to be desired. Its Defense and HP are low, making it vulnerable to attackers like Rillaboom and Urshifu that can take one attack from Gallade while OHKOing it back.

Zen Headbutt beautifully complements a Fighting-type STAB move, as it lets Mega Gallade easily break through any opposing Poison-types that may be annoying walls such as Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Clodsire. Knock Off is another tool in Mega Gallade's arsenal, which lets it take care of Psychic- and Ghost-types—such as Gholdengo, Slowbro, and Aegislash—and wears down Celesteela into range of Close Combat finishing it off.

Shadow Sneak can also be considered to pick off faster weakened threats such as Gengar, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Mega Alakazam.

Knock Off is crucial to hit opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Slowbro and Gholdengo that would otherwise wall this set, and its item removal is always handy in breaking defensive teams reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots down with Stealth Rock damage and removing key items from Celesteela and Toxapex. Finally, Zen Headbutt does massive work against Poison teams after a single Swords Dance and deals high amounts of damage to Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Buzzwole and Toxapex. Triple Axel is another alternative, allowing Mega Gallade to hit Flying- and Dragon-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Shadow Sneak can allow Mega Gallade to outspeed and take out Ghost-types such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Choice Scarf Blacephalon that could otherwise beat it. Tapu Lele forms a wallbreaking core with Mega Gallade, as they both threaten common checks to each other. Tapu Lele beats Mega Sableye with Moonblast, while Mega Gallade crushes Steel-types such as Heatran and Celesteela that trouble Tapu Lele with Close Combat. Jirachi can take Fairy-type attacks such as Tapu Lele's Moonblast aimed for Mega Gallade, as well as paralyze threats and beat them down with Thunder Wave and Serene Grace-boosted Iron Head, letting Mega Gallade break through them with a timely paralysis. Finally, Jirachi provides Stealth Rock support and a safe pivot in with U-turn. Victini provides speed control with Choice Scarf and defeats Steel-types such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo that Mega Gallade is forced out by while appreciating Mega Gallade's ability to pound Heatran to dust. Deoxys-S provides entry hazard and dual screens support, which Mega Gallade can take advantage of with Knock Off and Swords Dance to break through bulkier teams. Slowbro provides crucial momentum with Teleport while also being able to annoy teams with Scald burns and Future Sight and switch in repeatedly through Regenerator. Celebi can break through troubling physical walls such as Hippowdon and Dondozo that Mega Gallade struggles to make progress against. Finally, Choice Scarf Latias can both remove entry hazards with Defog and use Healing Wish to give Mega Gallade a second chance to break through the opposing team.</p>"

Taunt prevents hazards and status from foes such as Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, and is also used to deny Defog from Corviknight or Talonflame. However, it must be careful as most Corviknight and Talonflame can simply attack Froslass for super effective damage. When paired with Focus Sash, Taunt increases the chances of Froslass taking an opponent down with Destiny Bond, but it can also be used in tandem with Mental Herb to punish opponents like Sableye, Grimmsnarl, and opposing Froslass that attempt to Taunt Froslass, Taunting them in return. Spikes serves to punish switches on the opponent's side and weaken their team, allowing for Froslass's teammates to clean late-game. Shadow Ball is Froslass's answer to Hatterene, 2HKOing it as it comes in to bounce Spikes back, and it's Froslass's main source of damage to prevent it from being too passive. Froslass's last moveslot can utilize Destiny Bond to take an opponent down with it, but Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are also options to consider as they allow you to status Pokemon that like to play around Destiny Bond, such as Kingambit and Volcarona. Focus Sash is the preferred item as it ensures that Froslass will always get at least one layer of Spikes up, but Mental Herb can also be used to ignore Taunt from faster leads while Heavy Duty-Boots allows Froslass to safely switch back in to block spinners such as Cyclizar and Quaquaval.</p> <p>All of Froslass's teammates appreciate it spreading Spikes on the opposing field and preventing hazards from going up on theirs. After Spikes, Choice Band Chien Pao 2HKOes Iron Hands, while Shell Smash Cloyster and Belly Drum Cetitan can attempt to set up and sweep without fear of getting stopped by an opposing Focus Sash. Baxcalibur benefits from Froslass paralyzing faster threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, enabling it to outspeed and take them out, though Froslass needs an intact Focus Sash for this. Similarily, Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Iron Defense Avalugg also benefit from the opportunities to set up against foes that have been burned by Froslass and no longer pose much of a threat to it. Avalugg can also support Froslass by switching into strong physical attacks to scout. Abomasnow's Snow Warning increases Froslass's physical bulk and makes it less wary of other attacks coming from spinners, such as Great Tusk's Knock Off.</p>"

Protect racks up Leftovers recovery and burn damage while scouting moves from Choice item users such as Zoroark, Bruxish, and Passimian. Tera Electric powers up Volt Switch and removes Rotom's weaknesses to Dark and Ghost, improving its matchup against Mabosstiff, Umbreon, Haunter, and opposing Rotom. Tera Steel gives Rotom a great defensive typing with Levitate, which allows it to shrug off Sandaconda's Ground- and Rock-type coverage as well as take resisted damage from common moves like Lurantis's Leaf Storm and Lycanroc's Stone Edge. Because of Rotom's vulnerability to chip damage, it benefits greatly from reliable entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Scyther and Lurantis. Powerful wallbreakers such as Ursaring and Medicham appreciate Rotom pivoting them safely into play. Rotom is quite vulnerable to faster attackers such as Zoroark and Bruxish, so it appreciates being paired with defensive stops to these threats, such as Muk and Umbreon. Passimian is a fantastic partner that forms a VoltTurn core with Rotom and revenge kills its offensive checks; it also appreciates Rotom weakening Sandaconda.</p>"

This way, it can't be confused by any Berries given with Trick.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Discharge</strong>: While weaker than Thunderbolt, the 30% paralysis chance can be devastating for some of Rotom-H's more troublesome matchups, such as Chi-Yu. Do note though that Choice Scarf Rotom-H will have a much harder time 2HKOing Assault Vest Azumarill and certain variants of Dondozo.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: If not running Tera Blast, Rotom-H normally wants to keep its unique typing for defensive purposes, allowing it to switch into several key threats.

Thunder Wave is still a reasonable choice, though, stopping special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Iron Moth in their tracks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick and Flame Orb</strong>: This one-use method of burning may seem silly, but taking away important items can be devastating against certain Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, and Rotom-H can use this to get rid of troublesome Choice items if it's taken a Trick as well. Note that Rotom-H will burn itself if it Terastallizes while holding Flame Orb, which is generally not good outside of blocking sleep or Toxic poison.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using a Neutral Nature with a Bold Mint</strong>: If using Trick, it's best to run a neutral nature such as Serious and change the stat boosts with a Bold Mint. This way, Rotom-H won't get confused by any Berry it receives.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Rotom-H's defensive typing is very valuable, so Tera is normally reserved for very specific situations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel with Levitate is a sublime defensive typing, letting Rotom-H better handle huge threats like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is an alternative option to soak up Dragon-type attacks, and it also gives Rotom-H a better matchup against Great Tusk and Iron Hands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While this unfortunately makes Gholdengo a much bigger issue, Tera Ghost is still worth considering for making Rotom-H immune to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Iron Valiant's Close Combat. It also lets Rotom-H switch out of trapping moves without using Volt Switch.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry is Rotom-H's ticket to staying around the longest, usually avoiding 2HKOs from powerful unboosted attacks such as Dragonite's Outrage and Iron Valiant's Close Combat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rotom-H's typing makes it a good user of Rocky Helmet, passively punishing physical Fairy-types such as Mimikyu and Iron Valiant and making it a good response to expected uses of U-turn.</p> </li> </ul>"

Will-O-Wisp is an excellent move for significantly weakening physical threats such as Barraskewda, Chien-Pao, Great Tusk, and Kingambit. Hydro Pump threatens Ground-type Pokemon that Electric teams would otherwise struggle against, such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Mamoswine. Volt Switch allows Rotom-W's more threatening wallbreaking teammates to come in more easily. Foul Play enables Rotom-W to hit Baxcalibur, which cannot be burned, Dragonite, and physically oriented Dragapult. It also prevents Rotom-W from becoming setup fodder. Protect is a solid option to give Rotom-W an extra turn to recover some HP, inflict more burn damage on foes, and potentially scout what set the opponent may be running, which is especially valuable versus Choice-locked enemies such as Chien-Pao and Meowscarada. The given EV spread maximizes Rotom-W's physical bulk while also allowing it to outspeed and burn Jolly Azumarill.</p> <p>Assault Vest Magnezone forms a nice defensive core with Rotom-W, where Magnezone is able to act as a special wall, while Rotom-W is able to act as a physical wall, as well as switch in on Ground-type attacks that would otherwise make quick work of Magnezone. Magnezone can also switch into attacks from Pokemon like Hatterene, Gholdengo, and Flutter Mane and Toxic from the likes of Amoonguss, Mandibuzz, and Toxapex, as well as forming a nice Volt Switch pivot core. Iron Hands is another great teammate for Rotom-W. Not only is Iron Hands able to come in for free after a Volt Switch from Rotom-W, but Rotom-W is also able to burn opposing Pokemon to bolster Iron Hands's Longevity. Iron Hands is also capable of taking care of Meowscarada, Hisuian Goodra, and Ogerpon-W. Defensive Zapdos is able to make quick work of pesky Grass-type Pokemon that stop Rotom-W in its tracks, such as Ogerpon-H, Ogerpon-W, Amoonguss, and Sinistcha. Sandy Shocks is the best entry hazard setter for Electric teams, and it pairs nicely with Rotom-W, which can force uncomfortable switches thanks to the looming threat of Will-O-Wisp. The revolving door of Volt Switches can force a lot of damage on opposing teams, thus making games easier to close out. Thundurus-T's array of coverage makes it a great teammate for Rotom-W. Thundurus-T can use Grass Knot to deal with Pokemon such as Quagsire and Gastrodon, as well as Psychic to deal with Pokemon like Amoonguss and Clodsire. Pawmot can use Seed Bomb to threaten Quagsire, Gastrodon, and opposing Rotom-W while also hitting Hydreigon, Baxcalibur and Ursaluna-B with STAB Close Combat. Regieleki can use its blistering Speed tier to take care of Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, while also using Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock to keep Rotom-W alive for a longer period of time.</p>"

In return, Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks deals with fast threats such as Choice Specs Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Scovillain, while Iron Hands pressures matchups such as Dark and Dragon due to its sheer bulk and coverage in Ice Punch. Pawmot can revive Rotom-W with Revival Blessing, which allows it to take more risks. Additionally, Pawmot has good coverage moves in Seed Bomb and Ice Punch, which lets it break down types such as Water, Flying, and Ground alongside Rotom-W. Choice Specs Kilowattrel deals with fast threats such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Choice Specs Greninja, and Volcarona, removes Grass-types like Amoonguss and Breloom, and pivots Rotom-W in with Volt Switch or U-turn.

Alternatively, Apple Acid breaks down defensive Pokemon such as Garganacl, while Haze neutralizes slow setup sweepers such as Scizor and Freeze-Dry hits Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp super effectively.

Its Ground immunity and Water-type resistance make Pokemon like Mega Swampert unable to bother it; it also has access to Hydro Pump to hit annoying Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Hippowdon. Rotom-W is also a really good blanket check to Ice- and Fire-types like Mamoswine, Victini, and Galarian Darmanitan. Volt Switch provides great momentum, which is needed in hyper offense teams. In addition to providing momentum, Rotom-W has access to Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, crippling foes such as Mega Garchomp and Mimikyu with Will-O-Wisp, while Toxic punishes switch-ins such as Gastrodon and Kyurem. Defog lets Rotom-W compress roles, freeing up Zapdos to run Choice Specs, while Rotom-W prevents hazards from hurting teammates. Pain Split is another option, as it massively improves Rotom-W's longevity; however, this requires Zapdos to run Defog. The 44 invested Speed EVs ensure Rotom-W outspeeds Jolly Azumarill so that it can punish Azumarill for setting up Belly Drum with Will-O-Wisp or Volt Switch. Zapdos covers Rotom-W's weakness to Grass-types with access to Hurricane and Heat Wave, being able to OHKO the likes of Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, respectively, while also being immune to Mold Breaker Excadrill's Earthquake. Regieleki can be used as a Rapid Spinner, removing pressure from Rotom-W to function as the only hazard removal while also luring in Ground-types that Rotom-W can punish such as Iron Treads or Great Tusk. With access to Taunt and having an amazing Speed tier, Zeraora can prevent hazards from coming up and allow Rotom-W to switch in freely and get off a strong Hydro Pump or gain a lot of momentum and Volt Switch into one of its offensive teammates. Zeraora also pressures Hydreigon and Gholdengo, which can use Rotom-W as setup fodder. Iron Hands provides the coverage and bulk against Pokemon like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Volcarona, and SubRoost Kyurem that Rotom-W can't deal with while also putting a lot of pressure on Normal teams, as Rotom-W can Volt Switch against Blissey into Iron Hands and force Blissey to tank a hit or switch out. Alolan Raichu gives Rotom-W's slow Volt Switch a lot of value as it is strong but frail, being able to deal with Ice-types like Baxcalibut with Focus Blast and Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Clodsire with Psyshock. Magnezone provides a valuable Poison immunity while also checking other threats like Tapu Lele, Meowscarada, and Alolan Ninetales.</p>"

Discharge has a chance to paralyze and cripple bulky switch-ins like Serperior, Tapu Lele, and Dragonite. Substitute keeps Rotom-W safe from status moves like Toxic and generates free turns for it to set up, turning many common utility Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Alomomola, and Heatran into Rotom-W's setup fodder. Volt Switch and Will-O-Wisp can be used as an alternative combination, the former helping Rotom-W keep up the momentum and the latter helping to cripple threats such as Dragonite and Garchomp. However, this combination is less effective for wallbreaking because it makes Rotom-W vulnerable to status moves and forces it to switch out if it needs to use its Electric-type STAB move, losing the boost from Nasty Plot. Tera Ghost combined with Levitate counters several popular Ground-type threats like Ursaluna, Sword Dance Gliscor, and Great Tusk, while Tera Steel and Tera Poison complement Levitate well and let Rotom-W effectively wall utility variants of Gliscor, the former improving its matchup into Tapu Lele and the latter granting it a resistance to common Fighting-type attacks from Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Urshifu-R. 44 Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T so it can set up Substitute first and dodge Toxic, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into bulk so it can check the aforementioned physical threats better. With most Rotom-W sets being pure utility, this set can often come across as a surprise to the would-be bulky checks to it such as Clefable, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking, and it can also disrupt the opponent's pace by setting up Substitute and boost with Nasty Plot. However, both of its STAB moves are resisted by Grass-types and Dragon-types, which means it loses to the likes of Ferrothorn and Raging Bolt even after boosting. Serperior and Kyurem especially prey on this set because they both can use it as setup fodder.</p>"

Trick neutralizes setup threats such as Iron Defense Garganacl as well as walls such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn, greatly assisting offensive cores in breaking through. Thunder Wave cripples offensive threats such as Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, making them much easier to revenge kill and neutering the impact they have for the remainder of the game. Slower offensive Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Ogerpon-W enjoy being able to outspeed and threaten said threats that would previously be an issue. However, Will-O-Wisp is another great alternative, stopping foes such as Mega Lopunny and Urshifu-R from freely breaking through teams while helping their checks such as Toxapex and Alomomola stay healthier and ease the burden of checking them continuously throughout the game. Finally, Pain Split can be used, keeping Rotom-W healthy versus bulkier teams and being a huge thorn on walls after using Trick. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Tornadus-T are also useful teammates for it, preventing Rotom-W from taking Stealth Rock chip and preserving its longevity. The given EV spread and a Timid nature maximizes its bulk and Speed, helping it be as bulky and fast as possible as effectively as possible.

Healing Wish can be used instead to help bring a teammate that has longevity issues back to full or give a setup sweeper another chance like Assault Vest Eelektross, Tauros, or Bruxish. Tera Fairy helps Mesprit revenge kill Toxicroak and Cacturne more safely, as it then resists Sucker Punch. Also, STAB Dazzling Gleam lets Mesprit muscle past Dark-types far more consistently.</p> <p>Hisuian Qwilfish is the best Mesprit answer in the tier, so Pokemon like Bruxish, Froslass, and Appletun that can draw it in and force meaningful damage onto it are important teammates to have. Choice Scarf Mesprit pairs nicely with Choice Band wallbreakers like Hisuian Sneasel and Medicham because, with U-turn, Mesprit can pivot them in versus special walls and Dark-types. All of Mesprit's checks heavily rely on their items, like Blissey, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Eelektross, so Knock Off from teammates such as Samurott, Bombirdier, and Sableye especially helps it to clean late-game. Healing Wish pairs well with Life Orb Samurott, Tauros, and Choice Band Bruxish, as they tend to have poor longevity—a second chance for a setup sweepers like Eelektross and Swords Dance Hisuian Sneasel is also highly appreciated.</p>"

U-turn allows Azelf to generate momentum for its team while also providing solid damage into Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Chien-Pao as well as pivoting on RegenVest users like Swampert and Hisuian Goodra. The final two moveslots are very flexible. Knock Off debilitates switch-ins like Swampert, Manaphy, and Hisiuan Goodra. Dazzling Gleam threatens to OHKO offensive Roaring Moon and does good damage to Mandibuzz and Chien-Pao, while Flamethrower allows Azelf to still hit the latter while having coverage into Corviknight and non-Well-Baked Body Gholdengo. Trick can punish switch-ins like Hisuian Goodra and Manaphy while also debilitating other walls like Deoxys-D, but it makes Azelf a less reliable form of Speed control. Defensive pivots like Corviknight and Swampert give Azelf a Pokemon to fall back on and a slow pivot to get it in safely, while offensive pivots like Barraskewda and Roaring Moon appreciate Azelf setting up Psychic Terrain to get rid of their weakness to priority moves. Depending on its coverage, Azelf can struggle breaking through Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra and Mandibuzz as well as bulky special walls like Swampert and the rare Blissey, so wallbreakers like Great Tusk and Galarian Zapdos make excellent partners, as they can deal with these Pokemon, and the former also removes entry hazards Azelf can struggle against. Other offensive Pokemon that are weak to priority moves like Ogerpon-W, Roaring Moon, and Chien-Pao also make excellent partners with Azelf due to the Psychic Terrain it sets up.</p>"

Teleport is used to underspeed opposing slow pivots like RegenVest Mega Steelix, Primal Kyogre, and Celesteela, allowing Dialga-O to bring in teammates largely without fear of utility moves like Knock Off and Mortal Spin. Fur Coat allows Dialga-O to switch in on more attackers, notably allowing it to wall Kartana, while Magic Guard makes it more effective into slower teams reliant on passive damage from entry hazards and moves like Salt Cure to gain the advantage. Adamant Crystal can't be removed with Knock Off and provides a useful damage increase, while Covert Cloak allows Fur Coat sets to navigate Salt Cure. Dialga-O's best fit is on balance teams with dangerous attackers that need as many attacking windows as possible to make progress, such as Choice Band users like Kartana. Outside of Kartana, Dialga-O has a pretty poor matchup into common physical attackers like Mega Mewtwo X and Kyurem-B, so it needs extra support from an ally like Imposter Chansey or a second Fur Coat user like Arceus-Ghost, Arceus-Poison, or Arceus-Fairy to help out. An offensive teammate like Steely Spirit Kartana enjoys the presence of Doom Desire to pick up instant KOes on targets like Fur Coat Arceus-Poison. Imposter-proof Dialga-O with something that can deny Strength Sap healing, like Chansey or a Magic Bounce user; these can also opt to use Teleport themselves to underspeed the Imposter user and gain the switch advantage against them.</p>"

Earth Power is a perfectly accurate, albeit slightly weaker, alternative to its STAB moves against foes like Dialga and Solgaleo. Substitute helps Palkia-O take advantage of switches it forces and eases prediction against Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Thunder Wave ruins Arceus formes Palkia-O Speed ties with and faster attackers like Mewtwo and Zacian.

However, it does give Palkia-O a Stealth Rock weakness. Tera Fairy lets Palkia-O take Dragon-type moves with no fear while also improving its matchup against Fairy-types. Tera Ground should generally be used with Earth Power to 2HKO Dialga and Solgaleo, OHKO Kingambit, and OHKO Magearna with Spikes support; it also helps Palkia-O beat opposing Dragon-types and Magearna, gives it a resistance to Stealth Rock, and gives it an immunity to Thunder Wave. Palkia-O best fits on offense and balance teams looking for a potent wallbreaker, paring nicely with sweepers like Zacian and Kingambit. Palkia-O appreciates Steel-type pivots such as Solgaleo, Magearna, and Corviknight, which switch into the foes that beat it such as Zacian and maintain momentum. Solgaleo has the added benefit of checking many other foes that outspeed Palkia-O, like Mewtwo, while Magearna can set up Spikes to help Palkia-O put foes like Kingambit and opposing Magearna into its KO range. Corviknight and other forms of entry hazard control such as Great Tusk and Mandibuzz are helpful at keeping Palkia-O healthy given its vulnerability to hazards, especially if it's running Tera Fire.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Specially defensive Heatran is an invaluable part of any Steel team. It is a fantastic check to many metagame staples that Steel would greatly struggle to otherwise deal with, such as Volcarona, Corviknight, Skeledirge, Zapdos, and Iron Moth. It serves Steel teams consistently well even outside of these problem matchups due to its great natural bulk, plethora of useful resistances including a crucial immunity to Fire via Flash Fire, and utility for its team through its access to Stealth Rock and capacity to spread burns.</p> <p>Lava Plume is Heatran’s primary attacking move, which not only hits neutral targets hard due to Heatran’s naturally good Special Attack but also has a 30% chance to burn foes. Fire’s nature as an attacking type that has no natural immunities means Heatran can use Lava Plume many times throughout the course of a game to generate progress with minimal risk. The burn chance of Lava Plume makes Heatran incredibly risky for foes to switch into, as physical attackers such as Great Tusk that could threaten a KO on Heatran do not want to risk the possibility of being burned and having their offensive power crippled. Furthermore, walls such as Toxapex also fear being burned, as the passive damage will affect their longevity over the course of a game. Earth Power is the only coverage necessary for Heatran, giving it the capability to easily break through foes such as Skeledirge and Iron Moth. It is notable that an EV spread including 56 Special Attack EVs will allow Heatran to OHKO offensive opposing Heatran with Earth Power. Heatran serves as an excellent setter of Stealth Rock due to its propensity to easily force switches against Pokemon such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Amoonguss. Protect rounds out Heatran’s moveset, not only giving it the chance to extend its longevity via Leftovers and accumulate burn damage on foes but also the capability to scout foes’ movesets, which can be especially useful when facing off against foes using Choice items. One should be careful when using Protect not to fall into predictable patterns and give foes the chance to set up on Heatran, however. Magma Storm can be used instead of Lava Plume to trap and eliminate foes such as Toxapex and force damage against bulky threats such as Iron Hands; the passive damage synergizes well with Protect, but Magma Storm's low PP and accuracy makes it less consistent throughout longer games. Taunt is an option that can be used place of Stealth Rock that synergizes particularly well with Magma Storm, preventing foes from using recovery moves, getting entry hazards up, or setting up on Heatran. However, a lack of Speed investment means it will have somewhat limited utility. As another option to Stealth Rock, Power Gem easily OHKOes Moltres, which walls Heatran otherwise, and prevents bulky Volcarona sets from outlasting Heatran. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp can be used over Stealth Rock in conjunction with an investment of 40 Speed EVs to allow Heatran to outspeed and burn maximum Speed Adamant Kingambit. If desired, it is also possible to run one of the aforementioned alternative options of Taunt, Power Gem, or Will-O-Wisp instead of Protect, but this comes at the cost of significantly impacting Heatran's longevity and foregoing Protect's scouting utility.</p> <p>Heatran serves as one of the three pillars of Steel’s “immunity trinity” along with Corviknight and Gholdengo; combined, these three offer immunities to Steel’s core weaknesses of Fire, Ground, and Fighting, forming an excellent defensive backbone for any Steel team. Corviknight is Heatran’s most important partner, being able to nullify Ground moves targeted at Heatran while Heatran in turn blocks Fire moves aimed at Corviknight. Furthermore, Corviknight can also threaten prominent Fighting-types in the metagame such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler with its STAB Brave Bird. With a physically defensive pivot set, Corviknight further synergizes with specially defensive Heatran by being able to soak up physical hits while Heatran takes special ones, having the ability to remove opposing Stealth Rock and Spikes to prevent Heatran from being worn down by entry hazards over the course of a game and providing Heatran with opportunities to switch in safely via U-turn. Bulk Up Corviknight appreciates Heatran too, as Stealth Rock and burn support can increase its sweeping potential. Gholdengo completes the immunity trinity by voiding Fighting moves aimed at Heatran. Gholdengo can further support Heatran by blocking Corrosion Toxic from Glimmora thanks to Good as Gold; this ability combined with Gholdengo's Ghost typing also lets it completely prevent the removal of Heatran's Stealth Rock, as Gholdengo blocks both Rapid Spin and Defog. With an Air Balloon, Gholdengo can block Ground-type moves and use Nasty Plot to break through walls, both of which Heatran appreciates. Alternatively, using a Choice Scarf, Gholdengo can switch into Enamorus and outspeed and OHKO it in return, and it can use Trick to cripple opposing special walls such as Toxapex and Blissey or lock sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite into setup moves to prevent them from exploiting Heatran. Outside of the immunity trinity, Hisuian Goodra also makes a good pairing with Heatran due to its unique Water resistance on Steel and capacity to threaten opposing Water-types such as Basculegion-F and Greninja with Thunderbolt. Hisuian Goodra can also check Hydreigon and Walking Wake, which both wall and exploit Heatran. Moreover, Hisuian Goodra can act as a switch-in to opposing Heatran and threaten it with Earthquake, and it is able to survive an Earth Power from Landorus and OHKO it in return with Ice Beam if necessary. Iron Treads can spin away hazards for Heatran without removing Heatran’s Stealth Rock, set Stealth Rock itself to free Heatran to use other moves if desired, and serve as an offensive check to Sandy Shocks with its STAB Earthquake as well as Landorus with Ice Spinner, which Heatran’s other teammates can struggle to handle. Physical sweepers such as Kingambit and Scizor are grateful for Heatran’s ability to absorb Will-O-Wisp for them, and they can clean up teams Heatran has worn down with Stealth Rock and chip damage. Klefki can complement Heatran's Stealth Rock with its own Spikes while taking advantage of Heatran's Fire immunity, which can help break down opposing teams faster as they switch around to deal with the immunity trinity. It should be noted that this is by no means an exhaustive list of potential teammates for Heatran; all Steel-type Pokemon in the metagame appreciate Heatran’s Fire immunity, and no Pokemon currently competes with Heatran in this regard.</p>"

Magma Storm allows Heatran to trap and KO passive foes such as Toxapex, Blissey, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, although it must Terastallize to take care of the latter two. Taunt allows it to effectively shut down trapped foes, denying recovery and preventing Toxic after Terastallizing, thus making its trapping capabilities more pronounced. Earth Power allows Heatran to hit Garganacl, Toxapex, and opposing Heatran, and it is a generally safe and accurate option against most trapped foes. Stealth Rock allows Heatran to lay entry hazards, especially in front of a trapped foe or after forcing out a foe, while Toxic is useful for wearing down switch-ins to Heatran such as Mega Gyarados. Tera Grass allows Heatran to shed its weaknesses and gain a unique defensive profile, walling most Pokemon that rely on Ground-type moves to hit it including Mega Charizard Y, Gliscor, and Clodsire. However, Heatran must still be wary when using its Tera, as it becomes more vulnerable to foes like Zapdos and Mega Scizor. Even without Special Attack investment, Heatran still poses a threat to opposing Fire-resistant foes such as Rotom-W and Garchomp, as they cannot switch in too many times without getting worn down. Allies like Volcarona appreciate Heatran pressuring foes like Toxapex and opposing Heatran for them. Heatran's ability to check Tapu Lele is also very useful for allies like Urshifu-R and Iron Valiant, as Tapu Lele is a commonly seen Choice item user, and Heatran's scouting allows teammates to safely double switch in once Heatran forces out Tapu Lele. Defensively, Heatran appreciates allies that can take Ground-type moves for it, reducing its need to Terastallize and thus saving it for a more deserving ally. Partners like Rotom-W, Mega Latias, and Gliscor are all immune to Ground-type moves from the likes of Garchomp and Landorus-T, and the former two can also switch into Water-type moves from foes like Urshifu-R while the latter two switch into Fighting-type moves from foes like Mega Lopunny. In exchange, Heatran covers Grass- and Ice-type moves for them. Heatran also has little means to heal off chip damage due to its lack of instant recovery. Thus, entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T make for good allies. Finally, Alomomola's Wish support is particularly valuable, as it can instantly heal Heatran while remaining healthy itself, and they also cover each other's weaknesses decently well, with Heatran taking Grass-type moves from Mega Charizard Y while Alomomola takes Water-type moves from Hisuian Samurott.</p>"

Heatran's natural bulk also means it can still reliably switch into resisted hits with ease despite not having defensive investment. Magma Storm + Taunt in conjunction with Earth Power allows Heatran to trap and remove foes effectively due to its spike in damage output from its Special Attack investment. Toxic is useful, as it allows Heatran to spread poison on switch-ins like Landorus-T and Alomomola that have pivoting moves to escape Magma Storm, hindering their effectiveness and putting a timer on their HP. Hidden Power Ice is an option to lure Gliscor and Garchomp and remove them for allies, as well as improving Heatran’s matchup against opposing Tera Grass Heatran. Solar Beam in conjunction with Grassium Z allows Heatran to lure and nuke Alomomola, Mega Tyranitar, and Garganacl, OHKOing the former and heavily denting the latter two. Leftovers is useful for recovery, as Heatran has no means of instant recovery; Air Balloon allows it to check opposing Heatran along with foes like Gliscor and Garchomp, threatening massive chip damage or Toxic on them. Tera Grass is useful to check Ground-type move users and also to function as a pest to rain teams in general. Offensive Heatran appreciates pivots like Rotom-W and Landorus-T that can safely bring it in while baiting in Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Corviknight. It also appreciates allies that can switch into Ground- and Fighting-type moves for it, like Tornadus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos, as they also share checks with Heatran, namely opposing Heatran, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, and appreciate Heatran chipping or outright removing these checks for them while being useful defensively as well.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Assault Vest Heatran uses its unique typing and defensive stats to match up well against common special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo and threaten them back with its great offensive stats and wide coverage. While Heatran boasts an innately good defensive typing, Tera Grass allows it to turn its common weaknesses to Ground and Water into resistances, letting it match up better against the likes of Landorus-T and Palafin-H. Heat Wave is a spread STAB attack that chips away at foes, notably 2HKOing Amoonguss. Flash Cannon is Heatran's best way of hitting Fairy-types, as it OHKOes Diancie and 2HKOes Flutter Mane. Heavy Slam OHKOes Flutter Mane but is generally less reliable because it can be weakened by Intimidate and does less damage to Diancie and opposing Tera Grass Heatran mirror. Tera Blast hits Water- and Ground-types super effectively once Heatran has Terastallized, notably OHKOing Great Tusk and 2HKOing Bulk Up Palafin-H. Earth Power hits the Fire-types such as Volcanion, Chi-Yu, and opposing Heatran that otherwise resists all of Heatran's attacks. Heatran's base resistances let it take common Fairy-, Ice-, and Steel-type attacks such as Flutter Mane's Moonblast, Chien-Pao's Ice Spinner, and Gholdengo's Make It Rain much better. After Terastallization, Heatran matches up better against Palafin-H, Volcanion, and Iron Hands at the cost of receiving more damage from the aforementioned attacks. Heatran has a lot of defensive responsibilities on most teams, so Terastallization should not be used too frivolously. Heatran commonly finds itself in Fire / Water / Grass cores with Rillaboom and Palafin, as they complement each other offensively and defensively, with Rillaboom eradicating Water-types and Palafin punching through Fire-types. Iron Hands is a common Heatran partner that can pressure Palafin and Volcanion with Wild Charge and Chi-Yu and Tera Dark Kingambit with Drain Punch. Heatran has no form of recovery, so it appreciates teammates that can extend its longevity, such as Cresselia with Lunar Blessing and Amoonguss with Pollen Puff.</p>"

Lava Plume makes Heatran annoying to switch into thanks to its burn chance, while Magma Storm softens walls like Toxapex and Rotom-W by trapping them. Earth Power threatens Poison- and Fire-types and makes Heatran an important asset against opposing Steel teams by hitting opposing Heatran. Roar lets Heatran phaze the likes of Nasty Plot Hydreigon and Z-Celebrate Victini and synergizes well with Stealth Rock to deal extra damage. Alternatively, Toxic cripples walls like Mantine and Rotom-W, as well as Pokemon that fancy switching into Heatran such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Substitute pairs well with Toxic and allows Heatran to be massively annoying against types like Steel, Electric, and Psychic by capitalizing on the many switches it forces in these matchups. Thanks to their typing and bulk, Corviknight and Celesteela are excellent teammates to check Ground- and Fighting-types like Mamoswine and Great Tusk for Heatran. Setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Z-Happy Hour Jirachi appreciate Heatran wearing down teams with burn and Toxic. Iron Treads removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin and deals with Mega Charizard Y, Zeraora, and Cinderace with its Choice Scarf set. Ferrothorn checks Water-types like Mega Swampert and Urshifu-R and aids Heatran with Spikes and Leech Seed.</p>"

Heavy-Duty Boots helps Giratina switch in more easily without fear of entry hazard chip, while Covert Cloak helps prevent status from moves like Mortal Spin and Nuzzle.

Levitate grants it an invaluable immunity to the ever-present Spikes, allowing it to work as a wallbreaker that demands other kind of counterplay, like the less common Stealth Rock.</li> <li>However, Giratina-O gets outsped by the entirety of the offensive metagame. While strong, Giratina-O doesn't achieve any notable OHKOs, thus many common Pokemon like Landorus-T, Zacian-C, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Koraidon can pivot around it with relative ease. Giratina-O might also be forced to Terastallize to perform its role as a utility Pokemon due to the relevance of Toxic Pokemon like Clodsire and Gliscor, as well as the existence of faster threats like Zacian-C, Koraidon, Miraidon, and Flutter Mane. Terastallizing is a huge commitment, and Giratina-O more often than not is doing it to be able to perform consistently. Lastly, Giratina-O has a big longevity issue, which can make it struggle in checking the Pokemon it's supposed to, making it fit only on certain styles of teams that can make up for its non-existent recovery with teammates like Wish Alomomola.</li> <li>Thunder Wave can help Giratina-O spread paralysis for itself and its teammates, giving it a form of speed control. With the given EV spread, Giratina-O can take a hit from Zacian-C and potentially paralyze it, which is game-changing. However, it's not a common occurrence, as Giratina-O must be at full HP to accomplish this. Thunder Wave is also unable to paralyze common switch-ins to Giratina-O like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T. As a result, another option to run is Will-O-Wisp, which completely ruins Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Clodsire, while also annoying other switch-ins, namely Arceus formes like Fairy.</li> <li>Shadow Sneak gives Giratina-O a tool to revenge kill Flutter Mane, Tera Ghost Pokemon like Koraidon, and low HP targets like Zacian-C. If this is not needed, however, Giratina-O can effectively run Defog thanks to its positive matchup against common entry hazard setters.</li> <li>The given EV spread permits Giratina-O to live one Play Rough from +1 Zacian-C from full HP. It also gives Giratina-O very favorable chances to avoid the 2HKO from Ice Beam from non-Choice Specs Kyogre. The Speed allows Giratina-O to outspeed uninvested Gliscor, and the remaining EVs are slotted into Attack so that Giratina-O always 2HKOes Zacian-C with Poltergeist.</li> <li>Tera Steel allows Giratina-O to check Pokemon like Koraidon, Miraidon, Zacian-C, and Flutter Mane. It also lets Giratina-O annoy Arceus-Fairy one-on-one and beat Calm Mind Arceus-Ground while making it immune to Toxic from the likes of Gliscor and Clodsire. Tera Poison can be used instead, as it still gives Giratina-O a Fairy-type resistance and poison immunity, but it also gives a new resistance to Fighting that can let it take on Koraidon. This, however, leaves Giratina-O unable to check Zacian-C and resist Dragon-type attacks.</li> <li>Giratina-O fits best on bulky offense teams that need a way to deal with Ground-type Pokemon like Arceus-Ground and Groudon and can't afford to run passive checks to them like Corviknight. Once on the field, Giratina-O can make use of its powerful STAB moves to hit everything in the tier at least for neutral damage; however, be aware that Poltergeist has only 8 PP, meaning that while it's Giratina-O's main way of dealing damage, it should not be used recklessly, as it can get PP stalled with smart pivoting, especially by teams that have Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Extreme Killer Arceus.</li> <li>Giratina-O is forced out by common Pokemon like Zacian-C, Koraidon, and Miraidon. It can also be overwhelmed by very strong Ice-type attacks from the likes of Calyrex-I and Choice Specs Kyogre. Pokemon like Kyogre can help Giratina-O against Calyrex-I and Koraidon, while the likes of Clodsire can help against Miraidon. Other Pokemon like Skeledirge and Arceus-Fairy can help Giratina-O against Zacian-C and Koraidon, respectively. Lastly, Pokemon that can help against Ting-Lu, like Arceus-Fairy and Gliscor, are also good teammates, as Ting-Lu's Ruination threatens to put a severe dent in Giratina-O's HP, and Ting-Lu can freely use Spikes against Giratina-O.</li> </ul>"

Giratina-O's Ground immunity gives it excellent opportunities to switch in on the ever-present Spikes, which allows it to act as somewhat of a wallbreaker that also happens to give Defog support, as most defensive teams will only have said Spikes as way of dealing with wallbreakers, which Giratina-O is immune to.</li> <li>However, Giratina-O's strongest attack is Draco Meteor; this makes Giratina-O prone to be taken advantage by setup sweepers like Tera Fairy Miraidon, Zacian-C, Kyogre, and Flutter Mane. Hex is also a very weak move if the foe is not statused, meaning that Giratina-O will not be attacking for the majority of the early- to mid-game and instead, it'll be spreading status conditions and using Defog. Lastly, Giratina-O's poor Speed leaves it outsped by the likes of Koraidon and Arceus formes.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp spreads status to empower Hex and annoy Pokemon like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and most Arceus formes that will regularly be switching into Giratina-O.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Giratina-O to avoid being 2HKOed by any of Kyogre's attacks without Stealth Rock while outspeeding 0 Speed Gliscor. The remaining EVs maximize Special Attack for Giratina-O to hit as hard as possible.</li> <li>Tera Steel allows Giratina-O to check Pokemon like Flutter Mane. It also lets Giratina-O annoy Calm Mind Arceus formes while making it immune to Toxic from the likes of Gliscor and Clodsire. Tera Fairy can be used instead for Giratina-O to become immune to the Dragon-type attacks that will be aimed at it from Koraidon, Miraidon, and opposing Giratina-O.</li> <li>Giratina-O fits best on bulky offense teams that need a way to battle Ground-type Pokemon like Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground and Groudon, and also need a hazard removal Pokemon. If using Defog is not needed, Giratina-O can instead spread status with Will-O-Wisp and launch Draco Meteors to dent Pokemon like Ting-Lu.</li> <li>Giratina-O wants to be paired with physical attackers like Koraidon, Zacian-C, Arceus-Ground, and Calyrex-I that can deal with the walls that annoy it. In return, Giratina-O can deal with the physically bulky Pokemon, like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Landorus-T, that annoy them. Clodsire and Ting-Lu are good teammates as well, as they take on Pokemon that Giratina-O can't, like Miraidon and Choice Specs Kyogre in Clodsire's case.</li> </ul>"

Poltergeist breaks Arceus-Ground's Substitute, which would otherwise block Will-O-Wisp and Dragon Tail, in one hit; alternatively, running Hex lets Giratina-O hit statused walls harder and makes burn affect it much less. Dragon Tail quickly racks up entry hazard damage on the opposing team and prevents foes from continuously setting up against Giratina-O, which is especially useful against Taunt users. The given EV spread lets Giratina take unboosted Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and outspeed Taunt Landorus-T. Tera Steel makes Giratina-O immune to poison from foes such as Toxapex and gives it a resistance to moves like Arceus-Fairy's Judgment, Zacian-C's Play Rough and Behemoth Blade, Koraidon's Scale Shot, and Arceus-Ground's Dragon Claw and Ice Beam. Tera Poison similarly removes Giratina-O's Dragon weakness and provides it with an immunity to Toxic and a resistance to Fairy, but it doesn't make Giratina-O weak to Koraidon's Low Kick.

Calyrex-S likes Giratina-O being able to deal with its two main switch-ins, Arceus and Ting-Lu, by checking the former and removing the latter's Spikes. Because it lacks recovery, Giratina-O can get overwhelmed by the Pokemon it checks when facing hyper offense teams, so it appreciates revenge killers such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Choice Scarf Koraidon.</p>"

Moonblast rounds out Cresselia's coverage, allowing it to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Greninja super effectively while being able to at least damage Kingambit; Tera Blast Fighting greatly improves Cresselia's matchup against Kingambit and hits these Dark-types harder than Moonblast, but makes Cresselia more reliant on Terastallization. Leftovers grants Cresselia crucial passive healing, allowing it to conserve its limited Moonlight PP long-term; Covert Cloak, on the other hand, blocks secondary effects from an array of moves, including Heatran's Magma Storm, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Zapdos's Discharge, and Sneasler's Dire Claw, allowing Cresselia to set up against these threats more safely. Grassy Seed is an option if Cresselia is used on Grassy Terrain hyper offense teams, which gives it more opprotunities to set up in the face of physical attackers while also boosting its Stored Power. Tera Poison has wonderful synergy with Levitate, giving Cresselia a single weakness to Psychic-type attacks, granting it resistances to Poison- and Fairy-type attacks, and an immunity to Toxapex's Toxic while still maintaining its Fighting resistance. Defensively, Tera Fighting lets Cresselia flip its Dark weakness against prominent Pokemon like Meowscarada, Greninja, Hisuian Samurott, and the aforementioned Kingambit as well. 52 Speed EVs allow Cresselia to outspeed Kingambit.</p> <p>Cresselia fits well on an array of hyper offense, offense, and balance teams capable of supporting such a potent wincon.

Kingambit is ubiquitous and is a major thorn in Cresselia's side; as such, Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Low Kick Kingambit are crucial partners that can help stop opposing Kingambit's attempt to countersweep.

          "description": "<p>Cresselia serves as a potentially terrifying setup sweeper, using its naturally titanic mixed bulk alongside Terastallization to accumulate multiple Calm Mind boosts, bolstering its Stored Power to incredibly dangerous levels to easily snowball if given the opportunity. Even without Terastallization, it can use its natural typing to withstand attacks from dangerous Pokemon such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Mega Medicham. Hidden Power Fighting is the preferred coverage move to hit Mega Tyranitar and Heatran much harder, while Moonblast provides a stronger hit against the likes of Dragapult and Urshifu-R if Cresselia cannot afford to accumulate multiple Calm Mind boosts. Tera Poison is essential for removing Cresselia's weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Hisuian Samurott while providing less exploitable weaknesses compared to Tera Steel, which makes Cresselia prone to being revenge killed by Fighting- and Fire-types such as Mega Lopunny, Sneasler, Heatran, and Mega Charizard Y. Covert Cloak allows Cresselia to negate secondary effects from Garganacl's Salt Cure and status from the likes of Toxapex, Sneasler, and Zapdos, while Leftovers provides passive recovery that makes Cresselia less exploitable and forced to heal. Maximum Speed EVs allow Cresselia to consistently outspeed Heatran and Gholdengo, which could otherwise irritate it, although more Defense investment could be used instead to better withstand attacks from the likes of Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Cresselia fits best on either bulky balance or hyper offense teams, both able to provide support in different ways; the former give Cresselia a defensive core to fall back on should its sweep fail, while the latter pressure opposing defensive teams and can provide dual screens support via Tapu Koko and Dragapult to bolster its bulk even further. Both playstyles can reliably keep up Spikes using Skarmory, Clodsire, Mega Diancie, or Garchomp, which Cresselia mandates in order to wear down its checks such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Similarly, Knock Off support from the likes of Toxapex and Iron Valiant helps Cresselia pressure the aforementioned checks more effectively. Cresselia has difficulty withstanding rain teams due to them cutting Moonlight's healing, so defensive partners that match up positively against them such as Toxapex and Tera Water or Dragon Garganacl are appreciated. Cresselia struggles with bulkier playstyles that can neutralize it with the likes of Haze Toxapex and Unaware Tera Dark Clodsire, so Pokemon that can break defensive teams such as Swords Dance Gliscor and Gholdengo make for good partners.</p>"

Knock Off is used to remove key items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Assault Vest from potential switch-ins like Swampert, Corviknight, and Desolate Land Iron Moth. Ice Beam dissuades Roaring Moon and Dragonite from setting up on Manaphy. Energy Ball is optionally usable to hit Swampert and opposing Manaphy. Manaphy is excellent at switching into attacks from Heatran, Gholdengo, and Walking Wake, utilizing a slow U-turn to bring in strong but frail wallbreakers like Chien-Pao and Iron Boulder. Great Tusk is a good partner, being immune to the Electric-type attacks Manaphy is weak to, doubling as a top tier entry hazard remover, switching into Knock Off attempts from the likes of Roaring Moon and Mandibuzz. Manaphy should be aware of Knock Off, as it is heavily reliant on Assault Vest to provide defensive value. Manaphy can be overwhelmed by teams with multiple special wallbreakers like Deoxys-S, Hisuian Electrode, Azelf, and Walking Wake, so it should be run either with a secondary special wall or on more offensive teams that limit opposing wallbreakers.

Manaphy is also able to help these pivots by providing offensive pressure and being able to end games for them. Manaphy struggles to deal with specially bulky walls such as Blissey, Hisuian Goodra, and Unaware Deoxys-D, so it partners up well with Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Roaring Moon, and Latios to help deal with them and pressure them into more unfavorable positions. Manaphy also works well on hyper offense teams if using Protosynthesis due to Booster Energy being single-use; on these teams, it likes to be supported by other special wallbreakers such as Latios, Gholdengo, and Azelf that can help to wear down specially bulky checks for Manaphy like Blissey, Iron Moth, and Ceruledge.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Calm Mind Arceus-Dark is an incredibly potent sweeper and stallbreaker in Ubers UU. Its amazing bulk allows it to set up on the many special attackers in the tier, such as Kyurem-W, Chi-Yu, and Mewtwo, and Taunt stops Blissey and other Arceus formes from setting up alongside it with their own Calm Mind, blocks Encore from Magearna, and prevents phazing from Giratina, Skarmory, and Dialga. Recover allows it to increase its longevity and set up on some physical attackers, such as Solgaleo and Kingambit. Tera Fairy grants Arceus-Dark a resistance to Fighting-type moves from the likes of Urshifu-S, Deoxys, and Mewtwo, along with an immunity to Dragon Tail, the only phazing move that cannot be prevented by Taunt. Tera Poison turns its Fairy, Fighting, and Bug weaknesses into resistances, which is incredible for setting up on Zacian, Magearna, and Zamazenta-C. Arceus-Dark greatly benefits from the help of Pokemon that can deal with physical attackers, as Zacian and Zamazenta-C both offensively check it, so Dondozo, Lugia, Skarmory, physically defensive Solgaleo, and Magearna form good defensive cores with it. Other Pokemon that pair well with Arceus-Dark are Zamazenta-C and Annihilape, as both are Defense-boosting offensive sweepers that can wall and eliminate physical attackers for Arceus-Dark to freely take care of special attackers. Arceus-Dark is very entry hazard weak, so Pokemon like Giratina and Great Tusk that can remove hazards for Arceus-Dark are greatly appreciated. Giratina appreciates Arceus-Dark's ability to check Dark- and Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Spectrier, and Great Tusk appreciates Arceus-Dark beating common checks to it like Giratina, Skarmory, and Deoxys.</p>"

Arceus-Dark can run Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers, like Zacian and Zamazenta-C switching in, or it can run Stealth Rock to give its team entry hazard support if a partner doesn't have the move. Roar phazes many setup sweepers, such as Arceus and Mewtwo, whereas Taunt blocks them from setting up altogether. Taunt also shuts down many lead Pokemon like Smeargle and Galvantula and can force your opponent on the back foot provided it wins a Speed tie against opposing Arceus-Dark. Tera Poison turns Dark's Fairy, Fighting, and Bug weaknesses into resistances, which is especially helpful versus Zacian and Volcarona. Tera Fairy gives similar resistances to Poison, but the neutrality to Psychic and Ground helps against Great Tusk and Deoxys, and the valuable Dragon immunity lets Arceus-Dark beat Kyurem-W. Arceus-Dark benefits from specially defensive partners like Blissey, Calm Mind Clefable, and Giratina due to being weak to special attackers such as Magearna and Palkia-O. Arceus-Dark also pairs well with Corviknight and Regieleki, as both can remove hazards to keep it healthy and pivot it onto the field.</p>"

Roar or Dragon Tail is used to stop setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Mewtwo and Calm Mind Arceus variants. Roar can be prevented by Taunt; however, unlike Dragon Tail it can phaze Fairy-types and Pokemon behind Substitute. Taunt is an alternative option to prevent opposing Pokemon from boosting and allow Arceus-Dark to chip down passive wall Pokemon like Giratina and Solgaleo by preventing them from healing. The last moveslot is fairly flexible; Arceus-Dark can serve as an effective entry hazard setter with Stealth Rock, while Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave let it cripple offensive Pokemon like Palafin and Ogerpon-H. Tera Poison lets Arceus-Dark beat setup sweepers that can otherwise force it out like Zacian and Arceus-Fighting. Tera Fairy provides similar resistances as Poison while also providing an extremely useful immunity to Dragon, letting it better check threats like Palkia-O, while not causing a pesky weakness to the Psychic-type moves fired off from Pokemon such as Mewtwo and Deoxys. Arceus-Dark checks Pokemon like Chi-Yu and Kyurem-W, so it pairs well with Pokemon like Zamazenta-C, Mewtwo, Palkia-O and Solgaleo, which struggle against those threats. Physically defensive Pokemon like Great Tusk and Calm Mind Lugia complement Arceus-Dark well; the former can beat many Dark-resistant Pokemon that pressure it like both Urshifu formes while appreciating its ability to check Psychic-types, and the latter checks Fighting-types well and appreciates other setup sweepers being deterred from setting up. Giratina is another good teammate thanks to its typing letting it check sweepers that Arceus-Dark cannot, such as Arceus-Fire and Sneasler; in exchange, Arceus-Dark checks opposing Ghost- and Dark-types such as Spectrier and Chi-Yu and spreads status so Giratina can fire off powerful Hexes.</p>"

Furthermore, Arceus-Fairy's bulk and resistances make it a useful soft check to Pokemon such as Arceus, Giratina-O, Kyurem-B, Zekrom, Chien-Pao, Rayquaza, and even Miraidon and Flutter Mane. Good neutral coverage with Fairy-type Judgment allows Arceus-Fairy to take full advantage of its ample support movepool featuring Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, Stealth Rock, and Taunt. Outside of being a bit passive against Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Zacian-C and having to play around opposing Terastallization carefully, Arceus-Fairy has little to no flaws and should be strongly considered for any balance team.</p>",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Earth Power and Power Gem are coverage options for a fully dedicated Calm Mind set. The problem is that Arceus-Fairy always loses to either Necrozma-DM or Ho-Oh, so while these coverage options are viable, they require dedicated team support. Of the two, Earth Power is more plausible, as Ho-Oh may be crippled by Knock Off support. Losing access to status or Stealth Rock also leaves Arceus-Fairy more passive in general.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-Resistant Tanks</strong>: Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Zacian-C take little damage from Judgment and can use Arceus-Fairy as an opportunity to set up, although none of them like taking Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Tera Fire Users</strong>: Arceus-Fairy cannot burn common physical attackers like Koraidon and Necrozma-DM after they have used Tera Fire, which also greatly weakens the power of Judgment. Koraidon can notably guarantee the OHKO on Arceus-Fairy at +2 with Tera Fire Flare Blitz, necessitating Arceus-Fairy to use Tera Water itself. These Pokemon are still vulnerable to Thunder Wave, but they may still be able to sweep with enough boosts.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Arceus-Fairy is vulnerable to all forms of status and entry hazard damage, which force it to use Recover more often and lose momentum.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind</strong>: Calm Mind users like Arceus-Ground, Kyogre, and Arceus-Grass take little from Judgment and can use Calm Mind relatively freely as a result.</p>",

Thunder Wave is extremely useful for crippling all of Arceus-Fairy's most common switch-ins in Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Zacian-C. It is also a safe move to use against Koraidon should you expect it to use Tera Fire and is especially useful because Arceus-Fairy discourages all Ground- and Electric-types bar Clodsire from switching in. Will-O-Wisp more directly cripples physical attackers like Koraidon and Necrozma-DM, although it cannot hit Ho-Oh and Tera Fire users. The third moveslot is fairly flexible; Stealth Rock is a good option, as it frees up moveslots for Arceus-Fairy's teammates. Taunt prevents Clodsire and specially defensive Gliscor from being able to use Spikes and Toxic. Dragon Tail can be a good way to rack up entry hazard damage and can phaze setup sweepers that may not mind being hit with status, and it is highly recommended when running Will-O-Wisp. Calm Mind turns Arceus-Fairy into a dangerous setup sweeper, albeit one that requires significant team support to handle Necrozma-DM and especially Ho-Oh. It is a good option on teams that already have plentiful ways to spread status. Tera Water is mandatory in case Arceus-Fairy needs to take a boosted Flare Blitz from Koraidon, and it can be useful in a pinch against Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C. Tera Water in combination with Calm Mind can more easily clean up weakened teams, as Necrozma-DM won't have a coverage option to hit Arceus-Fairy. The EVs allow Arceus-Fairy to outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured base 90 Pokemon such as Kyogre, with the rest being dumped into physical bulk.</p> <p>While Arceus-Fairy is a great wall, it's unable to take on notable physical attackers like Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C without Terastallizing. As a result, defensive Necrozma-DM is a fantastic partner, and the two together reasonably cover nearly all physical threats in the tier. Ting-Lu and Clodsire can take on Miraidon and appreciate Arceus-Fairy's Dragon immunity that allows it to pivot into Draco Meteor, making them fantastic teammates. Defensive Ho-Oh, Gliscor, and Eternatus can handle offensive Ho-Oh without much fear of Sacred Fire burns, with Eternatus having the added benefit of checking Kyogre and absorbing Toxic Spikes. Strong but relatively slow wallbreakers such as Kyogre, Swords Dance Necrozma-DM, and offensive Ho-Oh like the paralysis support that Arceus-Fairy can provide. Kyogre notably helps with the Koraidon matchup, as it can pivot into Flare Blitz and bring rain that negates Koraidon's ability, making it a great partner. Giratina-O can handle Arceus-Ground and provide much-appreciated Defog support.</p>"

Recover allows it to shrug off recoil damage from Flare Blitz with minimal difficulty.

Arceus-Fire fits on a wide variety of teams, but it has a few notable partners.

      "overview": "<p>Besides Koraidon and Miraidon, Arceus-Ground is perhaps the most terrifying setup sweeper in Ubers. Strong Ground-type STAB moves in combination with Rock-type coverage makes switching into Arceus-Ground a challenge in a tier where Ground-type checks are few and far between, demolishing many tier staples such as Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Ho-Oh. Arceus-Ground can also take hits with relative ease thanks to its good bulk and the lack of super effective coverage against it, allowing it to boost multiple times. Arceus-Ground is one of the few checks to Miraidon in the tier and the only one that packs significant offensive pressure. Arceus-Ground is held back by its four-moveslot syndrome and inability to check Miraidon very reliably by itself, as it lacks the raw bulk that Ting-Lu has and the ability to run Heavy-Duty Boots that Clodsire provides. Additionally, other Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Water may provide better defensive utility, while Arceus can give great revenge killing support with Extreme Speed. Overall, Arceus-Ground is a staple of offense and balance structures alike.</p>",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A support set featuring moves like Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Stealth Rock is possible, although it has some issues. Calm Mind provides a way to handle Double Dance Miraidon and makes Arceus-Ground a great cleaner, so it generally has more utility. In addition, Ground-type Judgment has several immunities in the tier, forcing you to choose between Arceus-Ground being hard walled or having more support moves available. A physically defensive set of 52 HP / 232 Def / 24 SpD with a Relaxed nature with Earthquake / Ice Beam / Stealth Rock / Recover is an option, although not often seen due to the plethora of defensive Ground-types in the tier.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Giratina-O is one of the most complete checks to Arceus-Ground, as it can tank Stone Edge and Power Gem very well and threaten back with Will-O-Wisp, Dragon Tail, and Poltergeist. Landorus-T is a severe annoyance to the Dragon Dance set thanks to Intimidate, though it must watch out for Ice Beam. Gliscor can rack up damage on predicted Taunts by using Earthquake and can cripple Calm Mind Arceus-Ground with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Kyogre sets tank any hit outside of a Tera Ground-boosted Earthquake and OHKO back, and it can go head-to-head with Calm Mind sets. Arceus-Water can similarly take any hit and severely damage Arceus-Ground with a super effective Judgment. Both must be careful of Calm Mind Arceus-Ground should it choose to Terastallize.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Grass</strong>: While rare, Arceus-Grass is the best check to Arceus-Ground in the game, easily taking any hit and doing extreme damage back with Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Phazing</strong>: While they usually prefer to save their health for other threats like Miraidon and offensive Ho-Oh, both Ting-Lu and Ho-Oh can phaze Arceus-Ground in a pinch, as Ting-Lu can tank any hit thrown at it and Ho-Oh survives Power Gem at +1.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Arceus-Ground is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards and status effects, jeopardizing its ability to attain multiple boosts as well as check Miraidon.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance turns Arceus-Ground into a devastating wallbreaker that can also clean up weakened teams with ease. Stone Edge hits Ho-Oh and does good damage to most Ground-immune targets like Landorus-T and Gliscor. Taunt prevents status from Pokemon like Skeledirge, Giratina-O, and Gliscor and is useful to prevent Whirlwind from Ting-Lu. Recover is highly recommended on non-hyper offense teams to provide Arceus-Ground with more longevity, which is critical for checking Miraidon in the long term. Ice Beam can more directly deal with Gliscor and Landorus-T, which often pivot in on Arceus-Ground. Tera Ground is usually preferred, as the power boost can be critical for Arceus-Ground to get past Pokemon like Koraidon and bulky Kyogre that otherwise survive a +1 Earthquake. Tera Ghost has some utility providing Fighting and Normal immunities, which prevents common revenge kill options like Choice Scarf Koraidon's Low Kick and Extreme Killer Arceus's Extreme Speed. The EVs outspeed all base 90 Speed Pokemon, with the rest dumped into HP.</p> <p>This set is a mainstay on hyper offense teams thanks to its strong wallbreaking power and ability to reasonably deal with Miraidon. It appreciates fellow setup sweepers such as Scale Shot Koraidon, Double Dance Miraidon, Zacian-C, and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM that can help it break through defensive cores. Hyper offense leads such as Deoxys-S and Glimmora pair well with Arceus-Ground, helping it net KOs easier without the need to Terastallize; two layers of Spikes give it a good chance to OHKO Koraidon, and Stealth Rock helps damage Landorus-T and Gliscor, which may try to pivot around Arceus-Ground. Additionally, Grimmsnarl's dual screens support has notably potent synergy with Arceus-Ground, as its great bulk becomes even better, allowing it to get multiple Dragon Dance boosts with ease. If Arceus-Ground is on a more balanced team, another Miraidon check like Ting-Lu or specially defensive Gliscor is appreciated, as this Arceus-Ground set is not reliable at handling Miraidon multiple times by itself.</p>"

        "Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<p>Calm Mind Arceus-Ground is an extremely potent win condition that doubles in use as a good Miraidon check. It has more bulk than Clodsire while also having the reliable recovery that Ting-Lu lacks, giving it a distinct niche. Calm Mind and an Electric immunity makes this set one of the few Pokemon in the game that can defeat Double Dance Miraidon one-on-one. Furthermore, thanks to its powerful Ground-type Judgment, specially defensive walls such as Eternatus and Clodsire are unable to freely use Toxic, and Power Gem heavily discourages Ho-Oh from forcing it out with Whirlwind. This makes Arceus-Ground the least reliant on using Tera to sweep successfully out of all the Arceus formes. Tera Fairy is mainly chosen for helping against Miraidon which may otherwise break through Arceus-Ground, although its added resistance to Koraidon's Low Kick is appreciated. Tera Steel also helps against Miraidon, with the distinction of providing a Poison immunity that may be useful against specially defensive Gliscor and Eternatus. The set's EVs maximize special bulk, which is critical for handling Miraidon, and outspeed all neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon. More offensive EV spreads are possible, although they require further teammate support for Miraidon. 132 HP / 252 SpA / 124 Spe with a Modest nature gives Arceus-Ground maximum offensive output, notably giving it a chance to OHKO Ho-Oh at +1, while outspeeding all positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon. 248 HP / 144 Def / 100 SpA / 16 Spe allow Arceus-Ground to 2HKO Clodsire unboosted and take two Flare Blitzes from Koraidon, giving it some physically defensive utility and making it harder to revenge kill.</p> <p>Arceus-Ground is extremely hard to stop late-game once its checks have been chipped down. Opposing Calm Mind Arceus formes often lose in a one-on-one battle thanks to this set's higher special investment, leaving only checks like Ting-Lu, Kyogre, and Ho-Oh that can phaze or overpower Arceus-Ground. Gliscor is an excellent teammate, as it patches up the lack of entry hazard support that forgoing Ting-Lu or Clodsire causes. In addition, Gliscor is a great switch-in to Ting-Lu, Ho-Oh, and Choice Scarf Koraidon, allowing it to use Toxic and set hazards early-game to great effect. Skeledirge is a fairly solid check to Scale Shot Koraidon that loves Arceus-Ground taking on Miraidon, which commonly switches in on it. Knock Off Necrozma-DM is a great lure for Kyogre and Ho-Oh, as getting rid of their Heavy-Duty Boots makes them much more susceptible to entry hazard damage. Eternatus can switch in on Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Grass and force them out with Toxic while also absorbing the Toxic Spikes that Arceus-Ground is vulnerable to. Miraidon is a good offensive partner for damaging Ting-Lu over time and switching in easily on Ho-Oh.</p>"

Tidy Up supplements a strong Earthquake and allows Arceus-Ground to sweep late-game when its checks like Celesteela and Yveltal have been removed. Spirit Shackle is solely for Imposter users; after trapping one, Arceus-Ground can always boost to +6 and beat it one-on-one, putting the opponent in a heavily disadvantaged position. Strength Sap is necessary for Arceus-Ground to Imposter-proof itself, and it usually heals for more than Recover; Arceus-Ground being a physical attacker also prevents the bane of most Ice Scales Arceus formes, Magic Guard Blissey, from denying it healing. Earth Plate provides a damage boost to Earthquake and can't be removed with Knock Off or Trick, while Covert Cloak shuts down passive damage from Salt Cure and Mortal Spin, making boosting easier. Arceus-Ground's main drawback is that against teams with Strength Sap, Haze, or Topsy-Turvy Celesteela or Yveltal it's never sweeping; as a result, threats like Bolt Strike Mega Garchomp and Mega Lucario are useful teammates. Arceus-Ground can also struggle against Palkia-O and No Retreat Arceus-Ghost, so backup checks to them like Salt Cure users and Mega Audino help out. Arceus-Ground can almost always Imposter-proof itself thanks to Spirit Shackle, but if it's badly poisoned or if the Imposter user has a Covert Cloak, then some physical tank like Mega Slowbro or Yveltal can fulfil this role.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp improves Arceus-Ground's ability to check physical attackers. Ice beam hits Landorus-T, Giratina-O, Wo-Chien, and Tera Grass and Tera Flying Pokemon such as Calyrex-S and Skeledirge, respectively. Alternatively, Taunt can be run to prevent Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Toxapex from setting up entry hazards, phazing Arceus-Ground, and spreading status, and it also prevents sweepers like Extreme Killer Arceus and Calm Mind Arceus formes from setting up. 16 Speed EVs let Arceus-Ground outspeed Modest Kyogre and Adamant Groudon. Tera Fairy gives Arceus-Ground a much-needed immunity to Koraidon's Dragon-type moves, Miraidon's Draco Meteor, and Giratina-O's Dragon Tail, as well as a resistance to the former's Low Kick, making it more difficult to revenge kill and phaze. On the other hand, Tera Water lets Arceus-Ground resist Water-type attacks from Arceus-Water and Choice-locked Kyogre, allowing it to set up on them with relative ease, resists Flare Blitz from Koraidon, and Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C. Tera Poison allows Arceus-Ground to resist Judgment from Arceus-Fairy, Low Kick from Koraidon, and Grass Knot from Calyrex-S; absorb tedious Toxic Spikes; and become immune to Toxapex's and Eternatus's Toxic. Defensive Calm Mind Arceus-Ground fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to soft check physical attackers while being a potent sweeper itself. Ting-Lu is a great check to Arceus-Ground, which makes Calyrex-S a great teammate as they both wear down Ting-Lu for each other, potentially enabling one to sweep. Calyrex-S and Kyogre revenge kill Arceus-Ground, and the physical attackers it checks may overwhelm Arceus-Ground, so checks to them such as Ting-Lu, Eternatus, Toxapex, and Landorus-T are appreciated. Potent revenge killers like Choice Scarf Koraidon and Extreme Killer Arceus are also appreciated. Arceus-Ground struggles with Grass Knot from Calyrex-S, and also struggles with Giratina-O, so Arceus can check Calyrex-S while also pressurizing Giratina-O with Swords Dance boosted-Shadow Claw, which makes it a great teammate for Arceus-Ground.</p>"

Ice Beam smashes Landorus-T, which would otherwise wall Arceus-Ground. Dragon Claw is primarily used to hit Giratina-O and Landorus-T, while Gravity is a similar option to hit them as well. Taunt shuts down Skeledirge and Toxapex while preventing Ting-Lu from phazing Arceus-Ground. Substitute eases prediction versus Terastallization while also blocking status from the aforementioned Pokemon. Recover lets Arceus-Ground set up on Pokemon such as Landorus-T and have a longer term presence throughout the game but is generally outclassed by the prior two options. Tera Fairy lets Arceus-Ground take Koraidon's Low Kick and Dragon-type attacks, take Miraidon's Draco Meteor, and, when paired with Substitute or Taunt, use Giratina-O as setup fodder. At +1, Tera Ground lets Earthquake OHKO Koraidon and 2HKO defensive Arceus formes and Ting-Lu. Tera Steel is another option for resisting Calyrex-S's Grass Knot, Miraidon and Koraidon's Dragon-type attacks, both of Zacian-C's STAB attacks, and Extreme Speed from Arceus. However, Tera Steel leaves Arceus-Ground open to Choice Scarf Koraidon. Arceus-Ground acts as a wincon after wallbreakers such as Koraidon, Zacian-C, and Calyrex-S have broken down its checks in Landorus-T and defensive Arceus formes. Extreme Killer Arceus is another solid partner for forcing damage on Giratina-O, opening up Arceus-Ground late-game. Arceus-Ground can be revenge killed by the likes of Choice Scarf Koraidon, Arceus, and Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, so checks to these such as Landorus-T and Arceus formes are appreciated.

Ting-Lu is the most effective check to Arceus-Ground, so Calyrex-S is a very potent teammate, as they both wear down Ting-Lu for the other to take advantage of. Zacian-C, Koraidon, and opposing Calyrex-S can all revenge kill Arceus-Ground, so checks to them like Landorus-T and Ting-Lu on bulky offense or teammates that can take advantage of them like Calyrex-S, Arceus-Fairy, and Extreme Killer Arceus on hyper offense are greatly appreciated.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Victini is a great wallbreaker on Psychic teams due to its well-rounded coverage and signature move in V-create, easing the matchup against Steel, Grass, and Ice teams. Bolt Strike threatens bulky Water-types such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Tapu Fini that resist V-create. U-turn preserves Psychic's momentum and allows Victini to switch out of Pokemon that wall it like Dragonite and Mega Altaria. Trick cripples common switch-ins such as Storm Drain Gastrodon, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, while Brick Break lets Victini further threaten Steel and Dark teams by hitting Heatran and Mega Tyranitar hard. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele is an excellent teammate due to its ability to check Dark- and Dragon-types like Weavile, Kommo-o, and Hydreigon. It also sets up Psychic Terrain, protecting Victini from priority moves from the likes of Mimikyu and Azumarill. Jirachi and Celebi aid in Victini's wallbreaking by setting up Stealth Rock and replenishing its HP with Healing Wish. Furthermore, they form a pivot core with Victini that deals sizable chip damage while keeping momentum. Latias also provides Healing Wish support and removes entry hazards with Defog to preserve Victini's longevity. Mega Gallade and Victini can each weaken certain physical walls for the other to dispose of such as Ting-Lu and Skeledirge. Deoxys-S breaks through roadblocks like Toxapex, Garchomp, and Swampert and aids in cleaning weakened Flying and Water teams. Slowbro switches into most Water- and Ground-types that threaten Victini, like Urshifu-R and Excadrill, and it brings Victini into the field with Teleport.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Victini is a potent revenge killer, capable of picking almost any foe to trade with using Final Gambit including Zamazenta and Landorus-T while also having the option to cripple other switch-ins with its remaining movepool. U-turn is useful to pivot out of checks that shrug off V-create like Toxapex and defensive Landorus-T, although Victini should be wary of Rocky Helmet on the latter. Trick is used to cripple tanks like Garganacl and Slowbro, reducing their longevity while receiving Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers in return. V-create's explosive power needs little Attack investment to perform effectively, still easily 2HKOing most neutral targets including defensive Volcarona and Tornadus-T. Thus, 248 HP EVs are instead used to maximize the potential of Final Gambit while minimizing damage from Stealth Rock. Tera Fire is used to fuel V-create, notably OHKOing Tornadus-T, and remove Victini’s weakness to Pursuit, but this comes at the cost of a comparably worse defensive typing against foes like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta. Victini's ability to threaten any foe allows it to very easily pivot into wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R, which appreciate having annoying defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Toxapex crippled or removed with Trick or Final Gambit. Setup sweepers also benefit greatly from Victini's presence, as it can surprise and KO defensive threats that would otherwise impede their progress; allies like Mega Medicham and Garchomp enjoy having threats like Gliscor and Landorus-T removed, and the clean field left after Victini KOes itself also affords them a free point of entry. However, Victini must be kept as healthy as possible to ensure that Final Gambit can OHKO what it needs to. Thus, allies that can soak up Water- and Ground-type moves like Gastrodon and Rotom-W make for valuable partners. Entry hazard removal from allies like Zapdos is also useful to ensure hazards do not hamper Victini’s effectiveness.</p>"
        },
        "Z-Celebrate": {
          "description": "<p>Victini is a potent user of Z-Celebrate, as its already decent natural bulk and typing greatly appreciate the defensive boosts, not to mention the offensive power gained. STAB-boosted Stored Power easily 2HKOes many defensive foes like Gliscor and even Unaware users including Clodsire and Skeledirge. Searing Shot is another STAB option to target Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Focus Blast allows Victini to target pesky Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu along with Heatran, with its low accuracy somewhat offset by Victory Star. Victini can leverage its bulk to set up on many fast threats such as Mega Lopunny, and its buff after omniboosting lets it survive super effective moves from more passive enemies like Gliscor, making it a perfect fit on hyper offense. It is also naturally resistant to priority moves like Bullet Punch from Scizor, Vacuum Wave from Iron Valiant, and Grassy Glide from Rillaboom. Z-Celebrate Victini pairs well with entry hazard suicide leads like Landorus-T and Garchomp, as their Stealth Rock and potentially Spikes support is invaluable; with Stealth Rock, an OHKO on Tera Water Great Tusk and Ogerpon-W are near guaranteed; Stealth Rock also notably breaks Ogerpon-C’s Sturdy along with stray Focus Sashes. Victini also appreciates teammates like Close Combat Iron Valiant luring Blissey and Tera Dark Clodsire, and they also help soften up Ting-Lu for Victini. Tapu Lele is another useful ally that can boost Stored Power with its summoned Psychic Terrain, which also prevents priority including Mega Lopunny’s Fake Out and Hisuian Samurott’s Sucker Punch for a limited time. After Victini heavily weakens foes and potentially forces them to Terastallize, Tapu Lele can also clean up, since any remaining Psychic-resistant foes would be heavily chipped.</p>"

        "Pivot": {
          "description": "<p>Victini is a pivot with a unique defensive typing, allowing it to soft check threats such as Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Mega Charizard Y, although its lack of recovery leaves it vulnerable over the course of a long game, even equipped with Heavy-Duty Boots. Instead, Victini makes explosive use of each opportunity it gets to blast through foes with V-create, leaving a massive dent in many defensive cores once it manages to pivot in. Bolt Strike is used for coverage, targeting Water-types like Pelipper, Alomomola, and Toxapex. U-turn allows Victini to pivot out of bad matchups like Great Tusk and Rotom-W or after using V-create, pivoting in teammates to help it wallbreak. Encore can lock greedy setup sweepers like Gliscor and Garganacl into moves like Swords Dance or Iron Defense, allowing Victini to give its ally a free switch in or simply hit something hard with V-create. Toxic is an alternative to wear down defensive threats like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T into range of Victini or an ally and also cripple other switch-ins like Garchomp and Dragonite. Tera Fire cranks up the power of V-create, turning Victini into a wallbreaker capable of scorching most neutral targets for a 2HKO, like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Ting-Lu, and also notably OHKOing Tornadus-T. However, it then loses valuable resistances to Fighting- and Psychic-type moves, leaving it unable to check Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham after Tera. Victini suits bulky offense teams that appreciate its role compression both offensively and defensively. Wallbreakers like Weavile, Urshifu-R, and Mega Charizard Y all appreciate Victini's ability to give them free points of entry with U-turn, and the latter also boosts V-create with sun. However, due to its weakness to Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed, as well as its weakness to Knock Off and Pursuit in general, Victini appreciates having teammates that can beat Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile; Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny are good partners to check them and in the latter's case also absorb Knock Off. Victini is also vulnerable to Water-type moves from the likes of Mega Swampert and Basculegion especially when they are in rain, so allies that can soak up these moves like Gastrodon and Ferrothorn are good partners. In return, Victini takes Grass- and Fire-type moves for them, respectively. Finally, Tornadus-T, Landorus-T and Gliscor can help switch into Ground-type moves from the likes of Great Tusk, opposing Landorus-T, and Garchomp, and in return Victini tanks Ice-type moves from Alolan Ninetales and Kyurem for them.</p>"

It has decent natural bulk and a useful defensive typing that helps it find opportunities to switch in and set up against foes like Gliscor and Ogerpon-W. Hidden Power Fire is its most important coverage move for foes like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Iron Crown, all of which could stop Serperior otherwise even after several boosts. Glare provides excellent utility by crippling would-be checks such as Tornadus-T, Dragonite, and Volcarona with paralysis. Substitute, when paired with Glare and passive recovery from Leftovers, enables Serperior to fish for full paralysis and set up against more passive foes like Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking, and it can even stall out Heatran's Magma Storm PP. The combination of Glare and Substitute often forces faster revenge killers like Zamazenta and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele to accept paralysis if they want to break Serperior's Substitute. Leech Seed is an alternative that enables Serperior to beat threats like Heatran on its own. Tera Steel is a wonderful defensive choice that helps against the likes of Tapu Lele, Weavile, and Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T, and it completely shuts down walls like Galarian Slowking alongside Substitute. 56 HP EVs make sure that Serperior can keep its Substitute from being broken by Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Ferrothorn's Power Whip. Tera Blast with an EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe and Tera Ground can be chosen over Substitute to hit foes like Heatran and Galarian Slowking, while Tera Rock trades Serperior's ability to break past Heatran and Galarian Slowking to beat Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona as well as Flying-types like Zapdos, Moltres, and Flyinium Z Tornadus-T. Wallbreakers that benefits from speed control like Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham appreciate Serperior paralyzing faster foes like Darkrai, Tornadus-T, and Iron Valiant with Glare. Specially defensive Pokemon like Heatran and Galarian Slowking can give Serperior a hard time, especially when it's unable to Terastallize, so it is very helpful to have teammates like Landorus-T that can threaten them. Mega Tyranitar and Weavile can both provide Pursuit support for Serperior to pressure Galarian Slowking and Mega Latios, and both of them can also threaten foes like Zapdos and Tornadus-T.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott is a Pokemon that, unlike other entry hazard setters, can offensively threaten teams while getting hazards up thanks to Sharpness-boosted Ceaseless Edge, allowing for more aggressive play and more opportunities to lay Spikes. Ceaseless Edge also lets it get Spikes up against Pokemon such as Hatterene and Taunt Deoxys-S. With Assault Vest, Hisuian Samurott is able to utilize its increased special bulk to check Pokemon like Heatran, Gholdengo, and Dragapult. Additionally, its decent defensive typing is useful for checking other threats like Weavile and Kingambit lacking Low Kick and Tera Blast Fairy. Razor Shell is generally the preferred Water-type STAB move due to its chance to lower Defense, but Aqua Cutter is a viable alternative due to it being non-contact and thus preventing chip damage from Rocky Helmet, which helps against Pokemon like Skarmory and Great Tusk. Aqua Jet gives Hisuian Samurott a priority move to pick off faster, weakened threats like Glimmora, Great Tusk, and Iron Boulder. Sucker Punch is another option for priority; it is not as reliable as Aqua Jet, but it is stronger and better at revenge killing Dragapult, Deoxys-S, and Raging Bolt. Knock Off punishes defensive Pokemon that can impede progress, removing items from foes such as Dondozo, Skarmory, and Primarina. Alternatively, Flip Turn can be used to preserve momentum and safely bring in threats like Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W. 84 Speed EVs let Hisuian Samurott outspeed uninvested Gliscor; the leftover EVs are put into HP to increase its overall bulk. Tera Poison is used to remove its weaknesses to Fighting, Fairy, and Grass so it can take attacks from Pokemon like Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Serperior.</p> <p>Assault Vest Hisuian Samurott fits best on entry hazard-stacking bulky offense teams that appreciate its offensive presence and ability to take special attacks. Gholdengo is an especially good teammate for Hisuian Samurott, since it blocks all hazard removal bar Court Change from Cinderace and has good matchups against Fairy- and Fighting-types that annoy Hisuian Samurott like Clefable and Zamazenta. In return, Hisuian Samurott soft checks Heatran and Volcarona lacking Bug Buzz and Giga Drain. Due to Hisuian Samurott's lack of reliable recovery, pairing it with Pokemon that have titanic special bulk or high longevity like Ting-Lu or Galarian Slowking is encouraged to cover special threats throughout the course of a game. Ting-Lu also has access to Stealth Rock, which, when paired with Spikes and Hisuian Samurott's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, can rack up serious chip damage on the opposing team. Alternative Knock Off users such as Great Tusk, Rillaboom, and Clefable are good for removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon that never come in against Hisuian Samurott like Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and opposing Great Tusk. On top of being a premier pick for bulky offense teams, Great Tusk has the added perk of having access to Rapid Spin, removing hazards the opponent tries to set up so Hisuian Samurott can win the hazard war. Additionally, Rillaboom is able to provide Hisuian Samurott passive recovery thanks to Grassy Terrain. Volcarona is another valuable teammate for Hisuian Samurott, as it really appreciates its checks like Heatran, Primarina, and Raging Bolt getting chipped by Spikes repeatedly; in return, Volcarona is able to handle the Fairy- and Grass- types that give Hisuian Samurott a hard time, mainly Iron Valiant and Rillaboom. Other offensive teammates that appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to set Spikes include, but are not limited to, Kingambit, Kyurem, and Ogerpon-W.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott is a great wallbreaker that can also set Spikes with Ceaseless Edge, allowing the team to make progress easier. Razor Shell provides a strong STAB move with a nasty chance to drop the foe's Defense, while Aqua Cutter has perfect accuracy and doesn't make contact, eliminating the risk of Static versus Zapdos and Rocky Helmet versus Landorus-T. Knock Off allows Hisuian Samurott to remove items, especially Heavy-Duty Boots users like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Alomomola. Flip Turn allows for pivoting while doing decent STAB damage. Sacred Sword allows Hisuian Samurott to 2HKO Ferrothorn and OHKO Mega Lopunny, Darkrai, and Mega Tyranitar. Tera Water lets Hisuian Samurott 2HKO defensive Zapdos and OHKO Mega Medicham most of the time. Tera Dark allows Hisuian Samurott to OHKO Galarian Slowking and Tapu Lele. Tera Poison is an alternative choice, providing a resistance to Fighting-type coverage from Pokemon like Iron Boulder and Mega Lopunny, Fairy-type coverage from Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, and U-turn from foes such as Landorus-T. Wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Darkrai, and Urshifu-R appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to chip foes with Ceaseless Edge. Other Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Gliscor are able to run different moves, as Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes itself. Hisuian Samurott is very frail, and it can have trouble switching in safely, so have pivots that can help with this, such as Landorus-T, Corviknight, Tapu Koko, and Alomomola. Despite using Choice Scarf, Hisuian Samurott is outsped and OHKOed by Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder, and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, so checks to these like Heatran, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos help a lot.</p>"

        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Hisuian Samurott is a very threatening wallbreaker that provides invaluable utility to its team with the Spikes laid by Ceaseless Edge. Black Glasses boosts Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge and Sucker Punch to further heights, allowing it to have an easier time breaking through foes such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Ferrothorn with the former while also giving it an easier time dispatching of revenge killers like Kartana and Iron Moth with the latter. Protective Pads lets Hisuian Samurott avoid contact effects from Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Moltres which could otherwise stop or significantly hinder its ability to wallbreak. Tera Dark further amplifies the power of Hisuian Samurott's Dark-type STAB attacks, allowing it to OHKO targets like Mega Medicham with Sucker Punch without Black Glasses while dealing massive damage to defensive cores which could otherwise shrug off Ceaseless Edge even while boosted, such as Zapdos and Skarmory. Alternatively, Tera Poison provides a useful defensive typing that can turn the tables on foes such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, as well as deny Toxic from Alomomola and turn it into setup fodder. Offensive teams that appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to punch holes in opposing defensive structures while laying Spikes to help them break such as Kartana, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Lele make for good teammates. Defensive teams featuring Dondozo have no trouble with taking boosted Ceaseless Edge, so Tapu Koko and Ferrothorn are good teammates to help with this weakness. These two also assist with ensuring Alomomola and Toxapex are no problem for Hisuian Samurott, since they can otherwise threaten with a potential Toxic or Scald. Additionally, opposing offensive teams can make it hard for Hisuian Samurott to find its footing due to its middling Speed stat, so Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham can assist in these matchups while appreciating the Spikes set versus more balanced styles. Teammates who effectively use Knock Off such as Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Ferrothorn are great teammates as they can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Toxapex, making them more susceptible to the Spikes set by Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge.</p>"

        "Choice Scarf (Water)": {
          "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott is one of Water’s best options for a Choice Scarf user. This is owed to its great STAB combination, of which both types are resisted by only a scant few Pokemon in the metagame, higher power than what is initially apparent due to Sharpness bolstering its slicing moves, a good Speed tier that allows it to outspeed and revenge kill key threats such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and unique progress-making utility for Water in the form of Ceaseless Edge and Knock Off.</p> <p>Ceaseless Edge is Hisuian Samurott’s most important move, allowing it not only to threaten and KO foes with the raw power of a Sharpness-boosted Dark-type STAB move but also set up a layer of Spikes with each use, putting pressure on opposing teams and potentially opening up holes in defensive cores for its teammates to exploit. It is important to note that Spikes laid by Ceaseless Edge cannot be reflected by Magic Bounce, meaning Hisuian Samurott can safely click Ceaseless Edge against Hatterene and still get Spikes up. Hisuian Samurott’s secondary STAB move is a choice between Aqua Cutter and Razor Shell. Aqua Cutter is generally preferred for its consistency due it not making contact with the opponent and its perfect accuracy, allowing Hisuian Samurott to safely deal with Volcarona and Moltres. However, Razor Shell is guaranteed to OHKO Flutter Mane and provides Hisuian Samurott with more wallbreaking capability due to its 50% chance to reduce Defense if the user is willing to tolerate the risk of missing. Sacred Sword serves as an excellent coverage option, allowing Hisuian Samurott to eliminate foes such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Finally, Knock Off provides Hisuian Samurott with a secondary utility in the form of item removal, which can cripple Leftovers users such as Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Toxapex and open up Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Amoonguss to being chipped down by entry hazards, making Hisuian Samurott even riskier for foes to switch into.</p> <p>In terms of teammates, physically defensive Rotom-W is an excellent partner for Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott, checking several of Hisuian Samurott’s bad matchups such as Azumarill, Garchomp, and Scarf Great Tusk and providing Hisuian Samurott with safe opportunities to come in via Volt Switch. Toxapex is another great teammate for Hisuian Samurott, being able to switch into and take hits repeatedly from faster Choice Scarf users such as Sneasler, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant thanks to its defensive typing coupled with Regenerator and Recover. Moreover, Toxapex can serve as an answer to Urshifu-R and can compound on the pressure of Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes with its own Toxic Spikes, while benefitting itself from Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes punishing foes switching around. Gastrodon or Quagsire can absorb Electric-type moves for Hisuian Samurott and set up Stealth Rock to compliment Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes. Wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R, Greninja, Basculegion-M, and Walking Wake as well as sweepers such as Basculegion-F also synergize well with Hisuian Samurott, with Spikes support allowing them to more easily break through enemy teams and the speed control from Choice Scarf meaning potential revenge killers can be removed ahead of time. The speed control from Choice Scarf is still useful even on rain teams even when accompanied by Swift Swim Pokemon such as Basculegion-F, as rain will not always be present on the battlefield. Furthermore, either forme of Basculegion can serve as a spinblocker to prevent the removal of Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes.</p>"

Knock Off provides utility by removing items from switch-ins such as Corviknight and Quaquaval. Sucker Punch is a good priority move that lets Hisuian Samurott deal heavy damage to faster foes such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Zapdos.

Hisuian Samurott's ability to set up Spikes and pester defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Scream Tail by removing their items is appreciated by various offensive teammates such as Chien-Pao and Galarian Zapdos that can take advantage of chipped foes. Fluffy and Intimidate Quaquaval wall Hisuian Samurott very easily, so spinblockers such as Desolate Land Skeledirge and Ceruledge are good partners as they can pressure Quaquaval and block it from removing Spikes set by Hisuian Samurott.

Rapid Spin supports the team while also making sure that Excadrill can beat other Sand Rush Excadrill and Unburden Hawlucha. If a teammate can remove entry hazards, Rock Slide is an alternative that stops Celesteela and Skarmory from stonewalling Excadrill, as well as handling threats such as both Thundurus formes. As a Sand Rush sweeper, Excadrill needs to partner with Tyranitar or Hippowdon to outpace the entire metagame. Strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar, Latios, and Dracozolt form a strong offensive core with Excadrill to help overwhelm its checks such as Slowbro or Skarmory. In return, Excadrill can pressure threats such as Iron Hands and opposing Excadrill for them, respectively. Additionally, Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon, Latias, and Tapu Fini can help pressure some of Excadrill's checks, such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth, while also acting as secondary speed control options outside of sand. Tapu Fini in particular is a great partner to protect Excadrill from burns while setting up, thanks to its Misty Terrain, while also handling Buzzwole for it.

The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense to better check threats such as Mega Latias. Toxic is a great option to cripple common switch-ins to Excadrill such as Buzzwole, Tangrowth, and Slowbro while pressuring other threats such as Latias and Mega Sableye, providing more long-term support for its teammates. Iron Head can be used to check threats such as Clefable more easily. Swords Dance is an option, if running Iron Head instead of Toxic, to become a powerful setup sweeper. If running Swords Dance, then a more offensive EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used. Stealth Rock is another option that gives Excadrill additional role compression as a hazard setter. Excadrill can struggle against physical walls such as Slowbro, Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Celesteela. Hydreigon, Latios, and the Thundurus formes can help deal with those defensive checks, and in return, Excadrill can check threats such as Mega Tyranitar and Bisharp for them. Excadrill can be forced out by faster threats such as Galarian Zapdos, Alakazam, Iron Moth, and Blacephalon; defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro and Tapu Fini can help manage them, and these also give Excadrill slow pivoting in Teleport and Misty Terrain, respectively. Other defensive pivots such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu can help deal with Ground- and Water-type checks such as Hippowdown, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini; however, run High Horsepower instead of Earthquake if pairing with Tapu Bulu due to Grassy Terrain cutting Earthquake's power in half.

Steel Beam allows Excadrill to go out while generating momentum for its teammates, as well as preventing common Defoggers such as Tapu Fini from clearing its Stealth Rock. Toxic is another option to cripple opposing hazard setters and Mega Sableye long-term. Focus Sash is an important item to ensure that Excadrill can reliably set Stealth Rock. Excadrill can struggle against threats such as Skarmory and Celesteela due to their Ground immunities; strong setup sweepers such as the Thundurus formes, Meteor Beam Celesteela, and Nihilego can pressure them for it.

Steelium Z lets Excadrill muscle through Pokemon like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, Tangrowth, and Buzzwole, while Normalium Z + Giga Impact dents Zapdos and Pelipper harder.

Jolly is the optimal nature for Excadrill to speed tie opposing Excadrill, though an Adamant nature can be used to maximize damage output. Excadrill requires sand to function, so Mega Tyranitar is mandatory. Mega Tyranitar can also handle Pokemon like Zapdos and Pursuit trap checks like Slowbro, as well as provide Stealth Rock to wear down Excadrill's checks. Pokemon that can handle physically defensive walls such as Tangrowth, Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Rotom-W for Excadrill, such as Zapdos and Tapu Lele, form solid offensive cores; it can deal with their checks like Gholdengo, Heatran, and Tyranitar in return. Excadrill is also susceptible to revenge killers like Mega Lopunny and Dragapult outside of sand, so switch-ins like Kingambit, Zamazenta, Ting-Lu, and Toxapex pair well with it.

Iron Head hits Ice- and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, Enamorus, and Galarian-Weezing, as well as Pokemon with Levitate such as Latias.

Poison Jab can be used to hit pesky Grass-type Pokemon that would otherwise be a major nuisance to Ground-type teams such as Ogerpon-W, Ogerpon-H, and Meowscarada.

It also provides Excadrill a safe switch via Eject Button. Hippowdon is also capable of taking on physically oriented threats such as Kingambit, Iron Hands, and Gouging Fire. Landorus-T and Gliscor are great teammates, as they can both switch into the Fighting- and Ground-type attacks that make quick work of Excadrill. Landorus is also capable of using Gravity to enable Excadrill's Earthquake to hit absolutely everything. Mamoswine is a great teammate to help Excadrill deal with Flying-type Pokemon that it cannot deal with, such as Gliscor and Corviknight. It also deals with Choice Scarf users and faster threats that Excadrill cannot outspeed when sand is not present, such as Dragapult, Enamorus, and Meowscarada, thanks to Ice Shard. Ursaluna-B is an incredibly threatening special wallbreaker that can deal with physically defensive Pokemon that Excadrill struggles to take on, such as Dondozo and Sableye. Excadrill pairs nicely with Swords Dance Garchomp, as Excadrill takes care of the Ice- and Fairy-types that would otherwise get in the way of Garchomp's sweep. Teammates that provide Water immunities, such as Storm Drain Gastrodon and Water Absorb Clodsire, are great teammates, as they can switch into threats that Excadrill cannot OHKO, such as Primarina, Urshifu-R, Keldeo, and Barraskewda.

Sleep Powder is an option to shut down checks such as Dragapult or scout for Tera types from Pokemon like Kingambit and Dondozo, which can be used as setup fodders or opportunities to give a free switch to an ally; this also allows Hisuian Lilligant to use Tera Fighting over Tera Fire for more power. Ice Spinner is another option, granting an OHKO on Flying-types that can absorb Hisuian Lilligant's STAB options such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and most Zapdos sets. Hazard support is invaluable in allowing boosted Solar Blade to OHKO Toxapex lacking Heavy-Duty Boots and Mega Scizor, making Great Tusk and Heatran good partners that also passively benefit from the sun. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant is vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster threats once the sun ends, so it appreciates a sturdy defensive core to back it up; Toxapex, Heatran, and Great Tusk can tank hits from and reliably check threats such as Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny once the sun goes down, while Landorus-T and Rotom-W are examples of pivots that can help bring Hisuian Lilligant in more easily.</p>"

        "Hustle Breaker": {
          "description": "<p>Hustle coupled with Victory Dance can be used to break common defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Great Tusk, Landorus, Kingambit, and Heatran; Hisuian Lilligant also outspeeds a good portion of the metagame after a Victory Dance boost, allowing it to threaten even common Choice Scarf users such as Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, and Gholdengo. Its main drawback lies in the decrease in accuracy, which makes it inconsistent and potentially easy to KO. Wide Lens can be used to circumvent this, as the accuracy boost will minimize the chances of a miss. Grassium Z can allow Hisuian Lilligant to dismantle defensive cores, letting it OHKO the likes of Toxapex , Landorus-T, and defensive Tornadus-T and heavily damage Zapdos after a Victory Dance and Stealth Rock damage to potentially open up a hole for another ally like Kartana or Volcarona to clean up. Victory Dance allows it to outpace most of the metagame and fire off powerful attacks. Tera Blast Ground allows Hisuian Lilligant to snipe Gholdengo and Skeledirge for super effective damage whilst also notably beating common Poison-types like Toxapex and Sneasler. Sleep Powder can be considered to shut down foes and set up more easily. Ice Spinner is also an option to beat common Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Icium Z is an option when running this, as it allows Hisuian Lilligant to score an OHKO on Gliscor, defensive Landorus-T, and defensive Garchomp whilst avoiding Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin chip from the latter two. Hisuian Lilligant has trouble setting up, as it is frail enough to be susceptible to the multitude of offensive Pokemon in the tier. Its inconsistent accuracy may also sometimes leave it open to attacks. Thus, dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko is beneficial, although it should be noted that the latter summons Electric Terrain, which nullifies Sleep Powder. Entry hazard support is important to score OHKOs on certain Pokemon; for example, Bloom Doom OHKOes Toxapex and Tornadus lacking Heavy-Duty Boots after Stealth Rock damage. As such, Garchomp and Ferrothorn are examples of good entry hazard setters. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant can still be defensively checked by Pokemon like Zapdos, if lacking Ice Spinner, Volcarona, and defensive Gholdengo; allies that can beat these checks include Volcarona and Mega Diancie.</p>"

Leaf Blade 2HKOes Toxapex at +1 and threatens Water's two Unaware Pokemon, Dondozo and Quagsire. Close Combat hits Ice- and Steel-types trying to switch into Hisuian Lilligant's Grass STAB move, as well as having a favorable roll to OHKO both Corviknight and Hisuian Goodra at +1. Finally, Ice Spinner hits Dragon- and Flying-types such as Dragonite and Thundurus-T, as well as Unaware Clodsire on Ground. Wide Lens is used to reduce the accuracy drop from Hustle. Sleep Powder can be run to give Hisuian Lilligant more setup opportunities, but the loss of coverage in Ice Spinner or STAB in Close Combat is notable.</p> <p>Great Tusk is a great teammate for Hisuian Lilligant, as it threatens out Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and the Poison-types that can stop a Hisuian Lilligant sweep. Great Tusk can soften up Hisuian Lilligant's checks by setting Stealth Rock. In return, Hisuian Lilligant uses Water-types such as Hisuian Samurott and Quagsire, which threaten Great Tusk, as setup opportunities. Iron Valiant can break through common checks to Hisuian Lilligant such as the aforementioned Skeledirge and Gholdengo thanks to either Shadow Ball on special sets or Knock Off on mixed ones. Sneasler is a secondary sweeper that can also threaten Fairy-types such as Enamorus-T. Its Choice Scarf set can also beat Volcarona, which can use Hisuian Lilligant as setup fodder, with Rock Slide and use Switcheroo to hinder defensive walls trying to switch in. Iron Hands uses its insane bulk, bolstered by Assault Vest, to sponge special attacks very easily from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Hatterene. It also hits Flying-types hard with its Electric STAB moves, and can pivot Hisuian Lilligant in with Volt Switch. In return, Hisuian Lilligant breaks the Ground-types that threaten both Iron Hands and Sneasler. Finally, Zamazenta takes physical attacks well with Dauntless Shield and can threaten Ghost-types that Hisuian Lilligant struggles to break with Crunch.

It can deal out considerable damage to some of the meta's bulkiest Pokemon such as Corviknight and Iron Hands and is the best wincon on Grass in order to beat Flying. Ice Spinner allows Hisuian Lilligant to threaten opposing Dragon- and Flying-types like Enamorus, Galarian Zapdos, and Dragapult, as well as opposing Ground-types like Clodsire and Great Tusk if it does not run Leaf Blade. Sleep Powder is often preferred over Leaf Blade to give Hisuian Lilligant an easier chance to set up, and the combination of Ice Spinner and Close Combat still targets a good portion of the metagame. However, Leaf Blade can be used to target Pokemon that resist Ice Spinner and Close Combat such as Toxapex and Azumarill. Wide Lens allows Hisuian Lilligant to offset the accuracy drop of its attacks due to Hustle and it also boosts the accuracy of Sleep Powder, making it a more consistent option to use in order to set up safely.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Meowscarada is a great teammate that threatens faster Dragon-types like Dragapult and Walking Wake, while Hisuian Lilligant is able to beat bulky Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra and Corviknight that Meowscarada often lures in. Amoonguss is Hisuian Lilligant's best defensive partner, as its Poison typing helps it deal with opposing Fairy-types like Azumarill, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant and also removes Toxic Spikes. Amoonguss appreciates Hisuian Lilligant's ability to dispatch opposing Flying-types like Corviknight, which can render it setup fodder, and can also assist Hisuian Lilligant's setup using Spore. Iron Leaves is another offensive partner for Hisuian Lilligant that can threaten opposing Poison-types which Lilligant cannot break through like Toxapex. Iron Leaves appreciates Hisuian Lilligant being able to threaten opposing Dark-type Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Kingambit. Brambleghast offers hazard support with Spikes, allowing Hisuian Lilligant to have secure KOs on Pokemon like Alolan Muk. Furthermore, Brambleghast offers hazard removal with Rapid Spin, which improves Hisuian Lilligant's longevity by giving it more opportunities to switch in. Zarude is also an offensive partner that is able to threaten Gholdengo and also Skeledirge, which gives Grass teams a tough time in the Ghost matchup. Furthermore, its ability to threaten Poison's defensive staples like Clodsire, Toxapex, and Alolan Muk after a boost is appreciated. Rotom-C helps Hisuian Lilligant threaten key members Water teams if it opts not to use Leaf Blade, like Pelipper and Basculegion, while Hisuian Lilligant can threaten Thundurus-T so Rotom can threaten Flying teams easier.</p>"

Tera Fight let it hit Pawniard and provides defensive value by flipping its Dark-type weakness, while Tera Ground additionally allows it to hit Alolan Grimer, Glimmet, and Tinkatink. Hex in combination with Will-O-Wisp's burns does massive damage to even bulkier foes like Mudbray and Toedscool while cleanly OHKOing Drifloon. Will-O-Wisp helps neutralize physical attackers like Pawniard and Crabrawler and can turn them into setup fodders for other sweepers. Knock Off lets Hisuian Zorua soften up opposing teams and is also its best option for hitting opposing Hisuian Zorua.

Hisuian Zorua is often competing with Drifloon for the team's Ghost-type, so it appreciates teammates like Wattrel and Toedscool that can cover for its lack of Ground-type immunity.

It also targets Steel-types like Excadrill. Fightinium Z serves the dual purpose of letting Hisuian Zoroark avoid having to rely on Focus Blast's shaky accuracy while giving it the power to OHKO foes like Hydreigon unboosted and Galarian Moltres at +2.

This Gothitelle set can come in on weak walls like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, Alomomola, and defensive Great Tusk and beat them by PP stalling them.</li> <li>Charm and Calm Mind are use to boost Gothitelle's survivability while PP stalling its foe.</li> <li>Taunt is used to stop phazing attempts and make the trapped Pokemon use their attacking PP, thus depleting their PP faster. Stored Power is an alternative for teams that benefit from having more wallbreaking potential or that have a good matchup against the Dark-types of the tier like Chien-Pao and Kingambit.</li> <li>The 24 Speed EVs allow Gothitelle to be faster than uninvested Corviknight, trapping it if it's not running U-turn. The Defense investment is used to tank hits well for PP stalling purposes, with attacks such as Ting-Lu's Earthquake being only a 4HKO.</li> <li>Tera Fairy is used for its solid defensive typing and ability to trap Choice-locked Dragon-types like Miraidon and Koraidon, Tera Water is an option for its overall great defensive typing, granting resistances to Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash, Koraidon's Flare Blitz, and Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump or Ice Beam. Lastly, Tera Ground is used to allow Gothitelle to trap Miraidon locked into an Electric move or defeat Double Dance sets one-on-one.</li> <li>Gothitelle's favorite partners are powerful sweepers and cleaners, especially setup sweepers that take advantage of defensive Pokemon having their PP drained to set up easily and without risk. Common examples include Swords Dance Koraidon, Swords Dance Chien-Pao, Double Dance Miraidon, and Calm Mind Flutter Mane.</li> </ul>"

Sawsbuck's great Speed also makes for decent speed control, getting the jump on many other Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F and Indeedee-F and setup sweepers such as Quiver Dance Masquerain. However, Sawsbuck can also be unreliable at times, only Speed tying with threats like Choice Scarf Haunter and Trailblaze Houndoom and being outsped by Choice Scarf Alolan Dugtrio and Dragon Dance Charizard. When not wanting to rely on Headbutt flinches, Double-Edge gives Sawsbuck a much stronger Normal STAB move that also helps make up for its average Attack and makes it a more reliable revenge killer. Tera Normal further strengthens Double-Edge, helps make up for Headbutt's low power, and allows Sawsbuck to better take attacks such as Haunter's Sludge Bomb and Pyroar's Fire Blast. Horn Leech gives Sawsbuck a secondary STAB move, hitting threats like Klawf, Whiscash, and Misdreavus harder while providing some longevity. Zen Headbutt OHKOes Haunter while also benefiting from Serene Grace and Stomping Tantrum is Sawsbuck's best coverage move for Steel-types such as Tinkatuff and Perrserker. However the last slot is somewhat flexible, with other options including Megahorn for Gogoat, Play Rough for Spiritomb, and Thunder Wave to benefit Headbutt later on.</p> <p>Alolan Persian and Tinkatuff both help to facilitate Sawsbuck as a late-game cleaner; the two of them can reliably spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, while the former can use Parting Shot to grant Sawsbuck safer field entry, and the latter can remove items with Knock Off to hinder the longevity of walls that rely on Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers as well as slow down faster Choice Scarf users like Basculin and Alolan Dugtrio. Dark-types like Skuntank and the previously mentioned Alolan Persian help with Ghost-types, making Sawsbuck's Headbutt much easier to spam. Skuntank's Toxic and Toxic Spikes also pair well with Sawsbuck's Headbutt flinches to wear down foes, with Skuntank also offering extra speed control in Sucker Punch and helping against Grass-types like Gogoat while Sawsbuck helps against Ground-types like Whiscash and Dugtrio. Normal-type teammates like Indeedee-F and Pyroar can also help against Ghost-types and other Normal checks, being able to overwhelm them and make them easier for Sawsbuck to pick off. Furthermore, special wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Basculin and Flapple can help break through defensive threats such as Hisuian Avalugg and Spiritomb. Finally, when deciding on coverage moves, teammates that can pick up sacrificed coverage are greatly appreciated, such as Alolan Dugtrio and Whiscash to check Steel-types and Charizard and Rotom-F to check Grass-types.</p>"

It can also absorb Toxic Spikes and switch in on Toxic, which is crucial for Grass teams. Foul Play lets Amoonguss turn the tables on Swords Dance users such as Scizor and Mimikyu as well as physically oriented Dragapult and Jirachi. Sludge Bomb allows Amoonguss to hit Spore-immune Pokemon and major threats such as Breloom, Meowscarada, and Iron Valiant. Finally, Spore allows Amoonguss to give its teammates, such as Torterra and Ogerpon-H, free turns to set up by putting foes to sleep. Rocky Helmet punishes contact moves such as Choice Scarf Sneasler's Dire Claw and stops the opponent from using U-turn for free on Amoonguss. Heavy-Duty Boots can be run if Brambleghast is not a teammate, as it allows Amoonguss to come in without worrying about entry hazard damage. The given EV spread allows Amoonguss to survive Choice Specs Greninja's Ice Beam so that it can be put to sleep by Spore while being as physically bulky as possible.</p> <p>Ogerpon-H appreciates being able to come in on sleeping foes and potentially win the game with Swords Dance. It also threatens Steel- and Ice-types, such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, Alolan Ninetales, and Articuno. In exchange, Amoonguss can not only put foes to sleep but also absorb Toxic Spikes and Toxic from walls such as Toxapex and take on revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Sneasler. Torterra is another setup sweeper that greatly appreciates Amoonguss removing Toxic Spikes and putting opposing Pokemon to sleep with Spore to create a free setup opportunity. In return, Torterra threatens opposing Poison- and Steel-types, such as Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo, that Amoonguss doesn't want to deal with. Hisuian Lilligant is another good partner for Amoonguss, as it appreciates being able to use Victory Dance on sleeping foes that would otherwise threaten it, such as Landorus, as well as fit a coverage move of choice over Sleep Powder. It also appreciates Amoonguss taking on the threats that it cannot handle even after a boost, such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Choice Scarf Sneasler. In return, Hisuian Lilligant can beat Gliscor and Dragonite on Flying teams thanks to Ice Spinner while hitting Steel-types such as Heatran that can threaten Amoonguss. Breloom can also beat opposing Steel-types thanks to its Fighting STAB moves, as well as tackle troublesome Dark-types such as Kingambit thanks to Mach Punch. Choice Scarf Meowscarada provides Grass teams with speed control, as well as hitting dangerous threats such as Chien-Pao, Hydreigon, Galarian Slowking, and Hoopa-U. It appreciates Amoonguss being able to switch in on Fairy-types like Clefable in return. Brambleghast can remove hazards to let Amoonguss run Rocky Helmet and switch in more safely. It can also set its own hazards thanks to Spikes, letting it compound on Amoonguss's Rocky Helmet chip damage. Finally, Brambeghast can switch into Hurricane from the likes of Zapdos and Tornadus-T, hit annoyances to Amoonguss, such as Hatterene and Gholdengo, with a strong Poltergeist, and revenge kill threats such as Flutter Mane with Shadow Sneak. Sinistcha serves as a reliable answer to threats such as Zamazenta that would otherwise use Amoonguss as setup fodder. Abomasnow provides Amoonguss with a nifty Ice neutrality, being able to take on Chien-Pao thanks to its defensive typing, snow's Defense boost, and Aurora Veil. Rillaboom provides Grassy Terrain for Amoonguss to help it recover without having to switch out or use a turn on Synthesis.</p>"

Growth lets Amoonguss threaten Ground teams by breaking through Water Absorb Clodsire after enough boosts. Alternatively, Toxic or Spore may be used to double Stomping Tantrum's power against Steel- and Poison-types like Gholdengo and Gengar that can pivot into Amoonguss and use it as setup fodder. Giga Drain and Synthesis provide Amoonguss with ample recovery to sustain itself in the Water and Ground matchups. A Relaxed nature is used to not dampen the power of Amoonguss's Stomping Tantrum, while Defense EVs are prioritized to help against physical Ground-types like Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Iron Treads.</p> <p>Toxapex forms an effective physically defensive Regenerator core alongside Amoonguss, as it deals with Fire- and Ice-types such as Paldean Tauros-F and Chien-Pao that give Amoonguss trouble while wearing down the opposing team with a combination of Toxic Spikes and Rocky Helmet. Skuntank deals with Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Espathra and Flutter Mane and uses Sucker Punch to pick off threats such as Dragapult late-game. It can also run Fire Spin to trap and forcibly remove Hatterene—a Pokemon that greatly threatens Amoonguss and prevents Skuntank from setting Toxic Spikes against Fairy and Psychic teams with ease. Unaware Clodsire is a specially defensive wall that deals with nearly all special attackers including Volcarona, Hydreigon, and non-Psyshock Flutter Mane. It also sets Spikes, which Amoonguss benefits from due to its ability to force switches, and is able to heavily damage Kingambit in a pinch. Glimmora provides entry hazard support by setting Stealth Rock and can use Toxic in combination with Corrosion to debilitate Steel- and Poison-types that Amoonguss hates such as Corviknight and Toxapex. It can remove entry hazards with Mortal Spin, which helps with Amoonguss's longevity in case its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed, and is also the primary way of dealing with Skeledirge. Iron Moth can don a Choice Scarf to deal with boosted threats such as Swords Dance Chien-Pao and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur, which shatter Poison teams, or run a Substitute set to better deal with Kingambit. Both Glimmora and Iron Moth can also run Air Balloon, which is greatly appreciated when up against Choice Specs Sandy Shocks or Choice Band Great Tusk, as these two have a good chance to overwhelm Amoonguss in the long run.</p>"

With its bulk, it can redirect and absorb various hits by using Rage Powder, as well as threatening to debilitate foes with Spore. Pollen Puff heals Amoonguss's ally even under the effects of Taunt, and Clear Smog negates attempts to set up against Amoonguss. Protect can be used over Clear Smog if Amoonguss's team has ample ways of beating setup Pokemon or does not have enough protection moves to share. Sitrus Berry is best for aiding in Amoonguss's longevity, allowing it to take more hits while redirecting attacks or spreading sleep. The EV spread allows it to survive two uses of Bleakwind Storm from Timid Tornadus with Sitrus Berry, and 28 Speed IVs allow it to underspeed base 50 Speed Pokemon with minimum investment such as Kingambit and Iron Hands. Unfortunately, Amoonguss struggles against opposing Grass-types and Gholdengo because of their immunity to Spore, so teammates like Heatran and Landorus-T are welcome to prevent Gholdengo from being on the battlefield. Amoonguss also struggles against Pokemon with Safety Goggles, so it appreciates Pokemon like Incineroar that can remove said item with Knock Off to help improve Spore's utility. Tera Water allows Amoonguss to resist Fire- and Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Incineroar while preserving its resistance against Water-type attacks, while Tera Dark gives it an immunity to Psychic-type attacks from Pokemon like Deoxys-A and provides an immunity to Prankster-boosted moves, most importantly Taunt from Tornadus.</p> <h1>Notable Partners</h1> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon or Pokemon With Prankster</strong>: While Amoonguss is very slow, Prankster Pokemon such as Tornadus and Grimmsnarl solve this issue by allowing themselves and Amoonguss to have a Prankster-boosted Spore. Fast Pokemon such as Chien-Pao also appreciate being able to use Spore against slower Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Other Defensive Utility Pokemon</strong>: Amoonguss is a good fit on bulkier teams thanks to giving its ally Regenerator and Clear Smog. Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Incineroar appreciate Amoonguss's ability to give them Regenerator, greatly increasing their longevity, and in return, they give Amoonguss more utility moves in order to be less passive.</p> <p><strong>Setup Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Iron Hands and Gholdengo appreciate Amoonguss's ability to redirect attacks so they can set up safely. Furthermore, Swords Dance Ogerpon-H has Mold Breaker, giving Amoonguss the ability to use Spore on Gholdengo.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room Setters</strong>: Trick Room setters like Diancie or Porygon2 allow Amoonguss's poor Speed stat to shine, giving themselves and Amoonguss the chance to use Spore on both of the opposing Pokemon.

Regenerator allows Amoonguss to check those same threats long-term; it also prevents it from being worn down by pivots like Rotom-W and Tapu Koko as well as entry hazards if its Heavy-Duty Boots is removed via Knock Off. Spore incapacitates switch-ins such as Heatran, Volcarona, and Dragapult; the latter two would otherwise use it as setup fodder, while the former completely walls Amoonguss by being immune to Sludge Bomb. Sludge Bomb spreads status against the aforementioned Volcarona and Dragapult as well as bulkier switch-ins like Skeledirge and Tornadus-T and threatens Iron Valiant. Hidden Power Fire lets Amoonguss chip Poison-immune foes like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor as well as OHKO Kartana, preventing them from safely switching in. Heavy-Duty Boots lets it switch in as much as needed without fear of entry hazard damage; it also prevents Regenerator recovery from being stifled in longer games. Rocky Helmet is an alternative that wears down contact attackers like Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T as well as the aforementioned rain wallbreakers in Barraskewda and Floatzel. It should only be used if entry hazard control is decent enough, however, with support from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Rotom-W. Tera Water provides invaluable resistances against Fire and Ice, letting Amoonguss potentially get an emergency Sludge Bomb or Spore in against foes like Weavile and Heatran. Tera Steel is an alternative that lets Amoonguss emergency check offensive foes like Tapu Lele while also giving it a better matchup against non-Heat Wave Tornadus-T; it also retains the Ice resistance given by Tera Water. Rotom-W is an excellent partner, as it stifles offensive and defensive Pokemon alike that Amoonguss struggles with, such as Heatran, Skeledirge, and Tornadus-T. In return, Amoonguss takes pressure off Rotom-W as a check to rain wallbreakers and can deal with Rotom-W switch-ins like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth. Gholdengo completely counters Amoonguss by virtue of its immunity to Spore and it taking negligible damage from Hidden Power Fire; as such, checks to it such as Kingambit and Poison Jab Clodsire are recommended, with the latter forcing Gholdengo to Terastallize so it can freely fish for poison.</p>"

Heavy-Duty Boots is the standard item for Alomomola; however if a team lacks a way to punish contact moves and has sufficient hazard removal, then Rocky Helmet should be considered. Tera Dragon allows Alomomola to check Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Koko missing Dazzling Gleam, while Tera Fairy improves its matchup against Choice Band Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny, and Tera Poison provides a Toxic immunity and checks Iron Valiant. Common Pokemon unhindered by Toxic use Alomomola as setup fodder, such as Gliscor, Substitute variants of Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor. Rocky Helmet users such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory can punish the use of Flip Turn, along with Water Absorb Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W and some Clodsire variants can prevent the move from having any effect. Spikes, in conjunction with Knock Off from users like Mega Scizor, Hisuian Samurott, and Ferrothorn can also be extremely lethal to Alomomola. Knock Off can be used to cripple Pokemon that heavily rely on Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers, such as Zapdos, opposing Alomomola, Heatran, and Landorus-T, or Scald to threaten Kartana and Mega Scizor; but it should be noted that not using Toxic gives free setup turns to dangerous foes like Volcarona and Calm Mind Iron Valiant. Running a Sassy nature allows Alomomola to check Mega Diancie, while a Relaxed nature helps Alomomola pivot around Great Tusk. Teammates such as Ting-Lu and Heatran both take great advantage of Alomomola's support and can help shore up some of Alomomola's weaknesses, checking Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Volcarona, while more offensive partners like Zapdos and Gouging Fire can cover some of these weaknesses while also offsetting Alomomola's passivity, the former answering Kartana, and Zamazenta while the latter helps with Tapu Koko and Zapdos.</p>"

If you have good entry hazard removal and need more damage against threats, then Rocky Helmet is the best choice. Leftovers is useful when you have good hazard removal but can also inflict good damage with your teammates; it also prevents some 2HKOs, for example from Choice Band Chien-Pao's Crunch. Without good hazard removal, Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred choice.</li> <li>Run a Relaxed nature with Play Rough, or if you have Chilling Water + Whirlpool and wish to sacrifice some Speed for full Whirlpool damage.

It's an incredible asset for Grass teams, as it can manage notable threats such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Melmetal. Gyro Ball capitalizes on its low Speed and threatens Fairy-types and fast foes like Alolan Ninetales and Tapu Lele. However, Iron Head provides more consistent damage against slower foes like Hatterene and is less susceptible to PP stalling, which is particularly useful against Kyurem if Ferrothorn isn't running Body Press. Depending on its teammates, Ferrothorn can opt for Stealth Rock or Spikes, as Cradily can also set up Stealth Rock, while Meowscarada has access to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. With the combination of Leech Seed and Leftovers, Ferrothorn gains substantial recovery each turn, enabling it to wear down and punish switch-ins such as Heatran, Aegislash, and Nidoking. Protect serves as a scouting tool and extends the benefits of Leech Seed and Leftovers, while Body Press allows Ferrothorn to utilize its high Defense and deal significant damage to Steel- and Dark-types, like Melmetal and Weavile. When in conjunction with Gyro Ball, Body Press ensures that Substitute Kyurem won't be able to PP stall Ferrothorn, and when used with Iron Head, it guarantees an OHKO against Weavile. The featured EV spread both prevents a 2HKO from Choice Band Weavile's Icicle Crash and lets Ferrothorn almost always beat SubRoost Kyurem.</p> <p>Ferrothorn forms a formidable defensive core with Mega Venusaur, as the latter's typing and ability enable it to come in on Fighting- and Ice-types such as Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Galarian Darmanitan. Additionally, Mega Venusaur's Sludge Bomb can poison foes, allowing Ferrothorn's combination of Leech Seed and Protect to wear them down more quickly. Cradily is another valuable partner, providing natural special bulk and a favorable matchup against Blacephalon and Nidoking. Offensive partners such as Rillaboom, Meowscarada, Iron Leaves, and Zarude greatly appreciate Ferrothorn weakening the opposing team with entry hazards and Leech Seed. In return, Rillaboom sets up Grassy Terrain for additional recovery and provides strong priority damage, while Choice Scarf Meowscarada can revenge kill threats such as boosted Kommo-o. Whimsicott and Celebi handle Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant and Kommo-o, which would otherwise pose a threat to Ferrothorn. Whimsicott also punishes setup sweepers like Volcarona or Mega Scizor, which could otherwise use Ferrothorn as setup fodder, while Celebi helps ease the Poison matchup, as well as the Steel matchup in a pinch.</p>"

Discharge is prefered over Thunderbolt due to the increased paralysis chance. Giga Drain threatens Sandaconda while providing some recovery. Dragon Tail phazes foes, pairing well with Spikes support from the likes of Qwilfish and Cacturne, and keeps Tera Ground Quiver Dance users such as Oricorio and Vivillon in check despite their Discharge immunity. Drain Punch is an alternative that still allows Eelektross to defeat Tera Ground Quiver Dance users while hitting common special attackers like Zoroark and Pyroar super effectively.

U-turn capitalizes on the switches Mienfoo forces and generates offensive momentum while synergizing with Regenerator recovery to keep Mienfoo healthy. Fake Out is useful priority that can wear down opposing sweepers and Choice Scarf users and chip foes into KO range. Taunt is another option that lets Mienfoo block Foongus's Spore and prevent setup. Maximum Speed is preferred to outrun major threats like Vullaby and Hisuian Growlithe.

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its typing and access to Sucker Punch, Swords Dance Bisharp cements itself as a powerful wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. Knock Off offers high damage output and item removal, which can aid in chipping down checks that rely on their item, such as Leftovers Iron Hands. Sucker Punch offers valuable priority to revenge kill faster threats such as Latios and Alakazam, and, after a boost, Bisharp can thwart revenge killing attempts from faster Pokemon like Zeraora and Thundurus-T. Iron Head is a great complementary STAB move for Fairy-types such as Enamorus and Clefable, which otherwise resist Dark-type attacks, while being Bisharp's best neutral option versus Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Buzzwole. An Adamant nature enables Bisharp to threaten an OHKO on Clefable with minimal chip damage. Maximum Speed investment is needed to outspeed Mega Tyranitar, Celesteela, and Scizor and to Speed tie with opposing Bisharp. Swords Dance Bisharp works best on offensive teams with teammates such as Iron Hands and Swords Dance Scizor that put pressure on shared checks such as defensive Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Buzzwole. Similarly, Bisharp pairs well with special attackers like Thundurus-T and Latios by pressuring specially defensive walls such as Blissey for them. Bisharp struggles to break through bulky Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Okidogi, making partners like Slowbro, Clefable, and Mega Latias beneficial. Future Sight support from Slowbro and Slowking aids Bisharp in whittling down the latter two in range for a boosted Knock Off or Iron Head. Bisharp is an excellent partner for entry hazard setters such as Mew and Excadrill, as Defiant deters Defog from Pokemon like Tapu Fini. In return, Bisharp appreciates hazards chipping down switch-ins like Iron Hands and Leftovers Hippowdon. Similarly, Ribombee appreciates Bisharp pressuring common Defoggers like Tapu Fini. In exchange, Sticky Web from Ribombee enables Bisharp to outspeed and significantly damage Pokemon that otherwise outspeed it, such as Excadrill and Keldeo.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Bisharp acts as an offensive answer to common Psychic- and Ghost-types in the tier, such as Alakazam, Blacephalon and Latios, through the combination of Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Knock Off provides strong, super effective damage to targets that may not switch out immediately, including Mega Latias, Skeledirge, and Slowbro, while removing items from walls like Heavy-Duty Boots from Buzzwole and Amoonguss. Sucker Punch provides valuable priority to pick off frail or weakened faster Pokemon such as Alakazam, Latios, and Hisuian Zoroark. Iron Head is a valuable option to hit Fairy-types like Enamorus and Clefable super effectively and Pokemon like Buzzwole and Tapu Fini neutrally. Investing 184 EVs into Speed enables Bisharp to outspeed fully invested offensive Celesteela prior to Autotomize and Tyranitar. Fighting-types like Okidogi, Galarian Zapdos, Buzzwole, and Mega Heracross benefit immensely from Bisharp trapping Ghost- and Psychic-types, and they also appreciate it wearing down defensive Fairy-types like Tapu Fini. Bisharp can also benefit defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth by picking off frail wallbreakers such as Iron Moth and Alakazam. Pursuit Bisharp has a noticeable weakness to bulky physical walls in the tier such as Buzzwole, Hippowdon and Skarmory, so pairing it with sufficient offensive pressure from Enamorus, Mega Latias, Iron Moth, and Galarian Zapdos to take advantage of these foes is appreciated. Without Swords Dance, Bisharp enables offensive Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Iron Hands, Okidogi, and Hawlucha to switch in with relative impunity. Bulky Fighting-resistant partners like Mega Latias, Slowbro, Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Mega Venusaur can help pivot into these offensive threats. Finally, Bisharp can find a place on balanced hazard stack teams alongside Skarmory or Gastrodon. It can dissuade Defog via Defiant and threaten chip damage on Defoggers like Tapu Fini with its STAB moves.</p>"

Roost gives Braviary reliable recovery and helps it heal off recoil it takes from using Brave Bird as well as giving it more opportunities to use Substitute. Substitute can take advantage of Pokemon such as Appletun and Lurantis while also allowing Braviary to avoid status from Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Sandaconda, and Umbreon. Tera Dark allows Braviary to stop Prankster from Sableye, allowing it to take advantage of it via a Substitute or Bulk Up. Alternatively, Tera Ground gives Braviary a more favorable matchup versus Electric-type Pokemon like Rotom and Eelektross as well as a Rock resistance; (SC) however, the resulting Grass weakness means it can no longer switch in on Lurantis and Appletun as freely. Tera Fighting can be used with Close Combat over Substitute for more overall power and the ability to take down Flying-type answers like Magneton while also gaining a resistance to Rock-type moves, but doing so makes Braviary vulnerable to status moves.</p> <p>Braviary struggles with faster threats with super effective coverage, often forcing it to Terastalize. As a result, specially defensive walls such as Blissey, Eelektross, and Umbreon pair well with it, with the former being notable for supporting Braviary with Wish, as Braviary will not be able to Roost easily due to its average Speed and large number of checks. Physically defensive walls such as Sandaconda and Sableye can also be useful to check Pokemon such as Tauros, Paldean Tauros, and Bombirdier. Pokemon with access to status moves such as Sableye if you are not running Tera Dark and Qwilfish if you are not running Substitute can also be troublesome for Braviary, so status absorbers such as Blissey and Hisuian Qwilfish can help with this problem. Braviary also dislikes Rocky Helmet users such as Sandaconda and Qwilfish, as the recoil can add up with Brave Bird over time. To deal with this, item disruption from Trick and Knock Off on Pokemon like Rotom, Sableye, and Samurott is ideal.</p>"

U-turn helps keep momentum going and damage common switch-ins like Ting-Lu and Iron Boulder. Close Combat can be used instead of U-turn to check Steel-, Rock-, and Normal-types like Excadrill, Kingambit, Tyranitar, and Blissey. Doing so, however, means that Braviary would lack the momentum it gets from U-turn, which is crucial for Normal teams. The EVs above allow Braviary to outspeed Adamant Azumarill while also comfortably taking attacks from Garchomp and Ogerpon-H. The given EVs also let Braviary survive an Icicle Crash from unboosted Chien-Pao when Braviary is at full HP.</p> <p>Blissey is a great teammate, as it can tank special hits from Choice Specs users like Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Kyurem while also being able to set up Stealth Rock and spread paralysis with Thunder Wave. Braviary returns the favor by dealing with Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos and Great Tusk for Blissey. Porygon2 is a nice defensive wall when paired with Braviary, being able to wall Ice-types like Baxcalibur and Mamoswine and stop setup users like Scizor, Gouging Fire, and Ceruledge with Foul Play. Calm Mind Ursaluna-B is a great teammate thanks to its Electric immunity and ability to break defensive walls like Zapdos, Toxapex, Clodsire, and Archaludon.

Choice Scarf Indeedee is another option, which provides more support in the Fighting and Poison matchups due to its part-Psychic typing and ability to set up Psychic Terrain for the team. Indeedee can also blast away threats, such as Zamazenta, mixed offense Iron Valiant, and Clodsire,in Terrain with Expanding Force.

It is one of the best checks to Gholdengo and also pairs well with it, forming a fundamentally powerful core when used with Tailwind support from Murkrow. Armarouge and Garchomp also synergize well with Hydreigon, covering for Steel-types, which it may not be able to damage effectively depending on its Tera type. Hydreigon can, however, struggle against damage reduction such as Snarl and Light Screen, with the latter coming especially from Grimmsnarl, which can easily take its STAB moves and OHKO it back with Spirit Break if Hydreigon is not Terastallized. Repeated usage of Draco Meteor can also make Hydreigon deal unimpressive amounts of damage, but this can be counteracted with Haze from Murkrow, allowing it to continue dealing devastating damage.</p> </li> </ul>",

Tera Dark further boosts Hydreigon’s power, allowing its Dark Pulse to reliably 2HKO the likes of Toxapex and Heatran. Hydreigon fits best on bulky offense and offense teams that have reliable options to switch it in safely. Hydreigon pairs very well with pivots such as Mega Lopunny, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T, as they can switch it in against opposing defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W.

Optionally, Fiery Dance can be used over Flamethrower, which has an additional effect of boosting Special Attack, but Flamethrower is preferred due to a higher Base Power.

Bug Buzz can be used over Psychic to hit Dark- and Psychic-types such as Hydreigon, Ting-Lu, and Espathra. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Volcarona safe from entry hazards, while Flame Body debilitates physical attackers.

          "description": "<p>A potent offensive presence, Volcarona's access to Quiver Dance provides the backbone to its sweeping capabilities. Bug Buzz is Volcarona's main attacking option and can be combined with Swarm to increase damage as Volcarona loses HP while setting up, allowing Volcarona to OHKO checks like offensive Garchomp after one Quiver Dance. Psychic is essential, as it allows Volcarona to hit one of Fire's strongest checks, Toxapex, but also super effectively damages Poison-types and Fighting-types such as Glimmora and Quaquaval. The last slot is interchangeable, though generally Flamethrower is preferred as a STAB move that can also take advantage of sun support on Fire teams and is essential to for the Flying matchup, allowing it to hit Corviknight and Kilowattrel. Giga Drain can be used to give Volcarona a better chance of breaking through Water and Ground teams and give it a recovery option. Similarly, Morning Sun gives Volcarona more setup opportunities. Flame Body can also be used to threaten burns on Pokemon such as Kingambit and Dragonite, which oftentimes revenge kill Volcarona. Given its all-around solid defensive stats, Volcarona finds a myriad of opportunities to set up and takes advantage of the maximum Speed spread given to capitalize on the boosts as much as possible, outspeeding Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk or Choice Scarf Dragapult after one or two Quiver Dance boosts, respectively.</p> <p>Generally, Volcarona is best saved for mid- to late-game, when the opposing team has been chipped down and Volcarona has an opportunity to sweep after setting up. Utilizing its offensive teammates such as Scovillain, Ceruledge, Cinderace, and Paldean Tauros-F to slowly chip down defensive walls such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Blissey provides better opportunity for Volcarona to sweep later in the game. Paldean Tauros-F is specifically useful with its ability to remove dual screens, preventing Volcarona's setup from being hindered. Rotom-H also provides excellent support, aiding in the Water matchup if Giga Drain is not used and providing pivot support to switch Volcarona in. Skeledirge and Talonflame provide defensive support to wear down offensive threats such as Dragonite. Torkoal providing sun support on Fire aids Volcarona, not only increasing Flamethrower's damage output, but giving Volcarona the opportunity to survive attacks like Choice Specs Greninja's Surf, giving it an opportunity to set up.</p>"

Rillaboom also provides it with Grassy Terrain recovery, which can make Volcarona extremely hard to bring down.</p> </li> <li> <p>Volcarona struggles against Fire-type physical attackers like Incineroar, Entei, and Terastallized Ogerpon-H, which wall it and threaten it for massive damage without the fear of being burned. Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W also force a Terastallization, though they can be handled if Volcarona sets up enough Quiver Dances.</p> </li> </ul>",

Giga Drain chunks bulky Water-types like Swampert and Manaphy, while Psychic provides neutral coverage against foes that resist Fire- and Bug-type moves like Primordial Sea Zapdos and Ceruledge, and Bug Buzz acts as a more reliable secondary STAB move, sniping targets like Walking Wake and RegenVest Meloetta. While Sheer Force grants Volcarona stupefying levels of power, notably threatening an OHKO with Psychic against Zapdos, Turboblaze lets it melt Well-Baked Body Steel-types like Corviknight and Gholdengo into liquid metal. Life Orb is the preferred item, since Volcarona wants as much power as possible; however, Heavy-Duty Boots improves its longevity by allowing it to come in multiple times in a game without fear of being worn down by entry hazards. Teammates that appreciate Volcarona's wallbreaking capabilities like Walking Wake and Tail Glow Manaphy should be paired with it to clean up late-game. Offensive Bulk Up Great Tusk is an excellent partner for Volcarona on hyper offensive teams, notably clearing hazards that impede Volcarona's wallbreaking ability. Dual screens setters like Corviknight and Deoxys-S are great partners for Volcarona, allowing it to safely set up with Quiver Dance and survive a hit in a pinch. Revenge killers like Dragonite, Choice Band Barraskewda, and non-Dragon's Maw Choice Scarf Walking Wake threaten Volcarona, so having a teammate that can use them as setup fodder like Cresselia or Dragon Dance Roaring Moon is recommended.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Volcarona makes great use of Quiver Dance and its solid defensive profile, checking Pokemon like Weavile, Meowscarada, and Iron Valiant, and it combines them with its decent longevity bolstered by Morning Sun to force switches and gain free opportunities to set up and sweep. The occasional Special Attack raises provided by Fiery Dance can add to Volcarona’s boosts and increase its sweeping potential, while Flamethrower is a more consistent and powerful alternative with more PP to assist in the long run. Tera Blast can be used as a surprise coverage move after Terastillizing but can also be used as a neutral move before Terastillizing for Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Gouging Fire. Tera Dragon gives Volcarona several powerful resistances, such as to Water, which helps against Barraskewda and rain, and Fire, which helps against Cinderace and opposing Volcarona; it also gives it a Tera Blast that hits most Pokemon neutrally and threatens Dragon-types like Kyurem, Dragonite, and Gouging Fire. Tera Fairy, in addition to being a solid defensive typing that also threatens Dragon-types, gives Volcarona a Dragon immunity to avoid attacks from Dragapult and Raging Bolt and resist Sucker Punch from Kingambit, as well as a way to solidly damage Ting-Lu. Tera Water is a powerful defensive option that gives Volcarona a threatening attack against the likes of Heatran and opposing Volcarona and a strong matchup against rain teams. Alternative Tera options are Ground, to improve Volcarona's matchup against Fire-types like Heatran and Poison-types like Clodsire, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking and give it an immunity to Thunder Wave, and Grass, which is strong against bulky Water-types like Primarina and Hisuian Samurott. This set should run Giga Drain instead of Tera Blast for added longevity. Heavy-Duty Boots is a must-have for Volcarona to cover for its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. 152 Speed EVs allow Volcarona to outspeed Great Tusk and Gholdengo as well as Zamazenta and Dragapult after a boost from Quiver Dance, while the remaining EVs are invested into HP and Defense to make Volcarona bulky enough to survive attacks from Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Enamorus, and Meowscarada that it otherwise couldn’t.</p> <p>Volcarona’s ability to set up and sweep is always useful for helping teams make progress, but bulky Volcarona specifically is able to help its team by checking physical attackers throughout the game. Flame Body can cripple attackers like Kingambit and Dragonite on the switch in and can force them out from fear of being burned. This opens up teammates like Kyurem and Walking Wake to play more aggressively. Entry hazard setters like Glimmora and Great Tusk also appreciate Volcarona's ability to threaten Pokemon that try to use Rapid Spin with a burn. Dual screen setters like Deoxys-S and Alolan Ninetales are able to boost Volcarona's defenses significantly, giving it more opportunities to set up and sweep. Volcarona is also useful on sun teams, supporting Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Walking Wake with boosted Fire-type attacks as well as helping defensively against rain teams with Tera Water and picking off Deoxys-S and Iron Valiant with a sun-boosted Flamethrower. Volcarona is unable to make progress against special walls like Clodsire and Blissey; a Pokemon like Gholdengo are able to assist with Psyshock and immunity to moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave. Powerful physical cleaners like Weavile and Choice Band Meowscara are also useful for this purpose and synergize well with Volcarona. Other Unaware walls like Dondozo are also unaffected by Volcarona’s sweeping potential; wearing these threats down with hazards from Pokemon like Gliscor and Hisuian Samurott is extremely important in helping Volcarona sweep late-game. Weavile, Hisuian Samurott, and Meowscarda also help against Dondozo with Knock Off, discarding its Heavy-Duty Boots so that it can be worn down by entry hazards. Galarian Slowking is particularly difficult for Volcarona to deal with, especially if it's running Tera Fairy; powerful Pokemon that match up well against it like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Dragonite are important to chip it down and force it out.</p>"

In addition to being one of very few special attacking options on Bug, Volcarona helps apply pressure in a variety of matchups thanks to its strong STAB moves and coverage. Fire Blast can be used over Fiery Dance for more immediate damage output. Giga Drain deals with Water- and Ground-types, most notably Swampert, Gastrodon, and Rotom-Wash. Bug Buzz can be used instead for Volcarona to overwhelm types like Dragon, Dark, and Psychic with Quiver Dance-boosted STAB attacks. Hidden Power Ground hits Heatran, allowing Volcarona to break Steel's immunity-based defensive core that can otherwise give Bug teams problems. Alternatively, Psychic can be used to damage bulky Poison-types, like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, that can wall physical attackers like Heracross and Buzzwole. These physical attackers, in addition to Lokix and Scizor, are able to break through specially defensive walls, like Chansey and Mantine, that Volcarona struggles against. Araquanid and Armaldo provide helpful entry hazards in Sticky Web and Stealth Rock, respectively, to make sweeping mid- or late-game much easier.</p>"

Psychic allows Volcarona to pressure Fighting and Poison teams, especially after one Quiver Dance, which lets Volcarona outspeed and beat Keldeo, Glimmora, and Crobat. Similarly, Giga Drain does the same to Water and Ground teams after one Quiver Dance, threatening Tapu Fini, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Bug Buzz covers the Psychic and Dark matchups very well and allows it to hit Roaring Moon, Ting-Lu, and Latias, which would otherwise be a challenge to deal with. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Volcarona from being worn down by entry hazards, most notably Stealth Rock, which would otherwise stop Volcarona from being able to set up safely. Psychium Z lets Volcarona OHKO Toxapex with a +1 Shattered Psyche and beat otherwise troublesome threats like +1 Kommo-o, Iron Hands, and Clodsire. Cinderace and Mega Charizard X are especially good partners due to their ability to break through special walls such as Blissey, Clodsire, and Galarian Slowking with relative ease. Entry hazard removers such as Torkoal, Rotom-H, and Court Change Cinderace are near necessities if Volcarona is running Psychium Z. Torkoal and Rotom-H can also provide excellent utility in the form of Stealth Rock and dual screens, respectively, to help Volcarona sweep more easily. Volcanion is also an excellent partner for Volcarona that, thanks to its Water immunity, can act as a strong pivot into Pokemon like Azumarill and Mantine, which could revenge kill it or clear Quiver Dance boosts with Haze.</p>"

Flamethrower is Volcarona's Fire-type STAB move of choice thanks to its decent Base Power and consistent damage output, although Fire Blast can be used for the extra power, allowing Volcarona to notably have a very high chance to OHKO defensive Landorus-T and Tapu Lele after Stealth Rock and OHKO Gliscor after one Quiver Dance, while Flamethrower cannot. Giga Drain provides good coverage alongside Volcarona's Fire STAB move, allowing it to hit Water-types such as Alomomola and potentially forcing them to Terastallize. Finally, Hidden Power Ground allows Volcarona to hit unexpecting Heatran, which would otherwise be a hard counter to this set. Flame Body allows it to punish careless contact moves from Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, non-Protective Pads Meowscarada, and Mega Scizor. Tera Grass powers up Giga Drain while turning Volcarona's Water weakness into a resistance, allowing it to safely take on threats such as Ogerpon-W and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. Alternatively, Tera Ground allows Volcarona to dodge revenge killing attempts from the likes of Iron Boulder while powering up Hidden Power Ground to let it potentially OHKO Gouging Fire at +1. Due to Volcarona's high threat level, common attempts to check it involve using Terastallization on a defensive Pokemon, such as Heatran or Alomomola; as such, partners like Raging Bolt and Kyurem appreciate Volcarona forcing those Pokemon to Terastallize. Grass-types like Serperior are also great partners, as they can bait in Heatran for Volcarona while being able to switch in situationally on Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R that threaten it out. Serperior can also force progress with Glare on threats like Gouging Fire or setting up with Leaf Storm while chipping checks like Raging Bolt.

Hidden Power Ground is an alternative to hit foes like Heatran, Garganacl, Mega Diancie, and Raging Bolt. Giga Drain can be paired with Tera Grass to provide coverage against Rock-types like Garganacl and Mega Diancie, as well as Water-types like Ogerpon-W, Alomomola, and Mega Swampert, and it helps to keep Volcarona healthy without sacking momentum to use Roost. Roost makes sure that Volcarona can check foes like Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny in the long run and win the 1v1 against Tapu Lele and Darkrai without being chipped severely. Tera Grass gives Giga Drain a STAB boost and removes Volcarona's weakness to Water-types, which can be useful against offensive threats like Ogerpon-W and rain. Tera Steel allows Volcarona to turn walls relying on Toxic to make progress into its setup fodder, examples of which are Alomomola and Blissey. It also provides Volcarona with better matchups against the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Mega Diancie. The above EVs make sure that Volcarona can survive the damage from Stealth Rock twice and outspeed Zamazenta at +1. Teammates like Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W can lure in walls like Ferrothorn and provide Volcarona with great opportunities to set up. They can also handle specially defensive foes like Heatran and Galarian Slowking for Volcarona when it's not equipped with Hidden Power Ground. Since it heavily relies on Heavy-Duty Boots to prevent entry hazard damage, Volcarona appreciates teammates like Gliscor and Mega Tyranitar to absorb Knock Off from foes like Landorus-T. It also benefits from teammates like Ferrothorn and Landorus-T checking Dragonite. Great Tusk and Landorus-T can relieve Volcarona of pressure from Stealth Rock by using Rapid Spin and Defog respectively when Volcarona loses its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

Close Combat provides coverage against Steel-, Normal-, and Dark-types such as Heatran, Mega Lopunny, and Greninja. Earthquake does heavy damage against Electric-types such as Zeraora and Tapu Koko as well as against Poison-types like Toxapex and Clodsire. Poison Jab is able to pressure Grass- and Fairy-types that Rock teams struggle to deal with, being able to OHKO Tapu Bulu and Whimsicott as well as deal high amounts of damage to Azumarill and Tapu Lele. Choice Scarf allows Terrakion to be an amazing revenge killer, outspeeding threats like Mega Lopunny and Zeraora. Terrakion pairs well with Shuckle, as its Stealth Rock and Sticky Web support allows Terrakion to net more KOs and outspeed faster Pokemon like Regieleki, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and Adamant Barraskewda under rain. Terrakion also pairs well with Mega Diancie, which softens the likes of Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Toxapex for Terrakion thanks to its coverage. Alolan Golem helps Terrakion with the Steel matchup by trapping Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Celesteela with its ability Magnet Pull. Nihilego is able to help with the Fairy matchup with Sludge Wave dealing big damage to Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Clefable. Tyranitar helps Terrakion by setting up sand, which boosts Terrakion's Special Defense stat, allowing it to survive Surf from Choice Scarf Greninja and Dazzling Gleam from Tapu Koko.

Focus Blast grants Tornadus-T excellent neutral coverage and is able to hit most Steel- and Rock-types, like Heatran and Tyranitar, hard. Heat Wave, however, has the benefit of nailing Jirachi, Gholdengo, and Corviknight, which makes it a better option against Psychic, Ghost, and, if using Knock Off, Steel teams. In the last slot, Taunt is preferred, so Tornadus-T can safely set up on walls like Toxapex and Ting-Lu, but Knock Off's ability to cripple the likes of defensive Heatran and Galarian Slowking is worth considering. Tornadus-T has a very poor matchup against Electric-types, so Pokemon that can deal with them, such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, are must-haves. They're also able to lay down Stealth Rock and have access to Defog, making them incredible teammates. Similarly, Corviknight and Celesteela stomach most Ice-type attacks aimed at Tornadus-T, thanks to their bulk and Steel typing. Mega Charizard Y forms a terrifying wallbreaking duo alongside Tornadus-T that breaks down shared checks such as Heatran and Blissey. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite and Agility Thundurus-T greatly appreciate Tornadus-T weakening or removing walls for them. 88 HP and 8 Special Defense EVs can be used over Special Attack to ensure Tornadus-T lives an Ice Beam from Choice Scarf Greninja from full health.</p>"

Thunderbolt helps against the plethora of bulky Water- and Flying-types, 2HKOing Celesteela, Tapu Fini, and Slowbro. It can also threaten 2HKOs on bulky foes like Magic Guard Clefable and Mega Sableye at +2. Focus Blast helps against the tier's numerous Dark- and Steel-types, OHKOing Tyranitar and Excadrill and having good odds to OHKO Hydreigon and Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Ice hits Dragon-types that resist Thunderbolt, 2HKOing Latios, Mega Altaria, and unboosted Mega Latias at +2, its also more spammable against Grass-types than Focus Blast and can hit Pokemon like Amoonguss super effectively. Psychic is an alternative that helps against Poison- and Fighting-types, 2HKOing foes like Choice Band Iron Hands, Amoonguss, and Buzzwole. Fightinium Z can provide Thundurus a way to OHKO targets like Mega Tyranitar, help break through neutral targets like Gastrodon, and bypass Focus Blast's accuracy. Thundurus can have a hard time breaking through specially defensive Pokemon, notably Mega Latias, which can set up on it even if Thundurus uses Nasty Plot, as well as Tapu Bulu and Mega Venusaur when lacking Hidden Power Ice or Psychic; it pairs well with other offensive Pokemon like Hydreigon and Iron Moth that can threaten these foes. In return, Thundurus can help to deal with their checks like bulky Scizor, Tapu Fini, and Iron Hands. Thundurus can pair well with pivots like Victini, which can bring it in against Water-types it threatens like Tapu Fini as well as help against Pokemon that wall it like Mega Venusaur. Due to Thundurus's Stealth Rock weakness that can make it harder for it sweep, hazard removers like Tapu Fini, Excadrill, and Hydreigon make for good teammates. Thundurus can also pair well with entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Mega Tyranitar, and Skarmory, which can help it to guarantee an OHKO on foes like Hydreigon and Tyranitar. In return, Thundurus can threaten out common hazard removal options like Tapu Fini and Excadrill, and it can even set up on some of them like Tapu Fini. Thundurus is very prone to getting revenge killed by faster foes like Mega Aerodactyl, Alakazam, and Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos, so it pairs well with bulky partners like Slowbro, Celesteela, and Clefable.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Landorus is a ferocious wallbreaker on Ground teams, as it boasts great stats, a destructive ability, and a wide array of coverage moves, making it a crucial Pokemon to have in the Dark and Fairy matchups. Landorus's preferred ability, Sheer Force, in conjunction with Life Orb raises its offensive potency to great heights, allowing it to 2HKO nearly every wall in the metagame, including Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Corviknight with Focus Blast. Sludge Bomb hits Grass-types like Rotom-C and Breloom as well as easing the Fairy matchup alongside Iron Treads and Clodsire, while Psychic threatens Urshifu-R and Air Balloon Glimmora and pops Gholdengo's Air Balloon, as Landorus is walled by it otherwise. Nasty Plot renders Landorus completely unwallable, notably letting it OHKO Corviknight. Alternatively, Rock Slide can be used to catch Volcarona, Zapdos, and Frosmoth off guard; however, it forces Landorus to use the suboptimal Naive nature and should only be used if teammates don't have answers for the listed targets. Substitute is a great option on Landorus because of the amount of switches it forces as well as making Kingambit's Sucker Punch easier to outplay.</p> <p>Landorus appreciates Water Absorb Clodsire and Storm Drain Gastrodon switching into Water-type Pokemon like Barraskewda, Walking Wake, and Basculegion-F. Choice Scarf Great Tusk threatens Pokemon with Ice-type coverage like Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Greninja. Iron Treads provides support in the Fairy matchup and provides pivoting with Volt Switch, luring switch-ins like Corviknight and Volcarona for Landorus to take advantage of. Furthermore, Iron Treads removes Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin and enhances Landorus's wallbreaking with Knock Off, removing recovery items like Leftovers and Black Sludge from Rotom-W and Amoonguss. Additionally, Choice Scarf Iron Treads is a great asset in the Fairy matchup and threatens Ice-types like Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Sandy Shocks is a great teammate in the Flying and Water matchups, providing Gravity support and additional pivoting with Volt Switch. Quagsire is able to check Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur as well as providing entry hazards and chip damage with Toxic. Ting-Lu provides entry hazards and phazing to wear down the opponent's team for Landorus and appreciates the removal of Fighting-types. Ursaluna can switch into Ghost-type moves from faster opponents like Dragapult, Flutter Mane, and Hisuian Zoroark as well as aiding in heavily denting teams alongside Landorus. In return, Landorus provides a Fighting-type resistance and threatens Fighting-types with Psychic.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Access to Sheer Force, a variety of coverage moves, and a phenomenal Speed tier thanks to Choice Scarf make Landorus an elite revenge killer on Ground teams, taking out Choice Specs Greninja and all Ogerpon formes after entry hazard damage. Focus Blast tears apart Dark-types and Ground-immune Steel-type Pokemon such as Chien-Pao, Hydreigon, and Orthworm. Psychic makes the Fighting matchup a lot easier, OHKOing Great Tusk, Urshifu-R, and Iron Valiant, as well as taking out Galarian Weezing after Stealth Rock damage, making the Poison matchup extremely one sided. Sludge Bomb aids in the Fairy matchup, OHKOing Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Azumarill, and helps greatly against Grass-type Pokemon that Ground-type teams would otherwise struggle to break, taking out prominent threats such as Breloom and Hisuian Lilligant. U-turn is a great pivot option for Landorus, gaining momentum by scaring out Pokemon it threatens while inflicting damage on the replacement and getting switch initiative.</p> <p>Landorus cowers in fear at the thought of a single snowflake, which is why Quagsire is a great teammate for it. Quagsire is able to stand up to terrifying Ice-type move users such as Swords Dance Chien-Pao, Swords Dance Urshifu-R, Azumarill without Trailblaze, and Baxcalibur, as well as providing entry hazard support via Spikes and Stealth Rock and spreading Toxic to soften foes up for Landorus. Iron Treads forms a wonderful core with Landorus as well, switching in on foes that attack with Ice-type moves, such as Articuno, Frosmoth, and Alolan Ninetales, and hitting back with a very powerful Heavy Slam or Iron Head. Iron Treads can also remove Stealth Rock via Rapid Spin and remove items via Knock Off, increasing Landorus's longevity and wallbreaking capabilities. Ice Spinner is also an option to take out opposing Landorus and Gliscor. In turn, Landorus can switch into a weakened Ogerpon-H as well as Ground- and Fighting-type attacks that would make quick work of Iron Treads. Landorus also appreciates Pokemon such as Water Absorb Clodsire and Storm Drain Gastrodon, as they can switch in to Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Walking Wake, Barraskewda, and Basculegion-F. Clodsire is a very good special wall, while Gastrodon takes neutral damage from Ice Beam as well as walling Choice Scarf Greninja and providing a myriad of hazard support. Both Ursaluna and Ursaluna-B complement Landorus nicely, as they are able to switch into Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon that Landorus would otherwise struggle against, such as Flutter Mane and Air Balloon Gholdengo. Ursaluna-B is also capable of picking off weakened Dark-type Pokemon such as Kingambit, Greninja, and Chien-Pao with Vacuum Wave. In turn, Landorus can switch in on the Fighting-type attacks that would trouble Ursaluna and Ursaluna-B, and threatening the foe with Psychic. Gliscor is another great teammate for Landorus, as it is able to whittle down opponents via Knock Off and Toxic. Mamoswine is able to take down the Flying-type Pokemon that Landorus would otherwise be ineffective against and can also make use of its Thick Fat ability to tank some additional Ice-type moves. Sandy Shocks not only can set hazards but also can pivot around with Volt Switch, allowing Landorus to come in on an easy target.</p>"

Sludge Wave hits Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Celebi as well as other Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Clefable, easing the Fairy and Grass matchups due to unresisted coverage. Focus Blast breaks through Kyurem, Ting-Lu, and Ferrothorn. Rock Polish enables Landorus as a late-game cleaner, shutting down revenge killing abilities from faster foes like Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and Greninja, while Nasty Plot allows Landorus to easily break past the likes of Blissey and Mega Sableye and become terrifying with Gravity-aided Earth Power spam. Rock Slide is another option to hit Volcarona, as it is dangerous once set up, as well as Mantine, Zapdos, and Araquanid; however, using it is very situational and forces Landorus to use an unpreferred nature. Gravity allows Landorus to ease the Flying and Steel matchups and easily spam Earth Power, increasing its potential to new heights and also supporting its teammates like Choice Band Sand Rush Excadrill. Gastrodon is a great teammate due to its ability to soak up Water-type moves from foes like Barraskewda and Mega Swampert, while Gastrodon appreciates Landorus's ability to threaten Grass-types with Sludge Wave. Mamoswine is heavily valued as a sponge for Ice-type moves due to its ability Thick Fat, taking on SubRoost Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales. In return, Mamoswine cleans up Flying teams once Landorus deals with Celesteela, Corviknight, or Skarmory. Choice Scarf or Bulk Up Great Tusk forms a great wallbreaking core, taking out threats like Triple Axel Mega Lopunny and Dragonite, while also appreciating Gravity support. Clodsire provides entry hazards to chip down walls for Landorus, switches into revenge killers like Meowscarada and Tapu Koko, and counters Volcarona with Unaware so Landorus doesn't need to use Rock Slide. Mega Steelix is valued in the Ice and Fairy matchups, taking on Alolan Ninetales, Tapu Koko, Azumarill, and Weavile.

Notable examples include Raging Bolt, Iron Hands, Incineroar, and Entei.</p> </li> <li> <p>Some popular Landorus-T checks include Chien-Pao and Latias, which are able to OHKO it with Ice-type attacks.

Flutter Mane is able to check both Chien-Pao and Latias, while Intimidate ensures that Flutter Mane survives an attack from opposing Chien-Pao, despite its lacking physical bulk.

Tera Water removes Landorus-T's weakness against Water-types like Urshifu-R, Mega Swampert, and Hisuian Samurott, as well as common Ice-type moves like Ice Beam from Darkrai and Ice Shard from Weavile, and also gives Landorus-T a chance to revenge kill Volcarona. The given EVs make sure that Landorus-T outspeeds Zamazenta and survives a Choice Specs Moonblast from Iron Valiant and two Zen Headbutt from Mega Medicham after Stealth Rock. Teammates like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Darkrai appreciate Landorus-T for bringing them in safely via U-turn. In return, they can threaten walls like Alomomola and Gliscor for Landorus-T. Landorus-T can be worn down quickly due to Stealth Rock and its lack of recovery, so teammates like Alomomola and Ferrothorn are helpful to protect it from being overwhelmed too quickly by foes like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny, both of which can also check Water-types like Mega Swampert for Landorus-T. Additionally, Alomomola can heal Landorus-T with Wish and form a pivoting core with it. Other pivots like Rotom-W and Iron Crown bring in Landorus-T safely and form VoltTurn cores with it.</p>"

It can run Taunt to shut down any entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn, Ting-Lu, and opposing Landorus-T or deny Defog from the likes of Zapdos and Gliscor. Explosion lets Landorus-T deal massive damage once its job is done, being able to take a good chunk of damage out of almost any foe while also denying hazard removal from the aforementioned Defoggers and Rapid Spin from Great Tusk. Tera Ghost prevents any hazards on the field from being removed by Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk if it's unable to safely use Explosion on it. Ogerpon-W is great offensive partner, as it’s able to come in on Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R which threatens Landorus-T. Volcarona is another solid teammate that’s able to switch into Weavile’s Triple Axel and has a chance to burn it in the process.</p>"}

Rock Tomb and Sludge Bomb are used to whittle down Earth Eater Fire-types like Skeledirge and defensive Fairy-types like Scream Tail, respectively, with Rock Tomb being able to heavily damage Zapdos.

It differentiates itself from Garchomp as a Fire-type answer with its immunity to Will-O-Wisp as well as access to U-turn and Smack Down, allowing it to generate momentum and pressure Corviknight and other Flying-types. It can further capitalize on this added offensive presence with Swords Dance, especially if it has activated Well-Baked Body beforehand. Alternatively, running Hammer Arm over Smack Down allows it to still beat Earth Eater Heatran by itself and potentially hit Earth Eater Iron Treads hard on the switch. As a Fire-type answer, it makes a fantastic partner for Corviknight, which also appreciates its Fighting resistance to help against Pokemon like Slither Wing and in turn can handle many strong wallbreakers such as Roaring Moon and Chien-Pao that Landorus-T lacks the bulk and recovery to answer. Landorus-T also benefits RegenVest Pokemon such as Hisuian Goodra and Meloetta by preventing them from getting overwhelmed by strong Fire-type attacks and, in the case of Hisuian Goodra, helping against Ground-types such as Sandy Shocks and Landorus, while in return they handle the many special attackers in the tier. Water-immune partners, such as Desolate Land Heatran and Ceruledge, make good teammates for Landorus-T as well.

U-turn takes advantage of the switches Landorus-T forces, allowing it to pivot out of walls that come in on it such as Corviknight and Mega Venusaur. Similarly, Knock Off cripples some of the bulky Pokemon it invites in, like Porygon2 and Ferrothorn, by removing their items. Stone Edge notably hits Kyurem the hardest and is Landorus-T's best move versus Flying-types like Zapdos and Pelipper. Alternatively, Explosion lets Landorus-T score a surprise KO against an offensive threat it normally cannot OHKO, such as Keldeo or Mega Lopunny. Special wallbreakers like Galarian Moltres, Tornadus-T, and Mega Charizard Y are great partners to deal with the aforementioned physical walls Landorus-T draws in.

Freeze Dry helps Kyurem in dealing with bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Dondozo, and common Tera Water users such as Gliscor and Galarian Slowking. Earth Power finds itself in the last slot, allowing Kyurem to hit Galarian Slowking hard as well as Pokemon that resist its STAB moves, examples being Heatran, Kingambit, and Gholdengo. Tera Ice provides the most amount of damage possible to its Ice-type STAB moves, which can potentially OHKO naturally high specially defensive behemoths like Clodsire and Toxapex with Ice Beam and Freeze Dry, respectively, as well as 2HKO offensive Gholdengo and Kingambit with Ice Beam. Meanwhile, Tera Ground can be used to boost up Earth Power, having a chance to OHKO bulky variants of Kingambit and Gholdengo, as well as provide a Rock resistance, which lets it take on Stealth Rock and the dangerous Iron Boulder's Mighty Cleave more easily. Finally, Tera Fairy provides Kyurem with an immunity to Dragon-type attacks such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and opposing Kyurem's Draco Meteor, coupled with a newfound Fighting resistance against moves like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta's Close Combat and Corviknight and Skarmory's Body Press.</p> <p>Kyurem often founds itself in bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to destroy common walls. While Kyurem's typing is amazing offensively, defensively it makes Kyurem hard to switch in due to its numerous weaknesses combined with its average Speed tier. To solve this, pair Kyurem with pivot users; Kyurem's best friend is Galarian Slowking, which brings Kyurem in safely and provides snow with Chilly Reception as well as switch into Fairy-types like Enamorus and Iron Valiant. Kyurem needs entry hazard removal to not get worn down quickly by hazard-stacking teams; therefore, Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Excadrill are great partners. Corviknight can take Fairy- and Dragon-type moves, clear out hazards with Defog, and provides a slow U-turn to get Kyurem in safely. Additionally, Cinderace can use Court Change to use the hazards against the opposing team and can also lure in and pivot out of checks such as Toxapex and Gliscor with U-turn for Kyurem. Hatterene is also a good partner for Kyurem, which can deflect hazards with Magic Bounce, slow down faster threats with Nuzzle, and give Kyurem a second chance at wallbreaking with Healing Wish. Physical attackers like Meowscarada can be used to scare away common special walls thanks to its crippling STAB Knock Off to make Kyurem's attacks more impactful. Another strong physical attacker is Kingambit, which threaten some of Kyurem's checks like Galarian Slowking, Clodsire, and specially defensive Clefable. In return, Kyurem can break past their defensive checks such as Skarmory, Dondozo, and Great Tusk. Gholdengo makes for an amazing partner, as it can switch into super effective moves aimed at Kyurem and threaten Galarian Slowking and Fairy-types with its STAB moves; in return, Kyurem beats Unaware Clodsire for it. Kyurem can take advantage of hazard-stacking teams to be even harder to wall, so common hazard setters like Skarmory, Ting Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Gliscor can be helpful, with the latter two having Knock Off on their arsenal as well to cripple Kyurem's defensive checks.</p>"

Both Ice Beam and Freeze-Dry are fantastic STAB options, with the raw power of Ice Beam supplemented by Freeze-Dry's super effective coverage into bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo. Earth Power is a great coverage move that allows Kyurem to hit common switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Heatran, and Draco Meteor rounds out the set with a powerful nuke that tears through neutral targets like Darkrai, Deoxys-S, and Terastallized Ting-Lu while securing a notable OHKO on Gouging Fire. Scale Shot is a weaker alternative that boosts Kyurem's Speed to patch up its middling Speed tier and thwart revenge killing attempts by otherwise faster Pokemon such as Dragapult and Zamazenta. It also targets special walls like Blissey on their frailer Defense and hits Volcarona hard to prevent it from using Kyurem as setup fodder. A Naive nature is selected for a mixed set with Scale Shot in order to still survive Iron Boulder's Mighty Cleave from full HP. A Hasty nature can also be considered for a better matchup into Volcarona and to avoid an OHKO from Iron Valiant's Moonblast. Tera Ice synergizes with Kyurem's double Ice-type STAB attacks to blast holes through teams, allowing it to 2HKO both physically defensive Clefable and Corviknight with Ice Beam. Tera Ground can be used instead to change Kyurem's defensive profile entirely while giving it a STAB boost to Earth Power, securing crucial 2HKOs on both Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge along with dropping offensive Gholdengo in a single hit. Additionally, both Tera types drop Kyurem's weaknesses to Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult and Enamorus, with Tera Ground also removing its Fighting- and Rock-type weaknesses to block revenge killing attempts from Zamazenta and Iron Boulder.</p> <p>Kyurem is a perfect fit for entry hazard-stacking teams that opt to neglect removal in favor of putting hazards up on both sides, as Heavy-Duty Boots allows Kyurem to switch in freely, and its lack of power from no boosting item is made up for by switch-ins being forced to take chip damage on entry. Good defensive hazard setters that pair well with Kyurem include Skarmory and Gliscor with their Steel- and Fighting-type resistances, respectively. Faster teammates are also appreciated to help cover for Kyurem's mediocre Speed, with fast Knock Off users such as Meowscarada and Weavile being great picks for balance teams and Iron Boulder as a good pairing on more offensive builds. Another partner that works particularly well is Knock Off Clefable, which switches into Dragon- and Fighting-type attacks from Dragapult and Zamazenta and invites in Kyurem's defensive checks like Galarian Slowking, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Air Balloon Heatran to remove their items, making them more susceptible to chip damage and allowing Kyurem to hit the latter two with Earth Power. Galarian Slowking itself is a bulky pivot that has great synergy with Kyurem, as it stifles revenge killing attempts with Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from checks like Iron Valiant and Enamorus, and it can not only can bring in Kyurem freely with Chilly Reception but also sets up snow to make it significantly harder to revenge kill. Offensively, Kyurem pairs well with threats that can force in walls weak to it such as Gliscor, Skarmory, and Great Tusk, making Kingambit a natural partner.</p>"

        "Dragon Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Kyurem is an effective setup sweeper with great bulk and two strong physical STAB moves in Loaded Dice-boosted Icicle Spear and Scale Shot, capable of outspeeding would-be revenge killers such as Dragapult and Booster Energy Great Tusk after a single boost. Tera Blast is primarily used on sets that Terastallize into a Ground-type, giving Kyurem the coveted near-unresisted Ice + Ground STAB combination. This allows Kyurem to break past otherwise troubling Pokemon like Gholdengo and Kingambit. Substitute is an alternative option that relies less on Terastallization, allowing Kyurem to dodge status moves and to scout potential switches or Terastallization. Tera Fairy is a more defensive choice, trading its Dragon and Fighting weaknesses for an immunity and a resistance, allowing Kyurem to safely take a hit from Pokemon like Dragapult and Iron Valiant to OHKO them back with Icicle Spear. Tera Steel enables Kyurem to easily take moves like Make It Rain from Gholdengo and Mighty Cleave from Iron Boulder while being able to avoid Toxic from the likes of Toxapex.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Kyurem is best used on offensive teams that appreciate a strong physical setup sweeper that can muscle past the bulky Ground- and Dragon-types of the tier. It is one of the few setup sweepers that immediately threatens Gliscor and provides a way for hyper offense to resist the priority from Raging Bolt and KO it. Kyurem wants a teammate to provide some form of entry hazard control like Great Tusk, as Kyurem is weak to Stealth Rock and needs Loaded Dice to output consistent damage. It appreciates the support of Spikes from setters like Deoxys-S and Hisuian Samurott, as most of its checks are bulky grounded Pokemon. For example, one layer of Spikes allows Kyurem to OHKO maximum HP Great Tusk and offensive Zamazenta without an Intrepid Shield boost at +1 and +2, respectively. Kyurem greatly enjoys snow from Alolan Ninetales's Snow Warning, as the Defense boost helps greatly in positioning Kyurem to get the free turns that it needs. Alolan Ninetales can also set up Aurora Veil to further ease Kyurem's setup. Bulky Steel-types like Heatran, Kingambit, and Gholdengo all give Kyurem trouble unless it is Tera Ground and willing to commit the Tera, so teammates like Tera Ground Volcarona and Knock Off Iron Valiant help to pressure these foes. Bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Primarina can also consistently beat Kyurem one-on-one, so offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Meowscarada can be used to threaten them out. These also provide tools like Grassy Terrain to keep Kyurem healthy as it sets up and Knock Off to remove defensive items from Pokemon like Corviknight and Zamazenta. Other strong physical attackers like Gouging Fire can help to force in and wear down the Water-types that Kyurem struggles with. Very fast offensive Pokemon like Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Iron Valiant can outspeed even a +1 Kyurem and threaten huge damage with their super effective STAB moves. Because of this, Kyurem appreciates Pokemon like Gholdengo that can take hits from those fast threats and continue to apply offensive pressure.</p>"

        "Old Man Winter [Choice Specs] (Ice)": {
          "description": "<p>Kyurem's high offensive stats, access to Freeze-Dry, and surprisingly solid defensive profile make it an unparalleled special wallbreaker for Ice teams, with its resistances and coverage letting it pull its weight against Fire and Water teams by giving it good matchups against the likes of Ogerpon-H and Dondozo among others. STAB Draco Meteor is already a fearsome tool for Kyurem to wield unboosted, but with Choice Specs equipped, it becomes downright nuclear, OHKOing common neutral targets such as Archaludon, Slowbro, and Ursaluna-B. Ice Beam is the default secondary STAB move for its reliability, giving Kyurem an extremely strong attack that's also spammable; it importantly deals massive neutral damage to many common Draco Meteor switch-ins, securing 2HKOs on Clefable, Hatterene, Corviknight, and Galarian Weezing. Blizzard is a stronger alternative to Ice Beam that achieves incredible damage benchmarks, securing a guaranteed OHKO on Clodsire and 2HKO on Hisuian Goodra after Stealth Rock, two feats that Ice Beam never achieves; however, Blizzard relies on snow being active to be consistent, forcing Kyurem's snow-setting teammate to either run Icy Rock or play far more conservatively than they would otherwise. Freeze-Dry is arguably the most important tool in Kyurem's arsenal, letting it carry the Water matchup on its back by undermining would-be checks like Primarina, Toxapex, and Tentacruel and scoring harder hits on otherwise neutral targets like Quagsire, Rotom-W, and Dondozo. Earth Power rounds out Kyurem's moveset nicely by giving it coverage for the Steel-types that resist its STAB combination, notably OHKOing Kingambit and Metagross after Stealth Rock while handily 2HKOing dedicated walls like Empoleon and non-Choice Scarf Jirachi. Earth Power also scores a super effective hit on bulky Poison-types like Alolan Muk, which can give Kyurem a hard time otherwise. A Timid nature is an absolute requirement on Kyurem, since its crowded Speed tier would leave a Modest variant outsped by common threats to it such as Baxcalibur, Glimmora, Excadrill, and non-Choice Scarf Great Tusk, among others.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales is a crucial partner for Kyurem, enabling Blizzard spam and boosting its bulk to ludicrous proportions with snow and Aurora Veil; Kyurem becomes so staggeringly bulky in these conditions that a revenge killing tool as strong as Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch will not even 2HKO it after Stealth Rock. Alolan Ninetales's part-Fairy typing is also useful for discouraging Dragon-type revenge killers like Latios, Dragapult, and Walking Wake with Moonblast. Since Kyurem cannot use Heavy-Duty Boots on this set, it must rely on entry hazard removal to maintain its longevity; Alolan Sandslash is a standout choice here thanks to Rapid Spin and its secondary Steel typing, allowing it to switch into common revenge killers like Iron Boulder, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane, as well as threatening Rock- and Fairy-type attackers with its STAB moves. Slush Rush also lets it provide speed control that Kyurem needs to help against threats like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao. Mamoswine brings Stealth Rock to make Kyurem even harder to switch into, Ice Shard to help with speed control, and an Earthquake that shakes most Steel-types and special walls into Kyurem's KO range or out of the game altogether, notably OHKOing Gholdengo, Klefki, and Hisuian Goodra after Stealth Rock. Froslass can provide further entry hazard support with Spikes, speed control with Thunder Wave, and spinblocking utility while also switching into Fighting-type attacks for Kyurem, and Destiny Bond lets it trade with a problematic target such as Ogerpon-H. Baxcalibur shares Kyurem's typing and thus shares its defensive weaknesses, but it's also a formidable physical sweeping threat that enjoys Kyurem's ability to pressure bulky Water-types with Freeze-Dry and hammer other physical walls like Archaludon and Galarian Weezing. In exchange, Baxcalibur can blow past special walls that give Kyurem trouble like Blissey, Articuno, and Galarian Slowking. Chien-Pao is another strong physical attacker that also threatens Gholdengo and boasts an amazing Speed tier, letting it clean up weakened teams with a Choice Band or Swords Dance set after Kyurem has weakened them; Chien-Pao also loves Kyurem's ability to threaten Primarina and Azumarill with Freeze-Dry. Weavile is similar to Chien-Pao and contributes a powerful Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots or Eviolite from certain walls that rely on them such as Articuno and Porygon2, respectively. Avalugg is another hazard removal option that provides a much sturdier fallback against physical revenge killers compared to Alolan Sandslash and serves as a secondary wincon with an IronPress set, but this comes at the cost of being agonizingly slow and useless against most Fairy-types.</p>"

Freeze-Dry is highly effective in the Water matchup by answering would-be checks like Swampert, Gastrodon, and Slowking. Focus Blast catches Ferrothorn and Tyranitar off guard should they expect a STAB move, while Earth Power hits Alolan Muk, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran for more damage. Mega Altaria is heavily appreciated as an answer to Dragon-types like Kommo-o, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. Garchomp provides entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes to ease Kyurem's wallbreaking. Latias checks Fighting-types such as Iron Hands, Galarian Zapdos, and Terrakion, is able to replenish Kyurem's health with Healing Wish, and removes troublesome entry hazards—especially Stealth Rock, given Kyurem's Rock weakness—with Defog.

Moreover, it shrugs a hit from and beats the likes of Galarian Zapdos and Urshifu-R one-on-one if using a Chople Berry. Freeze-Dry lands a strong hit on Water-types like Toxapex and Gastrodon, turning Kyurem into a valuable asset in that matchup. Alongside it, Earth Power grants Kyurem near-perfect neutral coverage by nailing Steel- and Fire-types such as Magnezone and Skeledirge. The given EV spread allows Kyurem's Substitute to live one Seismic Toss from Blissey. Alolan Ninetales provides Snow and Aurora Veil support, bolstering Kyurem's defensive utility while preventing Celesteela and Heatran from breaking its Substitute. Defensive Cloyster is able to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, set up Spikes to help Kyurem stallbreak more easily, and switch into physical Steel-type attacks from Mega Scizor and Melmetal. Similarly, Piloswine lays down Stealth Rock and deals with Fire- and Rock-types that Kyurem loses to, such as Volcarona and Mega Diancie.

V-create threatens to OHKO Steel-types like Mega Steelix, which can otherwise scout Kyurem-B's move choice and heal off about half of the damage with Regenerator. U-turn offers dangerous teammates like Mega Mewtwo X a safe window to switch in if Kyurem-B can't secure a KO, and it can be used early-game to scout for potential Fur Coat switch-ins. Kyurem-B fits best on balance teams that can grant it opportunities through pivoting and can make room for counterplay against the few things it can't instantly get past, such as Arceus-Poison. Kyurem-B's lack of recovery and weakness to Rock mean Stone Axe is a major pain, so multiple entry hazard removers like Miraidon, Mega Steelix, and Primal Kyogre are recommended; the latter two also function as slow pivots, which Kyurem-B also appreciates. Fur Coat Arceus formes not weak to Kyurem-B's attacks, such as Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Fairy, also aren't afraid of it when healthy; as a result, it appreciates an ally that can block their Strength Sap, such as a Magic Bounce user like Mega Audino, significantly cutting into their longevity. A faster offensive teammate like Mega Mewtwo X or Deoxys-A is recommended to clean weakened teams, as Kyurem-B's poor Speed inhibits it in this regard.

Physical attackers like Roaring Moon and Chien-Pao naturally threaten Meloetta out, so Pokemon that can deal with them, like Corviknight, Great Tusk, and defensive Quaquaval, make for good partners. Lastly, Meloetta appreciates entry hazard removal from the likes of Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Mandibuzz, to keep its HP high enough to switch into strong attackers.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Battle Bond Greninja is an extremely powerful cleaner thanks to its great STAB moves, wonderful coverage, and solid Special Attack and excellent Speed, which are boosted to astronomical levels the first time it KOes an enemy. After Battle Bond activates, Greninja can outpace threats that are already considered very fast, including Choice Scarfers like Enamorus and Sneasler and Booster Energy users like Iron Valiant, Walking Wake, and Iron Moth. Hydro Pump is extremely powerful, always OHKOing uninvested Kingambit after Battle Bond activates and having a significant chance to OHKO it with just Tera Water while at worst 2HKOing much of the tier with both Battle Bond and Tera Water active, but Surf is a more consistent alternative; Greninja will need to rely more on entry hazard support to secure OHKOs against threats like the aforementioned Kingambit, but it is still more than capable of OHKOing many offensive threats with Battle Bond and Tera Water active. Grass Knot rounds out Greninja's coverage by OHKOing Tera Water Garganacl and opposing Greninja with Battle Bond active, having a high chance to OHKO Hisuian Samurott after Stealth Rock even without Battle Bond active, and 2HKOing Dondozo. Water Shuriken can pick off weakened faster threats like +1 Iron Valiant, Unburden Sneasler, Choice Scarf Enamorus, and +1 Great Tusk, and in a pinch it can act as insurance against greatly weakened threats like Dragapult. With a Modest nature and rain support from Pelipper, it also OHKOes Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock with a Battle Bond Boost as long as it hits at least three times, which makes up for the loss in Speed from foregoing a Timid nature. Water Shuriken also helps deal with Kingambit's Sucker Punch, which can otherwise greatly threaten Greninja if it has been weakened or shed its Dark resistance with Tera Water. Ice Beam, on the other hand, reliably handles Water-resistant threats like Dragonite, Amoonguss, Rillaboom, Meowscarada, and Tera Grass Galarian Slowking.</p> <p>Battle Bond Greninja greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Hisuian Samurott to wear threats down over the course of a game; for instance, enabling it to KO Kingambit with Tera Water Surf and take out Amoonguss more easily once Battle Bond is already active. Moreover, the chip damage from entry hazards can help wear down faster threats like Booster Energy Iron Valiant Choice Scarf Enamorus, putting them into Water Shuriken range. In that vein, Gholdengo is another excellent teammate due to its ability to prevent hazard removal; it can also use its powerful STAB moves alongside Choice Specs or a Nasty Plot boost to wallbreak and wear down the opposing team, allowing Greninja to finish the job. Other powerful offensive threats like Iron Valiant and especially Kingambit greatly appreciate Battle Bond Greninja's ability to break past various threats like Corviknight, Dondozo, Great Tusk, Heatran, and Landorus-T to assist their late-game sweeps; in return, they can help weaken threats like Walking Wake and Dragonite. Kingambit in particular can handle threats like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Terastallized Galarian Slowking, which Greninja may struggle to muscle past. Lastly, Battle Bond Greninja is a natural fit on rain teams, as the boost from Pelipper's Drizzle alongside a Modest nature, Tera Water, and Battle Bond allows Greninja's Hydro Pump to accomplish ludicrous feats such as outright OHKOing specially defensive pivot Galarian Slowking, OHKOing Roaring Moon after Stealth Rock, and even 2HKOing Assault Vest Toxapex more reliably. Basculegion is another rain staple that synergizes well with Greninja, as one can weaken their shared checks like Rotom-W and Walking Wake to enable the other's sweep. Lastly, Zapdos offers rain teams an effective means of dealing with Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Tera Water Galarian Slowking, ensuring that Greninja doesn't have to waste precious turns attacking them and getting worn down by their attacks alongside Life Orb recoil.</p>"

          "outdated": true,
          "description": "<p>When equipped with Choice Specs, Greninja becomes a potent wallbreaker thanks to its great coverage and Protean. Since Choice Specs ensures it only uses one attack per switch-in, even though Protean only activates once per switch-in, Greninja will have STAB every time it attacks. Hydro Pump is Greninja's most powerful move, pummeling both offensive and defensive Water-weak Pokemon like Cinderace, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk. Dark Pulse hits the likes of Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Hisuian Zoroark super effectively while also dealing the most damage to Toxapex and Rotom-W. Dark Pulse's flinch chance can also come in clutch against the aforementioned walls. Ice Beam eviscerates Amoonguss, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Dragon-types like Dragonite and Roaring Moon. Grass Knot can OHKO Dondozo, Garganacl, and Walking Wake after minor chip damage, and it deals good damage to lighter Water-types like Quaquaval and Azumarill. Alternatively, Spikes lets Greninja wear down checks like Toxapex while taking advantage of the switches it often forces. In addition, Greninja also beats common entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Corviknight, making Spikes easy to maintain. Tera Water further enhances Greninja's already powerful Hydro Pump to extreme levels, letting it OHKO Pokemon like Corviknight, Hatterene, and Unaware Clodsire. Meanwhile, Tera Dark lets Greninja 2HKO Toxapex and Rotom-W with Dark Pulse.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams as a menacing wallbreaker. Stealth Rock setters like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Glimmora are amazing for Spikes Greninja, as it can create a hazard-stacking core with them. Alternatively, these Pokemon can also let Greninja drop Spikes for Grass Knot, as they can set up hazards and Grass Knot overwhelming Dondozo and Walking Wake. Strong offensive Pokemon like Kingambit and mixed Iron Valiant make for excellent partners, as Greninja threatens their checks like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Garchomp for the former, and Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Clodsire for the latter. They can also threaten Pokemon that would otherwise revenge kill Greninja, such as Dragapult and Meowscarada, granting Greninja more consistency against teams with these Pokemon.</p>"

          "outdated": true,
          "description": "<p>Greninja is an excellent dedicated lead due to its high Speed tier alongside Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and valuable utility options. It differentiates itself from Meowscarada due to its better matchup against other leads as well as entry hazard setters and removers such as Glimmora, Iron Treads, Garchomp, Toxic Spikes Iron Moth, and Court Change Cinderace. Taunt has various applications; it blocks Amoonguss's Spore, prevents entry hazards from the likes of Ting-Lu and leads like Glimmora and Iron Treads, stops Defog from Corviknight, and prevents setup from Pokemon Roaring Moon, Kingambit, and Tera Water Garganacl that attempt to exploit Greninja's relative passivity. Greninja can choose to run Toxic Spikes to punish offensive teams filled with setup sweepers like Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant better, but Ice Beam OHKOes Garchomp and dents Water-resistant Pokemon like Dragonite, Meowscarada, Dragapult, Tera Grass Glimmora, and Water Absorb Clodsire, especially if its Focus Sash is still intact for the former three. Focus Sash guarantees that Greninja can set at least one layer of entry hazards and works extremely well to safely put it into Torrent range, which allows Surf to OHKO Hisuian Zoroark and provides significant odds to OHKO Iron Valiant, one of the biggest threats to offense teams. Alternatively, Protean improves Ice Beam's damage and allows Greninja to block Volt Switch from Rotom-W, Iron Treads, and Sandy Shocks when using Spikes, maintaining offensive momentum. Tera Water boosts Greninja's Surf, notably netting the OHKO on specially defensive Garganacl and 2HKO on Tera Fairy Skeledirge with Torrent, as well as the 2HKO on Gholdengo and Corviknight after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Greninja is perfectly suited for hyper offense teams. Offensive teammates like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon put further pressure on entry hazard removers such as Corviknight, Iron Treads, and Great Tusk to maintain Greninja's Spikes throughout the game and enjoy Spikes chipping down their checks like Garganacl, Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Dondozo. They also appreciate Spikes invalidating Focus Sash from Pokemon like Hisuian Zoroark, Ceruledge, and Meowscarada. Aside from possessing insane late-game potential themselves, Kingambit and Iron Moth particularly help against Meowscarada—one of the few leads that can easily beat Greninja—and Hatterene, which can freely switch into Greninja and reflect its Taunt and entry hazards with Magic Bounce, with Calm Mind variants using it as setup fodder as well. Kingambit in particular appreciates Greninja's tendency to faint early-game to accumulate Supreme Overlord boosts. Knock Off from Bulk Up Great Tusk and Swords Dance Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from walls like Dondozo, Slowking, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge, making them susceptible to Greninja's Spikes. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragon Dance Dragapult can spinblock the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch to keep Greninja's Spikes up; Gholdengo in particular does it exceptionally well by blocking Defog and Glimmora's Mortal Spin as well, and it has the added benefit of threatening Hatterene and crippling walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu with Choice item + Trick, making them more vulnerable to Greninja's entry hazards.</p>"

Surf, despite being weaker than Hydro Pump, is a solid option due to its reliability, while Hydro Pump is a stronger alternative despite its lower accuracy, as it allows Greninja to OHKO targets such as Mega Charizard Y under sun. Dark Pulse gives Greninja a strong neutral STAB move to hit common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Rotom-W, additionally wielding a nasty flinch chance to potentially break through them. Water Shuriken gives Greninja a priority option, crucial for revenge killing weakened targets that outspeed it like Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny, as well as getting the jump on other priority moves such as Weavile's Ice Shard and the aforementioned Mega Lopunny's Quick Attack. Ice Beam is Greninja's coverage move of choice, being its strongest option versus Pokemon like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Dragonite. Tera Water is the preferred Tera type, giving a significant boost to both of Greninja's Water-type STAB moves to potentially secure KOs on targets like Mega Charizard Y in sun and Tapu Lele after a Battle Bond activation with Surf. Greninja can also serve as a potent albeit niche wallbreaker on rain teams, with rain boosting the power of its Water-type STAB moves to ridiculous levels. This allows teammates like Mega Swampert and Zapdos to clean up the weakened defensive cores consisting of Pokemon like Rotom-W and Galarian Slowking. However, Greninja alone can struggle to break through sturdier Water-resistant foes like Tera Water Garganacl, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn, so teammates like Tapu Koko, Gholdengo, and Heatran that can capitalize on Greninja forcing these foes in function well as teammates on certain offensive compositions.</p>"

Rock Slide deals with Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Aside from enabling Greninja to pivot, U-turn also provides coverage against Mega Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, and opposing Greninja. The Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO against Kartana with Ice Beam. Terastallizing is mainly used to improve its offensive capabilities; for instance, Tera Poison gives Gunk Shot significant odds to OHKO specially defensive Tera Grass Heatran, Clefable, and Tera Fairy Garganacl after Stealth Rock, while Tera Ice boosts Ice Beam to OHKO Dragapult and physically defensive Tangrowth and Great Tusk. Wallbreakers like Garchomp, Zamazenta, Tapu Lele, and Mega Charizard Y appreciate Greninja's U-turn bringing them in safely on foes like Heatran, Garganacl, Toxapex, and Gholdengo, respectively. Garchomp also provides entry hazards to punish Greninja's forced switches, chipping down the likes of Garganacl and Heatran. In return, Greninja outpaces faster threats like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult that would otherwise overwhelm them. Greninja can form a VoltTurn core with Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Mega Scizor; the former two also provide Defog so Greninja can pivot more freely, especially if running Tera Ice.</p>"

Quaquaval can also run Rapid Spin to let Greninja enter the field multiple times to wallbreak without worry, preventing it from being chipped down into KO range of priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Baxcalibur's Ice Shard. Pivot support from Slowking is helpful to bring Greninja in safely on foes like Dragalge and Gastrodon, letting it fire off attacks freely.

Tera Ground allows Vivillon to turn the tables on Volt Switch users such as Jolteon and Rotom and also helps it survive Accelerock from Lycanroc. Alternatively, Tera Ghost along with Substitute allows Vivillon to set up against Chansey, which would normally wall it, and Tera Flying can be used to power up Vivillon's Hurricane.</p> <p>If Vivillon is running Focus Sash over Heavy-Duty Boots, strong hazard control is key, so Hattrem, which prevents opposing hazards through Magic Bounce, and other hazard removal options such as Drifblim and Lurantis are mandatory. Special walls such as Chansey and Eelektross are a serious obstacle for Vivillon to overcome, with the former's Natural Cure negating the effect of Sleep Powder, so physical wallbreakers that can take advantage of them like Toxicroak, Paldean Tauros, and Ursaring make for great partners. Trick users, such as Rotom and Zoroark, can also bait in these foes and cripple them by giving them a Choice item, with Rotom deserving special mention for inviting in Lurantis and Appletun, which gives a Vivillon relatively free setup opportunity. Spikes support from the likes of Qwilfish and Cacturne is also appreciated to help wear down answers to Vivillon over time. Strong setup sweepers like Veluza, Dudunsparce, and Lycanroc, which all appreciate foes being put to sleep, also make for powerful partners in conjunction with Vivillon.</p>"

Taunt allows Pyroar to prevent bulky Pokemon like Blissey, Muk, and Ursaring from getting free switch-in to use their utility moves while also stopping setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Braviary, Coil Eelektross, and Nasty Plot Mesprit. Will-O-Wisp threatens Pyroar switch-ins like Samurott, Muk, and Assault Vest Eelektross. Tera Blast is most commonly run with Tera Grass, allowing Pyroar to destroy threats like Floatzel, Sandaconda, and Veluza. Endeavor can be used over Will-O-Wisp to severely weaken special walls like Blissey, Appletun, and Ursaring if they attempt to trade damage after Pyroar uses Taunt versus them. Tera Ghost allows Pyroar to turn the tables against common Fighting-types such as Toxicroak, Medicham, and Hisuian Sneasel that would usually destroy it. Alternatively, Tera Grass allows Pyroar to tank powerful Water- and Ground-type attacks from Bruxish, Floatzel, and Sandaconda.</p> <p>Pyroar can't reliably defeat walls such as Blissey, Umbreon, and Appletun; it best pairs with physical wallbreakers like Toxicroak, Scyther, and Samurott that can deal with these threats. If Pyroar loses its Heavy-Duty Boots, it becomes susceptible to entry hazards, so hazard removers such as Avalugg, Drifblim, and Lurantis or a hazard deterrent like Hattrem are great partners. Grass-types like Cacturne, Appletun, and Lurantis appreciate Pyroar for checking threats such as Scyther, Avalugg, and Vivillon; in return, they check Water-types like Bruxish, Clawitzer, and Samurott. Fighting-types like Hisuian Sneasel and Choice Scarf Medicham can threaten out Pyroar, so it pairs best with Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Mesprit, Bruxish, and Drifblim.</p>"

It is also a solid switch-in to Water-types like Whiscash and Basculin, comfortably taking their STAB moves and threatening to OHKO them or set up. Bulk Up is what lets Gogoat become so threatening late-game, letting it take on physical attackers like Perserrker and Sawsbuck after a Bulk Up or two. Rock Slide is optimal coverage alongside Horn Leech, hitting Grass-type checks like Charizard, Honchkrow, and Articuno. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Gogoat ignore entry hazards, namely the otherwise debilitating Toxic Spikes. Water is the premier Tera type due to its overall defensive utility, reversing Gogoat's Fire weakness and making it take Flying- and Bug-type attacks more easily, which lets it set up on various foes it could not before such as Charizard, Rabsca, and Camerupt. However, Tera Rock gives Gogoat STAB on Rock Slide while still having it resist Fire and Flying, but it becomes vulnerable to Ground- and Steel-types like Gabite and Perrserker. Both Tera types keep Gogoat's usefulness as a Grass-type check due to Sap Sipper.</p> <p>Before Terastallizing or setting up, Gogoat is threatened by common offensive Pokemon like Charizard, Pyroar, and Rotom-F, so additional special walls like Carbink and Ampharos are recommended as partners. Carbink can also set entry hazards to wear down Gogoat's checks like Gabite and Tinkatuff, while Ampharos can bring Gogoat in with Volt Switch. Pokemon like Basculin and Alolan Dugtrio appreciate having a Pokemon that can come in on Electric- and Grass-types like Raichu and Leafeon. Misdreavus is particularly annoying for Gogoat, able to cripple it with Will-O-Wisp + Hex and use it at setup bait, so ways to dispose of or significantly weaken Misdreavus are appreciated. Wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Skuntank, special Honchkrow, and Indeedee-F can threaten Misdreavus while not caring about Will-O-Wisp, while paralysis from Tinkatuff and Alolan Persian can help Gogoat brute force its way past Misdreavus.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Aegislash's valuable defensive profile and immense natural bulk in Shield forme make it perfectly capable of forcing out and setting up on passive Pokemon such as Slowking, Jirachi, and Amoonguss. Substitute allows Aegislash to take advantage of the aforementioned Pokemon's inability to deal sufficient damage to it while also protecting it from potential status moves from these Pokemon; it also allows it to safely land Toxic on incoming defensive walls such as Ting-Lu and Gastrodon, stalling them out in conjunction with King's Shield and recovery from Leftovers. Shadow Ball serves as Aegislash's main STAB move, and alongside Aegislash's naturally high Special Attack stat, is useful for putting pressure onto Toxic-immune Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Excadrill, and Mega Sableye. SubToxic Aegislash fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to safely set up on and wear down defensive Pokemon while also making use of its ability to simultaneously check offensive threats such as Galarian Zapdos and Latios. Due to Aegislash's fear of status moves, like Scald burns from the likes of Slowking, as well as Spore from Amoonguss, pivots such as Flip Turn Keldeo, U-turn Iron Moth, and Teleport Blissey are helpful to ensure that Aegislash finds safe opportunities against them. Other defensive Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Clefable can form notable cores with Aegislash; the former two take advantage of Dark- and Ground-types such as Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu, while Clefable provides additional support in staving off the likes of Latios and Buzzwole, which can potentially nail Aegislash on the switch with Mystical Fire or Earthquake, respectively. Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Clefable and Assault Vest Tangrowth are also helpful, as they can remove items from checks to Aegislash like Leftovers from Celesteela and Heavy-Duty Boots from Iron Moth and Scizor, giving it an easier time breaking through them in the long-run.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance turns Aegislash into a potent wallbreaker and sweeper, using its fantastic neutral coverage and bulk in Shield forme to set up against and break through defensive cores. Close Combat is Aegislash's strongest move overall, and it threatens the many Dark-types that would otherwise resist its Ghost-type STAB moves, like Mega Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Ting-Lu. Iron Head is an alternative option that still OHKOes the former two after a boost while also 2HKOing Unaware Clefable. Shadow Sneak is a crucial priority move which at +2 can finish off weakened offensive Pokemon that would normally outspeed and take it out, such as Iron Moth and Keldeo, while also being usable to pick off Latios and Alakazam without a boost. Ghostium Z is usually preferred to power up STAB Shadow Claw, which, when turned into Never Ending Nightmare, threatens to KO physically defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory and Amoonguss after Swords Dance. However, Air Balloon can be run instead if the team already has a different Z-Move user, and this also allows Aegislash to find free setup opportunities against Ground-types such as Excadrill and Hippowdon, potentially spinblocking the former. Aegislash fits best on more offensive teams that appreciate its defensive utility and ability to break open holes for its teammates early-game. Other sweepers such as Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar can benefit from Ghostium-Z variants of Aegislash forcing in and eliminating Buzzwole, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth; in return, Mega Tyranitar can help Aegislash weaken certain walls like Slowbro and Mandibuzz early-game. Aegislash also suffers from having terrible bulk in Blade forme, so it is easily revenge killed after attacking, making entry hazard support from the likes of Mew, Ting-Lu, and Mega Tyranitar helpful at chipping down offensive threats like Excadrill into Shadow Sneak range while also pressuring other walls such as Tapu Fini.</p>"

        "Mixed Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>Mixed Aegislash makes the most out of its excellent offensive stats accentuated further by Spell Tag to serve as a terrifying early- or mid-game wallbreaker. Close Combat forms perfect neutral coverage with Shadow Ball, notably 2HKOing Blissey and OHKOing Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. Shadow Sneak gives Aegislash additional utility in being able to pick off weakened offensive Pokemon such as Latios and Blacephalon when needed. King's Shield prevents Aegislash from being picked off by Pursuit users like Tyranitar and lets it scout Choice-locked revenge killers such as Keldeo and Hydreigon. 8 Attack EVs with a Mild nature are necessary for Aegislash to 2HKO Chansey with Close Combat after Stealth Rock. Mixed Aegislash commonly features on more offensive teams that appreciate its instant wallbreaking power combined with its utility. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar can be very crucial in helping Aegislash secure 2HKOes against Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Amoonguss on the switch. While Aegislash can find additional opportunities by pivoting directly into attackers such as Latios and Galarian Zapdos, it is often unable to preserve its HP to continue wallbreaking after doing so; as such, pivots like Galarian Zapdos are essential to let Aegislash enter the battlefield safely against Pokemon it would like to force out, such as Slowbro. Other setup Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Hydreigon can help overwhelm shared checks to this set, such as Ting-Lu; in return, Hydreigon benefits from Aegislash's ability to keep faster Pokemon like Latios and Alakazam in check.</p>"

Its above-average Speed also enables it to outspeed all prominent Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon, Galarian Zapdos, and Sandy Shocks after Unburden. Acrobatics pairs really well with Unburden and is Hawlucha's best move due to its power, notably helping deal with the plethora of Fighting- and Grass-types, 2HKOing Okidogi, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss and OHKOing Buzzwole. Close Combat hits Steel-types that resist Acrobatics like Celesteela, Skarmory, and Excadrill, as well as OHKOing Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Hydreigon. Taunt prevents Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Okidogi, and Mew from using recovery, setup, and status moves, while Roost lets Hawlucha set up in front of defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth, Buzzwole, and Hippowdon. Grassy Seed is used on teams with Tapu Bulu boosting its Defense, while Misty Seed is used on teams with Tapu Fini boosting its Special Defense. The first EV spread lets Hawlucha avoid an OHKO from defensive Clefable's Moonblast and should be run alongside Grassy Seed. The second EV spread is used to let it survive a Moonblast from defensive Clefable after Misty Seed is activated. 124 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Sand Rush Excadrill. Hawlucha functions as a do-or-die sweeper on offense teams. Tapu Bulu and Tapu Fini are mandatory teammates for Hawlucha, as they can allow it to immediately use up its item and active Unburden; offensive variants are perferred when using Hawlucha, helping to threaten targets like Slowbro and Mega Sableye respectively. Hawlucha can have a hard time breaking through Fairy- and Ghost-types like Tapu Fini, Mega Altaria, and Mega Sableye, as well as Skeledirge, which deserves a special mention because of its typing, ability, and good physical bulk. Hawlucha pairs well with general offensive partners like Thundurus, Celesteela, and Enamorus, which can help threaten the aforementioned foes out and can also help against generally physically bulky Pokemon like Slowbro; in return, Hawlucha can help to break Mega Venusaur, Chansey, and Blissey. Hawlucha appreciates entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar and notably dedicated hyper offense leads like Excadrill, which can also help keep off Stealth Rock. Entry hazard chip which can be useful to help 2HKO bulky Scizor and Mega Altaria.

Its high-powered STAB moves—which can be boosted further by Swords Dance—hit almost the entire metagame neutrally; Acrobatics grants Hawlucha strong neutral coverage against the likes of Tornadus-T, Dragapult, and Tapu Lele, which is backed up by Close Combat to decimate Flying-resistant Pokemon like Kingambit, Garganacl, and Mega Tyranitar. Its item instantly activates Unburden under the corresponding Terrain and grants it setup opportunities from the Defense boost, especially in conjunction with Roost. Electric Seed helps against Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk and prevents revenge killing attempts from Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Weavile's Ice Shard, while Psychic Seed helps against Gholdengo, Volcarona, and Choice-locked Dragapult. Taunt or Substitute deals with problematic walls, ignoring status like Toxapex's Toxic and Skeledirge's Will-O-Wisp; Taunt also prevents their recovery and phazing as well as Defense-boosting attempts such as from Skarmory or Tera Water Buzzwole, while Substitute blocks Landorus-T's Intimidate and punishes the use of weak attacks like its U-turn, Garganacl's Salt Cure, and Alomomola's Scald. The bulk investment allows Hawlucha to survive Clefable's Moonblast, which is unnecessary if running Psychic Seed. 176 Speed EVs can be used instead to revenge kill +1 Dragon Dance Dragapult. Tera Flying boosts Hawlucha's Acrobatics, potentially OHKOing Clefable at +2 and letting it set up against defensive Tornadus-T if necessary. The corresponding Alolan Guardian is a mandatory teammate to reliably activate Hawlucha's Unburden; Tapu Koko provides dual screens and brings Hawlucha in safely on Tangrowth and Ferrothorn with U-turn, while Tapu Lele pressures Toxapex and overwhelms Gholdengo. Offensive Pokemon on hyper offense teams such as Iron Valiant, Volcarona, Dragonite, and Mega Gyarados help maintain offensive pressure against the opposition; notably, they can force damage onto shared checks like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, Zapdos, and Toxapex, respectively, for Hawlucha to sweep more easily.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Carving out a niche for itself as an entry hazard setter with good matchups against common threats such as Charizard and Articuno, Carbink is easily able to exploit the fact that many common offensive Pokemon will struggle to OHKO it, making entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field nearly guaranteed. Body Press further takes advantage of Carbink's naturally high Defense by allowing it to deal modest damage, especially to frail attackers such as Pyroar or Steel-types that may try to switch in, such as Perrserker or Alolan Dugtrio, although its reliance on Body Press to not be immensely passive can invite in opposing Misdreavus or other Pokemon that may choose to utilize Tera Ghost. Power Gem allows for Carbink to target common Pokemon in the tier that have a large Rock weakness, such as Charizard, Articuno, Masquerain, and Vespiquen, while also insuring that it is not entirely helpless against the aforementioned Misdreavus. Spikes allows Carbink to be of greater assistance to more fast-paced offensive teams, further exploiting its natural bulk to apply even more pressure to the opponent in the form of entry hazards. Rest allows for Carbink to somewhat make up for its lack of recovery, which helps it to still be a threat later in the game and to set hazards back up if they are removed. Lastly, Iron Defense allows Carbink to become a threatening sweeper by making it even more difficult to break through while also greatly increasing the damage done by Body Press. Heavy-Duty Boots helps Carbink by making it immune to opposing hazards, greatly increasing its longevity, while Leftovers allows for a small amount of passive recovery. Tera Fighting increases the damage of Body Press even further, while Tera Ghost allows for Carbink to block attempts at using Rapid Spin to clear away hazards. A more physically defensive spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with a Bold nature is also viable to improve Carbink's matchup against threats such as Gogoat and Dugtrio.</p> <p>Carbink's high success rate when it comes to setting up entry hazards is greatly appreciated by almost all teams, especially those that make use of setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Charizard or powerful breakers like Zangoose, which greatly benefit from the extra chip damage that Carbink provides. In addition, Grass-types such as Gogoat and Thwackey appreciate Carbink's ability to take hits from the multitude of powerful Fire-types in the tier. Thwackey is also one of the few Pokemon in PU with access to Knock Off, which is valuable for removing Heavy-Duty Boots from opponents and making Carbink's hazards much more difficult to manage. Furthermore, Grassy Terrain lessens the damage dealt by Earthquake and provides Carbink with passive recovery, which is especially beneficial should it choose to run Heavy-Duty Boots. In return, these Pokemon are strong answers to Water-types such as Whiscash and Golduck that can solidly threaten Carbink with super effective attacks. Carbink also appreciates strong Ground- and Fire-types, such as Dugtrio, Charizard, and Pyroar, that can handle threatening Steel-types such as Perrserker and Alolan Dugtrio for it. Due to Carbink being extremely slow and vulnerable to moves such as Taunt and Encore, fast teammates such as the aforementioned Dugtrio, as well as Alolan Persian and Raichu, are also appreciated to handle attempts to stifle Carbink alongside providing much-needed speed control.</p>"

        "Iron Defense": {
          "description": "<p>Iron Defense Carbink is an incredibly terrifying defensive setup sweeper with incredible stats, making really hard to stop even for some of the most threatening physical attackers like Crabominable, and Lycanroc-N, especially after it starts boosting with Iron Defense. Body Press hits most of the tier for neutral or super effective damage, making its switch-ins very limited after a boost. Most of these switch-ins like Charizard and Masquerain also have to be wary of Power Gem. Carbink could choose to run Moonblast instead, hitting the likes of Drakloak and Spiritomb. Rock Polish is an option in the last slot to boost past Pokemon that could normally pick it off at low health like offensive Perrserker, Klawf, and Gabite. Carbink can also opt to run RestTalk alongside Iron Defense and Body Press to function better as a late-game sweeper once opposing Ghost-types and bulky Pokemon that resist its attacks are removed. Clear Body helps with many aspects, like avoiding defensive drops from moves like Misdreavus's Shadow Ball or Quaxwell's Liquidation, blocking Alolan Persian's Parting Shot, and ignoring Sticky Web's Speed drop. Tera Fighting is used to boost Body Press's power, helping Carbink pick up the 2HKO on Gogoat, Skuntank, and Whiscash. A defensive Tera like Ghost or Water also work well with helping Carbink get by various foes. Ghost drops all of its weaknesses, allowing it to tank hits with greater ease, but it makes enemies like Misdreavus, Banette, and Haunter more problematic. Water is a great option for stuffing the likes of Golduck, Basculin, and Lumineon, though Carbink then has to be wary of Rotom-F and Raichu in addition to being a generally good defensive typing that also allows it to shrug off hits from Steel-type moves that would usually obliterate it. Carbink can opt to run a more specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature to better take hits from Whiscash, Lumineon, and Raichu for an easier time setting up on them. However, you do miss out on initial Body Press power.</p> <p>Carbink works great on balance or bulky offensive teams looking for an endgame sweeper. It does great at supporting the likes of Misdreavus, Haunter, and Indeedee-F since it can wall Dark-types like Honchkrow, Alolan Persian, and Spiritomb. Carbink also isn't bothered by the likes of Houndoom, Pyroar, and Charizard which teammates like Gogoat, Rotom-F, and Rabsca really appreciate. It also fits the role of a Knock Off absorber, being able to take the hit when switching in and either immediately deal damage back or start setting up on Banette, Tinkatuff, and Klawf. While Carbink's defensive capabilities make it a great teammate, it also can break through bulky teams that rely on the likes of Hisuian Sliggoo and Chansey, which special attackers such as Haunter, Persian and Rotom-F enjoy having removed. Grass-types such as Gogoat, Dartrix, and Flapple really help Carbink find multiple opportunities to come back in to set up since they can help take hits from the likes of Whiscash, Basculin, and Sawsbuck. Carbink also really appreciates having a partner that can help with its 4x weakness to Steel, specifically against Perrserker and Alolan Dugtrio, like defensive Misdreavus, Lumineon, and RestTalk Gabite.</p>"

Dragon Tail lets Hisuian Goodra force out setup sweepers such as Gholdengo and Manaphy, as well as racking up chip damage. Knock Off is a great option against Gholdengo, and it also cripples switch-ins such as RegenVest Manaphy, Swampert, and Meloetta. Hisuian Goodra has many options to fill the last two moveslots based on its team's needs: Earthquake hits Ceruledge, Heatran, and opposing Hisuian Goodra, while Flamethrower hits Corviknight and does more damage to non-Well Baked Body Gholdengo than Knock Off when its item has been removed already. Thunderbolt hits non-Volt Absorb Corviknight and Manaphy, Ice Beam threatens Great Tusk and Dragonite, and Draco Meteor is a strong STAB move that can OHKO Walking Wake and does significant damage to Roaring Moon. Hisuian Goodra lacks pivoting unlike other RegenVest users such as Manaphy and Meloetta, so it finds its place on bulkier teams that can afford hard switching. Hisuian Goodra pairs well with strong but frail offensive threats such as Galarian Zapdos, wearing down the opponent's team and giving these threats the opportunity to clean up. Entry hazard removers such as Corviknight are great partners for Hisuian Goodra, allowing it to make full use of Regenerator. It also pairs well with hazard setters such as Deoxys-S thanks to Knock Off's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes and Dragon Tail's phazing. Hisuian Goodra heavily relies on its item to function, so it dislikes being hit by Knock Off from Roaring Moon and Walking Wake; it also struggles against physical attackers such as Iron Boulder and Galarian Zapdos, so physically defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Deoxys-D are great partners, as they can take hits for it, with the former also being able to absorb Knock Off.</p>"

Additionally, Spikes provide some chip damage to ensure OHKOs on foes like Meowscarada. Choice Specs Flutter Mane can also take advantage of the chip damage from Klefki's Spikes to power through teams and more easily defeat walls such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and Amoonguss. Calm Mind Flutter Mane benefits both dual screens to set up and sweep and from Thunder Wave slowing down threats like Barraskewda. Iron Valiant appreciates Klefki slowing down faster foes like Flutter Mane, Cinderace, and Dragapult with Thunder Wave, allowing it to defeat them. Iron Valiant also provides a much-needed offensive pressure against Steel-types like Kingambit and works as a devastating offensive core when paired with Flutter Mane. Hatterene and Klefki form a strong defensive core, with the former’s Magic Bounce punishing any attempt from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Forretress to set entry hazards, while the latter can come in on Poison-type moves, potentially forcing a switch on a Choice locked Pokemon like Greninja in the process. The additional bulk that Hatterene receives from the dual screens even allows it to take a stand against foes such as Glimmora, Clodsire, and Toxapex, preventing them from setting their hazards while countering them.</p>"

Amoonguss also acts as a great partner for Diancie, with its Rage Powder and Spore protecting it from the Ground, Water, and Steel attacks that would threaten it. Pollen Puff also helps to increase its longevity.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Band Hoopa-U is an extremely strong physical wallbreaker that can be very threatening to more balanced and defensive teams due to its massive Attack stat and reliable STAB move in Hyperspace Fury, which is capable of impressive feats such as 2HKOing physically defensive Corviknight and Toxapex the majority of the time and always 2HKOing physically defensive Rotom-W. Zen Headbutt is a nice complementary STAB move, allowing Hoopa-U to smack prominent Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant that may try to switch in on a predicted Hyperspace Fury. Drain Punch hits Dark-types like Kingambit and Ting-Lu, while Gunk Shot offers coverage against Fairy-types like Enamorus and Azumarill, as well as Tera Fairy Moltres, Garganacl, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur. A Jolly nature allows Hoopa-U to outspeed Pokemon like Timid Heatran, Modest Gholdengo, and Timid Volcanion, while an Adamant nature allows Hoopa-U to hit even harder, 2HKOing Garganacl the majority of the time. Tera Dark boosts the power of Hyperspace Fury even further, 2HKOing physically defensive Dondozo; Tera Dark also offers the additional benefit of making Hoopa-U resist other Dark-type attacks, which can be crucial against Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Hoopa-U fits well on bulky offense teams that are in need of a physical wallbreaker. Physical setup sweepers like Kingambit, Baxcalibur, and Dragonite appreciate Hoopa-U's presence on a team, as Hoopa-U is able to break through or dent physically defensive Pokemon that could stand in their way, like Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Rotom-W. One of Hoopa-U's biggest challenges is safely getting on the field due to its frail physical defense and quadruple weakness to U-turn, so it pairs well with pivots such as Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking, U-turn Dragapult, and Volt Switch Zapdos. Hoopa-U is also held back by its middling Speed, which tends to exacerbate Hoopa-U's physical frailty, so it appreciates paralysis support from partners like Rotom-W and Substitute Dragapult. Static Zapdos is a particularly notable partner for Hoopa-U, because it is able to switch in and potentially paralyze faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Dragapult, rendering those Pokemon no longer threatening to Hoopa-U. Pokemon that can set entry hazards like Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Landorus-T help facilitate with Hoopa-U breaking through its switch-ins. Opposing physical Dark-types, such as Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Roaring Moon, typically force Hoopa-U out, especially after a Defense drop. For this reason, sturdy Dark-resistant teammates like Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Low Kick Kingambit synergize well with Hoopa-U, while those Pokemon also appreciate Hoopa-U punching holes in the opposing team's defensive backbone.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Hoopa-U is an incredibly threatening special wallbreaker, especially to slower and more defensive teams, that is able to OHKO the majority of the tier and 2HKO essentially every other relevant Pokemon. This is thanks to Hoopa-U's astronomically high Special Attack stat and potent dual STAB combination. Focus Blast rounds out its coverage, allowing Hoopa-U to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Hisuian Samurott; Focus Blast also OHKOes specially defensive Heatran after entry hazard chip. Trick can be run in the fourth slot to cripple the few special walls that Hoopa-U is unable to reliably blast through, like Blissey, Scream Tail, and Alolan Muk, while also affording Hoopa-U the ability to switch moves, alleviating the need for prediction in exchange for less immediate power. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be used instead as Hoopa-U's best option to hit Corviknight and Galarian Moltres while also providing a more reliable option than Focus Blast to OHKO Hisuian Samurott and Greninja. A Timid nature makes Hoopa-U faster than Pokemon like Timid Heatran, Modest Gholdengo, and Timid Volcanion, while a Modest nature gives Hoopa-U even more breaking power so that it is able to potentially 2HKO Blissey and Alolan Muk with Focus Blast after entry hazard damage. Tera Dark increases the power of Dark Pulse, giving it an opportunity to 2HKO Scream Tail and specially defensive Heatran while also threatening to OHKO Baxcalibur, bulky Cinderace, and defensive Landorus-T. Tera Dark also makes Hoopa-U resist Dark-type attacks, which can prevent Kingambit from answering it with Sucker Punch. Quick special attackers like Choice Specs Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus make good teammates, as they appreciate Hoopa-U's ability to break through even the bulkiest of specially defensive walls. One of Hoopa-U's biggest flaws is that its physical frailty and crippling 4x weakness to U-turn can make it difficult for it to safely be brought onto the field. As a result, Hoopa-U greatly benefits from being paired alongside pivots that can facilitate its entry, like Galarian Slowking with Chilly Reception; Landorus-T, Dragapult, and Sneasler with U-turn; and Rotom-W and Zapdos with Volt Switch. Paralysis support from Thunder Wave users like Rotom-W, Substitute Dragapult, and defensive Gholdengo can help alleviate Hoopa-U's lackluster Speed and make previously faster threats easy targets. Static Zapdos synergizes particularly well with Hoopa-U in this regard, since Zapdos can punish U-turns directed at Hoopa-U from faster Pokemon like Cinderace, Sneasler, and Meowscarada to potentially paralyze them. Hoopa-U also appreciates the inclusion of hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Heatran, allowing it to punch holes in defensive backbones more easily and damage the opposing team thanks to the switches it forces. Some of the most difficult Pokemon for Hoopa-U to handle are opposing Dark-types like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Ting-Lu, and Hisuian Samurott because they can force Hoopa-U to rely on Focus Blast and good prediction to break through. To help mitigate this issue, Pokemon that can reliably switch into Dark-types like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Azumarill also make good partners for Hoopa-U, and in return they appreciate Choice Specs Hoopa-U's ability to threaten physical walls as well. Bulk Up Great Tusk and Belly Drum Azumarill can also clean up late-game after Hoopa-U wears down the opposing team.</p>"

        "Assault Vest": {
          "description": "<p>Equipping Hoopa-U with an Assault Vest makes the most of its excellent coverage and surprisingly high special bulk, letting it trade with various special attackers like Dragapult and Walking Wake. Strong Knock Off is a large reason to use this set, as it is an excellent progress maker, particularly against bulkier teams. Psychic is run over Zen Headbutt for its higher accuracy and better damage against physically defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Great Tusk. Drain Punch provides Hoopa-U with adequate recovery and logevity, and it is largely used to hit Kingambit and other Dark-types, which otherwise walls this set. Gunk Shot provides important coverage for Fairy-types like Enamorus and Tera Fairy foes like Garganacl while potentially poisoning checks like Ting Lu. Tera Poison not only empowers its Gunk Shot but also gives it a crucial Fairy and U-turn resistance. 248 HP and 40 Defense investment with a Lonely Nature allows Hoopa-U to survive one Sucker Punch from Adamant Kingambit with a maximum Supreme Overlord boost and gives it an easier time against weaker physical attacks from Pokemon like Garganacl and Clodsire. Meanwhile, 84 SpA EVs give Hoopa-U a guaranteed OHKO on Iron Moth with Psychic and 92 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Hoopa-U is best utilized on bulky offense teams that can support a slow, powerful wallbreaker like it while still appreciating its ability to trade hits with common special attackers. It is incredibly physically frail, so pairing it with physically bulky Pokemon like Garganacl and Great Tusk is a good idea, as it will often be forced out by physical attackers. Additionally, pivot support from Cinderace and Zapdos can put Hoopa-U in favorable positions to dish out damage with its strong attacks, something that is necessary given its aforementioned physical frailty. Because Hoopa-U often makes great progress with Knock Off, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T are great teammate options. Hoopa-U excels at punching holes in the opposition, so faster offensive teammates like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus are good ideas to take advantage of the resultant weakened foes. Teammates like Amoonguss and Galarian Slowking also deserve consideration for checking Iron Valiant and Enamorus without having to expend Terastallization.</p>"

That said, Hoopa-U competes with Kingambit, which has significantly higher bulk and a way to bypass its Speed tier issue in Sucker Punch. Hoopa-U has a 4x weakness to U-turn and neutrality to Pursuit, meaning it cannot enter or leave the field easily. Nonetheless, Hoopa-U does not require setup, and it therefore has a niche into bulkier teams thanks to its immediate power. Drain Punch lets Hoopa-U take on Dark-types that would otherwise wall it, such as Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar, and Zen Headbutt hammers Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Buzzwole, and Toxapex while also hitting Clefable and Tera Fairy Garganacl neutrally. Gunk Shot provides Hoopa-U with another way to break through Fairy-types such as Tera Fairy Garganacl and Clefable. Tera Dark powers up Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury while giving it a resistance to Pursuit. Hoopa-U fits well on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its power allowing teammates to clean. As such, partners such as Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele pair well with Hoopa-U. The former three also check Kingambit, making Hoopa-U less prediction reliant with its attacks, while the latter appreciates Hoopa-U being able to wear down Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Kingambit. Hoopa-U also has trouble getting into the field due to its low Speed and frail physical bulk, so pivots such as Mega Scizor and Rotom-W are appreciated to bring it in Hoopa-U more consistently. Rotom-W also pivots into Toxapex and Heatran to bring in Hoopa-U, while Mega Scizor pivots into Tapu Lele and Kingambit and brings in Heatran and Skeledirge for Hoopa-U to break through. Entry hazard setters are also appreciated, as Hoopa-U can more easily break through defensive teams with Spikes or Stealth Rock on the field. Thus, partners such as Ferrothorn and Garchomp are appreciated.</p>"

Drain Punch grants Hoopa-U super effective coverage against Dark- and Steel-types such as Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Brick Break can also be run as Hoopa-U's Fighting-type move, as this allows it to remove dual screens set by Fairy- and Dark-type teams. Trick is a great option for Hoopa-U to hinder Pokemon that can take a hit like Sableye and Klefki, as well as potentially disrupt Pokemon reliant on their items such as Moltres. Gunk Shot is another great option, as it allows Hoopa-U to threaten Fairy-types like Azumarill and to OHKO Hatterene. By investing 8 EVs in Special Defense, Hoopa-U can live a Moonblast from Choice Scarf Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Azelf and Scream Tail make for great partners, as they can set up entry hazards for Hoopa-U to be able to wallbreak more easily. Azelf can also run Taunt to prevent Defog users like Corviknight removing its hazards, while Scream Tail can also set up dual screens for both Hoopa-U and its teammates and provide Wish support. Because of Hoopa-U's lack of longevity outside of Wish, it can get easily worn down by hazards. Hence, Hatterene is a great partner, as it is able to provide great hazard control for Psychic teams through Magic Bounce. Galarian Slowking is another great partner for Hoopa-U, as it provides Hoopa-U a switch-in to Fairy-types and aids Hoopa-U's wallbreaking through Future Sight. Galarian Slowking can also set up Toxic Spikes to annoy Hoopa-U's switch-ins such as Azumarill, and its Poison typing allows it to remove Toxic Spikes to prevent Hoopa-U from getting worn down by poison. Indeedee is another great addition to Psychic teams, as its Normal typing grants it an immunity to Ghost. Aside from this, Indeedee can set up Psychic Terrain to allow Hoopa-U to threaten Kingambit with Drain Punch without fearing Sucker Punch. Lastly, late-game sweepers such as Gallade and Armarouge appreciate Hoopa-U beating their checks such as Azumarill for the former and Galarian Slowking for the latter. Lastly, Espathra appreciates Hoopa-U breaking through its checks such as Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Sableye so it can set up and sweep late-game.</p>"

Good coverage options as well as a powerful STAB move that can burn its foes make it very difficult to switch into. Earth Power is crucial for hitting Toxapex, which easily switches into both of Volcanion's STAB moves; it also hits Galarian Slowking harder, notably guaranteeing a 2HKO on physically defensive variants. Taunt is useful against bulkier Pokemon, preventing Dondozo or Toxapex from using healing moves and Galarian Slowking from using Thunder Wave. Substitute eases prediction, as Volcanion can force switches, and it takes advantage of certain Pokemon that fail to break the Substitute such as bulky Cinderace and non-Assault Vest Toxapex while still avoiding status attempts from the aforementioned walls. It also allows Volcanion to avoid Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Tera Blast alongside Tera Fairy can be used to hit Pokemon such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Hisuian Samurott. Becoming a Fairy-type offers useful defensive utility, giving it an immunity to both of Walking Wake's STAB moves and a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Tera Ground can be used to grant Volcanion an Electric immunity, improving its matching against Zapdows and Rotom-W, while also boosting Earth Power's damage. Both Tera types also neutralize its weakness to Earthquake from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. 140 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Great Tusk. Volcanion fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate a strong wallbreaker. Entry hazards, especially Spikes, make Volcanion much harder to deal with. Therefore, hazard setters including Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T make good partners. Ting-Lu can also switch into special attackers like Dragapult and Zapdos for Volcanion. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking cause problems for Volcanion, so teammates that can help overwhelm them such as Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Utility Dragapult are also useful. Finally, Swords Dance Iron Valiant and Kingambit can clean late-game once Volcanion has worn down the opposing team, and they also pressure the aforementioned specially defensive Pokemon. Kingambit in particular appreciates Volcanion's ability to deal with Fire-types like Cinderace and Moltres, and especially its immunity to Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Volcanion is a wallbreaker with absurd strength thanks to its sky high Special Attack and amazing high-Base Power moves, allowing it to make progress every time it is in. Steam Eruption is Volcanion's most spammable move and has very limited switch-ins, as many Pokemon that resist both of Volcanion's STAB moves like Dragapult, Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott end up getting 2HKOed or burned. Fire Blast is Volcanion's best move for Grass-types such as Meowscarada, Amoonguss, and Tera Grass Galarian Slowking. Earth Power helps immensely with Toxapex, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking. Sludge Bomb hits Azumarill and Tera Grass Heatran while crippling foes like Rotom-W more than burn, while Tera Blast Fairy can hit many Dragon types such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon as well as Pokemon like Assault Vest Hisuian Samurott. Tera Fairy also makes Volcanion immune to Dragon-type moves, negating both of Walking Wake's STAB types, and removes all of Volcanion's weaknesses, particularly to Ground-type attacks such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu and Landorus-T's Earthquake. Tera Fairy also allows Volcanion to resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch, making it a great revenge killing option. Tera Water and Tera Fire make Steam Eruption and Fire Blast even stronger, allowing Volcanion to muscle through Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and even 2HKO physically defensive Toxapex. Its main counters are Tera Water Galarian Slowking and Water Absorb or Tera Water Clodsire, alongside Blissey. Volcanion appreciates support from wallbreakers that can deal with these threats or wear them down, such as Black Glasses Kingambit and mixed Iron Valiant. Kingambit in particular loves Choice Specs Volcanion's matchup against Fire-types like Cinderace, Moltres, and Heatran. In turn, Kingambit has a good matchup versus the aforementioned counters and can help pressure other checks such as Toxapex. Dragapult can also be a great partner, as it provides pivoting and speed control along with adding pressure on said counters and checks and has the option to provide great support with Thunder Wave. Great Tusk is another great option, as it can provide hazard removal, which is crucial for Volcanion. It is also a great blanket check for physical attackers that threaten Volcanion, and it provides Knock Off support, making it one of the best defensive partners for Volcanion. Volcanion also fits great on VoltTurn teams, as it loves being brought in as many times as possible by Pokemon such as Cinderace, Dragapult, and Rotom-W.</p>"

Steam Eruption, in addition to being a powerful STAB option, is also very useful at spreading burns in order to weaken potential checks such as Mega Venusaur and Slowking. Sludge Bomb is used in order to break Clefable and Tapu Fini while also heavily damaging switch-ins such as Mega Latias and Hydreigon with a chance to poison them. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be used in order to combat Slowbro and Gastrodon that would otherwise easily switch into Volcanion. Volcanion also offers some utility with Defog, being able to use its offensive capabilities to force out common entry hazard setters such as Mega Tyranitar, Skarmory, and Hippowdon and clear hazards as they flee. Taunt is another utility option that allows Volcanion to shut down the likes of Calm Mind Clefable and Tapu Fini more efficiently while also preventing Slowking and Slowbro from using Teleport and Slack Off. Alternatively, Volcanion can forego its utility options in exchange for Earth Power in order to target threats such as Hisuian Goodra and Iron Hands. Heavy-Duty Boots is Volcanion's main item of choice in order to avoid damage from entry hazards, but it can also run Shuca Berry on more offensive playstyles in order to lure threats attempting to use Ground-type attacks against it, such as Excadrill and Enamorus. Wallbreakers like Hydreigon and Galarian Zapdos make for a solid offensive core with Volcanion, as Volcanion can switch into and pressure their checks in Clefable and Celesteela while they handle its checks in Slowking and Mega Venusaur. Physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl also enjoy Volcanion's Water-type immunity, allowing it to absorb Scald from the likes of Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Gastrodon. Volcanion is capable of pressuring a ton of offensive threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Sandy Shocks, as they are unable to switch into it properly, but unfortunately the inverse can also be said for it, since its mediocre Speed leaves it outpaced by the aforementioned threats and others, such as Iron Moth and Latios. To mitigate this, speed control options such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Enamorus are vital in order to force them out more easily. In return, Volcanion can provide a switch-in to Tapu Fini for them while also pressuring defensive checks such as Amoonguss and Celesteela. Volcanion hates dealing with offensive Ground-types such as Excadrill and Sandy Shocks due to its inability to switch into them, so partners like Skarmory are very useful at keeping them at bay. In return, Volcanion can handle threats that would try to take advantage of Skarmory such as Aegislash and Tapu Fini. Electric-types such as Iron Hands, Thundurus, and Zeraora are also incredibly annoying for Volcanion, so partners such as Gastrodon, Mega Latias, Mega Venusaur, and Tangrowth are good at handling them. In return, Volcanion can pressure threats such as Amoonguss and Celesteela for them. Although Volcanion can beat Rock-types in theory, Tyranitar, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Aerodactyl can pressure it really easily if on the field. Partners such as Iron Hands and Scizor are great at forcing them out, and in return, Volcanion can deal with Iron Defense Skarmory and Amoonguss for them. Dragon-type wallbreakers such as Hydreigon and Salamence can also take advantage of Volcanion by merit of resisting both its STAB moves. Partners such as Celesteela, Clefable, and Mega Tyranitar can effectively force them out for Hydreigon.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Volcanion is a useful Pokemon on Fire teams mainly thanks to its ability, Water Absorb, offering the type an immunity to one of its most common weaknesses. Steam Eruption is Volcanion's preferred Water-type move, with it being able to burn its switch-ins like Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Iron Hands, reducing their overall longevity. Earth Power allows Volcanion to threaten opposing Volcanion, Toxapex, and Heatran. Sludge Bomb allows Volcanion to revenge kill Azumarill after a Belly Drum and threaten other Fairy-type Pokemon like Hatterene and Enamorus. It is also able to target Walking Wake and Rotom-W, which resist Volcanion's STAB attacks, potentially crippling them thanks to the 30% poison chance. Flamethrower is preferred over Fire Blast since it doesn't miss, and the reduced damage is not too significant if Volcanion is under sun, but Fire Blast can be used in order to 2HKO Hisuian Goodra under sun. 96 Speed EVs let Volcanion outspeed Adamant Azumarill in order to revenge kill it with Sludge Bomb, and the rest of the EVs are put in HP to improve Volcanion's overall bulk.</p> <p>Torkoal is a solid partner for Volcanion that assists it with Stealth Rock support, chipping down its switch-ins like Rotom-W and Alolan Muk and working well in conjunction with Steam Eruption's burn chance. Torkoal can also use Rapid Spin to clear away entry hazards for Volcanion if its Heavy-Duty Boots get removed by Alolan Muk or Meowscarada. Furthermore, Torkoal provides Volcanion with sun thanks to Drought, which boosts Volcanion's Fire-type attacks. In return, Volcanion can switch into Water attacks from Barraskewda and Pelipper, which threaten Torkoal. Scovillain helps out Volcanion by threatening Water-immune Pokemon like Clodsire and Gastrodon, and its damage onto the former allows Volcanion to revenge kill it and proceed to threaten slower Ground-types like Quagsire and Ting-Lu. Cinderace is able to threaten Hisuian Goodra with Libero High Jump Kick, whose Assault Vest set easily shrugs off Earth Power from Volcanion and chips it down with Draco Meteor. Cinderace can also steal dual screens from Klefki with Court Change in the Fairy matchup, which supplement Volcanion's naturally good bulk, letting it take hits better. In return, Volcanion offers an answer to Belly Drum Azumarill and threatens Cinderace's defensive answers like Toxapex and Skeledirge. Choice Scarf Hisuian Arcanine offers a solution to handle opposing Dragon-types like Baxcalibur, which can use Volcanion as setup fodder, and also threatens Dragapult and non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Rotom-Heat provides an invaluable Ground immunity for Volcanion to avoid Earthquake from Pokemon like Iron Hands, Iron Treads, and Landorus-T and threatens all 3 of them with a burn from Will-O-Wisp. Rotom-H is also able to threaten defensive Water-types like Toxapex and offensive Water-types like Hisuian Samurott and Quaquaval if it opts for a Choice Scarf. Heatran can help Volcanion deal with Poison teams with its stallbreaker set, which allows it to trap and beat Pokemon like Toxapex one-on-one. Choice Scarf Iron Moth can revenge kill weakened Dragon-types like Walking Wake and Baxcalibur.</p>"

Rain-boosted Steam Eruption combined with Choice Specs allows Volcanion to 2HKO most Pokemon in tier, including most specially defensive walls such as RegenVest Garchomp, Meloetta, and Alolan Muk. Weather Ball dissuades promient Desolate Land users that might want to switch in to Volcanion such as Cinderace and Iron Moth. Earth Power is a more reliable way to deal with Desolate Land users like Iron Moth and Heatran, and it's a reliable way to hit Hisuian Goodra without missing. Focus Blast 2HKOes a would-be check in RegenVest Roaring Moon, as well as Hisuian Goodra after Spikes chip. Volcanion pairs well with entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Garchomp, which help wear down common RegenVest Pokemon like Goodra and Hisuian Goodra, and hazards also guarantee a 2HKO on Meloetta. Due to Volcanion's Stealth Rock weakness it pairs well with hazard removers like Corviknight and Quaquaval, which can also help pivot it in safely.

Flare Blitz is notably able to 2HKO RegenVest users like Hisuian Goodra and Meloetta, and Steam Eruption's burn chance deters would-be switch-ins like defensive Quaquaval and Garchomp. Earth Power reliably threatens Toxapex and Desolate Land users such as Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Cinderace. Taunt can be used to hinder defensive walls with recovery such as Scream Tail and Quaquaval, while Will-O-Wisp is able to reliably burn switch-ins like defensive Quaquaval and Garchomp. Flame Charge is also a niche option to outspeed common revenge killers to Volcanion like Zapdos, Hisuian Arcanine, and Choice Band Galarian Zapdos. Magic Guard helps Volcanion with its weakness to entry hazards while also negating recoil from Flare Blitz and Life Orb. Offensive pivots such as Slither Wing and Iron Moth can bring Volcanion in against defensive cores featuring staples like Intimidate Corviknight and RegenVest users. Fast late-game cleaners like Chien-Pao and Regieleki also appreciate Volcanion's ability to weaken defensive checks like Quaquaval and common RegenVest users, which can allow them to take over games, while also providing speed control against faster threats to Volcanion like Zapdos, Hisuian Electrode, and Roaring Moon. Volcanion's susceptibility to being revenge killed by aformetioned threats makes defensive partners such as Corviknight and Meloetta essential, as they can tank hits and also help pivot to bring in Volcanion safely. Despite being immune to hazards, Volcanion still lacks recovery, so a teammate that can grant it longevity like Wish Scream Tail is also appreciated.</p>"

These traits have great synergy, allowing for Incineroar to weaken foes and constantly threaten Fake Out pressure as it pivots. Incineroar works as a consistent counter to many offensive threats such as Gholdengo and Ogerpon-H. With its toolkit, Incineroar can neutralize the majority of the metagame even when losing one-on-one.</p> </li> <li> <p>Incineroar partners especially well with redirection users like Ogerpon-W and Amoonguss; the former redirects Ground- and the latter Fighting-type moves, while both protect Incineroar from Water-type moves and greatly appreciate Intimidate and Fake Out support in return. Both are also complemented by Incineroar's Flare Blitz, which removes the Grass-types they struggle with. The three of them can also create a strong defensive core that provides many free turns, which are appreciated by set up Pokemon like Gholdengo. Flutter Mane also makes for an outstanding partner, threatening the Fighting-types Incineroar may struggle with while Intimidate patches up its physical bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Incineroar faces issues against Urshifu-R and Landorus, as they threaten to OHKO it and aren't concerned about Intimidate. Incineroar may also struggle against Kingambit, as Defiant limits how much Incineroar can switch and use Parting Shot. Special attackers like Glimmora, Ursaluna-B, and Flutter Mane also aren't affected by Intimidate, with the former two also threatening an OHKO with their STAB moves.</p> </li> </ul>",

Chilling Water lets Primarina take on physical attacking walls like Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra, as it lowers their Attack to manageable levels, but the greatly reduced base power compared to Surf makes Primarina lose out on OHKOing Landorus and Ursaluna-B and 2HKOing Gholdengo and Skeledirge at +1. An EV spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 192 Spe with a Bold nature may be considered, as it lets Primarina outspeed and KO Modest Ursaluna-B which otherwise severely damages Primarina with Blood Moon, but the reduced bulk is detrimental to Primarina's ability to check Baxcalibur and Gouging Fire. If one opts for a fast variant of Primarina, Encore over Draining Kiss or Psychic Noise may also be considered to lock threats such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Bulk Up Corviknight into unfavorable moves. Liquid Voice may be considered to compress the effects of Psychic Noise and Surf into one move, making it easier to fit Encore, but being unable to hit Water Absorb Clodsire is undesirable.

          "description": "<p>With an excellent typing and serviceable Speed and bulk, Primarina is one of the better users of Calm Mind for Fairy teams, as it deals with common roadblocks for Fairy like Corviknight, Clodsire, and Gouging Fire. Psychic Noise prevents all forms of recovery, making it harder for walls like the aforementioned Clodsire and Articuno to keep up with Primarina. Coincidentally, Psychic Noise also helps Primarina muscle past other bulky setup sweepers like Gouging Fire and Clefable. Draining Kiss improves Primarina's longevity and threatens Dragon- and Dark-types like Baxcalibur, Roaring Moon, and Chien-Pao. Surf sweeps away Heatran, Skarmory, and Ursaluna-B, all of which are nuisances for Fairy teams. 60 Speed EVs let Primarina outspeed Corviknight and prevent it from recovering with Psychic Noise, making it easier to wear down, while the rest of the EVs are invested in Defense and HP to improve Primarina's matchup against Gouging Fire and Baxcalibur.</p> <p>Due to Primarina's relatively low Defense stat, dual screens support from Klefki is vital for its success, as it lets Primarina check Swords Dance Ceruledge and Baxcalibur. In return, Primarina deals with Clodsire, Gouging Fire, and Corviknight, which all take advantage of Klefki. Iron Valiant deals with Ogerpon formes, Kyurem, and Landorus, which overwhelm Primarina, and also deals with bulky Steel-types like Kingambit and Hisuian Goodra with Close Combat and Ice Punch. In return, Primarina checks Gouging Fire, which can take advantage of Choice-locked Iron Valiant. Choice Specs Flutter Mane outspeeds and vaporizes Choice Specs Greninja, Choice Specs Latios, Spectrier, and Ogerpon-H; in return, Primarina breaks down defensive Pokemon such as Articuno, Corviknight, Clodsire, and Skarmory for it. Entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, greatly hinder Primarina's ability to set up, so Primarina greatly appreciates Hatterene's ability to bounce back entry hazards with Magic Bounce. Hatterene also has a wide array of supportive moves like Nuzzle and Healing Wish which help circumvent Primarina's low Speed and give it a second chance to sweep. For instance, being able to slow down Articuno and Tornadus and subject Corviknight and Toxapex to the prospect of getting fully paralyzed makes Primarina's job easier. Belly Drum Azumarill is a secondary sweeper that deals with Hisuian Goodra and Alolan Muk, which Primarina struggles to beat, and it's also able to threaten Kingambit and Gliscor more. Choice Scarf Enamorus deals with fast threats like Dragapult and Choice Specs Greninja with Moonblast and loves Primarina being able to soften up opposing teams. Enamorus also provides Healing Wish, which gives Primarina a second chance to threaten opposing teams. Clefable can form a Calm Mind core with Primarina to overload special walls like Articuno and Alolan Muk, or it can set Stealth Rock and slow down the opposing team for Primarina with Thunder Wave. Mimikyu provides a failsafe against sweepers like Ceruledge due to Disguise, and it can use a Swords Dance set to clean up opposing teams late-game.</p>"

Thanks to Iron Fist and its strong STAB moves, Crabominable excels at pressuring walls like Misdreavus on the switch, Gogoat, and Whiscash, which can make it awkward for balance teams to play around. Earthquake hits Skuntank without triggering Aftermath and, after some chip damage, 2HKOes specially defensive Carbink, physically defensive Tinkatuff, and Mareanie. Close Combat is a secondary Fighting STAB option that's stronger than Drain Punch, but Thunder Punch is more reliable against Flying-types than Ice Hammer due to its higher accuracy. 60 Speed EVs allow Crabominable to outrun uninvested base 50s like Perrserker, Chansey, and Carbink. Tera Water helps against Fire-, Water-, and Steel-types like Pyroar, Basculin, and Alolan Dugtrio, all of which can otherwise overwhelm Crabominable. Tera Electric lets Crabominable take Electric-, Flying-, and Steel-type attacks from Pokemon like Rotom-F, Honchkrow, and Tera Steel Alolan Persian and is best used with Thunder Punch. Tera Ground gives Crabominable an Electric immunity, notably letting it block Volt Switch, and secures the OHKO on Skuntank with Earthquake. On teams with entry hazard control, Tera Fire can be considered to let Crabominable absorb Will-O-Wisp and thus more easily handle Misdreavus as well as Fire-types like Pyroar.</p> <p>Crabominable's main flaw is that its poor longevity can limit its ability to repeatedly handle special attackers; this is made worse with Crabominable being vulnerable to all hazards and tending to attack last. Entry hazard removers like Dartrix and Komala can give Crabominable an easier time switching in, with the latter not removing any hazards set by Crabominable's team. Wish support from the likes of Dachsbun and Leafeon is another way to keep Crabominable healthy, with the former also absorbing Fire-type moves from Pokemon like Misdreavus and Charizard. In return, Crabominable pressures Ice- and Steel-types like Rotom-F and Perrserker. Healing Wish Indeedee-F can similarly give Crabominable another chance to sponge hits or break if it gets worn down too quickly. Physical walls like Alolan Persian and Misdreavus can form a good defensive core with Crabominable and facilitate wallbreaking through moves like Parting Shot, Thunder Wave, and Will-O-Wisp. Fast Pokemon like Electrode, Dugtrio, and Choice Scarf Indeedee-F are good at compensating for Crabominable's bad matchup against offense and benefit from its ability to both tear through balance cores and trade with revenge killers like Choice Scarf Rotom-F. Fire- and Dark-types like Charizard and Skuntank can more reliably pressure Misdreavus for Crabominable and appreciate it wearing down bulky foes like Whiscash, Carbink, and Hisuian Sliggoo.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Ribombee is the premier Sticky Web setter for Bug teams thanks to its high Speed, access to further utility in Stun Spore, and Shield Dust letting it always get Sticky Web up against threats such as Choice Scarf Sneasler without worrying about status conditions. Moonblast allows Ribombee to hit Dark- and Fighting-types such as Chien-Pao and Great Tusk, which can either outspeed Ribombee or remove Sticky Web thanks to Rapid Spin. Stun Spore allows Ribombee to annoy threats such as Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Walking Wake, letting its teammates outspeed and remove said foes later on in the game. Quiver Dance allows Ribombee to exert pressure throughout a game while potentially turning it into a win condition in the Dragon and Fighting matchups if it is not needed as a lead. Focus Sash lets Ribombee get Sticky Web up as a lead without having to fear being OHKOed due to its poor bulk.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kleavor is an excellent teammate for Ribombee, as it appreciates being able to outspeed nearly everything in the metagame under Sticky Web, including opposing Choice Scarf users such as Roaring Moon and Meowscarada. It also appreciates Ribombee hitting Fighting-types, such as Great Tusk and Iron Valiant, with Moonblast, allowing it to spam Stone Axe late-game to clean up weakened teams. In return, Kleavor threatens Fire-types such as Torkoal and Moltres that Bug teams struggle to break through. It also compounds with Ribombee's entry hazard pressure thanks to Stone Axe setting Stealth Rock. Swords Dance Scizor is another good teammate for Ribombee, as it appreciates being able to hit normally-faster threats that don't mind Bullet Punch, like Heatran and Walking Wake, hard thanks to Sticky Web not forcing it to rely on Bullet Punch for damage. In compensation, Scizor uses its Poison immunity to come in on threats such as Choice Scarf Sneasler that would otherwise threaten Ribombee and use them as a setup opportunity. It also removes Hatterene, which is invaluable to let Ribombee set up Sticky Web. Slither Wing is another great teammate, as it removes common Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon that Ribombee wouldn't be able to do much against. Forretress can keep hazards off of the field to enhance Ribombee's late-game sweeping potential and preserve its Focus Sash while being able to set hazards itself and take on threats such as Kingambit with Body Press. It also, similarly to Kleavor, can add to the hazard pressure by setting Spikes. Volcarona benefits greatly from Sticky Web, as after one Quiver Dance, it outspeeds Choice Scarf users that would otherwise attempt to revenge kill it, such as Roaring Moon and Urshifu-R. Ribombee, in turn, appreciates the fact that Volcarona can switch in on threats such as Gholdengo and stay healthy while being able to hit Steel-types with a strong Fiery Dance. Lokix can clean teams weakened by Ribombee thanks to its strong U-turn and First Impression while hitting Ghost-types such as Skeledirge and Gholdengo that pose large roadblocks for Bug teams and amplifying the effects of Sticky Web with Knock Off. In exchange, Lokix appreciates being able to outspeed common threats such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane under Sticky Web. Heracross can, in a similar vein to Slither Wing, deal with Steel-types such as Heatran and Kingambit while also using Knock Off to both remove key items from defensive behemoths such as Toxapex and increase the effects of Sticky Web on the opposing team. It appreciates Sticky Web to patch up its lackluster Speed. Finally, Frosmoth is another Quiver Dance user that has massive special bulk thanks to Ice Scales that also appreciates Sticky Web patching up its low Speed.</p>"

Stun Spore is used to cripple Pokemon that can otherwise use Ribombee as setup fodder such as Arceus formes and Zacian-C. Psychic is an option to hit Glimmora for super effective damage, deterring it from using Mortal Spin. Charm is also an alternative move that is used to annoy physical attackers, hindering them from setting up. Tera Ghost allows Ribombee to block Rapid Spin from leads like Great Tusk while also providing it with an immunity to Extreme Speed from Arceus. Tera Steel is an alternative option to block Mortal Spin from Glimmora. Teammates such as Koraidon, Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, Arceus-Ground, Extreme Killer Arceus, Miraidon, and Eternatus benefit heavily from Sticky Web being up, as it makes them much more difficult to revenge kill, with some such as Zacian-C and Eternatus also providing utility by blocking Mortal Spin from Glimmora and setting up Toxic Spikes, respectively. As Ribombee gets shut down by Taunt from Calyrex-S and Miraidon, offensive checks to them such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Arceus-Ground are preferred as teammates. As Ribombee lacks Taunt, another lead such as Arceus-Ground or Glimmora can be used to prevent entry hazards from opposing leads.</p>"

An excellent ability combined with a STAB priority move in Accelerock allows Lycanroc-D to revenge kill foes that greatly threaten Rock teams like Chien-Pao, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Shell Smash Cloyster. With Choice Band, Stone Edge  2HKOes Corviknight. Close Combat deals with Normal-, Rock-, Dark- and Steel-types like Ursaluna, Tyranitar, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Hisuian Goodra. Psychic Fangs not only breaks screens in the Fairy matchup, but it also deals with Fighting- and Poison-types like Urshifu-R, Great Tusk, Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire. Play Rough is another option to deal with Dragon- and Dark- types like Walking Wake, Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Sableye.</p> <p>Garganacl pairs well with Lycanroc-D, as Salt Cure wears down defensive Pokemon Lycanroc-D struggles with such as Quagsire and Corviknight. In return, Garganacl benefits from Lycanroc-D's ability to remove wallbreakers such as Walking Wake and Urshifu-R which threaten Garganacl's Iron Defense + Body Press set. Tyranitar is an essential teammate as it sets up sand to further chip down walls and checks threats like Flutter Mane, Espathra, and Kingambit due to its sheer bulk and great coverage in Heavy Slam, Crunch, and Low Kick. Hisuian Arcanine's wallbreaking power covers walls that are harder for Lycanroc-D to take down, dealing with Toxapex and Corviknight with Head Smash and Flare Blitz, respectively. Kleavor is a great lead, as Stone Axe sets up Stealth Rock to break through any opposing Focus Sash, allowing Lycanroc-D and Hisuian Arcanine to clean teams more easily. It can also pivot into Lycanroc-D with U-turn, luring in foes like Toxapex, Iron Treads, and Heatran in the process.  Choice item Glimmora's colorful moveset helps against walls like Quagsire and Toxapex through the use of Energy Ball and Earth Power, with Choice Scarf allowing Glimmora to outspeed and take down fast offensive threats such as Iron Valiant and Greninja if they aren't running Choice Scarf. Coalossal removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin, checks Scizor, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit with Flamethrower and Body Press, and can burn threats with Flame Body. Iron Defense + Calm Mind Diancie can check Garchomp with Moonblast. Shell Smash Air Balloon Drednaw provides a temporary Ground-type immunity and appreciates defensive walls being worn down by Lycanroc-D.

It can switch into and counter Pokemon like Cinderace and Greninja, scout for Choice item users like Dragapult, Breloom, and Iron Valiant, and absorb Toxic Spikes from Glimmora and opposing Toxapex. Surf forces damage onto Toxic-immune foes such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, Iron Moth, and Kingambit. Toxic shuts down Pokemon such as Dragonite, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W, and if Toxapex should run Toxic Spikes, it matches up well against offensive teams that contain setup sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk. Any attempts of boosting past Toxapex gets shut down easily by Haze, which combined with poison damage prevents Toxapex from being used as setup fodder by Pokemon such as Calm Mind Hatterene. Covert Cloak is an option to ignore Garganacl's Salt Cure, Dragapult and Gholdengo's Shadow Ball drops, and Greninja's Dark Pulse flinches, but Leftovers's longevity reduces Toxapex's reliance on Recover, and it is used over Black Sludge in case Toxapex decides to Terastallize. Tera Steel improves Toxapex's matchup against non-Earthquake Roaring Moon and Meowscarada while still maintaining an immunity to poison. Alternatively, Tera Fairy fares better against Dragapult, Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. The given EVs allow Toxapex to survive two Choice Band Meowscarada's Flower Trick from full health.</p> <p>Toxapex fits nicely on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate a sturdy defensive backbone. Teammates like Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl are terrific defensive partners that covers Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Tera Electric Iron Valiant, respectively. Corviknight and Great Tusk in particular provide a backup check to multiple combinations of physical attackers like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Kingambit that attempt to overwhelm Toxapex. They also remove entry hazards, which would mitigate Toxapex's Regenerator and force it to use Recover more often; in return, Toxapex covers Pokemon such as Cinderace for the former and Greninja for the latter. Bulky setup sweepers like Garganacl, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo can take advantage of Toxic Spikes slowly chipping down checks such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Particularly, Skeledirge and Gholdengo can make use of Hex easily to take advantage of Toxapex spreading poison, as well as threaten Hatterene, which can block Toxapex's Toxic Spikes and use non-Haze variants as setup fodder. Offensive partners like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit compensate for Toxapex's overall passivity; in return, they appreciate Toxapex switching into their revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Scizor, and Iron Valiant, respectively.</p>"

Surf does a solid chunk of damage to common Toxapex switch-ins like Kingambit, physically defensive Corviknight, and Gholdengo and often 2HKOes Garganacl after Stealth Rock. Sludge Bomb has good coverage alongside it, dealing heavy damage to Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Azumarill while breaking Hydreigon's Substitute. Sludge Bomb's high chance to poison can be critical for crippling Rotom-W and Slowking in the long term. Infestation provides a nice source of chip damage while letting Toxapex trap and beat defensive threats, such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Clodsire, in conjunction with Acid Spray. Furthermore, Infestation prevents the opponent from double switching on Toxapex, enabling much safer plays. Instead of Acid Spray, Ice Beam works to offer more immediate damage against Clodsire, Dragonite, Dragapult, and Amoonguss. Tera Blast, with Tera Fighting, is also viable to nab surprise KOs on Kingambit and Roaring Moon, which might otherwise set up on it. However, Fairy is the most standard Tera type for Toxapex, allowing it to block Dragon-type attacks from Dragapult and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Toxapex fits best on balance and bulky teams that appreciate its unique combination of bulk and power. Assault Vest Toxapex likes to pivot around aggressively and spread chip damage, thanks in part to Regenerator: entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu can help it pressure opposing teams more, punishing opponents for switching out against it. Without either Haze or Toxic, Toxapex is vulnerable to setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon, so Unaware Pokemon such as Dondozo and Skeledirge are excellent teammates. Since Assault Vest Toxapex's physical bulk is rather lacking, physically defensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Corviknight can offer much-needed switch-ins to the likes of Kingambit and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Toxapex can often struggle to make progress against bulkier teams due to its middling power and lack of Toxic, so it appreciates strong balance wallbreakers like Iron Valiant. Hydreigon deserves special mention as an excellent teammate, sharing near-perfect type synergy with Toxapex. Hydreigon checks key threats to Toxapex such as Armarouge, Kingambit, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and it can set up on bulkier Pokemon like defensive Great Tusk and Clodsire. In return, Toxapex can check Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Greninja, which can threaten Hydreigon. Finally, Scream Tail is also a great partner, using Wish to extend Toxapex's longevity and having solid defensive synergy with it.</p>"

Its typing in particular allows it to check common Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Urshifu-R while its utility moves like Knock Off and Toxic let it cripple them to benefit teammates. Scald can cripple physical attackers like Garchomp and Mega Medicham, discouraging them from directly switching in to take advantage of Toxapex. Scald’s damage output reduces Toxapex's passivity and is also just enough to threaten Water-weak foes like Landorus-T, Iron Boulder, and Mega Diancie; this allows Toxapex to use Recover or Toxic with general safety. Knock Off allows Toxapex to remove valuable items like Choice items, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Leftovers from switch-ins like Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and Ferrothorn. Toxic Spikes allows Toxapex to pressure offensive teams, forcing them to give up momentum to clear it lest they get poisoned. Haze prevents setup sweepers like Gouging Fire and Iron Valiant from exploiting Toxapex, forcing them to attack, and disrupts wincons like IronPress Zamazenta and Volcarona. An EV spread of 248 HP / 212 Def / 48 SpD with a Bold nature allows Toxapex to maximize its physical bulk while surviving two Scorching Sands from Mega Charizard Y. On the other hand, 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature simply maximizes special bulk. 248 HP EVs are important as it reduces entry hazard damage while benefiting more from Regenerator. Tera Dragon is useful to check Ogerpon-W and Mega Charizard Y, the latter of which is especially important on specially defensive sets, Tera Fairy helps versus Raging Bolt and Garchomp, and Tera Steel lets it check Serperior and Tapu Lele. The former two are also notable for removing Toxapex’s Ground weakness versus the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Toxapex, by nature of being a fat wall with little offensive presence, fits like a glove on stall and balance playstyles, sapping momentum but providing valuable utility. Allies on balance that can take advantage of Toxapex through double switches, like Ogerpon-W, Urshifu-R, and Mega Tyranitar, benefit from Toxapex baiting in Ground- and Psychic-types; by using Toxapex as a mid-ground, they can enter the field safely as the opponent switches to a Toxapex check like Gliscor and Choice item Tapu Lele. Teammates that help with the Ground and Psychic weaknesses on the defensive side, such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, are useful as well; in return, Toxapex tanks hits from Ice- and Fighting-types like Weavile, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny for them.</p>"

Overqwil, while not as specially bulky as Alolan Muk, can also deter Psychic- and Ghost-types, soft check physical Iron Valiant and check physical Dragapult thanks to Intimidate, and benefit much more from Toxic Spikes with Barb Barrage. Amoonguss is a second Regenerator physical wall with a neutrality to Ground and resistance to Electric able to combat many Pokemon that threaten Toxapex such as Great Tusk, Quagsire, Rotom-W and Regieleki. Clodsire is an Unaware special wall immune to Electric that checks attack threats like Regieleki and Magnezone along with special setup Pokemon like Volcarona and Hydreigon. Air Balloon Glimmora can support Toxapex by removing entry hazards from the field for non-Heavy-Duty Boots sets, being temporarily immune to Ground with Air Balloon, and using Corrosion Toxic to put threats Toxapex majorly dislikes such as opposing Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra and Heatran on timers. Corrosion Salazzle can also provide Corrosion Toxic support along with using Encore to mess up Pokemon that view Toxapex as a setup opportunity like Kingambit. Sneasler can also be used to punch holes through teams thanks to its powerful STAB Close Combat, which can KO threats like Iron Treads and Baxcalibur, while Toxapex can come in and absorb damage for Sneasler and wear foes down with Infestation and Toxic Spikes.</p>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With the rise of powerful defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Dragonite, Toxapex stands out as a masterful spreader of poison to support its teammates!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic is the most reliable way to spread the deadliest version of poison and is especially effective against Taunt users like Annihilape if using Mental Herb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Toxic Spikes makes the team less reliant on Toxapex to spread status directly, and acts as excellent support for stalling teammates like Ting-Lu, Dragonite and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Haze</strong>: Even with Toxapex's great bulk, powerful setup sweepers like Chien-Pao and Dragonite quickly get out of control for it, so Haze is the best solution to prevent Toxapex from being setup bait.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Liquidation versus Chilling Water</strong>: Liqudation isn't particularly strong but it allows Toxapex to 2HKO Chi-Yu and is the best option for breaking Substitute against targets like Flutter Mane. Chilling Water with a Bold or Impish nature gives Toxapex another tool against physical sweepers, but makes it much more vulnerable to Substitute in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Baneful Bunker</strong>: If using Black Sludge or Leftovers, Baneful Bunker is a fantastic way to spread poison against physical attackers and get some extra recovery with one moveslot, but keep in mind that this won't work against Urshifu-R. It's also key for scouting dangerous uses of Trick from the likes of Gholdengo and Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Physically Defensive versus Specially Defensive</strong>: Physically defensive Toxapex does well against some hard-to-check threats, such as Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao. Specially defensive Toxapex, on the other hand, has a better shot of beating Heatran and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Infestation</strong>: Infestation is Toxapex's best chance of doing chip damage to Toxic-immune threats, such as Corviknignt and Gholdengo, and the trapping works fairly well against foes that do have problems with Toxic. It also prevents double switching from being an issue for Toxapex.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization can help Toxapex beat a new set of threats, its bulk and good defensive typing usually makes it a rare occurrence compared to its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Besides making Toxapex far less vulnerable to Electric, which some foes like Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur may Terastallize into, Tera Poison retains the ability to restore health with Black Sludge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy removes all of Toxapex's weaknesses and can save it from taking massive damage from Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse. It also does well against powerful Dragon-type attacks such as Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage and Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass can prevent Breloom and Amoonguss from being disastrous with Spore, in addition to doing well against Rotom-W. It also gives an important Ground-type resistance against targets such as Ting-Lu and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While Normal isn't an impressive defensive type, Tera Normal can punish Choice locked Ghost-types, such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: While the Stealth Rock weakness can be an issue, Tera Bug is a niche way to resist Ground-type attacks while being neutral to both Ice- and Electric-type moves, unlike other methods.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying not only protects Toxapex from its irritating Ground-type weakness but also means bulky users of Fissure, such as Dondozo and Ting-Lu, will no longer pressure Toxapex. However, this typing makes Toxapex much worse into general offense.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Black Sludge versus Leftovers</strong>: Having passive healing is wonderful, especially with Baneful Bunker. Black Sludge is a clever way to get around Item Clause, but Leftovers gives Toxapex more freedom in choosing its Tera type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: While Urshifu-R often has contact protection, other physical attackers such as Chien-Pao can be gradually worn down through Rocky Helmet chip.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: With Mental Herb providing one-time protection from Taunt, Toxapex can surprise foes like Annihilape and Ting-Lu with Toxic, which is especially helpful if not running an attack.</p> </li> </ul>"

Toxic targets foes that commonly run Heavy-Duty Boots or are Ground immune like Cinderace and Galarian Zapdos, while Toxic Spikes provides excellent team support; Corrosion variants should always run Toxic to punish common switch-ins like Corviknight and Hisuian Goodra that otherwise might use Toxapex as free recovery. Prankster + Haze, on the other hand, is an excellent tool to frustrate hyper offense teams and stop dangerous setup sweepers like Chien-Pao, Polteageist, and Chesnaught. While the consistent recovery of Black Sludge is generally preferred, Rocky Helmet allows Toxapex to annoy non-Magic Guard Galarian Zapdos and Chien-Pao even when it is forced to use Recover. Toxapex is utterly unable to threaten most Magic Guard users, like Galarian Zapdos and especially Water-resistant ones like Hisuian Electrode and Quaquaval, so reliable checks to them like Hisuian Goodra and Fluffy Corviknight are recommended. Toxic Spikes variants appreciate spinners like Iron Treads, as they can provide entry hazard removal without removing Toxic Spikes as well. Toxapex can easily be overwhelmed by multiple attackers, so it should always have a secondary physically defensive teammate, especially one that handles Ground-types, like Intimidate Corviknight; this also relieves some of the pressure off of Toxapex of checking pivots without Regenerator.</p>"

Scald burns physical attackers such as Dragonite and Mega Lopunny, as well as Garchomp and Mega Gallade attempting to switch in. Poison Jab threatens Fairy- and Grass-types like Tapu Bulu, Iron Valiant, and Rillaboom. Toxic Spikes enhances offensive teammates such as Barraskewda, Mega Swampert, and Greninja, while Toxic lessens Toxapex's passivity, putting Gastrodon, Tornadus-T, and Mega Altaria on a timer. Haze allows Toxapex to shut down setup sweepers like Mega Scizor, Mimikyu, and Mega Altaria. Knock Off bothers item-reliant walls such as Porygon2, Galarian Corsola, and Celesteela. Black Sludge allows Toxapex to outlast tankier foes with the help of chip damage from Toxic Spikes and Toxic, while Heavy-Duty Boots enables it as a pivot, letting it sponge attacks without worrying about entry hazards. Teammates appreciate Toxapex absorbing Toxic Spikes and fighting off Grass-types like Meowscarada and Breloom. Toxapex appreciates Slowking and Rotom-W taking Psychic- and Ground-type moves, respectively. Mega Swampert switches into Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Magnezone and threatens Poison-types like opposing Toxapex, Clodsire, and Nidoking. Gastrodon forms a great defensive core with Toxapex, taking on the aforementioned Electric-types and providing entry hazards to further chip down pivots such as Meowscarada, Mega Lopunny, and Iron Moth. Greninja checks Ground-types like Clodsire, Garchomp, and Landorus and aids in the Flying matchup. Urshifu-R checks Pokemon like Kyurem and Hydreigon, which take advantage of Toxapex. Pelipper provides a Ground immunity against Landorus-T, Iron Treads, and Great Tusk and synergizes well with Toxapex against Grass teams.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Toxapex is a main-stay on Poison teams due to its defensive typing, impeccable ability, ridiculous bulk, and utility moves like Toxic, Knock Off, and Haze. Scald allows Toxapex to spread burns on physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Mega Scizor. Toxic puts threats like Rotom-W, Baxcalibur, and Urshifu-R on a timer and spreads chip damage on offensive teams like Dragon, Psychic, and Fire. Knock Off is another great option to bother Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Celesteela. Haze, paired with Icium Z, shuts down setup sweepers like Z-Happy Hour Jirachi and Clangorous Soulblaze Kommo-o, immediately regaining its health to continue walling them. Toxic Spikes are an option instead of Toxic or Knock Off; however, Toxapex has other teammates capable of setting them up and it increases Toxapex's passivity. The given EV spread avoids an OHKO from +1 SpA Jirachi's Psychic, allowing Toxapex to activate its Z-Crystal. Mega Venusaur and Crobat are excellent teammates due to their Ground-type neutrality and immunity, respectively, checking Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Mamoswine, while the former also threatens Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire. Due to Toxapex's Psychic-type weakness, Alolan Muk and Galarian Slowking are notable teammates, checking Tapu Lele, Deoxys-S, and Latias; Galarian Slowking, in particular, forms a very strong Regenerator core with Toxapex. Clodsire and Nidoking patch up Toxapex's Electric-type weakness, and Nidoking specifically threatens Steel teams with its wide array of coverage. Galarian Weezing provides another Ground-type immunity and removes entry hazards with Defog as well as serving as a concrete answer to Baxcalibur. Sneasler appreciates Toxapex's ability to chip down foes, offering more opportunities for setup. Iron Moth threatens Steel-types like Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Gholdengo, which are otherwise difficult to break for Poison teams.</p>"

Infestation chips away at foes immune to Toxic, like Zacian-C, while Poison Jab hits Taunt Arceus-Fairy for decent damage and threatens to inflict it with poison. Baneful Bunker is a more niche option for the second moveslot that potentially poisons foes like Koraidon and Arceus at the risk of letting them set up. Toxic is more immediately threatening, but Toxic Spikes can potentially aid offensive teammates and annoy teams in the long term. Rocky Helmet punishes Koraidon for spamming U-turn and gives non-Infestation Toxapex a way of damaging Zacian-C. Tera Fairy provides an immunity to Koraidon's Scale Shot and Outrage and removes Toxapex's weakness to Ground-type moves from foes like Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground. Toxapex is primarily useful on balance teams, where Pokemon like Calyrex-S, Arceus, Arceus-Fairy, Miraidon, and Zacian-C benefit from it being able to switch into opposing Arceus, Zacian-C, and Choice Scarf Koraidon. Choice Specs Calyrex-S is an especially good teammate for Toxic Spikes Toxapex, as it threatens foes that can absorb Toxic Spikes, like Eternatus and opposing Toxapex, and can use Trick to remove a Pokemon's Heavy-Duty Boots. Arceus-Ground similarly threatens Poison-types, and it wears down the only relevant Defog user, Giratina-O. Arceus is also worth highlighting for its ability to check Calyrex-S and revenge kill weakened Scale Shot Koraidon. Ting-Lu appreciates Toxapex checking strong physical attackers, and it checks Calyrex-S, Miraidon, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground for it in return. Choice Scarf Koraidon can revenge kill the Pokemon Ting-Lu checks as well as Wild Charge Zacian-C and Taunt Arceus, which Toxapex loses to.</p>"

Furthermore, Mimikyu with its Disguise up can check opposing Ghost-type Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Iron Valiant is also one of Mimikyu's best offensive teammates, as special sets are able to threaten other physically defensive Pokemon like Dondozo. Additionally, Iron Valiant is useful for Mimikyu in the Ground matchup, where a Choice Specs set can check answers to Mimikyu, such as Quagsire and Clodsire, using Psyshock. Azumarill can use Belly Drum against Steel teams and weaken foes like Orthworm and revenge kill Iron Treads with Aqua Jet.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Mimikyu is a staple on Ghost-type teams, as Disguise allows it to deal with Dark-types and faster threats such as Barraskewda. Swords Dance can further take advantage of Disguise. Play Rough threatens Dark- and Fighting-types such as Meowscarada, Krookodile, and Quaquaval. Shadow Sneak picks off faster threats that could otherwise revenge kill Mimikyu, such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane. Drain Punch helps against Steel-types like Kingambit and offers some recovery—Disguise's recoil, entry hazards, and Life Orb damage can wear Mimikyu down pretty easily. Wood Hammer can potentially be used over Drain Punch to hit Pokemon such as Quagsire better, but the recoil damage isn't appreciated. Mimikyu's mediocre Attack forces it to use Life Orb to significantly damage neutral targets.</p> <p>All of Mimikyu's teammates appreciate its ability to take on Dark-type teams. Froslass and Brambleghast can place Spikes to help Mimikyu clean up and use Taunt or Rapid Spin, respectively, so opposing entry hazards don't wear it down. Choice Scarf Flutter Mane helps Mimikyu against both Dark- and Dragon-type teams by taking down faster threats that could KO it after Disguise has been removed, such as Meowscarada and Chien-Pao, which resist Shadow Sneak. Nasty Plot Gholdengo deals with bulkier teams like Ground and Poison teams, as well as absorbing Toxic from bulky walls such as Toxapex. Furthermore, Gholdengo can also run Trick with a Choice item, which can cripple annoying walls such as Quagsire and Dondozo to help Mimikyu deal with them. Polteageist can clean up Poison teams after Skuntank is KOed, as well as Ground, Water, and Fighting teams. Spiritomb can tank some Dark-type attacks so that Mimikyu needn't waste Disguise's protection. Skeledirge can take some hits from foes like Iron Valiant and Dragalge for the same benefit. Dragapult can use a Dragon Dance set to boost against faster Pokemon that threaten Mimikyu, such as Iron Moth.</p>"

Clanging Scales is Kommo-o's best move for Pokemon like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Gliscor.

Taunt allows Kommo-o to block status moves from defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Swampert, and Gliscor, preventing them from resetting its boosts with Haze or statusing it with Toxic. Alternatively, Clangorous Soul powers up Kommo-o without using its Z-Move, letting its Clangorous Soulblaze outright OHKO Toxapex and Hippowdon, at the cost of longevity.

Additionally, Drain Punch is Kommo-o's best move to hit Ditto, as it copies its ability Soundproof. Flamethrower targets Fighting-resistant or -immune Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Aegislash. Taunt is preferred to shut down phazers like Haze Toxapex and Hippowdon and bulky walls like Porygon2 and Clodsire, which can inconvenience Kommo-o with Toxic. Meanwhile, Clangorous Soul allows for more boosts and breaking power, notably enabling Clangorous Soulblaze to OHKO the aforementioned Hippowdon and Toxapex. Furthermore, Clangorous Soulblaze allows Kommo-o to set up on Fairy-types and Soundproof Pokemon like Alolan Ninetales, Trace Porygon2, and opposing Kommo-o. Soundproof prevents revenge killing attempts from Ditto or opposing Kommo-o, and a Naive nature permits Kommo-o to outpace Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Lopunny, and Zeraora after obtaining the omni-boost. Mega Altaria is a wonderful teammate, as it helps weaken and clean up opposing Dragon teams; In return, it appreciates Kommo-o dealing with the aforementioned Steel-types. Kyurem aids in matchups against Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Mantine, and Dragonite, as well as Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Tapu Fini, and Mega Altaria. Choice Scarf Latias and Roaring Moon provide speed control; the former offers healing and setup opportunities with Healing Wish, while the latter checks Psychic-types like Deoxys-S, Victini, and Latias. Garchomp offers entry hazards support to pressure and chip down Kommo-o's switch-ins and aids in the Steel matchup with Earthquake. Hisuian Goodra is a huge help in the Fairy matchup, taking on Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Mega Diancie. Mega Latios threatens Flying-type threats with its BoltBeam coverage; in addition, when paired with Garchomp, it puts a lot of pressure on Poison teams, which Kommo-o tends to struggle against. Cyclizar provides entry hazard control with Rapid Spin and extra protection for Kommo-o with Shed Tail, encouraging the use of Clangorous Soul over Taunt. Baxcalibur is excellent in the Dark and Flying matchups, dispatching threats like Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Enamorus with its Swords Dance or Dragon Dance set, and it also ravages Poison teams with Galarian Slowking, which Kommo-o might not be able to handle. In return, Kommo-o removes the aforementioned Steel- and Normal-types that can easily wall Baxcalibur or use it to reverse sweep, specifically Ditto.</p>"

Throat Spray grants an extra Special Attack boost when using Clangorous Soul, whereas Kommonium Z gives it Clangorous Soulblaze, which allows it to deal heavy damage while boosting its stats. Boomburst lets Kommo-o neutrally hit much of the metagame for large damage, which, when coupled with STAB Clanging Scales and Flamethrower as coverage for Steel-types, can easily break cores featuring the likes of Great Tusk, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and more.

However, Kommo-o likes to use its Tera and thus denies its teammates this option, and it can be checked by a well-timed Tera from Pokemon such as Tera Steel Garchomp and subsequently be revenge killed. It is also walled by the likes of Heatran, Garganacl, and Clodsire, which can tank its coverage options even without Terastallizing and cripple it with Toxic or Salt Cure or simply force it out and deny future setup opportunities. Finally, due to the nature of Kommo-o’s setup, it can only reasonably do so once per game, making Kommo-o more suited for offensive teams. Thus, having allies that can take care of Kommo-o’s defensive checks before it sets up can allow it to do its job much more effectively; physical attackers like Iron Valiant, offensive Landorus-T, and Samurott-H can pressure and remove checks for Kommo-o to break and potentially sweep. Hazard support is also valuable in preventing opponents from switching back and forth between Pokemon in a Regenerator core; in particular, Assault Vest Tornadus + Toxapex; Pokemon like Great Tusk and Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock to pressure switches.</p>"

          "description": "<p>With Belly Drum, Kommo-o becomes a fearsome sweeper capable of wiping unprepared teams with relative ease. The HP cuts from Substitute and Belly Drum will immediately activate Salac Berry, giving Kommo-o maximum Attack along with increased Speed to sweep offensive and defensive teams alike. Substitute also allows Kommo-o to dodge status moves like Ferrothorn’s Leech Seed, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Landorus-T's Toxic, and Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp that could potentially ruin Kommo-o’s sweep, instead giving it a free set up opportunity. Drain Punch is chosen over heavier hitting moves like Close Combat, as the extra damage is not needed, and Drain Punch can heal off the HP lost through Belly Drum and Substitute, making Kommo-o harder to revenge kill. Thunder Punch is used to dent and possibly KO common defensive tanks that can survive Drain Punch, like Skarmory, Toxapex, Tera Water Garganacl, Gholdengo, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Bulletproof stacked on top of Tera Steel allows Kommo-o to surprise opponents like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Specs Dragapult looking to revenge kill it. Although Soundproof blocks moves such as Roar from defensive Garchomp and Bug Buzz from Volcarona, it is generally not preferred due to the lack of relevant sound-based moves in comparison to the bevy of aforementioned qualities gained from Bulletproof. Tera Electric can power up Thunder Punch with STAB to score KOs on the likes of Gholdengo, Tapu Lele, and Tera Fairy Kingambit, while Tera Steel gives it useful resistances that may allow it to reach Salac Berry range without Substitute by tanking a resisted hit from the likes of Tapu Lele or Mega Diancie. Belly Drum Kommo-o fits on hyper offensive teams that appreciate its ability to sweep or clean up teams once its checks are removed. Therefore, it appreciates partners that can lure and remove Pokemon like Clodsire, Tera Grass Heatran, Gliscor, and Landorus-T that check it; Tapu Koko in particular is good, as it can run Hidden Power Ice to bait and KO the latter two and badly chip the former two potentially into Kommo-o’s range while also boosting the power of its Thunder Punch by setting Electric Terrain. Belly Drum Kommo-o also has trouble setting up, as it mainly uses the element of surprise to get up a Substitute —namely, it exploits the opponent's fear of Clangorous Soulblaze and thus forces them to switch. Thus, it appreciates dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl in order to more consistently set up Belly Drum.</p>"

Tapu Koko further boasts a good Speed tier and valuable Fairy-typing, rendering it a menacing threat in its own right. Dazzling Gleam levels the playing field in the Dragon matchup, eliminating foes such as Kommo-o, Roaring Moon, Baxcalibur, and Mega Altaria, but it's also useful against threats like Mega Lopunny and non-Choice Scarf Great Tusk. Grass Knot provides much needed coverage against troublesome Ground-types, most notably taking care of Swampert, Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Mamoswine. Volt Switch pairs wells with Tapu Koko's speed, allowing it to escape unfavorable matchups and bring in teammates like Zapdos against the likes of Mega Venusaur or Mega Scizor. Hidden Power Ice can be used to deal with Ground-types that aren't threatened by Grass Knot such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be run to increase Tapu Koko's damage output, giving it a chance to OHKO foes like Mega Diancie. Rotom-W and Zapdos are excellent partners to Tapu Koko, as they provide a necessary Ground immunity as well as Defog support, which allows Tapu Koko to pivot more freely. Rotom-W further helps by handling Ground-types and spreading burns to strong physical attackers like Mega Garchomp, Iron Valiant, Dragonite, and Mega Swampert in rain, while Zapdos walls and makes use of Heat Wave to deal with Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Iron Treads and Hurricane to counter pesky Grass- and Fighting-types like Tapu Bulu, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Gallade. Alolan Raichu's Surge Surfer fully capitalizes on Electric Terrain, turning it into a serious revenge killer, capable of outspeeding threats such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Mega Aerodactyl, and Iron Valiant under Quark Drive. Iron Hands and Zeraora are prominent partners for Tapu Koko complementing it as Physical breakers, both being able to take care of foes such as defensive Zapdos, Ursaluna and Alolan Muk which hinder Tapu Koko and other Special attackers. Iron Hands has more bulk and longevity, but Zeraora brings near unmatched Speed to the table. Both of them also appreciate Tapu Koko's ability to remove Mega Sableye and Skeledirge and luring in and critically damaging Landorus-Therian with Hidden Power Ice. Regieleki brings raw Electric-type power in the form of a boosted Rising Voltage, which is capable of sweeping teams that don't have an answer to it, and it also provides hazard removal thanks to Rapid Spin. Magnezone provides an immunity to Poison, which Tapu Koko appreciates, and more importantly traps and removes threats such as Mega Scizor and Excadrill with Hidden Power Fire.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Boasting a great Speed tier and solid coverage, Tapu Koko not only provides Electric Terrain to enable Iron Valiant, but also provides a means to deal with Flying's defensive core for Fairy teams thanks to its access to Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice. Thunderbolt is Tapu Koko's most spammable attack, which it uses to eliminate roadblocks such as Corviknight, Celesteela, and Toxapex, but Discharge can be used to spread paralysis against faster foes. Hidden Power Ice threatens Ground-types such as Landorus and Gliscor. U-turn is its preferred pivot option, as Tapu Koko lures in Ground-types like Ursaluna and Great Tusk that block Volt Switch, which Iron Valiant and Tapu Bulu can then handle. That said, it can also run Toxic to wear down walls like Zapdos and Hippowdon, or Taunt to shut down entry hazard and dual screens setters like Klefki, Jirachi, and Galvantula or setup sweepers like Volcarona. Roost extends Tapu Koko's longevity and thus its opportunities to pivot. Heavy-Duty Boots pairs well with Tapu Koko's role as a pivot, but Expert Belt increases its chances to OHKO Landorus with Hidden Power Ice and Toxapex with Thunderbolt. Tapu Koko's partner in crime on Fairy teams is Iron Valiant, which appreciates being pivoted into for Quark Drive to be activated and returns the favor by dealing with Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra, and even some Poison-types like Alolan Muk and Mega Venusaur when using a Fightinium Z and Psychium Z, respectively. Mega Diancie provides some form of hazard control with Magic Bounce, which Tapu Koko especially appreciates if it's not running Heavy-Duty Boots, and it can handle troublesome Flying- and Fire-types such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Klefki is another great partner, as it sets up screens, allowing Tapu Koko to pivot more freely, and provides a valuable immunity to Poison. Tapu Lele and Tapu Bulu serve as powerful wallbreakers that can weaken the opposing team to allow Tapu Koko to clean late-game. Tapu Lele handles foes such as Clodsire, Mega Venusaur, Nidoking, and even Mega Scizor when running Hidden Power Fire, while Tapu Bulu powers through Ground-types that don't fear Tapu Koko's Hidden Power Ice, such as Mega Swampert, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Belly Drum Azumarill also helps in the Ground matchup,and it can utilize its priority move Aqua Jet to eliminate faster threats such as Gengar and Nihilego.</p>"

Grass Knot hits foes such as Gastrodon, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Swampert, and it takes advantage of Tera Grass to potentially break Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam allows Tapu Koko to OHKO Mega Medicham and Weavile after Stealth Rock, and it dents other foes such as Tera Dragon Toxapex and Garchomp. Hidden Power Ice improves the matchup against Landorus-T and Gliscor while still hitting foes such as Garchomp, Tangrowth, and Dragonite. Tera Grass boosts the power of Grass Knot while granting Tapu Koko key resistances, allowing it to lure foes such as Barraskewda, Floatzel, and Mega Swampert, all while improving its matchup against Rotom-W. Tapu Koko must be careful when using Tera, however, as it becomes unable to safely switch into Tornadus-T once it Terastallizes. Pokemon that utilize Electric Terrain such as Iron Valiant, Iron Hands, and Mega Medicham make for excellent teammates, as it activates Quark Drive for the former two and increases the power of Thunder Punch for the latter, 2HKOing foes such as Gholdengo. Tapu Koko also forms strong pivoting cores with teammates like Tornadus-T and Mega Lopunny, which take advantage of its checks such as Ferrothorn and Clodsire to generate momentum. Wallbreakers such as Weavile, Urshifu-R, and Zamazenta also appreciate Tapu Koko letting them switch in against its checks for free, such as Assault Vest Tangrowth. In return, they beat foes such as the aforementioned Tangrowth, Clodsire and Ferrothorn.</p>"

It also prevents foes such as Dragonite and Volcarona from using Tapu Koko as setup fodder. U-turn allows Tapu Koko to generate momentum and pivot into teammates such as Volcarona and Dragapult after setting screens. Tapu Koko will very rarely use Tera since teammates such as Dragonite or Volcarona rely on it to be effective. In a pinch, however, Tera Flying offers a Ground immunity for foes such as Clodsire. Pokemon that take advantage of dual screens, such as Volcarona, Dragonite, and Dragapult, are good partners, as they allow them to set up safely and survive potential revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Kingambit, and Mega Scizor. Iron Valiant also benefits greatly from Tapu Koko setting Electric Terrain in addition to dual screens. Tapu Koko is also weak to Stealth Rock setters such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, and it can have difficulty denying entry hazards from them, so it appreciates teammates such as Dragonite and Gyarados pivoting in to Ground-type attacks from them.</p>"

Its decent Speed tier and astounding offensive prowess combined with its great typing makes it extremely threatening because with access to STAB Moonblast, it is Psychic's best check to most Dark-type threats. Tapu Lele's presence also sets up Psychic Terrain, shielding itself and its team from dangerous priority such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. Focus Blast lets it easily take care of the pesky Steel-types that resist its STAB attacks such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Iron Treads. Future Sight lets Tapu Lele set up an attack for later and then switch out to a teammate such as Victini or Mega Gallade to help it set up or get a KO. Shadow Ball lets it beat Gholdengo and clean up against Psychic and Ghost teams, while Thunderbolt gives it general coverage versus foes like Mantine and Celesteela. Tapu Lele is often not able to beat specially defensive walls such as Alolan Muk and Blissey; hence, it appreciates partnering up with Mega Gallade to eliminate them. Mega Alakazam is a good partner, as it helps in the Electric and Water matchups courtesy of Trace copying Surge Surfer and Swift Swim, respectively, and it appreciates Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain boosting its Expanding Force. Slowbro sponges hits from faster Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Galarian Zapdos, and can also pivot Tapu Lele in with Teleport to wreak havoc. Victini and Armarouge can eliminate Steel-types, especially Aegislash and Gholdengo, easing the burden for Tapu Lele. Jirachi can slow teams down with Thunder Wave and pivot Tapu Lele into physical walls such as Mandibuzz and Slowbro with U-turn.</p>"

Psychic is its preferred Psychic-type STAB move, which it uses to take out Poison-types such as Toxapex, Nidoking, and Mega Venusaur, though it can also run Psyshock to hit Clodsire harder. Moonblast deals with Dark- and Dragon-types like Mega Sableye, Galarian Moltres, Kommo-o, and Latias. Focus Blast checks threats such as Heatran and Iron Treads. Hidden Power Fire OHKOes most Mega Scizor sets, while Thunderbolt threatens a wider selection of Water- and Flying-types like Celesteela, Mantine, and Mega Charizard Y. Shadow Ball could also be used to provide coverage against Aegislash and Gholdengo. Thanks to Psychic Surge, Tapu Lele shuts down priority moves from revenge killers and setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, Azumarill's Aqua Jet, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, allowing it to KO them with Hidden Power Fire, Thunderbolt, and Moonblast, respectively. Choice Scarf allows Tapu Lele to outspeed threats such as Zeraora, Choice Scarf Excadrill, Tapu Koko, and Mega Lopunny. Tapu Lele pairs well with wallbreakers like Tapu Bulu and Azumarill that can weaken or eliminate its checks, with the former taking care of Meowscarada, Rotom-W, and Gastrodon, while the latter handles Volcarona, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Landorus. Tapu Koko helps in the Water- and Flying-type matchups by dealing with Landorus and Corviknight and offers a great Speed tier and coverage. Iron Valiant answers Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra and uses All-Out Pummeling to eliminate Dark-types like Alolan Muk, one of the best counters to Tapu Lele, and Ting-Lu, which could tank a few hits from Tapu Lele and threaten it with Poison Jab or Heavy Slam. The duo of Tapu Koko and Iron Valiant further assists Tapu Lele's late-game cleaning, as Tapu Koko activates Iron Valiant's Quark Drive, allowing it to outspeed common Choice Scarf users that are faster than Tapu Lele like Terrakion, Blacephalon, and Nihilego. Klefki's utility moves, such as Spikes, Thunder Wave, and dual screens, make it an excellent supporting partner. Thanks to Foul Play, Klefki is also able to answer bulky Swords Dance Mega Scizor, which could otherwise tank a Hidden Power Fire from Tapu Lele and KO it. Mega Diancie contributes to keeping Tapu Lele healthy by threatening hazard setters with Magic Bounce as well as Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, which can be troublesome to deal with for Tapu Lele. Mimikyu is a great partner in the Ghost matchup, being able to threaten fast foes such as Blacephalon. Ribombee's Sticky Web allows Tapu Lele to outrun faster Choice Scarf users such as Sneasler, Iron Valiant, and Gengar.</p>"

Psyshock allows Tapu Lele to hit foes with weaker Defense stats like Assault Vest Tornadus-T and Volcarona, along with shutting down Calm Mind Tera Poison Cresselia.

Psyshock can hit Galarian Slowking, 2HKO Chansey, and OHKO Assault Vest Tornadus-T. Future Sight can help teammates like Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny wallbreak, as it deals good damage to switch-ins like Alomomola, Toxapex, and Landorus-T.

Additionally, it struggles against common revenge killers such as Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Lopunny. Therefore, a strong defensive core is recommended when building around Tapu Lele to minimize the impact of these offensive threats, especially having a switch-in to the aforementioned Steel-types that may come in on a Psychic or Moonblast.

          "description": "<p>Tapu Fini's solid typing, good bulk, and vast utility make it an excellent defensive presence in the metagame, holding the tier together against numerous Pokemon, such as Latios, Mega Tyranitar, and Keldeo. Misty Surge makes it excellent at regaining momentum against status users, such as Clefable and Blissey, allowing setup teammates like Mega Tyranitar to more freely set up against these Pokemon. Scald provides Tapu Fini with a STAB move that can burn the likes of Celesteela and Tapu Bulu attempting to take advantage of it while also letting it apply pressure to targets such as Iron Moth and Victini. Alternatively, Nature's Madness allows Tapu Fini to hit defensive Pokemon it would otherwise be unable to punish for switching in, Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Defog keeps entry hazards off against walls that its typing enables it to match up well against, like Skarmory. Taunt, besides preventing the aforementioned Pokemon from relaying hazards in front of Tapu Fini, also denies healing and setup attempts from Pokemon like Clefable and Blissey, particularly when used in combination with Nature's Madness to more quickly wear down said targets. 96 Speed EVs ensure that Tapu Fini outruns Adamant Scizor, letting it shut down potential Swords Dance attempts against it, while the rest is put into Defense to maximize its walling capabilities against Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Psyshock Latios, and Excadrill. Defog Tapu Fini fits onto many bulky offense and balance teams for its valuable role compression. Tapu Fini is prone to being overwhelmed and lacks any form of healing outside of Leftovers, which makes other defensive Pokemon that can support it against the aforementioned threats extremely valuable; these include Pokemon such as Skarmory and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Wish users such as Jirachi and Blissey are also highly noticeable in this regard for their ability to keep Tapu Fini healthy throughout the game in addition to synergizing with it immensely by handling special attackers that can threaten Tapu Fini, such as Alakazam. Other defensive Pokemon like Buzzwole and Mega Aggron benefit from Tapu Fini's ability to clear hazards, allowing them to more safely leverage their HP to check the threats they are meant to deal with. Finally, powerful offensive Pokemon that appreciate Misty Terrain's effects, like Bisharp and Choice Band Tyranitar, also enjoy being able to fall back on Tapu Fini to deal with offensive threats like Keldeo and clear hazards, improving their potential to wallbreak throughout the game.</p>"

Additionally, Tapu Fini can still uphold its natural defensive qualities and bulk to switch into other threats like Victini and Latios when needed, before outspeeding and threatening them too, while also providing Defog support. Hydro Pump is Tapu Fini's strongest move to hit Iron Moth and Excadrill with, OHKOing both after Stealth Rock damage, but Surf can be used instead if accuracy is a concern despite having less power. Trick allows Tapu Fini to cripple an incoming wall that would normally try to take advantage of it, like Blissey and Amoonguss. Defog allows Tapu Fini to clear entry hazards for its team in a pinch, especially once it has Tricked away its Choice Scarf, but if Defog is already found on another Pokemon, Taunt and Nature's Madness are options that can be used instead to further mess with most defensive Pokemon, chipping them down quickly or denying healing attempts. The given EV spread ensures that Tapu Fini survives a +2 Acrobatics from Hawlucha and outspeeds Mega Aerodactyl. Tapu Fini fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its defensive utility and role compression. Wallbreakers that benefit from its ability to check faster offensive threats like Keldeo and Galarian Zapdos include Pokemon such as Choice Band Tyranitar and Mega Heracross, with each additionally benefiting from Misty Terrain's status immunity. On the other hand, Tapu Fini's tendency to lure in defensive Pokemon that it can Trick its Choice Scarf over to, like Blissey and Chansey, can be exploited by Pokemon that normally struggle to break past them, such as Iron Moth and Nasty Plot Hydreigon. As Tapu Fini can struggle to check threats like Latios and Victini in the long run, other Pokemon like Celesteela and Galarian Moltres can help provide extra insurance against these Pokemon.</p>"

Tapu Fini best fits on bulky offense and balance teams that want an end-game wincon, supporting wallbreaking teammates such as Iron Hands and Mega Tyranitar. It's overwhelmed by fast offensive foes that can hit it super effectively such as Thundurus-T and Iron Moth. Teammates like Mega Venusaur can check Thundurus-T while Iron Moth checks opposing Iron Moth.

It can outspeed and revenge kill foes like Mega Lopunny, Dragapult, Garchomp, and Iron Valiant while using its typing and remarkable bulk to switch into Pokemon like Heatran, Weavile, and Urshifu-R. Other than shutting down problematic setup sweepers like Volcarona, Trick + Taunt improves Tapu Fini's matchup against defensive Pokemon by crippling and shutting down switch-ins such as Ferrothorn, Clodsire, and Toxapex, especially with Misty Terrain to protect it and its teammates against theirs and the likes of Rotom-W, Heatran, and Gastrodon's status moves. If the team lacks an entry hazard remover, Tapu Fini can run Defog if necessary, as it matches up well against entry hazard setters like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. However, its vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards and lack of longevity make it a poor candidate to do it consistently. Ice Beam can be run to potentially 2HKO offensive Tornadus-T and OHKO Landorus-T, while Nature's Madness is an option to dent its checks hard—especially ones that lack reliable recovery—such as Ferrothorn, Galarian Slowking, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. However, forgoing Taunt or Defog loses out on Tapu Fini's utility, which makes shutting down walls and supporting its team needlessly more difficult. Tera Steel allows Tapu Fini to emergency check threats like Tapu Lele and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T; it also provides a better defensive typing against walls like Toxapex and Ferrothorn, which is more useful if using Taunt. The Speed EVs allow Tapu Fini to outspeed +1 Mega Gyarados, while the Special Attack EVs allow it to KO Urshifu-R after Stealth Rock. Gholdengo, Tornadus-T, and Ferrothorn are great teammates to deal with faster threats like boosted Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf users such as Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Landorus-T; Ferrothorn also provides Spikes to chip down foes like Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Garganacl into Tapu Fini's KO range, compensating for its middling damage output. Offensive teammates like Volcarona, Kartana, and Weavile love its Misty Terrain to protect them against debilitating status from walls like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Skeledirge, letting them set up and attack more safely; Volcarona also enjoys Tapu Fini luring in and crippling their shared checks like Toxapex and Clodsire with Trick, while Choice Band Weavile appreciates Tapu Fini removing Stealth Rock with Defog.</p>"

Buzzwole sets itself apart from other physical walls with its high Attack stat and strong moves, allowing it to exert immediate pressure against the opposing team. Close Combat is Buzzwole's STAB move of choice, as its high Base Power is preferred over alternatives like Drain Punch against threats such as Scizor and Iron Hands. Earthquake is a solid coverage move that allows Buzzwole to threaten Iron Moth, which would otherwise be able to switch in for free. The final moveslot offers a bit more flexibility, with Toxic being used the most in order to status common switch-ins such as Latios, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth. Alternatively, Thunder Punch can be utilized for more immediate pressure against Water- and Flying-types such as Tapu Fini and Enamorus. Finally, Bulk Up can be used on defensive teams to allow Buzzwole to act as a wincon. The Defense boosts can also help in one-on-one situations against other Attack-boosting threats such as Iron Hands. The Attack EVs ensure Buzzwole 2HKOs defensive Celesteela with Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage, while 112 Speed EVs allow Buzzwole to outspeed Adamant Tyranitar. This Speed benchmark is largely trivial, however, and can be adjusted to account for other specific threats such as Bisharp and Scizor. Buzzwole’s ability to switch into Ground- and Fighting-type moves is valued by Pokemon such as Excadrill and Tyranitar, and its resistance to Bug and Dark is greatly appreciated by Psychic-types such as Mega Latias and Slowking. Due to its poor special bulk, Buzzwole can quickly be overwhelmed by strong special attackers and Future Sight. Therefore, it appreciates specially defensive teammates such as Blissey and Hippowdon. Physical wallbreakers are often paired with Future Sight support; therefore, Pokemon such as Celesteela and Mega Aggron can prove helpful because of their high Defense paired with a Psychic resistance. Pokemon that can cover Buzzwole's weaknesses to Flying, Fairy, Fire, and Psychic are also greatly appreciated. As such, Mega Latias, Clefable, and Tyranitar are natural partners.</p>"

Meteor Beam combined with Power Herb lets Celesteela boost its Special Attack without needing a KO. Given that it's Celesteela's strongest attack, in some situations it should be saved to instead target a foe Celesteela would otherwise have trouble breaking through like Skeledirge or Victini. Air Slash serves as a spammable STAB attack, 2HKOing most of the tier at +1, though it can OHKO many Bug- and Grass-types like Buzzwole and Hisuian Lilligant unboosted. Its chance to flinch its foes can also come in handy against special walls like Gastrodon and Slowking, which could otherwise stop Celesteela's sweep. Fire Blast primarily targets Steel-types, OHKOing foes like Scizor unboosted and opposing Celesteela after a few boosts. Celesteela best fits on offense teams looking for a cleaner, forming a potent offensive combination with other sweepers like Iron Hands and Bisharp. Alternatively, if the opportunity arises, it can instead be used as a mid-game wallbreaker and have a teammate clean using the holes it creates. However, it has no way to break through certain special walls like Blissey and Chansey on its own, making physical attackers like Bisharp and Iron Hands necessary. While they share some overlapping counterplay, special sweepers like Booster Energy Iron Moth and Galarian Moltres also appreciate Celesteela's support for similar reasons, and they can still support each other by weakening some of each other's shared checks, such as Slowbro, Slowking, Latios, and Latias.

Heavy Slam is another vital move that allows Celesteela to pressure threats such as Mega Tyranitar, Clefable, and Enamorus. Protect is good when used with Leech Seed to further wear down threats such as Excadrill and Enamorus without Substitute while also letting it scout Choice-locked foes such as Latios and Victini. Toxic can be used over Protect on more offensive teams to make faster progress against threats such as Mega Latias, Mega Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Galarian Moltres and also wear down bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Gastrodon. Flamethrower is an important coverage move to tackle Steel- and Grass-types such as Excadrill, Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Leftovers synergizes very well with Leech Seed and Protect to recover large swaths of HP. Celesteela struggles a lot against Fire-types such as Iron Moth and Victini, so bulky Fire-resistant teammates such as Slowking, Mega Latias, and Mega Tyranitar are greatly appreciated to keep them at bay. Mega Tyranitar in particular is capable of Pursuit trapping Fire-types to deal with them.

Alternatively, Toxic may be used to put bulkier Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Gastrodon on a timer, however, without Flamethrower, Celesteela is extremely passive in front of the aforementioned Steel-types, as well as Ferrothorn and Gholdengo which are immune to Leech Seed. Giga Drain is another option to improve the Water and Ground matchups, hitting Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Slowbro as well as improving longevity, however, it's a lot more matchup reliant than the other listed options. Protect in conjunction with Leech Seed is Celesteela's main method of forcing progress, spreading chip damage while also massively boosting its longevity. The given EV spread allows Celesteela to survive two consecutive uses of Close Combat from the likes of Mega Lopunny in addition to Choice Scarf Buzzwole and Terrakion. Heatran is by far Celesteela's most advantageous teammate due to its immunity to Fire-type moves letting it take on threats such as Volcarona and Blacephalon. In return, Celesteela walls Ground-types like Clodsire and Hippowdon. Ferrothorn is an essential teammate due to its ability to check Water-types such as Barraskewda, Mega Swampert, and Rotom-W as well as provide utility in the form of entry hazards and additional Leech Seed support, wearing down teams greatly. Furthermore, Ferrothorn is a great answer to Electric-type Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Alolan Raichu. Ghost-type teammates such as Aegislash and Gholdengo alleviate the Fighting matchup, lessening the amount of pressure put onto Celesteela as a primary switch-in and also removing threats like Skeledirge, Slowbro, and Toxapex. Choice Scarf Iron Treads and Excadrill provide an immunity against the aforementioned Electric-type Pokemon, while the former checks Landorus with Ice Spinner and the latter hinders Mega Sableye with Toxic. Furthermore, Excadrill and Iron Treads are Steel's best answers to Ogerpon-H. Mega Scizor is a great pivot into Knock Off and can take on Fighting-types due to its neutrality to them and access to Roost. Assault Vest Melmetal is a great blanket check to special attackers like Tapu Koko, Kyurem, and Gholdengo, while Hisuian Goodra is an excellent sponge for Water-type attacks, walling Volcanion, Choice Specs Pelipper, and Basculegion-F.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Kartana is a threatening wallbreaker and sweeper, using its sky-high Attack stat to cut through common defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Landorus-T. Sacred Sword allows Kartana to KO common Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Kingambit. Giga Impact can be used in conjunction with Normalium Z to turn into a devastating Breakneck Blitz, slicing through Flying-type answers such as Tornadus-T, Dragonite, and Zapdos. Knock Off is an alternative to KO Gholdengo and Dragapult reliably, as well as pressure checks such as Skeledirge and Tornadus-T. If using Knock Off, Kartana opts for Fightinium Z to break through Mega Scizor. Swords Dance Kartana pairs well with physical cleaners that capitalize on it dicing up common physical walls such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Skeledirge. As such, Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Dragonite make for great partners. Kartana also pairs well with Pursuit trappers such as Mega Tyranitar, Weavile, and Kingambit, as they remove common checks such as Tornadus-T, Dragapult, and Gholdengo. Kartana appreciates having pivots that bring it in safely against passive Pokemon; Rotom-W and Tornadus-T bait in the likes of Ferrothorn and Rotom-W to allow Kartana to pivot in and setup safely. Kartana is forced out by common revenge killers such as Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny, so having teammates that can switch into them such as Tornadus-T, Slowbro, and Landorus-T are ideal.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Kartana is an incredibly dangerous late-game cleaner thanks to its Choice Scarf-boosted Speed and incredible attack. It can outspeed common setup sweepers such as Mega Gyarados and Volcarona, as well as common Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele. Knock Off removes the items of defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Toxapex in the mid-game for it to clean up later on. Sacred Sword hits Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Kingambit. Smart Strike can be used as Kartana's strongest option against Dragonite and Buzzwole. Alternatively, Defog is an option to remove entry hazards in a pinch for Kartana's team, although being locked into it is unideal. Tera Grass skyrockets Leaf Blade's damage, giving it the opportunity to snowball easily alongside Beast Boost. Choice Scarf Kartana fits best on highly offensive teams which put continuous pressure on its checks, allowing it to cleave through weakened defensive cores. Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Lele are great partners, as they weaken common defensive Steel-types, allowing Kartana to spam Leaf Blade freely. Similarly, Pursuit trappers such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar force the likes of Tornadus-T, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge to either be heavily weakened or forced to Terastallize into a type not resisting Grass, benefitting Kartana either way. Strong physical attackers such as Zamazenta, Mega Medicham, and Great Tusk weaken physical walls such as Toxapex and Landorus-T, leaving them vulnerable to Kartana.</p>"
        },
        "Bulky Defog": {
          "description": "<p>Defog Kartana is a solid entry hazard remover that can contribute to wallbreaking if used at the right time. With its impressive 181 Attack stat, Kartana is often able to force opposing entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and Clodsire out and take advantage of this to use Defog. Furthermore, its resistance to Stealth Rock and immunity to Toxic Spikes helps Kartana to switch into entry hazards multiple times. Synthesis provides Kartana with longevity, especially when paired with sun, which allows it to even outheal damage from defensive Landrous-T and Great Tusk's Earthquake. Grassium Z makes up for its loss in power and enables it to pick off weakened walls like Toxapex and Landorus-T, as well as threatening common Stealth Rock users such as Garchomp, Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Clodsire. Knock Off hits Gholdengo for super effective damage. Sacred Sword can be used as an alternative choice to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran, which Kartana otherwise struggles with. However, missing out on hitting Gholdengo makes it less helpful in the current metagame. 120 Attack EVs allow Kartana to OHKO offensive Garchomp with Bloom Doom. while the HP investment ensures that Kartana survives Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Psychic even after taking Stealth Rock damage. Mega Charizard Y has great synergy with this set, since it appreciates Kartana's ability to keep the field clear of Stealth Rock whilst also muscling through common special walls in Chansey and Clodsire. In return, Drought boosts Kartana's longevity by increasing the amount of HP Synthesis recovers. Kartana can also switch into rock moves against Mega charizard Y from opposing Garchomp and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, while Mega Charizard Y removes Steel- and Grass-Type walls such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth that this set struggles with. Due to its poor Special Defence, Kartana is vulnerable to special attackers that outspeed it, like Tornadus-T and Iron Valiant. This requires it to be paired with a good special wall that can check those threats, such as Tapu Fini or Slowking. Kartana can also struggle with entry hazard setters such as Mega Diancie, Heatran, and Skarmory due to its inability to force them out, so teammates that can limit them such as Slowking and Heatran make for good partners.</p>"

    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Necrozma-DM is one of the best Pokemon in Ubers. Between its sky-high Attack stat, high defensive stats, passable Speed, and a deep movepool, it is able to fulfill a huge variety of roles, which gives it a place on a lot of teams ranging from hyper offense to bulky offense and even stall. Necrozma-DM's typing allows it to check threatening Pokemon that would otherwise be very difficult to switch into consistently, like Zacian-C, Eternatus, Deoxys-A, Gliscor, and some Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy. Terastallization allows Necrozma-DM to beat threats that would otherwise check it, such as Ho-Oh and Koraidon, while allowing it to soft check other Pokemon like boosted Flutter Mane in a pinch. The omnipresence of Koraidon also helps Necrozma-DM, bolstering its Morning Sun recovery and giving it an option to stay healthy throughout the battle.</p> <p>However, Necrozma-DM is very slow even after a Dragon Dance boost. This makes it prone to getting outsped by a plethora of offensive Pokemon like Koraidon, Miraidon, Deoxys-A, Zacian-C, Flutter Mane, and Choice Scarf users like Kyogre, all of which can severely hurt Necrozma-DM if not outright OHKO it. While Necrozma-DM is bulky, it is not capable of tanking hits from boosted Pokemon and therefore might get overwhelmed by what it is supposed to check, like Zacian-C, forcing it to stay very healthy if it wants to fulfill its defensive role. Necrozma-DM is oftentimes forced to Terastallize in order to beat common Pokemon like Ho-Oh, Koraidon, and Arceus formes carrying Will-O-Wisp. Furthermore, some Arceus formes like Arceus-Ground are able to check every Necrozma-DM set.</p>",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Band set might seem interesting due to its ability to 2HKO every Arceus forme with its STAB attacks while also 2HKOing Gliscor and Ting-Lu. However, this set's viability relies entirely on good positioning and prediction. Necrozma-DM's Speed stat also lets it down in being a wallbreaker, as it is outsped by a lot of common offensive Pokemon and thus cannot make use of its excellent defensive typing nearly as much when locked into one move. Choice Band Necrozma-DM would be best suited using a set consisting of Sunsteel Strike, Photon Geyser, Earthquake and Knock Off.</p> <p>A specially defensive spread with Tera Ground can be used so Necrozma-DM has an easier time setting up on Calm Mind Arceus formes and Miraidon. However, Necrozma-DM can no longer check physical attackers like Zacian-C with this set, as it gets OHKOed by a +3 Close Combat. Furthermore, Ho-Oh, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu are comfortably able to check this set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: By virtue of its resistance to Steel and access to Recover, Thunder Wave, and Will-O-Wisp, Arceus-Water is the best Necrozma-DM counter available, being able to heal off the damage done by it with Recover and not minding Dragon Dance too much due to being faster than Necrozma-DM even if it's at +1. This gives Arceus-Water complete control over the one-on-one interaction, forcing Necrozma-DM to Terastallize into the Fire typing if it wants to avoid getting burnt by Will-O-Wisp, which then risks being hit by a devastating Judgment. Arceus-Water even has access to Dragon Tail if it wants to phaze Necrozma-DM, which is a safer interaction for it. However, Lum Berry, Life Orb, and Tera Psychic variants all have a positive matchup against Arceus-Water. The sun constantly being up thanks to Koraidon also makes it hard for Arceus-Water to threaten Tera Fire Necrozma-DM. Kyogre is another troublesome Pokemon for Necrozma-DM; while it does not appreciate switching into it, it can threaten to OHKO it with its STAB moves while halving Morning Sun's recovery by summoning rain.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Arceus-Ground can switch directly into Necrozma-DM and shrug off its attacks thanks to its superb bulk and Recover. It can then use Necrozma-DM as setup bait for Dragon Dance or Calm Mind, forcing it to switch out. Pokemon like Landorus-T and Groudon are durable enough to the point where Necrozma-DM might struggle getting past them without an unreasonable amout of Dragon Dances. Landorus-T even has access to Taunt to shut down any setup or recovery attempts from it, while Groudon can use Necrozma-DM to freely use Spikes, spread burns with Will-O-Wisp or Lava Plume, and phaze it with Roar. Ting-Lu can set up Spikes on Necrozma-DM and phaze it with Whirlwind while not minding boosted attacks too much due to its high Defense.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh is bulky enough to constantly switch into Necrozma-DM, with Regenerator further helping it accomplish this role. Furthermore, Ho-Oh can threaten a burn with Sacred Fire, forcing Necrozma-DM to either Terastallize, use a Lum Berry, or switch out. However, Stone Edge or a boosted Photon Geyser can deal extreme damage to Ho-Oh.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Dark</strong>: Arceus-Dark is one of the best counters to Necrozma-DM thanks to its immunity to Photon Geyser and access to Will-O-Wisp and Recover. Necrozma-DM can Terastallize into the Fire typing in order to comfortably beat Arceus-Dark one-on-one, but it must be careful of Judgment, especially if it has little to no bulk investment, as even an unboosted Judgment will hurt. Arceus-Dark can even fit other moves like Foul Play and Dragon Tail into its arsenal to better its matchup against a Terastallized Necrozma-DM. Sunsteel Strike variants, however, can outright beat Arceus-Dark, either taking it out or forcing a reactive Terastallization from it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Choice Scarf Pokemon like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Kyogre outspeed Necrozma-DM even after a Dragon Dance, with Koraidon and Miraidon outspeeding Necrozma-DM even after it has used Dragon Dance twice. Other Pokemon like Deoxys-A, Zacian-C, Flutter Mane, Miraidon, and boosted Dragon Dance Arceus formes will outspeed a boosted Necrozma-DM as well.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Foes</strong>: Pokemon like Gliscor and Skarmory are bulky enough to withstand Necrozma-DM's attacks, with Skarmory having access to Iron Defense and Roost to become a very sturdy counter. Gliscor outspeeds unboosted Necrozma-DM and can proceed to either lay Spikes freely, heal off any damage done with Protect, or hit it with Earthquake for a solid 25%. Furthermore, Gliscor can also use Taunt to stop any Morning Sun healing. However, Necrozma-DM will use Gliscor as setup bait if it's not carrying Taunt in its moveset.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Necrozma-DM</strong>: Defensive Necrozma-DM is a good check to itself, being able to use Swords Dance alongside defensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM and easily 2HKO it. Using Tera Ground, defensive Necrozma-DM can even beat offensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM one-on-one by spamming Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: Giratina-O is bulky enough to tank even boosted attacks from Necrozma-DM and threatens to burn it with Will-O-Wisp, phaze it with Dragon Tail, or 2HKO it with Poltergeist. Furthermore, Giratina-O can also Terastallize into the Steel typing to completely wall Necrozma-DM.</p> <p><strong>Orthworm</strong>: Albeit rare, Orthworm completely walls Necrozma-DM and uses Shed Tail for free against it.</p>",

        "Defensive Dragon Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Defensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM is one of the best setup sweepers in the format thanks to how easy it is for it to find opportunities to set up due to its excellent bulk and the rarity of Pokemon that can actually punish its setup attempts. Sunsteel Strike is Necrozma-DM's main STAB move that, despite its low PP, is very spammable due to how hard it hits most neutral targets, as well as Fairy-type Pokemon such as Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, Flutter Mane, and Tera Fairy users like Kyogre. If Necrozma-DM instead wants to hit Water-type Pokemon like Kyogre and Arceus-Water for neutral damage, Photon Geyser is also an option. Photon Geyser also has the added benefit of hitting one of Necrozma-DM's best checks in Ho-Oh for solid damage without needing Stealth Rock on the field. It is worth noting that both moves also hit Unaware Skeledirge quite hard. Running Photon Geyser and Sunsteel Strike in the same moveset is advised against due to its inability to hit opposing Necrozma-DM hard. Knock Off is Necrozma-DM's best option alongside Sunsteel Strike because it lets it remove key items like Ho-Oh and Kyogre's Heavy-Duty Boots, giving Necrozma-DM an opportunity to take them out later after it has used Dragon Dance if they're sufficiently worn down. Knock Off can also help Necrozma-DM remove other items like Gliscor's Toxic Orb if it didn't use Protect to activate its ability. Earthquake is the other option to consider over Knock Off and one that works best when used alongside Photon Geyser to hit the aforementioned Pokemon for high damage, particularly opposing Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C, which take less damage from Photon Geyser than they do from Sunsteel Strike. Earthquake also targets Tera Electric Pokemon like Kyurem-B and Zekrom that otherwise would break past Necrozma-DM. Tera Fire is Necrozma-DM's best type to Terastallize into because of its great defensive profile, letting it turn the tables against Koraidon and Flutter Mane while also becoming immune to Will-O-Wisp and Sacred Fire's chance to burn. The given EVs allow Necrozma-DM to avoid the OHKO from Zacian-C's +3 Tera Fighting Close Combat. Another EV spread to run is 252 HP / 136 Def / 120 Spe with an Impish nature; this allows Necrozma-DM to outspeed Deoxys-A after two Dragon Dance uses. However, Zacian-C then has a very high chance of OHKOing Necrozma-DM with a +3 Close Combat.</p> <p>Defensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM is a key piece in many bulky offense teams due to the role compression that it brings to them; checking Zacian-C while being a good wallbreaker or sweeper that can set up on Gliscor is invaluable for them. However, it might still struggle to sweep because of its poor Speed and need of multiple Dragon Dances to actually be faster than most offensive threats. Because of this, Necrozma-DM heavily appreciates teammates like Ho-Oh, Arceus-Water, Arceus-Fairy, Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Gliscor that can check the majority of Pokemon that might overwhelm it, such as Koraidon, Zacian-C, Calyrex-I, and Kyurem-B. Arceus formes also help Necrozma-DM by switching into Knock Off, preventing it from losing its item and, therefore, preventing it from taking entry hazard damage. Pokemon with access to entry hazards like the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Arceus formes can help Knock Off variants of Necrozma-DM overwhelm checks to it like Ho-Oh and Kyogre; Thunder Wave Arceus-Fairy in particular is a good teammate, as it can cripple Ho-Oh for Necrozma-DM. Choice Scarf Koraidon in particular is one of Necrozma-DM's best partners because it revenge kills many of the threats that it can't reliably check by itself like Zacian-C while bolstering Morning Sun's recovery.</p>"
        },
        "Offensive Dragon Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM can run an all-out offensive spread to hit as hard as possible. EdgeQuake coverage hits everything from opposing offensive Necrozma-DM, Miraidon, and Eternatus to Ho-Oh very hard, meaning that the Pokemon that actually check Necrozma-DM are limited to Pokemon like Arceus-Water, Kyogre, Ting-Lu, Arceus-Dark, defensive Necrozma-DM, and Landorus-T. Photon Geyser can be an option over Stone Edge if Necrozma-DM wishes to turn the tables on Arceus-Water and Kyogre. The combination of Sunsteel Strike and Photon Geyser allows Necrozma-DM to defeat every aforementioned check, with its counterplay becoming even more limited to faster foes like Choice Scarf Koraidon, although Ho-Oh becomes better suited to taking it on, as it survives a +1 Photon Geyser. However, Ho-Oh can get OHKOed by a +1 Photon Geyser if Necrozma-DM is running Life Orb and Tera Psychic. Lum Berry is the primary item of choice to help Necrozma-DM against status from Pokemon like Arceus-Water that might want to paralyze or burn Necrozma-DM, and it is best used with Photon Geyser, as a +1 Photon Geyser 2HKOes Arceus-Water after Stealth Rock and OHKOes it at +2 with Tera Psychic. Occa Berry allows Necrozma-DM to survive a Flare Blitz from Koraidon, letting it boost with Dragon Dance or use Sunsteel Strike or Photon Geyser for massive damage. This, however, heavily worsens Necrozma-DM's matchup against status and might force it to Terastallize into the Fire typing more often than not to play around that. Life Orb empowers Necrozma-DM's attacks to insane levels, allowing it to OHKO offensive Ho-Oh and Kyogre with Photon Geyser while 2HKOing Arceus-Water through burn. A +1 Life Orb Sunsteel Strike also has a chance to OHKO Arceus-Dark after a single round of Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fire allows Necrozma-DM to have an easier time setting up on Koraidon, Ho-Oh, and Will-O-Wisp variants of Arceus, whereas Tera Psychic empowers Photon Geyser to the point of giving Necrozma-DM a tool to potentially OHKO Ho-Oh at +1 while also resisting Koraidon's Low Kick.</p> <p>Necrozma-DM fits best on hyper offense teams that can capitalize on the damage it causes to opposing physical walls. Physical attackers like Koraidon, Zacian-C, Calyrex-I, and Rayquaza are all good partners because they also share common checks with Necrozma-DM in Arceus-Water, Arceus-Fairy, and opposing Necrozma-DM and can wear them down together. Grimmsnarl can ease setup for Necrozma-DM with dual screens, Ribombee can help with Necrozma-DM's middling Speed, and Deoxys-S can get entry hazards on the field for Necrozma-DM to better deal with its checks like Giratina-O, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Ground.</p>"
        },
        "Trick Room": {
          "description": "<p>Trick Room makes Necrozma-DM a scary anti-offense Pokemon and late-game sweeper that can very quickly turn the tides in its favor thanks to Terastallization and powerful neutral coverage. Running Trick Room allows Necrozma-DM to fully invest in bulk, allowing it to survive hits that it would otherwise not be able to, such as unboosted Flare Blitz and Modest Origin Pulse from Koraidon and Kyogre, respectively. Photon Geyser and Earthquake provide Necrozma-DM with near-perfect neutral coverage, only missing out on select Pokemon like Skarmory and Tera Steel Giratina-O. Lum Berry allows Necrozma-DM to beat most Arceus formes one-on-one, mainly Arceus-Water that would try to burn Necrozma-DM with Will-O-Wisp. This lets Necrozma-DM set up without any fear of getting statused. Life Orb gives Photon Geyser the needed extra power to OHKO maximum Defense Ho-Oh at +2; however, Necrozma-DM needs two free turns to use the appropriate moves and thus can be played around with ease. Weakness Policy is an option as well to take advantage of Necrozma-DM's monstrous bulk, assuming it survives a super effective hit. This can prove to be a game-ender, as a +2 Necrozma-DM is very difficult for worn-down or unprepared teams to face. However, both Life Orb and Lum Berry are far better options if Necrozma-DM wants an offensive item because Weakness Policy variants are prone to getting statused. Lastly, Mental Herb might seem odd on a Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, but it helps it to play around Taunt from Pokemon like Miraidon, Deoxys formes, Arceus formes, and even Gliscor that would try and stop Necrozma-DM from using Trick Room.Tera Fire allows Necrozma-DM to avoid getting burnt by Will-O-Wisp Arceus formes and Sacred Fire from Ho-Oh while turning its Fire-type weakness into a resistance to beat Koraidon one-on-one.</p> <p>Trick Room Necrozma-DM fits best on hyper offense teams that want an anti-offense option that can beat Pokemon like Calyrex-I while simultaneously wanting very potent late-game insurance. Good teammates include Calyrex-I, Koraidon, Zacian-C, Rayquaza, Basculegion-M, and Kyurem-B thanks to their ability to break past common physically defensive walls like Arceus-Water, Arceus-Fairy, Groudon, and Landorus-T. Pokemon like Deoxys-A and Glimmora make for good partners as well for their ability to soften these physical walls with entry hazards. This set, however, does not fit well onto Sticky Web hyper offense teams because it is counterproductive.</p>"
        },
        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>Defensive Necrozma-DM takes advantage of its excellent bulk and defensive typing, which makes it one of the most reliable Stealth Rock setters and pivots. Maximum Defense investment allows Necrozma-DM to avoid the 2HKO from even +3 Zacian-C's Wild Charge, and Heavy-Duty Boots provides further protection against entry hazards. Sunsteel Strike is used because defensive Necrozma's primary role is to check Zacian-C, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Calyrex-I, which are all hit harder by Sunsteel Strike than Photon Geyser. Due to the tendency of these Pokemon to use Tera Fire, Earthquake is used as a form of counterplay, which also ensures a 2HKO against Zacian-C, Zekrom, and Tera Electric Kyurem-B. Swords Dance is used to increase Necrozma-DM's damage output and therefore do a better job at checking the Pokemon it's supposed to, with the added benefit of outdamaging defensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM. Swords Dance can even turn the tables against Gliscor, whose Earthquake barely scratches Necrozma-DM. Necrozma-DM can also be a consistent Stealth Rock user due to its stellar defensive profile. Alternatively, Necrozma-DM can ensure its switch-ins take Stealth Rock damage with Knock Off. Knock Off is useful for the same reasons it is on the defensive Dragon Dance set. This seriously helps out its teammates that may be blanket checked by Ho-Oh, as Necrozma-DM can do a great job at luring it. Covert Cloak can be used instead of Heavy-Duty Boots to allow Necrozma-DM to safely stay in and use Knock Off against Ho-Oh or hit it with a Swords Dance-boosted attack, as not even offensive Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire 2HKOs Necrozma-DM. However, this does necessitate good hazard control from teammates as to not leave Necrozma-DM vulnerable to hazards. Tera Ground is used on this set, as it is a great neutral defensive type, and it can be used to turn the tables on Zekrom and Tera Electric Kyurem-B by becoming immune to Electric-type attacks. Additionally, it allows Necrozma-DM to get an extra hit off against Miraidon targeting it with Electro Drift. Tera Dark is a more niche option that can be used to power up Knock Off and provide insurance against Basculegion.</p> <p>Defensive Necrozma-DM fits best on balance teams in need of a reliable check to Zacian-C and Extreme Killer Arceus. Its favorite partners are similar to defensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, and include fellow hazard setters and Choice Scarf Koraidon. Arceus-Fairy is a good partner for Necrozma-DM, as it can use Thunder Wave against Ho-Oh to allow Necrozma-DM to outspeed it. Arceus-Fairy can also set Stealth Rock if Necrozma-DM is not running it. Arceus-Fairy benefits from having defensive Necrozma-DM as a partner because Necrozma-DM can check opposing Necrozma-DM that threaten Arceus-Fairy. Other notable partners for Necrozma-DM are Pokemon that help with Ho-Oh and Fire-type attacks in general, like Arceus-Water, Gliscor, and Eternatus. Covert Cloak sets really appreciate Giratina-O because it can offer Defog support to remove entry hazards, as well as providing a way to better deal with Arceus-Ground. Pokemon that appreciate Necrozma-DM's ability to effectively pressure Ho-Oh with Knock Off and Stealth Rock, like Arceus-Fairy, Koraidon, and Ho-Oh, love having it as a partner.</p>"

Blue Flare takes down Steel-types like Registeel, Celesteela, and Mega Steelix. Magical Torque is used primarily to target Imposter users for large amounts of damage, but it also hits Giratina and Miraidon hard.

          "description": "<p>Magearna is one of the best defensive Pokemon in Ubers UU, thanks to its role compression as both a pivot and entry hazard stacker. Magearna provides its team with useful utility options like Spikes, Volt Switch, Encore, and Thunder Wave. Fleur Cannon is an extremely powerful move, being able to chunk most of the metagame hard, especially Fairy-weak Pokemon like Arceus-Dark, both Urshifu formes, and Kyurem-W, whereas Draining Kiss greatly improves Magearna's longevity, at the cost of increased passivity. Encore and Thunder Wave both attempt to offset Magearna's passivity, with Encore punishing Pokemon attempting to set up on it, like Zamazenta-C, Mewtwo, and Zacian, by locking them into a move. Alternatively, Thunder Wave provides speed control for its teammates and cripples offensive Pokemon, like Zacian, Palkia-O, and Mewtwo. Tera Water allows Magearna to check Pokemon like Arceus-Fire, Chi-Yu, and Great Tusk, which it wouldn’t be able to do otherwise. Tera Flying is another option, allowing it to check Pokemon like Landorus and Great Tusk while becoming immune to Spikes, though this comes at the cost of a Stealth Rock weakness. Magearna is pressured by offensive Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Landorus, and Ogerpon-H; as such, Pokemon like Giratina, Kyurem-W, and Arceus-Dark partner well with it. Magearna's unique combination of both Volt Switch and Spikes allows it to enable Pokemon like Palkia-O, Kyurem-W, and Chi-Yu fantastically, as their checks like Arceus-Dark, Solgaleo, and Palkia-O can't hold Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Magearna's excellent defensive typing, great bulk, Soul-Heart, which is synergistic with Stored Power, and good boosting options allow it to act as a niche setup sweeper in Ubers UU. Stored power can muscle through Pokemon like Dialga, Unaware walls such as Clefable, and even Calm Mind Blissey with enough boosts. Draining Kiss gives Magearna semi-reliable recovery. Shift Gear makes Magearna faster, allowing it to outpace checks like Arceus-Fire and Landorus. Iron Defense is a niche alternative, making Magearna incredibly difficult to KO on the physical side, which can be helpful against threats like Great Tusk and Arceus-Fire. Tera Water is an excellent defensive typing, allowing Magearna to set up on Pokemon like Great Tusk, Kingambit, and Palafin. Magearna fits best on hyper offense teams, although it also can work on balance teams as well. Because of how long it can take Magearna to get set up initially, dual screens and Aurora Veil from Regieleki, Deoxys, and Alolan Ninetales support Magearna well. The most threatening Pokemon to Magearna are Fire- and Ground-types like Arceus-Fire, Chi-Yu, and Great Tusk that prevent it from safely setting up. As a result, Pokemon like Palkia-O, Palafin, and Landorus-T that can deal with these threats can be helpful to have. Solgaleo completely stops Magearna, so Pokemon such as Arceus-Fire, both Landorus formes, and Kingambit are good teammates. Taunt and Encore users like Arceus-Dark and Ogerpon-H can give Magearna free switch-in opportunities to set up safely.</p>"

        "Trick Room Setter": {
          "description": "<p>Magearna is an effective Trick Room setter because of its amazing typing, defenses, and pivoting capabilities. Eject Pack allows Magearna's Fleur Cannon to act as a pivoting move, which can be an effective way to deal large amounts of damage, as well as gain momentum on potential Ground-types seeking to block Volt Switch such as Great Tusk and Landorus. Steel Beam allows it to faint, letting another Pokemon come in whilst Volt Switch allows Magearna to pivot into a teammate safely so it can receive the benefits of Trick Room. Encore can be used over Volt Switch to lock foes into status moves, such as Arceus formes using Swords Dance or Calm Mind, which gives Magearna a free turn to use Trick Room or pivot into a teammate. Tera Water provides a resistance to Fire, allowing Magearna to set up Trick Room or pivot against foes that would previously threaten it out such as Arceus-Fire and Chi-Yu, while Tera Flying can allow it to take advantage of Ground-types that hope to come in on its Volt Switch such as Great Tusk. Trick Room teams need multiple Trick Room setters, which makes other Pokemon like Solgaleo and Dialga, which also provide a defensive backbone, synergize well with Magearna. Ursaluna and Kingambit are good options for Pokemon that can take advantage of Trick Room. Other than that, Magearna pairs well with allies that cover its type weaknesses such as Landorus-T which can threaten Fire-types like Arceus-Fire and Ogerpon-H, provide a Ground-type immunity, and form a pivoting core with it.</p>"

Choice Scarf makes Blacephalon the fastest relevant Pokemon in the meta, outspeeding threats like Miraidon, allowing it to double as a revenge killer and also offsetting V-create's Speed drops against slower checks like Primal Kyogre. Alternatively, Life Orb provides Blacephalon with more firepower, allowing it to hit benchmarks like OHKOing Arceus and Mega Audino after slight chip. Volt Switch retains momentum and chips Pokemon like Ice Scales Primal Kyogre and Ho-Oh into 2HKO range. Poltergeist on Life Orb sets serves as a way to hit the aforementioned Pokemon without receiving Speed drops. Trick lets Blacephalon cripple a defensive Pokemon in matchups where its Choice Scarf is unnecessary. Strength Sap provides crucial longevity to offset Life Orb recoil and entry hazard chip damage. A Naughty nature is chosen to boost V-create's damage and make Imposter users take more damage from Astral Barrage. Blacephalon benefits greatly from entry hazards that chip walls like Primal Kyogre and Fur Coat Arceus formes into 2HKO range. Conversely, due to its Stealth Rock weakness, Blacephalon also strongly appreciates teammates that provide entry hazard removal like Arceus-Ground. Slow pivots like Primal Kyogre and Mega Steelix can bring Blacephalon in safely. Blacephalon can be Imposter-proofed by Imposter Guzzlord, though other options like Fur Coat Ting-Lu and Mega Audino also work.</p>"

Hidden Power Ice targets Ground- and Dragon-types that aren't threatened by Blacephalon's STAB combination such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. Alternatively, Blacephalon may use Psyshock to break through Clodsire, Kommo-o, and Nihilego. Trick immobilizes switch-ins like Alolan Muk, Iron Hands, and Blissey but can also be used on the aforementioned targets of Psyshock. With a Choice Scarf, Blacephalon manages to outpace Weavile, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Tapu Koko, allowing it to revenge kill them. Mimikyu is a great wallbreaker, capable of weakening Dark, Fighting, and Dragon teams, setting Blacephalon up for success late-game. Mega Sableye prevents the setting of Stealth Rock, allowing Blacephalon to pivot freely. Gholdengo threatens Fairy-type Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Clefable and takes advantage of passive Blacephalon switch-ins like Toxapex and Blissey. Hisuian Zoroark's immunity to Ghost-type moves is heavily appreciated, and it lures in Dark-types such as Hydreigon, Mega Tyranitar, and Ting-Lu with Illusion, hitting them with Focus Blast. Furthermore, Hisuian Zoroark can bluff other Blacephalon switch-ins—such as Heatran and Toxapex—to eliminate them, easing Blacephalon's job later into the match.

Additionally, Zeraora packs significant utility options in Knock Off and Volt Switch that can capitalize on the aforementioned traits and even allow it to make long-term progress against a majority of defensive targets, such as Ting-Lu and Rotom-W. Toxic is usually Zeraora's preferred move in the last slot, allowing it to stifle specific Pokemon that are otherwise able to heal off and withstand its attacks, such as Mega Latias, Hippowdon, and Iron Hands. Alternatively, Zeraora can also make use of Close Combat to pose an immediate threat to most Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon, such as Excadrill, Hydreigon, and Mega Tyranitar, the latter of which it can also outspeed after a Dragon Dance, making it one of the few revenge killers able to remove it from full without the need for a Choice Scarf. On the other hand, Grass Knot is an alternative that puts immediate pressure on Hippowdon and Quagsire, though it becomes more difficult for Zeraora to break through several of the aforementioned targets in Mega Latias, Hydreigon, and Excadrill. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures Zeraora isn't hampered by entry hazards. Zeraora fits best on bulkier teams that appreciate its proficiency in revenge killing offensive threats while possessing added longevity and the ability to generate momentum. Defensive staples such as Slowking and Amoonguss appreciate Zeraora's ability to force out Pokemon that may threaten them, like Galarian Zapdos lacking Choice Scarf. In return, Slowking can use Future Sight to pressure Pokemon that would otherwise be able to stave off Zeraora's attacks, such as Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur. Similarly, slower wallbreakers like Choice Specs Enamorus, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Choice Band Tyranitar appreciate Zeraora's ability to scare out faster Pokemon while also benefitting from the safe switch-in opportunities provided by Volt Switch. While Zeraora's offensive matchups are impressive, it can struggle to contain many offensive threats that are capable of boosting their Speed, such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Autotomize Celesteela. Thus, specific defensive checks to these Pokemon such as defensive Celesteela, Slowbro, and Thunder Wave Clefable are highly appreciated.</p>"

Tera Grass gives Rillaboom an even stronger Grassy Glide, allowing it to storm through most offensive teams that have limited resistances to it. Some Flying-resistant Tera types such as Steel and Electric can punish Zapdos and Tornadus-T, but they are usually suboptimal and don't benefit Rillaboom's offensive power. Magnezone works well with this set, as it can trap and remove Steel-types like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor.

In turn, Cinderace can match up well against wallbreakers such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant and Meowscarada, which can all cause difficulties for the aforementioned Water-types. Ground-types that provide entry hazard support such as Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu make it easier for Cinderace to check threats with Stealth Rock and Spikes, especially if it is running an Adamant nature. Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Iron Valiant pair well with Cinderace, as they can eradicate foes that wall it such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Rotom-W. Similarly, Dragonite and Kingambit can check Pokemon such as Hatterene and Skeledirge, which can both cause issues for Cinderace. In return, Cinderace can provide hazard control for all of these partners and help them come in the field more safely without having to worry about chip damage from entry hazards.</p>"

        "Bulky Pivot": {
          "description": "<p>Cinderace functions as an excellent bulky pivot thanks to its great Speed tier, serviceable bulk, and access to support moves such as Court Change and Will-O-Wisp. Cinderace can force out important offensive threats like Gholdengo and Iron Valiant with the threat of STAB Pyro Ball while keeping up momentum against defensive switch-ins with U-turn. Will-O-Wisp allows Cinderace to cripple physical attackers such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Great Tusk, and it can also negate Leftovers for defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. Specifically, Will-O-Wisp offers a safe way for Cinderace to check Kingambit, since it avoids Sucker Punch mindgames. Finally, Court Change offers unmatched utility in providing entry hazard control that cannot be blocked by Gholdengo and is also able to steal opposing dual screens. The 32 Attack EVs guarantee a KO on Gholdengo sets lacking defensive investment and 2HKO on physically defensive Corviknight after Leftovers. Although this set rarely wants to Terastallize, Tera Fire can potentially come in handy for securing KOs with Pyro Ball, especially with a Blaze boost. Alternatively, Tera Flying grants Cinderace an immunity to Ground-type attacks, such as Great Tusk's Earthquake, which can grant it extra opportunities to KO foes or cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Tera Flying also matches up well against common Ground-type hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, letting Cinderace safely Court Change against them.</p> <p>Cinderace works best on bulkier teams where its ability to guarantee hazard removal shines. Defensive Pokemon such as Dondozo, Slowking, Toxapex, and Amoonguss are great teammates, as they appreciate Cinderace's ability to ensure hazard removal, freeing them up to run items other than Heavy-Duty Boots. Water-types such as Dondozo and Toxapex have notably strong synergy with Cinderace; Dondozo checks Great Tusk and Tera Fire Kingambit, while Toxapex can check Water-types, such as Walking Wake and Greninja. Hazard-weak breakers such as Iron Moth and Choice Band Dragonite also fit well with Cinderace, as it's able to bring them in with U-turn. These breakers also enjoy bulky Water-types like Toxapex or Dondozo being burnt, making it easier to overwhelm them long-term. Cinderace usually requires the presence of another hazard control Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hatterene, or Corviknight so it doesn't get overwhelmed. Corviknight synergizes especially well with Cinderace thanks to its Ground immunity and ability to absorb Knock Off from Meowscarada, which outspeeds Cinderace. Skeledirge and Dragapult can take advantage of bulky Cinderace, since both completely wall it and can potentially set up a Substitute. Kingambit is a great partner, as it can offensively check both Skeledirge and Dragapult. In return, it appreciates Cinderace burning Great Tusk and Ting-Lu, opening up the way for it to sweep.</p>"

Libero-boosted High Jump Kick provides valuable coverage, notably hitting Ting-Lu trying to set entry hazards while dealing large amounts of damage to Pokemon with a Fire resistance trying to switch in on its Pyro Ball, such as Hydreigon and Garganacl. Low Kick is an alternative, letting Cinderace deal decent damage to most heavy foes such as Ting-Lu and Iron Hands without the large risk of High Jump Kick's crash damage. Court Change lets Cinderace force the opposing team to deal with their own hazards while making it unlikely that hazards go up again. U-turn lets Cinderace keep momentum against foes it cannot threaten out like defensive Great Tusk and Garchomp. Alternatively, Sucker Punch lets Cinderace pick off weakened threats such as Flutter Mane and Baxcalibur. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Cinderace come in repeatedly to remove hazards without worrying about residual damage from them.</p> <p>Rotom-H is a great teammate for Cinderace, as its Ground immunity lets it come in on Great Tusk while threatening Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo—that Cinderace can't do much against—with its Electric-type STAB moves. Additionally, Rotom-H can beat Poison teams with its Substitute + Nasty Plot set, which Cinderace greatly appreciates. In return, Cinderace can pivot Rotom-H in with U-turn and keep Stealth Rock off its side of the field. Torkoal is another good teammate for Cinderace, as it provides sun to boost Cinderace's Pyro Ball damage to astronomical levels, provides entry hazard support to chip switch-ins, threatens Chien-Pao and physical Dragapult with a burn, and supplies a secondary source of hazard removal. In return, Cinderace can threaten out Ting-Lu, which might try to switch into Torkoal, while also keeping hazards off against Ghost teams. Scovillain deals with the aforementioned Water-types as well as Gastrodon while appreciating Cinderace removing the hazards that hurt Scovillain's longevity. Volcarona appreciates Cinderace chipping away at the opposing team, facilitating an endgame sweep. In return, Volcarona can hit Dark-types such as Ting-Lu and Hydreigon hard with Bug Buzz, ruin Gastrodon through Giga Drain, and damage Poison-types such as Iron Moth, Toxapex, and Glimmora with Psychic. Skeledirge is able to come in on physical hits like Iron Hands's Earthquake and force it out with the threat of a burn. Finally, Ceruledge can remove Ghost-types such as Dragapult that Cinderace can't do much against. In return, Cinderace can eliminate Dark-types and keep hazards off the field for both.</p>"

Body Press should be used with Iron Defense, while Brave Bird can instead be used with Bulk Up. U-turn allows Corviknight to maintain momentum against the threats that it checks while also bringing in frailer teammates.

However, as Corviknight lacks immediate offensive presence and coverage, it suffers from being forced out by the likes of Zapdos and Heatran and being setup fodder from the likes of Kingambit and Gholdengo. Pressure, in conjunction with Substitute, allows Corviknight to PP stall checks like Heatran and Skarmory safely while bypassing status moves like Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp and Clefable's Thunder Wave. Tera Water improves the matchup against Heatran, Weavile, and Urshifu-R, giving crucial resistances to safely let Corviknight boost up. Alternatively, Tera Dragon lets it take on Electric-types like Zapdos and Rotom-W while also helping against Heatran and Urshifu-R. However, Pokemon like Mega Diancie, Weavile, and Dragapult can now almost always force it out, though they do have to watch out for repeated Brave Bird hits. The given EV spread maximizes special bulk while still being able to survive a +2 Continental Crush from Garchomp followed by Stone Edge after Roost; it also lets Corviknight outspeed Skarmory and become only 3HKOed by Great Tusk's Close Combat. However, note that Corviknight will be taking a super effective Body Press from Skarmory after using Roost. Corviknight fits best on bulkier teams, which appreciate its ability to PP stall threats like Heatran and Toxapex while being a solid wincon. Pokemon like Toxapex and Clefable thus work well with it. Toxapex appreciates Corviknight reliably checking Tapu Lele and Landorus-T for it. In return, Toxapex helps check Weavile, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny, which Corviknight struggles to do. Calm Mind Clefable loves Corviknight draining PP from opposing Toxapex’s Haze; in return, it softens up Heatran. Ground-types like Gliscor and Great Tusk make excellent partners, as they absorb Electric attacks from the likes of Tapu Koko and remove entry hazards from the field. In exchange, Corviknight helps take Kyurem and Iron Valiant’s attacks. Due to Corviknight being walled by Electric- and Steel-types, such as Zapdos and Gholdengo, partners that can threaten them such as Mega Tyranitar and Heatran work well with it.</p>"

Iron Head allows Corviknight to handle Flutter Mane and other Fairy-types such as Mimikyu and Hatterene. Body Press hits Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and other Dark- and Steel-types hard. On the other hand, U-turn safely brings in stronger attackers like Dragonite, Iron Jugulis, and Kilowattrel, providing extra counterplay against Pokemon such as Volcarona and Gholdengo, which commonly switch into Corviknight. Pressure is the preferred ability for PP stalling Stealth Rock, while Mirror Armor counters Flutter Mane and Hatterene, which would otherwise overwhelm Corviknight with Mystical Fire. With the listed EV spread and a Careful nature, Corviknight avoids a 2HKO from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball while guaranteeing Iron Head OHKOes Flutter Mane in return. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to ease its matchup against physical threats such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Baxcalibur.</p> <p>Corviknight's capability to take on many offensive threats combined with its Steel typing makes it a stellar asset that almost any offensive Pokemon benefits from. For instance, Iron Jugulis appreciates Corviknight removing Flutter Mane, and Flamigo struggles with Ice Shard variants of Chien-Pao, which Corviknight can safely switch into. Dragonite greatly benefits from Corviknight's ability to soak up Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks while also covering Corviknight's weaknesses to Fire- and Electric-types such as Cinderace, Magnezone, and Volcarona. Gyarados can also act as a reliable wincon against types like Fire and Ground while also making Chien-Pao significantly more managable with Intimidate. Additionally, Kilowattrel is a great offensive pivot to pair with Corviknight, as it removes threats that could harm Corviknight like Greninja, Volcarona, and Azumarill while also absorbing Electric-type attacks. In return, Corviknight counters Iron Treads and Ting-Lu, which threaten Kilowattrel. Pelipper can be paired with Kilowattrel and Corviknight to form a potent rain core that softens the impact of Fire moves and gives Kilowattrel a Water-type Weather Ball, OHKOing many Fire-types that annoy Corviknight including Skeledirge and Rotom-H. Corviknight appreciates having Talonflame as an alternative option against physical attackers, as Talonflame is able to hold off Chien-Pao and burn Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Dragonite, tremendously easing Corviknight's role.</p>"

        "Bulk Up (Steel)": {
          "description": "<p>Corviknight is an exceptional wincon for Steel teams due to its unmatched bulk and great dual typing, capable of easily snowballing Ground and Fighting teams. Body Press targets Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that resist Brave Bird or could take advantage of its recoil like Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Iron Treads, as well as capitalizes off of the Defense boost given by Bulk Up. Alternatively, Taunt prevents Ting-Lu from phazing Corviknight out with Whirlwind and breaks passive teams like Poison due to the prominence of Haze and recovery moves, while Substitute makes it harder to shut down once setup and stalls out Landorus-T's Smack Down. Leftovers provides much-needed recovery and is almost always the preferred item; however, Occa Berry + Body Press can surprise Heatran and Flamethrower Hydreigon. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 80 Def / 180 SpD with an Impish nature allows Corviknight to survive Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R after a Swords Dance, as well as prevents Zamazenta from breaking Substitute with Body Press.</p> <p>Heatran is a great teammate, as it switches into Fire-type moves from Iron Moth, Scovillain, and Moltres and traps and removes Toxapex so Corviknight doesn't need to use Taunt. In return, Corviknight provides an immunity to Ground-type attacks directed at Heatran as well as a Fighting-type neutrality. Gholdengo threatens out Skeledirge and Iron Valiant and takes advantage of walls like Toxapex, opposing Corviknight, and Klefki by setting up Nasty Plot freely. Kingambit checks Ghost-type threats such as Dragapult, Spectrier, and Flutter Mane, as well as heavily wears down teams so Corviknight can setup relatively easily and clean up late-game. Hisuian Goodra is a great specially defenisve tank, taking on Greninja, Basculegion-F, and Volcanion as well as opposing Heatran. Iron Treads offers an Electric-type immunity, handling threats such as Zapdos, Regieleki, and Sandy Shocks, as well as luring Landorus in for a potential KO with Ice Spinner.</p>"

Meanwhile, Iron Head ensures that Corviknight will not be walled by Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, and Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Corviknight might not be fast, but it's fast enough to shut down most other defensive Pokemon with Taunt, such as Dondozo and Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brave Bird</strong>: Brave Bird can be difficult to fit in, but it's a fantastic response against Breloom, and means Corviknight doesn't have to be passive against Amoonguss and Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Corviknight's defensive typing is fantastic, so don't Terastallize too hastily, or else it'll lose to threats it normally checks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Dragon and Fairy weaknesses are devastating, but in the late-game, resisting Electric and Fire can give Corviknight new win conditions against old foes such as Rotom-W, and a shot to seriously damage Chi-Yu with Body Press. Just note that Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Getting STAB on Body Press can give Corviknight a surprisingly decent chance at cleaning weakened teams, with being able to 3HKO specially defensive Ting-Lu being a highlight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: With Tera Water, Corviknight consistently survives all but Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu's Overheat, letting it deal serious damage with Body Press. It also gains a key resistance to Ice for Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: While this set doesn't always use Brave Bird, Tera Flying lets Corviknight keep its typing while using Roost, meaning Earthquake and Fissure can no longer hit Corviknight while its restoring health.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: This lets Corviknight wear down physical threats more quickly while pivoting.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: Safety Goggles ensures Corviknight won't be impacted by Spore from Breloom, Amoonguss, or Brute Bonnet, regardless of having Taunt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's consistent recovery can be quite helpful for taking repeated hits from Ruination when attempting to stall it out with Pressure.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: Mirror Armor's ability to punish Flutter Mane for using Mystical Fire makes it the best ability choice on Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Corviknight's excellent bulk makes Pressure a good alternative for stalling out foes such as Dondozo, and is particularly good at stalling out Ruination from Ting-Lu and Wo-Chien.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also prevents Corviknight from being walled by Flutter Mane and Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: While U-turn with this set may seem strange, Corviknight is still a decent pivot even if it must give up Taunt.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Corviknight has a fantastic defensive typing, so only Terastallize if you need to win certain matchups, especially since it becomes vulnerable to Toxic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: With a Fighting Tera type, Body Press is easier to sweep with, with many Ting-Lu variants now being 2HKOed by boosted Body Press.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Corviknight a way to resist both Chien-Pao's and Chi-Yu's most powerful STAB attacks, though Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: A Dragon Tera type lets Corviknight resist common attacks aimed at it, such as Electric- and Fire-type attacks. However, the new weaknesses to Fairy and Dragon make this an especially reactive Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: A Flying Tera type lets Corviknight retain its Flying typing even when using Roost, making it a more reliable check to Fissure users such as Dondozo and Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: The passive damage from Rocky Helmet against Mimikyu gives Corviknight a much easier time using Taunt over Iron Head.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: When paired with Taunt, Covert Cloak makes Corviknight an effective Garganacl check, though note Corviknight will no longer drop Flutter Mane's Special Attack with Mirror Armor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: With Safety Goggles blocking Spore, this Corviknight is now an excellent check against most offensive Breloom, just watch out for the occasional Tera Fire Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Since this Corviknight attempts to sweep, Sitrus Berry's burst of quick recovery can make it less pressured to spend a turn using Roost. Leftovers on the other hand, will still keep healing Corviknight even after being hit by Ruination, so it can make sense with Pressure.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: Mirror Armor means Flutter Mane can't use Mystical Fire without getting its Special Attack dropped, unless Corviknight is holding Covert Cloak.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Corviknight's ability to take powerful, low PP moves such as Close Combat after Iron Defense makes Pressure a viable alternative, in addition to giving Corviknight a better chance of dealing with Ruination from Ting-Lu and Wo-Chien effectively.</p> </li> </ul>"

It's also an important aspect of Espathra Baton Pass teams, but Ting-Lu has made this team archetype much more difficult to use compared to past regulations.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Remember that most of Corviknight's good Tera types leave it vulnerable to Toxic, so Terastallize carefully and only win a win condition is clear.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: This Tera type lets Corviknight retain its Flying typing while using Roost, meaning Fissure users such as Dondozo are much easier to handle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is an effective tool against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, though note that Choice Specs Chi-Yu can OHKO with Tera Fire boosted Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Once Fairy-, Ice-, and Dragon-types are out of the way, the Dragon Tera type allows Corviknight to get around Electric- and Fire-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: If using Power Trip, Tera Dark is highly recommended to boost its damage output.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: In addition to punishing Flutter Mane for using Mystical Fire when not using Covert Cloak, Mirror Armor also protects Corviknight from Charm, Chilling Water, and Intimidate.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Pressure is a reasonable alternative for whittling down PP, which can be especially helpful against Ting-Lu's troublesome Ruination.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: When paired with Taunt, Corviknight can effectively take down Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: While Substitute and Taunt are effective against slower users of Spore like Amoonguss, Breloom's Speed means Safety Goggles are required to truly check it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Sitrus Berry is preferred due to the quicker burst of recovery better fitting a sweeper, but Leftovers can work very well with Pressure in an attempt to out-stall Ruination.</p> </li> </ul>"

Sablenite makes Corviknight incredibly slow, improving its pivoting capabilities, and also gives it Magic Bounce, which can reflect hazards used by Pokemon like Arceus-Ground and Garganacl as well as Taunt from Deoxys-S, ensuring Corviknight can heal itself with Roost and keep its teammates such as Gouging Fire, Urshifu-R, and Raging Bolt from being chipped. U-turn helps provide momentum and allows safe switch-ins to frail attackers such as Nasty Plot Deoxys-S and Iron Boulder, which can threaten to sweep when positioned correctly. Brave Bird is used to deal decent damage against Fighting-types like Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos at the cost of recoil, while Body Press deals super effective damage versus the likes of Chien-Pao, Garganacl, and Iron Boulder but does less damage to neutral targets. Corviknight has a great matchup against many Pokemon, including Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Urshifu-R, thanks to its defensive traits and ability to bring in Pokemon like Hisuian Arcanine and Walking Wake to dispose of these threats. Some significant threats to Corviknight include Electric-types like Zapdos, Sandy Shocks, and Supercell Slam Regieleki as well as Fire-types such as Gouging Fire and Red Orb users like Landorus and Raging Bolt. Dragon-types like Eternatus and Arceus-Dragon are thus good teammates for their ability to handle the majority of Pokemon with these typings with ease. Corviknight can also be paired with Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, whose Judgment can threaten every relevant Electric- and Fire-type in the metagame bar Zapdos, which is threatened by Ice Beam.

Fluffy provides the most protection against wallbreakers like Choice Band Galarian Zapdos, Iron Boulder, and Roaring Moon while not letting Corviknight fall victim to Scrappy Great Tusk, whereas Intimidate provides additional protection against Chien-Pao and Ogerpon-C at the cost of needing a secondary physical check to deal with the aforementioned threats reliably. Brave Bird is Corviknight's strongest neutral move and hits Ghost-types and key targets like Great Tusk and Galarian Zapdos, while Body Press fits well on Intimidate sets to do more damage to Roaring Moon, Ogerpon-C, and Chien-Pao. Corviknight is exceedingly passive, so it needs powerful and fast offensive teammates like Barraskewda and Azelf to re-gain momentum; in exchange, it provides them safe entry with its slow U-turn and entry hazard removal. Slower wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Ceruledge also appreciate Corviknight's slow pivoting services. Corviknight, especially Fluffy variants, needs a teammate like Swampert, Manaphy, or Well-Baked Body Gholdengo to handle the Fire-types it cannot check.

U-turn is used to pivot out once dual screens have been set up. Prankster Corviknight should be used with setup sweepers that appreciate dual screens support such as Dragonite, Volcarona, and Iron Boulder.

Flame Body allows it to fish for burns to weaken physical threats like Kleavor, Scizor, Kingambit, Mimikyu, and Meowscarada. Body Press is a great move thanks to Coalossal's high Defense stat that allows it to deal incredible damage to Chien-Pao and Kingambit. Rapid Spin combined with Heavy-Duty Boots allows Coalossal to come in and remove hazards without taking any chip damage, so its teammates won't get worn down. Will-O-Wisp allows Coalossal to burn physical threats such as Kleavor, Hoopa-U, and Iron Hands. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 92 Def / 164 Spe allows Coalossal to outspeed and burn uninvested Kingambit with Will-O-Wisp. Spikes is another option to run on Coalossal over Will-O-Wisp to help Rock teams stack hazards and wear down foes.</p> <p>Garganacl helps Coalossal by dealing with defensive Pokemon like Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Heatran with Salt Cure. In return Garganacl appreciates Coalossal checking Meowscarada. Air Balloon Shell Smash Drednaw is another good teammate for Coalossal, providing a soft Ground-type immunity and dealing with Ground- and Steel- types like Landorus-T, Sandy Shocks, Iron Treads, Heatran, and Hisuian-Goodra. Choice Scarf Glimmora with its diverse moveset is another option to pair with Coalossal, as it can outspeed and threaten to OHKO non-Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant and Greninja. Glimmora can also deal with Water-, Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon- Types like Quagsire, Hisuian Liligant, Hisuian Samurott, and Hydreigon with its various coverage moves. Furthermore, Glimmora run Air Balloon to act as an alternative Ground-type immunity that can deal with threats like Quagsire and Great Tusk. Tyranitar sets sand for Coalossal to boosts its Special Defense, which can allow Coalossal to tank special attacks from Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Choice Specs Magnezone and threaten them in return. Choice Band Lycanroc-D is a good revenge killer that can help out Coalossal by taking out threats such as Enamorus and Cloyster with Accelerock and Urshifu-R and Clodsire with Psychic Fangs. Hisuian Arcanine is another good revenge killer with Extreme Speed and can act as a wallbreaker, taking out foes such as Toxapex and Clodsire with Head Smash and Flare Blitz, respectively. Kleavor is a good lead for Rock teams, as it can deal damage while setting up Stealth Rock with Stone Axe, which helps with hazard stacking. In return, Coalossal complements Kleavor by dealing with Scizor. Diancie can ease the Fighting match by dealing decent damage to Gallade and Iron Valiant with Moonblast and by being able to take Fighting-type moves due to its Fairy-typing.

Sucker Punch can gives Flapple priority to finish off weakened foes.

However, Heavy-Duty Boots can be ran instead with Hustle for more immediate power. Flapple most commonly runs Tera Dragon, boosting its Outrage to incredible amounts of power, allowing it to OHKO or 2HKO the majority of the tier. Tera Ground gives Flapple a solid defensive typing, allowing it to block Volt Switch from Pokemon like Electrode and Raichu and should be ran with Tera Blast.

Fire- and Ground-types such as Charizard and Alolan Dugtrio can check the Steel-types that otherwise give Flapple issues, such as Perrserker and Tinkatuff. In return, Flapple threatens out the defensive Water-types the Fire- and Ground-types would struggle with, such as Whiscash. Poison-types such as Skuntank and Swalot can absorb Toxic Spikes and check opposing Poison-types that cause issues for Flapple. Indeedee-F is also a notable partner, as it can use Healing Wish to heal Flapple back to max health and allow Flapple to be able to set up twice in the game.

Although Appletun might seem passive, Apple Acid prevents special walls like Umbreon and Ursaring from sitting on it because of the Special Defense drops. Leech Seed helps weaken Poison-, Flying-, and Bug-types like Muk, Articuno, and Scyther that are all capable of shrugging off Apple Acid while also allowing Appletun to check powerful setup sweepers like Coil Eelektross and Dudunsparce thanks to the extra health it provides. Dragon Tail adds another option to deal with setup sweepers while forcing Pokemon that want to switch into Appletun to take another round of entry hazards, working wonderfully in tandem with Spikes setters like Qwilfish. Alternatively, Dragon Pulse makes for a powerful STAB coverage option that can hit Grass-resistant foes like Scyther and Drifblim. Heavy-Duty Boots helps Appletun check strong special attackers like Pyroar, Rotom, and boosted Veluza consistently with hazards up, but Leftovers can also be used for the extra recovery. Tera Steel helps Appletun flip the script on Pokemon like Scyther, Muk, and Tera Ice Jolteon that traditionally answer it.

Stone Edge threatens Defoggers and Flying-types like Drifblim and Vivillon and hits Eelektross and Rotom neutrally. Rocky Helmet wears physical attackers like Passimian and Muk down and discourages the use of moves like U-turn, while Leftovers provides Sandaconda passive recovery and makes it less reliant on Rest. Tera Ghost lets Sandaconda completely wall most Fighting-types and other threats such as Zangoose.

Pokemon like Chansey, Muk, and Umbreon can serve as backup checks to such foes and also check other special attackers like Cacturne and Zoroark. In addition, Chansey can run Stealth Rock for Sandaconda, thus allowing it to make room for both Glare and EdgeQuake coverage; Muk puts Sandaconda's grounded switch-ins on a timer with Toxic Spikes and annoys setup sweepers like Dudunsparce and Coil Eelektross with Haze; and Umbreon can keep Sandaconda healthy with Wish so it doesn't have to spend as much time asleep.

Close Combat hits Water-resistant Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon. Ice Fang may be used to hit Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Dragonite. Psychic Fangs nails common switch-ins such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Kommo-o, as well as removes dual screens in the Fairy matchup. Alternatively, Crunch may be used to break Sinistcha, Brambleghast, and Dragapult.

In return, Barraskewda lures in aforementioned Grass-types like Amoonguss and Brambleghast and removes them with the corresponding coverage moves. Toxapex provides a Grass neutrality, notably walling Meowscarada and Ogerpon-W, and offers entry hazards to wear down Barraskewda checks, while Barraskewda removes Ground-types like Landorus, Gliscor, and Mamoswine for it. Empoleon sets up Stealth Rock to wear down Barraskewda's checks as well as walls Dragon-types like Walking Wake and Kommo-o lacking adequate Fighting-type coverage. Quaquaval offers entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin and switches into Steel-types like Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit. Hisuian Samurott threatens Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon like Brambleghast, Slowbro, and Sinistcha while also providing utility support with Knock Off and Spikes set up via Ceaseless Edge. Urshifu-R is great in the Steel and Dark matchups, threatening Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Kingambit. Manaphy forms a wallbreaking core with Barraskewda in the Poison and Steel matchups, taking out Corviknight, Toxapex, and Amoonguss for Barraskewda, while Barraskweda hits Galarian Slowking and Alolan Muk in return. Choice Scarf Walking Wake is great in the Dragon matchup, notably outpacing and removing Baxcalibur, Dragapult, and Kommo-o, while a Choice Specs set weakens walls like Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra, and Slowbro.

Its blistering Speed tier allows it to nearly outpace the entire metagame under rain, including boosted foes like Dragon Dance Dragapult and Mega Swampert. Liquidation's Defense drop lets it potentially 2HKO Pokemon such as Dragapult and Pelipper, while Waterfall's flinches gives Barraskewda slightly better odds to muscle past the likes of Slowbro and Toxapex. Flip Turn keeps up momentum by providing free entry for its teammates while chipping down switch-ins like Dondozo and Tangrowth. Close Combat hits Water-resistant foes such as Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Gyarados, and it provides strong neutral coverage against the likes of Tera Water Great Tusk, Tera Grass Volcarona, and Gastrodon. Aqua Jet prevents Barraskewda from being revenge killed by priority attacks like Kingambit and Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch and—if rain is not active—lets it pick off faster threats such as Sand Rush Excadrill and boosted Volcarona and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, Psychic Fangs pressures Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Water Absorb Clodsire better. Tera Water skyrockets Barraskewda's rain-boosted STAB moves further, potentially 2HKOing even Water-resistant Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Pelipper is a necessary teammate that spearheads rain teams by reliably summoning rain with Drizzle. Mega Swampert is a fantastic offensive partner that can overwhelm shared checks like Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Slowbro and appreciates Barraskewda's Flip Turn to bring it in safely on foes such as Toxapex, Dragapult, and Dragonite. Tornadus-T and Ferrothorn are rain team staples that support Barraskewda with Knock Off, crippling walls such as Rotom-W and opposing Ferrothorn; Ferrothorn in particular helps threaten Gastrodon with Power Whip and sets entry hazards to soften up foes. The aforementioned Pelipper and Tornadus-T also provide Defog support for Barraskewda to pivot throughout the game unperturbed, bring it in safely via U-turn, and threatens problematic Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tera Grass Heatran.</p>"

Liquidation is Barraskewda's strongest spammable STAB option, which under rain 2HKOes Water-resistant targets like Kommo-o after hazard support and OHKOes neutral targets like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to pivot out of Pokemon like Corviknight and Rotom-W, which are not OHKOed by rain-boosted Liquidation, while still dealing respectable damage and maintaining momentum to get in its teammates to deal with these Pokemon. Close Combat is the strongest coverage move that Barraskewda has access to and it most notably threatens Ferrothorn, which is able to take Liquidation from Barraskewda. Psychic Fangs in conjunction with an Adamant nature lets Barraskewda 2HKO Mega Venusaur and Toxapex, and its secondary effect of destroying dual screens, while situational, is useful in the Fairy matchup. Crunch is an alternative option to let Barraskewda target Psychic-types like Latios, Mega Latias, and Slowbro, which are able to switch into Liquidation. Poison Jab is also an option to target specifically Tapu Bulu and Azumarill, which resist Liquidation and Close Combat. Barraskewda can run a Jolly nature in order to outspeed base 130 Speed Pokemon outside of rain, in particular Tapu Koko, while also being faster than Mega Lopunny, whereas an Adamant nature can also be run to achieve the aforementioned results with Psychic Fangs. Pelipper is a mandatory partner of Barraskewda, as it not only sets rain but also offers a slow U-turn as a form of pivoting, which lets Barraskewda get on the field safely, and its ability to threaten opposing Grass teams with Hurricane helps Barraskewda get past Pokemon like Mega Venusaur. Mega Swampert can form a potent Swift Swim offensive core with Barraskewda, with its superior bulk and defensive typing allowing it to stay in on certain Pokemon like Baxcalibur to achieve the 2HKO with Earthquake. Swampert also works well with Barraskewda, offering hazard support in Stealth Rock to weaken opposing Pokemon so Barraskewda can secure KOs. It also provides slow pivoting with Flip Turn, and its Ground typing is a must to stave off opposing Electric-types like Regieleki, which are faster than Barraskewda outside of rain. Toxapex is also a strong defensive teammate for Barraskewda, being able to cripple Barraskewda's checks with Toxic and also handle setup sweepers like Mega Altaria and Mega Scizor with Haze. Greninja is able to break past physically defensive walls like opposing Toxapex, Mega Scizor, and Mega Venusaur, which are reliable answers to Barraskewda, while Greninja appreciates Barraskewda being able to handle specially defensive walls like Blissey and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Greninja offers Spikes support, which also assists Barraskewda in wallbreaking more efficiently.</p>"

Its Ghost typing also blocks common priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Breloom's Mach Punch, which allows it to sweep even when Psychic Terrain is not active. Though it is resisted by Steel-types, a Psychic Terrain-boosted Stored Power can still heavily damage even Corviknight, 2HKOing physically defensive variants after just one Shell Smash. Shadow Ball is a consistent STAB move with excellent neutral coverage to hit most Steel- and Psychic-types hard, OHKOing Gholdengo and Hatterene. Tera Blast with Tera Fighting fills a gap in Polteageist's coverage, eliminating Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Kingambit while Psychic Terrain is active, and Hydreigon. Tera Fighting can also let it survive their Dark-type attacks. Weak Armor alongside a Focus Sash allows Polteageist to punish a stray physical attack, further boosting its Speed—it can outspeed +1 foes like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth—and Stored Power's damage. Focus Sash also lets Polteageist set up against threats that would otherwise outpace it or survive an attack and OHKO it, such as Kingambit, Choice Specs Dragapult, and offensive Great Tusk. A Timid nature is run to outpace +1 Walking Wake after a single Shell Smash.</p> <p>Polteageist is a staple on Psychic Terrain offense teams. Indeedee's Psychic Terrain protects Polteageist against priority attacks from Kingambit, Azumarill, and Floatzel while powering up its Stored Power, though Polteageist requires both a Shell Smash and a Weak Armor boost to outpace Swift Swim Floatzel. Indeedee can also let Polteageist set up with Encore or give it a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish, although if Polteageist has already consumed its Focus Sash, it will struggle to set up as reliably a second time. Armarouge is an excellent teammate and another staple on Psychic Terrain teams, as it can eliminate Steel-types like Kingambit with Armor Cannon to enable Polteageist's late-game sweep and it can use Endure to activate Weak Armor multiple times against Dragon Darts Dragapult, which Polteageist cannot reliably set up against. In return, Polteageist can greatly weaken or outright eliminate Unaware walls, set up against specially offensive Dragapult if its Focus Sash is intact, and can safely utilize Tera Fighting to eliminate Roaring Moon and wear down Ting-Lu, which allows Armarouge to sweep. Entry hazard removal is extremely important to maintain Focus Sash's protection. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support, can safely get Polteageist in after using a strong Headlong Rush or Close Combat, and can also switch into and threaten Dark-types for Polteageist. Magic Bounce Hatterene deters entry hazards, spreads paralysis with Nuzzle, and can provide Healing Wish support. Also, Eject Button lets it safely pivot Polteageist in, even against U-Turns from Corviknight, Cinderace, or Meowscarada, giving it much easier setup opportunities. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragapult appreciate Polteageist breaking past Unaware walls and wearing down Steel-types.

          "description": "<p>With entry hazard control provided by Magic Bounce, solid defensive stats that combine with powerful offenses to grant it great matchups against Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, and the potential for it to set up and snowball out of control with Calm Mind while keeping itself healthy with Draining Kiss, Hatterene makes a great addition to offensive teams looking for a special sweeper and hazard control in one. Psyshock is a strong STAB option that allows for Hatterene to target specially defensive walls on their weaker side, allowing for it to break through Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire while dealing with opposing setup sweepers that boost their Special Defense such as Volcarona. Stored Power lacks the immediate power of Psyshock but can scale heavily with multiple Calm Minds to allow Hatterene to muscle past even Unaware targets like Skeledirge, Clodsire, and Dondozo, along with also helping to win the one-on-one against other special setup sweepers in a similar manner to Psyshock. Unfortunately, its STAB combination leaves Hatterene walled by common Steel-types like Gholdengo, Heatran, and Iron Treads, while the low base power of Draining Kiss allows for Kingambit to easily stomach a boosted hit. Mystical Fire is a great coverage option that targets Steel-types, in particular helping to weaken Gholdengo's attacks, although this leaves Hatterene unable to hit Heatran; Nuzzle can alternatively be used to spread paralysis onto common switch-ins like Kingambit, Gholdengo, Heatran, and Skeledirge. While Magic Bounce's primary utility comes from its ability to deny entry hazards, it also blocks disruptive moves like Encore from Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W and Taunt from Landorus-T and Heatran, along with status moves like Toxic from Gliscor and Clodsire; this makes it far more potent as a setup sweeper. Leftovers is Hatterene's best option to greatly improve its staying power along with allowing it to switch in multiple times over the course of a game to block hazards; on Grassy Terrain teams and particularly with Stored Power, Grassy Seed can be considered to give Hatterene a better chance at immediately sweeping at the expense of being worse at coming in repeatedly, though Leftovers is still a viable option on these builds. The given spread runs enough Speed EVs to outspeed Toxapex, allowing for Hatterene to use a boosted attack before Toxapex can remove its boosts with Haze, with the remaining EVs invested to maximize physical defense. This notably allows for Hatterene to live even a +1 Protosynthesis-boosted Knock Off from Roaring Moon, while also dodging the 2HKO from Cinderace's Pyro Ball. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature can be considered on Nuzzle variants of Hatterene, as the Speed is less necessary when it is able to paralyze foes and so more physical bulk can be invested; however, this notably makes Hatterene slower than offensive Kingambit even after paralysis. Tera Water is a great neutral defensive typing that grants Hatterene a resistance to Steel-type attacks from Kingambit and Gholdengo, along with allowing it to stay in on Water- and Fire-type attacks from Pokemon that now struggle to eliminate it like Dondozo and Gouging Fire. Tera Fire also gives Hatterene a better matchup into Kingambit and Gholdengo while also giving it resistances to attacks from Rillaboom and Volcarona and powering up its coverage option on Mystical Fire sets. However, this comes at the expense of a weakness to Ground-type attacks from Great Tusk and Gliscor, along with making Hatterene much easier to revenge kill with strong Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Calm Mind Hatterene is a great pick on offense teams that appreciate the support against entry hazards, particularly for bulkier offense builds without a dedicated hazard setting lead. One particular form of bulky offense that Hatterene thrives on is Grassy Terrain with Rillaboom, with the additional passive recovery from the Terrain being much appreciated to help boost Hatterene's longevity further. In return, Hatterene can keep hazards clear from the field, allowing for teammates like Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Rillaboom itself to opt not to run Heavy-Duty Boots without fearing hazard damage racking up over time. Hatterene fits on far more than Terrain offense though, finding a home on even hyper offense teams alongside hazard setters like Glimmora, and some of its best partners on both bulky offense and hyper offense are offensive hazard-weak Pokemon that would sooner run a boosting item than Heavy-Duty Boots; prime examples of this are Gouging Fire and Kyurem. With Hatterene's support, Gouging Fire can use Booster Energy without fearing Stealth Rock damage, boosting its power significantly. Gouging Fire can also switch into Steel-type attacks such as Kingambit's Iron Head and Gholdengo's Make It Rain and Hatterene in return can come in on Dragon-type attacks from opposing Kyurem and Walking Wake. Hatterene is also able to switch in on these attacks for Kyurem, but their primary synergy is Hatterene's ability to keep hazards off the field to help mitigate the hazard weakness of both Choice Specs and Dragon Dance Kyurem variants. Though Hatterene has ways of dealing with some of its more problematic matchups, Kingambit and Gholdengo are always an issue for their ability to shrug off its STAB attacks and threaten it with their own; bulky, offensive switch-ins to the former like Great Tusk and Zamazenta can alleviate this issue without dropping offensive pressure, while Kingambit itself can make a strong partner for its ability to come in on Gholdengo along with other Ghost- and Poison-type moves from foes like Dragapult and Galarian Slowking, the latter of which being one of Hatterene's most prevalent checks with its high Special Defense and resistance to Draining Kiss. In return for Kingambit's positive matchups against these targets, Hatterene resists Fighting-type attacks from Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Iron Valiant that would typically be directed towards Kingambit. One Pokemon that Hatterene struggles to break through is Heatran, as it takes negligible damage from even a boosted Draining Kiss and can negate Hatterene's Leftovers recovery with Magma Storm's passive damage; If Hatterene has Tera available and has already boosted with multiple Calm Minds as Heatran enters the field, the matchup swings in Hatterene's favour, but Hatterene is notably unable to come in directly on Heatran to prevent it from setting up Stealth Rock. Offensive partners like Hisuian Samurott and Gouging Fire can be used as switch-ins to Magma Storm, able to threaten the opposing Heatran out and with the latter appreciating Hatterene's ability to bait Heatran in and pop a potential Air Balloon. Although Hatterene is usually sufficient in keeping hazards off of its side of the field, on top of the aforementioned Stealth Rock Heatran matchup, opposing Hisuian Samurott are able to put hazards up with Ceaseless Edge despite losing to Hatterene itself. This makes alternative forms of hazard removal such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads good partners to Hatterene, as they can provide key relief in these matchups for hazard-weak teams that would otherwise be overly reliant on Hatterene.</p>"

        "Healing Wish": {
          "description": "<p>Through a coveted combination of Healing Wish, an elite ability in Magic Bounce, reasonably strong STAB moves, a typing that naturally checks Fighting-types, and a choice of Nuzzle to effortlessly spread paralysis or Mystical Fire to check special attackers and punish Steel-types, Hatterene can support its teammates in a way that cannot be fully replicated by anything else. Healing Wish is crucial, as it allows Hatterene to sacrifice itself in order to fully heal a teammate's HP and cure any status effects; because Hatterene is often paired with sweepers and Terrain or weather setters that enable them, this is often a perfectly acceptable trade to pivot them in safely. Psychic and Dazzling Gleam boast decent coverage together and greatly threaten Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Zamazenta thanks to Hatterene's high base Special Attack; Psychic leaves its mark against Poison-types like Glimmora and Toxapex, while Dazzling Gleam hits Dragon-types like Roaring Moon, Kyurem, Raging Bolt, and Dragapult and Dark-types like Darkrai. Nuzzle ensures that Hatterene remains far from passive by paralyzing anything bar Ground-types and Electric-types; even Gholdengo and opposing Hatterene, which are safe from paralysis from Thunder Wave, are crippled if hit by Nuzzle. Mystical Fire, however, complements Hatterene's STAB moves well by hitting Steel-types super effectively; it also always lowers the opponent's Special Attack, giving it some added utility against threats that can boost their Special Attack like Quiver Dance Volcarona and Calm Mind Raging Bolt. Eject Button complements Magic Bounce perfectly; Hatterene's mere presence on a team will deter opponents from setting entry hazards and using status moves, and with significant investment, Hatterene's bulk is sufficient enough to switch directly into a strong neutral hit, survive, and activate Eject Button to safely pivot a teammate in. Eject Button also has the added benefit of turning the tables on U-turn and Volt Switch users, getting a free switch while denying their own switch. 132 Speed EVs allow Hatterene to outpace Ting-Lu, ensuring that it can at least get some chip damage against it before being attacked in return and expanding the number of slower threats it can use Healing Wish against before being KOed. The rest of its EVs serve to maximize its physical bulk, allowing Hatterene to better pivot in against most physical attackers such as unboosted Kingambit and Roaring Moon, Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Meowscarada. Tera Steel allows Hatterene to handle Fairy-type attacks from Iron Valiant and Enamorus more easily so it can punish them with Nuzzle and turns Hatterene's Poison weakness into an immunity, allowing it to spinblock against Mortal Spin Glimmora. Steel's powerful defensive profile also expands the number of threats Hatterene can safely use Healing Wish against in a pinch, such as Iron Head Kingambit, Kyurem and Galarian Slowking; though very situational, other Tera types like Dark and Flying can accomplish similar goals against different threats like Gholdengo and Dragapult for the former and Great Tusk and Heavy Slam Zamazenta for the latter.</p> <p>Healing Wish Hatterene's ability to enable multiple free switches for its teammates makes it a strong choice for offensive teams—particularly teams vulnerable to entry hazards—that need to maximize a limited number of turns. Healing Wish Hatterene is almost mandatory on sun teams, which are often so vulnerable to hazards that its Magic Bounce serves as a strong secondary or even tertiary countermeasure against them; Fire-types such as Torkoal and Gouging Fire are especially weak to entry hazards, but even powerful attackers like Choice Band Roaring Moon, Choice Specs Walking Wake, Black Glasses and Air Balloon Kingambit, and Life Orb Venusaur and Hisuian Lilligant can be worn down very quickly with hazard chip. Many of these are also answers to traditional Hatterene checks; powerful offensive threats like Choice Specs Walking Wake, Choice Band Roaring Moon, offensive Great Tusk, and Dragon Dance Gouging Fire can collectively overwhelm Hatterene checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran, which gives Hatterene plenty of opportunities to switch in on a neutral attack and either pivot out with Eject Button or use Healing Wish. Sun teams also greatly appreciate Hatterene's ability to give Torkoal an extra chance to support its team with Drought through Healing Wish, further enable these aforementioned offensive threats with Healing Wish, or spread paralysis with Nuzzle. Hatterene is also useful on rain teams for similar reasons; Pelipper greatly appreciates extra opportunities to set Drizzle up through Eject Button or Healing Wish, and teammates like Barraskewda and Assault Vest Archaludon appreciate both Hatterene's ability to deny hazards to keep them healthy and the many safe switches it can enable. Hatterene is also a staple on Psychic Terrain teams, which appreciate its ability to give Indeedee an extra chance to set up Psychic Terrain or to safely pivot in sweepers like Quiver Dance Volcarona, Shell Smash Polteageist, Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and Gouging Fire, offensive Deoxys-S, and Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Iron Crown while wasting as few precious Psychic Terrain turns as possible.</p>"

Healing Wish gives Hatterene the ability to fully heal one of its teammates, giving wallbreakers and setup Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Kingambit another chance to break through the opposing team. Mystical Fire is generally preferred over Dazzling Gleam to hit Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Kingambit on the switch, but Dazzling Gleam can be used to threaten Dragonite, Garchomp, and Dragapult. Nuzzle provides Hatterene with a way to punish Pokemon that would safely pivot into it otherwise, such as Heatran and Tornadus-T. Eject Button gives Hatterene the ability to take a hit and pivot into a teammate, letting frail wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y and Weavile come onto the field. Tera Steel removes Hatterene's weaknesses to Ghost and Steel, letting it pass a Healing Wish or cripple an opposing Pokemon such as Dragapult and Gholdengo while retaining its advantage against Dragon-types, though typically you would want to Terastallize a teammate for more offensive pressure. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Garganacl and Toxapex while maximizing its ability to pivot into physical attacks. Hatterene greatly benefits teams that rely on keeping entry hazards off the field, such as sun teams and some offense teams. As such, Mega Charizard Y is a fantastic partner, as it appreciates Hatterene keeping Stealth Rock off the field and walling Toxapex; in return, it is able to pressure Pokemon Hatterene brings in, such as Gholdengo and Kingambit. Focus Sash users such as Polteageist and Cloyster also make for good teammates thanks to Hatterene's ability to keep off hazards. Similarly, pivots such as Tapu Lele and Dragapult appreciate Hatterene's ability to keep off hazards and give them a second chance with Healing Wish, letting them come in safely and consistently. Hatterene's lack of longevity means that it usually cannot act as the sole form of hazard control. As such, Rapid Spin Great Tusk is a good partner alongside Hatterene for keeping hazards off of the field while also being able to support Mega Charizard Y on sun teams.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Calm Mind Hatterene is a solid option for balance teams looking for both entry hazard control and a late-game wincon. Magic Bounce gives Hatterene a way to switch into entry hazard setters, utilize Calm Mind to force them out, and avoid status from Pokemon such as Garchomp and Toxapex. Psyshock lets Hatterene beat opposing Calm Mind and Quiver Dance sweepers like Iron Valiant and Volcarona, while Stored Power lets it bypass Skeledirge with enough Calm Mind boosts. Mystical Fire hits Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Ferrothorn super effectively. Draining Kiss acts as a form of recovery for Hatterene. Tera Water gives Hatterene a solid defensive typing while removing its weakness to Steel-type attacks from the likes of Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Mega Scizor. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Garganacl and Toxapex, letting Hatterene take out Toxapex with an attack before having its boosts removed by Haze. Hatterene works well when paired with Pokemon that dislike entry hazards, such as defensive Pokemon without Heavy-Duty Boots. These include partners like Toxapex and Garganacl, which can check other offensive and defensive Pokemon, giving Hatterene the leeway for a late-game sweep. Flyinium Z Tornadus-T appreciates Hatterene being able to Terastallize to force opposing Gholdengo to Terastallize, as well as keeping hazards off the field for it. Kingambit and Garganacl are great partners for their ability to reliably check Ghost-types like Dragapult and Gholdengo, with Kingambit even being able to Pursuit trap them. Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor can check Kingambit for Hatterene as well. Hatterene's lack of longevity outside of Draining Kiss means that it appreciates a secondary form of entry hazard removal from teammates such as Tornadus-T, Zapdos, Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T. Alternatively, Hatterene enjoys pairing up with Spikes users such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, as they pressure the opponent into using Defog, alleviating Hatterene's need to block entry hazards, as well as wearing down Hatterene's answers such as Heatran and Gholdengo.</p>"

Psyshock is Hatterene’s hardest-hitting move against special walls such as Dragalge and Clodsire. Draining Kiss provides useful coverage against Dark- and Dragon-types and meaningful recovery.

Espathra forms a strong offensive core with Hatterene that can threaten a wide range of types such as Water, Dragon, and Ground once Hatterene breaks down Espathra's checks. This core can be enabled further by setting up dual screens with Scream Tail. Indeedee and Gallade ease pressure from Ghost- and Dark-types, respectively. The former's Psychic Surge can power up Hatterene's Psyshock, and the latter can check Steel-types for Hatterene thanks to its strong Fighting-type STAB attacks.</p>"

        "Calm Mind (Fairy)": {
          "description": "<p>Hatterene is a near-essential Pokemon on Fairy teams thanks to Magic Bounce and its Psychic typing, only further bolstered by its wide setup and support coverage that allows it to remove Pokemon like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Chien-Pao. Magic Bounce is especially notable, as it is the only form of entry hazard denial for Fairy teams. Calm Mind turns Hatterene into a deadly sweeper, notably stopping unboosted Flutter Mane from OHKOing it, instead OHKOing Flutter Mane in return after a single boost with Psyshock and letting Hatterene overheal Ting-Lu's Earthquake with Draining Kiss. Psyshock also lets Hatterene break through Unaware Clodsire, Dragalge, and Assault Vest Iron Hands, whereas Psychic 2HKOes Amoonguss and Toxapex as well as generally hitting targets for more damage overall. Draining Kiss gives Hatterene much-needed recovery, allowing it to heal against neutral and super effective targets, notably Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu. It can even beat Heavy Slam Ting-Lu with Reflect support from Klefki and Grimmsnarl. Mystical Fire threatens Steel-types like Scizor, Pressure Corviknight, and Gholdengo, which would otherwise safely switch into Hatterene and force it out. Alternatively, Giga Drain allows Hatterene to surprise foes like Gastrodon and Quagsire with an OHKO and generally allows Hatterene to win the Ground- and rainless Water-type matchups alone with minimal support; it can even be used sometimes over Draining Kiss depending on the team's needs, although the amount of HP regained is substantially less. Nuzzle can be used over Mystical Fire or Giga Drain to better support the team via paralysis. The given EVs let Hatterene outspeed an uninvested Toxapex so it can attack before its Calm Mind boosts are removed by Haze, with the rest of the EVs put into Defense to maximize bulk. If preferred, however, 204 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature can be used instead to have increased offensive potential, although at the cost of being more reliant on dual screens support; most notably, this lets Psyshock often OHKO Clodsire and Psychic always 2HKO both Unaware Clodsire and Quagsire. Heavy-Duty Boots is also an option over Leftovers as to more safely switch in when entry hazards are up, either from those that Hatterene could not block or simply was too pressured to switch into, although this does remove a large source of longevity.</p> <p>Dual screens support from Klefki and Grimmsnarl is almost essential, as it allows Hatterene to be much more aggressive with its Calm Mind boosts and switch-in opportunities. These teammates also provide extra support in Spikes from the former and both Taunt and Parting Shot from the latter, and in return, they can use Hatterene to block entry hazards from being set up, especially from Bombirdier and Ting-Lu. Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant can remove threats to Hatterene like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, Kingambit, and Chien-Pao as to facilitate setup opportunities for Hatterene, and they can rely on Hatterene to block hazards, especially Stealth Rock and Spikes. Tinkaton can neutralize Fairy- and Poison-type threats like Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, opposing Tinkaton, and Skuntank, which would otherwise impede on Hatterene's sweep, and set Stealth Rock and spread paralysis via Thunder Wave to ease sweeping opportunities further. Trick support from Iron Valiant and Gardevoir also helps Hatterene sweep, as this prevents bulkier Pokemon like Unaware Clodsire and Quagsire, Toxapex, and Dondozo from healing any damage taken and instead becoming setup fodder. Gardevoir also helps in the rain and sun matchups, as Trace copying Swift Swim and Chlorophyll removes the burden that Barraskewda, Floatzel, and Scovillain place by outspeeding and OHKOing all three. Azumarill and Mimikyu can support Hatterene as extra sweepers in order to overload the enemy's defensive core and majorly help in the Steel-type matchup that Hatterene dreads so much, notably pressuring Iron Treads, Kingambit, Corviknight, and Gholdengo.</p>"

Taunt denies Defog from foes such as Rotom-W and Tornadus-T and denies entry hazards from foes such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Hippowdon. It also prevents foes such as Volcarona and Annihilape from using Grimmsnarl as setup fodder. Spirit Break chips foes such as Ting-Lu and makes it easier to set up dual screens in front of special attackers such as Tapu Lele. Parting Shot can be used to pivot into teammates such as Dragonite, Dragapult, and Mega Scizor after setting screens, but it lets Dark-types such as Mega Tyranitar and Weavile—as well as Annihilape—exploit it, hindering its effectiveness. Superpower lets Grimmsnarl OHKO Kingambit after Stealth Rock, but it is ineffective outside of this matchup and is hard to justify over other alternatives. Grimmsnarl will very rarely Terastallize since teammates such as Dragonite take advantage of it far better. In a pinch, however, Tera Steel reverses its weaknesses and provides an overall solid defensive typing, which helps against foes such as Tapu Lele and Gholdengo. Tera Ghost is an alternative that prevents opposing Great Tusk from removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Teammates that take advantage of dual screen support such as Mega Scizor, Volcarona, Dragonite, and Kingambit make good partners, setting up safely and avoiding potential revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and opposing Kingambit. Mega Scizor is a particularly good partner, handling foes such as Kingambit that use Grimmsnarl as setup fodder. Grimmsnarl has difficulty denying entry hazards from foes such as Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu, so it appreciates teammates such as Cyclizar clearing hazards from the field. Cyclizar also appreciates dual screen support from Grimmsnarl making it more difficult for foes to break the Substitute it passes to teammates.</p>"

Combining Psychic Surge with Expanding Force allows Indeedee to take out threats like Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Toxapex. Dazzling Gleam lets Indeedee pressure Dark-, Fighting-, and Dragon-types like Choice Specs Greninja, Scrafty, and Hydreigon. Trick can punish common walls like Ting-Lu, Corviknight, and Empoleon, while Healing Wish provides support for the team.</p> <p>Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a nice teammate for Indeedee, being able to check Ghost-, Steel- and Psychic-types like Ceruledge, Archaludon, and Metagross. Hisuian Zoroark also provides help by using Trick to Choice-lock walls like Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Iron Hands. Indeedee returns the favor by taking out bulky foes like Clodsire and Toxapex and providing immunity against Sucker Punch Kingambit while the Psychic Terrain from its ability remains active. Ditto helps Indeedee as a late-game wincon by transforming into Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Gouging Fire in the Dark, Dragon, and Fire matchups, respectively, reverse sweeping when possible. Smeargle is a nice entry hazard setter, providing Spikes and Sticky Web for Indeedee to slow down fast Choice Scarf users like Sneasler, Urshifu-R, and Roaring Moon. Calm Mind Ursaluna-B deals with specially defensive Pokemon that Indeedee can't break like Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Tyranitar. In return, Indeedee takes out Iron Valiant and Urshifu-R without Choice Scarf for Ursaluna-B and Smeargle. Blissey is a nice teammate that can tank special hits from foes like Greninja and Flutter Mane while also setting Stealth Rock and spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave. Porygon2 is a good defensive wall that is able to tank hits from Ogerpon formes, Gouging Fire, and Ceruledge while also checking them with Foul Play. Porygon2 also pressures Flying-types like Corviknight, Dragonite, and Mandibuzz with Discharge and Ice Beam. Indeedee doesn't like hazards, so Braviary is a great option that can remove hazards with Defog while taking out foes like Lokix and Hisuian Samurott with Brave Bird and Close Combat, respectively. Terapagos is another option due to its colorful moveset, including BoltBeam coverage that can take out Skarmory, Garchomp, and Landorus, and it can also remove hazards for the team with Rapid Spin. Terapagos's signature move Tera Starstorm allows Terapagos to dent bulky Pokemon. Loaded Dice Cinccino can be a physical sweeper and hazard remover with Tidy Up. Cinccino also has great coverage, including moves that can deal with Ground-, Water-, Flying-, Dragon-, and Ice-types with Bullet Seed, Triple Axel, and Rock Blast.</p>"

Psyshock hits Special Walls such as Articuno and Lumineon harder due to their weaker physical bulk, but Psychic can be used instead, as it does more damage to more physically bulky Pokemon such as Perrserker and Gabite. Indeedee-F's last two moveslots are very flexible; Hyper Voice provides a strong alternative STAB move which also allows Indeedee-F to damage Dark-types such as Houndoom. Tera Blast provides a STAB move before Terastallizing and can be used with a Ground or Fairy Tera to allow Indeedee-F to hit Steel-types and Dark-types that would normally check it such as Perrserker, Tinkatuff, and Skuntank; however, it is weaker than Hyper Voice. Healing Wish can sacrificially and allow a partner Pokemon to come back in healthy after it has been damaged, building momentum. Indeedee-F can also viably run Tera Psychic, boosting up its Psychic-type attacks even further.

          "description": "<p>Arctozolt carves itself a niche as a snow sweeper and wallbreaker thanks to Slush Rush and its powerful offensive STAB moves, hitting foes such as Landorus-T, Toxapex, and Slowbro. Slush Rush lets Arctozolt outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under snow, including foes such as Dragapult and Weavile, though its inability to outspeed boosted foes such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and its pitiful Speed outside of snow hinders its sweeping potential. Freeze-Dry is an alternative to Blizzard that lets Arctozolt break through foes such as Gastrodon and Mega Swampert, but the lack of consistency outside of these matchups makes it a less desirable choice. Low Kick provides coverage for foes such as Ferrothorn, Kingambit, and Mega Tyranitar. Substitute takes advantage of forced switches against foes such as the aforementioned Toxapex and Tornadus-T to ease prediction and avoid potential revenge killers such as the aforementioned Tapu Lele, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lopunny. The Defense boost from snow also helps preserve Arctozolt's Substitute, granting it more safe turns. Heavy-Duty Boots alleviates Arctozolt's major Stealth Rock weakness, granting it more opportunities to wallbreak. Alternatively, Leftovers can be used with entry hazard control to improve Arctozolt's longevity and grant more opportunities to use Substitute. Tera Electric is used to boost Bolt Beak's power and remove Arctozolt's weakness to Stealth Rock, but it loses the Defense boost from snow. Slowking is a mandatory teammate to support Arctozolt, setting snow and acting as a slow pivot to grant it safe entry. Mega Diancie provides entry hazard support to weaken foes such as Ferrothorn and helps deny opposing entry hazards for Arctozolt. Arctozolt struggles against revenge killers such as Mega Scizor and Choice Scarf Kartana, so it appreciates teammates such as Heatran and Tornadus-T handling them. Tornadus-T also provides reliable entry hazard removal so Arctozolt can use Leftovers.</p>"

        "Boots Pivot": {
          "description": "<p>Dragapult is one of OU's best pivots, with its massive base Speed stat allowing it to dance around slower threats, spread status and deal significant damage over the course of a game. Dragon Darts is a strong STAB option that hits key targets in the tier such as Roaring Moon, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite, with the given spread running enough Attack investment to OHKO Kyurem after Stealth Rock damage. Alternatively, Draco Meteor can be used with an EV spread fully invested into Special Attack that lets it secure an OHKO into Walking Wake and Gouging Fire while also giving Dragapult a more powerful Hex to 2HKO even max HP Gholdengo, but the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor leaves it vulnerable to being used as setup fodder, and this set is also weaker into sweepers that boost their Special Defense such as Raging Bolt and Volcarona. Both Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are great options that synergize with the rest of Dragapult's toolkit by doubling the power of Hex; Will-O-Wisp turns Dragapult into a great fast check that can outrun and neutralize physical threats such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Kingambit while also forcing chip on Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire that try to switch in, while Thunder Wave slows down targets like Volcarona to help teammates deal with them more easily. Tera Fairy is a great defensive option that flips Dragapult's Dragon weakness into an immunity while also granting a Dark resistance to resist hits from Kingambit and Darkrai, whereas Tera Ghost powers up Hex while still dropping its weaknesses to Fairy and Dragon to help block revenge killing attempts by Enamorus.</p> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult is a fantastic pick on balance teams, synergizing well with durable hazard setters such as Skarmory, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu that can assist in chipping down the switch-ins that it forces. In return, Dragapult helps to patch up bulkier teams' lack of speed control while not minding the hazards that they often allow on both sides of the field. Knock Off users such as Meowscarada and Weavile are solid pairings with Dragapult on these balance structures, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon to make the switches that Dragapult forces more meaningful while giving Dragapult opportunities to come in for free on their own checks, allowing these teams to better pressure opposing Skarmory and Corviknight. Bulkier offense teams also benefit from the presence of Dragapult as a form of speed control that wears down defensive cores with both damage and status effects; Kingambit in particular is a terrifying late-game sweeper that appreciates Dragapult's ability to weaken a team for it to clean through, with Will-O-Wisp Dragapult able to neuter its physical checks like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Skarmory, while Thunder Wave variants can slow down threats that would otherwise outspeed Kingambit such as Volcarona, Cinderace, and Heatran. In turn, Dragapult often invites in opposing Kingambit, which resists its STAB options and is only threatened by its status moves, so solid switch-ins for this like Skarmory and Great Tusk are usually appreciated to prevent it from getting too many free turns. Raging Bolt in particular is a strong partner to pivot Dragapult on bulky offense teams that enjoy its support to help break through Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and specially defensive Gliscor. Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult also struggles to muscle past bulkier checks like Toxapex and Clefable alone, so partners that can take advantage of them for setup opportunities such as Kingambit and Gholdengo are great picks. As Dragapult's Speed tier is almost unmatched in the OU metagame, Booster Energy users like Iron Boulder and Iron Valiant along with the even faster Deoxys-S are frequently forced in to revenge kill it, so more defensive teammates that can handle these threats are valued; Galarian Slowking is a good bulky pivot that takes on the latter two and can use Chilly Reception to bring in Dragapult for free after taking a hit, while both Gliscor and Skarmory are solid Iron Boulder checks that can either beat it or force it to switch out and lose its Speed boost, allowing Dragapult to outspeed it later.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Specs": {
          "description": "<p>Dragapult is an amazing source of immediate power due to its near unresisted STAB combination, solid Special Attack, and excellent Speed tier, which outspeeds the majority of the unboosted metagame except Deoxys-S. Equipping Choice Specs allows Dragapult to break through Pokemon such as Gliscor and Zamazenta with its STAB moves. Flamethrower threatens Kingambit. U-turn allows Dragapult to keep the momentum for its team and hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to be a great check to dual screens teams and Substitute sweepers such as Iron Defense Zamazenta. Tera Ghost powers up its most spammable STAB attack in Shadow Ball, allowing Dragapult to further dent Galarian Slowking and secure the OHKO on Iron Valiant and Skeledirge. This also improves its matchup into Iron Valiant and Enamorus, as it takes much less damage from Moonblast, allowing it to survive a hit and KO them back. Tera Dragon raises Draco Meteor to nuclear levels, OHKOing Gliscor, Dondozo, and defensive Landorus-T, and it also improves Dragapult's matchup into Darkrai and Gholdengo, as it removes it weakness to Dark Pulse and Shadow Ball, respectively. A Modest nature can be run instead of Timid to forego outspeeding Zamazenta, Weavile, and Darkrai for higher damage output, such as OHKOing Gliscor and Serperior with Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Dragapult fits well on offensive teams due to its excellent ability to break down walls such as Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire. Therefore, Dragapult is able to benefit sweepers like Gholdengo, Raging Bolt, and Volcarona that appreciate walls being worn down. Dark- and Fairy-types like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Clefable are threats to Dragapult, as they are able to switch in and force it out. Therefore, checks to these such as Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta make for good partners. The latter two help with Kingambit, which is Dragapult's biggest check due to resisting both of its STAB moves. Dragapult benefits from entry hazards on the opposing side of the field. Therefore, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Gliscor are good partners for it. Knock Off support from the likes of Weavile, Roaring Moon, and Meowscarada are able to be brought in by Dragapult's U-turn, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Kyurem and Darkrai. Meowscarada especially is a great partner, since it’s able to bring Dragapult in with its own U-turn after removing Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing Dragapult to better pressure its checks. Dragapult is not very good at switching into attacks, as it is relatively frail, so slow pivots like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola are amazing teammates. Entry hazards wear down Dragapult over time, limiting the number of times it can switch onto the field; therefore, hazard control from Great Tusk and Cinderace can help Dragapult. Deoxys-S and Booster Energy Pokemon with a Speed Boost such as Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant are able to outspeed and threaten to KO Dragapult, so speed control like Rillaboom, Raging Bolt and Kingambit make for good teammates.</p>"

        "Hex (Dragon)": {
          "description": "<p>Hex Dragapult serves as great offensive support for Dragon teams, catching common switch-ins to Choice Specs Dragapult, such as Alolan Muk and Iron Hands, off guard by incapacitating them with Will-O-Wisp. With Substitute, Dragapult acts as a stallbreaker against types like Water, Poison, and Ground lacking Ursaluna-B, as burned defensive pivots like Clodsire will be unable to break its Substitute, allowing Dragapult to fire off powerful moves in Hex in conjunction with status ailments and Dragon Darts. Will-O-Wisp also punishes Sucker Punch users like Kingambit, granting Dragon a bit more breathing room against these threats, as well as bulky setup sweepers like Zamazenta and Corviknight. Thunder Wave can be considered if Shed Tail support from Cyclizar is available, as this allows Dragapult to neutralize threats like Iron Valiant, Volcarona, and special Choice Scarf users like Flutter Mane and Enamorus, which do not mind being burned. With 148 SpA EVs, Dragapult OHKOes Flutter Mane with Hex after it is statused, while the remaining EVs are invested in Attack and Speed to maximize the potency of Dragon Darts to make Dragapult as threatening as possible in the Dragon matchup. Infiltrator lets Dragapult OHKO statused Flutter Mane regardless, even behind Light Screen, revenge kill Frosmoth and Baxcalibur behind Substitute, and also inflict burns on Iron Defense Zamazenta behind Substitute.</p> <p>Since Hex Dragapult weakens the offensive capabilities of bulky walls such as Corviknight, Alolan Muk, and Iron Hands, teammates like Dragon Dance Baxcalibur, Clangorous Soul Kommo-o, and Dragon Dance Dragonite can capitalize on these openings to set up and tear through opposing Flying-, Dark-, and Fighting-type teams. Baxcalibur also helps in breaking down bulkier types like Flying, Ground, and Poison, cleans up types like Dragon late-game, and picks off Choice Scarf Enamorus and Meowscarada with Ice Shard. Kommo-o provides powerful priority in Vacuum Wave to deal with Chien-Pao and Kingambit and has the ability to clean types such as Ice and Dark after a Clangorous Soul boost. Wallbreakers like Choice Specs Walking Wake and Choice Band Roaring Moon help Dragapult overwhelm threats such as Alolan Muk, Iron Hands, and Gholdengo, which can be hard to take down for Dragon teams. Alternatively, these teammates can don a Choice Scarf, allowing Walking Wake to deal with Chien-Pao and boosted Baxcalibur and Roaring Moon to obliterate Flutter Mane and opposing Dragapult. Entry hazard support from Grachomp and Dragalge are also great, as they make Dragapult more punishing to swap into, and Dragalge's Toxic Spikes are able to status Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, which lets Dragapult spam Hex and prioritize getting a Substitute up in matchups like Fairy and Fighting. Garchomp also punishes prospective Knock Offs against Dragapult from Roaring Moon, Empoleon, and Iron Treads, thanks to Rough Skin and its typing to punish these threats back. Cyclizar can Shed Tail into Dragapult, enabling it to use another status move. In return, Dragapult dissuades Fighting-type attacks by its mere presence on teams, allowing Cyclizar to more safely enter the field. Cyclizar itself also supports Dragapult by providing a Ghost immunity, which is useful in dealing with foes such as Ceruledge and Gengar, and provides hazard removal to prevent Dragapult from being chipped down and let it more freely set up Substitutes. Hisuian Goodra is a great special wall that is able to take on Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant for Dragapult. In return, Dragapult burns and wears down opposing defensive pieces like Iron Hands for it.</p>"

        "Choice Specs (Dragon)": {
          "description": "<p>As the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the Monotype metagame, Choice Specs Dragapult is an excellent offensive threat that deals with Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Greninja for Dragon teams. Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball are helpful against a variety of types lacking the necessary immunities and can be used to decimate types such as Dark, Flying, Fairy, and Ghost. Flamethrower roasts Steel-types such as Corviknight and Scizor without the risk of getting stalled by Pressure, and Thunderbolt nails Toxapex and Dondozo and cleans Water teams late-game. Alternatively, U-turn brings in team mates like Baxcalibur, Garchomp, and Hydreigon, which take advantage of common switch-ins such as Ting Lu, Clodsire, and Kingambit. Infiltrator lets Dragapult bypass dual screens, which is sorely needed to properly deal with Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Since Dragapult excels at cleaning teams with its natural speed, wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Hydreigon, Baxcalibur, and Choice Band Haxorus, as well as entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Dragalge are excellent teammates. Dragonite loves Dragapult's ability to wear down or outright remove Steel-, Water-, and Ghost-types such as Klefki, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, allowing it to clean up types such as Fairy, Water, and Fire with a Dragon Dance or Choice Band set. Choice Scarf users like Baxcalibur, Hydreigon, and Roaring Moon are appreciated, as these deal with opposing Choice Scarf users such as Gallade and Gholdengo, which revenge kill Dragapult with ease. Cyclizar provides entry hazard removal and can pass a Shed Tail to Dragapult, allowing it to get in the field safely.</p>"

        "Hex (Ghost)": {
          "description": "<p>Dragapult carries a plethora of utility options in its movepool to hinder the opposition. It leverages its high Speed to outspeed and threaten Zamazenta, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao with status for its teammates. Heavy-Duty Boots also enables Dragapult to switch in much more often. Will-O-Wisp weakens physical attackers that pose a threat to Ghost teams, such as Great Tusk, Urshifu-R, and Kingambit, while Thunder Wave disrupts faster opposition such as Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott, Ogerpon-H, and Zamazenta. Hex is also a great choice for beating Gliscor and other Pokemon affected by Dragapult spreading status. U-turn is another great form of support as it lets Dragapult, scout switches and bring in its teammates safely. Dragapult's ability, Infiltrator, also grants it the capability to hinder the likes of Substitute Zamazenta and Enamorus, and ignore dual screens set up by Klefki in the Fairy matchup. The given EV spread allows Dragapult to guarantee a 2HKO against Hatterene after recovery from Leftovers and always outspeed Zamazenta.</p> <p>Flutter Mane is the biggest beneficiary of Dragapult's services, as it can outspeed Choice Scarf users crippled by Thunder Wave or live a few physical attacks from foes burned by Will-O-Wisp such as Earthquake from Landorus-T and Dire Claw from Sneasler. Flutter Mane repays Dragapult by blasting through Dark-types that give Ghost teams trouble such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Darkrai, and, if using a Choice Scarf, Chien-Pao. Spectrier is another great teammate for taking advantage of the status spread by Dragapult by threatening to win games with Hex. Dragapult's status also allows Spectrier to freely run Substitute and Nasty Plot together without needing to run Will-O-Wisp. Dragapult also safely pivots both Flutter Mane and Spectrier in, which is useful as both are quite frail. Gholdengo is an excellent choice, as with a Hex set, it is able to use the status spread by Dragapult to great effect and enhance its power, while with a Choice Scarf, it can threaten Chien-Pao, poses a threat to Dragapult with its priority moves. Skeledirge is a good choice as well, as it can withstand hits and reply back with a boosting Torch Song while also posing a threat to Heatran with Earth Power. Skeledirge also threatens Ice-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Frosmoth. Hisuian Zoroark is a much appreciated Ghost immunity that can deceive opponents into thinking it may be Dragapult or its vulnerable teammates, then take advantage of that to unleash powerful attacks against opposing Spectrier and Ceruledge or cripple walls such as Toxapex and Empoleon with Knock Off. Substitute Sinistcha is another choice to take care of one of Ghost's biggest problems in Ursaluna-B. Dragapult's spreading of status also allows for Mimikyu and Ceruledge to set up much more easily to threaten Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Steel-types like Corviknight, respectively. Mimikyu is also a one-time check to Chien-Pao and Kingambit with Disguise, both of which greatly threaten Ghost teams. Brambleghast can set up Spikes, which can wear down the opposition quickly in conjunction with burns from Dragapult's Will-O-Wisp, while Gengar can set up Toxic Spikes, letting Dragapult and Spectrier use Hex much more often.</p>"
        },
        "Dragon Dance (Ghost)": {
          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance gives Dragapult the ability to not just boost its fantastic Speed to new heights, allowing it to outspeed fast Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada and Roaring Moon, but also beef up its decent Attack stat. Dragon Darts is a reliable, hard-hitting Dragon-type STAB move that allows Dragapult to break Breloom's Focus Sash and Dragonite's Multiscale. Phantom Force is Dragapult's best choice for Ghost-tpye STAB move, as otherwise it is walled by any Fairy- or Steel-type, while Disable can disrupt Choice-locked Pokemon from potentially breaking its Substitute or attacking Dragapult in general. Substitute allows Dragapult to ease prediction and also adds a layer of protection against status moves, allowing it to set up on more passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. It also synergizes well with Disable, allowing Dragapult to set up with ease. Will-O-Wisp is another option over Disable to allow Clodsire and Quagsire to become setup bait, while also crippling Kingambit and Ting-Lu; however, Disable is more consistent. Leftovers allows Dragapult to use Substitute multiple times throughout a game and be more annoying overall with Disable, while Dragon Fang is a good choice to boost Dragon Darts.</p> <p>Skeledirge is a fantastic partner, as it can wall Fairy-types such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Hatterene while also threatening foes like Kingambit that can easily take out Dragapult with their STAB priority moves. Gholdengo is another fantastic partner that can threaten Fairy-types like Klefki and Flutter Mane, if Gholdengo uses a Choice Scarf, and take care of physical walls such as opposing Skeledirge. Brambleghast is another good partner, as it can keep entry hazards off of the field, allowing Dragapult to come in multiple times, as well as providing Spikes support to soften up Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Iron Treads. Hisuian Zoroark provides the team with not just a Ghost immunity, but also can easily use Illusion to disguise itself as Dragapult and lure in foes that would normally threaten it, such as Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and opposing Dragapult, to open up for a potential Dragapult sweep. Flutter Mane is another great partner thanks to its ability to handle opposing Dragon-types such as Baxcalibur, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. It can also provide immediate speed control if need be to take care of other Choice Scarf users that could revenge kill Dragapult before it gets a Dragon Dance up. Mimikyu is an amazing wallbreaker that can either help wear down physical walls for Dragapult to clean up or can take advantage of Dragapult punching holes in the opponent's team to clean up itself. Mimikyu can also heavily threaten opposing Ghost-types for Dragapult like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo thanks to its STAB priority in Shadow Sneak. It also provides a one-time check to setup sweepers such as Chien-Pao and Kingambit thanks to its ability Disguise.</p>"

Close Combat targets Pokemon like Zamazenta-C and Dialga. Zacian's last moveslot is relatively flexible; Tera Blast is generally preferred with either Tera Fire or Ground to hit Pokemon like Magearna, Solgaleo, Arceus-Fire, and Skarmory, although if they are not an issue, Psychic Fangs to hit Arceus-Poison and Toxapex without having to Terstallize and Crunch to hit Deoxys and Mewtwo are viable options. Tera Fire and Ground also provide immunities to burns and Thunder Wave, respectively. If Zacian is running Crunch, Tera Dark can be used to boost said move and provide an immunity to Psychic-type attacks from the likes of Deoxys and Mewtwo. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Zacian to stay healthy and be great in the Sticky Web matchup. Zacian best fits on offensive teams looking for a solid late-game cleaner. Zacian struggles against bulkier, physically defensive Pokemon like Magearna, Skarmory, and Toxapex, so Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Deoxys, and Arceus-Dark that can handle these threats are helpful to have. Zacian has four-moveslot syndrome, so it also appreciates support from teammates like Landorus-T and Chi-Yu that can deal with the Pokemon that Zacian can't hit, like Arceus-Fire and Skarmory. Pokemon like Choice Specs Kyurem-W, Mewtwo, and Giratina like having Zacian threaten out Pokemon they struggle against like Palkia-O and Kingambit. Entry hazard support from the likes of Deoxys and Dialga helps wear down Zacian's checks, allowing it to function as a more threatening cleaner; in return, Zacian removes Pokemon they have problems with like Kingambit, Palkia-O, and Arceus-Dark for them.

Tera Fighting can boost Close Combat to extreme levels, allowing it to break through Pokemon like Magearna and Solgaleo. Tera Ground is notable for providing an immunity to Thunder Wave and a powerful option to break through checks like Toxapex, Magearna, and Solgaleo in Tera Blast Ground. Zacian best fits as a wallbreaker on bulky offense and balance teams. Great Tusk and Landorus-T are excellent partners for Zacian, being able to set up Stealth Rock to chip down foes and also threaten the Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon like Magearna and Arceus-Poison that it is weak to. Late-game cleaners like Arceus-Fire, Sneasler, and Arceus-Grass enjoy the gaps Zacian creates in defensive cores providing them with opportunities to set up and sweep weakened teams.</p>"

Covert Cloak prevents burns from Palkia-O's Steam Eruption and protects against status conditions inflicted by Nuzzle and Mortal Spin.

Knock Off removes important items like Choice Band and Assault Vest from Pokemon like Groudon and Ting-Lu, respectively, as well as removing Imposter Chansey's Eviolite. Will-O-Wisp neutralizes most physical attackers like Koraidon. Spirit Shackle threatens to trap and eliminate Imposter users and physical threats walled by Zacian.

          "description": "<p>Iron Defense Zamazenta is a fast sweeper for offense that also happens to blanket check most of the physical metagame with great matchups into key threats such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Weavile. It acts as a strong form of role compression that can make use of its great bulk, a Defense boost from Dauntless Shield, and its high Speed stat to find opportunities to use Iron Defense to not only bolster its survivability but also strengthen the power of its Body Press. Crunch is a necessity to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking that aren't threatened by Body Press, while its last moveslot is more flexible; Heavy Slam gives Zamazenta super effective coverage into Fairy-types that otherwise would wall it such as Clefable, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant, while Substitute allows Zamazenta to dodge status moves from the likes of Gliscor, Galarian Slowking, and Toxapex along with helping to block revenge killing attempts from faster Pokemon such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Stone Edge is an alternative that gives Zamazenta a non-contact option to hit Volcarona and Zapdos while still giving it coverage to hit Enamorus, at the expense of losing its ability to hit other Fairy-types and the benefit of Substitute's status and revenge killing protection. 168 EVs in Speed allow Zamazenta to outrun Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance while also outrunning key threats like Weavile and Darkrai. Zamazenta can then choose to invest EVs into HP for better overall bulk or into Attack for stronger coverage moves; notably, maximum HP investment ensures that Zamazenta will survive Choice Scarf Enamorus's Moonblast from full while also avoiding a 2HKO from Clefable. Choosing to maximize Attack gives Zamazenta a clean 2HKO on offensive Gholdengo with Crunch and on both Clefable and Hatterene with Heavy Slam. The remaining EVs are invested in Defense to improve Zamazenta's bulk and give it a stronger Body Press. Tera Steel is one of Zamazenta's best options, defensively flipping the matchup into Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks from foes like Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, Deoxys-S, and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon while also powering up Heavy Slam to OHKO both Enamorus and Iron Valiant even without Attack investment. Tera Steel also gives Zamazenta a crucial immunity to Toxic from Gliscor and Toxapex. Tera Fire serves to grant Zamazenta a key Fairy resistance without making it weak to Fighting-type moves from Iron Valiant, but the primary draw of this Tera type is an immunity to burn, a particularly important quality against Dragapult and Skeledirge, the former of which being able to burn even Substitute variants of Zamazenta with Infiltrator. Tera Fairy is another solid defensive typing for Zamazenta, granting it a great defensive profile that includes a resistance to Fighting-type attacks that helps out immensely in the Iron Defense mirror matchup against both Zamazenta and Skarmory, as well as an immunity to Dragapult's Draco Meteor and a retained resistance to Dark-type attacks that allows you to still check Weavile and Roaring Moon; Tera Ghost is an option that leans even heavier into beating opposing Iron Defense users at the expense of granting little defensive value.</p> <p>Zamazenta is a great fit on both bulky offense and hyper offense teams that need a fast offensive piece with good matchups into the tier's physical threats, in particular providing a crucial Kingambit check to a team. However, to be able to fully leverage its defensive value, it appreciates entry hazard removal to allow it to switch in without taking chip damage on entry and potentially being neutered entirely by Toxic Spikes. Hatterene is a particularly good partner in this regard, as it not only blocks entry hazards but can also be used to weaken shared checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge, and Great Tusk can clear hazards from the field along with helping to wear down Gliscor and force in and chip down Gholdengo attempting to block Rapid Spin. Rillaboom also serves as a great pairing that helps to bolster Zamazenta's longevity, with the additional healing from Grassy Terrain making Zamazenta much more difficult to remove from the field. Zamazenta's ability to check the tier's offensive Dark-types is also a valuable quality for hyper offense teams that opt to run a hazard lead like Glimmora or Deoxys-S, as these builds often use Gholdengo to block hazard removal; this will often give threats like Kingambit, Weavile, and Hisuian Samurott free attacks that necessitate an offensive switch-in that Zamazenta provides. Zamazenta is then able to take advantage of these Pokemon by using them as setup fodder. Gholdengo itself is a strong partner to Zamazenta, able to switch into Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks from Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Hatterene while also taking advantage of Zamazenta's defensive checks like Galarian Slowking and Clefable being unable to touch it. Zamazenta's relatively low wallbreaking power unfortunately leaves it struggling to muscle through Unaware walls like Dondozo, Skeledirge, and Clodsire, while its inability to boost the strength of its coverage moves makes bulkier Pokemon that don't fear Body Press like defensive Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking hard to break through; Zamazenta matches up best into opposing offense teams, and so balance breakers and stallbreakers are appreciated to support it in its other matchups. One strong offensive pairing with Zamazenta is Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, as it can weaken Skarmory and remove its Rocky Helmet to allow Zamazenta to later break through it. In particular, Roaring Moon's ability to chunk Dondozo and force it to take hazard damage with Knock Off is much appreciated to help Zamazenta make progress against it. Kingambit is another excellent teammate for Zamazenta, loading well into bulkier teams and heavily pressuring Dondozo while also being able to switch into Dragapult, Gholdengo and Hatterene that may come in to force Zamazenta out. A great partner to Zamazenta on hyper offensive teams is Booster Energy Iron Valiant, able to weaken shared checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge for Zamazenta to later break through. Iron Valiant also provides hyper offensive teams with a temporary form of speed control that can outrun Dragapult and Deoxys-S, both of which outspeed and can threaten Zamazenta with strong special attacks, or, in Dragapult's case, debilitating status with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

Its natural bulk and Dauntless Shield give it opportunities to wallbreak via its prowess in offensively checking Mega Lopunny, Hisuian Samurott, and Ogerpon-W. Stone Edge pairs fantastically with Zamazenta's STAB, nailing Volcarona, Zapdos, Moltres, and Tornadus-T while avoiding adverse contact effects from the former three. Ice Fang is Zamazenta's only option to break through Gliscor and Landorus-T and its strongest attack against Dragonite. Heavy Slam is the preferred last coverage move to hit Clefable and render Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant incapable of soft checking Zamazenta, while Crunch threatens Psychic-types in Galarian Slowking, Slowbro, and Mega Latias. Wild Charge is Zamazenta's strongest attack against Toxapex but deals pitiful damage regardless without a Choice Band and can still be easily pivoted against even with the boost. Heavy-Duty Boots increase Zamazenta's longevity, allowing it to switch in and threaten opposing teams more often, whereas Choice Band provides more immediate power, albeit at the cost of being incredibly prediction-reliant to break through most teams carrying multiple Fighting-resistant foes. Rockium Z is a niche alternative that reduces difficulties in KOing Zapdos by minimizing the need for prior chip damage mitigating and Stone Edge's meager accuracy. It also helps in breaking through Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Clefable and Galarian Slowking without the correct coverage move once properly chipped. Tera Fighting is preferred to boost Close Combat's power against neutral targets such as Ogerpon-W and Alomomola, with chances to OHKO and 2HKO them, respectively, without Choice Band and muscle through checks such as Tornadus-T. Alternatively, Tera Steel flips the tables against Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's revenge killing attempts and secures the KO on Clefable after minimal chip. Zamazenta can fit on more defensive teams as speed control that forces out offensive terrors such as Ogerpon-W to supplement a defensive core, or it can be used on offensive teams supported by other wallbreakers while helping check threats to such teams such as Mega Lopunny with its natural bulk and Dauntless Shield. Regardless, its best support remains Future Sight from Tapu Lele, Galarian Slowking, or Slowbro, as Zamazenta is most often handled by switching between Pokemon that resist its moves and physically bulky pivots such as Galarian Slowking, Landorus-T, and Alomomola or stopped in its tracks by Toxapex. Future Sight punishes these situations by dealing massive damage, particularly against Toxapex. Similarly, Pursuit support from Mega Tyranitar and Weavile weakens or removes pivots such as Galarian Slowking, Mega Latias, and Zapdos.</p>"

Substitute allows Zamazenta to set up on Pokemon such as Gliscor and Alomomola that heavily rely on Toxic for their offensive pressure and to be unthreatened by Knock Off from the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Hisuian Samurott, while Heavy Slam allows Zamazenta to immediately threaten Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, both of which commonly use Choice Scarf and Booster Energy respectively to outspeed Zamazenta and have enough bulk coupled with a Fighting resistance to take a Body Press and threaten Zamazenta immediately. Alternatively, Crunch can be used to deal with Galarian Slowking and is also stronger than Heavy Slam against Pokemon such as Ferrothorn that commonly Terastallize into the Ghost typing, and Stone Edge is another option that threatens Volcarona and Zapdos while avoiding Flame Body and Static, respectively, and allows Zamazenta to deal with Tornadus-T without the need to Terastallize. Zamazenta struggles to break through Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking, Zapdos, and Toxapex that have the bulk to take multiple boosted Body Press and either threaten it back directly or can use Haze to remove Zamazenta's boosts. Therefore, teammates such as Mega Tyranitar that can Pursuit trap and wear down these Pokemon are invaluable. Other options such as Calm Mind Iron Valiant can also trade for heavy damage against most of these Pokemon, clearing the way for Zamazenta to sweep. Tera Electric allows Zamazenta to turn Zapdos into a setup opportunity, resisting both of its STAB attacks and being unafraid of Static, while Tera Steel allows Zamazenta to set up on Choice-locked Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant as well as turning Heavy Slam into an OHKO on both.</p>"

Choice Band Zamazenta can also opt to run Play Rough to target Sableye, which typically can switch into Zamazenta's attacks safely.</p> <p><strong>Iron Defense</strong>: Crunch provides good coverage against Ghost-types such as Hisuian Zoroark and Dragapult that otherwise would be able to wall Zamazenta. However, Crunch is mostly useless against Ghost-types with recovery such as bulky Gholdengo and Skeledirge. Stone Edge is able to take care of Zapdos and Moltres, which can cripple Zamazenta otherwise with Static and Flame Body respectively, as well as other Flying-types such as Tornadus-T. An alternative EV spread of 212 HP / 56 Def / 240 Spe can be used to ensure that Quagsire's Earthquake will not break Zamazenta's Substitute while still outspeeding Barraskewda.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Choice Band Zamazenta is a solid wallbreaker on Fighting teams since it is one of the fastest and strongest Pokemon in the tier, outspeeding swift offensive threats like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane while utilizing its coverage to break a multitude of defensive Pokemon in the metagame. Heavy Slam is key to targeting opposing Fairy-type Pokemon like Hatterene and the aforementioned Flutter Mane. Ice Fang is able to OHKO specially defensive Gliscor, which Fighting teams have difficulty taking down. Moreover, it is also Zamazenta's best move to target the Landorus formes. Alternatively, Psychic Fangs allows Zamazenta to target opposing Poison-types, letting it OHKO Sneasler and Okidogi, as well as 2HKO mixed Toxapex and Galarian Weezing. Wild Charge is yet another coverage option that OHKOes Pelipper, has a chance to 2HKO Toxapex, and threatens various Flying-type Pokemon such as Articuno and Moltres. Finally, Crunch targets opposing Ghost-types such as Spectrier and Gholdengo. 8 HP EVs in conjunction with 32 Special Defense EVs prevent Zamazenta from being OHKOed by Choice Scarf Flutter Mane's Moonblast, allowing Zamazenta to revenge kill it with Heavy Slam.</p> <p>Choice Band Zamazenta appreciates Great Tusk's ability to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin so it is not chipped down over time by Spikes. Great Tusk is also able to assist Zamazenta by setting Stealth Rock so Zamazenta has an easier time securing OHKOs against Pokemon such as Gliscor. Choice Scarf Sneasler pairs well with Zamazenta due to its ability to dispatch opposing Fairy-type Pokemon like Enamorus and Azumarill. Sneasler can also use Switcheroo to disrupt defensive walls such as Toxapex by removing their items and locking them into a status move, allowing Zamazenta to eventually wear them down. Iron Valiant is a beneficial partner for Zamazenta, being able to threaten Sableye and Mandibuzz as well as other physical walls such as Toxapex and Gliscor, which can be useful depending on Zamazenta's choice of coverage moves. With a Choice Scarf, Iron Valiant can further threaten Dragapult and opposing Zamazenta, and cripple defensive walls with Trick. Assault Vest Iron Hands can act as a switch-in to opposing Fairy-type Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Flutter Mane and threaten them back with Heavy Slam. Iron Hands is also useful in handling opposing Flying-types like Corviknight, Articuno, and Gliscor thanks to its Electric and Ice coverage, and can further provide Zamazenta with a safe switch in thanks to Volt Switch. Kommo-o can block Gholdengo's Shadow Ball with Bulletproof and threaten it in return with Flamethrower, which is useful as this is a foe Zamazenta struggles to deal with. Kommo-o finds extra utility as a switch-in to Skeledirge, and can force it out if opting to run Choice Specs. In return, Zamazenta can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and threaten them with Heavy Slam, which otherwise stop Kommo-o easily. Hisuian Lilligant pairs well with Zamazenta, taking on defensive Gliscor, Clodsire, and Dragonite with its Hustle-boosted Ice Spinner. It is also able to use its Grass-type STAB moves to threaten bulky Water-types that can switch into Zamazenta such as Dondozo and Azumarill. Gallade threatens opposing Poison-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Amoonguss; in exchange, Gallade appreciates Zamazenta's ability to punish Landorus-T with Ice Fang. Okidogi, like Sneasler, can threaten Fairy-types like Azumarill and Iron Valiant. In addition, Okidogi's use of Taunt + Bulk Up can stallbreak Zamazenta's defensive checks like Toxapex and Corviknight. Urshifu-R is another excellent teammate to Zamazenta, with its Surging Strikes proving deadly to many of Zamazenta's most troublesome foes such as Gliscor, Skeledirge, Ceruledge, and Volcarona.</p>"

        "Iron Defense": {
          "description": "<p>Zamazenta excels in matchups that Fighting typically struggles against, such as the Fighting mirror, Ground, and Fairy, since it is able to outspeed threats such as Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, set up Iron Defense on physical attackers, and punish more passive Pokemon. Substitute allows Zamazenta to take advantage of passive foes such as Gliscor, Clodsire, and Amoonguss that can't break its Substitute in one hit, allowing it to start setting up Iron Defense and preventing it from being hindered by status. Heavy Slam is important, as Zamazenta outspeeds big Fairy-type threats such as non-Choice Scarf Enamorus and Flutter Mane. Heavy Slam also prevents Zamazenta from being walled by Iron Valiant in the Fighting mirror matchup. 252 Speed EVs allow Zamazenta to outspeed Jolly Barraskewda outside of rain and Flutter Mane, while 248 HP EVs allow it to set up four Substitutes.</p> <p>Iron Hands, with its great special bulk paired with Assault Vest, complements Zamazenta's physical bulk well, being able to take hits from threatening Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene while also being a big help in the Flying matchup with its access to Ice Punch and Thunder Punch to hit Zapdos and Enamorus-T. Great Tusk provides great physical bulk alongside Zamazenta and is also able to bring wallbreaking potential, with access to Ice Spinner to hit Flying-types such as Gliscor and Headlong Rush to hit Poison-types such as Unaware Clodsire and Toxapex, which are both hindrances for Zamazenta. Great Tusk is also able to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin to prevent passive chip on Zamazenta while also running Knock Off to prevent Ghost-types from spinblocking. Iron Valiant provides the special offense Fighting desperately needs in order to break physical walls such as Dondozo and Slowbro that Zamazenta struggles against, and is also able to hit Ghost-types that can wall Zamazenta, such as Skeledirge and Sinistcha, with Shadow Ball. Iron Valiant can also run Trick to disable Toxapex and Clodsire and stop them from stalling out Zamazenta. Sneasler provides great coverage against Fairy-types, with Dire Claw being able to hit threats such as Enamorus. Additionally, Choice Scarf Sneasler outspeeds Choice Specs Flutter Mane while also being able to set up Toxic Spikes to cripple more defensive Pokemon such as Scream Tail. Sneasler also can run Switcheroo to hinder Toxapex and Clodsire, similarly to Iron Valiant. It also offers great pivot potential with U-turn, and can put Pokemon like Unaware Quagsire, which normally walls Zamazenta, on a timer when paired with Poison Touch. Hisuian Lilligant is a great setup threat with its access to Victory Dance and is able to threaten Flying- and Water-types such as Azumarill, Zapdos, and Toxapex with Ice Spinner and Leaf Blade at +1. Hisuian Lilligant also has access to Healing Wish as support for Zamazenta. Choice Band Galarian Zapdos is a great wallbreaker, 2HKOing Toxapex and Sinistcha. Another great wallbreaker is Urshifu-R, which helps with the Ghost matchup because it can deal with Gholdengo and Skeledirge if it is using a Choice Band or after a Swords Dance boost. Gallade is a niche Pokemon to use but helps with the Poison matchup that Zamazenta struggles with, thanks to its access to Sharpness-boosted Psycho Cut. It's also able to run Assault Vest to lure and remove Enamorus's Choice Scarf with Knock Off, which allows Zamazenta to use Heavy Slam against it. Assault Vest also lets Gallade deal with Quagsire and Toxapex instead of forcing a prediction.</p>"

Zamazenta-C suffers from being worn down by entry hazards, so a hazard remover like Great Tusk or Giratina is needed.

Tera Fire also helps against Zacian-C, lets Fire Blast OHKO Tera Steel Giratina-O after Stealth Rock, and lets Flamethrower OHKO Zacian-C. Tera Dragon boosts Dynamax Cannon, 2HKOing bulky Arceus formes, 3HKOing Ting-Lu, and 2HKOing bulky Kyogre. Eternatus appreciates teammates that put pressure on Ting-Lu, which include Pokemon like Swords Dance Koraidon, Nasty Plot Calyrex-S, Extreme Killer Arceus, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Fairy. Calyrex-S, Eternatus, and Miraidon weaken Ting-Lu for each other, enabling one of them to potentially sweep. This allows Pokemon like Extreme Killer Arceus, Arceus-Fairy, and Arceus-Ground to use Eternatus getting revenge killed as an opportunity. Extreme Killer Arceus can use Choice-locked Calyrex-S as an opportunity to set up Swords Dance, Arceus-Fairy can use Koraidon to set up Calm Mind, and Arceus-Ground can threaten out Zacian-C, enabling it to set up Dragon Dance or Calm Mind. Hyper offense leads such as Ribombee, which lets Eternatus outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, and Glimmora, which sets up entry hazards to weaken checks such as Ting-Lu, are appreciated.</p>"

Aqua Jet threatens frailer revenge killers, taking out faster targets like Flutter Mane, Sandy Shocks, and Volcarona after a Swords Dance boost.

Heavy-Duty Boots improves the matchup against hazard stacking teams like Poison; however, Punching Glove is preferred to use Surging Strikes freely without activating Rocky Helmet chip or Static, easing the Flying matchup and minimizing the need for predictions.</p> <p>Great Tusk is an amazing teammate, providing Stealth Rock to enhance Urshifu-R's wallbreaking abilities and removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin if Urshifu-R isn't using Heavy-Duty Boots.

Adamant can make sense if using Swords Dance and Aqua Jet together, having a better chance of sweeping late-game against fast threats that often run some bulk investment, such as Flutter Mane and Choice Band Chein-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Bulk Up</strong>: Bulk Up takes advantage of Urshifu-R's underrated physical bulk, though it will fail to wallbreak defensive foes like Cresselia as easily.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trailblaze</strong>: While difficult to fit in coverage-wise, Trailblaze's Speed boost can be a shocking win condition considering Urshifu-R's decent Speed, letting it outspeed even Iron Bundle!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Urshifu-R is able to function perfectly fine without Terastallization, though it has both offensive and defensive uses for it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: The Tera Water boost to Surging Strikes makes Urshifu-R even more difficult to wall, with even Ting-Lu that lack Sitrus Berry being OHKOed by +2 Surging Strikes. It also makes Aqua Jet a more effective cleaning move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison gifts Urshifu-R a key Fairy and Fighting resistance, in addition to absorbing Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a strong defensive option for Urshifu-R, letting it take on Fairy, Grass, Flying, and Psychic attacks that normally threaten to OHKO it. It also means Iron Bundle will no longer OHKO Urshifu-R with Freeze-Dry. However unlike Tera Poison, it's an issue when fighting opposing Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: When paired with Thunder Punch, this is Urshifu-R's best shot of breaking through Primarina and wearing down Dondozo, in addition to giving it a useful Electric-type resistance and paralysis immunity.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove</strong>: Punching Gloves protects Urshifu-R from taking devastating damage by hitting Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin with Surging Strikes, in addition to boosting other punching moves.

The Speed EVs outspeed Adamant Breloom, and the Attack EVs give Urshifu-R a high chance to OHKO Focus Sash Chien-Pao with Tera Water Surging Strikes.</li> </ul>"

Ice Spinner hits foes that resist Urshifu-R's STAB attacks, such as Eternatus and Dragonite. Alternatively, Zen Headbutt can be used for better outs against Toxapex while still hitting Eternatus. U-turn allows Urshifu-R to switch out of bad matchups such as Arceus-Water and generate momentum. Metagrossite ensures that Urshifu-R can act as a fast pivot, outpacing foes like Eternatus, Scizorite Weavile, Lucarionite Walking Wake. Alternatively, Aerodactylite or Blue Orb can be used if another teammate like Galarian Zapdos is using Metagrossite to enhance Urshifu-R's wallbreaking potential, with Aerodactylite sets always 2HKOing defensive Eternatus with Ice Spinner and Blue Orb sets 2HKOing Arceus-Fairy with Surging Strikes, albeit at the cost of being outsped by the aforementioned Pokemon. Urshifu-R fits well with other offensive pivots, such as Raikou and Walking Wake, pressuring structures involving Pokemon like Eternatus and bulky Water-types like Arceus-Water and Toxapex. Setup sweepers like Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, and Lunala also appreciate Urshifu-R's ability to safely pivot them in. Urshifu-R is vulnerable to -ate Speed users, such as Altarianite Regieleki, Hisuian Arcanine, and Dragonite, so teammates that help in dealing with them such as Arceus-Ground, Galarian Slowking, and Solgaleo are appreciated. Urshifu-R also has difficulty in dealing with bulky Arceus formes, especially Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Water, so Pokemon that beat them such as Eternatus and the aforementioned Raging Bolt make great partners.</p>"

Drain Punch grants Zarude a form of recovery while still 2HKOing Hisuian Goodra and Heatran, whereas Close Combat grants Zarude a stronger Fighting-type coverage.

In return, Zarude can threaten the Psychic-types Amoonguss loses to, like Hatterene, Armarouge, and Iron Leaves. Choice Scarf Meowscarada makes for another good teammate, as it can outspeed and threaten Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Dragapult, and Hydreigon with Play Rough. In return, Zarude can handle the aforementioned Steel-types that Meowscarada struggles with, and the two of the form a strong U-turn core to complement their teammates. Hisuian Electrode and Rotom-C is a great addition on any Grass team, as thanks to its Speed tier and Electric typing, it can threaten slower Flying-types such as Corviknight and Enamorus as well as Water-types like Toxapex and Volcanion. Zarude's wallbreaking and support role enables sweepers like Hisuian Liligant to sweep Flying thanks to the latter's access to Ice Spinner as well as being able to clean Steel teams. Brambleghast and Toedscruel make for great teammates, as they can set up hazards to wear down incoming Pokemon for Zarude to break easier and remove them with Rapid Spin to enhance Zarude's pivoting ability. Toedscruel also has enough Special Defense to survive a Flamethrower from Choice Scarf Iron Moth and OHKO it back. On the other hand, Brambleghast's Ghost typing also allows it to spinblock, thus preserving hazards on the field, and thanks to its ability Wind Rider, it can switch into anticipated Flying-type attacks. Iron Leaves makes for another great partner, being able to provide Grass teams a positive matchup against Fighting and Poison teams.

Volt Switch lets Regieleki punish foes like Amoonguss, Galarian Slowking, and Hisuian Goodra, which can take advantage of it, allowing teammates like Zapdos and Iron Hands to exploit them instead. Rapid Spin leverages Regieleki's capability to force opponents to bring in a Ground-type or risk significant damage, providing Electric teams with much-needed entry hazard control. Thunder Wave mitigates the threat of Hisuian Lilligant, Spectrier, and Zamazenta if Regieleki is unable to finish these off. Heavy-Duty Boots enhances Regieleki's ability to pivot and consistently remove entry hazards. Alternatively, 28 Atk EVs in conjunction with a Naive nature could be considered, and Magnet is recommended when using Regieleki with Wild Charge to secure an OHKO against Flutter Mane. Magnet also enables Regieleki to reach specific damage thresholds, such as OHKOing Iron Valiant with Thunderbolt. A Timid or Naive nature with maximum Speed EVs is needed to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Hisuian Zoroark.</p> <p>Given that Ground-types like Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Quagsire shut down Regieleki's antics, teammates like Nasty Plot Rotom-W, Swords Dance Iron Hands, and Substitute Zapdos that capitalize on these are crucial for its success. It's important to keep in mind that the player using Regieleki can also choose to double out when anticipating a Ground-type switch-in, allowing teammates to threaten these walls.

Magnezone can equip an Assault Vest to check Choice Scarf users like Flutter Mane and Greninja, which zoom past Regieleki, and it can wear down Landorus-T and Quagsire as they repeatedly switch in.

Extreme Speed with Glalitite or Pinsirite gives Regieleki an Ice-type coverage move or Flying-type STAB attack, allowing it to threaten Pokemon like Arceus-Ground, Great Tusk, and Clodsire that would otherwise completely wall it and revenge kill setup sweepers like Dragonite. Explosion is a great one-time nuke that lets Regieleki to potentially OHKO Pokemon like Calm Mind Arceus formes and give a partner a safe switch in. Rapid Spin allows Regieleki to support teammates like Dragonite by removing entry hazards, but Supercell Slam can be for opted instead, giving Regieleki a powerful physical Electric-type STAB move against Pokemon looking to switch into Volt Switch like Solgaleo and Ho-Oh. The given EVs allow Regieleki to outspeed opposing Altarianite Regieleki. Regieleki can oftentimes struggle to muscle through physically defensive walls like Lunala and Arceus-Poison, so Pokemon like Arceus-Ground, Landorus, and Raging Bolt who can threaten these Pokemon are helpful. Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Galarian Zapdos, and Raikou can form powerful VoltTurn cores with Regieleki, as they threaten Pokemon like Great Tusk and Arceus that Regieleki can struggle against; in return, Regieleki can help chip away at Pokemon like Dragonite and Raging Bolt. While generally outclassed by Altarianite Regieleki, running Pinsirite or Glalitite on Regieleki is most common to free up a teammate like Dragonite or Hisuian Arcanine to run Altarianite. Regieleki's weaker Ice-type coverage means it is more reliant on Explosion and its Electric-type attacks to dent foes, but it has better overall coverage on most threats. Pinsirite Regieleki's Flying typing makes it more vulnerable to Stealth Rock, but its more powerful Extreme Speed easily punishes common Pixilate switch-ins like Galarian Slowking and Red Orb Landorus.</p>"

Tera Blast 2HKOes defensive Great Tusk and chips defensive Kommo-o and Zapdos, while Thunderbolt can be used to better pressure Corviknight and Ice-resistant foes such as Manaphy, Iron Moth, and Heatran attempting to switch in. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Regieleki ignore the entry hazards it removes, while Never-Melt Ice lets Extreme Speed OHKO Hisuian Electrode and specially defensive Garchomp and lets Tera Blast 2HKO defensive Zapdos.

          "description": "<p>Spectrier is a deadly special attacker that is able to quickly snowball against teams thanks to its high Speed, outrinning some of the metagame's fastest threats like Greninja and Iron Valiant. Spectrier utilizes Draining Kiss to hit Dark-type Pokemon that would otherwise resist its STAB Shadow Ball like the aforementioned Greninja as well as non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Roaring Moon. Draining Kiss also serves as a secondary recovery option to help heal off the damage taken by setting up a Substitute. Nasty Plot is used to elevate Spectrier's Special Attack to incredible heights without having to KO foes beforehand. Spectrier shines best when it is able to set up a Substitute, and subsequently a Nasty Plot, in the face of a more passive foe like Toxapex, then begin spamming its scarcely resisted Shadow Ball + Draining Kiss combination. Leftovers is used to provide more substantial recovery than Draining Kiss, but Colbur Berry is an option to take a Dark-type attack from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Chien-Pao, and Barraskewda. Will-O-Wisp should be used instead of Substitute if Colbur Berry is the item of choice, as it allows Spectrier to capitalize on surviving an attack from these extremely potent physical threats. If Will-O-Wisp is preferred over Substitute, Hex can also be used to deal more damage to burned threats.</p> <p>Skeledirge can switch into strong physical attacks from Pokemon that threaten Spectrier such as Choice Scarf Gallade, Scizor, Ceruledge, and Mimikyu lacking Shadow Claw, then scare them with Will-O-Wisp. Mimikyu is also a great teammate, as it can help Spectrier deal with Pokemon that may not go down to a single Draining Kiss, such as Ting-Lu, as well as Kingambit and Chien-Pao if Disguise is in tact. Mimikyu is also able to finish off threats such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult with Shadow Sneak. Froslass and Brambleghast are teammates that work well with Spectrier, setting up Spikes for Spectrier to nab easier KOs and snowball with Grim Neigh. Froslass is also able to use Thunder Wave to slow down faster Pokemon, while Brambleghast is able to remove entry hazards via Rapid Spin, allowing Spectrier to pivot more freely. Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is a great teammate thanks to its incredible Speed and ablility to deal with common Choice Scarf users that give Spectrier trouble such as Gholdengo, Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk. STAB Moonblast can also damage or remove Dark-type Pokemon to make Spectrier's job easier. Finally, Hisuian Zoroark is a solid teammate due to its ability to switch into Ghost-type attacks that would otherwise threaten Spectrier and all of its other teammates. Hisuian Zoroark can also apply utility support by wearing down opposing teams with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off. Dragapult is a great teammate, as it can burn and force damage on common walls like Quagsire, Clodsire, Alolan Muk and Ting-Lu, and forcing damage on them to make sweeping easier. It is also important to note that burned Quagsire and Clodsire cannot break Spectrier's Substitute in one hit, making setting up a lot easier. Finally, bulky Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a great teammate for Spectrier. Gholdengo can wear down Dark- and Poison-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Clodsire, which Spectrier struggle with, while Spectrier can help with faster threats like Dragon- and Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Hydreigon and Great Tusk.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Spectrier is an exceptional setup sweeper on Ghost teams due to its great Speed tier, incredible ability, and access to various utility options, allowing it to snowball through Poison, Ground, and Flying teams. Spectrier's combination of Calm Mind and Will-O-Wisp is notably important, as it allows Spectrier to be an annoyance to both physical and special attackers. Hex in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp deals immense damage versus threats like Corviknight, Toxapex, and Hisuian Goodra as well as takes advantage of Pokemon reliant on status ailments to function such as Poison Heal Gliscor and Guts Heracross. Substitute protects Spectrier from status ailments inflicted by passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Quagsire. Furthermore, Substitute provides more opportunities to set up Calm Mind boosts and denies the opponent of a chance to revenge kill Spectrier. The given EV spread allows Spectrier to outpace non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada, prevents Spectrier's Substitute from being broken by burned Assault Vest Iron Hands, and prevents Spectrier from being OHKOed by a burned Supreme Overlord Kingambit using Kowtwo Kleave with five fainted allies.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is incredibly valued as a teammate due to its ability to threaten Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Greninja, Baxcalibur, Galarian Moltres, and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon as well as faster Ghost-types such as Swift Swim Basculegion, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. In return, Spectrier threatens special walls like Hisuian Goodra, Clodsire, and Gliscor. Focus Sash Ceruledge threatens special walls like Articuno and Heatran as well as takes on faster Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult with Shadow Sneak, appreciating Spectrier's ability to burn walls. Air Balloon Gholdengo is a great asset in the Fairy and Ice matchups, beating Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Baxcalibur, and Alolan Ninetales as well as Ursaluna-B and Empoleon. Hex Dragapult spreads even more status ailments to set up Spectrier for success late-game and threatens Kommo-o, Hydreigon, and Baxcalibur. Additionally, Choice Band Dragapult 2HKOes Alolan Muk with Dragon Darts, threatens opposing Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo with Sucker Punch, and OHKOes Hoopa-U with U-turn, also offering pivoting. Choice Scarf Dragapult also provides U-turn and can outpace Choice Scarf users like Roaring Moon and Walking Wake. Brambleghast and Froslass wear down defensive switch-ins such as Heatran, Ting-Lu, and Alolan Muk with Spikes, while Brambleghast also removes Toxic Spikes using Rapid Spin. Hisuian Zoroark offers a Ghost-type immunity and can spread burn with Will-O-Wisp, easing Spectrier's time setting up. Skeledirge checks Ogerpon-H, Choice Scarf Infernape, and Heatran using Earth Power and takes on setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Frosmoth while also outpacing Kingambit. Mimikyu checks Dark-types like Hoopa-U, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and Hydreigon while also offering a one-time check to Chien-Pao, Greninja, and Kingambit due to Disguise. Sinistcha beats Water-types like Barraskewda and Urshifu-R as well as Ground-types such as Ursaluna-B and Landorus. Gengar offers Toxic Spikes to accumulate chip damage via Spectrier's Substitute and enhance the power of Hex.</p>"

Tera Ghost lets Astral Barrage achieve feats such as OHKOing Koraidon with a layer of Spikes, OHKOing Zacian-C after Rocky Helmet damage from a teammate, OHKOing defensive Arceus formes at +2, and 3HKOing Terastallized Ting-Lu.

Psyshock is preferred over Psychic because it hits Calm Mind Arceus formes harder, whereas Psychic always 2HKOes Arceus. Tera Ghost boosts Astral Barrage's damage to horrific levels, making it capable of OHKOing defensive Arceus formes after minor chip damage, and the lessened Ghost- and Dark-type weaknesses let Calyrex-S live Arceus's Shadow Claw and Arceus-Dark's Foul Play. Tera Grass instead boosts Grass Knot to be on par with Astral Barrage; it easily 2HKOes Arceus and Arceus-Dark and OHKOes Ting-Lu with two layers of Spikes. Calyrex-S's self sufficiency as a wallbreaker and tendency to overwhelm its checks make it very easy to fit on a variety of teams. Offensive teams appreciate its massive power and the utility provided from it outspeeding and OHKOing most offensive threats and can provide it ample opportunities with U-turn from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Koraidon.

Calyrex-S is a superb wallbreaker, so partners such as Miraidon and Calm Mind Arceus formes appreciate it forcing progress against special walls in Ting-Lu and Arceus. Calyrex-S can be pressured by a surprise Terastallization from Pokemon such as Giratina-O and Arceus, so having a solid defensive core with Arceus formes and Landorus-T or Toxapex is appreciated to check them.

Sharpness-boosted Stone Axe smashes common Flying- and Fire- types, such as Enamorus, Skeledirge, and Cinderace, while also setting up Stealth Rock in the same turn. Night Slash punishes Gholdengo, which resists all of Kleavor's other moves, though be wary that Kleavor can only 2HKO it even with Stealth Rock up. Aerial Ace is also an option to hit Great Tusk if it tries to switch in and remove entry hazards set by Kleavor. U-turn picks up momentum for the team and switches Kleavor out against foes such as Landorus-T, Iron Hands, and Azumarill. X-Scissor can be used to deal much more damage than U-turn thanks to being boosted by Sharpness, 2HKOing Amoonguss and Sableye. Close Combat helps Kleavor deal with Steel-types such as Kingambit and Heatran, though the latter requires chip damage to OHKO.</p> <p>All of Kleavor's teammates enjoy its ability to set up Stealth Rock while also dealing damage in the same turn. Volcarona and Frosmoth appreciate Kleavor's entry hazard support wearing down the opposing team and its ability to deal with Flying- and Fire-types, which enable them to set up and sweep late-game. In return, Volcarona can deal with Steel-types such as Corviknight and Gholdengo, while Frosmoth can deal with Ground- and Water-types such as Landorus-Th and Quagsire. Frosmoth is also a wincon against Flying- and Dragon-types when Stealth Rock is set up. Scizor acts as a sweeper that takes advantage of Kleavor weakening opposing teams, and it also forms a U-turn core that appreciates Kleavor's Fire neutrality with it. Additionally, Scizor can block Toxic from Clodsire and Mortal Spin from Glimmora, and threaten them with either Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch or setting up with Swords Dance. Lokix, Heracross, and Slither Wing also appreciate the opposing team being weakened by Kleavor, as well as the speed control Kleavor provides. This enables them to finish off foes by making use of priority moves and strong physical attacks, such as Lokix taking out Gholdengo with Sucker Punch or Throat Chop. Forretress provides great hazard control thanks to Rapid Spin, and it's also able to switch into strong physical attacks to scout thanks to its high physical defense and additional Steel typing that grants valuable neutralities that cover Kleavor's weaknesses. Forretress also makes a good pivot thanks to its slow speed and access to Volt Switch.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Kleavor is one of the best answers to Flying- and Fire-types, like Tornadus-T, Mega Charizard-Y, and Skeledirge, for Bug teams, thanks to its Sharpness-boosted Stone Axe, which has the added utility of automatically setting Stealth Rock. Close Combat synergizes well with Kleavor's STAB moves, crushing Steel-types like Iron Treads. U-turn allows Kleavor to pivot out of Great Tusk and Skarmory to bring in teammates like Araquanid or Volcarona. Night Slash banishes Ghost-types like Gholdengo, Knock Off softens walls like Corviknight and Porygon2 for its teammates, and X-Scissor takes down Slowbro to make way for Mega Pinsir. Araquanid and Galvantula are excellent teammates, as these set up Sticky Web to patch up Kleavor's unassuming speed, even when using a Choice Scarf, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Blacephalon. Additionally, they also help in dealing with pesky Fire- and Flying-types like Volcarona and Landorus, respectively. Physical setup sweepers benefit from Kleavor's ability to set hazards offensively, Knock Off items from walls, and deal with Skeledirge and Slowbro, which often wall Mega Pinsir, Scizor, and Mega Scizor. In return, they deal with Fighting- and Fairy-types like Great Tusk and Mega Diancie. Quiver Dance Volcarona appreciates Skeledirge removed, as this lets it clean up Ghost teams at +1; it can also be brought in against passive walls like Slowbro and Skarmory. Forretress provides Rapid Spin and loves Kleavor's ability to set Stealth Rock, as this allows it to run other hazards like Toxic Spikes or Volt Switch to better support the team. Lokix provides great offensive support with its access to priority in First Impression and Sucker Punch to finish off teams weakened by Kleavor through entry hazards and repeated Knock Offs. It is also a secondary check to Skeledirge, which Bug teams appreciate.</p>"

Headlong Rush is generally preferred for its higher power, but Earthquake is another good option that avoids Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet damage and lets Ursaluna leverage its good bulk. Fire Punch hits Corviknight, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Air Balloon Kingambit, which resist Ursaluna's STAB combination. Tera Normal boosts Facade to breathtaking levels, allowing it to cleanly 2HKO physically defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock. Tera Ghost is an alternative that lets Ursaluna avoid being revenge killed by Fighting-type attacks such as Close Combat from Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, or Sneasler. The given EV spread maximizes Ursaluna's damage output while also ensuring it outspeeds Skeledirge and standard Corviknight. On Trick Room teams, Ursaluna should run maximum Attack and HP investment, a Brave nature, and 0 Speed IVs.</p> <p>Ursaluna serves as an exceptionally powerful wallbreaker on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Garchomp is appreciated to make Ursaluna even more difficult to wall. Dual screens support from Dragapult can also be considered, since it will further reinforce Ursaluna's excellent bulk, and Dragapult can even provide free switches through Curse or U-turn. Against slower-paced teams, Ursaluna's great bulk and immunity to status give it many opportunities to switch in and start wreaking havoc, but it can struggle against faster-paced, more aggressive teams. Good partners for Ursaluna that excel against offense include Kingambit, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Zamazenta, which, in return, appreciate Ursaluna breaking through Pokemon such as Dondozo and Corviknight. Ursaluna enjoys U-turn or Volt Switch support from Rotom-W, Landorus-T, or Dragapult, letting it hit the field multiple times to fire off its insanely powerful attacks. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate for Ursaluna, as it can both provide momentum with Chilly Reception and supplement Ursaluna's firepower with Future Sight. Galarian Slowking can also switch into and pressure some of the Pokemon that give Ursaluna trouble, such as Iron Valiant. Trick Room support from Hatterene and Cresselia is an interesting option to turn Ursaluna's low Speed into an advantage.</p>"

After Flame Orb activates, Facade 2HKOes the bulkiest Pokemon in the metagame such as Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Amoonguss. Because of Flame Orb, Ursaluna can also function as a great status absorber. Earthquake is preferred over Headlong Rush, because it allows Ursaluna to maintain its remarkable bulk as well as having the added benefit of avoiding Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin damage. Swords Dance can be used to bolster Ursaluna's Attack to incredible heights, giving everything a tough time switching in. Drain Punch can be used to give Ursaluna more longevity, while Fire Punch can be used to hit targets like Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo for super effective damage. Alternatively, Ursaluna can run 140 Speed EVs in order to keep up with other pokemon in its Speed tier, such as Kingambit, and outspeeding slightly faster Pokemon that do not run any Speed investment such as Corviknight and Skeledirge. Max HP is used to maximize Ursaluna's bulk, while the 4 Speed EVs are used to outspeed any uninvested Pokemon of the same Speed tier, such as Iron Hands and Alolan Muk.</p> <p>Ursaluna greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Ting-Lu and Quagsire, as the extra damage could be the difference between a 2HKO and a 1HKO on physically defensive Rotom-W. Ursaluna also appreciates a teammate like Clodsire, which can switch into Water- and Fighting-type attacks from Urshifu-R, Azumarill, and Sneasler, both of which Ursaluna is weak to. Another great teammate for Ursaluna is Landorus-T, which can U-turn and allow Ursaluna to come in freely and launch its extremely powerful attacks. Alternatively, Landorus-I is a fantastic teammate for Ursaluna. Ursaluna is able to deal with the special walls that check Landorus and vice versa. Iron Treads is another great teammate for Ursaluna, as it keeps hazards off the field in order to prevent Ursaluna from taking more damage. Bulkier Pokemon that want to stick around for a long time, such as Ting-Lu, Quagsire, and Clodsire, greatly appreciate Ursaluna's presence, as it can freely switch in to status moves and Knock Off once Flame Orb has activated. Finally, Choice Scarf Great Tusk is another teammate that appreciates Ursaluna. Great Tusk is able to outspeed and OHKO Pokemon that check Ursaluna such as Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Choice Specs Greninja. Once Ursaluna has sufficiently weakened the opposing team, Great Tusk will have an easy time finishing the game with its high speed and powerful attacks.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Ursaluna possesses an absurd level of wallbreaking power between Guts, STAB Facade, and a massive 140 base Attack. Facade coupled with a Ground-type STAB move and Fire Punch as coverage allows Ursaluna to break most defensive cores featuring Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Gliscor, Rotom-W, and Toxapex. Headlong Rush is preferred for immediate power, capable of guaranteeing an OHKO on Garganacl to prevent it from afflicting Ursaluna with Salt Cure. Earthquake is an alternative, as not dropping defenses allow Ursaluna to stay in and trade more efficiently with faster threats such as Tapu Lele and Ogerpon-W, which suits teams that have means to heal Ursaluna via Wish from Alomomola or Lunar Dance from Cresselia. Fire Punch is the optimal coverage move to hit Steel-types that are neutral or immune to Ground-type moves, such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory. Tera Normal cranks up Ursaluna's wallbreaking power to the maximum, now able to OHKO nearly anything at +2; even the bulkiest resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory are KOed once slightly chipped. 164 Speed EVs are used to outrun uninvested Skarmory, but 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD with 0 Speed IVs accompanied by a Brave nature should be used on Trick Room teams. On that note, Ursaluna pairs well with Trick Room setters like Cresselia and Hatterene, as they can alleviate its low Speed as well as potentially provide Lunar Dance and Healing Wish. Unfortunately, outside of Trick Room, Ursaluna is held back by its poor Speed and defensive typing, which, despite its respectable defenses, leaves it unable to switch into many moves and vulnerable to faster offensive foes like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, especially after it has taken chip damage. It is also prone to having its Flame Orb removed via Knock Off before it can activate, dampening its power significantly. Thus, teammates that can bring Ursaluna in safely, like Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Alomomola, to keep it as healthy as possible are greatly appreciated. Alomomola also has the added benefit of passing Wishes to Ursaluna. In addition, entry hazard setters like Landorus-T and Heatran are good allies, as hazards can further pressure the switches forced by Ursaluna.</p>"

        "Calm Mind (Normal)": {
          "description": "<p>Ursaluna-B is one of the best setup Pokemon on Normal teams thanks to its high damage output and its great physical bulk complemented by recovery in Moonlight. Calm Mind allows Ursaluna-B to boost its power while improving its middling special bulk, allowing it to take on Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra one-on-one and beat Corviknight variants without Iron Defense or Bulk Up. Blood Moon is Ursaluna-B's strongest attack and is able to cleanly OHKO most offensive threats such as Dragapult and Ogerpon-H after a Calm Mind boost. Hyper Voice is the alternative over Blood Moon to provide Ursaluna-B with a more spammable STAB option, letting it beat foes that use Protect like Gliscor more easily. Earth Power lets Ursaluna-B attack on the turn after it uses Blood Moon, threatening defensive options like Clodsire and Toxapex, and can also OHKO Okidogi after a Calm Mind boost. Vacuum Wave is also an option that can notably threaten Chien-Pao and Kingambit. Furthermore, Vacuum Wave gives Ursaluna-B a priority option to circumvent its low Speed to defeat weakened foes like Meowscarada and Greninja. 68 Speed EVs allows Ursaluna-B to outspeed uninvested base 60 Pokemon such as Hisuian Goodra and Galarian Weezing, with the remaining EVs going into HP and Defense to maximize Ursaluna-B's physical bulk. A Bold nature lets Ursaluna-B survive super effective attacks from Pokemon such as Adamant Sneasler and Choice Band Zamazenta's Close Combat and Choice Band Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash from full HP. Alternatively, a Modest nature allows Ursaluna-B to deal more damage at the cost of not surviving the aforementioned attacks. Leftovers is Ursaluna-B's preferred item to keep it healthy throughout the game and works well with Moonlight.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark is one of Ursaluna-B's best offensive teammates for its ability to check opposing Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Iron Hands with its Fighting immunity and access to utility options in Will-O-Wisp. In return, Ursaluna-B can break down specially defensive Pokemon that can handle Hisuian Zoroark such as Clodsire, Gliscor, and Hisuian Goodra. Staraptor is also a good partner for Ursaluna-B thanks to its ability to threaten opposing Grass-types like Ogerpon-H and Rillaboom with a Choice Scarf. Braviary is a bulkier partner that uses its Fighting neutrality to switch into opposing Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Quaquaval. Braviary also offers entry hazard removal with Defog to assist in Ursaluna-B's longevity and a slow U-turn to get it in safely. Cyclizar can also provide hazard removal with Rapid Spin, getting rid of Toxic Spikes, which hinder Ursaluna-B's ability to clean late-game. Furthermore, Cyclizar can use Shed Tail on passive Pokemon like Quagsire to bring in Ursaluna-B safely, allowing it to use Calm Mind freely once. Snorlax's physical wallbreaking ability is also appreciated to chip down specially defensive Pokemon like Articuno. Thick Fat also gives it a pseudo-Ice resistance in order to check Pokemon like Frosmoth, which Ursaluna-B struggles against, and it also checks other threatening special attackers like Greninja and Flutter Mane. Choice Scarf Ditto is able to copy setup sweepers that attempt to force out Ursaluna-B like Swords Dance Ogerpon-W and Chien-Pao and can threaten a reverse sweep. Blissey is a defensive partner that checks most special attackers that threaten Ursaluna-B such as Choice Specs Greninja and Galarian Moltres. Blissey also provides hazard support in Stealth Rock, which gives Ursaluna-B an easier time wallbreaking and winning one-on-one against Ogerpon-H by guaranteeing the OHKO with Blood Moon, as well as cripple incoming switch-ins with Thunder Wave. Indeedee provides support to Ursaluna-B with Healing Wish to improve its longevity if it has been badly poisoned or chipped to low HP. Indeedee's Psychic STAB also threatens opposing Fighting-types like Iron Valiant, Zamazenta and Iron Hands. Arboliva can switch into Water-type moves from foes such as Ogerpon-W, Dondozo, and Barraskewda while setting Grassy Terrain to improve Ursaluna-B's longevity.</p>"

        "Wallbreaker (Ground)": {
          "description": "<p>Boasting a great Special Attack stat, substantial physical bulk, and access to recovery, Ursaluna-B is a premier wallbreaker on Ground teams, offering major support in the Dark, Ghost, and Dragon matchups. Blood Moon paired with Mind's Eye allows Ursaluna-B to OHKO Ghost-type threats like Brambleghast, Dragapult, and Spectrier while also doing considerable damage to walls such as Rotom-W, Gliscor, and Gastrodon. Earth Power nails Steel-types such as Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, and Empoleon, forming a nearly unresisted combination of coverage with Blood Moon. Vacuum Wave prevents Ursaluna-B from being revenge killed by faster Ice-type threats, OHKOing Alolan Sandslash and having a chance to OHKO Chien-Pao. Wise Glasses may be used instead of Heavy-Duty Boots to secure an OHKO on Chien-Pao as well as make it easier to clean up weakened Meowscarada, Greninja, and Darkrai. However, Ursaluna-B is often pivoted in due to its bulk, putting it at risk for chip damage if not running Heavy-Duty Boots. The given EV spread allows Ursaluna-B to outpace uninvested Hisuian Goodra, Clefable, and Empoleon while maximizing power and bulk.</p> <p>Gliscor is an excellent teammate due to its resistance to Fighting, switching into Great Tusk, Infernape, and Sneasler for Ursaluna-B. Furthermore, Ursaluna-B recieves a plethora of utility support from Gliscor via Toxic, Spikes, and pivoting with U-turn, enhancing Ursaluna-B as a wallbreaker. In return, Ursaluna-B picks off Chien-Pao and swaps into Ghost-type moves from Hisuian Zoroark, Skeledirge, and Spectrier. Furthermore, Ursaluna-B can sponge Ice Spinner from Great Tusk and Iron Treads using Gliscor's Protect to scout them. Iron Treads is appreciated due to its entry hazard removing ability and Steel typing, warding off Ice- and Fairy-types, such as Alolan Ninetales, Flutter Mane, and Frosmoth, as well as switching into Toxic. In return, Ursaluna-B breaks past Ground-types like Gliscor, defensive Great Tusk, and Quagsire. Clodsire and Gastrodon offer an immunity to Water-type attacks from Barraskewda, Greninja, and Walking Wake while also setting up a mix of entry hazards to wear down teams for Ursaluna-B. Additionally, Clodsire is a very bulky specially defensive wall, capable of fighting off Grass- and Fairy-types such as Meowscarada, Iron Valiant, Sinistcha, and Alolan Ninetales, while Ursaluna-B threatens Sableye and Hatterene for Clodsire. Choice Scarf Great Tusk outpaces and removes threats like Baxcalibur, Mamoswine, and Ogerpon-W. Great Tusk, in return, appreciates the removal or weakening of Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Gliscor. Choice Scarf Landorus provides a Fighting-type resistance and an adequate Speed tier threatening Great Tusk and Zamazenta while also removing Dragon Dance Baxcalibur lacking Ice Shard. Mamoswine is heavily valued due to its ability Thick Fat, allowing it to combat Alolan Ninetales, Articuno, and non-Choice Band Chien-Pao as well as Grass-types like Meowscarada and Hisuian Lilligant using Ice Shard. In return, Ursaluna-B threatens Rotom-W and Skeledirge. Garchomp is a valued wallbreaker due to its ability to take out Kommo-o, Ogerpon-W, and Baxcalibur lacking Ice Shard while appreciating Ursaluna-B removing physically defensive walls. Quagsire provides chip damage buildup with Stealth Rock and Toxic as well as checks threats such as Chien-Pao, Zamazenta, and Azumarill. Sandy Shocks is a great asset in the Water and Flying matchups, threatening Urshifu-R, Corviknight, Basculegion-F, and Pelipper as well as stacking entry hazards for Ursaluna-B's wallbreaking.</p>"

Choice Band is the preferred item for more power so long as it has pivots to fall back on, such as Pelipper, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos. Tera Water is the premier Tera option to pump as much power into Wave Crash as possible, allowing it to 2HKO even Water-resistant foes such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn. Tera Water also removes its weakness to Sucker Punch from the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Mega Mawile, and it maintains its resistance to Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, although it removes its immunity to Fake Out from Mega Medicham. This also leaves Basculegion susceptible to Wave Crash's heavy recoil damage, so Liquidation is used to mitigate this, and it should be used once Basculegion’s checks have been worn down in order to ensure that it does not KO itself with recoil. Basculegion thus benefits from an offensive partner like Mega Swampert, which can finish off threats weakened by Basculegion. Pelipper is necessary to set up rain for Basculegion and also serves as a pivot to give it a free switch, something Basculegion has trouble doing, as it prefers to preserve its HP for recoil.

Its access to Swift Swim as well as strong STAB options in Surf and Shadow Ball allows it to be immensely threatening once it's brought in, and its ability to hit hard on the special side allows it to pick up 2HKOs on many common Water resistances in the tier such as Rotom-W or Toxapex. Swift Swim is a fantastic ability for Basculegion-F, as it allows the capability to run a Modest nature over Timid, boosting Basculegion-F's breaking capabilities even further. A Speed-boosting nature is unnecessary due to hitting a whopping 510 Speed in rain, outrunning almost every Pokemon in the tier except for Choice Scarf Kartana and Iron Valiant in Electric Terrain. Surf is a great option as a reliable STAB move, because its above-average Base Power and perfect accuracy allow it to be spammed with little to no drawback, while Hydro Pump is a great option for the raw power, 2HKOing Tera Grass Heatran with minimal chip damage and OHKOing Mega Charizard Y in sun. Both of these moves are perfectly complemented by Basculegion-F's secondary STAB option, Shadow Ball, which provides neutral coverage against a majority of the metagame. Very few Pokemon can resist Basculegion-F's STAB combination, which is even further bolstered by Ice Beam as a coverage option. Ice Beam allows Basculegion-F to deal serious damage to Pokemon like Tera Grass Heatran and Dragonite. Basculegion-F is also a phenomenal Terastallization user, as it's able to use Tera Water to both shed its weakness to Kingambit's Sucker Punch and boost Surf to terrifying levels of power, making it capable of sweeping most teams with little to no chip damage. Basculegion-F pairs extremely well with Pelipper, since it's able to set rain and use U-turn to bring Basculegion-F in safely. It also appreciates support from the likes of Ferrothorn and Zapdos, as Ferrothorn can answer Iron Valiant's Moonblast and spread chip damage very effectively with Iron Barbs, and Zapdos can check Choice Scarf Kartana and Rillaboom defensively and threaten crippling paralyses. In turn, Basculegion-F supports them back by KOing Pokemon that'd normally be able to force them out or pivot around utilizing resistances and immunities. For example, it can bait Leaf Blade from Kartana to guarantee a safe switch into Zapdos or it can lure Grassy Glide from Rillaboom, allowing Ferrothorn to come in and start spreading chip damage.</p>"

A Jolly nature allows Sneasler to outspeed targets like the Ogerpon formes prior to its Air Balloon popping, as well as Adamant Barraskewda in rain. Taunt can be used to stop bulkier threats, like Toxapex and Galarian Weezing, that attempt to handle Sneasler, denying their use of recovery and status moves.</p> </section>",

        "Choice Scarf (Poison)": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Sneasler is one of the best cleaners for Poison teams thanks to its powerful STAB moves, like Dire Claw and Close Combat, along with U-turn, which allows Poison teams to preserve momentum while threatening poison with Poison Touch. Choice Scarf allows Sneasler to outspeed Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Regieleki, and opposing Choice Scarf threats like Hisuian Samurott, Enamorus, Iron Treads, Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon and Cinderace. Dire Claw paired with Sneasler's ability Poison Touch gives it a 41.67% chance to inflict poison upon foes, which helps to gradually wear down walls like Ting-Lu and Quagsire, along with a 23.33% chance to inflict paralysis or sleep, disrupting the threat that opposing sweepers pose to the team. While Steel-types are immune to Sneasler's Dire Claw, it can still threaten some of them such as Heatran and Iron Treads with Close Combat. Paired with Switcheroo, it is able to deny opposing walls like Toxapex and Corviknight recovery by passing them the Choice Scarf and forcing them to lock into one move. With the threat of Switcheroo, it also reduces the threat of Pokemon like Dragon Dance Dragonite.</p> <p>Sneasler pairs well with Amoonguss, which threatens to use Spore against foes and threatens walls like Quagsire and Gastrodon with Giga Drain, along with offensive Pokemon like Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Although Amoonguss can act as a switch-in to Landorus-T, it gets completely countered by its Substitute + Bulk Up set. In addition to that, Amoonguss can use Foul Play to dissuade Ghost-type wallbreakers like Dragapult and Mimikyu from setting up with Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, respectively. Galarian Slowking also synergizes incredibly well with Sneasler, as they form a pivoting core with U-turn and Chilly Reception. Galarian Slowking appreciates Sneasler breaking through Steel-types and spreading status, and Galarian Slowking can support Sneasler by threatening opposing Poison-types with Future Sight, switching in on Gholdengo and threatening it with Flamethrower, and tanking one Earth Power from Landorus and OHKOing it with Ice Beam if Galarian Slowking is running Assault Vest. Toxapex can set up Toxic Spikes for Sneasler to clean easily while the opposing team takes residual damage. It also forms a Regenerator core with Amoonguss and Galarian Slowking and aids Alolan Muk against setup with Haze, thus synergizing well with the momentum provided by Sneasler's U-turn. Alolan Muk is also a great partner for Sneasler, as it provides an immunity to Psychic-type attacks and boasts great special bulk, which allows it to tank attacks from Choice Specs Dragapult and Spectrier and threaten them with Knock Off. Glimmora can set Stealth Rock to support Sneasler's cleaning capability and spin away entry hazards to prevent Sneasler from being worn down, as well as threatening slow Great Tusk with Energy Ball and being a Ground-immune Pokemon that Sneasler can pivot into with Air Balloon. Iron Moth and Salazzle greatly benefit from Choice Scarf Sneasler beating threats like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao, allowing them to take out foes like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Klefki, which Sneasler can't break. Salazzle and Glimmora also form a Corrosion core, which helps in the Poison mirror matchup, which Sneasler struggles with. Clodsire is a great teammate to absorb attacks from Iron Valiant, Greninja, and Skeledirge.</p>"
        },
        "Boots Pivots (Poison)": {
          "description": "<p>Sneasler fills a very unique role on Poison teams, as it's the best offensive pivot the type has access to thanks to an incredible base 130 Attack and 120 Speed stats. U-turn combined with Heavy-Duty Boots will allow it to stay safe throughout the entire game by switching out against an opposing threat to bring that can deal with it; in addition, U-turn comes with a 30% chance to poison thanks to Poison Touch ,which helps make progress when Toxic Spikes aren't down or against Flying-types. Close Combat is a strong nuke against many of the tier's common Dark- and Steel-types like Hydreigon, Kingambit, and Heatran along with other notable Fighting-weak threats such as Baxcalibur, Ursaluna and Hisuian Arcanine. Dire Claw's incredible chance to inflect status allows it to not only slash through prominent Fairy-types like Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Hatterene but also to make progress in matchups where its traits aren't as valuable like Ghost by inflicting crippling statuses on targets like Hisuian Zoroark and Skeledirge. Fake Out can chip threats down and rack up poison damage or fish for poison before using U-turn to leave, while Taunt takes advantage of Sneasler's incredible speed can stop the dangerous status effects from Salazzle and Amoonguss or recovery moves from Toxapex and Corviknight on Flying teams.</p> <p>Thanks to U-turn, Sneasler can bring in teammates such as specially defensive Alolan Muk or physically defensive Amoonguss to handle would-be answers. In particular, Alolan Muk for with special Psychic- and Ghost-types like Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Basculegion-F with its strong STAB Knock Off. Physically defensive Amoonguss can be bought in on many of the Ground- and Water-types that threaten Sneasler like Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Urshifu-R. Any other physical threat that can threaten Sneasler like Kleavor, Hisuian Arcanine, or Swords Dance Mimikyu can be dealt with by physically bulky Rocky Helmet Toxapex thanks to Infestation trapping and Haze to deal with boosts. Galarian Slowking's incredible special bulk can allow it to sponge hits for Sneasler from powerful special attackers such as Zapdos, Articuno, and Moltres and then safely pivot back into Sneasler with Chilly Reception; it can also use Future Sight combined with Sneasler's incredible Fighting STAB move to deal immense damage to any foe wishing to tank the hits for its team. Air Balloon Glimmora is a valuable ally that can fight off Ground-types like Choice Scarf Iron treads and Sandy Shocks, hit powerful Flying-Type threats like Moltres and Dragonite with Power Gem, remove hazards if Sneasler loses its Heavy-Duty Boots, and put threats that Sneasler detests such as Toxapex, Corviknight and Sableye on a timer with Corrosion Toxic. Salazzle can also spread Toxic against these threats and use Encore to punish setup from Hisuian Goodra and Kingambit. Choice Scarf Gengar helps majorly against Ghost-types that can outspeed Sneasler like Spectrier, Dragapult. and Flutter Mane while Choice Specs with Icy Wind can remove high profile threats like Garchomp and both formes of Landorus, with both Choice sets having powerful coverage in Thunderbolt to shock Flying-Types such as Moltres, Corviknight, and Pelipper.</p>"
        },
        "Unburden (Poison)": {
          "description": "<p>Unburden allows for Sneasler to become one of the fastest threats in the entire metagame, outrunning Choice Scarf users like Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Flutter Mane with ease. Air Balloon is the held item of choice, not only giving Sneasler a solid Ground immunity to threats like Gliscor and Clodsire, but also forcing them to choose between letting Sneasler set up with multiple uses of Swords Dance or popping Air Balloon so they can hit it with their powerful Ground-type STAB moves. Swords Dance's power boost is crucial in picking off physically bulky threats like Amoonguss, Hatterene, and Great Tusk. Close Combat is the STAB move of choice, (ac) hitting hard and breaking threats that attempt to take on Sneasler like Archaludon, Ursaluna-B, and Corviknight. Throat Chop hits Ghost- and Psychic-types attempting to absorb Sneasler's Close Combats, like Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Latias, hard. For Sneasler's last moveslot, Acrobatics can be used to make the most of Unburden with a strong move capable of breaking through threats like Gliscor and Zamazenta, which will attempt to stop Sneasler, (ac) while Dire Claw slices through bulky Fairy-types like Primarina, Hatterene, and Clefable.</p> <p>With Sneasler attempting to wallbreak as much as possible, entry hazards from the likes of Clodsire, Overqwil, and Glimmora can provide much needed chip damage against bulkier foes, like Toxapex and Skarmory, that may otherwise be able to take Sneasler on. Clodsire's Earthquakes can soften up walls like Toxapex and Forretress. Overqwil, with its solid offensive stats and part-Dark typing, can eat through Ghost- and Psychic-type threats, (ac) like Sableye, Ceruledge, and Metagross, that may attempt to stop Sneasler with their powerful priority moves. It can also weaken physical attackers with Intimidate, giving Sneasler an easier time setting up. Glimmora threatens bulky walls like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Skarmory with the threat of Corrosion Toxic, putting them on vital timers and making them unable to check Sneasler late-game. Galarian Weezing's immunity to Ground-type attacks from the likes of Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Mamoswine makes it solid for wearing these threats down, and it's further capable of spreading burns with Will-O-Wisp to weaken physical attackers. Galarian Weezing also removes hazards with Defog to help Sneasler set (as) up with as much health as possible. Amoonguss is able to handle strong threats with priority moves, such as Dragonite and Metagross, with Foul Play, (ac) which gives solid utility in picking these revenge killers off, and it is also able to put an opponent to sleep with Spore, giving Sneasler a free switch in and turns to set up Swords Dance. Pecharunt with Mean Look can trap physical walls like Skarmory, Galarian Weezing, and Toxapex and wear them down, making it a solid partner. Alolan Muk's strong STAB Knock Off can remove Ghost-types like Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Flutter Mane, and Spectrier. Iron Moth's strong Fire-type STAB move can melt bulky Steel-types like Corviknight and Skarmory, which may otherwise attempt to boost their Defense with Iron Defense to stop Sneasler. Iron Moth also takes out Flying-types like Gyarados and Mandibuzz with Discharge, as they otherwise may try to stop Sneasler with their high bulk and Thunder Wave and Foul Play, respectively. Okidogi appreciates Sneasler blowing through teams and can clean up weakened teams that have few threats, such as Kingambit and Hisuian Arcanine, remaining. This also works in reverse, where Okidogi first punches holes through a team and removes threats like Hisuian Zoroark and Porygon2, leaving Sneasler to clean up the rest.</p>"

Terastallization is excellent for patching up both.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying gives Sneasler an immunity to Ground-type attacks, allowing it to set up on foes such as Landorus while also boosting the power of Acrobatics even further. If using terrain support, however, be warned that any benefit besides Seed activation will be lost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost grants Sneasler an immunity to Extreme Speed, notably allowing it to more consistently beat Dragonite. It does make Sneasler weak to Sucker Punch, but this weakness can be counteracted if using Psychic Terrain support.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: When used alongside Tera Blast, Tera Ice allows Sneasler to more reliably beat foes like Landorus-T and Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Psychic Seed</strong>: When running Sneasler with Indeedee-M's Psychic Surge support, Psychic Seed allows for instant Unburden activation.

          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Sneasler is an extremely fast revenge killer that decimates Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Quark Drive-boosted Iron Valiant, and Adamant Sand Rush Excadrill for Fighting teams. Close Combat and Dire Claw have near-perfect synergy, aside from Dire Claw's ability to punish passive answers—like Toxapex and Slowbro—that swap into its STAB moves. U-turn pivots Sneasler out of switch-ins such as Skeledirge, Aegislash, and Gliscor, bringing in Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Mega Gallade. Switcheroo further punishes walls like Corviknight if the extra speed is unneeded. Alternatively, Rock Slide lets it revenge kill Quiver Dance Volcarona, freeing up a moveslot on Iron Hands, while Toxic Spikes greatly pressure Fairy teams wary of Dire Claw. Night Slash can also be the final move for Sneasler, as it notably hits Gholdengo and Aegislash, but pivoting out of these threats is usually the better option. Choice Scarf Sneasler is a late-game cleaner, so wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as the aforementioned Kommo-o and Mega Gallade are appreciated, as these deal with Corviknight, Gliscor, and Toxapex. Kommo-o also benefits from Sneasler dealing with Fairy-types, as this allows Kommo-o to use Clangorous Soulblaze. Choice Specs Iron Valiant loves being pivoted in safely against physical walls like Skeledirge and Mega Sableye, which wall Sneasler. Assault Vest Iron Hands is a soft check against Gholdengo and Volcarona and can pivot Sneasler in against walls, which it can inconvenience. Hisuian Lilligant and Breloom deal with Gastrodon and Quagsire and also ease the Water and Ground matchups. As with the other setup sweepers, these also love the setup opportunities Sneasler opens up by being able to punish walls with Dire Claw's additional effects or with Switcheroo. Entry hazard support from Cobalion and Great Tusk is also appreciated, and these provide a secondary answer to Mimikyu and Zeraora, respectively. These teammates also appreciate Sneasler's ability to remove Toxic Spikes, greatly easing the matchup against Water and Poison teams.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "sets": {
        "Choice Scarf": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Enamorus can be a sweeper, a form of speed control that allows it to function as an effective revenge killer, and a support Pokemon that gives a teammate a second chance at sweeping via Healing Wish. Choice Scarf is used to outspeed faster common threats such as Zamazenta, Dragapult, and Attack Booster Energy Roaring Moon. Earth Power is mandatory coverage for hitting Fairy resistant foes: Steel-types like non-Air Balloon Gholdengo and Iron Treads, Fire-types like Heatran and Skeledirge, and Poison-types like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire. Tera Stellar Tera Blast gives Enamorus a way to boost its Special Attack thanks to Contrary while simultaneously sniping opposing Terastallized Pokemon like Volcarona and Kingambit. Tera Stellar hits everything in the tier neutrally, so it's able to snowball and clean weakened teams effectively. Mystical Fire is a good alternative, letting it hit Steel-types immune to Earth Power, such as Skarmory, Corviknight, and Air Balloon Gholdengo while also making Enamorus not as Tera-reliant. Healing Wish sacrifices Enamorus in order to fully heal a chipped sweeper like Kyurem or Raging Bolt so it can continue a sweep it couldn't finish previously, and should be used when Enamorus's speed is no longer needed to win the game. Tera Ground can be used instead of Tera Stellar to power up Earth Power and to flip Enamorus's poor matchups against Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb. Tera Fairy can also be used to further boost Moonblast's power, guaranteeing an OHKO on Kyurem and 2HKOs against Ting-Lu and neutral targets like specially defensive Gliscor.</p> <p>Enamorus is best used as speed control on offensive teams that appreciate it giving teammates a potential second chance to sweep. Hazard removers like Court Change Cinderace and Great Tusk are excellent teammates, since Stealth Rock limits the amount of times Enamorus can come in and revenge kill. Cinderace can give hazards to the foe if they aren't on both sides of the field, its access to U-turn helps get Enamorus in safely, and its Pyro Balls force Gholdengo off the field so Enamorus can use Moonblast more freely. Great Tusk is a great teammate, because it threatens common Enamorus switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Toxapex, and checks Kingambit, which can take a hit from Enamorus and retaliate back. Galarian Slowking is a pivot that greatly appreciates Enamorus's presence since it can deal with the Dark- and Ground-types that annoy it such as Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Darkrai. Enamorus appreciates Galarian Slowking's presence too, as its access to Future Sight is extremely useful for muscling through Poison-types like Toxapex and opposing Galarian Slowking and for bulky neutral targets like Gliscor. Galarian Slowking's access to status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave allows it to incapacitate Pokemon that may give Enamorus a hard time like Iron Valiant, Walking Wake, and Iron Boulder. Chilly Reception is used to bring Enamorus onto the field safely, but also has the added benefit of changing the weather, giving rain Pokemon like Barraskewda, Raging Bolt, and Iron Treads a harder time. Another pivot Enamorus loves pairing with is Landorus-T, since it can bring Enamorus in safely with U-turn, threaten all the Poison- and Steel- types Enamorus struggles with, and can set Stealth Rock. Bulky physical setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Gouging Fire work well with Enamorus since they're able to deal with special walls that can prevent it from making progress, mainly Galarian Slowking, and change the tide of a battle if they're able to get a second chance at sweeping thanks to Healing Wish. They also have a good matchup against Volcarona, a setup sweeper Enamorus often can't break through. Physical Dark-types like Kingambit and Roaring Moon are more Pokemon who enjoy Enamorus's presence, since it can take on one of their best checks in Zamazenta, and Healing Wish can allow them to achieve a late-game sweep in case they had to come in earlier and sustain lots of damage. They're also able to blow past common Enamorus checks such as Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Clodsire. Hazard setters like Glimmora and Hisuian Samurott can help chip foes into range for Enamorus to break through their team, and Gholdengo is appreciated to block removal attempts and keep the hazards up for the duration of the game. Kyurem also synergizes with Enamorus pretty well, because it pressures Poison- and Steel-types Enamorus has bad matchups against, so Enamorus can pick them off late-game after they've been weakened.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Enamorus is a potent sweeper, capable of beating common defensive staples in Skarmory, Mega Sableye, and Clefable. Its expansive coverage in Earth Power and Mystical Fire allows it to hit every Steel-type in the tier, such as Celesteela, Skarmory, and Scizor, for super effective damage, securing either an OHKO or a 2HKO on them with a Calm Mind boost. It also allows Enamorus to work around other Fairy-resistant foes such as Skeledirge and Iron Moth as well as offensive checks in Hisuian Arcanine and Victini, while its Speed tier allows it to outspeed and OHKO Nihilego. Taunt is an option to potentially beat and deny recovery from status users like Clefable, Hippowdon, and Chansey that try to slow down or stall Enamorus. Similarly, Iron Moth enjoys many of its checks being removed, particularly Mega Tyranitar and Latias. However, Enamorus's frailty and lack of immediate power makes it difficult for it to break past checks such as Mega Venusaur and Celesteela, which threaten to OHKO it with Sludge Bomb and Heavy Slam, respectively, and aren't OHKOed after a Calm Mind boost. Similarly, Chansey can use Toxic and Seismic Toss to take advantage of Enamorus's lack of longevity. This means it appreciates partners such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, which are capable of Pursuit trapping special walls like Chansey, as well as Victini, which can break past Celesteela as well as provide pivoting to bring Enamorus in safely. Its Speed tier also means it is pressured by faster threats such as Iron Moth and Latios. This means it enjoys speed control from partners such as Alakazam and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, which are able to outspeed its offensive checks. To compensate for its relative frailty, it also enjoys slow pivots to bring it in safely, such as Slowbro, Slowking, and Scizor, and in return it provides an offensive check to the Dark-types they are threatened by, such as Mega Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Hydreigon.</p>"

        "Choice Specs": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Specs allows Enamorus to be more immediately fearsome against bulky teams, now threatening 2HKOs on most Fairy-resistant foes without the need for a turn of setup. In addition to Earth Power and Mystical Fire, Superpower allows it to threaten a 3HKO on Chansey. This also allows Enamorus to potentially snowball through weakened teams once faster foes like Alakazam have been removed. Alternatively, Psychic hits Poison-types that aren't weak to Earth Power, such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. In addition to Pursuit trappers like Mega Tyranitar, speed control from the likes of Choice Scarf Victini, and slow pivots like Slowbro, Choice Specs Enamorus functions as an excellent partner to special sweepers such as Iron Moth, Keldeo, and Blacephalon due to its ability to remove checks to it without competing for the same team slot. These options can also be used to remove Steel- and Poison-types to allow Enamorus to use its powerful Moonblast more freely. As Enamorus is weak to Stealth Rock, it appreciates being partnered with strong entry hazard removal options, such as Rapid Spin Excadrill, Defog Salamence, Defog Tapu Fini, and Rotom-W, which allow it to more easily work around opposing entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and suicide leads like Excadrill. Due to its Choice Specs, however, Enamorus becomes prediction-reliant against teams that stack multiple Fairy-resistant foes, so Stealth Rock and Knock Off support from Clefable, Tyranitar, and Scizor allows it to more effectively break down its checks over the course of a game.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Scarf": {
          "description": "<p>With Choice Scarf, its high Special Attack, and the utility of Healing Wish, Enamorus is an effective form of speed control that can also sweep or facilitate another partner's sweep late-game. Earth Power targets Steel-types like Excadrill and Aegislash, Fire-types like Victini and Iron Moth, and it's also Enamorus's strongest attack against Mega Venusaur. Mystical Fire hits specific Steel-types that don't mind Earth Power, namely Skarmory, Scizor, and Celesteela; its Special Attack-lowering effect also provides some utility against Autotomize variants of the latter. Alternatively, Grass Knot can 2HKO Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Finally, Focus Blast serves as a middle ground option against Steel-types like Excadrill and Skarmory while also OHKOing the Tyranitar formes, though its shaky accuracy combined with Enamorus's frailty makes it risky to use. Enamorus best fits on offense teams looking for a form of speed control that can revenge kill fast threats such as Latios. Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, entry hazard removers such as Excadrill and Tapu Fini are essential teammates. Due to Enamorus's low bulk, pivots such as Thundurus can help it safely get onto the field. Enamorus also appreciates the defensive backbone provided by bulky partners such as Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Skamory; Pokemon that resist Steel like the latter are important as checks to Scizor and Sand Rush Excadrill. Enamorus lacks the power to OHKO certain foes like Victini and Thundurus-T from full health, while they can often cripple or OHKO it back, making hazard setters like Excadrill and Mew good partners as they can chip these foes into KO range. Enamorus struggles to get past certain Poison-types like Mega Venusaur, making checks to them like Choice Specs Latios useful. Enamorus also has no way of getting past Blissey and Chansey, making physical wallbreakers such as Buzzwole necessary teammates. Healing Wish is best used to either give a sweeper like Dragon Dance Tyranitar or Celesteela a second opportunity to sweep, or a bulky wallbreaker like Iron Hands or Scizor the health needed to continue breaking holes into the opposing team.</p>"

Earth Power and Mystical Fire complement its STAB Moonblast well, with the former hitting Toxapex, Clodsire, Gholdengo, and Heatran, while the latter OHKOes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Focus Blast grants Enamorus its strongest attack to hit Garganacl and Mega Tyranitar, which could otherwise survive Earth Power and Moonblast, respectively, while Psychic provides a safer middle ground option for Toxapex  Clodsire, and Mega Venusaur, which staves off its attacks otherwise. Tera Fairy grants Enamorus a power boost to Moonblast, notably allowing it to secure OHKOs against the likes of Landorus-T and Rotom-W, which would barely survive it otherwise. Enamorus fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its wallbreaking power while being able to support it adequately. Pivots such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T grant Enamorus free switch in opportunities against Great Tusk, opposing Landorus-T, and Rotom-W. The latter two pivots and Great Tusk, also provide entry hazard removal, which aids Enamorus given its Stealth Rock weakness. Enamorus works well with fast cleaners such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Scarf Kartana, as they appreciate Enamorus punching holes into the likes of Gholdengo and Mega Scizor for the latter two to clean up weakened defensive cores.</p>"

It is incredibly difficult to switch into after a boost given its strong Moonblast alongside coverage options in Earth Power and Mystical Fire to hit Fairy-resistant foes such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn, respectively. Alternatively, Enamorus can forgo Mystical Fire for Substitute to take advantage of pivoting attempts as well as sponge attacks from revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Iron Valiant, although it makes it less effective at hitting Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. If using Substitute, Enamorus can opt for Leftovers instead of the standard Heavy-Duty Boots to potentially set up more Substitutes. Tera Ground boosts the power of Earth Power, allowing it to KO most Toxapex and Gholdengo sets after a boost, as well as giving it an immunity to Tapu Koko and Rotom-W's Electric-type attacks. Enamorus fits best on bulky offense and offense teams that appreciate its use as an early- to mid-game wallbreaker while granting it sufficient opportunities to enter the field. Therefore, pivots such as Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T pair well with it, bringing Enamorus in on physical walls it can exploit such as Great Tusk, Buzzwole, and Skarmory. Additionally, Pursuit trappers such as Mega Tyranitar and Weavile eliminate special walls such as Clodsire and Gholdengo that can serve as a roadblock to Enamorus. Fast late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Scarf Kartana appreciate Enamorus, as they capitalize on it weakening or removing Steel-types for them to clean up.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Enamorus functions as an interesting revenge killer, being able to KO a range of setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Mega Gyarados, Baxcalibur, and even a weakened Volcarona courtesy of its great speed tier. Additionally, it can serve as a late-game cleaner once its checks such as Toxapex, Gholdengo, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T have been weakened by its teammates. However, its Stealth Rock weakness and relative frailty mean Enamorus struggles to withstand repeated switches as well as priority moves from the likes of Urshifu-R and Mega Lopunny. Tera Fairy boosts the power of Moonblast, notably allowing it to 2HKO Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock. Aside from coverage to hit Steel-types in Mystical Fire and Earth Power, Healing Wish can bring back a weakened teammate in a pinch, potentially being able to change the tide of a game. Therefore, Enamorus fits best on offense teams that appreciate its utility in Healing Wish while providing a positive matchup against opposing offensive teams. Powerful wallbreakers such as Baxcalibur and Volcarona appreciate Enamorus's Healing Wish, giving them a second lease on life, while Enamorus in turn capitalizes on them weakening the likes of Toxapex and Mega Scizor to clean late-game. Enamorus also greatly enjoys entry hazard removal support from Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, or Great Tusk, as it minimalizes its Stealth Rock weakness so it can switch in more effectively mid-game. Enamorus struggles with special wall such as Clodsire and Gholdengo, so Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk make for good partners that can take advantage of them.</p>"

Moonblast checks foes with Ice-type coverage moves like Pawmot, Chien-Pao, and Greninja, as well as 2HKOing Assault Vest Iron Hands. Superpower hits Steel-types like Kingambit, Hisuian Goodra, and Air Balloon Heatran, allowing Enamorus to snowball Steel teams with Contrary once Gholdengo has been removed. Alternatively, Mystical Fire hits Air Balloon Gholdengo and Corviknight. Earth Power hits Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, further improving the Steel and Poison matchups. Healing Wish gives new life to setup sweepers like Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Galarian Moltres. Iron Head is another option to hit Flutter Mane and opposing Enamorus; however, Enamorus's other coverage options hit more foes and are generally more valuable.</p> <p>Corviknight checks a plethora of foes, including Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao, and Choice Scarf Greninja, as well as providing Defog support to preserve Enamorus's longevity so it can fight off Sucker Punch Kingambit; however, Landorus-T and Landorus offer an Electric-type immunity, checking threats like Regieleki, Sandy Shocks, and Magnezone. Furthermore, Bulk Up Landorus-T is a massive asset in the Poison and Steel matchups, notably setting up on Amoonguss and forcing Heatran out. Dragonite is fearsome in the Water and Flying mirror matchups and heavily appreciates Healing Wish support in return. Moltres is a great check to Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Gholdengo due to its excellent bulk and ability to burn the former two. Articuno's exemplary bulk and neutrality to Ice-type moves is heavily appreciated, allowing it to check Greninja and Basculegion-F with Freeze-Dry to further improve the Water matchup Zapdos spreads paralysis via Static and Discharge as well as aiding in the Water matchup. In return, Enamorus removes Choice Specs Greninja to let Zapdos effectively wall most Water teams. Galarian Moltres is great in the Ghost matchup, taking on Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Spectrier.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Enamorus-T's good natural defenses and access to boosting moves in Calm Mind and Iron Defense allow it to serve as a viable wincon that is difficult to remove once it starts setting up. What Draining Kiss may lack in power, it makes up for with its ability to keep Enamorus-T healthy, which is critical, since this set is focused on longevity over raw damage. Earth Power pairs exceedingly well with it, giving Enamorus-T impressive coverage that is resisted by only a few Pokemon while hitting threats like Gholdengo and Heatran super effectively. Leftovers help keep Enamorus-T healthy while it racks up boosts, but Heavy-Duty Boots keeps it safe from Stealth Rock, which poses to cut away a significant amount of HP once Enamorus-T switches in. Grassy Seed can also be run if Enamorus-T is paired with Rillaboom, as the instant Defense boost can aid it greatly in setting up. Terastallization aids Enamorus-T's ability to set up by mixing up its defensive profile;Tera Steel allows it to deal with Poison- and Steel-types, giving it a chance to take Dire Claw from Sneasler and Iron Head from Kingambit, respectively. It also removes its weakness to Electric, giving it a better matchup against Zapdos. In addition, with Overcoat, Tera Steel makes Enamorus-T a very capable Amoonguss switch-in, letting it use it as setup fodder for a potential sweep. Tera Water maintains the resistance to Steel while also giving it a resistance to Ice, and can turn Enamorus-T into a useful Walking Wake check in a pinch. The EV spread is designed to keep Enamorus-T as bulky as possible while still allowing it to outspeed uninvested Kingambit, Azumarill, and Ursaluna.</p> <p>Enamorus-T fits best on bulky offensive teams that allow it to sweep late-game once its checks have been whittled down or removed. Therefore, offensive wallbreakers like Sneasler and Iron Valiant serve as good teammates for it. The latter in particular is good at wearing down Moltres and Corviknight, two common Pokemon that resist both of Enamorus-T's attacks. Offensive hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott also help by wearing down the opponent's team. If Enamorus-T is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, then hazard removal is a necessity, so Pokemon like Great Tusk and Cinderace are further appreciated.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "sets": {
        "Boots Pivot": {
          "description": "<p>Meowscarada is one of the tier's premier offensive pivots thanks to its stupendous base 123 Speed, a critical benchmark that lets it outspeed scary threats like Cinderace, Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Serperior. Knock Off scares some of the tier's key dangers like Deoxys-Speed, Dragapult, and Gholdengo while simultaneously threatening to cripple other switch-ins like Archaludon, Hatterene, and Volcarona. Flower Trick cuts through bulky threats such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Primarina, even ignoring the former two's potential Defense boosts, while Triple Axel gives Meowscarada a crucial Ice-type STAB move that allows it to nail common Pokemon such as Clodsire, Gliscor, Raging Bolt, and Roaring Moon. U-turn could be used in the last slot for keeping momentum while chipping switch-ins such as Kingambit and Hatterene. Alternatively, Meowscarada can run Low Kick to smack some of the tier's most threatening staples such as Archaludon, Kingambit, and Kyurem. Heavy-Duty Boots is practically a requirement on this set, as Meowscarada will frequently be switching in and out of combat and is otherwise quite weak to hazards. Tera Grass and Dark enhance Flower Trick and Knock Off while Tera Fire grants Meowscarada some crucial resistances to Fairy, Ice, and Steel-type attacks such as those from Enamorus, Gouging Fire, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Tera Electric is an additional option that allows Meowscarada to feast on Zapdos more effectively thanks to a newly gained Static immunity and resistance to both of its STAB moves.</p> <p>Meowscarada fits best on balance teams that need a way to force hazard chip along with Knock Off spam to whittle down or outright threaten Pokemon that otherwise don't mind Knock Off such as Gliscor. Meowscarada's frailty courtesy of its pitiful bulk is sometimes hard to work around and limits its switch in opportunities, especially with common weaknesses courtesy of its exploitable defensive typing and a nasty 4x weakness to U-turn. Furthermore, Meowscarada, while being quite fast, is still outsped by monsters such as Darkrai, Dragapult, Weavile, and Zamazenta, the latter of which happens to be one of Meowscarada's best checks. Weavile's offensive tenacity combined with deadly Speed makes it a potent threat, which is why Rocky Helmet Skarmory is one of Meowscarada's best partner options on balance teams, as it punishes Triple Axel spam and shrugs off Weavile's hits comparatively easily. Meowscarada's role as an offensive pivot helps chip away at opposing cores while also bringing some of their key defensive threats into OHKO range for some frail teammates like Darkrai, Iron Boulder, and Gholdengo. Dragapult is another great partner for Meowscarada; it can blank Fighting-type attacks and follow up with a fast Will-O-Wisp to neuter Zamazenta as well. Meowscarada's defensive woes can be covered by bulky teammates that don't mind taking coverage moves from faster threats. On the physical side, Gouging Fire and Great Tusk are both excellent partners whose typings complement Meowscarada's. Gouging Fire acts as a great Will-O-Wisp absorber, while Great Tusk's role as a physically bulky offensive spinner with synergistic typing opens up multiple opportunities to clear hazards. On the special side, Clodsire and Galarian Slowking are both impressive partners thanks to their longevity and fantastic defensive profiles, with the former being able to blank setup sweepers like Darkrai and the latter being able to continue Meowscarada's momentum chain by using a slow Chilly Reception to take a hit or scout a switch, allowing Meowscarada to come in safely. Additionally, Galarian Slowking also threatens Pokemon that would commonly switch into Meowscarada like Iron Defense Zamazenta with Future Sight.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Item": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Item Meowscarada distinguishes itself as an amazing wallbreaker and offensive pivot of the tier thanks to its great Attack and Speed stats and fantastic coverage options alongside Protean, capable of dismantling common defensive picks such as Dondozo, Galarian Slowking, and Ting-Lu. Choice Band boosts its wallbreaking prowess to nuclear levels, whereas Choice Scarf makes it a great revenge killer capable of outspeeding foes like +1 Iron Valiant, Deoxys-S, and +1 Roaring Moon. Triple Axel functions as an incredible coverage move, hitting foes like Gliscor, Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Enamorus super effectively. U-turn allows Meowscarada to gain momentum against common switch-ins like Kingambit, Skarmory, and Corviknight. Trick can also be used over Flower Trick to cripple checks like Skarmory and bulky setup sweepers like Hatterene to hamper their effectiveness and giving Meowscarada more flexibility with moves. Tera Dark boosts the power of its Knock Off, notably allowing Choice Scarf Meowscarada to OHKO Galarian Slowking and Choice Band Meowscarada to OHKO offensive Volcarona and Cinderace. Tera Fire makes Meowscarada resistant to Ice, Fairy, and Fire, helping it against foes like Kyurem, Enamorus, Gouging Fire, and Volcarona while also making it immune to Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Dragapult and Volcarona's Flame Body, though it still struggles against Gouging Fire, as losing Protean means it fails to nail the 2HKO. In addition, Choice Scarf Meowscarada no longer OHKOes Gliscor, Roaring Moon, and Rillaboom, while Choice Band variants lose the OHKO on Raging Bolt. Finally, Tera Grass allows Meowscarada's Flower Trick to reach new heights of power, enabling Choice Scarf variants to secure an OHKO on bulky Calm Mind Primarina and Choice Band variants to OHKO maximum HP Great Tusk.</p> <p>Choice Item Meowscarada fits well on bulky offense structures that appreciate its ability to pivot and remove items from opposing Pokemon, especially defensive ones, with Knock Off. Teammates such as Gholdengo and Volcarona appreciate Meowscarada pivoting against switch-ins like Skarmory and Corviknight, giving them opportunities to set up and clean. Other setup sweepers like Iron Defense Zamazenta also appreciate Meowscarada's ability to revenge kill foes like Gholdengo and non-Choice Scarf Enamorus for them to set up and sweep with minimum hindrance. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Skarmory, and Gliscor also appreciate Meowscarada using Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, which makes foes like Volcarona take hazard damage. Special wallbreakers like Kyurem and Enamorus also appreciate Meowscarada threatening special walls like Primarina and Galarian Slowking. Meowscarada struggles against Steel-types like Skarmory, Archaludon, and Kingambit. Thus, teammates that threaten them, such as Dragapult and the aforementioned Gholdengo and Volcarona for Skarmory, and Pokemon like Zamazenta and Great Tusk for Kingambit, are appreciated. Zamazenta itself is also a threat to Meowscarada, so teammates that check it such as the aforementioned Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Enamorus should be acknowledged. Galarian Slowking also deserves a special mention as a teammate, as its Future Sight has excellent synergy with Meowscarada and helps it deal with Zamazenta as well as other Fighting-types like Iron Valiant by making Meowscarada's moves, especially Knock Off, harder to switch into with these Pokemon. In addition, it also forms a strong pivoting core with Meowscarada. Due to the risk of being Choice-locked into the wrong move, Meowscarada is also quite prediction reliant when facing structures with Pokemon like Gliscor and Dondozo. Therefore, Pokemon that pressure such cores, like Raging Bolt and Dragapult, are excellent partners. Meowscarada also doesn't like taking chip damage from hazards, as it repeatedly wants to pivot in and out of the field. Thus, it appreciates hazard control from teammates such as Great Tusk.</p>"

Toxic Spikes, when paired with Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Landorus-T that pressure Toxic Spikes absorbers such as Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, can be hard to deal with and put setup sweepers like Iron Boulder on a timer. Spikes can be used to chip down foes like Ferrothorn and Toxapex after they have had their Heavy-Duty Boots removed. U-turn pivots out Meowscarda from its checks like Toxapex and Ferrothorn and brings in wallbreakers like Urshifu-R and Zamazenta against them. Protective Pads protects Meowscarada from the abilities of Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos and Rocky Helmet Pokemon like on Landorus-T, while Heavy-Duty Boots lets it avoid getting worn down by entry hazards. Tera Grass can help Meowscarada survive moves like Moonblast from Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R, if Protean has changed its type. Entry hazard setters like Garganacl, Landorus-T, and Gliscor appreciate having Meowscarada as a teammate, as it can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Toxapex and Zapdos, making their hazards more potent. Meowscarada's mediocre defenses and weaknesses to Fighting-, Fire-, and Flying-type attacks mean it appreciates defensive teammates like Clefable, Alomomola, and Ferrothorn that resist or are neutral to those attacks. Meowscarada can pair well with other pivots like Landrous-T and Iron Crown, forming a VoltTurn core to help it deal with its checks like Toxapex.

          "description": "<p>Meowscarada is a fantastic revenge killer for any Dark team due to its great Speed, coverage moves, and ability in Protean. Flower Trick makes Meowscarada a great late-game cleaner against Ground and Water teams, or just in general, taking out threats such as Great Tusk, Greninja, and Flutter Mane. Knock Off can target Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon, such as Gholdengo and Espathra, while removing items from walls such as Toxapex's Black Sludge, Klefki's Light Clay, and Skeledirge's Heavy-Duty Boots. Play Rough allows Meowscarada to clean through weakened Dragon teams, and it's a useful move late-game against other Dark teams. Alternatively, Meowscarada can run Toxic Spikes to cripple foes such as Great Tusk. U-turn picks up momentum for its team on forced switches, for example against Greninja. Choice Scarf plus its Speed and Protean allows it to take on threats such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Great Tusk, and Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Greninja and Meowscarada can break through each other's checks: Greninja can beat Toxapex and Corviknight for Meowscarada, while Choice Scarf Meowscarada can revenge kill Flutter Mane for Greninja. Chien-Pao can prevent walls such as Toxapex from healing with Taunt, allowing Meowscarada to better pressure Water teams; it can also pressure Flying- and Dragon-types for Meowscarada, beating threats such as Dragonite. Chien-Pao can also break past walls such as Clodsire and Amoonguss for Meowscarada. Kingambit is an incredible late-game sweeper, picking off faster threats like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane with Sucker Punch, and it beats down Fairy-types such as Hatterene for Meowscarada. In return, Meowscarada can pick off Iron Valiant, allowing Kingambit to better pressure Fairy teams. Ting-Lu sets Stealth Rock and Spikes, allowing Meowscarada to clean more easily late-game. Additionally, it can check slower Pokemon such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clodsire with Taunt alongside Earthquake or Ruination. It can also stomach strong special attacks such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast, OHKOing Flutter Mane in return with Heavy Slam. Sableye can switch into Fighting-type attacks for Meowscarada, such as Great Tusk's Close Combat, and either cripple their users with Prankster Will-O-Wisp or force them to switch with Prankster Encore. Sableye can also prevent Pokemon like Clodsire and Brambleghast from setting entry hazards thanks to Prankster Taunt. Skuntank can ease the Fairy matchup by beating Hatterene one-on-one, which lets Meowscarada set Toxic Spikes safely. It can also trap Klefki with Fire Spin, preventing dual screens from staying on the field for too long. Finally, Hydreigon can take on walls such as Toxapex for Meowscarada with Substitute + Nasty Plot, safely setting up and overpowering them.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Meowscarada finds itself as the best revenge killer to threatening setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Hydreigon, and Armarouge available to Grass teams thanks to its good offensive stats paired with a strong ability in Protean. This is further supported by a great Speed tier, which allows it to serve as a strong cleaner in multiple matchups such as versus Water, Fighting, Dark and Ghost teams with a Choice Scarf. Flower Trick enables Meowscarada to break through Defense boosted Pokemon such as Curse Dondozo, as well as Pokemon behind dual screens such as Flutter Mane. Play Rough provides the Fairy coverage that enables Meowscarada to threaten Fighting, Dragon, and Dark teams. U-turn is used to allow Meowscarada to pivot out against checks to it, such as Toxapex and Skeledirge, to bring in a teammate that can break through it, such as Breloom and Toedscruel, while also maintaining momentum.</p> <p>While Meowscarada is an effective cleaner, it cannot exactly break through certain Pokemon by itself. Choice Band Breloom is a great teammate for Meowscarada, as it can break through Meowscarada's checks such as Toxapex, Kingambit, and Clodsire. Meowscarada is also vulnerable to Pokemon with strong priority and revenge killers faster than it such as Breloom and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane. Defensive walls such as Amoonguss and Wo-Chien can switch into said priority attacks and revenge killing attempts for Meowscarada. Amoonguss in particular also removes Toxic Spikes, which can be useful for Meowscarada and its teammates. Brambleghast and Toedscruel provide entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin, while also setting up hazards of their own in Spikes. Abomasnow gives an important Ice neutrality to Grass teams, which in tandem with the Defense boost provided by Snow allows it to serve as an answer to Ice-type threats such as Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Swords Dance Iron Leaves and Rotom-C provide counterplay to Corviknight that Grass teams otherwise lack, with the former appreciating Meowscarada pivoting out to it when facing Poison-types such as Dragalge and Toxapex, threatening Poison teams in general with its Psychic-type STAB moves and Fighting-type coverage attacks, while the latter forms a pivoting core with Meowscarada.</p>"

Play Rough isn't nearly as good at handling Dragon-types besides Roaring Moon, but it does blast through Urshifu-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jolly versus Adamant</strong>: Jolly is usually preferred for outspeeding fast threats like Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant, but Adamant 's extra power can be justified on Choice Scarf since it still outspeeds Choice Scarf Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protean versus Overgrow</strong>: Protean’s type-shifting allows Meowscarada to make the most of its colorful movepool, particularly on Choice-locked sets, where the limitation to only changing types once is effectively nullified. f you intend to make use of a Tera type other than Grass or Stellar, Overgrow is worth considering, as it allows Meowscarada more flexibility with its moves by not changing type and removing STAB from Flower Trick or Knock Off.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Low Kick versus Brick Break</strong>: Low Kick OHKOs Chien-Pao, Roaring Moon, if using Protean, as well as Tera Normal Ursaluna-B if using Choice Band, but Brick Break deals far more damage against Chi-Yu.

Dual screens teams in particular are especially vulnerable to the sheer power of Choice Band-boosted Tera Grass Flower Trick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosted Knock Off isn't as reliable at sweeping as Flower Trick, but it can surprise bulky Steel-types such as Scizor and Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar's one-time boost per attack can give Meowscarada more flexible cleaning options. If Meowscarada Terastallizes after using Protean, the type it currently is will get the double base power boost, which can lead to unexpectedly powerful coverage moves!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives Meowscarada a Will-O-Wisp immunity and an Ice resistance that can surprise Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>76 HP / 244 Atk / 108 Def / 4 SpD / 76 Speed with Jolly</strong>: This spread allows Meowscarada to outspeed timid Chi-Yu while avoiding an OHKO from Breloom's Mach Punch, Chien-Pao's Ice Shard and Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Trick And Neutral Natures</strong>: Trick can help Choice-locked sets incapacitate an annoying wall, such as Dondozo or Wo-Chien, by locking them into a single move.

With Choice Band, Low Kick OHKOes Zamazenta-C on the switch and forces out Hiusian Goodra, Play Rough threatens to OHKO Kommo-o while chipping Sap Sipper Great Tusk, and Lash Out punishes chipped Intimidate Corviknight switching in. Choice Scarf is an option over Choice Band that trades the ability to OHKO defensive Kommo-o and 2HKO Scream Tail and Sap Sipper Great Tusk for being an exceptional Speed control option and having the ability to revenge kill slower Choice Scarf users like Azelf and Roaring Moon, as well as unboosted, naturally faster targets like Barraskewda and Hisuian Electrode. Meowscarada's ability to force out special walls like Hisuian Goodra, RegenVest Manaphy, and Roaring Moon is greatly appreciated by special wallbreakers and pivots like Walking Wake, Iron Moth, and Choice Specs Azelf, which in return force out the physical walls that wall Meowscarada like Corviknight and defensive Zapdos.

Ting-Lu and Tyranitar provide entry hazard support for Meowscarada—ensuring it is able to net more KO's—and are great defensive pivots for it to fall back upon.

Flower Trick is Meowscarada's best STAB option and is capable of dealing with weakened Pokemon like Clodsire and Spectrier. Flower Trick's guaranteed critical hit is also very useful in the Fairy matchup and lets Meowscarada revenge kill Azumarill and a weakened Tapu Lele behind Reflect. U-turn allows Meowscarada to maintain an advantage against its defensive checks like Corviknight by being able to pivot into its teammates like Scovillain. Knock Off is a tool to cripple Meowscarada's defensive switch-ins like Toxapex and Klefki in addition to the aforementioned Corviknight. Play Rough is a strong coverage option to threaten opposing Dragon-type Pokemon like Kommo-o, Kyurem, and Latios, which Grass teams tend to struggle against. Low Kick is a less frequent option but lets Meowscarada OHKO Bisharp while threatening Heatran with a 2HKO; however, Play Rough is preferred to have an easier time against Dragon teams. Meowscarada has an easier time revenge killing foes with entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Cradily. Ferrothorn appreciates Meowscarada's ability to check Fighting-types like Mega Gallade, Iron Valiant and Galarian Zapdos with STAB Play Rough. Hisuian Lilligant is also a fantastic offensive partner for Meowscarada. It is able to check the Flying-types that switch into Meowscarada like Celesteela and Landorus-T while also assisting in the Dragon matchup, outspeeding common Pokemon like Garchomp and Dragonite. Hisuian Lilligant also makes the Steel matchup easier for Grass; its ability to threaten Heatran is appreciated by Meowscarada, while Meowscarada can threaten Gholdengo with Knock Off, which Lilligant cannot beat. Mega Venusaur is also a mandatory defensive partner for Meowscarada; its Bug neutrality and bulk allows it to act as a consistent check to Mega Scizor, which easily switches into any move of Meowscarada, and Venusaur is able to check it with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Venusaur also checks opposing Fairy-types for Meowscarada like Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Iron Valiant, while Meowscarada is able to threaten the Psychic-types that force out Mega Venusaur such as Latios, Mega Alakazam, and Victini. Whismicott is one of the best hazard removal options on Grass, and Meowscarada appreciates not having Stealth Rock and Spikes chip it down, because it comes in often to threaten a KO. Whimsicott's Fairy typing also allows Meowscarada and its teammates not to be overwhelmed by Dragon-types like Garchomp, and it can encore Calm Mind Mega Latias. Celebi with Nasty Plot and Groundium Z can break defensive Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra while also being able to threaten opposing Poison-types like Alolan Muk and Toxapex.</p>"

Hex pairs very well with Will-O-Wisp, becoming a 130-Base Power STAB move. On the other hand, Earth Power is very useful against Pokemon that use Tera Fire to avoid burns, such as Koraidon, and it also hits Miraidon and Eternatus switch-ins hard.</li> <li>The combination of reliable recovery with Slack Off and Heavy-Duty Boots means that Skeledirge can easily stay healthy throughout the game and not worry about entry hazards.</li> <li>Tera Fairy is useful against Choice Band Koraidon in particular, as it can break through Skeledirge with Dragon Claw or Outrage; the downside is that Tera Fairy makes Skeledirge vulnerable to Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade. Tera Flying gives Skeledirge an immunity to Ground-type moves, which can be helpful against Arceus-Ground and Stomping Tantrum Koraidon. Tera Water provides a good all-around neutral defensive type to use which maintains an Ice-type resistance for Chien-Pao and Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Skeledirge offers a great deal of role compression to teams thanks to its ability to reliably check so many offensive threats.</li> <li>Skeledirge's main flaw is that it can be passive and vulnerable to double switches, U-turn, and Taunt.</li> <li>Koraidon can often take advantage of the predictable switch to Skeledirge to bring in deadly offensive threats such as Chi-Yu, Walking Wake, and Kyogre with U-turn. As a result, it may be advantageous to anticipate U-turn in these scenarios.</li> <li>Taunt is often employed as a method to bypass Skeledirge's Will-O-Wisp, especially by Koraidon and E-Killer Arceus. If you expect the foe to use Taunt, taking advantage of the situation and gaining Special Attack boosts with Torch Song is a great way to limit their ability to wallbreak.</li> <li>Ting-Lu and Clodsire are excellent teammates for Skeledirge, as they cover most of the special attackers that come in on it, especially Miraidon, while Skeledirge can in turn handle most physical threats. Together they form a solid defensive backbone.</li> <li>Skeledirge is unable to take on Ground-type physical attackers like Arceus-Ground, Tera Ground Zacian-C, and Groudon without using Tera itself. As a result, Pokemon that resist or are immune to Ground like Corviknight, Giratina-O, Landorus-T, and Arceus-Grass make for good partners. Corviknight has the additional benefit of solidifying the matchup against E-Killer Arceus.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy is useful as a backup check to Koraidon, and it makes it much more difficult for Koraidon to get easy momentum with U-turn.</li> </ul>"

These traits make it a hard-to-break physical wall and a potential wincon as well. Will-O-Wisp lets it cripple physical attackers such as Mega Tyranitar, Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T while also punishing Water-types such as Rotom-W. Combined with Will-O-Wisp, Hex helps it overwhelm passive checks in Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Clodsire while also allowing Skeledirge to sweep statused teams. While not as strong as Hex, Shadow Ball is a decent option as it's more consistent. Tera Water allows Skeledirge to beat rain teams by spreading burns against rain sweepers such as Mega Swampert, Barraskewda, and Floatzel. On the other hand, Tera Fairy allows it to counter Dragon Dance Dragapult and avoid Pursuit from Kingambit, Mega Tyranitar, and Weavile while also keeping a Fighting resistance, meaning it can still check Zamazenta. It also removes Skeledirge's Ground weakness, allowing it to comfortably burn Pokemon like Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T. Skeledirge struggles against Heatran and Garganacl, as it can't burn them nor deal significant damage to them. Therefore, Pokemon that pressure them like Garchomp and Rotom-W for the former and Cover Cloak Gholdengo for the latter make good partners. Skeledirge also hates losing its item, so Knock Off absorbers like Flyinium Z Tornadus-T and Gliscor make for good teammates. The former can also weaken Heatran for it while Skeledirge can burn Mega Tyranitar. Special sponges like Gastrodon, Clodsire, and Toxapex all appreciate Skeledirge's ability to cripple physical attackers such as Kartana, Mega Lopunny, and Kingambit, alleviating the pressure these Pokemon exert on them.

With Will-O-Wisp and Unaware, it can check physical set-up sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite or Belly Drum Azumarill that threaten Fire. Additionally, Torch Song lets Skeledirge fire back against these threats while raising its Special Attack and reducing passitivity. Hex pairs incredibly well with Will-O-Wisp, as it threatens large amounts of damage on burned foes, while Shadow Ball is a more consistent STAB option that hits opposing Skeledirge for more immediate damage. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Skeledirge avoid entry hazards chipping away at it whenever it switches in.</p> <p>Volcarona is a great teammate for Skeledirge, as it can threaten Dark-types that annoy Skeledirge such as Ting-Lu and Kingambit. In return, Skeledirge can burn physical attackers, like Dragonite, giving Volcarona more setup opportunities. Paldean Tauros-F is also a good teammate, since it can threaten the aforementioned Dark-types with its Fighting STAB while also having Intimidate to help neutralize physical attackers that Skeledirge cannot handle on its own, such as Roaring Moon. Additionally, its Choice Scarf set can outspeed and KO Greninja. Torkoal pairs well with Skeledirge due to its ability to both remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and set them up, all while also powering up Skeledirge's Torch Song. Cinderace is a fairly good partner as well due to High Jump Kick, letting it remove Dark-types aiming to threaten Skeledirge, while also being able to remove entry hazards with Court Change and hit Poison-types such as Clodsire and Toxapex with Zen Headbutt. Scovillain is a good partner, since it can remove Water-types such as Dondozo and Rotom-W with its Grass STAB.

It also hits Chi-Yu switch-ins hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute is a good way around status, especially Garganacl's Salt Cure. It also becomes effective when used on Toxic Spikes teams.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: When paired with Substitute, Skeledirge can seriously punish passive Pokemon, though at a serious cost in coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flame Charge</strong>: Despite Skeledirge's low Speed, stacking Flame Charge boosts can make it difficult to check, though it'll often need multiple boosts to outspeed threats without compromising its bulk.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Skeledirge's defensive typing isn't without its merits, but the wide variety of weaknesses it has often forces Skeledirge to Terastallize to check major threats like Chien-Pao and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Terastallizing into the Fairy typing removes Skeledirges glaring weakness to Dark and provides an overall superior defensive typing. making Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu far more reasonable to deal with. It also provides a neutral typing for the inevitable Shadow Balls that will be thrown at Skeledirge, like from Flutter Mane or Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While Tera Normal isn't fantastic defensively, it lets Skeledirge severely punish attempts from special attacking Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo to check it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: A Water Tera type lets Skeledirge take on opposing Water attacks, providing a valuable turn to burn foes like Azumarill and Palafin-H. It should be noted that Tera Water tends to be a safer option versus the common Gholdengo, as it does not often run Thunderbolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Despite the defensive nature of this set, Tera Fire's increased power for Torch Song is welcome, and it still helps Skeledirge against Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Sitrus Berry</strong>: Residual recovery helps Skeledirge use Torch Song more freely. Leftovers is the best option since Skeledirge has instant recovery, but Sitrus Berry with an even HP stat can be used to restore some health after getting hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak ignores the secondary effects of Salt Cure and Acid Spray, improving Skeledirge's match-up against Garganacl, Iron Moth, and Bellibolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: The immunity to Spore Skeledirge gains lets it check Breloom, Amoonguss, and Brute Bonnet far more effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: This makes Skeledirge less pressured to Terastallize to rid itself of its Stealth Rock weakness.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>220 HP / 76 Def / 212 SpD with Bold</strong>: This EV spread allows both Tera Fairy and Water Skeledirge to avoid a 2HKO from a plethora of offensive threats, such as Focus Sash Chien-Pao, Modest Gholdengo, Adamant Azumarill, and Choice Specs Dragapult, while still boasting significant physical bulk.</li> </ul>"

Skeledirge can then use Torch Song to set up on passive opponents like Scream Tail and non-Well-Baked Body Blissey or Will-O-Wisp to burn an incoming foe, including switch-ins like Hisuian Goodra and Alolan Muk. Hex alongside Will-O-Wisp does more damage, but Shadow Ball can be used for more consistent damage. Skeledirge pairs well with hazard setters such as Garchomp and Iron Treads, as it allows them to keep their hazards on the field, and they can in turn handle opposing Well-Baked Body Pokemon. Due to its middling Special Defense, Skeledirge appreciates specially defensive teammates like Blissey and Hisuian Goodra. Additionally, a teammate that covers the type that Skeledirge chooses not to be immune to, such as Quaquaval for Earth Eater variants and Corviknight for Desolate Land variants, helps form a strong defensive core. Dark-types like Meowscarada and Chien-Pao also OHKO Skeledirge with a bit of chip damage, so Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Slither Wing that can threaten them are appreciated.</p>"

Earth Power is an option that chips Miraidon and Eternatus as well as giving it a super effective hit against Tera Fire Zacian-C and Koraidon.

Tera Flying is a niche option that further improves its matchup against Arceus-Ground while avoiding super effective Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C. Skeledirge is a good fit on balance teams that appreciate it checking common setup threats and carrying teammates that make up for its shortcomings and bad matchups. Skeledirge is very vulnerable to Miraidon, Kyogre, Calyrex-S, and Arceus-Ground, so it appreciates teammates like Ting-Lu, Eternatus, Wo-Chien, and Giratina-O to handle these powerful attackers.

Tera Flying can also be used with Brave Bird to turn Quaxly into a more potent offensive threat.

Rapid Spin is used to clear entry hazards, aiding against entry hazard-stacking teams.

Some teammates that benefit from Quaquaval's presence include Roaring Moon and Deoxys-S, as they don't enjoy taking Spikes damage, so they appreciate its hazard removing capabilities.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Quaquaval is a decent wallbreaker, using its strong STAB moves, and solid Attack stat to burst through bulky opponents foes like Great Tusk, Deoxys-D, and Skarmory. Brave Bird hits Desolate Land users such as Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Ceruledge on the switch-in, but Quaquaval can use Close Combat to help against Pokemon like Heatran and Manaphy, though this does have the drawback of making it easier to be revenge killed. Rapid Spin is used as not only entry hazard removal for Quaquaval and its teammates but also a way to let it outspeed and threaten foes like Hisuian Electrode, Galarian Zapdos, and Iron Boulder. Knock Off can be used to both remove items from Pokemon like Corviknight, Deoxys-D, and Mandibuzz, as well as hit Ghost-types such as Ceruledge and Gholdengo. U-turn is a less prominent option to be able to pivot on checks like Corviknight and Manaphy. Roost is used to keep Quaquaval healthy potentially allowing it to outlast its checks, while Swords Dance can be used as a way to let it end games by blasting through its checks like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and physically defensive Manaphy. Offensive Psychic-types such as Azelf, Iron Boulder, and Deoxys-S appreciate Quaquaval's presence, as it's able to take on Dark- and Steel-types such as Roaring Moon, Chien-Pao, and Gholdengo for them. Quaquaval is slow, and struggles to deal with faster foes such as Deoxys-S, Dragonite, and Latios, so it benefits from having teammates like Swampert, Corviknight, and Mandibuzz to help with checking them defensively and bringing it in safely.</p>"

          "description": "<p>With access to nearly unresisted First Impression and U-turn due to Tinted Lens, Lokix is an amazing revenge killer for Bug teams. Its ability to scare out many common threats such as Espathra, Chien-Pao, and Dragapult is highly valuable. Lokix struggles to break past many physically defensive walls like Quagsire, Dondozo, and Corviknight; however, it can pivot in teammates—such as Vivillon and Volcarona—that can beat them. A Choice Band with an Adamant nature maximizes Lokix's damage output and can utilise Axe Kick to lure and defeat Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Life Orb avoids a Choice lock and makes use of Sucker Punch to pick off threats that First Impression alone cannot such as Gholdengo and Flutter Mane. Throat Chop lets Lokix deal good unresisted STAB damage and prevents Skeledirge from using Torch Song, which is extremely valuable and one of the reasons Lokix is a necessity for Bug teams.</p> <p>Lokix is highly susceptible to entry hazards and is often not quite strong enough to OHKO many Pokemon. Forretress is a great entry hazard remover and entry hazard setter, fixing both of those issues. Forretress also has a good defensive profile, acting as a sponge for absorbing damage, and it can even form a VoltTurn core with Lokix. Scizor removes Fairy-types that threaten Lokix such as Hatterene and Iron Valiant and allows Lokix to clean up after it has done enough damage. Volcarona takes care of Steel-types that don't fall to Axe Kick such as Corviknight and Scizor. Lokix can remove Ghost-types—such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane—to enable Slither Wing and Heracross, letting them spam their powerful Fighting-type moves and clean up after Lokix. Frosmoth can deal with many bulky Ground-types—such as Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu—and Vivillon improves the Fighting-type matchup by beating Great Tusk, Gallade, and Paldean Tauros-W and can answer Dondozo with the combination of Sleep Powder and Energy Ball. Masquerain can set up Sticky Web, which gives Lokix an amazing Speed advantage versus Iron Treads, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake, making Life Orb Lokix immensely threatening.</p>"

        "All-out Attacker (Electric)": {
          "description": "<p>Pawmot is a great wallbreaker on Electric teams, outspeeding foes like Garchomp, Landorus, and Sandy Shocks. Close Combat does not receive the benefits of Pawmot's ability and item, but it helps beat pesky foes like Ursaluna-B, Hisuian Goodra, and Baxcalibur, which are immune to or resist its Electric-type attacks. Close Combat is also a good move to beat foes like Ting-Lu and Kingambit which Pawmot's teammates might struggle against. Thunder Punch is an alternative STAB move, as it hits common walls like Corviknight and Toxapex while also threatening Pelipper on rain teams, thus preventing the opponent from setting up rain for Barraskewda repeatedly. Thunder Punch also helps versus Belly Drum Azumarill, preventing it from setting up. Mach Punch is Pawmot's preferred second STAB move, as it offers strong priority, securing an OHKO on foes like Chien-Pao, Meowscarada, and Greninja after a single layer of Spikes. Mach Punch also nullifies Kingambit's Sucker Punch by outspeeding it with priority. Revival Blessing is another alternative that can be used over Mach Punch, as it offers a unique and valuable type of utility by allowing a teammate to be revived. This may prove to be a huge benefit in some matchups like the Electric mirror, where Pawmot can revive teammates like Sandy Shocks after the opposing Rotom-W is low on HP or has already fainted. Ice Punch hits foes like the Landorus formes, Gliscor, Clodsire, and mixed Amoonguss. The last coverage move is Seed Bomb, as it hits Pokemon like Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Rotom-W, which can prove troublesome for Pawmot's teammates to break. Seed Bomb also compounds with Thunder Punch to hit every Water-type in the game for super effective damage, making Pawmot incredibly powerful in the Water matchup. Punching Glove helps Pawmot avoid chip damage from Rocky Helmet on foes like Rough Skin Garchomp while also avoiding status effects like burn from foes like Flame Body Volcarona, Moltres, and Talonflame.</p> <p>Pawmot greatly benefits from teammates like Regieleki, which can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards for Pawmot and pivot well into other teammates with the help of Volt Switch. Regieleki's extremely high Speed tier also allows it to revenge kill foes like Enamorus, weakened Walking Wake, and, if using Magnet and Wild Charge, Flutter Mane. In return, Regieleki appreciates Pawmot dealing with Ground-type Pokemon, like Quagsire and Gliscor, with the help of Seed Bomb and Ice Punch due to Regieleki's lack of coverage moves. Iron Hands is another great teammate, as it allows Pawmot to run alternative sets, like Thunder Punch over Fighting-type STAB moves, since Iron Hands can run these moves in its stead. Assault Vest Iron Hands also has immense bulk and acts like a sponge for special attacks from foes like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Volcarona, which can cause great problems for Pawmot, since it is relatively frail. Iron Hands can also slow pivot into Pawmot with the help of Volt Switch. In return, Pawmot deals with walls like Quagsire and offensive Rotom-W, which Iron Hands may face difficulty in breaking. Sandy Shocks sets hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes to boost Pawmot's wallbreaking potential by providing necessary chip on foes while also being able to provide a Ground immunity thanks to Air Balloon, thus behaving like a switch-in against foes like opposing Sandy Shocks, Choice Scarf Iron Treads, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge. In exchange, Pawmot helps break foes like the Landorus formes and Gliscor that wall Sandy Shocks completely. Pawmot also threatens foes like Baxcalibur, Dragonite, mixed Amoonguss, and Galarian Slowking, which can cause problems for Sandy Shocks. Rotom-W is an essential teammate for Pawmot, as it provides a much-needed Ground immunity while also offering great utility with its defensive sets that run Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Hydro Pump on Rotom-W deals with pesky Ground-types like Great Tusk and Mamoswine, which Pawmot struggles against. Defensive Rotom-W benefits from Pawmot's ability to take down foes like Water Absorb Clodsire and Gastrodon. Thus, together they form a strong core on Electric-type teams. Teammates like Thundurus, Thundurus-T and Zapdos provide a Ground immunity for Pawmot while also threatening strong Fighting-type foes like Zamazenta and Great Tusk. Zapdos can break these physically bulky Pokemon with the help of Hurricane, while Thundurus-T can use Psychic as a coverage move for Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and physically defensive Amoonguss. In return, they appreciate Pawmot's ability to break specially defensive walls that hinder Zapdos and Thundurus-T's wallbreaking capability. Thundurus provides great support with Prankster Thunder Wave, paralyzing fast foes like Dragapult and Flutter Mane and allowing Pawmot to outspeed them. Magnezone pairs well with Pawmot, as it can act like a sponge for Fairy-type moves from foes like Hatterene, Iron Valiant, and Flutter Mane and force them out with Flash Cannon. In return, Pawmot helps to break special walls like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire, which Magnezone can't break.</p>"

        "Choice Scarf (Electric)": {
          "description": "<p>Pawmot is a great Choice Scarf user on Electric teams by virtue of its coverage and utility, being able to deal with Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane. With Revival Blessing, Pawmot can give second chances to fallen offensive Pokemon such as Iron Hands and Choice Specs Zapdos to punch holes in opposing teams. Double Shock allows Pawmot to OHKO threats such as Flutter Mane and Azumarill as well as finishing off Iron Valiant, but this comes with the downside of Pawmot immediately being forced out after using the move. Ice Punch allows Pawmot to deal decent damage to Ground-types that resist both its STAB moves, notably OHKOing both Landorus formes as well as 2HKOing both Iron Leaves and Clodsire. Volt Switch allows Pawmot to pivot out of a check such as Amoonguss into one of its teammates to deal with it. Play Rough and Seed Bomb are usable alternatives, with Play Rough being able to 2HKO Sableye while still hitting Dragon-types and Seed Bomb dealing with Water/Ground types that most Electric-type Pokemon cannot handle efficiently. Notably, Seed Bomb OHKOes specially defensive Gastrodon and 2HKOes physically defensive Quagsire. Grass Knot can also be used, being able to 2HKO Quagsire as well as Great Tusk.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks provides great hazard support to wear down incoming foes for Pawmot to take advantage of. Ground-immune Pokemon such as Zapdos and Rotom-W are appreciated by Pawmot, being able to switch into an anticipated Ground-type attack from the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Zapdos can also threaten Grass-types such as Amoonguss, while Rotom-W together with Pawmot can overwhelm Quagsire. In return, Pawmot can revive one of them so it can continue checking Ground-types when needed. Regieleki provides hazard removal and a fast pivot for Electric teams, and in return it appreciates Ground-types being lured in and removed by Seed Bomb Pawmot variants. Assault Vest Iron Hands is another great teammate, being able to switch into attacks that could OHKO Pawmot such as Dragapult's Draco Meteor and Enamorus's Moonblast. Iron Hands can also OHKO the latter when running Heavy Slam. In return, Pawmot can run Seed Bomb to handle Water/Ground types Iron Hands cannot efficiently threaten such as Quagsire, and Swords Dance variants of Iron Hands appreciate it removing Flutter Mane and wearing down Sableye. Magnezone is a great partner, being able to threaten the Fairy-types that can threaten Pawmot such as Hatterene and Flutter Mane.</p>"

Well-Baked Body also lets Dachsbun switch into Fire-types like Charizard and Houndoom as well as absorb Will-O-Wisp from Misdreavus and Charizard, all of which threaten other Wish passers like Leafeon. Body Press prevents Steel-types from walling Dachsbun and also gets stronger if Well-Baked Body has already been triggered. Play Rough is good coverage alongside Body Press and hits Misdreavus, but Roar can be used instead to force setup sweepers like Gogoat and Carbink out as well as rack up chip damage if entry hazards are up. Copycat can be used to copy entry hazards from Pokemon like Whiscash as well as beat certain setup sweepers like Iron Defense Carbink one-on-one. Tera Steel lets Dachsbun absorb Steel- and Poison-type attacks and gives it an edge against Pokemon such as Sludge Bomb Houndoom, Articuno, and Indeedee-F. Dachsbun can run 64 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral-natured Honchkrow at the cost of some bulk. Dachsbun can also opt for a physically defensive spread to better take on Pokemon like Lycanroc-N and, after Terastallizing, Zangoose.</p> <p>Dachsbun fits best on balance teams in need of cleric support and a blanket check to various offensive threats. Pokemon like Gabite, Mareanie, and Tinkatuff can check Steel- and Poison-types like Alolan Dugtrio and Skuntank for Dachsbun, and they appreciate Dachsbun coming to their aid against foes such as Articuno and Pyroar. Charizard is another great partner that switches into Steel-types like Perrserker and non-Rock Slide Alolan Dugtrio and can do so repeatedly thanks to the Wishes Dachsbun passes. Setup sweepers like Rotom-F and Gogoat find it easier to boost multiple times in a game with Dachsbun keeping them healthy. Wish support also gives Gogoat an easier time preserving Milk Drink's limited PP, which allows it to play more recklessly early on against threats that Dachsbun baits in, such as Basculin. In return, these setup sweepers make up for Dachsbun's passivity and can threaten out nuisances like Vespiquen and Whiscash. Misdreavus can spread burns to give Dachsbun an easier time against physical attackers like Crabominable and slow opposing walls down with Taunt. Meanwhile, Dachsbun can stand up to Fire-types like non-Tera Steel Charizard, check Dark-types like Alolan Persian and Honchkrow, and reduce Misdreavus's reliance on Pain Split for recovery.</p>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With a superb special stat line, Seed Sower, and good moveset coverage, Arboliva can be a deceptively strong and long-living Assault Vest user!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Seed Sower</strong>: Once activated, Grassy Terrain’s passive recovery and boosting of Grass-type attacks like Giga Drain can help Arboliva survive longer than expected. Grassy Terrain also halving Earthquake’s power is greatly appreciated by bulky teammates like Skeledirge, Arcanine, and Iron Hands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: This move keeps Arboliva from becoming setup bait against foes like offensive Dragonite, and is also your best move into Wo-Chien before Tera.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast is a great option for hitting types that Arboliva lacks natural coverage for. Tera Fire lets Arboliva hit Steel-types like Scizor and Tera Electric punishes Tera Flying users like Gholdengo. Both Tera Fire and Tera Electric cover Corviknight as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Coat</strong>: This set’s massive special bulk can make getting one-shots with Mirror Coat awkward, but it is still a great option, particularly against boosted or super effective hits. Bear in mind though that this won’t work against Chi-Yu as long as it keeps its Dark typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leaf Storm</strong>: Leaf Storm trades consistency for a single turn of high burst damage and can be worth it if investing in Special Attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Arboliva’s raw special stats make it capable of tanking super effective hits without using Tera. Nonetheless, Tera is still a strong tool to extend Arboliva’s uptime and contest matchups that would otherwise capitalize on its mediocre defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire can flip matchups against Focus Sash Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu when healthy. If running Tera Blast, it also gives Arboliva the opportunity to contest Steel-types more effectively. Be aware, though, that this significantly worsens other key matchups, like Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a solid defensive option, especially into Toxic abusers like Toxapex and Clodsire. Notably, it flips several weaknesses, blocks Toxic, and allows for absorbing Toxic Spikes later in the match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric is Gholdengo's worst nightmare. It gives a resistance to Make It Rain, blocks Thunder Wave from defensive sets, and punishes Tera Flying usage that is meant to get around Earth Power. On top of that, Arboliva still hits Corviknight very hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is another great defensive option for neutralizing most of Arboliva's weaknesses, and the extra power behind Dazzling Gleam can make it easier to break defensive Dragonite variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass removes Arboliva’s Fighting weakness while maintaining Spore immunity, letting it check Breloom. If both Tera and Grassy Terrain are active, Modest Giga Drain can even 2HKO Breloom!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: While not as strong defensively, invested Tera Earth Power can OHKO uninvested Chi-Yu and Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 4 Def / 140 SpA / 124 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread balances bulk and power, avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Specs Gholdengo's Make It Rain and almost always surviving Modest Chi-Yu’s Fire Blast before Tera! If running Tera Ground, there are enough Special Attack EV’s to turn Earth Power into an OHKO against uninvested Chi-Yu and Gholdengo. The Speed EV's Speed tie with 4 Speed Gastrodon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 252 SpA / 20 SpD with Modest</strong>: This simple spread still provides plenty of bulk while maximizing Special Attack, working nicely with Leaf Storm and Tera Types that boost Arboliva's coverage moves. If Grassy Terrain is present, fully invested Leaf Storm has a 75% chance of OHKOing 4 Special Defense Garchomp. The bulk investment lets Arboliva always avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire after Grassy Terrain recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 20 SpD / 252 Spe with Modest</strong>: While maximum Speed investment may seem a bit strange, it can be worth it when running Tera Fire Tera Blast to get the jump on Scizor, Corviknight and the rare Timid Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 4 Def / 148 SpA / 20 SpD / 100 Spe with Modest</strong>: This alternative Speed spread gives Arboliva a nice boost in Special Attack while still letting it outrun 4 Speed Azumarill. This is usually more than enough Speed to outrun Ting-Lu as well.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Garganacl eases the Water and Steel matchups thanks to its signature move, Salt Cure. Iron Defense allows Garganacl to set up, tanking super effective physical hits due to its astronomical base 130 Defense, while also boosting the power of Body Press, which helps nail Dark- and Steel-types such as Ting-Lu, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit. Curse is another option that can buff its Attack, boosting the damage of Salt Cure, but it prevents Garganacl from easily stonewalling physical attackers—such as Dragonite and defensive Quaquaval—and also lowers Garganacl's Speed. Salt Cure is a fantastic STAB move, neutering setup sweepers such as Mimikyu, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as it puts them on a timer, which Garganacl can potentially stall out as it sets up or heals via Recover. Purifying Salt is particularly useful, as it allows Garganacl to absorb incoming status moves such as Toxic from Quagsire or Toxapex as well as Will-O-Wisp from Dragapult or Sableye and punish them with Salt Cure. Garganacl is also able to tank Ghost-type STAB moves from the likes of Choice-locked Flutter Mane and Dragapult. Leftovers is the best item to provide passive recovery; however, Heavy-Duty Boots can allow Garganacl to come in without taking entry hazard damage, as entry hazard stacking is extremely common. As an alternative to the given EVs, 52 Defense EVs with an Impish nature let Garganacl potentially overwhelm Choice Band Scizor, Tinkaton, and defensive Quaquaval if used with Iron Defense.</p> <p>Tyranitar is an amazing partner for Garganacl, as it sets sand. Tyranitar can also be used as one of the few special attackers Rock teams have access to to nail physical walls such as Great Tusk with Ice Beam; it is also Rock's best check to Kingambit due to it being able to survive a boosted Sucker Punch and OHKO back with Fire Blast. Choice Scarf Glimmora can take on Grass- and Fighting-types such as Breloom and Iron Valiant that may threaten Garganacl out. Glimmora also has fantastic coverage, being able to take on Steel-types such as Gholdengo with Earth Power and Water-types such as Gastrodon and Quagsire with Energy Ball. Glimmora can also provide Toxic Spikes support thanks to its ability, Toxic Debris, which can help Garganacl further wear down and pressure the opposing Pokemon. Teammates that utilize Air Balloon such as Iron Thorns and Drednaw can switch into powerful Ground-type attacks aimed at Garganacl. Drednaw can also utilize its Water-type STAB move to take out opposing Ground-types such as Iron Treads, Unaware Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Drednaw can also turn the tide against rain Water teams thanks to its ability, Swift Swim. Lycanroc-D is also a really good partner for Garganacl that appreciates its ability to wear down foes so it can clean up late-game. Coalossal is also a good partner that can not only burn foes but also lay down entry hazards. Coalossal can also clear its side of the field as well with Rapid Spin, alleviating chip damage on the team. It also acts as a soft check to Scizor and Meowscarada due to its neutralities and can potentially neuter them with Flame Body.</p>"

Just note that Covert Cloak will still block these statuses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy and Custap Berry</strong>: Getting rid of Garganacl's status immunity and Ghost resistance is a huge sacrifice, but it can let Garganacl lead against some surprising Pokemon effectively without needing to Terastallize, like Choice Specs Chi-Yu and Iron Bundle. Custap Berry's pseudo-priority can also lead to surprising Stealth Rock set-ups.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Rock may be an awful defensive typing, this Garganacl's complete focus on taking advantage of Salt Cure means that in some scenarios, it can get away without Terastallizing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison's Fighting and Fairy-type resistance vastly improves Garganacl's match-up against Flutter Mane, Ogerpon-H, and Urshifu-R, making it a prime Tera choice. As a bonus, this also lets Garganacl absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Garganacl a better matchup against Chien-Pao, Urshifu-R, and Gholdengo, in addition to being an excellent defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While removing Purifying Salt's Ghost resistance is a shame, Tera Ghost does wonderfully against Archaludon and opposing Garganacl due to the Body Press immunity, and in general removes all of Garganacl's common weaknesses. Tera Ghost also can make foes paranoid of it being the Curse set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying gets rid of the Ground and Fighting weaknesses, giving it a far better chance of beating Landorus-T and Ursaluna-B. It also makes Fissure no longer an issue from Ting-Lu, Dondozo, and opposing Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy lets Garganacl tank powerful Fighting coverage such as Chien-Pao's Scared Sword, and shrug off powerful Dragon-type attacks from Latios and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> </ul>"

Boosting Salt Cure's meager power can also help against frailer Substitute users such as Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Ghost Curse</strong>: If using Tera Ghost, Curse will change its effect, which drastically changes Garganacl's playstyle. While the 50% health cut can make it a tad risky, the Curse affliction is very powerful at wearing down Pokemon, including major foes that take advantage of Salt Cure, such as Covert Cloak Pokemon, bulky Substitute users, and Blaziken Baton Pass chains. When combined with Salt Cure, it can even overwhelm bulky Pokemon with recovery, such as Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curse and Earthquake</strong>: Ghost Curse unfortunately does not work against Gholdengo, so using regular Curse alongside Earthquake makes Garganacl far less passive against against Gholdengo and frail Substitute users such as Flutter Mane. This is especially recommended if using other Tera types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect versus Substitute</strong>: Protect is perfect for getting some extra Leftovers recovery, but Substitute comes in handy against Dragon Tail users like Archaludon and Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Salt Cure means Garganacl can still without Terastallization, but to truly take advantage of either facet of Curse, expect to Terastallize it often.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: In addition to being a great defensive typing that leaves Garganacl with only a weakness to Dark thanks to Purifying Salt, this is the Tera type that enables the unique properties of Curse.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is Garganacl's best option against Flutter Mane, ensuring it resists both STAB attacks. Absorbing Toxic Spikes is also helpful against stall teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: If messing with Gholdengo is the goal, Tera Water is an excellent choice, resisting the powerful Make It Rain and being a good defensive typing in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Beyond being a great typing that offers a Fighting-type resistance, it also means Garganacl no longer has to worry about Dragon Tail from Archaludon. This doesn't improve Garganacl's match-up against Gholdengo though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying has excellent synergy with Garganacl's former typing, making it immune to Landorus-T and Ursaluna-B's Ground-type attacks, and even removing any worry about Fissure from Ting-Lu and Dondozo.

Salt Cure heavily chips common Steel- and Water-types such as Heatran, Alomomola, and Ferrothorn while also impairing the longevity of sweepers like Cresselia and opposing Garganacl, making them passive and more easily exploited by teammates. Recover allows Garganacl to check Pokemon like Heatran and Volcarona and increase its sustainability as a sweeper. Tera Water allows Garganacl to check Pokemon like Urshifu-R while providing valuable resistances to other attacks like Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. Additionally, it allows Garganacl to stave off rain attackers such as Mega Swampert and Barraskewda. Alternatively, Tera Fairy lets Garganacl reliably set up in front of Pokemon like Great Tusk and Zamazenta while becoming a sturdy check to Mega Lopunny. Tera Ghost is another option, letting Garganacl stop Sneasler and Mega Medicham in their tracks, but it must be wary of Pursuit from Weavile and Mega Tyranitar after the fact. Teammates who can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from pivots such as Toxapex and Alomomola greatly assist Garganacl in making progress with the combination of entry hazards and Salt Cure, making Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar great allies. Additionally, the latter two can trap Galarian Slowking with Pursuit, which would be a major roadblock to Garganacl otherwise. Garganacl also appreciates teammates capable of absorbing Knock Off themselves such as Mega Scizor and Gliscor, as its sweeping potential is hindered severely without the passive recovery of Leftovers. Entry hazard removers like Tornadus-T and Great Tusk are also appreciated, as Garganacl is susceptible to chip damage from entry hazards while trying to switch into pivoting attacks like Zapdos's Volt Switch and Tornadus-T's U-turn. Additionally, it benefits from entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Clodsire and Heatran to outdamage Regenerator on Pokemon such as Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Alomomola. Wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Kartana appreciate their checks in Toxapex and Moltres serving as entry points for Garganacl to wreak havoc.</p>"

        "Stealth Rock": {
          "description": "<p>Garganacl is a practical Stealth Rock setter due to its high bulk, amazing ability, and access to Salt Cure. Garganacl can safely set up Stealth Rock against common pivots like Ferrothorn, Alomomola, and Galarian Slowking. Common Defog users like Zapdos, Corviknight, and Moltres can barely threaten Garganacl and take dangerous passive damage from Salt Cure. Other entry hazard removal Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk also dislike Salt Cure as they rely on Leftovers for passive recovery. Protect is crucial for Garganacl for passive recovery from Leftovers and to exacerbate chip damage from Salt Cure. It can also help to scout moves from Choice item users like Tapu Lele and Rillaboom, as well as stalling weather turns against rain and sun teams. However, it is important not to rely on Protect too much to the point where Garganacl can be exploited by opponents. Garganacl has a variety of good Tera types; Tera Water turns the tables versus Pokemon like Urshifu-Rapid-Strike and Mega Scizor and performs better against rain and sun, but leaves it vulernable to opposing Garganacl and Electric-types like Raging Bolt and Tapu Koko. Tera Dragon has most of the advantages of Tera Water in addition to checking Ogerpon-W and Mega Charizard Y, but it makes Garganacl weak to Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Tera Fairy and Tera Ghost both help Garganacl to check Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny. Teammates like Ogerpon-W and Mega Lopunny appreciate Garganacl's ability to threaten Water- and Flying-types. Garganacl also benefits from them dealing with offensive targets like Tapu Lele and opposing Ogerpon-W. Garganacl's main way to gain momentum is via Salt Cure, so foes with Abilities like Regenerator and Poison Heal can nullify its chip damage. It is therefore very helpful to have teammates like Weavile, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko to spam Knock Off or threaten common Regenerator pivots.</p>"

Salt Cure allows Garganacl to chip foes and is complemented by Attack boosts from Curse; it also discourages common threats to Garganacl like Iron Crown and Urshifu-R from switching in directly. Earthquake hits almost all foes for decent damage with enough boosts, threatening Steel- and Electric-types like Iron Crown, Raging Bolt, Galarian Slowking, and Tapu Koko for particularly high damage; Salt Cure covers Flying-types that Earthquake cannot reach. Heavy Slam deals immediate damage to Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Clefable, which threaten to deal massive damage with their STAB moves or are immune to Salt Cure's passive damage in the latter's case. Tera Water allows Garganacl to beat common Water-types like Manaphy, Urshifu-R, and Mega Swampert, giving its team a positive matchup against rain teams. Tera Fairy allows Garganacl to resist Fighting-type moves from Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny, especially when unboosted, as Garganacl gets several free turns to set up after surprising these foes. Garganacl is a fat momentum sapper that lends itself well to balance teams, as they are able to compensate for its lack of immediate power with their ability to withstand heavy damage; Alomomola, a commonly seen Pokemon on these archetypes, is a great ally that can heal up Garganacl, allowing it to be used more recklessly with Salt Cure to offset the passivity of other allies. Garganacl is extremely hampered by Taunt and Knock Off users, as they prevent it from setting up and healing and prevent Leftovers passive recovery. It is best to wait for such foes to be eliminated before trying to set up. Therefore, Knock Off absorbers like Mega Scizor and Gliscor are good teammates to threaten Knock Off users including Hisuian Samurott and Ferrothorn. Garganacl performs best when used with Terastallization, as its base typing gives it nasty weaknesses to common foes like Zamazenta and Landorus-T; thus, allies should try not to expend Terastallization early-game. This means that a solid defensive core, such as Alomomola and Heatran, should be used to help with the longevity of the team and can chip down foes until it is safe to set up.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Garganacl finds itself as a Stealth Rock setter that fits on balance and stall teams with its ability to force progress through passive damage and maintain entry hazards by annoying popular hazard removal options with Salt Cure. Earth Eater allows it to check and set up with Iron Defense or Curse on Ground-types like Iron Treads, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, and Water Absorb allows it to check Greninja, Inteleon, and Quaquaval lacking Close Combat. Stealth Rock pairs well with Salt Cure, as Salt Cure heavily chips common hazard removal options like Iron Treads and Corviknight, while Iron Defense and Curse allow Garganacl to act as a bulky cleaner late-game. Protect allows Garganacl to scout the opponent's move, heal with Leftovers, and force more passive damage on foes, while Earthquake and Body Press hit Magic Guard Pokemon like Quaquaval and Heatran that otherwise switch in freely. Garganacl's inability to check common special wallbreakers like Sheer Force Iron Moth and Enamorus-T makes pivots like Regieleki and Slither Wing and physical wallbreakers like Chien-Pao great partners; in return, they appreciate Garganacl's ability to maintain Stealth Rock on the field and annoy their checks like Hisuian Goodra and Corviknight with Salt Cure. Garganacl gets rapidly worn down by entry hazards when carrying Leftovers, making physically defensive hazard removal options like Corviknight and defensive Quaquaval good partners; these Pokemon also check physical wallbreakers that threaten Garganacl like Galarian Zapdos, while it checks the special wallbreakers that threaten them. The aforementioned Magic Guard Quaquaval checks Garganacl lacking Iron Defense + Body Press and can spin away Garganacl's Stealth Rock; Desolate Land Skeledirge can spinblock Quaquaval effectively, making it a good partner for Garganacl.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>With solid defenses and access to reliable recovery, Garganacl can perform well in a utility role or with setup in Iron Defense. Its biggest selling points are its unique move and ability: Salt Cure offers valuable passive damage, synergizing well with its natural bulk, while Purifying Salt provides a useful immunity to status moves such as Spore and Toxic. Garganacl is difficult to break for many Pokemon, but it matches up notably well into Fire-types such as Chi-Yu and Arcanine, Flying-types like Dragonite and Iron Jugulis, and Amoonguss due to Purifying Salt. As one of the best Wide Guard users, Garganacl can block the format's many powerful spread attacks such as Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Chi-Yu's Heat Wave, and Armarouge's Expanding Force. Iron Defense lets Garganacl play as a potent wincon instead, increasing its Defense whilst simultaneously strengthening its offensive presence through Body Press. These sets can be very difficult to take down, though they often rely on using up Terastallization to be most effective. Garganacl's abysmal Speed means it will usually be relegated to moving last. Rock typing also leaves Garganacl with countless weaknesses, including to Water-, Steel-, and Fighting-type moves, meaning common Pokemon such as Palafin, Gholdengo, Iron Bundle, Iron Hands, and Great Tusk all significantly threaten it. Amoonguss is one of the best partners for Garganacl, being helpful against several of the aforementioned threats, while Garganacl checks Fire-types like Chi-Yu in return, with redirection support and healing being especially critical for Iron Defense sets. Garganacl also appreciates teammates that can check Gholdengo, especially if not using Wide Guard, so Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Arcanine, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit are other desirable additions.</p>",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Other defensive Tera types are also usable depending on team needs. For example, Tera Poison still provides a Fighting-type resistance but doesn't gain the Dark-type weakness that Tera Ghost does. This means after Terastallization, Garganacl will still be good against Chi-Yu and gains immunity to Toxic Spikes, at the cost of not losing its Ground-type weakness. Tera Water is another alternative, offering helpful resists against Water-types like Palafin and Steel-types like Gholdengo.</p>",

By changing its typing to a more defense oriented one, while maintaining the Fire immunity thanks to Flash Fire, Ceruledge can set up Bulk Ups on a variety of common Pokemon, ranging from Corviknight, Kingambit, Azumarill and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt lets Ceruledge set up Bulk Up without needing to fear common phasing moves (with the exception of attacking moves such as Dragon Tail), as well as opposing setup moves such opposing Bulk Up and Iron Defense, provided you outspeed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Sneak</strong> Priority of some form is always nice to have on a Pokemon, which makes Shadow Sneak an easy contender for the last move. Gaining extra added strength against Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Dragapult and Annihilape is certainly charming.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass Tera Blast</strong>: This allows Ceruledge to eliminate Dondozo more quickly. While Taunt can shut down Dondozo's Yawn, it cannot shut down Fissure. The only way to beat Dondozo would be to eliminate it as quickly as possibly, which Grass Tera Blast aids with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flame Charge</strong>: Flame Charge provides Ceruledge an extra net of safety against potential Scarf users and Annihilape, who are capable of turning the tides against it. While normally, Ceruledge is prone to faster Taunt + Bulk Up users and Scarfed Trick, Flame Charge helps mitigate both of those weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Ceruledge can be a status spreader in games where it can't set up as easily. It also helps Ceruledge set up more easily against threats such as Unaware Clodsire.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy helps Ceruledge's matchup against prominent Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: An immunity to Spore and a resistance to Water makes Grass the most notable Tera type for this set. Flash Fire eliminating one of Grass's many weaknesses is also noteworthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Increasing Bitter Blade's power will always be a valuable trait. Eliminating Ghost's weaknesses to Ghost and Dark also allows Ceruledge to set up more comfortably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Tera Bug is similar to Tera Grass, but in exchange for losing the Water resistance and maintaining the Rock weakness of Fire / Ghost, Ceruledge can tank Volcarona's Bug Buzz with significantly more ease.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: Investing into Defense prepares Ceruledge and its mediocre physical bulk for the physical-biased metagame.

Being faster, more often than not, lets Ceruledge win these matchups with ease.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: While most threats in the metagame at the moment are physical, a specially defensive spread is still noteworthy for its ability to surprise Hydreigon.</p> </li> </ul>"

If Ceruledge is brought down to 1 HP, a +2 Bitter Blade can heal it to the point that it can tank an extra attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Shadow Claw</strong>: Close Combat hits the Normal-, Dark-, and Rock-types that resist Ceruledge's STAB combination. Still, Shadow Claw is a noteworthy choice to guarantee the KO on Mimikyu and let Ceruledge pressure Skeledirge. Note, however, that maximum Defense Skeledirge can recover more than Shadow Claw's damage, barring critical hits, and a Terastallized Skeledirge can completely wall this set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance versus Destiny Bond</strong>: As powerful as Swords Dance boosted attacks from Ceruledge are, the abundance of Unaware Pokemon, primarily Dondozo, has made some players opt to use Destiny Bond to snag surprise kills. Destiny Bond can also make the matchup against KOing common Sucker Punch Pokemon, such as Meowscarada and Kingambit, easier to win without having to rely on predictions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant's added damage output is valuable, but Jolly allows Ceruledge to outspeed non-Scarf Gholdengo, and gives it a chance at outspeeding Modest Rotom formes and Glimmora. All of the mentioned examples are Special Attackers, meaning Ceruledge's Weak Armor often does not trigger in these matchups.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Giving Bitter Blade an extra push in damage is quite useful, giving Ceruledge more recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Normal is an exceedingly common Tera Type on Ghost types due to the immunity it brings to the table. Ceruledge makes particularly excellent use of Normal Tera by resisting both Steel and Fairy, making it very difficult for Gholdengo and Mimikyu to click anything other than a Ghost type move when facing off against Ceruledge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Giving extra reach pwer to Close Combat, a powerful option against Pokemon such as Hydreigon, makes Fighting a solid choice for a Tera Type.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Kilowattrel is an essential component to Flying teams, providing an Electric immunity, pivot support, an excellent Speed tier that allows it to outspeed Choice Specs Greninja and Iron Valiant, and a range of hard-hitting attacks. With rain support, Thunder can be used as Kilowattrel's hard-hitting STAB attack to hit Pokemon—such as Toxapex—that Flying teams can struggle to take down. Thunderbolt is a fine substitute on Flying teams that do not utilize rain. Volt Switch allows Kilowattrel to pivot, making use of Kilowattrel's high Speed tier to get off damage while not being Choice locked. Hurricane couples with the preceding moves to cover Kilowattrel's STAB combination, specifically hitting Ground-types such as Quagsire and Gastrodon. The last slot depends on whether rain is being taken advantage of: on rain teams, Weather Ball can be used to hit Ground-types such as Unaware Clodsire, while Air Slash is another option for non-rain teams that can make up for Hurricane's lower accuracy. Choice Specs allows Kilowattrel to hit extremely hard, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Azumarill with Volt Switch and Amoonguss with Hurricane. Volt Absorb provides the only Electric immunity for Flying-type teams.</p> <p>Corviknight is one of Kilowattrel's greatest assets; beyond providing a neutral switch-in to Ice-type attacks—especially in the cases of Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Greninja—Corviknight provides a physical wall that Kilowattrel can pivot into. It is also Flying's most common Defogger, which is essential, as Kilowattrel is susceptible to Stealth Rock damage, hindering its pivoting. Pelipper is very useful in supporting Kilowattrel, as rain support ensures accuracy of Kilowattrel's Thunder and Hurricane, and U-turn on Pelipper ensures safe pivoting. Talonflame is another defensive supporter, covering Kilowattrel's weakness to Ice-types and offering another Defogger. Dragonite hits the specially defensive walls that Kilowattrel struggles with such as Clodsire and Blissey. Gyarados finds great support from Kilowattrel; as Kilowattrel punches holes in defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Toxapex, Gyarados will have a better chance to sweep late-game. While Kilowattrel has excellent Speed itself, Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo and Salamence can revenge kill Pokemon such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane that outspeed Kilowattrel. Bombirdier offers Stealth Rock support and uses Knock Off to remove key items such as Leftovers on Gastrodon, which puts it into 2HKO range of Hurricane after Stealth Rock damage.</p>"

Tera Dark boosts Crunch's power, but Tera Fairy can be used instead to strengthen Play Rough and get rid of Mabosstiff's Fighting and Bug weaknesses. Entry hazard support from Qwilfish and Chansey is very helpful, allowing Mabosstiff to 2HKO walls like Sandaconda on the switch in with Tera Dark Crunch as well as clean with greater ease. Strong wallbreakers like Medicham, Ursaring, and Clawitzer are good at making up for Mabosstiff's low raw damage output.

          "description": "<p>Klawf is an amazing defensive wall, offering utility through Stealth Rock and Knock Off, being very hard to wear down thanks to Regenerator, and using it's solid bulk and typing to check common threats such as Skuntank and Charizard. When compared to other Rock-type walls like Carbink and Hisuian Avalugg, which offer higher bulk and hazard control like Spikes and Rapid Spin, Klawf's Knock Off, Regenerator, and overall versatility are what make it the preferred option on many teams. Furthermore, Klawf's Regenerator and Heavy-Duty Boots give it more longevity than other Knock Off users like Tinkatuff and Thwackey. Klawf's STAB move of choice isn't overly important and can be chosen between Stone Edge for more power and Rock Slide for more reliability. Swords Dance helps with the lack of Attack investment and makes Klawf a larger offensive threat. High Horsepower provides coverage for Steel-types like Perrserker and Tinkatuff and various other targets like Skuntank and Raichu. Klawf's naturally high Defense allows it to invest into Special Defense, making it a mixed wall and improving its ability to check special threats like Pyroar and Haunter. 232 HP EVs maximize Klawf's recovery from Regenerator while lessening damage from Skuntank and Electrode's Aftermath and hazards if Heavy-Duty Boots is removed. 56 Speed EVs alongside Jolly nature allow Klawf to outspeed 252 Speed Cacturne and uninvested Lumineon. That being said, Klawf's EV spread and nature are very flexible, and you can choose to invest into Defense to make it a dedicated physical wall, running Careful nature to further improve its special bulk while still outspeeding Tinkatuff and max Speed Perrserker, or go down a more offensive route with max Attack. Dragon is Klawf's preferred Tera type, losing its weaknesses to Water- and Grass types like Basculin and Thwackey while being a great defensive typing overall. But its Tera type is also flexible, such as Tera Ground for a Volt Switch immunity and STAB High Horsepower, Tera Ghost to spinblock and gain a Fighting immunity, and Tera Flying to gain resistance to moves like like Alolan Dugtrio's Earthquake, Cacturne's Giga Drain, and Charizard's Focus Blast.</p> <p>Klawf's utility and versatility make it viable on virtually any archetype. With Klawf being the best Knock Off user in a metagame full of Heavy Duty-Boots users and not much of hazard removal, it pairs greatly with other hazard setters. Spikes Whiscash is a common partner for Klawf because of this while also forming a great defensive core with Klawf to check threats like Perrserker and Gabite. Swalot, Mareanie, and Skuntank can set Toxic Spikes to slowly stall foes out while checking Grass-types like Gogoat and offering other utility like Toxic, Encore, Taunt, and Haze. Mareanie is also notable, since it forms a Regenerator core with Klawf. Finally, in terms of hazards, Knock Off paired with Masquerain's Sticky Web makes it easier for setup sweepers like double dance Wyrdeer and Nasty Plot Haunter to sweep. Fast teammates like Pyroar, support Alolan Persian, and the previously mentioned setup sweepers also appreciate Knock Off removing any Choice Scarfs, making them harder to revenge kill. The former two also offer support with Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Thunder Wave. Alolan Persian's Parting Shot and other pivots like Rotom-F and Electrode give Klawf more opportunities to come in and switch out to activate Regenerator. Grass-types like Gogoat and Leafeon check Water-types like Basculin and Golduck, while Klawf checks Flying- and Fire-types like Charizard and Pyroar for them. Leafeon's Wish also improves Klawf's longevity, as do other clerics like Heal Bell Chansey and Wish Komala.</p>"

Using Anger Shell and the spread 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can turn Klawf into a more immediately threatening sweeper even if it doesn’t manually boost, but this limits its longevity and consistency.</p> <p>Sample set.

Growth is run for Scovillain to boost its damage output while under sun, letting it secure KOs more easily. Giga Drain threatens Pokemon like Ting-Lu, allowing Scovillain's teammates to break through them late-game, and it also aids in improving Scovillain's longevity by recovering its HP. Fire Blast can be used to have a chance of 2HKOing Skeledirge and Clodsire under sun, but Flamethrower is the preferred Fire-type STAB move, since its accuracy is higher than Fire Blast's. Stomping Tantrum hits opposing Fire-types such as Iron Moth. Solar Beam is an alternative to Stomping Tantrum, OHKOing the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Toxapex after Growth in sun. Life Orb and 32 Attack EVs maximize Scovillain's power, letting it 2HKO specially defensive Clodsire with Stomping Tantrum after Stealth Rock damage. If opting for Solar Beam, the remaining EVs go into HP. A Naive nature allows Scovillain to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Great Tusk and Iron Moth under sun while not losing out on Stomping Tantrum damage.</p> <p>Torkoal is a mandatory partner for Scovillain, as its ability to set up sun allows Scovillain to outspeed many faster threats like Iron Treads, Iron Jugulis, and Quaquaval, dealing heavy chip damage or outright KOing them. Scovillain appreciates Torkoal getting rid of entry hazards; in return, Scovillain deals with Water- and Ground-types like Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Sandy Shocks. Paldean Tauros-F is a great offensive partner for Scovillain, granting benefits such as breaking dual screens from Pokemon like Klefki and Grimmsnarl, which impede Scovillain's sweeping ability. Paldean Tauros-F is also able to check specially defensive walls like Blissey; in return, Scovillain breaks past bulky Water-types like Slowking and Toxapex after one Growth under sun. Cinderace can offer alternate entry hazard removal with Court Change, which helps Scovillain's longevity. Furthermore, Cinderace's Speed tier allows it to handle offensive Pokemon that naturally outpace Scovillain outside of sun like Hydreigon and Iron Treads, the former of which Scovillain cannot hit neutrally. Scovillain also appreciates Volcarona as an offensive partner thanks to its non-weather-reliant sweeping potential in Quiver Dance, dealing with Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Garchomp, while Scovillain can weaken Volcarona's checks like Ting-Lu, Unaware Clodsire, and Toxapex throughout the course of the game.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Scovillain turns up the heat on its Fire Blast with a Choice Specs set, burning up Clodsire and Skeledirge, which usually have no problem with its Growth set. It's notably also strong enough to score a 2HKO on physically defensive Toxapex after minimal chip damage, allowing Scovillain to beat Poison teams if it hits every move. Alternatively, Overheat has better accuracy and still 2HKOes Skeledirge and Clodsire, but the Special Attack drop makes it less spammable. Giga Drain threatens a 2HKO on Pelipper, which may be tempted to come into Scovillain to block Solar Beam, and also provides Scovillain a form of recovery. A Timid nature lets it outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Gengar and Protosynthesis-boosted Choice Specs Walking Wake to burn them to a crisp, while a Modest nature has better odds of 2HKOing Toxapex with Giga Drain and OHKOing Baxcalibur with Flamethrower at the cost of outspeeding only up to non-Speed boosting Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks.</p> <p>Torkoal is a mandatory teammate, as it sets sun, which Scovillain needs to boost its Speed with Chlorophyll, and provides entry hazard support with its ability to set Stealth Rock and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Other forms of entry hazard support in Defog Talonflame and Court Change Cinderace are also appreciated; they also have access to U-turn, which allows Scovillain to get in more times to wallbreak. Ceruledge packs Shadow Sneak to deal with Flutter Mane, which otherwise outspeeds and dispatches Scovillain with ease. In return, Scovillain obliterates bulky Unaware walls like Quagsire, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, all of which hinder Swords Dance Ceruledge from cutting down Water and Ghost teams. Similarly, Volcarona and Iron Moth love Scovillain's ability to eliminate bulky walls like Clodsire and Ting-Lu, allowing them to clean up Poison and Ground teams late-game. Skeledirge deals with Kingambit and Choice Scarf Meowscarada, which threaten Scovillain with priority or by outspeeding it and picking it off.</p>"

        "Sun Attacker": {
          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Tera Fire Scovillain's damage under sun is absurd, managing to barely KO even Fire-resistant targets. Most notably, its ability to defeat most Pokemon, even powerful Dragon-types, without fearing surprise Terastallizations makes Scovillain a charming offensive option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Overheat and Fire Blast</strong>: Overheat combined with Tera Fire and Choice Specs guarantees the KO on Garchomp  without bulk EVs, and OHKO offensive Roaring Moon after Stealth Rock damage. Against the frailer Dragapult, Tera Fire and Fire Blast is enough to earn the KO. It's recommended to run both Fire STAB moves because Overheat's added damage can be necessary to guarantee certain KOs, but its stat drop can be fatal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Solar Beam versus Leaf Storm</strong>: Solar Beam nails the few bulky Water-types that can survive Scovillain's absurd attacks, most notable examples being notably Gastrodon and Assault Vest Azumarill. However, Leaf Storm can be used in its stead for the ability to OHKO Hippowdon, despite it summoning sand.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: Flamethrower is perfectly accurateand is typically more than enough to nip off frailer foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: In spite of the type matchup, Scovillain is deceptively weak to Kingambit thanks to Sucker Punch. Additionally, many Pokemon will use Protect in front of Scovillain to waste sun turns— most notably Espathra and Dondozo. Against all of these foes, a well-timed Substitute can guarantee the win.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: It is almost mandatory to run Tera Fire on this Scovillain set. Tera Fire guarantees KOs on most Dragon-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: The abundantly common Dragonite is incredibly strong against Scovillain. Should Stealth Rock support be deemed enough to let Scovillain sweep teams reasonably, even without Tera Fire, using Tera Ghost to gain an immunity to Extreme Speed can be very useful.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock</strong>: Tera Rock with Tera Blast can be a decent alternative to Tera Fire, as it gives Scovillain excellent coverage and also provides a much-needed countermeasure to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "Moody Ace": {
          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>The metagame's abundance of Unaware Pokemon makes it difficult to maneuver Moody Pokemon in general. On top of that, Scovillain is held back by the powerful Dragon-types that resist its STAB combination. However, Scovillain still carves a niche for itself by being the only Moody Pokemon with excellent recovery moves, Leech Seed and Ingrain, allowing it to win a variety of matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect and Substitute</strong>: Protect and Substitute are mandatory to get the most opportunities to activate Moody. Once you gain enough Defense or Special Defense boosts that Scovillain's Substitute can tank an attack without breaking, it tends to be easy to win the game. Note, however, that Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers's animation make Scovillain very vulnerable to losing via timer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: With enough Moody boosts, Scovillain's Flamethrower tends to be enough to break through an entire team. There are very few Pokemon that are immune or quadruply resistant to Fire, and Flamethrower has good PP and accuracy, which makes it an easy pick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: Unlike Flamethrower, Giga Drain gets shrugged off by a lot of Pokemon, even at +6, notably Corviknight and Dragonite. However, an attacking move that helps recover HP lost from Substitutes gives Scovillain more mileage off of Moody. Giga Drain is also notable to more reliably defeat Dondozo, one of the Unaware Pokemon that would give Scovillain a lot of trouble otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leech Seed</strong>: Leech Seed combined with Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers helps Scovillain restore HP while collecting Moody boosts, as well as chipping Pokemon it'd otherwise have trouble against, such as Clodsire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain</strong>: Ingrain is an alternative recovery option that makes Scovillain impervious to phazing moves. When purely considering recovery, it's more reliable than the inaccurate 90% accurate Leech Seed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast with Tera Fairy is an excellent option that helps remedy Scovillain's Dragon susceptibility, particularly making the Infiltrator Dragapult and Roaring Moon matchup easier.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: The Water resistance helps Scovillain beat Dondozo. Even though Dondozo ignores Scovillain's Defense boosts via Unaware, with Tera Water, Scovillain's Substitute can tank a Wave Crash. Tera Water also keeps the Scovillain's Steel resistance, unlike Tera Grass, which makes it easier to check Scizor—a common priority user that people attempt to use to check Moody Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy mitigating Scovillain's weakness to Dragon-types is massively helpful.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>180 HP / 220 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 100 Spe with Bold</strong>: This spread bolsters Scovillain’s physical bulk. Notably, Tera Water Scovillain's Substitute manages to survive Dondozo's Wave Crash with this spread. The Speed allows Scovillain to outspeed slow Baxcalibur and Gholdengo, as well as Dragapult with one Moody Speed boost. The HP is adjusted to make maximum use of Leftovers, with the resulting stat having a remainder of 1 when divided by 16. The remaining EVs are split between Special Attack and Special Defense because, at level 50, investing 8 EVs in either stat has no benefit over investing 4.</li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Rabsca is a fearsome, albeit relatively niche, late-game sweeper that makes use of Trick Room, healthy Special Attack, and good coverage to perform cleaning and wallbreaking duties. Psyshock takes precedence over Psychic, as it allows Rabsca to pressure specially defensive foes like Articuno and setup sweepers like Calm Mind Misdreavus; it also lets Rabsca deal considerably more damage to Crabominable. Earth Power deals considerable damage to Skuntank, Pyroar, Alolan Dugtrio, and Tinkatuff and complements Psyshock by pressuring targets like Iron Defense Carbink. Bug Buzz is Rabsca's best move to pressure foes like Gogoat and Alolan Persian. Recover allows Rabsca to mitigate entry hazard chip damage as well as to play a more active role during early-game as a switch-in to targets like Indeedee-F and Raichu, although forgoing Bug Buzz notably leaves it unable to hit Honchkrow and limits its ability to check Gogoat. Life Orb greatly increases Rabsca's damage output, notably allowing it to OHKO targets like Skuntank and Crabominable before Terastallizing, as well as 2HKO specially defensive Articuno after slight chip damage. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used for easier setup and more reliable checking of targets, like Carbink, should Rabsca choose to run Recover, but it usually prefers the increased damage output. Tera Ground and Tera Bug can be used to boost Earth Power and Bug Buzz's damage output, respectively; they also notably ease its ability to set up on Misdreavus, which otherwise threatens it with Shadow Ball or Hex, as well as prevent Skuntank and Honchkrow's Sucker Punch from prematurely ending its sweep. Tera Psychic is less reliable, as it limits Rabsca's setup opportunities, but it is otherwise effective for beating Articuno. A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs allow Rabsca to outspeed the entire metagame, aside from other dedicated Trick Room attackers like Crabominable and Camerupt, while Trick Room is active.</p> <p>Rabsca works best as a late-game sweeper, making it a good fit on offensive teams that can wear opposing Pokemon down throughout the match and take care of Pokemon like Misdreavus and Alolan Persian that can make Rabsca's job of setting up with Trick Room difficult. Pivots like Alolan Persian, Rotom-F, and Articuno can create safe switch-in opportunities for Rabsca if it is needed to check a target early-game or set up late-game. Bulky Alolan Persian can switch into Pokemon that threaten Rabsca out like Lycanroc-N, and it appreciates Rabsca pressuring foes like Dachsbun and Tinkatuff for it. Rotom-F and Articuno appreciate Recover variants of Rabsca, which are able to check Carbink, and in return, they can pressure threats like Masquerain and Misdreavus for it. Raichu, as well as Tinkatuff, can create setup opportunities for Rabsca with Encore; the latter is especially notable for making Rabsca's late-game cleaning easier by accelerating the opposing team being worn down by hazards with Knock Off. Indeedee-F can form an efficient Psychic-type core with Rabsca, and it notably gives Life Orb variants optimal entry with Healing Wish as well as boosting Psyshock and blocking priority from Pokemon like Skuntank and Basculin with Psychic Terrain. Crabominable greatly appreciates Recover variants' ability to check Carbink, and it can make use of leftover Trick Room turns to wallbreak. Hazard removers like Dartrix and Quaxwell can ease Life Orb variants' task of setting up late-game without relying on recovery.</p>"

Stored Power's base power quickly raises with the combination of Speed Boost and Calm Mind, reaching astronomical levels that can break through foes which resist it like Corviknight, Hatterene, and Gholdengo. With enough boosts, Stored Power is powerful enough to break through Unaware walls like Skeledirge, Dondozo and Clodsire. Dazzling Gleam complements Stored Power well, as it can beat Dark-types which would otherwise wall Espathra such as Sableye, Meowscarada, and Greninja. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Espathra ignore entry hazards when switching in and couples well with Roost to increase Espathra's longevity, letting it set up easily. Alternatively, Leftovers in conjunction with Substitute and Roost or Protect lets Espathra safely get Speed boosts while also being able to scout foes' moves. 56 Speed EVs let Espathra outspeed Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gallade and Hoopa-U at +1 Speed, while the rest are placed into HP and Defense, giving Espathra enough bulk to set up with ease against physical attackers such as Garchomp, Great Tusk and Corviknight.</p> <p>Espathra appreciates teammates that can accentuate its offensive prowess. Scream Tail can set dual screens and paralyze opponents with Thunder Wave to make setting up easie while also setting Stealth Rock and can even Wish pass to Espathra. Gallade, along with Scream Tail with the set of Substitute, Bulk Up, Drain Punch and Play Rough can also punish Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Kingambit.

Indeedee is a Ghost-type switch-in and sets up Psychic Terrain for Espathra, protecting it from priority attacks like Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch. Indeedee is also able to Healing Wish to give Espathra a second chance to sweep. Stored Power Armarouge forms a dangerous core with Espathra, which can break for Espathra, clean after it, and also beat Steel teams.

However, it can be passive at times, is unable to cripple Electric-type Pokemon such as Raichu and Electrode, and is heavily reliant on Eviolite for its bulk. Tinkatuff's abilities as a Stealth Rock setter are complemented by Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots of common switch-ins to it like Charizard and Pyroar, greatly hindering their longevity. Knock Off can also cripple the most common hazard removers, Dartrix and Quaxwell, both of which greatly rely on their Eviolite. Encore is used to halt setup sweepers like Gogoat, Carbink, and Masquerain, letting a teammate threaten them out. Rest can also be run to ensure that Tinkatuff is a long-term switch-in to Pokemon like Indeedee-F, Alolan Persian, and Skuntank; however, this forces Tinkatuff to remain immobile for multiple turns, compounding its issues with passivity. Mold Breaker is used for two niche applications: removing items from Sticky Hold Swalot and paralyzing a Terastallized Raichu with Thunder Wave. A specially defensive spread makes Tinkatuff a better switch-in to Pokemon like Nasty Plot Skuntank, Haunter, and Alolan Persian. However, a physically defensive spread of 252 HP/ 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature is also an option to switch into threats like Lycanroc-N and Daschbun more consistently. Tera Water allows Tinkatuff to check the various Fire- and Water-types in the tier such as Charizard, Pyroar, and Golduck more reliably; Tera Dragon does the same but trades a weakness towards Electric-types like Electrode and Raichu for one against Dragon-types like Drakloak and Flapple.</p> <p>Tinkatuff struggles heavily with strong physical attackers like Basculin and Crabominable, so Pokemon that can cover for them are necessary. Mareanie is adept at switching into both of these threats as well as others that threaten Tinkatuff, like Perrserker and Falinks; in return, Tinkatuff can switch into threatening Psychic- and Electric-types like Indeedee-F and Electrode. Misdreavus is also a solid choice, switching into many annoying Ground-types like Dugtrio and Gabite while checking Fire-types like Charizard and Pyroar in a pinch. It also heavily benefits from Tinkatuff spreading paralysis, powering up its Hex. Rock- and Water-types like Carbink and Whiscash are sturdier switch-ins to the Fire-types that threaten out Tinkatuff, which it appreciates. Gabite is also a strong partner for Tinkatuff, checking strong Fire-types like Houndoom and Camerupt for Tinkatuff while appreciating Tinkatuff running Stealth Rock and removing opposing Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off so it can rack up chip damage on the opposing team quickly with Dragon Tail sets.</p>"

Many of the aforementioned Pokemon are also very common on teams without Murkrow, so Tinkaton checking them well is broadly useful.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mold Breaker + Fake Out Tinkaton does well against dedicated Trick Room teams because its Fake Out bypasses Oranguru's Inner Focus and Farigiraf's Armor Tail, and it can OHKO Mimikyu through Disguise.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tinkaton struggles with the extremely common Fire-types, as well as Garchomp and Steel-types like Corviknight and Scizor, which wall it entirely.

Knock Off is helpful for keeping Stealth Rock up, punishing Hattrem and Defoggers like Drifblim, Scyther, and Oricorio-F, in addition to pressuring walls like Umbreon and Eelektross. Parting Shot is an alternative to U-turn that gives frailer teammates an easier time switching in, which can be extremely useful on offense teams, though it doesn't deal any damage and unfortunately activates Passimian's Defiant and Lurantis's Contrary. With 72 Speed EVs, Bombirdier outruns and usually beats Modest Clawitzer one-on-one. The Speed investment also allows Bombirdier to outspeed Cacturne and defensive Qwilfish.

          "description": "<p>Bombirdier is a great dedicated entry hazard lead due to the incredibly deep utility movepool. Stealth Rock and Taunt are a classic staple for any dedicated lead, quickly setting up hazards while preventing the opponent from removing them or setting up their own. Bombirdier makes great use of its STAB Knock Off to deal a decent chunk of damage before going down while also hindering the longevity of the many Flying-type Defog users like Braviary, Drifblim, and Scyther by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Memento is an amazing move for Bombirdier, facilitating the hyper offensive teams it's commonly found on. Memento can block an incoming Defog, but its main purpose is to allow for easy setup of an ally like Lilligant or Hisuian Sneasel against a weakened foe. Rock Blast allows Bombirdier to get the edge on opposing dedicated leads like Bombirdier and Froslass, breaking their Focus Sash and potentially OHKOing them. Tera Ghost simply blocks Rapid Spin, namely from the likes of Cryogonal and Avalugg, both of which also greatly dislike having their Heavy-Duty Boots removed and taking powerful Rock-type attacks. Tera Ground lets Bombirdier potentially block an Electric-type attack; OHKOing Rotom with Knock Off or heavily damaging Eelektross could be crucial for Bombirdier's teammates, but as a dedicated lead, Bombirdier will not be Terastallizing often because it is best reserved for its offensive teammates.</p> <p>As mentioned, Bombirdier is often relegated to hyper offensive teams, which make the most use out of the hazards and momentum generated by it. Fast setup sweepers like Lilligant, Hisuian Sneasel, and Vivillon all greatly appreciate both the entry hazard support and the setup opportunity granted through Memento. Bombirdier can be coupled with a dedicated Froslass lead, which can set Spikes and double up the entry hazards and support for the team, although Froslass is also direct competition for Bombirdier's role. Faster Taunt users like Pyroar and Qwilfish can shut down Bombirdier but must be wary of Bombirdier's attacks. Bombirdier is often dealt with by physical walls like Sandaconda and Qwilfish; using Knock Off to remove their Rocky Helmet and weaken them greatly assists physical sweepers like Hisuian Sneasel, Scyther, and Tauros.</p>"

Bombirdier has access to some of the best offensive STAB moves in the game, with the highly coveted Knock Off, high-Base Power Brave Bird, and Rocky Payload-boosted Rock-type moves.</p> <p>Other useful options would be to use Stone Edge as a Rock-type pseudo-STAB attack; it has more power than Rock Blast but comes with more risk due to its lower accuracy. Additionally, Memento is an option over Parting Shot, which would further weaken an enemy to allow for a safer setup turn with a sweeper like Dudunsparce or Veluza. With this set, the Tera Dark is recommended to increase the damage of Knock Off; Tera Rock can also be considered, but most of the time, if you want to deal damage, Knock Off is more reliable. Brave Bird, the second STAB move, is another spammable option that helps Bombirdier deal with Fighting-type Pokemon that can take Dark and Rock moves, like Paldean Tauros and Toxicroak. With Choice Band, Bombirdier can deal some real damage off its great Attack stat.</p> <p>As for teammates, we have some options. Sandaconda its a good option because of its Electric immunity, and Parting Shot can help it boost up safety. Setup sweepers like Bruxish, Lilligant, and Farigiraf greatly benefit from Bombirdier's Parting Shot and Knock Off weakening the opposition. To continue the pivot partners, Scyther and Choice Scarf Rotom make a solid VoltTurn core with Bombirdier.

However, it does make Palafin-H particularly vulnerable to Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water helps Palafin-H pick off more threats with Jet Punch, having a good shot to OHKO offensive Flutter Mane unboosted after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Besides offering a useful Fairy resistance, Tera Poison lets Palafin-H absorb Toxic Spikes and stop Toxic without a support move, making it a viable alternative.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers takes advantage of Palafin-H's slow setup and is a requirement if using Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove</strong>: If using Taunt, Punching Glove is a good option to free up Leftovers for a teammate. Palafin-H appreciates the extra power Jet Punch and Drain Punch gain, and it becomes harder for Rocky Helmet Dragonite to wear it down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If using Taunt, Covert Cloak turns the tables on the Garganacl matchup in addition to protecting Palafin-H from surprise Light Ball Flings from foes like Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 140 SpD / 116 Spe with Careful</strong>: This spread maximizes Palafin-H's Special Defense while still outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximizing Speed allows Palafin-H to outspeed fast support Pokemon like Mimikyu and Annihilape so it can Taunt them.

Jet Punch circumvents common speed control and is threatening against the frailer metagame, notably OHKOing Chi-Yu and Landorus at +1. Drain Punch is a reliable means of recovery in addition to Leftovers while also hitting popular Dark-types like Kingambit and Chien-Pao, as well as common Water-resistant or immune foes such as Rillaboom and Volcanion harder. Tera Grass provides an immunity to Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, as well as resistances to Grass- and Electric-type attacks such as Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Iron Hands's Wild Charge, which would otherwise OHKO Palafin. Palafin's base forme has poor damage output and bulk, so it is often ideal for it to lead and pivot out immediately to activate Zero to Hero. This is so crucial to Palafin's functioning that it is very telegraphed and easily exploitable with powerful attacks directed at it. To cover for this, Palafin may lead together with a Fake Out user or a redirector to reduce incoming damage. Bulk Up Palafin pairs well with partners that can remove Psychic Terrain, use Fake Out to generate free turns for Palafin to set up, and extend Palafin's longevity. Rillaboom fulfills all of these roles, with Grassy Terrain granting additional passive recovery. Cresselia is another good partner, as its Lunar Blessing heals Palafin and cures burn and poison, which would otherwise severely limit Palafin's offensive output or the turns it can stay on field. Amoonguss's Rage Powder redirects threatening attacks such as Iron Hands's Wild Charge, removes Toxic Spikes that reduce Palafin's longevity, and provides a major source of recovery for Palafin with Pollen Puff. Iron Hands is a Fake Out user whose Electric-type attacks eliminate opposing Water-types that resist Jet Punch. Grimmsnarl can also increase Palafin's bulk and create setup opportunities with its dual screens. As Amoonguss effortlessly walls Palafin and undoes its progress with Clear Smog, Palafin requires partners that deal with it effectively, like Heatran, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p>"

Toxic Debris's potential to set up Toxic Spikes can prove lethal against certain teams, particularly more offensive ones due to the lack of offensive Poison-types in OU able to absorb them. Mortal Spin's side effect of inflicting poison detracts Pokemon such as Ting-Lu from setting up entry hazards multiple times and Hatterene from trying to deny Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. Power Gem lets Glimmora hit most targets for decent damage, and notably chips at Corviknight, Skarmory, and Gliscor that would otherwise wall Glimmora, with Corviknight also removing its entry hazards with Defog. Earth Power allows Glimmora to hit Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Heatran, which otherwise are able to block Mortal Spin, with the former two also resisting Power Gem. Mud Shot is another option over Earth Power, as its side effect of lowering the foe's Speed allows Glimmora to win the mirror matchup against opposing Glimmora. Mud Shot can also slow down foes trying to use Glimmora as setup fodder, such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon, preventing them from getting out of hand. Focus Sash allows Glimmora to live any one hit and thus be able to set up Stealth Rock safely. Tera Ghost grants Glimmora with an immunity to Rapid Spin from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads, denying their attempts from removing Glimmora's entry hazards.</p> <p>Glimmora finds its home on hyper offense teams that enjoy it starting the match strong by setting up Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes from the beginning. Kingambit greatly appreciates this, as even Pokemon that resist Sucker Punch like Roaring Moon and Enamorus can potentially get KOed by +2 Sucker Punch after a round or two of Stealth Rock, while physically defensive walls trying to switch in like Skarmory and Corviknight have to contend with not only Kingambit's attacks but also with the chip damage from Stealth Rock. Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant similarly enjoy Glimmora's entry hazards chipping at the foes for them and the rest of the team to win late-game, while they also provide Knock Off support to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Dondozo, Alomomola, and Clodsire, making them susceptible to its hazards. Gholdengo may be used alongside Glimmora, as its Ghost typing and Good as Gold ability let it block Rapid Spin and Defog attempts, thus making sure Glimmora's entry hazards stay up. Glimmora may also play a defensive role on occasion, as its good matchup against Skeledirge lets it assist teammates like Volcarona and Zamazenta that can struggle against it.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Glimmora provides useful utility for Poison teams thanks to its status as the only entry hazard remover for Poison teams, ability to put walls such as Amoonguss and Corviknight on a timer with Toxic, and access to Stealth Rock, which completes Poison's entry hazard stacking core. Mortal Spin's poison wears down entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and Hatterene looking to bounce back Stealth Rock over time. Steel-types like Iron Treads, Heatran, and Gholdengo can block Mortal Spin, so Earth Power is great, as it punishes these for switching into it; however, Stealth Rock is usually the better option, as it helps Poison teams wear down opposing teams more quickly. For similar reasons, Toxic is great for putting Steel-types, notably Corviknight, on a timer, and it also eases the Poison matchup, as Glimmora outspeeds and can inflict Toxic on the aforementioned walls before it faints. Power Gem prevents Glimmora from being too passive and lets it threaten non-Glaive Rush Baxcalibur if its Air Balloon is intact and Substitute + Bulk Up Corviknight. Energy Ball lets Glimmora threaten Water-types like Quagsire, which normally threatens it out. Maximum Special Attack and Speed boost Glimmora's offensive presence, allowing it to outspeed and possibly win against Gholdengo one-on-one with Earth Power. Air Balloon further increases Glimmora's utility, as it lets Gholdengo double as a switch-in to Choice-locked threats such as Great Tusk and Iron Jugulis, which tend to lock into a Ground-type move against Poison. Alternatively, Black Sludge along with a more defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 212 Def / 44 Spe and a Bold nature improves Glimmora's longevity, notably allowing it to survive a +2 Crunch from Chien-Pao and outspeed and inflict Toxic on Jolly Kingambit. If this is desired, Spiky Shield is a better option over Stealth Rock to further rack up recovery.</p> <p>As Glimmora's typing is horrible into types such as Water and Ground, Toxapex and Amoonguss are great partners, as both sponge hits from threats such as Barraskewda, Quagsire, and non-Choice Band Great Tusk with ease. Furthermore, these Pokemon allow Glimmora's Toxic to do its job and take out Bulk Up Corviknight, opposing Amoonguss, and Clodsire by completely walling them. Amoonguss in particular is great into Ground-types like Landorus-T, which Glimmora can't do much against. Alolan Muk provides a Psychic-type immunity and is an extremely bulky special wall that helps against Choice Specs Dragapult, Hatterene, and Flutter Mane. It also provides Knock Off support, which leaves walls such as Toxapex to be vulnerable to Glimmora's entry hazards. Clodsire provides Spikes, checks other special attackers such as Quiver Dance Volcarona, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Regieleki. Alternatively, Overqwil may also be considered as Glimmora's entry hazard stacking partner, as it can deal with Iron Valiant and Belly Drum Azumarill. Salazzle forms a Corrosion core with Glimmora and can land Toxic on threats such as Heatran, which loathe coming into Glimmora. It also provides Encore to neutralize Swords Dance Kingambit and Bulk Up Landorus-T and has access to Knock Off to further disrupt foes. Sneasler threatens Kingambit and loves Glimmora's ability to wear down walls like Toxapex and Corviknight and lure in Gholdengo and hit it with Toxic or Earth Power, allowing Sneasler to clean up Water and Steel teams late-game. Iron Moth also appreciates Glimmora wearing down teams with its entry hazards and dealing with Skeledirge; it is also the best response Poison teams have against Nasty Plot Gholdengo. Galarian Slowking is also an option, as it makes progress in the Poison matchup with Future Sight and retains the ability to pivot or damage with special attackers like Basculegion-F, Landorus, and Nasty Plot Rotom-W, but it can be quickly taken advantage of by the multitude of Dark- and Ghost-types in the tier.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Glimmora is a decent Choice Scarf user for Rock teams due to its high Special Attack and Speed to take on threats like Ogerpon-W, Hisuian Lilligant, and non-Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. Earth Power threatens Steel- and Poison-types like Gholdengo, non-Air Balloon Heatran, Iron Moth, and Sneasler. Sludge Wave is a strong STAB move that can take on Fairy- and Grass-types such as Hisuian Lilligant, Ogerpon-W, Ogerpon-H, and non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant. Dazzling Gleam takes out Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types like Sableye, Hydreigon, and Kommo-o. Energy Ball allows Glimmora to deal with Water- and Ground-types like Quagsire and non-Choice Scarf Greninja and Great Tusk. Mortal Spin can be run over Energy Ball to help remove entry hazards and poison foes in the process. Power Gem can be run instead to deal with Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Kleavor.</p> <p>Tyranitar provides sand and a Psychic immunity while also taking on special attackers for Glimmora such as Spectrier, Espathra, and Hisuian Zoroark. Thanks to the sand Tyranitar provides, Glimmora can survive a Choice Specs Draco Meteor from Dragapult due to the Special Defense boost and 2HKO it with Dazzling Gleam. In return, Glimmora also takes out Hisuian Samurott, Quagsire, and Ogerpon-W for Tyranitar. Ogerpon-C can compensate for Glimmora's Ground weakness, and, after setup, it can eliminate Ursaluna-B, Dragonite, and Landorus. Glimmora aids Ogerpon-C by handling threats such as Kleavor when running Power Gem, Iron Valiant, and Hisuian Lilligant. Glimmora can further aid Ogerpon-C with Mortal Spin by removing entry hazards to help prevent Ogerpon-C's Sturdy from breaking. Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine is a strong wallbreaker that can deal with Corviknight, Clodsire, and Toxapex. Coalossal can serve as entry hazard control to allow Glimmora to drop Mortal Spin; it can additionally support the team with Spikes, facilitating Glimmora's cleaning. Coalossal also deals with Scizor, Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Corviknight. Glimmora returns the favor by threatening Clodsire and Toxapex, which can threaten Coalossal. Lead Kleavor can set up Stealth Rock and potentially break opposing Ceruledge's Focus Sash. In exchange, Glimmora eliminates physical walls like Quagsire and non-Air Balloon Heatran for Kleavor. Iron Defense Garganacl is a stallbreaker that can force progress with Salt Cure in matchups against defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra, and Galarian Slowking. Glimmora dispatches Choice Band Mamoswine after Stealth Rock, entry hazard chip and Urshifu-R, which can threaten Garganacl. Alolan Golem can trap and eliminate Steel-types like Scizor and Corviknight. Diancie can set up Stealth Rock while also OHKOing Chien-Pao with Body Press and Kommo-o with Moonblast if Glimmora is not running Dazzling Gleam.</p>"

It can make use of its solid coverage options and remarkable Special Attack to pose a noticeable offensive threat itself, especially against common entry hazard setters, removers, and other dedicated leads. Power Gem threatens the metagame's best Defogger in Tornadus-T, while Sludge Bomb dents screens setters such as Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko and—if Focus Sash is still intact—Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant as well, which can be problematic against offensive teams. Earth Power pressures Steel-types like Heatran, Gholdengo, and Kingambit that would otherwise block Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Energy Ball deals with other entry hazard setters and removers such as Great Tusk, Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Rotom-W. Focus Sash guarantees that Glimmora can set at least one layer of entry hazards, potentially letting Toxic Debris trigger twice as well. Tera Ghost is used in a pinch to spinblock foes such as Great Tusk and Excadrill and remove its Ground weakness to set up multiple entry hazards in the face of other setters like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gastrodon. Gholdengo is a near-mandatory teammate to keep up entry hazards by blocking every attempts to remove them, such as Defog and Rapid Spin. Setup sweepers like Kingambit, Volcarona, Dragapult, Dragonite, and Iron Valiant appreciate entry hazards wearing down foes such as Dondozo and Clodsire and not being chipped down by opposing ones themselves; particularly, Kingambit's Knock Off can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Volcarona to make them vulnerable to Glimmora's entry hazards.</p>"

Veluza can easily find setup opportunities against passive foes, such as Vaporeon, and Choice-locked foes, such as a Passimian that just used Close Combat. Although Veluza is extremely powerful after setting up, it may not always get the chance to do so due to its frailty. Veluza's defensive typing is also relatively poor; it is weak to common attacks, including pivoting moves like U-turn from Scyther and Volt Switch from Rotom. Furthermore, Veluza's speed and firepower are rather mediocre prior to setup.</p>",

          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Fillet Away is one of the best setup moves in the game, doubling Veluza's Speed and power at the cost of half its health. Aqua Cutter and Psycho Cut are both boosted by Sharpness, and after a Fillet Away will OHKO many neutral targets, such as Rotom, Mabosstiff, and Clawitzer. For Veluza's last move, Substitute can be used to ease prediction, facilitate setup, and avoid Sucker Punch. Aqua Jet can also be used to revenge kill weakened foes and, after setup, outprioritize other priority moves such as Lycanroc's Accelerock. Tera Blast is an option with Tera Fairy to blast past Cacturne, which otherwise completely walls it. Otherwise, Tera Water is good choice to further boost the power of Veluza's Aqua Cutter, giving it a guaranteed OHKO on specially defensive Umbreon after Stealth Rock. Sitrus Berry helps Veluza set up sucessfully, and 4 HP EVs ensure that it will activate after a Fillet Away. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize Veluza's damage output, but a Jolly nature enables Veluza to outspeed Timid Farigiraf prior to setup and Choice Scarf Zoroark post-setup.</p> <p>Veluza's incredible Speed and power after setup make it an excellent choice for hyper offense teams. Entry hazard support from Lycanroc and Qwilfish can help chip Veluza's checks into range of its attacks. Bulk Up Paldean Tauros is a great partner for Veluza, as it can easily switch into and set up against Pokemon that give Veluza trouble, such as Cacturne. In return, Veluza can set up on Pokemon used to revenge kill or force out Paldean Tauros, like a Choice Scarf Indeedee-F locked into Psychic or Psyshock. Paldean Tauros also helps Veluza break past shared walls in Vaporeon and Tera Water Sandaconda, enabling one of them to sweep late-game. Other good offensive partners to pair with Veluza include Jolteon and Quiver Dance Vivillon. Jolteon provides an Electric immunity for the team while also giving Veluza points of entry through Volt Switch. Vivillon threatens Cacturne, and its Sleep Powder may cripple one of Veluza's checks, allowing it to sweep. Indeedee-F is another good teammate for Veluza, as Psychic Terrain shields Veluza from priority attacks, such as Sucker Punch, while boosting the power of Psycho Cut to absurd levels.</p>"

Dondozo faces competition from Quagsire as the team's Unaware user, as Quagsire has an immunity to Electric-type attacks and can stack entry hazards; however, it drops to Grass-type attacks. Curse allows Dondozo to apply offensive pressure, boosting its attack and allowing it to better hit targets such as Baxcalibur and Kingambit while also allowing it to better tank hits in return. Rest allows Dondozo to shrug off status and gives it longevity, allowing it to constantly absorb powerful attacks for Water teams, such as Great Tusk's Headlong Rush. Sleep Talk enables Dondozo to further take advantage of Rest, allowing it to continue to setup or attack its target while asleep. Dondozo takes advantage of its STAB through the use of Waterfall, doing more damage, but Avalanche allows Dondozo to OHKO Meowscarada, as well as pressure Water-immune Pokemon such as Clodsire and Gastrodon. Its EV spread allows Dondozo to tank attacks from Gholdengo and Flutter Mane, due to its already high physical defense, which may be further boosted by Curse.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja is an insane wallbreaker, with coverage allowing it to take on a variety of Pokemon such as an opposing Dondozo or Ting-Lu with Grass Knot, Garchomp with Ice Beam, Amoonguss and Clodsire with Extrasensory, and Espathra with Dark Pulse.

Gastrodon can also stack Spikes or set Stealth Rock, wearing down foes for Dondozo. The defensive core of Dondozo, Toxapex, and Gastrodon also gives Water teams opportunities to scout powerful attacks by allowing for each to switch-in for another, such as Dondozo switching in for Gastrodon or Toxapex to tank Chien-Pao's Crunch. Earthquake also allows it to take on Poison- and Electric-type Pokemon such as Clodsire and Sandy Shocks. Quaquaval can remove hazards with Rapid Spin for Dondozo and offensive Quaquaval sets can take on common threats to Water teams such as Greninja after one Aqua Step or Meowscarada after two.</p>"

Due to its immense bulk, Dondozo is difficult to remove without adequate answers, easily sweeping through entire teams on its own.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dondozo performs best with offensive threats that can break apart teams for it and still function independently without needing to pivot. Examples include Chien-Pao and Dragonite, as well as Tornadus and a sweeper such as Urshifu-S or Flutter Mane. The two cores utilize strong speed control and get off massive damage early, allowing Dondozo to clean up. Glimmora is another excellent partner, as its ability and signature move put foes on a timer, forcing them to burn through Dondozo before fainting to Toxic poison.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dondozo struggles against Pokemon that can ignore its stat boosts, either by neutralizing or bypassing it entirely. Both Urshifu formes and Chien-Pao with Sacred Sword ignore Dondozo's Defense boost, with Chien-Pao both outspeeding and threatening Dondozo if it uses Tera Grass, and Urshifu-S dealing big damage with Wicked Blow and removing Dondozo's ability to stall with Protect. Incineroar and Gouging Fire are able to consistently weaken Dondozo with Breaking Swipe and Intimidate cycling respectively. A combination of Incineroar and Amoonguss is particularly difficult to handle, as Amoonguss can keep Incineroar safe with redirection and Incineroar is free to cycle Parting Shot and Intimidate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dondozo requires much more experience to properly play compared to other sweepers, due to only making plays with one Pokemon for most of the game. While its not impossible to play into certain difficult matchups, especially with a strong composition and much practice, it necessitates significant reads and good positioning of Dondozo to win.</p> </li> </ul>",

However, passivity and reliance on Rest for recovery limit its usefulness outside of incredibly defensive teams. Liquidation is Dondozo's STAB move of choice for its slightly higher Base Power increasing its odds of 2HKOing targets such as Heatran and Landorus-T after Stealth Rock, while Waterfall is appreciated for its higher PP. Curse aids Dondozo in taking even less damage from physical attackers while potentially turning it into a late-game wincon, while Body Press is an option to hit Water-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Urshifu-R, and Ogerpon-W. Rest is Dondozo's only option for recovery, while Sleep Talk allows Dondozo to damage Pokemon while asleep, preventing it from being completely passive. Heavy-Duty Boots  is the preferred item, ensuring Dondozo avoids damage from entry hazards and minimizing its need to use Rest. Leftovers are is an alternative on teams with fantastic entry hazard removal to grant it passive longevity. Fairy is the ideal Tera Type to resist Fighting-type attacks such as Close Combat from Zamazenta and Mega Medicham as well as Dark-type attacks such as Mega Gyarados and Hisuian Samurott's STAB moves. Dondozo fits best on bulky balance or stall teams that appreciate its unparalleled ability to check physical threats. Special walls such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, Gliscor, and Blissey check special attackers that Dondozo struggles with, such as Volcarona, Zapdos, and Rotom-W; the aforementioned Ground-types also provide an immunity to Volt Switch from Zapdos and Rotom-W, which Dondozo would otherwise grant free pivoting opportunities to. Solid Knock Off absorbers such as Gliscor and Tornadus-T pair well with Dondozo, as losing its item would open up to it taking entry hazard damage. However, if Dondozo opts to use Leftovers, Gliscor and Tornadus-T can act as Defoggers to alleviate entry hazard pressure. Electric Terrain offense teams trouble Dondozo by cutting off its recovery, so teammates such as Toxapex and Gliscor aid it against common threats on such teams, including Iron Valiant and Sneasler. On stall teams, Wish passers such as Alomomola and Clefable allow Dondozo to switch into such attackers and regain its lost HP.</p>"

Covert Cloak protects against secondary effects like confusion from Magical Torque and burns from Scald. Tera Fire allows Dondozo to resist Magical Torque and Grass-type moves from Arceus-Fire, and it maintains Dondozo's resistance to Fire-type moves such as V-create. Dondozo appreciates defensive teammates with typing synergy such as RegenVest Ting-Lu, which helps protect Dondozo from threatening Pokemon such as Eternatus.</p>"

Parting Shot allows Dondozo to maintain momentum against opposing threats such as Arceus-Ghost with its priority pivoting and attack stat reduction, making it easier for teammates such as Ting-Lu to take hits from them; alternatively, Flip Turn provides a pivoting option unaffected by Taunt, Dark-types, and Magic Bounce. Heavy-Duty Boots, notably eases Dondozo's pivoting, while Covert Cloak protects it from status conditions from moves such as Nuzzle, Mortal Spin, and Magical Torque.

Make sure to run at least 236 HP EVs when using Final Gambit to OHKO Hippowdon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb</strong>: Rock Tomb is an excellent Speed control option for its ability to punish Dragonite, Ogerpon-H, and Gouging Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt gives Annihilape a strong matchup into bulky support Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fling and Light Ball</strong>: This gives Annihilape a chance to paralyze a foe, including Gholdengo that lack Covert Cloak, and turn the tables on fast Focus Sash foes like Flutter Mane and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: If using Focus Sash, Close Combat's Defense drop isn't as devastating, though it leaves more offensive Annihilape vulnerable to getting revenge killed by multi-hit users like Urshifu-R and Loaded Dice Scale Shot foes like Dragonite, Gouging Fire, and Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore is an incredibly powerful move that can lock the opponent into an attacking move to boost Rage Fist's power. Alternatively, it can lock the opponent into a status move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curse</strong>: This is an excellent way for Annihilape to retire itself from the battle while putting significant pressure on the opponent to switch out and shutting down gimmicks such as Baton Pass.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Endeavor</strong>: When paired with Focus Sash, Endeavor lets Annihilape massive amounts of damage before going down, though Annihilape's own bulk can lessen its effectiveness.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This Annihilape is often used quite early in the game so Terastallization is often not needed unless it must check a specific threat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Beyond offering a valuable Fairy resistance, the Ice and Fire resistances make Chien-Pao, Ogerpon-H, and Chi-Yu easier to deal with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel has excellent defensive synergy with Annihilape thanks to the Fairy resistance and doing particularly well on spreads that are faster than -1 Chien-Pao to move before Sacred Sword lands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water lets Annihilape withstand Urshifu-R's Tera Water Surging Strike with any item on either Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison has a good matchup against Flutter Mane, and lets Annihilape deal with Toxic and Toxic Spikes without needing to Taunt or worry about Toxapex's Mental Herb.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Defiant</strong>: Defiant gives Annihilape the widest variety of winning match-ups, doing great against Intimidate Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Incineroar, punishing common Speed control foes like Rock Tomb Ogerpon-H, and ensuring that Charm Flutter Mane will not set up on Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: Vital Spirit adds to Annihilape’s flexibility against dangerous sleep inducers such as Yawn Ursaluna-B and Spore Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Inner Focus</strong>: This niche ability prevents flinches from Chien-Pao and Dragonite from happening, as well as stopping an Attack drop from Intimidate.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry can be used with specialized spreads to avoid certain 2HKOs and protect Annihilape from Urshifu-R's Tera-boosted Surging Strikes. Try to make sure to have an even HP stat, to ensure that Sitrus Berry activates after getting hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Even when using bulky EV spreads, Focus Sash is useful for surviving an attack from foes that can be difficult to EV for, such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Coba Berry</strong>: Coba Berry stops Tera Flying foes like Dragonite and Landorus-T from getting a surprise KO on Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roseli Berry</strong>: Roseli Berry works well on specially defensive EV spreads designed defeat Flutter Mane leads that lack Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Sitrus Berry EV Spread Examples</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 4 Atk / 4 Def / 36 SpD / 220 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread outspeeds Adamant Urshifu formes plus Timid Archaludon and Gholdengo, survives Jolly Choice Band Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes on all but the highest roll, and has a 87.5% chance of surviving Modest Choice Specs Archaludon's Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 140 Def / 124 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Thanks to Sitrus Berry, not even Adamant Choice Band Urshifu-R can OHKO Annihilape with Tera Water Surging Strikes! The Speed investment aims for Modest Gholdengo and Modest Archaludon, and also outspeeds up to Iron Bundle after a Speed drop from Rock Tomb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 4 Atk / 4 Def / 220 SpD / 36 Spe with Careful</strong>: This Sitrus Berry optimized EV usually avoids a OHKO from Choice Specs Gholdengo's Shadow Ball, while outspeeding Adamant Breloom.

The Special Defense EVs dodge a OHKO from Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Beyond at least reaching a speedtie with opposing Annihilape, this spread avoids a OHKO from Timid Flutter Mane's unboosted Moonblast and even outspeeds paralyzed Speed boosted Flutter Mane.

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thanks to great bulk and the dangerous Rage Fist, Annihilape is powerful bulky set-up sweeper of Battle Stadium Singles.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt helps you deal with annoying support Pokemon like Whirlwind Ting-Lu, Thunder Wave Archaludon, and Hippowdon to mention a few, forcing them to attack and boost Rage Fist. This can work on Toxapex, but be warned that Toxapex commonly carries Mental Herb, which could get Annihilape poisoned if it doesn't Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore is an interesting alternative to Taunt, not able to directly shut down defensive answers to Annihilape, but it severely punishes them when Annihilape switches into a support move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Defiant versus Vital Spirit</strong>: Defiant is the best option for this set, stopping Charm Flutter Mane from eeking out a win, and punishing common ways of dropping Annihilape's Attack such as Intimidate Landorus-T and Breaking Swipe Gouging Fire. Vital Spirit is easier to stop, but, it lets Annihilape can absorb sleep moves from foes like Yawn Ursaluna-B, Yawn Hippowdon, and Spore Breloom without needing Taunt.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization is quite helpful at saving Annihilape from certain extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Flutter Mane, but Annihilape is perfectly functional without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison offers a better matchup against Flutter Mane, does well against Meowscarada's Flower Trick, and lets Annihilape freely switch into Toxic and Toxic Spikes later in the match. This also drastically reduces the risk of Taunting Toxapex, which makes this Tera type a menace against stall teams!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: In addition to giving a useful resistance to Fairy, Fire, and Ice attacks from dangerous foes like Flutter Mane, Ogerpon-H, and Chien-Pao, Tera Fire also protects Annihilape from burns.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a fantastic response to Urshifu-R, who otherwise can use Tera Water Surging Strikes to break through Annihilape regardless of Bulk Up boosts. It also works great against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, two powerful wallbreakers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel turns Annihilape's Psychic , Flying,and Fairy weakness into resistances, as well as being an excellent defensive type overall. It lets Annihilape deal with foes like Flutter Mane, Latios, and Iron Crown far more effectively at the cost of having issues with Ogerpon-H and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying is an effective Tera against stall teams for avoiding Fissure from Dondozo , forcing it to attack with moves that boost Rage Fist.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's residual recovery eases the long-game of setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs</strong>: Reducing the HP EVs to 244 gives Annihilape an even HP stat, which lets Annihilape recover its health with Sitrus Berry the moment it gets hit by Ruination. This makes dealing with Ting-Lu and Wo-Chien an easier task.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak makes Annihilape immune to being Salt Cured, making it a great check against Garganacl if using Taunt to prevent the deadly Tera Ghost Curse. It also gives peace of mind, avoiding potential flinches from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, or Special Defense drops from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximum Speed mainly helps Annihilape outspeed Timid Archaludon, Timid Gholdengo, Adamant Urshifu formes, and Modest Chi-Yu. The 4 Special Defense EVs are just enough to avoid being OHKOed by Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 244 SpD / 12 Spe with Careful</strong>: More special bulk can make it much more difficult for special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu to revenge kill Annihilape. This spread in particular has a 62.5% chance of surviving Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 164 Def / 100 SpD with Careful</strong>: This EV spread avoids an OHKO from +2 Chien-Pao, which can be especially helpful with Covert Cloak blocking the flinch chance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 SpD / 100 Spe with Careful</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom while still giving Annihilape good special bulk.</p> </li> </ul>"

Its fantastic defensive typing allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes and nets it nice resistances to Fighting and Fairy, letting it check a unique combination of threatening offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W. To aid in checking them, it runs Toxic to put these Pokemon on a timer, stalling with Recover as poison damage increases. When they're inevitably forced to switch, their replacement takes damage too since Clodsire sets Stealth Rock or Spikes, racking up even more damage. Leftovers can be used to help preserve Recover’s PP and stay in longer, while Heavy-Duty Boots helps Clodsire switch in and out to wall threats. Earthquake, besides providing direct damage, super effectively damages Pokemon that can't be poisoned like Gholdengo and other Clodsire. Terastallization gives Clodsire much more defensive flexibility as well; Tera Water can help it resist powerful STAB moves from Dondozo and Azumarill which would otherwise scare it out. Tera Flying is another useful option, turning its Ground weakness into an immunity while preserving its Fighting resistance, allowing it to stay in against Great Tusk and Focus Sash Breloom.</p> <p>Clodsire fits neatly into plenty of balance or stall teams looking for a way to handle special hits, offering support with both setting up hazards and removing Toxic Spikes, and walling sweepers with Unaware. Other hazard setters in particular love stacking hazards alongside it; since it learns both Stealth Rock and Spikes, it can fit with many options, like Spikes Meowscarada or Stealth Rock Garganacl. However, its mediocre Defense and weaknesses to Ground and Ice leave it particularly vulnerable to the the tier's physical wallbreakers, most notably Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Garchomp. As such, Clodsire greatly appreciates having teammates who can check these Pokemon and easily switch into Earthquake or Icicle Crash like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Tera Water Garganacl. In particular, Clodsire is completely stonewalled by Hatterene and Air Balloon or Tera Flying Gholdengo. The former reflects both Toxic and entry hazards while overpowering its healing with Psyshock, and the latter is immune to Toxic via Good as Gold, even if it loses its Steel typing. Great teammates to help check these two are Gholdengo itself for Hatterene, which threatens Hatterene with Make It Rain and its unpredictable set versatility, and Kingambit for opposing Gholdengo, which resists both of Gholdengo's STAB moves and can immediately threaten to OHKO it back. In turn, these two appreciate Clodsire checking the Fire-types that scare them out, especially Iron Moth and Skeledirge. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Dondozo can check the Water-type threats Clodsire fears, like Floatzel and Azumarill.</p>"

Spikes are preferred on Clodsire, as the move has more limited distribution and Clodsire enters the field commonly enough to have the opportunity to use the move. However, Stealth Rock can be used if Clodsire's team requires it. Toxic is used to cripple common switch-ins to Clodsire, such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Great Tusk. Poison Jab can be used to poison post-Tera Gholdengo attempting to remove its Ground weakness, and it forces damage on Tornadus-T faster. Heavy-Duty Boots are preferred on Clodsire to negate its weakness to opposing Spikes teams, although Leftovers are also viable to increase Clodsire's longevity. Unaware is preferred over Water Absorb to negate Clodsire's passivity against setup sweepers, and Water Absorb does little to help against the likes of Mega Swampert and Gastrodon. Tera Dark grants Clodsire a Ghost resistance, which helps against Choice Specs Dragapult and Gholdengo, especially if using Poison Jab against the latter. It also grants Clodsire with a Pursuit resistance against the likes of Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar, which can both exploit its physical frailty. Clodsire fits best on defensively oriented teams that appreciate its special walling and entry hazard support. As Clodsire is weak to most physical attackers such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Dragonite, teammates that can cover them, such as Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Buzzwole, make for good partners. In return, Clodsire can switch into Electric-type attacks for the former, and powerful special attackers such as Dragapult for the latter two. Pokemon that benefit from Spikes support, such as Tornadus-T and Gholdengo, also pair well with Clodsire, as Spikes puts pressure on checks to them such as Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar. In return, Clodsire appreciates these teammates being able to make more immediate progress. Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Tornadus-T as well as Weavile and Mega Scizor pair well with Clodsire, crippling Heavy-Duty Boots users such as opposing Clodsire and Toxapex, giving Clodsire's entry hazards support a greater impact.</p>"

Poison Jab hits threats like Meowscarada, Rotom-C, and Iron Valiant, while Gunk Shot provides more power against bulkier foes such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Toxic Spike eases the Dark and Fairy matchups due to their lack of entry hazard removal and applies pressure on teams in general, completing Ground's entry hazard stacking core. Toxic may be used instead to punish Pokemon like Rotom-W and Hydreigon, which freely switch-in to Clodsire otherwise. The given EV spread avoids the 2HKO from both Choice Scarf Greninja's Ice Beam and Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Flower Trick.</p> <p>Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu appreciate Clodsire checking the aforementioned Water-types as well as other threats such as Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane. In return, Choice Scarf Great Tusk pressures Ice- and Dark-types like Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Choice Specs Greninja. Iron Treads clears entry hazards and threatens Hatterene, and Ting-Lu sets up entry hazards and switches into Psychic-type attacks from Espathra and Indeedee.

Spikes lets Clodsire take advantage of forced switches and synergizes well with Glimmora, Toxapex, and Skuntank, all together forming Poison's entry hazard-stacking core.

Amoonguss can also run Growth, which helps in the Ground matchup, while Toxapex also chips down the opposing team by setting Toxic Spikes and wearing down threats like Chien-Pao with Infestation, Baneful Bunker, and Rocky Helmet. Skuntank is a Psychic-immune teammate that switches into Hatterene, Espathra, and Indeedee, and it can set Toxic Spikes better against types like Fairy and Psychic by trapping switch-ins such as Klefki and Bronzong with Fire Spin. Glimmora provides entry hazard support and removal with Stealth Rock and Mortal Spin, respectively, and it can run Air Balloon or Choice Scarf to handle Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads due to its great coverage. Glimmora can also run Corrosion with Toxic and Mortal Spin, improving the Poison matchup and putting defensive Pokemon such as opposing Clodsire and Amoongus on a timer. Iron Moth is another plausible Choice Scarf user, as it handles Steel- and Dragon-types like Iron Treads and Baxcalibur, though it can also run a set with Substitute to handle Kingambit and break down types such as Flying and Water better.</p>"

Spikes and Toxic Spikes give Clodsire a way to exert offensive pressure, alongside Earthquake which punishes Miraidon and Zacian-C on switch-in. Poison Jab can be used over Toxic or Toxic Spikes to potentially punish Taunt variants of Arceus-Fairy, but it is generally outclassed by the other options.

Tera Steel flips Clodsire's weakness to Ice- and Psychic-type attacks such as Kyogre's Ice Beam and Calyrex-S's Psyshock, while making Clodsire more reliable into Miraidon's Draco Meteor. Tera Dark makes Clodsire weaker to Arceus-Fairy and Miraidon, but checks Calyrex-S without a Fighting- or Fairy-type move, as well as Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Clodsire's ability to both absorb Toxic Spikes and check various special attackers gives it a niche on balance and stall teams. Clodsire pairs well with physical walls such as Gliscor, Toxapex, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, as they can check Koraidon, physical variants of Arceus formes, and Zacian-C. Secondary special walls such as Blissey are appreciated to ease the burden on Clodsire against Calyrex-S, Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, and Kyogre. Wo-Chien also checks these threats and helps against Dragon Dance variants of Arceus-Ground. Arceus is another partner for Clodsire that can pivot into Calyrex-S on balance teams, and appreciates Clodsire setting Spikes and clearing Toxic Spikes for it.</p>"

      "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Farigiraf's excellent bulk combined with the immunity to Prankster Taunt and Fake Out given by Armor Tail ability make Farigiraf an extremely consistent Trick Room setter. This is because its ability prevents Farigiraf from being taunted by the main Taunt user in the format, Tornadus, and the opponent can no longer use Fake Out to stall out Trick Room turns. Additionally, Armor Tail gives Farigiraf a great matchup against Pokemon that rely on priority like Rillaboom and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p>The different Ogerpon formes are all great partners for Farigiraf, because the redirection means Trick Room is almost guaranteed to go up, while their Grass typing means that Spore is no longer an issue. Ogerpon-W has a great defensive typing and can easily tank most hits it redirects away from Farigiraf, Ogerpon-H hits Amoonguss and the Steel-types that resist Farigiraf's moves, and Ogerpon-C is particularly helpful for redirection due to its Sturdy ability. Rillaboom and Incineroar are also great partners, as Fake Out + Trick Room is a great combination due to the fact that Fake Out prevents both opponents from attacking Farigiraf before Trick Room goes up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Partners that are physically frail or weak to one of the big priority moves like Urshifu-R really enjoy having it as an ally. Flutter Mane is an excellent partner, as it can handily deal with the Dark-types that Farigiraf struggles against, and Ursaluna-B is a strong Trick Room sweeper that enjoys being immune to the Fake Out cycling from Incineroar and Rillaboom.</p> </li> <li> <p>Farigiraf can have a difficult time against Pokemon that can threaten to OHKO it both in and out of Terastallization, like Kingambit and Urshifu-S. Another issue is opposing Trick Room Pokemon, especially Torkoal and Amoonguss, the former being able to outspeed Farigiraf inside of Trick Room and OHKO it with Tera Fire-sun-boosted Eruptions, and the latter being able to put any Farigiraf that isn't running Safety Goggles to sleep and just being a general threat when Trick Room is up.</p> </li> </ul>",

Imprison is used to block opposing Trick Room while also stopping opposing Flutter Mane from using Dazzling Gleam. Protect is just a generally consistent option, allowing Farigiraf to stick around to provide the team with priority blocking for longer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sitrus Berry is generally preferred, as the extra recovery allows it to live important attack combos such as Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash into Entei's Sacred Fire; however, Safety Goggles is also a valid option, allowing it to ignore Spore from opposing Amoonguss, a common counter to Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p>With Sitrus Berry recovery, Farigiraf can always survive an Icicle Crash from Adamant Chien-Pao and a Sword of Ruin-boosted Sacred Fire from Entei.

Sitrus Berry and Cud Chew allow Farigiraf to shrug off a majority of neutral attacks in the tier, greatly improving its survivability to grant Farigiraf the two turns of setup that it needs. The other alternative to Sitrus Berry is Cud Chew + Lum Berry, giving Farigiraf status immunity for 2 turns, which could allow Farigiraf to set up on the likes of Glare Sandaconda and Toxic or Thunder Wave Qwilfish. The Speed EVs let Farigiraf outspeed neutral-natured Clawitzer &amp; positive Speed-natured Cacturne and Ursaring at +0 while outrunning Choice Scarf Bruxish after an Agility, with the rest of the EVs being invested into Special Attack for maximum damage output. Dazzling Gleam is often preferred over Tera Blast for the ability to hit Dark-types without needing to Terastallize. Tera Fairy is very useful for its Dragon Tail immunity against Eelektross and Appletun, and turns Farigiraf's weaknesses to Dark and Bug into resistances, and also boosts Dazzling Gleam. Sap Sipper can also complement Tera Fairy to completely blank Appletun's dual STAB combination, with Cacturne and Lurantis being bonus setup targets. Armor Tail can be considered to stop priority moves from Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Bruxish while turning Sableye into setup fodder. Farigiraf can also use Calm Mind and a bulkier spread to set up more reliably on weaker special attackers such as Abomasnow, Raichu, and non-Trick Rotom. With Tera Steel, Farigiraf is able to better take on common Haze users like Articuno, Cryogonal, and Hisuian Qwilfish, hitting the former two super effectively with Tera Blast and gaining an immunity to the latter's Poison-type attacks.</p> <p>Farigiraf's low Speed often mandates using Agility first and also means it generally cannot threaten the opponent until turn 3, as it takes two turns to set up Agility followed by Nasty Plot. Strong teammates that can apply quick and immediate pressure on the opponent make for good partners, such as Tauros, Hisuian Sneasel, and Rotom. Pokemon that can also handle Farigiraf's checks and counters, namely Dark-types and Haze users, are especially appreciated. Nasty Plot + Taunt Houndoom and Trick Rotom or Haunter can bait out defensive responses such as Umbreon, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Blissey in order to cripple them. A double Psychic core involving Farigiraf and either Bruxish or Mesprit can also work to wear down their shared checks and prevent them from answering one or the other. Rest Sandaconda can shrug off attacks from Umbreon and Hisuian Qwilfish while even smacking the latter with Earthquake. Hisuian Sneasel and Toxicroak can threaten Umbreon and Hisuian Qwilfish, whereas Magneton, Pyroar, Houndoom, and Perrserker can switch into Haze Cryogonal and Articuno to apply offensive pressure. Scyther, Bombirdier, Magneton, and Perrserker can force out the opponent's less defensive Pokemon and pivot to give Farigiraf a window of opportunity to set up, with Bombirdier being particularly notable due to its access to Parting Shot and Memento. Abomasnow can provide Aurora Veil support for Farigiraf to make setting up easier.</p>"

Kingambit's typing also allows it to be, at the very minimum, a one-time switch-in to very threatening Pokemon to the offensive teams it usually sees play in, like Flutter Mane.</li> <li>Unfortunately, the prevalence of Tera Fairy in the metagame means that Sucker Punch will, most of the time, be resisted.

          "description": "<p>Kingambit is the premier offensive Pokemon in OU, with potent wallbreaking and sweeping potential thanks to its high Attack bolstered by Supreme Overlord and Swords Dance. It has excellent natural bulk and the ability to Terastallize to either maximize damage output or gain defensive advantages against its checks. Its strong Sucker Punch makes it one of the best anti-offense tools in the metagame. Kingambit can use Kowtow Cleave for a more consistent Dark-type attack than Sucker Punch. Iron Head gives coverage against Dark-resistant Pokemon, notably Clefable, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta. Low Kick can be used over Kowtow Cleave or Iron Head to beat opposing Kingambit, although dropping Iron Head for Low Kick leaves Kingambit walled by Fairy-types, while dropping Kowtow Cleave leaves Kingambit walled by Skeledirge and Toxapex and stuck with the less reliable Sucker Punch as its only Dark-type move. Kingambit's item slot is very flexible depending on the needs of the team; Black Glasses is the best item on Kingambit to stack with Supreme Overlord and potentially Tera Dark; Air Balloon can be used to gain setup opportunities on Ground-types like Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Landorus-T; Lum Berry is an option to absorb otherwise crippling status from Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Dragapult, and Cinderace; and Heavy-Duty Boots is an option on teams with either no or unreliable entry hazard control to keep Kingambit from being worn down by Spikes early-game. Tera Dark powers up Sucker Punch and Kowtow Cleave while removing Kingambit's weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-type moves. In combination with Black Glasses and +2 Attack, it allows Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave to OHKO physical walls such as Alomomola, Gliscor, and Garganacl. Additionally, Kowtow Cleave 2HKOes Dondozo, while +2 Sucker Punch OHKOes Roaring Moon, opposing offensive Kingambit after Spikes, and Hisuian Samurott. Tera Flying allows Kingambit to set up on Ground- and Fighting-types such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Zamazenta. Tera Fighting can be used with Low Kick to always OHKO defensive Great Tusk at +2 with five Supreme Overlord boosts and a layer of Spikes, and it can 3HKO Dondozo with five Supreme Overlord boosts. Tera Fighting also provides more setup opportunities than Tera Dark, with the advantage of shedding Kingambit's weakness to Fighting-type attacks. Adamant is preferred to maximize the power of Sucker Punch to break through bulky Pokemon. Jolly can be run over Adamant to win the Low Kick Kingambit mirror matchup against Adamant variants and outspeed some variants of IronPress Skarmory and Corviknight before they can boost Defense. However, the power drop from losing out on Adamant limits Kingambit in all other matchups, especially when Sucker Punch nullifies Adamant's speed drop anyway; Jolly Kingambit cannot OHKO Dragapult with Sucker Punch unboosted, and even with five Supreme Overlord boosts, it cannot 3HKO Dondozo without Black Glasses or Tera Dark.</p> <p>Kingambit fits on offensive and bulky offense teams that appreciate its defensive profile and capabilities as a revenge killer and late-game sweeper, being able to defensively check non-Focus Blast Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Weavile without Low Kick. Offensively, Kingambit can revenge kill a wide range of Pokemon, including Deoxys-S, Dragapult, and Kyurem while also being able to revenge kill anything without Substitute, Encore, or strong neutral priority, given enough chip damage. Roaring Moon is an excellent partner for Kingambit, overloading Dark-resistant foes and physical walls for each other and paving the way for one of them to break through and end the game. On bulky offense teams, Spikes setters like Skarmory and Gliscor synergize well with Kingambit. Spikes Gliscor in particular provides a highly valuable and resilient Ground immunity and Fighting resistance, and its Toxic also synergizes with Sucker Punch, helping to ease prediction by putting opposing Pokemon on a turn limit. On offensive teams, hazard setters such as Glimmora, Deoxys-S, and Hisuian Samurott help Kingambit break through foes that resist its moves, especially Great Tusk variants without Heavy-Duty Boots, which can be forced to take hazard chip early on. Kingambit can also be used alongside dual screens Deoxys-S and Alolan Ninetales, making it easier to set up and providing a highly valuable Dragapult check to the dual screens team. Rillaboom can support Kingambit with Grassy Surge, giving it easier setup opportunities with extra HP and weakening Earthquake from Gliscor, Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu. Rillaboom can also switch into Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, and Dondozo and remove Rocky Helmet from Skarmory and Corviknight with Knock Off. Galarian Slowking appreciates Kingambit resisting Ghost- and Dark-type attacks aimed at it. In return, it supports Kingambit with Future Sight to break through Great Tusk, Zamazenta, Dondozo, Alomomola, and Skarmory while also switching into Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Zamazenta for Kingambit. Gholdengo is a great teammate for Kingambit, being able to handle threats like Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Skarmory, Corviknight, Substitute Iron Boulder, and Dondozo while checking Rillaboom and Dragonite, which can punish its Sucker Punch with priority. It also softens opposing teams for Kingambit to finish off using Gholdengo's own wallbreaking capabilities and excellence in keeping entry hazards on the field. Volcarona is another excellent partner for Kingambit, countering Skarmory, Zamazenta without Stone Edge, and Iron Valiant. It also sometimes punishes other Kingambit checks in Great Tusk, Low Kick Weavile and Meowscarada, and Dragonite with Flame Body, turning them into setup fodder for Kingambit.</p>"

However, without Iron Head, Kingambit struggles with the matchup against Fairy-types. Kingambit makes good use of both Leftovers to increase its longevity late-game and Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid entry hazard damage and continue switching in to keep pressure on. Tera Flying gives Kingambit a resistance to Fighting and an immunity to Ground, allowing it to set up on Great Tusk and Landorus-T, whereas Tera Fairy not only assists Kingambit defensively by giving it a Fighting resistance and a good defensive spread but also gives it access to Tera Blast Fairy to add to its coverage. 44 Speed EVs make Kingambit faster than Blissey, and the remaining 212 EVs not invested in Attack are put into HP, increasing its bulk. Alternatively, Kingambit's HP EVs can be raised to increase bulk, dropping Speed down to 4 EVs, which outruns uninvested Iron Hands, Ursaluna, and Azumarill.</p> <p>Bulky Kingambit is excellent on offense and balance teams as both a powerful late game setup sweeper and a form of speed control. Alongside more passive bulky Pokemon, such as Gliscor and Skarmory, Kingambit helps the team make more progress and break through tougher threats; in return, they can chip down Great Tusk with Toxic or Rocky Helmet damage. These Pokemon also set up entry hazards, which assist with wallbreaking. Slower teams appreciate the priority Kingambit provides, and Pokemon like Gholdengo and Kyurem also appreciate Kingambit's ability to switch into Dragon- and Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult and opposing Gholdengo. Great Tusk can weaken Gliscor, Landorus-T, and opposing Great Tusk for Kingambit while also being able to  remove Skarmory's Rocky Helmet with Knock Off. In return, Great Tusk appreciates bulky Kingambit being able to switch in on Pokemon like Hatterene and Clefable that force Great Tusk out. Kingambit benefits from teammates with the ability to pivot and get it in safely, such as Meowscarada and Galarian Slowking. Galarian Slowking also supports Kingambit by setting up Future Sight, which is difficult for foes to switch in on at the same time as Kowtow Cleave, as it forces special and physical damage on the same turn; only Dark-types resist both, and they struggle to take Kingambit's coverage moves. Kingambit in turn helps Galarian Slowking by resisting Dark and Ghost and switching in on Gholdengo and Dragapult. Kingambit can form a Dark-type spam core with Roaring Moon or Weavile, as they can assist in beating down Dondozo, Skarmory, and Great Tusk. Rillaboom helps Kingambit by removing its Earthquake weakness and providing passive recovery from Grassy Terrain. Due to its lower special bulk, Kingambit can be vulnerable to wallbreakers like Volcarona and Walking Wake. Having teammates more suited to taking hits from such Pokemon, like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex, is a good solution. Combining Kingambit's power with the power of Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo is another way to boost a team's wallbreaking potential. Gholdengo's ability allows it to keep hazards up, helping Kingambit keep pressure up. Both Pokemon defensively check Pokemon that threaten the other; Gholdengo checks Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, while Kingambit checks Ghost-types like Dragapult and other Gholdengo. Iron Valiant and Kingambit both have powerful speed control and support each other by weakening their shared checks, like Gliscor and Volcarona. Kingambit is also useful against Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo, which Iron Valiant forces in.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Kingambit is a potent wallbreaker and sweeper on Dark teams, having an excellent secondary typing, great stats, and an amazing ability to tie it all together. Swords Dance allows Kingambit to capitalize on its already great Attack stat, letting it threaten defensive walls such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Corviknight. Making up for its lack of Speed, Sucker Punch fits perfectly on Kingambit. In tandem with three boosts from Supreme Overlord, Sucker Punch OHKOes Flutter Mane; it also OHKOes Volcarona after Swords Dance in tandem with two Supreme Overlord boosts. Kowtow Cleave is a reliable heavy-hitting STAB attack, and Iron Head hits Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Supreme Overlord is one of Kingambit's main selling points, allowing it to 2HKO Specially Defensive Corviknight and almost always 2HKO Quagsire after Stealth Rock. The Speed EVs allow Kingambit to outspeed both Corviknight and Skeledirge, both which otherwise can threaten Kingambit with Body Press and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Leftovers are used to support Kingambit's solid defensive stats, giving it a form of recovery.</p> <p>Kingambit functions as an excellent late-game sweeper, making use of its ability and setup potential; thus, Kingambit greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Ting-Lu to pressure offensive teams who lack hazard removal. Greninja and Hydreigon cover physically defensive walls, hitting Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Amoonguss that Kingambit would otherwise struggle with. Sableye provides an important Fighting-type immunity to make up for Kingambit's typing. Skuntank can be used in combination with Kingambit to ease the Fairy-type matchup and set Toxic Spikes, chipping foes and making it easier for Kingambit to sweep late-game. Chien-Pao and Meowscarada help make up for some of Kingambit's type weaknesses. Chien-Pao can hit Ground-types such as Garchomp and Great Tusk. Meowscarada can make use of Choice Scarf combined with Play Rough to hit Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant while also hitting Ground- and Water-types such as Quagsire.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Kingambit serves as one of the best attackers for the Steel type, boasting impressive physical bulk and monstrous Attack, and the latter gets boosted further by Supreme Overlord and Swords Dance. Its base 50 Speed leaves something to be desired but is supplemented by Sucker Punch. Kowtow Cleave allows it to break through walls that don't resist it such as Skeledirge, which poses a major complication for Steel teams, as well as 2HKOing Quagsire if all teammates have fainted. Sucker Punch can allow Kingambit to defeat threats like Barraskewda and Flutter Mane, which can massively threaten Steel teams. Iron Head damages Pokemon that don't mind Sucker Punch or Kowtow Cleave, such as Ting-Lu or Azumarill. Alternatively, Brick Break destroys dual screens and OHKOes other Kingambit trying to take its STAB moves. 140 Speed EVs allow Kingambit to outspeed walls such as uninvested Skeledirge and Corviknight. Black Glasses boosts its Dark-type moves to dangerous levels without it having to set up Swords Dance, but Leftovers may be used to increase Kingambit's survivability. Chople Berry has a niche in allowing Kingambit to survive Fighting-type moves such as Chien-Pao's Sacred Sword, while Heavy Duty Boots helps it pivot in and out to exert pressure on the opponent without getting chipped.</p> <p>Scizor's U-turn safely pivots Kingambit in to wallbreak while dealing substantial chip damage; also, its Bullet Punch deals with threats to Kingambit such as Chien-Pao and Iron Valiant, and Close Combat allows it to check threats such as Iron Treads and Ting-Lu. Gholdengo is an excellent partner to freely switch into Fighting-type moves and Will-O-Wisp. Corviknight serves as a potent check to Chien-Pao and clears entry hazards to increase Kingambit's longevity, Magnezone breaks through bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo, and it preserves momentum through Volt Switch. Iron Treads serves as another hazard clearer, can set up Stealth Rock to chip any walls Kingambit wants to break through, and can serve as speed control with a Choice Scarf. Klefki sets up dual screens, which allow Kingambit to use Swords Dance far more easily. Tinkaton can wall any Fairy-type moves meant to chip or finish off Kingambit, such as Flutter Mane's Moonblast, and KO many of their users with Gigaton Hammer. Orthworm's Shed Tail can be used with Kingambit to great effect, allowing it to freely use Swords Dance and threaten to sweep the opponent's team.</p>"

The EV spread outpaces neutral nature Tyranitar and uninvested Brambleghast while maximizing Great Tusk's physical bulk.</p> <p>Assault Vest Iron Hands is a great partner to Great Tusk, sponging special hits aimed at it while also threatening Pokemon such as Choice Specs Pelipper and Hatterene. Iron Hands also appreciates Great Tusk's ability to keep entry hazards off the field so it doesn't get worn down. Wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant and Breloom appreciate Great Tusk's ability to threaten Poison-types such as Clodsire and Skuntank, allowing them to continue rampaging against the opponent. Due to it being an amazing special attacker, Iron Valiant in particular can threaten physical walls like Quagsire, Sableye, and Dondozo, which like to switch into Great Tusk. Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo, Quaquaval, and Slither Wing pressure special attackers faster than Great Tusk such as Choice Specs Greninja, Dragapult, and opposing Iron Valiant. Gallade is also a really nice partner to handle Pokemon such as Amoonguss, who would otherwise beat Great Tusk one-on-one, thanks to its Psychic STAB attacks.</p>"

Close Combat lets Great Tusk hit threats such as Arceus-Dark and Ursaluna hard, while Stealth Rock lets Great Tusk compress the roles of hazard setter, wallbreaker, and hazard remover. Tera Dark is used to bolster Knock Off and grant Great Tusk an immunity to Psychic-type moves from the likes of Deoxys and Mewtwo, letting it punish them with a super effective Knock Off. Tera Water can instead be used to grant Great Tusk a resistance to Palafin's Water moves and Arceus-Fire's Flare Blitz. Hazard-weak wallbreakers, such as Chi-Yu and Kyurem-W, appreciate Great Tusk removing hazards for them; in exchange, they target the physical walls that Great Tusk loathes. Kyurem-W in particular forms an excellent offensive core with it, being able to offensively pressure its checks such as Giratina and Lugia. Arceus-Dark also makes a good partner for Great Tusk, as it covers Great Tusk's weakness to special attackers while also enjoying hazards being removed.

Bulk Up can allow Great Tusk to use its amazing bulk to sweep weakened teams, and Stealth Rock allows it to provide even more utility to its team in the form of entry hazard support. Knock Off allows Great Tusk to hit incoming Psychic- and Ghost-types that try to block Rapid Spin, notably Mewtwo, Deoxys, and Giratina, while also providing greatly helping its team by removing a foe's item. Rapid Spin allows Great Tusk to remove hazards, which enables Pokemon like Kyurem-W and Chi-Yu, while also boosting its Speed, potentially allowing it a shot at sweeping the opposing team. Tera Steel is the best defensive Tera type for Great Tusk, as it flips its many weaknesses into resistances, such as Fairy, Psychic, and Ice, which helps against Pokemon like Baxcalibur, Zacian and Deoxys. Tera Ground is also good to remove its Psychic and Fairy weaknesses against Pokemon like Mewtwo and Zacian while also boosting Earthquake. Most strong special attackers will beat Great Tusk, such as Mewtwo and Palkia-O; therefore, it mostly pairs well with special walls, such as Blissey and Arceus-Dark. Great Tusk also has a very strong synergy with Wish passers like Alomomola and Clefable, as they vastly increase its longevity as it has due to it having no natural recovery outside of Leftovers. Great Tusk is an excellent check to Pokemon like Urshifu-S and Kingambit due to its great typing and bulk, which can enable teammates like Magearna and Kyurem-W.</p>"

Earthquake can be used over Headlong Rush to have a strong STAB without drawbacks, but the power difference is noticeable. Stealth Rock can be used over Close Combat if the team lacks a Stealth Rock setter, but leaves Great Tusk unable to dent Rotom-W and Ting-Lu. Rapid Spin is essential, since it both boosts Great Tusk's Speed and clears entry hazards, which it won’t have a hard time doing against common hazard setters like Landorus-T and Garchomp.

Tera Water lets it emergency check Urshifu-R, while Tera Ground lets it deal large amounts of damage with Headlong Rush against Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Volcarona.

Great Tusk hates having to deal with Zapdos and Moltres due to being threatened by Static and Flame Body, so Pokemon that can deal with them, such as Tapu Koko and Mega Tyranitar, are appreciated.

Ice Spinner lets it break past Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Landorus. Rapid Spin acts as a secondary boosting move for Great Tusk, alleviating its mediocre Speed tier and allowing it to sweep undeterred. The given EV spread allows Great Tusk to outspeed Ogerpon-W after a Rapid Spin boost, with the rest used to maximize its physical bulk. Tera Poison prevents Great Tusk from being hit by Toxic while providing crucial resistances to Fairy- and Fighting-type attacks. Tera Electric provides a Flying resistance, allowing Great Tusk to use Zapdos and Tornadus-T as setup fodder while also preventing it from getting paralyzed by Static. Tera Steel combines the Flying resistance from Electric with the Fairy resistance and Toxic immunity from Poison while adding on a Psychic resistance at the cost of being weak to Fighting. Due to its relatively low Speed tier even after a boost, Great Tusk will need help against revenge killers like Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, so Pokemon that can handle the two, such as Mega Scizor, Slowking-G, and Heatran, are appreciated. A more offensive set utilising Booster Energy can also be used on hyper offense teams, but it is generally less effective compared to other choices.</p>"

Knock Off can cripple foes by removing their items, which is great against a lot of Pokemon, as it gets rid of annoying items such as Heavy-Duty Boots, Leftovers, and opposing Covert Cloak from Pokemon such as Garganacl, opposing Great Tusk, and Skeledirge. Rapid Spin is a potent utility move that allows Great Tusk to remove entry hazards from the user's side, while Spikes is an alternative to Rapid Spin, as it allows Great Tusk to set up hazards of its own if the user's team already has reliable hazard removal. Shore Up is a good recovery move, as it gets powered up by sand, and Great Tusk can use it often due to its decent Speed and bulk. Covert Cloak is the best item choice for Great Tusk, as it allows it to shrug off secondary effects from moves like Mortal Spin, Thunderous Kick, and Salt Cure without getting punished.

It can comfortably set up on common physical walls like Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, Corviknight, and defensive Great Tusk.</li> <li>The STAB combination of Headlong Rush and Close Combat hits most physical walls for at least neutral damage. Earthquake may be used as the Ground-type STAB move to avoid defensive drops, but it is a weaker move, and it can't secure important OHKOs and 2HKOs at +1 Attack against some physical walls such as Toxapex, Scream Tail, and Alomomola.</li> <li>A Jolly nature is used to outspeed all viable unboosted Pokemon after one Rapid Spin. An Adamant nature makes Great Tusk stronger while still letting it outspeed unboosted Iron Bundle at +1 Speed, but it misses out on outspeeding maximum Speed Gholdengo and tying Jolly Great Tusk.</li> <li>Terastallizing into the Ground typing boosts Headlong Rush and guarantees some additional OHKOs and 2HKOs on foes like Toxapex and Scream Tail. Additionally, getting rid of the Fighting typing lets Great Tusk survive Fairy-type attacks such as Dazzling Gleam from Miraidon and Moonblast from Flutter Mane without Life Orb or Choice Specs, and it facilitates taking Dazzling Gleam and Play Rough from Scream Tail and Alomomola.</li> <li>Alternatively, using Tera Steel gives Great Tusk resistances to Fairy-type attacks, Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle, and Draco Meteor from Miraidon, allowing it to surprise them with a strong attack.</li> <li>Koraidon is a solid partner because its sun activates Great Tusk's Protosynthesis, making its attacks even stronger. In return, Great Tusk can break through or strongly dent common Koraidon checks like Scream Tail, Alomomola, and Skeledirge, which allows Koraidon to clean more easily. Miraidon is also an excellent teammate, since Great Tusk can easily hard switch into its common checks and either threaten them with its attacks or set up on them.</li> <li>Special attackers like Miraidon, Flutter Mane, and Iron Bundle hugely threaten Great Tusk, so it is recommended to pair it with appropriate special walls like Blissey, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Clodsire. Gothitelle is a less popular pick but it helps eliminate bulky checks like Dondozo and Pelipper, allowing Great Tusk to sweep more easily.</li> </ul>"

Knock Off can be used to take on Air Balloon Gholdengo and wear down foes that want to switch into Great Tusk such as Corviknight and Annihilape, but it is generally outclassed by the sheer utility of Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock. The combination of Knock Off and Body Press can be used to pressure Corviknight switch-ins.</li> <li>Bulk Up is an option to boost alongside opposing Great Tusk and Swords Dance Kingambit and Koraidon.</li> <li>Great Tusk can Terastallize into the Fairy typing to take on physical attackers such as Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and Palafin in sun. However, be wary of Terastallizing against Koraidon that can still Terastallize themselves, as Choice Band Tera Fire Koraidon can take on Great Tusk one-on-one. Great Tusk can also Terastallize into the Ground typing or the Water typing, with both options removing its weakness to Fairy. The former also lets it fire off stronger Earthquakes as well, while the latter provides useful resistances to Fire moves from Koraidon as well as Ice- and Water-type moves, barring Freeze-Dry, from Iron Bundle.</li> <li>Great Tusk fits on most teams as a bulky Stealth Rock setter and Koraidon check. Great Tusk can utilize Rocky Helmet to punish the use of U-turn, though this hurts its longevity, as it then loses Leftovers's passive recovery.</li> <li>Great Tusk pairs well with defensive Scream Tail and Blissey, both of which can take on Iron Bundle while also providing Wish support for Great Tusk. Blissey can also take on Chi-Yu and Miraidon, while Scream Tail can take on Iron Valiant.</li> <li>Great Tusk also pairs well with Gholdengo, as it appreciates Great Tusk forcing out Koraidon while preventing hazard removal in exchange. Choice Scarf Chi-Yu is a good partner due to its ability to pressure faster special attackers that trouble Great Tusk such as Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane. Great Tusk also pairs well with Miraidon, as non-Heavy-Duty Boots Miraidon appreciates it removing entry hazards and taking on Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Ting-Lu. Finally, Koraidon is a good partner, as it can set up sun, pivot into Great Tusk, and force out most hazard removal options besides opposing defensive Great Tusk.</li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Bulk Up Great Tusk with Booster Energy's Speed boost is a potent physical setup sweeper that is capable of providing valuable utility to its team, as its access to Rapid Spin and its natural bulk allows it to check key threats such as Dragonite, Kingambit, and Gouging Fire. Bulk Up leverages Great Tusk's natural bulk to give it setup opportunities against many of the common physical attackers in the tier, such as Kingambit and Zamazenta. Headlong Rush is a brutally powerful option for a Ground-type STAB move and is not weakened by Grassy Terrain. Alternatively, Earthquake can be run if Headlong Rush's low PP and Defense drops prove to be problematic, but misses out on benchmarks like the potential OHKO on Dragapult and Iron Valiant at +1. Ice Spinner allows Great Tusk to hit Grass- and Flying-types such as Serperior, Gliscor, and Enamorus for super effective damage, which would otherwise wall it or force it out. The last moveslot can be Close Combat for a strong Fighting-type STAB move, guaranteeing the OHKO on bulky Kingambit, threatening huge damage on Kyurem and Ting-Lu, and punishing switch-ins like Skarmory and Corviknight with heavy damage; Rapid Spin, which lets it remove hazards and provides it with further boosts to its Speed, preventing otherwise faster threats like Deoxys-S and Booster Energy Iron Valiant from revenge killing it; or Knock Off, which deals with Air Balloon Gholdengo as well as crippling its checks like Dondozo. The EV spread listed is necessary for Great Tusk to attain a Speed boost from Protosynthesis from Booster Energy; however, Leftovers can be used instead should Great Tusk be used on sun. Tera Poison is the premier defensive Tera type for Great Tusk, allowing it to set up on Gliscor's Toxic and completely wall Rillaboom and Zamazenta alongside avoiding a KO and thus granting it an extra turn against Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Conversely, Tera Ice is a strong choice for an offensive Tera type that provides Great Tusk with STAB on Ice Spinner, which can net OHKOs on Gliscor and offensive Zapdos after a boost from Bulk Up. Tera Steel can also be considered as an alternative to Tera Poison that also lets Great Tusk wall Choice Band Dragapult and Dragon Dance Kyurem, at the cost of being weaker into Cinderace, Zamazenta, and Low Kick Kingambit. Additionally, both Tera Ice and Steel provides an Ice resistance against foes like Weavile and Meowscarada.</p> <p>Great Tusk is commonly seen on offense, hyper offense, and sun structures, which appreciate its entry hazard control and ability to clean teams in late-game scenarios. Great Tusk particularly struggles against physical walls such as Skarmory, Corviknight, and Dondozo. On sun teams, strong special attackers such as Raging Bolt and Walking Wake can easily force these Pokemon out and can soften up the opposing team for Great Tusk to sweep in the mid- or late-game. In return, Great Tusk provides key hazard control and switches into powerful physical threats such as Kingambit. Additionally, it can easily shatter common checks to both Walking Wake and Raging Bolt, particularly Clodsire and Galarian Slowking. Hatterene on sun teams and Choice Scarf Enamorus on weatherless offense can support Great Tusk with Healing Wish and can threaten some of its checks, notably Gliscor, Deoxys-S, and Zamazenta. Hatterene also alleviates the need for Great Tusk to run Rapid Spin, freeing up the last moveslot for more offensively oriented options such as Close Combat and Knock Off. Outside of sun, Rillaboom provides Great Tusk with passive recovery without relying on Leftovers and can force out or KO the likes of Primarina and Dondozo. In return, Great Tusk can act as a mid- or late-game sweeper once the opposing team is sufficiently weakened and can threaten Pokemon such as Archaludon that Rillaboom struggles against. Volcarona and Dragonite appreciate the utility of Great Tusk's Rapid Spin and its ability to consistently threaten Skeledirge. In exchange, Volcarona can act as a reliable check to Weavile and Iron Valiant, while Dragonite can handle opposing Volcarona and Ogerpon-W. Lastly, Kingambit enjoys having Great Tusk beating its checks like opposing Great Tusk one-to-one with its own setup, allowing it to more easily sweep late-game.</p>"

        "Offensive Utility": {
          "description": "<p>Great Tusk is a great Pokemon in the OU metagame due to its role compression, entry hazard removal, offensive and defensive typing, and bulk, enabling it to check a variety of top-tier threats like Kingambit, Gliscor, and Gholdengo. It is the best hazard remover in the tier and can threaten common hazard setters and spinblockers such as Landorus-T, Glimmora, and Dragapult. Headlong Rush OHKOes offensive Kingambit and is not weakened under Grassy Terrain unlike Earthquake. Do be aware of the drawbacks though; lowering both of Great Tusk's defenses opens it up to an OHKO from Weavile's Triple Axel. Ice Spinner hits Flying-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor and Dragon-types like Dragonite and Hydrapple. Knock Off disrupts foes that switch in and makes progress by removing items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots. Temper Flare can be used over this to ease prediction against Air Balloon Gholdengo. If it attempts to block Rapid Spin, Temper Flare's power doubles next turn, enabling Great Tusk to OHKO it. Temper Flare also serves as strong coverage in general if used under sun. Rapid Spin provides hazard removal while boosting Great Tusk's Speed. Heavy-Duty Boots makes Great Tusk's job of removing hazards easier, as it ignores the chip damage as well as the Speed drop from Sticky Web, allowing it to switch in more times to make progress. Leftovers is an alternative option, giving Great Tusk healing over time. However, it leaves Great Tusk weak to hazard chip, potentially resulting in it taking massive damage on switch-in and being poisoned. Booster Energy can be used on more offensive teams that care less about longevity, making it easier for Great Tusk to remove hazards thanks to its stronger offensive presence. This EV spread gives it an Attack boost in sun or when running Booster Energy. Tera Ground powers up Headlong Rush, allowing it to OHKO maximum Defense Gholdengo, and it also keeps Great Tusk's Electric immunity. Tera Steel can help Great Tusk check Gliscor by providing it with an immunity to Toxic, and it can 2HKO Gliscor with Ice Spinner without being chipped. Tera Steel gives Great Tusk a multitude of resistances that were prior weaknesses, like Fairy, Psychic, Grass, and Ice, which helps it to check Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Weavile. Tera Fire also gives it notable resistances to Fairy, checking Iron Valiant, and Grass, resisting Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. It also provides a burn immunity, which helps check Cinderace.</p> <p>Great Tusk works well on offensive structures due to its entry hazard removal capabilities, which can help teammates weak to them come in more easily; it also guarantees progress with Knock Off. If used on sun teams, Great Tusk helps support the Stealth Rock-weak Torkoal, enabling it to switch in and set sun more times, as well as being a potent wallbreaker itself with the power boost it gets in the sun. Great Tusk pairs well with Choice-locked wallbreakers and Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Enamorus, Kyurem, and Gouging Fire, as they appreciate the hazard removal so they can switch in more reliably. Great Tusk also pairs well with Kingambit, as the hazard removal lets it run Leftovers for more longevity or an offensive item like Black Glasses to hit harder. Great Tusk struggles to repeatedly switch into attacks, as it doesn't have access to passive recovery other than Leftovers, which can be removed, and the offensive nature of this set means it doesn't take hits well. Ogerpon-W is a good partner for Great Tusk, as it provides a Water immunity and benefits from Great Tusk's hazard removal to switch in more frequently. In return, Great Tusk's Ice Spinner threatens the Dragon-types that Ogerpon-W struggles with. Great Tusk is generally weak to special attackers thanks to its measly Special Defense. Partners like Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Primarina can patch up this weakness by checking special threats like Iron Valiant and Volcarona, and their typings synergize well with Great Tusk. In return, Great Tusk's hazard removal lets them wall these threats more consistently.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its gargantuan Defense in tandem with a plethora of utility options and a great defensive typing, Great Tusk makes for a premier defensive presence, checking notable threats like Kingambit, Gouging Fire, and Dragonite. Stealth Rock, in tandem with Rapid Spin, makes Great Tusk a dominant choice for entry hazard control, being able to threaten Pokemon immune to Rapid Spin like Gholdengo and Dragapult with Earthquake or Knock Off while also being able to set up Stealth Rock in the face of aforementioned physical threats. Alternatively, Bulk Up makes Great Tusk more consistently able to check foes like Choice Band Roaring Moon, Iron Boulder, Choice Band Zamazenta, and especially Kingambit. Knock Off punishes common switch ins like Corviknight, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Zapdos and breaks through Ghost-types like Dragapult. Alternatively, Ice Spinner provides solid coverage for Flying- and Ground-types like Gliscor, Enamorus, and Tera Flying Kingambit. 36 Speed EVs lets Great Tusk outspeed Jolly maximum Speed Kingambit. Tera Water provides Great Tusk means of resisting Water-type attacks from the likes of Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott while also removing its weaknesses to Fairy and Flying. Alternatively, Tera Steel turns its weaknesses to Grass and Ice into resistances, giving Great Tusk stronger utility against the likes of Meowscarada, Serperior, and Rillaboom. Leftovers gives Great Tusk better longevity, while Heavy-Duty Boots bolsters Great Tusk's role as hazard control.</p> <p>Great Tusk fits best on balance and bulky offense teams as a premier choice for entry hazard control, in addition to acting as a strong check towards the likes of Kingambit and Gouging Fire. Pokemon that heavily benefit from hazard removal, namely Raging Bolt and Gouging Fire, heavily appreciate Great Tusk's capability of shedding entry hazards with ease while being able to take advantage of the Water- and Grass-type Pokemon that threaten Great Tusk. Air Balloon Gholdengo poses a major threat to Great Tusk without Knock Off, as it can otherwise switch in with ease and overwhelm Great Tusk with Shadow Ball. As a result, Kingambit makes for a solid partner to Great Tusk thanks to its strong ability to check non-Focus Blast Gholdengo, as well as Serperior, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Defensive Great Tusk also doubles as a solid Kingambit answer, meaning that Pokemon that would otherwise be overwhelmed by Kingambit such as Dragapult and Gholdengo make for solid partners. The latter also blocks attempts at removing Stealth Rock from the likes of Corviknight and opposing Great Tusk.</p>"

Body Slam is notably difficult to switch into due to its paralysis chance. Rapid Spin removes entry hazards and turns Great Tusk into a major threat by letting it outspeed nearly the entire metagame, only losing to Chien-Pao and Deoxys-S. Bulk Up turns it into a fearsome setup sweeper that can even beat non-setup Corviknight, while Ice Spinner hits opposing Greak Tusk and common Pinsirite users like Garganacl and Iron Boulder. The given EV spread allows Great Tusk to outspeed a Aerilate Dragonite, survive Adamant Aerodactylite Gouging Fire's +1 Flare Blitz, and OHKO Tough Claws variants of Gouging Fire with Headlong Rush. Great Tusk's incredible offensive and defensive utility means it often warrants itself on a variety of offense and faster balance teams, and so allows it to have a wide range of suitable partners. Pokemon that appreciate its ability to keep hazards off the field while being offensive menaces like Urshifu-R, Red Orb Raging Bolt, and Hisuian Arcanine warrant themselves as strong partners. Allies that resist Water- and Ice-type moves like Arceus-Water, Alomomola, and the aforementioned Red Orb Raging Bolt are also good teammates, being able to switch into or force out threats like Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao while having their own utility in the form of pivoting, hazards, status, setup, and Wish passing. Electric-types like Sandy Shocks and Raikou that can punish Flying-types like Corviknight and Pinsirite Garganacl that attempt to take advantage of Great Tusk's inability to dent them are also notable. Likewise, non-grounded, Flying-resistant Pokemon like Latiasite Magearna and Solgaleo that would otherwise wall Great Tusk can be accounted for with partners like Lunala, Scizorite Weavile, Flare Blitz Gouging Fire, and Red Orb Raikou.</p>"

Body Press, when coupled with maximum Defense investment, deals consistent damage to Corviknight, while Ice Spinner can be used to hit Flying-type switch-ins like both Zapdos formes and Dragonite. Knock Off debilitates switch-ins like Corviknight and Zapdos by removing their Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots, respectively. Alternatively, Great Tusk can use Stealth Rock if none of its teammates are capable of setting it. Bulk Up can also be considered to increase Great Tusk's offensive presence, but is typically less preferred than other utility options. Scrappy notably prevents Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Pecharunt from spinblocking Great Tusk. Alternatively, Regenerator provides Great Tusk with reliable recovery it otherwise lacks, while Fluffy allows it to better check attackers such as Roaring Moon and allows a teammate like Swampert to use Regenerator instead. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures Great Tusk can more reliably remove entry hazards by avoiding chip damage from them, while Leftovers provides recovery for non-Regenerator sets, and Rocky Helmet can be used to punish attackers that make contact. Offensive Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards off the field such as Azelf and Chien-Pao pair well with Great Tusk's Rapid Spin support. Due to its poor special bulk, Great Tusk appreciates specially bulky Pokemon, such as Heatran, Empoleon, and if not using Regenerator, RegenVest Pokemon such as Manaphy and Swampert. Certain physical wallbreakers such as Chien-Pao and Galarian Zapdos are significant threats to Great Tusk, so it appreciates a secondary physical wall capable of checking these Pokemon such as Corviknight or Skarmory.</p>"

Headlong Rush helps deal with Poison-types like Pecharunt and Iron Moth as well as being Great Tusk's best option against Fairy-types like Scream Tail. Scrappy + Rapid Spin grants Great Tusk hazard removal that's not blocked by Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Pecharunt. Scrappy also notably enables Great Tusk to turn Intimidate Corviknight into setup fodder. Hazard-weak Pokemon such as Chien-Pao, Ceruledge, and Ogerpon-H appreciate Great Tusk's role as a spinner; in return, they can help threaten physically defensive checks like Fluffy Corviknight and Deoxys-D, making it easier for it to set up. Due to its mediocre Special Defense, Great Tusk is forced out by common threats such as Azelf, Deoxys-S, and Walking Wake, making specially defensive teammates such as RegenVest Swampert, Meloetta, and Manaphy necessary.

Close Combat threatens Ice- and Dark-types such as Baxcalibur, Hydreigon, and Hisuian Samurott as well as OHKOing walls like Celesteela, Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Rotom-W with the aid of Fightinium Z after a Bulk Up boost, easing the Steel matchup for Great Tusk's team. Earthquake hits Pokemon like Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Toxapex, while Ice Spinner nails Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Zapdos, allowing Great Tusk to boast unresisted coverage in combination with Close Combat. Rapid Spin allows Great Tusk to gain a Speed boost to easily snowball against slower teams and remove entry hazards for teammates; however, Knock Off is great for Air Balloon Gholdengo and weakened Slowbro as well as generally forcing progress against teams by removing their items. Gastrodon and Clodsire are essential teammates for Great Tusk due to their immunities to Water-type attacks, letting them fend off Barraskewda, Urshifu-R, and Keldeo. Gastrodon also has an appreciated neutrality to Ice-type attacks, letting it check Choice Scarf Weavile, and Clodsire is neutral to Grass-type attacks, letting it wall Meowscarada. It can also wall Fairy-types like Tapu Koko, Tapu Fini, and Iron Valiant. Furthermore, Gastrodon and Clodsire provide chip damage via Toxic and entry hazards, wearing down walls like Slowbro, Swampert, and Mantine that give Great Tusk a hard time. Landorus forms a potent wallbreaking core with Great Tusk, breaking Slowbro, Dondozo, and Mandibuzz as well as offering Gravity, letting Great Tusk more easily spam Earthquake. In return, Landorus appreciates Great Tusk threatening Ice Shard users like Mamoswine and Baxcalibur. Mega Steelix is an excellent teammate, as it fights off Azumarill, Weavile, and Alolan Ninetales, making it a huge asset in the Fairy and Ice matchups. Ting-Lu forms an entry hazard-stacking core with Gastrodon and Clodsire, wearing down teams exponentially faster with the help of Whirlwind. Additionally, Ting-Lu switches into attacks from revenge killers like Blacephalon, Latias, and Hisuian Zoroark. Mamoswine appreciates Great Tusk breaking Celesteela and Corviknight; in return, Mamoswine utilizes Thick Fat to fight the aforementioned Ice-types and provides speed control with Choice Scarf, outpacing Mega Diancie, Enamorus, and Tapu Koko.

Its defensive typing and high Speed make it a good answer to Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Walking Wake. Dazzling Gleam is this set's only attacking move, letting it hit Pokemon like Great Tusk, Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Iron Valiant and prevents it from being shut down by Taunt from Pokemon like Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Greninja. Wish gives Scream Tail a recovery move while letting it heal teammates such as Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Hatterene that lack reliable recovery and are vulnerable to being overwhelmed by repeated hits. Protect synergizes well with Wish, making it much more reliable as a recovery move. Additionally, Protect scouts the intentions of Choice-locked Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Hisuian Zoroark. Encore prevents setup sweepers like Volcarona, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Bulk Up Great Tusk from using Scream Tail as a setup opportunity, letting Scream Tail's teammates switch in and take advantage of these threats. It can also be used to annoy passive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Dondozo. Tera Fairy gives Scream Tail better matchups against Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Hisuian Zoroark, with the former two being susceptible to being OHKOed by Dazzling Gleam. Alternatively, Tera Water lets Scream Tail maintain a solid defensive typing while also helping it check Walking Wake, Skeledirge, and Greninja. With a Timid nature, 152 Speed EVs let Scream Tail outspeed Hydreigon, while 236 Special Defense EVs ensure that Scream Tail gets a Special Defense boost with Protosynthesis under sun, letting it more easily take on threats such as Walking Wake and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 84 SpD / 172 Spe with a Calm nature lets Scream Tail outspeed unboosted Great Tusk and pass beefier Wishes.</p> <p>Scream Tail fits on many sun, balance, and stall teams thanks to its bulk, ability to pass Wish to teammates, and create momentum with Encore.

Moreover, Toxapex also checks Pokemon like Iron Moth and Glimmora as well as spread status, making Encore much more of a detriment to setup sweepers like Volcarona and Iron Valiant, while Dondozo blanket checks physically oriented Pokemon that can overwhelm Scream Tail, namely Booster Energy Roaring Moon and Ceruledge. Entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Corviknight make for excellent teammates, as a lack of hazards means that Scream Tail can accomplish feats such as surviving two Choice Specs Greninja Hydro Pumps from full HP. Additionally, Great Tusk appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Scream Tail answers such as Kingambit. Torkoal is a great teammate thanks to its sun activating Scream Tail's Protosynthesis. In addition, Torkoal very much appreciates Wish support in order to more consistently check Pokemon like Kingambit. Meanwhile, Scream Tail is able to sponge special attacks from the likes of Walking Wake. Under sun, Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Ceruledge, and Brute Bonnet appreciate Scream Tail facilitating their sweeps with its combination of Encore and Wish, keeping them healthy while leveraging setup opportunities for them. Hydreigon is another excellent offensive partner, checking Gholdengo and finding more opportunities to set up Substitute thanks to Scream Tail's Wish.</p>"

          "description": "<p>A blend of a great Speed stat and solid mixed bulk, combined with great utility options and an interesting defensive typing, Scream Tail a solid niche in the tier, allowing it to check dangerous threats such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham. Wish and Protect provide Scream Tail with recovery, with the latter also scouting Choice-locked Pokemon such as Dragapult and Kartana. Dazzling Gleam punishes Great Tusk and Iron Valiant and prevents them from freely exploiting Scream Tail. Encore pairs excellently with Scream Tail's high Speed, allowing it to shut down setup sweepers such as Urshifu-R, Cresselia, and Garchomp for its teammates to defeat. Leftovers provides Scream Tail with recovery that makes it less susceptible to being exploited by Wish, granting Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Heatran free switches. The given EVs maximize Scream Tail's bulk while allowing it to outspeed Enamorus and shut down Calm Mind variants with Encore. An alternative spread of 120 HP / 236 SpD / 152 Spe can be used to outspeed Hydreigon while receiving a Special Defense boost in Mega Charizard Y's sun, further amplifying Scream Tail's bulk and allowing it to check Charizard under sun. Tera Steel grants a resistance to Ice- and Fairy-type attacks from Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant in a pinch, while Tera Fairy ensures Scream Tail resists Pursuit from Weavile and Mega Tyranitar and increases the power of Dazzling Gleam to potentially 2HKO and OHKO Garchomp and Iron Valiant, respectively. Scream Tail fits best on defensively oriented teams that appreciate its unique defensive attributes while being able to support it sufficiently in return. Pokemon with unreliable recovery such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Assault Vest Toxapex appreciate Scream Tail's high-HP Wishes, while in return they check Pokemon Scream Tail struggles with such as Mega Scizor and Volcarona. Due to its reliance on Protect and Leftovers for passive recovery, entry hazard control from teammates such as the aforementioned Great Tusk and Tornadus-T can help mitigate its recovery. Scream Tail's passive nature means it can be exploited by Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, so Pokemon that aid against them while providing a more dangerous presence such as Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Swords Dance Gliscor pair well with it.</p>"

Stealth Rock takes advantage of the switches that Scream Tail forces against Pokemon like Great Tusk, chipping down walls for itself and its teammates to break through them, while Calm Mind provides it with opportunities to sweep late-game once Pokemon like Iron Moth and Heatran have been removed. Wish can help Scream Tail and its teammates like Great Tusk and Iron Hands that lack reliable recovery options restore HP. Protect lets Scream Tail scout out Choice-locked foes like Azelf, Deoxys-S, and Roaring Moon and recover HP safely with Leftovers or Wish. Scream Tail has a hard time breaking through stout specially defensive Pokemon like Swampert, Meloetta, and Manaphy without Calm Mind, making it appreciate offensive partners like Hisuian Electrode, Roaring Moon, and Iron Boulder. Scream Tail is very susceptible to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Iron Boulder and Barraskewda, which makes it appreciate having teammates that can offer it a defensive backbone like Fluffy Corviknight and Skarmory. Scream Tail can also appreciate Knock Off users like Roaring Moon and Empoleon, which can remove items like Assault Vest and Heavy-Duty Boots from Manaphy and Zapdos respectively.

Mystical Fire hits Steel-types such as Klefki and Iron Treads. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to punish specially defensive switch-ins like Dragalge, Blissey, and Clodsire. Flutter Mane can run Power Gem to pressure Fire teams, OHKOing foes like Volcarona and Torkoal, and it also benefits from Protosynthesis allowing it to outspeed Scovillain under the sun. Additionally, Flutter Mane usually goes with either Thunderbolt or Energy Ball. Both are useful against Water teams, with the former helping against Toxapex and Pelipper while the latter deals with Gastrodon and Quagsire. Choice Specs further enhances Flutter Mane's wallbreaking power, allowing it to overwhelm foes such as Ting-Lu after some chip damage.</p> <p>On Fairy teams, Flutter Mane is a menacing wallbreaker that excels at taking down slower foes such as Hydreigon, Skeledirge, and Corviknight. When paired with Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane forms an offensive core that's able to alternate between Fairy-, Ghost-, and Fighting-type STAB to take down a wide range of enemies. Flutter Mane can handle Psychic-type foes such as Espathra and Hatterene, while Iron Valiant takes care of Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Flutter Mane can fall back on either Hatterene or Tinkaton when faced with an unfavorable matchup. Both of these Pokemon provide dependable defensive options and some type of entry hazard control, but Hatterene is particularly useful due to it breaking down walls like Dondozo and Clodsire. Flutter Mane also pairs well with setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Mimikyu, as it is able to poke holes in the opponent's team, allowing them to clean late-game. In return, Azumarill can take care of priority users, such as Ceruledge and Chien-Pao. In terms of support options, Flutter Mane can rely on Fairy's Prankster users, Klefki and Grimmsnarl, to set up dual screens, therefore allowing it to withstand hits such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Grimmsnarl can then bring in Flutter Mane relatively safely thanks to Parting Shot. Klefki's Spikes and Tinkaton's Stealth Rocks also support Flutter Mane in breaking its checks such as Iron Hands and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard stacking proves particularly useful against less bulky teams, as it highly limits their capacity to scout Flutter Mane without having to sacrifice a member in the process.</p>"

        "Choice Scarf (Ghost)": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is an incredibly potent revenge killer and late-game cleaner thanks to its strong STAB combination, solid coverage options, and blazing Speed tier. Notably, it outspeeds faster Pokemon like Dragapult, boosted threats such as Baxcalibur and Quaquaval, and Choice Scarf users like Greninja and Meowscarada, all of which can threaten the offensive teams that Flutter Mane is part of. Mystical Fire threatens Steel-types such as Corviknight and Iron Treads, while Psyshock revenge kills Choice Scarf Iron Moth and hits specially bulky Pokemon like Clodsire. Thunderbolt pressures Corviknight better and 2HKOes physically defensive Toxapex after Stealth Rock, while Energy Ball takes care of Gastrodon.</p> <p>Spikes from the likes of Brambleghast and Froslass are terrific support options, chipping down bulky foes like Toxapex and Ting-Lu that would otherwise switch into Flutter Mane freely. Thanks to Good as Gold blocking Defog and its Ghost-typing, Gholdengo is a notable partner to keep Spikes up. Brambleghast also helps threaten Gastrodon and provides Rapid Spin support as well. Wallbreakers like Mimikyu and Gholdengo can pressure the opposition early-game, allowing for Flutter Mane to clean up late-game with ease; moreover, Mimikyu can overwhelm Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads with Drain Punch, while Gholdengo can make use of Trick to cripple walls like Clodsire and Corviknight. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Swords Dance Ceruledge are valuable teammates that function as back-up late-game cleaners, especially against types Flutter Mane can struggle with such as Poison and Steel. Moreover, Ceruledge and Mimikyu have the added benefit of safely revenge killing opposing fast threats Flutter Mane can't handle easily, like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Dragon Dance Dragapult, with Shadow Sneak. Skeledirge is a notable partner to compensate for Flutter Mane's lack of physical bulk, taking on Bullet Punch users like Scizor and Lucario as well as being fantastic in the Steel, Fighting, and Bug matchups.</p>"

        "Bulky Choice Specs (Fairy)": {
          "description": "<p>Bulky Choice Specs Flutter Mane serves as a strong specially offensive wallbreaker that can survive one hit from most unboosted physical attacks, such as Ting Lu's Heavy Slam and Baxcalibur's Icicle Crash, with relative safety. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to break through most Poison cores on its own with proper hazard support, most notably 2HKOing Clodsire, which otherwise walls it. Alternatively, Mystical Fire lets Flutter Mane break through defensive Steel-types like Iron Treads and and surprise more offensive Steel-types like Scizor behind Reflect, while Energy Ball targets would-be Rock-, Water-, and Ground-type walls like Garganacl and Gastrodon. The given EVs let Flutter Mane outspeed Spectrier, always survive +1 Dragonite's Earthquake, and almost always win the one-on-one matchup against Ting-Lu by having a 15/16 chance to survive its Heavy Slam and a 78% chance to 2HKO it with Moonblast in return after Leftovers recovery, using the minimum HP and Defense EVs possible.</p> <p>Bulky Choice Specs Flutter Mane takes advantage of its unexpected bulk to create surprise KOs, such as versus Dragon Dance Dragonite, while retaining its ability to remove key threats like Skeledirge, Corviknight, and Galarian Slowking. For this reason, setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Calm Mind Hatterene are strong partners, as they can take advantage of the holes that Flutter Mane creates in defensive cores. Iron Valiant is another strong partner, as it can take advantage of both the specially defensive Pokemon that Flutter Mane may not be able to remove, such as Hisuian Goodra, Alolan Muk, and Heatran, while creating a generally strong offensive core. As Flutter Mane is slower than Chien-Pao and opposing Flutter Mane, Choice Scarf Pokemon such as the Enamorus and the aforementioned Iron Valiant are necessary to handle these threats. Choice Scarf Enamorus in particular is a strong partner, as it can reduce the necessity of Flutter Mane on the field while threatening its own powerful late-game cleanup with Contrary Superpower, supporting its team with Healing Wish, and using Iron Head to KO opposing Flutter Mane after hazard chip; it also has the added benefit of having a stronger matchup versus Choice Scarf Meowscarada than Iron Valiant. On the other hand, Choice Scarf Iron Valiant is more immediately threatening with a Choice Scarf, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Iron Moth and Gengar, Chlorophyll Scovillain, and Slush Rush Cetitan, and OHKO threats that Enamorus could only dream of removing, such as Ice Shard Chien-Pao. Flutter Mane also struggles versus Steel-types like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Choice Scarf Iron Treads, so support from Klefki and Tinkaton, along with offensive checks like Azumarill, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus, allows Flutter Mane to break through these cores much more reliably. The Poison-type matchup is particularly difficult, so Steel-types like Klefki and Tinkaton and Magic Bounce support from Hatterene help Flutter Mane, as they can provide hazard support while blocking or punishing Toxic Spikes. In return, Flutter Mane can pressure Clodsire and Galarian Slowking and chip Alolan Muk by capitalizing on the lack of switch-ins to the combination of Psyshock, Moonblast, Shadow Ball, and entry hazards.</p>"

        "All-Out Attacker (Ghost)": {
          "description": "<p>Heavy-Duty Boots Flutter Mane is a potent offensive pivot and revenge killer, taking advantage of its immunity to entry hazards to stay out of KO range from priority moves such as Swords Dance Urshifu-R's boosted Aqua Jet and Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak as well as bluff Choice Scarf to surprise foes with the ability to switch between moves. Moonblast threatens Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Darkrai, and Walking Wake. Energy Ball hits Ground- and Water-type foes such as Mamoswine, Dondozo, Gastrodon, and Quagsire. Thunderbolt nails Water-types like Pelipper, Toxapex, and Empoleon, allowing Flutter Mane to threaten every Water-type Pokemon super effectively in tandem with Energy Ball. Furthermore, Thunderbolt wards off Flying-types such as Corviknight and Moltres. The given EV spread permits Flutter Mane to take a Shadow Sneak from Life Orb Mimikyu, easing the Ghost matchup.</p> <p>Gholdengo is an excellent teammate, as it takes advantage of Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon like Sneasler, Empoleon, and Amoonguss for Nasty Plot setup, while in return Flutter Mane threatens Ground-types such as Sandy Shocks and Gastrodon. Focus Sash Ceruledge is a really good wallbreaker against Steel and Dark teams, easily taking out Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit. Colbur Berry Spectrier excels in the Poison and Fighting matchups, weakening shared checks like Assault Vest Iron Hands and specially defensive Toxapex using Will-O-Wisp as well as takes out potential revenge killers like Choice Scarf Roaring Moon with Draining Kiss. Additionally, Choice Scarf Spectrier is great in the Ghost mirror matchup, threatening Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Flutter Mane, appreciating Flutter Mane removing Dark-types like Hydreigon and Darkrai in return. Brambleghast and Froslass provide Spikes setup to push Flutter Mane's targets into OHKO ranges, while the former also applies additional pressure on Water and Ground teams. Skeledirge wears down teams by spreading Will-O-Wisp and bypassing Substitute with Torch Song, walling and shutting down setup Pokemon such as Zamazenta and Iron Hands. Hisuian Zoroark provides a Ghost-type immunity, switching into attacks from opposing Ceruledge and Flutter Mane as well as providing utility via Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off, weakening physical attackers that Flutter Mane is vulnerable to such as Clodsire, Corviknight, and Poison Jab Toxapex and rendering foes susceptible to Spikes. Dragapult provides utility via Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, hindering threats like Chien-Pao and opposing Flutter Mane. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Dragapult removes other Choice Scarf users like Meowscarada and Roaring Moon.</p>"

It also heavily disrupts enemy special attackers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Power Gem</strong>: Power Gem gets a bit of extra damage against Fire-types like Ogerpon-H and Incineroar, which can be relevant when using Tera Stellar.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Calm Mind + Substitute is a classic duo that greatly assists Flutter Mane's setup attempts, allowing it to set up in-front of Thunder Wave Porygon2. Even without Calm Mind, it can save Flutter Mane from devastating uses of Thunder Wave from the likes of Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is hugely disruptive against a variety of support Pokemon, such as Swampert, Ting-Lu, and Porygon2.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Stellar Tera Blast</strong>: With Tera Stellar, Tera Blast can be some good insurance against Pokemon with unpredictable Terastallization options, but the Special Attack drop doesn't gel well with Booster Energy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draining Kiss</strong>: When using extremely bulky Flutter Mane variants, Draining Kiss can be paired with Calm Mind to keep it around much longer.

The main drawback is that Flutter Mane can only run one attack, usually Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calm Mind</strong>: Booster Energy sets can still make great use of Calm Mind. It is possible to get free setup turns thanks to full paralysis, but be aware that this is more of an occasional bonus than a consistent strategy to rely on.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Flutter Mane's high Speed and support options allow it to disrupt with ease.

Flutter Mane also has the important niche of being one of three viable Fairy-types, which is key in letting it switch into the myriad of strong Dragon-type moves in the tier.</li> <li>Flutter Mane pairs best with Koraidon, as Koraidon sets up sun to boost Flutter Mane's Speed and also uses U-turn to pivot it into Pokemon such as Skeledirge, Groudon, and Landorus-T. Both Flutter Mane and Koraidon also wear down Arceus-Fairy and Toxapex for each other, making them a very potent core. Flutter Mane also pairs well with Kyogre, as they both pressure a similar subset of checks in Eternatus, Koraidon, Clodsire, and Toxapex. Kyogre can also switch into Choice Scarf Koraidon's Flare Blitz if Flutter Mane doesn't want to risk a Speed tie. Since Flutter Mane is such a potent wallbreaker, it appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Groudon. Groudon in particular is a very potent partner for checking the physical attackers that can take advantage of Flutter Mane while also setting sun for it. Miraidon and Eternatus are other good partners for appreciating Flutter Mane potentially breaking through Ting-Lu and Clodsire.</li> <li>Flutter Mane primarily has issues entering the field versus physical attackers such as Zacian-C, Arceus formes, and Kingambit.

It features as a prominent Dragon-type switch-in on teams that forgo Zacian-C or Arceus-Fairy, which is especially helpful for Miraidon. Its Normal- and Fighting-type immunities come in handy for both Koraidon and Extreme Killer Arceus. It should be noted, however, that switching into these is very high-risk, high-reward, as while Flutter Mane can take great advantage of its immunities, a wrong prediction will result in an easy OHKO for the opponent.</li> <li>Flutter Mane's extremely threatening nature and low defenses mean that it often forces a reactionary Tera from the opponent, often Tera Fire from Koraidon or Zacian-C or Tera Poison from Arceus formes.

Thunderbolt is notably effective at targeting the tier's plethora of Water- and Flying-types, OHKOing Galarian Zapdos and Mega Aerodactyl after Stealth Rock and 2HKOing Tapu Fini, Slowbro, and Galarian Moltres. Earth Power targets Rock-, Steel, and Fire-types, OHKOing the likes of Iron Moth and Excadrill while dealing significant damage to foes like Mega Tyranitar. Spikes can be used to chip down foes, though it forces Sandy Shocks out after using it, making it risky against setup sweepers. Alternatively, Power Gem deals super effective damage to Thundurus and Thundurus-T and chips Hydreigon. Sandy Shocks can pair excellently with other entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Mega Tyranitar, and Skarmory, as they help it guarantee a 2HKO on foes such as defensive Celesteela after Stealth Rock chip, and they can also wear down checks like Tapu Bulu and Hippowdon for it. In return, Sandy Shocks can spread hazards alongside them while also threatening removal options like Tapu Fini and Excadrill.

        "Gravity (Ground)": {
          "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks is an incredibly useful part of any Ground team thanks to its combination of being able to threaten common types that Ground struggles against such as Flying and Water and good team support in Gravity, making its teammates' and its Ground STAB attacks more threatening without any Ground-immune Pokemon. Its Speed tier is also good enough to outspeed Urshifu-R, a big threat to Ground-type teams, while allowing Ground teams to muscle past Moltres Flying teams, which can outlast Ground teams. Gravity not only allows it to hit Flying types such as Thundurus-T and Zapdos that don't care about its Electric STAB moves, but it also lets its teammates such as Landorus, Ursaluna, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk spam their Ground-type attacks without worrying about Ground-immune Pokemon. While Gravity is certainly useful, it comes with the drawback that opposing Ground-type moves from Pokemon such as Landorus-T or Iron Treads cannot be avoided. Earth Power is its Ground STAB attack, which also benefits from the Gravity that Sandy Shocks sets up and hits Electric-immune Pokemon such as Clodsire and Quagsire hard. This, along with Thunderbolt, allows Sandy Shocks to threaten the whole of Water teams. Finally, Volt Switch lets Sandy Shocks pivot out into a teammate that can either take an attack for it or deal big damage. Heavy-Duty Boots is Sandy Shocks's item of choice, allowing it to switch in multiple times to set Gravity and pivot out with Volt Switch without worrying about residual hazard damage. An alternative EV spread of 48 HP / 208 SpA / 252 Spe can be used for a Speed-boosting Protosynthesis, but this spread worsens the chance of a 2HKO on Quagsire.</p> <p>Landorus is a great teammate for Sandy Shocks, as Landorus's already-scary STAB- and Sheer Force-boosted Earth Power gets even scarier when almost nothing is immune to it. Additionally, Landorus can take Ground-type attacks aimed at Sandy Shocks by virtue of its Flying typing while hitting Grass- and Fairy-types hard with Sheer Force-boosted Sludge Bomb. In return, Sandy Shocks can pivot Landorus in using Volt Switch, as well as offensively threatening Water-types that threaten Landorus such as Urshifu-R. Ursaluna is another good teammate, as it is simply terrifying when Flying-types cannot safely switch into its Earthquake alongside being able to smash Grass-types with Fire Punch and crush Ghost-types with the sheer power of its Guts-boosted Earthquakes and its ability to deal with Spectrier thanks to Guts. Additionally, Ursaluna's bulk lets it take a hit when it switches in through Sandy Shocks' Volt Switch. Great Tusk provides Rapid Spin support on Bulk Up sets and speed control by virtue of its Choice Scarf set alongside Ice Spinner to help Sandy Shocks deal with opposing Landorus and Grass-types such as Hisuian Lilligant. Additionally, Great Tusk's power under Gravity cannot be understated, as its Ground STAB moves deal serious damage and can easily break through opposing teams. Clodsire can take Grass- and Fighting-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Flower Trick and Zamazenta’s Close Combat with ease alongside forming a chip damage core with Sandy Shocks through Volt Switch and Toxic damage. Additionally, Clodsire's Water immunity lets it soak up attacks such as Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Basculegion-F's Water STAB move of choice, and it is generally a rather good special wall. Quagsire is a good defensive partner for Sandy Shocks, as it can wall Chien-Pao and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and threaten them back with Body Press, as well as being able to set hazards. Iron Treads functions as a check to Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Flutter Mane who can take Sandy Shocks' attacks and threaten it back while also having Ice-type coverage to hit Flying- and Grass-types. Alongside those attributes, Iron Treads also has Knock Off, allowing it to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from common users such as Quagsire and Amoonguss, letting Sandy Shocks gradually wear them down over the course of the game. Finally, Ting-Lu's sheer bulk allows it to take strong hits such as Dragonite's boosted Extreme Speed that Sandy Shocks can't while setting up hazards to chip away at common answers to Sandy Shocks such as opposing Ting-Lu.</p>"

Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Tinkaton, Orthworm, and Bronzong also aid in Iron Treads sweeping. Tinkaton specifically ensures Stealth Rock being set due to Mold Breaker while having a decent offensive presence thanks to Gigaton Hammer being so powerful. Orthworm provides a Ground immunity, easing pressure off other teammates such as Corviknight, all while also having Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also take on Fire-type moves that are aimed at Iron Treads. Kingambit is a great mid- to late-game sweeper that appreciates Iron Treads's ability to punch holes early-game or clean up after Kingambit has punched holes itself, providing the team with multiple avenues of winning.</p>"

Heavy Slam gets an OHKO on Iron Valiant and 2HKOes Iron Bundle, which is something that's not achievable with Iron Head, however, Iron Head 2HKOes Baxcalibur, and does non-negligible damage to Dragonite, which isn't possible with Heavy Slam.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rapid Spin</strong>: It may seem weird to run Rapid Spin on such a fast-paced-format, but with it, Iron Treads can support teammates like Dragonite and Focus Sash Flutter Mane. Additionally, with a Jolly nature and minimal Speed investment Iron Treads can outrun Timid Iron Bundle after a Rapid Spin.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Ice Spinner gives Iron Treads a move to hit Dragonite, Hydreigon, Garchomp, and Great Tusk hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off is Iron Treads's best move against Rotom-W and Rotom-H, and its item removal is valuable all around, crippling both the Pokemon it's supposed to check as well as common switch-ins.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Volt Switch</strong>: Pivoting can help Iron Treads against physically bulky Pokemon like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Terastallized Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: The EV Spread aims to maximize Iron Treads's ability to take special attacks, especially when coupled with an Assault Vest; the Speed allows it to outspeed Jolly Breloom before a Rapid Spin and Timid Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying provides Iron Treads with a Ground immunity and a Fighting resistance, along with neutralizing its Fire weakness, which can be useful against Tera Fire Flutter Mane and Sylveon, Skeledirge, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth.</li> </ul>"

Electric Terrain also blocks sleep moves from foes such as Skeledirge, Espathra, Iron Valiant, Gengar, Breloom, and Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rapid Spin</strong>: Despite the fast-paced-nature of BSS, Rapid Spin allows Iron Treads to both boost its speed and clear entry hazards from its side of the field, supporting teammates such as Focus Sash Iron Bundle and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Along with its item removal ability, Knock Off is Iron Treads's best move to hit Rotom-W and Rotom-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Ice Spinner allows Iron Treads to hit foes such as Dragonite and Great Tusk hard, but it should be used carefully if it's run alongside Electric Terrain, as it ends the current active Terrain.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam</strong>: With Heavy Slam, Iron Treads can OHKO Iron Valiant, as well as 2HKO Iron Bundle without Tera Steel.

Iron Treads can opt to be a hazard setter itself with Stealth Rock, keep up momentum with Volt Switch on targets like Corviknight, or use Heavy Slam as a strong STAB option for Scream Tail and Chien-Pao. Levitate allows Iron Treads to be immune to Spikes while also being able to spin them away, whereas Earth Eater can be used as an alternative for better longevity against hazard setters like Garchomp and Smack Down Landorus-T. Offensive Pokemon that are weak to hazards such as Chien-Pao and Thundurus-T appreciate Iron Treads's ability to keep hazards off the field, as well as being able to pivot them in safely with Volt Switch. Strong physical attackers like Galarian Zapdos and Kingambit also are good teammates for Iron Treads, as they can more easily break through Corviknight with Knock Off support from Iron Treads. Iron Treads can be overwhelmed by coverage options from hazard setters such as Liquidation Garchomp, so running Wish Scream Tail, which can increase Iron Treads's longevity, or a secondary hazard remover like Corviknight and Quaquaval, which can also stave off hits, is recommended.

If there is already a Stealth Rock user on the team, Iron Treads can instead use Heavy Slam to check Calm Mind Scream Tail and Enamorus-T, Rock Slide to OHKO Talonflame and Volcarona, or Volt Switch to bring in teammates safely. 236 Speed EVs are used to outspeed and threaten an OHKO on Jolly Hisuian Arcanine. Pixilate Scream Tail and Primordial Sea users like Inteleon, Greninja, and Quaquaval all appreciate Iron Treads switching into their checks in Desolate Land Fire-types like Iron Moth and Ceruledge. Physical wallbreakers like Chien-Pao and Hisuian Arcanine appreciate Iron Treads removing items from shared switch-ins like Corviknight and Quaquaval. Fighting- and Ground- types like Galarian Zapdos, Slither Wing, and Garchomp threaten Iron Treads, so defensive partners like Scream Tail, Quaquaval, and Corviknight are recommended. Iron Treads's Rapid Spin also supports the hazard stacking effort from partners like Garchomp and Ting-Lu.

It also has (sentence was getting long) a great variety of coverage moves, aiding against Landorus and the aforementioned Fire-types. Earthquake targets threats such as Heatran, Zeraora, Sneasler, and Gholdengo. Iron Head hits Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus, while Volt Switch allows Iron Treads to maintain momentum and pivot out of unfavorable switch-ins like Pelipper and Slowbro. Ice Spinner hits Ground- and Dragon-types such as Landorus, Dragonite, and Garchomp while also aiding in the Flying matchup, removing Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Gliscor. Furthermore, Ice Spinner removes Psychic Terrain for Mega Scizor, which relies on Bullet Punch. Stone Edge threatens Fire- and Flying-types like Volcarona, Articuno, and Mega Charizard Y. Alternatively, Knock Off pressures defensive switch-ins such as Rotom-W, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn while also being Iron Treads's best move against Air Balloon Gholdengo and Latias. Iron Treads can provide emergency entry hazard removal via Rapid Spin for faster-paced Steel teams. Hard Press is a niche option to remove frail targets like Meowscarada; however, Iron Head allows Iron Treads to revenge kill weakened Pokemon. Gholdengo is an excellent teammate that greatly capitalizes on Z-Moves, offers a Fighting-type immunity, and acts as a situational Ground-type immunity with Air Balloon. It also removes walls like Slowbro, Corviknight, and defensive Great Tusk. In return, Iron Treads offers a valuable answer to Fire-types such as Cinderace, Volcanion, and Victini. Heatran absorbs Fire-type attacks from faster threats like Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Iron Moth, in addition to setting up Stealth Rock to wear down switch-ins for Iron Treads. Celesteela and Corviknight offer a Ground-type immunity, walling Sand Rush Excadrill and Hippowdon. Furthermore, Corviknight provides slow pivoting via U-turn, while Celesteela pressures foes with residual chip damage using Toxic and Leech Seed. In exchange, Iron Treads threatens Electric-type Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Regieleki, and Sandy Shocks, as well as Fire teams, removing Hisuian Arcanine and Ceruledge once its Focus Sash has been broken. Ferrothorn is a great buffer against Water- and Ground- types like Gastrodon, Swampert, Mamoswine, and Slowking. Additionally, Ferrothorn boasts an array of utility options such as Leech Seed, Knock Off, and Spikes, wearing down Iron Treads's switch-ins and allowing for a free Stone Edge moveslot.</p>"

Iron Bundle has excellent speed control with Icy Wind, which, when combined with its high Speed, can easily ensure that it and its allies outspeed the enemy team. However, Iron Bundle is a fairly fragile Pokemon, especially against powerful special attackers such as Chi-Yu and Gholdengo.</p>",

On a snow team with Abomasnow, Iron Bundle can run Blizzard as a powerful spread attack, and it also can maximize its damage output with Tera Ice. Snow also boosts Iron Bundle's Defense, making it particularly more effective against priority spam teams with Dragonite and Palafin. 252 HP and 64 Special Defense EVs can be used with Assault Vest to survive an Overheat from Choice Scarf Chi-Yu, and Iron Bundle still has above 152 Speed EVs left for outspeeding Meowscarada. 40 HP EVs allow Iron Bundle to avoid a potential OHKO from Chien-Pao's Sacred Sword if Chien-Pao lacks a damage-boosting item, so an EV spread of 40 HP / 216 SpA / 252 Spe on less bulky sets could be used instead.</p>",

Drain Punch grants Iron Hands some form of recovery and still hits hard, notably OHKOing Hisuian Goodra and 2HKOing Ting-Lu after a Swords Dance. Thunder Punch OHKOes Articuno and Corviknight after one Swords Dance. Ice Punch allows Iron Hands to threaten several Flying-types its STAB moves aren't very effective against, like both Landorus formes and Dragonite. Earthquake is an alternative option that allows Iron Hands to threaten several Steel- and Fire-types, OHKOing Gholdengo and 2HKOing Torkoal after one Swords Dance boost. With a Shuca Berry, Iron Hands can take STAB Ground-type attacks that could easily revenge kill it, such as Landorus's Earth Power and Choice Scarf Iron Treads's Earthquake. Using a Lum Berry allows Iron Hands to immediately cure status &amp; especially burn, which would otherwise weaken Iron Hands's wallbreaking capabilities. This also allows it to bypass Moltres's Flame Body and punish Sableye for attempting to burn it. 116 Defense EVs in tandem with Lum Berry allow Iron Hands to take a +2 Earthquake from Dragonite and Choice Band Iron Treads's Earthquake, as well as taking a little over 50% damage from Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Play Rough. With 140 Speed EVs, Iron Hands outspeeds Ting-Lu and Corviknight.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks is mandatory on Electric teams, being the only viable pick with access to entry hazards, allowing Iron Hands to easily take out weakened foes.

Rock Slide is an alternative option to hit Kilowattrel and deal with Volcarona without risking a burn from Flame Body.</p> <p>Great Tusk appreciates Iron Hands's ability to tank neutral special hits like Water-type attacks from Greninja and Pelipper and force them out.

Breloom appreciates Iron Hands switching into Fire-type attacks from Volcarona and forcing Flying-types like Iron Jugulis to switch. Iron Valiant appreciates Iron Hands's slow Volt Switch, allowing Iron Valiant to switch in freely against opposing Fighting teams. Iron Valiant also threatens common physically defensive Pokemon like Dondozo, Skeledirge, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk.

          "description": "<p>On account of its enormous stats, offensive typing, and diverse attacking options in conjunction with Swords Dance, Iron Hands makes for a powerful offensive tank on a variety of teams. At high HP, it is bulky enough to survive attacks from faster revenge killers such as Excadrill, Latios, and Psychic Thundurus-T while also being able to trade with defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Magic Guard Clefable, and Gastrodon after a boost. Added onto this, Iron Hands's resistances can also allow it to check physical threats such as both Tyranitar formes and Bisharp when needed. Thunder Punch is normally used for its consistency, but Wild Charge is an alternative with a higher Base Power, most notably improving damage rolls against threats such as Choice Scarf Tapu Fini unboosted while also allowing it to power through defensive stalwarts such as Mega Sableye more easily at +2, albeit at the cost of recoil. Drain Punch, aside from being a consistent secondary STAB option, also provides recovery against Pokemon that Iron Hands may stay in against, such as Tyranitar and Gastrodon, and avoids dropping Iron Hands's defenses for dealing with subsequent attacks. Alternatively, Close Combat provides a stronger option that has a chance of breaking through specific defensive Pokemon, such as 2HKOing Quagsire after slight chip damage. Ice Punch provides Iron Hands with coverage against targets that would otherwise resist its attacking combination, such as Mega Latias, Thundurus-T, and Amoonguss, while Earthquake can be used to 2HKO Skeledirge, in addition to OHKOing most opposing Iron Hands at +2. Substitute, despite the opportunity cost, is an interesting option that can allow Iron Hands to avoid status from Pokemon otherwise reliant on doing so to cripple it, like Mega Sableye and Gastrodon. The given EVs specifically allow Iron Hands to OHKO Slowbro at +2 with a Punching Glove-boosted Thunder Punch while outspeeding uninvested Clefable, with the rest of the EVs allocated into Special Defense to improve its ability to take special hits from attackers like Iron Moth, Clefable, and Thundurus-T. When using Leftovers, a minimum of 16 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature should be used instead to guarantee an OHKO on Excadrill with Drain Punch. Iron Hands pairs remarkably well with frailer offensive teammates that can take advantage of the gaping holes it can threaten to leave early on; chief among these are fast late-game cleaners such as Autotomize Celesteela and Booster Energy Iron Moth, which each appreciate Iron Hands's ability to weaken teams filled with bulky Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Hippowdon lacking Whirlwind, and Mega Tyranitar. In return, these Pokemon can also deal with several of the faster Pokemon used to force out Iron Hands, like Latios and Enamorus, allowing it to preserve its bulk into more useful situations. Similarly, Iron Hands can struggle to preserve its HP when subjected to chip damage overtime, like Spikes from Skarmory. Thus, Pokemon that can prevent or clear entry hazards, such as Tapu Fini and Excadrill are incredibly valuable to have as teammates—Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain support also helps shield Iron Hands from potential status elements. Other pivots such as Flip Turn Latios and Slowbro are similarly effective at allowing Iron Hands to have safe switch-in opportunities into Pokemon that it can force out, such as Tyranitar. Slowbro can also utilize Future Sight to compensate for Iron Hands's difficulties getting past faster physical walls, such as Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur.</p>"

        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Band Iron Hands makes the most of its colorful coverage options to be an effective wallbreaker. Ice Punch cleanly OHKOes Salamence, preventing it from chipping Iron Hands down via Wild Charge recoil and Roost, while also dealing significant damage to other Dragon-types like Latios, Latias, and Mega Altaria. Earthquake severely dents Skeledirge and OHKOes Victini. Alternatively, Heavy Slam can be used to OHKO physically defensive Clefable, preventing it from being able to safely scout Iron Hands. The given EV spread maximizes Iron Hands’s wallbreaking power while allowing it to outrun uninvested Skarmory. Choice Band Iron Hands fits best on bulkier teams that need a strong wallbreaker against defensive cores while also providing residual defensive utility in being able to slow down specific wallbreakers on more offensively-oriented teams, such as Galarian Zapdos and Bisharp, when necessary. Bulky teammates commonly featured on these teams, such as Skarmory, Slowking, and Amoonguss, each appreciate Iron Hands's ability to directly threaten several Pokemon used to take advantage of them, such as Celesteela and Mega Tyranitar. Slowking is also able to use Future Sight to dissuade the likes of Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur for Iron Hands. As Iron Hands lacks the longevity to batter away at and trade with defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth and is somewhat prediction-reliant, entry hazard support from the likes of Hippowdon, Jirachi, and Iron Moth can help Iron Hands in breaking through these Pokemon more effectively. More offensive teammates such as Latios and Mega Aerodactyl can be similarly effective in providing additional forms of offensive pressure to punish these Pokemon. Iron Hands's lack of defensive investment also makes it more vulnerable to revenge killers such as Enamorus, Latios, and Excadrill, and it can also struggle to check the likes of Scizor long-term, particularly fearing the loss of its item in the process. Thus, specific answers to these respective Pokemon, such as Slowking, Celesteela, and Mandibuzz, are highly useful to help keep them in check offensively.</p>"

Wild Charge and Close Combat are higher power options over Thunder Punch and Drain Punch that allow for a few notable benchmarks, such as having a chance to 2HKO Tera Water Skeledirge and OHKOing defensive Rotom-W after Stealth Rock and a Swords Dance, but they both greatly sacrifice longevity. Ice Punch lets it nail Ground-, Flying- and Dragon-types that resist its STAB combination such as Landorus-T, Dragonite, Zapdos, and Great Tusk. Tera Water lets Iron Hands gain a much stronger defensive type overall, preventing Ground-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types from revenge killing it while improving the rain matchup significantly. The given EV spread allows Iron Hands to KO Tapu Lele with Thunder Punch after a Swords Dance and outspeed Chansey, with the rest dumped into Special Defense to maximize its lower special bulk. Entry hazard support from Garchomp, Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, and Mega Diancie is crucial to Iron Hands, as it quickly wears down all of its checks for it to clean late-game. Future Sight support is also notable, as it allows Iron Hands to bypass would-be checks such as Buzzwole and Skeledirge. Pivots such as Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T also work well with Iron Hands, as they bring it in safely and prevent it from being worn down quickly. Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain also activates Iron Hands's Quark Drive, boosting its Attack even further. Due to its great defensive utility, it partners well with Pokemon like Slowbro and Dragapult, as it takes advantage of Dark-types that pressure these two out, with Slowbro providing Future Sight support and Dragapult taking advantage of Iron Hands’s checks like Buzzwole and Skeledirge. Due to its lack of longevity, it is a poor singular check to threats such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Kartana, so pairing it up with Pokemon like tank Garchomp, Tapu Fini, and Rotom-W to form defensive a defensive core works wonders.</p>"

Hurricane destroys many offensive Pokemon that can take Dark Pulse, including Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Quaquaval, and Volcarona. Taunt allows Iron Jugulis to function as a dangerous stallbreaker by shutting down passive walls such as Clodsire, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. It also prevents Slowking from pivoting with Chilly Reception and threats such as Dragonite, Volcarona, Polteageist, and Roaring Moon from setting up. Flamethrower hits Steel-types such as Corviknight, Kingambit, and Iron Treads. Fire Blast trades some of Flamethrower's accuracy for more power, most notably OHKOing the aforementioned Steel-types with Tera Fire. Alternatively, Earth Power OHKOes Iron Moth and lands a stronger hit on Clodsire, Garganacl, Cinderace, Iron Hands, and Toxapex. Tera Dark boosts the power of Dark Pulse, making it easier to pressure walls such as Garganacl, Rotom-W, and Toxapex with its flinch chance. Tera Flying strengthens Hurricane, OHKOing Greninja, Amoonguss, and Cinderace most of the time and 2HKOing Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge. Tera Fire strengthens Flamethrower or Fire Blast and gives Iron Jugulis crucial resistances to Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Iron Jugulis is best used on hyper offense teams that appreciate its ability to trouble stall teams and keep fast sweepers in check. Due to its only decent power, Iron Jugulis greatly appreciates entry hazards from teammates such as Glimmora, Greninja, Meowscarada, and Garchomp to wear down its checks. Additionally, Iron Jugulis's Stealth Rock weakness makes entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads very valuable partners; they can also pressure Clodsire and Iron Moth to free up Iron Jugulis to run a Fire-type move. Powerful wallbreakers such as Breloom and Dragapult can soften up the opposing team for Iron Jugulis to clean up late-game. Conversely, Iron Jugulis's ability to break through special walls with Taunt opens up other special sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth. Gholdengo can also cripple walls with Choice item + Trick and handle Booster Energy Iron Valiant, one of the only threats capable of outspeeding and threatening Iron Jugulis. Iron Jugulis is also effective on rain teams, providing it with a perfectly-accurate Hurricane and featuring extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Floatzel and Walking Wake that can punch holes for it to sweep late-game. In return, Iron Jugulis threatens Amoonguss and provides a valuable Ghost resistance to take on threats such as Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark more easily.</p>"

With Booster Energy, Iron Jugulis is able to outspeed almost every other Pokemon in the format and use its great support options to apply pressure on the opponent with fast Snarls and Air Slashes. Its typing gives it an immunity to Prankster Taunt, as well as resistances to attacks from several common threats such as Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Urshifu-S's Wicked Blow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iron Jugulis is used on semi-Trick Room teams with Farigiraf and Ursaluna-B, as it forces opponents to respect both a potential Tailwind from Iron Jugulis and Trick Room from Farigiraf. Both Incineroar and Ogerpon-W are great partners for Iron Jugulis; Incineroar provides Fake Out support and weakens potential threats such as Chien-Pao with Intimidate, and Ogerpon-W provides redirection to allow Iron Jugulis to set up Tailwind more easily. Flutter Mane also forms a very strong and consistent pairing with Iron Jugulis, countering opposing Dark-types that Iron Jugulis would have trouble dealing with.</p> </li> <li> <p>While having a few strong resistances, Iron Jugulis's typing also means it's weak to common metagame threats such as Flutter Mane, especially the Speed Booster Energy variants, and Chien-Pao, which threaten an OHKO. Iron Jugulis also struggles against Pokemon that resist its STAB moves and can take advantage of its low damage output like Incineroar and Raging Bolt. Additionally, Iron Jugulis struggles to find a place on most teams due to it competing with Tornadus, which, unlike Iron Jugulis, has access to Prankster Tailwind, a strong Flying-type STAB move in the form of Bleakwind Storm, and Prankster Rain Dance and Sunny Day.</p> </li> </ul>",

Fiery Dance is an alternative; it's notably weaker, missing out on the OHKO on Autotomize Celesteela and 2HKO on Iron Hands. However, in exchange, it has perfect accuracy, more PP, and its ability to boost Iron Moth's Special Attack can let it sweep late-game. Sludge Wave is Iron Moth's other STAB attack; besides hitting opposing Dragon- and Fire-types for neutral damage, it also breaks through Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Fini. Due to the amount of Pokemon it threatens out, such as Aegislash and Mega Sableye, Iron Moth is an effective setter of Toxic Spikes; Energy Ball is an alternative, serving as coverage against opposing Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types, like Gastrodon and Tyranitar, and finally, U-turn is another alternative, as the switches Iron Moth forces out let it act as an effective offensive pivot. Morning Sun gives Iron Moth reliable recovery, letting it avoid getting worn down by repeated attacks and Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots are removed. Iron Moth best fits on balance and offensive teams looking for a fast and powerful special attacker with good utility. While Iron Moth can check most special attackers, even resisted hits from physical attackers like Victini can 2HKO it. Thus, physical walls and tanks like Slowbro can check these foes for Iron Moth. Pivots, like the latter two, can also help Iron Moth find opportunities to switch in. If it is carrying U-turn, wallbreakers like Choice Band Scizor, Choice Specs Latios, and Enamorus appreciate Iron Moth's ability to pivot them in safely, while in return they can smash through the walls and many offensive threats that give Iron Moth trouble. Speed control, namely powerful priority users like Scizor and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Fini and Hydreigon, can also help eliminate physical attackers.

U-turn forgoes a coverage move in order to allow Iron Moth to maintain momentum even when it cannot break through a team. Fiery Dance can be run instead of Flamethrower, forgoing a bit of power and burn chance in exchange for the potential to snowball into a sweep.</p> <p>Iron Moth pairs well with wallbreakers that can open holes for it such as Scovillain and Hisuian Arcanine. The former aids with bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Gastrodon that may give Iron Moth trouble depending on its coverage, while the latter appreciates Iron Moth's speed control and potential pivoting capabilities to destroy problematic Fire-types and special walls, including Skeledirge and Hisuian Goodra. Torkoal provides Stealth Rock, status, and Rapid Spin support as well as powering up Iron Moth's Flamethrower with the sun. Paldean Tauros-F can threaten Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Heatran that wall Iron Moth, while Iron Moth can discourage faster Pokemon such as Greninja and Iron Treads from switching in—neither of which Paldean Tauros-F wants to take on. Volcarona can aid Iron Moth in wearing down a team, as both Pokemon can make progress to help the other break through; additionally, Volcarona can heavily damage Psychic- and Dark- types such as Espathra and Ting-Lu that can give Iron Moth trouble. Finally, Iron Moth's bad bulk makes pivoting support from Cinderace, Talonflame, and Moltres appreciated to help it get in easier; Cinderace can also provide hazard control with Court Change, while Talonflame can achieve the same with Defog.</p>"

        "Substitute + Three Attacks (Poison)": {
          "description": "<p>With a pair of Heavy-Duty Boots, Iron Moth can switch in safely on entry hazards and go to town. It can easily set up a Substitute on foes such as Articuno, Moltres, and Amoonguss or predicted Sucker Punches from the likes of Kingambit to begin causing havoc while being safe from strong attacks. Fiery Dance pairs nicely with Substitute to give Iron Moth plenty of chances to boost up its Special Attack. However, Flamethrower is more consistent, being able to reliably OHKO Alolan Ninetales and fast Kingambit. Either Fire-type STAB melts Steel- and Ice-type threats like Corviknight, Scizor and Frosmoth. Discharge shocks Water-type switch-ins like Toxapex, Empoleon, and Azumarill, along with scaring Flying-types like Moltres and Enamorus out. Energy Ball gives Iron Moth the ability to threaten all Water-types with the exception of Ogerpon-W by hitting Quagsire and Rotom-W, along with blasting through Ground- and Rock-types like Ursaluna-B, Mamoswine, and Garganacl.</p> <p>Galarian Weezing's immunity to Ground-type attacks and high physical bulk make it an invaluable partner for Iron Moth, enabling it to safely come in against monsters like Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Mamoswine and threaten them out with the fear of Will-O-Wisp burns, and in return Iron Moth threatens Steel-types like Corviknight and Gholdengo. Physically defensive Amoonguss's Grass typing lets it take on many of the Water- and Ground-type threats Iron Moth is typically scared of like Urshifu-R, Quaquaval, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads with its STAB attacks. Spore also creates opportunities for Iron Moth to safely switch in and set up Substitute. Physically defensive Toxapex handles faster threats and Fire-types like Chien-Pao, Kleavor, Hisuian Arcanine, and Ceruledge with its STAB Surf and Haze. Alolan Muk's incredible special bulk and ability to handle threatening Ghost-, Dark- and Psychic-type threats like Flutter Mane, Spectrier, Greninja, Darkrai, and Espathra is invaluable. Overqwil can deal with Psychic-types like Galarian Slowking, Hatterene, and Espathra while setting Spikes, which Iron Moth can use to add to its offensive pressure and Fiery Dance sweeping potential. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking serves as another incredible special wall, being able to threaten out foes such as Kommo-o, Volcarona, and opposing Iron Moth. Galarian Slowking can further use STAB Future Sight to set traps to catch opposing switch-ins to Iron Moth such as Iron Hands and Clodsire. Water Absorb Clodsire handles Fire-types that would switch into Iron Moth's STAB moves like Ninetales and Volcanion with STAB Earthquake. It can also use Unaware to check Volcarona and set up Stealth Rock to pressure Fire-types. Glimmora can also set Stealth Rock and threaten out Fire-types like Talonflame and Skeledirge with its STAB Power Gem and Heatran with Earth Power, and using Corrosion, it can ruin special walls like Alolan Muk, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire with Toxic. Sneasler's higher base Speed and STAB moves can allow it to blast through threats like Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Heatran, the Ogerpon formes, and Kingambit. Alternatively, Sneasler can use a Choice Scarf to outspeed and remove Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur even after it gets a Speed boost while using Switcheroo to mess up walls like Clodsire. Okidogi can remove threats like Kingambit, Heatran and Ogerpon-C while softening up other threats such as Toxapex and Clodsire with Knock Off.</p>"

        "Booster Energy Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>Iron Moth is a great sweeper, since the combination of the Speed boost from Booster Energy, its colorful coverage moves, and boosts from Fiery Dance allows it to snowball easily. The potential Special Attack boost from Fiery Dance makes scouting the set of Iron Moth extremely dangerous. Energy Ball is for Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Water-types like Alomomola, Dondozo, and Urshifu-R. Dazzling Gleam threatens foes like Zamazenta, Garchomp, and Dragonite with heavy damage. Tera Blast with Tera Ground allows Iron Moth to OHKO Heatran, 2HKO Galarian Slowking or OHKO it at +1 with minor chip damage, and 2HKO Garganacl, meanwhile providing Iron Moth with a valuable immunity to Thunder Wave from the likes of Galarian Slowking and Ferrothorn. Tera Grass, on the other hand, gives Energy Ball a STAB boost, which can guarantee it OHKOes foes like Mega Diancie and Urshifu-R without a Fiery Dance boost. It also flips Iron Moth's weakness to Water- and Ground-types, easing the matchup versus Ogerpon-W and Garchomp. The Special Attack and Speed EVs give Iron Moth a Speed boost with Quark Drive, and the remainder goes to Defense instead of HP in order to better take priority moves like Fake Out from Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham, Extreme Speed from Dragonite, Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile, and Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R after Terastallizing. Iron Moth appreciates teammates like Ogerpon-W and Landorus-T to pressure its common checks like Heatran and Galarian Slowking when not running Tera Ground. Additionally, Ogerpon-W can break Multiscale on Dragonite to give Iron Moth an easier clean. Landorus-T and Great Tusk can provide entry hazard control with Defog and Rapid Spin respectively to cover Iron Moth's weakness to Stealth Rock. Tapu Lele is also a great partner of Iron Moth since its Psychic Surge can protect Iron Moth from revenge killers like Mega Mawile, and the two of them can wear down their common checks like Galarian Slowking and Heatran for each other.</p>"
        },
        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<p>Iron Moth's power, Speed tier, and U-turn allow it to function well as an offensive pivot. Energy Ball hits Gastrodon and Garganacl while U-turn allows Iron Moth to pivot out of bad matchups, such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge. Alternatively, Psychic hits Toxapex, but it makes Iron Moth a significant momentum sink against Heatran and Mega Tyranitar. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Iron Moth to act as a pivot consistently without having to worry about entry hazard chip, which it is otherwise very vulnerable to. Tera Grass surprises Mega Swampert, Mega Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Garchomp defensively before hitting them back with a powerful Energy Ball. Iron Moth fits well on VoltTurn offenses, specifically those including Tapu Koko, who is a natural partner for it. Tapu Koko can set Electric Terrain for Iron Moth in order to boost its Special Attack and benefits from Iron Moth bringing it in on Toxapex. Conversely, Tapu Koko can bring Iron Moth in on threats to it, such as Ferrothorn and Rillaboom. Iron Moth also benefits heavily from Future Sight support, as it prevents Toxapex from safely switching in while also applying some chip onto Heatran. Slowbro can pivot into threats to Iron Moth, such as Garchomp, Mega Lopunny, and Zamazenta, while Slowking helps out even more against Heatran. Entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn, Mega Diancie, Garchomp, and Landorus-T wear down Iron Moth's checks like Heatran, Garchomp, and Mega Tyranitar. Garchomp in particular pivots into Heatran relatively well. Powerful offensive threats like Dragapult, Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Lele appreciate Iron Moth bringing them in safely on threats like Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge while also being a decent wallbreaker in its own right. The former three can also use their good Speed tier to help out Iron Moth against more offensive builds.</p>"

      "comments": "<h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Astrolotl and Ceruledge</strong>: Specially defensive Astrolotl is Iron Moth's most common counter, stomaching even its sun-boosted Choice Specs Tera Fire Overheat and threatening to KO it back with Stomping Tantrum. In combination with a Poison-resistant Pokemon like Venomicon, Iron Moth can cede crucial momentum, providing the opponent with an opportunity for a comeback. Flash Fire Ceruledge is Iron Moth's hardest counter, being immune to Overheat and Fiery Dance,  resistant to Solar Beam and Sludge Wave, and able to strike back with a boosted Shadow Sneak. However, Iron Moth can run Tera Ground + Tera Blast specifically to circumvent these counters.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock wears down Iron Moth exceptionally quickly. This is particularly notable with its Choice Specs set, which needs to switch out often to reset Overheat's Special Attack drops.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Sucker Punch Kingambit and Extreme Speed Dragonite can prey on Iron Moth's weak physical defense. Kingambit must be wary of Tera Fairy Iron Moth, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Roaring Moon, Cinderace, Meowscarada, Greninja, and Psyshock Iron Valiant can pick off Iron Moth before it can respond.</p> <p><strong>Special Tanks</strong>: Clodsire, Skeledirge, Arghonaut, and Ting-Lu can easily tank most moves from Booster Energy Iron Moth, but they are 2HKOed by its sun-boosted Choice Specs Overheat with any prior damage or if it Terastallizes.</p> <p><strong>Rain Teams</strong>: Pelipper can override Jumbao's sun with rain, which weakens Iron Moth's best attacks. Floatzel and Quaquaval hit Iron Moth's weak physical defense.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Choice Specs": {
          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Specs Iron Moth is the strongest wallbreaker available for sun teams. Its Tera Fire Overheat under sun can 2HKO Arghonaut and Skeledirge, two of the best special walls in the metagame, and still deal massive damage to frailer targets at -2. Solar Beam more reliably 2HKOes Arghonaut, Toxapex, and Garganacl so that Iron Moth isn't required to Terastallize to be effective. Fiery Dance lets Iron Moth snowball and end games once the opposing team has no remaining Unaware users and is sufficiently weakened. Sludge Wave 2HKOes Astrolotl and Dragonite and OHKOes Cinderace outside of sun, which could otherwise tank an Overheat and pivot around the weakened hit. Ground-type Tera Blast OHKOes Ceruledge, Astrolotl, Skeledirge, and opposing Iron Moth with a surprise hit.</p> <p>Drought Jumbao is a required teammate to set up sun. Healing Wish can help Iron Moth offset Stealth Rock damage and get into battle late-game. Other Protosynthesis users like Roaring Moon and Great Tusk fit fantastically alongside Iron Moth. Roaring Moon's Choice Band-boosted attacks complement Iron Moth's strong special attacks, and its U-turn can bring Iron Moth in safely against a Fairy- or Steel-type switch-in. Great Tusk can remove entry hazards and switch into strong physical attackers like Roaring Moon and Kingambit. In return, Iron Moth very easily switches into Jumbao, one of Great Tusk's hard counters. Eject Button Hatterene is a fantastic teammate that helps keep Stealth Rock off the field and give Iron Moth a crucial free switch.</p>"

        "Booster Energy": {
          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Booster Energy Iron Moth fits best on hyper offense teams where Booster Energy's one-time use can be easily justified. Although it faces some competition  from Quiver Dance Volcarona, its instant power and higher natural Speed tier gives it a niche over Volcarona. Fiery Dance allows Iron Moth to snowball quickly, while Sludge Wave forces Arghonaut and Garganacl to think twice before Terastallizing into a Fairy-type. Energy Ball 2HKOes Arghonaut, Krilowatt, and Garganacl, but Psychic maintains coverage against Arghonaut while pressuring Venomicon, Dragapult, and Clodsire harder. Ground-type Tera Blast allows Iron Moth to push past Skeledirge, Astrolotl, Clodsire, and Ceruledge, which would otherwise give it serious trouble. Dazzling Gleam is best when Iron Moth is Tera Fairy, hitting Roaring Moon and Dragapult more effectively. Tera Fairy allows Iron Moth to stomach Roaring Moon's STAB moves and Kingambit's Sucker Punch, removing them for a surprise KO. Agility helps Iron Moth sweep better, but it displaces a coverage move and is generally outclassed by Volcarona as a setup sweeper. Tera Grass is the best option, turning Iron Moth's severe Ground weakness into a resistance and boosting Energy Ball. An EV spread of 124 Def / 132 SpA / 252 Spe can be used so that Booster Energy raises Iron Moth's Speed, but the drop in power is noticeable. Booster Energy Iron Moth can also fit on sun teams to thwart typical counterplay to its Choice Specs set. Solar Beam should be run to OHKO specially defensive Garganacl at +1 and with Quark Drive active. However, Choice Specs is usually more effective against unprepared teams.</p> <p>Iron Moth fits excellently on hyper offense teams. Entry hazard setters like Meowscarada, Greninja, and Garchomp enable Iron Moth to net KOs more easily. Rapid Spin users like Caribolt and Great Tusk remove Stealth Rock to help Iron Moth leverage its good special bulk. Other hyper offense sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, Swords Dance Iron Valiant, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Scale Shot + Swords Dance Miasmaw tend to struggle with Jumbao, which Iron Moth can help deal with. Supreme Overlord Kingambit can clean up games after Iron Moth has broken holes and fainted.</p>"

Pokemon with setup moves like Ogerpon-W appreciate Iron Moth's ability to bait in RegenVest users like Manaphy and Meloetta and pivot on them. Iron Moth does pitiful damage to RegenVest users like Manaphy, Meloetta, and Hisuian Goodra, so it benefits from special wallbreakers like Deoxys-S, Walking Wake, and Latios that can lure in and help wear down shared checks; they also appreciate Iron Moth chipping said checks, especially with Toxic or Toxic Spikes.</p>"

Additionally, Baxcalibur's neutrality to Ice-type attacks allows it to combat Chien-Pao lacking Fighting-type coverage and Ice Beam Greninja. Ice Shard allows Baxcalibur to use an Adamant nature to revenge kill weakened targets such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane. Alternatively, Glaive Rush may be used instead to deal more damage to Chien-Pao and opposing Baxcalibur. Icicle Spear in conjunction with Loaded Dice is a potent combination, dealing enough damage to break past Quagsire and Corviknight with an Adamant nature.

Earthquake is a great coverage move, allowing Baxcalibur to threaten Skeledirge, Kingambit, and Gholdengo.</p> <p>Baxcalibur is capable of switching into Will-O-Wisps from the likes of Sableye and Skeledirge with its ability Thermal Exchange, keeping other physical attackers like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Roaring Moon safe. Cyclizar is an exceptional teammate, as it uses Shed Tail to keep Baxcalibur safe from status ailments induced by Toxapex and Grimmsnarl as it sets up with Dragon Dance. Furthermore, Cyclizar removes entry hazards such as Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Dragapult is capable of outpacing threats like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and opposing Baxcalibur as well as pressuring Dondozo with Thunderbolt. Garchomp eases Baxcalibur's sweeping by setting entry hazards and phazing opposing Pokemon through Dragon Tail to rack up damage. Dragalge sets up Toxic Spikes and checks Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant thanks to its Fairy-type neutrality along with STAB Gunk Shot. Hydreigon threatens physical walls like Slowbro, Dondozo, and Toxapex by disabling their recovery options with Taunt and setting up on them using Nasty Plot.

However, it struggles to break through Unaware walls, such as Quagsire and Dondozo, and Pokemon that resist its STAB Combination and threaten it, such as Scizor and Azumarill. Thermal Exchange lets it switch into and punish Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-W and Sableye and Fire-type moves from Ceruledge and Fire Spin Skuntank. Glaive Rush hits Rotom-W, Toxapex, Volcarona and Quaquaval, while Ice-type STAB moves let it threaten Meowscarada, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. Earthquake is a great option to hit Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Kingambit super effectively, while Ice Shard lets it pick off weakened Pokemon and Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada, Flamigo, and Dragapult. An Adamant nature maximizes Baxcalibur's power while outspeeding Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao at +1; however, a Jolly nature outspeeds Gholdengo and Quaquaval and Speed ties Choice Scarf Great Tusk at +1.</p> <p>Baxcalibur appreciates teammates that can provide it with setup opportunities. Froslass can set Spikes and stop opposing hazards with Taunt, spread burns, and use Destiny Bond to KO opposing threats to Baxcalibur. Abomasnow provides Baxcalibur with snow's defense boost and Aurora Veil to help it set up while also checking Dondozo and Quagsire. Swords Dance Chien-Pao can break Skeledirge, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit and can pick off Pokemon that Baxcalibur has weakened with Ice Shard or Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Chien-Pao can effectively clean up the battle once Baxcalibur has dealt significant damage. Avalugg and Cloyster can both remove hazards for Baxcalibur in case its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed. Cloyster can also clean up after Baxcalibur with Shell Smash, while Avalugg can beat Kingambit, Iron Treads, and more with Iron Defense + Body Press if Baxcalibur forgoes Earthquake. Cryogonal's combination of Freeze-Dry and Rapid Spin can help Baxcalibur deal with Quagsire while also removing entry hazards that Ice-type teams often struggle with.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Baxcalibur serves as a fearsome wallbreaker and late-game cleaner, as it swiftly dispatches even the bulkiest walls, such as Corviknight, Iron Hands, and Toxapex. Additionally, Swords Dance grants it the ability to eliminate would-be checks to Dragon Dance sets, like Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos and Flutter Mane, with these being OHKOed by a +2 Ice Shard. At +2, Icicle Crash OHKOes specially defensive Ting-Lu and 2HKOes Corviknight, preventing these walls from phazing or heavily damaging Baxcalibur. Alternatively, Icicle Spear in combination with Loaded Dice enables Baxcalibur to outright OHKO Corviknight and physically defensive Great Tusk at +2. It can also break through Quagsire if it manages to land five hits. However, Dragon teams do not have consistent entry hazard removal, making Loaded Dice a bit unreliable. If Icicle Crash is used, Glaive Rush becomes much more important, since it has a chance to 2HKO Quagsire if using an Adamant nature. This move also enables Baxcalibur to indiscriminately break down bulkier teams like Poison and Water. Ice Shard allows Baxcalibur to clean up types such as Dragon, Ground, and Flying after dealing with bulky Pokemon like Walking Wake, Great Tusk, and Corviknight. A Jolly nature allows Baxcalibur to outpace threats like Glimmora and Gholdengo. This makes Earthquake a better choice, since it OHKOes both at +2 while retaining its ability to threaten Poison and Steel teams. However, this comes at the cost of being unable to break Quagsire.</p> <p>Cyclizar is one of the best teammates for Baxcalibur due to its ability to remove entry hazards, remove items from bulky walls like Quagsire and Toxapex, and pass a Substitute to Baxcalibur with Shed Tail. Garchomp provides entry hazard support and can shuffle opposing teams with Dragon Tail. It also pressures Steel-types like Gholdengo immensely, which is appreciated especially if Baxcalibur lacks Earthquake. Choice Specs Dragapult deals with Flutter Mane, Quagsire, and Gholdengo, pivots Baxcalibur into special walls like Clodsire and Alolan Muk, and spreads status on unsuspecting threats like Kingambit, Quagsire, and Corviknight, making them easier to deal with. Hisuian Goodra checks Fairy-types like Hatterene, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, and Flutter Mane. In return, Baxcalibur deals with Enamorus, Breloom, and Landorus, which all pose a threat to Hisuian Goodra. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Iron Defense Hisuian Goodra work in tandem with Baxcalibur, as they wear down each other's checks to eventually win the Water, Fighting, Steel, and Fairy matchups. Hisuian Goodra and Dragonite also appreciates Baxcalibur's ability to swap into predicted Will-O-Wisps from Sableye. Choice Scarf users like Walking Wake and Roaring Moon are also appreciated, as Walking Wake deals with fast threats like Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Chien-Pao, while Roaring Moon takes care of Iron Valiant and Dragapult.</p>"

Loaded Dice in conjunction with Icicle Spear provides Baxcalibur with a superior Ice-type move to Icicle Crash, capable of breaking through Galarian Weezing and Corviknight after a Swords Dance boost as well as Quagsire if it lands all five hits. Scale Shot, which also takes advantage of Loaded Dice, hits Volcarona, Urshifu-R, and Quaquaval as well as gives Baxcalibur a Speed boost, allowing it to easily tear through teams. Earthquake targets Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra, Gholdengo, and Heatran, as well as bulky walls such as Toxapex, Iron Hands, Kingambit, and Empoleon.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales provides Baxcalibur with more setup opportunities via Aurora Veil, snow support, and Encore, helping to prevent revenge kill attempts. Furthermore, Alolan Ninetales is capable of warding off Enamorus and Fighting-types like Urshifu and Hisuian Lilligant. Chien-Pao threatens Pokemon like Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Jirachi as well as 2HKOes Quagsire and Corviknight with a Choice Band. In return, Chien-Pao appreciates Baxcalibur weakening shared checks, namely Toxapex and Corviknight. Mamoswine and Froslass provide entry hazard support for Baxcalibur's wallbreaking; the former breaks bulky Steel-types like Heatran and Kingambit should Baxcalibur opt for Ice Shard and removes Corviknight with Smack Down, while the latter offers a Fighting-type immunity. Avalugg and Alolan Sandslash remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin; the former also prevents faster threats like Choice Scarf Urshifu and Iron Defense Iron Treads from sweeping, while the latter provides speed control, checking Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant. Alolan Sandslash also deters spinblockers with Knock Off and walls and removes Toxapex. Frosmoth threatens physically defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Quagsire, and Galarian Weezing and appreciates Baxcalibur's removal of the aforementioned Steel- and Fire-types.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Boasting an impressive Special Attack stat, Gholdengo provides Steel teams with a fantastic special attacker, which are scarce on said type. Nasty Plot lets Gholdengo overwhelm walls such as Gastrodon and Amoonguss. Shadow Ball is a fantastic STAB move that has great neutral coverage and allows Gholdengo to threaten Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Gallade. Focus Blast hits Dark-types that resist Shadow Ball like Kingambit and Ting-Lu. A single Nasty Plot boost enables Gholdengo's Focus Blast to OHKO physically defensive Ting-Lu after a layer of Spikes. The last slot is extremely flexible; Make It Rain is a powerful STAB move that hits harder than Shadow Ball against Dark-types like Grimmsnarl and Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Substitute can be used instead to give Gholdengo some security against faster threats that can take it out such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Recover is also another option to keep Gholdengo healthy, since it can be worn down fairly easily. Good as Gold allows Gholdengo to switch into status-using Pokemon like Sableye and Grimmsnarl, allowing Gholdengo to set up on them. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to switch into Pokemon like Great Tusk and Clodsire with ease as well as avoid Spikes as long as it stays intact. This allows Gholdengo to be a decent spinblocker as well.</p> <p>Kingambit is a fantastic partner, as it not only resists Dark-type moves directed at Gholdengo, but it also has STAB priority in Sucker Punch to threaten opposing Ghost-types that can take out Gholdengo such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane. Kingambit also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take on Breloom so as to not be revenge killed. Scizor appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take care of physical walls, allowing it to clean up with STAB Bullet Punch. Scizor can also pivot into Gholdengo on physical walls such as Skeledirge, allowing Gholdengo to threaten the opposing Pokemon easier. Nasty Plot Lucario is another fantastic partner thanks to its ability to get rid of Dark-types for Gholdengo and pressure special walls. Choice Scarf Iron Treads also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to break physical walls such as opposing Corviknight and Great Tusk early-game so that it can sweep late-game. Dual screens support from Klefki allows Gholdengo to have an easier time setting up and potentially sweeping. Another good partner for Gholdengo is Corviknight, as it removes entry hazards while also providing a Ground immunity once Air Balloon is gone. Corviknight can also run a Bulk Up or Iron Defense set that appreciates Pokemon like Skeledirge being taken care of while helping Gholdengo have an easier time breaking stall. Orthworm is another good choice, as it provides Shed Tail support as well as having access to Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong is also an amazing partner as well, as it can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also tank Fire-type moves thanks to Heatproof.</p>"

        "Nasty Plot (Ghost)": {
          "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a bulky setup sweeper for Ghost teams, leveraging its stellar typing and fantastic stats to break down walls such as Articuno, Hisuian Goodra lacking Flamethrower, and Corviknight, which Ghost teams struggle with. Its ability, Good as Gold blocks status moves such as Encore from Sableye and phazing from Empoleon, heavily aiding Gholdengo as a setup sweeper. Make It Rain's extra power makes it a notable option over Flash Cannon, as it OHKOes Ursaluna-B and Articuno at +2 and will always OHKO Flutter Mane and Baxcalibur. However, it can be stalled out by Pressure, and the Special Attack drop can provide setup opportunities for enemies such as Azumarill and Gliscor. Alternatively, Flash Cannon provides a less strong but more reliable STAB move that is extremely helpful in the Fairy and Ice matchup. 104 Speed EVs let Gholdengo outspeed threats like Adamant Scizor and Jolly Azumarill and most walls, including uninvested Gliscor and Articuno. A Bold nature prevents Alolan Muk from 2HKOing Gholdengo before the Air Balloon breaks, while a Modest nature provides Gholdengo with more favorable damage calculations, namely giving it a chance to OHKO Gliscor and Galarian Moltres with +2 Make It Rain and Scizor with a boosted Shadow Ball and knocking out Alolan Muk over two turns with Make It Rain after a Nasty Plot. An Air Balloon lets Gholdengo provide a unique defensive niche, walling out a lot of Ground-types like Gliscor variants with no attacking moves besides Earthquake, Landorus, and Quagsire as long as it isn't popped, protecting Gholdengo from Poltergeist users such as Brambleghast once the item is popped, and also making it a generally safe switch-in to block Mortal Spin from Earth Power Glimmora.</p> <p>Flutter Mane and Nasty Plot Spectrier appreciate Gholdengo's wallbreaking ability to remove roadblocks like Gliscor, Clodsire, and Articuno. In return, Gholdengo is able to take a hit from non-Choice-Band Chien-Pao and OHKO it back for its teammates. In return, Flutter Mane and Spectrier both act as cleaners and deal with faster-paced matchups like Fighting and Ghost for Gholdengo. Both are also able to remove Dark-types like Greninja, while Spectrier can lure and incapacitate Dark-types like Roaring Moon if using a Colbur Berry. Flutter Mane can also don a Choice Scarf, to deal with Dragapult and Chien-Pao. Gholdengo's vulnerability to Water- and Fire-type coverage is notable, so teammates like Sinistcha to readily deal with Dondozo and Skeledirge to take on Gastrodon and Volcarona benefit Gholdengo. Skeledirge, especially with Earth Power, puts in work in the Steel and Fire matchup, while Sinistcha helps in the Ground matchup, which Gholdengo does not fare well against. Both also have the ability to inflict burn on key walls like Alolan Muk, Clodsire, and Iron Hands, making it easier for Gholdengo to set up. Ceruledge is an exceptional teammate, as it deals with Gholdengo's nemesis, Heatran, and also put in work on matchups like Steel and Fire. Spikes support from Froslass and Brambleghast is also great, as this synergizes with Gholdengo's ability to block Defog; Froslass also is fast enough to deal with Landorus, while Brambleghast's entry hazard removal is rare on Ghost and is appreciated once Gholdengo's Air Balloon gets popped. Dragapult's great Speed tier enables it to fend off Choice Specs Flutter Mane or Choice Scarf Roaring Moon when equipped with a Choice Specs or Choice Scarf of its own, and it can pivot Gholdengo in against walls like Clodsire with U-turn, as well as burn Alolan Muk, Iron Hands, and Ting-Lu for it. Dragapult can also run a Choice Band set, allowing it to 2HKO Alolan Muk as well as take out opposing Ghost-types with Sucker Punch, or even a Dragon Dance set to threaten walls such as Clodsire that bother Gholdengo. Choice Scarf Hisuian Zoroark takes advantage of Gholdengo's Speed tier and typing with Illusion, luring and removing threats like Hisuian Samurott while also being able to eliminate Hoopa-U with U-turn. It is also able to lure in and heavily damage Ghost-types like Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Spectrier, which use their Ghost-type coverage to defeat Gholdengo. Mimikyu can serve as a check to threats like Hoopa-U and Hydreigon as well as a one-time answer to Darkrai, Greninja, and Chien-Pao using Disguise. In return Gholdengo takes on Corviknight, Iron Defense Iron Treads, and Galarian Weezing.</p>"

        "Choice Scarf (Ghost)": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gholdengo's ability to revenge kill threats such as Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao lacking Sucker Punch, and Dragapult, come into status-spreading Pokemon such as Klefki and Breloom due to Good as Gold, and inconvenience bulkier teams by preventing all forms of entry hazard removal with its ability and typing make it a prime pick for Ghost teams. Make it Rain greatly weakens Dark- and Normal-types such as Hydreigon and Indeedee, and it OHKOes Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao. Shadow Ball lets Gholdengo clean types such as Psychic and Ghost late-game. Trick neutralizes defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, which typically switch into it. The last move of choice is dependent on what the Ghost team lacks; Focus Blast gives the team another way to defeat Choice Specs Greninja, Thunderbolt cleans Water- and Flying-teams, or Nasty Plot which turns Gholdengo into a massive threat against bulkier teams especially after their main specially defensive wall has been given a Choice Scarf with Trick.</p> <p>As Gholdengo provides the needed revenge killing capabilities on Ghost teams, teammates such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult are free to run sets like Choice Specs and Dragon Dance, respectively. Both also break down walls such as Clodsire and Gastrodon; in return, Gholdengo deals with Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Gallade. Skeledirge walls most physical attackers and Fire-types such as Scovillain and Volcarona. Mimikyu provides a safety net against offensive types like rain Water and Ghost, checking Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane for the team, and it loves Gholdengo shutting down defensive walls such as Toxapex with Trick. Entry hazard setters in Brambleghast and Froslass are is also greatly appreciated, as they can set, remove, or prevent entry hazards for Gholdengo; in return, Gholdengo prevents their entry hazards from getting removed by Glimmora. Brambleghast also switches into Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and deals with Water-types like Gastrodon and Dondozo, while Froslass can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave and bring down an opposing Pokemon with its Destiny Bond.</p>"

Additionally, it provides plenty of support thanks to Good as Gold making both itself and its partner immune to status moves including  Amoonguss's Spore and Incineroar's Parting Shot. Make It Rain is Gholdengo's standout move as an exceptionally high-powered spread attack, taking down the likes of Chien-Pao and Glimmora easily as well as Rillaboom at +2. Shadow Ball pressures other Ghost-types such as Sinistcha and opposing Gholdengo effectively while also hitting Steel-resistant foes such as Ogerpon-H well. Gholdengo can choose to run Recover in lieu of Protect if the rest of the team can provide the latter, making it incredibly hard to remove. As Gholdengo wants to sit on the field for as long as possible, Leftovers is the primary recovery item chosen to maximize healing; however, Sitrus Berry is a fine option for more immediate HP recovery. Gholdengo's inability to hit Incineroar for any meaningful damage make partners such as Ogerpon-W and Landorus greatly appreciated. The given bulk EVs allow Gholdengo to survive Landorus-T's Stomping Tantrum, Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch, and Heatran's Flash Fire-boosted Lava Plume. Its Speed allows it to outrun Choice Scarf Landorus-T in Tailwind. Tera Dragon is generally preferred to resist both Ogerpon-H's and Ogerpon-W's STAB moves; however, Tera Water is also fine as a good defensive typing overall.</p> <h1>Notable Partners</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Support Pokemon</strong>: The likes of Incineroar, Amoonguss, and Indeedee-F help make Gholdengo shine, with Intimidate nullifying physical attackers almost entirely and Fake Out, Rage Powder, and Follow Me providing safe opportunities to use Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Other Setup Pokemon</strong>: Dragon Cheer Raging Bolt and Cosmic Power Deoxys-D appreciate Nasty Plot boosting their damage further, as well as the immunity to Taunt and Spore thanks to Good as Gold.

Dazzling Gleam is one of the best coverage options for Gholdengo, allowing it to deal significant damage to the plethora of Dragon-types in the metagame such as Raging Bolt and Walking Wake. Thunderbolt and Power Gem are alternative coverage options that improve Gholdengo's chances against Volcanion and Incineroar. Trick is an option that disrupts Trick Room setters such as Porygon2 as well as setup attackers like Iron Hands. Steel is Choice Specs Gholdengo's best Tera type, as it further boosts its strongest attack while also retaining its Dragon and Fairy resistances.

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its ability Good as Gold and excellent defensive typing that lets it set up on Pokemon like Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, and Clefable, Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a premier wallbreaker in SV OU. While Recover gives Gholdengo a way to stay in the battle for longer and leverage its defensive utility against the aforementioned threats, it also has a range of coverage moves to give it more options for wallbreaking. Psyshock is useful for breaking through special walls that would otherwise give Gholdengo trouble, like Blissey and Clodsire, and Focus Blast hits the many Dark-types in the tier, such as Darkrai, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit. Recover is generally used on bulkier teams, whereas Psyshock and Focus Blast are more useful for teams leaning towards offense. The Ground immunity granted by Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to set up in the face of Ground-types like Gliscor and Great Tusk, even spinblocking the latter in a pinch. Heavy-Duty Boots is another option on teams that lack any entry hazard removal. Gholdengo can make great use of a wide variety of Tera types, both for offensive and defensive purposes: Tera Fairy or Fighting gives it a sudden resistance to Dark, potentially mitigating the damage from moves like Knock Off, Crunch, and Sucker Punch from Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Kingambit, respectively. Tera Fairy gives it an additional Dragon immunity, whereas Tera Fighting gives Focus Blast an additional STAB boost. Tera Steel can give an additional boost to Make It Rain, as well as lessening the damage of Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult.</p> <p>Thanks to Good as Gold, any team can make great use of Gholdengo’s ability to spinblock and prevent Defog, but an offensive team would make the best use of its wallbreaking power. Offensive hazard-stacking cores featuring Pokemon such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S can use Gholdengo’s help to keep the pressure on. Powerful Pokemon that take advantage of the switches that Gholdengo forces, like Weavile and Meowscarada with Spikes, as well as other Nasty Plot wallbreakers like Darkrai provide support for Gholdengo to whittle down defensive cores. In addition, other special attackers that have access to utility tools like Knock Off to cripple their shared walls and Pokemon that would otherwise absorb Knock Off, such as Gliscor, Skarmory, Corviknight and Clefable, Darkrai, and Iron Valiant, synergize well with Gholdengo's ability to block all hazard removal. Without using Tera, Gholdengo struggles against the Dark-types that are so common in the tier, such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott. Having teammates resistant to Dark-type attacks, like Zamazenta and Enamorus, give Gholdengo some extra protection and a way to strike back against them. Even if it's using Air Balloon, having another Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Gliscor or Tornadus-T, is extremely helpful to mitigate that weakness. Gholdengo’s Speed tier is still slightly lacking when compared to the rest of the OU tier, leaving it vulnerable to fast threats such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Weavile. Having some speed control on the team, such as Choice Scarf Enamorous and Meowscarada or priority users like Weavile and Raging Bolt, to counteract these threats is extremely valuable.</p>"

Its bulk, typing, and access to reliable recovery give it multiple opportunities to pivot into various defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Corviknight, Galarian Slowking, and Clefable and make it a more reliable check to key offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Zamazenta. It can use its increased bulk to more safely set up a Nasty Plot while sustaining itself with Recover. Gholdengo possesses near perfect coverage with its STAB attacks, making it very difficult to respond to. Dazzling Gleam is an option over Make It Rain, as it deals high damage to Dark-types such as Hisuian Samurott, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon after a Nasty Plot boost. 60 Speed EVs allow Gholdengo to outspeed Jolly Kingambit and Azumarill, as well as uninvested Landorus-T; alternatively, 92 Speed EVs can allow Gholdengo to also outspeed uninvested Gliscor at the cost of losing a noticeable amount of bulk. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to avoid taking Spikes damage and Ground-type attacks from prominent Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Gliscor, letting it setup on these Pokemon and more safely pivot into Rapid Spin users such as the aforementioned Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to more reliably mitigate entry hazard damage and more frequently pivot into various defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory even after it has taken damage. Gholdengo is a fantastic Terastallization candidate in most matches, as it greatly benefits from neutralizing all of its weaknesses to gain a crucial free turn to setup a Nasty Plot or heal itself with Recover. Tera Fairy gives Gholdengo a better matchup against various Dark-types such as Roaring Moon, Weavile, and Meowscarada and boosts the power of Dazzling Gleam. Tera Flying lets it completely dominate Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu. Tera Water is an alternative option, improving Gholdengo's matchups against Heatran, Cinderace, and Volcarona, as well as Water-types such as Barraskewda and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Gholdengo fits quite well on bulky offense and balance teams as a spinblocker. Therefore, Spikes setters such as Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Skarmory, as well as Stealth Rock setters such as Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Landorus-T greatly appreciate Gholdengo's ability to block most forms of hazard removal. Offensive teammates also appreciate Gholdengo's presence due to its strong defensive profile and ability to absorb status moves. Kingambit in particular greatly benefits from Gholdengo's ability to block status moves and check Pokemon it struggles against such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant and can capitalize on Gholdengo luring and weakening its other checks such as Great Tusk. Iron Valiant similarly benefits from Gholdengo's ability to check Hatterene, and it can lure and weaken key checks to Gholdengo such as Clodsire and Volcarona with Psyshock. Gholdengo often struggles against offensive teams due to its poor matchup against many key threats such as Volcarona, Gouging Fire, Darkrai, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon. Great Tusk and Dondozo can help alleviate pressure by dealing with Kingambit and Gouging Fire while simultaneously benefiting from Gholdengo's defensive profile against faster special attackers such as Kyurem and Enamorus. Ting-Lu and Clodsire can handle the special attackers that give Gholdengo trouble, such as Volcarona and Dragapult, and accentuate Gholdengo's threat level with entry hazards. While Gholdengo is excellent at keeping entry hazards on the field, it can often struggle against opposing entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Clodsire, particularly if it is unable to Terastallize. Therefore, hazard removal support from Great Tusk is beneficial.</p>"

Teammates that benefit from Gholdengo's presence include Pokemon that appreciate its ability to handle fast and strong offensive threats. For instance, setup sweepers like Calm Mind Raging Bolt and Bulk Up Great Tusk can capitalize on Gholdengo's ability to revenge kill and weaken opposing threats like Dragapult and Choice Specs Enamorus, creating opportunities for Gholdengo's partners to set up and sweep. Great Tusk's access to Rapid Spin also synergizes well with Gholdengo, which is punished by Spikes, so getting rid of them gives Gholdengo more opportunities to switch in. Entry hazard setters like Gliscor, Skarmory, and Ting-Lu also benefit from Gholdengo's ability to serve as an emergency spinblocker. Moreover, both Gliscor and Great Tusk help in checking Gouging Fire, a foe that Gholdengo is weak to. Due to its vulnerability to Dark-type Pokemon like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott, exacerbated by its reliance on the inaccurate Focus Blast and the inherent risk of being Choice-locked, Gholdengo greatly benefits from the support of teammates that check the aforementioned foes, such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. Rillaboom also deserves a special mention as a teammate, as its Grassy Terrain weakens the super effective Earthquake, in addition to acting as a check to foes like Ting-Lu. In return, Gholdengo helps Rillaboom by handling threats that would otherwise be problematic for the latter, such as Skarmory. Gouging Fire is also a really good teammate for Gholdengo, since it appreciates Gholdengo's ability to exploit the passivity of some of its checks like Toxapex and Dondozo. It also checks Kingambit and offensive Fire-types, such as Volcarona and Cinderace, for Gholdengo.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Gholdengo's naturally good offensive presence, fantastic typing, and access to reliable recovery combine to make it a staple defensive piece. Hex can be run over Shadow Ball in conjunction with Thunder Wave to increase its maximum Base Power while spreading paralysis to support Gholdengo's teammates. Well-Baked Body allows Gholdengo to wall Pokemon reliant on Fire-type moves to beat it, such as Iron Moth, Cinderace, and Ogerpon-H lacking Knock Off. Similarly, Earth Eater handles opposing Ground-types such as non-Scrappy Great Tusk. Bulletproof is used to negate Shadow Ball from Gengar, Hisuian Zoroark, and opposing Gholdengo. Gholdengo's natural typing allows it to use nearly any immunity ability effectively, so options like Water Absorb and Volt Absorb can also be used depending on the needs of its team, although these are generally less effective. 28 Speed EVs are used to outspeed minimally invested Great Tusk, with the remaining EVs being used to maximize Gholdengo's physical bulk to better check physical attackers. Gholdengo is particularly vulnerable to Dark-types like Roaring Moon and Chien-Pao, and many Pokemon like Iron Boulder and Ogerpon-C run Dark-type coverage specifically to hit all variants of it. Thus, Pokemon that can take hits from Dark-type attackers such as Corviknight and Great Tusk make good partners. Gholdengo cannot check most special attackers, so it appreciates having special walls such as Swampert and Manaphy as teammates. Finally, Gholdengo can be taken advantage of and used for momentum by RegenVest Pokemon such as Swampert and Meloetta, so it appreciates strong wallbreakers such as Roaring Moon and Galarian Zapdos to bust through these walls.</p>"

Note that both are viable together if you're willing to give up a support move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: When paired together with Toxic Spikes, Protect and Substitute makes even foes that should beat Wo-Chien get worn down before they can KO it, such as Chi-Yu. Substitute itself protects Wo-Chien from slow users of Yawn such as Dondozo and Hippowdon, and slow OHKO moves from Ting-Lu, Dondozo, and Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ruination</strong>: Ruination gives Wo-Chien powerful chipping down potential, though it should never be used as Wo-Chien's only attack due to it being extremely difficult to KO with. When paired with Knock Off, it's especially useful against Wo-Chien mirror matches.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: With Stealth Rock support, Giga Drain OHKOes Iron Bundle and almost always 2HKOes Chien-Pao. If you allocate 60 EVs to Special Attack, Giga Drain will OHKO Iron Bundle regardless of Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt does an excellent job of surprising other Taunt Pokemon switching in, such as Annihilape and Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes Partners</strong>: Wo-Chien becomes far more deadly with Toxic Spikes support, letting it quickly wear down a wide variety of foes even faster.

Leech Seed reduces Wo-Chien's passivity while allowing teammates to heal after switching in. Ruination hits foes like Arceus-Fairy, Ting-Lu, and Giratina-O. Foul Play is a stronger alternative against physical attackers like Arceus and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground that also does a decent chunk of damage to Koraidon and Zacian-C and allows Wo-Chien to punish physical attackers that have Taunt. Knock Off gives Wo-Chien more of a niche due relevant Pokemon that learn it being rare, and it is useful against foes like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T. However, Arceus formes, which can absorb Knock Off without losing their items, are quite omnipresent. Protect lets Wo-Chien safely rack up Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery. Alternatively, Taunt shuts down setup and entry hazard Pokemon such as Arceus formes and Ting-Lu on the switch. Tera Poison gives Wo-Chien key resistances to attacks like Koraidon's Low Kick, Zacian-C's Play Rough, Double Dance Miraidon's Dazzling Gleam, and the omnipresent U-turn from foes like Landorus-T, Koraidon, and Miraidon while also offering an immunity to Toxic and letting Wo-Chien absorb Toxic Spikes. However, Tera Poison also makes Wo-Chien weak to Ground-type moves from Arceus-Ground and Psychic-type moves from Calyrex-S, respectively. Wo-Chien fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to check Calyrex-S and Arceus-Ground while offering good recovery via Leech Seed to teammates. Wo-Chien benefits from teammates such as Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Landorus-T, which check Koraidon and Zacian-C for it. Special attackers in Arceus-Fairy, Substitute Kyogre, and Eternatus trouble Wo-Chien, so offensive checks to them such as Zacian-C, Choice Scarf Koraidon, Arceus, and Calyrex-S are appreciated. Water Absorb Closdire as a defensive teammate checks Arceus-Fairy, Kyogre, and Eternatus while setting up hazards.</p>"

Icicle Crash is preferred over Ice Spinner for its flinch chance and higher Base Power, the latter of which—among other things—allows it to always 2HKO Sableye and bulky Great Tusk, while Ice Spinner may miss out on these 2HKOs. Crunch allows Chien-Pao to hit Skeledirge and Gholdengo—two problematic Pokemon for Ice teams. Sacred Sword and Brick Break both allow Chien-Pao to threaten Dark-, Steel-, and Ice-types such as Kingambit and opposing Chien-Pao. Sacred Sword is stronger and comes with the ability to ignore Defense boosts, while Brick Break removes Reflect and Light Screen, which is extremely helpful against teams with support from Grimmsnarl or Klefki. Psychic Fangs is an alternative option to Sacred Sword or Brick Break to hit Toxapex and Fighting-types such as Paldean Tauros-F. Sucker Punch is significantly stronger than Ice Shard and allows Chien-Pao to hit Pokemon like Gholdengo, Scizor, and Flutter Mane.</p> <p>This set very much appreciates Aurora Veil support from Abomasnow, as it allows Chien-Pao to set up on many Pokemon that would otherwise threaten it out as well as allowing it to survive revenge killing attempts from the likes of Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Extreme Speed Dragonite. Spikes support from Froslass is also greatly appreciated, as they wear down Pokemon that may otherwise be difficult for Chien-Pao to break, such as Dondozo and Klefki. Although Chien-Pao is able to fit on practically any team, it pairs especially well with other powerful sweepers such as Baxcalibur and Cloyster, weakening or even KOing their checks such as Air Balloon Gholdengo and Skeledirge. Baxcalibur in particular can take on Pokemon such as Toxapex and Paldean Tauros-F with a powerful Earthquake, allowing Chien-Pao to KO them and sweep the opposing team; furthermore, Choice Band Baxcalibur pressures Chien-Pao answers such as Quagsire and Corviknight. Baxcalibur's Thermal Exchange also allows it to switch into Will-O-Wisp that would cripple Chien-Pao as well as be an emergency switch-in to a Fire-type attack. Shell Smash Cloyster appreciates the removal of Skeledirge and Froslass.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band Wallbreaker (Ice)": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Band Chien-Pao is a potent mid-game threat, powerful wallbreaker, and good late-game cleaner. Additionally, it is capable of breaking through physically defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Quagsire, both of which tend to be tough matchups for many other Ice staples. Icicle Crash is preferred over Ice Spinner for its flinch chance and slightly higher Base Power, notably being favored to 2HKO Azumarill and OHKO offensive Pelipper, neither of which are feats Ice Spinner is capable of. Sacred Sword and Brick Break provide crucial coverage for Pokemon such as Kingambit and opposing Chien-Pao, and Sucker Punch allows Chien-Pao to KO faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p> <p>This set heavily appreciates Spikes from Froslass to wear down its switch-ins, sometimes allowing it to grab KOs it would otherwise miss out on; for example, Crunch always 2HKOes physically defensive Toxapex with one layer of Spikes, but it is favored to not 2HKO without any Spikes. Rapid Spin support from Avalugg is also appreciated, allowing Chien-Pao more opportunities to enter the field. Since this set focuses on opening holes in teams, setup sweepers are excellent partners for it, as Chien-Pao can dent or remove their checks to allow the sweep to happen much more easily. Shell Smash Cloyster in particular appreciates Chien-Pao's ability to beat Gholdengo and significantly damage other Pokemon such as Corviknight that Cloyster may otherwise struggle to break through. Dragon Dance Baxcalibur appreciates Chien-Pao's ability to 2HKO Quagsire and physically defensive Corviknight, which normally would stop Baxcalibur in its tracks. Finally, Belly Drum Cetitan appreciates Chien-Pao's ability to break Unaware walls such as Skeledirge and Quagsire; in return, Cetitan acts as speed control if snow is in effect, aiding in Chien-Pao's weakness to Choice Scarf users such as Iron Moth.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band (Dark)": {
          "description": "<p>Chien-Pao is a weapon of destruction for Dark teams, boasting a lofty Speed tier that allows it to outspeed most Pokemon in the metagame like Spectrier, Sneasler, and Tornadus-T. Icicle Crash helps significantly in the Flying matchup, 2HKOing Articuno and defensive Corviknight after Stealth Rock, thus preventing any Flying Pokemon from switching in safely, and in the Dragon matchup, OHKOing Walking Wake after Stealth Rock and 2HKOing Hisuian Goodra. Icicle Crash also OHKOes foes like Ursaluna-B, 2HKOes foes like defensive Great Tusk, and secures a 2HKO on defensive Quagsire. Crunch helps in securing an OHKO on Colbur Berry Spectrier and 2HKOing bulkier foes like Hatterene and mixed Toxapex after one layer of Spikes. Ice Shard's priority allows Chien-Pao to OHKO faster targets such as Dragapult and Choice Scarf Enamorus, Landorus, Meowscarada, and Flutter Mane after Stealth Rock. Sacred Sword allows Chien-Pao to secure an OHKO on foes like Kingambit, Choice Specs Greninja, Mamoswine, and Baxcalibur. It also allows Chien-Pao to hit opposing Chien-Pao, albeit with the threat of a Speed tie.</p> <p>Chien-Pao appreciates Mandibuzz's Defog support to prevent it from being worn down by entry hazards. It can also bring Chien-Pao in safely using a slow U-turn. Mandibuzz is a great switch-in for Fighting-type attacks from enemies like Choice Scarf Sneasler and Choice Scarf Great Tusk as well, which Chien-Pao is extremely vulnerable to, as well as being capable of checking setup sweepers like Azumarill and Scizor with Foul Play. In return, Chien-Pao deals with opponents like Sandy Shocks and Baxcalibur, which can cause problems for Mandibuzz. Kingambit has impressive offensive synergy with Chien-Pao due to its neutrality to Fairy-type attacks, being able to eliminate foes like Hatterene with Iron Head and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock. In return, Chien-Pao hits threats to Kingambit like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Iron Treads, Landorus-T, and defensive Gliscor, whose Earthquake can prove disadvantageous for Kingambit. Sableye is a great teammate for Chien-Pao, as its Fighting-type immunity helps it switch directly into attacks from threats like Iron Hands and Zamazenta. Paired with Prankster, Sableye can easily burn threats to Chien-Pao like Azumarill and the aforementioned Fighting-types and paralyze foes like Dragapult, Volcarona, Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, allowing Chien-Pao to break them with ease. Sableye also offers Knock Off support against foes like Articuno and Toxapex, which will suffer damage from hazards after the removal of Heavy-Duty Boots. Greninja is also a great teammate for Chien-Pao due to its excellent coverage, being able to OHKO Fire-type threats like Volcarona and Ogerpon-H after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump and outspeed Choice Scarf users like Enamorus and Galarian Zapdos and eliminate them with Ice Beam when running Choice Scarf itself. Choice Scarf Greninja also takes care of opposing Chien-Pao and Kingambit with Low Kick, while Extrasensory 2HKOes threats like physically defensive Toxapex and Zamazenta and secures an OHKO on Okidogi. In return, Chien-Pao deals with Ogerpon-W, Alolan Muk, and Articuno, which can take advantage of Greninja. Choice Scarf Meowscarada boasts great synergy with Choice Band Chien-Pao, allowing fast pivoting with U-turn and sweeping in the Dark mirror with the help of Play Rough. It also threatens Quagsire, Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Urshifu-R, and Quaquaval with Flower Trick. In return, Chien-Pao breaks foes like Clodsire, Kingambit, Alolan Muk, and opposing Chien-Pao that can hamper Meowscarada's ability to sweep. Teammates like Ting-Lu and Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes for Chien-Pao, boosting its wallbreaking ability and breaking potential Focus Sashes from opponents like Ceruledge. Alolan Muk absorbs Fairy-type attacks from foes like Flutter Mane, Enamorus, and Hatterene for Chien-Pao and threatens them with Poison Jab. Overqwil, on the other hand, switches in against opposing Chien-Pao and Meowscarada with the help of Intimidate and threatens them back with Barb Barrage. Teammates like Galarian Moltres and Hydreigon are other alternatives that can help break foes like defensive Great Tusk and Heatran, which Chien-Pao appreciates. Hydreigon can switch into Fire-type moves aimed at Chien-Pao from foes like Moltres and Ceruledge and set Stealth Rock to facilitate its wallbreaking.</p>"

          "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its high Attack and Speed, and incredible ability in Sword of Ruin, Chien-Pao is one of the strongest physical attackers in the game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Icicle Crash</strong>: While Ice Spinner is perfectly accurate, Icicle Crash’s higher power and flinch chance makes it the preferred attack. Additionally, not being a contact move allows Chien-Pao to avoid unnecessary chip damage from Rocky Helmet users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sucker Punch versus Crunch</strong>: Sucker Punch offers priority with a strong base power at the cost of necessitating prediction, while Crunch is a more standard attack whose Defense drop can allow Chien-Pao to potentially break through bulky foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Shard</strong>: Ice Shard is a more consistent albeit weaker alternative to Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sacred Sword</strong>: Sacred Sword provides coverage for Pokemon that resist one or both of Chien-Pao’s STAB attacks, like Chi-Yu and other Chien-Pao, plus its Chien-Pao's best shot against Porygon2. Additionally, ignoring defense boosts allows Chien-Pao to deal more consistent damage to foes who boost their Defense like Archaludon and Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psychic Fangs</strong>: Psychic Fangs rips up Dual Screens, which makes Focus Sash Chien-Pao's match-up against Alolan Ninetales more favorable. Otherwise, it does good damage to Primarina, Urshifu-R, and Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant gives Chien-Pao a significant power boost for sniping Pokemon with Sucker Punch, but Jolly is important for Speed tying with Flutter Mane and opposing Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>0-1 SpA IV</strong>: If using Tera Blast on Jolly Chien-Pao, make sure to to use a SpA IV that's 0-1. This is because if Flutter Mane uses Charm, any SpA IV that's higher will result in Tera Blast becoming a Special Attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: While it can be difficult to fit and very reliant on Focus Sash, Swords Dance boosts Chien-Pao’s Attack to unwallable levels, making it a very potent sweeper.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lash Out</strong>: Lash Out is a situational but powerful response to Charm Flutter Mane and Breaking Swipe Gouging Fire thanks to the doubled BP on the turn Chien-Pao's Attack is lowered.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sheer Cold</strong>: While it may seem alluring, Sheer Cold is a very risky slot on this set, as its standard attacks already hit most relevant foes. Even if Chien-Pao fails to KO a foe, it will generally leave it within range for a teammate.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Chien-Pao offers power in spades without needing to Terastallize, only needing it on very rare occasions to break past specific walls or dodge priority moves aimed at it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric can be used in tandem with Tera Blast to improve Chien-Pao’s matchup against key threats such as Urshifu-R and Primarina while also making it immune to paralysis.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost doesn’t offer much offensive benefit, but it allows Chien-Pao to dodge Normal-type priority from Dragonite, Ogerpon formes, and Entei, which can be particularly useful if using Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Stellar's one-time boost per attacking type can open up new sweeping opportunities for Chien-Pao, especially for Life Orb sets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass lets Chien-Pao survive Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes, which otherwise threatens to OHKO through Focus Sash. Combined with Tera Blast, Chien-Pao still threatens big damage into Urshifu-R and Primarina.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosts Sucker Punch to extreme power levels while making Crunch exceptionally difficult to switch into without a resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice can allow Chien-Pao to finish foes off with Ice Shard from higher ranges and makes Icicle Crash an even more formidable tool.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: This is the most reliable item for Chien-Pao, flipping many potential match-ups such as offensive Flutter Mane, and makes Chien-Pao much easier to switch-in at least once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb makes Chien-Pao a terrifying sweeper and wall-breaker in one, 2HKOing the vast majority of the metagame!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: While Sitrus Berry may seem strange on such an offensive Pokemon, it can save Tera Electric Chien-Pao from being OHKOed by Adamant Choice Scarf Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes. 36 HP and 36 Defense EVs can be used to guarantee this, but even without investment, Chien-Pao has around a 93% chance of surviving.</p> </li> </ul>"

Sucker Punch is one of the most powerful priority moves in the metagame, but falters against support moves like Substitute and Thunder Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sacred Swords versus Psychic Fangs</strong>: Sacred Sword gives Chien-Pao useful coverage against bulky foes like Porygon2 and Archaludon, as well as opposing Chien-Pao. Psychic Fang's coverage is worse, but it hits the important Urshifu-R and Primarina, as well as breaking dual screens.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Chien-Pao is already plenty powerful, Choice Band combined with Tera can elevate 2HKOs to OHKOs on some of the bulkiest walls in the meta. For this reason, Tera can be worth using on Choice Band sets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark turns Choice Band Crunch into a devastating wallbreaker move that few can withstand, OHKOing Max HP Annihilape, Entei, and Scizor if using an Adamant nature. Neutralizing Chien-Pao’s Steel-type weakness also makes it less vulnerable to Scizor’s Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice gives Choice Band Icicle Crash enough power to challenge even physically defensive Ting-Lu, having approximately a 69% chance to OHKO if using an Adamant nature; be warned, however, that Ting-Lu often Terastallizes in front of Chien-Pao, making this inconsistent. The extra power behind Ice Shard is also a welcome boost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy combined with Choice Band Tera Blast handily defeats some of Chien-Pao's less common checks, OHKOing standard variants of Annihilape and Urshifu formes. It also removes several weaknesses, most notably turning Chien-Pao's 4x Fighting-type weakness into a resistance. Make sure to use a Special Attack IV of 0 or 1 to avoid Charm flipping Tera Blast into a Special Attack!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>20 HP / 228 Atk / 12 Def / 60 SpD / 188 Spe Adamant</strong>: This spread allows Chien-Pao to survive all but the highest damage rolls from Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed, and Modest Ursaluna-B's Vacuum Wave. The Speed investment outspeeds Jolly Ogerpon formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe Jolly</strong>: This spread just attempts to speedtie with Flutter Mane and opposing Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "overview": "<p>Ting-Lu's titanic bulk makes it the premier special wall and check to Miraidon in Ubers. Unlike Arceus-Ground and Clodsire, Ting-Lu is able to take on Miraidon and generate momentum in the process thanks to Vessel of Ruin and a fantastic support movepool featuring Spikes, Ruination, and Whirlwind. Other special threats such as Calm Mind Arceus-Ground and offensive Eternatus are hurt in viability by Ting-Lu's presence alone. Ting-Lu's physical bulk should not be underestimated either, as it can take on threats like Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM and Zekrom when needed. These incredible defenses come at the cost of lacking any form of reliable recovery, making Ting-Lu extremely vulnerable to entry hazard damage, Knock Off, and status. As such, some teams may prefer either Clodsire due to its superior role compression in checking Kyogre, absorbing Toxic Spikes, and ability to run Heavy-Duty Boots or Arceus-Ground for its better offensive presence and reliable recovery. Effective use of Ting-Lu requires careful management of its so that it fulfills its role of setting entry hazards early-game and staying healthy enough to check threats late-game.</p>",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots may be run over Leftovers, as it better preserves Ting-Lu's longevity should Spikes be set on its side of the field. However, Leftovers is usually preferred, as Ting-Lu itself likes to tank some hits early-game to set its own Spikes, and Heavy-Duty Boots removes Ting-Lu's only form of healing. Taunt is an option to harass opposing Ting-Lu and prevent setup from incoming Pokemon such as Gliscor, but Whirlwind can achieve similar results and offers more utility for checking threats.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gliscor</strong>: Gliscor is the most notable threat to Ting-Lu, as it can heal off any Ruination damage with Poison Heal and use it as an easy chance to set entry hazards or use Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Ting-Lu is completely vulnerable to all forms of entry hazard and status effect chip damage, which can rack up quickly thanks to its lack of recovery.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off from Necrozma-DM and Gliscor removes Ting-Lu's only form of recovery, devastating Ting-Lu's longevity.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Despite Ting-Lu's massive physical bulk, it is vulnerable to super effective coverage from strong physical attackers like Koraidon, Zacian-C, Calyrex-I, Kyurem-B, and Chien-Pao. Also, Ho-Oh is immune to Earthquake and can heal off Ruination damage with Regenerator while being able to cripple Ting-Lu with a burn from Sacred Fire. These threats may come in on Ting-Lu easily with support from U-turn Miraidon.</p> <p><strong>Kyogre</strong>: Kyogre is one of the few special attackers that is not bothered by Ting-Lu thanks to its rain-boosted STAB Water-type attacks, although it hates directly switching in.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt prevents Ting-Lu from using Spikes and Whirlwind, so Taunt users like Arceus-Ground and Landorus-T can prove severely annoying.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Whirlwind prevents opposing setup threats such as Double Dance Miraidon and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground from snowballing out of control. This can also rack up entry hazard damage and is a decent way to maintain momentum against an incoming Gliscor. Protect can also be used in this moveslot, which allows for more Leftovers recovery and scouting of Choice item users and Tera types. Stealth Rock may be chosen in the fourth slot to save moveslots for Ting-Lu's teammates, but it makes Ting-Lu less reliable at checking threats in general. Ting-Lu will very rarely need to Terastallize, as its natural typing provides a strong Electric immunity against Miraidon. Tera Steel provides a Fairy and Dragon resistance, which can be critical for handling Calm Mind + Tera Fairy or Tera Dragon Miraidon sets. It has the additional benefit of an immunity to Toxic from Gliscor and Eternatus. Tera Fairy provides a Dragon immunity against Miraidon, allowing Ting-Lu to better answer Tera Dragon sets holding either Calm Mind or Choice Specs while making Ting-Lu resistant or immune to Koraidon's STAB moves. However, this comes at the expense of not resisting Fairy versus Tera Fairy Miraidon. Tera Poison is useful against Koraidon, Zacian-C, and Tera Fairy Miraidon, and it allows Ting-Lu to absorb Toxic Spikes. Tera Water allows Ting-Lu to take Kyogre's STAB moves while also resisting Koraidon's Flare Blitz and Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike. It also lets Ting-Lu check the rare, but otherwise hard to check, Chi-Yu and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Ting-Lu struggles against physical threats such as Koraidon, Zacian-C, and Arceus, so it is best paired with Pokemon that can switch into them reliably such as defensive Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Fairy, Gliscor, Arceus-Water, Skeledirge, and Landorus-T. Gliscor deserves special mention, as it can allow Ting-Lu to run Stealth Rock or alternatively allow Gliscor itself to run Toxic Spikes, forming an impressive hazard-stacking core. Necrozma-DM is also notable for having Knock Off, which makes Ting-Lu's Spikes even more deadly. Fairy-types like Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, and Flutter Mane are useful for their Dragon immunity, which forces Miraidon to predict between its Dragon- and Electric-type coverage, potentially allowing Ting-Lu to switch in for free. Eternatus and Arceus-Grass are valuable teammates for their ability to take on Kyogre, with Eternatus notably absorbing Toxic Spikes, which severely threaten Ting-Lu. Giratina-O is a great partner that can check Arceus-Ground and Extreme Killer Arceus while providing Defog support, which massively increases Ting-Lu's longevity. Revenge killers like Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon greatly appreciate chip damage from Ting-Lu's Ruination and Spikes for cleaning up weakened teams, and they may take on Miraidon should Ting-Lu not be healthy enough to do so.</p>"

Spikes are used to hit grounded Stealth Rock-resistant Pokemon like Kingambit and Gholdengo harder, while Stealth Rock can be used instead to damage Spikes-immune Pokemon like Enamorus and Corviknight that repeatedly switch into Ting-Lu, as well as punish Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Booster Energy Gouging Fire and Choice Specs Kyurem. Thanks to its huge bulk, Ting-Lu is able to take super effective hits from setup sweepers like Volcarona, Kyurem, and Iron Boulder and phaze them with Whirlwind in return; in addition to this, Whirlwind forces in opposing Pokemon, which will take damage from Ting-Lu's hazards unless they hold Heavy-Duty Boots. Ruination deals meaningful damage to switch-ins like Rillaboom, Great Tusk, and Hatterene, while Stone Edge can be run instead to allow Ting-Lu to OHKO Volcarona and hit Flying-types like Dragonite and Zapdos. Tera Poison is used to help Ting-Lu better check Fairy- and Fighting-types like Enamorus, Zamazenta, and especially Iron Valiant and grant it an immunity to Toxic, while Tera Ghost can be run instead to nullify Ting-Lu's Fighting-type weakness and allow it to spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads, though this comes at the cost of being weak to Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult as well as Dark-types like Darkrai, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon that Ting-Lu would otherwise check.</p> <p>Ting-Lu fits well as a support option on nearly any balance team. Offensive partners like Dragapult, Gouging Fire, and Kyurem appreciate entry hazard support to make foes easier to KO, while physically defensive partners like Dondozo and Skarmory benefit from Ting-Lu's ability to handle special attackers like Gholdengo and Raging Bolt. Skarmory is particularly notable for forming a strong defensive hazard-stacking core with Ting-Lu, being able to switch into Pokemon like Meowscarada and Weavile that threaten it. Aside from being potent late-game cleaners that appreciate Ting-Lu spreading chip damage early-game, offensive partners like Weavile and Meowscarada pair well, since they're able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon with Knock Off to make Ting-Lu's hazard stacking more effective as well as pressure Gliscor, which Ting-Lu struggles significantly against. Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo are both great defensive partners for Ting-Lu to handle Fairy-types like Hatterene and Iron Valiant, with the former able to provide additional pressure with Future Sight and the latter also able to block hazard removal.</p>"

Ruination allows Ting-Lu to quickly wear down the likes of opposing Ting-Lu, Hatterene, and Dragonite, while Body Press may be used to deal more damage to Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Hydreigon. Spikes or Stealth Rock in conjunction with Whirlwind sets Ting-Lu apart from other entry hazard setters; it's capable of wearing down the opponent's defensive core and weakens threats such as Greninja, Meowscarada, and Baxcalibur.

Furthermore, Choice Scarf Great Tusk removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Sableye and Brambleghast via Knock Off to enhance Ting-Lu's phazing, which enables Clodsire and Gastrodon as entry hazard setters to wither down threats such as Greninja and Ceruledge more efficiently. Water Absorb Clodsire adds a Water immunity, can switch into attacks from Greninja, Quaquaval, and Meowscarada, and helps wear down the opposing team with Toxic Spikes or Toxic. Gastrodon walls Water-type Pokemon like Pelipper, Dondozo, and Rotom-W and assists with spreading entry hazards. Iron Treads eases Ting-Lu's pivoting by removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin and checks Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Hatterene.

Ting-Lu also functions as an exceptional entry hazard setter, as it can easily set up Stealth Rock and Spikes against threats such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Heatran.

In addition, thanks to its ability, its well-distributed stats, and Shore Up, it is able to check many attackers such as Iron Moth, Ceruledge, and Garganacl. Spikes should be used if reliability and lack of PP are a concern, especially on stall teams. Precipice Blades maximizes damage against Toxapex and other Ground-weak Pokemon like Iron Hands; however, Earthquake is a fine option if accuracy is a concern. There are multiple options for the last moveslot: Parting Shot lets Ting-Lu safely bring in offensive teammates via a slow pivot, Foul Play gives it a better matchup against setup sweepers like Salamence, Whirlwind phazes setup sweepers that Ting-Lu can't handle like non-Taunt Annihilape, and Knock Off can remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots from pivots like Tyranitar. Covert Cloak prevents Ting-Lu from being poisoned from Mortal Spin users like Toxapex, while Leftovers gives to it more passive recovery. Both Tera Ghost and Tera Poison allow Ting-Lu to surprise Fighting-types like Iron Hands; Tera Poison grants it an immunity to Toxic and lets it resist Grass-type attacks, while Tera Ghost allows it to spinblock. Alternatively, Tera Fairy and Tera Water provide great resistances to Roaring Moon and Palafin, respectively. Ting-Lu fits in a variety of teams, ranging from bulky offense to stall. Offensive teammates such as Iron Valiant, Palafin, and Iron Hands appreciate that Ting-Lu can both set Spikes and act as a slow pivot with Parting Shot. These three Pokemon also beat Great Tusk, one of Ting-Lu's biggest checks, as it is able to beat it with Fighting-type moves and remove its entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Dondozo are able to check Pokemon that Ting-Lu can't, which include Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Mimikyu. Ting-Lu struggles to make progress with entry hazards up, so entry hazard removal from the likes of Great Tusk, Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Corviknight is recommended.</p>"

An incredible defensive profile allows Ting-Lu to be a consistent, valuable check to Calyrex-S, Miraidon, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Taunt prevents Arceus formes from setting up or healing and shuts down Toxapex. Ruination reduces Ting-Lu's passivity and hits Giratina-O and Landorus-T. Earthquake hits Miraidon and prevents Zacian-C from safely switching in, while Payback OHKOes Calyrex-S and—with Ting-Lu's low Speed—consistently has 100 Base Power. Whirlwind can be used over Taunt or Ruination on teams that are more vulnerable to setup sweepers like Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Fissure is a niche alternative over Ruination that helps with Taunt Arceus formes and is more of a threat to setup Pokemon. Tera Grass, Poison, and Steel all allow it to resist Calyrex-S's Grass Knot and offer varying defensive utility, with Tera Grass helping with Kyogre and Arceus-Ground, Tera Poison helping with Koraidon and Toxic Spikes, and Tera Steel helping with Arceus and Miraidon. Ting-Lu's defensive utility and the pressure brought by its entry hazards are appreciated by nearly every team bar hyper offense. Ting-Lu is vulnerable to strong physical attackers like Zacian-C and Koraidon, so teammates that can check them, like Landorus-T on bulky offense teams and Toxapex and Skeledirge on balance teams, make for natural partners. Extreme Killer Arceus is a great partner that helps check Calyrex-S and appreciates Ting-Lu's Spikes bringing opposing Pokemon into Extreme Speed range.

Tera Blast Fairy is an option if Chi-Yu instead wants to OHKO Palkia-O and Arceus-Dark. Good teammates for Chi-Yu include fast wallbreakers like Zacian, Palkia-O, and Deoxys that can help make up for its middling Speed.

Beads of Ruin also not only indirectly makes Chi-Yu hit harder but also empowers its special attacking teammates, with Iron Bundle and Gholdengo in particular being excellent partners due to their ability to either overwhelm shared checks like Ting-Lu or outright beat some of Chi-Yu's checks, such as Garchomp for the former and Glimmora for the latter. Furthermore, Chi-Yu has very good Speed, allowing it to naturally outspeed a considerable portion of the metagame. However, Chi-Yu is not without glaring weaknesses, as its HP and Defense are absurdly low, which leaves it vulnerable to common priority moves such as Palafin's Jet Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. In addition, despite Dark / Fire being a good type combination offensively, it leaves Chi-Yu vulnerable defensively, as its weaknesses to Ground-, Rock- and Water-type moves in addition to Stealth Rock compromise its ability to switch in and fire off more attacks. Finally, Pokemon such as Glimmora, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp have the ability to potentially switch into Chi-Yu and threaten it out, with Ting-Lu's Tablets of Ruin being a particular annoyance due to it offsetting Beads of Ruin.

        "Dragon Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Roaring Moon is one of the tier's most dangerous sweepers due to its fantastic Attack and Speed complemented further by its decent bulk, a great typing both offensively and defensively, and diverse coverage options that dramatically limit its defensive counterplay. Acrobatics, thanks to its perfect synergy with Booster Energy, boasts excellent coverage alongside Knock Off by giving Roaring Moon an incredibly powerful option to super effectively hit threats like Great Tusk as well as Ogerpon-W, Serperior, and Rillaboom without the need to Dragon Dance; between it and Knock Off, Roaring Moon hits much of the tier for at least neutral damage, which is often enough for it to clean up late-game. Earthquake OHKOes threats that can survive a boosted Knock Off or Acrobatics, such as offensive Kingambit, Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, and Iron Treads. Taunt drastically improves Roaring Moon's matchup against defensive teams by preventing threats like Dondozo, Ting-Lu, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Skarmory from disrupting its sweep with their recovery, status, or setup moves; Taunt is still useful against more offensive teams by virtue of preventing Serperior from stopping Roaring Moon's sweep with Glare, denying Glimmora multiple layers of entry hazards, or preventing setup sweepers like Tera Fairy Gouging Fire and Kyurem from surviving a hit and setting up against it. Brick Break is an interesting alternative; it outright OHKOes Weavile and defensive Kingambit, hits Darkrai and opposing Roaring Moon super effectively, and greatly improves Roaring Moon's matchup against opposing dual screens or Aurora Veil teams. Tera Flying grants Roaring Moon some noteworthy defensive benefits, including turning its Fighting weakness into a resistance and granting it a Ground immunity, but its greatest benefit is giving Roaring Moon access to the absurd power of STAB Acrobatics; with the boost from Tera Flying, Roaring Moon can OHKO max HP Great Tusk without even needing a boost from Dragon Dance while having a chance to OHKO Zamazenta after a Dragon Dance. A Jolly nature is preferred to outpace Booster Energy Iron Valiant after a Dragon Dance, but the power increase from an Adamant nature is enough to OHKO bulky Kingambit and Assault Vest Archaludon with Earthquake without any chip damage while securing more reliable KOs against Zamazenta and bulkier Great Tusk variants.</p> <p>Roaring Moon is a staple on fast-paced hyper offense teams that can help facilitate its sweep, though on these teams it can also serve as a wallbreaker to help facilitate other setup sweepers as needed. Hisuian Samurott and Glimmora can reliably set up entry hazards to help Roaring Moon secure OHKOs against bulky Kingambit and Archaludon without needing to commit to an Adamant nature, while dual screens setters like Deoxys-S, Alolan Ninetales, and Grimmsnarl can allow Roaring Moon to set up more safely, grant it a safety net against strong priority from the likes of Weavile and Tera Normal Dragonite, or even allow Roaring Moon to set up multiple Dragon Dances and devastate opposing offensive teams. Deoxys-S is a particularly excellent teammate for Roaring Moon; it can act as a fast dual screens setter, an entry hazard setter that can deny opposing hazards while bypassing Hatterene's Magic Bounce with Skill Swap, or a standalone offensive threat that can help overwhelm threats like Dondozo, Skarmory, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge with its excellent coverage while allowing Roaring Moon to maximize its own coverage instead of running Taunt. Fast Booster Energy users like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder synergize well with Roaring Moon; Roaring Moon can serve as more of a wallbreaker alongside these threats, using its high immediate damage output and Knock Off to wear down or eliminate threats like Gholdengo, Clodsire, Dondozo, and Corviknight to enable their late-game sweeps. Volcarona is also an excellent teammate, as it handles Steel-types like Corviknight and Skarmory that Roaring Moon may struggle with and appreciates Roaring Moon's ability to brute force past walls like Clodsire, Blissey, specially defensive Skeledirge, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Slowking in return, particularly if it is running Taunt. Even other Dragon Dance users, such as Gouging Fire, Kyurem, and Dragonite, can help overwhelm physical walls that Roaring Moon may struggle with while utilizing their alternate defensive profiles to cover Roaring Moon's shortcomings. Gouging Fire's burn immunity makes it useful against Volcarona, Skeledirge, and Will-O-Wisp Rotom-W, while its excellent physical bulk makes it very difficult to revenge kill with priority moves from Dragonite and Weavile; Kyurem fits well on Aurora Veil teams alongside Roaring Moon thanks to its tremendous physical bulk while snow is active, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed acts as a strong priority attack to deal with opposing priority users like Weavile and Raging Bolt, which can revenge kill Roaring Moon with Ice Shard and Thunderclap, respectively. Kingambit greatly appreciates Roaring Moon's ability to pressure Fire-types like Cinderace and Volcarona, and in return its great bulk and typing can allow it to handle threats like Weavile and Meowscarada lacking Low Kick. Lastly, Roaring Moon can fit reasonably well on Psychic Terrain teams spearheaded by Indeedee; Psychic Terrain keeps Roaring Moon safe from opposing priority attacks until it activates Tera Flying, and such a playstyle helps facilitate offensive threats that Roaring Moon already synergizes well with such as Volcarona, Iron Boulder, and Expanding Force Deoxys-S.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Band Roaring Moon is an elite physical wallbreaker on sun teams thanks to its phenomenal Attack and great Speed stats, either of which can be further boosted by its Protosynthesis. Knock Off is extremely spammable and difficult to safely switch into, giving Roaring Moon a strong STAB move that can even support the rest of its team with item removal. Outrage is a brutally strong STAB move that is impossible to switch into without a Fairy-type, easily allowing Roaring Moon to break past physical walls like Gliscor and Dondozo. Iron Head is used to hit Fairy-types such as Clefable and Enamorus for super effective damage; however Earthquake is an alternative to Iron Head that allows Roaring Moon to hit Steel-types, particularly Archaludon and Kingambit for super effective damage. U-turn is pivotal for maintaining momentum, allowing it to safely bring in threats such as Walking Wake onto the field. 220 Attack EVs and maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature are necessary for Roaring Moon to attain a boost to its Speed via Protosynthesis, allowing it to always outspeed Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Enamorus. Alternatively, simply running maximum Attack and Speed EVs gives Roaring Moon an Attack boost through its Protosynthesis, letting it 2HKO Skarmory with Knock Off and Dondozo with Outrage, alongside always netting an OHKO on Kingambit with Earthquake. Tera Dark is the premier Tera type for this set, as it powers up Knock Off to unprecedented levels of power, inflicting heavy damage on Gliscor, Skarmory, and even Clefable, whereas Tera Steel can be used to gain STAB on Iron Head and to withstand Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks.</p> <p>This set functions best on sun teams, leveraging Torkoal to set the sun for Roaring Moon to take advantage of, with the former also checking Bug-, Ice-, and Fairy-types for the latter. Roaring Moon is vulnerable to repeated chip damage from entry hazards, which can wear it down very quickly if left unchecked. Hatterene and Great Tusk are much appreciated forms of hazard control that can also check some of the threats Roaring Moon struggles against, with Hatterene forcing out Dragon- and Fighting-types, namely Dragonite, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta, and Great Tusk being able to force out Kingambit while generally acting as a reliable physical tank. Venusaur and Kingambit also pair very well with Roaring Moon on sun, with Venusaur forcing Primarina and Great Tusk out alongside Kingambit's reliability in taking on Meowscarada and Swords Dance Weavile. In return, Roaring Moon is able to soften up the opposing team for Venusaur and Kingambit to clean up in the late-game. Walking Wake and Raging Bolt can form an incredibly potent wallbreaking core with Roaring Moon, as both appreciate its Knock Off crippling their checks, and Raging Bolt can form a potent pivoting core with Roaring Moon that can easily take advantage of forced switch-ins. Gouging Fire also appreciates checks such as Gliscor and Dondozo being worn down, giving it an easier time sweeping teams in mid- or late-game scenarios.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Iron Valiant serves as a potent special wallbreaker, using its power and solid coverage to break through a majority of the metagame, most notably Pokemon like Garganacl, Heatran, and Great Tusk. Focus Blast is preferred for its power, allowing Iron Valiant to break through neutral targets and prevent the opponent from playing around its coverage, though Aura Sphere can be used instead for its higher consistency, albeit missing the OHKO on Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Heatran. Thunderbolt catch switch-ins to Iron Valiant's STAB moves such as Moltres and Toxapex. Psyshock allows Iron Valiant to hit Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur, Clodsire, and Iron Moth, as well as also hitting and Toxapex. Vacuum Wave is also another option that allows Iron Valiant to act as a solid revenge killer against Pokemon like Terastallized Dragon Dance Dragonite or Choice Scarf Kartana, though giving up an important coverage move may not be so favorable. Tapu Koko is a top teammate and facilitator for Iron Valiant, giving it a speed boost that can make Iron Valiant very difficult to play around while also being able to both pivot into it and beat its checks such as Moltres, Zapdos, and Toxapex. Teammates that can force switches and safely get Iron Valiant onto the field such as Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Moltres work well as teammates. Pokemon that can safely check the Poison-types that Iron Valiant struggles with such as Gliscor, Heatran, and Great Tusk also work well as teammates. Late-game cleaners that appreciate Iron Valiant's ability to tear holes in opposing defensive cores such as Mega Scizor, Mega Lopunny, and Kartana also make for good teammates.</p>"
        },
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Swords Dance Iron Valiant is both a powerful sweeper and revenge killer mainly seen on hyper offense teams. Its high Speed combined with Booster Energy allows it to outspeed +1 setup sweepers like Mega Gyarados, Gouging Fire, and Volcarona, as well as naturally fast targets like Mega Lopunny and Darkrai. The popularity of specially offensive Iron Valiant can allow this set to catch opponents off guard and give it a free opportunity to use Swords Dance against foes like Galarian Slowking. Swords Dance boosts Iron Valiant's power to dangerous levels, enabling it to OHKO foes neutral to Fighting like Corviknight and Alomomola with a favorable roll or minor chip damage. Knock Off provides valuable coverage for Psychic-types like Galarian Slowking and Iron Crown, and it can also take down walls like Ferrothorn and Garganacl after they use Tera Ghost. Encore can lock physically defensive walls like Alomomola and Landorus-T into recovery moves or status moves like Defog, which can give Iron Valiant a good chance to set up. Ice Punch is an alternative to Encore for Landorus-T and Dragonite. Tera Dark gives Knock Off a STAB boost, allowing it to do more damage to foes like Galarian Slowking and Zapdos. Tera Steel, on the other hand, provides Iron Valiant with resistances to common priority moves like Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, Ice Shard from Weavile, and Extreme Speed from Dragonite, which can prevent it from being revenge killed. Tera Steel can also be paired with Encore to take advantage of Sludge Bomb from Galarian Slowking and Toxic from foes like Alomomola. Iron Valiant pairs well with teammates like Iron Boulder, Ogerpon-W, and Raging Bolt, since they can pressure common checks for it, such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Dondozo. Iron Valiant is very fragile to priority moves due to its low bulk and the side effects of Close Combat, so Tapu Lele's Psychic Surge can protect it from priority moves and allow it to safely sweep. In addition, Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant can take care of each other's checks. Iron Valiant can break Galarian Slowking and Heatran, while Tapu Lele gives physical walls like Dondozo a hard time. Iron Valiant also appreciates other Knock Off users on its team to help wear down Unaware users like Dondozo and Skeledirge by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers.</p>"
        },
        "Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<p>With a wide variety of special coverage moves and a great Speed stat, Calm Mind Iron Valiant is one of the best sweepers and cleaners in the tier. Speed Booster Energy allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, as well as setup sweepers like Mega Gyarados, Great Tusk, and Dragonite at +1 without being Choice locked. Moonblast is its most spammable STAB move, since most Steel-types are threatened by Focus Blast, leaving Galarian Slowking as one of its few reliable checks. Thunderbolt provides valuable coverage against Water-types like Alomomola and Toxapex, while Shadow Ball hits Galarian Slowking super effectively. Focus Blast is Iron Valiant's strongest STAB move, OHKOing common Steel-type walls at +1 such as Mega Scizor after a decent amount of chip damage, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Encore prevents sweeps from setup Pokemon like Volcarona and lets Iron Valiant set up against Pokemon like Alomomola and Toxapex. Tera Electric makes Iron Valiant immune to paralysis from walls like Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking while allowing Thunderbolt to OHKO Alomomola and specially defensive Toxapex after minimal chip at +1. Tera Ghost grants Iron Valiant a resistance to Poison-type moves and gives Shadow Ball a STAB boost, allowing it to better take advantage of its coverage and 2HKO Galarian Slowking with minimal chip or at +1. Tera Steel is a good defensive type that helps Iron Valiant set up on the likes of Alomomola and Choice-locked Tapu Lele and provides a resistance to priority moves such as Bullet Punch, Ice Shard, and Extreme Speed. It can also be paired with Encore to turn Galarian Slowking into setup fodder by locking it into Sludge Bomb. Iron Valiant appreciates teammates like Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Mega Scizor that overwhelm common special walls in Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Blissey, letting it sweep. Knock Off support from the likes of Mega Scizor and Tyranitar is also appreciated, as removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Toxapex and Leftovers from Heatran and Ferrothorn can help position Iron Valiant to sweep.</p>"

        "Choice Scarf": {
          "description": "<p>Due to its naturally high Speed and Choice Scarf, Iron Valiant outspeeds the entire metagame at +1 except for +1 Iron Boulder and Hawlucha with Unburden active, which makes it a solid cleaner and revenge killer. Close Combat is the preferred Fighting-type STAB move over Aura Sphere or Focus Blast because it can do more damage to foes like Heatran and Iron Boulder while maintaining strength and accuracy. Knock Off is an excellent way of making progress, as it can remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers on common walls like Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, and Landorus-T, and it can provide valuable coverage for Psychic-types like Galarian Slowking and Iron Crown. Trick is fantastic against more passive teams and can cripple switch-ins like Toxapex and Alomomola. It can also lock setup sweepers like Volcarona into one move, making them much easier to deal with. Destiny Bond, on the other hand, can be used as an emergency plan to trade with foes like Ogerpon-W and Gouging Fire, especially after they acquire several boosts. Tera Fairy can increase the power of Moonblast, guaranteeing a 2HKO against utility Tornadus-T and Zapdos and an OHKO against Zamazenta. Teammates like Hisuian Samurott and Ogerpon-W pair well with Iron Valiant, since they can pressure foes like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola. In addition, Hisuian Samurott can also stack Spikes via Ceaseless Edge, which greatly helps Iron Valiant with its lack of power, as it can often remove Heavy-Duty Boots from key targets such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Galarian Slowking with Knock Off or Trick. Iron Valiant appreciates teammates like Mega Scizor and Zapdos to help it deal with Iron Boulder and Hawlucha, which are capable of outspeeding it.</p>"

Thunderbolt hits Water- and Flying-types such as Dondozo and Corviknight. Psyshock hits Poison-types such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire, whereas Future Sight can apply pressure to opponents like Toxapex for teammates such as Breloom and Gallade. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types such as Gholdengo and Skeledirge.

Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo, Quaquaval, and Slither Wing pressure Pokemon faster than Iron Valiant such as Greninja, Dragapult, and Cinderace. Tauros-F is another fantastic partner thanks to its ability to shatter dual screens with Raging Bull, making Iron Valiant more effective in matchups against Dark, Fairy, and Ice, all while avoiding burns thanks to its part Fire typing, which helps against Ghost and Dark teams.</p>"

        "Choice Scarf (Fairy)": {
          "description": "<p>Iron Valiant is a very valuable asset for Fairy teams with the combination of its amazing Speed tier, typing, and offensive stats. One of Iron Valiant's best qualities for Fairy teams is its access to Fighting-type STAB moves to counter Steel-types. Thunderbolt is a good option to hit Corviknight, Dondozo, and Toxapex super effectively and make cleaning up against Flying and Water teams easier after the Ground-type is removed. Energy Ball is a good alternative to more easily beat specially defensive Gastrodon and Rotom-W, but Grass Knot is an option to beat Dondozo after Spikes. Psyshock is a good tool versus Poison-types like Clodsire, Iron Moth and Amoonguss, while Shadow Ball lets it hit Skeledirge and Gholdengo that otherwise wall Iron Valiant. Trick is another great option to hinder defensive switch-ins like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clodsire if Iron Valiant forgoes the moves to deal with them. Choice Scarf makes Iron Valiant an excellent revenge killer, being able to outrun threats such as Dragapult, Chien-Pao, and slower Choice Scarf users like Iron Moth and Gholdengo.</p> <p>Iron Valiant has amazing coverage, which makes it an effective cleaner; however, it cannot run all of them at once. Hence, it appreciates teammates that can cover what it cannot, and it also appreciates teammates that help it switch in, as it is quite frail. Klefki can set up dual screens, which aids it in switching, and also set up Spikes, which makes it easier for Iron Valiant to clean. Klefki is also a good switch-in against opposing Fairy-types like Mimikyu. Flutter Mane and Mimikyu can weaken teams to let Iron Valiant clean up or they can clean up after it. They also deal with Ghost-types such as Gholdengo, Flutter Mane, and Skeledirge if it forgoes Shadow Ball. Azumarill checks Fire-types such as Paldean Tauros-F, Volcarona, and Iron Moth and Ground-types such as Iron Treads and Clodsire. Hatterene is a great partner, as it can break through Poison-types like Glimmora, Toxapex, and Amoonguss while also preventing entry hazards. Tinkaton can set up Stealth Rock and is a good counter to Fairy-types that check Iron Valiant otherwise such as Hatterene, Flutter Mane, and opposing Iron Valiant.</p>"

Close Combat is Iron Valiant's strongest attack, being able to take out Steel-, Dark-, Ice-, and Normal-types like Kingambit, Alolan Muk, Choice Specs Kyurem, and Ursaluna-B. Knock Off is a good coverage move that checks Psychic- and Ghost-types like Galarian Slowking, Latios, Gholdengo, and Ceruledge while also removing items in the process. Trick allows Iron Valiant to Choice-lock walls like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, Amoonguss, and Dondozo. Shadow Sneak can be run instead of Trick to check Flutter Mane, Gengar, and Will-O-Wisp Dragapult, while Spirit Break deals with Mandibuzz and Sableye. Ice Punch deals with Flying-, Ground-, and Dragon-types like Gliscor, Landorus, Clodsire, and Dragonite.</p> <p>Klefki is a great teammate for Iron Valiant, providing a Poison immunity, dual screens, and entry hazards. Behind dual screens, Iron Valiant can survive an unboosted Bullet Punch from Scizor. Klefki also stops physical setup sweepers like Ceruledge, Ogerpon formes, Scizor, and Baxcalibur with Foul Play. Futhermore, Klefki provides Thunder Wave support to paralyze threats like Flutter Mane and Dragapult so Iron Valiant can take them out more easily with Knock Off. In return, Iron Valiant takes out foes like Mamoswine and Gliscor for Klefki. Belly Drum Azumarill is a great sweeper to pair with Iron Valiant, as it can remove threats like Moltres, Amoonguss, and Ogerpon-H. Choice Specs Flutter Mane is a strong wallbreaker, being able to take out threats that Iron Valiant struggles to break like Moltres, Pecharunt, and Gholdengo with Power Gem and Shadow Ball. Hatterene eases the Psychic matchup by checking Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Okidogi for Iron Valiant while also preventing hazards from being set by foes with Magic Bounce. Iron Valiant returns the favor by taking out Kingambit, Alolan Muk, and Hisuian Goodra for Flutter Mane and Hatterene. Calm Mind Clefable is a great bulky sweeper with its good coverage in Moonblast and Thunderbolt, which can deal with Gyarados, Moltres, and Dondozo. Magic Guard also allows Clefable to absorb status for Iron Valiant. Choice Scarf Enamorus provides a Ground Immunity and has Healing Wish to support the team. Iron Valiant deals with Kyurem and Mamoswine for Clefable and Enamorus. Ribombee provides Sticky Web support to slow down fast threats like Choice Specs Greninja, Choice Scarf Iron Treads, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and opposing Flutter Mane. Tinkaton is another Poison immunity that can set Stealth Rock, stop walls with Encore, and provide Thunder Wave support as well. Physically defensive Primarina is a great teammate, being able to check Gouging Fire with Psychic Noise, preventing it from recovering HP with Morning Sun. Mimikyu is a decent sweeper set up easily thanks to its ability. After a Swords Dance, Mimikyu is able to take out Flutter Mane, Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Iron Boulder with Shadow Sneak, which Iron Valiant appreciates, while also allowing Iron Valiant to run Spirit Break or Trick instead. Galarian Weezing is a nice physical wall and can remove hazards with Defog for the team. Galarian Weezing also provides a Ground immunity and has the potential to weaken physical threats like Sneasler, opposing Azumarill, and Iron Treads with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

Its STAB Moonblast is one of its best qualities, being able to easily beat Mega Sableye and OHKO most opposing Fighting- and Dragon-types such as Buzzwole and Mega Altaria. Thunderbolt is great coverage to hit Flying- and Water-types like Tornadus-T and Toxapex that otherwise wall Iron Valiant, while Energy Ball lets it deal with Mega Swampert, which it can outspeed even under rain, Rotom-W, and Gastrodon more easily. Shadow Ball prevents Iron Valiant from being walled by Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Aegislash while also improving the Psychic matchup. Knock Off and Trick cripple defensive switch-ins such as Toxapex, Celesteela, and Clodsire by removing or replacing important items and forcing them to go without passive recovery or be Choice locked. Iron Valiant is also a great asset in the Fairy and Electric matchups, as it uses opposing Tapu Koko's Electric Surge to activate its own Quark Drive and outspeed even Regieleki and Alolan Raichu under Electric Terrain. Iron Valiant appreciates support from Mega Gallade, as it easily takes care of Poison-types like Clodsire, Mega Venusaur, and Alolan Muk. Iron Hands and Great Tusk are great teammates for the Electric matchup while also beating the likes of Toxapex, Galarian Moltres, and Gholdengo. Cobalion and Great Tusk can set up Stealth Rock and even clear entry hazards in the case of the latter.

          "description": "<p>With its incredible power, speed, ease of setup, and lack of reliable checks, Scale Shot Koraidon is the most influential and dangerous sweeper in the entire metagame. In conjunction with Loaded Dice, Scale Shot is a powerful attack that allows Koraidon to threaten the many Dragon-types in Ubers, such as Koraidon, Miraidon, Eternatus, and Giratina-O. It is a bit luck-dependent, however, as it sometimes needs to hit a certain number of times to achieve certain KOs. For example, after a Swords Dance boost, Scale Shot must hit five times to OHKO defensive Ho-Oh. In addition to the staples of Scale Shot, Flare Blitz, and Swords Dance, this set has a lot of versatility when it comes to its last move and Tera type. Low Kick dispatches Extreme Killer Arceus trying to revenge kill it with Extreme Speed, as Koraidon is bulky enough to survive Extreme Speed after a Scale Shot. Opposing Koraidon, Miraidon, Zacian-C, Kyogre, and Necrozma-DM also fall to Low Kick after a Swords Dance, meaning Koraidon does not have to risk missing Scale Shot or taking recoil damage from Flare Blitz, especially against Zacian-C, which commonly tries to switch into Koraidon to absorb Scale Shot. Substitute scouts for any potential Terastallizations attempting to slow Koraidon down, most notably Tera Fairy on several Pokemon like Miraidon and defensive Arceus formes such as Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water. In conjunction with Tera Ghost, Substitute is also useful for turning Pokemon like Arceus-Water, Gliscor lacking Earthquake, and Skeledirge into setup fodder. Tera Ghost gives Koraidon an immunity to Low Kick from opposing Koraidon and, more importantly, Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus, letting it use these Pokemon as setup fodder, especially if running Substitute. Tera Fire, on the other hand, gives Koraidon a Fairy resistance, immunity to Will-O-Wisp and Sacred Fire burns from Ho-Oh, and STAB on Flare Blitz, letting it turn the tables on Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy, which are good checks to unboosted Koraidon.</p> <p>Scale Shot Koraidon is best used on hyper offense teams that can easily overwhelm its checks, but it can also be used as a ferocious sweeper on bulky teams. It loves pairing with Miraidon, as Miraidon can pivot to Koraidon for it to set up on Miraidon's common checks in Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Double Dance Miraidon also pairs extremely well with Scale Shot Koraidon on hyper offense. Zacian-C is also a superb Koraidon partner, as the two can overwhelm their shared checks, such as Ho-Oh, Landorus-T, and defensive Arceus formes like Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water. Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM can switch into Arceus-Fairy and lure and heavily damage Skeledirge with a boosted Photon Geyser, making it a solid partner. Entry hazard support in the form of leads like Deoxys-S and Glimmora and bulkier hazard stackers like Gliscor is greatly appreciated, as Arceus-Fairy, Koraidon's best check, takes enormous damage from a Swords Dance-boosted Flare Blitz and is cleanly OHKOed after Stealth Rock and a single layer of Spikes.</p>"

Outrage and Dragon Claw both OHKO Miraidon and opposing Koraidon, but Outrage is preferred for its ability to 2HKO Toxapex and Skeledirge, though it lets any remaining Fairy-types easily revenge kill Koraidon.

Koraidon can use U-turn to safely pivot in Pokemon like Calyrex-S and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, which threaten its checks such as Toxapex and Skeledirge. Teammates like Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, and Arceus can weaken Koraidon's checks and potentially bait out Terastallization, enabling Koraidon to clean up late-game.

When paired with a Life Orb, Tera Grass-boosted Solar Beam can OHKO Ting-Lu and specially defensive Arceus-Ground.

Tera Fairy is an option on non-Double Dance sets that lets you flip the matchup into Koraidon and opposing Miraidon. However, this comes at the risk of being revenge killed by Zacian-C and threatened by Sunsteel Strike from Necrozma-DM.

Arceus-Ground and Clodsire additionally have access to recovery moves that let them check Miraidon long-term, unlike Ting-Lu. However, they can struggle against Taunt variants of Miraidon and can be OHKOed by Choice Specs and Calm Mind sets.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon, as well as Zacian-C, outspeed and threaten to OHKO Miraidon with their STAB attacks. However, Koraidon and Miraidon can only enter on a predicted Electro Drift. Extreme Killer Arceus can revenge kill Miraidon if it is heavily chipped, but must be wary of Tera Ghost. Iron Bundle in Electric Terrain also outspeeds Miraidon and threatens to OHKO it with either Choice Specs-boosted Ice Beam or simply Tera Ice-boosted Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Dragon Resists</strong>: Zacian-C, Arceus-Fairy, and Flutter Mane can pivot into Miraidon's Draco Meteor and threaten it out with a strong Fairy-type attack. Necrozma-DM can also pivot into Draco Meteor and run Tera Ground paired with Earthquake to threaten Miraidon. However, all of the aforementioned Pokemon are heavily threatened by Electro Drift and must be wary of switching into a predicted attack.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey can pivot into any of Miraidon's attacks and is never 2HKOed by Choice Specs- or Life Orb-boosted attacks. However, Blissey must be wary of Taunt blocking its use of Recover. Furthermore, Blissey can only touch Miraidon with Seismic Toss and must be wary of a potential Tera Ghost Miraidon.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Grass</strong>: Arceus-Grass resists Miraidon's Electro Drift and can pivot into its Draco Meteor. However, it must be wary of Overheat on Choice Specs sets and can be outdamaged by Tera Dragon sets.</p>",

Heavy-Duty Boots maximizes Miraidon's longevity against entry hazard-stacking teams and gives it an advantage against Sticky Web teams. Miraidon can use U-turn to bring in Koraidon, Arceus, Kyogre, and Chien-Pao on its checks, such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Arceus-Ground. Taunt prevents Arceus formes and Clodsire from using Recover while limiting hazards and setup from the likes of Arceus, Necrozma-DM, and Ting-Lu. Tera Dragon powers up Miraidon's Draco Meteor, letting it 2HKO Arceus formes and Clodsire and hit Ting-Lu even harder. Tera Steel gives Miraidon the ability to avoid Toxic from Clodsire and Eternatus while letting it resist the likes of Scale Shot and Dragon Claw from Koraidon, Draco Meteor from opposing Miraidon, Play Rough from Zacian-C, Extreme Speed from Arceus, and Judgment from Arceus-Fairy. Tera Ghost sheds Miraidon's weaknesses while also preventing Extreme Killer Arceus from consistently revenge killing it.</p> <p>Miraidon is quite fast but can still be revenge killed by Choice Scarf Koraidon and Zacian-C. As such, Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM pair well with it. Necrozma-DM's access to Knock Off especially helps Miraidon and its teammates win the hazard war. Hazard setters such as Ting-Lu and Gliscor appreciate Miraidon limiting both hazards from opposing setters and preventing recovery while also checking opposing Miraidon and Ground-types such as Arceus-Ground, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Pivot Miraidon also pairs especially well with Choice Scarf Koraidon thanks to their shared access to U-turn, letting them form a strong pivot core that can wear down Pokemon in conjunction with hazards. Finally, Miraidon pairs well with Calm Mind Arceus formes such as Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Ground, as Miraidon's strong Draco Meteors and access to Taunt let it wear down special walls such as Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Grass, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu for them.</p>"

Overheat is the standard coverage move on Choice Specs sets, as it offers a midground between hitting Ground-types such as Arceus-Ground, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu and Fairy-types such as Arceus-Fairy, Flutter-Mane, and Zacian-C. U-turn and Volt Switch are both options for the set, but Volt Switch requires the player to be more aggressive against opposing Ground-types. Tera Dragon lets Miraidon 2HKO Ting-Lu and defensive Necrozma-DM while also OHKOing Ho-Oh. Tera Electric powers up Miraidon's Electro Drift and Volt Switch immensely, making them much harder to pivot around with Electric resistancdes such as Koraidon and Eternatus. Tera Fire is an option that pairs well with Overheat, as it lets Miraidon OHKO both Arceus formes and Clodsire in sun without any need for prediction, but it is generally outclassed thanks to the lack of defensive utility and Stealth Rock weakness that it brings.</p> <p>Miraidon's ability to break special walls, such as Clodsire for Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy and Kyogre and Ting-Lu for Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, is appreciated. In return, they can pivot into Miraidon's revenge killers, such as Koraidon, Zacian-C, and opposing Miraidon. Physical wallbreakers such as Koraidon, Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, and Zacian-C can wear down shared checks such as Arceus-Ground while giving Miraidon a turn of free entry. Koraidon in particular is a very strong partner for being able to pivot Miraidon into Ho-Oh, and the two of them can wear down Arceus-Fairy together. Finally, Miraidon's reliance on prediction makes it necessary to have teammates that can pivot into the aforementioned Ground- and Fairy-types, such as Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM.</p>"

Although Electro Drift is the preferred option for its power against Arceus formes, Necrozma-DM, and Zacian-C, Parabolic Charge is an option to increase Miraidon's longevity. Dazzling Gleam is an option over Dragon Pulse that pairs well with Tera Fairy to break Ting-Lu. Electric Seed's Defense boost lets Miraidon set up easily against physical attackers, including Extreme Killer Arceus, Choice Scarf Koraidon, Necrozma-DM, and Zacian-C lacking Play Rough. Leftovers gives Miraidon some flexibility to set up when pivoting into play. Finally, Life Orb boosts Miraidon's damage output massively, letting its Electro Drift OHKO Zacian-C without a Calm Mind boost. Tera Dragon is preferred for its power boost to Dragon Pulse, letting Miraidon 2HKO Clodsire and Ting-Lu with one layer of Spikes up after a Calm Mind boost while also letting it more easily set up on Arceus-Ground and Ting-Lu. Tera Fairy gives Miraidon the ability to set up on Koraidon and opposing Miraidon and powers up Dazzling Gleam enough to OHKO Ting-Lu when using a Life Orb, although Miraidon cannot beat Clodsire with this set. 8 Speed EVs allows Miraidon to outspeed Iron Bundle in Electric Terrain after an Agility boost.</p> <p>Double Dance Miraidon is best on hyper offense teams, where other teammates like Koraidon and Zacian-C can wear down opposing Pokemon enough to let Miraidon easily sweep. Agility Eternatus is a strong teammate, since it can help wear down Miraidon's checks in Arceus-Ground, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu while absorbing Toxic Spikes. Glimmora, Deoxys-S, and Deoxys-A are good partners for setting entry hazards to wear down Miraidon's checks. Arceus-Ground and Necrozma-DM can help wear down a shared check in Ting-Lu, and Miraidon can pivot into Arceus-Water and Kyogre for them. Other hyper offense support Pokemon such as Grimmsnarl and Orthworm can help Miraidon set up, with the former letting Miraidon set up more easily under dual screens and the latter setting up Shed Tail against on Ground-types.</p>"

          "description": "<p>This Miraidon set is a strong wallbreaker without the prediction reliance of Choice Specs Miraidon. Parabolic Charge is an option over Electro Drift in order to make up for Life Orb recoil, but Electro Drift's higher power lets Miraidon OHKO Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy unboosted. Dragon Pulse provides a more spammable alternative to Draco Meteor that still 2HKOes Arceus-Ground and Clodsire after a Calm Mind boost. Taunt prevents recovery from Arceus formes and Clodsire, and Substitute eases prediction against Ground- and Fairy-type cores as well as against Terastallization. However, Substitute and Life Orb can significantly decrease Miraidon's longevity, so Draco Plate is generally preferred when running Substitute. Draco Plate is an alternative over Life Orb for similar power without the recoil. Tera Dragon is the preferred Tera type thanks to the significant power increase. Tera Dragon-boosted Draco Meteor Miraidon has a 50% chance to OHKO Ting-Lu after a Calm Mind, and a Modest nature guarantees the OHKO. Alternatively, Tera Bug paired with Substitute turns some of Miraidon's checks into setup fodder, as Arceus-Ground's Earthquake and Judgment and Clodsire's Earthquake do not break through Substitute. Solar Beam is another option that threatens to OHKO Ting-Lu after a Calm Mind boost and has no charge turn in sun.</p> <p>This Miraidon set fits on offensively minded teams that don't mind the lack of longevity in exchange for its wallbreaking power. Sticky Web teams appreciate Miraidon's wallbreaking power to open up setup sweepers like Koraidon and Basculegion-M late-game and can make up for Miraidon's lack of Speed. Arceus-Ground and Necrozma-DM appreciate Miraidon potentially removing Ting-Lu. Entry hazard support from Clodsire, Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Gliscor can wear down Ting-Lu and Arceus formes into range of Miraidon's unboosted attacks. Choice Scarf Koraidon and Zacian-C can revenge kill Miraidon, so checks to them such as Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Gliscor are appreciated.</p>"

Tera Dragon powers up Miraidon's Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse, letting Draco Meteor 2HKO Clodsire. Tera Electric powers up Miraidon's Electro Drift and Volt Switch but can be risky to use before opposing Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Arceus-Ground are eliminated. Tera Steel gives Miraidon a resistance to Dragon-type coverage and Extreme Speed, letting Miraidon revenge kill Extreme Killer Arceus, Scale Shot Koraidon, and Flutter Mane in sun in a pinch.</p> <p>Miraidon's Speed tier makes it the fastest revenge killer in the tier, only tied with Choice Scarf Koraidon and outsped by Iron Bundle in Electric Terrain. However, it struggles with Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire, which freely pivot into it and use it to set up entry hazards. Physical wallbreakers such as Koraidon, Necrozma-DM, and Zacian-C can pressure the aforementioned Ground-types. Koraidon in particular is a very strong partner for being able to pivot Miraidon into Ho-Oh, and the two of them can wear down Arceus-Fairy together. This also frees up Koraidon's item slot, letting Koraidon run sweeper sets instead. Miraidon appreciates partners that can set entry hazards such as Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire. Gliscor can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon while setting Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and Clodsire can absorb Toxic Spikes for Miraidon. Miraidon being locked into any of its STAB moves is exploitable, so having checks to Electric-type resists, such as Koraidon, Miraidon, and the aforementioned Ground-types, and Dragon-type resists, such as Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, and Necrozma-DM, is appreciated.</p>"

Solar Beam when paired with sun or Power Herb allows Miraidon to hit Ting-Lu super effectively while avoiding the drawbacks of Draco Meteor. Tera Dragon boosts Draco Meteor's damage to horrifying levels, allowing Life Orb Miraidon to OHKO Ting-Lu after one Calm Mind boost and OHKO Arceus-Ground unboosted, both after one layer of Spikes, and it removes Miraidon's Ground-type weakness. Tera Grass allows Life Orb Miraidon to OHKO Ting-Lu with a little bit of chip damage and resist Ground-type moves from Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground. Life Orb is the preferred item due to it letting Miraidon more easily KO foes such as Ting-Lu and Arceus formes. Alternatively, Heavy-Duty Boots provides Miraidon with greater longevity, letting it come in more freely and potentially outlast its checks. Power Herb is also an option to remove the need of setting sun for Miraidon, allowing it to use Solar Beam freely once.

Hydro Pump offers a powerful Water-type STAB attack to hit Steel- and Fairy-types like Gholdengo, Clefable, Kingambit, and Heatran as well as OHKOes Volcarona after a Quiver Dance. Scald offers a reliable Water-type STAB attack due to its accuracy and ability to potentially burn switch-ins such as Alolan Muk, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Snorlax, while Flip Turn provides Walking Wake with a pivoting move, reducing the need to predict and also maintaining momentum in a match. Alternatively, Hydro Steam not only is reliable accuracy-wise but also aids against sun Fire teams, tearing through every Pokemon barring Volcanion in conjunction with Protosynthesis. Flamethrower may be used instead to threaten the aforementioned Steel-types as well as Ice- and Grass-types such as Alolan Ninetales, Frosmoth, and Amoonguss The given EV spread ensures that Protosynthesis always give a Speed boost under sun, allowing Walking Wake to outpace threats like Ogerpon-H and Choice Scarf Ninetales.</p> <p>Empoleon offers a resistance to Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks, walling opposing Walking Wake, Flutter Mane, Hydreigon, and Alolan Ninetales. Furthermore, Empoleon has a notable Freeze-Dry neutrality and provides Stealth Rock and Knock Off support to wear down walls like Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Iron Hands. In return, Walking Wake threatens Pokemon like Baxcalibur, Great Tusk, and Zapdos and forms a pivoting core via Flip Turn. Toxapex is heavily valued for its Fairy-type resistance, switching into threats such as Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus, as well as adds on to Walking Wake's offensive pressure via Toxic Spikes. Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W break special walls like Empoleon, Gastrodon, and Clodsire. In return, Walking Wake threatens Poison-type walls such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Galarian Weezing. Pelipper provides rain support to enhance Walking Wake's wallbreaking capabilities, notably allowing Walking Wake to 2HKO Assault Vest Iron Hands with Hydro Pump, as well as Knock Off to remove vital items like Iron Hands and Galarian Slowking's Assault Vests and U-turn to form a pivoting core and bring in Walking Wake safely. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott removes faster Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Dragapult, Greninja, and Flutter Mane using its Fighting- and Dark-type coverage while providing Spikes support with Ceaseless Edge.

Hydro Steam, emboldened by sun, lets Walking Wake demolish Fire teams. Alternatively, Dragon Pulse provides a weaker but more consistent STAB attack, which is great against opposing Dragon teams.

Draco Meteor hits Desolate Land Iron Moth and Water-resistant switch-ins like RegenVest Manaphy and Hisuian Goodra, outdamaging Regenerator on the latter two and OHKOing the former with Dragon's Maw sets. Knock Off can be run to let Walking Wake better enable its own wallbreaking by crippling RegenVest Pokemon, while Scald and Dragon Pulse can be used if its team already has Knock Off support as more consistent damaging options with no drawbacks and, in the case of Scald, the chance to burn foes. Flip Turn allows Walking Wake to maintain momentum and pivot in teammates safely. Due to its middling Speed when running Choice Specs, Walking Wake is susceptible to being revenge killed by Chien-Pao and Gengar, so it appreciates teammates like Choice Scarf Roaring Moon and Azelf that can take care of faster threats. While Walking Wake can play around RegenVest Pokemon with Knock Off, it still benefits from physically offensive teammates like Galarian Zapdos and Iron Boulder that can more easily handle them. Due to its lack of recovery, Walking Wake appreciates entry hazard removal support from the likes of Great Tusk and Corviknight to allow it to come in safely.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Walking Wake is a powerful wallbreaker and a staple on sun teams due to its unique offensive typing, amazing Special Attack, high Speed, and signature Hydro Steam, which is a powerful Water-type STAB move that takes full advantage of the sun. Draco Meteor is a brutally powerful STAB move that synergizes wonderfully with Hydro Steam, capable of OHKOing Water-resistant Pokemon including the likes of Ogerpon-W, Raging Bolt, and Kyurem in addition to 2HKOing nearly every Pokemon in the metagame barring Fairy-types such as Clefable and Primarina. Flamethrower guarantees an OHKO on Corviknight and bulky variants of Kingambit, though Flamethrower isn't used very often in practice due to Walking Wake's already fantastic STAB combination; Weather Ball is a stronger alternative to Flamethrower and allows Walking Wake to still take advantage of opposing weathers such as rain or snow. Dragon Pulse can be used in the last slot, which forgoes Draco Meteor's raw power for more consistency; however, Flip Turn allows Walking Wake to generate momentum for its team, taking advantage of switch-ins from the likes of Galarian Slowking and Primarina to safely bring in its teammates; lastly, Knock Off allows it to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from checks such as Galarian Slowking. 244 Special Attack EVs gives Walking Wake a Speed boost from Protosynthesis, making it a potent late-game cleaner against offensive teams due to its power coupled with its heightened Speed, letting it outspeed and threaten would-be revenge killers like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Enamorus; alternatively, Walking Wake can sacrifice the Speed boost for even more power by fully investing in Special Attack, allowing it to break through the likes of Primarina through sheer strength. Tera Water boosts its Hydro Steam's power even further, bolstering its cleaning potential against offense while 2HKOing even resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex after Stealth Rock, and allows Walking Wake to 2HKO even Blissey should it opt for a Special Attack boost; however, Tera Fairy could be considered as an alternative, granting it an immunity to Draco Meteor from Dragapult and opposing Walking Wake as well as a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Choice Specs Walking Wake is a mainstay on sun teams, requiring Torkoal to set the sun with Drought. Torkoal can also set Stealth Rock, which makes defensively answering Walking Wake even more difficult, as checks such as Primarina would repeatedly have to sustain chip damage. Hatterene and Great Tusk are also great teammates for Walking Wake, alleviating the issue of entry hazards limiting its longevity; Hatterene is also capable of forcing out checks such as Toxapex and Iron Valiant, while Great Tusk can check priority revenge killers such as Dragonite and Kingambit. In return, Walking Wake can consistently KO or force out either Pokemon's checks, notably taking on Skarmory for Great Tusk and Heatran for Hatterene. Gouging Fire and Choice Band Roaring Moon can pair with Walking Wake to form a devastating wallbreaking core, which can rapidly overwhelm each of their respective checks through raw power, such as Skarmory, Dondozo, Primarina, and Galarian Slowking, as well as enabling Gouging Fire to clean late-game. Walking Wake also appreciates Roaring Moon's powerful STAB Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Toxapex, and can pivot on its switch-ins with Flip Turn to bring Roaring Moon onto the field. Hisuian Lilligant and Venusaur can threaten Water-types such as Primarina and Ogerpon-W; both also appreciate Walking Wake blowing holes into the opposing team's defenses, giving them ample opportunity to run off with the game after their checks have been weakened. Lastly, Raging Bolt greatly enjoys Walking Wake's efficiency in dismantling its checks, notably Unaware Clodsire, as doing so enables Raging Bolt to sweep more efficiently in mid- or late-game scenarios.</p>"

Opting for Leftovers over Heavy-Duty Boots enables Sinistcha to set up more Substitutes, but Ghost teams with Sinistcha are unlikely to have entry hazard removal support, which makes Sinistcha easier to wear down. Similarly, an itemless Sinistcha is plausible, as it effectively walls Ceruledge and prevents Knock Off users like Gliscor from breaking its Substitute. However, this is discouraged due to how circumstantial this is.</p> </section>",

          "description": "<p>Calm Mind Sinistcha serves as an effective wincon against types like Ground and Water, as it readily handles walls like Clodsire and Toxapex, which pose problems for Ghost teams. Matcha Gotcha threatens Ursaluna-B and puts physical attackers, such as Choice Band Excadrill, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Mamoswine, in a situation where they risk getting burned to break Sinistcha's Substitute. The chance to burn also affects the ability of Articuno, Empoleon, and Alolan Muk to wall out Ghost teams in the long run, making it advantageous even if the damage dealt to these walls is negligible. Matcha Gotcha also is Sinistcha's only form of recovery, allowing it to set up and threaten opposing teams longer. Shadow Ball provides more upfront damage and allows Sinistcha to OHKO Flutter Mane and Ceruledge at +1, while Hex synergizes with Matcha Gotcha's ability to spread burns and threatens Gliscor better. Substitute keeps Sinistcha away from status, especially Toxic, from the aforementioned walls and also provides a better matchup against Ursaluna-B, as it prevents Sinistcha from taking damage from Blood Moon. Substitute also takes advantage of forced switches, allowing Sinistcha to fish for burns as often as possible and letting it set up on physical attackers after they have been inflicted with a burn. With 96 Speed EVs, Sinistcha outspeeds and removes Adamant Belly Drum Azumarill, while the remaining EVs are invested in Defense and HP to maximize its bulk, enabling it to sponge hits from Excadrill and Barraskewda. Heatproof is effective against Hisuian Goodra, Cinderace, and Volcanion in a pinch.</p> <p>Sinistcha annoys almost every special wall in the metagame with its ability to inflict burns, making it a valuable teammate for every special attacker Ghost teams have. For instance, Hex Spectrier can clean up after Sinistcha has burned the opposition. Flutter Mane appreciates the removal of Clodsire, Empoleon, and Zamazenta, while Gholdengo benefits from special walls like Alolan Muk being burned, making it easier for Gholdengo to set up. In return, these teammates dispatch of faster threats like Latios, Ogerpon-H, and Baxcalibur. Dragapult pivots Sinistcha in against walls like Clodsire, deals with Gouging Fire and Roaring Moon, and spreads status to give Sinistcha more setup opportunities. Ceruledge appreciates Sinistcha dealing with bulky Ground- and Water-types, which wall it after a Swords Dance. In return, Ceruledge makes quick work of Flutter Mane, Gholdengo, and Heatran. Furthermore, Ceruledge can also handle threats like Kingambit and Chien-Pao if its Focus Sash remains intact. Mimikyu takes advantage of Sinistcha removing Quagsire and Toxapex, and in return, it provides Ghost teams with a failsafe against threats like Hisuian Samurott, Kingambit, and Chien-Pao. Froslass and Golurk provide entry hazards in Spikes or Stealth Rock to soften up opposing teams. Froslass also provides Thunder Wave to capitalize on Hex and allows Sinistcha to outpace threats like Spectrier, while Golurk can use a Kasib or Colbur Berry to lure and remove threeats like Flutter Mane or Kingambit for it. Skeledirge checks Fire-types that overwhelm Sinistcha like Gouging Fire, Volcarona, and Heatran, and is able to burn foes like Kingambit.</p>"

Toxic Chain and Guard Dog are both helpful in allowing Okidogi to break through teams. Toxic Chain puts more pressure on bulky walls like Sableye, Avalugg, Quagsire, and Skeledirge, which forces them to either switch out or repeatedly use recovery moves. Guard Dog, on the other hand, punishes Intimidate from the likes of Landorus-T, Gyarados, and Paldean Tauros-F and stops phazing from threats such as Ting-Lu and Empoleon. Drain Punch is a useful STAB move that keeps Okidogi healthy and deals solid damage against threats like Kingambit, Garganacl, and Heatran. Knock Off is used to punish Ghost-types like Gholdengo, Ceruledge, and Dragapult that effortlessly wall Okidogi otherwise. It also annoys switch-ins like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Quagsire by removing their Black Sludge. For the final moveslot there are three main options. Taunt prevents Haze from Toxapex and Articuno, Substitute is useful to set up in the face of Pokemon like Amoonguss and Galarian Weezing, and Ice Punch blows through Flying- and Ground-types like Dragonite, Clodsire, and Gliscor. 96 Speed EVs allow Okidogi to outspeed threats like Adamant Torterra, Jolly Kingambit, and Jolly Azumarill, with the rest of the EVs maximizing Okidogi's specially defensive bulk, allowing it to comfortably survive offensive Heatran or Glimmora's Earth Power.</p> <p>Okidogi's crippling weakness to any Psychic-type attack makes Alolan Muk an essential teammate, being able to handle threats like Espathra, Iron Valiant, Hisuian Zoroark, and Hatterene with its STAB moves. Overqwil, while not as specially bulky, still provides a Psychic immunity while providing support in stacking entry hazards to ease Okidogi's sweep. Galarian Weezing similarly fills an important role with its immunity to Ground-type attacks from threats like Great Tusk, Mamoswine, and Clodsire. Once switched in, it can burn physical threats along with removing hazards, allowing Okidogi to have a much easier time switching in and setting up late-game. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can soak up special attacks from foes such as Greninja and Walking Wake, remove Landorus with Ice beam, and provides a Psychic neutrality and the ability to create Future Sight traps for Okidogi to exploit. Amoonguss provides assistance in scaring off Ground- and Water-types like Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Urshifu-R with its Grass-type STAB attacks and provides Spore support to give Okidogi a safe opportunity to switch in and begin setting up. Toxapex's solid physical bulk in conjunction with Haze and a Rocky Helmet provides utility in wearing threats down like Zamazenta, Mimikyu, and Ceruledge. Salazzle, thank to its high Speed and ability to wear down physical walls like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Corviknight with Corrosion-enabled Toxic and ability to impede setup sweepers, such as Baxcalibur, Manaphy, and Ogerpon formes, with Encore excels at removing threats Okidogi doesn't like. Glimmora provides similar Corrosion utility, along with the ability to set up hazards and threaten dangerous Flying-types like Dragonite, Moltres, and Zapdos with STAB Power Gem. It can also remove hazards with Mortal Spin to give Okidogi safe entry. Choice Specs Iron Moth's Overheat is great at removing dangerous threats such as Gliscor and Landorus instantly, along with using Discharge to remove Flying- and Water-types like Moltres, Enamorus, and Toxapex. Gengar has valuable utility in its ability to remove pesky Ghost-types like Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Brambleghast along with being able to Trick its Choice Specs onto walls like Clodsire, making them far easier to break through. Choice Scarf Sneasler makes a solid friend for Okidogi, being able to handle faster threats like Baxcalibur and Chien-Pao, along with using Switcheroo against their shared checks like Skeledirge and Quagsire.</p>"

However, Ogerpon faces stiff competition from other offensive Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana, as well as the other Ogerpon formes that possess a beneficial dual typing and an automatic 1.2x boost to their attacks. Superpower allows Ogerpon to wreak havoc on defensive cores using Ferrothorn and Heatran as Grass-type switch-ins, scoring a clean OHKO on Heatran and heavily denting physically defensive Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance. Meadow Plate is the item of choice, OHKOing Gliscor after Swords Dance with Stealth Rock chip, as well as potentially OHKOing Toxapex after Tera Grass and Swords Dance. Knock Off is Ogerpon's strongest option to hit Tornadus-T, Moltres, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking. Additionally, Defiant leverages Landorus-T's Intimidate against it; however, its poor matchup versus Defog users such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Corviknight render it unable to effectively switch in on Defog attempts and activate Defiant. Teammates that match up effectively into these aforementioned Defog users, such as Ting Lu, Mega Tyranitar, and Gliscor, serve as quality teammates, with Mega Tyranitar in particular being able to chip these foes into range of Ogerpon's attacks. Skarmory and Corviknight are also major roadblocks for Ogerpon, so teammates that can switch into them and force progress like Zapdos and Heatran make for effective teammates.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Ogerpon-W is a strong wallbreaker on Water teams by virtue of its access to Swords Dance combined with a damage multiplier from Wellspring Mask. Apart from this, its part Grass typing grants it a neutrality to Electric and Grass, which helps in matchups against foes such as Assault Vest Iron Hands and Thundurus-T. Aside from this, its ability makes it great in the Water mirror matchup, since it is able to switch safely into Manaphy without fearing burn from Scald. Its Water-type Ivy Cudgel is able to 2HKO Corviknight after a Swords Dance. Horn Leech allows Ogerpon-W access to some form of longevity, with the potential to recover a good amount of HP after a Swords Dance. It notably 2HKOes Rotom-W without a Swords Dance boost and 2HKOes Toxapex after one, which most Water-types struggle against; however, it has to be wary of the former carrying Will-O-Wisp. Play Rough grants Ogerpon-W coverage against the Dragon-types that resist both its STAB moves, such as Baxcalibur and Kommo-o, while Trailblaze allows it to outpace the likes of Chien-Pao and unboosted Iron Valiant after it is used once. Knock Off grants Ogerpon-W some degree of utility, being able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Dragonite and Amoonguss to make them more vulnerable to entry hazards; it also hits Sinistcha and Brambleghast, which resist both of Ogerpon-W's STAB moves.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott and Empoleon make for good partners for Ogerpon-W, as the two of them are able to stack hazards to make Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking easier. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott is also able to outspeed and remove faster threats to Ogerpon-W like Chien-Pao and Dragapult, while Empoleon can bring it in safely with Flip Turn, wall Alolan Ninetales, and provide a neutrality to Freeze-Dry. In return, Hisuian Samurott appreciates Ogerpon-W breaking through Corviknight, while Empoleon benefits from the removal of Great Tusk. Pelipper makes for another great teammate for Ogerpon-W, setting up rain to strengthen Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel. Aside from rain, Pelipper can pivot into Ogerpon-W via U-turn and threaten Hisuian Lilligant and Amoonguss with Hurricane. Entry hazards from the likes of Gastrodon, Toxapex, and Quagsire can wear down incoming foes for Ogerpon-W to take advantage of. Quagsire can also remove setup sweepers that can outspeed and threaten Ogerpon-W out like Dragonite and Baxcalibur thanks to a combination of Unaware and Toxic, while Toxapex is able to serve as a wall against the likes of Chien-Pao and Meowscarada. As Ogerpon-W struggles with certain bulky Pokemon, such as Galarian Weezing and Zamazenta, it appreciates teammates that can either remove them or wear them down for Ogerpon-W to finish off, such as boosted Manaphy for the former and Basculegion-F under rain for the latter. Urshifu-R pairs well with Ogerpon-W, as it can break bulky Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon. Lastly, Toxapex and Amoonguss can stop any Ogerpon-W wallbreaking attempts; hence, Choice Specs users such as Walking Wake and Greninja make for great partners.</p>"

          "description": "<p>A complementary typing and a great Attack stat, especially when considering the 1.2x boost from its Wellspring Mask, give Ogerpon-W a niche as a powerful wallbreaker. Water- and Grass-type attacks hit most Pokemon for at least neutral damage, and after a Swords Dance boost, anything that doesn't resist its STAB combination is KOed. Even checks such as Baxcalibur and Tera Grass Heatran struggle to take a Swords Dance-bolstered Ivy Cudgel, and some of the stoutest walls, such as Toxapex, take heavy damage from a boosted Power Whip. Ivy Cudgel is its strongest Water-type STAB option and hits most Pokemon for neutral damage. Power Whip punishes common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Alomomola and is preferred to Wood Hammer despite the potential inaccuracy to avoid recoil. Horn Leech can also be used in order to supplement Ogerpon-W's longevity and let it come in more often. Trailblaze is another niche option, usually seen on Aurora Veil or dual screens hyper offense teams, boosting Ogerpon-W's Speed and allowing it to sweep. Play Rough notably hits Dragon-types that otherwise could resist Ogerpon-W's STAB combination such as Baxcalibur and Dragonite. Superpower is another great option, notably KOing Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance boost. Due to its great wallbreaking capability, setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Booster Energy Iron Valiant appreciate defensive cores being heavily weakened, allowing them to sweep. Water Absorb is a particularly useful ability prior to Terastallizing, as Ogerpon-W can find opportunities to set up on Pokemon such as Mega Swampert and Manaphy, as well as block Alomomola's Flip Turn. Ogerpon-W also appreciates entry hazards from Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T, as the chip helps it pressure defensive cores even further. Despite all this, bulky Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Kartana can check Ogerpon-W, so Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Medicham, and Zapdos are beneficial as teammates. Ogerpon-W is also threatened by faster attackers like Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny, so defensive pivots such as Landorus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Mega Scizor are also extremely useful. Despite being locked to Tera Water, this is actually very beneficial to Ogerpon-W, taking away its weaknesses to Flying- and Poison-type attacks and letting it stay in on threats such as Tornadus-T and Sneasler. In addition, Tera Water boosts its Ivy Cudgel to stupendous amounts, 2HKOing Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock and minimal chip at +2. The 1.5x Special Defense boost granted upon Terastallizing can also help mitigate attempts to revenge kill Ogerpon-W by foes like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p>"

Additionally, Mystic Water variants of Urshifu-R get outsped and OHKOed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bad matchups for Ogerpon-H include Pokemon such as Entei and Raging Bolt that can wall its STAB combation.

Lastly, despite having solid bulk, powerful threats that can outspeed Ogerpon-H can OHKO it such as Choice Scarf Urshifu-R.

Sturdy allows Ogerpon-C to take a hit from and remove faster threats like Barraskewda, as well as Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos after a Swords Dance. Ivy Cudgel deals with threats like Ogerpon-H, Baxcalibur, and Enamorus, while also OHKOing Dragonite and Heatran after a Swords Dance. Horn Leech is a good Grass STAB move, being able to hurt Ground- and Water-types like Quagsire and Ting-Lu and OHKO Walking Wake after a boost. Horn Leech's recovery is useful for extending Ogerpon-C's longevity and can let Sturdy be used again if it brings Ogerpon-C back to full HP. Superpower is a strong coverage move as it is able to deal with Steel- and Dark-types like Iron Treads, Hisuian Goodra, Urshifu-S, and Kingambit while being able to OHKO Snorlax at +2.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Glimmora, with its colorful moveset, deals with faster threats that outspeed Ogerpon-C like non-Choice-Scarf Greninja, Kommo-o, and Iron Valiant. In return, Ogerpon-C deals with Azumarill and Ursaluna-B for Glimmora. Air Balloon Glimmora can switch into threatening Ground-type moves while taking on foes like Great Tusk, clear entry hazards with Mortal Spin to make sure Ogerpon-C's Sturdy isn't broken, and sets its own hazards to enable Ogerpon-C's sweep. Tyranitar sets up sand to allow Ogerpon-C to set up easier due to the Special Defense boost, allowing Ogerpon-C to survive a Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Walking Wake. Tyranitar also acts as a specially defensive tank for Ogerpon-C and deals with Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Spectrier. Ogerpon-C aids Tyranitar by dealing with Landorus-T and non-Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott. Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine is a strong wallbreaker, using Head Smash and Flare Blitz to break through walls like Gholdengo and Corviknight. Hisuian Arcanine appreciates Ogerpon-C being able to deal with pesky Water- and Ground-types like Belly Drum Azumarill, Landorus, and Sandy Shocks. Coalossal is a decent physical wall that can remove hazards, which prevents Ogerpon-C's Sturdy from breaking, and deals with Chien-Pao, Kingambit, Scizor, and Corviknight. Coalossal also sets up Spikes to enhance Ogerpon-C's wallbreaking. Ogerpon-C takes care of Ursaluna-B and Manaphy for Coalossal. Iron Defense + Body Press Garganacl can act as a defensive stallbreaker, using Salt Cure to weaken impediments to Ogerpon-C sweeping, like Skeledirge, Dondozo, and Hisuian Goodra. Ogerpon-C shuts down Choice Band Mamoswine, which would otherwise destroy Garganacl. Lead Kleavor is another option that can set Stealth Rock with Stone Axe, potentially breaking a Focus Sash on Ceruledge, Breloom, and Ribombee that can hinder Ogerpon-C's sweeps otherwise. Assault Vest Diancie eases the Fighting and Dragon matchups by being able to take on non-Choice Band Urshifu-S, Iron Valiant, Baxcalibur, and Dragapult. Alolan Golem can trap and eliminate Steel-types such as Corviknight and Scizor for Ogerpon-C. In return Ogerpon-C destroys Ground-types like Quagsire and Ursaluna-B.</p>"

However, Ogerpon-C should be mindful about using its Tera, as this removes its Sturdy for an arguably worse +1 Defense. Power Whip is used for its higher Base Power, which reduces Ogerpon-C's reliance on Swords Dance for immediate power, while Horn Leech trades damage for healing and reliability. Superpower allows Ogerpon-C to hit Ferrothorn, although this breaks Sturdy, along with Tera Steel foes like Iron Valiant. Ogerpon-C's main weakness lies in its reliance on Sturdy to set up against more powerful foes and its lack of immediate power before setting up. Thus, it is better off being saved as a cleaner for the later stages of a game. Entry hazard support, in particular Spikes, is highly valued to allow Ogerpon-C to KO many more threats; it can capitalize on hazard chip, for instance KOing even bulky foes like defensive Great Tusk unboosted once they are chipped. Thus, allies that can set hazards early-game like Hisuian Samurott and Garchomp are good partners. Ogerpon-C is also held back by its middling Speed tier, which leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed by Mega Lopunny, as it is capable of bypassing Sturdy, along with many other foes like Iron Valiant if Ogerpon-C has already lost Sturdy. Thus, Pokemon like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele that can threaten these frailer foes make for good allies.</p>"

Rillaboom provides Fake Out support, as well as passive healing through Grassy Terrain and priority with Grassy Glide that discourages the opponent from leading with Urshifu-R. Dual screens from Grimmsnarl and damage reduction from Incineroar's Intimidate or Snarl are also useful for keeping Archaludon alive to stack Stamina or Electro Shot stat increases.</p> </li> <li> <p>Archaludon fits well on rain teams thanks to its Grass and Electric resistances. It appreciates teammates such as Pelipper that can check opposing Ground- and Fighting-types like Landorus and both Urshifu formes; Pelipper's rain support also allows Electro Shot to charge in one turn, OHKOing Urshifu-R and Tornadus. Archaludon also functions well on Trick Room teams due to many of its checks being faster than it, such as both Urshifu formes, Landorus, and Chien-Pao running Sacred Sword. Farigiraf pairs notably well with Archaludon on Trick Room teams due to the protection from priority it provides and its access to Psychic Noise, which disables Iron Hands's Drain Punch.</p> </li> </ul>",

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its great typing, good bulk, and signature move Electro Shot, Archaludon is born to be an excellent wallbreaker on rain teams. The dual STAB moves and Electro Shot are must-haves for Archaludon as a rain wallbreaker; the last slot, however, is a bit flexible. Body Press and Aura Sphere both complement Archaludon's coverage to break through Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. The former receives a boost from Stamina and deals with Heatran and Ting-Lu better, while the latter is more consistent with Electro Shot boosts in rain and avoids chip damage from Iron Barbs. Stealth Rock can be used as an alternative choice on non-Assault Vest sets to allow teammates like Mega Swampert to run coverage moves like Ice Punch and Ferrothorn to run Spikes. Archaludon can threaten premier entry hazard removers such as Tornadus-T and Landorus-T, ensuring Stealth Rock stays up. Depending on the pacing of the team, different items and EV spreads are available for Archaludon. Leftovers is used to increase its longevity, which helps long-term. Eject Pack can be favored to keep the momentum up by preventing Archaludon from being stuck on the field against pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Assault Vest Iron Crown after its Special Attack is lowered by Draco Meteor. Assault Vest makes up for Archaludon's weak Special Defense and often lets it trade with one or more offensive threats like Tapu Lele and Iron Moth. To pair with Assault Vest, a bulky spread of 204 HP EVs is used, while 52 Speed EVs still allow Archaludon to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T. Tera Flying provides an immunity to Ground-type moves from Landorus-T and Garchomp and a resistance to Fighting-type moves from the likes of Zamazenta. Tera Fairy also grants a resistance to Fighting-type moves and is a better defensive type overall due to only having a few weaknesses as well as not being weak to Stealth Rock. Pelipper is a necessary teammate, as its Drizzle enables Archaludon to take advantage of Electro Shot. Other Water-type wallbreakers such as Mega Swampert and Ogerpon-W are also appreciated for their ability to break through bulky Ground-type Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Gliscor. In return, those Water-type wallbreakers appreciate Archaludon's ability to beat opposing Ogerpon-W.</p>"

It also deals decent damage to uncommon Steel-types that are immune to Thunderbolt like in Excadrill and Iron Treads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel Beam</strong>: Steel Beam is absurdly powerful, with even bulky Steel-resistant Pokemon like Scizor needing Assault Vest to avoid a 2HKO! This does come at the cost of ruining Sturdy by losing half of Archaludon's health, though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Aura Sphere</strong>: While risky to be locked into because of Ghost-types, Aura Sphere deals plenty of damage to Chi-Yu and opposing Archaludon without committing to a Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Pulse</strong>: Dragon Pulse is a less risky back-up to Draco Meteor, making the revenge killing of Dragon-types like Dragonite less risky.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: While Stamina is potentially workable with Archaludon's good bulk, Sturdy is highly recommended for ensuing very few Pokemon can OHKO it without Stealth Rock support, making it far more difficult to check offensively!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modest versus Timid</strong>: Modest's extra power is preferred if using Dark Pulse for a potential OHKO on offensive Gholdengo, but Timid is a reasonable consideration for outspeeding Adamant Urshifu formes, Timid Gholdengo, and Jolly Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Archaludon focuses so much on offense that Terastallization is best for either dealing more damage or giving it useful immunities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar's one-time boost per type makes Archaludon a fearsomely flexible wallbreaker, with even support Landorus-T sets being OHKOed by Draco Meteor and Steel Beam!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Floating with Tera Flying is a strong way to punish attempts to revenge kill Archaludon with Ground-type attacks, with Landorus-T and and Ursaluna-B in particular being ripe targets. The Fighting resistance also comes in handy if Sturdy is broken by a weak attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy ruins strong special attacking Dragon-types like Choice Specs Latios, and it makes Archaludon a solid Urshifu-S check even when Sturdy isn't in play.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Tera Dragon's defensive benefits aren't strong beyond resisting Ogerpon-H's STAB attacks, but a consistently powerful Draco Meteor makes it a good offensive choice.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel's Fairy resistance can save Archaludon from revenge kills if a weak attack has broken Sturdy, but its main use is for firing off an extremely powerful Steel Beam twice.</p> </li> </ul>"

          "description": "<p>Gouging Fire is a very powerful Dragon Dance sweeper with solid longevity thanks to its bulk and access to reliable recovery. Flare Blitz is a strong STAB move with reliable power; however, Heat Crash can be used instead to avoid recoil damage, though its variable Base Power can sometimes backfire against heavier targets like Great Tusk. Earthquake can be used to hit Fire-resistant targets like Raging Bolt and offer overall solid neutral coverage. For the last slot, Morning Sun grants Gouging Fire longevity, while Dragon Claw hits Dragapult and Roaring Moon hard. Outrage is also an option for more power against Fire-resistant targets such as Toxapex and Dondozo, but the fact that it locks the user into using it and leaves Gouging Fire vulnerable to Fairy- and Steel-types makes it less than ideal. Scale Shot, in conjunction with Loaded Dice, also has more power than Dragon Claw and lets Gouging Fire snowball further by boosting its Speed, but it leaves Gouging Fire vulnerable to entry hazards and doesn't boost its overall damage output unlike Booster Energy. An Adamant nature maximizes Gouging Fire's damage output, but a Jolly nature can be used to outrun the likes of Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Choice Scarf Meowscarada at +2 while avoiding the Speed tie with Dragapult and outrunning Choice Scarf Gholdengo at +1. Heavy-Duty Boots patches up Gouging Fire's crippling hazard weakness, while Booster Energy can also be used to further bolster Gouging Fire's damage output, letting it 2HKO non-defensive Great Tusk with Flare Blitz. Tera Fairy is an overall solid defensive typing that lets Gouging Fire resist Sucker Punch from Kingambit and Dragon-type moves from the likes of Raging Bolt and Kyurem.  Tera Ground boosts Earthquake's damage output while giving Gouging Fire an immunity to Thunder Wave. Finally, Tera Flying is also an option, as it gives Gouging Fire an immunity to Ground-type moves, letting it dent Excadrill and Great Tusk more easily.</p> <p>Gouging Fire's potential as a powerful Dragon Dance sweeper means that it makes its home on offensive teams. Booster Energy sets have a glaring weakness to entry hazards, so they appreciate removal from Great Tusk as well as hazard deterrents such as Magic Bounce Hatterene and Taunt Deoxys-S. Deoxys-S is also able to set up Spikes and/or dual screens, giving Gouging Fire an easier time sweeping. Additionally, Gouging Fire makes an excellent addition to sun teams. On such teams, it appreciates wallbreakers like Venusaur, Raging Bolt, and Walking Wake that can muscle through its checks and break through physical walls that Gouging Fire struggles with such as Dondozo and Skeledirge. On non-sun teams, Pokemon that can break through the aforementioned walls, such as Darkrai and Enamorus, are appreciated, as are Pokemon that can lure physical walls in before denting them, such as Grass Knot Landorus-T. Gouging Fire can chip away at bulkier Pokemon such as Gliscor and defensive Landorus-T early-game, so Pokemon that share checks with it, such as Kingambit and offensive Great Tusk, appreciate it as a partner.</p>"

Outrage can be used as a nuke with Dragonium Z, letting Gouging Fire muscle past walls such as Dondozo through its sheer strength alone. Tera Ground can be used to power up Gouging Fire's Earthquake while allowing it to remove its weaknesses to revenge killers such as Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Great Tusk, allowing it to potentially win on the spot. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Gouging Fire to come in many times and attempt to set up, while Booster Energy gives Gouging Fire a one-time Attack boost that can be crucial in breaking past foes such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T while still allowing Gouging Fire to Terastallize. Teammates that struggle with Steel-types, like Tapu Lele and Pecharunt, appreciate Gouging Fire breaking through those Steel-types.

Earthquake lets Gouging Fire hit Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Toxapex. Morning Sun provides reliable recovery, letting Gouging Fire maintain a sweep, check Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Iron Valiant long term, and offset Flare Blitz recoil.

Flare Blitz allows Gouging Fire to hit heavier Pokemon that Gouging Fire can't hit as hard with Heat Crash, like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Raging Fury is an alternative option to this, as it is not a contact move and does not deal recoil damage. 168 Attack EVs and a Jolly Nature allow it to gain a Speed boost under sun with Protosynthesis. Even with this combination, Gouging Fire is still stopped by heavier foes that are also very physically bulky, such as Garganacl, Great Tusk and Dondozo. Choice Band Gouging Fire is also very prone to entry hazard chip, as it does not hold Heavy-Duty Boots. Because of these reasons, Gouging Fire largely appreciates hazard removal options like Great Tusk and Iron Treads that also synergize well with sun setters, which are Torkoal and Mega Charizard Y. Great Tusk is great under sun as it can be a good wallbreaking partner with an Attack Protosynthesis boost. Great Tusk is also able to help wallbreak against some other Fire-resistant foes, such as Garganacl, chipped Alomomola, and opposing Great Tusk. Iron Treads , on the other hand, has Volt Switch to bring Gouging Fire in safely. Gouging Fire also greatly appreciates Pokemon that can threaten Alomomola and Dondozo on their weaker Special Defense side, like Raging Bolt and Mega Charizard Y. Raging Bolt can threaten Gouging Fire's common switch-ins like Dondozo and Alomomola with powerful Special attacks and super effective STAB moves and also use Volt Switch to bring Gouging Fire in very easily. Gouging Fire also supports Raging Bolt by threatening the Ground-types and Electric-resistant foes that can switch into it, such as Gliscor, Ferrothorn, Landorus-T. Mega Charizard Y is one of Gouging Fire's best partners, as it sets up sun with Drought, allowing Gouging Fire to boost its Speed with Protosynthesis, and can also break holes into opposing teams with Solar Beam and powerful Fire-type moves.</p>"

Morning Sun increases Gouging Fire's longevity and improves its setup ability. The specially defensive EV spread ensures that Gouging Fire outpaces Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane after a Dragon Dance, as well as makes Ice Beam from Choice Specs Greninja a 2HKO. Alternatively, the physically defensive EV spread ensures Choice Band Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash doesn't 2HKO Gouging Fire, and it also outspeeds Choice Specs Latios after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Baxcalibur is a great teammate due to its ability to threaten Ground-types, such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Ursaluna-B, while also being crucial in the Dragon matchup—if Gouging Fire opts for Morning Sun.

Archaludon offers utility options like Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave to ease Gouging Fire's sweeping, as well as acting as a resistance to Dragon and Rock, taking on Roaring Moon and Iron Boulder. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon threatens fast Dragon-types such as Latias and Dragonite at +1 Speed, when Multiscale is broken, and appreciates Gouging Fire removing Steel-types. Dragapult can spread status ailments like Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, breaks physical walls like Slowbro, Mandibuzz, and Rotom-W using Choice Specs, and removes Pokemon like Choice Scarf Latias and Roaring Moon with a Choice Scarf set. In return, Dragapult appreciates Gouging Fire's ability to remove Hisuian Goodra, Clodsire, and Alolan Muk, while Dragon Dance sets value the Will-O-Wisp immunity. Garchomp sets up entry hazards to wear down Pokemon like Primarina and Ting-Lu and heavily dents teams with its Swords Dance set to allow Gouging Fire to clean late-game. Choice Scarf Latias provides a Ground immunity and removes threats like Great Tusk and Kommo-o, as well as offers cleric support via Healing Wish to give Gouging Fire new life when weakened or inflicted by status. Raging Bolt breaks Water-types, such as Primarina and Toxapex, and heavily damages Ground-types like Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Gliscor after a Calm Mind. Hisuian Goodra is an excellent teammate for physically defensive Gouging Fire, as it stomachs hits from Latias, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Flutter Mane. Wallbreakers like Hydreigon and Choice Specs Latios remove Archaludon, Toxapex, and Slowbro. In return, Gouging Fire can combat threats such as Iron Valiant, Mimikyu, and Enamorus.

          "description": "<p>Raging Bolt is one of OU's fiercest offensive OU threats thanks to good bulk, a great Special Attack stat, and fantastic priority in Thunderclap allowing it to act both as a wallbreaker and sweeper while additionally threatening potent revenge killers. Raging Bolt threatens common metagame walls such as Skarmory, Dondozo, and Toxapex with its Electric-type STAB. Calm Mind allows Raging Bolt to gain a boost against walls like Heatran and Ting-Lu while also avoiding being OHKOed from threats like Kyurem, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus. Thunderclap lets Raging Bolt threaten Pokemon like Hisuian Samurott, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant. Dragon Pulse is preferred due to its higher PP and lack of a drawback, although Draco Meteor can be used for immediate breaking power and the ability to OHKO neutral threats such as Zamazenta and Rillaboom. Weather Ball can be used over Thunderbolt if Raging Bolt is used on a weather team, but it has to forgo reliable Electric-type STAB move. In rain, Weather Ball allows Raging Bolt to threaten Ground-types like Gliscor and Great Tusk, while under sun, Raging Bolt can hit Fire-types that resist its Dragon-type STAB move. The given EV spread is used to live Speed-boosting Great Tusk's Headlong Rush, as well as outspeeding Gliscor. Leftovers is preferred for longevity, but Booster Energy in conjunction with Protosynthesis can be used to threaten unboosted Gouging Fire and Dragonite. Tera Fairy is recommended to flip matchups on Dragon-type threats such as the aforementioned Gouging Fire and Dragonite, as well as Walking Wake and Dragapult, by evading their super effective Dragon-type attacks. Tera Flying is the final option, providing Raging Bolt an immunity to Ground-type attacks from Excadrill, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu.</p> <p>Raging Bolt fits well on rain, sun, hyper and bulky offense teams due to hits good bulk and Special Attack, so weather setters such as Torkoal and Pelipper are ideal. Raging Bolt is also a good partner for physical wallbreakers like Iron Boulder and Gouging Fire, as they both enjoy Raging Bolt's ability to threaten Dondozo, while Rillaboom and Meowscarada appreciate Raging Bolt's ability to threaten Skarmory and Corviknight. Raging Bolt is threatened by faster Ground-types like Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk due to being unable to hit them with Thunderclap. Therefore, Rillaboom is a great teammate, as it provides another form of speed control in Grassy Glide as well as Grassy Terrain recovery, which also halves the damage of Earthquake. On weather teams however, there are a multitude of ways to deal with the aforementioned Ground-types. On sun teams, Torkoal and Walking Wake are beneficial, while on rain teams, Barraskweda and Pelipper are good teammates. Walking Wake, Barraskewda, and Pelipper deal with Ground-types, while Torkoal helps Raging Bolt activate Protosynthesis. Raging Bolt also has a poor Speed tier, so speed control options such as Darkrai, Iron Valiant, and Weavile are good teammates, threatening Raging Bolt's common Dragon-type checks like Dragapult and Kyurem. Raging Bolt also fears entry hazards, as they can break down its defensive profile, especially if it forgoes Leftovers. Therefore, hazard control from Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hatterene, and Corviknight is appreciated.</p>"

Raging Bolt’s good typing allows it to break through defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and bulky Water-types like Alomomola, Toxapex, and Rotom-W while also checking threats like Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Kartana. Thunderclap offsets Raging Bolt’s subpar Speed stat, allowing it to revenge kill offensive threats such as Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Lopunny as well as weakened setup sweepers like Iron Boulder, Volcarona, and Swords Dance Kartana, while Thunderbolt gives Raging Bolt a consistent damaging attack that doesn’t rely on prediction like Thunderclap and has significantly higher PP, allowing Raging Bolt to use its Electric-type moves in longer games. Substitute is an alternative to nullify passive Pokémon that can’t touch Raging Bolt such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos and give it more opportunities to set up, while Taunt can be used to deny setup from Garganacl and Mega Scizor but at the cost of a worse matchup against Galarian Slowking. Draco Meteor in tandem with Dragonium Z lets it break through Electric-immune Pokemon such as Gliscor, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu as well as other specially bulky Pokémon that can take on Raging Bolt such as Mega Tyranitar and Galarian Slowking. Alternatively, Leftovers is also an option on Substitute sets to passively heal the chip taken from Substitute and give Raging Bolt some form of recovery. Tera Flying grants Raging Bolt a Ground immunity while giving a Fighting resistance that helps against Great Tusk and Zamazenta while also avoiding any Ground-type coverage from Serperior. Tera Fairy gives this same Fighting resistance while giving Raging Bolt an immunity to Dragon-type moves from the likes of Garchomp and Gouging Fire. The given EV spread allows Raging Bolt to live a +2 Superpower from Ogerpon-W after Stealth Rock, as well as outspeeding uninvested Landorus-T. Raging Bolt struggles against fast Ground- and Fairy-types like Garchomp, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Great Tusk, Tapu Koko, Iron Valiant, and especially Tapu Lele; Tapu Lele in particular can give Raging Bolt some trouble as well, as its Psychic Surge renders Thunderclap useless. Teammates like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, and Galarian Slowking help beat these checks. Since Raging Bolt has no reliable recovery, Alomomola is a good partner to pass huge HP wishes to it and pivot it in. Other pivots like Tornadus-T, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T also help bring Raging Bolt in safely. Teammates like Great Tusk and Zamazenta appreciate Raging Bolt taking care of Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos as well as bulky Waters like Rotom-W and Alomomola. In return, they help check Ferrothorn and Weavile. Great Tusk is another good partner, because it helps remove entry hazards, which harm Raging Bolt greatly, particularly Spikes.</p>"

Close Combat hits targets such as Archaludon, Kingambit, and Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Earthquake can be used over Close Combat, forgoing the Ting-Lu matchup for a better matchup into non-Air Balloon Gholdengo. These moves can be run in conjunction with each other, but in that case Iron Boulder has difficult matchups against Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Zen Headbutt can be used to improve these matchups as well as provide a reliable means of revenge killing Booster Energy Iron Valiant, again in exchange for the Gholdengo matchup. Substitute is also a viable option, and it can be used to ease Iron Boulder's matchup versus Sucker Punch from Kingambit, as well as allowing it to avoid Thunder Wave from Galarian Slowking as it sets up. Given a free turn to set it up, Substitute can also allow Iron Boulder to avoid being revenge killed by priority, such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. However, its main use case is with Tera, as Substitute + Tera Flying allows Iron Boulder to circumvent Gliscor (which otherwise would be a solid check) and turn it into setup fodder by avoiding both Toxic and Earthquake. Tera Fighting boosts the power of Close Combat, notably helping Iron Boulder brute force its way past Skarmory, while also allowing it to OHKO Ting-Lu after a Swords Dance. It also provides a Sucker Punch resistance, which helps versus Kingambit. Tera Ground can be used to boost the power of Earthquake, guaranteeing the OHKO on bulkier variants of Gholdengo at +2 as well as helping Iron Boulder avoid being picked off by Raging Bolt's Thunderclap. Tera Flying not only lets Iron Boulder wall Gliscor in combination with Substitute but also grants it a resistance to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and facilitates setup opportunities versus other Ground-types like Great Tusk and Landorus-T.</p> <p>Iron Boulder's power and its top-tier speed, alongside its good coverage and access to Swords Dance, make it very suitable for hyper offense teams. Teammates such as Kingambit appreciate the weakening of shared checks such as Landorus-T and Skarmory. The same goes for Iron Moth but with Ting-Lu and Gliscor. Iron Valiant also appreciates Gliscor being weakened and can whittle down shared checks such as Gholdengo to make it easier for Iron Boulder to sweep later. Iron Boulder struggles with entry hazard damage putting it in KO range of priority moves such as Kingambit’s Sucker Punch and Rillaboom’s Grassy Glide after Tera. Teammates that are effective at keeping hazards off your side such as Taunt Deoxys-S, Glimmora, Hatterene, or Great Tusk are good partners. The first two also provide their own hazards, facilitating the weakening of Iron Boulder's checks. Iron Boulder also has difficulty overcoming Dondozo. Partners that can weaken it or take advantage of it, such as Taunt Roaring Moon or Ogerpon-W, respectively, are good partners. Volcarona is also a good partner, as it takes advantage of Iron Boulder checks such as Skarmory, Gholdengo, and Rillaboom and turns them into setup fodder.</p>"

It has access to a strong STAB move in Mighty Cleave that bypasses Protect, which can be useful against a weakened Gliscor. Close Combat has great coverage alongside Mighty Cleave and hits Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Garganacl, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Tyranitar for massive damage, being able to OHKO all of them at +2 Attack with Tera Fighting. Zen Headbutt hits Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Urshifu-R. Substitute allows Iron Boulder to scout for switches, as well as become immune to certain status moves like Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp. Iron Boulder can use Tera Flying to become immune to Earthquake that would otherwise OHKO it from Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Great Tusk. If your team has Tapu Koko to provide Electric Terrain, one option is to use Rockium Z over Booster Energy to power up Mighty Cleave to insane levels, OHKOing Gliscor and all but the bulkiest Landorus-T with Stealth Rock support after a Swords Dance. However, this option does make Iron Boulder dependent on Electric Terrain to retain its boosted Speed. Tapu Koko can also set up Reflect and Light Screen to help facilitate a sweep. Iron Boulder fits best on highly offensive teams, and functions as a late-game cleaner as well as a emergency check to speedy threats including Dragon Dance users like Gouging Fire and Booster Energy Iron Valiant. Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Mega Lopunny, and Urshifu-R benefit from having Iron Boulder on the team, as Iron Boulder can take advantage of and switch into Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T that such allies are weak to. Teammates such as Hawlucha, Kartana and Iron Valiant can appreciate Rockium Z Iron Boulder's massive damage onto Landorus-T and Gliscor. Non-Rockium Z Iron Boulder can struggle with Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Great Tusk. Because of this, having a switch-in like your own Landorus-T or Gliscor is very helpful. Additionally, Iron Boulder can be revenge killed by Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, so having answers to it like Volcarona and Gouging Fire is important. Iron Boulder appreciates hazard support from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Glimmora, as it can chip checks that would otherwise just fall short of a KO. Furthermore, physical wallbreakers such as Kartana and Mega Lopunny that can put Landorus-T and Gliscor in range of a +2 Mighty Cleave are also appreciated, especially since Gliscor can’t use Protect to heal with Poison Heal against Mighty Cleave, and Landorus-T doesn't have any reliable recovery. Finally, Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Volcarona that can break through foes like Alomomola, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mega Scizor are also greatly appreciated.</p>"

Mighty Cleave is Iron Boulder's main STAB move, allowing it to revenge kill common threats such as Chien-Pao, Choice Specs Flutter Mane after Stealth Rock damage, and Gouging Fire. Megahorn can be run on this set over Zen Headbutt in order to hit Hoopa-U, Slowbro, and Ogerpon-W. Earthquake provides valuable coverage against Steel-types immune to Close Combat such as non-Air Balloon Gholdengo and Heatran, as well as Poison-types immune to Zen Headbutt like Alolan Muk. Finally, Close Combat allows Iron Boulder to threaten Dark-types such as Greninja and Chien-Pao as well as hit most Steel-types for good damage. It also targets major annoyances for Psychic teams such as Blissey and Hisuian Goodra.</p> <p>Latios is a great teammate for Iron Boulder, as it provides a Ground immunity with Levitate and breaks through threats such as Corviknight and Gliscor with Thunderbolt and Luster Purge. It can also pivot Iron Boulder into threats that it cannot break down on its own, such as Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Kingambit, with Flip Turn. Indeedee is another good pick alongside Iron Boulder, as it offers a Ghost immunity to take on Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball as well as Psychic Terrain support, preventing Iron Boulder from being revenge killed by priority moves such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit or Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R. Indeedee also provides Healing Wish support to let Iron Boulder clean up weakened teams late-game. Hoopa-U is a dangerous wallbreaker that appreciates Iron Boulder giving it speed control. In return, it can take on Ghost-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball pretty handily thanks to its decent Special Defense, while threatening those Ghost-types in return. It can also break through defensive cores Iron Boulder can struggle to beat, such as Corviknight and Landorus-T on Flying or Air Balloon Gholdengo and Corviknight on Steel. Deoxys-S can either soften up opposing teams with its entry hazard support or become a fearsome wallbreaker with Expanding Force while in Psychic Terrain, while threatening Corviknight and Gliscor with Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, respectively. Slowbro is a great physical wall, being able to swallow physical attacks aimed at Iron Boulder like Earthquake from Excadrill and Liquidation from Barraskewda. Slowbro can also serve as a pseudo-check to Ceruledge if it has used its Eject Button, which can give a safe switch-in opportunity for Iron Boulder to take advantage of. Finally, Slowbro can deal with some Dark-types like Ting-Lu one on one with Body Press. Both Metagross and Jirachi can set Stealth Rock to soften up answers to Iron Boulder like Corviknight and Gliscor, and both have other advantages: Metagross has Knock Off to further weaken defensive checks and Bullet Punch to threaten Flutter Mane, while Jirachi can pivot Iron Boulder onto the field with U-turn. Espathra is a good setup sweeper that appreciates Iron Boulder chipping its answers into range of Dazzling Gleam while being able to run away with games once its checks, such as Ting-Lu, are gone. Hatterene prevents Iron Boulder from having to take chip damage from hazards when it has to revenge kill a threat while doing fairly well into the majority of Dark-types thanks to its part-Fairy typing.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Iron Boulder is an amazing Choice Scarf user on Rock teams due to its amazing Speed tier and part-Psychic typing, which gives it a key role in the Fighting matchup. Choice Scarf Iron Boulder outspeeds and OHKOes common Choice Scarf users like Sneasler, Meowscarada, and Enamorus; it also outspeeds Regieleki, which can be an issue for Rock teams. Mighty Cleave allows Iron Boulder to take out Choice Scarf Enamorus after Stealth Rock, Ogerpon-H, and non-Sucker Punch Chien-Pao. Zen Headbutt lets Iron Boulder deal with Fighting- and Poison-types like Iron Valiant and Sneasler. Earthquake deals with Heatran, Alolan Muk, and Gholdengo, while Close Combat OHKOes Greninja, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine can act as a wallbreaker for Iron Boulder, being able to take on physical walls such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and defensive Gholdengo with Head Smash and Flare Blitz. Hisuian Arcanine can also run a Heavy-Duty Boots set with Will-O-Wisp to annoy Kingambit. Swords Dance Ogerpon-C is an excellent partner, being able to handle Ground- and Water-types such as Mamoswine, Quagsire, and Keldeo. Glimmora is a nice special attacker that deals with walls Iron Boulder can't break through, like Quagsire and Sableye, with its colorful coverage. Glimmora's Toxic Debris comes in handy in the Fairy matchup as well, and it even removes entry hazards with Mortal Spin. Shell Smash Minior can act as a setup sweeper, being able to dent holes in Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Iron Hands so that Iron Boulder can pick them off late-game; providing a Ground immunity for the team is also much appreciated. Kleavor can set up Stealth Rock with Stone Axe, breaking Focus Sashes on common users like Ceruledge and Cloyster. Terrakion can take out Ursaluna-B, Kingambit, Archaludon, and Hisuian Goodra for Iron Boulder. Ghost-types like Dragapult, Spectrier, and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane hurt Iron Boulder's chances of sweeping, so Tyranitar serves as a great partner by checking them and providing sand to boost the team's Special Defense. Coalossal is a good partner, being able to check threats like Scizor, Corviknight, and Kingambit, which would threaten Iron Boulder. Coalossal also removes hazards and can set up its own hazards to ease Iron Boulder's sweeping. In return, Iron Boulder takes out Sneasler, Greninja, and Meowscarada for Tyranitar and Coalossal. IronPress Garganacl can act as a stallbreaker for the team, wearing down defensive Water- and Steel-types such as Gastrodon and Corviknight.</p>"

Psycho Cut covers important targets like Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Swampert, while Throat Chop reliably beats Gholdengo, and Sacred Sword beats Iron Treads and Hisuian Goodra. Iron Boulder has an awful defensive typing and greatly appreciates being brought in by slow pivots like Manaphy and Corviknight; thanks to its great Speed tier, it can usually force out the wallbreakers that come in on them in return. Iron Boulder also pairs well with other physically offensive threats like Barraskewda and Garchomp that can wear down opposing walls like Intimidate Corviknight with it.

Iron Boulder appreciates offensive pivots like Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon, as they're able to clean up after it has weakened the physical walls. Iron Boulder also appreciates defensive pivots like Corviknight and Swampert, as they can bring it in safely. Despite its amazing Speed stat, it's still prone to getting revenge killed by faster targets like Chien-Pao, Hisuian Electrode, and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon, making defensive walls like Corviknight, Meloetta, and Great Tusk necessary. Iron Boulder lacks damage without a boost from Swords Dance, so entry hazard setters like Deoxys-D, Sandy Shocks, and Skarmory are greatly appreciated, as they help chip foes into its KO range.</p>"

          "description": "<p>With an Assault Vest, Iron Crown becomes a nearly impenetrable special tank, capable of stomaching attacks from the tier's strongest wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Mega Diancie. However, its lack of longevity means it can be worn down very quickly by Spikes damage, making it only suitable for highly aggressive offense teams. Volt Switch complements such teams, bringing Iron Crown's wallbreaking teammates in safely against passive switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking. Psychic Noise punishes passive Pokemon which attempt to absorb Iron Crown's Volt Switch such as Gliscor and Ferrothorn by preventing them from healing, whereas Tachyon Cutter threatens less specially bulky Volt Switch blockers such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Future Sight combined with Volt Switch helps teammates such as Zamazenta and Urshifu-R. Alternatively, Focus Blast lets Iron Crown be more individually threatening, scaring Ferrothorn and Heatran, and dealing slightly more damage to Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar compared to Tachyon Cutter. The given EV spread maximizes Iron Crown's special bulk while allowing it to receive a Special Attack boost in Electric Terrain via Quark Drive, permitting it to be more threatening on offensive teams. A Calm nature and maximum Special Defense investment can be used instead to bolster Iron Crown's special bulk, especially if it forgoes Assault Vest for the increased longevity Heavy-Duty Boots provides. Tera Fairy is Iron Crown's preferred Tera type to invert its Dark weakness against Darkrai, Mega Tyranitar, and Hisuian Samurott; as another option Tera Water provides a Water resistance in a pinch against aggressive rain teams. Iron Crown fits best on offensive teams that appreciate a non-passive defensive backbone against special attackers that can provide support via pivoting and Future Sight. Landorus-T is its best partner, as it functions similarly as a pivot with access to Stealth Rock and U-Turn, complementing Iron Crown by checking physical attackers such as Garchomp and Gouging Fire. It also provides an Electric immunity, which Iron Crown appreciates as it fails to prevent Raging Bolt and Zapdos from freely setting up Calm Mind or pivoting with Volt Switch, respectively. In the same vein, Alomomola forms a potent defensive core alongside Iron Crown, pivoting into physical attackers and increasing Iron Crown's longevity via Wish support. Iron Crown's usage of Psychic Noise is bolstered by entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Heatran, as Psychic Noise ensures entry hazard damage sticks by disabling foes' passive Leftovers recovery. Iron Crown pairs well with Pokemon that pressure Ground-types such as Ogerpon-W and Urshifu-R, as they prevent Gliscor and Ting-Lu from hindering its functions as a pivot. Alternatively, Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Ursaluna can utilize Iron Crown pivoting out against walls such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking to find opportunites to wallbreak. Additionally, Iron Crown finds a role on Electric Terrain teams fueled by Tapu Koko, with a Quark Drive boost making it more threatening or even bulkier. In return, Iron Crown indirectly supports Tapu Koko by helping fellow teammates on Electric Terrain teams such as Hawlucha and Iron Valiant wallbreak, with Future Sight pressuring checks such as Toxapex and Zapdos.</p>"

        "Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<p>Calm Mind Iron Crown is a potent setup sweeper in the tier. With decent bulk and useful resistance, it is able to set up on some offensive Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Tornadus-T as well as ignore Toxic from passive Pokemon like Alomomola. Maximum Speed investment with just 172 Special Attack EVs ensures Iron Crown gets a Speed boost from Quark Drive, allowing it to outspeed many popular threats in the tier such as Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Zamazenta alongside common Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R, so it can set up first against the former foes and not be revenge killed by the latter. Focus Blast is a powerful coverage move that hits Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Hisuian Samurott, which are immune to Stored Power, for super effective damage. Iron Defense complements Calm Mind to turn Iron Crown into a nigh-indestructible powerhouse and provides a boost to Stored Power, while Tachyon Cutter can be used for its immediate damage output against Fairy-types and Garganacl or to better deal with opposing Psychic-type Pokemon such as Iron Boulder and Mega Latias better. Tera Fighting makes Focus Blast a STAB move, allowing it to OHKO Heatran unboosted and Ferrothorn at +1, as well as giving Iron Crown a resistance to Dark-type moves from Darkrai and Tyranitar that it would be weak to otherwise. Tera Flying provides an immunity to Ground-type moves from Landorus-T and Garchomp and a resistance to Fighting-type moves from the likes of Zamazenta, and is a better defensive type overall due to it only having a few weaknesses. Calm Mind Iron Crown only becomes dangerous after a few boosts, therefore, dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko are exceptional partners, as their screens provide more opportunities for Iron Crown to start setting up. Iron Crown also has great synergy with Tapu Lele, which provides Psychic Terrain to prevent it from being revenge killed by priority moves like Thunder Clap from Raging Bolt and Sucker Punch from Hisuian Samurott and Mega Mawile, as well as increase the damage of Stored Power.</p>"

Shadow Ball gives a consistent form of damage against teams that can keep Poison's status-spreading to a minimum while still hitting hard.

Nasty Plot is used to boost Pecharunt's STAB, allowing it to break through threats like Amoonguss, Gliscor, and Swampert without much issue.</p> <p>Salazzle and Glimmora provide immense support to Pecharunt by inflicting near-unblockable Toxic thanks to Corrosion, powering up Pecharunt's Hex and putting timers on specially bulky walls like Clodsire, Alolan Muk, and Hisuian Goodra. Salazzle, with its high speed and Fire-type STAB, also provides assistance in melting through Steel- and Ice-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Froslass which can otherwise prove troublesome. Meanwhile, Glimmora can blast through pesky Fire- and Flying-types like Ninetales, Articuno, and Pelipper along with setting entry hazards which Pecharunt can help to keep around longer with its Ghost typing blocking Rapid Spin from foes such as Alolan Sandslash, Forretress, and Avalugg. Amoonguss provides a switch-in to Ground-type threats such as Great Tusk, Hippowdon, and Excadrill with its Grass typing and spreads its own status with Spore, which Pecharunt can use to power up Hex. Toxapex helps by setting up Toxic Spikes for Pecharunt to make great use of with Hex and deals with powerful setup threats like Scizor, Chien-Pao, and Okidogi thanks to Haze. Galarian Weezing provides an incredible Ground immunity for threats like Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Mamoswine, spreads status with Will-O-Wisp, and removes entry hazards in case Pecharunt loses its Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off.. Alolan Muk provides an incredible Ghost resistance and Psychic immunity, letting it switch into threats like Spectrier, Flutter Mane, and Espathra with incredible ease. Galarian Slowking helps to deal with special threats like Latios, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant with its wide coverage and break the special attackers that Pecharunt detests. Pecharunt appreciates Fighting-types like Okidogi and Sneasler breaking through annoying Dark-types like Kingambit, Darkrai, and Chien-Pao while Pecharunt can handle opposing physical walls like Toxapex and Zamazenta, which otherwise stop them in their tracks. Iron Moth enjoys Pecharunt soaking up hits aimed at it from powerful threats like Kleavor, Hisuian Arcanine, and Iron Boulder, while Iron Moth can melt threats Pecharunt dislikes such as Froslass, Sinistcha, and opposing Pecharunt.</p>"

Additionally, Arghonaut's ability to force switches and strong matchup into Equilibra make it an excellent user of Spikes. Circle Throw phazes common setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Baxcalibur and whittles down the opposing team in conjunction with Spikes. Knock Off is Arghonaut's best way to force progress against walls such as Garganacl and Venomicon and deals heavy damage to Ghost-types trying to switch into Circle Throw such as Dragapult and Gholdengo. Leftovers provides Arghonaut with extra longevity and makes it less reliant on Recover, while Covert Cloak shields it from chip damage from Salt Cure and other bothersome secondary effects such as Special Defense drops from Shadow Ball. The given EVs allow Arghonaut to avoid the 2HKO from Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush and from Krilowatt's Tera Water Surf. Tera Fairy flips many of Arghonaut's bad matchups, letting it check a wide array of threats including Venomicon lacking Sludge Bomb, Krilowatt, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult.</p> <p>Arghonaut fits mostly on balance and stall teams that appreciate its ability to blanket check various offensive threats and force progress with Knock Off and Spikes. Stealth Rock setters such as Venomicon, Garganacl, and Ting-Lu are strong partners that can stack entry hazards with Arghonaut.

Ground-types such as Equilibra, Great Tusk, and Garchomp can deal with Electric- and Poison-types such as Iron Hands and Toxapex, while in return Arghonaut can switch into Greninja lacking Grass Knot. Skeledirge forms a formidable Unaware core with Arghonaut, taking on Jumbao, Venomicon, and Iron Valiant while Arghonaut covers it against threats like Snaelstrom, Garganacl, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Bulky setup sweepers such as Naviathan, Ceruledge, and Hatterene take advantage of Arghonaut whittling down their checks with Spikes and Knock Off over the course of the game.</p>"

          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Jumbao is one of the best Pokemon in the metagame thanks to its excellent offensive stats, defensive utility, and incredible ability in Drought, which enables a host of powerful offensive partners. Tera Blast Fire pressures the Steel- and Poison-types that resist Jumbao's STAB combination, such as Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Venomicon. Alternatively, if Jumbao is paired with teammates that rely on Terastallizing, Focus Blast can be used to retain the OHKO on Kingambit. Synthesis lets Jumbao continuously keep sun up with Heat Rock and outlast Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Roaring Moon. Tera Fire allows Jumbao to take advantage of Tera Blast Fire's coverage and improves its matchup against Steel-types such as Scizor and Gholdengo by removing its Steel weakness.</p> <p>Jumbao can fit comfortably on a variety of playstyles from bulky offense to balance thanks to the team support it provides through Drought. Fire-types such as Skeledirge, Cinderace, Ceruledge, and Iron Moth and Protosynthesis users such as Roaring Moon, Sandy Shocks, and Great Tusk are Jumbao's best offensive partners, as they all become extremely dangerous under sun. Since Jumbao is incredibly vulnerable to opposing Fire-types, defensive Pokemon that can handle them, such as Toxapex, Arghonaut, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, are excellent partners. The latter three can also set entry hazards to help Jumbao wallbreak, while Toxapex can handle opposing Jumbao and Glimmora. Toxapex and Hatterene can create momentum for sun teams with Eject Button, the latter of which also keeps entry hazards off the field for Fire-type teammates. Bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight and Equilibra can check Poison-types that Jumbao struggles to break such as Amoonguss and Venomicon and appreciate Jumbao handling their checks, such as Krilowatt and Great Tusk.</p>"

          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Jumbao picks off normally faster threats such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Krilowatt and supports offensive teammates with Healing Wish. Drought allows Jumbao to use Solar Beam quicker and provide sun support for teammates such as Great Tusk and Cinderace. Trace, on the other hand, allows Jumbao to copy valuable abilities such as Toxapex's Regenerator and Venomicon-E's Tinted Lens; however, it requires Jumbao to run Leaf Storm to retain a powerful Grass-type STAB move because of Solar Beam's two-turn wait outside of sun. Tera Fire with Tera Blast grants Jumbao coverage to hit Steel-types such as Corviknight and Gholdengo and resistances to key attacks such as Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Iron Valiant's Moonblast, and Baxcalibur's Ice Shard. Focus Blast, on the other hand, lets Jumbao OHKO Kingambit without Terastallizing.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Jumbao is a strong asset to bulky offense teams, providing them with speed control and incredibly useful Healing Wish support. Defensive pivots that lack reliable recovery, such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Equilibra, and Rotom-W, benefit immensely from Jumbao's ability to bring them back to full health late in the game, which gives them the freedom to take more hits early on. These Pokemon can also handle the Steel- and Fire-types that can take Jumbao's STAB attacks, such as Cinderace, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth. Pivots like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Cinderace can bring Jumbao in safely against Pokemon it threatens, such as Krilowatt and Hydreigon. Bulky setup sweepers such as Hatterene and Kingambit can break down teams for Jumbao to clean late-game and greatly appreciate Jumbao giving them a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish. Poison-types such as Toxapex, Venomicon, and Clodsire wall Jumbao, so wallbreakers that can threaten them, such as Dragapult, Baxcalibur, and Smokomodo, are good teammates. Lastly, if Jumbao opts to use Drought, it can set sun to support Fire-types such as Skeledirge and Iron Moth and Protosynthesis users such as Great Tusk and Roaring Moon.</p>"

          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Caribolt is a nuclear wallbreaker for offensive teams. Double-Edge with Galvanize can break through even the tier's most stalwart walls, 2HKOing Pokemon like Skeledirge and Garganacl with ease, especially once Caribolt Terastallizes. Horn Leech provides some modicum of recovery to compensate for Double-Edge's recoil. Rapid Spin both increases Caribolt's Speed, giving it sweeping potential, and supports teammates weak to Stealth Rock like Baxcalibur and Iron Moth, allowing them to forego Heavy-Duty Boots. Leftovers helps make up for Double-Edge's recoil alongside Horn Leech, while Magnet powers up Caribolt's Electric-type attacks even further. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Choice Scarf Jumbao at +1 Speed and Krilowatt at +0, but Adamant is an option to deal as much damage as possible, supporting its hyper offense teammates. Tera Grass is an option to turn Ground-types like Equilibra and Great Tusk into setup fodder, but Caribolt's main focus should be on wallbreaking as much as possible for its teammates.</p> <p>Caribolt is best utilized on hyper offense teams, which appreciate its incredible wallbreaking ability. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Iron Moth, Baxcalibur, and Venomicon-E appreciate Caribolt removing the hazard, allowing Iron Moth and Baxcalibur to run more offensive items over Heavy-Duty Boots. Other physical sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and Dragonite love Caribolt powering through Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Arghonaut; Roaring Moon pairs particularly well with Caribolt, as it can threaten the Grass-types like Jumbao and Amoonguss that give Caribolt trouble with Tera Flying + Acrobatics. This love is shared by special sweepers like Iron Valiant and Hatterene, which need Skeledirge off the table before attempting a sweep. Caribolt appreciates entry hazards weakening physically bulky Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu—which can beat Caribolt if it Terastallizes—into KO range of its attacks, so pairing it with a dedicated lead like Greninja or Meowscarada is suggested.</p>"

          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Equilibra's solid typing, great stats, and access to Rapid Spin make it one of the premier defensive pivots and entry hazard removers in the metagame. Levitate is the recommended ability, as it drastically improves Equilibra's matchups against opposing Ground-types, such as Clodsire and Garchomp, while also presenting more opportunities to clear entry hazards without worrying about taking Spikes damage. Alternatively, Bulletproof blocks Focus Blast from Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Jumbao and Shadow Ball from Ghost-types such as Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark. Protect allows Equilibra to scout the foe's moves and get additional healing from Leftovers, while Pain Split gives it an alternative form of recovery, lowering its reliance on Leftovers. Alternatively, Aura Sphere allows Equilibra to beat opposing Levitate Equilibra and improves its matchup against Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Colossoil. The given EV spread allows Equilibra to avoid an OHKO from Choice Specs Greninja's Hydro Pump, survive the combination of Moonblast into Close Combat from mixed Tera Fairy Iron Valiant, and outspeed Adamant Breloom after getting a Speed boost from Rapid Spin. Tera Water allows Equilibra to tank Fire-type attacks from Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Astrolotl, and Skeledirge. Alternatively, Tera Flying flips Equilibra's matchups against Fighting-types such as Great Tusk and Breloom on their heads while allowing Bulletproof Equilibra to safely stay in against opposing Ground-types.</p> <p>Equilibra struggles against Water- and Flying-types, so Electric-types such as Caribolt, Iron Hands, and Plasmanta make for great partners. Water-types such as Arghonaut and Rotom-W synergize well with Equilibra, since they can switch in on Fire-type attacks aimed at it; they, in turn, appreciate Equilibra's ability to absorb Electric-type attacks and pressure Jumbao, one of their greatest threats. Venomicon is one of the best defensive partners for Equilibra, since it walls many of the Fighting- and Ground-types that Equilibra struggles against such as Great Tusk; in return, Equilibra deals with Pokemon that Venomicon struggles against, such as Stratagem and Hatterene. Equilibra relies heavily on Leftovers for recovery, so it appreciates support from teammates that don't mind taking Knock Off, like Corviknight and Toxapex. Thanks to Equilibra's ability to consistently keep entry hazards off the field, it works well with teammates that are worn down by them, such as Snaelstrom, Iron Moth, and Loaded Dice Baxcalibur.</p>"
