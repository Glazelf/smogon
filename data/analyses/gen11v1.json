  "Hitmonlee": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its pitiful defenses and typing, Hitmonlee finds itself as a niche but quite useful Pokemon in RBY 1v1, thanks to its strong Attack, respectable Speed, and incredibly important matchup against Snorlax, the best Pokemon in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter can potentially be used to improve odds in Normal- and Fighting-type matchups like Machamp, opposing Hitmonlee, and Persian.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros is faster than Hitmonlee and can find easy 2HKOs with Body Slam and Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: While Hitmonlee can attempt to flinch it with Rolling Kick, it is not very likely, and Rhydon’s Earthquake is a 2HKO. Hitmonlee’s Rolling Kick is a 3HKO, and High Jump Kick has a very low chance to 2HKO Rhydon, so the matchup is in Rhydon's favor.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Hitmonlee Cannot Hit Super Effectively</strong>: Hitmonlee matches up really poorly against every strong special attacker due to its abysmal bulk, and without any super effective damage, Hitmonlee struggles to break through them. It particuarly struggles against Pokemon with Psychic- and Flying-type moves like Alakazam, Starmie, Exeggutor, Slowbro, Jynx, Gengar and Zapdos.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is one of Hitmonlee's signature moves and its strongest Fighting-type STAB move, letting it hit Snorlax, Kabutops, Chansey, and Lapras for massive damage. Jump Kick, while not as strong, is slightly more accurate, which helps with securing KOs after a High Jump Kick, especially against Snorlax. Rolling Kick allows Hitmonlee to attempt to flinch its way through slower Pokemon like Rhydon. Both Meditate and Substitute are used to punish a Counter from Chansey or Snorlax, Meditate is preferred for Reflect Chansey, while Substitute helps more against Snorlax.</p> <p>The main draw of Hitmonlee is how amazing it is against Snorlax and Chansey, two of the best Pokemon in the tier. Because of this, it is best to run teammates that don't like facing Snorlax and Chansey such as Alakazam, Jolteon, Zapdos, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Tauros. These Pokemon can help Hitmonlee in return by beating any threats that might do well against it such as the many Psychic-type Pokemon in the tier.</p>"

  "Articuno": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to one of the highest Special stats in the game along with the most powerful special move, Articuno is a decent offensive threat. Articuno's bulk helps it against physical attackers like Tauros and Snorlax as well as some special attackers like Chansey, letting it spam its Ice-type moves to land a freeze and end the game. Thanks to its Ice typing Articuno is immune to freeze, and this combined with its solid bulk and great power allows it to match up well into many bulky foes. However, Articuno's movepool is very limited with only Ice- and Normal-type moves to choose from, leaving it unable to deal with foes that resist its STAB Ice-type moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Articuno's movepool isn't very large, and it is usually limited to the four listed moves. Hyper Beam is the only move worth considering as an alternative, but it's only useful against Jynx, which is frail to physical attacks and resists Articuno's Ice moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Amnesia</strong>: Snorlax and Slowbro can set up Amnesia, tank a few hits from Articuno, and eventually 2HKO Articuno at +6. However, they have to be wary of getting frozen.</p> <p><strong>Electric moves</strong>: Electric-type Pokemon such as Jolteon and Zapdos, and Pokemon with strong electric coverage, like Starmie and Gengar, hit Articuno really hard while bulking Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Lapras and Jynx don't take much damage from Articuno, and they are able to hit it hard in return. Thanks to their Ice typing, they are immune to freeze, so Articuno really struggles against them.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Blizzard is Articuno's main STAB attack, threatening foes weak to it like Rhydon and dealing good damage to neutral targets like Tauros. Ice Beam is a weaker alternative than Blizzard, but it is viable thanks to its higher PP and better accuracy, letting Articuno fish for a freeze against bulky targets like Chansey. Reflect is useful against targets like physical Snorlax, and it's one of the few solid moves that is included in Articuno's movepool. Rest keeps Articuno healthy against bulky Pokemon like Chansey and Snorlax without Thunderbolt, giving it more chances to fish for a freeze.</p> <p>Articuno should be paired with Pokemon such as Snorlax and Tauros that can handle foes unbothered by Articuno's Ice-type attacks, such as Jynx, Slowbro, and Lapras. Rhydon is a good option, as it can take on troublesome Electric-type foes, such as Zapdos and Jolteon. Jolteon is another solid choice that is able to threaten bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Lapras and Starmie. Jolteon can also handle Zapdos for Articuno well. Alakazam is another solid partner that can handle Starmie, Lapras, Jolteon, Jynx, and Chansey carrying Thunderbolt.</p>"
