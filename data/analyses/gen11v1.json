    "overview": "<p>Despite its pitiful defenses and typing, Hitmonlee finds itself as a niche but quite useful Pokemon in RBY 1v1, thanks to its strong Attack, respectable Speed, and incredibly important matchup against Snorlax, the best Pokemon in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter can potentially be used to improve odds in Normal- and Fighting-type matchups like Machamp, opposing Hitmonlee, and Persian.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros is faster than Hitmonlee and can find easy 2HKOs with Body Slam and Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: While Hitmonlee can attempt to flinch it with Rolling Kick, it is not very likely, and Rhydon’s Earthquake is a 2HKO. Hitmonlee’s Rolling Kick is a 3HKO, and High Jump Kick has a very low chance to 2HKO Rhydon, so the matchup is in Rhydon's favor.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Hitmonlee Cannot Hit Super Effectively</strong>: Hitmonlee matches up really poorly against every strong special attacker due to its abysmal bulk, and without any super effective damage, Hitmonlee struggles to break through them. It particuarly struggles against Pokemon with Psychic- and Flying-type moves like Alakazam, Starmie, Exeggutor, Slowbro, Jynx, Gengar and Zapdos.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is one of Hitmonlee's signature moves and its strongest Fighting-type STAB move, letting it hit Snorlax, Kabutops, Chansey, and Lapras for massive damage. Jump Kick, while not as strong, is slightly more accurate, which helps with securing KOs after a High Jump Kick, especially against Snorlax. Rolling Kick allows Hitmonlee to attempt to flinch its way through slower Pokemon like Rhydon. Both Meditate and Substitute are used to punish a Counter from Chansey or Snorlax, Meditate is preferred for Reflect Chansey, while Substitute helps more against Snorlax.</p> <p>The main draw of Hitmonlee is how amazing it is against Snorlax and Chansey, two of the best Pokemon in the tier. Because of this, it is best to run teammates that don't like facing Snorlax and Chansey such as Alakazam, Jolteon, Zapdos, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Tauros. These Pokemon can help Hitmonlee in return by beating any threats that might do well against it such as the many Psychic-type Pokemon in the tier.</p>"
