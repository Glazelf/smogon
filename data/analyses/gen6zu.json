      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>Lairon is a dangerous Stealth Rock setter with its solid defensive typing, powerful Rock STAB move in Head Smash, and great coverage to discourage the entire tier from switching in safely. Lairon's Head Smash threatens to 2HKO many common defensive walls such as Swalot, Ivysaur, and Regenerator Duosion after Stealth Rock damage. Superpower hits Pokemon that resist Head Smash such as Scraggy, Klang, and opposing Lairon. Heavy Slam is preferred in the last slot as another STAB move that is stronger against lighter foes like Carbink and Vibrava. Roar is an alternative option to phaze Pokemon that want to come in and set up in front of Lairon like Duosion or to chip away at opposing Pokemon that sit on it like Bronzor. Toxic is an option that does well at chipping down a common switch-in, Vibrava, to deter it from coming in and removing Lairon's entry hazards. Toxic also wears down other Ground-types like Hippopotas and Marshtomp, which can comfortably switch into Lairon's attacks. Rock Head allows Head Smash to be a spammable move and keeps Lairon healthy.</p> <p>Lairon does well on balance and offensive teams looking for an entry hazard setter that can put pressure on hazard removers like Dustox and physical walls like Ivysaur and Carbink. Cleaners like Klang, Choice Scarf Krokorok, and Huntail appreciate Lairon's ability to put a dent in the likes of Swalot and Duosion. Teammates that can come in and take advantage of opposing Vibrava like Jumpluff and Ivysaur are appreciated. Vibrava is a great pairing, since it can deal with a lot of Pokemon that threaten Lairon such as Pignite, Krokorok, and Gigalith, while Lairon can come in on Pokemon that bother Vibrava like Dustox, Wigglytuff, and Persian. Lairon needs teammates that can help deal with Bronzor, since Bronzor outright walls and beats it, so Pokemon such as Krokorok, Scraggy, and Magic Guard Duosion help alleviate this problem. Faster teammates are always appreciated to make up for Lairon's slow Speed, especially those that benefit from its wallbreaking like Sawsbuck and Jumpluff.</p>"

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Servine's Choice Scarf and offensive utility sets can opt to run Hidden Power Fire over Hidden Power Ice, though not being able to consistently threaten Flying-types and Vibrava with super effective damage can end up causing problems if not properly accounted for in teambuilding. While Servine can opt for additional utility moves like Leech Seed, Knock Off, and Glare over Hidden Power on its utility sets, this leaves it walled or threatened by significantly more Pokemon, including several other Grass-type Pokemon like Simisage and Sawsbuck. Servine can also opt for an offensive spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe on Eviolite sets, but this spread is typically only used on hyper offense teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon like Pignite and Magmar can easily switch into Servine's attacks and threaten super effective STAB damage in return, with the latter also outspeeding non-Choice Scarf Servine.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Bulky Poison-type Pokemon like Dustox, Swalot, and Ivysaur easily switch into and threaten out Servine.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Swoobat and Jumpluff can KO Servine from over half HP and can take advantage of Choice Scarf Servine being locked into Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Vanilluxe</strong>: Choice Scarf Vanilluxe can outspeed and KO offensive variants of Servine from nearly full HP, and all variants of Vanilluxe can survive an unboosted Leaf Storm with relative ease.</p> <p><strong>Sap Sipper</strong>: Sap Sipper Pokemon like Gogoat and Sawsbuck are fully immune to Leaf Storm and take relatively little damage from unboosted Hidden Power Ice / Fire, allowing them to threaten Servine out with setup and damage, respectively.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Offensive Servine is a top-tier setup sweeper through its ability to break foes with its self-boosting STAB Leaf Storm, remove opposing items with Knock Off, hinder switch-ins with Glare, and shut down walls and entry hazard setters with Taunt. Its excellent Speed also allows it to benefit from the paralysis it spreads, outpacing all paralyzed Choice Scarf users in mid-game and end-game scenarios. Hidden Power Ice allows Servine to hit opposing Grass-, Dragon-, and Flying-type Pokemon super effectively.</p> <p>Fire-type teammates like Magmar and Pignite appreciate Servine's ability to paralyze opposing threats and cleanly answer opposing Water-type Pokemon; in return, they threaten out the special walls that often slow down Servine like Dustox, Meganium, and Bronzor. Servine also appreciates having teammates like Politoed, Simipour, and Whiscash that can handle opposing Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon like Pignite and Bronzor. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Gigalith and Krokorok is also greatly appreciated by Servine to chip its checks into boosted Leaf Storm range. Servine often struggles with opposing Poison-type Pokemon like Swalot and Trubbish, so Psychic-types like Swoobat and Duosion are appreciated as teammates. Lastly, since Servine is a late-game sweeper, wallbreakers like the aforementioned Magmar and Simipour as well as Simisage are invaluable teammates to have.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Bulky Servine serves as a reliable check to several offensive Electric- and Water-type threats like Electabuzz, Pikachu, Simipour, Politoed, and Huntail and uses the turns that it gains from these threats to chip or otherwise hinder foes. Hidden Power Ice allows Servine to hit opposing Flying- and Dragon-type Pokemon, Hidden Power Fire allows it to hit opposing Steel-type Pokemon, and both give it a tool to answer opposing Grass-type Pokemon. Synthesis acts as reliable recovery, allowing Servine to continue answering the threats it's meant to check, while its final moveslot lets it choose between removing items, paralyzing foes, or chipping at foes and gaining further recovery with Leech Seed. Servine can opt to include both Glare and Knock Off while forgoing Hidden Power, allowing it to disrupt foes in many ways, but this leaves it unable to hit opposing Grass-types. The given EV spread allows Servine to outpace several foes like Scraggy and Modest Glaceon while taking special attacks as well as possible.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Gigalith and Krokorok pair excellently with Servine, which punishes Defog attempts with Contrary and appreciates hazard damage on the Fire- and Poison-type Pokemon that often threaten it out. Servine's ability to reliably switch into Electric-type threats is greatly appreciated by teammates like Simipour, Politoed, and Huntail, which can in turn take advantage of the Fire-type Pokemon that Servine is often checked by. Servine often struggles against opposing Poison-type Pokemon like Dustox and Swalot, so teammates like Duosion and Swoobat are greatly appreciated to help deal with them. Lastly, Servine loves having Fire-type teammates like Magmar and Pignite that answer the Steel-type Pokemon trying to take advantage of Servine's relative passivity, especially if it's lacking Hidden Power Fire.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Servine is one of the tier's premier revenge killers and cleaners, outpacing the entire unboosted metagame and dealing excellent damage with its boosted STAB Leaf Storm. Energy Ball acts as a solid secondary STAB move, allowing Servine to save its limited Leaf Storm PP until the endgame, while Hidden Power Ice allows Servine to KO weakened opposing Grass-types like Simisage and Sawsbuck, Flying-types like Jumpluff, and Vibrava. Servine's final move is dedicated to taking advantage of the many switches it forces in early- and mid-game scenarios, paralyzing foes with Glare or removing items with Knock Off.</p> <p>It can be difficult for Choice Scarf Servine to switch in at times, so it appreciates teammates with pivot moves like Electabuzz and Vibrava. Servine commonly struggles against opposing Fire-type Pokemon like Pignite and Magmar, meaning that Water-type teammates like Simipour and Politoed are excellent to switch into and exploit them. Servine also struggles to break past Poison-type Pokemon like Swalot and Dustox, so Psychic-types like Duosion, Meowstic-F, and Swoobat make for excellent allies to break them. Servine also loves having entry hazard-setting teammates like Gigalith and Krokorok to further chip down its checks with hazard damage, enabling its sweep more easily in endgame scenarios when common checks like Pignite and Dustox are heavily chipped down or removed.</p>"
