    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Explosion, especially when paired with Custap Berry, is one way for Gigalith to trade massive damage when it's already at low HP. It is Gigalith's strongest coverage move versus Vibrava, which can come in handy to ensure Stealth Rock stays up, given Vibrava will likely want to come in and use Defog in the favorable matchup, only to get blown up. Custap Berry sets work great as leads so Gigalith can get up Stealth Rock before getting KOed, letting a teammate come in afterwards and threaten Defoggers like Vibrava and Dustox. Investing some EVs into Special Defense can improve Gigalith's matchups against Swoobat and Vanilluxe.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Marshtomp and Hippopotas are easily the best counters to Gigalith, even versus its Choice Band variant. Other Ground-types like Vibrava and Krokorok may deter Stone Edge, but they fear stronger coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: One of Gigalith's most common weaknesses, faster Grass-types like Servine and Ivysaur easily force it out. Physically defensive Grass-types like Gourgeist-L and Meganium are faster than Gigalith, and even ignoring the threat of Giga Drain, they can fish for a Stone Edge miss and recover with Synthesis and Leech Seed. Ivysaur and Meganium are particularly annoying, since they can deal with Toxic through their typing and Aromatherapy, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Politoed and special variants of Huntail can take a hit from Gigalith and threaten great damage as well as potential burn with Scald from Politoed. Simipour and Frogadier have a harder time coming in safely but can threaten to OHKO with Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Special and Mixed Attackers</strong>: Gigalith's bulk is only remarkable on the physical side, so any special attacker with strong coverage like Electabuzz or Magmar with Focus Blast is an issue. Even worse, physical attackers like Persian and Simisage can afford coverage like Water Pulse and Leaf Storm, respectively, to bypass Gigalith's great physical bulk.</p> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor shrugs off Stone Edge, Toxic, and Earthquake. It doesn't fear much from Gigalith unless it's a specially defensive variant against the Choice Band set.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Gigalith's sheer bulk, strength, and access to Stealth Rock make it a popular pick for balance teams and the like. Its typing means that physically offensive Normal-types like Persian, Furfrou, and Raticate struggle to take it down, whereas Pokemon with stronger coverage versus Gigalith like Pignite and Swalot will struggle to trade hits successfully. Stone Edge will deal more damage than Rock Blast on average, consistently 2HKOing Servine and Politoed, whereas Rock Blast is more consistent with its accuracy and the ability to break Substitute and Focus Sash on the likes of Swoobat and Butterfree. Earthquake pairs best with Gigalith's Rock-type coverage, especially versus foes like Swalot and Lairon. Superpower nails Krokorok and Lairon, especially useful given Earthquake lacks a chance to OHKO the latter. It is also Gigalith's strongest coverage move versus Vibrava, although Toxic is another option to punish Vibrava along with other checks like Gourgeist-L. Rocky Helmet is an alternative to Leftovers that chips at offensive pivots like Persian and Furfrou. Lastly, Custap Berry offers the chance for Gigalith to get an extra hit off when it's at low health, which also works as an emergency check to most sweepers if it is still at full health for Sturdy.</p> <p>A staple on most cores, Gigalith pairs with special walls like Duosion, Dustox, and Klang. They deal with the strong special attackers that Gigalith is forced out by, whereas it can check physical attackers like Lairon and Persian. Specially offensive pivots like Electabuzz and Frogadier can position Gigalith on the field to set up Stealth Rock and fire off strong attacks. Poison-types like Ivysaur and Swalot make for good partners, as they can take on Grass-types like Servine and Simisage. In the same vein, teammates like Politoed and specially defensive Servine check offensive Water-types. A Grass-type that can comfortably switch into Earthquake, like Servine or Quilladin, is also a must. Servine specifically can dissuade Defog attempts from Vibrava, which is a Pokemon that gives Gigalith trouble.</p>"

It can OHKO slower foes like Duosion and Swalot, and even potential switch-ins tend to be shoddy at best given the raw damage of Stone Edge. However, Gigalith is still slower than physical walls like Gourgeist-L and Meganium, so even with a stronger Superpower, it fails to get past these foes by itself. Heavy Slam offers good neutral coverage, 2HKOing Vibrava as an example. Toxic is an alternative to deal with the aforementioned Grass-type walls that Gigalith still struggles against.</p> <p>Pivots like Electabuzz, Dustox, Frogadier, and Vibrava are all great teammates to position Gigalith on the field versus slower, vulnerable targets. Physical sweepers like Huntail and Klang are also great to have once Gigalith is able to break down opposing physical walls. Knock Off users like Servine, Ivysaur, and Persian are excellent to soften up Eviolite-reliant walls like Bronzor and Vibrava soften up for Gigalith; it can then OHKO these foes with Superpower. Special wallbreakers like Magmar and Swoobat are great to pivot into when Gigalith is forced out by a faster Grass-type.</p>"

Psychic gives Meowstic-M some offensive presence, doing notable damage to common switch-ins like Dustox and Vibrava that want to remove its dual screens and Poison-types that might want to set up hazards on it like Whirlipede and Trubbish.

An EV spread of 248 HP / 164 SpA / 96 Spe turns Ivysaur into more of a stallbreaker, more consistent at checking Grass-types like Servine and Gogoat at the cost of giving up some of its bulk.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Ivysaur struggles to make progress against Poison-types like Swalot and Dustox; Swalot can repeatedly whittle its Synthesis PP down with various attacks, while Dustox can freely pivot to another check or even phaze it with Whirlwind.

Encore is also very good against setup sweepers that don't care about Toxic like Scraggy and the aforementioned Duosion. Toxic is another stallbreaking option for Politoed to be more threatening versus its counters like Regenerator Duosion, although it comes at the opportunity cost of losing the safe switch against slower status users.

Teammates that can come in and take advantage of opposing Vibrava like Jumpluff and Ivysaur are appreciated. Vibrava is a great pairing, since it can deal with a lot of Pokemon that threaten Lairon such as Pignite, Krokorok, and Gigalith, while Lairon can come in on Pokemon that bother Vibrava like Dustox, Wigglytuff, and Persian. Lairon needs teammates that can help deal with Bronzor, since Bronzor outright walls and beats it, so Pokemon such as Krokorok, Scraggy, and Magic Guard Duosion help alleviate this problem.

Head Smash is Lairon's strongest STAB move and hits most Pokemon like Swalot, Carbink, and Quilladin, for great damage. Roar phazes foes that Lairon can't touch, like Bronzor, and disrupts setup attempts from Pokemon like Klang, Duosion, and Carbink. Vibrava and Gigalith both have an easy time switching into Lairon, so Toxic is the main option to wear them down. Superpower is an alternative to deal more immediate damage to Scraggy and Klang; however, it isn't as strong of an option against Vibrava, which can just shrug it off. Rock Head makes Head Smash more spammable because it stops Lairon from taking recoil damage that would cut into its bulk. Lairon uses maximum HP investment to avoid KOs that a set with no HP investment wouldn't, like the OHKO from Politoed's Scald and Eviolite Krokorok's Earthquake and the 2HKO from Bulk Up Scraggy's Drain Punch.</p> <p>Lairon does its best work on balance and offense teams looking for an entry hazard setter with a great defensive profile that can deal with a plethora of Pokemon like Persian, Dustox, and Duosion. Frailer teammates like Frogadier and Simipour appreciate Lairon's ability to eat hits from Persian and Furfrou. Lairon pairs well with offensive Quilladin on hazard-stacking teams because Lairon can phaze the opposing team to pile up chip damage, while Quilladin helps deal with a lot of Pokemon that Lairon is weak to such as Vibrava, Gigalith, and Krokorok. Other Grass-types like Simisage and Meganium really like having Lairon on their team because it comes in on Dustox and keeps Stealth Rock up against it for later chip damage. Lairon needs some support from the likes of Scraggy and Magic Guard Duosion against Bronzor, which completely walls it. Swalot is a great teammate that deals with the likes of Pignite and Scraggy while also absorbing Knock Off so Lairon doesn't lose its Eviolite.</p>"

Lairon likes being paired with teammates that can switch into common Choice Scarf users like Frogadier and Simipour, since it fails to outspeed some of them even after a Rock Polish, so Meganium, Dustox, and Servine make great partners.

Power-Up Punch is an alternative option on the tank set to potentially pick off a weakened target and then use the extra power to sweep with a stronger Sucker Punch. Flame Charge with extra Speed investment allows Pignite to potentially clean late-game, although Curse + Sucker Punch offers a more reliable vehicle to success. Wild Charge nails Water-types attempting to switch in, although all notable examples will be just as vulnerable to Superpower, which also comes with the perk of lacking recoil. Roar works as some bulky setup sweepers like Scraggy and Iron Defense Klang can become too hard for Pignite to break itself. Bulldoze is helpful for the mirror and works like Flame Charge to a lesser extent, getting the jump on faster attackers like Magmar and Electabuzz. Sometimes, the offensive potential of Blaze can be worth forfeiting Pignite's ability to easily switch into Vanilluxe with Thick Fat, especially given its good synergy with Flare Blitz recoil. RestTalk over Toxic and Sucker Punch on an offensive set is great for helping Pignite stick around while making it arguably the best long-term answer to Bronzor. Although RestTalk makes Pignite much bulkier, it leaves it vulnerable to being revenge KOed more easily. Heavy Slam is a good option to OHKO a common counter in Carbink.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Vibrava, Hippopotas, and Marshtomp are hard for Pignite to trade hits against, even if they lose their Eviolite or get poisoned by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Most Water-types do not want to switch in against Pignite's strong coverage, but the likes of Simipour and Whiscash can come in against its Fire-type attacks and force it out. Politoed's bulk and access to Protect and Encore makes it one of the hardest checks to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Swalot</strong>: Physically defensive Swalot is a pain for Pignite to get through, especially when Flare Blitz recoil is compounded with Rocky Helmet chip damage.

Many Grass-types have a hard time trading hits and preventing Pignite from coming in against them, and many other walls and sweepers such as Dustox, Bronzor, Klang, and Scraggy all struggle versus it. Sucker Punch means that even when Pignite is at low HP, it can still pose a threat to revenge killers, especially frailer examples like Swoobat and Pikachu. For bulkier targets it fails to break through, like Regenerator Duosion, Marshtomp, and Hippopotas, Pignite can still threaten them with Toxic on the switch in. Thick Fat is an asset for discouraging STAB attacks from wallbreakers like Choice Specs Magmar and Vanilluxe.

Alternatively, the likes of Simisage and Frogadier support Pignite with their revenge killing capabilities, and in return it forces heavy hits on important walls. Duosion's Future Sight support is a great way to make sure Pignite will net hefty damage, as walls like Swalot and Trubbish stop being safe switch-ins to Superpower. Pivots like Volt Switch Electabuzz and Klang can force out Water-types and bring Pignite in on susceptible special walls. Klang, Krokorok, and Lairon appreciate Pignite's ability to break down defensive walls with its powerful STAB moves, giving them an easier time to sweep in the endgame.

Ivysaur and Servine can remove items with Knock Off, spread status, and force out Water-types like Huntail and Politoed, making it easier for Pignite to sweep, and in return they rely on Pignite to tank the strong Fire- and Ice-type attacks that force them out.

Unlike other walls, Duosion circumvents passivity issues by possessing an incredibly high Special Attack stat and Future Sight. This allows it to double up as an excellent progress-maker against most of the metagame due to bulky Psychic-resistant and -immune Pokemon being hard to come by. Signal Beam nails frail Dark-type Pokemon such as Krokorok and Mightyena; the former is especially threatening if it gets in safely because it commonly utilizes Pursuit. Protect not only allows Duosion to scout Choice Krokorok sets but also synergizes greatly with Future Sight. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can punish foes like Servine and offensive Klang sets that may attempt to boost on Duosion. The EV spread allows Duosion to reliably switch into Electabuzz's Volt Switch and heal off any damage with Regenerator. Magic Guard is an alternative that allows Duosion to bypass residual damage from entry hazards and status, although this worsens its functionality as a pivot.</p> <p>Duosion pairs well with Pokemon that take advantage of its Future Sight; some of the most notable examples are Pignite, Simisage, and Scraggy, as they can all hit Dark- and Steel-types for super effective damage and appreciate Future Sight threatening Poison- and Fighting-types switching in. These Pokemon tend to also have the added benefit of covering Duosion's defensive weaknesses. Pignite and Scraggy sometimes use Roar when paired with Future Sight Duosion, as it can phaze in preferred targets. Physically bulky Pokemon like Lairon, Hippopotas, and Gourgeist-L all appreciate Duosion's ability to withstand even the strongest of special attacks from the likes of Simipour, Vanilluxe, and Magmar. Due to Duosion's middling defensive stats without Eviolite, it should be paired with Knock Off absorbers such as Swalot, Jumpluff, and Carbink.

Silk Scarf empowers Sawsbuck's Normal-type attacks without any recoil at the expense of its coverage and Grass-type attacks.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor is Sawsbuck's worst matchup, as it resists both of Sawsbuck's STAB moves, doesn't take much damage from its coverage moves, and can whittle it down with Toxic and Psywave.</p> <p><strong>Dusclops</strong>: Dusclops is immune to Sawsbuck's Normal-type STAB moves, can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, and can proceed to wear it down with Seismic Toss. Due to Dusclops's low HP, Sawsbuck doesn't gain a lot of HP from Horn Leech, and Dusclops can also heal any damage taken with Rest. Offensive Dusclops variants can also threaten Sawsbuck out with Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Physically defensive Poison-types like Swalot, Ivysaur, and Trubbish can stomach even a +2 Return from Sawsbuck and retaliate with their STAB moves. However, only Trubbish survives when Stealth Rock is taken into consideration. Offensive Poison-types like Choice Scarf Seviper and Choice Scarf Gastly can outspeed Sawsbuck variants without Choice Scarf and revenge kill it, though they cannot switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Both Gourgeist formes can easily take all of Sawsbuck's coverage, force it out through Will-O-Wisp or Foul Play, and recover any damage taken with Synthesis. Faster Grass-types like Jumpluff and Simisage can also force out non-Choice Scarf Sawsbuck with STAB Acrobatics and coverage, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types like Swoobat and Pidgeot can switch into Horn Leech and threaten Choice Scarf Sawsbuck not locked into its Normal-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Despite Sawsbuck's respectable Speed, faster attackers like Electabuzz, Frogadier, and Simipour can defeat it with minimal prior chip damage, and Choice Scarf variants of these Pokemon can even pick off Choice Scarf variants of Sawsbuck.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Sawsbuck is an excellent setup sweeper with Swords Dance, owing to its good Speed, power, and typing. Double-Edge is preferred over Return, always 2HKOing Servine and OHKOing Simisage. Return can be used instead if Sawsbuck does not wish to suffer recoil, but it misses these benchmarks. Horn Leech targets Normal-resistant and immune Pokemon like Gigalith, Carbink, and Dusclops. Jump Kick is its preferred coverage move, hitting Steel-types like Klang and Lairon harder than any of its other moves do. Sap Sipper allows Sawsbuck to pivot into Grass-type attacks freely while also enhancing its wallbreaking prowess. If used on sun teams, an Adamant nature and Chlorophyll are necessary for it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under sun while hitting as hard as possible.</p> <p>Sawsbuck does excellently on balance and offensive teams, where it can leverage its good Speed and offensive prowess to punch holes early-game as a wallbreaker or clean up late-game. It struggles the most against Bronzor and physically bulky Poison-types like Swalot and Ivysaur; checks to these threats like Magmar and Krokorok help it break through these checks more easily. Defensive backbones strong against these threats, like the aforementioned Poison-types and Duosion, can preserve Sawsbuck's health. Late-game sweepers like Simipour and Calm Mind Swoobat can help clean up the opposition and take advantage of Sawsbuck's wallbreaking. Wallbreakers like Magmar and Vanilluxe make Sawsbuck harder to stop late-game.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Sawsbuck makes for a notable cleaner and revenge killer, getting the jump on the entire unboosted metagame and able to check fast threats like Simipour, Simisage, and Persian well. Without a damage-boosting item, Double-Edge's strength is necessary over Return's lack of recoil—the extra power allows Sawsbuck to always 2HKO Pignite without needing Stealth Rock and have a good chance of OHKOing Simisage with Stealth Rock. Jump Kick is its strongest coverage against Steel-types like Lairon and Klang. Megahorn 2HKOes Grass-types like Gogoat and Servine and is its strongest coverage move against Bronzor. Toxic puts walls like Gourgeist formes and Dusclops on a timer.</p> <p>As this set emphasizes Sawsbuck's Speed to let it revenge kill, it tends to struggle more against checks like the aforementioned Bronzor and bulky Poison-types. Wallbreakers like Pignite and Choice Band Lairon can threaten the opposition, making Sawsbuck's attacks even harder to switch into. Walls like Swalot and Gigalith can provide a cushion for physical attacks to give Sawsbuck opportunities to perform later into the game. Pivots like Electabuzz and Dustox can help get Sawsbuck onto the field more safely, and special attackers like Frogadier and Magmar can threaten bulky checks that it often has trouble getting past.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Great offensive stats, backed by the coveted Protean and a wide coverage and utility movepool, make Frogadier one of the best special attackers and pivots in the tier. Life Orb allows Frogadier to hit several benchmarks, such as OHKOing Eviolite Magmar with Hydro Pump and 2HKOing bulky Servine with Ice Beam. Eviolite, on the other hand, lets Frogadier better switch into attacks in general, notably letting it avoid an OHKO from Gigalith's Stone Edge and Duosion's Future Sight, although it should only be switching into strong attacks like these in a pinch. Ice Beam nails Grass-types such as Ivysaur, Gourgeist-L, and Gogoat as well as Vibrava, with Protean removing Frogadier's weakness to the former group's STAB attacks. U-turn is an excellent tool to keep momentum against specially bulky Pokemon such as Bronzor, Duosion, and Swalot. Toxic Spikes can wear down bulky Water-types like Politoed and Seaking, which typically switch in to answer Frogadier, and also synergizes well with its coverage and U-turn forcing switches. Hidden Power Grass with Life Orb can 2HKO Politoed and Seaking one layer of Spikes, while Taunt helps to prevent the specially bulky Pokemon from using their recovery moves.</p> <p>Given Frogadier's frailty, slow U-turn users like Vibrava and Dustox are good partners and have the added benefit of clearing the entry hazards that can limit the opportunities in which Frogadier can pivot. Offensive pivots such as Electabuzz, Persian, and Furfrou can also form great cores with Frogadier, with the last two also luring in Rock-types like Gigalith, Carbink, and Lairon, which Frogadier can take advantage of. Faster Grass-type attackers such as Simisage, Jumpluff, and Choice Scarf Sawsbuck can revenge kill Frogadier, so it is imperative to have some Fire-, Poison-, or Flying-types on your team when using Frogadier; some good examples include Pignite, Magmar, Swalot, Ivysaur, and Pidgeot. Similarly, Electabuzz poses a big problem to Frogadier, so Electric-immune and resistant Pokemon like Hippopotas, Krokorok, Servine, and Quilladin are appreciated. The aforementioned Krokorok, as well as Whiscash and Swoobat, appreciate Toxic Spikes support, as their answers are vulnerable to poison. Fast Normal-types like Persian, Furfrou, and Choice Scarf Pidgeot can revenge kill Frogadier, so reliable switch-ins to them like Gigalith, Lairon, and Bronzor are incredibly valuable.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Frogadier outpaces the entire unboosted metagame, making its Hydro Pump a great tool for revenge killing opposing Choice Scarf users, such as Krokorok and Magmar, as well as boosted setup sweepers like Rock Polish Lairon and Shell Smash Magcargo. Ice Beam can revenge kill Simisage, Jumpluff, and Choice Scarf Sawsbuck. U-turn chips away at expected switch-ins like Politoed and bulky special walls like Duosion and Bronzor, while Toxic Spikes provides additional chip damage on Servine, Gogoat, non-Magic Guard Duosion, and other specially defensive walls to allow Frogadier to clean late-game. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass is useful for stopping Whiscash and Huntail in their tracks.</p> <p>Setup sweepers and wallbreakers like Sawsbuck, Simisage, Klang, and Pignite make for good partners, since Frogadier can keep Fire-types like Magmar and Lampent and Ground-types like Krokorok at bay. Frogadier also pairs well with other pivots, since it can struggle to switch in safely; examples of good slow pivots include Dustox and Vibrava. Dustox and Vibrava also offer entry hazard removal, which is vital, as Frogadier lacks recovery and pivots often. Pokemon that can remove items such as Persian, Krokorok, and Servine and entry hazard setters like Bronzor, Gigalith, and Whirlipede help aid Frogadier's cleaning efforts. Additionally, special wallbreakers like Magmar, Vanilluxe, and Simisage can help weaken the likes of Swalot, Bronzor, and Duosion so that Frogadier has an easier time cleaning through them.</p>"
