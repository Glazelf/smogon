  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Venusaur is a phenomenal sun sweeper in UU. Venusaur's defensive typing lets it set up on many common Pokemon like Tangrowth, Swampert, Tapu Bulu, and Rotom-W, allowing it to clean teams with its Growth boots. With moves like Giga Drain for reliable recovery, a powerful 100-Base Power and sun-boosted Weather Ball, and Sludge Bomb or Earth Power, Venusaur is able to punch holes in many teams, as with a boost it 2HKOes nearly every Pokemon in the tier barring Chansey. With a Modest nature, it outspeeds every relevant Pokemon in the tier under sun. However, Venusaur is severely limited if sun is no longer active, being outsped and KOed by plenty of Pokemon like Salamence and Azelf or used as setup bait for Pokemon like Thundurus-T. Without a boost, Venusaur can sometimes be too weak to sweep, as common Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres are able to survive an unboosted hit and OHKO it back. Lastly, priority users such as Zygarde-10%, Scizor, and Mamoswine can pick off a weakened Venusaur. The inconsistency of sun teams because of Hippowdon limits the prominence of Venusaur in the metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Knock Off can be used to remove Chansey's Eviolite while also nailing Nihilego and Chandelure, but generally Venusaur benefits much more from its other moves; it can OHKO Nihilego and Chandelure with Earth Power, and after enough boosts from Growth it can damage Chansey with Giga Drain and outheal the damage done by Seismic Toss. Venusaur can run a defensive set with Leech Seed to blank Amoonguss and check Primarina, but generally Amoonguss is the better option thanks to Spore and Regenerator.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: If Venusaur chooses to not run Earth Power, Chandelure can stomach any of Venusaur's hits at +2 and take it out with a Fire-type attack. Rotom-H and Moltres are can take an unboosted Sludge Bomb from Venusaur and KO it back with their Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Special walls such as Chansey, Umbreon, and Mandibuzz can take any of Venusaur's hits and stall out sun turns with their recovery moves, with the former wearing it down with Seismic Toss and the latter two being able to hit Venusaur hard with Foul Play due to Growth's attack boosts. Nihilego can take on an unboosted Venusaur but loses if it boosts on the switch-in. Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro can take a +2 hit and KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Zygarde-10%, Lycanroc-D, Scizor, and Mamoswine can revenge kill Venusaur using their priority moves if Venusaur is worn down, which can happen due to Venusaur sometimes having to take a hit to set up Growth while also dealing with Life Orb recoil.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Growth is a powerful setup move under sun, boosting Venusaur's Special Attack by 2 stages and allowing it to 2HKO nearly all the Pokemon in the tier. It can set up on popular Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Swampert, and Amoonguss due to its typing, and then sweep through opposing teams. Giga Drain hits Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Primarina, Hippowdon, and Lycanroc-D super effectively. Weather Ball is Venusaur's main attacking move under sun, as its Base Power becomes 100 and is boosted by the sun, KOing Steel-types that resist Giga Drain like Celesteela, Scizor, Skarmory, and Jirachi. Sludge Bomb hits Pokemon that resist Giga Drain and Weather Ball like Salamence, Hydreigon, and Rotom-H while also hitting Fairy-types like Hatterene super effectively, though it will need a boost to OHKO the former two. Earth Power is an alternative option to hit Tentacruel, Chandelure, and Nihilego harder, but this leaves Venusaur susceptible to Salamence, as Giga Drain and Weather Ball are mandatory moves. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed ensures Venusaur is as strong and fast as possible. A Modest nature is used to maximize damage output while still nearly outspeeding everything under the sun. Life Orb is used to boost Venusaur's damage output, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Salamence, and Moltres after a boost, while a boost to Giga Drain gives Venusaur insane damage output and reliable recovery, making it a powerful force.</p> <p>Venusaur only fits on sun teams, so Torkoal is a mandatory partner, as it is the most reliable sun setter in the tier. It provides the team with entry hazard support and entry hazard control with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, respectively. Other Pokemon that take advantage of sun like Chandelure, Darmanitan, and Hatterene break holes in enemy teams thanks to their powerful wallbreaking capabilities amplified by sun, allowing Venusaur to sweep much more easily. Hatterene in particular checks Hydreigon and discourages entry hazards from being set so Torkoal can come in more, allowing Venusaur to sweep more easily. Venusaur also appreciates momentum such as Teleport from Chansey and Swampert to help it get in safely as well as give it more opportunities to set up; for example Chansey can bring Venusaur in on physical attackers like Scizor and Azumarill, which are forced out by it under sun.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen is an exceptional wallbreaker and capable entry hazard setter because Life Orb and Sheer Force let it 2HKO the entire UU metagame bar Chansey and bulky Galarian Moltres. Its solid defensive typing also lets it check Pokemon such as Nihilego and discourage common Electric-types such as Rotom-H from using Volt Switch. However, Nidoqueen can struggle to pivot into Electric-types like Raikou and Thundurus-T that commonly carry super-effective coverage to break through it. Unfortunately, Nidoqueen's overreliance on its Life Orb leaves it susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would pivot into like Nihilego. A low Speed stat gives Nidoqueen an undesirable matchup versus faster-paced teams, and although Nidoqueen sports a quality defensive typing, it is still weak to common Pokemon in the tier such as Mamoswine and Keldeo. These struggles sting a bit more because Nidoqueen has no form of reliable recovery, meaning it is worn down pretty quickly throughout a match. Lastly, Nidoqueen faces severe competition from its counterpart Nidoking, who sports better offenses and a higher speed tier, making it preferred on most teams. Still, Nidoqueen's better bulk and role compression as an entry hazard setter gives it a role on certain teams.</p> ",

Taunt does a decent job of giving utility Pokemon like Chansey a hard time. Substitute can be a viable option to ease prediction on a forced switch. Protect also helps prediction by letting Nidoqueen scout Choice-locked Pokemon it is weak to such as Krookodile and Jirachi.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is the single best answer to Nidoqueen, as it can consistently switch into its attacks without worry, recover any damage away, and chip Nidoqueen with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Azelf, Necrozma, and Starmie all can outspeed and KO Nidoqueen, with Necrozma being able to live a hit and use it as set up fodder thanks to its high natural bulk.

Earth Power and Sludge Wave are mandatory, powerful STAB moves that OHKO bulkier Pokemon such as Aegislash, Hatterene, and Tangrowth. Fire Blast is an excellent coverage move and the best pick for the last slot, as it almost OHKOes Amoonguss and cleanly 2HKOes Celesteela. Modest is the preferred nature because it grants Nidoqueen exceptional power and still lets it outspeed most of its primary targets, although a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Buzzwole, Timid Volcanion, and Timid Toxtricity.

Starmie is a decent teammate for Nidoqueen because it checks many Pokemon that threaten Nidoqueen, such as Keldeo. Rotom-H and Rotom-W are both Volt Switch users that can bring Nidoqueen in safely and also check Mamoswine, and the latter has the added benefit of checking Krookodile. Nidoqueen pairs well with almost any Kommo-o set, as Nidoqueen can break through Primarina and Hatterene to help it succeed.

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its excellent offensive typing, ability in Sheer Force, powerful STAB moves like Sludge Wave and Earth Power, and excellent coverage moves like Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt, Nidoking is a very powerful wallbreaker. It can hit a large portion of the tier for super effective damage, pressuring plenty of Pokemon like Skarmory, Primarina, and Amoonguss. Even though Nidoking is one of the most dangerous threats in the tier, its mediocre Speed tier and bulk mean it can't find many opportunities to wallbreak, mandating pivot support to get it onto the field safely. Nidoking also relies on its Life Orb to do massive damage, so it despises Knock Off from the likes of Nihilego and Thundurus-T. Its typing also doesn't benefit it much defensively, leaving it weak to common attacking types like Ground, Water, and Psychic from Pokemon like Excadrill, Azumarill, and Azelf. Furthermore, despite being a Ground-type, Nidoking doesn't provide a functional Electric immunity for its team, being outsped by Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Thundurus-T and getting hit hard by their other moves. This lack of defensive utility makes it hard to justify over other Pokemon that share its Ground or Poison typing like Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Nihilego. Nidoqueen, while weaker, has more bulk than Nidoking, allowing it to fit Stealth Rock for role compression, and its lower Speed isn't a hinderance in UU.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock can be run for role compression thanks to Nidoking preventing common entry hazard removers like Excadrill and Tentacruel from switching into it. Superpower can be used to hit Chansey for solid damage on the switch, but it doesn't hit anything else, and doing enough damage requires either a nature change or heavy investment, which normally isn't worth it. While Nidoking's higher Attack might make a physical set worthwhile, it lacks the proper movepool, and most of its Sheer Force-boosted moves are special. Sucker Punch is an option to pick off the likes of Jirachi and Azelf as well as other revenge killers like Lycanroc-D, but forgoing coverage or added utility isn't great for Nidoking. Protect can used over Substitute to scout moves from Choice-locked foes and checks like Hydreigon and Keldeo. While you forgo the additional power from Life Orb, a Choice Scarf set is a solid revenge killer while still being an effective wallbreaker.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Thanks to Chansey's tremendously high special bulk, it is able to switch into any of Nidoking's attacks and can proceed to whittle it down with Seismic Toss, set up Stealth Rock, or recover its HP with Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Keldeo and Rotom-W outspeed and threaten Nidoking.

Earth Power slams Steel- and Poison-types such as Jirachi, Cobalion, and Nihilego. Fire Blast roasts Celesteela, Skarmory, and Scizor. It also OHKOes Amoonguss after Stealth Rock. Thunderbolt allows Nidoking to nail Water- and Flying-types like Slowking, Gyarados, and Mandibuzz. Alternatively, Substitute makes Nidoking much less prediction reliant, giving it free turns against foes that it forces out like Nihilego and Tangrowth. Ice Beam heavily pressures Hippowdon and OHKOes Salamence and Noivern, but these Pokemon get pressured by Nidoking's STAB attacks anyway. A Modest nature should be run to increase Nidoking's damage output against threats like Slowking and Mandibuzz, since it doesn't miss out on any notable Speed benchmarks. Life Orb and Sheer Force pair together to negate the health loss of Life Orb while giving an effective 70% power boost, which is a big factor behind Nidoking's power.</p> <p>Nidoking fits best on offensive teams that are able to bring it in many times to wallbreak and tear through defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss and Skarmory. As a result, pivots such as Rotom-W, Zarude, and Moltres make for good partners. Zarude forces out Swampert and Hippowdon while Rotom-W lures in Tangrowth for Nidoking and OHKOes Krookodile. Chansey is also a great partner for Nidoking, providing pivot support while beating its common checks like Rotom-W and Hydreigon.

Tangrowth and Amoonguss are also able to handle Electric-types in the tier much better than Nidoking and can pivot into the likes of Zygarde-10% and Keldeo excellently. Late-game cleaners like Scizor and Cobalion are great to break through Chansey, which Nidoking struggles against.

Due to Galarian Slowbro's low Speed, pivots that can get it in safely against setup fodder are ideal teammates. Jirachi and Zarude can use U-turn in front of Pokemon like Celesteela and Buzzwole. Raikou and Rotom-W can use Volt Switch on Grass-types and offensively check Chandelure. Galarian Slowbro appreciates Mienshao and Buzzwole checking Dark-types such as Krookodile and Crawdaunt. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Salamence and Rotom-W is needed. Strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Krookodile and Buzzwole can remove Calm Mind sweepers that beat Galarian Slowbro one-on-one like Suicune.</p> "

Psyshock is useful for dealing with Keldeo and Chansey. Fire Blast is essential for hitting Steel-types like Celesteela and Aegislash. Ice Beam hits common Pokemon such as Salamence, Krookodile, and Thundurus-T, but Grass Knot is an alternative to have a better matchup against bulkier teams, as it can OHKO Quagsire and Rhyperior.

Galarian Slowbro is also useful on Sticky Web teams, where it can be slightly less reliant on Quick Claw + Quick Draw to outspeed Amoonguss and Aegislash and provide some defensive utility with its resistances and ability to absorb Toxic Spikes. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Krookodile can facilitate an easier sweep. Galarian Slowbro is vulnerable to Pokemon like Krookodile and Kommo-o, so other setup sweepers such as Galarian Moltres and Salamence are good partners. Rotom-W and Zarude can draw in passive Pokemon such as Chansey and Tangrowth for Galarian Slowbro. In return, Galarian Slowbro can lure Kommo-o and Tangrowth.</p> "

In addition, Chansey can withstand certain physical attacks from threats like Gyarados and Zygarde-10% and cripple them with Toxic. Chansey is also hard to wear down, since it has Soft-Boiled for HP recovery and Natural Cure to remove status ailments, allowing it to be a status sponge into the likes of Amoonguss, Slowking, and Swampert. It also has many utility moves such as Teleport, Thunder Wave, Aromatherapy, and Stealth Rock to support its team. However, Chansey is rather passive, as it relies on Seismic Toss and Toxic to deal damage. As a result, many Pokemon such as Scizor, Excadrill, Skarmory, and Cobalion easily take advantage of Chansey. Without Teleport, Chansey is a huge momentum drain for non-stall teams. Chansey's typing provides few useful resistances, and Chansey by itself must rely on its bulk to keep threats in check. Chansey is vulnerable to every entry hazard, meaning it gets overwhelmed by them quickly. Chansey is also susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would normally check like Azelf and Thundurus-T, as without Eviolite, it is harder for Chansey to keep threats like Zygarde-10% and Choice Specs Hydreigon in check.</p> ",

U-turn lets Moltres keep momentum on Pokemon like Rotom-W and Rhyperior. Defog can be used if Moltres's team can't afford other forms of entry hazard removal. Roost gives Moltres longevity to keep threats like Jirachi and Zarude in check throughout the game, and it keeps Moltres healthy if its Heavy-Duty Boots is removed and Stealth Rock is up. Flame Body is chosen to scare away Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Jirachi, and Mienshao from using contact moves due to a potential burn. 88 HP EVs let Moltres avoid the 2HKO from Zarude's Darkest Lariat.</p> <p>Bulky offense and balance teams appreciate Moltres pressuring Pokemon like Amoonguss, Kommo-o, and Buzzwole. Knock Off absorbers like Buzzwole and Amoonguss make excellent teammates. They're also secondary checks to Mienshao and Zarude so Moltres isn't overwhelmed by them and doesn't have to constantly risk taking the former's Knock Off. Moltres can remove Steel-types such as Aegislash and Cobalion for them in return. Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth check Electric- and Water-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Primarina for Moltres. Jungle Healing Zarude also checks Raikou and Rotom-W, and Choice Scarf variants can revenge kill them and others like Keldeo. Water-types like Keldeo appreciate Moltres dealing with Grass-types like Amoonguss for them, and in return they can pressure Rock-types like Rhyperior for it. Pokemon such as Jirachi and Zarude can form a pivoting core with U-turn Moltres, bringing Moltres in against foes like Tangrowth. If Moltres foregoes Defog, entry hazard removers like Rotom-W and Starmie can help it by keeping Stealth Rock off of the field, and they like Moltres threatening Tangrowth for them. Frail wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Primarina and Thundurus-T like Moltres's U-turn bringing them in safely against foes like Rhyperior and Salamence.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Azumarill is an offensive powerhouse and effective wallbreaker when equipped with a Choice Band due to Huge Power, being able to nearly 2HKO the entire tier with the right move. It can also utilize a Belly Drum set to be a scary late-game cleaner. Water / Fairy is a great offensive typing, allowing Azumarill to beat key threats like Excadrill and Hydreigon. Access to great coverage moves such as Knock Off and Ice Punch lets Azumarill break past Pokemon like Tentacruel and Amoonguss that would otherwise check it by resisting its STAB combination, while Aqua Jet allows it to also be a great revenge killer against top threats like Zygarde-10% and Azelf that have taken chip damage. Azumarill also has decent natural bulk and a great defensive typing, which allows it to blanket check threats such as Hydreigon and Salamence. Unfortunately, Azumarill is quite slow, so it is easily forced out by faster Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Thundurus-T when it is not boosted with Belly Drum. Additionally, Rotom-W and faster Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Zarude can revenge kill Belly Drum Azumarill, as they can stomach a +6 Aqua Jet. This gives Azumarill limited opportunities to fire off an attack due to its only decent bulk. Belly Drum Azumarill is restricted to only getting one setup opportunity, which usually forces it to be preserved until late-game. Azumarill faces large competition from Primarina as it offers more defensive utility with its bulk.</p> ",

Azumarill can run a trapping set with Sap Sipper and Whirlpool, Perish Song, and Protect. This can trap passive foes like Celesteela as well as Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth, but the effectiveness of this set is purely restricted to punishing walls and is deadweight against a majority of the offensive threats in UU. Protective Pads lets Azumarill not worry about being chipped by Rocky Helmet from Skarmory and Amoonguss, but its wallbreaking prowess is significantly hindered.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Faster Grass-types like Zarude and Tapu Bulu are the biggest threats to Azumarill because even a Belly Drum Azumarill cannot OHKO them with Aqua Jet and they OHKO back. Defensive Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth can usually switch into Choice Band Azumarill and threaten it with their own STAB moves as well as scout and switch out with Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: An unboosted Azumarill is easy prey for Thundurus-T and Raikou. Without being at +6, Azumarill cannot come close to KOing them with Aqua Jet, and both will in turn OHKO Azumarill. Rotom-W resists Aqua Jet and can also outspeed and cripple Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp or pressure it with an Electric-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Faster Water-resistant Pokemon: Anything faster that resists Aqua Jet is bound to pressure Azumarill. These Pokemon include Gyarados, Tentacruel, and Rotom-W. Salamence can also pressure Azumarill, but it is also pressured by Azumarill with Play Rough, so Azumarill would have to be significantly chipped for Salamence to KO it.</p> ",

Aqua Jet becomes a very powerful STAB priority move when bolstered by Huge Power and a Choice Band, allowing it to OHKO Nihilego and revenge kill Thundurus-T and Rotom-H after they have taken sufficient chip damage. Ice Punch allows Azumarill to break through Amoonguss by 2HKOing it on the switch. It also hits Tangrowth hard. Knock Off can be used to burden anything that switches in, such as Tangrowth and Tentacruel, by removing their item. A Choice Band allows Azumarill to maximize the wallbreaking potential its STAB attacks have to offer. Adamant is the preferred nature to make it as strong as possible, notably 2HKOing Skarmory with Liquidation after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Choice Band Azumarill fits best on bulky offense teams as a powerful early-game wallbreaker. Pivots like Thundurus-T and Scizor can bring Azumarill in against their checks like Nihilego and Moltres to fire off an attack. Nidoking, Moltres, and Salamence can remove bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Tapu Bulu for Azumarill to fire off its STAB attacks easier. Keeping entry hazards up is important to ease Azumarill's ability to break through Tangrowth and Skarmory, so partners such as Excadrill and Nihilego are essential. The former provides entry hazard removal to keep Azumarill from getting worn down while the latter offensively checks Thundurus-T. Tapu Bulu and Zarude threaten to revenge kill Azumarill, as they are faster and resist Aqua Jet, so partners like Salamence and Amoonguss that can comfortably switch into them are ideal.

A boosted Knock Off will OHKO Amoonguss and defensive Celesteela. Sitrus Berry allows Azumarill to set up more reliably and puts it at a comfortable amount of HP after a Belly Drum. 4 HP is needed to activate Sitrus Berry after Belly Drum. Adamant is the preferred nature to guarantee an OHKO on Amoonguss with Knock Off.</p> <p>Belly Drum Azumarill fits best on hyper offense teams due to its nature as a late-game cleaner and need for dedicated support. Krookodile and Excadrill provide entry hazard support to put threats like Tentacruel and Skarmory in range of Azumarill's attacks while also providing an Electric immunity. Similarly, Ribombee can provide Sticky Web support to offset Azumarill's vulnerable Speed tier, allowing it to now outpace Tentacruel and Tapu Bulu. Once Azumarill is boosted with Belly Drum, it typically will not get another chance to do so, so removing faster Water-type resists is key. Good offensive teammates include Salamence and Gyarados to help take out foes like Zarude and Keldeo. Thundurus-T pressures Skarmory, Scizor, and Mandibuzz for Azumarill and provides a valuable Electric immunity.

However, Quagsire's 4x weakness to Grass makes it unable to check Pokemon such as Nihilego and Gyarados, as they commonly carry Grass-type coverage. Quagsire's bulk only goes so far, as very strong wallbreakers such as Crawdaunt and Azumarill can break through it with minimal effort.

It provides fantastic team utility as a Wish passer, getting plenty of opportunities to heal up its teammates versus Pokemon like Aegislash and Salamence. While unable to pressure some defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Celesteela, and Teleport Chansey at all, Umbreon can freely use them to pass Wish, and Foul Play + Toxic greatly punishes many offensive checks switching in and prevents Umbreon from being too passive.

Umbreon also struggles versus some of the stronger special attackers in the tier like Thundurus-T and Meteor Beam Nihilego, and chip damage can bring it into 2HKO range of Pokemon it checks like Mamoswine and Nidoking.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Heal Bell is an option that lets Umbreon clear status from itself and its teammates, making its matchup versus Pokemon like specially defensive Aegislash better. Dropping Toxic for it, however, makes Umbreon noticeably more passive and invites offensive Pokemon in, giving it far fewer opportunities to safely pass Wish. Therefore, it should only be used on teams with absolutely no better options against status. Moonlight may seem appealing at first glance to give Umbreon one-turn recovery, but its low PP causes issues long term. Also, the lack of Protect lowers Umbreon's flexibility; it can't use Wish and have the option to reliably self-heal instead of passing it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types like Cobalion, Heracross, and Conkeldurr are some of the biggest threats to Umbreon. Conkeldurr can be deterred by Umbreon stalling for burn damage, but Drain Punch variants can easily regain their HP versus Umbreon's teammates, forming a long-term threat. Cobalion's Toxic immunity and ability in Justified let it safely switch into Umbreon, although variants lacking Swords Dance cannot break through Umbreon without a Justified boost.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Defensive Primarina variants can easily wall Umbreon and sponge Toxic while pressuring its teammates. For non-defensive sets, Umbreon can outspeed and poison Substitute + Calm Mind variants or scout Choice Specs variants, but the former sets up for free if not immediately poisoned, and the latter poses a serious threat to Umbreon's teammates. Hatterene can easily set up on Umbreon, bouncing back Toxic. While Togekiss cannot beat Umbreon without Heal Bell due to Inner Focus, Heal Bell + Nasty Plot variants can set up provided they have enough Heal Bell PP remaining.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Crawdaunt is a huge threat to Umbreon thanks to its cosmic damage output and resistance to Foul Play. Zarude's resistance to Foul Play and ability to sponge Toxic with Jungle Healing make it a great pivot into Umbreon; however, it cannot easily beat Umbreon itself unless Umbreon has wasted a lot of PP, and Zarude must be careful to not waste too much Jungle Healing PP if it needs check a teammate like Substitute + Toxic Aegislash. Galarian Moltres completely walls Umbreon and can potentially set up on it; RestTalk sets in particular can do this with complete impunity.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Nidoking can easily get the edge versus Umbreon if it has been chipped by entry hazards, lost its Leftovers to Knock Off from a Pokemon like Nihilego or Mamoswine itself, or statused. While Umbreon still avoids being 2HKOed by Life Orb Mamoswine without its Leftovers, Stealth Rock makes the 2HKO decently likely. Modest Nidoking can 2HKO Bold Umbreon with Stealth Rock up, forcing it to waste passive turns on Protect, which can be easily predicted.

Wish alongside Protect keeps Umbreon and its teammates healthy. Protect is also useful to scout Choice-locked Pokemon, like Primarina and Azumarill, and absorb attacks from Pokemon like Heracross and Conkeldurr paired with Future Sight from Slowking. Inner Focus lets Umbreon avoid flinches from Pokemon it checks, like Mamoswine, Gyarados, and Jirachi, and check non-Heal Bell variants of Togekiss. Maximum Defense investment with a Bold nature lets Umbreon avoid the 2HKO from Mamoswine's Earthquake after Stealth Rock while improving its matchup versus Pokemon like mixed Aegislash and Excadrill. A Calm nature is an option to prevent Modest Nidoking and Life Orb Draco Meteor Hydreigon from 2HKOing Umbreon after Stealth Rock.

Slowking can check Kommo-o and Primarina for Umbreon, while Umbreon checks Aegislash and Hydreigon for it.

    "overview": "<p>Skarmory is one of the key defensive pillars of UU thanks to its sky-high Defense, reliable recovery, and amazing defensive typing, checking dangerous offensive threats like Excadrill, Zarude, Scizor, and Gyarados with ease. Skarmory has a bevy of utility moves. Spikes wears down defensive threats like Hippowdon and Chansey for its team, and Skarmory can set Spikes easily thanks to its defensive utility and good matchup versus Excadrill. Furthermore, Whirlwind prevents Pokemon like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Swords Dance Scizor from setting up, while Iron Defense alongside Body Press allows Skarmory to improve its matchup versus threats like Azumarill, Swords Dance Scizor, and Conkeldurr. Skarmory can even run Defog on stall teams thanks to its great matchup against entry hazard setters like Excadrill and Hippowdon. These traits, in addition to its synergy with top defensive picks like Amoonguss, Slowking, and Chansey, allow Skarmory to fit on a wide range of archetypes ranging from bulky offense to stall. However, Skarmory has an extremely vulnerable Special Defense stat, making it a Steel-type that can't check specially offensive Fairy- and Psychic-types like Hatterene, so it faces competition from other Steel-types like Celesteela. Common threats like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Moltres also limit Skarmory's consistency due to its passivity. Skarmory also often struggles to fit all the moves it likes at once. For example, it becomes much more vulnerable to Conkeldurr and Azumarill without Brave Bird, but it struggles to pressure Mamoswine without Body Press, while Iron Defense sets become extremely passive and unable to punish Defog users such as Moltres and Salamence.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Skarmory can compress both Spikes and Defog on more defensive teams, acting as an emergency Defog option and opening up moveslots for other teammates. Skarmory can replace its attacking moveslot to fit both, or even other combinations of utility moves. It is still able to beat Excadrill as long as it keeps Rocky Helmet. However, these sets are very team specific. Skarmory can attempt to compress entry hazards by running both Spikes and Stealth Rock, but it struggles to fit Stealth Rock over more valuable options like Whirlwind or Toxic and pairs well with Stealth Rock setters like Nihilego anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Common Electric-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H all are unbothered by Skarmory and can use it to gain momentum with Volt Switch. Thundurus-T can also boost with Nasty Plot as it forces Skarmory out.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon and Coverage: Fire-types like Chandelure and Moltres come in easily on Skarmory and force it out. Skarmory must also be wary of Pokemon like Celesteela, Salamence, and Azelf due to them commonly running Fire-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Powerful special attackers like Keldeo, Primarina, and Hydreigon can all break through Skarmory due to its poor special bulk. Hatterene in particular completely walls Skarmory, denying its entry hazards and ignoring Whirlwind and Toxic with Magic Bounce.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Body Press utilizes Skarmory's amazing Defense to hit many opposing Pokemon hard, devastating the likes of Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Zarude. It also keeps Hydreigon from coming in freely. Alternatively, Brave Bird lets Skarmory hit Conkeldurr, Keldeo, and Amoonguss super effectively and deal solid damage to Azumarill and Gyarados. Spikes wears down common defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Amoonguss, and Hippowdon. Skarmory has plenty of opportunities to set Spikes up against Pokemon that typically cannot threaten it, like Jirachi and Tangrowth. Whirlwind synergizes well with Spikes, forcing chip damage on switch-ins like Primarina. It also prevents setup sweepers like Gyarados and Belly Drum Azumarill from setting up. Alternatively, Toxic cripples threats like Moltres and Thundurus-T that typically have free entry on it, and hinders Defoggers like Salamence and Mandibuzz from removing Spikes in the long run. Skarmory can run Defog on stall teams thanks to its ability to handle entry hazard setters like Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Swampert. Rocky Helmet allows Skarmory to punish pivoting attempts from Swampert, Jirachi, and Zarude, prevent Excadrill from freely using Rapid Spin, and wear down threats like Azumarill, Diggersby, and Gyarados quickly. The given Speed EVs allow Skarmory to outspeed Azumarill and Conkeldurr.</p> <p>Skarmory best fits on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams that appreciate its Spikes support and walling capabilities. Chansey makes an excellent partner for Skarmory, taking on dangerous special attackers like Hydreigon, Moltres, and Thundurus-T, while Skarmory handles physical attackers like Excadrill and Diggersby. Slowking similarly checks Moltres and special Salamence, and it also acts as a secondary check to Conkeldurr and Mamoswine with Colbur Berry. Additionally, its Future Sight alongside Skarmory's Whirlwind can hinder offensive Pokemon like Thundurus-T. Stealth Rock setters like Hippowdon, Nihilego, and Excadrill form great entry-hazard stacking cores with Skarmory. Diancie beats Hippowdon, Moltres, and non-Grass Knot Thundurus-T; Nihilego also beats the aforementioned threats and can hinder Scizor with Knock Off to make it vulnerable to Spikes; and Excadrill can pressure Hatterene and remove opposing entry hazards without compromising Skarmory's own Spikes. Bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth make good secondary checks to Tapu Bulu and Conkeldurr so Skarmory doesn't get overwhelmed checking them. They also can absorb Knock Off for the team, allowing Skarmory to preserve Rocky Helmet and chip down Jirachi. Zarude and the aformentioned Grass-types can help take on strong Electric- and Water-types like Rotom-W and Primarina as well. Powerful wallbreakers like Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Zygarde-10% all appreciate Skarmory's Spikes wearing down checks like Tangrowth and Chansey. On stall teams, Quagsire can provide an Electric immunity to block Volt Switch and check Thundurus-T. It also can handle setup sweepers that can bypass Skarmory like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Scizor. Umbreon acts as a primary check to Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados, secondary check to Mamoswine, and way to beat Chandelure. Galarian Weezing counters Conkeldurr and can provide Defog support to prevent Skarmory from being worn down into range of Mamoswine's Icicle Crash.</p> "

        "name": "Iron Defense",
        "description": "<p>Iron Defense allows Skarmory to better check Pokemon such as Azumarill, Mamoswine, and Scizor by boosting its Defense, and it increasing Body Press's damage makes Skarmory more threatening in front of foes such as Hippowdon and Mandibuzz. Roost maintains Skarmory's health and keeps it steadfast against strong attackers like Conkeldurr and Zygarde-10%. Spikes allows Skarmory to support its team, easily setting them up against common Pokemon such as Amoonguss, and the additional chip damage is helpful against Pokemon like Keldeo. Alternatively, since Skarmory has great matchups against entry hazard setters like Excadrill and Hippowdon, Defog is useful to consistently remove their hazards while forcing them out. Rocky Helmet is helpful to punish Excadrill's Rapid Spin and other physical attackers like Zarude and Diggersby. Safety Goggles is an alternative option to allow Skarmory to fully counter Amoonguss, setting up Iron Defense or Spikes without needing to use a teammate as sleep fodder. However, this forces Skarmory to avoid taking Knock Off from foes like Mamoswine and Scizor in order to ignore Spore. 96 Speed EVs allow Skarmory to outspeed Azumarill.</p> <p>Iron Defense Skarmory fits on balance and stall teams for handling physical threats such as Scizor while either setting Spikes to wear down foes for its teammates or reliably negating common entry hazard setters like Hippowdon and Swampert. Spikes Skarmory complements other hazard setters like Nihilego and Hippowdon excellently. Both teammates check dangerous threats like Thundurus-T and Moltres, and they also help maintain hazards against hazard removers Skarmory cannot handle, like Salamence. Teammates such as Slowking and Chansey form excellent defensive cores with Skarmory thanks to their ability to check dangerous special attackers like Keldeo and Hydreigon. Slowking can act as a wincon on stall teams with Calm Mind, while Chansey can act as a cleric. Tangrowth provides additional support for Skarmory to ensure Zygarde-10% or Rotom-W does not overwhelm it. Tangrowth also absorbs Knock Off so Skarmory does not have to risk its own Rocky Helmet or Safety Goggles. Articuno can be paired with Skarmory on hazard stacking semi-stall teams to bleed the PP of hazard removers such as Salamence and Mandibuzz. Alternatively, Articuno can pair up with Defog Skarmory in a double Defog core, keeping entry hazards off almost indefinitely. Quagsire can check Rotom-H while providing backup against Dragon Dance Salamence. In return, Skarmory helps Quagsire against the Grass-types in the tier and threats like Gyarados. Hatterene enjoys Spikes pressure chipping Pokemon like Excadrill and Skarmory being a reliable check to Scizor. Hatterene's Magic Bounce also helps Skarmory avoid being worn down by opposing entry hazards. Other offensive teammates include Calm Mind Slowking and Galarian Slowbro, which enjoy Spikes support wearing down threats like Amoonguss and Hippowdon while checking foes like Zarude and Diggersby.</p> "

Entei is able to outspeed many key threats in the metagame, like Nidoking, Gyarados, and Buzzwole. Good bulk alongside a pure Fire typing grants Entei a decent amount of defensive utility and makes it a short-term check to Pokemon such as Jirachi and Zarude. Entei's biggest drawbacks are its Stealth Rock weakness and lack of longevity, which is exacerbated by Flare Blitz recoil. Entei also struggles with various bulky Water-types in the tier, namely RestTalk Primarina and Rotom-W.

With Pressure, Calm Mind, and its superb bulk, Suicune is able to stall out threatening walls such as Aegislash and Chansey. However, Suicune is held back by the prevalence of Water-resistant Pokemon in the tier such as Keldeo, Mantine, and especially Zarude; Keldeo can simply ignore Suicune's Special Defense boosts with Secret Sword, Suicune struggles to make headway against Mantine, and Zarude especially can use Jungle Healing to cure itself of burns and Power Whip to deal significant damage. In addition, Suicune lacks reliable recovery, forcing it to rely on Leftovers and Rest in order to regain HP. This makes Suicune susceptible to Knock Off, as losing Leftovers would require Suicune to use Rest more often. In addition, its overreliance on Sleep Talk isn't great either, as you rely on RNG to choose the ideal move. Furthermore, Suicune's weakness to Grass- and Electric-type moves is easily exploitable by the common Power Whip Tangrowth, Zarude, and Thundurus-T.</p> ",

In addition, it is unable to sponge hits from foes like Rhyperior and Mamoswine, effectively taking up the teamslot of a Water-type without offering very much defensive utility. Toxic can be used to subdue Water-immune Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Mantine, and Seismitoad. However, Suicune often doesn't have room to run Toxic due to it suffering from four-moveslot syndrome. If you were to run Toxic, it would likely replace Sleep Talk on CroCune. A set with Calm Mind / Roar / Scald / Rest allows Suicune to be used as a dedicated phazer and stop foes like Calm Mind + Psyshock Galarian Slowbro from setting up; however, this would waste Suicune's sweeping capabilities and requires entry hazard support to be effective.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Pokemon such as Raikou and Thundurus-T can easily severely damage Suicune with Thunderbolt, even after a Calm Mind boost.

Yawn allows Torkoal to force opposing Pokemon out such as setup sweepers like Gyarados that can attempt to set up on it while also giving a free switch for a teammate, but Toxic is preferred for its ability to inflict more damage throughout the game. Rest + Sleep Talk can be used to boost Torkoal's longevity, especially when paired with Stealth Rock setters like Swampert to free up the moveslot. Heat Rock should always be run to maximize the amount of sun turns, allowing sun sweepers like Venusaur and Darmanitan to break through opposing teams more easily.</p> <p>Powerful sun sweepers like Venusaur, Darmanitan, and Chandelure all act as great partners to Torkoal, as they appreciate its entry hazard support and removal as well as sun boosting their moves to clean through teams. Venusaur in particular is a fantastic partner for Torkoal, as sun activates Chlorophyll and turns its Weather Ball into a strong Fire-type attack for Steel-types like Scizor, Jirachi, and Celesteela. Venusaur also appreciates Torkoal's ability to put answers to it like Moltres and Chandelure on a timer with Toxic. In return, Torkoal appreciates Venusaur breaking through Rock-types like Rhyperior and Lycanroc-D, Ground-types like Hippowdon, and Water-types like Primarina, Slowking, and Azumarill. Meanwhile, Darmanitan can use the sun to boost its incredibly powerful Flare Blitz and revenge kill threats like Nihilego and Nidoking that threaten Torkoal. It can also bring in Torkoal safely with U-turn. Chansey can provide a defensive stop to Pokemon that threaten Torkoal such as Nihilego and Chandelure while also being able to provide momentum with Teleport to bring in Pokemon like Venusaur and Chandelure safely. Swampert also acts as a defensive stop to threats like Salamence and Nidoqueen and frees up Stealth Rock for Torkoal. Hatterene can act as a secondary entry hazard control option, alleviating the pressure from Torkoal while also dealing with Pokemon like Salamence. It also appreciates its Mystical Fire being boosted by the sun, allowing it to break through Pokemon like Celesteela and Assault Vest Tangrowth more easily. Skarmory and Celesteela provide intergral defensive support against Hippowdon for sun teams. Setup sweepers like Autotomize Celesteela appreciate having their Fire-type coverage boosted by the sun to break through defensive answers like specially defensive Celesteela more easily.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Sporting a high Attack stat, Adaptability, and high-Base Power moves, Crawdaunt is an extremely powerful wallbreaker in UU capable of weakening or KOing even the bulkiest walls. Access to a strong priority move in Aqua Jet also allows it to bypass its low Speed and pick off targets such as Entei and Mienshao. After a Swords Dance boost it can take out even physically defensive Tangrowth and Skarmory. However, Crawdaunt is extremely slow, being outsped and KOed by common threats such as Salamence and Hydreigon. It also suffers from poor bulk and weaknesses to common typings, limiting its opportunities to switch in and set up. The omnipresent Zarude and Hydreigon resist both of Crawdaunt's STAB attacks limiting its ability as a wallbreaker. Finally, Crawdaunt suffers competition with Azumarill, which has an easier time setting up due to its superior defensive typing, although Crawdaunt's STAB Knock Off is a relevant advantage that lets it break the likes of Amoonguss and Tangrowth more easily.</p> ",

However, being Choice-locked makes it easy to take advantage of Crawdaunt and a Life Orb-boosted attack still hits hard enough to 2HKO Skarmory with Crabhammer. Close Combat can be ran over Swords Dance to let Crawdaunt threaten Zarude and Hydreigon on the switch. Liquidation can be used over Crabhammer on the Swords Dance set due to its better accuracy, but it's much weaker, failing to 2HKO foes like maximum HP Primarina.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Water-resistant threats: Due to its low Speed, Crawdaunt is forced out by anything faster that can take a boosted Aqua Jet like Gyarados, Rotom-W, and Salamence.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Both Amoonguss and Tangrowth can usually switch into Crawdaunt, though they both fear a +2 Knock Off. Tapu Bulu resists Crawdaunt's STAB combination, allowing it to pivot into it multiple times and threaten to OHKO back. Zarude outspeeds Crawdaunt and resists a boosted Aqua Jet, allowing it to revenge kill Crawdaunt with ease.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Though it would prefer to not switch in, Keldeo resists Crawdaunt's STAB combination and can OHKO it back. Conkeldurr is able to revenge kill Crawdaunt with Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Since Crawdaunt is frail and slow, damage from entry hazards, status such as poison and burn, Rocky Helmet, and Life Orb recoil can cut into its longevity even more.</p> ",

It even has a chance to KO physically defensive Tangrowth after a boost, with a guaranteed KO if Tangrowth has taken any chip. Aqua Jet allows Crawdaunt to hit frailer faster foes and potentially clean a weakened team, OHKOing Thundurus-T at +2. Life Orb is used to boost Crawdaunt's power and is preferred despite the recoil.</p> <p>This set is intended to be used as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker, with Swords Dance allowing Crawdaunt to break through defensive cores with more ease. Crawdaunt should try to set up against slower foes that it forces out such as Chansey and Galarian Slowbro. Pivots such as Mienshao, Jirachi, and Zarude can help Crawdaunt switch in. Chansey can also handle threats to Crawdaunt like Primarina and Thundurus-T while utilizing a slow Teleport to safely bring in Crawdaunt. Crawdaunt struggles against faster threats that can take a boosted Aqua Jet, such as Zarude, Keldeo, and Hydreigon, so checks to these are good partners. Amoonguss, for example, can switch into Keldeo and Zarude, while Fairy-types like Togekiss can check Hydreigon. Pokemon that can spread paralysis such as Jirachi and the aforementioned Togekiss can help Crawdaunt bypass its low Speed. Sticky Web support from Ribombee is also useful for the same reason.

    "overview": "<p>Salamence is a very versatile defensive and offensive presence. Its typing, natural bulk, and Intimidate allow it to check common threats such as Excadrill, Zarude, and Conkeldurr. It's also a solid Defogger, matching up well against entry hazard setters such as Excadrill, Skarmory, and Cobalion. Salamence can utilize its solid Special Attack, decent Speed tier, and powerful moves like Hurricane and Draco Meteor as a strong special attacker, or it can sweep teams with Dragon Dance and Moxie. That, coupled with coverage in Flamethrower and Earthquake, makes Salamence difficult to predict and revenge kill. However, its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots means Salamence does not appreciate Knock Off from Pokemon it’s supposed to check, such as Tangrowth and Krookodile. Bulky Fairy-types like Hatterene and Primarina can easily take a hit and KO Salamence, while many other threats like Jirachi, Gyarados, and Nidoking carry Ice-type coverage. Offensive threats such as Thundurus-T and Nihilego outspeed it, and Dragon Dance sets are also vulnerable to revenge killers with priority such as Mamoswine and Lycanroc-D. Salamence also faces fierce competition from Hydreigon; Hydreigon's higher Special Attack stat alongside Dark-type STAB moves lets it better deal with popular defensive stalwarts such as Slowking and Aegislash, and it has greater item versatility by virtue of its neutrality to Stealth Rock. However, Salamence has a far better matchup against Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Tapu Bulu, and it's able to outspeed and revenge kill opposing Hydreigon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An Intimidate Dragon Dance set using Roost over Outrage can work on Magneton teams to check problematic answers to Excadrill such as Zarude while remaining offensively potent. Fire Blast over Flamethrower on the special attacking set gives Salamence more power against Steel-types like Celesteela and Aegislash; however, it is less reliable and the additional power is often unneeded. Lum Berry can give Salamence more room to set up on Pokemon like Swampert and Tangrowth, but it doesn't carry as much consistent utility as Life Orb. Dragon Tail on the defensive set over Dual Wingbeat lets Salamence spread residual damage with entry hazards, though this is less functional than Toxic against foes like Azumarill. Choice Scarf alongside Moxie can give Salamence surprising sweeping potential, as it doesn't require a setup turn to outspeed targets such as Keldeo and revenge kills sweepers such as Gyarados. Choice Specs improves Salamence's wallbreaking ability and can lure Rhyperior in to nail it with Hydro Pump.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Pokemon such as Azumarill, Primarina, and Hatterene take advantage of Salamence's lack of coverage for them, having the bulk to take a hit and either set up or KO Salamence. Though a niche option, Diancie completely walls any special attacking variants of Salamence, has the bulk to survive a +1 Earthquake from Dragon Dance sets, and can KO Salamence or use it as a free chance to use Heal Bell.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Without Draco Meteor, special Salamence struggles to relieve Stealth Rock pressure from Nihilego, though it must be wary of Earthquake. Lycanroc-D can OHKO offensive variants of Salamence with -1 Stone Edge after minimal chip damage and easily revenge kill it with Accelerock, though Lycanroc-D cannot switch into Salamence safely.</p> <p><strong>Walls: Pokemon like Chansey and Slowking can handle special Salamence with their massive special bulk and use it for momentum with Teleport. However, the two cannot reliably tank hits from Dragon Dance sets. Umbreon and Mandibuzz have the natural bulk to survive Salamence's special attacks and take advantage of Dragon Dance sets with Foul Play. Celesteela is an especially detrimental defensive threat because it completely walls Dragon Dance sets without Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Mamoswine: Mamoswine is the most consistent revenge killer against Salamence, as Ice Shard OHKOes any set.</p> ",

Defog can be used over either STAB move, though this sacrifices neutral coverage against Pokemon like Nihilego and Azumarill. Flamethrower is solid coverage against Pokemon such as Jirachi and Aegislash and can finish off weakened targets such as Tapu Bulu and Heracross without risking a Hurricane miss.

Swampert and Excadrill are able to break through Salamence's checks like Diancie and Nihilego, provide Stealth Rock support to soften up defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela, and capitalize on support against Tangrowth. Excadrill also pressures Hatterene and Togekiss and provides Rapid Spin support so Salamence can drop Defog. Aegislash is a very effective partner that is able to break through Slowking and check Diancie. Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine takes advantage of Salamence removing potential roadblocks such as Amoonguss and Skarmory, and they threaten Stealth Rock setters Salamence has troubles against like Chansey and Nihilego. Zarude, Slowking, and Cobalion are effective pivots to safely bring Salamence into foes such as Hydreigon and Tangrowth. Slowking in particular provides slow pivoting with Teleport so Salamence can safely enter on Grass-types, as well as providing a stronger backbone against Conkeldurr with Colbur Berry. Rotom-W also acts as a pivot to bring Salamence in on Tangrowth and can check Mamoswine and Celesteela. Azelf can handle faster Pokemon such as Nihilego and Lycanroc-D.</p> "

Excadrill is an excellent lead that sets Stealth Rock to wear down bulky Pokemon such as Rotom-W and provides Rapid Spin. Sticky Web from Ribombee lets Salamence outspeed foes such as Nihilego. Celesteela walls this set, so early-game wallbreakers such as Nasty Plot Thundurus-T and Azelf are decent options. They also appreciate Salamence's ability to threaten Chansey. Other teammates that overwhelm physically bulky Pokemon such as Quagsire and Skarmory, such as Gyarados and Aegislash are valuable assets to this set. They also heavily benefit Salamence by overwhelming checks like Amoonguss and Primarina. Pivots such as Jirachi and Zarude can position Salamence to set up on Pokemon like Tangrowth.

Substitute provides Jirachi with a safe opportunity to use Toxic against its checks like Hippowdon, Moltres, and Swampert, or a safety net to repeatedly use Iron Head against Pokemon like Tangrowth and Amoonguss without risk. Fire Punch offers coverage against Steel-types such as Scizor, Cobalion, and Skarmory while boasting a significant 20% burn chance via Serene Grace, which can be used to stack up damage alongside Iron Head flinches to better pressure Toxic-immune Pokemon like Skarmory and Amoonguss. On top of this, a burned Amoonguss is unable to break Jirachi's Substitute in a single hit, turning it into setup bait for later in the game. Toxic pairs fantastically with Substitute and Iron Head, letting Jirachi wear down and break through Pokemon it would otherwise struggle with such as Slowking and Mandibuzz, as well as crippling offensive checks such as Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon.

Celesteela and Skarmory are perfect candidates for this role, encouraging Pokemon like Hippowdon, Slowking, and Moltres to switch into them and be poisoned while providing key defensive support against Pokemon like Scizor, Zarude, and Excadrill. Skarmory can also provide Spikes support to further wear down switch-ins to Jirachi like Amoonguss and Excadrill. SubToxic Jirachi mandates partners such as Scizor and Krookodile that can remove Rocky Helmet from common users of it such as Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Scizor is also able to remove the items of other notable Jirachi checks, such as Celesteela and Hippowdon's Leftovers and Moltres's Heavy-Duty Boots, while Krookodile can provide Stealth Rock support. Hippowdon and Excadrill are also fantastic options for Stealth Rock setters that pair well with Jirachi, switching into Knock Off variants of Nihilego so Jirachi can maintain its Leftovers. Hippowdon can help check Cobalion, Excadrill, and Zygarde-10% for Jirachi, while Excadrill can provide Rapid Spin support and a safer initial switch into an potential unrevealed Grass Knot Nihilego. Slowking is also fantastic due to checking various Steel-types such as Celesteela, Cobalion, and Excadrill, which Jirachi struggles with, and various other offensive threats such as Moltres and Salamence. Offensive teammates such as Keldeo and Moltres greatly appreciate Jirachi's ability to overwhelm their shared checks such as Amoonguss and Slowking, and in return they can provide Jirachi with useful pivots into these Pokemon. SubToxic Jirachi also fits well on more defensive balance and semi-stall teams, greatly appreciating Wish support from Umbreon letting it use Substitute more freely, and Heal Bell support from Pokemon like Chansey and Articuno lets it more aggressively switch into Slowking and freely attack Moltres.

Salamence is an excellent partner for Jirachi, pressuring Pokemon like Excadrill and Tangrowth. In return, Jirachi helps take on Fairy- and Rock-types like Hatterene, Togekiss, and Nihilego. Amoonguss can absorb Knock Off for Jirachi and check threats like Zarude and Swampert. Wallbreakers like Thundurus-T and Choice Specs Primarina appreciate Jirachi's U-turn getting them in against Pokemon like Celesteela and Moltres. They also appreciate Jirachi providing Stealth Rock to soften up checks like Tangrowth and Slowking. Jirachi can form a potent VoltTurn core with Rotom-H and Rotom-W, as they can force out threats to Jirachi like Moltres and Celesteela. They can also provide Defog support to prevent Spikes from wearing Jirachi down. Late-game sweepers like Swords Dance Scizor and Gyarados appreciate Jirachi's Healing Wish, letting them break earlier in the game and be revived to clean late-game.</p> "

Mamoswine can be used as a Stealth Rock setter but removing any of Mamoswine's four main moves severely limits its wallbreaking potential. Freeze-Dry is an option to OHKO Quagsire and nearly OHKO Swampert with Life Orb as well as better pressure Rotom-W. The utility offered by Knock Off is generally better, though, as it does nearly the same amount of damage as Freeze-Dry to Rotom-W, and Mamoswine can already nearly 2HKO Gastrodon and Quagsire with Earthquake.

Nasty Plot and a variety of coverage moves such as Fire Blast, Energy Ball, and Dazzling Gleam allow Azelf to hit nearly the entire tier for super effective damage, OHKOing most of it at +2. Access to Knock Off and U-turn also makes it a great offensive pivot that can threaten tier staples like Aegislash and Tangrowth. Despite Azelf's elite Speed, common Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Zarude easily revenge kill it. Azelf does not have much bulk and lacks recovery, leaving it worn down quickly and making it difficult to set up with Nasty Plot. It also needs pivot support to get in safely, as it typically cannot directly switch into any attack. Azelf struggles to fit all the moves it needs on its Nasty Plot set, as without Energy Ball Azelf struggles to break Slowking and Swampert, whereas without Dazzling Gleam it is completely walled by Hydreigon and Mandibuzz. Thundurus-T gives Azelf large competition as a special wallbreaker and pivot, having more power, a better typing, and no 4MSS.

Fire Blast OHKOes defensive Celesteela and Assault Vest Tangrowth at +2. It also covers many key threats such as Jirachi, Skarmory, and Excadrill. The last move is dependent on Azelf's team; Energy Ball is able to nail Slowking, Swampert, Azumarill, and Rhyperior for super effective damage. Meanwhile, Dazzling Gleam is an option to OHKO Hydreigon, 2HKO Salamence, and hit Galarian Moltres and Mandibuzz super effectively while also maintaining coverage for Krookodile. It also prevents Umbreon from completely walling Azelf. Since Azelf will typically be hitting its foes for super effective damage, Expert Belt is enough to OHKO nearly everything. Life Orb can be used to increase Azelf's damage output more consistently on targets that it cannot hit super effectively, like Hatterene and Moltres, but the chip damage adds up quickly and leaves Azelf more vulnerable to revenge killers with priority like Lycanroc-D.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Azelf is best used on hyper offense builds that can offer it support, although it can also fit on certain balance teams as a late-game wincon.

Ribombee can provide Sticky Web support to boost Azelf's ability to clean through teams, as Sticky Web invalidates common Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Zarude as revenge killers. It also ensures Azelf does not lose any Speed ties with Zygarde-10%. A pivot like Zarude can get Azelf in safely against Pokemon like Amoonguss.

Timid can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf Zarude, though the drop in power is less than ideal.</p> <p>This Seismitoad set fits only on rain teams, and its teammates should be able to help break through Pokemon it cannot such as Milotic and Chansey. Pelipper is the best partner to set Drizzle for Seismitoad and can bring it in safely with U-turn against foes like Thundurus-T. Other Swift Swim users like Kingdra can help Seismitoad overwhelm walls such as Amoonguss and Celesteela. Crawdaunt is an excellent partner that lures in and destroys bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth with a Swords Dance-boosted Knock Off, and it has priority in Aqua Jet to hit faster foes. Thundurus-T provides a good backup check to a weakened Raikou that also rips through Celesteela while potentially breaking through Chansey with a Nasty Plot-boosted Focus Blast. Offensive Salamence can pressure the Grass-types of the tier, namely Amoonguss and Choice Scarf Zarude.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Scolipede is a niche late-game cleaner thanks to its ability to boost both its Attack and Speed with Swords Dance and Speed Boost in one turn, giving it a good matchup against both offensive and defensive teams. Its decent STAB combination alongside Earthquake pressures a majority of the tier. Scolipede's typing also provides it with opportunities to set up against foes such as Tangrowth and prevents it from being crippled by Toxic. Unfortunately, Scolipede is very frail, which means it can struggle to set up a Swords Dance safely without being severely worn down. This can severely hinder its ability to clean late-game, especially when it continues to wear itself down from Life Orb recoil. The UU tier also has an abundance of priority users like Lycanroc-D, Azumarill, and Zygarde-10% that can easily pick off Scolipede. Albeit having a respectable Attack stat, Scolipede struggles to break through physically defensive walls such as Celesteela, Skarmory, and Mandibuzz even after a Swords Dance boost. Scolipede also has a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits how often it can switch in to find opportunities to set up and sweep. All of these factors cause Scolipede to face severe competition from other late-game sweepers like Nihilego and Gyarados.</p> ",

Protect is an option over Earthquake to guarantee a Speed boost, but losing a coverage option greatly hinders its ability to break through a good amount of the tier.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Mandibuzz can stomach a boosted hit from Scolipede and OHKO it in return. Swampert walls Scolipede after a Swords Dance boost and can easily beat it one-on-one. Celesteela and Skarmory indefinitely wall Scolipede, so unless they are removed, it will have a very hard time making any progress.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Lycanroc-D threatens to OHKO Scolipede with Accelerock, while other common priority users like Azumarill, Mamoswine, and Zygarde-10% can also pick off Scolipede if brought into range.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock hinders the number of times Scolipede can set up a Swords Dance and will bring it into range of priority users like Azumarill and Mamoswine.</p> ",

Earthquake gives Scolipede super effective coverage to break through Pokemon like Excadrill, Tentacruel, and Aegislash. Aqua Tail can be considered to help break through foes like Rhyperior and Rotom-H better; however, it will have a harder time with foes like Tentacruel and Aegislash. Heavy-Duty Boots are an option over Life Orb to offset its weakness to Stealth Rock; however, you miss out on OHKOing Amoonguss after Stealth Rock with a Swords Dance-boosted Megahorn. Amoonguss could then retaliate with a powerful Foul Play as a result. A Jolly nature allows Scolipede to outspeed threats like Keldeo before a Speed Boost, as well as Choice Scarf users like Zarude after a Speed boost.</p> <p>Scolipede should primarily be used on offense teams that can support it well enough to clean late-game.

Krookodile can also help Scolipede set up a Swords Dance more easily thanks to Intimidate and help blanket check Lycanroc-D if holding a Chople Berry. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Excadrill, Rotom-W, and Salamence can help alleviate Scolipede's weakness to Stealth Rock. Rotom-W can also bring Scolipede in against Grass-types like Tangrowth to set up, while Salamence does a phenomenal job of wearing down Rhyperior into range of a Swords Dance-boosted Earthquake.

Indeedee-F can provide Psychic Terrain support to prevent Scolipede from being revenge killed by common priority users such as Lycanroc-D and Azumarill.

Few Pokemon resist the combination of Earthquake and Knock Off, which dents even neutral targets such as Primarina, Keldeo, and Amoonguss. Intimidate lets Krookodile switch into resisted and neutral hits such as Lycanroc-D's Stone Edge without getting too worn down. It also helps prevent late-game sweeps from Pokemon like Salamence. Moves like Stealth Rock and Taunt let Krookodile compress utility roles, and its ability to run a plethora of items, like Life Orb, Leftovers, Choice Scarf, Choice Band, and resist berries, makes for a key factor in its unpredictability and versatility. It's one of the best Choice Scarf users in UU, capable of revenge killing threats like Thundurus-T and Lycanroc-D. With Choice Band, it can remove common answers to it like Amoonguss more easily. However, Krookodile is threatened by physical attackers like Lycanroc-D and Zygarde-10% even after Intimidate, and its special bulk leaves it vulnerable to special attackers like Nidoking and Aegislash. Weaknesses to common types like Grass, Water, and Fighting hinder its defensive utility and leave it helpless against common Pokemon like Tangrowth, Azumarill, and Conkeldurr. Coverage from Electric-types like Thundurus-T's Focus Blast prevents Krookodile from checking them despite its Electric immunity. Excadrill gives Krookodile immense competition as a utility Ground-type on teams, sporting a better defensive typing, having access to Rapid Spin, and being able to hit hard without investment in Attack. However, Krookodile's access to Knock Off, Intimidate, and a greater speed tier letting it threaten Moltres and opposing Excadrill gives it a niche on certain teams.</p> ",

Smack Down is an option on the Stealth Rock set to ground Skarmory and prevent it from taking advantage of Krookodile. Krookodile can opt for a more offensive Choice Scarf set with Moxie, letting it accumulate Attack boosts as it KOes enemies. However, the utility that Intimidate offers is more worth it to weaken Pokemon like Lycanroc-D, and Krookodile can't break past Grass-types and Buzzwole without enough boosts.

Unfortunately, Chandelure's rather average Speed and common weaknesses allow UU's many faster threats, including Keldeo, Krookodile, and Nihilego, to overwhelm it. Moreover, it is weak to Stealth Rock, which can significantly damage its longevity on sets that aren't running Heavy-Duty Boots. The other Fire- and Ghost-types available in UU also give Chandelure great competition, with Moltres offering greater utility through its typing, recovery, and pivoting capabilities, and Aegislash both lacking a Stealth Rock weakness and being more versatile overall.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind is an okay option for a set, taking advantage of defensive foes like Chansey to find setup opportunities. However, Chandelure's other sets are more immediately powerful, which is often more valuable for it. Will-O-Wisp is an option over Toxic on the Hex set, inflicting status on foes immune to poison like Tentacruel and Nihilego. However, Toxic is usually more valuable due to its greater long-term chip damage on Pokemon like Primarina and Gastrodon, as well as its ability to hit Fire-types like Rotom-H and Moltres. Energy Ball is a situational option for powering through various Pokemon, like Rhyperior, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad, in one hit. It also deals super effective damage to foes like Primarina and Suicune. Chandelure can still hit all the aforementioned targets hard with its Ghost-type moves, however. Choice Scarf Chandelure is an adequate revenge killer with its potent offensive typing, even still having the option of crippling defensive checks with Trick, though it notably lacks power and is usually only standout on sun teams. Memento allows Chandelure to grab momentum for its team after it's been weakened while potentially positioning a teammate to sweep. This is rather situational and gives up better utility, though, usually only working well on Choice item sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Several Water-types can often find ways to give Chandelure trouble. Azumarill and Crawdaunt can apply serious pressure with their powerful STAB Aqua Jet. Primarina can take any hit from full health and power through Chandelure with its Water-type STAB moves. Tentacruel can be particularly annoying, tanking attacks with its good special bulk and checking the Hex set well thanks to its Toxic immunity. Although they fear Toxic, Milotic and Mantine make for solid answers thanks to their reliable recovery. Both can also often take two Choice Specs-boosted Shadow Balls from full, but they should be wary of being too worn down to reliably pivot in.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Krookodile and Zarude often struggle to reliably switch in, but they can outspeed Chandelure and pick it off with super effective STAB moves. Incineroar, albeit uncommon, resists both of Chandelure's STAB moves and can take advantage of it to annoy a switch-in with either Knock Off or status. Galarian Moltres's high Special Defense allows it to tank hits from Chandelure to then set up. Umbreon is another good check thanks to its superb special bulk and Heal Bell, which allow it to handle Hex sets on its own.</p> <p><strong>Faster threats: Chandelure's rather average Speed leaves it vulnerable to most faster Pokemon, such as Keldeo, Lycanroc-D, and Mienshao, which can smack it with super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Various specially bulky Pokemon can tank hits from Chandelure and cripple it in return. Chansey doesn't risk major damage from any attack, but it needs to look out for Trick or Taunt on the switch; Taunt leaves it completely unable to touch Chandelure. Nihilego can always take at least one Shadow Ball from full and pressure Chandelure with a super effective STAB moves. It's a particularly strong check to the Hex set, bearing an immunity to Toxic and taking minimal damage from Fire-type moves.</p> ",

Overheat is also an option, offering even more power and notably damaging foes like Bulletproof Kommo-o and Incineroar more reliably. However, its Special Attack drop makes Fire Blast more spammable. Flamethrower is strong and accurate, preventing foes like Aegislash, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss from utilizing a lucky Fire Blast miss to cripple Chandelure. Psychic is an option that provides coverage against Kommo-o and Nihilego, though both these targets are adequately worn down by Chandelure's other attacks. Sleep Talk lets Chandelure act as a sleep absorber for its team, pivoting in on Amoonguss's Spore without being entirely crippled. Trick is another option in the fourth moveslot, however, to cripple defensive switch-ins like Chansey, Incineroar, and Tentacruel. Flash Fire allows Chandelure to pivot in on Fire-type attacks from foes like Moltres and Choice-locked Entei, boosting its damage output. Flame Body is also an option, however, to potentially punish physical attackers such as Buzzwole.</p> <p>This set is a solid fit on offense and balance teams for the massive wallbreaking prowess it offers. Chandelure appreciates entry hazard support for furthering damage on foes alongside its attacks; Rhyperior and Seismitoad are solid choices, additionally pivoting in on foes that can revenge kill it like Lycanroc-D and Thundurus-T. Entry hazard removal is also important due to this set's vulnerability to Stealth Rock. Tentacruel can pivot in on foes like Keldeo and Primarina while utilizing Rapid Spin. Rotom-W is a particularly strong teammate, as it can lure in Grass-types like Amoonguss and pivot Chandelure into them with Volt Switch while also making use of Defog. Pivots that can bring Chandelure in safely for opportunities to wallbreak make good teammates. Zarude is another strong partner, pressuring foes like Primarina and Nihilego for Chandelure and bringing it in against Pokemon like Buzzwole and Amoonguss. Sweepers like Swords Dance Kommo-o and Calm Mind Keldeo appreciate this set's wallbreaking prowess weakening teams for them to more easily clean up late-game.

Toxic burdens potential switch-ins like Bulletproof Kommo-o, Gastrodon, and Salamence, putting them on a timer and allowing Chandelure to potentially whittle them down with Hex. Protect allows Chandelure to rack up poison damage and can also scout Choice item users, such as Zarude and Primarina. Fire Blast is an option over Flamethrower, providing more power for breaking past foes like Galarian Moltres and Nidoqueen more reliably. Its lower accuracy can be a burden, however, against foes like Amoonguss and Tangrowth that can punish a miss. Taunt is an option over Protect, allowing Chandelure to pressure Chansey more effectively by blocking Chansey's recovery and Toxic, which boosts its stall matchup. However, Protect is often too valuable thanks to its stronger applications against offensive Pokemon. Heavy-Duty Boots significantly boosts this set's longevity and self-sufficiency. Flash Fire allows Chandelure to take advantage of foes like opposing Choice-locked Chandelure. Flame Body is also an option, however, allowing it to pivot into and threaten a burn against foes like Jirachi and Celesteela. It can also let Chandelure cripple Pokemon that revenge kill it, like Knock Off Azelf, as it faints.</p> <p>This set is a strong fit on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate Chandelure's ability to wear down defensive threats early- to mid-game. Chandelure notably struggles breaking past the likes of Nihilego and Tentacruel with this set's listed options, making Pokemon more equipped to handle them, like Nidoqueen and Seismitoad, good teammates. Both can also set Stealth Rock for Chandelure, whittling down its checks. Other entry hazard setters can work well too; Rhyperior can also ease the matchup against foes like Moltres and Nihilego without Grass Knot, and Kommo-o can pivot in on opposing Chandelure. Sweepers like Kommo-o and Keldeo appreciate Chandelure's ability to weaken bulky foes like Rhyperior and Primarina throughout a match with Toxic, allowing them to clean up more easily late-game. Chandelure appreciates them compensating for its slightly paltry Speed. Chandelure also enjoys pivots as teammates, as it doesn't often enjoy directly switching into play. In addition to providing pivoting support, Choice Scarf Jirachi can pressure faster Pokemon like Lycanroc-D and Nihilego, while Rotom-W can lure in Pokemon like Tangrowth for Chandelure to take advantage of. Rotom-W can also pivot in on various Ground-types, like Rhyperior and Krookodile. Other status spreaders can work well as teammates, alleviating Chandelure's need for prediction regarding Hex. Galarian Slowbro is particularly good at spreading status due to its tendency to run both Scald and Sludge Bomb. Tentacruel does this as well and can also utilize Knock Off to further cripple foes.</p> "

Hydreigon also can utilize a Choice Scarf set to revenge kill setup sweepers and fast threats, like Gyarados, Zygarde-10%, and Azelf, while also having a fast U-turn to escape unfavorable matchups and potentially Defog to compress entry hazard removal. Hydreigon's decent defensive typing alongside recovery in Roost lets it naturally check threats like Slowking, Rotom-W, and Chandelure. However, Choice Specs Hydreigon has an exploitable Speed tier, falling short of staples like Salamence, Thundurus-T, Keldeo, and Cobalion, which allows it to be revenge killed rather easily. On the other hand, the Choice Scarf set lacks the outright power to get past Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, and Celesteela, and it also can get heavily punished for locking into any move, with more offensive teams outright using it as setup bait. The presence of Fairy-types that are neutral to Flash Cannon like Primarina and Azumarill means Hydreigon can struggle to click a nuclear Draco Meteor when they're on the enemy team. Moreover, it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, as it has to choose between Flamethrower to cook Celesteela, Cobalion, and bulky Scizor or Flash Cannon to keep the aforementioned Fairy-types and Togekiss from blanking it.</p> ",

Nasty Plot can be used to turn Hydreigon into a ferocious wallbreaker that can get many setup chances alongside Roost. With a boost, it can easily break past Pokemon that would normally switch into it like Celesteela, Mandibuzz, and Hippowdon using its STAB moves. However, this set thuds into Primarina and gets revenge killed easily. Shock Wave on the Choice Specs set is an option to keep Primarina from walling Hydreigon, cleanly 2HKOing most variants. Belch + Salac Berry + Nasty Plot + Substitute can be used to boost Hydreigon's Speed and OHKO Primarina and Azumarill after a Nasty Plot with Belch, but this set is unreliable because it will often not activate the Berry, rendering Belch useless.

Thundurus-T's pivot set is able to wear down Pokemon like Salamence and Slowking and bring in teammates like Scizor, forming potent VoltTurn cores. Access to coverage options like Grass Knot, Knock Off, Focus Blast, and Psychic allows Thundurus-T to overcome counterplay like Swampert, Chansey, Excadrill, and Amoonguss, making it very difficult to scout its moveset. Thundurus-T also can utilize Nasty Plot to become a ferocious wallbreaker with no counters, being able to muscle past the sturdiest of specially defensive walls like Chansey and Assault Vest Tangrowth at +2 and crush balance teams. However, this set isn't too common in the metagame due to its average bulk, meaning it struggles to set up safely against common offensive teams. Even in matchups against bulkier teams, Thundurus-T usually gets inflicted with Toxic poison, allowing it to be played around easily. Because Thundurus-T's weakness to Stealth Rock mandates the use of Heavy-Duty Boots, it can't utilize boosting items like Life Orb to wallbreak easier. It also suffers from an exploitable Speed tier, leaving it vulnerable to being revenge killed by common threats like Nihilego, Zarude, Keldeo, Azelf, and Zygarde-10%. It is also vulnerable to priority from slower threats like Mamoswine. Thundurus-T is often reliant on trading with threats like Salamence with its pivot set due to Volt Switch's low Base Power, making it more vulnerable to the aforementioned revenge killers. Even Pokemon like Amoonguss, Mandibuzz, and Scizor can stay in and trade with the pivot set if needed.

U-turn also has the benefit of not getting blocked by Ground-types like Hippowdon, but this causes Thundurus-T to struggle even more with fitting necessary coverage. Volt Switch can even be used alongside Thunderbolt if Thundurus-T doesn't need the extra coverage.

Keldeo's good Speed tier also lets it outspeed and threaten an OHKO on Pokemon like Zarude, Thundurus-T, and Nihilego, helping further separate it from other wallbreakers in the tier. This is further augmented by its resistance to common priority moves like Scizor's Bullet Punch and Mamoswine's Ice Shard. Keldeo does have some large issues, like generally struggling to break through Primarina, Slowking, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth without support—the latter three further exploit its Choice Specs to scout its attack through Regenerator—but its upside still makes it a top choice for a wallbreaker.

Its damage output is mediocre, though, and Keldeo's Speed tier isn't amazingly suited to being a team's fast Pokemon that keeps other fast Pokemon in check, so it must be paired with a teammate like Choice Scarf Diggersby or Noivern. A Calm Mind set with Scald, Secret Sword, and one of either Air Slash or Substitute is decent on Keldeo, but it loses harder to pretty much all of Keldeo's answers than the Choice Specs set already does. Choice Scarf sets with Flip Turn are a fine option if the ability to outspeed extremely fast Pokemon like boosted Salamence and Choice Scarf Zarude is absolutely necessary for a team to function, but Keldeo's unboosted damage output is somewhat disappointing and Flip Turn hits like a wet noodle off Keldeo's meager Attack stat, leaving it generally outclassed by other fast pivots like Noivern and Choice Scarf Hydreigon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types, specifically those resistant to Secret Sword like Slowking and RestTalk Primarina, can switch into Keldeo all game long, as long as they keep themselves healthy.

A Jolly nature lets Diggersby outspeed +1 Gyarados; however, it requires some chip damage to revenge kill it with Body Slam.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Diggersby fits best on offense teams that require a strong wallbreaker that can overcome any Speed deficiencies within the team. Since Diggersby is able to use U-turn on its primary switch-ins like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Salamence, it appreciates a teammate like Primarina or Nihilego that can be brought in to pressure these foes. Diggersby can also form a strong VoltTurn core with Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Rotom-H, as both can pivot against common switch-ins like Chansey and bring Diggersby in on a favorable matchup. A Stealth Rock setter like Nihilego or Cobalion helps stack entry hazards and significantly improves Diggersby's ability to clean through chipped foes. Being Choice-locked into Body Slam or Earthquake puts Diggersby in a disadvantageous position against a common Normal- or Ground-immune Pokemon like Aegislash, Galarian Moltres, and Gyarados. Since these Pokemon can use Diggersby as a free entry point, with the latter two being able to set up for a sweep, Diggersby will need teammates that can immediately pressure these foes, like Lycanroc-D. A more defensive teammate like Chansey can also be used to switch in and pivot out with Teleport to gain momentum for another wallbreaker.</p> "

  "Aegislash": {
    "overview": "<p>Aegislash's unique typing with useful resistances and immunities coupled with its great blend of offense and defense make it one of the most influential Pokemon in the tier. It can run many different sets that allow it to pick and choose its counters. A Substitute + Toxic set is one of the hardest foes to switch around and take down, as it capitalizes on Aegislash's great bulk to whittle down its common checks with Toxic damage and powerful Shadow Balls. Swords Dance Aegislash with Shadow Sneak is an incredibly threatening sweeper that can pick off many teams just after some chip damage. Mixed sets make for strong wallbreakers that are capable of 2HKOing Chansey and heavily damaging Zarude, which would otherwise be safe switch-ins. It can also effectively run an Autotomize set with Weakness Policy, which takes advantage of the many weak super effective moves thrown at it, like Tentacruel's or Nihilego's Knock Off, while fixing one of its greatest flaws in its low Speed. Its great bulk in Shield forme and Stealth Rock resistance give it points of entry into Pokemon without strong super effective attacks like Nihilego and Jirachi. Still, Aegislash suffers from a very low Speed and typing that is vulnerable to many of UU's staples, including Krookodile, Moltres, and Zarude, which can easily revenge kill it. Aegislash is also overly reliant on King's Shield to tank most neutral hits, which can make it very predictable for setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Salamence and Swords Dance Lycanroc-D to take advantage of it. Lacking reliable recovery also leaves it very vulnerable to being worn down in the course of a game, especially if it takes Knock Off from Pokemon it wants to check like Nihilego. Some mixed walls like Assault Vest Tangrowth and Celesteela can easily scout and force out Aegislash early-game, which greatly hinders its unpredictability factor and lets opponents adjust accordingly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shadow Sneak is an option as the fourth move on the King's Shield + Toxic set to pick off weakened foes, most notably setup sweepers like Necrozma and Polteageist; however, it isn't as consistently useful as other options. Steel Beam gives Choice Specs Aegislash an incredibly powerful nuke to OHKO foes like Amoonguss, but it is not preferred due to Aegislash already effectively threatening Amoonguss with its other moves and the move whittling Aegislash down rather quickly. Choice Band makes Aegislash a terrifying physical wallbreaker and makes its priority even stronger, although this set can struggle with Rocky Helmet users like Amoonguss and doesn't appreciate being locked into moves. Metal Sound exploits defensive switch-ins like Amoonguss, giving Aegislash a great chance to KO it after Stealth Rock damage. However, this isn't the most consistent move, as it is very prediction reliant and unable to punish faster Pokemon on the switch; also, even with the -2 drop, sturdier Pokemon like Assault Vest Tangrowth can still deal with Aegislash.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Aegislash notably struggles with Dark-types like Obstagoon, Zarude, and Krookodile; while it does have Close Combat to punish them if they get too careless, they still threaten it with super effective moves and can easily switch in on Shadow Ball. Galarian Moltres and Umbreon are especially troublesome, as they have the special bulk to tank Aegislash's hits and can shake off status with Rest and Heal Bell, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls: Mixed walls like Assault Vest Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Celesteela are very annoying for Aegislash early-game, as they aren't immediately threatened by any of its moves and can KO Aegislash in its Blade forme thanks to their lower Speed and super effective coverage. Chansey completely walls sets lacking Close Combat and can regain momentum with Teleport. However, it struggles more against Aegislash with Close Combat than the three previously mentioned.</p> <p><strong>Burn and Knock Off: Losing its passive recovery to Knock Off or a burn greatly limits the effectiveness of the King's Shield + Toxic set, making it incredibly susceptible to chip damage from weak attacks and Stealth Rock. Other sets also hate one or both of these, as special sets are very dependent on their boosting items and physical sets are significantly weaker when burned.</p> ",

Toxic cripples common Shadow Ball switch-ins like Mandibuzz Assault Vest Tangrowth and builds up chip damage for Aegislash's teammates to capitalize on. Substitute allows Aegislash to get even more Toxic damage while also reducing the prediction it needs; it can also stop moves like Amonguss's Spore. King's Shield allows Aegislash to switch into its Shield forme and scout Choiced-locked foes like Krookodile and Keldeo so that it can switch into the right teammate if needed. Heavy investment in HP and Special Defense lets Aegislash switch into Pokemon like Salamence and Galarian Slowbro without fearing a 3HKO in Shield forme and cripple or attack them; this investment also stops Amoonguss's Foul Play from breaking its Substitute. 136 Speed EVs are an option to outpace Conkeldurr and everything slower.</p> <p>This set is a solid fit on semi-stall and balance teams thanks to its ability to heavily wear down Aegislash's typical checks, open up holes for its teammates, and be a solid defensive presence. Specially defensive foes that don't care about Toxic, like Celesteela and Chansey, are incredibly hard for this set to deal with, stopping it from making any progress; that's why powerful wallbreakers such as Mienshao pair really well with it, and Aegislash can soften up some checks to them like Salamence with Toxic damage. Other offensive Pokemon like Jungle Healing Zarude don't care what Aegislash can do to them, so sturdier walls like Tangrowth pair really well with this set. Fairy-types like Primarina and Togekiss give it more security against Fighting-types and cover Aegislash's Dark weakness; Sylveon is a notable partner, giving Aegislash Wish support so that it doesn't rely solely on Leftovers for its recovery. Umbreon is another useful partner, not only providing Wish but also easily spreading Toxic and checking some nuisances for Aegislash like Moltres and Nidoking. Regenerator and a Poison typing make Amoonguss one of the most obnoxious foes against this set, meaning that offensive checks to it like Moltres and Mamoswine are natural partners. Aegislash teams need a secondary check for Tangrowth and Nihilego, as they commonly run Knock Off and can leave Aegislash horribly crippled; Pokemon like Amoonguss can achieve this exact job.</p> "

Late-game cleaners like Lycanroc-D and Choice Scarf Krookodile greatly appreciate Aegislash weakening defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss for them.

Weakness Policy takes advantage of Aegislash's great bulk in Shield forme, which lets it take one super effective hit, like Lycanroc-D's Crunch or Salamence's Flamethrower, to boost its Attack even further. Air Balloon is a very good alternative, making Aegislash even harder to revenge kill by hindering Pokemon like Diggersby and Rhyperior.</p> <p>This set is an incredible fit on bulky offense and hyper offense teams looking for a strong priority-using sweeper.

Quagsire is incredibly hard for this set to get past thanks to their high physical bulk, super effective moves, and Unaware in the former's case; all of this makes Gyarados an incredible partner, KOing both with Power Whip and Bounce, respectively. Strong special attackers like Primarina, which handles foes such as Quagsire, are also really good teammates.

Furthermore, its defensive typing, access to reliable recovery, and decent bulk allow Noivern to reliably check threats like Keldeo and Zarude. Unfortunately, Noivern finds itself competing for a spot on teams with the tier's other Dragon / Flying type, Salamence. Salamence is much stronger and bulkier, which makes it a better wallbreaker and allows it to fulfill Noivern's defensive niche much more effectively than Noivern itself.

Defog is a solid option, as Noivern is the fastest Defogger in the metagame and also checks common entry hazard setters like Jirachi and Kommo-o. However, Noivern struggles to fit Defog into its moveset, and if you want to run a Dragon / Flying Defogger, Salamence is a better option. Choice Specs is an option to make Noivern hit harder, but the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots makes Noivern incredibly susceptible to Stealth Rock, and thus it remains a very fringe option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Chansey brushes off all of Noivern's moves and forces it to switch out, though it does have to worry about Taunt.

Scald allows Primarina to get a burn on switch-ins like Amoonguss, Celesteela, and Tentacruel, negating the recovery from their items. 124 Special Defense EVs and Leftovers allow Primarina to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Chandelure's Shadow Ball and 3HKO from Salamence's Hurricane from full HP without Stealth Rock, with the rest put into Defense to take on Dragon Dance Salamence and Keldeo's Secret Sword better. Leftovers is great, as it synergizes well with Rest + Sleep Talk, but Heavy-Duty Boots is an option to negate damage from entry hazards if the team has unreliable or no hazard removal.</p> <p>RestTalk Primarina is mainly used on bulky teams that appreciate a status sponge and value the defensive qualities its typing provides. Necrozma is an excellent partner, as it can threaten Amoonguss and Tentacruel, that would otherwise counter Primarina. Zarude checks Rotom-W and Chansey while appreciating Primarina checking Keldeo and Kommo-o. Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Moltres can help check Grass-types such as Zarude and Assault Vest Tangrowth, and provide momentum with Volt Switch and U-turn. Hazard control is important for Primarina to not be chipped down easily and forced to use Rest if it is running Leftovers. Salamence removes entry hazards with Defog and checks Zarude well. Kommo-o, Rhyperior, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can all form solid defensive cores with Primarina, as they are able to check Pokemon such as Volcanion, Thundurus, and Rotom-W nicely, while Primarina checks Salamence, Keldeo, and Moltres in return.</p> "

Common checks like Amoonguss can't deal with Primarina if it uses Substitute as they come in, as Primarina is faster and can set up with Calm Mind. Substitute also eases prediction when forcing switches from Pokemon like Salamence and Kommo-o. Draining Kiss aids Primarina in recovering HP, allowing it to take more hits and use Substitute if needed. However, Draining Kiss is a very weak move and will only pose a threat if Primarina has accumulated enough boosts. Moonblast, on the other hand, is powerful from the start and lets Primarina not rely too much on Calm Mind boosts to threaten Water-resistant Pokemon like Tangrowth and Rotom-W. Scald is a reliable Water-type move, capable of burning Pokemon trying to check it, like Tentacruel, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Leftovers compensates the 25% loss in HP from Substitute. With the given EV spread Primarina is able to beat Amoonguss one-on-one, as it ensures Amoonguss can't break Primarina's Substitute after a Calm Mind.</p> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind Primarina fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, as its ability to come in on moves like Draco Meteor from Salamence is greatly appreciated by other teammates. By switching on these moves, Primarina can either get a Substitute up or set up with Calm Mind if its checks have been eliminated or weakened. Strong wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Nidoking, and Aegislash can get past bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Electric-types such as Raikou and Thundurus-T force Primarina out of the field if it doesn't have a Substitute up, so Pokemon like Rhyperior and Seismitoad take care of them. They can also set Stealth Rock to aid Primarina in its sweep. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can take on strong physical attackers such as Diggersby and Mamoswine for Primarina. Chansey is extremely annoying, as it can take boosted hits with ease and threaten Primarina back with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Conkeldurr, Lycanroc-D, and Swords Dance Diggersby are powerful wallbreakers that can muscle through Chansey and remove it for Primarina.</p> "

Access to strong coverage moves, such as Close Combat to break past Excadrill, Crunch to deal with Slowking, and Psychic Fangs to break past Amoonguss makes Lycanroc-D very unpredictable to defensively answer. However, Lycanroc-D struggles to break through teams that run physically bulky threats such as Tangrowth, Hippowdon, Swampert, and Skarmory. Its poor bulk also means it cannot come in on almost anything, so it requires pivot support to come in safely as well as occasional aggressive prediction on expected switches. Lycanroc-D is also very prone to wearing itself down between entry hazards and Life Orb recoil, limiting its staying presence on the field. The presence of priority attackers like Scizor and Azumarill can easily pick off Lycanroc-D. Zygarde-10% gives Lycanroc-D fierce competition as a fast physical wallbreaker due to a Stealth Rock resistance, higher Speed, and less prediction reliance.</p> ",

Psychic Fangs inflicts heavy damage on the likes of Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and Keldeo. Crunch hits Slowking, Jirachi, and Galarian Slowbro harder, but these targets get musceled through by Stone Edge or Close Combat. Accelerock is useful against offense teams, specifically keeping threats such as Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados in check.

The combination of Knock Off and Toxic lets it outlast Pokemon that would otherwise counter it, such as Tentacruel and Nihilego, and open up counters like Hippowdon for teammates. However, due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Salazzle is forced to run Heavy-Duty Boots as opposed to a power-boosting item, which makes it heavily reliant on chip damage to make an impact. Its poor bulk also leaves it unable to contribute defensively in most games, and its typing makes it susceptible to priority users like Azumarill and Lycanroc-D.

This frailty also deters it from switching directly into most Pokemon it would otherwise check, especially Scizor and Tangrowth, who both carry Knock Off and can remove its Heavy-Duty Boots. Therefore, it would rather be preserved as a secondary check to the aforementioned Pokemon.

Nihilego is an amazing Stealth Rock setter, as its resistances give very good matchups against Defoggers such as Salamence, Moltres, and Mandibuzz. Its Knock Off is useful for common switch-ins like Chansey, Aegislash, Excadrill, and Celesteela. It can use Meteor Beam as well to boost its Special Attack and become a fierce sweeper. Its unique Speed tier puts it ahead of Salamence, Thundurus-T, and Moltres, and after a Speed boost from Beast Boost, it only falls behind Choice Scarf Zarude. However, its weaknesses and horrid Defense stat leave it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Excadrill, Jirachi, and Keldeo, and priority from the likes of Conkeldurr, Azumarill, and Crawdaunt easily shuts it down. It lacks room for coverage for Pokemon like Nidoking, and it just cannot get past checks like Jirachi and Aegislash.</p> ",

However, the utility Knock Off provides is amazing, and it's only worth replacing if Nihilego's team has enough other Knock Off users. Protect scouts Choice-locked foes like Zygarde-10%, letting Nihilego switch to the appropriate teammate, but is hard to fit over the very valuable Knock Off. Toxic Spikes is a secondary entry hazard option that weakens defensive staples like Swampert and cripples Substitute users such as Primarina. However, Poison-types remove it and a large portion of the metagame is immune to it, like Rotom-H, Salamence, Celesteela, and Aegislash. A Choice Scarf set with Power Gem / Sludge Bomb / Thunderbolt / Grass Knot lets Nihilego clean through teams and revenge kill Pokemon like Keldeo and other Choice Scarf users like Krookodile, but Choice-locked Nihilego is vulnerable to Pokemon like Aegislash and Azumarill. Pain Split can be considered as a form of recovery on the utility set, but it is very unreliable due to Nihilego's high HP and can only be used against special attackers that can't hurt it much.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is Nihilego's best answer, capable of wearing it down with Seismic Toss and healing itself with Soft-Boiled. As long as Chansey doesn't let it accumulate several boosts, it can always beat Nihilego. Chansey hates having its Eviolite removed, though.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Krookodile, Nidoking, and Swampert don't care about Nihilego's STAB moves and can force it out of the field with their STAB Ground-type moves, but they have dislike getting hit with Knock Off. Zygarde-10% outspeeds Nihilego and can OHKO it with Thousand Arrows.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Excadrill and Jirachi wall Nihilego easily and can scare it out with their STAB attacks. The former is troublesome, since it can easily come in and remove Nihilego's Stealth Rock. Cobalion can pivot into Nihilego's attacks and exploit its weak physical defense. Celesteela is capable of taking +1 Thunderbolt and OHKOing Nihilego back with Heavy Slam. Aegislash easily switches into even boosted Nihilego and can KO it with its Steel-type STAB move or revenge kill it with Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users: Faster threats like Lycanroc-D, Zarude, and Azelf all outspeed and threaten to OHKO Nihilego. However, these Pokemon must be wary of Nihilego getting a speed boost after getting a KO on its Meteor Beam set.

Sludge Bomb poisons are helpful for crippling checks like Swampert. Knock Off cripples checks to Nihilego like Aegislash, Chansey, and Celesteela. It's also great for removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Defoggers. Black Sludge mitigates entry hazards and chip damage.

Nihilego's team appreciates its good defensive typing and Knock Off, and its offensive capabilities are valuable for removing threats like Primarina and Salamence. Stall in particular appreciates Nihilego's good matchup against Nasty Plot Togekiss and Thundurus-T. Skarmory is an amazing partner for Nihilego, forming an entry hazard stacking core with it and checking major threats like Excadrill and Zarude. In return, Nihilego beats threats to Skarmory like Moltres and Thundurus-T. Wallbreakers like Thundurus-T, Mamoswine, and Conkeldurr love Nihilego setting up Stealth Rock and weakening their checks like Assault Vest Tangrowth, Celesteela, and Amoonguss. Chansey completely walls this set even after having its Eviolite removed, so these wallbreakers can also take care of it. Pivots like Slowking, Azelf, and Zarude can bring in Nihilego to set Stealth Rock and wallbreak. Aegislash has notable defensive synergy with Nihilego, as it checks Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, Lycanroc-D, and Slowking.

  "Celesteela": {
    "overview": "<p>Celesteela's typing and defensive stats are both fantastic, allowing it to check a considerable portion of UU's top threats, including Salamence, Aegislash, Jirachi, Nihilego, and Excadrill. Thanks to its decent offensive stats, powerful STAB Heavy Slam, and access to Flamethrower to smack foes like Aegislash and Zarude, Celesteela can prevent itself from being too passive. Leech Seed is also an excellent tool, sustaining Celesteela's longevity and allowing it to significantly wear down its switch-ins, such as Rotom-H and Thundurus-T, potentially forcing them out. Autotomize sets are also a strong option, tapping into Celesteela's strong special coverage and the sweeping potential Beast Boost lends it. Despite its defensive potency, however, Celesteela suffers a bit from its lack of access to reliable recovery, which can prevent it from tanking strong neutral hits as consistently as it would like to and cause it to be overreliant on Leftovers. This can allow a few common Pokemon, such as Nihilego and Mamoswine, to muscle past Celesteela after relatively minimal chip damage. Celesteela also struggles to bypass popular Fire- and Electric-types such as Moltres and Thundurus-T on its own, as well as various defensive picks like Tentacruel and Slowking; Tentacruel can utilize Liquid Ooze to take advantage of Leech Seed, while Slowking doesn't take meaningful damage from any of Celesteela's attacks, can absorb Leech Seed and Teleport out, and can threaten to chip Celesteela down with burns from Scald.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Celesteela's can utilize a mixed Assault Vest set to better answer Aegislash and Salamence, with its colorful movepool letting it surprise typical checks such as Slowking with Megahorn and Moltres with Stone Edge and potentially break large holes in the opposing team. Due to its selection of potent physical moves such as Earthquake and Stone Edge, Celesteela can also run a physically based Autotomize set, effectively luring checks like Tentacruel and Rotom-H. However, this generally isn't as effective due to Celesteela's middling immediate power and hardships breaking various Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Krookodile. Earthquake is an option in the fourth slot of the defensive set to still hit Steel-types super effectively while also hitting Tentacruel hard. However, Flamethrower is usually way more valuable for its ability to pressure Zarude while still hitting Steel-types. Toxic cripples some of Celesteela's switch-ins on the defensive set, but it generally isn't as useful as its other options, and, due to foregoing either Protect, it notably makes Celesteela more susceptible to being worn down.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types like Moltres, Volcanion, Rotom-H, and Chandelure can pivot in on both Heavy Slam and Flamethrower and hit Celesteela hard with super effective STAB moves. They can also blanket check Celesteela's Autotomize set if it opts for Flash Cannon, though Meteor Beam can power through them. Moltres is particularly annoying, often being able to restore any chip damage it sustains from Leech Seed with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Toxtricity can tank hits from either of Celesteela's sets and proceed to break past it with super effective STAB attacks, though they all take fair damage from Meteor Beam.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Chansey doesn't take major damage from Celesteela's attacks and can whittle it down with Seismic Toss or bring in a teammate with Teleport. Tentacruel's Liquid Ooze punishes Leech Seed attempts and it doesn't take major damage from any attack Celesteela commonly runs. Slowking can pivot into Celesteela and Teleport out to stop Leech Seed or chip it with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Celesteela's defensive set becomes far easier to wear down if Leftovers, its most reliable means of passive recovery, has been removed. Knock Off users like Mamoswine, Azelf, and Nihilego can wear it down immensely as it tries potentially pivoting in on them. The Autotomize set is also often reliant on whichever item it is running to pose a significant offensive threat, which can prevent Celesteela from setting up on foes like Nihilego and Tangrowth as safely as it would like to at times.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Celesteela's lack of reliable recovery allows particularly powerful wallbreakers, including Conkeldurr, Primarina, Mamoswine, and Aegislash, to quickly overwhelm it.</p> ",

It also prevents Pokemon like Gyarados and Dragon Dance Salamence from reliably setting up on Celesteela, chipping them down.

Slowking can also bring Celesteela in safely with Teleport against foes such as Tapu Bulu and Hydreigon. Nihilego is another good teammate, pivoting in on Pokemon like Moltres and Thundurus-T for Celesteela while appreciating its ability to deal with Ground-types such as Excadrill and Nidoking.

Fire Blast provides important coverage against Steel-types like Aegislash and Jirachi. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for its greater accuracy. However, Celesteela wants all the power it can get due to this set's nature as a sweeper. Meteor Beam grants Celesteela an opportunity to bypass Fire-types like Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure. It also deals massive damage to foes like Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Salamence, and the Special Attack boost it supplies is often extremely useful in boosting Celesteela's sweeping capabilities. Due to taking two turns, however, it must be used with Power Herb, and Celesteela must watch out for the opponent predicting the attack and bringing in a foe that resists it due to often being restricted to a one-time use. Flash Cannon is also an option in the fourth slot, offering more overall consistency and giving Celesteela a strong secondary STAB attack that deals decent neutral damage and hits Pokemon like Hatterene, Nihilego, and Rhyperior super effectively. Giga Drain is an option to bypass Quagsire, Swampert, and Rotom-W, which can otherwise tank various hits, though it generally doesn't provide too valuable of coverage otherwise. Beast Boost lets Celesteela boost its Special Attack upon netting KOs, giving it great sweeping potential. If Meteor Beam is not being run, Celesteela has no need for Power Herb and can then run Weakness Policy. This allows it to use its solid bulk to tank super effective hits, such as Fire-type moves from Salamence or opposing Celesteela, to gain a +2 boost in power, which heavily increases its threat level.</p> <p>This set fits on offensive builds, acting as a late-game sweeper that cleans weakened teams. On hyper offense teams, leads like Excadrill and Scolipede can provide entry hazards to wear down checks like Rotom-W and Slowking. Powerful wallbreakers like Azumarill and Aegislash make strong teammates capable of removing foes such as Slowking and Chansey for Celesteela to sweep through late-game. Depending on the coverage it opts for, Celesteela will struggle to reliably break past various Pokemon. If it isn't running Meteor Beam, checks to Fire-types like the aformentioned Azumarill and Gyarados are great teammates, easily being able to pressure Rotom-H and Moltres. Without Flash Cannon, Celesteela can't hit Rock-types like Rhyperior and Nihilego super effectively, making Pokemon like Zygarde-10% and Mamoswine solid partners. Lastly, secondary sweepers like Thundurus-T and Nihilego often fit well with offensive Celesteela, helping pressure and overwhelm the likes of Chansey and Slowking.</p> "

Boomburst 2HKOes Ground-types like Gastrodon and Nidoking and OHKOes Krookodile. Drain Punch allows Toxtricity to defeat its greatest counter in Chansey by healing enough to offset Seismic Toss damage. Drain Punch is also useful to pick off weakened foes and keep Toxtricity healthy. Life Orb gives Toxtricity the immediate damage it needs to secure 2HKOs on specially defensive Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth after entry hazard damage. A Rash nature is preferred to secure 2HKOs on the aforementioned Grass-types, but a Naive nature can be used to outspeed fast Choice Scarf users such as Jirachi and Mienshao.</p> <p>Shift Gear turns Toxtricity into a terrifying late-game sweeper that fits best on hyper offense archetypes. Toxtricity appreciates help from wallbreakers such as Keldeo and Aegislash taking care of threats such as Rhyperior and Chansey to help it sweep late-game. Additionally, entry hazard setters such as Krookodile and Excadrill help to accumulate chip damage on its checks, allowing Toxtricity to secure KOs on Swampert, Hydreigon, and Necrozma. Dragon Dance Salamence appreciates Toxtricity's ability to break through Celesteela and Tangrowth and can sweep late-game once its checks are dealt with. In return it can switch into Ground-type attacks. Priority moves like Azumarill's Aqua Jet can heavily damage Toxtricity or halt a sweep, making Gyarados and Rotom-W useful to have alongside Toxtricity. Jirachi resists Psychic and has U-turn to get Toxtricity safely into battle on a forced switch and preserve its HP, which is valuable due to Life Orb recoil. Jirachi can also provide Healing Wish support to give Toxtricity another chance to clean.</p> "

  "Hatterene": {
    "overview": "<p>Hatterene is an imposing Calm Mind user for defensive teams to deal with because its ability Magic Bounce deflects status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave, as well as phazing attempts. Hatterene's STAB moves complement each other brilliantly and, alongside Mystical Fire, give it good matchups against entry hazard setters such as Swampert and Skarmory to block their hazards with Magic Bounce and keep pressure off of its teammates. Hatterene's typing, while offensively potent, makes it a Fairy-type that's hit neutrally by Dark-type moves and a Psychic-type weak to Poison. This greatly impedes Hatterene's ability to consistently handle Pokemon such as Galarian Moltres and Hydreigon and makes it unreliable at pressuring Tentacruel and Nihilego. It also struggles to beat Steel-types such as Jirachi and Celesteela if it does not catch them with Mystical Fire on the switch. Without a Calm Mind boost, Hatterene noticeably lacks offensive presence, which can be taken advantage of by wallbreakers such as Diggersby and Choice Specs Primarina. While it does have some good matchups against some hazard setters, it also has poor ones, such as against Jirachi and Nidoqueen, so it can require prediction to make the most out of Magic Bounce. Excadrill is a hazard setter that not only forces out Hatterene but can completely ignore Magic Bounce thanks to Mold Breaker. Hatterene's dismal Speed tier greatly limits what it can accomplish against offensive teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On Trick Room teams, Hatterene is an effective suicide lead with Focus Sash and Misty Explosion. Magic Bounce denies entry hazards from everything bar Excadrill, and using Misty Explosion right after Trick Room gives a safe entry point for teammates such as Crawdaunt with three turns of Trick Room still remaining. Hatterene can also be an offensive threat in Trick Room with Life Orb, but this sacrifices a lot of consistency in defensive utility because of its need for Special Attack investment and Life Orb recoil. Assault Vest alongside Nuzzle is an option to make Hatterene more bulky without a boost while still crippling the likes of Aegislash and Jirachi, but it faces stiff competition from Reuniclus, which has more consistent healing with Regenerator and better bulk to handle threats such as Keldeo.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Hatterene's poor Speed, lack of consistent recovery, and reliance on a Calm Mind boost to be a consistent threat makes it easy for Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Diggersby, and Crawdaunt to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Jirachi takes little damage from Hatterene's STAB moves and threatens it back with Iron Head, though it dislikes Mystical Fire. Aegislash is an especially detrimental offensive threat, because even if it takes Mystical Fire on the switch a weakened Shadow Ball still threatens substantial damage; the Swords Dance set can take a Mystical Fire and obliterate Hatterene with a STAB move. Celesteela does not take too much damage from Mystical Fire due to its massive special bulk, and it 2HKOes with Heavy Slam.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Hatterene has plenty of opportunities to gain a Calm Mind boost against various Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Hydreigon, though it does have to be wary of Flash Cannon from the latter. Calm Mind notably helps Hatterene stomach hits from strong attackers such as Choice Specs Keldeo better and retaliate with Draining Kiss. Draining Kiss is mandatory as a powerful recovery tool and is instrumental against Chansey; after three boosts, Draining Kiss + Leftovers will outheal Seismic Toss's damage. Psyshock is useful against opposing Calm Mind users, most notably Primarina, as well as a more immediate weapon against Chansey. Psychic is an alternative option because it OHKOes Amoonguss after one Calm Mind boost instead of two. It also helps Hatterene pressure Quagsire better with Special Defense drops. Mystical Fire is vital to deter Steel-types looking to come in on a Calm Mind or STAB move like Celesteela, Jirachi, and Aegislash. Leftovers augments the recovery from Draining Kiss and makes Hatterene harder for Pokemon such as Suicune to wear down. Hatterene needs 12 EVs in Speed to outrun Amoonguss and 56 EVs to outspeed Quagsire and help against stall, though Psychic is required for the latter Pokemon.</p> <p>Hatterene fits well on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its Magic Bounce relieving entry hazard pressure from Skarmory. Pokemon that handle hazard setters Hatterene cannot switch into well like Nidoqueen, Jirachi, and Nihilego are appreciated. Chansey and Celesteela are able to check them. Celesteela can also pivot into Excadrill. Hazard support from teammates such as Krookodile and Chansey wears down Hatterene checks such as Aegislash and Celesteela. Fire-types can blow through Steel-types that Hatterene has issues with; Rotom-H and Moltres are notably able to check Aegislash and take advantage of Celesteela. Amoonguss and Skarmory can act as secondary pivots into Mienshao and Conkeldurr as repeatedly taking hits from them and losing its Leftovers greatly diminishes its ability to clean with Calm Mind.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Obstagoon is the only Guts user with STAB Facade, allowing it to pressure physical walls such as Amoonguss with ease. Its solid bulk, decent Speed, and access to STAB Knock Off make it a unique offensive threat, being able to take out metagame staples like Rotom-W, Galarian Moltres, and most notably SubToxic Aegislash, who cannot touch Obstagoon due to its typing and status immunity. It also has an excellent matchup against slower bulkier teams because of its status immunity, ability to heal off chip damage with Rest, and high damage output with STAB Knock Off. Due to its poor defensive typing, Obstagoon is easily revenge killed by common threats like Thundurus-T and Lycanroc-D. The abundance of Fighting-types like Buzzwole, Keldeo, and Kommo-o is especially problematic for Obstagoon due to its 4x weakness to fighting moves. Also, it tends to have poorer matchups against hyper offense, as teams pack more faster threats that give Obstagoon few opportunities to wallbreak, although it still can potentially pick up a KO or two. Obstagoon hates Knock Off as it cannot activate Guts without its Flame Orb, severly limiting its threat level. Its overreliance on Sleep Talk isn't ideal, as it relies on RNG to click the correct move. Obstagoon is generally outclassed by other offensive Dark-types like Krookodile and Zarude due to their better defensive utility and less reliance on their item.</p> ",

Parting Shot allows it to pivot on switch-ins such as Buzzwole.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types Moves: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Mienshao can outspeed Obstagoon and KO it with ease with their STAB moves.

Tangrowth can wear down Obstagoon with Rocky Helmet chip, forcing it to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Obstagoon puts itself on a timer as soon as it activates Flame Orb, so it can prematurely faint after a strong neutral hit.

Its high Speed enables it to outspeed common Pokemon such as Nihilego, Thundurus-T, and Excadrill, and its good bulk and defensive typing lets it check many dangerous threats such as Rotom-W, Slowking, and Hippowdon, while also discouraging Zygarde-10% from spamming Thousand Arrows. The ability to heal status conditions and HP with Jungle Healing can allow Zarude to consistently pivot around defensive Pokemon such as Swampert and Hippowdon. Zarude's ability to synergize with other common pivots like Thundurus-T, Slowking, and Moltres has made it one of the defining components of offensive teams. However, it often struggles to break defensive Pokemon, such as Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Salamence, due to them resisting Power Whip and taking minimal damage from Darkest Lariat. Many teams naturally fit multiple Grass-type resistant Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Cobalion, and Moltres, leaving Zarude with limited opportunities to use its strongest STAB attack. If it is running Choice Scarf, Zarude can risk being locked into an undesirable move, losing momentum.
