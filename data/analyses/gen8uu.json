    "overview": "<p>Venusaur is a phenomenal sun sweeper in UU. Venusaur's defensive typing lets it set up on many common Pokemon like Tangrowth, Swampert, and Rotom-W, allowing it to clean teams with its Growth boots. With moves like Giga Drain for reliable recovery, a powerful 100-Base Power and sun-boosted Weather Ball, and Sludge Bomb or Earth Power, Venusaur is able to punch holes in many teams, as with a boost it 2HKOes nearly every Pokemon in the tier barring Chansey. With a Modest nature, it outspeeds every relevant Pokemon in the tier under sun. However, Venusaur is severely limited if sun is no longer active, being outsped and KOed by plenty of Pokemon like Salamence and Azelf or used as setup bait for Pokemon like Scizor. Without a boost, Venusaur can sometimes be too weak to sweep, as common Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres are able to survive an unboosted hit and OHKO it back. Lastly, priority users such as Zygarde-10%, Scizor, and Mamoswine can pick off a weakened Venusaur. The inconsistency of sun teams because of Hippowdon limits the prominence of Venusaur in the metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Knock Off can be used to remove Chansey's Eviolite while also nailing Nihilego and Chandelure, but generally Venusaur benefits much more from its other moves; it can OHKO Nihilego and Chandelure with Earth Power, and after enough boosts from Growth it can damage Chansey with Giga Drain and outheal the damage done by Seismic Toss. Venusaur can run a defensive set with Leech Seed to blank Amoonguss and check Primarina, but generally Amoonguss is the better option thanks to Spore and Regenerator.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage: If Venusaur chooses to not run Earth Power, Chandelure can stomach any of Venusaur's hits at +2 and take it out with a Fire-type attack. Rotom-H and Moltres are can take an unboosted Sludge Bomb from Venusaur and KO it back with their Fire-type attacks. Threats who commonly carry Fire-type coverage like Salamence, Hydreigon, and Nidoqueen can take an unboosted hit and KO Venusaur in return.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Special walls such as Chansey, Umbreon, and Mandibuzz can take any of Venusaur's hits and stall out sun turns with their recovery moves, with the former wearing it down with Seismic Toss and the latter two being able to hit Venusaur hard with Foul Play due to Growth's attack boosts. However, Venusaur can outdamage Seismic Toss's damage with Giga Drain if it manages to accumulate enough boosts. Nihilego can take on an unboosted Venusaur but loses if it boosts on the switch-in. Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro can take a +2 hit and KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Zygarde-10%, Lycanroc-D, Scizor, and Mamoswine can revenge kill Venusaur using their priority moves if Venusaur is worn down, which can happen due to Venusaur sometimes having to take a hit to set up Growth while also dealing with Life Orb recoil.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Growth is a powerful setup move under sun, boosting Venusaur's Special Attack by 2 stages and allowing it to 2HKO nearly all the Pokemon in the tier. It can set up on popular Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Swampert, and Amoonguss due to its typing, and then sweep through opposing teams. Giga Drain hits Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Primarina, Hippowdon, and Lycanroc-D super effectively. Weather Ball is Venusaur's main attacking move under sun, as its Base Power becomes 100 and is boosted by the sun, KOing Steel-types that resist Giga Drain like Celesteela, Scizor, Skarmory, and Jirachi. Sludge Bomb hits Pokemon that resist Giga Drain and Weather Ball like Salamence, Hydreigon, and Rotom-H while also hitting Fairy-types like Hatterene super effectively, though it will need a boost to OHKO the former two. Earth Power is an alternative option to hit Tentacruel, Chandelure, and Nihilego harder, but this leaves Venusaur susceptible to Salamence, as Giga Drain and Weather Ball are mandatory moves. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed ensures Venusaur is as strong and fast as possible. A Modest nature is used to maximize damage output while still nearly outspeeding everything under the sun. Life Orb is used to boost Venusaur's damage output, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Salamence, and Moltres after a boost, while a boost to Giga Drain gives Venusaur insane damage output and reliable recovery, making it a powerful force.</p> <p>Venusaur only fits on sun teams, so Torkoal is a mandatory partner, as it is the most reliable sun setter in the tier. It provides the team with entry hazard support and entry hazard control with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, respectively. Other Pokemon that take advantage of sun like Chandelure, Darmanitan, and Hatterene break holes in enemy teams thanks to their powerful wallbreaking capabilities amplified by sun, allowing Venusaur to sweep much more easily. Hatterene in particular checks Hydreigon and discourages entry hazards from being set so Torkoal can come in more, allowing Venusaur to sweep more easily. Venusaur also appreciates momentum such as Teleport from Chansey and Flip Turn from Swampert to help it get in safely as well as give it more opportunities to set up; for example Chansey can bring Venusaur in on physical attackers like Scizor and Azumarill, which are forced out by it under sun.</p> "

However, Nidoqueen can struggle to pivot into Electric-types like Raikou and Thundurus-T that commonly carry super-effective coverage to break through it. Unfortunately, Nidoqueen's overreliance on its Life Orb leaves it susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would pivot into like Nihilego. A low Speed stat gives Nidoqueen an undesirable matchup versus faster-paced teams, and although Nidoqueen sports a quality defensive typing, it is still weak to common Pokemon in the tier such as Mamoswine and Keldeo. These struggles sting a bit more because Nidoqueen has no form of reliable recovery, meaning it is worn down pretty quickly throughout a match.

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its excellent offensive typing, ability in Sheer Force, powerful STAB moves like Sludge Wave and Earth Power, and excellent coverage moves like Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt, Nidoking is a very powerful wallbreaker. It can hit a large portion of the tier for super effective damage, pressuring plenty of Pokemon like Skarmory, Primarina, and Amoonguss. Even though Nidoking is one of the most dangerous threats in the tier, its mediocre Speed tier and bulk mean it can't find many opportunities to wallbreak, mandating pivot support to get it onto the field safely. Nidoking also relies on its Life Orb to do massive damage, so it despises Knock Off from the likes of Nihilego and Thundurus-T. Its typing also doesn't benefit it much defensively, leaving it weak to common attacking types like Ground, Water, and Psychic from Pokemon like Excadrill, Azumarill, and Azelf. Furthermore, despite being a Ground-type, Nidoking doesn't provide a functional Electric immunity for its team, being outsped by Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Thundurus-T and getting hit hard by their other moves. This lack of defensive utility makes it hard to justify over other Pokemon that share its Ground or Poison typing like Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Nihilego.

Sucker Punch is an option to pick off the likes of Jirachi and Azelf as well as other revenge killers like Lycanroc-D, but forgoing coverage or added utility isn't great for Nidoking.

Articuno also provides these teams a key switch-in to Primarina, which they struggle to fit when using Zarude as their Grass-type. Articuno can optionally run Heal Bell instead of U-turn on these structures to reliably Defog against Hippowdon and support teammates such as Scizor, letting it be more aggressive with switching into Slowking's Scald and attacking Moltres, but losing U-turn leaves Articuno much more passive.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Due to its low power and lack of coverage, Articuno can be setup fodder for Steel-types such as Scizor and Cobalion. In addition to this, Steel-types such as Cobalion, Excadrill, and Jirachi are Stealth Rock setters Articuno cannot beat. Celesteela takes little damage from Freeze-Dry despite not resisting it and can pressure Articuno heavily, and Iron Defense Skarmory can boost up against and beat Articuno to keep Spikes up. Skarmory must, however, be wary of Freeze-Dry damage due to its poor Special Defense, and non-Iron Defense variants are unable to keep Spikes up versus Articuno, since they can't threaten it enough with Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Nihilego: Nihilego can shrug off any damage Articuno can throw at it with its massive special bulk, reliably keeping Stealth Rock up against it, while forcing Articuno out with its Rock-type STAB moves. Nihilego can use the multiple free turns Articuno gives it to either debilitate key teammates with Knock Off + coverage or set up with Meteor Beam.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Stealth Rock</strong>: Articuno's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock leaves it uncomfortable against Krookodile, which can remove its Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and potentially stop it from Defogging with Taunt and good prediction, but it must be wary of Freeze-Dry. Pokemon like Azelf and Tangrowth that Articuno can usually check are able to force it out with Knock Off if they are paired with an entry hazard setter that Articuno's team cannot beat.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Thundurus-T cannot switch into Articuno safely, given its Ice weakness, but can threaten Articuno with its Electric-type moves and Knock Off.

Its 10% freeze chance is low at face value, but adds up over a long game versus threats like Scizor, which commonly switch into it, due to its high PP. Defog alongside Pressure lets Articuno beat entry hazard setters like Hippowdon and Chansey one-on-one, and even against teams with other setters, its defensive profile lets it Defog on Pokemon like Primarina and Amoonguss. With Heal Bell and Pressure, Articuno can safely PP stall any one Pokemon's Toxic while offering key cleric support to teammates, opening up superior move options on teammates such as Toxic on Umbreon and Stealth Rock on Chansey. 56 Speed EVs let Articuno outspeed Choice Specs Primarina, and high Special Defense investment with a Calm nature helps it check Pokemon such as Primarina and Salamence. Articuno can opt to run 204 Defense EVs instead with a Bold nature to improve its matchup versus Dragon Dance Gyarados and Salamence, but this should only be done on teams without Umbreon to handle them, as it lowers Articuno's ability to switch into Defog Salamence as reliably.</p> <p>Articuno fits primarily on semi-stall and stall teams that appreciate a Defogger that beats Hippowdon solo while compressing Heal Bell support. Skarmory is a fantastic fit alongside it, checking Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Swords Dance Scizor with Iron Defense. Skarmory values Articuno letting it run Spikes over Defog, as well as bleeding the PP of Defog users such as Salamence and Mandibuzz, helping its Spikes stay up more easily. Defensive wallbreakers such as Taunt Jellicent, Hex Chandelure, and Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro appreciate Articuno enabling Spikes Skarmory, helping them break through opposing teams. Jellicent, in particular, provides key defensive value as a check to threats such as Keldeo, Cobalion, and Scizor, and it appreciates Articuno clearing it of status it may pick up from Pokemon like Skarmory and Amoonguss, while Galarian Slowbro can double up as a late-game wincon and appreciates Articuno checking Hippowdon. On full stall teams, secondary Defog users such as Skarmory and Flygon cover entry hazard setters Articuno cannot beat. Iron Defense Skarmory can help beat Excadrill and opposing Skarmory, while Flygon can counter Nihilego and beat pivot Thundurus-T and opposing Skarmory. Primary special walls such as Umbreon and Chansey are important to check threats such as Moltres and Chandelure and not have Articuno overwhelmed by Salamence and Primarina. Umbreon can offer Wish support to Articuno and check threats such as Swords Dance + Knock Off Scizor, while Chansey can provide a Stealth Rock setter. Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Quagsire can check Pokemon such as non-Grass Knot Thundurus-T and Nihilego, and Rotom-H for Articuno. Hippowdon can also provide Stealth Rock support and a Hatterene answer with its Rocky Helmet sets, while Quagsire can reliably counter Pokemon like Swords Dance Cobalion and Scizor and Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro.</p> "

Flame Body makes Moltres great at punishing the many U-turn users of the tier, including Scizor, Crobat, Zarude, and Diggersby. Moltres can also function as a solid support Pokemon with its Mystical Fire + Toxic set, wearing down Pokemon like Slowking, Hippowdon, and Rotom-W to support teammates like Mamoswine. Heavy-Duty Boots greatly improves Moltres's efficiency at its roles, but it is extremely reliant on them, making it very susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would normally check like Mamoswine, Tangrowth, and especially Scizor. Teams with Moltres often have to run entry hazard removal so that Moltres can properly check these threats. Moltres can also be taken advanatage of by pivots it checks like Scizor, Crobat, and Diggersby to bring in threats like Nihilego, Primarina, and Keldeo if it does not proc the Flame Body burn. Salamence gives Moltres heavy competition because of its better typing, Intimidate, and greater resilience to Knock Off.</p> ",

A Substitute + Toxic set with an EV spread of 152 HP / 132 SpD / 224 Spe, a Timid nature, and Pressure can be used to cripple and PP stall many of Moltres's counters, such as Hippowdon, Rotom-H, and Rotom-W, but it makes Moltres very passive in general. Scorching Sands threatens Nihilego for massive damage, but that's it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Knock Off and Stealth Rock: Moltres becomes extremely vulnerable to Stealth Rock upon losing its Heavy-Duty Boots.

The former two do fear getting burned by Flame Body, however.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types and Rock-type Coverage: Nihilego and Rhyperior can easily tank Moltres's STAB moves and blow it away with massive damage, though the latter does have to be wary of Toxic. Lycanroc-D outspeeds and OHKOes Moltres with Stone Edge. Cobalion, a Pokemon that Moltres is supposed to check, often carries Stone Edge, making it hard for Moltres to switch into. Pokemon that Moltres can normally check, such as Excadrill and Tapu Bulu, may sometimes carry Rock-type coverage moves, forcing Moltres to scout these attacks.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Raikou, and Thundurus-T can easily take advantage of Moltres with Volt Switch.

  "Crobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Crobat acts as a fast offensive pivot thanks to its incredible natural Speed, allowing it to outspeed fast offensive Pokemon like Azelf, Zygarde-10%, Keldeo, and Noivern. Crobat can make use of its high Speed and offensive pivoting with STAB Brave Bird and U-turn to outlast checks such as Nihilego and Rotom-W, making it threatening to many common team styles. Taunt prevents would-be checks like Salamence, Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Chansey from recovering while also preventing the latter two and Amoonguss from using status moves. While Crobat's Poison / Flying typing allows it to switch in on Grass- and Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Zarude, Amoonguss, and Conkeldurr, it must beware switching directly into a status move like Stun Spore or Spore from Amoonguss, or strong attacks like Darkest Lariat from Zarude and Knock Off and Facade from Conkeldurr. Furthermore, Crobat's average bulk makes it struggle to switch in on strong attacks from offensive Pokemon like Hydreigon, Azelf, and Zygarde-10%. Crobat's lack of relevant resistances also makes it fear moves from Pokemon it would otherwise check, such as Facade from Conkeldurr and Hydro Pump from Keldeo. Lastly, Crobat is dependent on Heavy-Duty Boots to be effective, forcing it to play carefully against Knock Off users like Diggersby and Scizor. This flaw also forces Crobat to think twice about switching into Knock Off users it would otherwise counter like Tangrowth.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Inflitrator can be used instead of Inner Focus to allow Crobat to bypass Substitute, preventing Pokemon like SubCM Keldeo and Primarina from getting a safe hit on Crobat from behind a Substitute. Defog can be used over Taunt to make Crobat an entry hazard remover. However, foregoing Taunt limits Crobat's offensive potency and stops it from keeping Stealth Rock off the field against some common setters, like Cobalion, Hippowdon, and Nihilego. Hypnosis can be used in the final moveslot to cripple switch-ins, although it suffers from low accuracy and opportunity cost in not using the more reliable Taunt. A set of Nasty Plot, Sludge Bomb, Heat Wave, and Roost can be used to break through Crobat's usual Steel-type checks, and it provides excellent Fire / Poison coverage against most of the UU tier. This set is particularly effective against bulkier teams due to the aforementioned coverage, Crobat's reliable recovery, and its Toxic immunity. However, this set can be hard to justify over Crobat's usual utility. In addition, Crobat's base Special Attack is low, so this set usually requires multiple Nasty Plot uses to break through its targets. Finally, Super Fang could be used over U-turn and alongside Taunt to weaken sturdy Crobat checks like Celesteela for its teammates. This turns Crobat into a dangerous stallbreaker.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types like Celesteela, Skarmory, and Jirachi take very little damage from Brave Bird and can hinder Crobat. Skarmory can lose one-on-one against Crobat due to Taunt preventing it from healing with Roost, but it would still damage Crobat significantly in the process, especially if Skarmory is holding a Rocky Helmet. Cobalion does not resist Brave Bird, but it's never 2HKOed thanks to its great physical bulk, and it can threaten Crobat with Stone Edge or Volt Switch and chip it with Rocky Helmet as well. Scizor also does not resist Brave Bird and does not like switching into it, but it can revenge kill a weakened Crobat with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Crobat's reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots makes Knock Off a giant threat to its longevity, making it dangerous to switch into Pokemon like Tangrowth and Krookodile, which would otherwise be less threatening.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Raikou, Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H resist Crobat's Brave Bird and threaten heavy damage or OHKOs on it. They can be worn down over time with repeated hits, however, and are not safe switch-ins at low HP.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types like Nihilego, Lycanroc-D, and Rhyperior resist Brave Bird and threaten heavy damage on Crobat. Rhyperior in particular stonewalls Crobat. While Lycanroc-D and especially Nihilego take more damage from Brave Bird and must be more careful about switching into Crobat, they can survive a hit from it and revenge kill in return. Lycanroc-D also has priority Accelerock to prevent Crobat from hitting it first.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Hippowdon and Swampert can take repeated hits from Crobat without fearing a KO. Swampert can use Flip Turn to pivot into a Pokemon that can threaten Crobat, while Hippowdon mandates Taunt use with Slack Off and forces sand chip damage. Both can also hit Crobat with a super effective Earthquake if it is forced to use Roost, and Hippowdon can potentially punish Brave Bird and U-turn with Rocky Helmet. Hippowdon will usually fail to beat Taunt Crobat one-on-one, but Rocky Helmet and sand can significantly chip Crobat in the process.

U-turn also wears down switch-ins and offensive checks like Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, Raikou, and Nihilego, allowing Crobat to beat them long-term. Roost keeps Crobat healthy, allowing it to last in long games, beat bulky threats like defensive Salamence and Chansey one-on-one, and utilize its typing to switch into Zarude. Roost can also be used to remove Crobat's Flying typing for a turn, reducing its damage from moves like Volt Switch from Rotom-W and Rotom-H and Stone Edge from Cobalion. Roost also helps compensate for the recoil damage Crobat takes from using Brave Bird. Taunt lets Crobat shut down status moves from Pokemon like Amoonguss and Chansey, as well as healing attempts from Pokemon like Salamence and Skarmory. Even if Crobat itself does not fear Toxic from Pokemon like Chansey and Hippowdon, its teammates may appreciate Taunt shutting down the threat of Toxic after they switch in. Taunt can also prevent Defog attempts from Pokemon like Salamence and Mandibuzz.

Azumarill also has decent natural bulk and a great defensive typing, which allows it to blanket check threats such as Hydreigon and Salamence. Unfortunately, Azumarill is quite slow, so it is easily forced out by faster Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Thundurus-T when it is not boosted with Belly Drum.

While unable to pressure some defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Celesteela, and Teleport Chansey at all, Umbreon can freely use them to pass Wish, and Foul Play + Toxic greatly punishes many offensive checks switching in and prevents Umbreon from being too passive. However, it can offer a lot of opportunities to dangerous Fairy- and Fighting-types like Primarina, Cobalion, and Conkeldurr that can greatly threaten bulkier teams. Umbreon also struggles versus some of the stronger special attackers in the tier like Thundurus-T and Meteor Beam Nihilego, and chip damage can bring it into 2HKO range of Pokemon it checks like Mamoswine and Nidoking.</p> ",

This, however, makes Umbreon unable to check Mamoswine and more damaged by Pokemon like Excadrill and Dragon Dance Gyarados. Heal Bell is an option that lets Umbreon clear status from itself and its teammates. However, dropping Toxic for it makes Umbreon noticeably more passive and invites offensive Pokemon in, giving it far fewer opportunities to safely pass Wish. Therefore, it should only be used on teams with absolutely no better options against status.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types like Cobalion, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr are some of the biggest threats to Umbreon. Conkeldurr can be deterred by Umbreon stalling for burn damage, but Drain Punch variants can easily regain their HP versus Umbreon's teammates, forming a long-term threat. Cobalion's Toxic immunity and ability in Justified let it safely switch into Umbreon as well.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Defensive Primarina variants can easily wall Umbreon and sponge Toxic while pressuring its teammates. For non-defensive sets, Umbreon can outspeed and poison Substitute + Calm Mind variants or scout Choice Specs variants, but the former sets up for free if not immediately poisoned, and the latter poses a serious threat to Umbreon's teammates. Hatterene can easily set up on Umbreon, bouncing back Toxic. While Togekiss cannot beat Umbreon without Heal Bell due to Inner Focus, Heal Bell + Nasty Plot variants can set up provided they have enough Heal Bell PP remaining.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Crawdaunt is a huge threat to Umbreon thanks to its titanic damage output and resistance to Foul Play. Zarude's resistance to Foul Play and ability to sponge Toxic with Jungle Healing make it a great pivot into Umbreon; however, it cannot easily beat Umbreon itself unless Umbreon has wasted a lot of PP, and Zarude must be careful to not waste too much Jungle Healing PP if it needs check a teammate like Slowking. Choice Specs Hydreigon can easily overwhelm Umbreon if it switches into Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Nidoking can easily get the edge versus Umbreon if it has been chipped by entry hazards, lost its Leftovers to Knock Off from a Pokemon like Nihilego or Mamoswine itself, or statused. While Umbreon still avoids being 2HKOed by Life Orb Mamoswine without its Leftovers, Stealth Rock makes the 2HKO decently likely.

Due to its incredible bulk and typing, Slowking can easily come in on threats like Keldeo, Cobalion, Celesteela, Excadrill, and Nihilego and then pivot to a revenge killer with Teleport. However, as a result of its somewhat below average physical defense, Slowking is unable to consistently wall strong physical attackers such as Conkeldurr and Swords Dance Excadrill. Slowking also gets forced out by threats such as Zarude, Hydreigon, and Thundurus-T quite easily due to its initial passivity and can get overwhelmed by status from Pokemon it checks like Toxic from Moltres and Sludge Bomb poisons from Nihilego. Slowking's typing also holds it back, as it is weak to U-turn as well as Knock Off. Slowking competes with Chansey for the role of a defensive pivot, as Chansey isn't weak to foes such as Hydreigon.

However, running it instead of Psyshic STAB leaves Slowking vulnerable to Primarina and Conkeldurr. Running Thunder Wave over Teleport is also fine, as long as the team has enough pivot support. This can open some doors for teammates like Conkeldurr and SubToxic Jirachi, as Conkeldurr is faster than paralyzed Hydreigon and Zarude, and Jirachi outspeeds revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Choice Scarf Zarude if they are paralyzed.

With Pressure, Calm Mind, and its superb bulk, Suicune is able to stall out threatening walls such as Amoonguss, Chansey, and even Assault Vest Tangrowth if it gets burned by Scald, allowing it to take many unsuspecting teams by surprise if it gets a few free turns. However, Suicune is held back by the prevalence of Grass- and Electric-types that can limit it from boosting like Tangrowth, Thundurus-T, and Zarude, the latter of which can cure Scald burns with Jungle Healing and use Power Whip to break past it. Powerful wallbreakers like Keldeo and Choice Specs Hydreigon are able to force Suicune into using Rest before it sets up, limiting its offensive presence and exploiting its somewhat limited defensive value as a Water-type. Rest is also unreliable recovery, forcing Suicune to rely on Leftovers alongside Rest in order to regain HP. This makes Suicune susceptible to Knock Off, as losing Leftovers would require Suicune to use Rest more often, limiting its ability to face threats like Scizor. In addition, its overreliance on Sleep Talk isn't great either, as you rely on RNG to choose the ideal move. Suicune faces competition from Calm Mind Primarina, which sports an additional Fairy-typing to better threaten foes with neutral damage, but Suicune's ability to potentially turn Assault Vest Tangrowth into setup fodder is an important niche.</p> ",

Slowking also can provide Future Sight support to help Crawdaunt KO Pokemon like Salamence and Amoonguss that attempt to switch into it. Noivern, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Choice Scarf Diggersby can revenge kill faster threats like Cobalion, Zarude, and Raikou for Crawdaunt as well as bring it in against Hippowdon with U-turn. Scizor can bring in Crawdaunt with U-turn against threats like Celesteela as well as wear down Tangrowth and Salamence with Knock Off. It also answers Zarude. Entry hazard support is essential in wearing down bulky Pokemon due to Crawdaunt's inability to take a hit if it fails to KO its target. Nidoqueen and Hippowdon can provide Stealth Rock support for Crawdaunt, with the former checking foes like Thundurus-T and Hydreigon and the latter threatening Grass- and Fairy-types like Tangrowth, Tapu Bulu, and Primarina. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon like Tentacruel and Salamence keep Crawdaunt from being worn down by entry hazards, boosting its longevity. Defensive Grass-types like Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth can defensively answer revenge killers to Crawdaunt like Primarina, Thundurus-T, and Keldeo. Pokemon that can spread paralysis such as Nihilego and Togekiss can help Crawdaunt bypass its low Speed. Late-game cleaners like Zygarde-10% and Swords Dance Cobalion appreciate Crawdaunt's wallbreaking and can finish off weakened foes like Skarmory while also keeping faster threats like Hydreigon and Zarude in check throughout a game.</p> "

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<p>Salamence is a very versatile defensive and offensive presence. Its typing, natural bulk, and Intimidate allow it to check common threats such as Excadrill, Zarude, Scizor, and Conkeldurr. It's also a solid Defogger, matching up well against entry hazard setters such as Excadrill, Skarmory, and Cobalion. Salamence can utilize its solid Special Attack, decent Speed tier, and powerful moves like Hurricane and Draco Meteor as a strong special attacker, or it can sweep teams with Dragon Dance and Moxie. That, coupled with coverage in Flamethrower and Earthquake, makes Salamence difficult to predict and revenge kill. However, its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots means Salamence does not appreciate Knock Off from Pokemon it’s supposed to check, such as Tangrowth and Scizor. Bulky Fairy-types like Hatterene and Primarina can easily take a hit and KO Salamence, while many other threats like Keldeo, Gyarados, and Nidoking carry Ice-type coverage. Offensive threats such as Thundurus-T and Nihilego outspeed it, and Dragon Dance sets are also vulnerable to revenge killers with priority such as Mamoswine and Lycanroc-D. Salamence also faces fierce competition from Hydreigon; Hydreigon's higher Special Attack stat alongside Dark-type STAB moves lets it better deal with popular defensive stalwarts such as Slowking, and it has greater item versatility by virtue of its neutrality to Stealth Rock. However, Salamence has a far better matchup against Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Scizor, and it's able to outspeed and revenge kill opposing Hydreigon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An Intimidate Dragon Dance set using Roost over Outrage can work on Magneton teams to check problematic answers to Excadrill such as Zarude while remaining offensively potent, but this set fails to get past Hippowdon. Fire Blast over Flamethrower on the special attacking set gives Salamence more power against Steel-types like Celesteela; however, it is less reliable and the additional power is often unneeded. Lum Berry can give Salamence more room to set up on Pokemon like Swampert and Tangrowth, but it doesn't carry as much consistent utility as Life Orb. Choice Scarf alongside Moxie can give Salamence surprising sweeping potential, as it doesn't require a setup turn to outspeed targets such as Keldeo and revenge kills sweepers such as Gyarados. Choice Specs improves Salamence's wallbreaking ability and can lure Hippowdon in to nail it with Hydro Pump.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Pokemon such as Azumarill, Togekiss, Primarina, and Hatterene take advantage of Salamence's lack of coverage for them, having the bulk to take a hit and either set up or KO Salamence.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Without Draco Meteor, special Salamence struggles to relieve Stealth Rock pressure from Nihilego, though it must be wary of Earthquake. Lycanroc-D can OHKO offensive variants of Salamence with -1 Stone Edge after minimal chip damage and easily revenge kill it with Accelerock, though Lycanroc-D cannot switch into Salamence safely.</p> <p><strong>Walls: Pokemon like Chansey and Slowking can handle special Salamence with their massive special bulk and use it for momentum with Teleport. However, the two cannot reliably tank hits from Dragon Dance sets. Umbreon and Mandibuzz have the natural bulk to survive Salamence's special attacks and take advantage of Dragon Dance sets with Foul Play. Celesteela is an especially detrimental defensive threat because it completely walls Dragon Dance sets without Fire Blast. Hippowdon can take hits from both physical and special sets and cripple Defog Salamence with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Mamoswine: Mamoswine is the most consistent revenge killer against Salamence, as Ice Shard OHKOes any set.</p> ",

Hurricane 2HKOes Assault Vest Tangrowth and has a significant chance to OHKO Amoonguss after Stealth Rock. It also prevents Slowking from switching into Salamence. Defog can be used over either STAB move, though this sacrifices neutral coverage against Pokemon like Nihilego and Azumarill. Flamethrower is solid coverage against Pokemon such as Scizor and Skarmory and can finish off weakened targets such as Tangrowth and Conkeldurr without risking a Hurricane miss. Roost alongside Heavy-Duty Boots makes Salamence harder to wear down by threats like Scizor and Zarude. Intimidate makes Salamence a more reliable switch-in to threats such as Conkeldurr, Scizor, and Excadrill while making them easier to pivot around.</p> <p>This set fits on bulky offense and balance teams for its wallbreaking capabilities against Pokemon like Amoonguss and important defensive utility against other foes like Scizor. Swampert, Nidoqueen, and Excadrill are able to break through Salamence's checks like Nihilego, provide Stealth Rock support to soften up defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela, and capitalize on support against Tangrowth. Excadrill also pressures Hatterene and Togekiss and provides Rapid Spin support so Salamence can drop Defog. Scizor and Mamoswine takes advantage of Salamence removing potential roadblocks such as Amoonguss and Skarmory, and they threaten Stealth Rock setters Salamence has troubles against like Chansey and Nihilego. Zarude, Slowking, and Cobalion are effective pivots to safely bring Salamence into foes such as Hydreigon and Tangrowth. Slowking in particular provides slow pivoting with Teleport so Salamence can safely enter on Grass-types, as well as providing a stronger backbone against Conkeldurr with Colbur Berry. Rotom-W also acts as a pivot to bring Salamence in on Tangrowth and can check Mamoswine and Celesteela. Azelf can handle faster Pokemon such as Nihilego and Lycanroc-D.

Dual Wingbeat also has the benefit of hitting Keldeo through Substitute, though risking a burn from Scald is not ideal. Earthquake OHKOes Cobalion and Jirachi at +2. Fire Blast can be used instead to lure in and break through Skarmory and increase Salamence's chances for a Moxie sweep. Life Orb can be used to OHKO Pokemon such as bulky Moltres with +1 Outrage and Primarina with +2 Dual Wingbeat. It can also be used alongside a Naive nature to ensure that Fire Blast OHKOes Skarmory after Stealth Rock.

Moxie helps Salamence get multiple boosts to KO bulky targets like Hippowdon and makes it more difficult to revenge kill.</p> <p>This set fits on offense and hyper offense teams as a wallbreaker or late-game cleaner with Moxie. Excadrill is an excellent lead that sets Stealth Rock to wear down bulky Pokemon such as Rotom-W and provides Rapid Spin. Sticky Web from Ribombee lets Salamence outspeed foes such as Nihilego. Celesteela walls this set, so early-game wallbreakers such as Nasty Plot Thundurus-T and Azelf are decent options. They also appreciate Salamence's ability to threaten Chansey. Other teammates that overwhelm physically bulky Pokemon such as Quagsire and Skarmory, such as Gyarados and Autotomize Celesteela, are valuable assets to this set. They also heavily benefit Salamence by overwhelming checks like Amoonguss and Primarina. Pivots such as Diggersby and Zarude can position Salamence to set up on Pokemon like Tangrowth. Zarude also blanks Hippowdon and Rotom-W for Salamence. Mamoswine is a consistent revenge killer against Salamence, so teammates that take it on such as Slowking and Scizor are appreciated. Magneton is able to trap and remove Skarmory, Celesteela, and Scizor for Salamence. It also wipes out Primarina and Togekiss.</p> "

  "Registeel": {
    "overview": "<p>Registeel serves the purpose of a bulky ChestoRest + Double Dance sweeper, as its bulk, combined with its amazing Steel typing, gives it the edge in a multitude of matchups. It is able to set up on common UU staples such as Nihilego, Chansey, and Scizor and bait offensive threats that hit it super effectively, such as Zygarde-10%, Conkeldurr, and pivot Thundurus-T, using them as setup fodder to start a sweep. Because of its ability to boost its physical and special bulk, Registeel has multiple opportunities to set up and can potentially steamroll teams lacking a Ghost-type, Taunt, or certain sweepers that don't take much from Body Press. It also has a good amount of PP on Iron Defense, Amnesia, and Rest combined, so it is able to stall out defensive Pokemon like Slowking and Amoonguss. Registeel is also a solid defensive Stealth Rock setter for many teams, checking various offensive threats, including Nihilego, Zarude, and Starmie. It also has access to status in Thunder Wave and Toxic, which makes it less passive against offensive teams. However, while Registeel's defensive profile is phenomenal, its passivity leads to inviting common wallbreakers and setup sweepers in, like Keldeo and Nidoking. It also faces stiff competition as a Steel-type Stealth Rock setter from the likes of Excadrill and Cobalion, both of which have an actual offensive presence. Registeel faces competition as a defensive Steel-type from Skarmory and Scizor; both have reliable recovery and Skarmory can check Pokemon like Gyarados and Diggersby. Registeel also greatly fears Knock Off because of how reliant it is on its item to stay healthy throughout a game. It's also often forced to use Rest between boosting, which gives wallbreakers like Keldeo and Nidoking chances to fish for critical hits to KO it through its boosts.</p> ",

Iron Defense, in particular, makes Body Press's power skyrocket to exceptional levels. At +6, Registeel becomes incredibly powerful and is able to 2HKO even physically defensive Slowking with a favorable damage roll or minor chip damage. With Amnesia and Iron Defense, it is able to set up on multiple Pokemon, including Hippowdon, Salamence, and Tangrowth. This gives Registeel room to boost its unboosted stat as well. After a single Iron Defense, for example, Conkeldurr cannot 2HKO Registeel. Amnesia leaves Pokemon that would otherwise counter Registeel such as Moltres and Nidoking unable to 2HKO it, forcing them to fish for a critical hit in order to KO. Rest, along with Chesto Berry, allows Registeel to rid itself of status that would otherwise get in the way of a sweep.

Tapu Bulu also provides Grassy Terrain support to give it passive recovery and weaken Earthquake from Mamoswine and Diggersby. Nihilego is a solid partner for Registeel, as it removes common Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Hatterene and Togekiss, and provides Stealth Rock and Knock Off support that can aid in wearing down the opposition. It is also a reliable counter to Chandelure. Rotom-W threatens offensive Ground-types like Nidoking and Mamoswine, as well as Skarmory for Registeel. It can also provide valuable Defog support to clear the field of entry hazards. Calm Mind Hatterene is a good partner, due to countering Skarmory, which can KO Registeel after boosting alongside it with its own Body Press. It also prevents Skarmory from laying Spikes that would wear down Registeel a lot faster.

Serene Grace gives Iron Head a high chance to flinch slower foes like Hydreigon, making Choice Scarf Jirachi difficult to deal with for unprepared offensive teams. Additionally, Jirachi's above average bulk and great defensive typing allow it to check threats like Nihilego and Hatterene. Jirachi can fulfill a wide variety of roles on teams, whether it's revenge killing threats like Azelf with Choice Scarf, serving as a potent progress maker with its SubToxic set that can get through typical checks such as Amoonguss and Hippowdon, or healing its team with Wish. However, Jirachi's reliance on Leftovers for checking Pokemon like Salamence and Hatterene makes it susceptible to Knock Off from Nihilego and Tangrowth. Jirachi has only average offensive stats, making it very reliant on Iron Head flinches to make progress against foes it lacks coverage for, with common defensive staples like Skarmory, Excadrill, and Amoonguss walling it regardless. Jirachi, while jack of all trades, is master of none, and faces competition from Pokemon like Hydreigon as a revenge killer, Cobalion as a Steel-type Stealth Rock setter, and Umbreon as a Wish user, making its roles more specific.</p> ",

It can also run Healing Wish on this set to give sweepers like Calm Mind Keldeo another shot in the game. However, this set is quite passive and invites many threatening foes like Cobalion, Scizor, and Hippowdon in for free. Hippowdon, Nihilego, and Cobalion are often preferred as Stealth Rock setters instead due to their better matchups against common removers as well as the broader metagame. Jirachi can utilize a special attacker set with Meteor Beam to lure in and remove common switch-ins like Moltres and Rotom-H. However, this set struggles to cover everything. Jirachi can use Calm Mind sets to sweep on hyper offense teams, but these also struggle to choose their coverage. Jirachi can utilize a mixed set, which can notably KO Amoonguss with Psychic while nailing Hatterene with Iron Head, but it lacks in power compared to other offensive Psychic-types like Azelf. Jirachi can run Stored Power sets with Calm Mind and Weakness Policy to accumulate many boosts and sweep, but these sets struggle to get past Swords Dance Scizor and defensive Celesteela and can be ineffective without many boosts.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure take very little from Jirachi's attacks and can force it out with their powerful STAB attacks. Jirachi especially dislikes a burn from Moltres's Flame Body. However, none of them like Jirachi using Trick to remove their Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Celesteela takes very little from Jirachi's attacks and can wear it down with Leech Seed + Flamethrower. Scizor walls Jirachi without Fire Punch and can use it as setup fodder or force it out. Excadrill also walls Jirachi and can devastate it with Earthquake. Cobalion and Skarmory can set entry hazards in front of Jirachi and chip it with Rocky Helmet recoil, though they dislike Trick.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Bulky Water-types like Rotom-W, Slowking, and Swampert take very little from Jirachi's attacks and can cripple it or decently damage it. However, they hate taking a Toxic from the SubToxic set. Offensive Water-types like Keldeo and Crawdaunt pressure Jirachi hard.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types like Zarude, Krookodile, and Hydreigon offensively threaten Jirachi and force it out. Zarude and Choice Scarf Hydreigon can revenge kill non-Choice Scarf Jirachi, with Choice Scarf Zarude outspeeding Choice Scarf variants as well. Mandibuzz and Umbreon don't mind Iron Head much and can wear it down with Foul Play. The latter also uses Inner Focus to block flinches and freely pass Wish to its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Pokemon carrying Knock Off like Tangrowth and Azelf can remove Leftovers to cripple defensive Jirachi, especially sets without Wish. Choice Scarf Jirachi becomes a much worse revenge killer without its item and can struggle to use Trick and Healing Wish effectively.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage and Status: Due to Jirachi lacking reliable one-turn recovery, it is prone to getting worn down by entry hazards like Spikes as well as Rocky Helmet users like Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Jirachi also hates burns and paralysis from Pokemon like Moltres and Chansey, with paralysis making it hard to outspeed threats like Excadrill and leverage U-turn.</p> ",

U-turn gets momentum against switch-ins like Skarmory and Excadrill as well as Pokemon it may not have coverage for like Gyarados and Thundurus-T. Trick lets Jirachi cripple Scizor and defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Slowking, but losing Choice Scarf compromises Jirachi's ability to revenge kill Pokemon like Azelf and Zarude, so it should be used wisely. Ice Punch is an option to nail Thundurus-T and Salamence, while Thunder Punch more reliably beats Gyarados and Azumarill. Fire punch does massive damage to Scizor, and Zen Headbutt lets Jirachi slam Amoonguss, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr. However, locking into coverage moves leaves Jirachi open to threats like Cobalion and Excadrill. Jirachi can utilize Healing Wish late-game to give a teammate another chance to sweep or defensively answer a threat.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Jirachi fits on balance and bulky offense teams, which appreciate its revenge killing capabilities and Healing Wish.

Substitute provides Jirachi with a safe opportunity to use Toxic against its checks like Hippowdon, Moltres, and Swampert, or a safety net to repeatedly use Iron Head against Pokemon like Tangrowth and Amoonguss without risk. Fire Punch offers coverage against Steel-types such as Scizor, Cobalion, and Skarmory while boasting a significant 20% burn chance via Serene Grace, which can be used to stack up damage alongside Iron Head flinches to better pressure Toxic-immune Pokemon like Skarmory and Amoonguss. On top of this, a burned Amoonguss is unable to break Jirachi's Substitute in a single hit, turning it into setup bait for later in the game. Toxic pairs fantastically with Substitute and Iron Head, letting Jirachi wear down and break through Pokemon it would otherwise struggle with such as Slowking and Mandibuzz, as well as crippling offensive checks such as Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Maximum HP investment provides Jirachi with 101 HP Substitutes, preventing Chansey's Seismic Toss from breaking them, while reducing the chance for Slowking to break them with Scald to a low 12.5%. This HP investment also prevents Rotom-W and Rotom-H from breaking Jirachi's Substitute with Volt Switch.</p> <p>SubToxic Jirachi fits best on balance teams that can defensively assist it against Pokemon like Scizor, Moltres, and Keldeo, which it can let in short-term, and provide other forms of support such as additional Toxic users and Heal Bell. Teammates that use Toxic reduce the number of setup turns Jirachi requires to break through checks such as Hippowdon. Celesteela and Skarmory are perfect candidates for this role, encouraging Pokemon like Hippowdon, Slowking, and Moltres to switch into them and be poisoned while providing key defensive support against Pokemon like Scizor, Zarude, and Excadrill. Skarmory can also provide Spikes support to further wear down switch-ins to Jirachi like Amoonguss and Excadrill. SubToxic Jirachi mandates partners such as Scizor and Krookodile that can remove Rocky Helmet from common users of it such as Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Scizor is also able to remove the items of other notable Jirachi checks, such as Celesteela and Hippowdon's Leftovers and Moltres's Heavy-Duty Boots, while Krookodile can provide Stealth Rock support. Hippowdon and Excadrill are also fantastic options for Stealth Rock setters that pair well with Jirachi, switching into Knock Off variants of Nihilego so Jirachi can maintain its Leftovers. Hippowdon can help check Cobalion, Excadrill, and Zygarde-10% for Jirachi, while Excadrill can provide Rapid Spin support and a safer initial switch into an potential unrevealed Grass Knot Nihilego. Slowking is also fantastic due to checking various Steel-types such as Celesteela, Cobalion, and Excadrill, which Jirachi struggles with, and various other offensive threats such as Moltres and Salamence. Offensive teammates such as Keldeo and Moltres greatly appreciate Jirachi's ability to overwhelm their shared checks such as Amoonguss and Slowking, and in return they can provide Jirachi with useful pivots into these Pokemon. SubToxic Jirachi also fits well on more defensive balance and semi-stall teams, greatly appreciating Wish support from Umbreon letting it use Substitute more freely, and Heal Bell support from Pokemon like Chansey and Articuno lets it more aggressively switch into Slowking and freely attack Moltres. Umbreon and Chansey can also help check threats to Jirachi such as Moltres and Noivern, while Articuno can keep the field clear of entry hazards from Jirachi's checks such as Skarmory and Hippowdon.</p> "

Hippowdon, Rhyperior, and Nihilego check threats like Moltres, Thundurus-T, and Rotom-H. The latter two enjoy Jirachi offsetting their lack of recovery with Wish support in return. They can also act as primary checks to Salamence and Noivern to lessen the load on Jirachi. Amoonguss can check Zarude and absorb Knock Off for Jirachi. Moltres also checks Zarude and can beat Steel-types like Scizor and Skarmory that Jirachi lures in. Zarude can bring Jirachi in safely to use Wish against Zarude's checks like Togekiss while also removing Slowking. Rotom-W forms a great defensive core with Jirachi, being able to check threats like Moltres, Autotomize Celesteela, and Starmie.

It additionally serves as a consistent answer to Nidoking. Gastrodon, however, carries a quadruple weakness to Grass, leaving it taken advantage of by Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Zarude in particular is very problematic as Jungle Healing prevents it from being crippled by Toxic or a Scald burn. Gastrodon is also vulnerable to coverage from threats such as Nihilego with Grass Knot and Gyarados with Power Whip. Gastrodon is also rather passive due to its mediocre attacking stats, it relies heavily on status to make progress in games against bulkier teams, and struggles to stop setup sweepers such as Kommo-o and Gyarados.

Ice Beam pressures Salamence while catching Grass-types off guard, but due to Gastrodon's relatively weak attacking power, it is unable to 3HKO Amoonguss or Zarude. Dropping Scald also gives Gastrodon no way to punish Rotom-H. Toxic allows Gastrodon to passively chip bulkier targets such as Rotom-W and Salamence which otherwise don't care too much for Gastrodon's STAB attacks. Clear Smog is useful for stopping setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro, but it makes Gastrodon painfully passive. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Gastrodon to repeatedly switch in without being worn down by hazards, as they remove a large part of Gastrodon's functionality as a defensive Pokemon. Leftovers is an optional item to give Gastrodon passive recovery, but Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred due to how great ignoring hazard chip is.

Its bulk even lets it trade with threats that hit it super effectively like Tangrowth and Rotom-W and cripple them with Toxic.

Mamoswine can be used as a Stealth Rock setter but removing any of Mamoswine's four main moves severely limits its wallbreaking potential. Freeze-Dry is an option to OHKO Quagsire and nearly OHKO Swampert with Life Orb as well as better pressure Rotom-W. The utility offered by Knock Off is generally better, though, as it does nearly the same amount of damage as Freeze-Dry to Rotom-W, and Mamoswine can already nearly 2HKO Gastrodon and Quagsire with Earthquake.

U-turn and Knock Off make it a great offensive pivot that cripples checks like Mandibuzz and Chansey, while coverage moves like Flamethrower, Energy Ball, and Dazzling Gleam allow it to threaten staples like Celesteela, Slowking, and Hydreigon. Meanwhile, Nasty Plot Azelf is a dangerous wallbreaker that threatens specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Celesteela, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. It's fast enough to outspeed and KO many other speedy Pokemon like Keldeo and Nihilego, only being naturally outsped by Noivern, Crobat, and the niche Salazzle. Though Azelf is powerful, its frailty means that it has to pivot out or make outright KOs if it wants to last long-term. Common Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Diggersby can KO or use U-turn against Azelf, and Azelf is quite vulnerable from priority attacks such as Lycanroc-D's Accelerock and Scizor's Bullet Punch. Azelf's great coverage is limited by its moveslots, as a pivot set will have to often choose between Knock Off for support, Energy Ball to threaten Hippowdon, Swampert, and Primarina, and Dazzling Gleam to better handle Dark-types like Hydreigon and Mandibuzz. Nasty Plot faces a similar conundrum, often choosing between Energy Ball and Dazzling Gleam. Thundurus-T gives Azelf stiff competition as both an offensive pivot and a Nasty Plot sweeper. While Azelf is faster and is better equipped to handle threats like Nihilego, Thundurus-T has a better defensive typing, higher Special Attack, and Electric-type STAB moves for threatening common defensive Pokemon that Azelf struggles to beat like Mandibuzz and Slowking.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Specs gives Azelf immense power behind its attacks, threatening to OHKO Assault Vest Tangrowth after Stealth Rock as well as deal more damage to bulky foes like Primarina. A Choice Band set takes advantage of Azelf's high Attack stat to act as an incredibly strong pivot with U-turn, Knock Off, and solid options in Zen Headbutt, Ice Punch, Explosion, and Trick. While this can be effective on some teams, other Choice Band users like Zygarde-10% and Crawduant offer more spammable high-power attacks in Thousand Arrows and STAB Knock Off. Choice Scarf can be used to surprise other Choice Scarf users like Zarude and Hydreigon, as well as faster threats like Crobat. However, this set is very situational and will oftentimes not have much utility compared to other Choice Scarf users like Jirachi, which can spam Iron Head and use Healing Wish in addition to pivoting. Azelf is also naturally fast and doesn't need Choice Scarf to outspeed most unboosted foes. Azelf can act as a Stealth Rock setter, but it should only be used if the team has no other viable options. While Azelf also gets Taunt to prevent Defog, the prevalence of Pokemon like Excadrill that can both spin on Azelf, threaten it with Earthquake thanks to Mold Breaker, and also set up Stealth Rock itself, makes Stealth Rock Azelf less optimal. A Pokemon like Cobalion, Nihilego, or the aforementioned Excadrill is generally a better option for setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Pokemon like Umbreon and Mandibuzz stop most Azelf sets and can easily threaten to KO it in return, although having their item removed with Knock Off makes them much less effective in their defensive roles. More offensive Pokemon like Choice Scarf Zarude and Hydreigon outspeed and OHKO Azelf, and Hydreigon can also switch into non-Pivot Azelf if it is not running Dazzling Gleam.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority: Choice Scarf users such as Zarude, Hydreigon, Jirachi, and Diggersby deal significant damage to Azelf with U-turn or simply OHKO it with a strong attack. Noivern, Crobat, and Salazzle outspeed Azelf naturally and also threaten heavy damage. Priority move users like Scizor, Mamoswine, and Azumarill can pick off a chipped Azelf.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Pokemon with high Special Defense like Chansey, Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Slowking can withstand Azelf's attacks and hinder it with chip damage or status, and Chansey and Slowing can often use Teleport to bring in an offensive check. However, the former two hate Knock Off and the latter three fear coverage options like Flamethrower and Energy Ball. Even Chansey is 2HKOed by +2 Psyshock with Life Orb.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Psychic is Azelf's strongest and usually preferred STAB move, dealing big damage to the likes of Thundurus-T and Amoonguss, but Psyshock is an option to OHKO Nihilego and deal more damage to Tentacruel and Calm Mind users like Primarina and Keldeo. Flamethrower hits a wide range of defensive Pokemon like Scizor, Skarmory, and Tangrowth, while Fire Blast is a stronger option to help finish off Celesteela and Tangrowth, but the difference in damage is often not worth the accuracy drop. U-turn is Azelf's key move on this set, as its high Speed allows it to pivot out of danger from Pokemon like Mandibuzz and bring in a teammate safely. Azelf's last moves usually depend on the item it is running. If running Expert Belt, Energy Ball or Dazzling Gleam should be used. Energy Ball is the preferred final move to wipe out common foes like Slowking, Hippowdon, and Mamoswine, notably 2HKOing the former two and OHKOing the latter with the Expert Belt boost. Meanwhile, Dazzling Gleam is an option for Dragon-types and bulky Dark-types like Hydreigon, Salamence, Mandibuzz, and Umbreon. If using Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid Stealth Rock damage as Azelf pivots throughout the battle, Knock Off is the preferred final move to remove items from common switch-ins such as Chansey and Mandibuzz so Azelf can attempt to outlast them. Timid is the preffered nature as Azelf is not concerned about U-turn chip damage, though Naive can be used if running Knock Off for extra power as the loss in Special Defense barely affects Azelf and maintaining chip damage from U-turn and Knock Off can be beneficial. 4 Defense EVs ensure Azelf takes a Thousand Arrows from Zygarde-10%.</p> <p>This set fits best on fast-paced balance and offense teams, where its pivot support can assist in getting other hard-hitting Pokemon like Mamoswine onto the field. Azelf is already a strong offensive presence, but wallbreakers like Keldeo, Hydreigon, Conkeldurr, and Mamoswine overwhelm shared checks such as Slowking, Chansey, and Mandibuzz. Stealth Rock setters like Nihilego and Spikes users like Skarmory put even more stress on the opposing team. Nihilego also can pressure Mandibuzz and wear down Slowking. Excadrill compresses setting and removing entry hazards, enabling Expert Belt Azelf to come in and break through the enemy team more easily. Azelf works best in combination with other pivots such as Zarude, Thundurus-T, and Slowking; all of which appreciating Azelf taking on Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Zarude can counter Hippowdon and Slowking and bring Azelf in against Skarmory, Thundurus-T can threaten Mandibuzz and Crobat, and a Slowking of your own can be used as a slower, defensive pivot to bring in Azelf against Pokemon like Tangrowth. Scizor can lure in Cobalion and Skarmory and use U-turn to give Azelf opportunities to wallbreak while also picking off priority users that threaten Azelf like Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine. Tangrowth and Amoonguss help check dangerous revenge killers like Diggersby and Zarude for Azelf, while Azelf can threaten Steel-types like Skarmory and Celesteela. Primarina can handle many threats to Azelf, including Mandibuzz and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, while Azelf can threaten Grass-types like Amoonguss. In addition to Primarina, bulky Pokemon like Slowking and Salamence can make up for Azelf's frailty by defensively answering threats to it.</p> "

        "description": "<p>+2 Azelf can dismantle nearly the entire tier, depending on what coverage moves it chooses. Psyshock is usually preferred for STAB to OHKO Nihilego and Tentacruel before a boost and better threaten Chansey and Calm Mind Primarina. However, Psychic is an option to do more neutral damage to Pokemon like Salamence and Mamoswine if Azelf is not running super effective coverage for them. Fire Blast covers Grass-types like Tangrowth and Steel-types like Celesteela, OHKOing all after Nasty Plot. Azelf's other coverage depends on the team's needs. Energy Ball wipes out Swampert, Hippowdon, and Slowking. Dazzling Gleam hits Dark- and Dragon-types like Hydreigon, Umbreon, Mandibuzz, and Salamence. Substitute is an option over either of these moves to give it a safety net to either set up easier or take a hit and retaliate back. Azelf can often get up Substitute against who rely on hindering it with status like Hippowdon as well as Pokemon it forces out like Keldeo. Expert Belt is usually the preferred item on this set, as it allows Azelf to fire off attacks without consequence while still dealing enough damage to OHKO defensive Pokemon like Celesteela after Nasty Plot. Life Orb can be used for even more damage, in particular against Pokemon Azelf lacks coverage for like Chansey and Hatterene. Unfortunately, Life Orb wears down Azelf fairly quickly and leaves it susceptible to priority attacks like Bullet Punch from Scizor. Focus Sash allows Azelf to safely take a hit and boost or avoid being revenge killed, though this item is unreliable as it can easily be broken by Stealth Rock.</p> <p>This set fits best on hyper offense teams, whose teammates can support Azelf. An entry hazard setter like Scolipede helps facilitate an Azelf sweep, and Excadrill can both set hazards and remove them. Azelf is naturally fast, but a Sticky Web setter like Ribombee invalidates Choice Scarf users like Diggersby and Zarude, letting Azelf easily sweep most teams. Sticky Web also allows Azelf to attack Starmie and Zygarde-10% without risking a Speed tie. Strong physical sweepers, like Gyarados and Diggersby, can work as secondary sweepers against teams that carry multiple stops to Azelf. Azelf can set up on most checks to these physical sweepers, including Tangrowth and Skarmory. A wallbreaker like Mamoswine can break through many checks to Azelf, such as Mandibuzz and Chansey, to allow Azelf to more easily sweep. Thundurus-T can also help threaten Pokemon like Mandibuzz, as Azelf struggles to break through it even with Dazzling Gleam. Nihilego can serve as a secondary sweeper with Meteor Beam and important coverage in moves such as Sludge Wave and Thunderbolt, while Azelf can assist in removing or weakening Nihilego's checks like Slowking, Chansey, and Jirachi.</p> "

Mold Breaker allows Excadrill to bypass abilities like Levitate from Rotom-W and Magic Bounce from Hatterene to KO them or set Stealth Rock. Excadrill can also utilize a suicide lead set on hyper offense teams to pave the way for dangerous sweepers like Celesteela and Thundurus-T. Excadrill can also be a potent late-game cleaner with a Swords Dance + Rapid Spin set, boosting up to break through walls like Chansey and Amoonguss and clean through weakened teams. However, Excadrill is extremely vulnerable to the tier's Water-, Grass-, and Fighting-type Pokemon like Keldeo, Zarude, and Conkeldurr, all of which can easily take advantage of it due to their higher Speed or access to priority. Excadrill struggles to bypass common threats like Skarmory, Hippowdon, Moltres, and Celesteela. Skarmory and Hippowdon are especially troublesome, as Excadrill struggles to keep entry hazards removed against the most prevalent setters in the tier. Furthermore, Excadrill's defensive stats are lackluster without investment, which hinders its role as a Steel-type when checking threats like Hatterene and Hydreigon.</p> ",

Tapu Bulu also counters the aforementioned Water-types and provides Grassy Terrain support to increase Seismitoad's longevity. Salamence and Skarmory help take on Grass-types like Zarude and Tangrowth, with the latter also providing Spikes to complement Seismitoad's Stealth Rock. Salamence also can keep Seismitoad from being worn down by Spikes with Defog. Umbreon and Jirachi can sustain Seismitoad with Wish, with the former checking wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Azelf, and Nidoqueen that can overwhelm Seismitoad. Togekiss can similarly play the role of a cleric and assist in pressuring Grass-types like Zarude and Tapu Bulu while forming a solid backbone against Keldeo. In exchange, Seismitoad helps in wearing down Rotom-W and Rotom-H. Chansey also acts as a cleric with Aromatherapy and walls dangerous wallbreakers like Hydreigon, Thundurus-T, and Azelf with ease.</p> "

Earthquake dissuades Cobalion from setting up on Scolipede and nails Rapid Spin users like Tentacruel and Excadrill.

    "overview": "<p>Krookodile's solid offensive potential and utility options in Taunt and Knock Off make it a decent Stealth Rock setter in UU. Few Pokemon resist the combination of Earthquake and Knock Off, denting the likes of Nihilego, Galarian Slowbro, and even neutral targets like Primarina and Amoonguss. Intimidate lets Krookodile switch into resisted and neutral hits such as Lycanroc-D's Stone Edge without getting too worn down while also prevents late-game sweeps from Pokemon like Scizor. Moves like Stealth Rock and Taunt let Krookodile take on common Defoggers like Mandibuzz and Moltres while having Knock Off to ruin their longevity. However, Krookodile is quite frail, still being threatened by physical attackers like Cobalion, Scizor, and Zygarde-10% even after Intimidate, and its special bulk leaves it vulnerable to special attackers like Hydreigon and Salamence. Weaknesses to common types like Grass, Water, and Fighting hinder its defensive utility and leave it helpless against common Pokemon like Tangrowth, Primarina, and Keldeo. Coverage from Electric-types like Thundurus-T's Focus Blast prevents Krookodile from checking them despite its Electric immunity. Excadrill gives Krookodile immense competition as a utility Ground-type on teams, sporting a better defensive typing, having access to Rapid Spin, and being able to hit hard without investment in Attack. Hippowdon's access to reliable recovery and greater bulk also give Krookodile heavy competition as a Stealth Rock setter.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Band allows Krookodile to be a powerful wallbreaker, using its near unresisted STAB combination to threaten Pokemon like Excadrill and Amoonguss. However, this set faces competition from Zygarde-10% who is faster and has a more spammable attack in Thousand Arrows. Krookodile can also run a Choice Scarf set to be a decent revenge killer to the likes of Azelf and Raikou, but this set faces competition from other Choice Scarf users like Diggersby and Hydreigon due to them being stronger and having access to U-turn. Krookodile can opt for a more offensive Choice Scarf set with Moxie, letting it accumulate Attack boosts as it KOes enemies. However, the utility that Intimidate offers is more worth it to weaken Pokemon like Zygarde-10%, and Krookodile can't break past Grass-types and Hippowdon without enough boosts. Rindo Berry is an option to survive +1 Nihilego's Grass Knot and OHKO back with Earthquake.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Amoonguss and Tangrowth check Krookodile very well and are only bothered by Knock Off. Both cause big damage with Giga Drain and incapacitate a team member with Spore or Sleep Powder. Zarude and Tapu Bulu can also switch into Krookodile's STAB moves and can recover with Jungle Healing or Horn Leech.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Rotom-W is immune to Ground and can nail Krookdoile with Hydro Pump. Krookodile also can't take any Water-type hits from Azumarill, Primarina, and Keldeo, but they don't like to switch in directly into its moves. Swampert and Slowking can take hits from Krookodile and threaten it back.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage: Keldeo, Cobalion, and Conkeldurr also threaten Krookodile greatly, with the former two outspeeding and KOing it. Meanwhile, Conkeldurr has the bulk to take an Earthquake and recover its health with Drain Punch or just pick off Krookodile with Mach Punch. Fighting-type coverage like Focus Blast on Thundurus-T and Close Combat from Lycanroc-D keep Krookodile from taking them on.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Despite its ability and good defensive typing, Krookodile has subpar bulk and lacks reliable recovery, meaning it gets worn down quite quickly switching into Pokemon such as Excadrill and Zygarde-10%. Pokemon like Hydreigon and Nidoking hurt it very badly with even resisted special STAB moves due to its bad special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Physical walls: Hippowdon and Skarmory are unfazed by any of Krookodile's attacks and can wear it down with status or outright KO it.</p> ",

Toxic allows Krookodile to cripple checks such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu. Taunt prevents Stealth Rock and Defog from Pokemon like Excadrill, Swampert, Rotom-W, and Moltres. It also can deny recovery from Hippowdon and defensive Salamence. Leftovers offsets entry hazard damage and gives Krookodile longevity to keep threats like Nihilego and Excadrill in check more easily.

On hyper offense teams, Life Orb can be used to amplify Krookodile's offensive presence and let it pressure Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Rotom-W more easily.

Skarmory, namely Iron Defense variants, also help take on Zarude, Azumarill, and Conkeldurr. Setup sweepers such as Thundurus-T and Necrozma work well with Krookodile, as it can set Stealth Rock up and weaken their checks such as Tangrowth and Primarina. Special attackers like Azelf and Nihilego appreciate Krookodile denting and crippling their checks in Chansey and Celesteela with Knock Off, paving their way to sweep. In return, they compensate for Krookodile's lower Speed tier and remove Pokemon like Conkeldurr, Zarude, and Tapu Bulu. Amoonguss can check Pokemonn like Primarina and Zarude for Krookodile, and together they can keep Lycanroc-D in check. Salamence forms a double Intimidate core with Krookodile, weakening Pokemon like Zarude and stopping setup sweepers like Gyarados from getting out of control.

Under sun, even the sturdiest of Water-types like Slowking and RestTalk Primarina cannot switch in without risking a 2HKO. Its coverage moves also hit most Fire-resistant Pokemon for good damage, with Rock Slide hitting Moltres and Rotom-H, while Earthquake OHKOes Nihilego and lets Darmanitan revenge kill Tentacruel. Both coverage moves also don't have recoil damage. Darmanitan can be difficult to revenge kill, as it resists Scizor's Bullet Punch and many faster threats are unable to switch in safely. However, its poor bulk and Stealth Rock weakness severely limit its entry points, and it is still forced out by revenge killers such as Lycanroc-D, Azumarill, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon once they are in. Flare Blitz, its main STAB attack, has substantial recoil damage that racks up over time, which reduces Darmanitan's overall longevity. It also struggles to break past Fire-resistant Pokemon with recovery if it lacks sun support, like Primarina and Salamence. Darmanitan faces competition as a Choice Scarf user with Diggersby, which has better longevity due to its Stealth Rock resistance and lack of recoil damage.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Trick is an option to debilitate defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Chansey, and Primarina. However, it sacrifices the Speed boost from Choice Scarf, so it should only be used when Choice Scarf is no longer necessary, and has to replace a coverage move. Choice Band can further increase Darmanitan's power, but it becomes more vulnerable to revenge killers like Nihilego and Cobalion, and the additional power is mostly unnecessary. Heavy-Duty Boots grants Darmanitan more longevity, letting it fit on different team archetypes, but the loss of Speed and inability to avoid recoil from being forced into using Flare Blitz prevents it from fulfilling an offensive pivot role that well compared to other options like Azelf.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Due to not commonly running Heavy-Duty Boots, Darmanitan takes substantial entry hazard damage upon switching in.

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>Reuniclus is a unique Pokemon that serves as a slow yet bulky and powerful wallbreaker with good longevity. Its ability, Magic Guard, allows it to completely ignore passive damage, such as Toxic from Chansey and Hippowdon, as well as sand damage from the latter. Magic Guard also negates Life Orb recoil, which, in tandem with its high natural Special Attack stat, makes it extremely difficult to switch into, and its coverage options in Focus Blast and Thunder are able to wipe out checks like Zarude, Hydreigon, Mandibuzz, and Celesteela. Reuniclus's bulk allows it to trade with and KO common Pokemon such as Moltres, Salamence, and Zygarde-10% with enough prior chip damage. However, Reuniclus is terribly slow and often relies on prediction. It is also prone to getting overwhelmed by offensive teams, which give it very few chances to use Recover. Psychic is also a fairly mediocre defensive typing because it doesn't resist common attacks and is weak to the omnipresent Knock Off and U-turn, which means Reuniclus is often forced into using Recover more than it would like to, further limiting its offensive presence. Furthermore, Focus Blast and Thunder's poor accuracies make using an attack that isn't Psychic a gamble. Reuniclus also faces heavy competition from Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro and Azelf; the former has more expansive coverage and a better defensive typing, while the latter is faster, generating momentum with U-turn and progress with Knock Off. Reuniclus is stronger than both, however, and can ignore passive damage like sand and entry hazards, making it harder to overwhelm.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Calm Mind sets with maximum Defense investment make Reuniclus a potent stallbreaker thanks to its immunity to Toxic, turning traditional checks like Chansey and Hippowdon into setup bait. However, this set is largely outclassed by Galarian Slowbro, which has a more useful typing to set up more easily and greater offensive potency. Calm Mind + Trick + Sticky Barb sets can take switch-ins like Zarude and Scizor out of commission, but this set still struggles into Dark-types and requires extensive team support. Stored Power sets with Calm Mind and Acid Armor allow Reuniclus to boost its defenses and potentially snowball enemy teams, but this set is largely unreliable because it cannot touch Dark-types and Reuniclus will be a dead weight if it fails to safely boost. Assault Vest Reuniclus makes use of Regenerator by scouting powerful special attackers like Keldeo and Primarina, while setting itself apart from Galarian Slowbro with its access to Knock Off. However, Galarian Slowbro is usually better in this role as well, having much more of an offensive presence by virtue of its great coverage. As a defensive pivot, Assault Vest Reuniclus also faces competition from Slowking and Chansey, both being much safer options due to their access to Teleport. Offensive Trick Room Reuniclus is an option that turns its horrible Speed stat into an advantage. However, it usually isn't favored, as Reuniclus has to give up Recover to use Trick Room, severely cutting into its longevity.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type coverage: Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Zarude are extremely threatening for Reuniclus, though they hate taking Focus Blast. Mandibuzz can pivot into most of Reuniclus's attacks and slowly rack up chip damage with U-turn; it can't switch in on Thunder, though. Knock Off from Tangrowth, Scizor, and Diggersby is also particularly dangerous for Reuniclus, as it hates losing its item and taking massive damage from the latter two.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Powerful wallbreakers such as Chandelure, Mamoswine, and Keldeo can force out Reuniclus to an extent, as it does not want to take chip damage that forces it into using Recover more often. Its terrible Speed makes it difficult to find chances to Recover against offensive teams as well.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Bulky special walls, including Slowking and Chansey, give Reuniclus an extremely hard time, as both can pivot in on its STAB move and use it for easy momentum into a dangerous threat with Teleport.

Further, many common Steel-types like Celesteela, Excadrill, and Skarmory are neutral to Ice, meaning they cannot switch in safely at all.

Its Poison typing additionally gives it an edge over other common Grass-types, as it is able to threaten Tangrowth and Zarude with Sludge Bomb, which also prevents them from switching in to absorb Spore.

Amoonguss faces competition from Tangrowth as a defensive Grass-type wall, which can opt to run Assault Vest sets to check specially offensive foes such as Thundurus-T better, not be neutral to Excadrill and Zygarde-10%'s Ground-type STAB, and avoid being setup bait for Swords Dance Cobalion if something else has been hit with Spore.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Seed Bomb keeps Amoonguss from being set up on by Substitute + Calm Mind Primarina, but it does less damage to most other Water-types and loses out on the recovery of Giga Drain, not to mention a burn from Scald can render this move useless. Stomping Tantrum is an option to hit Nihilego and Cobalion for solid damage rather than rely on Spore to neuter them. Assault Vest allows Amoonguss to act as an even better check to special attackers like Keldeo and Thundurus-T, and it can still run utility moves like Spore due to Amoonguss's tendency to get hit with Knock Off.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types and Psychic-type coverage: Offensive Psychic-types like Necrozma and Azelf can force out Amoonguss with their powerful attacks.

Moltres and Chandelure can threaten to OHKO Amoonguss with their powerful STAB.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types and Flying-type Coverage: Salamence and Togekiss deal heavy damage to Amoonguss with their STAB attacks. Skarmory, Crobat, and Celesteela don't fear anything from Amoonguss barring Spore and can easily take advantage of it when Spore is used. Flying-type coverage like Air Slash on Keldeo and Dual Wingbeat on Scizor keep Amoonguss from reliably taking them on, leaving it to be careful switching into them.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: While Amoonguss is bulky, it can be overwhelmed by wallbreakers such as Nidoking, Mamoswine, Zygarde-10%, and Hydreigon. These Pokemon all fear Spore, however, so they can only effectively threaten Amoonguss if a teammate has been put to sleep or they are brought in safely. Conkeldurr is able to overwhelm Amoonguss with Facade and is immune to Spore once its Flame Orb activates. Cobalion completely counters Amoonguss after Spore and can freely use it to boost with Swords Dance.</p> ",

This often requires an opposing team to use a Pokemon as sleep fodder, making it easier for Amoonguss's teammates to capitalize on. Stun Spore is an option that can be run over Spore to potentially cripple Pokemon like Celesteela, Cobalion, and Nihilego that would otherwise wall it once a Pokemon has been slept. Giga Drain heavily damages Rotom-W and Keldeo, which Amoonguss naturally checks by virtue of its typing and bulk. It also enables Amoonguss to regain some HP, reducing the need for it to continually pivot for Regenerator recovery. Alternatively, Synthesis can be run to instantly regain health, though its low PP should be noticed, and Hippowdon's sand can limit the amount of health recovered by it. Sludge Bomb threatens Primarina, Zarude, and Azumarill. It is also useful for the chance to poison switch-ins such as Salamence and Mandibuzz. Foul Play dents physical attackers such as Gyarados and Scizor and prevents them from setting up on Amoonguss, and it is also Amoonguss's best way to damage other Steel-types such as Jirachi. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers Amoonguss switches into such as Azumarill and Zarude. Black Sludge is an alternative option that reduces Amoonguss's reliance on switching out to regain HP with Regenerator. Eject Button can be run so Amoonguss can pivot into a foe, take a hit, and bring in a teammate safely. 36 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Amoonguss can take a Choice Specs-boosted Psychic from Primarina as well as better check Keldeo.</p> <p>Amoonguss fits best on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams that appreciate its ability to blanket check dangerous metagame staples such as Tangrowth and Primarina. Chansey can take on special attackers like Nidoking, Moltres, and Salamence that can overwhelm Amoonguss. Checks to Moltres and Salamence, such as Hippowdon and Primarina, are useful partners that can switch into them and force it out. They also can take on Cobalion after Spore has been burned. Krookodile and Mandibuzz can check Psychic-types like Galarian Slowbro and Azelf. Mandibuzz also helps Amoonguss not get overwhelmed by Zygarde-10%. Amoonguss is heavily threatened by Fire-types such as Moltres and Rotom-H, so checks to these such as Slowking and Swampert make good partners. Amoonguss is vulnerable to Stealth Rock and Spikes chip damage, and gives free opportunities for Pokemon such as Nihilego and Skarmory to set these after Spore has been used, so entry hazard removal support from partners such as Salamence and Excadrill enables it to switch in more often and prevents entry hazards from cancelling out its Regenerator recovery.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Chandelure's amazing Special Attack stat, threatening STAB combination, and wide utility movepool make it a strong offensive presence capable of getting past most of its checks. Hex Chandelure is notable for burdening switch-ins like Hydreigon and Hippowdon with delibirating status, allowing it to overcome them while still utilizing its dangerous STAB combination to threaten many teams. Meanwhile, Choice Specs is an excellent option for its immediate wallbreaking prowess and ability to utilize utility moves like Sleep Talk and Trick. Chandelure's typing also offers a few defensive benefits, letting it soft check popular Pokemon like Celesteela and Amoonguss. Unfortunately, Chandelure's rather average Speed and common weaknesses allow UU's many faster threats, including Keldeo, Hydreigon, and Nihilego, to easily overwhelm it. Moreover, it is weak to Stealth Rock, which can significantly damage its longevity on sets that aren't running Heavy-Duty Boots. Hex sets can lack immediate firepower, leaving Chandelure reliant on teammates for entry into the field.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind is a decent option for a set, taking advantage of defensive foes like Chansey to find setup opportunities. However, Chandelure's other sets are more immediately powerful, which is often more valuable for it. Energy Ball is a situational option for powering through various Pokemon, like Primarina and Hippowdon, but Chandelure can still hit all the aforementioned targets hard with its Ghost-type moves. Choice Scarf Chandelure is a viable revenge killer with its potent offensive typing, even still having the option of crippling defensive checks with Trick, though it notably lacks power and is usually only standout on sun teams. Memento allows Chandelure to grab momentum for its team after it's been weakened while potentially positioning a teammate to sweep. This is rather situational and gives up better utility, though, usually only working well on Choice item sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Several Water-types can often find ways to give Chandelure trouble. Azumarill and Crawdaunt can apply serious pressure with their powerful STAB Aqua Jet. Keldeo outspeeds and OHKOes Chandelure. Primarina can take any hit from full health and power through Chandelure with its Water-type STAB moves. Tentacruel can be particularly annoying, tanking attacks with its good special bulk and checking the Hex set well thanks to its Toxic immunity.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Krookodile and Zarude often struggle to reliably switch in, but they can outspeed Chandelure and pick it off with super effective STAB moves. Hydreigon walls Chandelure's STAB combination and can OHKO it, although its common sets do not utilize Roost, leaving it subject to being overwhelmed. Mandibuzz can switch into Shadow Ball and scare Chandelure out, but it takes massive damage from Fire Blast and risks getting OHKOed by Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Faster threats: Chandelure's rather average Speed leaves it vulnerable to most faster Pokemon, such as Zygarde-10%, Excadrill, Lycanroc-D, and Choice Scarf Diggersby, which can smack it with super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Various specially bulky Pokemon can tank hits from Chandelure and cripple it in return. Chansey doesn't risk major damage from any attack, but it needs to look out for Trick or Taunt on the switch; Taunt leaves it completely unable to touch Chandelure. Nihilego can always take at least one Shadow Ball from full and pressure Chandelure with a super effective STAB moves. It's a particularly strong check to the Hex set, bearing an immunity to Toxic and taking minimal damage from Fire-type moves. Hippowdon doesn't like to switch into Chandelure but it can tank any hit and KO it back with Earthquake.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Flamethrower is a reliable STAB move to threaten common Pokemon like Scizor, Tangrowth, and Skarmory. Hex severely damages foes that Chandelure hits with Toxic. However, it should be noted that it isn't too powerful on non-statused foes, which can require careful play. Toxic burdens potential switch-ins like Hippowdon, Hydreigon, and Primarina, putting them on a timer and allowing Chandelure to potentially whittle them down with Hex. Will-O-Wisp is an alternative option to cripple Toxic-immune foes like Nihilego, Crobat, and Galarian Slowbro, with threats like Hydreigon still hating status regardless. Protect allows Chandelure to rack up poison damage and can also scout Choice item users, such as Hydreigon and Keldeo. Taunt is an option over Protect, allowing Chandelure to pressure Chansey more effectively by blocking Chansey's recovery and Toxic, which boosts its stall matchup. However, Protect is often too valuable thanks to its stronger applications against offensive Pokemon. Heavy-Duty Boots significantly boosts this set's longevity and self-sufficiency. Flame Body allows Chandelure to pivot into and threaten a burn against foes like Jirachi and Celesteela. It can also let Chandelure cripple Pokemon that revenge kill it, like Knock Off Azelf, as it faints.</p> <p>Hex Chandelure fits best on bulky offense, balance, and semi-stall teams that appreciate Chandelure's ability to wear down defensive threats early- to mid-game. Chandelure can struggle to get a Toxic against foes like Slowking and Hippowdon at times, so defensive Celesteela is a great teammate that can cripple these threats with Toxic instead, especially luring in the former looking to switch in on Leech Seed. Cobalion, Hippowdown, and Nidoqueen can provide Stealth Rock support to whittle down checks like Hydreigon and Nihilego. They all handle Nihilego, which is a problem for Chandelure if not running Will-O-Wisp. Cobalion also breaks past Chansey and Umbreon and switches into Scizor's Knock Off. Pivots such as Rotom-W, Zarude, and Choice Scarf Diggersby can all bring in Chandelure against bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Rotom-W and Zarude take on Primarina and Hippowdon as well, while Diggersby revenge kills Nihilego with ease. Amoonguss defensively checks Primarina and Keldeo and can provide paralysis with Stun Spore to hinder foes like Noivern. Umbreon's typing synergizes well with Chandelure's and can provide Wish support to keep Chandelure and the rest of the team healthy. Late-game cleaners like Azelf, Nasty Plot Togekiss, and Calm Mind Primarina all enjoy Chandelure wearing down the enemy team's defensive core, limiting threats like Hydreigon in return. Other status spreaders can work well as teammates, alleviating Chandelure's need for prediction regarding Hex. Galarian Slowbro is particularly good at spreading status due to its tendency to run both Scald and Sludge Bomb. Tentacruel does this as well and can also utilize Knock Off to further cripple foes.</p> "

Overheat is an option to nearly OHKO defensive Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Hippowdon, but its Special Attack drop makes Fire Blast more spammable. Shadow Ball is a reliable STAB attack to wipe out Fire-resistant Pokemon like Slowking, Salamence, and Nihilego. Flamethrower is strong and accurate, preventing foes like Scizor and Tangrowth from utilizing a lucky Fire Blast miss to cripple Chandelure. Sleep Talk lets Chandelure act as a sleep absorber for its team, pivoting in on Amoonguss's Spore without being entirely crippled. Trick is another option in the fourth moveslot, however, to cripple defensive switch-ins like Chansey. Flame Body is preferred to potentially punish physical attackers such as Crobat and Scizor. Flash Fire is an option to let Chandelure pivot in on Fire-type attacks from foes like Moltres and Salamence, boosting its damage output. A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed Adamant Gyarados and Mamoswine as well as Modest Nidoking, but Modest can be an option for increased damage output, being able to OHKO Hippowdon with Overheat after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>This set is a solid fit on offense teams for the massive wallbreaking prowess it offers. Chandelure requires extensive support in entry hazard removal to offset its Stealth Rock vulnerability. Excadrill and Salamence can form a double entry hazard removal core for Chandelure, keeping Stealth Rock and Spikes off against common setters like Nihilego, Hippowdon, and Skarmory together. Salamence can also check faster threats like Zarude and Keldeo for Chandelure. Chandelure appreciates entry hazard support for furthering damage on foes alongside its attacks; Swampert and the aforementioned Excadrill are solid choices, additionally pivoting in on foes that can revenge kill it like Lycanroc-D and Thundurus-T. Rotom-W is a particularly strong teammate for Chandelure, as it can lure in Grass-types like Amoonguss and pivot Chandelure into them with Volt Switch while also making use of Defog. Zarude is another strong partner, pressuring foes like Primarina and Nihilego for Chandelure and bringing it in against Pokemon like Scizor and Amoonguss. Azelf outspeed and KOes faster threats like Keldeo, Lycanroc-D, and Cobalion.

Defog can also be used due to its good matchup against certain entry hazard setters such as Excadrill and Jirachi, but Mandibuzz can't beat other setters like Nihilego or Hippowdon, and struggles longer term versus Skarmory, especially Toxic variants, so it should only be run if absolutely necessary.

Nasty Plot can be used to turn Hydreigon into a ferocious wallbreaker that can get many setup chances alongside Roost. With a boost, it can easily break past Pokemon that would normally switch into it like Celesteela, Mandibuzz, and Hippowdon using its STAB moves.

Cobalion's Swords Dance set also stands out among other physical setup sweepers such as Aegislash and Ice Fang Gyarados by not fearing any of Amoonguss's attacks, becoming a fierce wallbreaker after Sleep Clause has been activated. Cobalion's typing has its drawbacks, though, as it is not Fairy or Flying resistant like other Steel-types, making Cobalion unreliable at switching into threats such as Hatterene and Galarian Moltres. Without Swords Dance, its offensive prowess also is underwhelming compared to its Fighting-type competition such as Mienshao and Kommo-o.

Shuca Berry makes Cobalion less vulnerable to being revenge killed by Krookodile and Zygarde-10%, but its use is otherwise limited. A Calm Mind set is able to bait Pokemon such as Buzzwole and give Cobalion a boost to its lackluster Special Defense. However, Focus Blast is a less reliable STAB move than Close Combat and gives Cobalion a worse matchup against Chansey. Life Orb makes Cobalion more immediately threatening, as it enables Close Combat to OHKO Mienshao without a boost and guarantees other OHKOs against Pokemon such as offensive Kommo-o with +2 Close Combat and Salamence with +1 Stone Edge.

Outside of rain teams, Tornadus can be rather inconsistent relying on Hurricane and Focus Blast as its primary attacks, making other special attackers like Azelf more appealing.

However, both struggle to reliably check Tornadus's mixed offensive set, as it can cripple them with Knock Off and outlast them with U-turn + Acrobatics until they are in range of a KO. Celesteela similarly fares well against the Choice Specs set and has Leech Seed to regain lost health, though it still hates Knock Off removing its Leftovers albeit less than the other two.

Substitute can be used over a coverage move on Keldeo's Calm Mind set to set up on threats like Amoonguss, but the presence of Assault Vest Tangrowth as well as the additional value Air Slash provides makes it not worth it most of the time. Choice Scarf sets with Flip Turn are a fine option if the ability to outspeed extremely fast Pokemon like boosted Salamence and Choice Scarf Zarude is absolutely necessary for a team to function, but Keldeo's unboosted damage output is somewhat disappointing and Flip Turn hits like a wet noodle off Keldeo's meager Attack stat, leaving it generally outclassed by other fast pivots like Noivern and Choice Scarf Hydreigon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types, specifically those resistant to Secret Sword like Slowking and RestTalk Primarina, can switch into Keldeo all game long, as long as they keep themselves healthy.

Electric-types like Raikou, Rotom-W, and Thundurus-T form good cores with Keldeo, as they can break down the likes of Slowking and Primarina for it. They can also check Togekiss, which can punish Keldeo locked into Secret Sword quite hard. Answers to Slowking, and thus the combination of Future Sight + Teleport, are mandatory when using Keldeo. Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Zarude can switch into Slowking safely and prevent it from using Teleport for free, breaking the FuturePort chain. Grass-types like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Zarude can aid in Keldeo's eternal fight against bulky Water-types while also being able to check the likes of Gyarados and Primarina.</p> "

Scald threatens switch-ins like Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Slowking with a burn while providing strong neutral damage against Skarmory and Scizor. Secret Sword breaks through Chansey, Zarude, Rotom-W, and Hydreigon. Air Slash hits Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth hard and allows Keldeo to possibly flinch down checks like Salamence and Slowking. Icy Wind can be used over Air Slash to OHKO on Salamence and still hit the aforementioned Grass-types hard after a Calm Mind boost, but it is weak otherwise and keeps Keldeo from meaningfully damaging Slowking. Leftovers gives Keldeo passive recovery to have more setup chances against the likes of Scizor and Mandibuzz and is also useful for offsetting Stealth Rock and sand damage. Life Orb is an option for increased wallbreaking power, able to OHKO Chansey with Secret Sword and Amoonguss with Air Slash after Stealth Rock with a boost, but causes Keldeo to get worn down quickly. Life Orb is solely used on hyper offense teams, as longevity is less needed.</p> <p>Calm Mind Keldeo best fits on bulky offense and balance teams as a strong late-game sweeper and is also valued on hyper offense teams for its good matchup against opposing offense. Entry hazard support is essential in softening up bulky Grass-types for Keldeo; Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Nidoqueen make excellent teammates as a result. Hippowdon also can bait Tangrowth and Slowking into taking Toxic and wear them down with sand damage. Meanwhile, Nidoqueen directly pressures Primarina for Keldeo. Pivots like Thundurus-T and Choice Scarf Diggersby pressure Slowking and Primarina throughout a game to keep them from switching into Keldeo without any care. They also wear down Amoonguss and Tangrowth with their repeated pivoting moves. Teammates such as Crobat, Noivern, and the aforementioned Diggersby can keep faster threats to Keldeo like Azelf and Starmie in line. Swords Dance Scizor, particularly Safety Goggles variants, takes advantage of Amoonguss and Tangrowth incredibly well, and can lure in and remove Salamence's item with Knock Off, allowing Keldeo to overwhelm it more easily with Air Slash. On hyper offense teams, Autotomize Celesteela and Nasty Plot Azelf take on Tangrowth and Amoonguss and overwhelm Primarina and Slowking for Keldeo, as they will often be the opposing team's main line of defense against these threats.</p> "

A Swords Dance boost allows Diggersby to KO defensive walls like Chansey and Celesteela; even the latter is KOed by Mega Kick after chip damage despite being the only Pokemon in the tier that resists or is immune to both STAB moves. Quick Attack also provides a strong STAB priority attack that allows Diggersby to perform late-game sweeps, while a Choice Scarf set can outspeed and KO some of its usual offensive checks like Cobalion and Lycanroc-D; however, other common Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Zarude outspeed Diggersby and have more defensive utility, with the former having Intimidate and the latter having decent natural bulk. Without Choice Scarf, Diggersby is slow and will rarely outspeed its foes, forcing it to usually rely on Quick Attack for a late-game sweep and making it easy fodder for faster revenge killers like Keldeo if they are healthy enough to survive a boosted Quick Attack. Other offensive Pokemon that can boost their Speed, such as Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados, can better position themselves to sweep. With Diggersby's low defenses and lack of any meaningful defensive utility outside of switching in on a predicted Electric-type attack with its Choice Scarf set, it needs to typically OHKO its foes to prevent taking heavy damage in return. Additionally, it is weak to common priority users such as Aqua Jet Azumarill and Mach Punch Conkeldurr.</p> ",

Unfortunately, this set is very prediction reliant. Additionally, Diggersby's poor Speed makes it easy for many foes like Zarude and Lycanroc-D to revenge kill it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon: Diggersby's main drawback is its below average Speed without Choice Scarf, allowing many offensive threats in the tier like Zarude and Lycanroc-D to OHKO it.

Mega Kick KOes Pokemon like Rotom-W and Rotom-H on the switch after minimal damage. It is a powerful STAB move capable of letting Diggersby still muscle past Tangrowth and Celesteela; however, it will have a much harder time getting past Skarmory. Body Slam can be used over Mega Kick as a more reliable option that will still deal enough damage to KO defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss after one Swords Dance boost. Life Orb provides Diggersby with the extra power needed to break through Tangrowth with Fire Punch, while boosting the power of its Quick Attack to pick off a weakened foe. Silk Scarf should primarily be considered if opting for Mega Kick over Fire Punch to retain the extra power to break through defensive cores and ability to clean late-game with +2 Quick Attack without the drawbacks of recoil.</p> <p>Diggersby best fits on offense teams, particularly ones that can offer entry hazard support.

Nihilego can help check problematic Pokemon like Rotom-H and defensive Salamence for Diggersby, and in return, Diggersby assists Nihilego by threatening Chansey. Togekiss is a good partner that can ease Diggersby's Speed issues with Thunder Wave and paralyze foes such as Tentacruel and Jirachi.

Draining Kiss aids Primarina in recovering HP, allowing it to take more hits and use Substitute if needed. However, Draining Kiss is a very weak move and will only pose a threat if Primarina has accumulated enough boosts. Moonblast, on the other hand, is powerful from the start and lets Primarina not rely too much on Calm Mind boosts to threaten Water-resistant Pokemon like Tangrowth and Rotom-W. Scald is a reliable Water-type move, capable of burning Pokemon trying to check it, like Tentacruel, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Leftovers compensates the 25% loss in HP from Substitute. With the given EV spread Primarina is able to beat Amoonguss one-on-one, as it ensures Amoonguss can't break Primarina's Substitute after a Calm Mind.</p> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind Primarina fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, as its ability to come in on moves like Draco Meteor from Salamence is greatly appreciated by other teammates. By switching on these moves, Primarina can either get a Substitute up or set up with Calm Mind if its checks have been eliminated or weakened. Strong wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Nidoking, and Aegislash can get past bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Electric-types such as Raikou and Thundurus-T force Primarina out of the field if it doesn't have a Substitute up, so Pokemon like Rhyperior and Seismitoad take care of them. They can also set Stealth Rock to aid Primarina in its sweep. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can take on strong physical attackers such as Diggersby and Mamoswine for Primarina. Chansey is extremely annoying, as it can take boosted hits with ease and threaten Primarina back with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Conkeldurr, Lycanroc-D, and Swords Dance Diggersby are powerful wallbreakers that can muscle through Chansey and remove it for Primarina.</p> "

It's also immune to secondary effects thanks to Shield Dust; this makes it impossible for Pokemon like Choice Scarf Jirachi to antilead it, and its access to Skill Swap means that not even Hatterene can prevent it from getting its entry hazard up. As a result, Ribombee is a cornerstone on Sticky Web teams as the best available setter. It can struggle with certain hazard removers that resist Moonblast, though; examples include Excadrill, Moltres, and Tentacruel.

Access to strong coverage moves, such as Close Combat to break past Excadrill, Psychic Fangs to break past Amoonguss, and Crunch to deal with Slowking makes Lycanroc-D very unpredictable to defensively answer. However, Lycanroc-D struggles to break through teams that run physically bulky threats such as Tangrowth, Hippowdon, Swampert, and Skarmory. Its poor bulk also means it cannot come in on almost anything, so it requires pivot support to come in safely as well as occasional aggressive prediction on expected switches. Lycanroc-D is also very prone to wearing itself down between entry hazards and Life Orb recoil, limiting its staying presence on the field. The presence of priority attackers like Scizor and Azumarill can easily pick off Lycanroc-D. Zygarde-10% gives Lycanroc-D fierce competition as a fast physical wallbreaker due to a Stealth Rock resistance, higher Speed, and less prediction reliance.</p> ",

Psychic Fangs inflicts heavy damage on the likes of Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and Keldeo. Crunch hits Slowking, Jirachi, and Galarian Slowbro harder, but these targets get musceled through by Stone Edge or Close Combat. Accelerock is useful against offense teams, specifically keeping threats such as Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados in check. It also makes Lycanroc-D more difficult to revenge kill with faster threats such as Starmie, Azelf, and Noivern which all need to watch their health against it. A Life Orb is used to guarantee feats such as 2HKOing defensive Celesteela with Close Combat and Amoonguss with Stone Edge on the switch with Stealth Rock up. Alternatively, Choice Band lets Lycanroc-D avoid the recoil associated with Life Orb while still boosting its power at the cost of being more predicition reliant.

Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is needed to make Lycanroc-D outspeed and threaten as many foes as it can, particularly Keldeo.</p> <p>Lycanroc-D fits best on offensive teams, namely VoltTurn and Spikes stacking, that appreciate its ability to revenge kill common offensive threats such as Salamence without sacrificing its teammates' wallbreaking capabilities.

Rotom-W takes on Skarmory and Celesteela for Lycanroc-D and can bring it in against Chansey and Hydreigon. Entry hazard setters like Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Nihilego are important to wear down defensive walls like Tangrowth and opposing Hippowdon in range of Lycanroc-D's attacks. Skarmory, mainly Iron Defense variants, also counters Scizor and Azumarill for Lycanroc-D. Hippowdon can cripple Tangrowth and Slowking with Toxic, while Nihilego pressures Skarmory. Special attackers such as Hydreigon and Primarina appreciate Lycanroc-D's ability to break through Chansey, and in return they can help wear down common physically defensive threats such as Skarmory for it, paving the way for a late-game cleanup. The Grass-types of the tier like Tangrowth and Zarude are excellent partners to handle threats such as Azumarill.

However, due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Salazzle is forced to run Heavy-Duty Boots as opposed to a power-boosting item, which makes it heavily reliant on chip damage to make an impact. Its poor bulk also leaves it unable to contribute defensively in most games, and its typing makes it susceptible to priority users like Azumarill and Lycanroc-D. Salazzle's frailty also makes it reliant on pivots to safely enter the battlefield. This frailty also deters it from switching directly into most Pokemon it would otherwise check, especially Scizor and Tangrowth, who both carry Knock Off and can remove its Heavy-Duty Boots. Therefore, it would rather be preserved as a secondary check to the aforementioned Pokemon. It is also extremely difficult for Salazzle to make progress against bulkier Pokemon like Slowking and Hippowdon, but its Toxic support and chip damage can help mid-game wallbreakers and offensive pivots like Mamoswine and Azelf, respectively, break through or pressure them.</p> ",

Its Grass typing allows it to absorb Thousand Arrows from Zygarde-10%, which otherwise heavily threatens the Spikes stacking teams Dhelmise finds itself on. Dhelmise possesses semi-reliable recovery via Synthesis, letting it keep itself healthy to spinblock and better check common threats like Keldeo, Primarina, and Thundurus-T throughout a game. Dhelmise has respectable offensive presence while spinblocking thanks to its naturally high Attack stat and good STAB combination.

Dhelmise faces stiff competition from Amoonguss and Tangrowth as a defensive Grass-type; these two have greater physical bulk, are able to keep themselves healthy with Regenerator, and possess additional utility in the form of Spore from Amoonguss and coverage options like Sludge Bomb and Focus Blast from Tangrowth.

However, this reduces Dhelmise's overall damage output. Body Press can hit Dark-types like Zarude and Hydreigon for super effective damage, but is generally not worth running over its STAB moves. Rest is an option to alleviate status from foes like Hippowdon, letting Dhelmise fear nothing from them, but Rest is more exploitable compared to Synthesis.

Umbreon does not resist Power Whip, but has access to Wish and enough bulk to take repeated hits, along with Toxic and Foul Play to threaten Dhelmise. Knock Off from Pokemon like Scizor, Azumarill, and Conkeldurr also threatens Dhelmise, especially if it is not holding a Colbur Berry, since it reduces Dhelmise's effectiveness as an entry hazard remover and spinblocker.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types like Crobat, Moltres, Salamence, and Togekiss threaten heavy damage or OHKOs on Dhelmise with their Flying-type STAB attacks. Celesteela threatens Dhelmise with Flamethrower on defensive sets and Air Slash and Fire Blast on offensive sets and has the bulk to repeatedly take Poltergeist from Dhelmise.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage: Moltres, Chandelure, and Rotom-H all threaten massive damage on Dhelmise with their STAB attacks. Several Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Azelf, and Diggersby commonly run Fire-type coverage, which prevents Dhelmise from reliably checking them.</p> <p><strong>Status: Scald burns from Pokemon like Slowking, Primarina, and Tentacruel as well as Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W reduce Dhelmise's damage output and force it to use Synthesis more often, reducing its effectiveness as a spinblocker and providing free turns for switching or set up when Dhelmise is forced to recover. Toxic from Pokemon like Hippowdon, Chansey, and Swampert forces it to recover even more frequently than burns do.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Rocky Helmet users like Amoonguss, Cobalion, and Skarmory punish Dhelmise for using Rapid Spin and have high enough Defense to take Poltergeist and Power Whip from Dhelmise many times if needed.

Stealth Rock setters like Nihilego and Chansey help to further accentuate entry hazard damage and appreciate Dhelmise taking on Excadrill.

Togekiss and the aforementioned Chansey can provide cleric support through Heal Bell and Aromatherapy, respectively, to rid Dhelmise of status and improve its longevity. Togekiss is notable for also being able to switch into and pressure Dark-types like Zarude and Hydreigon. Fast Electric-types like Raikou and Thundurus-T take advantage of Spikes well thanks to Volt Switch maintaining momentum and forcing Spikes damage on switch-ins, naturally pressuring Flying-types like Togekiss and Celesteela for Dhelmise.

Primarina can comfortably sponge any attack from Hydreigon, which Spikes teams often have difficulty switching into if they lack Chansey. Rotom-W can take on offensive variants of Celesteela and helps exert damage through Volt Switch. Dhelmise's teammates should be mindful of their Knock Off use, as Dhelmise will be unable to use Poltergeist against Pokemon that have had their items removed.</p> "

An Assault Vest set improves its matchup against the aforementioned foes while retaining an offensive presence; however, it can be easily overwhelmed by special attackers such as Primarina.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Chandelure is a relatively safe switch-in to Tapu Bulu's most spammable moves and threatens to OHKO it. Rotom-H has to be wary of taking Close Combat; however, it can threaten to OHKO with Overheat and use Tapu Bulu as a free Volt Switch or Defog opportunity. Moltres has to be wary of Stone Edge but otherwise freely switches into Tapu Bulu and threatens to burn it with Flame Body or KO it with a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Many of UU's more common Steel-types like Celesteela and Jirachi only take neutral damage from Close Combat and threaten to KO Tapu Bulu. Aegislash can comfortably stomach any hit in Shield forme and OHKO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Nihilego and Nidoking outspeed and OHKO Tapu Bulu with their Poison-type STAB. Without Darkest Lariat, Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro sets up on it with ease. Amoonguss threatens to OHKO Tapu Bulu with Sludge Bomb, though it has to be wary of +2 Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Physically defensive Tangrowth stomachs any attack barring a +2 Megahorm and OHKOes Tapu Bulu with Sludge Bomb. Salamence is a huge issue for Tapu Bulu, as it resists the coverage it commonly carries and pressures it with Flying-type attacks, though it has to be wary of Stone Edge. Intimidate makes it much easier for Salamence to stomach any hit from Tapu Bulu. Defensive Buzzwole can stomach any attack and KO Tapu Bulu with Poison Jab.</p> ",

Zen Headbutt breaks through Amoonguss, Kommo-o, and Buzzwole. Megahorn can help against Tangrowth; however, its coverage isn't very useful otherwise.

Rotom-W can also remove foes like Moltres and wear down Kommo-o and Amoonguss into KO range of Tapu Bulu's attacks. Other wallbreakers like Conkeldurr and Nidoking can help break through defensive cores that Tapu Bulu struggles with. Keldeo appreciates Tapu Bulu being able to lure in and remove bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Tentacruel is appreciated as another Water-resistant Pokemon, as Tapu Bulu doesn't want to risk a burn from Keldeo's Scald, for example. Although Tapu Bulu is a Fairy-type, it struggles to consistently check a majority of Dragon-types, such as Salamence and Kommo-o, due to its lack of a good Fairy-type attack and its weakness to their common coverage.

Its good STAB combination hits key Pokemon such as Thundurus-T, Salamence, Tangrowth, and Primarina super effectively. It has important resistances like Flying, Fairy, and Fire; its Flying resistance and high Special Defense in particular are appreciated by teams that struggle with Flying-types like Moltres and Togekiss. Nihilego is an amazing Stealth Rock setter, as its resistances give very good matchups against Defoggers such as Salamence, Moltres, and Mandibuzz. Its Knock Off is useful for common switch-ins like Chansey, Scizor, Excadrill, and Celesteela. It can use Meteor Beam as well to boost its Special Attack and become a fierce sweeper. Its unique Speed tier puts it ahead of Salamence, Thundurus-T, and Moltres, and after a Speed boost from Beast Boost, it only falls behind Choice Scarf Zarude. However, its weaknesses and horrid Defense stat leave it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Cobalion, and Keldeo, and priority from the likes of Conkeldurr, Azumarill, and Scizor easily shuts it down. It lacks room for coverage for Pokemon like Nidoking, and it just cannot get past checks like Jirachi and Excadrill.</p> ",

Toxic Spikes is a secondary entry hazard option that weakens defensive staples like Swampert and cripples Substitute users such as Primarina. However, Poison-types remove it and a large portion of the metagame is immune to it, like Salamence, Celesteela, and Scizor. A Choice Scarf set with Power Gem / Sludge Bomb / Thunderbolt / Grass Knot lets Nihilego clean through teams and revenge kill Pokemon like Crobat and other Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon, but Choice-locked Nihilego is vulnerable to Pokemon like Scizor and Azumarill. Pain Split can be considered as a form of recovery on the utility set, but it is very unreliable due to Nihilego's high HP and can only be used against special attackers that can't hurt it much.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is Nihilego's best answer, capable of wearing it down with Seismic Toss and healing itself with Soft-Boiled. As long as Chansey doesn't let it accumulate several boosts, it can always beat Nihilego. Chansey hates having its Eviolite removed, though.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, and Swampert don't care about Nihilego's STAB moves and can force it out of the field with their STAB Ground-type moves, but the latter two dislike getting hit with Knock Off. Zygarde-10% and Choice Scarf Diggersby outspeeds and OHKOes Nihilego.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Excadrill and Jirachi wall Nihilego easily and can scare it out with their STAB attacks.

    "overview": "<p>Celesteela's typing and defensive stats are both fantastic in UU, allowing it to check a considerable portion of UU's top threats, including Salamence, Scizor, Diggersby, Hippowdon, Nihilego, and Excadrill. Thanks to its decent offensive stats, powerful STAB Heavy Slam, and access to Flamethrower to smack foes like Amoonguss and Zarude, Celesteela can prevent itself from being too passive. Leech Seed is also an excellent tool, sustaining Celesteela's longevity and allowing it to significantly wear down its switch-ins, such as Rotom-H and Thundurus-T, potentially forcing them out, while Toxic lures and cripples otherwise safe switch-ins like Rotom-W, Slowking, and Moltres. Celesteela can also operate with an Autotomize set, tapping into its strong special coverage and the sweeping potential Beast Boost lends it to clean through many unprepared teams. Despite its defensive potency, however, Celesteela suffers a bit from its lack of access to reliable recovery, which can prevent it from tanking strong neutral hits as consistently as it would like to and cause it to be overreliant on Leftovers. This can allow a few common Pokemon, such as Hydreigon and Mamoswine, to muscle past Celesteela after relatively minimal chip damage. Celesteela also struggles to bypass popular Fire- and Electric-types such as Moltres and Thundurus-T on its own, as well as various defensive picks like Tentacruel and Slowking; Tentacruel can utilize Liquid Ooze to take advantage of Leech Seed, while Slowking doesn't take meaningful damage from any of Celesteela's attacks, can absorb Leech Seed and Teleport out, and can threaten to chip Celesteela down with burns from Scald.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flash Cannon is an option over Air Slash for Celesteela's Meteor Beam set, dealing super effective damage to common answers like Nihilego. Meanwhile, Giga Drain lets it bypass Rotom-W and Slowking easier. However, these moves are much harder to fit compared to Air Slash's ability to flinch down slower checks like Moltres. Celesteela can utilize a mixed Assault Vest set to better answer Primarina and Salamence, with its colorful movepool letting it surprise typical checks such as Slowking with Megahorn and Moltres with Stone Edge and potentially break large holes in the opposing team. Due to its selection of potent physical moves such as Earthquake and Stone Edge, Celesteela can also run a physically based Autotomize set, effectively luring checks like Tentacruel and Rotom-H. However, this generally isn't as effective due to Celesteela's middling immediate power and hardships breaking various Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types like Moltres, Rotom-H, and Chandelure can pivot in on both Heavy Slam and Flamethrower and hit Celesteela hard with super effective STAB moves. Moltres is particularly annoying, often being able to restore any chip damage it sustains from Leech Seed with Roost. However, they must run from Meteor Beam on Celesteela's Autotomize set.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Raikou can tank hits from either of Celesteela's sets and proceed to break past it with super effective STAB attacks, though they all take fair damage from Meteor Beam.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Chansey doesn't take major damage from Celesteela's attacks and can whittle it down with Seismic Toss or bring in a teammate with Teleport. Tentacruel's Liquid Ooze punishes Leech Seed attempts and it doesn't take major damage from any attack Celesteela commonly runs. Slowking can pivot into Celesteela and Teleport out to stop Leech Seed or chip it with Scald.

Dark-types like Hydreigon and Mandibuzz are problematic for this set, so wallbreakers like Cobalion and Azumarill can remove them. They both also threaten Chansey and overwhelm Slowking. Togekiss also counters these Dark-types and can rid Necrozma of status with Heal Bell. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Nihilego and the aforementioned Cobalion wears down threats like Hydreigon and Primarina. Similarly, entry hazard removers like Salamence, Rotom-W, and Tentacruel are great for keeping Necrozma from getting worn down, allowing it to conserve Moonlight PP when absolutely needed. Tentacruel can remove items from threats like Chansey with Knock Off and check Celesteela, while Salamence handles Zarude. Pivots like the previously mentioned Rotom-W and Zarude can bring Necrozma in against Pokemon it can set up on like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Scizor. They both also can shut down Hippowdon. Choice Scarf Hydreigon can revenge kill faster threats to Necrozma like Zarude as well as check Slowking. Assault Vest Tangrowth can serve as a great defensive pivot for Necrozma, switching in on powerful wallbreakers like Keldeo and Primarina.</p> "

  "Toxtricity": {
    "overview": "<p>Toxtricity carries a unique niche in UU as a fearsome Electric-type wallbreaker that isn't shut down by the tier's Grass- and Ground-types. Thanks to Punk Rock and Boomburst, Toxtricity is able to deal heavy damage to walls like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Celesteela and maintain pressure on Pokemon that resist its STAB combination, such as Hippowdon and Swampert. In addition, Toxtricity has a relatively decent defensive typing, allowing it to come in on Iron Head from Jirachi and Close Combat from Cobalion and threaten to 2HKO them. It can also pivot into various passive Pokemon such as Togekiss and Amoonguss. However, Toxtricity is incredibly frail, leaving it with limited opportunities to fire off attacks and enter the field safely, relying on additional pivots to get in. Although Toxtricity's base 75 Speed is enough to outspeed the bulkier threats it is able to deal with, its bulk leaves it prey to revenge killers such as Thundurus-T, Excadrill, Azelf, and Hydreigon. Toxtricity faces stiff competition as an offensive Poison- or Electric-type with Nihilego and Thundurus-T, which offer better coverage and Speed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shift Gear sets with Drain Punch turn Toxtricity into a potent late-game sweeper that can set up on common threats like Cobalion and Chansey. However, Toxtricity is very frail and doesn't set up often, leaving outclassed by other sweepers like Meteor Beam Nihilego. Choice Scarf turns Toxtricity into a revenge killer that is able to outpace threats such as Keldeo and Azelf while still having a Special Attack-boosting nature. Throat Spray is an option on Shift Gear sets, as long as Sludge Bomb or Sludge Wave is used over Drain Punch.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey can take Toxtricity’s strongest offensive moves with ease. It can heal itself with Soft-Boiled as Toxtricty switches out, keep momentum with Teleport, and spread status with Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro can directly counter Toxtricity, comfortably switching into Boomburst and forcing Toxtricity to switch out. Furthermore, Regenerator allows it to heal off most of Boomburst’s damage and consistently switch into Toxtricity. Azelf and Necrozma are faster than Toxtricity and threaten to OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Nidoqueen are immune to Overdrive and threaten to KO Toxtricity with their STAB attacks. However, they can all get 2HKOed by Boomburst.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Toxtricity's low Speed and poor natural bulk leave it prey to Pokemon that outspeed it naturally, such as Hydreigon, Keldeo, Salamence, and Thundurus-T.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Boomburst is the most powerful move on this set, heavily damaging Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Nidoqueen and wearing down switch-ins without recovery like Excadrill. Volt Switch is Toxtricity’s way of generating momentum against threats that Toxtricity cannot break through, like Chansey. Since Overdrive + Boomburst covers the entire UU metagame, Shift Gear can be used to boost Toxtricity's Speed and outrun revenge killers like Azelf. Sleep Talk is another option to absorb Spore from Amoonguss and still function as a wallbreaker. Sludge Wave can be used for immediate KOes on Fairy- and Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu, Hatterene, and Tangrowth, though they all hate taking Boomburst. Sludge Bomb is a viable alternative over Sludge Wave to poison and wear down switch-ins like Hippowdon and Swampert. Silk Scarf amplifies the power of Toxtricity's Boomburst, increasing its spammability and giving it good odds to 2HKO Normal-resistant foes like Skarmory and Cobalion. Air Baloon is an option to take advantage of Hippowdon since Toxtricity is immune to Toxic. Heavy-Duty Boots prevent Toxtricity from being worn down by entry hazards. A Modest nature is preferred to maximize Toxtricity's power against foes like Hippowdon and Cobalion, but a Timid nature can be used to outpace Adamant Gyarados and Mamoswine if needed.</p> <p>Toxtricity fits on offensive teams as an early-game wallbreaker that can break down common defensive cores of Pokemon like Hippowdon, Tangrowth, and Salamence and open up its teammates. Toxtricity appreciates entry hazard support from setters such as Excadrill and Hippowdon to punish and accumulate chip damage on vulnerable checks such as Nihilego. Toxtricity can compliment these entry hazard setters by threatening to 2HKO entry hazard removers like Salamence and Rotom-W. Additionally, Toxtricity appreciates Pokemon that can threaten to KO and force out specially defensive walls. Keldeo is a prime example of a wallbreaker that excels at dealing with Ground-types like Hippowdon and forcing out Chansey thanks to Secret Sword. Pokemon that take on Excadrill and Zygarde-10%, such as Tangrowth, Salamence, and Zarude, make great partners. Zarude’s U-turn, combined with Toxtricity's ability to break its checks like Skarmory and Cobalion, yields another VoltTurn core that Toxtricity benefits from. Slowking can pivot into revenge killers like Azelf, Keldeo, and Noivern and bring Toxtricity in safely with Teleport to freely wallbreak. Late-game cleaners like Azelf and Scizor enjoy Toxtricity removing threats like Mandibuzz and Salamence so they can finish off the enemy team. They also form momentum cores with it and pressure offensive checks like Keldeo and Mamoswine.</p> "

  "Hatterene": {
    "overview": "<p>Hatterene is an imposing Calm Mind user for defensive teams to deal with because its ability Magic Bounce deflects status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave, as well as phazing attempts. Hatterene's STAB moves complement each other brilliantly and, alongside Mystical Fire, give it good matchups against entry hazard setters such as Swampert and Skarmory to block their hazards with Magic Bounce and keep pressure off of its teammates. Hatterene's solid bulk lets it take on threatens that can even hit it super effectively like Scizor. Hatterene's typing, while offensively potent, makes it a Fairy-type that's hit neutrally by Dark-type moves and a Psychic-type weak to Poison. This greatly impedes Hatterene's ability to consistently handle Pokemon such as Hydreigon and makes it unreliable at pressuring Tentacruel and Nihilego. It also struggles to beat Steel-types such as Jirachi and Celesteela if it does not catch them with Mystical Fire on the switch. Without a Calm Mind boost, Hatterene noticeably lacks offensive presence, which can be taken advantage of by wallbreakers such as Diggersby and Choice Specs Primarina. While it does have some good matchups against some hazard setters, it also has poor ones, such as against Hippowdon and Nidoqueen, so it can require prediction to make the most out of Magic Bounce. Excadrill is a hazard setter that not only forces out Hatterene but can completely ignore Magic Bounce thanks to Mold Breaker. Hatterene's dismal Speed tier greatly limits what it can accomplish against offensive teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On Trick Room teams, Hatterene is an effective suicide lead with Focus Sash and Misty Explosion. Magic Bounce denies entry hazards from everything bar Excadrill, and using Misty Explosion right after Trick Room gives a safe entry point for teammates such as Crawdaunt with three turns of Trick Room still remaining. Hatterene can also be an offensive threat in Trick Room with Life Orb, but this sacrifices a lot of consistency in defensive utility because of its need for Special Attack investment and Life Orb recoil. Assault Vest alongside Nuzzle is an option to make Hatterene more bulky without a boost while still crippling the likes of Jirachi, but it faces stiff competition from Reuniclus, which has more consistent healing with Regenerator and better bulk to handle threats such as Keldeo.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Hatterene's poor Speed, lack of consistent recovery, and reliance on a Calm Mind boost to be a consistent threat makes it easy for Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Diggersby, and Crawdaunt to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Jirachi takes little damage from Hatterene's STAB moves and threatens it back with Iron Head, though it dislikes Mystical Fire. Excadrill and Cobalion similarly take Mystical Fire well and can KO it with Iron Head. Scizor can deal heavy damage to Hatterene with Bullet Punch, though Hatterene does need to be fairly chipped for it to KO. Celesteela does not take too much damage from Mystical Fire due to its massive special bulk, and it 2HKOes with Heavy Slam.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Hatterene has plenty of opportunities to gain a Calm Mind boost against various Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Salamence. Calm Mind notably helps Hatterene stomach hits from strong attackers such as Choice Specs Keldeo better and retaliate with Draining Kiss. Draining Kiss is mandatory as a powerful recovery tool and is instrumental against Chansey; after three boosts, Draining Kiss + Leftovers will outheal Seismic Toss's damage. Psyshock is useful against opposing Calm Mind users, most notably Primarina, as well as a more immediate weapon against Chansey. Psychic is an alternative option because it OHKOes Amoonguss after one Calm Mind boost instead of two. It also helps Hatterene pressure Quagsire better with Special Defense drops. Mystical Fire is vital to deter Steel-types looking to come in on a Calm Mind or STAB move like Celesteela, Jirachi, and Scizor. Leftovers augments the recovery from Draining Kiss and makes Hatterene harder for Pokemon such as Suicune to wear down. Hatterene needs 12 EVs in Speed to outrun Amoonguss and 56 EVs to outspeed Quagsire and help against stall, though Psychic is required for the latter Pokemon.</p> <p>Hatterene fits well on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its Magic Bounce relieving entry hazard pressure from Skarmory. Pokemon that handle hazard setters Hatterene cannot switch into well like Nidoqueen, Jirachi, and Nihilego are appreciated. Chansey and Celesteela are able to check them. Celesteela can also pivot into Excadrill. Hazard support from teammates such as Krookodile and Chansey wears down Hatterene checks such as Scizor and Celesteela. Fire-types can blow through Steel-types that Hatterene has issues with; Rotom-H and Moltres are notably able to check Scizor and take advantage of Celesteela. Amoonguss and Skarmory can act as secondary pivots into Conkeldurr as repeatedly taking hits from them and losing its Leftovers greatly diminishes Hatterene's ability to clean with Calm Mind.</p> "

It is completely outclassed as a Guts user by Conkeldurr, which has much higher Attack, ability to cover nearly the entire metagame in four moveslots, STAB Fighting-type attacks to nail Cobalion — which Obstagoon can't touch — and priority in Mach Punch. Moreover, its middling Speed leaves it outsped by many common foes like Keldeo, Azelf, and Zarude.

Unfortunately, the inconsistency when calling moves can make it tough to use when asleep. Due to Obstagoon's lack of coverage, it gives free set up opportunities to Cobalion, making it very difficult for it to force progress against most teams. Obstagoon can run a set with Close Combat and Switcheroo or Obstruct over RestTalk to remedy its coverage issues and cripple defensive Salamence, but this leaves it far more vulnerable to chip damage than it already was. Conkeldurr's better bulk and coverage make it a much more straightforward Pokemon to use. Obstagoon's higher Speed doesn't justify its far lower damage output as well, killing any viability it has.</p> "

Swampert is an entry hazard setter that appreciates Zarude dealing with Keldeo, Gyarados, and Hydreigon for it, while Swampert can set Stealth Rock in return and also help deal with Pokemon like Salamence. Primarina and Azumarill can help deal with some of Zarude's checks such as Salamence.</p> "
