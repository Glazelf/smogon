  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Venusaur is a phenomenal sun sweeper in the current UU tier. Venusaur's defensive typing lets it set up on many common Pokemon like Tangrowth, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W, allowing it to clean teams with its Growth boots. With moves like Giga Drain for reliable recovery, a powerful 100-Base Power and sun-boosted Weather Ball, and Sludge Bomb or Earth Power, Venusaur is able to punch holes in many teams, as with a boost it 2HKOes nearly every Pokemon in the tier, barring Bulletproof Kommo-o and Chansey. With a Modest nature, it outspeeds every relevant Pokemon in the tier under sun except +2 Galarian Moltres. However, Venusaur is severely limited if sun is no longer active, being outsped and KOed by plenty of Pokemon like Salamence, Azelf, and Thundurus-T or used as setup bait for Pokemon like Galarian Moltres, Kommo-o, and Necrozma. Without a boost, Venusaur can sometimes be too weak to sweep, as common Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres are able to survive an unboosted hit and OHKO it back. Lastly, priority users such as Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine can pick off a weakened Venusaur.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Knock Off can be used to remove Chansey's Eviolite while also nailing Nihilego and Chandelure, but generally Venusaur benefits much more from its other moves; it can OHKO Nihilego and Chandelure with Earth Power, and after enough boosts from Growth it can damage Chansey with Giga Drain and outheal the damage done by Seismic Toss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: If Venusaur chooses to not run Earth Power, both Chandelure and Incineroar can stomach any of Venusaur's hits at +2 and take it out with a Fire-type attack. Rotom-H and Moltres are other Pokemon that can take an unboosted Sludge Bomb from Venusaur and KO it back with their Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Kommo-o: Kommo-o resists Giga Drain and is immune to Sludge Bomb and Weather Ball thanks to Bulletproof, so it can switch in and set up Stealth Rock, KO Venusaur outright, or use it as setup fodder if it's an offensive variant.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Special walls such as Chansey and Umbreon can take any of Venusaur's hits and stall out sun turns, with the former using Soft-Boiled and wearing it down with Seismic Toss and the latter being able to keep itself healthy with Wish + Protect and hit Venusaur hard with Foul Play due to Growth's attack boosts. Both Assault Vest Reuniclus and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro can take a +2 hit and KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Zygarde-10%, Lycanroc-D, and Mamoswine can revenge kill Venusaur using their priority moves if Venusaur is worn down, which can happen due to Venusaur sometimes having to take a hit to set up Growth while also dealing with Life Orb recoil.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weathers: Venusaur's sweeping capabilities can be halted by weather setters such as Alolan Ninetales and Pelipper cancelling Chlorophyll. This forces Venusaur out and Torkoal back in to reactivate sun, which can be taken advantage of by the opponent. Torkoal is also severely weakened by Stealth Rock if it has to come in multiple times during a game, and if it faints, Venusaur becomes dead weight.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Growth is a powerful setup move under sun, boosting Venusaur's Special Attack by 2 stages and allowing it to 2HKO nearly all the Pokemon in the tier. It can set up on popular Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Quagsire, and Tapu Bulu due to its typing, and then sweep through opposing teams. Giga Drain hits Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Primarina, Krookodile, and Rhyperior super effectively. Weather Ball is Venusaur's main attacking move under sun, as its Base Power becomes 100 and is boosted by the sun, KOing Steel-types that resist Giga Drain like Celesteela, Aegislash, and Jirachi. Sludge Bomb hits Pokemon that resist Giga Drain and Weather Ball like Salamence and Rotom-H while also hitting Fairy-types like Hatterene super effectively, though it will need a boost to OHKO the former two. Earth Power is an alternative option to hit Bulletproof Kommo-o, which resists or is immune to all of Venusaur's attacks, and has the added benefit of hitting Tentacruel, Chandelure, and Nihilego harder, but this leaves Venusaur susceptible to Salamence, as Giga Drain and Weather Ball are mandatory moves. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed ensures Venusaur is as strong and fast as possible. A Modest nature is typically used to maximize damage output while still nearly outspeeding everything under the sun, but a Timid nature can be used to outspeed +2 Galarian Moltres if needed. Life Orb is used to boost Venusaur's damage output, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Salamence, and Nidoqueen after a boost, while a boost to Giga Drain gives Venusaur insane damage output and reliable recovery, making it an unstoppable force.</p> <p>Venusaur only fits on sun teams, so Torkoal is a mandatory partner, as it is the most reliable sun setter in the tier. It provides the team with entry hazard support and entry hazard control with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, respectively. Other Pokemon that take advantage of sun like Chandelure and Charizard break holes in enemy teams thanks to their powerful wallbreaking capabilities amplified by sun, allowing Venusaur to sweep much more easily. Venusaur also appreciates momentum such as Teleport from Chansey to help it get in safely as well as give it more opportunities to set up; for example Chansey can bring Venusaur in on physical attackers like Krookodile and Azumarill, which are forced out by it under sun. Hatterene can be run as a Kommo-o check and discourages entry hazards from being set so Torkoal can come in more, allowing Venusaur to sweep more easily. Lastly, an offensive Kommo-o of your own can help the team deal with Pokemon like Chandelure while also giving it an easier matchup against Chansey.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen is an exceptional wallbreaker and capable entry hazard setter because Life Orb and Sheer Force let it 2HKO the entire UU metagame bar Chansey and bulky Galarian Moltres. Its solid defensive typing also lets it check Pokemon such as Nihilego and discourage common Electric-types such as Rotom-H from using Volt Switch. However, Nidoqueen can struggle to pivot into Electric-types like Raikou and Thundurus-T that commonly carry super-effective coverage to break through it. Unfortunately, Nidoqueen's overreliance on its Life Orb leaves it susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would pivot into like Nihilego. A low Speed stat gives Nidoqueen an undesirable matchup versus faster-paced teams, and although Nidoqueen sports a quality defensive typing, it is still weak to common Pokemon in the tier such as Mamoswine and Keldeo. These struggles sting a bit more because Nidoqueen has no form of reliable recovery, meaning it is worn down pretty quickly throughout a match. Lastly, Nidoqueen faces severe competition from its counterpart Nidoking, who sports better offenses and a higher speed tier, making it preferred on most teams. Still, Nidoqueen's better bulk and role compression as an entry hazard setter gives it a role on certain teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nidoqueen can run a bulkier set holding Black Sludge, as it can somewhat take advantage of its bulk and defensive typing to better check Lycanroc-D lacking Psychic Fangs and Mienshao and do a better job setting up entry hazards, but this set struggles because it is somewhat weak. Taunt does a decent job of giving utility Pokemon like Chansey a hard time. Substitute can be a viable option to ease prediction on a forced switch. Protect also helps prediction by letting Nidoqueen scout Choice-locked Pokemon it is weak to such as Krookodile and Jirachi.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is the single best answer to Nidoqueen, as it can consistently switch into its attacks without worry, recover any damage away, and chip Nidoqueen with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Azelf, Necrozma, and Starmie all can outspeed and KO Nidoqueen, with Necrozma being able to live a hit and use it as set up fodder thanks to its high natural bulk.

Earth Power and Sludge Wave are mandatory, powerful STAB moves that OHKO bulkier Pokemon such as Aegislash, Hatterene, and Tangrowth. Fire Blast is an excellent coverage move and the best pick for the last slot, as it almost OHKOes Amoonguss and cleanly 2HKOes Celesteela. Modest is the preferred nature because it grants Nidoqueen exceptional power and still lets it outspeed most of its primary targets, although a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Buzzwole, Timid Volcanion, and Timid Toxtricity. However, a Timid nature will make Nidoqueen noticeably weaker, missing out on benchmarks such as the guaranteed 2HKO on defensive Kommo-o.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu pairs very well with Nidoqueen, as it appreciates Nidoqueen taking care of Amoonguss and Tangrowth and in return can check Water-types like Azumarill, Starmie, and Keldeo.

Wallbreakers such as Azumarill and Lycanroc-D make good teammates because they also appreciate Nidoqueen's good matchup versus Amoonguss and Tangrowth. In return, they can remove specially defensive walls like Chansey and Galarian Moltres. Starmie is a decent teammate for Nidoqueen because it checks many Pokemon that threaten Nidoqueen, such as Keldeo. Rotom-H and Rotom-W are both Volt Switch users that can bring Nidoqueen in safely and also check Mamoswine, and the latter has the added benefit of checking Krookodile. Nidoqueen pairs well with almost any Kommo-o set, as Nidoqueen can break through Primarina and Hatterene to help it succeed.

Its great Speed tier allows it to set up Aurora Veil in front of common Pokemon like Keldeo and Zarude, and its access to support moves like Hypnosis allows it to gain momentum with a free switch and bring in frail sweepers like Diggersby and Thundurus-T more easily. Sadly, Ice / Fairy is not a great defensive typing, as Alolan Ninetales will drop easily to both offensive and defensive variants of Steel-types like Aegislash, Jirachi, and Celesteela, making it difficult to consistently get Aurora Veil up against some teams. Additionally, a lot of common leads can give Alolan Ninetales a hard time, such as Lycanroc-D, and Choice Scarf Jirachi KO it before it can set up Aurora Veil. Furthermore, the presence of rain in the metagame can hinder Alolan Ninetales's ability to set up Aurora Veil at times.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Alolan Ninetales has access to Nasty Plot, which can significantly boost its offensive presence while maintaining some bulk investment.

Encore can give a safe switch to gain momentum for any of Alolan Ninetales's teammates. It also can be used to shut down Pokemon that attempt to set up, such as Substitute Primarina and Swords Dance Aegislash.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Alolan Ninetales is in big trouble against any Steel-type Pokemon, in particular Choice Scarf Jirachi, which will OHKO it with Iron Head before it can set up Aurora Veil.

Rotom-H is a great Defogger against Alolan Ninetales, as it takes negligible damage from Freeze-Dry and can remove Aurora Veil immediately once it is set up, as well as threaten Alolan Ninetales with Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Alolan Ninetales struggles against Pokemon that are faster and can threaten to KO it or hinder its ability to properly set up Aurora Veil. Lycanroc-D and Jolly Scolipede are faster and can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Weather Changers: Weather teams, in particular sun teams with Torkoal and rain teams with Pelipper, will give Alolan Ninetales a hard time trying to keep Aurora Veil up.

Moonblast allows Alolan Ninetales to OHKO Crawdaunt, Buzzwole, and Kommo-o. Hypnosis can be used to put Pokemon to sleep that threaten to remove Aurora Veil with Defog or after Aurora Veil is up to allow you to safely switch in one of your sweepers. It also can be used to cripple Steel-types like Aegislash that threaten to KO Alolan Ninetales, but at 60% accuracy, this is very risky.

Heavy-Duty Boots allows Alolan Ninetales to ignore entry hazards and come in as much as possible to set Aurora Veil.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales fits exclusively on hyper offense teams, as only these teams can maximize the utility offered from Aurora Veil. Azumarill is typically a great partner, since it can help check Lycanroc-D with Aqua Jet. Azumarill can also use Belly Drum more easily under Aurora Veil and proceed to clean out most of the enemy team, as it no longer has to rely exclusively on Aqua Jet while Aurora Veil is up. Alolan Ninetales struggles against all Steel-type Pokemon, including slower ones like Celesteela, which can OHKO it through Aurora Veil. A partner like Krookodile or Nasty Plot Thundurus-T can help ease the pressure from these foes, the former also being able to support its teammates with Stealth Rock. Other good teammates include offensive Steel-types like Autotomize Celesteela and Swords Dance Aegislash, which can set up very easily under Aurora Veil to begin a sweep. Aegislash especially appreciates this as it can potentially activate a Weakness Policy more easily. Clangorous Soul Kommo-o and Dragon Dance Gyarados can also attempt to boost more than once under Aurora Veil.

Raikou and Rotom-W can use Volt Switch on Grass-types and offensively check Chandelure. Galarian Slowbro appreciates Mienshao and Buzzwole checking Dark-types such as Krookodile and Crawdaunt. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Salamence and Rotom-W is needed.

    "overview": "<p>Chansey's sky-high, Eviolite-boosted special bulk allows it to wall nearly every special attacker in UU, including fearsome threats such as Nidoking and Primarina. In addition, Chansey can withstand certain physical attacks from setup sweepers like Gyarados and Salamence before they are sufficiently boosted and cripple them with Toxic. Chansey is also hard to wear down, since it has Soft-Boiled for HP recovery and Natural Cure to remove status ailments. It also has many utility moves such as Teleport, Stealth Rock, and Heal Bell to support its team. However, Chansey is rather passive, as it relies on Seismic Toss and Toxic to deal damage. As a result, many Pokemon such as Aegislash, Galarian Slowbro, and Reuniclus, easily take advantage of Chansey. Without Teleport, Chansey is a huge momentum drain for non-stall teams. Chansey's typing provides few useful resistances, and Chansey by itself must rely on its bulk to keep threats in check. Since it is unable to use Heavy-Duty Boots, Chansey is vulnerable to every entry hazard, meaning it gets overwhelmed by them quickly. Chansey is also susceptible to Knock Off and Trick, as without Eviolite, it is harder for Chansey to keep threats in check.</p> ",

For example, after Stealth Rock, Assault Vest Tangrowth is no longer 2HKOed by Choice Specs Primarina's Moonblast at -1. Toxic is Moltres's main way of harming foes like Rotom-W, Salamence, and Kommo-o. Substitute gives Moltres a decoy against moves like Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Rhyperior's Stone Edge and lets it PP stall them.

The former likes Moltres crippling Primarina and Rhyperior, while the latter appreciates Moltres threatening Tangrowth and crippling Milotic and Quagsire. Chansey takes care of the special attackers Moltres can't handle, like Nihilego and Thundurus-T. On stall teams, Umbreon provides cleric support with Heal Bell and Wish, and it also deals with Gyarados. Quagsire walls Electric- and Rock-types like Rotom-H and Lycanroc-D, and Amoonguss acts as a Knock Off absorber and secondary check to Keldeo and Primarina.

    "overview": "<p>Galarian Moltres is both an offensive and defensive threat in UU. Its fantastic bulk and defensive typing allow Galarian Moltres to fill a defensive role by using a RestTalk set that is one of the few Pokemon capable of defeating all variations of Aegislash. Such sets can almost singlehandedly defeat stall teams and perform as a great status absorber to the omnipresent Amoonguss and Chansey. Galarian Moltres can also run a more offensive set on hyper offense with Nasty Plot and Agility. Coupled with STAB attacks that provide near-perfect coverage, Galarian Moltres can be remarkably hard to stop after it sets up. However, having only base 100 Special Attack can prevent Galarian Moltres from breaking through specially bulky Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Nihilego, even when boosted. Galarian Moltres also requires two turns to set up if a Weakness Policy is not used or activated, which leaves it vulnerable to Taunt and status afflictions. Using RestTalk can make Galarian Moltres too passive when first entering a battle, so the set can be challenging to fit onto teams due to how often it invites wallbreakers such as Azumarill and Kommo-o to come in. Lastly, despite an overall good defensive typing, Galarian Moltres is weak to common priority moves such as Lycanroc-D's Accelerock and Mamoswine's Ice Shard.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt is a passable option on either set, but it has a huge opportunity cost over any of the listed moves. Forgoing a STAB or boosting move for Substitute is an option on the Double Dance set to give Galarian Moltres a better matchup against offensive teams, and it can even function decently alongside Salac Berry or Petaya Berry depending on which boosting move is being used, but overall is less reliable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Lycanroc-D and Rhyperior pose a huge threat to Galarian Moltres; Lycanroc-D can halt a sweep with priority Accelerock, and Rhyperior can tank a hit and wear Moltres down with Rock Blast or Toxic. Nihilego and Diancie also serve as great checks, as the former can take any boosted attack and retaliate with a Rock-type STAB attack, while the latter flat out counters Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Azumarill and Primarina are capable of OHKOing either Galarian Moltres set. Bulkier variants of Primarina can take boosted Hurricane to boot. Diancie can hit Moltres hard with Diamond Storm and shrug off any attack Galarian Moltres tries to hit it with.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Raikou and Thundurus-T OHKO or heavily dent Galarian Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Powerful priority moves, with the exception of Sucker Punch, are some of the quickest ways to halt a Galarian Moltres's sweep. Most notably, Lycanroc-D's Accelerock and Mamoswine's Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: If Galarian Moltres has Taunt used on it, it will be unable to set up with its offensive set or recover and attack with Sleep Talk on its bulky set. Krookodile is a common Taunt user that can outspeed Galarian Moltres and prevent it from using setup or recovery moves. Most Taunt users can usually only proactively halt Galarian Moltres from making progress, however, as either set can do a lot of damage to them when boosted.</p> ",

Nasty Plot is an option over Hurricane, as it provides the necessary power to overwhelm Pokemon like Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro. Rest and Sleep Talk allow Galarian Moltres to effectively check foes like Aegislash, absorb status, and lets it accumulate Berserk boosts.

Galarian Moltres can help Azumarill by providing an ideal matchup against Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Assault Vest Tangrowth can help check Electric-types like Thundurus-T that can take advantage of Galarian Moltres, especially after using Rest. Buzzwole is a great partner that can help check foes like Lycanroc-D, Cobalion, and Obstagoon, as well as act as a better Knock Off absorber against the likes of Krookodile. In return, Galarian Moltres can check Pokemon like Amoonguss and Aegislash that limit Buzzwole from spamming its STAB moves. Diancie can provide Heal Bell support to wake Galarian Moltres up after it has used Rest. Steel-types like Jirachi and Aegislash are extremely important partners, checking one of Moltres-Galar's biggest checks in Nihilego.

Fiery Wrath's flinch chance also can give Galarian Moltres chances to break through bulkier Pokemon that can tank its attacks such as Chansey. Air Slash is an option over Hurricane if accuracy concerns arise. Weakness Policy is the optimal item for this set, as the most effective way to take down Galarian Moltres is a super effective attack, meaning it activates a decent amount of the time and gives Galarian Moltres exceptional power when coupled with Nasty Plot. Using Weakness Policy can also create opportunities for Galarian Moltres to set up in one turn by using Agility as a super effective attack hits it. Heavy-Duty Boots is also a viable item choice, as preventing Stealth Rock damage can make it much more challenging for an opponent to take down Galarian Moltres.</p> <p>Double Dance Galarian Moltres fits almost exclusively on hyper offense teams.

Belly Drum Azumarill can fill this role; in return, Galarian Moltres has a great matchup against Grass-types that trouble Azumarill. Gyarados and Swords Dance Aegislash are also decent picks on hyper offense teams that can break through special tanks. Alolan Ninetales can provide Aurora Veil support to give Galarian Moltres an easier time setting up as it becomes exceptionally difficult to take down behind screens.</p> "

It can also utilize a Belly Drum set to be a scary late-game cleaner. Water / Fairy is a great offensive typing, allowing Azumarill to beat key threats like Krookodile and Keldeo. Access to great coverage moves such as Knock Off and Ice Punch lets Azumarill break past Pokemon like Volcanion and Tangrowth that would otherwise check it by resisting its STAB combination, while access to Aqua Jet allows it to also be a great revenge killer, especially against top threats like Lycanroc-D and Azelf that have taken chip damage. Azumarill also has decent natural bulk and a great defensive typing, which allows it to blanket check some of the more dangerous threats in the metagame such as Kommo-o and Salamence. Unfortunately, Azumarill is quite slow, so it is easily forced out by faster Pokemon such as Raikou and Thundurus-T when it is not boosted with Belly Drum. Additionally, Rotom-W and faster Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Zarude can revenge kill Belly Drum Azumarill, as they can stomach a +6 Aqua Jet. Belly Drum Azumarill is restricted to only getting one setup opportunity, which usually forces it to be preserved until late-game. Azumarill faces competition from both Primarina and Keldeo as a Water-type; the former offers much more defensive utility with its bulk while the latter is much faster and has comparable power to Azumarill.</p> ",

Azumarill can run a trapping set with Sap Sipper and Whirlpool, Perish Song, and Protect.

Ice Punch allows Azumarill to break through Amoonguss by hitting it hard enough to 2HKO on the switch. Knock Off can be used to burden anything that switches in, such as Tangrowth and Tentacruel, by removing their item. A Choice Band allows Azumarill to maximize the wallbreaking potential its STAB attacks have to offer. Adamant is the preferred nature to make it as strong as possible.</p> <p>Choice Band Azumarill fits best on bulky offense teams.

Nidoking, Moltres, and Salamence can remove these Pokemon and make Azumarill's job easier. Kommo-o can offensively pressure Grass-types with its mixed set and can also check Volcanion. Keeping entry hazards up is important to ease Azumarill's ability to break through Tangrowth, so partners such as Krookodile and Nihilego are essential.

A teammate that can pivot, such as Cobalion or Mienshao, can help Azumarill come in safely to set up a Belly Drum and also chip foes while doing so.

Draco Meteor hits various Water-resistant Pokemon quite hard, including Salamence, Kommo-o, Tentacruel, and Starmie. Hurricane has perfect accuracy in rain and can nab 2HKOs on Grass-types like Zarude, Amoonguss, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Surf is a perfectly accurate Water-type move that Kingdra can use against foes that it does not require the power of Hydro Pump to reliably power through, such as Moltres, Krookodile, and Rotom-H. A Modest nature allows Kingdra to always 2HKO uninvested Primarina with Hydro Pump in rain after Stealth Rock. A Timid nature increases Kingdra's Speed even further, allowing it to outrun and threaten opposing Modest Kingdra and Speed tie Trace Gardevoir, although this is realistically the only situation where the additional Speed would matter.</p> <p>Kingdra only fits on offensive rain structures due to its tools as a sweeper being specific to the archetype. Pelipper sets rain, offers a slow pivot, and provides Defog to prevent Kingdra from being worn down. Wallbreakers like Azumarill, Thundurus-T, and Crawdaunt are solid fits on rain teams and can help punch holes in teams for Kingdra to clean late-game. They can be particularly helpful for overwhelming bulky Water-types like Mantine and Primarina as well as Chansey. Barraskewda offers a physical wallbreaking presence to more easily beat foes like Chansey and Primarina and can additionally clean up late-game if Kingdra can't. Keldeo can also combat Chansey, which is Kingdra's biggest hurdle, and importantly help overwhelm Primarina. In return, Kingdra can open up more opportunities for Keldeo by threatening one of its sturdiest checks in Assault Vest Tangrowth. Entry hazard support allows Kingdra to power through foes more easily. Seismitoad in particular is a Stealth Rock setter that can fit well on rain teams thanks to Swift Swim and its key Electric-type immunity. It can additionally utilize its solid coverage to wear down foes like Primarina and Azumarill with Sludge Wave.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>With its solid Special Attack, a Speed stat that outpaces nearly the entire metagame, and good special bulk, Raikou is able to make a name for itself as a solid offensive pivot that can check tier staples like Lycanroc-D and Keldeo. Access to Aura Sphere and Scald along with its STAB Thunderbolt gives Raikou near-perfect coverage against the entire metagame. This coverage, along with its stats and access to Volt Switch, makes Raikou a solid choice for an offensive pivot. Raikou struggles to deal with defensive staples, however, notably Amoonguss and Chansey. It also lacks a form of reliable recovery, which forces it to function mainly as a revenge killer and makes it overly reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots. Raikou also faces strong competition as a fast pivot by Azelf, which has stronger coverage moves, can use U-turn as a pivoting move to prevent being blocked by Ground-types, and can use Knock Off to cripple Pokemon like Assault Vest Tangrowth that Raikou greatly struggles with, though it does have worse special bulk than Raikou. Raikou's subpar physical bulk means that it is easily threatened by several physical attackers it cannot OHKO, like Krookodile and Mamoswine.</p> ",

Amoonguss resists all of Raikou's coverage moves, walling it with ease. Zarude can easily wall most of Raikou's attacks and, if holding a Choice Scarf, easily pivot out on it with U-Turn, though it does have to watch out for Aura Sphere. The former two Pokemon also have Regenerator, which means that they are not punished as hard by Raikou's Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Choice Scarf Krookodile, Choice Scarf Diggersby, and Zygarde-10% can all outspeed or Speed tie Raikou and use their super effective moves to OHKO it. Rhyperior can also serve as a major threat and can scare Raikou out if its HP is high enough; however, it does have to be extremely wary of Scald. Gastrodon and Seismitoad are able to completely wall Raikou with ease, though they do fear Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Kommo-o: Kommo-o either resists or is immune to all of Raikou's attacking moves and can easily turn it into setup fodder if it is running a Clangorous Soul set, although physical and mixed sets do have to worry about being burned by Scald. It also has no reliable recovery, and thus gets worn down easily by multiple Volt Switches as well as Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Chansey's enormous special bulk allows it to wall Raikou, even if it has Aura Sphere. However, Chansey does not like switching into Volt Switch, especially when hazards are up.

With Pressure, Calm Mind, and its superb bulk, Suicune is able to stall out threatening walls such as Aegislash and Chansey. However, Suicune is held back by the prevalence of Water-resistant Pokemon in the tier such as Keldeo, Mantine, and especially Zarude; Keldeo can simply ignore Suicune's Special Defense boosts with Secret Sword, Suicune struggles to make headway against Mantine, and Zarude especially can use Jungle Healing to cure itself of burns and Power Whip to deal significant damage. In addition, Suicune lacks reliable recovery, forcing it to rely on Leftovers and Rest in order to regain HP. This makes Suicune susceptible to Knock Off, as losing Leftovers would require Suicune to use Rest more often. In addition, its overreliance on Sleep Talk isn't great either, as you rely on RNG to choose the ideal move.

In addition, it is unable to sponge hits from foes like Rhyperior and Mamoswine, effectively taking up the teamslot of a Water-type without offering very much defensive utility. Toxic can be used to subdue Water-immune Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Mantine, and Seismitoad. However, Suicune often doesn't have room to run Toxic due to it suffering from four-moveslot syndrome. If you were to run Toxic, it would likely replace Sleep Talk on CroCune. A set with Calm Mind / Roar / Scald / Rest allows Suicune to be used as a dedicated phazer and stop foes like Calm Mind + Psyshock Galarian Slowbro from setting up; however, this would waste Suicune's sweeping capabilities and requires entry hazard support to be effective.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Pokemon such as Raikou and Thundurus-T can easily severely damage Suicune with Thunderbolt, even after a Calm Mind boost.

    "overview": "<p>Sporting a high Attack stat, Adaptability, and high-Base Power moves, Crawdaunt is an extremely powerful wallbreaker in UU capable of weakening or KOing even the bulkiest walls. Access to a strong priority move in Aqua Jet also allows it to bypass its low Speed and pick off targets such as Entei and Mienshao. It can punch holes in most opposing teams using special moves to hit its usual switch-ins or a running Swords Dance set to boost its Attack even more, allowing it to take out even physically defensive Tangrowth after a boost. However, Crawdaunt is extremely slow, being outsped and KOed by common threats such as Salamence and Keldeo. It also suffers from poor bulk and weaknesses to common typings, limiting its opportunities to switch in and set up. The omnipresent Zarude and Kommo-o resist both of Crawdaunt's STAB attacks limiting its ability as a wallbreaker, though the former does have to be wary of Close Combat. Finally, Crawdaunt suffers competition with Azumarill, which has an easier time setting up due to its superior defensive typing, although Crawdaunt's STAB Knock Off is a relevant advantage that lets it break the likes of Amoonguss and Tangrowth more easily.</p> ",

Crawdaunt struggles against faster threats that can take a boosted Aqua Jet, such as Zarude, Keldeo, and Kommo-o, so checks to these are good partners. Amoonguss, for example, can switch into Keldeo and Zarude, while Fairy-types like Togekiss can check Kommo-o.

However, Tangrowth's typing can also hinder it, giving it weaknesses to types like Poison and Fire, forcing it to switch out from threats like Nidoking and Moltres. Tangrowth faces competition from Amoonguss as a defensive Grass-type, as the latter's Poison typing lets it check threats like Primarina, Keldeo, and opposing Tangrowth more reliably; it can also put foes to sleep more reliably thanks to Spore. However, Tangrowth's huge Defense, generally lower passivity, and ability to cripple walls like Chansey with Knock Off are invaluable. Tangrowth hates being setup fodder for Pokemon like Rotom-H and Galarian Slowbro, which often force it to switch out against them, and its abysmal Special Defense means its physically defensive set struggles against special attackers like Primarina, Thundurus-T, and mixed Kommo-o; this makes specially defensive walls mandatory teammates. Finally, Assault Vest Tangrowth is prone to Knock Off from Pokemon it would check, like Azelf, which defeats its role as a special wall.</p> ",

Other Pokemon like opposing Tangrowth, Hatterene, and Amoonguss are not affected by Leech Seed, making it hard to justify using over Giga Drain's immediate recovery. Stun Spore can be considered to slow down and cripple Pokemon like Nidoking, Mienshao, and Tentacruel, but its accuracy is shaky and common Pokemon like Rotom-W and Amoonguss are immune to it. Sleep Powder can immobilize various switch-ins like Salamence and Moltres, preventing them from taking advantage of Tangrowth, but also has shaky accuracy and isn't as consistently useful as other moves. Rock Slide smacks Moltres while additionally dealing fair damage to foes like Rotom-H and Togekiss. However, it generally offers far worse coverage than Tangrowth's other moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: All of the tier's Steel-types can switch directly into Tangrowth. Jirachi can use Tangrowth to set hazards up or heal itself, Celesteela forces physically defensive Tangrowth out with Flamethrower, and Aegislash can cripple Assault Vest variants with Toxic and destroy physically defensive ones with Shadow Ball. However, they all dislike Knock Off, especially the latter two.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Nidoqueen, Nihilego, Amoonguss, and Tentacruel can hit Tangrowth with their respective STAB moves, and Tentacruel can also damage Tangrowth with Liquid Ooze if it ever uses Giga Drain. Since they force Tangrowth out with offensive pressure, the former two can use it to set Stealth Rock. Amoonguss takes little from Tangrowth's moves and only dislikes Knock Off, forcing Tangrowth to switch out; this gives Amoonguss a free opportunity to put one of Tangrowth's teammate to sleep via Spore. Tentacruel can remove Tangrowth's Assault Vest with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Tangrowth is extremely pressured by Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure and is almost always forced out. The former two can use Volt Switch or U-turn, respectively, to predict a switch and keep momentum, but Tangrowth can stomach a Fire-type attack from them and remove their item with Knock Off in return if needed. Incineroar threatens Tangrowth with Overheat, can remove its item with Knock Off, and can pivot out with Parting Shot.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Even with an Assault Vest, Nidoking, Salamence, Nihilego, and Chandelure can all get past Tangrowth with their powerful super effective STAB attacks.

Wallbreakers such as Buzzwole, Entei, and Nidoking appreciate Rotom-W's Volt Switch allowing them to pressure defensive cores relying on Pokemon such as Chansey and Tangrowth. Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Zarude can help remove Seismitoad and Gastrodon and patch any weaknesses against Zygarde-10%.

Volt Switch helps Rotom-W offensively threaten foes such as +1 Gyarados, Keldeo, and Starmie. Thunderbolt can be used over Volt Switch to apply more reliable pressure against foes like Mantine and Galarian Moltres, although Volt Switch is more consistent. Defog allows Rotom-W to remove entry hazards before being KOed or as it forces out Pokemon like Mantine and Moltres. Pain Split over Defog gives Rotom-W more longevity. However, finding other options for entry hazard removal can be challenging and create more strain on teambuilding. Trick is vital because it cripples defensive pivots such as Chansey, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth. However, Rotom-W should only use Trick after the additional Speed is no longer necessary, as it will no longer be able to outspeed threats such as Lycanroc-D and Zygarde-10%. Choice Scarf allows Rotom-W to revenge kill threats such as Lycanroc-D and Krookodile as well as maintain momentum against other Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed and deal massive damage such as Salamence. The additional speed also helps Rotom-W scout and maintain momentum against unfavorable matchups such as Zarude and Roserade more reliably.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-W fits best on offense, balance, and bulky offense teams that appreciate its role compression as a Ground-immune offensive pivot and revenge killer that provides momentum and emergency entry hazard removal. Other pivots such as Mienshao form a potent VoltTurn core with Rotom-W, as they overwhelm each other's checks; Mienshao deals with Chansey and Zarude, while Rotom-W deals with Moltres and Nihilego. Entry hazard setters such as Jirachi, Nihilego, and Krookodile wear down targets for Rotom-W. The former is able to form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W, while the latter two can cripple Pokemon such as Aegislash and Salamence with Knock Off. Wallbreakers such as Entei, Nidoking, and Mamoswine are fantastic partner that break through Pokemon Rotom-W grants them safe entry on, such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Galarian Slowbro. Hatterene deals with Pokemon that would otherwise take advantage of Rotom-W like Seismitoad and Kommo-o. Hatterene's Magic Bounce also assists Rotom-W in its role as entry hazard control and makes Rotom-W more comfortable with running Pain Split. Rotom-W's role compression means it can struggle against Entei and Jirachi in the long-term, so teammates such as RestTalk Primarina, Aegislash, and Moltres help relieve pressure.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Azelf is a versatile Pokemon that can take advantage of its incredibly high Speed tier and wide movepool to provide a powerful offensive presence and fast support. Nasty Plot and a variety of coverage moves such as Fire Blast, Energy Ball, and Dazzling Gleam allow Azelf to hit nearly the entire tier for super effective damage. It learning Knock Off and U-turn also makes it a great offensive pivot that can threaten tier staples like Aegislash and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Despite Azelf's elite Speed, common Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Zarude easily revenge kill it. Azelf does not have much bulk and lacks recovery, leaving it worn down quickly and making it difficult to set up with Nasty Plot. It also needs pivot support to get in safely, as it typically cannot directly switch into any attack. Starmie gives Azelf competition as a fast Psychic-type with strong coverage moves, solid secondary typing, a better offensive ability in Analytic, and better utility moves like Recover. However, Azelf can be more threatening than Starmie after Nasty Plot. As a pivot, Thundurus-T can fill a similar role, but Azelf's high Speed allows it to better threaten Pokemon like Keldeo and Nihilego.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Adrenaline Orb can be used on the Nasty Plot set to beat Azelf's most common check in Choice Scarf Krookodile, as Intimidate will boost Azelf's Speed and allow it to KO Krookodile with a boosted coverage move. This tactic also helps against Salamence, but it is rather useless against teams that do not have one of these two Pokemon. Azelf can be used as a suicide lead due to its great Speed tier and access to Stealth Rock and Taunt. While this allows Azelf to always get Stealth Rock up with a Focus Sash, a Pokemon like Krookodile, which possesses better defensive utility and a stronger Knock Off, can typically do this job better. A dual screens set can additionally set Stealth Rock and maintain momentum with Explosion, but it has difficulties setting both Stealth Rock and dual screens. Azelf can also be a Choice Band user with its great Speed tier and wide physical movepool, boasting options like Knock Off, U-turn, Zen Headbutt, Ice Punch, Explosion, and Trick. However, it is usually unable to OHKO its foes and outclassed by Pokemon like Crawdaunt, which provides priority and a stronger Knock Off.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users: Common Choice Scarf users like Krookodile, Zarude, Jirachi, and Mienshao outspeed and threaten Azelf with super effective STAB or coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers: Azelf does not have great defenses and will be 2HKOed by most priority attacks, including Accelerock from Lycanroc-D and Aqua Jet from Azumarill. Additionally, more powerful priority attacks like a boosted Quick Attack from Diggersby will KO Azelf after minimal chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Galarian Moltres can OHKO Azelf, and Azelf cannot do much back it unless it is running Dazzling Gleam and Colbur Berry. Umbreon walls Azelf almost completely without Dazzling Gleam.

Psyshock is the preferred STAB option to OHKO Nihilego and Tentacruel without a boost, and it also hits Chansey considerably harder than Psychic. Fire Blast OHKOes defensive Celesteela and Assault Vest Tangrowth at +2. It also covers many key threats such as Jirachi and Buzzwole. Energy Ball is the preferred last move to hit Krookodile, Rhyperior, and Milotic for super effective damage. It also hits Unaware users like Quagsire and Pyukumuku, giving Azelf a good matchup against certain stall teams. Dazzling Gleam is an option to 2HKO Salamence and hit Galarian Moltres super effectively while also maintaining coverage for Krookodile. It also prevents Umbreon from completely walling Azelf. Since Azelf will typically be hitting its foes for super effective damage, Expert Belt is enough to OHKO nearly everything. Life Orb can be used to increase Azelf's damage output more consistently on targets that it cannot hit super effectively, like Hatterene and Moltres, but the chip damage adds up quickly and leaves Azelf more vulnerable to revenge killers with priority like Lycanroc-D. Colbur Berry allows Azelf to withstand one Dark-type hit from common Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Zarude and KO them back. This is more situational and less reliable, and Azelf needs the extra power from Expert Belt or Life Orb to OHKO certain foes like Celesteela and Assault Vest Tangrowth at +2.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Azelf is best used on hyper offense builds that can offer it support, although it can also fit on certain balance teams as a late-game wincon. An entry hazard setter like Nihilego or Krookodile helps weaken foes like Chansey and Primarina into KO range of +2 Azelf. A Sticky Web setter like Ribombee or Shuckle significantly boosts Azelf's ability to clean through teams, as Sticky Web invalidates common Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Zarude as revenge killers. It also ensures Azelf does not lose any Speed ties with Zygarde-10%, or Raikou and Starmie if they lack Heavy-Duty Boots. A pivot like Zarude can get Azelf in safely against Pokemon like Amoonguss. A wallbreaker like Azumarill or Mamoswine can help punch holes in the enemy team, significantly weakening them for Azelf to sweep later. Other sweepers like Gyarados and Nasty Plot Thundurus-T can be used on hyper offense teams to cover a wider range of threats, including Galarian Moltres and Incineroar, which Azelf cannot easily beat.</p> "

STAB Mach Punch is also a great tool, functioning as a strong priority attack that can threaten faster Pokemon like Mamoswine and Lycanroc-D. Conkeldurr is a bit weighed down by its proneness to being worn down from Flame Orb, however.

Conkeldurr also faces competition from Fighting-types like Buzzwole and Keldeo, which provide solid secondary typings and better Speed tiers. Conkeldurr struggles to break through physically defensive Buzzwole, as it can shrug off multiple Facade's.</p> ",

However, this often prevents it from being able to maximize its offensive potential, and it is still quite prone to being worn down. Poison Jab is a coverage option that hits Fairy-types super effectively, but Conkeldurr can usually muscle through them with Facade.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Buzzwole: Physically defensive Buzzwole can comfortably wall Conkeldurr and beat it through the combination of Drain Punch and Roost.

  "Krookodile": {
    "overview": "<p>Krookodile's high Attack, respectable Speed, and amazing offensive typing make it one of the best offensive checks to Pokemon like Aegislash and Galarian Slowbro. Few Pokemon resist the combination of Earthquake and Knock Off, which dents even neutral targets such as Primarina, Keldeo, and Amoonguss. Intimidate lets Krookodile switch into resisted and neutral hits such as Lycanroc-D's Stone Edge without getting too worn down. It also helps prevent late-game sweeps from Pokemon like Salamence. Moves like Stealth Rock and Taunt let Krookodile compress utility roles, and its ability to run a plethora of items, like Life Orb, Leftovers, Choice Scarf, Choice Band, and resist Berries, makes for a key factor in its unpredictability and versatility. It's one of the best Choice Scarf users in UU, capable of revenge killing threats like Nihilego and Lycanroc-D. With Choice Band, it can remove common answers to it like Amoonguss more easily. However, Krookodile is threatened by physical attackers like Lycanroc-D and Zygarde-10% even after Intimidate, and its special bulk leaves it vulnerable to special attackers like Nidoking and Aegislash. Weaknesses to common types like Grass, Water, and Fighting hinder its defensive utility and leave it helpless against common Pokemon like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Tangrowth. Coverage from Electric-types like Raikou's Scald and Thundurus-T's Focus Blast prevents Krookodile from checking them despite its Electric immunity. Buzzwole and physically defensive Tangrowth wall Krookodile indefinitely.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Passho Berry gives Krookodile a chance to eliminate threats like Crawdaunt, Rotom-W, and Raikou. Krookodile can opt for a more offensive Choice Scarf set with Moxie, letting it accumulate Attack boosts as it KOes enemies. However, the utility that Intimidate offers is more worth it to weaken Pokemon like Lycanroc-D, and Krookodile can't break past Grass-types and Buzzwole without enough boosts. High Horsepower should be used in place of Earthquake if Tapu Bulu is on Krookodile's team, as Grassy Terrain weakens Earthquake. Choice Band Aerial Ace hits Buzzwole very hard, but that's it. Choice Band Assurance can nail Pokemon like Amoonguss as they switch in, but it requires specific conditions and good prediction</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Amoonguss and Tangrowth check Krookodile very well and are only bothered by Knock Off. Both cause big damage with Giga Drain and incapacitate a team member with Spore or Sleep Powder. However, Amoonguss has to wary of Choice Band Earthquake, as it is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage. Zarude and Tapu Bulu switch into Krookodile's STAB moves and can recover with Jungle Healing or Horn Leech.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Rotom-W and Gyarados are immune to Ground and can take advantage of Krookodile being Choice-locked into Earthquake. The former can remove Stealth Rock with Defog, while the latter can get a free turn of setup. Krookodile also can't take any Water-type hits from Crawdaunt, Azumarill, Primarina, and Keldeo, but they don't like to switch in directly into its moves. Crawdaunt is also easier to switch around, since only one of its STAB types threatens Krookodile.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Buzzwole walls any Krookodile set. It resists both of Krookodile's STAB moves, can tank any hit, has reliable recovery in Roost, and can threaten Krookodile back with its own STAB moves. Kommo-o, Mienshao, Keldeo and Cobalion also threaten Krookodile greatly. The former has enough bulk to take non-Choice Band attacks and KO back, while the latter three outspeed non-Choice Scarf sets, with Choice Scarf Mienshao outspeeding even those. However, Mienshao and Cobalion should scout for Chople Berry and Choice Scarf sets.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Despite its ability and good defensive typing, Krookodile has subpar bulk and lacks reliable recovery, meaning it gets worn down quite quickly switching into Pokemon such as Lycanroc-D and Zygarde-10%. Pokemon like Aegislash and Nidoking hurt it very badly with even resisted special STAB moves due to its bad special bulk.</p> ",

With Life Orb, this set fits on hyper offense teams as a great lead. If running Leftovers or a Berry, this set fits on bulky offense and balance teams, which appreciate Krookodile's utility and resistances. Knock Off is useful for checks like Amoonguss, Rotom-W, and Celesteela, crippling them for Krookodile's teammates. Stealth Rock wears down Pokemon like Celesteela and Tangrowth for teammates like Aegislash and Choice Specs Primarina. Toxic allows Krookodile to cripple checks such as Tangrowth and Buzzwole. Taunt prevents Stealth Rock and Defog from Pokemon like Rhyperior, Seismitoad, Rotom-W, and Moltres. Leftovers offsets entry hazard damage and gives Krookodile longevity to keep threats like Nihilego and Aegislash in check more easily. Chople Berry lets Krookodile take Lycanroc-D's Close Combat and KO back with Earthquake. It also helps Krookodile take Thundurus formes' Focus Blast to then weaken or KO them.

In return, they compensate for Krookodile's lower Speed tier and remove Pokemon like Buzzwole, Zarude, and Keldeo. Amoonguss can check Pokemonn like Primarina, Keldeo, and Zarude for Krookodile, and together they can keep Lycanroc-D in check. Salamence forms a double Intimidate core with Krookodile, weakening Pokemon like Zarude and stopping setup sweepers like Gyarados from getting out of control.

Toxic cripples switch-ins such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth, but since others like Amoonguss and Jungle Healing Zarude are immune or resilient to it, it's quite matchup reliant. Darkest Lariat is useful to hit Pokemon like Rotom-W harder after they've had their items removed. Lash Out serves as a good way to punish Intimidate from opposing Krookodile and Salamence and also punishes Defog from the latter, but it has no use outside of that because Krookodile outspeeds the Rotom-H formes and Moltres, the only other relevant Defoggers. Stealth Rock can be used to take advantage of Krookodile's ability to force switches against Pokemon such as Azelf and Nihilego, but it should only be used when the role compression is necessary, and it requires very good prediction. Choice Scarf turns Krookodile into an amazing revenge killer, outspeeding key Pokemon and sweepers such as Lycanroc-D, Nihilego, and +1 Kommo-o.</p> <p>This set fits well on offense, bulky offense, and balance teams that need a fast revenge killer. These kinds of teams appreciate Krookodile's defensive utility in its two immunities and Intimidate.

Assault Vest Tangrowth takes on threatening Water-types such as Primarina, Rotom-W, and Keldeo well. Strong wallbreakers such as Primarina and Entei can get past Krookodile's checks such as Buzzwole and Tapu Bulu, allowing it to spam its STAB moves more freely. Krookodile is helpless against Grass-types, so partners that can pressure them like Nihilego and Mamoswine are great. Rotom-H is another good teammate that can scare away Grass-types and brings Krookodile in on checks like Nihilego. Entry hazard support from teammates such as Kommo-o and Jirachi is key to weaken checks like Rotom-W and opposing Kommo-o.

It can also let Chandelure cripple Pokemon that revenge kill it, like Knock Off Azelf, as it faints.</p> <p>This set is a strong fit on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate Chandelure's ability to wear down defensive threats early- to mid-game. Chandelure notably struggles breaking past the likes of Nihilego and Tentacruel with this set's listed options, making Pokemon more equipped to handle them, like Nidoqueen and Seismitoad, good teammates. Both can also set Stealth Rock for Chandelure, whittling down its checks. Other entry hazard setters can work well too; Rhyperior can also ease the matchup against foes like Moltres and Nihilego without Grass Knot, and Kommo-o can pivot in on opposing Chandelure. Sweepers like Kommo-o and Keldeo appreciate Chandelure's ability to weaken bulky foes like Rhyperior and Primarina throughout a match with Toxic, allowing them to clean up more easily late-game. Chandelure appreciates them compensating for its slightly paltry Speed. Chandelure also enjoys pivots as teammates, as it doesn't often enjoy directly switching into play. In addition to providing pivoting support, Choice Scarf Jirachi can pressure faster Pokemon like Lycanroc-D and Nihilego, while Rotom-W can lure in Pokemon like Tangrowth for Chandelure to take advantage of. Rotom-W can also pivot in on various Ground-types, like Rhyperior and Krookodile. Other status spreaders can work well as teammates, alleviating Chandelure's need for prediction regarding Hex. Galarian Slowbro is particularly good at spreading status due to its tendency to run both Scald and Sludge Bomb. Tentacruel does this as well and can also utilize Knock Off to further cripple foes.</p> "

  "Haxorus": {
    "overview": "<p>Haxorus is a solid wallbreaker in UU thanks to its monstrous Attack, good Speed tier that lets it outspeed offensive threats like Krookodile, Gyarados, and Kommo-o, and powerful STAB Outrage to heavily damage common defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth, Buzzwole, and Amoonguss. Coverage options in Earthquake, Close Combat, and Poison Jab let it get past would-be checks like Aegislash, Celesteela, and Primarina. Mold Breaker allows Haxorus to hit Rotom-H and Rotom-W with Earthquake and makes it difficult for opposing teams to switch into Haxorus. Its typing provides resistances to the abundant Water, Fire, Electric and Grass-type Pokemon in the tier like Rotom-W, Tangrowth, and Moltres, although its mediocre defensive stats don't allow it to use its typing to its full potential. Dragon-types like Kommo-o and Salamence limit its viability, with both being able to function as wallbreakers and sweepers while also offering more defensive utility. Even though Haxorus is a powerful Pokemon, it is very prediction reliant and can be exploited if it is locked into the wrong move, like using Outrage on Fairy-types or Poison Jab on Steel-types like Celesteela. Its below average defensive stats and awkward Speed tier also leave it easily revenge killed by Keldeo, Lycanroc-D, Nihilego, and Mienshao.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Dragon Dance set helps Haxorus bypass faster checks like Nihilego and Mienshao; however, finding a turn for it to set up is difficult, and Haxorus is easily outclassed by Salamence due to the latter's better bulk and typing and access to Moxie. A Swords Dance set with Scale Shot is also viable, but the Defense drop from Scale Shot makes Haxorus much easier to pick off from priority attacks, the set is unreliable, and Haxorus rarely gets two turns to set up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel types like Celesteela, Aegislash, and Jirachi can take advantage of Haxorus being locked into Poison Jab or Outrage and threaten it. Celesteela and Aegislash can use Protect and King's Shield to scout Haxorus's attacks, while Jirachi can outspeed it and take it down with Iron Head flinches. However, they all can be 2HKOed by one of Haxorus's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Priority users like Lycanroc-D, Diggersby, and Mamoswine can make Haxorus's sweep fall short, although they will be punished greatly if it has yet to take chip damage. Haxorus is especially weak to Mamoswine's Ice Shard, which is able to KO with minimal chip.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types like Hatterene, Primarina, and Azumarill can take advantage of Haxorus being locked into Outrage to get a free switch and threaten it with a powerful STAB move, although they must be careful of Poison Jab. Togekiss in particular is a major threat thanks to its immunity to both Earthquake and Outrage, which gives it more opportunities to take advantage of Haxorus.</p> <p><strong>Faster Checks: Despite Haxorus's decent Speed tier, it is outpaced by common threats such as Nihilego, Keldeo, and Zarude as well as Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Krookodile, and Gardevoir, with Gardevoir being noteworthy due to its immunity to Outrage.

Its good coverage moves in Poison Jab and Stone Edge can take out many of its would-be checks, such as Hatterene and Salamence. Mienshao is also one of the best Choice Scarf users in the metagame, being able to revenge kill threats like Lycanroc-D and Starmie while also outrunning other Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Jirachi.

If running Life Orb, Mienshao has a mediorce Speed tier, leaving it easily revenge killed by threats like Keldeo and Thundurus, while running Choice Scarf makes it much harder to score KOs. It struggles with Pokemon like Moltres if not running Stone Edge and Hatterene if not running Poison Jab. Mienshao also has incredibly low HP and defenses, so priority attacks like Lycanroc-D's Accelerock and Azumarill's Aqua Jet easily threaten it.

Blaze Kick can be used to deal with Amoonguss and Buzzwole, but it lacks other relevant targets and doesn't do much to Buzzwole anyway.

A pivoting set with Volt Switch / Thunderbolt / Psychic / Focus Blast is an option, but Thundurus-T's Speed means it can't really force Pokemon like Mienshao and Keldeo out like Azelf, for example. Checks and Counters ===================</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users: Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Diggersby pressure Thundurus-T very easily, and faster offensive Pokemon like Nihilego and Keldeo threaten it due to its mediocre bulk. Priority users like Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine can pick off Thundurus-T after some prior chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Assault Vest Tangrowth doesn't fear any of Thundurus-T's attacks aside from Sludge Wave. Chansey can also stall it out with Toxic + Seismic Toss while healing off the damage with Soft-Boiled, although it can't take more than one Focus Blast after a Nasty Plot. Though rare, Diancie can take any hit at +2 and threaten to OHKO with Diamond Storm.</p> ",

  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<p>Keldeo has cemented itself as one of the most dangerous wallbreakers within UU thanks to its high Special Attack stat and great offensive typing. Unlike other Water-type special attackers such as Primarina, Keldeo can break past conventional special walls such as Assault Vest Tangrowth and Chansey thanks to STAB Secret Sword. Its typing, coupled with respectable bulk, also has defensive merits, allowing it to check foes such as Entei and Jirachi. Choice Specs Keldeo is an amazing wallbreaker that can 2HKO threats such as Azumarill and Salamence with Hydro Pump and utilize its fantastic Speed tier to outpace threats like Nihilego, Zarude, and Thundurus-T, which gives it opportunities to switch in and wallbreak. Calm Mind Keldeo is instead a scary late-game cleaner that becomes harder to check and revenge kill after several Calm Mind boosts. Keldeo also has a good arsenal of coverage options in Icy Wind and Air Slash to break through common checks such as Salamence and Amoonguss. While Keldeo is difficult to switch into, it's very prediction reliant and can be scouted by foes like King's Shield Aegislash. Faster foes like Starmie and Lycanroc-D can easily revenge kill Keldeo, although the latter will be unable to do so if Keldeo is behind a Substitute. Other Pokemon such as bulky Primarina and Mantine have no issues at all switching into any of Keldeo's attacks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flip Turn can be considered on the Choice Specs set to pivot out against Pokemon Keldeo struggles to break through, like Primarina; however, Keldeo would much rather run Scald because of Hydro Pump's limited PP, and there aren't many Pokemon capable of taking repeated hits from it anyways. Keldeo can utilize Choice Scarf to revenge kill threats like Lycanroc-D and Dragon Dance Salamence. Due to the lack of immediate power, it is forced to run Flip Turn to pivot out of unfavorable matchups against foes such as Amoonguss and Primarina. Toxic allows Keldeo to cripple Pokemon such as Jellicent and Mantine, two foes it has no means of breaking through. However, it is only really necessary in these two matchups, as Keldeo has the means to overwhelm other checks. Toxic is also completely ineffective against the common RestTalk Primarina. Keldeo can opt for alternative item options such as Expert Belt and Heavy-Duty Boots over Choice Specs, with the former letting it change up moves and the latter making it a more effective pivot. However, the significant drop in power generally makes these more niche options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Bulky Primarina is one of Keldeo's toughest matchups to break past, especially if running Rest. Mantine is a foe Keldeo has no means of breaking past. Starmie resists Keldeo's STAB moves, is faster, and can pressure it with Psyshock; however, it does struggle to pivot into Choice Specs Hydro Pump without bulk investment. Gyarados can use Keldeo as a free setup opportunity and proceed to KO it with Bounce or Power Whip, though it can potentially be crippled by a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth are consistent switch-ins to Keldeo thanks to Regenerator. However, Amoonguss does have to worry about a potential boosted Icy Wind or Air Slash. Tangrowth fears the same and can also be overwhelmed by Secret Sword. Tapu Bulu and Roserade can shrug off most of Keldeo's attacks besides the aforementioned Icy Wind or Air Slash; however, Choice Specs Hydro Pump can easily 2HKO them without bulk investment. Choice Scarf Zarude is faster than Keldeo and can revenge kill it with Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Lycanroc-D is faster than Keldeo and can revenge kill it. Noivern resists both of Keldeo's STAB moves and can revenge kill it behind a Substitute thanks to Infiltrator. Starmie and Azelf can revenge kill Keldeo with Psyshock, which is also able to bypass Keldeo's Calm Mind boosts.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Specially defensive Aegislash has the bulk in its Shield forme to stomach multiple Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pumps and proceed to cripple Keldeo with Toxic. However, Calm Mind variants can use Aegislash as setup fodder. Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro and Reuniclus can stomach multiple attacks from Keldeo, threaten it back with their Psychic-type STAB attacks, and regain any lost health with Regenerator. Under rain, Keldeo can overwhelm them though.</p> ",

Surf is an option on rain teams to 2HKO foes like Assault Vest Reuniclus after Stealth Rock. Icy Wind OHKOes Salamence and provides coverage for Grass-types like Roserade and Amoonguss. Air Slash is an alternative option that hits Amoonguss and Tangrowth much harder, but Keldeo can already 2HKO Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth with Icy Wind and Secret Sword after Stealth Rock, so it's less appealing.</p> <p>Keldeo fits best on offense teams that value the sheer power it provides alongside a great Speed tier. Although Keldeo has a great defensive typing, it prefers to be brought in safely by pivots such as Chansey and Zarude. Keldeo is a fantastic rain attacker, as the extra power provided prevents Amoonguss from being a reliable switch-in. Pelipper can set rain with Drizzle, bring Keldeo in safely with U-turn, and pressure Grass-types with Hurricane. Other rain sweepers such as Barraskewda can work alongside Keldeo for both to wear down each other's checks such as Tangrowth. Entry hazard setters like Nihilego and Krookodile help Keldeo pick up important KOs such as 2HKOing Tangrowth with Secret Sword after Stealth Rock. Nihilego can also help check special Salamence, while Krookodile can force a lot of damage against foes like Amoonguss and take on Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro and Reuniclus. Late-game cleaners such as Lycanroc-D and Dragon Dance Salamence appreciate Keldeo's ability to wear down or remove foes like Amoonguss and Primarina. In return, Lycanroc-D can help revenge kill threats such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Salamence, which Keldeo may give a free setup opportunity to if locked into the wrong move, and remove faster foes like Azelf and Starmie with Accelerock.</p> "

Scald is a spammable move that can punish switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Azumarill. Secret Sword allows Keldeo to break through specially defensive foes such as Chansey and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Icy Wind can be considered to OHKO Salamence, as it comfortably walls Keldeo and can damage it behind Substitute with Dual Wingbeat. It also provides coverage for Grass-types, but bulkier ones like Amoonguss and Tangrowth require multiple boosts to reliably muscle through. For this reason, Air Slash is also an option to hit them much harder at the cost of having a harder time against Salamence; however, Substitute is the preferred option to let Keldeo take advantage of more passive Pokemon like Umbreon and Jirachi. Leftovers provides passive recovery and helps offset Substitute damage. More offensive item options such as Life Orb and Expert Belt can be considered on three attack sets to improve Keldeo's ability to break through Amoonguss and Tangrowth.</p> <p>Calm Mind Keldeo fits best on bulky offense and balance builds that value the sweeping potential it provides alongside a great typing and Speed tier.

Keldeo lacks the means to muscle past Pokemon such as Primarina, Mantine, and Tangrowth easily; therefore, partners like Toxtricity, Nihilego, and Nidoking help remove them. Nihilego can also check special Salamence and provide Stealth Rock support to wear down Keldeo's checks. Togekiss can muscle through Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth and provide Heal Bell support, as status greatly limits the effectiveness of Keldeo. Salamence can likewise pressure these Grass-types as well as providing Defog support. In return, Keldeo is able to pressure common Flying-resistant foes such as Nihilego, Rhyperior, and Rotom-H for them. Pivots like Jirachi and Chansey bring Keldeo in safely. Jirachi can invite foes such as Moltres in for Keldeo to set up on and provide Healing Wish support to give it another opportunity to sweep. Albeit rare, Noivern can prove problematic due to its Speed and ability to bypass Substitute. For this reason, partners like Rhyperior and Mamoswine are appreciated. Mamoswine is also able to remove Grass-types and force damage on Water-types such as Rotom-W and Primarina.

A Swords Dance boost allows Diggersby to KO defensive walls like Chansey and Celesteela; even the latter is KOed by Mega Kick after chip damage despite being the only Pokemon in the tier that resists or is immune to both STAB moves. Quick Attack also provides a strong STAB priority attack that allows Diggersby to perform late-game sweeps, while a Choice Scarf set can outspeed and KO some of its usual offensive checks like Cobalion and Lycanroc-D; however, other common Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Zarude outspeed Diggersby and have more defensive utility, with the former having Intimidate and the latter having decent natural bulk. Without Choice Scarf, Diggersby is slow and will rarely outspeed its foes, forcing it to usually rely on Quick Attack for a late-game sweep and making it easy fodder for faster revenge killers like Keldeo if they are healthy enough to survive a boosted Quick Attack. Other offensive Pokemon that can boost their Speed, such as Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados, can better position themselves to sweep. With Diggersby's low defenses and lack of any meaningful defensive utility outside of switching in on a predicted Electric-type attack with its Choice Scarf set, it needs to typically OHKO its foes to prevent taking heavy damage in return. Additionally, it is weak to common priority users such as Aqua Jet Azumarill and Mach Punch Conkeldurr.</p> ",

Unfortunately, this set is very prediction reliant. Additionally, Diggersby's poor Speed makes it easy for many foes like Keldeo and Lycanroc to revenge kill it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon: Diggersby's main drawback is its below average Speed without Choice Scarf, allowing many offensive threats in the tier like Keldeo and Lycanroc-D to OHKO it.

Body Slam can be used over Mega Kick as a more reliable option that will still deal enough damage to KO defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss after one Swords Dance boost. The damage increase from Silk Scarf enables Diggersby to more easily clean late-game with +2 Quick Attack, allowing it to KO Pokemon like Azelf, Keldeo, and Thundurus-T after chip damage.</p> <p>Diggersby best fits on offense teams, particularly ones that can offer entry hazard support. A Sticky Web setter like Slurpuff or Shuckle helps Diggersby outspeed most of its common checks like Cobalion and Lycanroc-D.

This helps the team make significant progress by wearing down Pokemon like Buzzwole and Tangrowth, which stop Diggersby's momentum. While Fire Punch can be used to better threaten Celesteela and Buzzwole, typically it is better to relegate other teammates to help deal with these Pokemon, as Diggersby can use U-turn to safely get in other teammates like Rotom-H in against these foes. Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Salamence and Rotom-H, but Body Slam is typically more effective at heavily damaging both foes and potentially paralyzing them.

  "Aegislash": {
    "overview": "<p>Aegislash's unique typing with useful resistances and immunities coupled with its great blend of offense and defense make it one of the most influential Pokemon in the tier. It can run many different sets that allow it to pick and choose its counters. A Substitute + Toxic set is one of the hardest foes to switch around and take down, as it capitalizes on Aegislash's great bulk to whittle down its common checks with Toxic damage and powerful Shadow Balls. Swords Dance Aegislash with Shadow Sneak is an incredibly threatening sweeper that can pick off many teams just after some chip damage. Mixed sets make for strong wallbreakers that are capable of 2HKOing Chansey and heavily damaging Zarude, which would otherwise be safe switch-ins. It can also effectively run an Autotomize set with Weakness Policy, which takes advantage of the many weak super effective moves thrown at it, like Tentacruel's or Nihilego's Knock Off, while fixing one of its greatest flaws in its low Speed. Its great bulk in Shield forme and Stealth Rock resistance give it points of entry into Pokemon without strong super effective attacks like Nihilego and Jirachi. Still, Aegislash suffers from a very low Speed and typing that is vulnerable to many of UU's staples, including Krookodile, Moltres, and Zarude, which can easily revenge kill it. Aegislash is also overly reliant on King's Shield to tank most neutral hits, which can make it very predictable for setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Salamence and Swords Dance Lycanroc-D to take advantage of it. Lacking reliable recovery also leaves it very vulnerable to being worn down in the course of a game, especially if it takes Knock Off from Pokemon it wants to check like Nihilego. Some mixed walls like Assault Vest Tangrowth and Celesteela can easily scout and force out Aegislash early-game, which greatly hinders its unpredictability factor and lets opponents adjust accordingly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shadow Sneak is an option as the fourth move on the King's Shield + Toxic set to pick off weakened foes, most notably setup sweepers like Necrozma and Polteageist; however, it isn't as consistently useful as other options. Steel Beam gives Choice Specs Aegislash an incredibly powerful nuke to OHKO foes like Amoonguss, but it is not preferred due to Aegislash already effectively threatening Amoonguss with its other moves and the move whittling Aegislash down rather quickly. Choice Band makes Aegislash a terrifying physical wallbreaker and makes its priority even stronger, although this set can struggle with Rocky Helmet users like Buzzwole and doesn't appreciate being locked into moves. Metal Sound exploits defensive switch-ins like Amoonguss, giving Aegislash a great chance to KO it after Stealth Rock damage. However, this isn't the most consistent move, as it is very prediction reliant and unable to punish faster Pokemon on the switch; also, even with the -2 drop, sturdier Pokemon like Assault Vest Tangrowth can still deal with Aegislash.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Aegislash notably struggles with Dark-types like Obstagoon, Zarude, and Krookodile; while it does have Close Combat to punish them if they get too careless, they still threaten it with super effective moves and can easily switch in on Shadow Ball. Galarian Moltres and Umbreon are especially troublesome, as they have the special bulk to tank Aegislash's hits and can shake off status with Rest and Heal Bell, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls: Mixed walls like Assault Vest Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Celesteela are very annoying for Aegislash early-game, as they aren't immediately threatened by any of its moves and can KO Aegislash in its Blade forme thanks to their lower Speed and super effective coverage. Chansey completely walls sets lacking Close Combat and can regain momentum with Teleport. However, it struggles more against Aegislash with Close Combat than the three previously mentioned.</p> <p><strong>Burn and Knock Off: Losing its passive recovery to Knock Off or a burn greatly limits the effectiveness of the King's Shield + Toxic set, making it incredibly susceptible to chip damage from weak attacks and Stealth Rock.

Substitute allows Aegislash to get even more Toxic damage while also reducing the prediction it needs; it can also stop moves like Amonguss's Spore. King's Shield allows Aegislash to switch into its Shield forme and scout Choiced-locked foes like Krookodile and Keldeo so that it can switch into the right teammate if needed. Heavy investment in HP and Special Defense lets Aegislash switch into Pokemon like Salamence and Galarian Slowbro without fearing a 3HKO in Shield forme and cripple or attack them; this investment also stops Amoonguss's Foul Play from breaking its Substitute. 136 Speed EVs are an option to outpace Conkeldurr and everything slower.</p> <p>This set is a solid fit on semi-stall and balance teams thanks to its ability to heavily wear down Aegislash's typical checks, open up holes for its teammates, and be a solid defensive presence. Specially defensive foes that don't care about Toxic, like Celesteela and Chansey, are incredibly hard for this set to deal with, stopping it from making any progress; that's why powerful wallbreakers such as Buzzwole and Mienshao pair really well with it, and Aegislash can soften up some checks to them like Salamence with Toxic damage. Other offensive Pokemon like Jungle Healing Zarude and Obstagoon don't care what Aegislash can do to them, so sturdier walls like Tangrowth and Kommo-o pair really well with this set. Fairy-types like Primarina and Togekiss give it more security against Fighting-types and cover Aegislash's Dark weakness; Sylveon is a notable partner, giving Aegislash Wish support so that it doesn't rely solely on Leftovers for its recovery. Umbreon is another useful partner, not only providing Wish but also easily spreading Toxic and checking some nuisances for Aegislash like Moltres and Nidoking. Regenerator and a Poison typing make Amoonguss one of the most obnoxious foes against this set, meaning that offensive checks to it like Moltres and Mamoswine are natural partners. Aegislash teams need a secondary check for Tangrowth and Nihilego, as they commonly run Knock Off and can leave Aegislash horribly crippled; Pokemon like Amoonguss can achieve this exact job.</p> "

Weakness Policy takes advantage of the many super effective hits that aren't enough to KO Aegislash, like Azelf's Knock Off and Salamence's Flamethrower, to sweep more effectively.</p> <p>This set is a good fit on bulky offense and other offense teams by virtue of being an effective cleaner. If Weakness Policy isn't triggered, Aegislash is fairly weak, so it greatly appreciates strong wallbreakers like Nidoking and Primarina opening up the path for it to clean up. Other setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Belly Drum Azumarill can help overwhelm the opponent or finish up Aegislash's job after it has weakened the opposing team. Even after Autotomize, Pokemon like Choice Scarf Zarude and Regieleki still outspeed Aegislash and can revenge kill it in its vulnerable Blade forme, which makes Sticky Web support from Shuckle or Araquanid incredibly valuable. Other entry hazards like Roserade's Spikes and Krookdile's Stealth Rock are very helpful after Weakness Policy to break through foes like Rhyperior and Krookodile more easily.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Heliolisk is an effective wallbreaker on rain teams thanks to its great ability in Dry Skin keeping it healthy, offsetting its Life Orb recoil and letting it freely throw out its powerful STAB Thunder. Its main selling point is its Water immunity; this allows it to provide relief against Pokemon that would otherwise serve as enormous threats to rain teams like Keldeo and Belly Drum Azumarill. Its great Speed tier also makes it faster than the aforementioned Keldeo in addition to other threats like Zarude and Salamence, and its typing alongside its decent special bulk lets it beat special Aegislash and Regieleki one-on-one, which are typically huge threats for rain teams. Heliolisk's main downfall is its pitiful physical bulk; just about any strong physical attack will OHKO it or come very close, somewhat diminishing its ability to check the likes of Azumarill and Barraskewda. It's also weak to Keldeo's Fighting STAB, so switching Heliolisk into Keldeo can be quite risky. While Heliolisk is extremely potent under rain and arguably the best Electric-type one can use in this role, it struggles to set itself apart from the likes of Thundurus-T and Rotom-W on other teams, restricting it almost solely to the rain archetype.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Heavy-Duty Boots set can be used outside of rain teams, functioning as a decent offensive pivot that can still check Pokemon like Keldeo while being decent against opposing rain. However, it faces competition from Rotom-W due to its better typing and defensive utility. Weather Ball can be used over Surf or Grass Knot for its greater power in the rain and ability to OHKO Venusaur in sun, but it's less reliable and doesn't obtain any notable OHKOs.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: While the former two fear Surf, Ground-types like Choice Scarf Krookodile, Nidoking, and Seismitoad can check Heliolisk fairly well outside of rain thanks to their ability to stomach a Hyper Voice. Gastrodon counters Heliolisk lacking Grass Knot without much trouble.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Assault Vest Tangrowth and Amoonguss can check Heliolisk quite well, though the latter must be wary of switching into Hyper Voice as it is a 2HKO after Stealth Rock. Zarude can tank any hit from Heliolisk and OHKO it with Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: While they don't like switching into repeated Volt Switches, Pokemon like Chansey, Umbreon, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro can handle Heliolisk quite easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Heliolisk's Speed tier is good, but faster Pokemon like Lycanroc-D and Zygarde-10% as well as Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Zarude Lycanroc-D cause massive issues for it, preying on its terrible physical bulk to easily KO it.</p> ",

Hyper Voice hits Electric-resistant Pokemon like Zarude and Kommo-o hard in addition to 2HKOing Amoonguss after Stealth Rock damage. Surf nukes Ground-types like Krookodile, Rhyperior, and Nidoking with ease in the rain. Grass Knot can be used instead for its ability to hit Ground-types outside of rain while also hitting Seismitoad and Gastrodon, but its lower power against the likes of Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Krookodile means it isn't preferred.</p> <p>Heliolisk is only used on rain teams as an effective wallbreaker and check to opposing rain. As a result, Pelipper is a mandatory teammate, setting up the rain to boost Heliolisk's power and longevity. They also have decent defensive synergy, with Pelipper pivoting into Ground-types like Seismitoad and Gastrodon for Heliolisk, while Heliolisk can check the likes of Regieleki and Rotom-W in return. Barraskewda is an exceptional wallbreaker and sweeper on rain teams that appreciates Heliolisk's ability to weaken Grass-types like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Zarude and is capable of outspeeding and KOing faster threats for Heliolisk in return, such as Choice Scarf Mienshao and Dragon Dance Salamence. It also muscles through specially bulky Pokemon like Chansey and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro. Other Water-type wallbreakers like Keldeo and Crawdaunt can trade with the Grass-types Heliolisk struggles with or take advantage of Heliolisk's ability to weaken them itself before going down, making them very effective partners. Flying-types such as Salamence and Tornadus appreciate Heliolisk's ability to bring them in safely on Grass-type Pokemon so that they can launch their mighty Hurricanes. Grass-types of your own like Tangrowth and Amoonguss are also appreciated teammates for Heliolisk, being able to check threats such as Keldeo locked into Secret Sword, Lycanroc-D, and Choice Scarf Krookodile. Entry hazard support from the likes of Jirachi and Chansey is necessary for Heliolisk to get a lot of OHKOs and 2HKOs on Pokemon like Primarina and Amoonguss.

Mystical Fire allows it to threaten certain Steel-types like Celesteela and Aegislash on the switch relatively well. Unfortunately, offensive Steel- and Poison-types like Jirachi and Nidoking are fairly common and can immediately threaten Sylveon upon entering the field. While Sylveon appreciates being able to use Heal Bell and Mystical Fire, it does not have room for both and must choose between healing status or the ability to threaten Steel-types on the switch. While a great Wish passer, using it for Sylveon's own recovery is suboptimal, as Sylveon requires two turns and using Protect to fully utilize it. Jirachi gives Sylveon some competition as a Wish passer, as it has the ability to use U-turn after Wish for a cleaner pass. Chansey is also a Pokemon that can wall most special threats other than Keldeo while also healing status.</p> ",

Additionally, Nihilego and Galarian Slowbro can freely set up against Sylveon if it is not running Mystical Fire.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Sylveon has no way to threaten Fire-types like Rotom-H and Moltres. This allows Rotom-H and Moltres to set up with Nasty Plot for free and restore HP with Roost, respectively.

Mystical Fire threatens Steel-types like Jirachi and Aegislash, although since most of those Pokemon also threaten Sylveon right back, it should primarily only be used on the switch. It also helps against certain special attackers that may try to switch into Sylveon like Nidoqueen and Nihilego while also preventing the latter from gaining Special Attack boosts with Meteor Beam. Heal Bell is an option that allows Sylveon to act as one of the only functional clerics in the tier, preventing foes like Rotom-W and Togekiss from freely spreading status.

Combined with priority Thunder Wave, this easily distinguishes it from other Steel-types in the tier, particularly Aegislash and Jirachi. Klefki's base stats are rather subpar, making it very passive and stopping it from maximizing its great defensive typing. Its mediocre bulk and lack of recovery cause Klefki to struggle with checking powerful threats like Buzzwole and Lycanroc-D, while its lackluster offensive presence limits it to using status or Foul Play against Pokemon it cannot hit super effectively. Klefki struggles to pressure many entry hazard removers, particularly the Rotom formes, forcing it to run Toxic if it wants to cripple them.</p> ",

Defog is an option, but Klefki is greatly outclassed in this role by better Pokemon like Salamence and Rotom-W.

It also helps to wear down bulky Pokemon that Klefki has trouble checking, such as Rhyperior and Chansey. Thunder Wave slows down opposing Pokemon such as Keldeo and Nihilego, which gives its slower teammates more opportunities to wallbreak. It also provides Klefki with a safety net against Speed-boosting setup sweepers, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Swords Dance + Scale Shot Kommo-o.

    "overview": "<p>Diancie is a reliable Stealth Rock setter for balance and bulky offense teams that also checks many of the strongest offensive threats in UU. Respectable offensive stats and strong mixed coverage in Diamond Storm, Moonblast, and Mystical Fire make it more versatile than other Stealth Rock setters. Diancie's typing and bulk allow it to check threats like Salamence, Galarian Moltres, Thundurus-T, and Kommo-o, although a lack of reliable recovery makes it hard to check multiple threats at once. Diancie doesn't fit as easily onto multiple team compositions as Krookodile and Rhyperior, but it offers unique role compression that makes it the perfect fit for certain teams. Because of its Rock typing, Diancie has a variety of weaknesses that limit the Pokemon it can effectively wall, and its lackluster Speed means it gets heavily damaged by slower wallbreakers like Primarina and Diggersby. While Diancie's mixed coverage is strong enough to punish frailer, more offensive teams, bulky offensive threats like Primarina can switch in without any fear of being 2HKOed.</p> ",

It also allows Diancie to pressure Pokemon like Thundurus-T, Chandelure, Moltres, and Galarian Moltres, but make sure to be careful of its low PP. Moonblast deals with threats like Kommo-o, Krookodile, and Buzzwole. Mystical Fire deals respectable damage to Pokemon like Aegislash and Jirachi that otherwise wall Diancie. Also, the guaranteed Special Attack drop makes pivoting around threats like bulky Primarina and Nidoking much easier. Alternatively, Heal Bell gives Diancie utility as a cleric and allows it to extend its own and its teammates' longevity, further improving its excellent matchup against Defoggers like Rotom-H and Salamence. 32 Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO on Thundurus-T, and 96 Defense EVs ensure that Diancie isn't 2HKOed by Life Orb Kommo-o's Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage.

In return, it offers a crucial check to wallbreakers like Galarian Moltres that could typically dismantle defensive cores. Moltres is a phenomenal partner, offering a Ground-type immunity and a resistance to Grass- and Steel-type moves—additionally, Moltres's Flame Body can cripple threats like Jirachi and Mienshao as they pivot with U-turn. Similarly, Rocky Helmet Buzzwole pairs well with Diancie, as it punishes physical threats that try and use Diancie as momentum and covers several of its type weaknesses. Diancie pairs well with bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss, as they account for its weaknesses to Water- and Ground-type moves like Keldeo's Hydro Pump and Krookodile's Earthquake. Diancie appreciates entry hazard removal; Tentacruel makes a great partner due to its ability to check Primarina and Keldeo and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Defog users like Salamence and Rotom-W can work well too. Diancie works well with offensive Pokemon like Zarude and Buzzwole, which appreciate its ability to switch into Moltres and defensive Salamence and remove status with Heal Bell.</p> "

Volcanion's defensive typing also gives it resistances to STAB attacks from powerful Pokemon such as Azumarill, Barraskewda, and Primarina, and its good bulk lets it trade with Pokemon like Aegislash and Zarude. Its movepool allows it to threaten Pokemon that resist its STAB combination like Primarina with Sludge Bomb and cripple defensive answers like Seismitoad with Toxic.

Stun Spore prevents Ribombee from being dead weight against Steel-types like Aegislash, Jirachi, and Celesteela.

Necrozma is also a good option for a Stealth Rock setter that can pressure common Defoggers with its strong Meteor Beam and Photon Geyser, OHKOing the likes of Moltres and Tentacruel. Keldeo becomes even scarier than usual when backed up by Sticky Web support, and its good defensive typing and generally solid bulk allow it to act as a soft check to Pokemon that typically annoy these teams like Entei and Mamoswine. Teammates that can handle rain teams, such as Gyarados and the aforementioned Keldeo, are also very important due to the playstyle's naturally solid matchup against other forms of hyper offense. Other generally good Pokemon that take advantage of Sticky Web include Buzzwole, Entei, and Nidoking, all of which can put huge pressure on the Steel-types that try to take advantage of Ribombee.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Lycanroc-D is a potent revenge killer due to its strong Tough Claws-boosted priority move in Accelerock, which enables it to revenge kill weakened Dragon Dance Salamence and +2 Speed Galarian Moltres, and high Speed, which lets it outspeed Keldeo and Nihilego. Access to strong coverage moves, such as Close Combat to break past Krookodile, Crunch to deal with Aegislash, and Psychic Fangs to break past Kommo-o makes Lycanroc-D one of the toughest Pokemon to wall in the tier. However, Lycanroc-D struggles to break through teams that run physically bulky threats such as Tangrowth and Buzzwole. Its poor bulk also means it cannot come in on almost anything, so it requires moves such as U-turn and Volt Switch to come in safely as well as occasional aggressive prediction on expected switches. Lycanroc-D is also very prone to wearing itself down with Life Orb recoil, limiting its staying presence on the field.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance is an option that allows Lycanroc-D to OHKO foes like Amoonguss and Tangrowth at +2; however, it can struggle to find many opportunities to set up safely. Drill Run is nice to give Lycanroc-D excellent Rock- and Ground-type neutral coverage, but the only notable Pokemon it hits super effectively is Colbur Berry Galarian Slowbro. A Focus Sash lead Lycanroc-D is able to use Endeavor while setting up Stealth Rock, but this is generally not worth it in comparison to its other, much more dynamic sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu do not switch into Stone Edge well, but they resist Close Combat and threaten Lycanroc-D after switching in; the former also runs Rocky Helmet often, which punishes Lycanroc-D. Tangrowth is the biggest offender, since unboosted Close Combat damage is restored nearly completely by Regenerator, it commonly uses Rocky Helmet, and it can freely threaten Lycanroc-D's team in multiple ways after it comes in. Choice Scarf Zarude takes Accelrock well and can OHKO it with Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Choice Scarf Jirachi resists Lycanroc-D's Accelrock and can revenge kill it with Iron Head, only having to fear the rare Sucker Punch. Unless carrying the necessary coverage, Aegislash can safely pivot into Lycanroc-D multiple times and threaten to OHKO with either of its STAB moves. Aegislash can also remove Lycanroc-D if weakened into Shadow Sneak Range.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Foes like Suicune and Gastrodon that don't fall to one hit and are capable of firing back with super effective attacks pose problems for Lycanroc-D, which has to be kept in reserve while its teammates wear them down. Starmie naturally outspeeds and can threaten Lycanroc-D, though it must be wary of its health to avoid being taken out by Accelrock. Azumarill and Crawdaunt can take an Accelrock from Lycanroc-D unless they are severely weakened and revenge kill it with Aqua Jet in return.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Choice Scarf users that are not in range of its priority are able to revenge kill Lycanroc-D due to its frailty; Mienshao, Diggersby, and Krookodile are all notable for their resistance to Accelerock and ability to OHKO Lycanroc-D with their STAB moves. Raikou has to mind its HP when around Lycanroc-D, but so does Lycanroc-D, as its bulk makes it take heavy damage from Scald.</p> ",

Alternatively, Psychic Fangs is an option that inflicts heavy damage on the likes of Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and offensive Buzzwole. However, most of the targets Psychic Fangs hits can be muscled through with Stone Edge after they have taken decent chip damage. Close Combat is a powerful coverage option that nails many Rock resistant Pokemon such as Keldeo, Krookodile, and Kommo-o. Crunch hits Aegislash, Jirachi, and Galarian Slowbro harder. Accelerock is useful against offense teams, specifically keeping threats such Agility-boosted Galarian Moltres and Dragon Dance Salamence in check. It also makes Lycanroc-D more difficult to revenge kill with faster threats such as Venusaur in sun and Starmie. Sucker Punch can be used to deal more damage than Accelerock against neutral targets; however, it is only really useful for a better matchup against Choice Scarf Jirachi. A Life Orb is used to guarantee feats such as 2HKOing defensive Celesteela with Close Combat and Amoonguss with Stone Edge on the switch with Stealth Rock up. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is needed to make Lycanroc-D outspeed and threaten as many foes as it can, particularly Keldeo.</p> <p>Lycanroc-D fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to revenge kill common offensive threats such as Salamence without sacrificing its teammates' wallbreaking capabilities. As Lycanroc-D is unable to switch in on mostly anything, pivots are appreciated to give it opportunities to punch holes as often as possible and gain momentum; Moltres and Rotom-H are efficient at this and help pressure Buzzwole and bulky Grass-types, which usually give Lycanroc-D grief. Entry hazards allow Lycanroc-D to leave greater dents in otherwise solid answers such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth, although residual damage from its foes' Rocky Helmet and its own Life Orb will noticeably sting. Krookodile is a great Stealth Rock setter that draws out Buzzwole and Amoonguss to remove their Rocky Helmets with Knock Off. Special attackers such as Moltres and Primarina appreciate Lycanroc-D's ability to break through Chansey, and in return they can help wear down common physically defensive threats such as Buzzwole for it. The Grass-types of the tier like Tangrowth and Zarude are excellent partners to handle threats such as Azumarill. Additionally, they also check faster Pokemon Lycanroc-D cannot threaten as much with its priority, such as Raikou and Zygarde-10%. Early-game wallbreakers like Kommo-o and Aegislash can pave the way for a Lycanroc-D sweep by weakening foes like Amoonguss and Buzzwole for it.</p> "

This is complemented by its solid bulk, great typing, and ability, which let it naturally check and take advantage of Pokemon like Aegislash, Rotom-H, and Tangrowth. Swords Dance Kommo-o is a fantastic wallbreaker that can destroy tier staples like Chansey and Aegislash after a boost, while Clangorous Soul Kommo-o is a dangerous late-game wincon that can easily set up and clean once checks like Primarina and Galarian Slowbro have been weakened. Mixed Kommo-o is a solid offensive Stealth Rock setter and wallbreaker that can pressure the metagame with its fantastic coverage. Kommo-o can also run a defensive Stealth Rock set that can check common Pokemon like Zarude and Aegislash. Despite all its positive traits, Kommo-o faces heavy competition from Salamence, which offers similar defensive utility against Pokemon like Zarude but is more more consistent due to Intimidate and Roost. It also faces competition from Keldeo as a Fighting-type wallbreaker due to it having a much better Speed tier to outspeed Pokemon like Nihilego and Krookodile. Kommo-o's middling Speed tier also makes it easily revenge killed by a reasonable portion of the tier, including Pokemon like Salamence and Moltres; the latter is particularly troublesome, as it can easily switch into Kommo-o consistently. Kommo-o also lacks recovery and is easily worn down through chip damage and entry hazards; common Pokemon like Lycanroc-D also often run coverage such as Psychic Fangs, meaning Kommo-o can struggle to reliably check these Pokemon before their sets are revealed.</p> ",

Soundproof is a niche choice on mixed sets to check opposing Clangorous Soul Kommo-o for teams that would otherwise struggle with it. It also helps against the rare Toxtricity and Sylveon. Roar on defensive sets can rack up entry hazard damage on teams with Spikes and force out Pokemon like Nasty Plot + RestTalk Galarian Moltres and Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro. Toxic tends to be more valuable to cripple switch-ins like Salamence, however, and Kommo-o cannot phaze other setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill.

Outrage is a stronger option to hit Amoonguss harder, but it locks Kommo-o in and leaves it vulnerable to Fairy-types like Primarina. Scale Shot is an option to boost Kommo-o's Speed, allowing it to surpass its main flaw, but this leaves it extremely vulnerable to Choice Scarf users like Krookodile due to the Defense drop, and the move's inconsistency makes it too much of a gamble. Close Combat nails foes like Celesteela, Umbreon, and Chansey. Earthquake is vital to deal with Aegislash, which otherwise walls this set. It's also useful for Pokémon like Nidoking, Galarian Slowbro, and Jirachi. Poison Jab is an option for a more secure hit on Fairy-types like Primarina, Hatterene, and Tapu Bulu, but the loss in coverage to hit Aegislash is generally not worth it, and Earthquake is oftentimes enough to 2HKO the former two. Leftovers gives Kommo-o more longevity to set up more times, while Life Orb allows Kommo-o to 2HKO Amoonguss with Outrage and Celesteela with Close Combat without boosting. Bulletproof is the preferred ability to take advantage of Aegislash locked into Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb Tangrowth, but Overcoat can be used if Amoonguss is problematic for your team.

Moltres and Rotom-H greatly help by threatening most of Kommo-o's defensive checks in Buzzwole, Aegislash, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth with their nuclear Fire-type STAB moves. They can also bring Kommo-o in safely with their respective pivot moves. Chansey helps immensely against special attackers that threaten to stop Kommo-o's sweep, like Primarina, Thundurus-T, and Salamence. Roserade, Krookodile, and Nihilego can aid Kommo-o by setting up entry hazards. The former can set up Spikes and switch into bulkier versions of Primarina, while the latter two set Stealth Rock to help Kommo-o break through checks like Buzzwole and Amoonguss. Nidoking, Salamence, and Aegislash help against Tapu Bulu if Kommo-o isn't running Poison Jab.

    "overview": "<p>Nihilego stands out as a great utility Pokémon that also boasts high offensive stats. Its good STAB combination hits key Pokemon such as Thundurus-T, Salamence, Tangrowth, and Primarina super effectively. It has important resistances like Flying, Fairy, and Fire; its Flying resistance and high Special Defense in particular are appreciated by teams that struggle with Flying-types like Thundurus-T and Galarian Moltres. Nihilego is an amazing Stealth Rock setter, as its resistances give very good matchups against Defoggers such as Salamence, Moltres, and Rotom-H. Its Knock Off is useful for common switch-ins like Chansey, Aegislash, and Celesteela. It can use Meteor Beam as well to boost its Special Attack and become a fierce sweeper. Its unique Speed tier puts it ahead of Salamence, Thundurus-T, and Moltres, and after a Speed boost from Beast Boost, it only falls behind Choice Scarf Zarude and Choice Scarf Mienshao. However, its weaknesses and horrid Defense stat leave it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Nidoking, Jirachi, and Keldeo, and priority from the likes of Conkeldurr, Azumarill, and Crawdaunt easily shuts down its sweeps. It lacks room for coverage for Pokemon like Nidoking, and it just cannot get past checks like Jirachi and Aegislash.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic Spikes is a secondary entry hazard option that weakens defensive staples like Assault Vest Tangrowth and cripples Substitute users such as Primarina and Raikou. However, Poison-types remove it and a large portion of the metagame is immune to it, like Rotom-H, Salamence, Celesteela, and Aegislash. A Choice Scarf set with Power Gem / Sludge Wave / Thunderbolt / Grass Knot lets Nihilego clean through teams and revenge kill Pokemon like Keldeo and other Choice Scarf users like Krookodile, but Choice-locked Nihilego is vulnerable to Pokemon like Aegislash and Azumarill. Pain Split can be considered as a form of recovery on the utility set, but it is very unreliable due to Nihilego's high HP and can only be used against special attackers that can't hurt it much. Dazzling Gleam OHKOes Kommo-o and maintains coverage for Krookodile but has no use outside of that. Psychic hits Kommo-o, opposing Nihilego, and Nidoking, but just like Dazzling Gleam, it is not worth running most times.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is Nihilego's best answer, capable of wearing it down with Seismic Toss and healing itself with Soft-Boiled. As long as Chansey doesn't let it accumulate several boosts, it can always beat Nihilego. Chansey hates having its Eviolite removed, though.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Krookodile, Nidoking, Seismitoad, and Rhyperior don't care about Nihilego's STAB moves and can force it out of the field with their STAB Ground-type moves, but they have to be wary of Grass Knot and get crippled by Knock Off. Zygarde-10% outspeeds Nihilego and can OHKO it with Thousand Arrows.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Jirachi walls Nihilego easily and can scare it out with Iron Head and Thunder Wave. Cobalion can pivot into Nihilego's attacks and exploit its weak physical defense. Celesteela is capable of taking +1 Thunderbolt and OHKOing Nihilego back with Heavy Slam. Aegislash easily switches into even boosted Nihilego and can KO it with its Steel-type STAB move or revenge kill it with Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users: Faster threats like Keldeo, Lycanroc-D, and Azelf all outspeed and threaten to OHKO Nihilego. However, these Pokemon must be wary of Nihilego getting a speed boost after getting a KO on its Meteor Beam set. Priority users like Azumarill and Crawdaunt can OHKO Nihilego with their priority moves.</p> ",

Knock Off cripples checks to Nihilego like Aegislash, Chansey, and Celesteela. It's also great for removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Defoggers. Grass Knot eliminates Pokemon that don't mind Power Gem + Sludge Wave, like Seismitoad and Rhyperior. However, the utility Knock Off provides is amazing, and it's only worth replacing if Nihilego's team has enough other Knock Off users.

Nihilego's team appreciates its good defensive typing and Knock Off, and its offensive capabilities are valuable for removing threats like Primarina and Salamence. Stall in particular appreciates Nihilego's good matchup against Nasty Plot Togekiss. Setup sweepers such as Salamence, Thundurus-T, and Keldeo love Nihilego setting up Stealth Rock and weakening their checks like Assault Vest Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Celesteela. Teammates like Azelf, Krookodile, and Tangrowth provide Knock Off support, giving Nihilego the option of running Grass Knot. Amoonguss and Buzzwole can check physical threats to Nihilego like Krookodile and Mienshao, while Nihilego checks Fire-types like Moltres. Aegislash has notable defensive synergy with Nihilego, as it checks Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, Lycanroc-D, and Kommo-o. Moltres and Rotom-H deal with Steel-types that wall Nihilego, like Aegislash and Jirachi. Chansey completely walls this set even after having its Eviolite removed, so wallbreakers like Lycanroc-D and Buzzwole should take care of it.

  "Buzzwole": {
    "overview": "<p>Buzzwole's immense physical bulk, power, and useful typing make it suitable as either a premier defensive wall or a potent offensive threat. Defensively, Buzzwole walls Pokemon like Zarude, Zygarde-10%, Conkeldurr, and Krookodile with ease while wearing them down with Rocky Helmet and keeping its own health high with Roost. As an offensive threat, 139 base Attack allows it to break through defensive cores like Chansey + Assault Vest Tangrowth and pick up KOs while boosting its own power with Beast Boost. Life Orb sets can use Roost to keep Buzzwole's health high and tear holes in the opposing team, while Choice Scarf sets can use Beast Boost to sweep through weakened teams. Buzzwole's biggest weakness is being limited to only four moves: defensive sets have to choose between being walled by Tentacruel and Aegislash without Earthquake or Tangrowth and Amoonguss without Ice Punch, while offensive sets have to choose between dropping Ice Punch and struggling to break through Amoonguss or dropping Stone Edge and struggling to break through Moltres. Additionally, Buzzwole's 4x weakness to Flying means that common Flying-types like Salamence and Moltres pose a huge threat to defensive and offensive sets alike. Finally, Buzzwole's middling Speed tier and subpar special bulk force non-Choice Scarf sets to switch out against Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Keldeo.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Buzzwole can run a Choice Band set with similar coverage to the Choice Scarf set, but the extra damage boost over the Life Orb set often isn't worth the loss in flexibility and reliable recovery. A Bulk Up set can be utilized with Leftovers and Roost, but it's easily forced out by special attackers and lacks the upfront power of the Life Orb set. More importantly, Buzzwole can only run two attacking moves, so it's consistently forced out by Pokemon like Salamence, Aegislash, or Moltres depending on which coverage it opts for. Other item options can be used on defensive Buzzwole like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots, but Rocky Helmet is usually preferred to punish U-turn and other physical attacks. Buzzwole has other coverage moves like Dual Wingbeat for opposing Buzzwole and Thunder Punch for Gyarados, but they are generally outclassed by Stone Edge and Poison Jab. Substitute can be run alongside Focus Punch to ease prediction and deal heavy damage, but this futher limits Buzzwole's moveslots and is generally outclassed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers: Buzzwole has minimal special bulk, leaving it vulnerable to even neutral special attacks from faster special attackers like Thundurus-T, Nidoking, Rotom-W, and Keldeo.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: While Buzzwole sets can run the coverage necessary to break through certain physical walls, every set will run into certain Pokemon it fails to KO. Defensive Pokemon like opposing Buzzwole, Aegislash, Tentacruel, and Primarina can all potentially wall Buzzwole depending on the coverage it lacks.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types like Rotom-H and Moltres can switch into some of Buzzwole's moves and easily threaten it. While they need to be careful about Stone Edge and are outsped by Choice Scarf Buzzwole, they're still effective checks.

Earthquake hits Steel-types like Jirachi and Aegislash as well as Poison-types like Tentacruel and Nidoqueen. Stone Edge OHKOes Moltres and Gyarados and deals heavy damage to Salamence. Alternatively, Ice Punch guarantees the OHKO on maximum HP Salamence after Intimidate and deals heavy damage to Grass-types like Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth.

    "overview": "<p>Celesteela's typing and defensive stats are both fantastic, allowing it to check a considerable portion of UU's top threats, including Salamence, Jirachi, Nihilego, and Zarude. Thanks to its decent offensive stats, powerful STAB Heavy Slam, and access to Flamethrower to smack foes like Aegislash and Zarude, Celesteela can prevent itself from being too passive. Leech Seed is also an excellent tool, sustaining Celesteela's longevity and allowing it to significantly wear down its switch-ins, such as Rotom-H and Thundurus-T, potentially forcing them out. Autotomize sets are also a strong option, tapping into Celesteela's strong special coverage and the sweeping potential Beast Boost lends it. Despite its defensive potency, however, Celesteela suffers a bit from its lack of access to reliable recovery, which can prevent it from tanking strong neutral hits as consistently as it would like to and cause it to be overreliant on Leftovers. This can allow a few common Pokemon, such as Keldeo, Mienshao, and Mamoswine, to muscle past Celesteela after relatively minimal chip damage. Celesteela also struggles to bypass popular Fire- and Electric-types such as Moltres and Rotom-W on its own, as well as various defensive picks like Tentacruel and Gastrodon; Tentacruel can utilize Liquid Ooze to take advantage of Leech Seed, while Gastrodon doesn't take meaningful damage from any of Celesteela's attacks, can restore any damage it sustains with Recover, and can threaten to chip Celesteela down with burns from Scald.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Celesteela's physical movepool contains solid options like Earthquake and Stone Edge, which allow it to run a physically based Autotomize set, effectively luring checks like Tentacruel and Rotom-H. However, this generally isn't as effective due to Celesteela's middling immediate power and hardships breaking various Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Intimidate Krookodile. Earthquake is an option in the fourth slot of the defensive set to still hit Steel-types super effectively while also hitting the likes of Tentacruel and Raikou hard. However, Flamethrower is usually way more valuable for its ability to pressure Zarude while still hitting Steel-types. Toxic cripples some of Celesteela's switch-ins on the defensive set, but it generally isn't as useful as its other options, and, due to foregoing Flamethrower, it notably prevents Celesteela from doing anything to Steel-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types like Moltres, Volcanion, Rotom-H, and Chandelure can pivot in on both Heavy Slam and Flamethrower and hit Celesteela hard with super effective STAB moves. They can also blanket check Celesteela's Autotomize set if it opts for Flash Cannon, though Meteor Beam can power through them. Moltres is particularly annoying, often being able to restore any chip damage it sustains from Leech Seed with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Raikou can tank hits from either of Celesteela's sets and proceed to break past it with super effective STAB attacks, though they all take fair damage from Meteor Beam.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Chansey doesn't take major damage from Celesteela's attacks and can whittle it down with Seismic Toss or bring in a teammate with Teleport. Gastrodon can tank hits from any set and heal off chip damage from Leech Seed with Recover, additionally utilizing Scald to potentially burn Celesteela. Tentacruel's Liquid Ooze punishes Leech Seed attempts and it doesn't take major damage from any attack Celesteela commonly runs. If it is running Haze, it can also stint the Autotomize set's progress.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Celesteela's defensive set becomes far easier to wear down if Leftovers, its most reliable means of passive recovery, has been removed.

Fire Blast provides important coverage against Steel-types like Aegislash and Jirachi. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for its greater accuracy. However, Celesteela wants all the power it can get due to this set's nature as a sweeper. Meteor Beam grants Celesteela an opportunity to bypass Fire-types like Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure. It also deals massive damage to foes like Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Salamence, and the Special Attack boost it supplies is often extremely useful in boosting Celesteela's sweeping capabilities. Due to taking two turns, however, it must be used with Power Herb, and Celesteela must watch out for the opponent predicting the attack and bringing in a foe that resists it due to often being restricted to a one-time use. Flash Cannon is also an option in the fourth slot, offering more overall consistency and giving Celesteela a strong secondary STAB attack that deals decent neutral damage and hits Pokemon like Hatterene, Nihilego, and Rhyperior super effectively. Giga Drain is an option to bypass Quagsire, Rhyperior, and Rotom-W, which can otherwise tank various hits, though it generally doesn't provide too valuable of coverage otherwise. Beast Boost lets Celesteela boost its Special Attack upon netting KOs, giving it great sweeping potential. If Meteor Beam is not being run, Celesteela has no need for Power Herb and can then run Weakness Policy. This allows it to use its solid bulk to tank super effective hits, such as Fire-type moves from Salamence or opposing Celesteela, to gain a +2 boost in power, which heavily increases its threat level. This is particularly potent when Celesteela is behind dual screens, as often the only way to break past it at that rate is with super effective moves.</p> <p>This set fits on offensive builds, acting as a late-game sweeper that cleans weakened teams. Hyper offense teams do particularly well supporting Celesteela, sometimes employing dual screens setters like Alolan Ninetales to increase its odds of reliably setting up. Entry hazards let Celesteela muscle past foes like Rotom-W more easily, making setters like Krookodile good options for teammates. On hyper offense teams, leads like Froslass work well for its ability to quickly set Spikes and keep up momentum with Destiny Bond, respectively. Powerful wallbreakers like Mienshao and Entei make strong teammates, weakening teams for Celesteela to sweep through late-game. Depending on the coverage it opts for, Celesteela will struggle to reliably break past various Pokemon. If it isn't running Meteor Beam, checks to Fire-types like Keldeo and Rhyperior are great teammates, easily being able to pressure Rotom-H and Moltres. Without Flash Cannon, Celesteela can't hit Rock-types like Rhyperior and Nihilego super effectively, making Pokemon like Keldeo and Zygarde-10% solid partners. Zarude can pivot in on Electric-types like Rotom-W and make decent progress with its pivoting capabilities, while Seismitoad can handle Raikou, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H while tanking hits from and crippling Thundurus-T. Additionally, it offers utility with Stealth Rock and Knock Off.

    "overview": "<p>Necrozma is a dangerous sweeper in UU thanks to its offensive versatility, allowing it to bypass traditional answers like Chansey and Celesteela with its unpredictability. Its Meteor Beam set is a powerful sweeper that can run through metagame staples like Rotom-W and Salamence. On the other hand, its Dragon Dance set is equally as potent, allowing it to lure in and beat answers to the Meteor Beam set like Chansey and Assault Vest Reuniclus. Its Calm Mind set can utilize its high bulk to act as a sweeper while also blanket checking threats like Lycanroc-D. Necrozma's high natural bulk and Prism Armor allow it to set up on many Pokemon like Nihilego and non-Leech Life Buzzwole as well as take super effective hits from threats like Lycanroc-D and even Aegislash. Necrozma also has a solid matchup against common entry hazard removers like Salamence and Tentacruel, letting it act as an offensive Stealth Rock setter capable of supporting its team. However, Necrozma heavily dislikes status from threats like Chansey and Aegislash, which limits its chance to sweep. Necrozma is also limited by the number of faster threats in the tier like Zarude and Krookodile, which can hinder it from setting up and sweeping through teams. Overreliance on Power Herb on Necrozma's Meteor Beam set makes it hard to pull off a sweep at times with Pokemon like Krookodile being common, while both Dragon Dance and Calm Mind sets can be worn down before they can accumulate multiple boosts.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Necrozma can run Expanding force over Photon Geyser on its Meteor Beam set on Psychic Terrain teams for more devastating damage, but the limited viability of the playstyle and reliance on Terrain being active make Photon Geyser the preferred option. It can also run a defensive utility set with Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and Thunder Wave, but Jirachi can utilize this set better with its additional Steel typing and U-turn, even if lacking Knock Off. A final option is a Stored Power set with Cosmic Power or Calm Mind to boost Necrozma's stats, but it lacks the dangerous immediate sweeping potential of Necrozma's other sets and can be inconsistent at times.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Choice Scarf Krookodile and Zarude can easily revenge kill Necrozma, even at +1 Speed from Dragon Dance. However, if Necrozma uses Autotomize, it can threaten them before they attack. Umbreon can tank hits from all sets and cripple it with Toxic. Although it must watch out for Meteor Beam, Galarian Moltres's high special bulk lets it take on Necrozma.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls like Chansey and Assault Vest Reuniclus can take on the Meteor Beam set with ease. However, both must watch out for the Dragon Dance set. Celesteela walls the Dragon Dance set and can take a boosted Heat Wave while wearing down Necrozma with Leech Seed, but it can get overwhelmed easily. Hatterene can take boosted attacks from Necrozma and lower its Special Attack with Mystical Fire.</p> <p><strong>Status: Status is detrimental to Necrozma's attempts to sweep, so moves like Thunder Wave from Togekiss and Toxic from Aegislash and Chansey greatly hinder it.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>In conjunction with Power Herb, Meteor Beam is a powerful attack capable of wiping out Pokemon like Salamence, Galarian Moltres, and Incineroar while simultaneously giving Necrozma a boost to its Special Attack in one turn. Since Power Herb is single use, it should be saved until special walls like Chansey are gone. Photon Geyser is Necrozma's primary move to power through many Pokemon like Keldeo and Amoonguss. It is also able to ignore abilities like Quagsire's Unaware. Heat Wave melts Steel-types like Aegislash and Jirachi as well as Grass-types like Zarude and Tangrowth. It is also Necrozma's most reliable option for damaging Krookodile and Hatterene. Autotomize lets Necrozma boost its Speed to outpace the fastest Choice Scarf users in Zarude and Mienshao as well as Pokemon like Seismitoad under rain. Alternatively, Necrozma can utilize Stealth Rock to act as an entry hazard setter for its team thanks to its good matchup against common entry hazard removers like Salamence and Rotom-H. Modest is the preferred nature to maximize damage output, since after an Autotomize, Necrozma outspeeds the fastest Choice Scarf users. Even if Stealth Rock is chosen, Modest is still preferred, since Necrozma doesn't miss out on many important Speed tiers.</p> <p>Necrozma best fits on offense teams as a late-game cleaner once its answers have been removed. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Krookodile, Nihilego, and Kommo-o wears down Pokemon like Celesteela and Hatterene for Necrozma to break through them more easily and allows Necrozma to drop Stealth Rock for Autotomize. Krookodile and Nihilego can also cripple special walls like Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro and Reuniclus with Knock Off. Early-game wallbreakers like Belly Drum Azumarill, Life Orb Buzzwole, and Diggersby can muscle through special walls like Chansey and Assault Vest Reuniclus for Necrozma. Buzzwole in particular can break through Umbreon, a hard counter to Necrozma, as well as answer faster threats like Mienshao, Krookodile, and Zarude for it. Mienshao can bring in Necrozma on Pokemon it can set up on like Amoonguss and Buzzwole while also threatening Umbreon and Chansey for Necrozma. Sticky Web support from Ribombee help offset Necrozma's average Speed tier, allowing it to forego Autotomize for Stealth Rock if the team needs to as well as outspeed and remove threats like Keldeo, Lycanroc-D, and even Barraskewda under rain if it manages to get an Autotomize off beforehand.</p> "

X-Scissor OHKOes Zarude and deals great damage to Krookodile, Reuniclus, and Tangrowth, and Earthquake bypasses Steel-types such as Aegislash and Jirachi. It is also Necrozma's best option to damage threats like Hatterene and Entei. With Lum Berry, Necrozma can set up on Pokemon like Amoonguss, Rotom-W, and Chansey, which would normally stay in to cripple it with status. Alternatively, since Prism Armor lets Necrozma take weak super effective hits like Knock Off from Nihilego with ease, Necrozma can employ a Weakness Policy to get a huge boost to its Attack. Adamant is the preferred nature, since Necrozma outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame barring Choice Scarf users like Krookodile after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>This set also fits on offense teams as a powerful late-game sweeper. Celesteela is problematic for this particular set, so powerful wallbreakers like Buzzwole and Thundurus-T can remove it. Buzzwole also helps check Krookodile for Necrozma, and both of them can wear down walls like Aegislash, Chansey, and Primarina for Necrozma to bypass them more easily. Sticky Web support from Ribombee help offset Necrozma's average Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Zarude after a Dragon Dance. Other entry hazard support from Pokemon like Krookodile and Roserade wears down Pokemon like Celesteela and Hatterene. Zarude and the aforementioned Krookodile can also check Aegislash, a Pokemon Necrozma struggles with if it is healthy. Dark-type checks like Primarina and Azumarill make great partners for Necrozma, beating threats like Umbreon, Krookodile, and Galarian Moltres. Psychic Terrain support from Indeedee-F allows Necrozma to boost its damage output without fearing priority from Azumarill or Lycanroc-D if weakened. It also can provide Healing Wish support to patch up Necrozma, allowing it to sweep later in the game.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Necrozma can set up with Calm Mind against Pokemon that cannot OHKO it like Salamence and Nihilego, making it harder to be bypassed by more powerful special attackers like Keldeo as well as become more threatening to Aegislash. Heat Wave provides crucial coverage against Steel-types like Aegislash and Jirachi. It is also Necrozma's best option to damage Dark-types like Zarude and Krookodile. Moonlight allows Necrozma to sustain itself throughout a match, although its limited PP means it should be used conservatively. Colbur Berry allows Necrozma to take Dark-type attacks from Pokemon like Lycanroc-D and Zarude and retaliate with a powerful attack. It also can limit the power of Knock Off from Krookodile, letting Necrozma set up on it. Leftovers is an alternative option that lets Necrozma preserve more longevity as it tries setting up. Even if Necrozma's Colbur Berry gets used up, the given HP and Defense EVs allow it to avoid the 2HKO from Lycanroc-D's Crunch and Zarude's Darkest Lariat. 104 Speed EVs let Necrozma outspeed Swords Dance Aegislash, with the rest put into Special Attack to boost its damage output.</p> <p>This set best fits on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate Necrozma acting as a late-game sweeper. Dark-types like Umbreon, Krookodile, and Galarian Moltres are problematic for this set, so wallbreakers like Mienshao and Azumarill can remove them. They also have the added benefit of removing items with Knock Off and special walls like Chansey for Necrozma. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Krookodile and Nihilego wears down threats like Aegislash and Primarina. Similarly, entry hazard removers like Salamence, Rotom-W, and Tentacruel are great for keeping Necrozma from getting worn down, allowing it to conserve Moonlight PP when absolutely needed. Tentacruel can remove items from threats like Aegislash and Chansey with Knock Off and check Chandelure, while Salamence handles Zarude. Pivots like the previously mentioned Rotom-W and Zarude can bring Necrozma in against Pokemon it can set up on like Amoonguss, Buzzwole, and Kommo-o. Rotom-W can also check Starmie, while Zarude can remove Aegislash. Heal Bell support from Togekiss allows Necrozma to not worry about its setup attempts being hindered by status. Assault Vest Tangrowth and Buzzwole can serve as great defensive pivots for Necrozma, switching in on powerful wallbreakers like Keldeo and Choice Band Krookodile.</p> "

  "Barraskewda": {
    "overview": "<p>Barraskewda's high Speed tier lets it outspeed threats like Nihilego and Keldeo, and alongside its decent Attack stat, gives it a niche as a fast wallbreaker. Under rain, Barraskewda is a powerful wallbreaker, outspeeding the whole tier and wiping out defensive Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, Celesteela, and even Water-resistant foes like Primarina. Its excellent coverage allows it to bypass would-be checks like Amoonguss, Tapu Bulu, Salamence, and Zarude. Barraskewda is also an effective pivot with Heavy-Duty Boots thanks to its high Speed tier and Flip Turn, which help it wear down opposing teams and form a VoltTurn core with Pokemon like Zarude and Rotom-H. However, Barraskewda is very frail and cannot switch into many Pokemon, requiring heavy pivot support or double switches to get in on the field safely. If running a Choice Band, Barraskewda is very prediction reliant and can be taken advantage of by Water-resistant foes such as Tangrowth and Rotom-W, while Heavy-Duty Boots Barraskewda is quite weak and forced out by threats it cannot deal sufficient damage to, like Salamence, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth. Barraskewda also struggles to fit all the moves it wants, meaning it ends up walled by Pokemon such as Tangrowth if it forgoes Poison Jab or Keldeo if it drops Psychic Fangs. Barraskewda faces competition from other Water-type wallbreakers like Keldeo and Starmie, which have much better bulk, less struggles with fitting coverage, and are not reliant on rain or an item to wallbreak.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aqua Jet can be used to pick off a weakened Choice Scarf Krookodile or Lycanroc-D, but Barraskewda already struggles to fit more relevant coverage options like Poison Jab and Close Combat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Seismitoad, Volcanion, and Milotic are problematic for Barraskewda, as the former two's Water immunity and the latter's resistance and high natural bulk allow them to stomach any of Barraskewda's attacks. They can either cripple it with Toxic or deal heavy damage to it. Rotom-W takes any of Barraskewda's attacks and KOes it with Volt Switch, but it cannot switch into Barraskewda under rain.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types with Regenerator like Amoonguss and Tangrowth can take any of Barraskewda's attacks and easily heal it off; they also force Barraskewda to lock into an undersiable move like Ice Fang or Psychic Fangs, which leaves it vulnerable to other threats like Aegislash. However, Amoonguss is 2HKOed by Ice Fang.

Ice Fang nails Dragon-types like Salamence and Noivern and Grass-types like Amoonguss and Zarude. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to gain momentum by pivoting against predicted switch-ins like Tangrowth. The last move slot is dependent on what Barraskewda wants to beat. Poison Jab is able to KO Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Assault Vest Tangrowth more reliably than Ice Fang, although it can only 2HKO the latter with Choice Band. It also has handles Azumarill and Primarina. Psychic Fangs is another option that helps Barraskewda super effectively damage switch-ins like Amoonguss, Kommo-o, and Buzzwole, notably 2HKOing the former two with Choice Band. It also helps Barraskewda check Keldeo, a huge threat to rain teams. Close Combat is Barraskewda's best option to damage Pokemon like Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Rotom-W, which take little from any of Barraskewda's attacks, while also hitting Chansey and Zarude super effectively. Choice Band boosts Barraskewda's wallbreaking power tremendously, letting it 2HKO many walls like Amoonguss, Celesteela, and even Water-resistant foes like Noivern under rain. Choice Band should be primarily used on rain teams to take advantage of rain-boosted Liquidation, while Heavy-Duty Boots is more desirable on VoltTurn teams. An Adamant nature should be used, as Barraskewda naturally outspeeds nearly every Pokemon in the tier. A Jolly nature is an option to outspeed Noivern outside of rain if the team is weak to it, but Noivern isn't too common.</p> <p>Pelipper is a great partner on rain teams, setting rain and wearing down Grass-types like Tangrowth with Hurricane. It also can clear entry hazards with Defog, preventing Barraskewda from being worn down, and bring in Barraskewda safely with U-turn. Other Pokemon found on rain teams like Kingdra, Keldeo, and Seismitoad appreciate Barraskewda muscling through defensive answers like Chansey and Celesteela for them, and they are able to deal with Pokemon such as Salamence, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth in return. Kingdra and Keldeo are also able to help wear down Grass-types like Amoonguss for Barraskewda to KO more easily, while Seismitoad acts as an Electric-type immunity for rain teams and can provide Stealth Rock support to wear down Pokemon like Rotom-W easier. Thundurus-T is another wallbreaker on rain teams that appreciates Barraskewda being able to revenge kill threats like Mienshao and Nihilego and specially defensive walls like Chansey; in return it can dispatch bulky Water-types like Volcanion and Milotic.

Pivots commonly found on VoltTurn teams like Zarude and Rotom-H are great teammates for Heavy-Duty Boots Barraskewda. Zarude can bring Barraskewda in on Fire-types like Moltres and Rotom-H and handle bulky Water-types like Seismitoad and Gastrodon, while Rotom-H is able to remove Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth and also deal with Buzzwole for Barraskewda.</p> "

Thanks to Punk Rock and Boomburst, Toxtricity is able to deal heavy damage to walls like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Rhyperior and maintain pressure on Pokemon that resist its STAB combination, such as Nidoqueen and Seismitoad. In addition, Toxtricity has a relatively decent defensive typing, allowing it to come in on Iron Head from Jirachi and Close Combat from Cobalion and threaten to 2HKO them. It can also pivot into various passive Pokemon such as Togekiss and Amoonguss. Despite Toxtricity's middling Speed, Shift Gear can allow it to outpace foes like Keldeo, Salamence, and even Choice Scarf Krookodile, making it a great late-game cleaner on offensive teams. However, Toxtricity's STAB attacks and Boomburst have immunities, making it a prediction-reliant wallbreaker that struggles to break through cores like Aegislash + Krookodile. Although Toxtricity's base 75 Speed is enough to outspeed the bulkier threats it is able to deal with, its bulk leaves it prey to revenge killers such as Keldeo, Lycanroc-D, and Krookodile. Additionally, priority users such as Crawdaunt, Lycanroc-D, and Mamoswine can all halt a sweep by KOing a chipped Toxtricity.

Sludge Bomb is a viable alternative over Sludge Wave to poison and wear down switch-ins like Rhyperior and Seismitoad. Volt Switch is Toxtricity’s way of generating momentum against threats that Toxtricity cannot break through, like Chansey. Heavy-Duty Boots prevent Toxtricity from being worn down by entry hazards. A Life Orb can be used to increase its firepower but the recoil hinders its longevity.

Toxtricity can compliment these entry hazard setters by threatening to 2HKO entry hazard removers like Tentacruel and Salamence. Additionally, Toxtricity appreciates Pokemon that can threaten to KO and force out specially defensive walls. Keldeo is a prime example of a wallbreaker that excels at dealing with Ground-types and forcing out Chansey thanks to Secret Sword.

However, Polteageist's frail defensive stats means it needs significant team support to truly be a consistent threat; while it's a powerful sweeper, it's still a predictable one due to having only one viable set, unlike other setup sweepers such as Necrozma and Kommo-o. Additionally, Polteageist struggles to break through Dark-types like Zarude and Galarian Moltres. The potential upside of using Polteageist is huge, but its weakness to entry hazards and priority alongside its inability to break through several common metagame threats can easily hamper its success.

It also struggles to beat Steel-types such as Jirachi and Celesteela if it does not catch them with Mystical Fire on the switch. Without a Calm Mind boost, Hatterene noticeably lacks offensive presence, which can be taken advantage of by wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Primarina and Diggersby. While it does have some good matchups against some hazard setters, it also has poor ones, such as against Jirachi and Nidoqueen, so it can require prediction to make the most out of Magic Bounce. Hatterene's dismal Speed tier greatly limits what it can accomplish against offensive teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On Trick Room teams, Hatterene is an effective suicide lead with Focus Sash and Misty Explosion. Magic Bounce denies entry hazards, and using Misty Explosion right after Trick Room gives a safe entry point for teammates such as Crawdaunt with three turns of Trick Room still remaining. Hatterene can also be an offensive threat in Trick Room with Life Orb, but this sacrifices a lot of consistency in defensive utility because of its need for Special Attack investment and Life Orb recoil. Nuzzle is an alternative over Mystical Fire for crippling Jirachi and Aegislash, though Hatterene does miss out on hitting Reuniclus with Special Attack drops. Assault Vest alongside Nuzzle is an option to make Hatterene more bulky without a boost while still crippling the likes of Aegislash and Jirachi, but it faces stiff competition from Reuniclus, which has more consistent healing with Regenerator and better bulk to handle threats such as Keldeo.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Hatterene's poor Speed, lack of consistent recovery, and reliance on a Calm Mind boost to be a consistent threat makes it easy for Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Diggersby, and Crawdaunt to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Jirachi takes little damage from Hatterene's STAB moves and threatens it back with Iron Head, though it dislikes Mystical Fire. Aegislash is an especially detrimental offensive threat, because even if it takes Mystical Fire on the switch a weakened Shadow Ball still threatens substantial damage; the Swords Dance set can take a Mystical Fire and obliterate Hatterene with a STAB move. Celesteela does not take too much damage from Mystical Fire due to its massive special bulk, and it 2HKOes with Heavy Slam.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Hatterene has plenty of opportunities to gain a Calm Mind boost against various entry hazard setters such as Seismitoad and Kommo-o, though it does have to be wary of Poison Jab from the latter. It can also set up against other defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Milotic. Calm Mind notably helps Hatterene stomach hits from strong attackers such as Choice Specs Keldeo better and retaliate with Draining Kiss. Draining Kiss is mandatory as a powerful recovery tool and is instrumental against Chansey; after three boosts, Draining Kiss + Leftovers will outheal Seismic Toss's damage. Psyshock is useful against opposing Calm Mind users, most notably Primarina, as well as a more immediate weapon against Chansey. Psychic is an alternative option because it OHKOes Amoonguss after one Calm Mind boost instead of two. It also helps Hatterene pressure Quagsire better with Special Defense drops, but it comes at the cost of not immediately threatening Chansey. Mystical Fire is vital to deter Steel-types looking to come in on a Calm Mind or STAB move like Celesteela, Jirachi, and Aegislash. Leftovers augments the recovery from Draining Kiss and makes Hatterene harder for Pokemon such as Suicune to wear down. Hatterene needs 12 EVs in Speed to outrun Amoonguss and 56 EVs to outspeed Quagsire and help against stall, though the latter Pokemon is uncommon</p> <p>Hatterene fits well on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its Magic Bounce relieving entry hazard pressure from Kommo-o. Pokemon that handle hazard setters Hatterene cannot switch into well like Nidoqueen, Jirachi, and Nihilego are appreciated. Milotic is able to eat a hit from all of them and retaliate with Scald; it also provides Flip Turn support so Hatterene can come in on threats such as Amoonguss without risking damage. Hazard support from teammates such as Krookodile and Chansey wears down Hatterene checks such as Aegislash and Celesteela. Krookodile is an effective teammate because it's able to offensively check Nidoking and wear down Amoonguss with Knock Off, whereas Chansey is more reliable against Nidoking and non-Rest Galarian Moltres. Fire-types can blow through Steel-types that Hatterene has issues with; Rotom-H and Moltres are notably able to check Aegislash and take advantage of Celesteela. Other pivots such as Rotom-W help Hatterene come in against Pokemon such as Kommo-o. Rotom-W also has Will-O-Wisp to cripple Jirachi and Mamoswine.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Obstagoon is the only Guts user with STAB Facade, allowing it to pressure physical walls such as Amoonguss with ease. Its solid bulk, decent Speed, and access to STAB Knock Off make it a unique offensive threat, being able to take out metagame staples like Rotom-W, Galarian Moltres, and most notably SubToxic Aegislash, who cannot touch Obstagoon due to its typing and status immunity. It also has an excellent matchup against slower bulkier teams because of its status immunity, ability to heal off chip damage with Rest, and high damage output with STAB Knock Off. Due to its poor defensive typing, Obstagoon is easily revenge killed by common threats like Thundurus-T and Lycanroc-D. The abundance of Fighting-types like Buzzwole, Keldeo, and Kommo-o is especially problematic for Obstagoon due to its 4x weakness to fighting moves. Also, it tends to have poorer matchups against hyper offense, as teams pack more faster threats that give Obstagoon few opportunities to wallbreak, although it still can potentially pick up a KO or two. Obstagoon hates Knock Off as it cannot activate Guts without its Flame Orb, severly limiting its threat level. Its overreliance on Sleep Talk isn't ideal, as it relies on RNG to click the correct move. Obstagoon is generally outclassed by other offensive Dark-types like Krookodile and Zarude due to their better defensive utility and less reliance on their item.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bulk Up makes Obstagoon more difficult to revenge kill due to the increase in power and bulk, but its 4x weakness to Fighting still makes getting anywhere with setup difficult in the long term.

Parting Shot allows it to pivot on switch-ins such as Buzzwole.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types Moves: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Mienshao can outspeed Obstagoon and KO it with ease with their STAB moves. Conkeldurr can also KO it with Mach Punch. Faster Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage like Lycanroc-D and Thundurus-T can also threaten it out. All of these Pokemon struggle to pivot into Obstagoon.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Rhyperior, Buzzwole, and Diancie almost completely stonewall Obstagoon, though the former doesn't like Knock Off. Tangrowth can wear down Obstagoon with Rocky Helmet chip, forcing it to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Obstagoon puts itself on a timer as soon as it activates Flame Orb, so it can prematurely faint after a strong neutral hit.

Sleep Talk lets Obstagoon be a potent wallbreaker while asleep thanks to Guts remaining active. Close Combat OHKOs the only Pokemon in the tier that resist Obstagoon's STAB combination, Cobalion, while also letting it hit foes like Krookodile harder. Switcheroo can be used alongside Close Combat to cripple some slower physical attackers like Azumarill, Crawdaunt, and Tapu Bulu.

Rotom-H can bring Obstagoon in safely and pressure Amoonguss, physically defensive Tangrowth, and Celesteela. Noivern can revenge kill threats to Obstagoon like Keldeo and Cobalion. Obstagoon can also fit well on Sticky Web teams with Ribombee and Shuckle to patch up its Speed a bit. It also appreciates entry hazard support from Roserade, Nidoqueen, and Nihilego to get KOs on threats like Azumarill, Mamoswine, and Tangrowth.

The ability to heal status conditions and HP with Jungle Healing can allow Zarude to consistently pivot around defensive Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Aegislash.
