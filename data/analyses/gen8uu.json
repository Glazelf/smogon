  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Venusaur is a phenomenal sun sweeper in the current UU tier. Venusaur's defensive typing lets it set up on many common Pokemon like Tangrowth, Amoonguss without Foul Play, and Rotom-W, allowing it to clean teams with its Growth boots. With moves like Giga Drain for reliable recovery, a powerful 100-Base Power and sun-boosted Weather Ball, and Sludge Bomb or Earth Power, Venusaur is able to punch holes in many teams, as with a boost it 2HKOes nearly every Pokemon in the tier, barring Bulletproof Kommo-o and Chansey. With a Modest nature, it outspeeds every relevant Pokemon in the tier under sun except Choice Scarf Keldeo and +2 Galarian Moltres. However, Venusaur is severely limited if sun is no longer active, being outsped and KOed by plenty of Pokemon like Salamence, Noivern, and Thundurus-T or used as setup bait for Pokemon like Galarian Moltres, Mew, and Celesteela. Without a boost, Venusaur can sometimes be too weak to sweep, as common Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres are able to survive an unboosted hit and OHKO it back. Lastly, priority users such as Scizor and Mamoswine can pick off a weakened Venusaur.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Knock Off can be used to remove Chansey's Eviolite while also nailing Nihilego and Chandelure, but generally Venusaur benefits much more from its other moves; it can OHKO Nihilego and Chandelure with Earth Power, and after enough boosts from Growth it can damage Chansey with Giga Drain and outheal the damage done by Seismic Toss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: If Venusaur chooses to not run Earth Power, Chandelure is able to stomach any of Venusaur's hits at +2 thanks to its typing and take it out with a Fire-type attack. Rotom-H and Moltres are other Pokemon that can take an unboosted Sludge Bomb from Venusaur and KO it back with their Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Kommo-o: Kommo-o resists Giga Drain and is immune to Sludge Bomb and Weather Ball thanks to Bulletproof, so it can switch in and set up Stealth Rock, KO Venusaur outright, or use it as setup fodder if it's an offensive variant.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Special walls such as Chansey and Umbreon can take any of Venusaur's hits and stall out sun turns, with the former using Soft-Boiled and wearing it down with Seismic Toss and the latter being able to keep itself healthy with Wish + Protect and hit Venusaur hard with Foul Play due to Growth's attack boosts. Other specially bulky Pokemon like Incineroar and Nihilego can survive a hit at +2 and KO Venusaur back with super effective or strong moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Scizor, Lycanroc-D, and Mamoswine can revenge kill Venusaur using their priority moves if Venusaur is worn down, which can happen due to Venusaur sometimes having to take a hit to set up Growth while also dealing with Life Orb recoil.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weathers: Venusaur's sweeping capabilities can be halted by weather setters such as Alolan Ninetales and Politoed cancelling Chlorophyll. This forces Venusaur out and Torkoal back in to reactivate sun, which can be taken advantage of by the opponent. Torkoal is also severely weakened by Stealth Rock if it has to come in multiple times during a game, and if it faints, Venusaur becomes dead weight.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Growth is a powerful setup move under sun, boosting Venusaur's Special Attack by 2 stages and allowing it to 2HKO nearly all the Pokemon in the tier. It can set up on popular Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Quagsire, and Tapu Bulu due to its typing, and then sweep through opposing teams. Giga Drain hits Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Primarina, Krookodile, and Rhyperior super effectively. Weather Ball is Venusaur's main attacking move under sun, as its Base Power becomes 100 and is boosted by the sun, KOing Steel-types that resist Giga Drain like Celesteela, Aegislash, and Scizor. Sludge Bomb hits Pokemon that resist Giga Drain and Weather Ball like Salamence and Rotom-H while also hitting Fairy-types like Hatterene and Grimmsnarl super effectively, though it will need a boost to OHKO the former two. Earth Power is an alternative option to hit Bulletproof Kommo-o, which resists or is immune to all of Venusaur's attacks, and has the added benefit of hitting Tentacruel, Chandelure, and Nihilego harder, but this leaves Venusaur susceptible to Salamence, as Giga Drain and Weather Ball are mandatory moves. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed ensures Venusaur is as strong and fast as possible. A Modest nature is typically used to maximize damage output while still nearly outspeeding everything under the sun, but a Timid nature can be used to outspeed +2 Galarian Moltres and Choice Scarf Keldeo if they are troublesome for your team. Life Orb is used to boost Venusaur's damage output, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Salamence, and Nidoqueen after a boost, while a boost to Giga Drain gives Venusaur insane damage output and reliable recovery, making it an unstoppable force.</p> <p>Venusaur only fits on sun teams, so Torkoal is a mandatory partner, as it is the most reliable sun setter in the tier. It provides the team with entry hazard support and entry hazard control with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, respectively. Other Pokemon that take advantage of sun like Chandelure and Charizard break holes in enemy teams thanks to their powerful wallbreaking capabilities amplified by sun, allowing Venusaur to sweep much more easily. Venusaur also appreciates momentum such as Teleport from Chansey to help it get in safely as well as give it more opportunities to set up; for example Chansey can bring Venusaur in on physical attackers like Krookodile and Tapu Bulu, which are forced out by it under sun. Hatterene can be run as a Kommo-o check and discourages entry hazards from being set so Torkoal can come in more, allowing Venusaur to sweep more easily. Lastly, an offensive Kommo-o of your own can help the team deal with Pokemon like Chandelure while also giving it an easier matchup against Chansey.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen is an exceptional wallbreaker and capable entry hazard setter because Life Orb and Sheer Force let it 2HKO the entire UU metagame bar Chansey and bulky Galarian Moltres. Its solid defensive typing also lets it check Pokemon such as Nihilego and discourage common Electric-types such as Rotom-H from using Volt Switch. However, Nidoqueen can struggle to pivot into Electric-types like Raikou and Thundurus-T that commonly carry super-effective coverage to break through it. Unfortunately, Nidoqueen's overreliance on its Life Orb leaves it susceptible to Knock Off, which Nihilego can take advantage of when Nidoqueen attempts to pivot into it. A low Speed stat gives Nidoqueen an undesirable matchup versus faster-paced teams, and although Nidoqueen sports a quality defensive typing, it is still very weak to common Pokemon in the tier such as Mamoswine and Keldeo. These struggles sting a bit more because Nidoqueen has no form of reliable recovery, meaning it is worn down pretty quickly throughout a match.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nidoqueen can run a bulkier set holding Black Sludge, as it can somewhat take advantage of its bulk and defensive typing to better check Buzzwole and Scizor and do a better job setting up entry hazards, but this set struggles because it is somewhat weak. Taunt does a decent job of giving utility Pokemon like Chansey and Mew a hard time. Substitute can be a viable option to ease prediction on a forced switch. Protect also helps prediction by letting Nidoqueen scout Choice-locked Pokemon it is weak to such as Krookodile and Jirachi.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is the single best answer to Nidoqueen, as it can consistently switch into its attacks without worry, recover any damage away, and chip Nidoqueen with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Mew and Starmie all check Nidoqueen. For instance, both Mew and Starmie outspeed and can KO it. Mew also has the natural bulk to take hits from Nidoqueen and potentially weaken it with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: The majority of Water-types in UU can outspeed and OHKO Nidoqueen with ease. For example, Keldeo can outspeed Nidoqueen and OHKO it with Hydro Pump, while Choice Band Crawdaunt OHKOes it with Aqua Jet. Even Tentacruel can force out Nidoqueen if Nidoqueen is worn down enough.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers: Faster, powerful Pokemon such as Lycanroc-D and Krookodile can outspeed and OHKO Nidoqueen, especially if it is worn down enough.

Stealth Rock is the better hazard choice for this set, as it provides excellent utility to just about any team, although Toxic Spikes is an option if the team has another Stealth Rock user. Earth Power and Sludge Wave are mandatory, powerful STAB moves that OHKO bulkier Pokemon such as Hatterene, Tangrowth, and Incineroar. Fire Blast is an excellent coverage move and the best pick for the last slot, as it easily OHKOes Scizor, almost OHKOes Amoonguss, and cleanly 2HKOes Celesteela. Modest is the preferred nature because it grants Nidoqueen exceptional power and still lets it outspeed most of its primary targets, although a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Buzzwole, Timid Volcanion, and Timid Toxtricity. However, a Timid nature will make Nidoqueen noticeably weaker, missing out on benchmarks such as the guaranteed 2HKO on defensive Kommo-o.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu pairs very well with Nidoqueen, as it appreciates Nidoqueen taking care of Amoonguss and Tangrowth and in return can check Water-types like Azumarill, Starmie, and Keldeo. Its Grassy Terrain also provides a bit of recovery to Nidoqueen. Wallbreakers such as Azumarill and Lycanroc-D make good teammates because they also appreciate Nidoqueen's good matchup versus Amoonguss and Tangrowth. In return, they can remove specially defensive walls like Chansey and Galarian Moltres. Starmie is a decent teammate for Nidoqueen because it checks many Pokemon that threaten Nidoqueen, such as Keldeo. Rotom-H and Rotom-W are both Volt Switch users that can bring Nidoqueen in safely and also check Mamoswine, and the latter has the added benefit of checking Krookodile. Nidoqueen pairs well with almost any Kommo-o set, as Nidoqueen can break through Primarina and Hatterene to help it succeed. Kommo-o sets using Stealth Rock also can let Nidoqueen run Toxic Spikes.</p> "

Its great Speed tier allows it to set up Aurora Veil in front of almost all other UU foes, and its access to support moves like Hypnosis allows it to switch out to your sweepers more easily. Sadly, Ice / Fairy is not a great defensive typing, as Alolan Ninetales will drop easily to both offensive and defensive variants of Steel-types like Scizor, Jirachi, and Celesteela, making it difficult to consistently get Aurora Veil up against some teams. Additionally, a lot of common leads can give Alolan Ninetales a hard time, such as Lycanroc-D, and Bullet Punch Scizor and Choice Scarf Jirachi KO it before it can set up Aurora Veil.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Alolan Ninetales has access to Nasty Plot, which can significantly boost its offensive presence while maintaining some bulk investment. This lets it take advantage of its great offensive typing and Speed tier to try to sweep or do heavy damage on its own; however, it cannot break through most Steel- and Fire-types even with multiple Nasty Plot boosts. Encore can give you a safe switch to gain momentum for any of your sweepers. You can also use it to shut down Pokemon that attempt to set up, such as Substitute Primarina and Nasty Plot Galarian Moltres.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Alolan Ninetales is in big trouble against any Steel-type Pokemon, in particular Scizor, which can OHKO it with Bullet Punch, and Choice Scarf Jirachi, which will OHKO it with Iron Head before it can set up Aurora Veil. Slower Steel-types like Celesteela take negligible damage from Freeze-Dry and will OHKO Alolan Ninetales even after it sets up Aurora Veil.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types also resist Freeze-Dry, so Alolan Ninetales cannot do much against them.

Lycanroc-D and Jolly Scolipede are faster and can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Weather Changers: Weather teams, in particular sun teams with Torkoal and rain teams with Politoed, will give Alolan Ninetales a hard time trying to keep Aurora Veil up.

Freeze-Dry is the only offensive move Alolan Ninetales needs, as it hits a substantial number of UU Pokemon such as Salamence, Gyarados, and Amoonguss for super effective damage. Moonblast allows Alolan Ninetales to OHKO Crawdaunt, Buzzwole, and Kommo-o. Hypnosis can be used to put Pokemon to sleep that threaten to remove Aurora Veil with Defog or after Aurora Veil is up to allow you to safely switch in one of your sweepers. You can also use it to cripple foes that threaten to KO Alolan Ninetales, but at 60% accuracy, this is very risky. Hail is an option as well, although it is useful only against opposing weather teams that try to cancel the Snow Warning hail. These teams are not common, and Hail rarely offers any utility otherwise.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales fits exclusively on hyper offense teams, as only these teams can maximize the utility offered from Aurora Veil. Azumarill is typically a great partner, since it can help check Lycanroc-D with Aqua Jet. Azumarill can also use Belly Drum more easily under Aurora Veil and proceed to clean out most of the enemy team, as it no longer has to rely exclusively on Aqua Jet while Aurora Veil is up. Alolan Ninetales struggles against all Steel-type Pokemon, including slower ones like Celesteela, which can OHKO it through Aurora Veil. A partner like Krookodile or Nasty Plot Thundurus-T can help ease the pressure from these foes, the former also being able to support its teammates with Stealth Rock. Other good teammates include offensive Steel-types like Autotomize Celesteela and Swords Dance Aegislash, which can set up very easily under Aurora Veil to begin a sweep. Aegislash especially appreciates this as it can potentially activate a Weakness Policy more easily. Clangorous Soul Kommo-o can also attempt to boost more than once under Aurora Veil. Kommo-o also helps pressure Fire-types like Rotom-H and Volcanion, which would otherwise threaten Alolan Ninetales and remove Aurora Veil with Defog.</p> "

Its resistances let it stomach hits from the likes of Nihilego and Amoonguss, and its Poison STAB allows it to threaten Pokemon such as Primarina and Tangrowth. Galarian Slowbro's decent bulk and Regenerator let it come in multiple times to spam Sludge Bomb or Scald, wearing checks like Jirachi and Gastrodon down through potential poison and burns. It can similarly cripple offensive checks like Krookodile, Zarude, and Keldeo, which it can take a hit from and then switch out. Regenerator lets Galarian Slowbro easily set up even if it's been weakened or forced out early-game, and it's very difficult to take out once it gets going with Calm Mind. Its immunity to Toxic also contributes to its longevity. Being capable of using Colbur or Shuca Berry forces Pokemon like Zarude and Mamoswine to scout for its specific Berry. However, its very low Speed for a sweeper lets Pokemon like Krookodile, Diggersby, and Azumarill revenge kill it. Its special bulk is not good before setting up, leaving it weak to special attackers such as Primarina and Galarian Moltres. Galarian Slowbro can easily become setup fodder for Pokemon like Calm Mind Reuniclus and Suicune. Furthermore, it faces competition with Reuniclus as a Calm Mind sweeper because of its Magic Guard and ability to beat Pokemon like Celesteela more easily. Reuniclus is also not weak to Ground, easing matchups against Pokemon like Gastrodon and Nidoqueen.</p> ",

Slack Off helps Galarian Slowbro pose a constant threat and set up on Pokemon like Celesteela and Mew. Colbur Berry lets it take an attack like Zarude's Darkest Lariat or Scizor's Knock Off and KO back. Shuca Berry does the same against Ground-types like Nidoqueen and Mamoswine.

Earthquake is a coverage option to OHKO Electric-types like Magnezone and Zeraora as well as KO Tentacruel and Jirachi.

Bounce can be used over Ice Fang, as it can more reliably KO a chipped Amoonguss with just one boost and is Gyarados's best means of breaking through Buzzwole. While Bounce can be used without Power Herb on both hyper offensive and balanced teams, not running Power Herb makes Bounce easy to exploit with Protect, Substitute, or switching, and Power Herb can only feasibly be used on hyper offense. Power Whip offers essential coverage against bulky Water-types like Seismitoad and Rotom-W. It also allows Gyarados to break through the Unaware Pokemon Quagsire and Pyukumuku. Moxie is the preferred ability, as it enables Gyarados to snowball through a team after one or two boosts. Intimidate can be used on a more balance-oriented team to set up more freely against physical foes, but it notably lessens Gyarados's sweeping potential. Heavy-Duty Boots is required to prevent Stealth Rock damage, allowing Gyarados to switch in more frequently. On a hyper offense team, Stealth Rock damage is not as big of a concern, so you can use Power Herb to get an immediate hit with Bounce. Lum Berry can also be used to freely set up twice against foes like Amoonguss and Chansey. An Adamant nature can be used for additional wallbreaking power, as it guarantees OHKOing Azumarill with unboosted Power Whip as well as Thundurus with +1 Ice Fang.

Gyarados is primarily used as a late-game cleaner, but it struggles against defensive Pokemon like Chansey and physically defensive Tangrowth. A teammate that offers entry hazard support helps wear these foes down enough for Gyarados to break through them. Mew can set Spikes, while Jirachi can set up Stealth Rock and offers Healing Wish support for Gyarados if needed. Diggersby forces a lot of damage onto Celesteela, Buzzwole, and Chansey, allowing Gyarados to clean these typically bulky threats up more easily. Gyarados will need teammates like Krookodile and Rhyperior to absorb Electric-type attacks. Gyarados is also in danger of being revenge killed by priority users, especially Lycanroc-D, so Rhyperior and Krookodile can help check these foes as well.</p> "

It can also punish physical attackers like Krookodile and U-turn users like Scizor and Zarude due to Flame Body. Its option to run a more defensive Substitute + Toxic set gives it certain versatility too, dealing with conventional checks like Rhyperior, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H way better due to Toxic and PP stalling. However, Moltres's weakness to common offensive typings like Water and Electric hinders it defensively. Its crippling 4x weakness to Rock also leaves it extremely vulnerable to tier staples like Nihilego and Rhyperior, and foes like Krookodile and Zarude can circumvent their vulnerability to Moltres with Rock-type coverage. It also overly relies on its Heavy-Duty Boots and entry hazard removal to not be extremely crippled by Stealth Rock and Knock Off from foes like Scizor and Krookodile, and its Speed tier, while good, falls short of others like Krookodile and Thundurus-T.</p> ",

  "Moltres-Galar": {
    "overview": "<p>Galarian Moltres is both an offensive and defensive threat in UU. Because its fantastic bulk and defensive typing make it exceptionally hard to take down when screens are set up, Galarian Moltres is a staple on screen-based hyper offense teams, taking advantage of great setup moves in Nasty Plot and Agility. Coupled with STAB attacks that provide near-perfect coverage, Galarian Moltres can be remarkably hard to stop after it sets up. Galarian Moltres can also fill a defensive role by using a RestTalk set that is one of the few Pokemon capable of defeating all variations of Aegislash and Psychic-types utilizing the Grassy Seed and Calm Mind combination such as Reuniclus. Such sets can almost singlehandedly defeat stall teams and perform as a great status absorber to the omnipresent Amoonguss and Tangrowth. However, having only base 100 Special Attack can prevent Galarian Moltres from breaking through specially bulky Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Nihilego, even when boosted. Galarian Moltres also requires two turns to set up if a Weakness Policy is not used or activated, which leaves it vulnerable to Taunt and status afflictions. Using RestTalk can make Galarian Moltres too passive when first entering a battle, so the set can be challenging to fit onto teams due to how often it invites wallbreakers such as Azumarill and Kommo-o to come in. Lastly, despite an overall good defensive typing, Galarian Moltres is weak to common priority moves such as Lycanroc-D's Accelerock and Mamoswine's Ice Shard.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt is a passable option on either set, but it has a huge opportunity cost over any of the listed moves. Forgoing a STAB or boosting move for Substitute is an option on the Double Dance set to give Galarian Moltres a better matchup against offensive teams, and it can even function decently alongside Salac Berry or Petaya Berry depending on which boosting move is being used, but overall is less reliable. A pivot set with Heavy-Duty Boots and U-turn can check many Pokemon as well as grab momentum for your team, but it leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Lycanroc-D and Rhyperior pose a huge threat to Galarian Moltres; Lycanroc-D can halt a sweep with priority Accelerock, and Rhyperior can tank a hit and wear Moltres down with Rock Blast or Toxic. Nihilego and Diancie also serve as great checks, as the former can take any boosted attack and retaliate with a Rock-type STAB attack, while the latter flat out counters Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Azumarill and Primarina are capable of OHKOing either Galarian Moltres set. Bulkier variants of Primarina can take boosted Hurricane to boot. Diancie can hit Moltres hard with Diamond Storm and shrug off any attack Galarian Moltres tries to hit it with.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: If Galarian Moltres has Taunt used on it, it will be unable to set up with its offensive set or recover and attack with Sleep Talk on its bulky set. Krookodile and Mew are common Taunt users that can outspeed Galarian Moltres and prevent it from using setup or recovery moves. Most Taunt users can usually only proactively halt Galarian Moltres from making progress, however, as either set can do a lot of damage to them when boosted.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Raikou and Thundurus OHKO or heavily dent Galarian Moltres. This is especially concerning to Galarian Moltres's bulky set, as they are some of the few Pokemon that can reliably outspeed and break through it. Most Electric-types can also switch into unboosted Galarian Moltres, especially the RestTalk set, and force it out. However, when behind screens, significant prior damage is often required for Electric-types to OHKO Galarian Moltres. If they don't OHKO Galarian Moltres, they may simply activate a Weakness Policy and propagate a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Powerful priority moves, with the exception of Sucker Punch, are some of the quickest ways to halt a Galarian Moltres's sweep once screens have faded away. Most notably, Lycanroc-D's Accelerock and Mamoswine's Ice Shard take away well over half of Galarian Moltres's HP outside of screens. Other priority users, such as Choice Band Azumarill and Scizor, take away over a third of Galarian Moltres's HP when screens are no longer in play.</p> ",

After using both Nasty Plot and Agility, Galarian Moltres can OHKO most the metagame and outspeeds the entirety of it. The only attacks needed here are STAB attacks Fiery Wrath and Hurricane, as the only UU-relevant Pokemon they miss out on are the rare Klefki and Diancie. Fiery Wrath's flinch chance also can give Galarian Moltres chances to break through bulkier Pokemon that can tank its attacks such as Chansey. Air Slash is an option over Hurricane if accuracy concerns arise. Weakness Policy is the optimal item for this set, as the most effective way to take down Galarian Moltres behind screens is a super effective attack, meaning it activates a decent amount of the time and gives Galarian Moltres exceptional power when coupled with Nasty Plot. Using Weakness Policy can also create opportunities for Galarian Moltres to set up in one turn by using Agility as a super effective attack hits it. Heavy-Duty Boots is also a viable item choice, as preventing Stealth Rock damage can make it much more challenging for an opponent to take down Galarian Moltres.</p> <p>Double Dance Galarian Moltres fits almost exclusively on screens-based hyper offense teams because its bulk behind screens is crucial to its success. As a result, Grimmsnarl and Alolan Ninetales are virtually essential screen-setting teammates. They have different advantages to them, as the former can almost always guarantee at least one screen thanks to Prankster, while the latter is the quickest Aurora Veil setter in the tier. Stealth Rock setters on hyper offense teams rack up chip damage on Pokemon that check Galarian Moltres such as Diancie. Krookodile is the most notable one, as it provides Stealth Rock, an Electric-type immunity, Intimidate, and a good enough Speed tier to shut down most opposing entry hazard setters with Taunt. Azelf is an alternative that take advantage of its much better Speed tier to set up Stealth Rock and Taunt at the cost of defensive utility. Physical sweepers that fit well on hyper offense teams and can break through or soften up specially bulky Pokemon able to halt a Galarian Moltres sweep—such as Chansey and Nihilego—are appreciated as partners. Belly Drum Azumarill can fill this role; in return, Galarian Moltres has a great matchup against Grass-types that trouble Azumarill.

Access to great coverage moves such as Knock Off and Ice Punch lets Azumarill break past Pokemon like Volcanion and Amoonguss that would otherwise check it by resisting its STAB combination, while access to Aqua Jet allows it to also be a great revenge killer, especially against top threats like Lycanroc-D and Thundurus that have taken chip damage.

Azumarill also struggles to break through defensive foes when it is locked into a STAB move, such as Amoonguss and physically defensive Tangrowth, as they can shrug off Choice Band-boosted STAB attacks, threaten it with Giga Drain, and switch out to regain the lost HP with Regenerator. Belly Drum Azumarill is restricted to only getting one setup opportunity, which usually forces it to be preserved until late-game.</p> ",

Although Azumarill has good natural bulk, it values the support of dual screens setters like Alolan Ninetales and Grimmsnarl, which will help it set up Belly Drum more easily against foes such as Salamence and Keldeo. Araquanid and Shuckle can be used as Sticky Web setters to help make up for Azumarill's bad Speed tier and reliance on Aqua Jet. A teammate that can pivot, such as Cobalion or Scizor, can help Azumarill come in safely to set up a Belly Drum and also chip foes while doing so. Boosted Aqua Jet can still KO Water-resistant foes like Tentacruel after substantial chip damage, so a hazard setter can help chip these Pokemon to allow Azumarill to KO them later on. Krookodile and Kommo-o are good options for this, and the former also provides an Electric immunity. Mew can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes to help wear down foes like Amoonguss and bring them into KO range for Azumarill. Once Azumarill is boosted with Belly Drum, it typically will not get another chance to do so. As such, before it can come in and sweep, it needs teammates to help eliminate its main threats, which are mostly Pokemon that resist Water, are faster, and can KO it. Good offensive teammates include offensive Celesteela and Galarian Moltres to help take out foes like Tapu Bulu and Venusaur. Thundurus-T can also hit most of Azumarill's checks with its coverage options, and it also provides a valuable Electric immunity.</p> "

Access to Aura Sphere and Scald along with its STAB Thunderbolt gives Raikou near-perfect coverage against the entire metagame. This coverage, along with its stats and access to Volt Switch, makes Raikou a solid choice for an offensive pivot. Raikou struggles to deal with defensive staples, however, notably Amoonguss and Chansey. It also lacks a form of reliable recovery, which forces it to function mainly as a revenge killer and makes it overly reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots. Raikou also faces strong competition as a fast Electric-type by Thundurus, which has stronger coverage moves, can use U-turn as a pivoting move to prevent being blocked by Ground-types, and can use Knock Off to cripple Pokemon like Assault Vest Tangrowth that Raikou greatly struggles with, though it does have worse special bulk and a worse Speed tier than Raikou.

Extrasensory can be used to prevent getting walled by Kommo-o and Amoonguss, but it only hits those Pokemon and thus greatly limits Raikou's coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tangrowth only takes neutral damage from Aura Sphere, and can take those well due to commonly running Assault Vest. Amoonguss resists all of Raikou's coverage moves, walling it with ease.

Torkoal serves as a great partner for sun sweepers like Venusaur, Charizard, and Chandelure by providing utility with moves such as the previously mentioned Stealth Rock alongside Yawn, Toxic, and Rapid Spin. However, Torkoal struggles with longevity, as it needs to use Heat Rock over Heavy-Duty Boots to provide more sun turns for its teammates, meaning every time it comes in it risks taking significant chip from entry hazards like Stealth Rock. It also has a lack of recovery, making it vulnerable to common enemy leads like Krookodile. Torkoal is also a momentum sink, meaning that the player will have to either switch directly into their sun sweepers like Venusaur and Chandelure, potentially forcing them to take damage, or sacrifice Torkoal to bring them in safely. Torkoal can solve this by running Yawn to force an opposing Pokemon out to gain momentum. Torkoal is also passive, often requiring status to stop Pokemon like Kommo-o, Primarina, and Galarian Moltres from setting up on it. It is also weak to common Pokemon like Lycanroc-D, Nihilego, and Nidoqueen, meaning Torkoal appreciates defensive support from other Pokemon like Chansey to help it set sun more reliably throughout the game.</p> ",

Explosion can act as a last-ditch option to deal heavy damage to an opposing Pokemon and generate momentum for a teammate; however, it is hard to fit over better utility options, and Torkoal's low Speed and weakness to common attacking types means it can be KOed before using Explosion. Thanks to its low Speed, Torkoal can also be run on Trick Room teams, utilizing a powerful sun-boosted Eruption. However, Torkoal is weak to chip and entry hazard damage caused by switching in too many times if it is running Choice Specs over Heavy-Duty Boots, weakening Eruption as a result. Lastly, when Trick Room is over, Torkoal can be easily used as setup fodder or KOed by an opposing Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users like Krookodile and Mew can prevent Torkoal from punishing setup sweepers like Galarian Moltres and Kommo-o with Toxic or Yawn.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types like Nihilego, Rhyperior, and Lycanroc-D can all hit Torkoal for super effective damage, with the latter two not caring about its sky-high Defense, limiting the ability to set sun in the future due to Torkoal's lack of momentum or reliable recovery.

    "overview": "<p>Rhyperior stands out as an Electric-immune Pokemon and Stealth Rock user, as it is one of the few defensive Ground-types available. It has a stronger offensive presence than Seismitoad and more defensive utility than Nidoqueen and Krookodile with its typing that allows it to switch into Rotom-H, Galarian Slowbro, and Noivern. Its unique Solid Rock ability also allows it to blanket check a good portion of the metagame, stomaching strong super effective hits like Focus Blast from Thundurus and Close Combat from Lycanroc-D. Its STAB moves have reliable coverage for a majority of the metagame, covering Pokemon like Moltres and Galarian Slowbro hard and threatening common entry hazard removers such as Salamence and Rotom-H. However, it remains vulnerable to common Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-types such as Tapu Bulu, Azumarill, and Keldeo, which threaten to KO it with little to no chip. Powerful Ground-type wallbreakers like Nidoqueen and Mamoswine as well as neutral wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Chandelure and Draco Meteor Salamence can muscle past Rhyperior. Regenerator users like Tangrowth and Amoonguss are annoying too, as they can take a majority of Rhyperior's attacks just to heal off with a switch or immediately pressure it with a STAB attack. Rhyperior itself only has Leftovers for passive recovery, leaving it prone to being worn down by entry hazards and wallbreakers like Toxtricity. This means it will not always be able to take strong attacks or answer Pokemon like Salamence or +2 Rotom-H late-game.</p> ",

Rhyperior can run various coverage moves to solidify certain matchups, since its STAB moves already cover most of the tier. Megahorn can improve its matchup against Psychic-types like Reuniculus while OHKOing Zarude. Ice Punch hits Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Amoonguss and hits Kommo-o harder than Earthquake. High Horsepower can be used over Earthquake to avoid being weakened by Grassy Terrain but is only worth the decreased power and accuracy when Tapu Bulu is on the same team. Poison Jab hits Tapu Bulu, Primarina, and Azumarill and prevents them from easily setting up. However, all extra coverage is matchup-dependent and will not be as consistently valuable as Swords Dance or Toxic.

Rhyperior has to be careful of Grass-type coverage from Pokemon like Nihilego as well.</p> <p><strong>Status: Pokemon that Rhyperior frequently pivots against such as defensive Salamence and Rotom-H can wear it down with Toxic and make it hard to deal with them throughout the match.

Its naturally huge Defense also lets it check physical attackers like Zarude and Rhyperior well enough even without investiment. Physically defensive sets can also check threats like Lycanroc-D, Krookodile, and Crawdaunt very well. Access to moves like Knock Off, Sleep Powder, and Sludge Bomb let Tangrowth severely cripple defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Milotic, and Rotom-H. However, Tangrowth's typing can also hinder it, giving it weaknesses to types like Bug and Fire, forcing it to switch out from metagame staples like Scizor and Moltres. Tangrowth faces competition from Amoonguss as a defensive Grass-type, as the latter's Poison typing lets it check threats like Primarina, Keldeo, and opposing Tangrowth more reliably; it can also put foes to sleep more reliably thanks to Spore. However, Tangrowth's huge Defense, generally lower passivity, and ability to cripple walls like Chansey with Knock Off are invaluable. Tangrowth hates being setup fodder for Pokemon like Rotom-H and especially Scizor, which often force it to switch out against them. Its abysmal Special Defense means its physically defensive set struggles against special attackers like Primarina, Thundurus-T, and mixed Kommo-o; this makes specially defensive walls mandatory teammates. Finally, Assault Vest Tangrowth is prone to Knock Off, which defeats its role as a special wall.</p> ",

Other Pokemon like opposing Tangrowth, Hatterene, and Amoonguss are not affected by Leech Seed, making it hard to justify using over Giga Drain's immediate recovery. Stun Spore can be considered to slow down and cripple Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Scizor, and Tentacruel, but its accuracy is shaky and common Pokemon like Rotom-H and Amoonguss are immune to it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: All of the tier's Steel-types can switch directly into Tangrowth. Jirachi can use Tangrowth to set hazards up or heal itself. However, Jirachi and Celesteela fear Knock Off and the former has to scout for Earthquake. Celesteela forces physically defensive Tangrowth out with Flamethrower and Scizor can dent Assault Vest Tangrowth with U-turn. Scizor can also use it as setup fodder, assuming the physically defensive set has already put another team member to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Nidoqueen, Nihilego, Amoonguss, and Tentacruel can hit Tangrowth with their respective STAB moves, and Tentacruel can also damage Tangrowth with Liquid Ooze if ever it uses Giga Drain. Since they force Tangrowth out with offensive pressure, the former two can use it to set Stealth Rock. Amoonguss takes little from Tangrowth's moves and only dislikes Knock Off, forcing Tangrowth to switch out; this gives Amoonguss a free opportunity to put one of Tangrowth's teammate to sleep via Spore.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Tangrowth is extremely pressured by Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure and is almost always forced out.

Physically defensive walls such as Buzzwole and Seismitoad appreciate Tangrowth taking on menacing special threats such as Thundurus, Keldeo, and Primarina. Buzzwole is especially valuable as a Krookodile check, since it doesn't mind losing its item, unlike Tangrowth. Keldeo can threaten Pokemon that scare Tangrowth, like Mamoswine, Moltres, and Rotom-H.

Mach Punch is a strong priority move that can pressure faster foes like Lycanroc-D and Obstagoon while picking off weakened threats in general. Drain Punch can be used as Conkeldurr's primary STAB move, giving it more longevity and a safe attacking option. However, Close Combat is largely preferred for its massive damage output. An Adamant nature is preferred in order to maximize Conkeldurr's wallbreaking potential. A Jolly nature is an option for outspeeding Adamant Azumarill, though it doesn't accomplish much else.</p> <p>Conkeldurr generally fits well on more offensively oriented builds. Some balance teams appreciate the offensive pressure it offers, too. Late-game sweepers like Scizor and Lycanroc-D are able to clean up after Conkeldurr softens up the opposing team. Conkeldurr itself appreciates entry hazard support from setters like Krookodile and Nidoqueen, allowing it to muscle past foes more easily. After Stealth Rock damage, it has a solid chance to OHKO foes like Celesteela and Nidoqueen with Close Combat or Facade. Pivots that can bring Conkeldurr in, like Rotom-W, Jirachi, and Rotom-H, can help circumvent its slightly middling defensive utility. Because Conkeldurr can wear itself down with Flame Orb chip, Wish from Jirachi or Sylveon can also support it well. Tapu Bulu also solves this problem, passively recovering Conkeldurr's health with Grassy Terrain. It can also bypass one of Conkeldurr's most effective checks in Colbur Berry Palossand. Conkeldurr can struggle to work around faster Psychic-types like Starmie and Mew due to their Mach Punch resistance. This makes checks to them, like Krookodile and Celesteela, solid teammates. Flying-types can also be an issue for the same reason, with defensive Salamence proving particularly troublesome for its ability to comfortably switch in from full health thanks to Intimidate. Pokemon capable of pressuring them, like Nihilego and Lycanroc-D, make good teammates as a result. Mamoswine is a particularly useful teammate, pressuring Salamence and other Flying-types as well as supporting Conkeldurr with STAB Ice Shard for fast threats.</p> "

This gives Scolipede a good matchup against both offensive and defensive teams. Its decent STAB combination alongside Earthquake pressures a majority of the tier. Scolipede's typing also provides it with opportunities to set up against foes such as Tangrowth and prevents it from being crippled by Toxic. Unfortunately, Scolipede is very frail, which means it can struggle to set up a Swords Dance safely without being severely worn down. This can severely hinder its ability to clean late-game, especially when it continues to wear itself down from Life Orb recoil. The UU tier also has an abundance of priority users like Lycanroc-D, Azumarill, and Scizor that can easily pick off Scolipede. Albeit having a respectable Attack stat, Scolipede struggles to break through physically defensive walls such as Celesteela, Buzzwole, and Rhyperior even after a Swords Dance boost. Scolipede also has a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits how often it can switch in to find opportunities to set up and sweep.</p> ",

Rock Slide is an option to help break through Rotom-H, Moltres, and Salamence more easily; however, Poison Jab hits these targets hard enough and Earthquake is generally preferred for its ability to pressure Jirachi while still maintaining coverage for other Fire-types like Chandelure. Protect is an option over Earthquake to guarantee a Speed boost, but losing a coverage option greatly hinders its ability to break through a good amount of the tier.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Rhyperior can stomach a boosted hit from Scolipede and OHKO it in return. Buzzwole walls Scolipede after a Swords Dance boost and can easily beat it one-on-one. Celesteela indefinitely walls Scolipede, so unless it is removed, it will have a very hard time making any progress.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Lycanroc-D threatens to OHKO Scolipede with Accelerock, while Scizor can threaten to revenge kill it with Bullet Punch and has the bulk to stomach a boosted hit if needed.

Earthquake gives Scolipede super effective coverage to break through Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Tentacruel, and Aegislash. Aqua Tail can be considered to help break through foes like Rhyperior and Rotom-H better; however, it will have a harder time with foes like Tentacruel and Aegislash. Heavy-Duty Boots are an option over Life Orb to offset its weakness to Stealth Rock; however, you miss out on OHKOing Amoonguss after Stealth Rock with a Swords Dance-boosted Megahorn. Amoonguss could then retaliate with a powerful Foul Play as a result. A Jolly nature allows Scolipede to outspeed threats like Thundurus before a Speed Boost, as well as Choice Scarf users like Zarude after a Speed boost.</p> <p>Scolipede should primarily be used on offense teams that can support it well enough to clean late-game. Entry hazards are key to bring foes like defensive Kommo-o and Rhyperior into range of a boosted attack, so entry hazard setters like Mew and Krookodile are appreciated. Krookodile can also help Scolipede set up a Swords Dance more easily thanks to Intimidate and help blanket check Lycanroc-D if holding a Chople Berry. Grimmsnarl can provide dual screens support to help offset Scolipede's poor bulk, allowing it to set up a Swords Dance more easily. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Rotom-W, Salamence, and Tornadus can help alleviate Scolipede's weakness to Stealth Rock. Rotom-W can also bring Scolipede in against Grass-types like Tangrowth to set up. Salamence and Tornadus do a phenomenal job of wearing down Rhyperior into range of a Swords Dance-boosted Earthquake. Wallbreakers like Azumarill and Aegislash can help break through defensive foes like Buzzwole and Celesteela for Scolipede to sweep more easily. Indeedee or Indeedee-F can provide Psychic Terrain support to prevent Scolipede from being revenge killed by common priority users such as Lycanroc-D and Azumarill.

    "overview": "<p>Krookodile's high Attack, respectable Speed, and amazing offensive typing make it one of the best offensive checks to Pokemon like Aegislash, Mew, and Galarian Slowbro. Few Pokemon resist the combination of Earthquake and Knock Off, which dents even neutral targets such as Primarina, Keldeo, and Amoonguss. Intimidate lets Krookodile switch into resisted and neutral hits such as Lycanroc-D's Stone Edge without getting too worn down. It also helps prevent late-game sweeps from Pokemon like Lycanroc-D and Salamence. Moves like Stealth Rock and Taunt let Krookodile compress utility roles, and its ability to run a plethora of items, like Life Orb, Leftovers, Choice Scarf, Choice Band, and resist Berries, makes for a key factor in its unpredictability and versatility. It's one of the best Choice Scarf users in UU, capable of revenge killing threats like Nihilego and Thundurus. With Choice Band, it can remove common answers to it like Amoonguss more easily. However, Krookodile is threatened by physical attackers like Scizor and Lycanroc-D even after Intimidate, and its special bulk leaves it vulnerable to special attackers like Nidoqueen and Aegislash. Weaknesses to common types like Grass, Water, and Fighting hinder its defensive utility and leave it helpless against common Pokemon like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Tangrowth. Coverage from Electric-types like Raikou's Scald and Thundurus's Focus Blast prevents Krookodile from checking them despite its Electric immunity, and even with coverage like Fire Fang, Buzzwole and physically defensive Tangrowth wall Krookodile. Krookodile also faces competition from Rhyperior as a Stealth Rock setter on bulky offense teams due to the latter's better bulk and similar offensive attributes.</p> ",

Krookodile can opt for a more offensive Choice Scarf set with Moxie, letting it accumulate Attack boosts as it KOes enemies. However, the utility that Intimidate offers is more worth it to weaken Pokemon like Lycanroc-D, and Krookodile can't break past Grass-types and Buzzwole without enough boosts. High Horsepower should be used in place of Earthquake if Tapu Bulu is on Krookodile's team, as Grassy Terrain weakens Earthquake. Choice Band Aerial Ace hits Buzzwole very hard, but that's it. Choice Band Assurance can nail Pokemon like Amoonguss as they switch in, but it requires specific conditions and good prediction</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Amoonguss and Tangrowth check Krookodile very well and are only bothered by Knock Off. Both cause big damage with Giga Drain and incapacitate a team member with Spore or Sleep Powder. However, Amoonguss has to wary of Choice Band Earthquake, as it is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage. Zarude and Tapu Bulu switch into Krookodile's STAB moves and can recover with Jungle Healing or Horn Leech.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Rotom-W and Gyarados are immune to Ground and can take advantage of Krookodile being Choice-locked into Earthquake. The former can remove Stealth Rock with Defog, while the latter can get a free turn of setup. Krookodile also can't take any Water-type hits from Crawdaunt, Azumarill, Primarina, and Keldeo, but they don't like to switch in directly into its moves. Crawdaunt is also easier to switch around, since only one of its STAB types threatens Krookodile.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Buzzwole walls any Krookodile set. It resists both of Krookodile's STAB moves, can tank any hit, has reliable recovery in Roost, and can threaten Krookodile back with its own STAB moves. Kommo-o, Mienshao, Keldeo and Cobalion also threaten Krookodile greatly. The former has enough bulk to take non-Choice Band attacks and KO back, while the latter three outspeed non-Choice Scarf sets, with Choice Scarf Mienshao outspeeding even those. However, Mienshao and Cobalion should scout for Chople Berry and Choice Scarf sets.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Despite its ability and good defensive typing, Krookodile has subpar bulk and lacks reliable recovery, meaning it gets worn down quite quickly and can't switch into Pokemon such as Scizor and Mamoswine.

Stone Edge threatens Pokemon immune to Ground like Gyarados, Moltres, and Rotom-H. Close Combat lets Krookodile hit targets such as Zarude, Chansey, and opposing Krookodile harder. Toxic cripples switch-ins such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth, but since others like Amoonguss and Jungle Healing Zarude are immune or resilient to it, it's quite matchup reliant. Darkest Lariat is useful to hit Pokemon like Rotom-W harder after they've had their items removed and comes in handy against the niche Grassy Seed Galarian Slowbro and Reuniclus. Lash Out serves as a good way to punish Intimidate from opposing Krookodile and Salamence and also punishes Defog from the latter, but it has no use outside of that because Krookodile outspeeds the Rotom-H formes and Moltres, the only other relevant Defoggers. Fire Fang OHKOes Scizor, which is helpful for teams lacking good answers to it like Moltres. Stealth Rock can be used to take advantage of Krookodile's ability to force switches against Pokemon such as Mew and Nihilego, but it should only be used when the role compression is necessary, and it requires very good prediction.

Assault Vest Tangrowth takes on threatening Water-types such as Primarina, Rotom-W, and Keldeo well, and Zarude can pressure said Water-types and bring in Krookodile with U-turn against Pokemon like Moltres. Strong wallbreakers such as Primarina, Chandelure, and Thundurus-T can get past Krookodile's checks such as Buzzwole and Tapu Bulu, allowing it to spam its STAB moves more freely.

Its Poison typing additionally gives it an edge over other common Grass-types, as it is able to threaten Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu with Sludge Bomb, which also prevents them from switching in to absorb Spore. However, despite Amoonguss's good defensive typing, it struggles against metagame staples like Chandelure and Moltres.

Stun Spore can be considered to paralyze threatening switch-ins such as Chandelure after Spore has been used. Toxic is an option over Foul Play to punish Kommo-o, most notably Overcoat variants, which would normally switch into Amoonguss risk-free. However, it means Amoonguss cannot damage Steel-types at all aside from putting them to sleep with Spore. Heavy-Duty Boots can also be run to help it pivot in against Spikes stacking teams, but the chip damage or passive recovery is too valuable. It is also prone to being hit by Knock Off from Pokemon it attempts to check such as Krookodile and Azumarill, limiting the effectiveness of this set. Synthesis allows Amoonguss to recover HP without needing to switch out, so it is forced out less. However, being able to hit foes with Foul Play or a status condition is more valuable because Amoonguss's pivot role means it will switch in and out frequently. Eject Button can be run so Amoonguss can pivot into a foe, take a hit, and bring in a teammate safely. Seed Bomb does more damage to Calm Mind Primarina, particularly Substitute sets that can boost enough to stop Sludge Bomb breaking the Substitute.

Checks to Moltres and Salamence, such as Milotic and Rhyperior, are useful partners that can switch into them and force it out. Dark-types such as Krookodile can offensively check Psychic-types like Galarian Slowbro and Azelf but struggle to switch in. Amoonguss is heavily threatened by Fire-types such as Chandelure and Rotom-H, so checks to these such as Kommo-o and Rhyperior make good partners.

Amoonguss is vulnerable to Stealth Rock and Spikes chip damage, so Defog support from partners such as Salamence enables it to switch in more often and prevents entry hazards from cancelling out its Regenerator recovery.

Superpower can be used on the mixed set alongside a Life Orb to let Thundurus lure in and break through Chansey while retaining coverage for Krookodile. Thunder + Weather Ball is an option on rain teams, allowing Thundurus to break through every Ground-type except Gastrodon and Seismitoad.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Thundurus usually struggles to fit Sludge Wave on its sets, so it has some troubles breaking past Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Thundurus's lackluster defensive stats leave it prone to being 2HKOed by Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech, which recovers any damage. However, Thundurus can consistently wear them down via U-turn or potentially break past them with a Nasty Plot boost.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Priority Users: Starmie and Raikou are faster than Thundurus and can revenge kill it after minimal chip damage. Mamoswine and Lycanroc-D have super effective priority to hit Thundurus with. Other strong priority users like Azumarill and Diggersby can also pick off the frail Thundurus.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Gastrodon and Rhyperior are difficult walls for Thundurus to muscle through. Gastrodon can cripple Thundurus with Toxic, while Rhyperior just threatens to OHKO it. Mamoswine is an offensive check to Thundurus that can revenge kill it with Ice Shard.</p> ",

It also has the necessary coverage to get past every one of its checks, boasting moves like Focus Blast, Sludge Wave, and Psychic. Volt Absorb also allows Thundurus-T to block Volt Switch attempts from Raikou and Thundurus, but it is slower than them and takes a lot of damage from their coverage moves. Despite its amazing Special Attack, Thundurus-T will be walled by at least some of its checks, since it can't fit all of its coverage moves at the same time. It is also frail and slower than Pokemon like Nihilego and Keldeo, making it prone to being revenge killed by them and other faster threats. It also can't take priority moves like Accelerock and Aqua Jet. Thundurus-T's weakness to Stealth Rock almost mandates the use of Heavy-Duty Boots, which limits its wallbreaking capabilities by removing items such as Life Orb and Choice Specs.

However, by giving up one of its coverage moves, it will be forced to switch out against some of its other checks. A pivoting set with Volt Switch / Thunderbolt / Psychic / Focus Blast is an option, but Thundurus-T is generally outclassed in this role by its Incarnate form, which has better Speed.

It also helps to wear down bulky Pokemon that Klefki has trouble checking, such as Rhyperior and Chansey. Thunder Wave slows down opposing Pokemon such as Keldeo and Nihilego, which gives its slower teammates more opportunities to wallbreak. It also provides Klefki with a safety net against Speed-boosting setup sweepers, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Swords Dance + Scale Shot Kommo-o.

Gyarados typically outclasses this set, as it is bulkier, deals more damage, has better coverage, and can snowball with Moxie. Zygarde-10% is fast enough to run a Coil set to bolster its offensive presence and allow it to hit just as hard as Choice Band, but without locking it into one move. This will also raise its Defense to allow it to withstand an extra hit and increase its accuracy to more reliably use moves like Iron Tail. Zygarde-10% will only realistically get an opportunity to set up against something it forces out, and it will still struggle against Tangrowth even after multiple boosts.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tangrowth totally walls Zygarde-10%, which can only use Toxic against it. Tapu Bulu has to be wary of Iron Tail but takes minimal damage from Thousand Arrows, is immune to Outrage, and can OHKO Zygarde-10%. Amoonguss is immune to Toxic and takes little damage from Thousand Arrows, forcing Zygarde-10% to lock itself into Outrage to 2HKO it.

Choice Scarf users like Zarude can also OHKO it with strong STAB attacks like Power Whip. Choice Scarf Krookodile will also do major damage with Earthquake or Knock Off, and it easily withstands a hit after Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Any Pokemon with Ice Shard, most notably Mamoswine and Cloyster, will easily OHKO Zygarde-10%.

    "overview": "<p>Diancie is a reliable Stealth Rock setter for balance and bulky offense teams that also checks many of the strongest offensive threats in UU. Respectable offensive stats and strong mixed coverage in Diamond Storm, Moonblast, and Mystical Fire make it more versatile than other Stealth Rock setters. Diancie's typing and bulk allow it to check threats like Salamence, Galarian Moltres, Thundurus-T, and Kommo-o, although a lack of reliable recovery makes it hard to check multiple threats at once. Diancie doesn't fit as easily onto multiple team compositions as Krookodile and Rhyperior, but it offers unique role compression that makes it the perfect fit for certain teams. Because of its Rock typing, Diancie has a variety of weaknesses that limit the Pokemon it can effectively wall, and its lackluster Speed means it gets heavily damaged by slower wallbreakers like Primarina and Diggersby. While Diancie's mixed coverage is strong enough to punish frailer, more offensive teams, bulky offensive threats like Primarina can switch in without any fear of being 2HKOed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Body Press can be run over Mystical Fire or Heal Bell to take advantage of Diamond Storm's Defense boosts and threaten Pokemon like Chansey, but it's inconsistent and matchup-reliant. Toxic can be an alternative to punish switch-ins like Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu, but it makes Diancie even more vulnerable to Steel-types and limits its versatility.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Diancie's 4x weakness to Steel makes it extremely vulnerable to Steel-type STAB moves from Scizor, Jirachi, Cobalion, Celesteela, and Aegislash. Scizor, Aegislash, and Cobalion are especially problematic, as they can set up with Swords Dance and threaten the rest of the team.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Keldeo and Primarina can both easily OHKO Diancie with Hydro Pump, and Primarina especially can switch into any of Diancie's moves without taking too much damage and heal it off with Rest. Defensive Water-types like Seismitoad and Milotic can sponge Diancie's attacks and force it out with their own.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Assault Vest Tangrowth and Amoonguss take only moderate damage from Diancie's attacks and are able to heal it off. Zarude can't easily switch in, but it beats Diancie one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards, Status, and Knock Off: Diancie is vulnerable to all entry hazards, and its lack of reliable recovery neuters its ability to effectively check offensive threats in the long run. Its only form of recovery is Leftovers, so Knock Off limits the number of times it can switch in throughout the game.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Diamond Storm hits most of the tier neutrally and offers a 50% chance for a +2 Defense boost, allowing Diancie to stay in and threaten Scizor with Mystical Fire or trade with Zarude or Krookodile. It also allows Diancie to pressure Pokemon like Thundurus-T, Chandelure, Moltres, and Galarian Moltres, but make sure to be careful of its low PP. Moonblast deals with threats like Kommo-o, Krookodile, and Buzzwole. Mystical Fire allows Diancie to OHKO offensive Scizor variants and heavily damage bulkier ones, which prevents it from being setup bait. It also deals respectable damage to Pokemon like Aegislash and Jirachi that otherwise wall Diancie. Also, the guaranteed Special Attack drop makes pivoting around threats like bulky Primarina and Nidoqueen much easier. Alternatively, Heal Bell gives Diancie utility as a cleric and allows it to extend its own and its teammates' longevity, further improving its excellent matchup against Defoggers like Rotom-H and Salamence. 32 Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO on Thundurus-T, and 96 Defense EVs ensure that Diancie isn't 2HKOed by Life Orb Kommo-o's Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage. A Sassy nature boosts Diancie's Special Defense without decreasing its mixed damage output.</p> <p>Diancie works best on balance and bulky offense structures, as it pairs well with defensive cores that can patch up its many weaknesses. In return, it offers a crucial check to wallbreakers like Galarian Moltres that could typically dismantle defensive cores. Moltres is a phenomenal partner, offering a Ground-type immunity and a resistance to Grass- and Steel-type moves—additionally, Moltres's Flame Body can cripple threats like Zarude and Scizor as they pivot with U-turn and allow Diancie to stay in against them in the future. Similarly, Rocky Helmet Buzzwole pairs well with Diancie, as it punishes physical threats that try and use Diancie as momentum and covers several of its type weaknesses. Diancie pairs well with bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss, as they account for its weaknesses to Water- and Ground-type moves like Keldeo's Surf and Krookodile's Earthquake. Diancie appreciates entry hazard removal; Tentacruel makes a great partner due to its ability to check Primarina and Keldeo and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Starmie can also provide Rapid Spin support and ease the matchup against Spikes Mew. Defog users like Salamence and Rotom-W can work well too. Diancie works well with offensive Pokemon like Swords Dance Scizor, Zarude, and Buzzwole, which appreciate its ability to switch into Moltres and defensive Salamence and remove status with Heal Bell.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Incineroar is a decent defensive pivot in the UU metagame because its typing, Intimidate, and overall solid bulk allow it to check multiple Pokemon such as Victini, Chandelure, and Jirachi. Its support options in Knock Off, Will-O-Wisp, and Toxic can provide a lot of utility for teams and cripple other Pokemon. Knock Off combined with Parting Shot or U-turn prevents Incineroar from being too passive, as it can dish out respectable damage and keep up momentum. Incineroar's good matchup against other bulky pivots in the tier, such as Amoonguss, Slowking, and Tangrowth, creates many opportunities to generate momentum and remove items. Although Incineroar is a good defensive Pokemon, it is extremely vulnerable to many common top-tier Pokemon, such as Nidoqueen and Keldeo. It ironically struggles to check Alakazam as a Dark-type due to the risk of Focus Blast and Scizor as a Fire-type due to easy U-turn chip and Superpower. Incineroar's lack of recovery mean it can get worn down very quickly and is very vulnerable to Toxic. An overreliance on Heavy-Duty Boots makes Incineroar susceptible to the incredibly common Knock Off as well. Incineroar's low Speed in a relatively fast metagame means it oftentimes gets hit before it can make any progress, which wears it down further.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Swords Dance set with Heavy-Duty Boots, Knock Off, Close Combat, and Flame Charge is an option on fast-paced and hyper offense teams. However, this set requires two turns to properly set up, and it is still shut down by many common Pokemon such as Azumarill, Kommo-o, and Primarina. A similar set using Bulk Up, Flame Charge, and Power Trip holding Weakness Policy can be used on hyper offense teams, but it requires many boosts to do significant damage and therefore can be an unreliable choice. Taunt is an option on the listed set to prevent Pokemon from setting up, using status moves on Incineroar, or getting entry hazards into play, but the other listed moves are far more useful the majority of the time. RestTalk is an option to patch up Incineroar's lack of recovery, but a RestTalk set can be somewhat passive and does less for a team without Incineroar's usual utility options. Using a faster spread on the listed set with 216 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allows Incineroar to outspeed all of Scizor's standard spreads, turning it into an actual Scizor check, and use a faster Parting Shot on Azumarill and Modest Primarina; this spread, however, is much less effective defensively and gets 3HKOed rather than 4HKOed by Choice Specs Chandelure. Swords Dance sets that utilize U-turn can make for usable offensive pivots but are outclassed by Scizor.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Keldeo can potentially OHKO Incineroar with their STAB attacks. Kommo-o can heavily dent Incineroar with Close Combat or Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: UU's premier wallbreaker Ground-types, Mamoswine and Nidoqueen, can take away a lot of Incineroar's HP or OHKO it with STAB attacks. Rhyperior can also 2HKO Incineroar with Earthquake or High Horsepower.</p> <p><strong>Toxic: Incineroar lacks any type of recovery and can be easily worn down after having Toxic used on it, making it a less effective defensive pivot.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Azumarill, Primarina, Keldeo, and Volcanion can potentially OHKO Incineroar. Primarina especially can use Incineroar as setup fodder with Substitute sets.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: While Rock-types are overall rare in UU, Lycanroc-D, Nihilego, and Rhyperior do a lot of damage to Incineroar, although the latter does fear Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal: While any Pokemon dislikes losing its item, Incineroar is especially impacted by losing its Heavy-Duty Boots as a pivot weak to Stealth Rock. Incineroar's reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots makes it wary of switching into Pokemon with Knock Off it should otherwise be able to check such as Scizor and Tangrowth. Trick users can also remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Incineroar, which can give Jirachi, another Pokemon Incineroar should be able to check, some leverage.</p> ",

It also punishes bulkier pivots Incineroar pressures, such as Slowking and Tangrowth, for switching out. Overheat is a decently strong STAB attack that cleanly OHKOes Scizor and Bisharp, always OHKOes Skarmory and physically defensive Tangrowth after Stealth Rock damage, and does a great deal of damage to Amoonguss. Flare Blitz can be used instead for more damage to Celesteela, but the recoil damage worsens Incineroar's weakness to being worn down; Flare Blitz also does less damage to Skarmory and Tangrowth. Will-O-Wisp is the preferred status move because it cripples physical attackers such as Azumarill and Kommo-o. Toxic can more quickly wear down bulkier Pokemon such as Rhyperior and make more progress against special attackers such as Primarina and Keldeo. Parting Shot can create setup opportunities for teammates such as Scizor. U-turn has the benefit of chipping switch-ins that don't have reliable recovery such as Primarina. The EVs maximize special bulk while outspeeding Celesteela. Intimidate allows Incineroar to take physical attacks better and makes up for the lack of EV investment in Defense. Heavy-Duty Boots is crucial due to Incineroar's vulnerability to Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Incineroar fits best on balance and bulky offense teams. Grass-types Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu have great defensive synergy with Incineroar, checking Pokemon that threaten it such as Azumarill, Keldeo, Primarina, and Rhyperior. Amoonguss also sponges Knock Off from Pokemon such as Krookodile and Tangrowth—which Incineroar checks, but can't pivot into due to the risk of losing its Heavy-Duty Boots—and Tapu Bulu can set Grassy Terrain, which marginally helps Incineroar's lack of recovery. Incineroar returns the favor to both by checking Chandelure, Victini, and, in Tapu Bulu's case, Jirachi. Zeraora forms a VoltTurn core with Incineroar and pressures Water-types such as Azumarill, Keldeo, and Primarina while also being able to pick off weakened Incineroar checks such as Kommo-o. Zeraora also can lure in Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth for Incineroar. Jirachi forms a pivoting core with Incineroar and can use Wish to aid with Incineroar's lack of reliable recovery. Slowking forms a pivoting core with Incineroar through Teleport, has generally good defensive synergy with Incineroar, and checks many Pokemon that threaten Incineroar such as Kommo-o, Nihilego, and Nidoqueen. Slower wallbreakers, such as Crawdaunt and Nidoqueen, appreciate Incineroar getting them into the match safely. Skarmory can check Scizor decently for Incineroar; Incineroar returns the favor by checking Chandelure and Victini while also pressuring and using Knock Off against users of Heavy-Duty Boots, such as Slowking, to make Skarmory's entry hazards more effective.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Few Pokemon resist Primarina's STAB combination of Water and Fairy, making it a massive threat capable of threatening defensive Pokemon such as Jirachi, Celesteela, and Kommo-o. Its typing also shines defensively, allowing it to face Pokemon such as Keldeo and Kommo-o. Psychic covers the only answers to its STAB combination in Amoonguss and Tentacruel, and Calm Mind allows it to more easily get past common checks such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Unfortunately, Primarina has very low Speed, often forcing it to take a hit from Pokemon it's supposed to answer, such as Keldeo, before KOing them back. Its similarly low Defense stat makes it 2HKOed by even resisted hits such as Choice Specs Keldeo's Secret Sword after Stealth Rock damage and Crawdaunt's Crabhammer, so it can't check them well despite having the type advantage. Primarina faces some competition from Azumarill as a Water- and Fairy-type wallbreaker, as Azumarill acts a physical wallbreaker, can pressure walls with Knock Off, and has priority in Aqua Jet to make up for the lack of Speed, letting it check Pokemon like Nihilego and Lycanroc-D a lot more comfortably.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A RestTalk set with Moonblast and either Scald or Calm Mind as the last move and a spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA gives Primarina more bulk to deal with physical attackers like Lycanroc-D, but it is generally worse because Primarina doesn't have a usable Defense stat to begin with. Even with maximum Defense investment, Primarina is still 2HKOed by Pokemon like Mamoswine and Azumarill. Sparkling Aria is stronger than Scald and bypasses Substitute, but Scald's burn chance is a big help against checks like Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and Tapu Bulu.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Primarina's best counter is Chansey, as it can stomach even a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump with ease. Chansey also easily beats Substitute Primarina, as it can break the Substitute with Seismic Toss and scare Primarina away with Toxic. Primarina gives Chansey free turns to set up Stealth Rock, heal itself with Soft-Boiled, and bring in teammates with Teleport. Chansey does have to be wary of Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump, though, as it 2HKOes after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth can cripple Primarina with Giga Drain, Sludge Bomb, and their sleep-inducing moves. Both can take on Primarina's STAB moves, but they have to scout for Choice Specs sets, as Psychic 2HKOes Amoonguss, while Moonblast 2HKOes Assault Vest Tangrowth after Stealth Rock damage. Tapu Bulu outspeeds Primarina and can OHKO it with Horn Leech, but it doesn't like switching directly into Moonblast or risking Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Rotom-W can pivot into Primarina's Water-type moves and threaten it with Volt Switch in order to bring in a teammate like Tangrowth, but it is scared of Moonblast. Tentacruel eats any hit Primarina throws at it except Psychic. It also outspeeds Primarina and can pressure it with Sludge Bomb and Knock Off. Volcanion is only bothered by Psychic and can 2HKO Primarina with Sludge Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Physical Attackers: Faster physical attackers such as Mamoswine, Lycanroc-D and Zarude threaten Primarina with their powerful STAB moves.

A Modest nature lets Primarina 2HKO Pokemon like Celesteela with Hydro Pump.</p> <p>This set aims to punch holes through the raw power of Primarina's Choice Specs-boosted moves. Tapu Bulu and Scizor appreciate Primarina's ability to power through their checks in Celesteela and Jirachi. In return, Swords Dance Tapu Bulu removes Amoonguss with +2 Zen Headbutt, while Knock Off Scizor removes Tentacruel's Black Sludge and Volcanion's Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off, making it so Primarina can pressure them more easily. Scizor can also bring in Primarina safely with U-turn in front of Pokemon like Salamence and Celesteela, making up for its low Speed. Chandelure beats Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth, and some variants pressure Chansey for Primarina. Thundurus hits Water-types such as Tentacruel and Volcanion, can bring it in safely with U-turn, and potentially remove key items like Assault Vest from Tangrowth and Eviolite from Chansey. Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Krookodile handle Electric-types like Thundurus-T and set Stealth Rock up to help Primarina wallbreak. Amoonguss and Tangrowth deal with Tapu Bulu for Primarina. Chansey walls Primarina effortlessly, so Fighting-types such as Buzzwole and Kommo-o can be used to threaten it. Primarina can be easily worn down by entry hazards, so a Wish passer like Jirachi can help it stay in the match for longer.

Common checks like Amoonguss can't deal with Primarina if it uses Substitute as they come in, as Primarina is faster and can set up with Calm Mind. Substitute also eases prediction when forcing switches from Pokemon like Salamence and Kommo-o. Draining Kiss aids Primarina in recovering HP, allowing it to take more hits and use Substitute if needed. However, Draining Kiss is a very weak move and will only pose a threat to many Pokemon if Primarina has accumulated enough boosts. Moonblast, on the other hand, is very powerful from the start and lets Primarina not rely too much on Calm Mind boosts to threaten Water-resistant Pokemon like Tangrowth and Rotom-W. Moonblast especially helps Primarina against Rocky Helmet Tangrowth, which damages Draining Kiss Primarina. Scald is a reliable Water-type move, capable of burning physical attackers like Scizor and easing Primarina's matchup against them. It also helps to whittle down defensive Pokemon trying to check it, like Tentacruel, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Leftovers compensates the 25% loss in HP from Substitute. With the given EV spread Primarina is able to beat Amoonguss one-on-one, as it ensures Amoonguss can't break Primarina's Substitute after a Calm Mind. A faster spread with 136 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Conkeldurr but it will require two Calm Mind's for Amoonguss to not break its Substitute, leading to Spore mindgames.</p> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind Primarina fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, as its ability to come in on moves like Draco Meteor from Salamence is greatly appreciated by other teammates. By switching on these moves, Primarina can either get a Substitute up or set up with Calm Mind if its checks have been eliminated or weakened. Poison-types like Nihilego and Nidoqueen help Primarina by absorbing annoying Toxic Spikes and setting up their own or Stealth Rock. Tentacruel is especially helpful, as it can spin away other hazards that bother Primarina. Strong wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Nidoqueen, and Aegislash can get past bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Electric-types such as Raikou and Thundurus force Primarina out of the field if it doesn't have a Substitute up, so Pokemon like Rhyperior and Seismitoad take care of them. They can also set Stealth Rock to aid Primarina in its sweep. Tangrowth and Buzzwole can take on strong physical attackers such as Diggersby and Mamoswine for Primarina. Chansey is extremely annoying, as it can take boosted hits with ease and threaten Primarina back with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Conkeldurr, Buzzwole, and Swords Dance Diggersby are powerful wallbreakers that can muscle through Chansey and remove it for Primarina.</p> "

Rest allows it to not be ruined by status such as Toxic from Aegislash and Buzzwole, Thunder Wave from Chansey, and Will-O-Wisp from Mew. Moonblast is great neutral coverage while also proving super effective damage on Kommo-o and Galarian Moltres. Scald allows Primarina to get a burn on switch-ins like Amoonguss, Celesteela, and Tentacruel, negating the recovery from Leftovers and Black Sludge. 124 Special Defense EVs and Leftovers allow Primarina avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Chandelure's Shadow Ball and 3HKO from Salamence's Hurricane from full HP without Stealth Rock, with the rest put into Defense to not be 3HKOed by Buzzwole's Close Combat, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Keldeo's Secret Sword, while also better checking mixed Kommo-o carrying Poison Jab. Leftovers is great, as it synergizes well with Rest + Sleep Talk, but Heavy-Duty Boots is an option to negate damage from entry hazards if the team has unreliable or no hazard removal.</p> <p>RestTalk Primarina is mainly used on bulky teams that appreciate a status sponge and value the defensive qualities its typing provides. Mew is an excellent partner, as it can threaten Amoonguss and Tentacruel, that would otherwise counter Primarina. It can also provide Spikes support to help Primarina punish its switch-ins such as Nihilego. Zarude checks Rotom-W and Chansey while appreciating Primarina checking Keldeo and Kommo-o. Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Moltres can help check Grass-types such as Zarude and Assault Vest Tangrowth, and provide momentum with Volt Switch and U-turn. Chandelure is a powerful wallbreaker that can OHKO Assault Vest Tangrowth, but it has to be very careful of taking big damage from Knock Off and losing its Choice Specs or Heavy-Duty Boots. Hazard control is important for Primarina to not be chipped down easily and forced to use Rest if it is running Leftovers. Salamence removes entry hazards with Defog and checks Zarude well. Kommo-o, Rhyperior, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can all form solid defensive cores with Primarina, as they are able to check Pokemon such as Volcanion, Thundurus, and Rotom-W nicely, while Primarina checks Noivern, Keldeo and Moltres in return.</p> "

The first two can set Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes to help Primarina break through the opposing team, while Tentacruel can remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, which is especially helpful if Leftovers is chosen in place of Heavy-Duty Boots. If running Leftovers, Salamence makes a great teammate and Defogger, acting as a check to Pokemon like Scizor. Due to Primarina's bad Defense and Speed, it appreciates pivots like Scizor, Jirachi, and Moltres. Jirachi and Scizor bring Primarina in against Pokemon like Salamence and Kommo-o so it can attack or set up. Strong wallbreakers like Crawdaunt, Mamoswine, and Swords Dance Scizor help Primarina by breaking through Chansey and Mantine, which easily wall it.

It also makes Lycanroc-D more difficult to revenge kill with faster threats such as Venusaur in sun and Starmie. Stone Edge is a very spammable STAB move that can OHKO Rotom-H and offensive Salamence. Alternatively, Crunch is an option to hit Aegislash, Jirachi, and Galarian Slowbro harder. Sucker Punch can be used to deal more damage than Accelerock against neutral targets; however, it is only really useful for a better matchup against Choice Scarf Jirachi. Psychic Fangs inflicts heavy damage on the likes of Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and offensive Buzzwole. A Life Orb is used to guarantee feats such as OHKOing offensive Nidoqueen with Psychic Fangs and 2HKOing defensive Celesteela with Close Combat on the switch with Stealth Rock up. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is needed to make Lycanroc-D outspeed and threaten as many foes as it can, particularly Keldeo.</p> <p>Lycanroc-D fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to revenge kill common offensive threats such as Galarian Moltres without sacrificing its teammates' wallbreaking capabilities. As Lycanroc-D is unable to switch in on mostly anything, pivots are appreciated to give it opportunities to punch holes as often as possible and gain momentum; Scizor and Rotom-H are efficient at this and help pressure bulky Grass-types, which usually give Lycanroc-D grief. Choice Band variants of Scizor can also lure and remove Buzzwole for Lycanroc-D. Entry hazards allow Lycanroc-D to leave greater dents in otherwise solid answers such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth, although residual damage from its foes' Rocky Helmet and its own Life Orb will noticeably sting. Krookodile is a great Stealth Rock setter that draws out Tangrowth and Amoonguss to remove their Rocky Helmets with Knock Off, and it appreciates Lycanroc-D being a good offensive check to Galarian Moltres. Special attackers such as Moltres and Primarina appreciate Lycanroc-D's ability to break through Chansey, and in return they can help wear down common physically defensive threats such as Buzzwole for it. The Grass-types of the tier like Tangrowth and Zarude are excellent partners to handle threats such as Azumarill. Additionally, they also check faster Pokemon Lycanroc-D cannot threaten as much with its priority, such as Raikou and Zygarde-10%.</p> "

Fire Fang is an option that maintains coverage for Amoonguss and Aegislash while also hitting Buzzwole. After a Swords Dance boost, Close Combat can OHKO Celesteela and KO Tangrowth after some chip damage.

Swords Dance Lycanroc-D can fit on both dual screens and Spikes lead hyper offense teams; dual screens support from Grimmsnarl and Alolan Ninetales lets Lycanroc-D set up more easily, whereas Spikes support from Mew and Scolipede can leave Tangrowth unable to safely handle its +2 Close Combats. Other entry hazard setters such as Jirachi and Krookodile can chip Lycanroc-D's checks with passive damage to put its checks, such as Seismitoad, in range of its boosted attacks.

Meteor Beam boosting Special Attack while dealing heavy damage further heightens Nihilego's sweeping prowess and lets it muscle through worn down checks like Celesteela. Its unique Speed tier puts it ahead of Salamence, Thundurus-T, and Moltres, and after a Speed boost from Beast Boost, it only falls behind Choice Scarf Zarude and Choice Scarf Mienshao. It has important resistances like Flying, Fairy, and Fire; its Flying resistance and high Special Defense in particular are appreciated by teams that struggle with Flying-types like Thundurus-T and Galarian Moltres. Relatedly, Nihilego can be an amazing Stealth Rock setter, as its resistances give very good matchups against Defoggers such as Salamence, Moltres, and Rotom-H. Its Knock Off is useful for common switch-ins like Rhyperior, Aegislash, and Celesteela. However, its weaknesses and horrid Defense stat leave it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Jirachi, and Keldeo, and priority from the likes of Scizor, Azumarill, and Crawdaunt easily shuts down its sweeps.

A Choice Scarf set with Power Gem / Sludge Wave / Thunderbolt / Grass Knot lets Nihilego clean and revenge kill Pokemon like Keldeo, and other Choice Scarf users like Krookodile, but Choice-locked Nihilego is vulnerable to Pokemon like Aegislash, Crawdaunt, and Scizor. Pain Split can be considered as a form of recovery on the utility set, but it is very unreliable due to Nihilego's high HP and can only be used against special attackers that can't hurt it much. Dazzling Gleam OHKOes Kommo-o and maintains coverage for Krookodile but has no use outside of that. Psychic hits Kommo-o, opposing Nihilego, and Nidoqueen, but just like Dazzling Gleam, it is not worth running most times. A Passho Berry lets Nihilego pivot into Choice Specs Primarina and Kingdra under rain once but has no use outside of that.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is Nihilego's best answer, capable of wearing it down with Seismic Toss and healing itself with Soft-Boiled.

Scizor and Jirachi can also bring Nihilego in safely against them with U-turn. Aegislash has notable defensive synergy with Nihilego, as it checks Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, Lycanroc-D, and Kommo-o. Moltres and Rotom-H deal with Steel-types that wall Nihilego, like Aegislash and Jirachi. It in return can remove Rhyperior and Seismitoad with Grass Knot.

Shell Smash and powerful coverage options like Giga Drain and Stored Power make it a threatening setup sweeper that can easily OHKO much of the tier. However, Polteageist's frail defensive stats means it needs significant team support to truly be a consistent threat; while it's a powerful sweeper, it's still a predictable one due to having only one viable set, unlike other setup sweepers such as Necrozma, Mew, and Kommo-o. Additionally, Polteageist struggles to break through Dark-types like Zarude, Grimmsnarl, and Galarian Moltres. The potential upside of using Polteageist is huge, but its weakness to entry hazards and priority alongside its inability to break through several common metagame threats can easily hamper its success. Polteageist works best with Psychic Terrain support to neutralize its weakness to priority, and while it can succeed with dual screens support, there are several other setup sweepers that require less support and are easier to justify.</p> ",

Hyper Beam can be run as a nuke to nearly always OHKO Zarude while retaining the ability to OHKO Krookodile, but it's situational and leaves Polteageist open to being set up on.

Hatterene's STAB moves complement each other brilliantly and, alongside Mystical Fire, give it good matchups against entry hazard setters such as Mew and Seismitoad to block their hazards with Magic Bounce and keep pressure off of its teammates. Hatterene's typing, while offensively potent, makes it a Fairy-type that's hit neutrally by Knock Off and a Psychic-type weak to Poison. This greatly impedes Hatterene's ability to consistently handle Pokemon such as Galarian Moltres and Krookodile and makes it unreliable at pressuring Tentacruel and Nihilego. It also struggles to beat Steel-types such as Jirachi and Scizor if it does not catch them with Mystical Fire on the switch.

Hatterene can also be an offensive threat in Trick Room with Life Orb, but this sacrifices a lot of consistency in defensive utility because of its need for Special Attack investment and Life Orb recoil. Nuzzle is an alternative over Mystical Fire for crippling Jirachi and Aegislash, though Hatterene does miss out on coverage against Scizor, as well as hitting Reuniclus with Special Attack drops. Assault Vest alongside Nuzzle is an option to make Hatterene more bulky without a boost while still crippling the likes of Aegislash and Jirachi, but it faces stiff competition from Reuniclus, which has more consistent healing with Regenerator and better bulk to handle threats such as Keldeo.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Hatterene's poor Speed, lack of consistent recovery, and reliance on a Calm Mind boost to be a consistent threat makes it easy for Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Crawdaunt to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Rotom-H resists Draining Kiss and can boost with Nasty Plot as Hatterene uses Calm Mind.

Calm Mind notably helps Hatterene stomach hits from strong attackers such as Choice Specs Keldeo better and retaliate with Draining Kiss. Draining Kiss is mandatory as a powerful recovery tool and is instrumental against Chansey; after three boosts, Draining Kiss + Leftovers will outheal Seismic Toss's damage. Psyshock is useful against opposing Calm Mind users, most notably Reuniclus and Primarina, as well as a more immediate weapon against Chansey.

Mystical Fire is vital to deter Steel-types looking to come in on a Calm Mind or STAB move like Celesteela, Jirachi, and especially Scizor. Leftovers augments the recovery from Draining Kiss and makes Hatterene harder for Pokemon such as Suicune to wear down.

Its Speed enables it to outspeed common Pokemon such as Nihilego and Thundurus-T, and its good bulk and defensive typing let it check many dangerous threats such as Crawdaunt and Krookodile. The ability to heal status conditions and HP with Jungle Healing can allow Zarude to consistently pivot around defensive Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Mew. However, it often struggles to break defensive Pokemon, such as Celesteela, Buzzwole, and Salamence, due to them resisting Power Whip and taking minimal damage from Darkest Lariat. Zarude also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, potentially having to give up an important coverage move or the ability to heal off status conditions. Also, many teams run many Pokemon with a Grass-type resistance such as Scizor, Tangrowth, and Moltres, leaving Zarude with limited opportunities to click its strongest STAB attack. If it is running Choice Scarf, Zarude can risk being locked into an undesirable move, losing momentum. Flame Body from Moltres and Rocky Helmet from Amoonguss and Tangrowth can punish U-turn, forcing momentum to be sacrificed to use Jungle Healing.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Band allows Zarude to function as a powerful wallbreaker. However, the lack of Speed from Choice Scarf and increased prediction-reliance are problematic, and it still struggles to break through Buzzwole, Kommo-o, and Salamence. A Bulk Up set with Jungle Healing, Power Whip, and Darkest Lariat allows Zarude to deal heavy damage and potentially tank super effective hits. However, it has no room for any coverage moves, so it is still not capable of breaking through checks like Tangrowth and Buzzwole. Psychic Seed alongside Bulk Up + Synthesis on Psychic Terrain teams allows it to be a fantastic Krookodile counter, greatly benefiting its teammates by allowing them to spam their Psychic-type moves more easily. Zarude can also become a better setup sweeper by taking hits from Salamence and Tangrowth more easily. Taunt is an option that can completely shut down Chansey's recovery and prevent Roost from Salamence, but Zarude would have to give up Jungle Healing or valuable coverage. Encore on Choice Scarf sets can be used to punish setup sweepers such as Galarian Moltres and Dragon Dance Salamence so that a teammate such as Mamoswine can safely switch in and threaten them. However, it is very situational, and Zarude is forced to switch afterwards.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fast U-turn Users: Faster Pokemon such as Noivern and Choice Scarf Mienshao are able to put Zarude in a tough spot. It either has to take heavy damage from U-turn, or switch out, meaning that Noivern and Mienshao can pivot freely.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth take little damage from Zarude's STAB attacks, while Tapu Bulu resists both. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can threaten Zarude out with Sludge Bomb, with Tapu Bulu threatening it out with Close Combat, or set up on it with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Salamence, Moltres, and Galarian Moltres can switch into Zarude's attacks easily. Salamence can weaken Zarude's hits with Intimidate, Moltres can threaten a burn with Flame Body, and Galarian Moltres resists both STAB attacks. They all must watch out for Rock Slide, though.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types can often check Zarude, due to the Grass-type resistance and good bulk. Scizor can pivot easily with U-turn and Celesteela can potentially set up on Zarude with Autotomize.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Kommo-o, Buzzwole, and Salamence all take minimal damage from Zarude's STAB attacks, with the former two resisting both. They can all retaliate with their STAB moves.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Jungle Healing allows Zarude to remove status conditions from moves such as Toxic from Aegislash and Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and Mew, while restoring 25% of its health. Rock Slide is an alternative option to hit Moltres and Salamence. U-turn grabs momentum on usual switch-ins such as Celesteela and Salamence. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Zarude to not worry about entry hazards, letting it constantly pivot throughout the game. Jolly is the required nature on the set so that Zarude can outspeed Nihilego and Salamence.</p> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots Zarude is seen on balance and bulky offense due to the easy pivoting provided by Heavy-Duty Boots and its ability to act as a status sponge against Toxic from Aegislash and Will-O-Wisp from Mew and Rotom-W. Rotom-H and Rotom-W both deal with Scizor, Mamoswine, and Nidoqueen, with Rotom-H also taking on Tangrowth and Celesteela and Rotom-W checking Salamence. Buzzwole can pivot into U-turn from Scizor, and punish it with potential Rocky Helmet damage. Zarude appreciates teammates that can outspeed Pokemon faster than it such as Thundurus, Keldeo, and Lycanroc-D, so Noivern and Azelf can help, while also dealing with physical walls such as Buzzwole and Amoonguss. Primarina, Nidoqueen, and Chandelure are wallbreakers that appreciate Zarude bringing them in on Kommo-o, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss, as they often have trouble switching in safely due to their low Speed and frailty. Entry hazard setters such as Rhyperior and Nihilego can soften up Pokemon like Tangrowth with Stealth Rock so that Zarude can deal more damage as it pivots around. The hazard setters appreciate Zarude dealing with Water-types such as Rotom-W, while Zarude appreciates them dealing with Moltres and Salamence.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Zarude's high Speed allows it to be a great user of Choice Scarf that can revenge kill Pokemon such as Keldeo and Thundurus in addition to boosted sweepers such as Gyarados and Dragon Dance Necrozma. Power Whip OHKOes Lycanroc-D and Keldeo. Darkest Lariat is Zarude's strongest Dark-type STAB move and can hit Jirachi and Aegislash for good damage. Jungle Healing can get rid of status conditions such as a burn from Moltres's Flame Body and Gastrodon and Seismitoad's Scald while regaining HP so that Zarude can be used in the long run in a battle but it is not ideal to lock into. Rock Slide allows Zarude to OHKO Moltres while also dealing good damage to Salamence. Close Combat hits other targets such as Cobalion that would not take much damage from its other moves. However, Cobalion is not very common, so Close Combat isn't common either. U-turn allows Zarude to pivot out on potential switch-ins such as Tangrowth, Celesteela, and Kommo-o, allowing it to gain momentum.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Zarude is an excellent pivot and revenge killer on bulky offense. It appreciates additional pivots such as Mienshao, Rotom-W, and Scizor that can form VoltTurn cores and pivot out of unfavorable matchups. For example, Mienshao can bring Zarude in on Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Galarian Slowbro. Entry hazard control allows Zarude to consistently pivot without worrying about hazard damage. Defog support from Rotom-H, Moltres, and Salamence is appreciated, and they can also check strong wallbreakers such as Mienshao, Scizor, and Kommo-o. Chandelure and Thundurus are wallbreakers that appreciate Zarude's pivot support and its ability to check Pokemon such as Rhyperior, with the wallbreakers KOing Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Scizor, and Celesteela in return. Nidoqueen is an entry hazard setter that appreciates Zarude dealing with revenge killers like Keldeo, Starmie, and Azelf for it while Nidoqueen can set Stealth Rock in return and also help deal with Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth. Primarina and Sylveon can help deal with some of Zarude's checks such as Salamence and Buzzwole, with Sylveon potentially also luring in Scizor and removing it with Mystical Fire.</p> "
