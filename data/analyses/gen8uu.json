  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Venusaur is a phenomenal sun sweeper in the current UU tier. Venusaur's defensive typing lets it set up on many common Pokemon like Tangrowth, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W, allowing it to clean teams with its Growth boots. With moves like Giga Drain for reliable recovery, a powerful 100-Base Power and sun-boosted Weather Ball, and Sludge Bomb or Earth Power, Venusaur is able to punch holes in many teams, as with a boost it 2HKOes nearly every Pokemon in the tier, barring Bulletproof Kommo-o and Chansey. With a Modest nature, it outspeeds every relevant Pokemon in the tier under sun except +2 Galarian Moltres. However, Venusaur is severely limited if sun is no longer active, being outsped and KOed by plenty of Pokemon like Salamence, Azelf, and Thundurus-T or used as setup bait for Pokemon like Galarian Moltres, Kommo-o, and Necrozma. Without a boost, Venusaur can sometimes be too weak to sweep, as common Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres are able to survive an unboosted hit and OHKO it back. Lastly, priority users such as Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine can pick off a weakened Venusaur.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Knock Off can be used to remove Chansey's Eviolite while also nailing Nihilego and Chandelure, but generally Venusaur benefits much more from its other moves; it can OHKO Nihilego and Chandelure with Earth Power, and after enough boosts from Growth it can damage Chansey with Giga Drain and outheal the damage done by Seismic Toss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: If Venusaur chooses to not run Earth Power, both Chandelure and Incineroar can stomach any of Venusaur's hits at +2 and take it out with a Fire-type attack. Rotom-H and Moltres are other Pokemon that can take an unboosted Sludge Bomb from Venusaur and KO it back with their Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Kommo-o: Kommo-o resists Giga Drain and is immune to Sludge Bomb and Weather Ball thanks to Bulletproof, so it can switch in and set up Stealth Rock, KO Venusaur outright, or use it as setup fodder if it's an offensive variant.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Special walls such as Chansey and Umbreon can take any of Venusaur's hits and stall out sun turns, with the former using Soft-Boiled and wearing it down with Seismic Toss and the latter being able to keep itself healthy with Wish + Protect and hit Venusaur hard with Foul Play due to Growth's attack boosts. Both Assault Vest Reuniclus and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro can take a +2 hit and KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Zygarde-10%, Lycanroc-D, and Mamoswine can revenge kill Venusaur using their priority moves if Venusaur is worn down, which can happen due to Venusaur sometimes having to take a hit to set up Growth while also dealing with Life Orb recoil.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weathers: Venusaur's sweeping capabilities can be halted by weather setters such as Alolan Ninetales and Pelipper cancelling Chlorophyll. This forces Venusaur out and Torkoal back in to reactivate sun, which can be taken advantage of by the opponent. Torkoal is also severely weakened by Stealth Rock if it has to come in multiple times during a game, and if it faints, Venusaur becomes dead weight.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Growth is a powerful setup move under sun, boosting Venusaur's Special Attack by 2 stages and allowing it to 2HKO nearly all the Pokemon in the tier. It can set up on popular Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Quagsire, and Tapu Bulu due to its typing, and then sweep through opposing teams. Giga Drain hits Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Primarina, Krookodile, and Rhyperior super effectively. Weather Ball is Venusaur's main attacking move under sun, as its Base Power becomes 100 and is boosted by the sun, KOing Steel-types that resist Giga Drain like Celesteela, Aegislash, and Jirachi. Sludge Bomb hits Pokemon that resist Giga Drain and Weather Ball like Salamence and Rotom-H while also hitting Fairy-types like Hatterene super effectively, though it will need a boost to OHKO the former two. Earth Power is an alternative option to hit Bulletproof Kommo-o, which resists or is immune to all of Venusaur's attacks, and has the added benefit of hitting Tentacruel, Chandelure, and Nihilego harder, but this leaves Venusaur susceptible to Salamence, as Giga Drain and Weather Ball are mandatory moves. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed ensures Venusaur is as strong and fast as possible. A Modest nature is typically used to maximize damage output while still nearly outspeeding everything under the sun, but a Timid nature can be used to outspeed +2 Galarian Moltres if needed. Life Orb is used to boost Venusaur's damage output, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Salamence, and Nidoqueen after a boost, while a boost to Giga Drain gives Venusaur insane damage output and reliable recovery, making it an unstoppable force.</p> <p>Venusaur only fits on sun teams, so Torkoal is a mandatory partner, as it is the most reliable sun setter in the tier. It provides the team with entry hazard support and entry hazard control with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, respectively. Other Pokemon that take advantage of sun like Chandelure and Charizard break holes in enemy teams thanks to their powerful wallbreaking capabilities amplified by sun, allowing Venusaur to sweep much more easily. Venusaur also appreciates momentum such as Teleport from Chansey to help it get in safely as well as give it more opportunities to set up; for example Chansey can bring Venusaur in on physical attackers like Krookodile and Azumarill, which are forced out by it under sun. Hatterene can be run as a Kommo-o check and discourages entry hazards from being set so Torkoal can come in more, allowing Venusaur to sweep more easily. Lastly, an offensive Kommo-o of your own can help the team deal with Pokemon like Chandelure while also giving it an easier matchup against Chansey.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen is an exceptional wallbreaker and capable entry hazard setter because Life Orb and Sheer Force let it 2HKO the entire UU metagame bar Chansey and bulky Galarian Moltres. Its solid defensive typing also lets it check Pokemon such as Nihilego and discourage common Electric-types such as Rotom-H from using Volt Switch. However, Nidoqueen can struggle to pivot into Electric-types like Raikou and Thundurus-T that commonly carry super-effective coverage to break through it. Unfortunately, Nidoqueen's overreliance on its Life Orb leaves it susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would pivot into like Nihilego. A low Speed stat gives Nidoqueen an undesirable matchup versus faster-paced teams, and although Nidoqueen sports a quality defensive typing, it is still weak to common Pokemon in the tier such as Mamoswine and Keldeo. These struggles sting a bit more because Nidoqueen has no form of reliable recovery, meaning it is worn down pretty quickly throughout a match. Lastly, Nidoqueen faces severe competition from her counterpart Nidoking, who sports better offenses and a higher speed tier, making it preferred on most teams. Still, Nidoqueen's better bulk and role compression as an entry hazard setter gives it a role on certain teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nidoqueen can run a bulkier set holding Black Sludge, as it can somewhat take advantage of its bulk and defensive typing to better check Lycanroc-D lacking Psychic Fangs and Mienshao and do a better job setting up entry hazards, but this set struggles because it is somewhat weak. Taunt does a decent job of giving utility Pokemon like Chansey a hard time. Substitute can be a viable option to ease prediction on a forced switch. Protect also helps prediction by letting Nidoqueen scout Choice-locked Pokemon it is weak to such as Krookodile and Jirachi.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is the single best answer to Nidoqueen, as it can consistently switch into its attacks without worry, recover any damage away, and chip Nidoqueen with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Azelf, Necrozma, and Starmie all can outspeed and KO Nidoqueen, with Necrozma being able to live a hit and use it as set up fodder thanks to its high natural bulk.

Earth Power and Sludge Wave are mandatory, powerful STAB moves that OHKO bulkier Pokemon such as Aegislash, Hatterene, and Tangrowth. Fire Blast is an excellent coverage move and the best pick for the last slot, as it almost OHKOes Amoonguss and cleanly 2HKOes Celesteela. Modest is the preferred nature because it grants Nidoqueen exceptional power and still lets it outspeed most of its primary targets, although a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Buzzwole, Timid Volcanion, and Timid Toxtricity. However, a Timid nature will make Nidoqueen noticeably weaker, missing out on benchmarks such as the guaranteed 2HKO on defensive Kommo-o.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu pairs very well with Nidoqueen, as it appreciates Nidoqueen taking care of Amoonguss and Tangrowth and in return can check Water-types like Azumarill, Starmie, and Keldeo.

Wallbreakers such as Azumarill and Lycanroc-D make good teammates because they also appreciate Nidoqueen's good matchup versus Amoonguss and Tangrowth. In return, they can remove specially defensive walls like Chansey and Galarian Moltres. Starmie is a decent teammate for Nidoqueen because it checks many Pokemon that threaten Nidoqueen, such as Keldeo. Rotom-H and Rotom-W are both Volt Switch users that can bring Nidoqueen in safely and also check Mamoswine, and the latter has the added benefit of checking Krookodile. Nidoqueen pairs well with almost any Kommo-o set, as Nidoqueen can break through Primarina and Hatterene to help it succeed.

Its great Speed tier allows it to set up Aurora Veil in front of common Pokemon like Keldeo and Zarude, and its access to support moves like Hypnosis allows it to gain momentum with a free switch and bring in frail sweepers like Diggersby and Thundurus-T more easily. Sadly, Ice / Fairy is not a great defensive typing, as Alolan Ninetales will drop easily to both offensive and defensive variants of Steel-types like Aegislash, Jirachi, and Celesteela, making it difficult to consistently get Aurora Veil up against some teams. Additionally, a lot of common leads can give Alolan Ninetales a hard time, such as Lycanroc-D, and Choice Scarf Jirachi KO it before it can set up Aurora Veil. Furthermore, the presence of rain in the metagame can hinder Alolan Ninetales's ability to set up Aurora Veil at times.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Alolan Ninetales has access to Nasty Plot, which can significantly boost its offensive presence while maintaining some bulk investment.

Encore can give a safe switch to gain momentum for any of Alolan Ninetales's teammates. It also can be used to shut down Pokemon that attempt to set up, such as Substitute Primarina and Swords Dance Aegislash.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Alolan Ninetales is in big trouble against any Steel-type Pokemon, in particular Choice Scarf Jirachi, which will OHKO it with Iron Head before it can set up Aurora Veil.

Rotom-H is a great Defogger against Alolan Ninetales, as it takes negligible damage from Freeze-Dry and can remove Aurora Veil immediately once it is set up, as well as threaten Alolan Ninetales with Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Alolan Ninetales struggles against Pokemon that are faster and can threaten to KO it or hinder its ability to properly set up Aurora Veil. Lycanroc-D and Jolly Scolipede are faster and can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Weather Changers: Weather teams, in particular sun teams with Torkoal and rain teams with Pelipper, will give Alolan Ninetales a hard time trying to keep Aurora Veil up.

Moonblast allows Alolan Ninetales to OHKO Crawdaunt, Buzzwole, and Kommo-o. Hypnosis can be used to put Pokemon to sleep that threaten to remove Aurora Veil with Defog or after Aurora Veil is up to allow you to safely switch in one of your sweepers. It also can be used to cripple Steel-types like Aegislash that threaten to KO Alolan Ninetales, but at 60% accuracy, this is very risky.

Heavy-Duty Boots allows Alolan Ninetales to ignore entry hazards and come in as much as possible to set Aurora Veil.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales fits exclusively on hyper offense teams, as only these teams can maximize the utility offered from Aurora Veil. Azumarill is typically a great partner, since it can help check Lycanroc-D with Aqua Jet.

Alolan Ninetales struggles against all Steel-type Pokemon, including slower ones like Celesteela, which can OHKO it through Aurora Veil. A partner like Krookodile or Nasty Plot Thundurus-T can help ease the pressure from these foes, the former also being able to support its teammates with Stealth Rock. Other good teammates include offensive Steel-types like Autotomize Celesteela and Swords Dance Aegislash, which can set up very easily under Aurora Veil to begin a sweep. Aegislash especially appreciates this as it can potentially activate a Weakness Policy more easily. Clangorous Soul Kommo-o and Dragon Dance Gyarados can also attempt to boost more than once under Aurora Veil.

While its Special Defense is excellent, its Defense and HP are fairly poor, making it difficult for Tentacruel to switch into strong physical attackers like Lycanroc-D and Buzzwole. This is further worsened by Tentacruel's mediocre attacking stats making it difficult to acquire KOs and leaving it overly reliant on status, which worsen its matchup against foes like Buzzwole and setup sweepers like Galarian Moltres and Azelf.

A more physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 236 Def / 20 Spe with a Bold nature is an option to check physical attackers like Lycanroc-D and Buzzwole more effectively, but the decrease in Speed will result in Tentacruel getting outsped by threats like Mamoswine and Rotom-H.

Hurricane is preferable on Galarian Moltres, as it prevents it giving free switches to a range of potent offensive threats such as Keldeo, Primarina, and Kommo-o. Nasty Plot is an option over Hurricane, as it provides the necessary power to overwhelm Pokemon like Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro. Rest and Sleep Talk allow Galarian Moltres to effectively check foes like Aegislash, absorb status, and lets it accumulate Berserk boosts. The Speed EVs let Galarian Moltres outspeed Aegislash, while the rest of the EVs with a Calm nature go towards special bulk to help Galarian Moltres against special attackers such as Aegislash and special Salamence. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Galarian Moltres from taking Stealth Rock damage, easing the need for it to use Rest often.</p> <p>This set can be challenging to fit onto teams because it has a very unique role and is vulnerable to powerful wallbreakers such as Primarina and Azumarill. It fares best on bulky offense and balance builds, however. Azumarill is a helpful partner to this set, as it is able to break through just about any special wall that can threaten Galarian Moltres, particularly Rhyperior and the rare Diancie. Galarian Moltres can help Azumarill by providing an ideal matchup against Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Assault Vest Tangrowth can help check Electric-types like Thundurus-T and Thundurus that can take advantage of Galarian Moltres, especially after using Rest. Buzzwole is a great partner that can help check foes like Lycanroc-D, Cobalion, and Obstagoon, as well as act as a better Knock Off absorber against the likes of Krookodile. In return, Galarian Moltres can check Pokemon like Amoonguss and Aegislash that limit Buzzwole from spamming its STAB moves. Diancie can provide Heal Bell support to wake Galarian Moltres up after it has used Rest. Steel-types like Jirachi and Aegislash are extremely important partners, checking one of Moltres-Galar's biggest checks in Nihilego. Jirachi can also provide Wish support so that Galarian Moltres doesn't have to use Rest as often.</p> "

Fiery Wrath's flinch chance also can give Galarian Moltres chances to break through bulkier Pokemon that can tank its attacks such as Chansey. Air Slash is an option over Hurricane if accuracy concerns arise. Weakness Policy is the optimal item for this set, as the most effective way to take down Galarian Moltres is a super effective attack, meaning it activates a decent amount of the time and gives Galarian Moltres exceptional power when coupled with Nasty Plot. Using Weakness Policy can also create opportunities for Galarian Moltres to set up in one turn by using Agility as a super effective attack hits it. Heavy-Duty Boots is also a viable item choice, as preventing Stealth Rock damage can make it much more challenging for an opponent to take down Galarian Moltres.</p> <p>Double Dance Galarian Moltres fits almost exclusively on hyper offense teams. Stealth Rock setters rack up chip damage on Pokemon that check Galarian Moltres such as Diancie.

Physical sweepers that fit well on hyper offense teams and can break through or soften up specially bulky Pokemon able to halt a Galarian Moltres sweep—such as Chansey and Nihilego—are appreciated as partners. Belly Drum Azumarill can fill this role; in return, Galarian Moltres has a great matchup against Grass-types that trouble Azumarill. Gyarados and Swords Dance Aegislash are also decent picks on hyper offense teams that can break through special tanks. Alolan Ninetales can provide Aurora Veil support to give Galarian Moltres an easier time setting up as it becomes exceptionally difficult to take down behind screens.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Azumarill is an offensive powerhouse and effective wallbreaker when equipped with a Choice Band due to Huge Power. It can also utilize a Belly Drum set to be a scary late-game cleaner. Water / Fairy is a great offensive typing, allowing Azumarill to beat key threats like Krookodile and Keldeo. Access to great coverage moves such as Knock Off and Ice Punch lets Azumarill break past Pokemon like Volcanion and Tangrowth that would otherwise check it by resisting its STAB combination, while access to Aqua Jet allows it to also be a great revenge killer, especially against top threats like Lycanroc-D and Thundurus that have taken chip damage. Azumarill also has decent natural bulk and a great defensive typing, which allows it to blanket check some of the more dangerous threats in the metagame such as Kommo-o and Salamence. Unfortunately, Azumarill is quite slow, so it is easily forced out by faster Pokemon such as Raikou and Thundurus when it is not boosted with Belly Drum. Additionally, Rotom-W and faster Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Zarude can revenge kill Azumarill, as they can stomach a +6 Aqua Jet. Belly Drum Azumarill is restricted to only getting one setup opportunity, which usually forces it to be preserved until late-game.</p> ",

Azumarill can run a trapping set with Sap Sipper and Whirlpool, Perish Song, and Protect. This can trap passive foes like Celesteela as well as Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth, but the effectiveness of this set is purely restricted to punishing walls and is deadweight against a majority of the offensive threats in UU.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Faster Grass-types like Zarude and Venusaur are the biggest threats to Azumarill because even a Belly Drum Azumarill cannot OHKO them with Aqua Jet and they OHKO back.

Ice Punch allows Azumarill to break through Amoonguss by hitting it hard enough to 2HKO on the switch. Knock Off can be used to burden anything that switches in, such as Tangrowth and Tentacruel, by removing their item.

Azumarill wants to fire off its STAB moves frequently, but it struggles to do so against bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Nidoking, Moltres, and Salamence can remove these Pokemon and make Azumarill's job easier. Kommo-o can offensively pressure Grass-types with its mixed set and can also check Volcanion. Keeping entry hazards up is important to ease Azumarill's ability to break through Tangrowth, so partners such as Krookodile and Nihilego are essential. Tapu Bulu and Zarude threaten to revenge kill Azumarill, as they are faster and resist Aqua Jet, so partners like Salamence and Amoonguss that can comfortably switch into them are ideal.

    "overview": "<p>Torkoal is the primary sun setter in UU, using its great physical bulk to switch into Pokemon like defensive Buzzwole and Zarude and set up sun while also providing role compression as a Stealth Rock setter and entry hazard remover. Torkoal serves as a great partner for sun sweepers like Venusaur, Charizard, and Chandelure by providing utility with moves such as the previously mentioned Stealth Rock alongside Yawn, Toxic, and Rapid Spin. However, Torkoal struggles with longevity, as it needs to use Heat Rock over Heavy-Duty Boots to provide more sun turns for its teammates, meaning every time it comes in it risks taking significant chip from entry hazards like Stealth Rock. It also has a lack of recovery, making it vulnerable to common enemy leads like Krookodile. Torkoal is also a momentum sink, meaning that the player will have to either switch directly into their sun sweepers like Venusaur and Chandelure, potentially forcing them to take damage, or sacrifice Torkoal to bring them in safely. Torkoal is also passive, often requiring status to stop Pokemon like Kommo-o, Primarina, and Galarian Moltres from setting up on it. It is also weak to common Pokemon like Lycanroc-D, Nihilego, and Nidoking, meaning Torkoal appreciates defensive support from other Pokemon like Chansey to help it set sun more reliably throughout the game.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rest can be run to give Torkoal more longevity, but generally it is hard to fit over utility options like Toxic and Yawn, as they are better to create momentum for Torkoal or cripple switch-ins. Explosion can act as a last-ditch option to deal heavy damage to an opposing Pokemon and generate momentum for a teammate; however, it is hard to fit over better utility options, and Torkoal's low Speed and weakness to common attacking types means it can be KOed before using Explosion. Thanks to its low Speed, Torkoal can also be run on Trick Room teams, utilizing a powerful sun-boosted Eruption. However, Torkoal is weak to chip and entry hazard damage caused by switching in too many times if it is running Choice Specs over Heavy-Duty Boots, weakening Eruption as a result. Lastly, when Trick Room is over, Torkoal can be easily used as setup fodder or KOed by an opposing Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Nihilego, Rhyperior, and Lycanroc-D can all hit Torkoal for super effective damage, with the latter two not caring about its sky-high Defense, limiting the ability to set sun in the future due to Torkoal's lack of momentum or reliable recovery. The former two can also set up Stealth Rock, limiting the amount of times Torkoal can come in.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Krookodile, Nidoqueen, and Diggersby also can hit Torkoal for super effective damage, limiting Torkoal's ability to set sun in the future. The former two are also able to set up Stealth Rock against Torkoal, limiting the amount of times it can come in. Krookodile can also hinder Torkoal with Taunt, preventing it from punishing setup sweepers with Toxic or Yawn. However, none of these like to switch into Lava Plume, and Krookodile and Diggersby detest a potential burn from it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Primarina, Keldeo, and Azumarill all can threaten Torkoal with their powerful Water-type attacks. However, if the sun is up, the power of these moves will be halved, and Torkoal will be able to switch out into Venusaur, forcing them out in return.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Due to Torkoal's average Special Defense, strong special attackers like Chandelure, Thundurus, and Salamence all can nail Torkoal for heavy damage. They can also use the sun to hit Fire-weak Pokemon like Venusaur even harder.</p> <p><strong>Pelipper: Pelipper can come in on Torkoal and remove sun with Drizzle.

Rapid Spin prevents Pokemon like Chandelure from being heavily chunked by Stealth Rock. Toxic puts Pokemon like Rotom-H, Chandelure, and Kommo-o on a timer, forcing them out.

Its ability in Storm Drain gives it an important Water immunity that allows it to switch into threats such as Rotom-W and scout Keldeo with a Choice item, while Gastrodon's stellar typing lets it reliably switch into most Fire- and Electric-type Pokemon not running specific coverage for it such as Rotom-H, Thundurus-T, and Chandelure. It additionally serves as a consistent answer to Nidoking. Gastrodon, however, carries a quadruple weakness to Grass, leaving it taken advantage of by Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Zarude in particular is very problematic as Jungle Healing prevents it from being crippled by Toxic or a Scald burn. Gastrodon is also vulnerable to coverage from threats such as Nihilego with Grass Knot and Gyarados with Power Whip. Gastrodon is also rather passive due to its mediocre attacking stats, it relies heavily on status to make progress in games against bulkier teams, and struggles to stop setup sweepers such as Kommo-o and Gyarados.

Dropping Scald also gives Gastrodon no way to punish Rotom-H. Toxic allows Gastrodon to passively chip bulkier targets such as Rotom-W and Salamence which otherwise don't care too much for Gastrodon's STAB attacks. Clear Smog is useful for stopping setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro, but it makes Gastrodon painfully passive. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Gastrodon to repeatedly switch in without being worn down by hazards, as they remove a large part of Gastrodon's functionality as a defensive Pokemon. Leftovers is an optional item to give Gastrodon passive recovery, but Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred due to how great ignoring hazard chip is.

Earthquake gives Seismitoad a better matchup against Calm Mind users like Keldeo and Galarian Slowbro at the cost of reducing Scald's damage output. Earth Power is usable to hit targets like Kommo-o harder but is generally not worth it, as Seismitoad now becomes setup fodder for the aforementioned Keldeo and Galarian Slowbro, and Earth Power fails to OHKO Nihilego. Toxic makes Seismitoad less passive against the likes of Tangrowth and Gastrodon switching in. It also helps Seismitoad outlast other Defoggers such as Salamence and Rotom-W. Knock Off is another option for crippling other switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Chansey, but it makes Seismitoad more passive against other Water-types such as Primarina and Gastrodon. 64 Speed EVs enable Seismitoad to outspeed Adamant Azumarill.</p> <p>Seismitoad fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its defensive qualities and Stealth Rock support. Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth are recommended because Seismitoad struggles to check Primarina, Keldeo, and Azumarill by itself, and they act as good Knock Off sponges for Seismitoad to maintain Leftovers. Wallbreakers that blow through Grass-types such as Salamence and Nasty Plot Rotom-H are appreciated. Defoggers such as Moltres and the aforementioned Salamence help keep entry hazards off the field to help maintain Seismitoad's longevity. Sylveon is also a good support teammate to keep Seismitoad healthy with Wish and Heal Bell while also checking Dragon-types like Kommo-o and Salamence that would otherwise give Seismitoad a more difficult time. The pair also provide a solid backbone against Keldeo. Togekiss can similarly play the role of a cleric and assist in pressuring Grass-types like Zarude and Tapu Bulu.

Scolipede's typing also provides it with opportunities to set up against foes such as Tangrowth and prevents it from being crippled by Toxic.

Intimidate lets Krookodile switch into resisted and neutral hits such as Lycanroc-D's Stone Edge without getting too worn down. It also helps prevent late-game sweeps from Pokemon like Salamence.

Incineroar, albeit uncommon, resists both of Chandelure's STAB moves and can take advantage of it to annoy a switch-in with either Knock Off or status. Galarian Moltres's high Special Defense allows it to tank hits from Chandelure to then set up. Umbreon is another good check thanks to its superb special bulk and Heal Bell, which allow it to handle Hex sets on its own.</p> ",

Overheat is also an option, offering even more power and notably damaging foes like Bulletproof Kommo-o and Incineroar more reliably. However, its Special Attack drop makes Fire Blast more spammable. Flamethrower is strong and accurate, preventing foes like Aegislash, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss from utilizing a lucky Fire Blast miss to cripple Chandelure. Psychic is an option that provides coverage against Kommo-o and Nihilego, though both these targets are adequately worn down by Chandelure's other attacks. Sleep Talk lets Chandelure act as a sleep absorber for its team, pivoting in on Amoonguss's Spore without being entirely crippled. Trick is another option in the fourth moveslot, however, to cripple defensive switch-ins like Chansey, Incineroar, and Tentacruel. Flash Fire allows Chandelure to pivot in on Fire-type attacks from foes like Moltres and Choice-locked Entei, boosting its damage output. Flame Body is also an option, however, to potentially punish physical attackers such as Buzzwole.</p> <p>This set is a solid fit on offense and balance teams for the massive wallbreaking prowess it offers. Chandelure appreciates entry hazard support for furthering damage on foes alongside its attacks; Rhyperior and Seismitoad are solid choices, additionally pivoting in on foes that can revenge kill it like Lycanroc-D and Thundurus. Entry hazard removal is also important due to this set's vulnerability to Stealth Rock. Tentacruel can pivot in on foes like Keldeo and Primarina while utilizing Rapid Spin. Rotom-W is a particularly strong teammate, as it can lure in Grass-types and pivot Chandelure into them with Volt Switch while also making use of Defog. Pivots that can bring Chandelure in safely for opportunities to wallbreak make good teammates. Thundurus can weaken foes with Knock Off and take on Water-types while bringing Chandelure in against foes like Tangrowth with Volt Switch. Zarude is another strong partner, pressuring foes like Primarina and Nihilego for Chandelure and bringing it in against Pokemon like Buzzwole and Amoonguss. Sweepers like Swords Dance Cobalion and Calm Mind Keldeo appreciate this set's wallbreaking prowess weakening teams for them to more easily clean up late-game. This set can struggle breaking past a few specially defensive Pokemon, such as Chansey and Tentacruel, making physically offensive Pokemon like Mienshao and Mamoswine decent partners to complement Chandelure's pressure.</p> "

Toxic burdens potential switch-ins like Bulletproof Kommo-o, Gastrodon, and Salamence, putting them on a timer and allowing Chandelure to potentially whittle them down with Hex. Protect allows Chandelure to rack up poison damage and can also scout Choice item users, such as Zarude and Primarina. Fire Blast is an option over Flamethrower, providing more power for breaking past foes like Galarian Moltres and Nidoqueen more reliably. Its lower accuracy can be a burden, however, against foes like Amoonguss and Tangrowth that can punish a miss. Taunt is an option over Protect, allowing Chandelure to pressure Chansey more effectively by blocking Chansey's recovery and Toxic, which boosts its stall matchup. However, Protect is often too valuable thanks to its stronger applications against offensive Pokemon. Heavy-Duty Boots significantly boosts this set's longevity and self-sufficiency. Flash Fire allows Chandelure to take advantage of foes like opposing Choice-locked Chandelure.

It can also let Chandelure cripple Pokemon that revenge kill it, like Knock Off Thundurus, as it faints.</p> <p>This set is a strong fit on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate Chandelure's ability to wear down defensive threats early- to mid-game. Chandelure notably struggles breaking past the likes of Nihilego and Tentacruel with this set's listed options, making Pokemon more equipped to handle them, like Nidoqueen and Seismitoad, good teammates. Both can also set Stealth Rock for Chandelure, whittling down its checks. Other entry hazard setters can work well too; Rhyperior can also ease the matchup against foes like Moltres and Thundurus, and Kommo-o can pivot in on opposing Chandelure. Sweepers like Cobalion, Keldeo, and Lycanroc-D appreciate Chandelure's ability to weaken bulky foes like Rhyperior and Primarina throughout a match with Toxic, allowing them to clean up more easily late-game. Chandelure appreciates them compensating for its slightly paltry Speed. Chandelure also enjoys pivots as teammates, as it doesn't often enjoy directly switching into play. In addition to providing pivoting support, Choice Scarf Jirachi can pressure faster Pokemon like Lycanroc-D and Nihilego, while Electric-types like Thundurus and Rotom-W can lure in Pokemon for Chandelure to take advantage of, like Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Rotom-W can also pivot in on various Ground-types, like Rhyperior and Krookodile. Other status spreaders can work well as teammates, alleviating Chandelure's need for prediction regarding Hex. Galarian Slowbro is particularly good at spreading status due to its tendency to run both Scald and Sludge Bomb. Tentacruel does this as well and can also utilize Knock Off to further cripple foes.</p> "

Knock Off allows Thundurus to run mixed sets to cripple checks like Seismitoad and Chansey, with Defiant making it even more difficult to switch into. However, Thundurus is rather frail and so struggles to find many opportunities to switch in safely. It is also prone to being picked off by common priority users such as Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine. Even after a Nasty Plot boost, Thundurus struggles to muscle past specially defensive walls like Chansey, which gives it competition from its stronger Therian forme.</p> ",

Using Defog with Prankster compresses entry hazard removal and guarantees Thundurus can always get entry hazards off the field in a last-ditch effort. Life Orb and Expert Belt can be run on either of Thundurus's sets, but it really doesn't appreciate being worn down by Stealth Rock, especially the pivot set. Superpower can be used on the mixed set alongside a Life Orb to let Thundurus lure in and break through Chansey while retaining coverage for Krookodile. Thunder is an option on rain teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Thundurus usually struggles to fit Sludge Wave on its sets, so it has some troubles breaking past Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Thundurus's lackluster defensive stats leave it prone to being 2HKOed by Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech, which recovers any damage. However, Thundurus can consistently wear them down via U-turn or potentially break past them with a Nasty Plot boost.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Priority Users: Starmie and Raikou are faster than Thundurus and can revenge kill it after minimal chip damage.

Volt Absorb also allows Thundurus-T to block Volt Switch attempts from Raikou and Rotom-W.

It also can't take priority moves like Accelerock and Ice Shard from Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine.

Combined with priority Thunder Wave, this easily distinguishes it from other Steel-types in the tier, particularly Aegislash and Jirachi. Klefki's base stats are rather subpar, making it very passive and stopping it from maximizing its great defensive typing. Its mediocre bulk and lack of recovery cause Klefki to struggle with checking powerful threats like Buzzwole and Lycanroc-D, while its lackluster offensive presence limits it to using status or Foul Play against Pokemon it cannot hit super effectively. Klefki struggles to pressure many entry hazard removers, particularly the Rotom formes, forcing it to run Toxic if it wants to cripple them.</p> ",

Play Rough can be used as the STAB move over Dazzling Gleam to hit Galarian Moltres harder, but it makes taking out Buzzwole much harder. Defog is an option, but Klefki is greatly outclassed in this role by better Pokemon like Salamence and Rotom-W. Switcheroo in combination with an item like Toxic Orb or Choice Band cripples foes like the Rotom formes, but these sets are very niche and overall not very useful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers: Rotom-W and Rotom-H can easily get rid of Klefki's Spikes with Defog and are both immune to Thunder Wave, so Klefki has to run Toxic to be able to cripple them. Tentacruel can also easily remove Klefki's Spikes with Rapid Spin and is immune to Toxic. However, Tentacruel greatly dislikes being paralyzed by Thunder Wave. Defensive Starmie can also remove spin and heal off any status from Klefki thanks to Natural Cure, though it does not like taking a Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Hatterene: Hatterene completely walls Klefki thanks to not fearing its Fairy-type moves and having Magic Bounce; it can take advantage of this by freely setting up with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Moltres, Volcanion, and Chandelure can all easily OHKO Klefki with their super effective STAB moves, though they all hate being paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types like Krookodile, Nidoking, and Mamoswine can also OHKO Klefki with their super effective STAB moves.

Spikes, in combination with Prankster, turns Klefki into a solid entry hazard setter that can easily get them up on the first turn of a match or when it is given a free switch in. It also helps to wear down bulky Pokemon that Klefki has trouble checking, such as Rhyperior and Chansey. Thunder Wave slows down opposing Pokemon such as Keldeo and Nihilego, which gives its slower teammates more opportunities to wallbreak. It also provides Klefki with a safety net against Speed-boosting setup sweepers, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Swords Dance + Scale Shot Kommo-o. Foul Play is used to deal with powerful physical attackers, like Gyarados. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to cripple Electric-types like Rotom-W and Rotom-H, which completely wall Klefki otherwise, as well as defensive Pokemon like Assault Vest Tangrowth. Leftovers provides Klefki with recovery, which it lacks otherwise. A specially defensive EV spread allows Klefki to check Pokemon like Salamence, Nihilego, and Galarian Moltres better. 16 Speed EVs allow Klefki to outspeed extremely fast Pokemon, such as Noivern, after paralyzing them.</p> <p>Klefki is best used on offensive teams that appreciate the early-game support that its status moves provide. Klefki gives Nidoking free opportunities to wallbreak so partners like Assault Vest Reuniclus and Rotom-W are appreciated to pressure it. Stealth Rock setters like Rhyperior and Nidoking form a solid entry hazard-stacking core with Klefki while also being able to deal with Rotom-H, a Pokemon that Klefki greatly struggles with. Pokemon that can pressure the Rotom formes are immensely important for Klefki, as they are some of its biggest counters if lacking Toxic. Kommo-o and Nihilego can deal with Rotom-H, while Zarude can take care of Rotom-W. Wallbreakers like Mamoswine and Primarina appreciate Thunder Wave slowing Pokemon that would otherwise take them out, like Gyarados and Mienshao, and Spikes weakening Buzzwole and putting Assault Vest Tangrowth within 2HKO range of Primarina's Moonblast. Water-types such as Keldeo and Azumarill are especially appreciated to take out Pokemon like Krookodile, Rhyperior, and Chandelure that force out Klefki easily. In turn, these Water-types appreciate Klefki's Spikes wearing down Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Late-game cleaners, like Gyarados and Nihilego, greatly appreciate Klefki's support wearing down bulky Pokemon like Buzzwole and Jirachi that often could wall them earlier in the game. Pokemon that can take care of Spikes blockers and removers, such as Tentacruel, Hatterene, and Starmie, are greatly valued to help Klefki keep its Spikes up for longer. Kommo-o and Salamence can take care of Tentacruel, Aegislash can take care of Hatterene, and Tangrowth and Zarude can take care of Starmie.</p> "

Furthermore, its defensive typing, access to reliable recovery, and decent bulk allow Noivern to reliably check threats like Keldeo and Zarude. Unfortunately, Noivern finds itself competing for a spot on teams with the tier's other Dragon / Flying type, Salamence. Salamence is much stronger and bulkier, which makes it a better wallbreaker and allows it to fulfill Noivern's defensive niche much more effectively than Noivern itself. However, Noivern's higher Speed, which is especially useful when dealing with massive threats like Keldeo, still makes it a solid option and a worthwhile pick over Salamence.</p> ",

Defog is a solid option, as Noivern is the fastest Defogger in the metagame and also checks common entry hazard setters like Jirachi and Kommo-o. However, Noivern struggles to fit Defog into its moveset, and if you want to run a Dragon / Flying Defogger, Salamence is a better option. Choice Specs is an option to make Noivern hit harder, but the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots makes Noivern incredibly susceptible to Stealth Rock, and thus it remains a very fringe option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Chansey brushes off all of Noivern's moves and forces it to switch out, though it does have to worry about Taunt. Rhyperior can also easily sponge Noivern's attacks except for Draco Meteor.

Flamethrower prevents Noivern from being completely walled by Steel-types, such as Aegislash, Jirachi, and Celesteela.

Thousand Arrows sets it apart from other Ground-types, as it can OHKO Pokemon that other Ground-types like Mamoswine struggle to break through like Rotom-W and Rotom-H. Thousand Arrows is also spammable in Grassy Terrain and against Flying-types, and the only UU Pokemon that resist it are Tapu Bulu, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth. Zygarde-10% is one of the only viable Extreme Speed users, allowing it to revenge kill weakened setup sweepers such as Gyarados. Zygarde-10% unfortunately has paper-thin defenses, meaning it cannot switch into virtually anything without taking big damage or being OHKOed. It even takes substantial damage from resisted attacks like Nihilego's Meteor Beam. Zygarde-10% also needs chip damage to OHKO many common threats like Primarina, and failing to OHKO them causes it to get slammed back. While Thousand Arrows provides great overall coverage, Zygarde-10% lacks reliable moves to overcome Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu, which can regain lost HP via Regenerator or Grassy Terrain, although Tapu Bulu must be wary of the possible Iron Tail.</p> ",

Scale Shot is an option on the Choice Band set over Outrage so that Zygarde-10% is not locked into a Dragon-type move for 2-3 turns. However, it is less reliable, as it can miss and can potentially hit only two times for much lower damage. Dragon Dance can be used with Life Orb to allow Zygarde-10% to sweep. However, Zygarde-10% will rarely get an opportunity to set up and will still struggle against Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu. Gyarados typically outclasses this set, as it is bulkier, deals more damage, has better coverage, and can snowball with Moxie. Zygarde-10% is fast enough to run a Coil set to bolster its offensive presence and allow it to hit just as hard as Choice Band, but without locking it into one move. This will also raise its Defense to allow it to withstand an extra hit and increase its accuracy to more reliably use moves like Iron Tail. Zygarde-10% will only realistically get an opportunity to set up against something it forces out, and it will still struggle against Tangrowth even after multiple boosts.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tangrowth totally walls Zygarde-10%, which can only use Toxic against it. Tapu Bulu has to be wary of Iron Tail but takes minimal damage from Thousand Arrows, is immune to Outrage, and can OHKO Zygarde-10%. Amoonguss is immune to Toxic and takes little damage from Thousand Arrows, forcing Zygarde-10% to lock itself into Outrage to 2HKO it, which leaves Zygarde-10% open to Spore or a switch to any Dragon-resistant Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-type Pokemon like Azumarill, Primarina, and Hatterene can freely switch in while Zygarde-10% is locked into a Dragon-type move and KO it. Additionally, while they do not handle Thousand Arrows well, they will not be KOed by it, and Primarina and Hatterene can recover lost HP with Draining Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users: Noivern can OHKO Zygarde-10% with Draco Meteor, though it doesn't switch into Thousand Arrows well. Choice Scarf users like Zarude and Krookodile can do major damage or OHKO Zygarde-10% with their strong STAB attacks. Mamoswine can OHKO Zygarde-10% with Ice Shard, and other priority users like Conkeldurr and Crawdaunt significantly reduce Zygarde-10%'s ability to stay in play.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Quagsire can shrug off Thousand Arrows and inflict Toxic back. Zygarde-10%'s only chance of breaking through them is to hit them with two Outrage attacks, which leaves Zygarde-10% vulnerable to a Fairy-type switch-in.

Kommo-o, Rhyperior, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can all form solid defensive cores with Primarina, as they are able to check Pokemon such as Volcanion, Thundurus, and Rotom-W nicely, while Primarina checks Salamence, Keldeo, and Moltres in return.</p> "

Common checks like Amoonguss can't deal with Primarina if it uses Substitute as they come in, as Primarina is faster and can set up with Calm Mind. Substitute also eases prediction when forcing switches from Pokemon like Salamence and Kommo-o. Draining Kiss aids Primarina in recovering HP, allowing it to take more hits and use Substitute if needed. However, Draining Kiss is a very weak move and will only pose a threat to many Pokemon if Primarina has accumulated enough boosts. Moonblast, on the other hand, is powerful from the start and lets Primarina not rely too much on Calm Mind boosts to threaten Water-resistant Pokemon like Tangrowth and Rotom-W. Scald is a reliable Water-type move, capable of burning Pokemon trying to check it, like Tentacruel, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Leftovers compensates the 25% loss in HP from Substitute. With the given EV spread Primarina is able to beat Amoonguss one-on-one, as it ensures Amoonguss can't break Primarina's Substitute after a Calm Mind. A faster spread with 136 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Conkeldurr but it will require two Calm Mind's for Amoonguss to not break its Substitute, leading to Spore mindgames.</p> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind Primarina fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, as its ability to come in on moves like Draco Meteor from Salamence is greatly appreciated by other teammates. By switching on these moves, Primarina can either get a Substitute up or set up with Calm Mind if its checks have been eliminated or weakened. Strong wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Nidoking, and Aegislash can get past bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Electric-types such as Raikou and Thundurus force Primarina out of the field if it doesn't have a Substitute up, so Pokemon like Rhyperior and Seismitoad take care of them. They can also set Stealth Rock to aid Primarina in its sweep. Amoonguss and Buzzwole can take on strong physical attackers such as Diggersby and Mamoswine for Primarina. Chansey is extremely annoying, as it can take boosted hits with ease and threaten Primarina back with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Conkeldurr, Lycanroc-D, and Swords Dance Diggersby are powerful wallbreakers that can muscle through Chansey and remove it for Primarina.</p> "

Access to strong coverage moves, such as Close Combat to break past Krookodile, Crunch to deal with Aegislash, and Psychic Fangs to break past Kommo-o makes Lycanroc-D one of the toughest Pokemon to wall in the tier. However, Lycanroc-D struggles to break through teams that run physically bulky threats such as Tangrowth and Buzzwole. Its poor bulk also means it cannot come in on almost anything, so it requires moves such as U-turn and Volt Switch to come in safely as well as occasional aggressive prediction on expected switches.</p> ",

Drill Run is nice to give Lycanroc-D excellent Rock- and Ground-type neutral coverage, but the only notable Pokemon it hits super effectively is Colbur Berry Galarian Slowbro. A Focus Sash lead Lycanroc-D is able to use Endeavor while setting up Stealth Rock, but this is generally not worth it in comparison to its other, much more dynamic sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu do not switch into Stone Edge well, but they resist Close Combat and threaten Lycanroc-D after switching in; the former also runs Rocky Helmet often, which punishes Lycanroc-D. Tangrowth is the biggest offender, since unboosted Close Combat damage is restored nearly completely by Regenerator, it commonly uses Rocky Helmet, and it can freely threaten Lycanroc-D's team in multiple ways after it comes in. Choice Scarf Zarude takes Accelrock well and can OHKO it with Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Choice Scarf Jirachi resists Lycanroc-D's Accelrock and can revenge kill it with Iron Head, only having to fear the rare Sucker Punch. Unless carrying the necessary coverage, Aegislash can safely pivot into Lycanroc-D multiple times and threaten to OHKO with either of its STAB moves. Aegislash can also remove Swords Dance Lycanroc-D if weakened into Shadow Sneak Range.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Foes like Suicune and Gastrodon that don't fall to one hit and are capable of firing back with super effective attacks pose problems for Lycanroc-D, which has to be kept in reserve while its teammates wear them down. Starmie naturally outspeeds and can threaten Lycanroc-D, though it must be wary of its health to avoid being taken out by Accelrock.

Close Combat is a powerful coverage option that nails many Rock resistant Pokemon such as Keldeo, Krookodile, and Kommo-o. Crunch hits Aegislash, Jirachi, and Galarian Slowbro harder. Accelerock is useful against offense teams, specifically keeping threats such Agility-boosted Galarian Moltres and Dragon Dance Salamence in check. It also makes Lycanroc-D more difficult to revenge kill with faster threats such as Venusaur in sun and Starmie. Sucker Punch can be used to deal more damage than Accelerock against neutral targets; however, it is only really useful for a better matchup against Choice Scarf Jirachi. A Life Orb is used to guarantee feats such as 2HKOing defensive Celesteela with Close Combat and Amoonguss with Stone Edge on the switch with Stealth Rock up. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is needed to make Lycanroc-D outspeed and threaten as many foes as it can, particularly Keldeo.</p> <p>Lycanroc-D fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to revenge kill common offensive threats such as Salamence without sacrificing its teammates' wallbreaking capabilities.

Entry hazards allow Lycanroc-D to leave greater dents in otherwise solid answers such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth, although residual damage from its foes' Rocky Helmet and its own Life Orb will noticeably sting. Krookodile is a great Stealth Rock setter that draws out Buzzwole and Amoonguss to remove their Rocky Helmets with Knock Off. Special attackers such as Moltres and Primarina appreciate Lycanroc-D's ability to break through Chansey, and in return they can help wear down common physically defensive threats such as Buzzwole for it.

This can allow a few common Pokemon, such as Keldeo, Mienshao, and Mamoswine, to muscle past Celesteela after relatively minimal chip damage. Celesteela also struggles to bypass popular Fire- and Electric-types such as Moltres and Rotom-W on its own, as well as various defensive picks like Tentacruel and Gastrodon; Tentacruel can utilize Liquid Ooze to take advantage of Leech Seed, while Gastrodon doesn't take meaningful damage from any of Celesteela's attacks, can restore any damage it sustains with Recover, and can threaten to chip Celesteela down with burns from Scald.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Celesteela's physical movepool contains solid options like Earthquake and Stone Edge, which allow it to run a physically based Autotomize set, effectively luring checks like Tentacruel and Rotom-H. However, this generally isn't as effective due to Celesteela's middling immediate power and hardships breaking various Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Intimidate Krookodile. Earthquake is an option in the fourth slot of the defensive set to still hit Steel-types super effectively while also hitting the likes of Tentacruel and Raikou hard. However, Flamethrower is usually way more valuable for its ability to pressure Zarude while still hitting Steel-types. Toxic cripples some of Celesteela's switch-ins on the defensive set, but it generally isn't as useful as its other options, and, due to foregoing Flamethrower, it notably prevents Celesteela from doing anything to Steel-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types like Moltres, Volcanion, Rotom-H, and Chandelure can pivot in on both Heavy Slam and Flamethrower and hit Celesteela hard with super effective STAB moves. They can also blanket check Celesteela's Autotomize set if it opts for Flash Cannon, though Meteor Beam can power through them. Moltres is particularly annoying, often being able to restore any chip damage it sustains from Leech Seed with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Raikou can tank hits from either of Celesteela's sets and proceed to break past it with super effective STAB attacks, though they all take fair damage from Meteor Beam. Raikou can be particularly troublesome to the defensive set, whittling Celesteela's PP with Pressure and utilizing Substitute and Calm Mind to safely set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Chansey doesn't take major damage from Celesteela's attacks and can whittle it down with Seismic Toss or bring in a teammate with Teleport. Gastrodon can tank hits from any set and heal off chip damage from Leech Seed with Recover, additionally utilizing Scald to potentially burn Celesteela. Tentacruel's Liquid Ooze punishes Leech Seed attempts and it doesn't take major damage from any attack Celesteela commonly runs. If it is running Haze, it can also stint the Autotomize set's progress.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Celesteela's defensive set becomes far easier to wear down if Leftovers, its most reliable means of passive recovery, has been removed. Knock Off users like Mamoswine, Krookodile, and Nihilego can wear it down immensely as it tries potentially pivoting in on them. The Autotomize set is also often reliant on whichever item it is running to pose a significant offensive threat, which can prevent Celesteela from setting up on foes like Nihilego and Tangrowth as safely as it would like to at times.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Celesteela's lack of reliable recovery allows particularly powerful wallbreakers, including Primarina, Mamoswine, Choice Band Buzzwole, and Aegislash, to quickly overwhelm it.</p> ",

It can also help to scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon, like Chandelure and Primarina.

Seismitoad and Gastrodon check both Rotom-H and Rotom-W, two of Celesteela's more effective answers, while applying pressure to Moltres with STAB Scald. Rhyperior is another good teammate, pivoting in on Fire- and Electric-type attacks for Celesteela while appreciating its ability to switch into Grass- and Ground-type moves. Defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss can also make solid teammates. Tangrowth is capable of pivoting in on several Pokemon for Celesteela, including Keldeo and Azumarill, while also utilizing Knock Off to wear down switch-ins like Moltres that can burden Celesteela. Amoonguss also checks the former two Pokemon and can match up well against Tapu Bulu. Both Pokemon can also pivot into mixed Thundurus and Krookodile, absorbing Knock Off for Celesteela throughout the match. Psychic-types like Reuniclus and Starmie are decent partners, handling Tentacruel and easing Celesteela's matchup against foes like Kommo-o and Nidoqueen.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Autotomize allows Celesteela to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and more easily snowball. It can find setup opportunities against a solid amount of common Pokemon that its defensive set forces out, including Zarude, Hatterene, and Nihilego. Fire Blast provides important coverage against Steel-types like Aegislash and Jirachi. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for its greater accuracy. However, Celesteela wants all the power it can get due to this set's nature as a sweeper. Meteor Beam grants Celesteela an opportunity to bypass Fire-types like Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure. It also deals massive damage to foes like Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Salamence, and the Special Attack boost it supplies is often extremely useful in boosting Celesteela's sweeping capabilities. Due to taking two turns, however, it must be used with Power Herb, and Celesteela must watch out for the opponent predicting the attack and bringing in a foe that resists it due to often being restricted to a one-time use. Flash Cannon is also an option in the fourth slot, offering more overall consistency and giving Celesteela a strong secondary STAB attack that deals decent neutral damage and hits Pokemon like Hatterene and Rhyperior super effectively. It does prevent Celesteela from luring some of its checks, however. Giga Drain is an option to bypass Quagsire, Rhyperior, and Rotom-W, which can otherwise tank various hits, though it generally doesn't provide too valuable of coverage otherwise. Beast Boost lets Celesteela boost its Special Attack upon netting KOs, giving it great sweeping potential. If Meteor Beam is not being run, Celesteela has no need for Power Herb and can then run Weakness Policy. This allows it to use its solid bulk to tank super effective hits, such as Fire-type moves from Salamence or opposing Celesteela, to gain a +2 boost in power, which heavily increases its threat level. This is particularly potent when Celesteela is behind dual screens, as often the only way to break past it at that rate is with super effective moves.</p> <p>This set fits on offensive builds, acting as a late-game sweeper that cleans weakened teams. Hyper offense teams do particularly well supporting Celesteela, sometimes employing dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Alolan Ninetales to increase its odds of reliably setting up. Entry hazards let Celesteela muscle past foes more easily, making setters like Krookodile good options for teammates. On hyper offense teams, leads like Azelf and Froslass work well for their ability to quickly set Spikes and keep up momentum with moves like Explosion and Destiny Bond, respectively. Powerful wallbreakers like Mienshao and Obstagoon make strong teammates, weakening teams for Celesteela to sweep through late-game. Depending on the coverage it opts for, Celesteela will struggle to reliably break past various Pokemon. If it isn't running Meteor Beam, checks to Fire-types are important due to most being able to tank Air Slash and revenge kill Celesteela. Keldeo can outspeed and pressure Rotom-H and Moltres, while Rhyperior can pivot in on both. Without Flash Cannon, Celesteela can't hit Rock-types like Rhyperior and Nihilego super effectively. Pokemon like Keldeo and Zygarde-10% can pressure said Rock-types, making them solid partners. Electric-type checks are important due to Celesteela's iffy matchups against most in the tier. Zarude can pivot in on Rotom-W and make decent progress with its pivoting capabilities. Seismitoad can handle Raikou, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H while tanking hits from and crippling Thundurus. Additionally, it offers utility with Stealth Rock and Knock Off. Lastly, sweepers like Thundurus-T and Azumarill often fit well with offensive Celesteela variants, helping pressure the likes of Rotom-H and Milotic.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Barraskewda's high Speed tier lets it outspeed threats like Thundurus and Keldeo, and alongside its decent Attack stat, gives it a niche as a fast wallbreaker. Under rain, Barraskewda is a powerful wallbreaker, outspeeding the whole tier and wiping out defensive Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, Celesteela, and even Water-resistant foes like Primarina. Its excellent coverage allows it to bypass would-be checks like Amoonguss, Tapu Bulu, Salamence, and Zarude. Barraskewda is also an effective pivot with Heavy-Duty Boots thanks to its high Speed tier and Flip Turn, which help it wear down opposing teams and form a VoltTurn core with Pokemon like Zarude and Rotom-H. However, Barraskewda is very frail and cannot switch into many Pokemon, requiring heavy pivot support or double switches to get in on the field safely. If running a Choice Band, Barraskewda is very prediction reliant and can be taken advantage of by Water-resistant foes such as Tangrowth and Rotom-W, while Heavy-Duty Boots Barraskewda is quite weak and forced out by threats it cannot deal sufficient damage to, like Salamence, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth. Barraskewda also struggles to fit all the moves it wants, meaning it ends up walled by Pokemon such as Tangrowth if it forgoes Poison Jab or Keldeo if it drops Psychic Fangs. Barraskewda faces competition from other Water-type wallbreakers like Keldeo and Starmie, which have much better bulk, less struggles with fitting coverage, and are less reliant on rain or an item to wallbreak.</p> ",

They can either cripple it with Toxic or deal heavy damage to it. Rotom-W takes any of Barraskewda's attacks and KOes it with Volt Switch, but it cannot switch into Barraskewda under rain.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types with Regenerator like Amoonguss and Tangrowth can take any of Barraskewda's attacks and easily heal it off; they also force Barraskewda to lock into an undersiable move like Ice Fang or Psychic Fangs or Ice Fang, which leaves it vulnerable to other threats like Aegislash. However, Amoonguss is 2HKOed by Ice Fang. Choice Scarf Zarude is able to outspeed and revenge kill Barraskewda if rain is not up.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: If rain is not up, Barraskewda is vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao, Zarude, and Krookodile; priority users like Lycanroc-D and Zygarde-10% can also pick off a weakened Barraskewda.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Choice Band Barraskewda is very vulnerable to entry hazard damage.

Ice Fang nails Dragon-types like Salamence and Noivern and Grass-types like Amoonguss and Zarude. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to gain momentum by pivoting against predicted switch-ins like Tangrowth. The last move slot is dependent on what Barraskewda wants to beat. Poison Jab is able to KO Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Assault Vest Tangrowth more reliably than Ice Fang, although it can only 2HKO the latter with Choice Band. It also has handles Azumarill and Primarina. Psychic Fangs is another option that helps Barraskewda super effectively damage switch-ins like Amoonguss, Kommo-o, and Buzzwole, notably 2HKOing the former two with Choice Band. It also helps Barraskewda check Keldeo, a huge threat to rain teams. Close Combat is Barraskewda's best option to damage Pokemon like Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Rotom-W, which take little from any of Barraskewda's attacks, while also hitting Chansey and Zarude super effectively. Choice Band boosts Barraskewda's wallbreaking power tremendously, letting it 2HKO many walls like Amoonguss, Celesteela, and even Water-resistant foes like Noivern under rain. Choice Band should be primarily used on rain teams to take advantage of rain-boosted Liquidation, while Heavy-Duty Boots is more desirable on VoltTurn teams. An Adamant nature should be used, as Barraskewda naturally outspeeds nearly every Pokemon in the tier. A Jolly nature is an option to outspeed Noivern outside of rain if the team is weak to it, but Noivern isn't too common.</p> <p>Pelipper is a great partner on rain teams, setting rain and wearing down Grass-types like Tangrowth with Hurricane. It also can clear entry hazards with Defog, preventing Barraskewda from being worn down, and bring in Barraskewda safely with U-turn. Other Pokemon found on rain teams like Kingdra, Keldeo, and Seismitoad appreciate Barraskewda muscling through defensive answers like Chansey and Celesteela for them, and they are able to deal with Pokemon such as Salamence, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth in return. Kingdra and Keldeo are also able to help wear down Grass-types like Amoonguss for Barraskewda to KO more easily, while Seismitoad acts as an Electric-type immunity for rain teams and can provide Stealth Rock support to wear down Pokemon like Rotom-W easier. Thundurus-T is another wallbreaker on rain teams that appreciates Barraskewda being able to revenge kill threats like Mienshao and Nihilego and specially defensive walls like Chansey; in return it can dispatch bulky Water-types like Volcanion and Milotic. Entry hazard support from setters like Nihilego and Jirachi can wear down checks like Celesteela into 2HKO range of a Choice Band-boosted Liquidation. Pivots commonly found on VoltTurn teams like Zarude and Rotom-H are great teammates for Heavy-Duty Boots Barraskewda. Zarude can bring Barraskewda in on Fire-types like Moltres and Rotom-H and handle bulky Water-types like Seismitoad and Gastrodon, while Rotom-H is able to remove Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth and also deal with Buzzwole for Barraskewda.</p> "

Thanks to Punk Rock and Boomburst, Toxtricity is able to deal heavy damage to walls like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Rhyperior and maintain pressure on Pokemon that resist its STAB combination, such as Nidoqueen and Seismitoad. In addition, Toxtricity has a relatively decent defensive typing, allowing it to come in on Iron Head from Jirachi and Close Combat from Cobalion and threaten to 2HKO them. It can also pivot into various passive Pokemon such as Togekiss and Amoonguss. Despite Toxtricity's middling Speed, Shift Gear can allow it to outpace foes like Keldeo, Salamence, and even Choice Scarf Krookodile, making it a great late-game cleaner on offensive teams. However, Toxtricity's STAB attacks and Boomburst have immunities, making it a prediction-reliant wallbreaker that struggles to break through cores like Aegislash + Krookodile. Although Toxtricity's base 75 Speed is enough to outspeed the bulkier threats it is able to deal with, its bulk leaves it prey to revenge killers such as Keldeo, Lycanroc-D, and Krookodile. Additionally, priority users such as Crawdaunt, Lycanroc-D, and Mamoswine can all halt a sweep by KOing a chipped Toxtricity.

Nuzzle is an alternative over Mystical Fire for crippling Jirachi and Aegislash, though Hatterene does miss out on hitting Reuniclus with Special Attack drops. Assault Vest alongside Nuzzle is an option to make Hatterene more bulky without a boost while still crippling the likes of Aegislash and Jirachi, but it faces stiff competition from Reuniclus, which has more consistent healing with Regenerator and better bulk to handle threats such as Keldeo.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Hatterene's poor Speed, lack of consistent recovery, and reliance on a Calm Mind boost to be a consistent threat makes it easy for Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Diggersby, and Crawdaunt to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Jirachi takes little damage from Hatterene's STAB moves and threatens it back with Iron Head, though it dislikes Mystical Fire. Aegislash is an especially detrimental offensive threat, because even if it takes Mystical Fire on the switch a weakened Shadow Ball still threatens substantial damage; the Swords Dance set can take a Mystical Fire and obliterate Hatterene with a STAB move. Celesteela does not take too much damage from Mystical Fire due to its massive special bulk, and it 2HKOes with Heavy Slam.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Hatterene has plenty of opportunities to gain a Calm Mind boost against various entry hazard setters such as Seismitoad and Kommo-o, though it does have to be wary of Poison Jab from the latter. It can also set up against other defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Milotic. Calm Mind notably helps Hatterene stomach hits from strong attackers such as Choice Specs Keldeo better and retaliate with Draining Kiss. Draining Kiss is mandatory as a powerful recovery tool and is instrumental against Chansey; after three boosts, Draining Kiss + Leftovers will outheal Seismic Toss's damage. Psyshock is useful against opposing Calm Mind users, most notably Reuniclus and Primarina, as well as a more immediate weapon against Chansey. Psychic is an alternative option because it OHKOes Amoonguss after one Calm Mind boost instead of two. It also helps Hatterene pressure Quagsire better with Special Defense drops, but it comes at the cost of not immediately threatening Chansey. Mystical Fire is vital to deter Steel-types looking to come in on a Calm Mind or STAB move like Celesteela, Jirachi, and Aegislash. Leftovers augments the recovery from Draining Kiss and makes Hatterene harder for Pokemon such as Suicune to wear down. Hatterene needs 12 EVs in Speed to outrun Amoonguss and 56 EVs to outspeed Quagsire and help against stall, though the latter Pokemon is uncommon</p> <p>Hatterene fits well on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its Magic Bounce relieving entry hazard pressure from Kommo-o. Pokemon that handle hazard setters Hatterene cannot switch into well like Nidoqueen, Jirachi, and Nihilego are appreciated. Milotic is able to eat a hit from all of them and retaliate with Scald; it also provides Flip Turn support so Hatterene can come in on threats such as Amoonguss without risking damage. Hazard support from teammates such as Krookodile and Chansey wears down Hatterene checks such as Aegislash and Celesteela. Krookodile is an effective teammate because it's able to offensively check Nidoking and wear down Amoonguss with Knock Off, whereas Chansey is more reliable against Nidoking and non-Rest Galarian Moltres. Fire-types can blow through Steel-types that Hatterene has issues with; Rotom-H and Moltres are notably able to check Aegislash and take advantage of Celesteela. Other pivots such as Rotom-W help Hatterene come in against Pokemon such as Kommo-o. Rotom-W also has Will-O-Wisp to cripple Jirachi and Mamoswine.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Obstagoon is the only Guts user with STAB Facade, allowing it to pressure Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Nidoqueen. Its solid bulk, decent Speed, and access to STAB Knock Off make it a unique offensive threat. Obstagoon can outspeed many metagame staples such as Rotom-H, Rotom-W, Krookodile, and Galarian Moltres. It has an excellent matchup against slower bulkier teams because of its status immunity, ability to heal off chip damage with Rest, and high damage output with STAB Knock Off. Due to its poor defensive typing, Obstagoon can be pretty easy to revenge kill or pressure, and Fighting-types like Keldeo and Kommo-o can be especially problematic. Also, it tends to have poorer matchups against hyper offense, as teams pack more faster threats that give Obstagoon few opportunities to wallbreak, although it still can potentially pick up a KO or two.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bulk Up makes Obstagoon more difficult to revenge kill due to the increase in power and bulk, but its 4x weakness to Fighting still makes getting anywhere with setup difficult in the long term. It can also run an Adamant nature to hit harder, allowing it to OHKO Nidoqueen and Azumarill, but this makes Obstagoon slower than other Pokemon it would normally outspeed such as Kommo-o, Krookodile, Rotom-H, and Rotom-W. Obstruct can stall a turn to activate Obstagoon's Flame Orb while also potentially halving the Defense of normal checks such as Scizor. Parting Shot allows it to pivot on switch-ins such as Buzzwole.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types Moves: Fighting-types such as Keldeo can outspeed Obstagoon and KO it with ease with their STAB moves. Conkeldurr can also KO it with Mach Punch. Faster Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage like Lycanroc-D can also threaten it out. All of these Pokemon struggle to pivot into Obstagoon.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Buzzwole and Diancie almost completely stonewall Obstagoon. Neutralizing Gas Galarian Weezing can even remove its Guts boost and force it to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Obstagoon puts itself on a timer as soon as it activates Flame Orb, so it can prematurely faint after a strong neutral hit. Entry hazards can chip it down a lot in conjunction with the burn damage. This residual damage also pressures Obstagoon to use Rest often, limiting its effectiveness as a wallbreaker.</p> ",

Rest can patch up residual damage from Rocky Helmet users such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss. It can also let Obstagoon completely wall SubToxic Aegislash and give Obstagoon longevity against bulkier teams. Sleep Talk lets Obstagoon be a potent wallbreaker while asleep thanks to Guts remaining active. Close Combat OHKOs the only Pokemon in the tier that resist Obstagoon's STAB combination, Cobalion, while also letting it hit foes like Krookodile harder. Switcheroo can be used alongside Close Combat to cripple some slower physical attackers like Azumarill, Crawdaunt, and Tapu Bulu. It can also mess with defensive Salamence and Buzzwole by adding chip damage and getting rid of the former's Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p>Obstagoon fits well onto bulky offense and balance teams that can generate turns for it to break consistently with the right offensive and defensive pivots. Rotom-H can bring Obstagoon in safely and pressure Amoonguss, physically defensive Tangrowth, and Celesteela. Obstagoon can also fit well on Sticky Web teams with Araquanid and Shuckle to patch up its Speed a bit. It also appreciates entry hazard support in general so it can get the extra chip for easier OHKOs against Pokemon such as Nidoqueen. Stealth Rock support from Nidoqueen and Nihilego allows Obstagoon to OHKO Azumarill and Mamoswine and even gives it a chance to 2HKO Tangrowth. Amoonguss can be a great defensive pivot, using Regenerator and its Fighting resistance to check foes that would try to revenge kill Obstagoon like Keldeo.</p> "

Its Speed enables it to outspeed common Pokemon such as Nihilego and Thundurus-T, and its good bulk and defensive typing let it check many dangerous threats such as Crawdaunt and Krookodile. The ability to heal status conditions and HP with Jungle Healing can allow Zarude to consistently pivot around defensive Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Aegislash. However, it often struggles to break defensive Pokemon, such as Celesteela, Buzzwole, and Salamence, due to them resisting Power Whip and taking minimal damage from Darkest Lariat. Zarude also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, potentially having to give up an important coverage move or the ability to heal off status conditions. Also, many teams run many Pokemon with a Grass-type resistance such as Kommo-o, Tangrowth, and Moltres, leaving Zarude with limited opportunities to click its strongest STAB attack. If it is running Choice Scarf, Zarude can risk being locked into an undesirable move, losing momentum. Flame Body from Moltres and Rocky Helmet from Amoonguss and Tangrowth can punish U-turn, forcing momentum to be sacrificed to use Jungle Healing.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Band allows Zarude to function as a powerful wallbreaker. However, the lack of Speed from Choice Scarf and increased prediction-reliance are problematic, and it still struggles to break through Buzzwole, Kommo-o, and Salamence. A Bulk Up set with Jungle Healing, Power Whip, and Darkest Lariat allows Zarude to deal heavy damage and potentially tank super effective hits. However, it has no room for any coverage moves, so it is still not capable of breaking through checks like Tangrowth and Buzzwole. Psychic Seed alongside Bulk Up + Synthesis on Psychic Terrain teams allows it to be a fantastic Krookodile counter, greatly benefiting its teammates by allowing them to spam their Psychic-type moves more easily. Zarude can also become a better setup sweeper by taking hits from Salamence and Tangrowth more easily. Taunt is an option that can completely shut down Chansey's recovery and prevent Roost from Salamence, but Zarude would have to give up Jungle Healing or valuable coverage. Encore on Choice Scarf sets can be used to punish setup sweepers such as Galarian Moltres and Dragon Dance Salamence so that a teammate such as Mamoswine can safely switch in and threaten them. However, it is very situational, and Zarude is forced to switch afterwards.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fast U-turn Users: Faster Pokemon such as Noivern and Choice Scarf Mienshao are able to put Zarude in a tough spot. It either has to take heavy damage from U-turn, or switch out, meaning that Noivern and Mienshao can pivot freely.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth take little damage from Zarude's STAB attacks, while Tapu Bulu resists both. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can threaten Zarude out with Sludge Bomb, with Tapu Bulu threatening it out with Close Combat, or set up on it with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Salamence, Moltres, and Galarian Moltres can switch into Zarude's attacks easily. Salamence can weaken Zarude's hits with Intimidate, Moltres can threaten a burn with Flame Body, and Galarian Moltres resists both STAB attacks. They all must watch out for Rock Slide, though.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types can often check Zarude, due to the Grass-type resistance and good bulk. Cobalion only fears the rare Close Combat and can nail Zarude with super effective damage, while Celesteela can potentially set up on Zarude with Autotomize.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Kommo-o, Buzzwole, and Salamence all take minimal damage from Zarude's STAB attacks, with the former two resisting both.
