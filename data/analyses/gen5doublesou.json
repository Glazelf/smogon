  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>With its great bulk, typing, and offenses, Zapdos makes for a great choice in the Doubles metagame. It has no trouble checking common Pokemon such as Scizor, Breloom, and Garchomp thanks to its useful set of resistances and immunities, and its high base 125 Special Attack in tandem with its good Speed and coverage options make it no slouch offensively either. One of the main problems with Zapdos is the fact that the tier has no shortage of viable Electric-types, meaning that Zapdos must often compete with Pokemon such as Thundurus and Rotom-W for a team slot. While the aforementioned Pokemon might seem to outshine Zapdos, with Thundurus boasting Prankster Thunder Wave, Taunt, and Substitute and Rotom-W having Water-type STAB, Zapdos's access to unique moves such as Heat Wave and Tailwind as well as superior bulk allows it to distinguish itself from its peers.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Light Screen can be a nice option to help Zapdos cushion itself against special attackers, but Tailwind allows Zapdos to simply outspeed them. A set with Rain Dance and Thunder could be a nice option on rain teams to help in weather wars, but because Zapdos is threatened by most other weather inducers it's not the best Pokemon for a set like this. If you want to make Zapdos more geared towards fighting rain, Sunny Day is an option as Zapdos can eliminate Politoed with a STAB-boosted Thunderbolt and then dispel Drizzle. Volt Switch is a nice way to gain momentum while attacking, but it is weaker than Thunderbolt and forcing Zapdos out upon use may be problematic when you need to attack repeatedly. Substitute can be nice to set up on resisted hits from Pokemon such as Hitmontop, but Thundurus is generally better suited to using a Substitute set thanks to access to Prankster. Roost can be a nice option over Detect to allow Zapdos to heal off damage, but it removes its Ground-type immunity, which can be harmful, and it is of little use if the opposing Pokemon is faster than Zapdos. A set using either Choice Scarf or Choice Specs can be used, but Zapdos prefers to be able to switch moves due to its great coverage. Thunder Wave is a nice option to cripple fast Pokemon, but then it faces extreme competition from Thundurus, which has priority on the move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Rotom-H is an amazing counter to Zapdos, as it resists every move Zapdos carries and can damage it heavily with its own STAB moves. Mamoswine and Weavile can dispatch Zapdos easily with their Ice-type STAB moves. Mamoswine has no trouble taking any hit Zapdos can throw at it, while Weavile can outspeed and use Ice Punch to take it out. Terrakion, Tyranitar, and Excadrill can all deal large damage to Zapdos with Rock Slide. Tyranitar in particular is problematic since it gets STAB on Rock Slide and can easily switch into any of Zapdos's attacks due to the Special Defense boost it gets in sandstorm. Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Kyurem-B can all switch into most of Zapdos's attacks and strike back with a powerful Dragon-type attack. Rhyperior is an excellent counter because not only does it have an immunity to Thunderbolt and access to a powerful STAB-boosted Rock Slide, its Lightningrod ability makes it so Zapdos cannot even use Thunderbolt to damage Rhyperior's partner. Rhyperior must watch out for a Hidden Power Grass, though. Common hail Pokemon such as Abomasnow and Rotom-F make good checks to Zapdos, as they can strike with a powerful Blizzard made 100% accurate by hail. They also both resist Zapdos's Thunderbolt, though both must be wary of Heat Wave.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Tailwind",
        "description": "<p>With this set, Zapdos is able to take advantage of its distinguishing qualities most effectively, turning into an excellent offensive support Pokemon. Thunderbolt is the main STAB move, allowing Zapdos to maul bulky Water-types such as Politoed and Jellicent and granting it good neutral coverage across the board. Hidden Power Flying is a nice option in the second slot, granting it a secondary STAB move as well as hitting Pokemon such as Hitmontop, Breloom, and Ludicolo harder than any other moves Zapdos carries. If you'd rather be able to eliminate Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Salamence as well as both Landorus formes, Hidden Power Ice can also be used. Tailwind is an excellent option for the third slot, granting Zapdos and its partners some great Speed control. In addition, Zapdos becomes a much better check to weather-based teams, as it can now compete with Pokemon such as Kingdra and Excadrill that receive a boost to their Speed in their respective weathers. While Protect might seem like a better choice than Detect due to its higher PP, Detect's relative rarity means that you do not have to worry about it being blocked through Imprison, making it the main choice here. If you find Detect unnecessary, Heat Wave can be used to incinerate Pokemon such as Scizor, Metagross, and Abomasnow.</p> <p>Sitrus Berry is the main option to increase Zapdos's survivability. If you're using Hidden Power Flying, Flying Gem is also an option, as it allow Zapdos to gain some key OHKOs, such as on Ludicolo, Shaymin-S, Hitmontop, Abomasnow, Scrafty, and Volcarona. The EVs in Speed let Zapdos outrun up to Jolly Breloom so Zapdos can KO it before it can use Spore. The use of 144 HP EVs instead of 148 might seem odd, but it makes Zapdos's HP an odd number, limiting the recoil damage it takes at the end of each turn from hail and sand. Unfortunately, this EV spread leaves Zapdos still outrun by Kingdra and Excadrill in their respective weather conditions even after Tailwind, so a more offensive spread of 92 HP / 252 SpA / 164 Spe can be used to get the jump on them. If you are in need of a spread move, Discharge is a nice option with a good chance of paralysis, but the fact that it hits Zapdos's partner can be irritating, as it will force you to either Protect or switch in a Ground-type to avoid taking damage and potentially paralyzing your own Pokemon. Hidden Power Grass is an option to get rid of Gastrodon, which otherwise has little to fear from Zapdos. However, this leaves Zapdos unable to hit Dragon-types, which can be problematic. A Yache or Charti Berry could be used to allow Zapdos to take a powerful Ice- or Rock-type hit, respectively, but Sitrus Berry is typically a better option. If Zapdos is paired with rain support, Thunder can be a nice option due to its higher Base Power and 30% paralysis chance, but due to how common weather changes are, its shaky accuracy outside of rain can be off-putting.</p> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Tailwind support, such as Garchomp, Genesect, Heracross, and Mamoswine, make for good partners. Garchomp and Mamoswine further enjoy not having to worry about hitting Zapdos with Earthquake, while Genesect and Heracross can eliminate Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Abomasnow that could otherwise cause problems for Zapdos. Steel-types such as Scizor and Metagross make for great partners, as they have no problem dispatching the Ice- and Rock-types that threaten Zapdos. Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Breloom are also good partners, for similar reasons. Pokemon that struggle with bulky Water-types such as Excadrill, Landorus, and Garchomp enjoy being paired with Zapdos, as it has no trouble dealing large damage to Water-types with its STAB-boosted Thunderbolt. In return, their Ground-type STAB allows the aforementioned Pokemon to handle the Rock-types that pose a problem for Zapdos. Hitmontop makes for an excellent partner for Zapdos, as Fake Out gives Zapdos more opportunities to use Tailwind, Intimidate helps cushion Zapdos against physical hits and allows it to stick around longer, and Wide Guard shields Zapdos from Rock Slides and Blizzards that could take it out.</p> "

  "Hitmontop": {
    "overview": "<p>Even though Hitmontop has had a mediocre reputation in singles throughout all generations, its movepool and ability make it perfect for Doubles. With access to Intimidate, Fake Out, and Wide Guard, Hitmontop is the master of creating free turns. It can switch in on the majority of physical attackers in the tier, and proceed to immobilize the more threatening half of the opposition for a turn; Hitmontop is also able to break Protect with Feint and shut down spread moves with Wide Guard. It does not end here, for Hitmontop's Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat allows it to OHKO Chople Berry Tyranitar, Heatran, and Kingdra; the move also deals heavy damage to almost anything that doesn't resist it, allowing Hitmontop to fill the role of a supporter and a powerful attacker with the same moveset, increasing its versatility.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Almost all of Hitmontop's other options don't really shine in Doubles. You could, of course, run some extremely situational items, such as Coba Berry for Flying-types on the bulky set or Dark Gem on the offensive set to KO Latios, but item-wise, Hitmontop usually won't utilize anything as consistently as Fighting Gem or Sitrus Berry. Stone Edge can be used specifically to hit Flying-types, such as Zapdos and Thundurus, who would otherwise give Hitmontop a lot of trouble. A spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe is also usable to avoid other Hitmontop's Fake Outs, whilst catching Pokemon such as Breloom off guard with a Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat.</p> <p>A completely different set would be a priority attacking set with Life Orb and Technician. It takes a completely different approach to using Hitmontop, and could provide strong Fake Outs and Mach Punches, which, when used alongside Sucker Punch, would create perfect neutral priority coverage. This would of course, mean that Hitmontop would have to give up Intimidate, and because Intimidate is one of the best abilities in the metagame, it would be a harsh loss to suffer.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Perhaps Hitmontop's biggest problem is sturdy, hard-hitting Flying-types with STAB moves. Zapdos or Thundurus carrying Hidden Power Flying will severely damage Hitmontop, and Hitmontop cannot do much in return bar hitting them with the rare Stone Edge. Even if it has Stone Edge, it won't be able to OHKO Zapdos, and only has a 12.5% chance to OHKO 4 HP / 0 Def Thundurus. Defiant Tornadus is the most problematic Flying-type, considering it not only ignores Intimidate, but gains a boost from it, allowing it to easily OHKO Hitmontop with Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Bisharp will make the Hitmontop user think twice about switching it in, as Bisharp also has access to Defiant. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Cresselia, Jirachi, and Metagross, will also be able to completely stop Hitmontop in its tracks, whilst usually 2HKOing in return. Ghost-types with Will-O-Wisp, Dusclops and Jellicent, can prove to be a living hell for Hitmontop, as there is no way Hitmontop can touch them. The presence of Ghost- and Psychic-types alone will usually allow said Pokemon to take advantage of the team spot that is now filled with dead weight.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Utility",
        "description": "<p>When it comes to shutting down physical attackers in Doubles, Hitmontop is one of the best due to its access to the notorious combination of Intimidate and Fake Out. This moveset allows Hitmontop to effectively utilize its access to Intimidate, Fake Out, and Close Combat to the fullest extent. Thanks to the Fighting Gem, Close Combat will be hitting hard, even off of Hitmontop's below average base 95 Attack stat. Feint is useful for breaking the ever so common Protect, allowing Hitmontop's partner to snipe down the cowardly Pokemon. Sucker Punch is a good alternate option, as it lets Hitmontop pick off weakened threats; it also forms the extremely effective Fighting + Dark coverage along with Close Combat, and is especially useful for hitting Latios and Latias hard. In the last spot, Wide Guard is usually the preferred option, as it lets Hitmontop create protect itself and its teammate from Blizzards, Rock Slides and Surfs. Teammates weak to these common spread moves love the support it can provide; however, if you don't feel comfortable with Wide Guard or if your team isn't weak to spread moves at all, Detect is a great option. Detect is used over Protect because it stops Hitmontop from being hampered by the combination of Protect + Imprison.</p> <p>The EVs allow Hitmontop to outspeed standard Rotom-W whilst optimizing its attacking prowess. The rest of its EVs are invested into HP to utilize its decent bulk and access to Intimidate. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe could be used to completely optimize Hitmontop's bulk, but missing out on Rotom-W and things slower than it is usually not worth the extra bulk. If you want Hitmontop to last longer, Sitrus Berry is a viable option, but Hitmontop loves to fire off a powerful first hit, making Fighting Gem the better option.</p> <p>Almost any Pokemon can use the massive support that comes from Intimidate and Fake Out, making Hitmontop really easy to fit on a lot of teams. A noteworthy partner that works wonders alongside Hitmontop is Quiver Dance Volcarona; the combination of Fake Out and Wide Guard will help shield Volcarona from its despised spread weaknesses to Rock Slide and Surf.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set lets Hitmontop survive hits that would otherwise OHKO a more offensive variant. You will often see Hitmontop switch in many times in a match and immobilize the opposition for at least a turn, aiming to provide as many free turns as possible for a teammate to dish out damage or set up with moves such as Trick Room, Tailwind, or even Quiver Dance, in Volcarona's case. Fake Out and Close Combat are obligatory, as they prevent the foe from moving for a turn and dish out heavy damage respectively. When it comes to choosing between Feint and Helping Hand, you really should consider what fits your team best. Feint is a great option if you have problems with offensive Pokemon that like to use Protect, as it can expose unsuspecting victims, such as Deoxys-A, that feel they're safe behind a Protect. Helping Hand is awesome for Pokemon that like to use spread moves, as it easily patches up the 25% power drop, even boosting the moves past their normal base power.</p> <p>With the given spread, Hitmontop will be able to take both Psyshock and Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor from Latios, whilst healing a portion of its health back up with the Sitrus Berry. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack to hit things harder with Close Combat. You could alternatively try shifting the EVs from Attack to Special Defense, just to have overall better bulk after Intimidate. This new spread would be 252 HP / 64 Def / 192 SpD; however, the extra attack could prove useful against Pokemon weak to Close Combat, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Terrakion.</p> <p>As this set revolves more around supporting teammates, Hitmontop is now the optimal Volcarona partner if Hitmontop has Helping Hand, as Volcarona can do tons of damage with Helping Hand-boosted +1 STAB Heat Wave. This Hitmontop also pairs extremely well with Substitute + Protect Heatran, as Hitmontop can block incoming Earthquakes with Wide Guard whilst using Fake Out to create a free turn to set up a Substitute. Other than that, Hitmontop generally supports almost any Pokemon extremely well, especially with its newfound bulk.</p> "

  "Blaziken": {
    "overview": "<p>Blaziken enters the Doubles tier as a Pokemon that can wreak havoc. With a great Attack stat along with great STAB coverage further boosted by weather, Blaziken hits very hard. However, what really makes it worth using is its ability, Speed Boost. This boosts its lackluster Speed to high levels, nearly outpacing the entire unboosted metagame, making Blaziken a relatively threatening Pokemon in Doubles. It also threatens common Pokemon such as Metagross, Scizor, and Tyranitar, the last of which being incredibly notable, as it is a huge detriment for many sun teams, a common archetype Blaziken is found on.</p> <p>However, not all is well for Blaziken in Doubles. While it can hit hard in the sun, the ever-present Politoed and Tyranitar easily replace sun with their own respective weathers, limiting Blaziken's attacking power. Despite their high Base Power, Blaziken's Fighting-type STAB moves, Hi Jump Kick and Superpower, also both have terrible drawbacks that make them inconsistent, especially Hi Jump Kick. Blaziken is also burdened by its rather mediocre bulk, which is only compounded by its weakness to common spread moves, such as Earthquake and Surf. The abundance of speed control in Doubles also greatly limits its potential, as Blaziken relies on its high Speed to be effective. Trick Room in particular can easily turn the tables on Blaziken. Doubles is also filled with many bulky threats, such as Cresselia, Hitmontop, and Thundurus, that can take a hit and severely cripple Blaziken. In addition, it faces competition from Pokemon such as Heatran for a teamslot as a Fire-type Pokemon. Overall, despite Blaziken's amazing power and speed, the prevalence of Tyranitar and Politoed, speed control, and bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia and Hitmontop greatly limit Blaziken's potential in Doubles.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Lum Berry is a decent alternative over Life Orb, as it can cure the paralysis that Blaziken abhors. Lum Berry can also be used in conjunction with a teammate using the move Swagger as a way to give Blaziken a free attack boost. Choice Band boosts Blaziken's power through the roof, but this set can easily be outsped and revenge killed by the myriad of Pokemon utilizing a Choice Scarf, or even a faster Pokemon, as Blaziken cannot use Protect to get a free boost to its Speed. Blaziken can choose to run Swords Dance to greatly increase its power, but will be hard-pressed to set up a Swords Dance thanks to its pitiful bulk. Blaziken can utilize Acrobatics in conjunction with Flying Gem, but using this combination does not do anything notable that a Life Orb-boosted Brave Bird cannot. Hidden Power Ice can be used to OHKO Landorus-T and Garchomp, both of which can live a hit from Blaziken and OHKO it with a STAB super effective Earthquake. On a similar note, a specially based or mixed set utilizing moves such as Heat Wave, Focus Blast, Hidden Power Ice, Fire Blast, and Solar Beam can be used, though it is outclassed by physically attacking variants. While Earthquake provides redundant coverage, it is a decently powerful spread move that hits Chandelure and Victini. Shadow Claw can be used to hit Latias, Latios, Jellicent, Slowking, Victini, and Chandelure, all of which resist Blaziken's dual STAB, for super effective damage. However, it lacks power and is only slightly more powerful than a resisted sun-boosted Flare Blitz. Sunny Day allows Blaziken to control the weather on its own, but Blaziken is too frail to use this move effectively and is generally better off attacking. Blaze Kick is an alternative Fire-type STAB that allows Blaziken to stay on the battlefield significantly longer, but it is extremely weak, having only slightly more than 2/3 of Flare Blitz's Base Power. While Feint and Baton Pass seem appealing, they are unfortunately illegal with Speed Boost.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best way to deal with Blaziken is by changing the weather, as it relies heavily on the sun to be effective. Politoed is an excellent option for this, as apart from the rare Fighting Gem-boosted Superpower, it is not OHKOed by anything Blaziken uses against it and can OHKO with a rain-boosted Scald. Outside of changing the weather, Jellicent is arguably the best option to deal with Blaziken, as it can easily stomach any move and proceed to hit Blaziken hard with a STAB Water Spout or Scald. Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Gyarados, Salamence, and Landorus-T, can give Blaziken trouble as they lower Blaziken's attacking power, with the former two resisting its STABs and the last hitting Blaziken hard with a super effective Earthquake. Latias and Latios, despite their poor physical bulk, are not OHKOed by anything Blaziken can use and can OHKO back with either Draco Meteor or Psyshock. Suicune, with its massive physical bulk, can stomach any hit from Blaziken and OHKO back with its Water-type STAB move of choice. Feint users can break Blaziken's invulnerability from Protect, allowing the Feint user's teammate to KO. It also allows Kingdra and Excadrill to eliminate a +2 Blaziken that is using Protect to become faster than them in their respective weather the following turn. Trick Room is a strategy that hurts Blaziken a lot, as it relies on its Speed to destroy the opponent's Pokemon, especially seeing that common Trick Room setters such as Jellicent, Slowking, Chandelure, and Cresselia already give it trouble regardless. While Thundurus is OHKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Flare Blitz and Stone Edge, it can cripple Blaziken with a priority Thunder Wave, rendering it nearly useless and open to an OHKO from Thundurus's teammate. On a similar note, Cresselia can take a hit and Thunder Wave Blaziken or hit it hard with STAB Psychic.</p> <p>While Blaziken is hard to revenge kill due to Speed Boost, it can still be outsped by certain Pokemon. The aforementioned Kingdra and Excadrill are two weather abusers that can outspeed Blaziken at +2 and OHKO. Keep in mind, though, that if Blaziken uses Protect, it will outspeed both Pokemon in the next turn at +3. Similarly, even after Blaziken has boosted its Speed once, Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W can still OHKO it, but will be outsped at +2. Hitmontop gets access to Intimidate, but it is 2HKOed by Flare Blitz regardless, making it a shaky check.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With its high-powered STAB moves, Blaziken can hit hard right off the bat and rip holes in the opponent's team. Flare Blitz is the primary STAB move and hits common threats such as Cresselia for a large amount of damage under the sun. However, Flare Blitz comes with a severe drawback of recoil and being weather-reliant, making it extremely inconsistent. Superpower is the recommended secondary STAB move and provides decent coverage with Flare Blitz, hitting Pokemon such as Terrakion and Tyranitar for super effective damage. Hi Jump Kick can also be used, as it hits harder than Superpower and does not lower Blaziken's stats, but the high use of Protect in Doubles makes it ineffective in most situations. Stone Edge is the recommended option in the third slot, as it hits Pokemon such as Victini, Chandelure, and Thundurus. However, Brave Bird is also an option, as it hits Pokemon such as Latios, Volcarona, Hitmontop, and Jellicent harder than Flare Blitz outside of the sun. Protect is used to not only guarantee that Blaziken's Speed will be boosted, but also to avoid a potentially fatal attack.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is recommended for maximum power, having the added benefit of allowing Blaziken to Speed tie with Shaymin-S after a boost. Life Orb is the preferred item choice, as it boosts both of Blaziken's STAB moves unlike the Fire Gem. Fire Gem is also an option to further boost Flare Blitz's power, allowing Blaziken to always OHKO standard Landorus-T, factoring in sun and Intimidate. A Fighting Gem can boost the power of Superpower or Hi Jump Kick, guaranteeing an OHKO on 252 HP / 0 Def Politoed, as well as an OHKO on physically defensive variants with a Helping Hand boost which it could normally not do with a Life Orb. However, Blaziken's Fighting-type attacks have drawbacks far worse than that of Flare Blitz, making it an inferior item choice.</p> <p>As far as partners go, Sableye is one of the best, providing Fake Out support and making Blaziken a lot less reliant on Protect. It also provides Feint support and priority Sunny Day support, making it easier for Blaziken to rip holes in the foe's team. Hitmontop provides Fake Out support and can remedy Blaziken's weakness to spread moves such as Earthquake by using Wide Guard, but it stacks weaknesses and is generally redundant with Blaziken. Amoonguss can absorb Water-type moves for Blaziken by using Rage Powder while keeping Water-types in check with Giga Drain. However, it cannot redirect spread moves, such as Muddy Water and Surf. Cresselia makes for another great partner, as it can reverse Trick Room, a rather common strategy that gives Blaziken a lot of trouble. Cresselia can also set up Sunny Day reliably and use Helping Hand to give Blaziken a much-needed power boost that nabs KOs on bulkier threats, such as Garchomp, that would otherwise be able to survive Blaziken's attacks although it still will not OHKO Pokemon such as Cresselia. Pokemon with access to Taunt prevent the opponent's Pokemon from using Tailwind or Trick Room. Defiant Tornadus in particular is an excellent option as it is faster than most Pokemon utilizing those moves and discourages Pokemon with Intimidate that would normally come in on Blaziken from switching in. The aforementioned Sableye, as well as Thundurus, are also great options due to their access to priority Taunt. Ninetales makes for a decent partner as it can provide sun, powering up Blaziken's main Fire-type STAB. However, it stacks up Water- and Ground-type weakness and lacks any utility outside of setting up sun.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Infernape has the role of a Fake Out-using mixed attacker with a somewhat unique typing. However, it faces competition from Scrafty, Hariyama, and Hitmontop as a Fighting-type that utilizes Fake Out. In addition, it faces competition from Blaziken, which has superior mixed offenses, Speed Boost, and the same typing. It also has common weaknesses in Ground- and Water-type moves, which are present in the form of the ever-so-common Earthquake and Muddy Water. Infernape can still hold its own in Doubles, though; it can deal with common Pokemon such as Abomasnow and Tyranitar and separates itself from said competitors with a faster Fake Out, higher base Speed, and ability to go mixed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A special set with Focus Blast and Fire Blast as STAB options is viable, but these moves are inaccurate and unreliable. Mach Punch is a priority move that allows Infernape to revenge kill threats such as Darkrai and Weavile, but Infernape is usually fast enough to KO the threats it needs to. Hidden Power Ice lets Infernape 2HKO (OHKO if holding a Life Orb) Landorus-T, a major threat to it. Stone Edge can be used to hit Salamence and Gyarados decently hard, as well as to provide a move that OHKOes Volcarona. Helping Hand lets Infernape support its teammates by increasing their damage output for one turn, but Infernape is better off attacking. U-turn can be used on the set to gain momentum. Endeavor is a gimmicky option which can be effective in conjunction with Focus Sash.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Infernape is not very strong, thus any relatively bulky Pokemon can check it. Cresselia and Landorus-T are prime examples of bulky Pokemon that aren't weak to any of its attacks and can OHKO in return. Bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent, Gyarados, and Gastrodon, are problematic for Infernape, as they resist its Fire-type STAB moves—Gyarados and Jellicent resist and are immune to Fighting, respectively—and aren't hit hard by its coverage moves either. Chandelure completely walls Infernape lacking Rock Slide, Stone Edge, and Earthquake, and can hit it hard with a STAB Shadow Ball. Politoed can change the weather and dampen Infernape's Fire-type moves, making it an effective counter. Intimidate users, such as the previously mentioned Gyarados and Landorus-T, as well as Hitmontop and Salamence, can greatly hinder Infernape, as most of its attacks are physically oriented. Latias and Latios wall Infernape's STAB moves and can OHKO it with Psyshock. Trick Room and Tailwind both mean that the opponent will usually move before Infernape, taking away its greatest asset, its Speed. Swift Swim sweepers and Excadrill under their respective weathers can easily OHKO Infernape; they should do so after its Focus Sash is broken, however, as it can do good damage to them in return. Even if Infernape has its Focus Sash, though, Excadrill can bring it down to 1 HP, and then Infernape gets KOed by sand damage. Lastly, faster Pokemon that OHKO Infernape, such as Tornadus, Shaymin-S, and Deoxys-A, can check it.</p> ",

Fake Out gives room for building a better setup for your team, and is especially effective since Infernape is faster than most users of said move (hence foiling their attempts to use it). Overheat lets Infernape OHKO Metagross with the given EVs, but Heat Wave is a fine alternative with the added benefit of being a spread move; it is considerably weaker, though. Close Combat is its Fighting-type move of choice and lets it hit most Pokemon that can easily stomach its Fire STAB moves, such as Tyranitar and Heatran, for good damage. Feint is the main option in the last slot, and can catch an opposing Pokemon that expects Fake Out off guard. Taunt and Protect are fine alternatives; the former lets Infernape be a nuisance for Trick Room setters, and the latter eases prediction in situations where you are not sure about the opponent's actions.</p> <p>The given spread allows Infernape to OHKO Metagross and Occa Berry Scizor with Overheat. Focus Sash is the item of choice, as it has good synergy with Blaze. Life Orb can be used for the extra power, but Infernape really needs the safety blanket provided by Focus Sash, and a Blaze-boosted Overheat hits harder than one that is boosted by Life Orb. Fire Blast can be used in Overheat's place as a STAB Fire-type move, but unfortunately it misses out on the OHKO on Metagross and Occa Berry Scizor without virtually maximizing its Special Attack; Flare Blitz is in the same boat, and also KOes Infernape due to recoil after its Focus Sash has been activated. Encore lets Infernape screw over threats that have just used Protect, but has little use otherwise. Grass Knot slams Jellicent and Gastrodon hard, but still doesn't do much damage to the former and the latter is hit hard enough by Close Combat. Sunny Day is helpful to get rid of hail and sand, which break Infernape's Focus Sash, and in addition, boosts Overheat's power; Ninetales and Cresselia are two prominent sun setters that work well. A lot of Pokemon that appreciate Fake Out support, such as Spore users and Thundurus, make for good partners. Wallbreakers that appreciate Feint support include Deoxys-A, Thundurus-T, and Latios; said wallbreakers make for good partners for this reason. Pokemon that deal with Trick Room, such as Amoonguss, are appreciated, as Infernape will most likely be outsped under Trick Room, which makes it prone to being OHKOed.</p> "

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>Togekiss is one of the best support Pokemon in the Doubles metagame. It has one of the largest array of support moves in its arsenal, including the unique combination of Follow Me and Tailwind. Togekiss's bulk is awesome, and it happens to be one of the most specially bulky users of Follow Me and Rage Powder. It's no slouch in the offensive department either, with a whopping base 120 Special Attack. Its typing is queer, having the ability to evade the common Earthquake. However, this renders it vulnerable to other common moves such as Blizzard and Rock Slide. Nonetheless, Togekiss is an extremely versatile Pokemon and should definitely be considered for a slot on your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Roost is a great option to heal yourself when necessary. Body Slam is also a great option for spreading paralysis as it bypasses Taunt. Togekiss can also run an interesting support set with dual screens, but is outclassed by Pokemon such as Cresselia in this regard. Tri Attack is usable for spreading debilitating status effects onto your opponent. Hyper Voice is Togekiss's strongest spread move and benefits from STAB, but its poor coverage is disappointing. ExtremeSpeed can catch opponents off guard, but has a poor damage output and thus is a waste of a moveslot. After You is an interesting option for speeding up your team, but has major limitations that prevent it from being effective. Togekiss can also function as a weather inducer with Sunny Day or Rain Dance, but the above sets are better. Togekiss also has other interesting moves such as Magic Coat, Encore, and Safeguard, but these function on a case-by-case basis.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Togekiss is weak to Blizzard and Discharge, and due to these moves being common in Doubles, Togekiss might have trouble finding turns to set up. Blizzard users include Abomasnow, Kyurem, and Rotom-F, while Discharge users include Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Thundurus. Taunt users that outspeed Togekiss, including Prankster users, can prevent Togekiss from using its support moves and render it helpless, barring the moderately powerful Air Slash. Rock Slide is also a threat to Togekiss, and thus it has to beware of users such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Excadrill. Togekiss, like any other Tailwind user, is quite vulnerable to Trick Room, and thus steps should be taken to prevent it from being set on the field.</p> <p>Common Electric Pokemon such as Zapdos are thorns in Togekiss's side, but might not necessarily OHKO it, allowing Togekiss to unleash a Tailwind or Thunder Wave before death. Rain-boosted Swift Swim users such as Kabutops can also outspeed Togekiss and deal heavy damage, and Sand Rush-boosted Excadrill can do the same. Steel-types are checks to Togekiss as they can handle Air Slash with ease, but are usually unable to stop Togekiss from playing its support role.</p> ",

        "name": "Tailwind Support",
        "description": "<p>This set invests in bulk in order to maximize sustainability for Togekiss, permitting it to set up multiple Tailwinds throughout the match. Tailwind is an obvious option to double the Speed of all your teammates for three turns, granting a tactical advantage that has been the staple of many Doubles cores. Air Slash is an option to deal with slower and bulkier threats, such as Cresselia, while your sweepers wreak havoc on the other opponent. It also boasts a 60% chance to flinch opponents, rendering them motionless for that turn. Follow Me is a great option to grant setup opportunities for your teammate, as it lures all the opponents' attacks onto Togekiss's giant bulk and keeps your teammate safe. Protect is a classic option in Doubles to defend Togekiss from attacks, possibly leaving your teammate free to attack the opponent or to shield it from multi-hit moves. Helping Hand is a wonderful option to grant a 50% power boost to your teammate, allowing it to deliver powerful blows to the opponents.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Togekiss to outspeed Cresselia, minimum Speed Rotom-W, and some faster Hitmontop variants. 248 HP EVs are used so Togekiss can attain an odd HP number to receive less damage from hail and sandstorm. The rest of the EVs are put into its already stellar Special Defense as an extra boost. 176 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed maximum Speed neutral base 70s, specifically Hitmontop and Ludicolo. 16 Defense EVs can be given to allow Togekiss to survive a Choice Band- or Helping Hand-boosted Rock Slide from Tyranitar. A Sitrus Berry is given instead of Leftovers as it is more useful in sand and hail, being able to restore 25% of Togekiss's health instead of being nullified by weather. Additionally, it is more helpful in allowing Togekiss to tank two attacks in a turn.</p> <p>Togekiss usually aids teammates instead of having teammates aid it; it works well with powerful teammates with middling Speed such as Kyurem-B, Hydreigon, Breloom, Metagross, and more. Mold Breaker Excadrill is a great partner for Togekiss, with Follow Me to allow a Swords Dance boost; it can also use Earthquake freely, as Togekiss is immune to Ground-type attacks. Hitmontop is also a good partner thanks to Intimidate, helping to cover Togekiss's weaker Defense while providing Wide Guard support to protect Togekiss from Blizzards, Rock Slides and Discharges. Heracross and Mamoswine are also decent partners, having good synergy with Togekiss and appreciating Tailwind support. Heracross can defeat the Rock- and Ice-types that threaten Togekiss, while Mamoswine handles Electric- and Ice-types. Landorus-T can also be used, but has to beware of Blizzard.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Paralyzer",
        "description": "<p>This Togekiss set works wonderfully on bulky offense teams due to its ability to Thunder Wave a majority of the opponents and slow them down for your sweepers. Air Slash is a great move in combination with Thunder Wave, granting the paraflinch combo. Not to mention Togekiss also has Serene Grace, being able to double the rate of flinching from Air Slash and therefore being able to keep the opponent immobile for longer. Follow Me is Togekiss's advantage over other Thunder Wave users such as Thundurus—the ability to lure attacks aimed at your partner and tank them with great special bulk is a huge selling point. Protect, as usual, is to defend Togekiss from attacks that are aimed at it. Helping Hand is a great move to give your partner a 50% power boost, allowing it to annihilate the already paralyzed opponents.</p> <p>The EVs are specially tailored to allow Togekiss to survive a multitude of powerful attacks, namely Rock Gem Terrakion's Rock Slide, Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor, Thundurus's Thunderbolt, and Choice Specs Rotom-W's Thunderbolt. The HP EVs are given an odd number in order to reduce damage taken from sandstorm and hail. A Sitrus Berry is used to grant greater longevity, helping Togekiss take two attacks in one turn and is overall more useful than Leftovers in this metagame.</p> <p>Togekiss works great with bulky offensive Pokemon that benefit from opponents getting paralyzed, allowing them to go first and wreak havoc. These Pokemon include Metagross, Landorus-T, Heatran, and Kyurem-B. Hitmontop is once again a good partner with Intimidate to cover Togekiss's weaker Defense and can also use Wide Guard to protect Togekiss from the likes of Rock Slide, Blizzard, and Discharge.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Togekiss isn't only meant to function defensively; it can also go offensive thanks to its useful base 120 Special Attack. Tailwind is on the set in order to increase the Speed of the whole team, while Air Slash is for a reliable STAB and helpful flinches. Heat Wave is a good Fire-type move that can hit both opponents for decent damage and has a nice 30% chance to burn them. Aura Sphere is another reliable option to induce solid Fighting-type damage onto the opponent. Protect is useful in this instance to stall out Trick Room turns, while Helping Hand is good for boosting allies, especially when Togekiss's coverage is ineffective in that particular situation.</p> <p>208 HP EVs are used to give Togekiss an odd HP number to reduce damage from sandstorm and hail. 48 Speed EVs are given to allow Togekiss to outspeed 4 Speed base 85s, most notably Cresselia. Sitrus Berry is given to grant Togekiss greater longevity and to take more hits, while Flying Gem can give Togekiss a cool one-time damage boost. Fire Blast or Flamethrower can be used instead of Heat Wave for greater damage on individual opponents.</p> <p>Good teammates should have good coverage in tandem with Togekiss so they can take out bulkier opponents such as Cresselia. Tyranitar and Chandelure are good choices in this regard, and also benefit from Tailwind. Mamoswine and Heracross are also good partners—Mamoswine has good coverage and enjoys the flinches that Togekiss deals onto the opponent, while Heracross enjoys the Helping Hand support which permits it to OHKO Cresselia, and also beats the Ice- and Rock-types that trouble Togekiss. Hitmontop's Intimidate comes in handy to cover up Togekiss's weaker Defense, and its Wide Guard support grants protection against Blizzard, Rock Slide, and Discharge.</p> "

  "Chandelure": {
    "overview": "<p>Chandelure is a bit of an oddball in Doubles; it's not particularly fast or bulky, which are two important traits that make Pokemon stand out. However, its saving graces come from its astounding base 145 Special Attack and access to the rather exclusive Trick Room, as well as an immunity to Fake Out, which helps its setup, adding up to an odd yet effective combination of offense and support. It has a great ability in Flash Fire, granting it another immunity. Chandelure can also utilize the combination of Imprison and Trick Room, effectively shutting down any opposing Trick Room setters. However, it does suffer from common weaknesses from moves such as Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Scald, as well as the high usage of Tyranitar, which can defeat Chandelure with its hands tied behind its back thanks to Sand Stream and its resistance to Chandelure's STABs. Not only this, but another popular weather, rain, puts quite a damper on Chandelure's effectiveness. Even if it does suffer from common weaknesses, not many other offensive Trick Room users can hold a candle to Chandelure, as it still manages to carve out a niche as one of the most effective offensive Trick Room users in the game.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Chandelure has a number of other options that it can use. Hidden Power Rock and Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Volcarona and Heatran, respectively. Heatran takes very little from Chandelure's STABs and commonly used coverage moves, so Chandelure can effectively lure in Heatran and OHKO with Hidden Power Ground. With sun support, SolarBeam can be used for more powerful coverage against Water-types. However, it should never be used outside of sun, and is shaky even with sun support due to the constant weather changes. Will-O-Wisp can be used to burn and cripple opposing physical attackers, but Chandelure is often outpaced and OHKOed by prominent physical threats, especially without team support, due to the prevalence of moves such as Earthquake and Rock Slide. Flame Charge is an interesting option for a way to boost Chandelure's Speed, but it is outclassed in this manner, notably by Volcarona, which sports a much better boosting move. Pain Split allows for a semi-reliable way to regain health, but Chandelure really isn't very bulky anyway and a misprediction can easily spell doom. Substitute can act as a buffer from revenge killing, but Chandelure often does not have space for it.</p> <p>A Life Orb set is viable, providing a lot of power while retaining the ability to switch moves. Again, the loss of HP is not very noticeable, considering the fact that Chandelure is OHKOed by most powerful moves regardless. Choice Specs allows Chandelure to act as a nuke, although the set lacks Speed and is easily revenge killed. An alternative EV spread of 240 HP / 44 SpA / 224 SpD with a Calm or Sassy nature can be used as a much more bulky set, allowing it to live a Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor from Latios or a Shadow Ball from opposing Chandelure at full health while still retaining the ability to strike back hard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Tyranitar is one of the best counters to Chandelure, taking little from Chandelure's STAB attacks, while being able to easily OHKO in return with Crunch or Rock Slide. Heatran also takes very little from Chandelure's commonly used moves, and is able to 2HKO back with Earth Power, but it must be wary of the rare Hidden Power Ground, which will OHKO it unless it's running significant bulk investment. Heatran can also easily set up a Substitute on any of Chandelure's commonly carried moves. Politoed is also a good counter, as it not only takes Chandelure's attacks well, but also brings rain, limiting Chandelure's offensive presence, and can do a lot of damage even with an unboosted Water-type move. Most Water-types have little to fear, as Energy Ball often does not have enough power and is not too commonly seen regardless. Swampert receives a special mention as it also gets Wide Guard, stopping one of Chandelure's primary STAB moves. As for checks, Scrafty is a good one, with its great Special Defense and Dark-type STAB moves. Landorus-T can switch in on any move other than Hidden Power Ice and OHKO back with a powerful Earthquake. Hydreigon is also a great check, resisting all of Chandelure's commonly used moves bar Hidden Power Ice and easily OHKOing back with Dark Pulse. Chandelure has a very low base HP stat and its defenses are nothing special either, so even powerful neutral attacks are able to OHKO.</p> <p>If your team is weak to Trick Room, Chandelure should be a top priority threat. As Fake Out cannot be used to stop it from setting Trick Room, Taunt and Imprison are some of the few viable ways to stop it from setting up. For example, Thundurus has a fast Taunt and numerous other supporting moves. However, Taunt (and Imprison) users must be wary of a powerful Fire Gem-boosted Overheat. While not very bulky, Trick Room Chandelure often carries a Focus Sash, so simply double targeting it can quickly dispatch of it before Trick Room can be set up.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Offensive Trick Room",
        "description": "<p>Chandelure doesn't have much use for coverage moves, which serves this set perfectly as it allows Chandelure to make room for Trick Room and the ever-useful Protect while still hitting common Pokemon such as Cresselia and Scizor for super effective damage. Heat Wave is a spread move and receives a STAB boost, allowing it to deal respectable damage to two Pokemon at once. Shadow Ball is slightly less powerful in terms of net damage, but is still more accurate, does slightly more damage to the target Pokemon, and is capable of 2HKOing Cresselia.</p> <p>This variant of Chandelure isn't the kind of Trick Room setter that comes in at the beginning of the game with the sole purpose of setting Trick Room; instead, it's the Pokemon that you bring in when it can be an offensive threat against the opponent. The opponent is put in a bad position, being forced to guess between an attack and Trick Room, while Chandelure can basically do whatever it wants, especially if the Focus Sash is still intact.</p> <p>Focus Sash is used to set up Trick Room more consistently, especially when considering Chandelure's rather common weaknesses, and Chandelure has a high enough Special Attack to deal consistent damage without a boost. If you really want some firepower though, look no farther than a Fire Gem-boosted Overheat. Thanks to a Gem boost, Overheat is capable of OHKOing even the bulkiest of Thundurus, and if you can manage to back it with a Helping Hand boost as well, it can OHKO specially defensive Musharna, Togekiss, and even 4/0 Garchomp. Fire Gem doesn't net any special KOs with Heat Wave, however, so when using Heat Wave, it's best to stick with Focus Sash.</p> <p>Flame Body might be appealing to burn Tyranitar and the like, but it's important to remember that such Pokemon can just as easily use Rock Slide or other non-contact moves. This renders Flame Body useless most of the time, making Flash Fire's immunity and potential power boost more worthwhile. If you're using Chandelure for anti-Trick Room, you might want to consider Imprison over Protect or Shadow Ball, which is the most consistent anti-Trick Room method out there, albeit highly specialized and possibly useless against any team that doesn't rely on Trick Room.</p> <p>The EVs are distributed mainly in HP and Special Attack mainly because Chandelure doesn't have much to do with the remaining 252 EVs. 240 HP minimizes sandstorm and hail damage while the remainder is dumped into Defense. If you're worried about Genesect getting a free Special Attack boost against Chandelure, you can allocate the Defense EVs into Special Defense, though you'll have to decide what kind of attack you're most scared of; a +1 U-turn or a +1 special attack. Chandelure's Speed is minimized to take full advantage of Trick Room, though if you're building a semi-Trick Room team, you can afford to make your Chandelure faster. A spread that achieves this is Modest, and utilizes 44 Speed EVs to overtake Cresselia and tie with Rotom-W, which is useful to deliver the final blow or deal a nice of chunk damage; a set with Modest with 8 Speed IVs can also be used, as it outspeeds neutral-natured Scrafty outside of Trick Room and neutral-natured base 70s such as Metagross in Trick Room, as well as other Trick Room Chandelure that opt for a Quiet nature. Outspeeding these Pokemon outside of Trick Room is especially important if you're using Fire Gem Overheat, as many Pokemon around the base 60 Speed region are in danger of being OHKOed or 2HKOed by either Overheat or Shadow Ball.</p> <p>As always, in order to set up Trick Room, you need support in the form of Fake Out or Follow Me. Amoonguss and Hariyama are two prime examples, as they not only apply pressure under Trick Room, but are also capable of patching up Chandelure's weaknesses with their opportune typing or Wide Guard. Hariyama also acts as a fantastic counter to Tyranitar, one of Chandelure's biggest counters. Scrafty and Hitmontop aren't as offensive as Hariyama, but they sport Intimidate and better overall bulk, which helps to take down Tyranitar. Other Pokemon that can make use of the twisted dimensions are obviously great partners for Trick Room Chandelure. Abomasnow breaks Chandelure's Focus Sash with its hail, but offers great offensive synergy with Blizzard and can bait Fire-type moves, allowing Chandelure to grab a free Flash Fire boost. Snow Warning also removes Drizzle's effect, making Abomasnow a nice anti-rain Pokemon to use alongside Chandelure.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>This set goes in the complete opposite direction of the Trick Room set as it aims to outspeed threats with Choice Scarf rather than underspeed them with Trick Room. This set excels at taking down Pokemon such as Latios, Garchomp, Shaymin-S, and Metagross. Heat Wave is a standard STAB move, providing spread damage with a decent Base Power. Shadow Ball is a good complementary STAB move, providing great neutral coverage and super effective damage on prominent threats such as Cresselia and Latios. Hidden Power Ice is the suggested move in the third slot, allowing Chandelure to combat Pokemon with notable Ice-type weaknesses, such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Energy Ball is a viable alternative, providing Chandelure with a way to hit bulky Water-types, notably Gastrodon and Rotom-W. However, while its coverage is acceptable, its relatively low Base Power means that even super effective hits often will not OHKO. Overheat can be used in the last slot for a single powerful attack, but forces Chandelure to switch out, while Trick is used to cripple defensive checks.</p> <p>Timid allows Chandelure to surpass Shaymin-S as well as well as any Pokemon with less than 213 Speed under Tailwind. A Modest nature can be used for the extra power it provides, while still letting Chandelure outspeed Weavile and tie with Shaymin-S. Flash Fire is the preferred ability as it allows Chandelure to switch into Fire-type attacks freely while simultaneously boosting its own. Flame Body is a viable alternative, although Chandelure is often targeted by non-contact moves, such as Rock Slide and Earthquake. Furthermore, Flash Fire has more general utility, allowing Chandelure to switch in with much more ease.</p> <p>While already supported by a strong base 145 Special Attack, Chandelure enjoys team support in the form of Helping Hand from Pokemon such as Cresselia. As Chandelure is weak to three of the most common spread moves, Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Muddy Water, Wide Guard support is also appreciated. Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Hariyama are ideal for this role, as they can also provide Fake Out, effectively protecting Chandelure while leaving it free to attack. Sun support is also favorable, making Heat Wave a much more potent spread move. Sableye is notable for this role, as it not only has access to a priority Sunny Day, but also a priority Will-O-Wisp, allowing it to manually trigger Chandelure's Flash Fire.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Volcarona has one of the best offensive typings in the Doubles metagame. Its STAB attacks hit everything from Cresselia to Bisharp for super effective damage, and it even gains useful resistances to Ice- and Fighting-type moves. To make life even better, it has a massive Special Attack stat, alongside a solid base Speed. It even gets additional support options in Tailwind and Rage Powder. To top it all off, it is one of the few Pokemon capable of making use of setup moves in Doubles, which it does through Quiver Dance.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even a fire-spewing moth has its faults. It is held back in that it has a mediocre Defense and a 4x weakness to Rock-type moves, leaving it susceptible to Rock Slide. Furthermore, a Water weakness leaves it begging for mercy against the majority of rain teams. It also has little coverage outside of its STABs. Fortunately, this rare species of \"Volcano Moth\" is far from extinct, as its lethal STAB combination is capable of taking down many common Doubles threats, including Cresselia, Breloom, Scizor, Hydreigon, and others.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fire Blast and Fiery Dance can be alternate Fire STABs, as they pack more power than Heat Wave at the cost of only being able to hit one target at a time and do not have a Special Attack drop like Overheat. Hidden Power Ground can achieve coverage against Heatran and anything else Volcarona struggles to hit; however, it is lacking in power and requires giving up a moveslot. Hurricane and Psychic can be used, taking out Hitmontop and other Fighting-types, but they are generally inferior to a Fire Gem boosted Overheat, which deals more damage. Giga Drain damages Politoed and can heal Volcarona, extending its longevity. Magnet Rise can surprise the opposition with a Ground-type immunity, but it is generally outclassed by Volcarona's support options in Tailwind and Rage Powder. Finally, Sunny Day can be used to mess with weather and buff Volcarona's Fire-type STAB to incredibly powerful levels, and SolarBeam can be used alongside it, hitting Rock- and Water-type Pokemon for heavy damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Heatran is more or less the ultimate Volcarona counter; bar the rare Hidden Power Ground, it walls every Volcarona in and out offensively. Heatran can easily hammer Volcarona back with Heat Wave, and Substitute Heatran can set up in Volcarona's face, making it even more difficult to take down. Chandelure is also a wonderful counter to Volcarona and can do what Heatran does by walling it and hammering it with repeated Heat Waves or setting Trick Room without fear of Volcarona's attacks.</p> <p>Faster physical attackers, such as Terrakion, Landorus, Excadrill, and Garchomp, can move first and OHKO Volcarona with Rock Slide. Volcarona can do little back to most of these, but if it has a Quiver Dance up, it can outspeed and deal heavy damage, so be cautious. Excadrill gets a special mention, as Volcarona will need two Quiver Dance boosts to beat it. One rare potential check is Stone Edge Hitmontop, which could trick Volcarona into thinking it is not an offensive problem. It is utterly destroyed by a Fire Gem Overheat though, so it needs to be played with caution. Rain in general will also give Volcarona trouble. Swift Swim Pokemon, particularly Kabutops and Kingdra, can run right through it with their respective STABs and can tank an unboosted Bug Buzz. Volcarona additionally hates opposing speed control; in particular, Thunder Wave and Trick Room will cripple it. Once it is slowed, a variety of slow threats can pick it off.</p> ",

Most notably, it can outspeed and redirect Hitmontop's Fake Out, even having a 30% chance to burn with Flame Body. It also forces Latios to Draco Meteor, isn't Taunt bait in front of Thundurus, and safely redirects Substitute Kyurem-B, Scizor, Cresselia, and Conkeldurr. However it is destroyed by rain teams, and Stealth Rock often forces it to be kind of a suicide lead.</p> <p>Overheat OHKOes most Fire-weak Pokemon even without investment such as Metagross and does solid damage to frail neutral targets. Tailwind is a good greed option, but Bug Buzz is safer for solid damage against Water-types, Latios, and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Sitrus Berry gives Volcarona extra longevity. The EV spread outspeeds Hitmontop and survives Latios's Gem Draco Meteor while maximizing physical bulk for redirecting Fighting- and Steel-types. Volcarona needs Modest nature and near maximum investment to OHKO Amoonguss with Overheat, which generally isn't worth it, but could be. You can also run 252 SpA with Modest Fire Gem for a solid chance to OHKO Thundurus with Overheat, but the loss of bulk will be even more notable.</p> <p>This set pairs well with fast and heavy-hitting Pokemon that have good defensive synergy with Volcarona such as Latios, as Volcarona draws in attacks and paralysis, allowing its teammates to live longer. Anything that can get past Heatran, such as Garchomp, Landorus, Breloom, and Gastrodon, is also very helpful, as Volcarona has a lot of trouble with it.</p> "

Bug Buzz is Volcarona's most powerful secondary STAB, dealing heavy damage to threats like Hydreigon and Cresselia. Protect allows Volcarona to evade dangerous attacks while your partner handles things.</p> <p>Modest Life Orb is needed to OHKO Tyranitar and Cresselia with +1 Bug Buzz and Landorus-T with +1 Heat Wave, so that's generally the best item to avoid a revenge kill. Lum Berry allows Volcarona to avoid being crippled by paralysis, especially from Thundurus, but since Volcarona does not OHKO at +1 anyway, Lum Berry is not a matchup on its own. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Hydreigon at +0 and Jolly Scarf Landorus-T at +1 but Heat Wave becomes a shaky roll to OHKO Landorus-T.

Fast Pokemon such as Latios also help against other fast Pokemon packing Rock Slide, such as Garchomp and Terrakion. Weavile, in particular, is good alongside this set, as it has high Speed, can provide Fake Out support, and can nail a lot of counters, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Garchomp for heavy damage; watch out for Tyranitar with Chople Berry, though, because it can tank a Low Kick and get a double KO with Rock Slide. Breloom and Virizion can also make solid partners, using STAB moves to take out Rock-types and bulky Water-types, both of which give Volcarona trouble, along with archetypal rain and sand teams in general. Breloom can also help shut down troublesome threats with Spore.</p> "

  "Exeggutor": {
    "overview": "<p>Exeggutor stands out as the only Grass-type that can set up and also perform well in Trick Room, unlike Whimsicott and Celebi, which are too fast for Trick Room. The combination of Harvest, Sitrus Berry, and passable bulk with EV investment enables Exeggutor to withstand attacks from many Pokemon and passively heal them off. Exeggutor can also be used as a special attacker on Sunny Day teams, as it has the highest Special Attack out of a the Chlorophyll users, which can be utilized for sweeping under sunlight.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the positives end there. Exeggutor's horrid defensive typing leaves it vulnerable to a large list of common Pokemon (though this can be remedied to an extent by Sleep Powder). Many Pokemon resist its STABs, hindering Exeggutor's offensive potential. Chlorophyll sets are also dependent on sunlight to function, and sunlight is difficult to maintain in a metagame where sand, rain, and even hail are more common.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Giga Drain can be used for a Grass-type STAB move, but it is weak and cannot 2HKO Tyranitar, who will 2HKO back at worse. Exeggutor benefits little from Giga Drain's recovery when it already has extensive passive recovery with Sitrus Berry + Harvest. In addition, Hidden Power Ground, Low Kick, and Nature Power are coverage options against Steel-types. Low Kick also smacks Tyranitar hard. Nature Power becomes Earthquake and deals similar damage to Hidden Power Ground but targets every other Pokemon on the field. Power Swap can be used in tandem with Leaf Storm to pass Exeggutor's Special Attack drop to an opposing Pokemon, though it requires a moveslot, and the Special Attack drop can be offset by simply switching. Exeggutor set up Reflect and Light Screen, but Exeggutor has more important roles. This is better left to bulkier or faster Pokemon that can set up screens more reliably. Substitute sounds good in theory on a Pokemon who can easily restore HP passively and can set it up on a predicted double-Protect (which is used to stall out Trick Room), but it is not as impressive in practice; Exeggutor's Substitutes are easily broken, Exeggutor already has 4 moveslot syndrome, and it doesn't gel well with Leaf Storm's Special Attack drop.</p> <p>Exeggutor can use Harvest without Trick Room. The main issue with this is that Exeggutor's match-ups against Pokemon tend to be very one-sided; opposing Pokemon are generally either easily walled by Exeggutor, or easily counter or check Harvest Exeggutor. Depending on your opponent's team, if it has many Pokemon in the latter category (which is not uncommon), Exeggutor can be a liability. Trick Room fortunately generally ensures that Exeggutor will at least have some use, whereas Exeggutor otherwise has trouble achieving anything notable when it can do little to much of the opponent's team whilst taking major damage in return. Other bulky Grass-type, such as Amoonguss, and other offensive types such as Shaymin-S, are more likely to be useful against such teams. Finally Lum Berry and Rest can be combined with Harvest for status immunity and full HP recovery, but it is difficult to give up a moveslot for Rest, and Exeggutor might not find the time to use Rest.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As a general rule of thumb, any Pokemon with a STAB super effective move can break through Harvest Exeggutor, as such a move usually does enough damage to prevent Exeggutor from restoring enough HP with Harvest and Sitrus Berry to take two hits even if Exeggutor can take one hit. This list of Pokemon is surprisingly large. Scizor, Genesect, Hydreigon, Heatran, Bisharp, and Escavalier all laugh at Exeggutor's STAB moves and hit it back super effectively with their STABs. Be warned, however, that Hidden Power Fire can 2HKO or OHKO most Steel-types, with the notable exception of Heatran. Volcarona, Abomasnow, Shaymin-S, Salamence, and Tornadus also hit Exeggutor hard whilst resisting Exeggutor's most powerful move, Leaf Storm. Despite being weak to one of Exeggutor's STABs, Tyranitar and Heracross can take a STAB Leaf Storm and Psychic-type STAB of choice respectively, and hit hard with their STABs. Metagross is one of the few Pokemon that can outmuscle Exeggutor without super effective hits, thanks to shrugging off Exeggutor's STAB moves and gaining potential Attack boosts with Meteor Mash. Any Pokemon running U-turn will probably 2HKO Exeggutor; and Landorus-T has a guaranteed OHKO on Exeggutor with it. Jirachi can redirect Exeggutor's attacks with Follow Me and easily shrug them off with its typing and bulk, whilst its teammate takes out Exeggutor.</p> <p>All the Pokemon mentioned above can also check Chlorophyll Exeggutor and, as it lacks bulk, most of them will be able to OHKO Exeggutor. However, they will have to watch out for Sleep Powder and coverage moves such as Hidden Power. Note that the appropriate resistance Berry can enable them to withstand the appropriate coverage move. Exeggutor can be outrun and OHKOed by common Choice Scarf users, such as Genesect, Landorus-T, Tyranitar, and Terrakion with X-Scissor. Bisharp bypasses Exeggutor's Speed and with Sucker Punch, which OHKOes it. Removing sun from the field will make Exeggutor much easier to handle; low Speed combined with many weaknesses and weak Special Defense makes it prey for many Pokemon. Abomasnow is the best weather inducer for this job, as the others are either weak to Grass or set up sun themselves. By extension, Trick Room also renders Chlorophyll Exeggutor vulnerable. Regardless of its set, Exeggutor is walled by Cresselia, which can utilize its multitude of support moves or even hit back with Ice Beam.</p> ",

        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<p>Trick Room gives Exeggutor and its slow teammates a Speed advantage over your opponent for five turns; moreover Exeggutor has the durability to set it up. Its typing and incredible passive recovery also differentiate it from other Trick Room users.</p> <p>Leaf Storm is Exeggutor's most powerful STAB move and has an 81.25% chance to OHKO 252 HP / 0 SpD Politoed. Psyshock or Psychic are alternative STAB moves that does not lower Exeggutor's special attack whilst providing extra coverage, especially against Fighting- and Poison-types. Psyshock is preferred, as Pokemon in the Doubles metagame are more likely to be specially defensive than physically defensive. Psychic does outdamage Psyshock against some notable Pokemon, though, such as Conkeldurr and Kyurem-B. Protect is obligatory to keep Exeggutor safe against Pokemon that threaten Exeggutor whilst your other Pokemon on the field can threaten it, and, in addition to its normal myriad of uses, provides more opportunities for Harvest to activate.</p> <p>Harvest and Sitrus Berry are what enables Exeggutor to withstand trauma, giving it incredible passive recovery. Its Special bulk enables it to truly utilize this combo. With the given EV spread, Exeggutor will always survive Timid Latios' Dragon Gem Draco Meteor, and Modest 252 SpA Politoed' Ice Beam will deal 51.77% damage maximum (on that note, Exeggutor is brilliant against rain teams, as it fares similarly well against other Water-types). 12 Defense EVs guarantee survival against Tyranitar's unboosted Crunch. Sleep Powder can be used instead of one of Exeggutor's STAB moves for sleep support, but Exeggutor then loses out on valuable coverage.</p> <p>Exeggutor is not a Pokemon that you can just slap on the team; the team needs to effectively utilize Exeggutor's Grass typing for synergy. This is the main reason to use Exeggutor as a Trick Room setter. Otherwise you would be better off with another Pokemon to set up Trick Room. Heatran as a teammate benefits from Trick Room whilst providing excellent defensive synergy with Exeggutor; in addition, it covers Scizor, Genesect, and Bisharp, all of which counter Exeggutor. In return, Exeggutor manhandles the Water-types who wall Heatran. The same applies to other Fire-types such as Chandelure and Victini, though they don't synergize as well defensively. On that note, Chandelure and Victini can also set up Trick Room. Cresselia can use Sunny Day to give Harvest a 100% chance of restoring a Berry and can also be a second Trick Room setter for the team. Quiet Ninetales holding an Iron Ball also sets up sunlight and benefits from Exeggutor's Trick Room and ability to handle Water-types. Water-types also work well as teammates, covering the Fire-types such as Heatran that threaten Exeggutor. Exeggutor in turn checks two of the most common Grass-types that threaten Water-types, Amoonguss and Breloom, as well as Electric-types like Thundurus and Zapdos. Although Jellicent shares Exeggutor's weaknesses to Ghost and Dark, it can provide burn support through Scald and Will-O-Wisp to neuter physical threats so that less Pokemon can break through Exeggutor's passive recovery whilst acting as a secondary Trick Room setter.</p> <p>Fake Out support increases the likelihood that Exeggutor can pull off Trick Room. Follow Me and Rage Powder support also achieve this, but Fake Out is preferred, as unlike Fake Out, they are ineffective against Heat Wave and Blizzard, both of which hit Exeggutor super effectively. Hitmontop and Scrafty can provide Fake Out support, whilst benefiting from Trick Room. They also provide Intimidate support, which enables Exeggutor to utilize Harvest more easily, and threaten Tyranitar and Bisharp for Exeggutor.</p> "

        "name": "Chlorophyll",
        "description": "<p>Chlorophyll utilizes Exeggutor's massive Special Attack and pairs it with incredible Speed for a sweeping approach. Be warned though, much of the metagame can OHKO Exeggutor without EV investment in defenses due to its many weaknesses and lack of bulk to cover them.</p> <p>Leaf Storm is the main move due to its raw power -- when backed by Life Orb, it nets a guaranteed OHKO on 0 HP Garchomp and 252 HP Landorus-T and Tyranitar even in sand; all of the said Pokemon commonly trouble sun teams. Grass Knot is a less powerful alternative that does not cause a Special Attack drop, and it has 100 or 120 Base Power against much of the metagame. But be warned, it misses out on OHKOes against many notable threats, such as Rotom-W and Politoed. Psychic or Psyshock provides a secondary STAB option that can OHKO the multitude of Fighting-types in Doubles. Psychic is slashed first as it OHKOes Conkeldurr even without a Life Orb, but Psyshock only has a 56.25% chance to OHKO the standard 96 HP / 80 Def Conkeldurr with a Life Orb and a 0% chance when unboosted. Both options will OHKO Hitmontop, the premier Fighting-type of doubles. Sleep Powder can immobilize an opposing Pokemon for the rest of the battle, as they will most likely switch out after being put to sleep. Furthermore, it allows Exeggutor to dodge Sucker Punch. Protect keeps Exeggutor safe for a turn, or alternatively, gives an ally Pokemon a chance to set up sunlight to activate Chlorophyll.</p> <p>Life Orb maximizes Exeggutor's offense capabilities and, therefore, gets the first slash. It is strongly recommended if using Leaf Storm in order to score the aforementioned OHKOs. Furthermore, Life Orb recoil means little when much of the metagame will OHKO Exeggutor even at full health. On that topic, Focus Sash is also viable to ensure Exeggutor will survive at least one attack. The EVs maximize Special Attack and enable Exeggutor to outspeed neutral-natured Deoxys-A and positive-natured base 130s in the sun. 32 HP EVs provide a Life Orb number, minimizing Life Orb recoil. The rest is dumped into Special Defense. If not using Life Orb, reallocate Exeggutor's Special Defense EVs into HP.</p> <p>Exeggutor has many coverage moves that it can utilize instead of either Psyshock or Psychic, as well as Sleep Powder. Hidden Power Fire nails Steel-types that resist Exeggutor's STABs, and it gets pseudo-STAB in sun. Be warned that Scizor and Genesect holding an Occa Berry or Focus Sash can survive Hidden Power Fire OHKO Exeggutor back with their Bug-type attacks. Hidden Power Ground nails Heatran, which otherwise walls Exeggutor to death and OHKOes it in return. Hidden Power Ground will always OHKO 4 HP / 0 SpD sets without Shuca Berry provided Exeggutor holds a Life Orb, and has a chance to OHKO 252 HP / 0 SpD sets. Hidden Power Ice provides coverage against the multitude of Dragon-types, and OHKOs 4x Ice-weak Dragon-types and Landorus-T with a Life Orb boost unless they hold a Yache Berry or Focus Sash (sadly, most Landorus-T hold one of these items). Solar Beam can also be used as a Grass-type STAB move without Leaf Storm's Special Attack drop and Grass Knot's low Base Power against Pokemon with low weight. However, it is unreliable, as it renders Exeggutor a sitting duck when used outside sun, and as such is much less useful against the omnipresent Politoed and Tyranitar, which can remove sun upon switching in.</p> <p>Either Ninetales or a Sunny Day user is required as a teammate, though both can be run on the same team. Without it, there is no point in using Chlorophyll, and Exeggutor becomes a liability; this cannot be stressed enough. With no Speed or bulk, it will be KOed easily before it does anything. Pairing Exeggutor with Fire-types work well once again, as they can nail Steel-types which otherwise wall Exeggutor, and also benefit from the sun that Exeggutor desperately needs to function. In return, Exeggutor can potentially OHKO Tyranitar and Politoed with Leaf Storm (and Abomasnow if running Hidden Power Fire), who are huge threats to sun teams thanks to their weather-inducing abilities.</p> "

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>While often overlooked, Raikou can still be a good option for a team. Raikou has a nice Special Attack stat as well as a great Speed stat that lets it outspeed important Pokemon, such as Tornadus and Latios. Raikou's main problem is the severe amount of competition it faces for a teamslot from other Electric-types. Thundurus has Prankster, granting it priority on moves such as Thunder Wave and Taunt, Rotom-W has a useful Water typing that lets it act as a better check to weather based teams, and Zapdos has access to Tailwind, allowing it to grant speed control to its teammates. In addition, all of the aforementioned Pokemon possess an immunity to Ground-type moves. Thankfully, Raikou has a move of its own that lets it find a niche—Snarl. Due to Snarl's rarity, Raikou is one of the premier users of it in the tier, giving it a role that the aforementioned Electric-types cannot fill. In addition, Raikou also has a broad offensive movepool with moves such as Aura Sphere and Weather Ball, although their event distribution forces Raikou to use a Rash nature. Even in a tier filled with other great Electric-types, Raikou is worth considering for a teamslot.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aura Sphere can be useful to give Raikou a way to hit Tyranitar for major damage, while hitting Heatran and Ferrothorn for super effective damage as well. A set with Weather Ball could be an interesting option, but Weather Ball isn't a very reliable option, especially when weather the changes frequently in the tier. Additionally, both of the previously mentioned moves have the drawback of forcing Raikou into using a Rash nature, due to them being event moves. A way to take advantage of this is to make Raikou shiny so you can fool your opponent into thinking you are using an event move. A set with Rain Dance and Thunder can be useful on rain teams to act as a weather changer, but since Raikou has trouble with common weather inducers, such as Tyranitar and Abomasnow, this set might not function very well. Volt Switch can be a nice option to gain momentum while dishing out damage, but the fact that it forces Raikou out can be annoying when you need Raikou to stay in and attack more than once.</p> <p>Sunny Day can be a useful option since Raikou can then threaten Water-types further, while not being hampered itself by the presence of sun. Reflect can be a nice option to cushion damage from physical hits, but Raikou is typically better off using either Snarl or Light Screen, and having a Pokemon with Intimidate on its team. Psych Up can be useful to copy stat boosts from Pokemon such as Volcarona and Manaphy, but is highly situational. Sitrus Berry can be decent to grant Raikou extra survivability, but it is typically better served by another item choice. Quash can be an interesting option as a form of pseudo-Speed control, especially due to Raikou's high Speed. Thanks to Raikou's high Speed, Special Attack, and great coverage, a Choice set can be a good option to deal more damage or surprise opponents expecting to outspeed Raikou. Thunder Wave can be used to grant Speed control, but then Raikou becomes difficult to justify using instead of Thundurus.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Tyranitar can easily switch into Raikou—as long as Raikou lacks Aura Sphere—and proceed to strike back with a STAB Crunch or Rock Slide. The fact that Tyranitar gets a 50% Special Defense boost from the sandstorm it summons makes it even more of a threat, as Raikou will barely be able to scratch it. Ground-type Pokemon, such as Garchomp, Excadrill, Mamoswine, Rhyperior, and Landorus, are immune to Thunderbolt and can KO Raikou with a STAB-boosted Earthquake. Most of them must be wary of a Hidden Power Ice though. Mamoswine is an especially good answer for this reason, as Thick Fat and its Ice typing lets it resist Hidden Power Ice as well, while still being able to hit hard with Earthquake. Rhyperior is also excellent since its ability, Lightningrod, allows it to redirect Raikou's Thunderbolts, severely hampering Raikou's effectiveness. Grass-type Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Virizion, can take a hit from Raikou and either use Spore or strike back, respectively. Amoonguss can even use Rage Powder to redirect Thunderbolts, which it will take little damage from due to a natural resistance to Electric-type attacks, and great bulk. It also has Regenerator to shake off any damage Raikou manages to deal to it. Dragon-types, such as Latios, Latias, Kyurem, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon, have no problem taking a Thunderbolt and can live through a Hidden Power Ice. Kyurem and Kyurem-B are especially notable since they are only hit neutrally by Hidden Power Ice. Most of them do not appreciate a Special Attack drop from Snarl, though. Gastrodon and Swampert are immune to Thunderbolt, are hit neutrally by Hidden Power Ice, and can strike back with Earth Power and Earthquake, respectively, but must be careful of Hidden Power Grass. Powerful Choice Scarf users, such as Chandelure and Kyurem, can easily outspeed Raikou and either KO or cripple it. Rotom-H resists every move Raikou commonly carries, and can hit it with a STAB-boosted Overheat. However, between Overheat stat drops and Snarl drops, Rotom-H will quickly stop being able to threaten it.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Support",
        "description": "<p>With this set, Raikou can use its great Speed and Special Attack to threaten the opponent, while also acting as a nice check to opposing special attackers. Thunderbolt is the STAB move of choice as it lets Raikou deal heavy damage to bulky Water-types such as Jellicent, and Pokemon such as Tornadus, while granting Raikou nice neutral coverage across the board. Hidden Power Ice is used in the second slot to hit Pokemon that resist or are immune to Thunderbolt, such as Latios, Salamence, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, for super effective damage. It also forms a pseudo BoltBeam combination with Thunderbolt, giving Raikou impeccable coverage. Snarl might seem like a strange move on an offensive set, but it allows Raikou to handle special attackers. Since you can stack Special Attack drops with Snarl, Raikou has no problem whittling down the offenses of even the strongest special attackers until they can barely scratch Raikou. This can be very problematic for your opponent, especially if their team relies on multiple special attackers. Light Screen is a secondary option if you don't want your opponent to be able to switch out and remove their stat drops, but doesn't like Snarl does. In addition, it doesn't do damage, which would otherwise be nice to pick off weakened Pokemon.</p> <p>Shuca Berry is the main option to allow Raikou to survive Earthquakes and stray Earth Powers that could otherwise heavily damage or outright KO it. If power is preferred, Electric Gem can be used to grant Raikou a supercharged Thunderbolt. The EV spread allows Raikou to outspeed Tornadus and Thundurus, while hitting as hard as possible with 252 Special Attack EVs, with the remaining EVs invested in HP. If you're using Raikou on a rain team, Thunder can be used instead of Thunderbolt for the power boost and nifty 30% paralysis chance, but due to how commonly the weather changes in Doubles, its shaky accuracy outside of rain can be undesirable. Discharge can be an option if you're in need of a spread move, but it is significantly weaker than Thunderbolt, and the fact that you will need to either use Protect or switch in a Ground-type to avoid damaging, and potentially paralyzing your partner makes Thunderbolt the better option for the most part. Hidden Power Grass can be an option to get rid of Gastrodon, Swampert, and Rhyperior, but Raikou is then walled by common Dragon-type Pokemon such as Latios, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon. Expert Belt can be a nice option to grant Raikou more offensive power, but the power boost only applies to super effective moves.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Terrakion enjoy Raikou's ability to threaten bulky Water-types that bother them. In return, Terrakion can get rid of Tyranitar and Abomasnow, both of which can be problematic for Raikou. While Raikou can reduce an opposing Pokemon's Special Attack, it can't make a Pokemon's Attack stat drop, making Hitmontop a great partner due to the useful ability in Intimidate. Hitmontop is also able to OHKO Tyranitar and Abomasnow with its STAB Fighting-type moves, and has Wide Guard to shield Raikou from Earthquake, making it even better as a partner for Raikou. Since Ground-types can switch into Thunderbolt easily, and proceed to KO Raikou with their STABs, Pokemon that can get rid of them, such as Rotom-W and Abomasnow, make great partners for Raikou. Also, any Pokemon in the tier that enjoys having opposing special attackers weakened makes for a good teammate for this set.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Suicune is one the unsung heroes of the Doubles metagame. With a great pure Water typing, excellent bulk, and a great movepool, Suicune can fit onto a variety of teams. It can provide great support and speed control to a team through Tailwind and Icy Wind, without being dead weight like some other defensive Pokemon. The only thing letting Suicune down is its mediocre base Speed. However, this isn't as big of a deal in Doubles as it is in Singles and can be mitigated easily.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Suicune has a few other great options it can run, though they are usually better used by other Pokemon. It has the ability to set literally any weather manually, notably rain and hail, making it a good fit on weather teams who could use an additional bulky weather setter. Additionally, Suicune has access to Calm Mind, which can make for a very interesting last Pokemon situation with its ChestoRest set. Overall, any set that plays off of Suicune's excellent bulk will usually work well.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Suicune's biggest threat is Thundurus. With Prankster Taunt and Thunder Wave as well as a strong STAB Thunderbolt, Thundurus can hit Suicune hard, dealing massive damage, or just screw up any sort of set up Suicune attempts and paralyze a good majority of your team before it finally gets taken out. Other threats are faster attackers with super effective coverage, including, but not limited to, Shaymin-S, Ludicolo under rain, and Zapdos as well as Latios, Latias and to a lesser degree, Hydreigon, who all resist Suicune's STAB Water-type attacks; the last three can all hit Suicune hard with a Draco Meteor. Another threat is Ferrothorn, who hits Suicune super effectively, only really fears a burn from Scald, and doesn't care about Icy Wind and Snarl in the slightest. This is also true for Kyurem-B, as it almost always carries Fusion Bolt and is bulky enough to shrug off any attack Suicune carries. Gastrodon is a great bulky check, as it walls Suicune completely, absorbing its STAB Water-type moves. Chlorophyll users are another big threat, especially Sawsbuck and Lilligant. With their powerful Grass-type attacks, they can easily outspeed and subdue Suicune. Abomasnow also fits this description, being able to kill Suicune with Giga Drain or Wood Hammer. Finally, Defiant Pokemon cause trouble for any set that uses Icy Wind or Snarl; Bisharp is a notable example, gaining Attack boosts and threatening Suicune with powerful moves such as Sucker Punch.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Bulky Support",
        "description": "<p>With defensive investment and supporting moves, this set aims to reduce your opponent's team's offensive capabilities, in addition to still dealing damage and letting your teammates come in more easily. This set also tries to force switches from your opponents, disrupting their entire strategy. Snarl and Icy Wind are two great spread attacks with a 100% chance of lowering the opponent's Special Attack and Speed, respectively, which is a big deal in a metagame all about Speed and power control. Tailwind is something every person should consider when running Suicune, as it is easily one of the best users of the move in the game. Scald is the STAB move of choice due to its 30% chance to burn opponents, which makes for a total of three stat-reducing moves. Protect is the obvious choice in the last slot to prevent damage and effects for a turn; however, Rest allows Suicune to stick around longer and cause even more mischief.</p> <p>Suicune's EVs are highly specific. After an Icy Wind, it outspeeds up to base 110s, a Speed tier most notably including Latias and Latios. Suicune's bulk allows it to live Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteors from Timid Latios and Modest Hydreigon with plenty of HP to spare. Coupled with Snarl, Suicune can further lower their Special Attack stats, crippling them and forcing them to switch. The item selection here depends on what role Suicune plays on your team and how long it needs to be around to do what you need it to. While Sitrus Berry is usually the better choice, Wacan Berry will give Suicune a one-time safety net from Electric attacks, while Chesto Berry can let Suicune Rest off any damage and ailments and get right back into the action. Between burns, Snarl and Icy Wind, Suicune's job is to cripple the opponent's offense and cause mayhem, which it does with aplomb. This Suicune works well with Intimidate support and Light Screen, making Hitmontop, Cresselia, Gyarados, and Salamence all good partners. Be wary of Tornadus and Bisharp, though, as their Defiant ability can make them very hard to deal with if you spam stat-lowering moves willy-nilly.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Offensive Tailwind",
        "description": "<p>Suicune's Tailwind set is one of its better sets in Doubles. Access to Tailwind while being resistant to Ice-types moves gives Suicune a very important niche, thanks to all of the Icy Winds flying around. Tailwind support, although sometimes inferior to other forms of speed control, is a very solid and easy way to make everything on your team super-fast, giving average to low Speed Pokemon a chance to run over the opposing team for four turns, counting the turn Tailwind is used. The choice of moves following Tailwind is up to the player. Scald offers a good 30% burn chance, while Hydro Pump gives Suicune a huge punching tool, albeit a bit less accurate. Ice Beam gives it good coverage against everything but other Water-types. The last move depends on what your team needs. Protect is an obvious choice in Doubles, giving Suicune a full turn of protection from everything bar passive weather effects. Roar, however, has the interesting effect of being able to phaze out Trick Room-inducers just before they can set up, which is important as Tailwind teams usually fare horribly in Trick Room.</p> <p>Suicune's EVs let it outspeed all positive-natured base 70s. This includes Politoed, Cloyster, and the ever-important Breloom. Outrunning Breloom lets Suicune get off a Tailwind before it can be Spored. Also, after Tailwind is up, Suicune outspeeds even Choice Scarf Latios. Maximum investment in Special Attack gives Suicune as much power as possible. There's nothing better than surprising your opponent with a very powerful Hydro Pump coming off what is usually seen as a wall. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP to complement Suicune's already high natural bulk. Suicune can also run a spread of 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe with a Modest nature for more power in exchange for bulk. Suicune can also run a spread of 252 HP / 120 SpA / 136 Spe with a Timid nature for a far bulkier set than the earlier mentioned one that still retains a punch.</p> <p>The item choice here is usually dependent on what your team needs more. Wacan Berry is more useful overall, as Electric-type attacks are far more common than Grass-type attacks and Suicune's natural bulk can only let it take so much. After all, Sitrus Berry is of no use if you're already dead. Sitrus does have its uses though, especially on sand and hail teams where passive damage can add up quickly. Water Gem could also be used to give Suicune a powerful one-time nuke.</p> <p>This particular set works well on bulky offense teams, where members hit really hard and can take hits but lack the Speed to do a lot of damage to the other team. Grass-types make really great partners in particular, as their STABs hit the main thing Suicune can't, namely bulky Water-types. Breloom is one of the best partners Suicune could ask for, as it forces the opponent to make it a priority while Suicune sets up, thus letting the two go to town on the opponent in tandem with one another. Amoonguss is another great partner, almost guaranteeing Tailwind being set up with the Rage Powder and Spore support it can provide. Amoonguss also gives your team a bit of cushion against Trick Room teams thanks to its low Speed. Abomasnow is also a good partner, as it lets Suicune use Blizzard over Ice Beam, thus giving Suicune a great spread attack. Abomasnow also provides a Grass-type STAB attack for dealing with bulky Water-types.</p> "

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran is capable of running a number of vastly different sets, which is only one of the factors that makes it an excellent addition to most teams. On top of its excellent typing and ability, which give it immunities to Poison- and Fire-type attacks and several resistances, Heatran also has decent bulk and a good Special Attack stat, as well as two Fire-type spread moves: Eruption and Heat Wave. However, Heatran's terrible weaknesses to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks severely main it given the predominance of Earthquake and the ever-present Hitmontop.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The most useful other option for Heatran is Air Balloon, which will allow it to avoid all Ground-type attacks until it is hit by another type of attack. This is extremely helpful when dealing with Landorus-T, other Heatran, and Volcarona. Heatran's movepool is decent, and it has a lot of options to consider for all of its sets. First of all, it can run Hidden Power Grass to deal with Gastrodon, one of its main counters in Doubles. It will also help finish off a Politoed in rain. Heatran also has access to Flash Cannon, which is useful to deal with Tyranitar, but other than that, it's mainly a useless move. Heatran also has access to several useful support options. It can run Taunt to shut down Trick Room users and Sunny Day to boost its own and its teammates' attacks. Heatran can also run Will-O-Wisp, especially on more defensive sets, to ruin its main counters: Fighting-types and Earthquake users. Single-target moves, such as Flamethrower and Overheat, can also be used for their reliability and sheer power, respectively. Heatran also has access to Flame Charge, but it's generally better to use a partner with Tailwind to help overcome Heatran's lackluster speed. Heatran can run AncientPower to deal with Volcarona, a common check, but the move is otherwise useless. Lastly, Heatran is able to run a Choice Scarf set to dish out fast spread attacks, or a Choice Specs set coupled with a fast After You user such as Jirachi, which will let Heatran quickly spam moves without investing in Speed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>All common Ground- and Fighting-types threaten Heatran greatly; this includes Landorus, Landorus-T, Excadrill, Garchomp, Gastrodon, Quagsire, Hitmontop, Scrafty, and Conkeldurr. One Earthquake or Earth Power, and Heatran is usually gone. Wide Guard users, such as Hitmontop, shut down most offensive Heatran variants, as it usually chooses to run Eruption or Heat Wave for its STAB move of choice. Terrakion also threatens Heatran greatly, as it can KO Heatran with Close Combat or damage it severely with Rock Slide. Gastrodon threatens Heatran with Earth Power, Muddy Water, or Surf in the rain, taking very little damage from any attack Heatran has to damage it with, bar the rare Hidden Power Grass, which often forces Gastrodon to switch out. Water-types in general will take little damage from Heatran, and all of them will obliterate it under rain. It's common to see Heatran running away from Politoed, Manaphy, and Ludicolo, all of which can seriously dent and KO it. In general, rain will render Heatran useless.</p> ",

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<p>This Heatran set's forte is survivability. The strategy is to alternate between using Substitute and Protect to survive hits, and then when the opponent lets Heatran's Substitute survive, Heatran can deliver strong hits with Heat Wave and Earth Power. Earth Power lets Heatran deal with opposing Heatran; this is even more useful because opposing Heatran might not be able to KO back if Substitute is up.</p> <p>Teaming up with Fake Out users, such as Hitmontop and Scrafty, helps Heatran set up Substitutes and maintain them. The former also provides Wide Guard support, which can enable Heatran to take no damage from Earthquakes and Rock Slides, allowing it to set up a Substitute or just keep attacking from behind one. Follow Me and Rage Powder users, such as Amoonguss and Togekiss, are also highly welcome, as they allow for Substitute set-up as well. Cresselia can provide Icy Wind and Thunder Wave support, both of which help this Heatran set shine. Thundurus can also provide Thunder Wave support, except with priority. Heatran also needs the support of teammates that can deal with Ground- and Fighting-type Pokemon. Besides Cresselia, Heatran can team up with Landorus-T to render Fighting-types useless. Kyurem-B is the best Pokemon to deal with Ground-types, as even the pesky Landorus-T with its Intimidate ability will be obliterated by Kyurem-B's sheer strength. Abomasnow and Genesect make for excellent Blizzard spammers, which help deal with Heatran's main counters as well.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This Heatran doesn't think, it just clicks damage. With Shuca Berry it can survive most would-be counters like Hidden Power Ground Latios, Substitute Kyurem-B, and even Scarf Landorus-T and hit back hard, though strong Fighting- and Water-types can still destroy Heatran. If your opponent expects Substitute Heatran, this can often let you win mindgames by not playing them at all. Earth Power is used for good neutral coverage. Flash Cannon mostly hits Dragon-types, especially Kyurem-B, but also does slightly more than Earth Power to Tyranitar and is a STAB option if you really don't want to miss on a turn.</p> <p>Dragon Pulse can be used over Flash Cannon to hit most Dragon-types slightly harder, but Heatran still doesn't OHKO them so the extra damage on Kyurem-B is generally best. Fire Gem is an option for extreme damage on a Heat Wave but you will have to play scared against the significant number of Ground coverage users in the metagame.</p> <p>Heatran can team up with Pokemon weak to Fire-type moves to try to get a Flash Fire boost, but most players will be wary to use them when there's a Heatran around. Wide Guard support is often essential to compensate for Heatran's Earthquake weakness, a move which is present in most games, so Hitmontop is an excellent teammate; Hitmontop also provides Intimidate support to help Heatran against Landorus-T, Tyranitar, and Excadrill. Cresselia, Dusclops, and Dusknoir are also excellent teammates to support Heatran in the field, being able to give it a Flash Fire boost and the occasional Helping Hand; they can also provide Sunny Day support. If you aren't running Trick Room on your team, Icy Wind and Thunder Wave can come in handy, making Cresselia an even better partner; Thundurus can be a life saver as well with its access to Prankster Thunder Wave. Basically all Pokemon with Intimidate have good synergy with Heatran. Aside from Hitmontop, Landorus-T, which is immune to Earthquake and can weaken its users; Scrafty, which can check Cresselia, Tyranitar and Excadrill; and Gyarados, which can take Water-type attacks directed at Heatran and let you use the opponent's rain in your favor, are all good partners.</p> "

        "name": "ErupTran",
        "description": "<p>The ultimate Doubles destroyer, this set utilizes the strongest spread attack available: boosted Eruption. If Heatran manages to set up, even Kingdra with its 4x resistance to Fire and decent Special Defense will come close to being KOed. Eruption Heatran needs a lot of support to succeed, however. Trick Room and Sunny Day support, the latter of which can be supplied from either Ninetales's Drought or a support teammate of choice, as well as Helping Hand and Flash Fire support are all crucial for Heatran to succeed. The trick is to start setting up Trick Room while Heatran uses Protect, allowing it to escape that turn unharmed. The best partners for this are Dusclops and Mental Herb Dusknoir, which each have their pros and cons: extreme bulk in the case of the former and a defense against Taunt in that of the latter. If you aren't using Mental Herb Dusknoir, never start off with this tactic, as a Taunt user will just ruin your strategy and proceed to disrupt your team to the point where you will most likely lose.</p> <p>Charcoal is the item of choice for this set, as Heatran is meant to set up and sweep, meaning that it will often fire more than the three attacks required to equal Fire Gem's initial attack boost. Furthermore, if Heatran sets up, it won't need the sheer power of the Fire Gem. The EVs here are meant to give Heatran maximum bulk while retaining power and speed under Trick Room. While the tactic sounds amazing, it's not that easy to pull off if your opponent has access to Taunt, bulky Earthquake users, or Rain Dance or Drizzle users. If you spot any Heatran check, it's better to get rid of them first and use Eruption Heatran as a late-game sweeper. Trick Room support is essential, so teaming Heatran with a slow Fake Out user such as Scrafty is a good idea. Victini can be used on a mixed Trick Room team that uses Sunny Day, as it is able to deal high amounts of damage under the sun with V-create, denting even Cresselia. Cresselia itself is a great teammate to set Sunny Day and Trick Room, as well as boosting Heatran with Helping Hand. Dusclops or Dusknoir are almost essential as partners for this Heatran as well. Fire Blast is an option instead of Heat Wave if you find yourself capable of letting Heatran stay at high health and Wide Guard concerns you, but the main point of this set is to deal massive amounts of damage with powerful spread moves.</p> "

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>The metagame of Doubles is vastly different from Singles, and no Pokemon attests to this fact more then Cresselia. A forgotten relic of a long gone age in Singles, Cresselia absolutely shines in this metagame, often known as the \"queen of Doubles.\" Possessing absolutely insane 120 / 120 / 130 bulk, a typing that is rather okay defensively, a useful immunity to Earthquake, and a large supporting movepool more robust than a Swiss Army knife, Cresselia is the ultimate supporter in Doubles, able to both reliably and consistently do her job under almost any circumstance. While she is weak to a few top tier threats such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, it is hard to call Cresselia anything other than the best Pokemon in the tier, and she should always be considered if you need a support Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Given Cresselia's amazing movepool, it is only natural that the she would have a plethora of other options. Leftovers is an option over Sitrus Berry if you foresee Cresilla commonly living for more than four turns. Psychic is always an option for a little more power against Defense-heavy Pokemon. A Calm Mind set is viable, but it must beware critical hits, status conditions, Taunt, and strong physical Dark-type attacks. Sunny Day is always an option, as it beats Swift Swim and Sand Rush Pokemon and pairs nicely with Heatran, a common partner with Cresselia. Psycho Shift with a Burn Orb is an interesting option that allows Cresselia to spread burns, something she otherwise cannot reliably do. Lunar Dance is a great option for certain teams, as it can give certain key Pokemon a second lease on life. Gravity is a somewhat powerful field effect in Doubles, but it leaves Cresselia open to Ground-type attacks. Some Pokemon such as Heatran appreciate having Levitate, so Skill Swap is always an option, one that can sometimes be used against the opponent as well, such as to remove Storm Drain from Gastrodon. Magic Coat is an option to reflect moves that Cresselia does not enjoy taking such as Taunt and Toxic. Finally, Swagger can be used with a Lum Berry carrying teammate to give it +2 Attack or as a risky gambit against the opponent in order to confuse them.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While Cresselia is mighty, she is not unstoppable. First and foremost, Cresselia really doesn't like Fake Out, as it can stop Trick Room, crucial Icy Winds, and all sorts of important support moves. Tying in with this, Cresselia absolutely loathes Taunt, as the move can shut down a lot of her support options. Trick Room and Calm Mind Cresselia both dislike Roar, as it will both erase Calm Mind boosts and phaze Cresselia before she can use Trick Room due to its higher priority. Powerful Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Bisharp are also deadly, with Bisharp being especially such due to gaining +2 Attack every time Cresselia uses Icy Wind against it. Chandelure can deal large chunks of damage to Cresselia with STAB Shadow Ball, while the absolute best Cresselia can do in return is Psyshock. Hydreigon can 2HKO or 3HKO most of Cresselia's sets with Dark Pulse, but it must watch out for the Speed drop from Icy Wind, which will absolutely cripple it until it switches out. Volcarona threatens Cresselia heavily with its STAB Bug Buzz and can even use Quiver Dance to raise its power and give Cresselia even more of a hard time. Genesect's +1 U-turn can seriously damage Cresselia, but it fails to make a significant impact otherwise. Heracross's Megahorn coming off of a Guts boost can also do major damage. Escavalier fears only Hidden Power Fire but avoids being OHKOed by it and deals intense damage with Megahorn. Finally, Scizor only fears Hidden Power Fire from the offensive set, and it threatens Cresselia with its high-power STAB Technician-boosted Bug Bite.</p> ",

Psychic is better than Psyshock because it breaks Kyurem-B's Substitute and deals extra damage to Conkeldurr. Hidden Power Ground prevents Heatran from setting up, while Hidden Power Fire does the same for the less common Scizor. Ice Beam is kind of pathetic, but can 2HKO Ice weak Pokemon like Latios and offensive Thundurus. Thunder Wave and Trick Room are great options for speed control, with which is better just depending on your team. On the flipside, you can run Icy Wind, which does some damage to Ice weak Pokemon, provides some speed control, and lets you run Helping Hand.</p> <p>Expert Belt is used to bluff a defensive set as well as still provide reasonable levels of power and not damage Cresselia with recoil. If you run Icy Wind, you can use 124 Speed EVs to outspeed Tornadus after a single Icy Wind; if you run Trick Room, make sure to give Cresselia a Quiet nature.</p> <p>Ideal partners for this set include Pokemon that can beat those that wall Cresselia. Ground-types such as Excadrill, Landorus, Landorus-T, and Garchomp can not only can murder Tyranitar and Steel-types that give Cresselia headaches but also don't have to worry about hitting her with Earthquake thanks to Levitate. Fighting-types such as Hitmontop, Blaziken, and Scrafty also work wonders in this regard; with the exception of Scrafty they must watch out for Psychic-type Pokemon, which Cresselia cannot touch.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Useful at any stage in the game, this Cresselia set aims to gain control of the enemy's Speed as well as possibly bolster the power of your team's attacks. Icy Wind and Thunder Wave are the best choices for the primary move, and they both have their upsides and downsides. Icy Wind lowers the Speed of both enemies at once and deals decent damage to Pokemon weak to Ice-type attacks, but it also raises the Attack of Defiant Pokemon by two stages, does not work on Clear Body Pokemon, and is reset by the enemy switching out. Thunder Wave has a slightly greater effect and lasts for the duration of the match until healed, but it does not work on Ground-type Pokemon and can only affect one target at once. Psyshock is the main attacking move, and it's recommended due to targeting the opponent's Defense, a stat not as commonly boosted in Doubles as Special Defense. Helping Hand is the recommended option the third slot for boosting the power of Cresselia's partner. Finally, while Rest is used in the last slot to help Cresselia survive as long as possible, Protect can be used to avoid attacks such as Crunch and stall for time against field effects such as Trick Room and Tailwind.</p> <p>For items, if you are using Rest, use a Chesto Berry to instantly wake Cresselia up. Otherwise, use a Sitrus Berry so that she lives longer. The EVs are set up to 2HKO Hariyama, Virizion, and Hitmontop with Psyshock and avoid being OHKOed by Dark Gem Tyranitar's Crunch, with the rest of the EVs shoved into Special Defense and HP to maximize bulk.</p> <p>This Cresselia set works on pretty much any team in existence, but it is especially good as a partner for Pokemon such as Breloom and Kyurem-B who really appreciate being able to get the jump on their enemies. Heatran deserves a special mention, as not only does it threaten Bug-, Dark-, and Ghost-type Pokemon (such as Darkrai, Volcarona, and Bisharp) which give Cresselia a hard time, but it can also fully take advantage of Cresselia's speed control as well as Helping Hand.</p> "

Safeguard is also an option if you are concerned about burns and paralysis, two things that Trick Room teams loathe.</p> <p>Mental Herb is the item of choice if you wish for Cresselia to avoid Taunt once; otherwise, Sitrus Berry allows Cresselia to stay around for significantly longer.

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Gyarados is one of those badass Kanto Pokemon that captured the hearts and minds of a generation of kids in the mid-nineties. However, unlike Charizard, it's actually competitively useful. Gyarados is almost unique in the Doubles metagame for its ability to function equally well in the vastly differing roles of bulky supporter and setup sweeper. For each role it has a tailor-made ability: Intimidate allows it and its teammates to take physical hits so much better, and Moxie means that, if offensive Gyarados gets a kill, the opponent is often on the back foot. 95 / 79 / 100 bulk is decent, but with Intimidate it is very good, and it comes with sweet resistances that allow Gyarados to stop common physical attackers like Scizor and Hitmontop in their tracks. These resistances also include common spread moves like Surf, Muddy Water, Heat Wave, and Earthquake. However, Gyarados's Electric-type weakness is something of an Achilles' heel, as is a weakness to the ever-present Rock Slide. Nevertheless, these flaws do not stop it from being a top-tier threat that can rip gaping holes in a team or happily spread crippling Thunder Waves throughout the enemy ranks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gyarados is a Pokemon that has all the tools it needs, but little more. As for entirely different sets, a Choice Band set with Intimidate can combine the best of both worlds—big power and the freedom to switch in and out—but the loss of Protect hurts it, and support will have to be provided in the form of speed control. Bounce is Gyarados's only Flying STAB, but with almost everything running Protect in Doubles it is the easiest thing in the world to stop. A two attacks + Substitute, or even a Waterfall + Dragon Dance + Substitute set, is plausible, but these also require unreasonable levels of support. The support set could run Rain Dance to support a team heavily dependent on rain. Gyarados's extensive special movepool, including the likes of Thunderbolt, Dragon Pulse, and Fire Blast, is utterly wasted on a Pokemon with a base 60 Special Attack stat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Although the support and Dragon Dance sets have somewhat different counters, a common theme is Electric-types. Rotom-W stands out as the best, able to take anything Gyarados can throw at it and hit back with Electric-type STAB. When carrying a Choice Scarf, it can also outrun Gyarados after a Dragon Dance. Thundurus, Thundurus-T, Zapdos, Manectric, Raikou, and Rotom-F do a good job too, all OHKOing if Gyarados lacks a Wacan Berry; Thundurus gets a special mention for Taunting partners with Follow Me or Rage Powder, which would otherwise enable Gyarados to set up. Most of these are also immune to Earthquake should Gyarados be running it. Rock Slide users such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, Excadrill, and Kabutops also deal heavy damage, but none of them appreciates a rain-boosted Waterfall to the face. Sableye checks both sets by Taunting the support set and burning the offensive one; Sableye can also Taunt Follow Me users like Thundurus can.</p> <p>The support set is rendered ineffective by anything with Taunt, which will normally force Gyarados out. Particular mentions go to Prankster users and other faster users of the move, such as Mew and Hydreigon. Manaphy cannot be touched as long as it is raining, as Hydration heals paralysis, and it can get in a Tail Glow before it is Taunted. Gastrodon is likewise unhurt by both Waterfall and Thunder Wave. Defiant users such as Bisharp and Tornadus keep Gyarados off the field altogether, and Icy Wind only exacerbates this problem.</p> <p>The Dragon Dance set is walled by something, regardless of what Gyarados runs. Jellicent and Ferrothorn are the most consistent bets as they resist Gyarados's Water- and Normal-type coverage—Jellicent is completely immune. Jellicent can burn Gyarados with Will-O-Wisp or Scald, and Ferrothorn can hit hard with Power Whip or paralyze it with Thunder Wave. However, Amoonguss will merrily spam Rage Powder against both as Gyarados continues to boost. This set also loathes Trick Room, which turns the Speed tiers upside down, so bulky setters such as Cresselia, which can run Sunny Day too, put in work. In general, the best way to beat the Dragon Dance set is to stop it setting up by clever use of disruptive moves like Fake Out and Taunt, which can come from a wide variety of sources.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Intimidate Support",
        "description": "<p>Although Gyarados's stat distribution might suggest otherwise, its most common and most effective role is as a supporter designed to cripple opponents in various ways. The most obvious way in which it does this is just by switching in and activating Intimidate, which is anathema to the vast majority of physical attackers. It can also slow opponents down with its choice of speed control. Thunder Wave has the advantages of being permanent, reducing Speed by a much larger factor, and additionally having a chance to stop opponents moving altogether, while Icy Wind hits both opponents, isn't prevented by Taunt, and can hit Ground-types. Thunder Wave is generally a little better as Waterfall hurts Ground-types anyway, and Icy Wind makes Gyarados even more of a liability against Defiant users. Waterfall does decent damage, Taunt prevents opposing speed control and other forms of support, and Protect is recommended for scouting and for blocking dangerous attacks.</p> <p>This set's EVs are largely customizable, as evidenced by the complicated spread shown above. For the record, the given spread outruns Cresselia and survives Modest Thundurus-T's Thunderbolt, Modest Hydreigon's Draco Meteor, and Jolly Terrakion's Rock Gem-boosted Stone Edge after Intimidate. Any remaining EVs are dumped into boosting the power of Waterfall. Several attacks can be run in the third slot instead of Taunt. For example, Stone Edge can be used to hit Abomasnow, and Ice Fang can be used against Salamence and Shaymin-S, but secondary attacks are generally less useful than Taunt. With a Wacan Berry, Gyarados is difficult to OHKO even with Electric-type attacks, so it is the item of choice. Sitrus Berry and Lum Berry are also usable, but Gyarados is likely to be targeted by Electric-type attacks. Mental Herb prevents Gyarados being shut down by Taunt, but like Wacan Berry, it only works once. If run in sand or hail, Leftovers is a solid item choice to negate the passive damage.</p> <p>However tempting it is to partner this Gyarados set with a Lightningrod user to shield it from Electric-type attacks, it must be remembered that doing so takes away your ability to use Thunder Wave. Lightningrod redirects allies' attacks, too! Thus doing so is not recommended unless you pick Icy Wind. Rather, you should just switch out of Electric-type attacks into something that can take the hit—Gyarados should be doing this anyway to get the most out of Intimidate. As for partners, Politoed can bring rain, but Gyarados can still do its job in or out of any weather. Earthquake users, particularly slow ones such as Solid Rock Rhyperior and Mold Breaker Excadrill, can really benefit from Gyarados slowing the opponents down, and Gyarados is immune to their Earthquake. Conversely, fast, frail teammates love Gyarados's ability to prevent Trick Room with Taunt and the effect of Intimidate turning opponents' OHKOs into 2HKOs. Tyranitar is another Pokemon that loves Gyarados's presence on a team, as Gyarados resists five of Tyranitar's six weaknesses, making it an ideal switch-in much of the time.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>With this set, Gyarados relies on its bulk, but uses it to take on a more offensive approach. Dragon Dance gives Gyarados frightening power and Speed in just one turn and is capable of cleaning up weakened teams or decimating them early on. Waterfall maims anything that doesn't resist it and additionally has a nice 20% flinch chance. The third moveslot depends on what you want to hit: Return has the best neutral coverage, Ice Fang hits Grass- and Dragon-types but leaves Gyarados walled by Water-types, and Earthquake is the best spread move available and can be used to pick up more Moxie boosts, potentially even when Gyarados KOes a partner. Protect is highly important on this set, as Gyarados doesn't have the luxury of switching out without consequences most of the time.</p> <p>Moxie is the ability of choice here, as it makes a sweep a lot harder to stop once it gets going. However, Intimidate is still highly usable and gives Gyarados more physical bulk to set up with. Even opposing Intimidate users struggle to check it, as common Intimidate users such as Hitmontop lack the means to hit it for significant damage. The EVs are not set in stone. This particular spread survives Timid Latios's Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor and outpaces Choice Scarf Tyranitar after a Dragon Dance boost. The third move can be replaced by Double-Edge; it's more powerful than Return and can help Gyarados muscle past counters like Rotom-W, but comes at the cost of recoil damage and is incompatible with Moxie. Water Gem is the preferred item as it can help grab more KOs, and therefore potentially an extra Attack boost.</p> <p>As far as teammates go, rain support is important to boost the power of Waterfall: Politoed brings rain and can boost Gyarados's power further with Helping Hand. Follow Me or Rage Powder support is almost essential to set up successfully, and the best candidate for the job is Amoonguss due to its appreciation of rain and ability to take Thunderbolts without blinking, as well as take a counter out of the game with Spore. Dual screens from the likes of Latias or Cresselia can also help in this respect. Gyarados's teammates should also be able to deal with opponents Gyarados cannot break through, which largely depends on Gyarados's coverage move. For example, if Gyarados runs Ice Fang, a Pokemon such as Shaymin-S that can smash through bulky Water-types will be very much appreciated. A Taunt user is also advisable as otherwise Cresselia can ruin Gyarados's day with Trick Room and Sunny Day. Finally, as Thunder Wave is absent from this set, Lightningrod support from Rhyperior or Manectric is useful and can definitely help Gyarados in setting up.</p> "

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>Politoed is only used because of Drizzle. However, that doesn't mean it's a complete waste of a team slot; its actually decent defenses and good defensive typing give it surprising longevity when running a fully defensive support set, which it can use to soften up the opposition with its decent supporting movepool. Offensively, the rain it provides boosts the power of its Water-type moves to high levels, allowing it to dish out some decent damage with Choice Specs or a Water Gem. While Politoed, at first glance, seems to be a pretty poor Water-type, Drizzle makes it all worthwhile, and unlike Ninetales, it can still hold its own in battle.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Politoed is probably the worst choice on any rain team for a backup Rain Dance user because it's almost always moving last, but it's still a possibility. Wacan Berry can be run to survive the strong Electric-type attacks Politoed attracts, such as those from Thundurus and Rotom-W, but Leftovers, Water Gem, and Choice Specs are usually better options, due to the longevity the first provides and the power boost the last two provide, so this is thus generally inadvisable. Similarly, Chesto Berry and Rest can be run to both heal status and get full recovery; however, between Rest and Protect, Politoed' moveset will become pretty barren. Hypnosis is a great choice for either set, if you have Gravity or don't mind it utterly failing 40% of the time, being able to nearly take any Pokemon out of the match. Haze can be used on the defensive set to remove a partner's Draco Meteor or Intimidate stat drops as well as neuter an opponent's stat boost users. However, it comes with the downside of removing any work you put into dropping your opponent's stats and, due to being situational, is generally worse than Icy Wind. Choice Scarf is a possible item on Politoed, but its meager boost isn't worth the huge drop in power and bulk from losing Choice Specs and changing HP EVs to Speed EVs.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Basically all Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon make great Politoed counters, as they can OHKO it and withstand whatever it tries to throw at them. Abomasnow is worthy of special mention because of its ability to remove the rain that Politoed sets, thus making it fail at its main role of weather starter. Thundurus is also a particularly good check, as it can OHKO with Electric Gem Thunderbolt and paralyze the Swift Swim users that often accompany Politoed (though it must be wary of switching in on an Icy Wind). Thanks to its resistance to Water- and Ice-type moves, Rotom-W can switch into Politoed with relative impunity and threaten it with a powerful Thunderbolt or Thunder. Dragon-types can beat the offensive set handily but must beware an Icy Wind from the defensive set. Gastrodon has nothing to fear from the defensive set, but an offensive set's Hidden Power Grass will ruin it.</p> <p>Apart from KOing Politoed, the most effective way to counter it is to simply ruin the tactics that rain teams commonly employ. Abomasnow and Thundurus again get a mention, the former for removing rain with its own ability and the latter for having Prankster Thunder Wave to slow down Swift Swim users. Tyranitar, even though it can't stomach a strong hit from Politoed, can also remove Drizzle with Sand Stream, putting a stop to a rain team's momentum. Amoonguss, despite its Grass typing, lacks the offensive presence to threaten rain teams effectively, but it can use Rage Powder to redirect strong single-target Water-type attacks to itself, taking pittance from them. If all else fails, a manual Sunny Day from the likes of Cresselia can be a real hassle for rain teams and reduce Politoed's usefulness.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set maximizes Politoed's longevity, ensuring it will still be there to set Drizzle again should you need it to. Scald is an obligatory STAB move, and, thanks to rain, still hits hard enough to 2HKO frailer Pokemon, such as Tornadus, and those weak to Water-type moves. Being such a critical target for opposing weather teams, Politoed needs Protect, which buys it at least a turn of Leftovers recovery and often a completely free turn. Icy Wind can be incredibly useful for slowing down faster opponents so that Politoed's partner can KO them without taking a hit. Politoed's fourth move depends on your team's needs: Helping Hand is generally preferred for its utility, but Encore is the better choice if your team is having trouble with defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Cresselia.</p> <p>A Politoed with the given EVs will never be OHKOed by Latios's Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor; the rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense to maximize Politoed's mixed bulk. Speed is entirely minimized so Politoed can set its weather against opposing Tyranitar and Abomasnow who are not similarly prepared. Alternatively, Politoed can run a Bold nature with 31 Speed IVs to outspeed Tyranitar (and Scizor) and smack it with a Scald, but because Scald only 4HKOes in sand, setting rain on a double switch is generally more useful, especially as only a severely weakened Politoed can be KOed by Tyranitar. Sitrus Berry is a viable option on any defensive set, but Politoed usually survives for more than four turns, which makes Leftovers the superior option in the long run. If neither Encore nor Helping Hand are very appealing, Politoed can run Perish Song, which can end endgame stalemates and force out troublesome Pokemon who are behind Substitutes or have stat boosts.</p> <p>This set works exceptionally well when teamed up with Dragon-type Pokemon such as Latios and Kyurem-B, most of whom struggle only with faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users, which Politoed is more than happy to slow down with an Icy Wind. After the faster threats are neutralized, Helping Hand-boosted Dragon-type moves are virtually guaranteed to KO something on the opposing team. On the other hand, this set also works wonders when paired up with a highly defensive Pokemon such as Hitmontop, Ferrothorn, or Cresselia, as Politoed can spread burns, stat drops, and chip damage to soften up the opposing team. And obviously, being Politoed, this set works best on a team with Swift Swim attackers such as Kingdra and Ludicolo, though when paired with them, Politoed will often find its Icy Wind and redundant Water-type coverage to be dead weight.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<p>If you want a Politoed set that won't be a drain on the offensive momentum of your heavy offense rain team, look no further than this one. An item-boosted, STAB Hydro Pump hits incredibly hard under rain, even off of Politoed's below-average base Special Attack. Politoed's two coverage moves in Ice Beam and Hidden Power Grass provide super effective hits on Dragon-type Pokemon and Water-type Pokemon, such as Gastrodon and Rotom-W, both of which are pests for any rain team, respectively. Choice Specs adds consistent power to all of Politoed's moves, while Water Gem allows it to switch between moves, a boon which cannot be underestimated. The only notable OHKO that Water Gem misses out on is Gastrodon, so the drop in power is not as severe as it might seem--in general, even Choice Specs variants should stick to Hydro Pump, as Politoed's coverage moves lack the punch to OHKO what they target. Choice Specs variants obviously have no use for Protect and thus should use Scald due to its perfect accuracy, whereas Water Gem variants should opt for Protect due to its utility.</p> <p>While Politoed is still EVed to survive Latios's Draco Meteor, the rest of its EVs have been moved into Special Attack to maximize damage output (with 4 Speed to outrun minimum Speed Metagross and KO with Hydro Pump). When this Politoed is paired up with multiple Swift Swim users such as Kingdra and Kabutops, it can quickly overwhelm the opponent's defenses. This is also the set for any team that is running Politoed as an anti-weather measure and has no other Water-type Pokemon. Politoed can run maximum Speed to Speed tie Breloom and subsequently use Ice Beam before it can get off a Bullet Seed, but because most Breloom use Focus Sash, the EVs often end up being wasted. Water Gem variants can sacrifice a coverage move for a move from the support set's repertoire, but because the EVs are not optimized for survivability, they will not get as much use out of them. Alternatively, either variant can switch out Hidden Power Grass for Hidden Power Electric and invest 8 more Speed EVs to beat Gyarados; typically, though, Gyarados is less of a threat to rain teams (and less common) than Rotom-W and Gastrodon are. The last viable move is Surf, being Politoed's only spread move, but hitting its partner is very undesirable.</p> "

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Scizor might not hold the spot of a top threat in Doubles that it holds in Singles, but it remains a powerful adversary nonetheless. A great Bug / Steel typing allows Scizor to switch into common attacks in the Doubles metagame, such as Draco Meteor and Blizzard. Access to a Technician-boosted Bullet Punch allows Scizor to heavily damage several threats before they can attack, such as Mamoswine and Kyurem-B. Furthermore, a powerful Technician-boosted Bug Bite allows it to tear down Cresselia, and it fits well on rain teams since Bug Bite can also take down Tyranitar and Abomasnow. To top things off, Scizor can provide support for its team in numerous ways, such as setting up Tailwind or breaking Protect with Feint. It can also go all-out offensive with its classic Swords Dance set.</p> <p>However, a lot of factors hold Scizor back. The great resistances that its typing provides are offset by a mediocre Special Defense. A lack of coverage options outside of Superpower means that Fire-type threats can easily dispose of it. Its attacks often lack enough power to get key OHKOs without a boost. Finally, it has a low 65 base Speed, which means Speed control, such as Icy Wind, is a must if you want to make the most of it. Fortunately for Scizor, these setbacks do not change the fact that its useful Bug / Steel typing allows it to check some of the top threats in the Doubles metagame, such as Cresselia, Tyranitar, and Latios.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Scizor has a considerable number of other options to play with. Choice Band can provide it with as much power as possible, at the cost of Protect and locking you into a move, which makes it inferior to a Steel Gem or Bug Gem in most cases. Life Orb can provide consistent power without the drawbacks of Choice Band, but the recoil really puts a damper on Scizor's bulk. Natural Gift can be used alongside Occa Berry, as factoring in Technician, you will get a one-time 90 Base Power Fire-type attack. This is useful for hitting opposing Scizor and Ferrothorn harder, and still retains sufficient power against other Steel-types bar Heatran. Pursuit can also be used, as you can potentially deal a lot of damage to opponents like Cresselia that attempt to switch out. Roost can heal you, potentially extending longetivity, but Doubles is usually too fast-paced for such a move to ever pay off. Finally, Scizor can run Tailwind, preferably on a set with a bulkier spread. However, an offensive spread with Tailwind is also viable, since Scizor really benefits from the Tailwind boost and the extra power allows it to dish out heavy damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fire-types, especially Chandelure, Rotom-H, and Heatran, wall Scizor inside and out, and can easily roast it with their STAB Fire-type attacks. However, Heatran must be wary of Superpower. Intimidate weakens Scizor's offensive potential even further; Gyarados and Landorus-T in particular really ruin Scizor's day, as they both resist Bug Bite and Gyarados also resists Bullet Punch. Fast Water-types— Swift Swim abusers in particular— can put a hole in the bug with their Rain-boosted STAB attacks. Bulky Jellicent also gains a special mention, as it resists Scizor's STAB moves and can burn it with Scald or Will-O-Wisp. Thundurus and Zapdos resist both of Scizor's STAB attacks and can easily set up Tailwind, spam Thunder Wave, or simply take Scizor out with their attacks. Additionally, both sleep and burn cripple Scizor, making it an easy target to take out; just be careful around the Swords Dance set, as it occasionally runs Lum Berry. Scizor, in general, is not very bulky compared to other Steel-types, so as long as it doesn't pack a super effective attack you should be able to deal more damage to it than it does to you.</p> <p>Additionally, the Swords Dance set can be handled by good prediction and use of Protect, as it can only attack one target at a time. Taunt can also stop Scizor from using both Swords Dance and Protect, which makes it very ineffective.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set makes the most of Scizor's bulk and power. Bullet Punch provides Scizor with a very powerful priority attack and can deal a lot of damage to a wide array of threats, such as Tyranitar and Kyurem-B. The second slot can be filled with a number of options. Feint is one of the best, as it allows Scizor to break through Protect, easing prediction and putting the opposition in a tough spot. Superpower is another option, providing useful coverage against Steel-types, particularly Heatran. Bug Bite is a very interesting move, as it steals and eats berries. This means that Scizor can heal itself if the opponent is carrying a Sitrus Berry, remove type-resisting berries from numerous Pokemon, and so on. Protect is in the fourth slot as expected, allowing Scizor to stall while its partner takes out a potential threat.</p> <p>Steel Gem is the preferred item, increasing the power of Bullet Punch so that Scizor can take out a lot of weakened threats before they can attack. Occa Berry is also an option, however, as it allows Scizor to survive weaker Fire-type attacks, such as Hidden Power Fire from various threats and an unboosted Hydreigon's Flamethrower, but don't expect Occa Berry Scizor to tank stronger Fire-type attacks, as attacks like Modest Heatran's Heat Wave will still OHKO more than half of the time. U-turn is an option over Bug Bite, as it eases prediction and provides a safe switch-in thanks to Scizor's low base Speed, but it comes at the cost of a lot of power. Acrobatics is an option for the second slot, as it can take out a large array of threats, notably Volcarona, Amoonguss, Breloom, and Hitmontop. However, note that a Flying Gem is more or less required for the item should you choose to run Acrobatics. Aerial Ace accomplishes feats similar to those of Acrobatics, but with a huge loss of power in exchange for the ability to reliably run other items.</p> <p>This set can function effectively on almost any team, but it works to its best potential on bulkier teams because it can snipe fast and frail opponents with Bullet Punch. Trick Room setters, such as Jellicent and Cresselia, make for helpful teammates, as Trick Room can patch up Scizor's lacking Speed. If you opt to run something other than Superpower in the second slot, answers to Steel-types, such as Heatran and Conkeldurr, make for nice partners. Heatran in particular is a great partner, as it can absorb Fire-type attacks intended for Scizor. Mamoswine is a great partner as well, as it synergizes with Scizor offensively and its STAB attacks can help deal with Fire-type attackers, Landorus-T, Thundurus, Zapdos, and Thundurus-T, all of which give Scizor a lot of trouble. Similarly, Rotom-W can handle the majority of Scizor's counters, including Fire-types, Water-types, Gyarados, and Landorus-T. Latios works well with Scizor, as its Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor can OHKO a lot of Pokemon that threaten Scizor, including Landorus-T, Gyarados, Zapdos, Hitmontop, and Thundurus-T. Latios particularly enjoys this set's Feint support, which allows it to spam Draco Meteor with less risk. Finally, Thundurus-T can handle Water-types and Hitmontop, which give Scizor a lot of trouble.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set works simply: set up Swords Dance if given the opportunity, then proceed to KO as many Pokemon as possible. However, while Scizor's attacks are powerful after a Swords Dance, its low Speed and lack of sufficient bulk mean that you will need a lot of support to pull off a sweep of any kind. Bullet Punch is Scizor's best priority option, and can deal heavy damage to threats such as Tyranitar. Bug Bite is Scizor's best Bug-type STAB option and consumes any berry that its target might be holding. Protect rounds off the set, allowing Scizor to stall while its partner eliminates any threats to Scizor.</p> <p>Steel Gem is the preferred item, as a Steel Gem-boosted Bullet Punch is going to hurt, especially after a Swords Dance. Occa Berry is also an option, allowing Scizor to survive a weaker Fire-type attack such as an unboosted Flamethrower from Hydreigon. Note that even with an Occa Berry, attacks like Heatran's Heat Wave will still OHKO most of the time, so don't expect Scizor to endure stronger Fire-type attacks. Lum Berry is also plausible, as it will allow Scizor to avoid nasty paralysis, sleep, or burns.</p> <p>This set functions best on bulky teams, especially those that can provide the support needed in order to pull off a sweep. While its attacks are powerful after a Swords Dance boost, they have poor coverage, so partners that can take out Steel- and Fire-types, such as Landorus-T and Heatran, will be needed to make the most of Scizor's abilities. Mamoswine makes a great partner for Scizor, synergizing well with it offensively and taking out numerous Pokemon that can counter it, including Fire-types, Thundurus, Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Thundurus-T. Rotom-W is also useful for taking out threats such as Landorus-T and Heatran, as well as Gyarados and other Water-types. Thundurus-T can handle Water-types and Hitmontop, both of which give Scizor grief. This set also loves Speed control, such as Trick Room or Tailwind, since it allows Scizor to patch up its lackluster Speed and kill an opposing Pokemon with Bug Bite before it can attack. This set also enjoys Follow Me support; Togekiss in particular works very well with Scizor, drawing in attacks with Follow Me and setting up Tailwind for Scizor so that it can attack first. However, note that Follow Me will not help against Heat Wave.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Although Heracross is often overlooked when team building, it has several advantages over many common Pokemon in the Doubles metagame. With an amazing offensive typing, a base 125 Attack stat paired with two 120 Base Power STAB moves, and an amazing ability, Heracross can easily be a top offensive threat. Though it hits really hard, it lacks speed. Only possessing a base 85 Speed stat is a problem that will always haunt Heracross. If you can use speed control moves such as Tailwind, Thunder Wave, and Icy Wind to help support it, Heracross will easily be the M.V.P of its team almost every game.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There are many other interesting options that Heracross can put to use. Guts with a status orb is one of the main options, as it will instantly boost Heracross's Attack at the cost of residual damage. Night Slash and Pursuit can be used for a high critical hit chance and the ability to catch switching opponents, respectively. Bug Bite, while having half the power of Megahorn, can be used as a niche move to dispose of opponents' berries, such as Cresselia's Sitrus Berry or Chesto Berry. Swords Dance can be used as a boosting move for Heracross, but it's harder to pull off in the Doubles Metagame in comparison to singles. Heracross can also use a gimmicky combination in Endure, Salac Berry, and Reversal, giving it an extremely powerful STAB move, but be aware this would take a lot of support to pull off. Finally, Heracross can do more than attack: it can also support its teammates. Helping Hand is an option to help boost its teammates attacking power, and Sleep Talk can be used to make Heracross a sleep absorber, taking sleep-inducing moves from Pokemon such as Amoonguss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Heracross's main problem comes in the form of Intimidate users. Hitmontop, Gyarados, Salamence, and Landorus-T are all problems that it doesn't like to face, with the latter three being able to come in and lower Heracross's Attack while resisting its dual STAB combination. Pokemon such as Thundurus and Togekiss that can paralyze it are also major issues. Heracross cannot afford to have its Speed be lowered.</p> <p>Pokemon that are immune or resist Heracross's STAB moves and can OHKO back are bad news. Heracross can't actually touch Jellicent and Chandelure if it doesn't have Stone Edge or Rock Slide. Pokemon such as Latios and Volcarona can outspeed Heracross and OHKO with one of their STAB moves. Toxicroak, being resistant to both of Heracross's STABs, can hard-wall any variant of Heracross that doesn't carry Earthquake. Priority-using Pokemon, such as Scizor and Breloom, can easily revenge kills Heracross after a couple of Defense drops. Any Pokemon carrying a Flying-type move has a reason to bring worry to Heracross. Crobat, Tornadus, Landorus, Togekiss, Hidden Power Flying Salamence, and Thundurus can all OHKO Heracross without taking much damage. Finally, Pokemon such Dusknoir, Dusclops, and Sableye are all immune to Close Combat and don't take much from Megahorn; they can also burn Heracross and severely hinder its sweeping ability.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Heracross has one job and one job only, and that is to hit extremely hard. A Bug Gem boosted-Megahorn can OHKO a lot of Pokemon, such as Cresselia, 4 HP Kingdra, uninvested Politoed, and Tyranitar. If the Pokemon in question doesn't resist Megahorn, it will take major damage and might even get OHKOed. After picking up a KO by using one of the most powerful moves in the metagame in Megahorn, Moxie activates, giving Heracross an Attack boost to heighten the power of its already powerful attacks. Close Combat is used as Heracross's other STAB move, allowing it to hit Pokemon that resist Megahorn, such as Heatran and Ninetales, for heavy damage. Feint is used to help Heracross's partners, as it hits through Protect and makes the opposition vulnerable to another attack that turn. If Feint isn't appealing to you, however, Stone Edge can be used in the third moveslot; Stone Edge allows Heracross to hit Flying and Fire-type Pokemon that would otherwise be resistant or immune to its STAB combo, such as Chandelure and Volcarona, respectively. The final moveslot in this set goes to the most common move in Doubles, Protect: it is used to protect Heracross from Flying-type moves and powerful spread moves such as Rock Slide and Heat Wave while its partners dispose of the problem.</p> <p>An alternate EV spread of 208 HP / 116 Atk / 48 SpD / 136 Spe can be used as well. It allows Heracross to survive hits such as a Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolt from Thundurus-T and a Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor from Kingdra. The Attack EVs give Heracross enough power to OHKO Calm Cresselia with 116 Defense EVs 93% of the time. Finally, Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge to give Heracross a spread move; while it's not strong at first, after a boost or two from Moxie, Rock Slide becomes very powerful.</p> <p>Heracross's base 85 Speed stat can hinder it at times, which is why Pokemon who can control speed are great assets for it. Pokemon such as Thundurus, Togekiss, and Cresselia can not only control speed, but can also remove Flying- and Fighting-types, which allows Heracross to reach its full potential. Due to Heracross being an all-out physical attacker, Defiant Pokemon such as Tornadus and Bisharp make for good partners. Defiant discourages Intimidate-users from switching in, as Intimidate will actually give these Pokemon a boost, making it easy to take care of them. Faster Pokemon, such as Latios and Rotom-W, can also be used to remove Intimidate-users in addition to threats such as Victini and Volcarona. Heracross can also be used on a rain team; not only does rain halve its weakness to Fire-type attacks, but due to its amazing offensive coverage it can manage to defeat many common threats to rain such as Abomasnow, Tyranitar, Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, and Cresselia. Kingdra in the rain can also remove Pokemon that directly threaten Heracross.</p> "

Choice Scarf gives Heracross a much needed boost in the Speed stat, allowing it to outspeed every non-Choice Scarf Pokemon in the metagame. Megahorn and Close Combat are the two main moves of the set, both of which are base 120 STAB moves, meaning that Heracross can hit opposing teams extremely hard. The choice between Rock Slide and Stone Edge is a hard one. Rock Slide is a spread move that will hit both opponents and has a chance to flinch, whereas Stone Edge isn't blocked by Wide Guard and has more power. Earthquake is used in the last slot because it's another spread move that allows Heracross to hit Pokemon such as Toxicroak for super effective damage while hitting the opponents as well. The only downfall to Earthquake is that it runs the risk of hitting Heracross's teammate as well. Finally, it's worth mentioning that this Heracross variant CANNOT OHKO the standard Cresselia.</p> <p>Follow Me and Rage Powder support will allow Heracross to live longer and take advantage of the free hits its partner will give it. Pokemon such as Jirachi, Togekiss, and Amoonguss are all good teammates because of this. Helping Hand, a move that will boost the attacking power of Heracross, can also be used to further support it. Cresselia, Politoed, and Togekiss can all use this move to great effect. Intimidate is going to be a problem because Heracross relies so heavily on physical attacks, so Pokemon with the ability Defiant can be used to discourage Pokemon with Intimidate from switching in freely. Faster teammates such as Latios and Rotom-W can be used to remove Intimidate-users as well as Pokemon such as Victini and Volcarona. Just like before, being on a rain team is also a viable option for Heracross, as it helps directly threaten many Pokemon that are a problem to rain; Pokemon such as Abomasnow, Gastrodon, Tyranitar, Rotom-W, and Cresselia can all be easily removed by it.</p> "

However, Doubles has now allowed Kingdra to live up to its title as 'King of the Dragons'. Even if it does have middling offensive stats, Swift Swim allows it to become a fearsome sweeper under rain that can drown unprepared opponents with Muddy Water or show fellow Dragon-types who is king with powerful Draco Meteors. Kingdra has a very good offensive and defensive typing, as Water and Dragon hits everything in the metagame for neutral damage except for Empoleon and Ferrothorn and resists Surf and Heat Wave while being neutral to all other spread moves. Kingdra also has usable bulk, which can help it to survive some hits. However, being a Swift Swim user, Kingdra absolutely hates paralysis, which slows it down completely and means that other Pokemon have an easy time outspeeding and beating it down. This is only a real problem with Thundurus running rampant in the metagame whose Prankster Thunder Wave bypasses Kingdra's blistering Speed and gets a guaranteed paralysis on it. Also, Kingdra really needs rain to function properly, and without rain support, you are better off using other Dragon-types such as Latios, which is faster and has a much stronger base 130 Special Attack stat. But if you are able to use Kingdra to its strengths and avoid paralysis, it will prove to be the king of the Dragons.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Dragon Dance set is an option with Outrage and Waterfall, but Kingdra will very rarely find opportunities to set up, as it will usually be the most threatening Pokemon on the field and will be subject to a lot of double targeting. Also, Outrage is a very bad move in Doubles, as its target cannot be chosen, which can easily cost its user games. Kingdra also can't effectively use the its signature spread move Muddy Water on a Dragon Dance set. A mixed set is also an option as Kingdra can lure out Pokemon such as Heatran and Landorus after using Draco Meteor and then hit them hard with Waterfall even after the Special Attack drop, but Kingdra is then forced to split attacking EVs, lowering the power of its special attacks. A supporting set is a viable option for Kingdra with Quash and Disable, but there are better Pokemon to use as supporters. Rain Dance is a viable move to back up Politoed in setting up rain or to disrupt opposing weathers on a weatherless team, but Kingdra then has to forgo Hydro Pump, losing power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Despite Kingdra's unmatched sweeping potential in the rain, Doubles has a handful of options to take it on. Ferrothorn and Empoleon both wall Kingdra, resisting both its STABs and taking little damage from them. Ferrothorn can hit back hard with a strong Power Whip as well. Gastrodon and Jellicent are second-in-line when it comes to sponging moves from Kingdra, as they are immune to its STAB Water-type moves, forcing it to resort to a single-target Draco Meteor. Jellicent can even flip the tables by setting up Trick Room. They must both be wary of Helping Hand support from Politoed, as it provides Kingdra's Life Orb Draco Meteor with enough power to score an OHKO. Although not immune to Kingdra's Rain-boosted Muddy Water or Hydro Pump, Amoonguss resists them, and can either redirect Kingdra's Dragon-type moves with Rage Powder or threaten to put it to sleep with Spore. Generally specially defensive Pokemon, such as Cresselia, Togekiss, and Dusclops, can tank a hit and threaten to take away Kingdra's speed advantage with Trick Room, Tailwind, Sunny Day, Skill Swap, or Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Another notable counter-strategy to Kingdra's rain offense is to take away the dreary weather. Tyranitar can switch into a predicted Protect, Dragon-type move, or Substitute from Kingdra and set up sand, stopping it from using Swift Swim. Ninetales and Abomasnow also set up other weathers, so they stop Kingdra's stormy tempest as well. Manual weather inducers, such as Sunny Day Cresselia and Sunny Day Whimsicott are additional major disruptions.</p> <p>However, altering the weather is not the only way to remove Kingdra's speed advantage. Thundurus can slow Kingdra right down with Prankster Thunder Waves, hitting before it can move and making it near useless against opposing Dragon-types. It can also hit Kingdra with strong Thunderbolts. Tornadus can summon an emergency Prankster Tailwind before Kingdra can knock it out, allowing fast Pokemon to get a hit on Kingdra before it can make a move. Bulky Pokemon mentioned in the first paragraph, such as Cresselia, Jellicent, Dusclops, Ferrothorn, and Togekiss, have various speed-altering means to slow down Kingdra to manageable levels. For instance, Cresselia is a hard Pokemon to break, as it can take any hit and set up Trick Room or use Thunder Wave, both slowing Kingdra down completely; it even learns Skill Swap to steal Swift Swim from Kingdra and swap it to its partner. Jellicent and Dusclops both have Trick Room, and Ferrothorn and Togekiss have access to Thunder Wave.</p> ",

        "name": "Rain Attacker",
        "description": "<p>The aim of this set is to do as much damage as possible to its opponents, not giving them any chance to retaliate by using powerful STAB attacks. Muddy Water is a very powerful STAB attack under rain, hitting both opponents hard and OHKOing everything that is weak to it. It also has a 30% chance to lower your opponent's accuracy by one stage, which can provide your team with chances to dodge enemy attacks and wreak more havoc. Draco Meteor is another powerful STAB attack, which deals massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it and beats other Dragon-types easily. This provides great neutral coverage alongside Muddy Water, being resisted by only Ferrothorn and Empoleon, the latter of which is rarely seen in Doubles. Hydro Pump adds more power to the set and is useful for clearing out single threats on the opposing team rather than just dealing damage, hitting Ferrothorn and Empoleon harder than any of Kingdra's other moves on this set, and bypassing Wide Guard. Substitute can be used over Hydro Pump, as Kingdra already has a Water attack and the move can protect it from status, but Hydro Pump is very powerful under rain and it might be harder to remove single threats from the field with only a spread Water-type move, not to mention that Prankster Thunder Waves can still get Kingdra before it gets a Substitute up. Protect is standard on any non-Choiced Pokemon in Doubles because it blocks potentially fatal attacks and the omnipresent Fake Out. It is even more useful on Kingdra, as it will be subject to a lot more double targeting because it will usually be the most threatening Pokemon on your side of the field. Life Orb is used to give power to every attack and help deal more damage, which is the premise of this set. Even though custom EV spreads are quite common in Doubles play, a standard 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe is used to maximize the offensive presence of the set.</p> <p>Alternatively, 40 EVs can be moved from the Speed stat into HP to increase bulk, as 216 Speed EVs ensure that it still outspeeds Adamant Kabutops, the second fastest Swift Swim user. A Timid nature is also an option if you are scared about opposing Kingdra and want to Speed tie with other Timid ones. However, that is only one Pokemon, and Modest provides a very nice power boost that Kingdra appreciates with it's average Special Attack. If you don't ever want to miss, then Surf is a viable choice over Muddy Water, as it has the same Base Power but is 100% accurate. However, it hits Kingdra's ally too, meaning you need to have a Pokemon that can benefit from Surf, or at least 4x resist it. Dragon Gem can be used over Life Orb as it allows Kingdra to nuke the opponent once with an extremely strong Draco Meteor and avoid recoil each time it attacks, but it then loses power for all of its attacks, lowering its sweeping ability. Lum Berry is a good option to use with Substitute, as the item cures paralysis from Prankster Thunder Wave once while Kingdra sets up a Substitute to temporarily avoid future ones, letting it sweep more easily, but without Hydro Pump or Life Orb, Kingdra will not be doing as much damage as it can. However, the chance to avoid status is a very good trade-off for power, and rain-boosted Muddy Waters and Draco Meteors will be doing good damage anyway. Haban Berry can be used to survive a single Dragon Claw or Dragon Pulse, but again, the loss in power is noticeable, and Haban Berry won't save Kingdra from a strong Dragon attack, such as Latios's Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Politoed is of course an essential partner for Kingdra, as it sets up permanent rain with its ability, Drizzle, which allows Kingdra to utilize Swift Swim to its maximum potential. It also has Helping Hand to boost Kingdra's already powerful attacks and turn it into a very scary Pokemon. Ground-types such as Garchomp are also good partners to sponge Thunder Waves, which they are immune to, as Kingdra hates them. Thundurus-T gets a special mention as well because of its ability, Volt Absorb, which heals 25% of its HP when it is hit with an Electric attack. It also benefits from rain, which you should always use Kingdra in, because it gets to spam 100% accurate STAB Thunders coming off a colossal base 145 Special Attack stat. Although uncommon, Manectric is a good partner for Kingdra, being able to draw Thunder Waves away from it with Lightningrod and get a Special Attack boost from them. It can also beat Ferrothorn with Overheat or Flamethrower and use Thunder in rain to act as good rain sweeper. Fighting-types such as Breloom and Hitmontop are also helpful as they can rid Kingdra of Ferrothorn and Empoleon, which both wall its dual STAB. Breloom loses its Fire weakness and, with its Grass typing, can also beat Gastrodon, which checks Kingdra. Hitmontop provides Fake Out and Intimidate support, which is useful for any Doubles team. It also has Helping Hand and Feint to better allow Kingdra to sweep. Pokemon with abilities such as Storm Drain and Water Absorb that benefit from Water-type attacks also serve as good partners to Kingdra running Surf. Ludicolo also gets a mention in this regard, 4x resisting Surf. Follow Me and Rage Powder users are also very good partners to Kingdra, as they can redirect Thunder Waves and Dragon moves, which Kingdra hates, allowing it to sweep more easily. Jirachi and Amoonguss are good here, the former resisting super effective Dragon-type attacks and the latter resisting neutral Electric- and Fighting-type moves, while also having Spore and Giga Drain to beat Gastrodon.</p> "

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar is possibly the best weather summoner in Doubles due not only to its ability to check some of the best Pokemon the metagame has to offer, such as Cresselia and Thundurus, but also because of its amazing movepool. Tyranitar has many powerful attacks such as Crunch, Rock Slide, and Fire Blast. The main problem that Tyranitar faces is its less-than-stellar defensive typing, as being 4x weak to Fighting-type moves in Doubles is a very bad thing with threats such as Hitmontop being prominent. Despite its glaring weakness to Fighting-types, Tyranitar's phenomenal special bulk complemented with its high offensive stats makes it a versatile special tank in Doubles.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar doesn't only bring sand to the battlefield; it can also support its teammates in other ways. Tyranitar gets some very appealing support moves that don't see much use. Thunder Wave can help with speed control, something every team benefits from. Roar and Dragon Tail both have higher priorities than Trick Room, and could be used as a way to stop the opposition from getting it up. Stone Edge could be used in conjunction with Rock Slide to give Tyranitar the ability to hit for spread damage and also avoid Wide Guard problems at the expense of some coverage. Finally, Tyranitar gets access to Taunt, a move that can be used to shut down Pokemon such Togekiss and Cresselia and stop them from supporting their teammates. A Dark or Rock Gem could be used over Focus Sash to pick up OHKOs Tyranitar normally wouldn't be able to achieve. Unnerve Tyranitar can stop Pokemon from eating resistance Berries, ensuring that it and its teammates can get KOs on Pokemon that would otherwise survive thanks to their Berries.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Tyranitar has a few major counters that it has problems dealing with. Firstly, Fighting-type Pokemon such as Terrakion, Breloom, and Conkeldurr are a major issue. They all have the ability to hit Tyranitar for 4x damage, which isn't good. Intimidate users are another large problem for it. Pokemon such Hitmontop, Landorus-T, and Scrafty can all lower Tyranitar's Attack, forcing it to rely on special attacks to deal damage. Hitmontop also gets Wide Guard, which stops Rock Slide cold. The final major problem Tyranitar faces is Ground-types, such as Garchomp. Opposing sand sweepers with Sand Force, such as Excadrill and Landorus, are especially threatening due to their boosted Earthquakes.</p> <p>One of the problems Tyranitar faces that isn't as fatal as the above is rain. Tyranitar can keep weather on its side in some cases, but in others rain can be up and be very problematic. Pokemon such as Politoed, Kingdra, and Ludicolo will all have boosted STABs thanks to the rain they often bring with them. Toxicroak is also a common Pokemon on rain teams that can switch in on Tyranitar with impunity. Rotom-W is another Water-type bulky enough to switch in and threaten Tyranitar out.</p> <p>Finally, Pokemon with powerful STABs, such as Jirachi, Scizor, Bisharp, Metagross, Escavalier, and Genesect, can all hit Tyranitar for heavy damage depending on its set. However, if Tyranitar is carrying Fire Blast, it can handle these Pokemon fairly easily, but they should be accounted for by teammates anyway.</p> ",

        "name": "Standard",
        "description": "<p>Rock Slide is standard on any set Tyranitar will run; as a powerful spread move with STAB, it lets Tyranitar deal with many common Pokemon in the Doubles metagame. Crunch is used as a single target move that hits foes extremely hard; however, Fire Blast is also a viable, as Tyranitar will have trouble hurting Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Scizor without it. Low Kick is used to OHKO Pokemon such as Bisharp and other Tyranitar, and also 2HKO very prominent threats such as Hydreigon.</p> <p>Winning the weather war is just as, if not more, important in Doubles than it is in Singles. As Tyranitar is going to be slower than most Pokemon, you might as well take advantage of its less-than-stellar Speed stat. By using a Brave nature with 0 IVs in Speed, Tyranitar will win the weather war 100% of the time (at least initially). As for the EV spread, 36 EVs are used in Defense so that Tyranitar can survive an unboosted Meteor Mash from Metagross.</p> <p>Chople Berry is the best choice of item for this set, as Tyranitar has a very exploitable weakness to Fighting-type attacks that Pokemon such as Breloom and Hitmontop can easily take advantage of otherwise. Tyranitar is excellent at supporting its teammates thanks to its amazing ability Sand Stream. Sandstorm alone provides great support for Pokemon such as Excadrill and Landorus, making them feared sweepers, but it also gives Rock-type Pokemon a 50% boost to their Special Defense stat, meaning that Pokemon such as Terrakion will be able to live a super effective Psychic-type attack from Cresselia or Latios. As good a teammate as Tyranitar can be, it needs help as well. Due to its 4x weakness to Fighting-type attacks, fast Psychic-types such Latios and Latias make good teammates. Rain is also a very large problem that Tyranitar cannot deal with alone. Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, Breloom, and Gastrodon all help with the removal of common rain sweepers.</p> <p>There are a few other moves that Tyranitar could run besides the ones listed. For example, Stone Edge, a single-target attack, is far more powerful than Rock Slide and isn't stopped by Wide Guard. If the accuracy of Fire Blast is something that causes you to shy away from using it, Flamethrower can be used in its place. Though not as strong, it won't miss at a crucial moment in the match. Finally, Substitute can be used to shield Tyranitar from Fighting-type attacks. Because it is so slow, Tyranitar will need a free turn to set one up, so Fake Out users such as Hitmontop and Scrafty are good partners. It's also recommended to use Leftovers on Tyranitar when using Substitute, as Chople Berry would then be a waste of Tyranitar's item slot.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Tyranitar is one of the biggest threats in Doubles. Not only does it support its team with sand, but it's also fast enough to damage opponents before getting damaged itself. Rock Slide is the main move on the set, allowing Tyranitar to hit both opponents and also giving it an opportunity to flinch them. Crunch is the secondary STAB move, offering a way to hit Cresselia, Latios, and Latias hard. The Superpower vs Low Kick decision is up to you. Superpower hits Pokemon such as Hydreigon for an OHKO while Low Kick is a 2HKO, but Superpower also lowers Tyranitar's Attack and Defense stats every time it's used. Low Kick is a safer option, and despite being weaker, it has an advantage in stopping you from worrying about Tyranitar's stats being lowered. Fire Blast allows Tyranitar to hit Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Scizor for super effective damage, while Ice Beam hits a few Pokemon harder than Rock Slide would. Factoring in Intimidate, Ice Beam covers Tyranitar's weakness to Salamence and Landorus-T.</p> <p>76 EVs in HP let Tyranitar live a +1 Bullet Punch from Scizor 100% of the time, and max Speed allows it to outspeed base 111s, most notably Thundurus. The remaining EVs are put into Attack to let Tyranitar do as much damage as possible.</p> <p>Tyranitar can use Earthquake on this set as well; it's an alternate spread move, though it's not as strong as Tyranitar would like it to be and it also comes with the drawback of hitting Tyranitar's grounded teammates. Stone Edge is stronger than Rock Slide and is a single-target move, though it has worse accuracy. The main benefit that Stone Edge brings is the ability to still hit Pokemon when an opponent uses Wide Guard. Fire Punch shouldn't be used because Fire Blast from an uninvested Special Attack still does more damage with this spread and, with Intimidate being such a commonly used ability, it's likely that Tyranitar's Attack will be lowered.</p> <p>Tyranitar's main goal with this set is to be faster than its opponents; the only problem with that is that it means Tyranitar's going to lose the initial weather war. This means that teammates that help deal with opposing weather are crucial to ensure victory. Because rain is going to be a large problem, Pokemon such a Thundurus and Rotom-W can paralyze and take little damage from most Pokemon commonly used in rain are very useful. Gastrodon can't be touched by any Water-type attack, making it a good choice. Defiant Tornadus deserves a special mention as it directly counters all Intimidate users and Fighting-type Pokemon at the same time. Landorus, Hitmontop, Scrafty, Gyarados, and Salamence cannot switch in freely like they otherwise would be able to with it on the field.</p> "

Crunch is used to hit Psychic-types, such as Cresselia, Latias, and Latios, and Ghost-types, such as Jellicent and Chandelure, for super effective damage. Low Kick allows Tyranitar to beat opposing Tyranitar and a Pokemon it would normally lose to: Terrakion. Superpower can also be used to hit some Pokemon harder but at the cost of lowering Tyranitar's Attack and Defense every time it's used.</p> <p>Tyranitar is a creature of the sand and it's not a fan of being in anything else. Rain teams are always a problem for faster variants of Tyranitar, so you need to build your team accordingly. Pokemon that are hard counters to rain are very good partners for a faster Tyranitar; Pokemon such as Thundurus, Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Breloom are all excellent choices and stop rain in multiple ways. Tyranitar also brings a weather of its own to the field, so we cannot forget about Pokemon such Excadrill and Landorus, who both benefit greatly from sandstorm support.</p> <p>Focus Sash opens up many different possibilities for Tyranitar, the first of which is Dragon Dance. Dragon Dance boosts Tyranitar's Attack and Speed at the same time, making it as fast as the Choice Scarf set but with the ability to switch moves and deal serious damage.

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ludicolo has a very interesting movepool that is capable of surprising opponents. While somewhat gimmicky, Sunny Day can be used to give Ludicolo a place on sun teams, outspeeding normally faster Pokemon with Swift Swim in order to set up sun for its team. Teeter Dance is also an interesting option for support, especially in Doubles, where it can confuse both opponents by launching the fastest Teeter Dance in the game. A bulkier set could also be considered, taking advantage of Ludicolo's other ability, Rain Dish. When combined with Leftovers and Leech Seed, Ludicolo becomes great for rain stall. However, this set is usually outclassed by offensive sets which take out opposing Pokemon more efficiently. In terms of held items, Lum Berry is worth considering as it stops Thunder Wave from affecting Ludicolo too greatly. For example, Ludicolo can take a Thunder Wave from Thundurus, then set up a Substitute to prevent further status. A Sitrus Berry could help Ludicolo take another hit and avoid some 2HKOs, though a more offensive item is usually better. Finally, a Tanga Berry can catch opponents by surprise and let Ludicolo survive a hit from Genesect.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Anything that gets rid of rain are good choices for stopping Ludicolo, ridding it of its Rain support; Abomasnow is particularly difficult for Ludicolo to eliminate on its own as it removes Rain with Hail.

Toxicroak switches into Ludicolo with relative impunity thanks to its immunity to Ludicolo's Surf and resistances to Giga Drain.

Giga Drain is a good secondary STAB move, providing Ludicolo with a way to hit Pokemon such as Rotom-W that resist Surf, and helping to keep Ludicolo healthy. Fake Out keeps momentum going and provides some support to Ludicolo's teammates. It's also essential for Ludicolo's survival, as it keeps Ludicolo's counters occupied while its teammate take them out. Ice Beam rounds out Ludicolo's already great coverage, allowing it to hit Dragon- and Grass-types super effectively. Protect is a slightly odd option on such an offensive Pokemon, but it helps keep Ludicolo alive while teammates take out its would-be counters. It also helps in stalling out precious turns of Tailwind and Trick Room that would take away Ludicolo's speed advantage.

Scald could be used as a more reliable targeting STAB move. The chance of burn is also great for aiding teams which are weak to physical threats.</p> <p>Politoed is the best teammate for Ludicolo, as it sets up rain and can increase Ludicolo's damage output with Helping Hand. Hitmontop is also noteworthy due to its ability to scare off other weather setters, such as Abomasnow and Tyranitar, as well as its ability to take out some counters to Ludicolo, such as Kyurem-B, with Close Combat. Hydreigon is a great wallbreaker to get rid of Kyurem-B, Cresselia, Dusknoir, Ferrothorn, and other walls hoping to end Ludicolo's sweep.

Its typing allows it to be a solid offensive check to sand and rain teams and also lets it defeat Rotom-W and Gastrodon.

Despite its flaws, however, Breloom can be a very annoying Pokemon to deal with in Doubles.</p> ",

Helping Hand can be useful for helping Breloom's partner, and Substitute can take advantage of Breloom's ability to force switches.

Dragonite can tank any hit if Multiscale is intact and KO Breloom with a variety of moves. Latios and Latias can wall Breloom completely (outside of Spore) and can KO it with relative ease; Heracross can do the same.

Other priority users, such as Weavile, Scizor, and Mamoswine, can also KO Breloom rather easily. Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Landorus-T and Salamence, can weaken Breloom and then KO it. Bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia and Dusclops can also sponge any hit Breloom can dish out. Due to Breloom's middling Speed stat, many Pokemon in the metagame are faster than it, meaning they can easily KO it so long as they are able to tank a Mach Punch; Jirachi and Garchomp are examples of Pokemon that can do this. Sableye can Taunt Breloom to stop Spore and then Will-O-Wisp it to incapacitate it. Cloyster can OHKO Breloom with Icicle Spear, which also conveniently bypasses Focus Sash.

Bullet Seed is Breloom's other STAB move, and it hits extremely hard. Being a multi-hit move makes it especially useful, as it can bypass the opposition's Substitutes.

However, Life Orb is the preferred option over Focus Sash, as it gives Breloom a power boost it greatly appreciates. Focus Sash can also be broken by sandstorm, making it less reliable; however, it does often allow for a guaranteed Spore, making it very useful at times.

Breloom fits well on rain teams, as it can defeat Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Rotom-W that would otherwise cause problems; Breloom also defeats Abomasnow and Tyranitar, allowing the rain to stay on the field. Other good partners for Breloom include Pokemon who have access to moves such as Tailwind and Icy Wind, as these moves can help make up for Breloom's poor Speed stat; Suicune is a great example of a Pokemon that can fill this role.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Hariyama is the definition of a Trick Room Pokemon. Thanks to Fake Out, it can directly support Trick Room setters as well as activating its ability, Guts, on the same turn, making it a very potent threat. What sets Hariyama apart from other Trick Room Fighting-Type Pokemon is its access to Close Combat and Fake Out. Though Hitmontop has both, it doesn't have the massive base 144 HP stat or the sheer power Hariyama has. However, Hariyama struggles outside of Trick Room and takes a lot of residual damage from Toxic and weather. Despite this, it should not be overlooked for a team, as it has the power and bulk to do lots of damage.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thanks to a very diverse movepool, Hariyama has many neat tricks it can pull off in battle. Hariyama can play many different supporting roles thanks to a few surprise factor moves. Helping Hand will allow your teammates to have powered-up attacks for a turn, while Rain Dance and Sunny Day can be used for manual weather. Brick Break is an alternative to Close Combat and can dispose of enemy screens, should only be used if Hariyama fears the defense drops from Close Combat. Fling, when paired with an Iron Ball, will allow Hariyama to deal major damage to bulky Psychic and Ghost-type Pokemon it would otherwise not be able to touch. Finally, Belly Drum can be used to give Hariyama an insane Attack boost. The last thing worth mentioning is that Hariyama can use two different abilities in place of Guts. Thick Fat allows it to play a more defensive role, letting it tank Ice- and Fire-type attacks easier. Sheer Force boosts the power of moves such as Rock Slide and the elemental punches without fear of Life Orb recoil. Be warned though, as Sheer Force also removes the flinch from Fake Out.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Psychic and Ghost-type Pokemon will be the biggest problem Hariyama will face. Pokemon like Cresselia, Musharna, Dusclops, and Jellicent wall most of, if not all sets that Hariyama can run. Intimidate users that aren't weak to its attacks are also a problem, such as Gyarados.</p> <p>Hariyama's bulk is amazing, but it still takes heavy damage from super effective attacks; Flying- and Psychic-types always directly threaten it. Examples include Acrobatics from Pokemon like Tornadus and Crobat as well as Air Slash and Hidden Power Flying From Togekiss, Thundurus, and Salamence. Latios, Latias, and Reuniclus all have powerful Psychic-type STABs that deal major damage to it as well. The last thing that counters Hariyama, though indirectly, are Pokemon that can stop Trick Room from getting set up. Double Taunters are one of the few things that stop a Hariyama and Trick Room setting lead, and Hariyama struggles outside of Trick Room and will be taken down fairly quickly.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Hariyama is a Pokemon that will usually be seen on more offensive versions of Trick Room teams. Thanks to Fake Out, Hariyama will be great support in helping it get set up. Once Trick Room is set up, Hariyama is now a feared attacker thanks to its Guts ability that will activate the turn Fake Out is used. Close Combat is the most powerful STAB option Hariyama has and lets it deal major damage to anything not immune or resistant to Fighting-type attacks. Stone Edge allows you to hit Flying-type Pokemon such as Zapdos and Tornadus harder than Ice Punch would, but Ice Punch gives you coverage against Dragon and Grass-Type Pokemon like Latios and Latias, as well as Landorus, which doesn't take much from Stone Edge. There are a few moves that can be used in the third moveslot. Detect is used instead of Protect on Fighting-types to guard from Pokemon using Imprison as well as attacks. Feint is an interesting move to be used in Trick Room, allowing Hariyama's teammates to hit opponents that are trying to Protect stall Trick Room turns, while Wide Guard will be used to protect Pokemon like Chandelure from very common spread moves that they're weak to. The EV spread on this set allows Hariyama to tank attacks from a few common Pokemon. It will be able to live an unboosted Zen Headbutt from Metagross 100% of the time, as well as living a non Gem-Boosted Acrobatics from Tornadus 75% of the time factoring in damage from after-turn effects. This set also runs 0 Speed IVs as well as a Speed-reducing nature to ensure that Hariyama is as fast as possible in Trick Room.</p> <p>Hariyama has great typing synergy with most Trick Room setters. Pokemon like Cresselia, Chandelure, and Jellicent all share a weakness to common Dark-type Pokemon like Tyranitar and Scrafty, both of which Hariyama can easily handle. Thanks to Guts's 1.5 attack boost, Haiyiama doesn't worry about Intimidate Pokemon like other physical threats do. Toxic Orb is superior to Flame Orb since Hariyama is very rarely alive long enough for the residual poison to begin out-damaging the burn. Hariyama has a couple of other moves that it can utilize, such as Rock Slide, which provides it with the ability to hit both opponents simultaneously and provides a chance to flinch. ThunderPunch lets Hariyama break through Water-Type Pokemon such as Jellicent and Gyarados.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>With a fantastic ability in Intimidate, a wide attacking movepool, and high attacking stats, Salamence is a fearsome beast seemingly made for Doubles. It also has access to Tailwind, making it a unique support Pokemon combined with Intimidate. Thanks to its huge offensive stats, it has no problem going dedicated special or mixed and still wreaking havoc. Be sure not to use Salamence as an inferior Garchomp or Kyurem-B, which have a wider physical movepool and higher offensive stats are higher, respectively. Salamence is faster than Kyurem-B and has a much higher Special Attack than Garchomp, so cater to these characteristics.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Salamence has an enormous movepool for an offensive Pokemon. Aqua Tail is an option for mixed Salamence, especially if used in the rain. A pure physical set with Dragon Claw, Crunch, Stone Edge, and Earthquake may work. Dragon Dance is an option, especially with Moxie, but Salamence does not want to give its opponents any free turns and Intimidate is a much more consistent an supportive ability in doubles. Don't even think about using Outrage, as its lack of targeting and the need for Salamence to be locked in for 2 or 3 turns does not make up for its power; Kyurem-B does this much better anyway. Focus Sash gives Salamence a guaranteed attack outside of getting slapped by Fake Out, but the lack of power is disappointing. Haban Berry can be used to let Salamence survive a hit from Kingdra's Dragon Pulse and OHKO back with Draco Meteor, but Kingdra's Draco Meteor will still OHKO Salamence. Flying Gem powers up Hidden Power Flying, but leaves Salamence's other attacks underpowered. Finally, a bulky Dragon Tail set can be used, allowing Salamence to stop Trick Room users before they even have a chance to set up, coupled with Roost for immediate recovery. However, Dragon Tail's -3 priority leaves it open to your opponent's partner to attack it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Mamoswine is the probably the best check to Salamence, OHKOing any variant lacking a Yache Berry. It is severely weakened by Draco Meteor or Hydro Pump, however. Ferrothorn laughs at Salamence's Dragon-type moves, but Fire Blast or Heat Wave will OHKO it outside of rain. Cresselia can survive hits from all but the Choice Specs set and can use Icy Wind for Speed control, hitting Salamence very hard and crippling it. Dusclops with even minimal Special Defense investment can take two Draco Meteors outside of Modest variants with Dragon Gem or Choice Specs and drain its PP quickly with Pressure, set up Trick Room, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, or recover off the damage with Pain Split. Genesect with a Choice Scarf can take care of Salamence with Ice Beam, but it must watch out for Choice Scarf Salamence, which can OHKO it with a Fire-type move. Latios is faster and can rip Salamence to shreds with its own Dragon-type attacks. Tyranitar takes a pittance from any of Salamence's attacks outside of Earthquake and can hit it back hard with Rock Slide. Terrakion can do similarly, but it must have sand support to take Salamence's special attacks with as much ease as Tyranitar. Ice-type attacks in general, even Hidden Power Ice from threats like offensive Thundurus, will make short work of any Salamence not running Yache Berry. Choice Scarf Abomasnow can outspeed it destroy it with its powerful STAB Blizzard. Rain sweepers such as Kingdra, Ludicolo, and Kabutops can all outspeed Salamence and OHKO with their super effective attacks.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Salamence's base 110 Special Attack works wonders with Salamence's wide special movepool, allowing it to fire off devastating Draco Meteors at will, as well as provide your team a nice spread move in Heat Wave. Fire Blast can be used over Heat Wave, however, to nail Occa Berry Scizor and Metagross, OHKOing the former and 2HKOing the latter. The extra power is especially appreciated if Salamence is running a Timid nature. Hidden Power Flying is a reliable STAB, picking off Pokemon weak to it, such as Breloom and Hitmontop, without having to suffer from a Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor or rely on an inaccurate Fire-type attack. However, Tailwind provides vital team support and is especially useful if Salamence is using a Modest nature. Protect is as useful as ever in doubles for avoiding an attack whenever necessary, but make sure not to overuse it when Tailwind is up, or you risk stalling out your Tailwind turns.</p> <p>Dragon Gem is the primary item, maximizing Draco Meteor's power, but Yache Berry lets Salamence take Mamoswine's Ice-type attacks more easily, most importantly Ice Shard. Follow Me Jirachi makes for an excellent partner, resisting both Ice- and Dragon-type attacks that threaten Salamence's life while giving Salamence a free shot at Kingdra if it's raining. Volcarona makes for a great partner as well, with Rage Powder redirecting resisted Ice-type attacks, and potentially burning physical contact attacks such as Scizor's Bullet Punch and Mamoswine's Ice Shard.</p> <p>There are a few additional options that Salamence can use on this set. Life Orb boosts Salamence's other attacks, but the recoil damage combined with hail or sand really shortens Salamence's lifespan. Flamethrower is a more accurate Fire-type attack, but lacks the spread capabilities of Heat Wave and the raw destructive power of Fire Blast.</p> "

Draco Meteor is an extremely powerful STAB move, and the Special Attack drop is not as devastating since Salamence can rely on its physical attacks after the drop. Earthquake is a straightforward spread move, providing excellent all-around coverage, as well as nailing Heatran and hitting Tyranitar for decent damage. Dragon Claw is a powerful STAB move and provides great coverage alongside Earthquake. Tailwind is great to boost both Salamence and your team's Speed for a short while, whereas Protect is used for general prediction.</p> <p>Naive is the preferred nature, as it allows Salamence to survive Mamoswine's Ice Shard after the Attack drop from Intimidate. The given Special Attack EVs guarantee that Draco Meteor will OHKO offensive Thundurus, while still maximizing Salamence's Speed. The rest are dumped into Attack to give Dragon Claw and Earthquake as much power as possible. The item choice is pretty straightforward. Life Orb boosts Salamence's offenses even further, while Yache Berry allows it to stick around and take more Ice-type attacks if necessary.</p> "

With Choice Scarf, Salamence turns into a great revenge killer and potential late-game cleaner. A Modest nature gives Salamence maximum power while letting it outspeed 76 Speed Ludicolo in the rain and is almost guaranteed to land an OHKO with a Helping Hand-boosted Hidden Power Flying, which hits just as hard as Draco Meteor because it is super effective, but without the Special Attack drop. Salamence also outspeeds other common Choice Scarf users, with a 56% chance to OHKO 224 HP Mamoswine with Hydro Pump and a guaranteed OHKO on Abomasnow and neutral-natured Genesect with its Fire-type move of choice.</p> <p>Choice Specs, on the other hand, makes Salamence an absolute nuke. Unlike Dragon Gem, Salamence can launch multiple Draco Meteors, switching out and coming back in when its Special Attack has dropped too far. Every shaky OHKO and nearly all 2HKOs from previously unboosted attacks are now guaranteed with the Choice Specs boost. Choice Specs Salamence, like most Choice Specs users, is best played as a hole puncher: choose whichever move hits your opponent, or a predicted switch-in, for the most damage. After a Special Attack drop or two, or if locked into an unfavorable attack, switch out Salamence and bring it in later for further firepower and Intimidate support.</p> <p>Timid may be used for the Choice Scarf set, allowing Salamence to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T, but can only OHKO it with Hydro Pump, and it misses out on a lot of the OHKOs that Modest brings. Helping Hand support makes up for the lack of power boost with Scarf, and makes Choice Specs Draco Meteor that much scarier, 2HKOing 252 / 192+ Cresselia even with a Timid nature. Modest can be used with Choice Specs to do as much damage as possible, but Timid is preferred to outspeed anything below base 100 Speed. Dragon Pulse is a nice option for late-game sweeping, still offering solid power without suffering the Special Attack drops from Draco Meteor. As usual, you should provide Salamence with anything that can stomach Ice- or Dragon-type attacks; Follow Me Jirachi is as good as ever and can even offer Thunder Wave support to slow down Kingdra or other Choice Scarf users.</p> "

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>Metagross is an excellent Pokemon and is one of the best physical attackers in Doubles. Thanks to its high Attack stat, it has no problem hitting most of the tier for great damage. If that isn't enough to entice you, Clear Body allows Metagross to avoid stat drops from common things such as Icy Wind and Intimidate, allowing it to distinguish itself from other physical attackers such as Scizor. Metagross's typing also grants it many useful resistances against moves such as Latios's Draco Meteor and Abomasnow's Blizzard, and this combined with its good bulk means that it has no trouble switching in and sponging hits. Unfortunately for Metagross, its middling Speed leaves it outsped by many common Pokemon threats such as Heatran and Rotom-W. In addition, it has difficulty handling common bulky Water-types such as Jellicent, Rotom-W and Gastrodon, all of whom resist its Steel-type STAB and can cripple Metagross with Will-O-Wisps or Scalds. When compared though, Metagross's positives far outweigh its negatives, and it should always be considered for a teamslot.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Band can be used, but being locked into moves with Metagross's low Speed can be undesirable. An Explosion set with Normal Gem is an interesting option to surprise an opponent with a huge amount of damage, but it forces you to Protect or run a Ghost-type in order to avoid dealing huge chunks of damage to your own Pokemon. Gravity can be nice to support the team and grant Metagross's STAB attacks perfect accuracy, but it loses access to an additional attacking move, and it makes the rest of the team weaker to Earthquake users such as Excadrill. Bulldoze can be a decent option to grant Speed control, but it hits your partner and is very weak. Magnet Rise can be useful to grant Metagross a Ground-type immunity, giving it nothing to fear from Pokemon such as Excadrill and Landorus. However, Magnet Rise isn't too useful otherwise, as it can be difficult to set up due to Metagross's low Speed, and comes at the cost of one of its attacking options.</p> <p>Light Screen can be a cool option to allow Metagross and its teammates to better handle special attacks. Metagross can make a good supporter of Rain teams with Rain Dance, as it can take on Tyranitar and Abomasnow and change weather. A set with Agility or Rock Polish can make Metagross function as a sweeper, but it can be hard to set up, and due to Metagross's weak offensive coverage it will have a difficult time sweeping even after nabbing a boost. A set with Gyro Ball, Trick, and Iron Ball can be an option with Trick Room support to give Metagross a high-powered STAB attack while crippling an opposing Pokemon at the same time by Tricking them an Iron Ball. ThunderPunch gives Metagross an option to hit bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Gyarados, but its other moves tend to have more utility. Psych Up can be cool to copy stat boosts from Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, but it is very situational. Substitute can be nice to protect Metagross from powerful attacks and status moves that can cripple it, but it's generally too slow to make use of it effectively. Rock Slide is a nice option to hit Flying-types and Volcarona as well as granting Metagross a spread move, but it's not very strong due to the lack of a STAB boost and the spread damage reduction. Icy Wind can be used to grant Speed control for the rest of your team, but it is generally better left to Pokemon such as Cresselia and Jirachi. Swagger can also be used to pose a nuisance to special attackers as well as grant boosts to physical attackers with Lum Berry, but it is not very reliable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Jellicent, Politoed, Suicune, and Gastrodon make for good counters to Metagross as they resist its main STAB attack and can heal off the damage, while hitting back hard with their own attacks, and cripple Metagross with burns from Will-O-Wisp and Scald. Fire-types such as Ninetales, Volcarona, Heatran, Chadelure, and Victini also make for great checks since they resist Metagross's Steel-type STAB and can melt it with powerful, super effective attacks. Victini, Volcarona, and Heatran get special mentions; Victini can resist both of Metagross's STABs, while Volcarona and Heatran are able to set up on Metagross with Quiver Dance and Substitute, respectively. However, all must be wary of Metagross with Earthquake. Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Excadrill can outspeed Metagross and deal large chunks of damage with their STAB Earthquakes. However, Garchomp and Landorus must watch out for Choice Scarf sets that can outspeed and OHKO them. Opposing Steel-types such as Scizor, Bisharp, and Heatran have little issue with Metagross sets that lack Earthquake and Hammer Arm, as they resist all of its other commonly carried moves and can hit back hard. Zapdos and Thundurus resist Metagross's Steel-type attacks and can also hit back hard with Thunderbolt. In addition, Zapdos has Heat Wave to hit Metagross super effectively.</p> ",

In addition, its chance of granting an Attack boost can be useful to give it even more of an offensive punch. Bullet Punch is the other STAB attack, and it serves to circumvent Metagross's lackluster Speed as well as pick off weakened Pokemon. Zen Headbutt is a great option in the third slot, as it provides a nice secondary STAB option, is able to maul common Fighting-types such as Hitmontop, and gives Metagross a way to hit bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Rotom-W who otherwise have little to fear from Metagross. In addition, its chance to flinch can also be very useful in a pinch. Ice Punch is another option and is useful for swiftly eliminating Flying- and Dragon-types with a super effective coverage move. Clear Body makes these options even better because it can strike Landorus-T and Hitmontop without having to worry about Intimidate. Earthquake is a good way to catch opposing Steel-types such as Heatran and opposing Metagross, but it lacks a STAB boost and will also hit your partner, which can be tricky to play around.</p> <p>Occa Berry allows Metagross to live through Fire-type hits that would otherwise KO it. However, one must be aware of more powerful Fire-type attacks such as a Fire Gem-boosted Overheat from Volcarona or Chandelure as they can still OHKO Metagross even with Occa Berry. Steel Gem is another great option to give a one-time boost to Meteor Mash when needed. Shuca Berry is an option to let Metagross better handle Ground-type attacks, accomplishing things such as taking a Landorus-T's Earthquake and 2HKOing back with a combination of Ice Punch and Bullet Punch. However, its other options are generally more useful. Lum Berry can also be a nice choice, which lets Metagross cure pesky statuses such as burns that would otherwise render it useless. In addition, Lum Berry can be used with a Swagger user to grant a free +2 Attack boost that can't be removed by Intimidate. Hammer Arm can be used to hit Steel-types without having to resort to Earthquake, but it hits most of the common Steel-types in the tier neutrally and its Speed drop is undesirable. Psychic Gem is a useful option as it gives Zen Headbutt enough power to OHKO Amoonguss as well as some bulkier Fighting-types. An EV spread of 68 HP / 252 Atk / 188 Spe can be used to outspeed Garchomp after an Icy Wind, but the loss of bulk compared to the main spread is noticeable. 60 EVs in Speed allows Metagross to outrun and OHKO uninvested Heatran.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Togekiss, Cresselia, and Zapdos make for great partners to this set as they can provide it with Speed control to help patch up its underwhelming Speed. Tailwind is particularly useful as 4 Speed EVs and Tailwind support allows Metagross to outspeed Tornadus. Zapdos is an especially great partner, as it can provide Tailwind support and also eliminate bulky Water-types that hassle Metagross. Trick Room support from Pokemon such as Cresselia and Reuniclus can also be nice since Metagross is fairly slow. If this is the case, Hammer Arm is a great option in the third slot due to the Speed drop it provides, which effectively increases Metagross's Speed under Trick Room. Other physical attackers such as Tyranitar make for good partners as they appreciate Metagross's ability to take out common Intimidate Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Hitmontop. Pokemon such as Breloom and Rotom-W make for great partners as well since they have no trouble getting rid of bulky Water-types that trouble Metagross. In addition, the aforementioned Pokemon can also handle Earthquake users such as Excadrill who can threaten Metagross.

    "overview": "<p>Latias is outclassed in most roles that it can perform in Doubles due to the omnipresent Psychic-types, Cresselia and Latios. Cresselia usually pulls off a support role better courtesy of its mind boggling bulk, something Latias can only dream of rivaling. Latios, on the other hand, largely outclasses Latias as an offensive Pokemon, due to its higher Special Attack stat. That said, thanks to its good bulk, useful resistances to common attacking types—Water, Fire, Electric, and Fighting—and Speed, Latias is one of the best Tailwind setters in the metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If you could describe Latias's movepool with a single word, it would be 'colossal'. That said, even with plenty of attacking and supportive options, there are few if any combinations Latias can use as effectively as the moves listed on the main set. There are two item options worth mentioning though: Yache Berry and Dragon Gem. Yache Berry is fairly self-explanatory; it helps Latias in countering Blizzard teams and taking Ice-type attacks comfortably in general. Dragon Gem, on the other hand, seems like complete madness, but because Latias secures OHKOs on Breloom, Kyurem-B, and Chandelure with it, it is a perfectly viable option if you wish to fling an extra hard-hitting Draco Meteor in your opponent's direction.</p> <p>As Latias is first and foremost a supporter, additional moves that help it support naturally get the first mentions. Icy Wind can be used as a different form of speed control, but it is often better used by more bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia. Heal Pulse is an interesting option that lets Latias heal a teammate, but should be used with caution; it will hit the opponent if your teammate goes down. Safeguard also deserves a mention, as it prevents the opponent from repeatedly using Thunder Wave, which is usually one of Tailwind's worst enemies. Reflect and Light Screen seem great for Latias on paper, but it is no Cresselia, and therefore has a hard time setting said screens up. Sunny Day and Rain Dance are options to help either support your weather team or disrupt problematic opposing weather teams. Role Play can also help perform this, as well as copying useful abilities such as Intimidate, but it is generally hard to consistently use effectively due to the move's gimmicky nature. Magic Coat is useful for bouncing back Taunt and Thunder Wave, but it is very situational. Swagger can be used in tandem with a teammate carrying a Lum Berry to boost its Attack for free; it can also be used to disrupt the opposition, but relying on coin flips is usually a terrible idea.</p> <p>Latias can also pack a punch, so a fully offensive spread with 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid nature is viable due to Latias having more bulk than Latios. The main moves for this set would be Draco Meteor, Psyshock, Hidden Power Fire, and Protect. Thunderbolt and Thunder could also be used to hit many bulky Water-types hard, and Grass Knot and Energy Ball could do the same against different Water-types. You could also opt to use Psychic over Psyshock, but because most Pokemon in Doubles invest in Special Defense rather than Defense, Psyshock hits most targets harder. Finally, Latias's humongous list of other options ends with a rather peculiar option: Mist Ball. This move works as a STAB move and a pseudo-Snarl at the same time, but Psyshock is a more consistent STAB Psychic-type attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Steel-types, such as Metagross and Bisharp, have no trouble walling Latias's attacks and can do a good amount of damage in return. Bug-types, such as Heracross, Genesect, and Scizor, can easily KO it with their STAB moves, and in Volcarona's case, even set up on Latias. Thundurus and Tornadus are problematic if Latias needs to set up Tailwind, as they can both Taunt it, the latter also being able to deal a big number with Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Another huge problem for Latias is bulky or fast Dark-types, such as Tyranitar and Weavile, as they can take it out with a STAB move of choice. Most Trick Room setters can both wall Latias and undermine its speed control, especially bulky setters such as Cresselia and Dusclops. Chandelure succeeds in both setting up Trick Room and dealing super effective damage, making it one of the big thorns in Latias's side. Latios will win against Latias if it gets lucky; it needs to win the Speed tie and hope that Latias doesn't carry Haban Berry, but if the situation is so, Latias gets OHKOed easily by Draco Meteor, boosted or not. Finally, Sableye is a Pokemon that will make Latias rip its (non-existent) hair out, due to its ability to shut Latias down with Taunt and burn the potential physical attackers standing at its side.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With this set, Latias pieces together all of its positive traits to make the most out of itself as a fast supporter in the Doubles metagame. Tailwind is a fantastic support move, helping your team wreak havoc throughout the four turns that it lasts without fear of getting outpaced, but Thunder Wave is a perfectly viable alternative that permanently affects a Pokemon on the opponent's team's Speed. Draco Meteor might seem odd on a support Pokemon, and Dragon Pulse looks a bit more appealing on paper, but Draco Meteor provides fantastic utility by being able to OHKO many popular Dragon-types in Doubles and makes sure Latias can perform an alternative role as opposed to just being a fully support-oriented Pokemon.</p> <p>To show the benefit of using Draco Meteor over Dragon Pulse, here are some important damage calculations:</p> <p>Draco Meteor vs. 4 / 0 Salamence: 119.27 - 140.96%</p> <p>Draco Meteor vs. 4 / 0 Hydreigon: 109.2 - 129.44%</p> <p>Draco Meteor vs. 4 / 0 Garchomp: 104.46 - 124.02%</p> <p>Draco Meteor vs. 0 / 4 Latios: 100.33 - 118.27%</p> <p>The third slot is another move that prevents Latias from becoming dead weight after using Tailwind or Draco Meteor. Helping Hand is extremely useful, as it can boost Latias's teammates' moves after Tailwind has been set up, helping it fill the role of a supporter more effectively. Protect is very useful in the last slot for playing mindgames and is a general staple on many Pokemon in Doubles, but because Latias is as bulky as it is, Protect is not nearly as necessary as it would be on an offensive Pokemon. Psyshock is another viable option, as it hits common Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Breloom for solid damage.</p> <p>The given spread allows Latias to use its amazing Speed tier to outpace key threats such as Terrakion, Salamence, and Garchomp. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD might look appealing for additional bulk, but Latias's Speed is what really sets it apart from Cresselia, and it is much harder to set Tailwind or use Thunder Wave if Latias is slow. Sitrus Berry is the main item, as it helps with Latias's overall longevity, but Haban Berry helps it deal with opposing Dragon-types much more effectively, as it can survive any Dragon-type attack and retaliate by either setting up Tailwind or hitting back hard with a Draco Meteor. Dragon Pulse could work over Draco Meteor, but it misses out on the important OHKOs listed above. Psychic is an option to hit Pokemon such as Breloom and Landorus-T for more damage, but Psyshock hits most Pokemon harder due to the metagame being more specially defensive in general.</p> <p>First and foremost when it comes to picking teammates, know that anything with middling to high Speed appreciates the speed control support from Latias. Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Heracross, and Victini are all good Pokemon to use on Tailwind teams and should therefore be considered for use alongside Latias. Even more notable Pokemon under this category are Ground-types that benefit from Tailwind. Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine are all fantastic teammates, as they can freely use Earthquake due to Latias's immunity to it. Steel-types synergize extremely well with Latias, as they resist attacks that hit Latias for super effective damage, so Pokemon such as Scizor and Metagross are good teammates as well. Finally, teams weak to sun and rain appreciate the presence of Latias, as its presence alone will be a thorn in the side of those archetypes.</p> "

This, alongside Hidden Power Ground to cover Heatran and Metagross, makes Latios difficult to reliably switch into and a threat that every team must prepare for.</li> <li>Psychic is another reliable STAB attack that can hit common Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Conkeldurr, without the drawback of Draco Meteor. Alternatively, teams can opt for Tailwind over Psychic if they require the speed control.</li> <li>Both Dragon Gem and Life Orb function to improve Latios's damage output. Dragon Gem gives Latios a one-time Draco Meteor nuke. The idea behind the Dragon Gem set is that Latios uses Draco Meteor most often and only uses Psychic or Hidden Power Ground against super effective targets such as Conkeldurr and Heatran, respectively, which already take a ton of damage even without a Life Orb boost. Given how common residual damage is, such as from Stealth Rock or sand, the lack of recoil with Dragon Gem can allow Latios to better tank hits, such as Landorus-T's U-turn, Excadrill's Iron Head, or Choice Band Genesect's Extreme Speed.</li> <li>On the other hand, Life Orb gives a boost to all of Latios's attacks, thus allowing it to function better as a wallbreaker by dishing out more damage to key metagame threats, such as Heatran, Metagross, and Amoonguss. Additionally, Life Orb gives Latios more consistent Draco Meteor damage. Overall, either set provides more or less the same value to a team, and deciding which item to use oftentimes comes down to personal playstyle.</li> <li>Latios's unique combination of speed and power can allow it to function as a reliable wallbreaker while also being able to outspeed and threaten much of the format's slower attackers, such as Kyurem-B.</li> <li>Latios requires minimal direct support due to its ability to fit on a variety of teams, although it does benefit from teammates that can remove Tyranitar, such as Conkeldurr, Landorus-T, and Genesect.</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Genesect and Ferrothorn, although Latios will be slower than opposing Latios due to HP Fire IVs.</li> <li>A Choice Scarf set with Trick over Protect and Ice Beam over Psychic can be used as a speedy revenge killer, allowing Latios to outspeed and OHKO opposing unboosted Latios, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T while enabling it to cripple bulkier Pokemon, such as Cresselia or Jellicent, with Trick.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<p>A Pokemon with godlike defenses rivaling those of Shuckle and a phenomenal HP stat that puts even Blissey to shame... this is the complete opposite of Deoxys-Attack. A dismal HP stat with pathetic defenses means that Deoxys-A will be OHKOed by almost every Pokemon in the game; it is the ultimate glass cannon. However, despite its pathetic durability, Deoxys-A's offensive prowess makes it a truly threatening behemoth. Base 180 attacking stats with unparalleled coverage and a 140 Base Power STAB move in Psycho Boost means that it can OHKO most of the metagame. Deoxys-A is truly a legend that all teams should be prepared to face.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Deoxys-A's wide movepool means that it has a large amount of other options. For example, it can use Thunder or Thunderbolt to hit Water-types; however, Psycho Boost can usually OHKO them regardless. Substitute can make Deoxys-A a monster, but is very difficult to get up safely. It also has access to Taunt to stop the opposition from trying to paralyze it or set up Trick Room. Rock Slide is an option as well, being Deoxys-A's only spread move, but the coverage moves provided usually work much more effectively. Finally, an all-out Special variant of Deoxys-A can be used with Psycho Boost / Ice Beam / Hidden Power Fire / Protect, but a mixed set usually works better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hitmontop can use Fake Out to break Deoxys-A's Focus Sash, and also has access to Feint to break Deoxys-A's predicted Protect. Tyranitar and Abomasnow can break Deoxys-A's Focus Sash with their respective weather abilities, making them solid answers to it. Priority users such as Breloom and Scizor can also be great answers to Deoxys-A, especially if it is not carrying a Focus Sash. Bulky Steel-types, such as Metagross and Bronzong, can also be a problem, as they can tank Superpower and Hidden Power Fire and KO Deoxys-A in return. Spread moves can also pose a major problem to Deoxys-A, as the reduced power will not matter due to Deoxys-A's frailty. Jirachi can tank any of Deoxys-A's hits easily, and can redirect its attacks with Follow Me. Scrafty can lower its attack and KO Deoxys-A with Crunch, while Bisharp can kill it with Sucker Punch. Swift Swim Pokemon can also defeat Deoxys-A easily. Cresselia and Reuniclus can tank a Dark Pulse from Deoxys-A and KO it in return. Finally, Thundurus-I can Thunder Wave Deoxys-A and effectively neutralize it; Pokemon with Tailwind or Trick Room can also render Deoxys-A useless.</p> ",

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This set utilizes Deoxys-A's raw power and phenomenal coverage in the most effective way possible. STAB Psycho Boost can KO most of the tier, and can still do major damage to the opposition even after the Special Attack drop it causes. Dark Pulse can work well against Psychic-types, such as Cresselia and Reuniclus, that resist Psycho Boost. However, ExtremeSpeed can also work; as Deoxys-A's lone priority move, it can work well to KO weakened Choice Scarf and priority users. Superpower lets Deoxys-A annihilate Dark-types, such as Tyranitar, and Steel-types; Hidden Power Fire also works in this slot, however, letting Deoxys-A hit Scizor and Genesect while foregoing its ability to hit Tyranitar and other Dark-types as hard. Finally, Protect is key in the last slot, allowing Deoxys-A to block opposing Fake Outs.</p> <p>Focus Sash is key on this set, as it allows Deoxys-A to take any hit despite its low defenses. However, Life Orb can also be a useful item, as it can help Deoxys-A get key KOs on Pokemon such as Heatran that it could not otherwise. Life Orb is a better choice on sand and hail teams, as well as teams without weather control, as sand and hail will render Deoxys-A's Focus Sash worthless anyway. The EVs take full advantage of Deoxys-A's offensive prowess, with enough Speed investment to move before Jolteon and Scarf Cloyster; Rash nature maximizes its Special Attacking power. Stealth Rock can be used over Protect and can work against teams with Pokemon such as Thundurus, but Protect's versatility makes it a more reliable option. Ice Beam can be used over Dark Pulse, retaining coverage on Latias and Latios, while gaining super effective coverage on Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, but its inability to hit Reuniclus and Cresselia super effectively means it is usually a worse option.</p> <p>Deoxys-A appreciates a partner that minimizes the opponent's chance to retaliate. Thus pairing Deoxys-A with a powerful priority user, such as Bisharp, or a speedy Sweeper; such as Life Orb Darkrai, Genesect, or Volcarona, is recommended. The aforementioned teammates also offer powerful Fire-, Dark-, or Bug-type offenses to combat troublesome Steel- and Psychic-types, potentially freeing up one of Deoxys-A's moveslot for a different type of coverage or utility move, such as Ice Beam or ExtremeSpeed. Pokemon with Follow Me or Rage Powder, such as Jirachi, Togekiss, and Volcarona, can also be good partners, as Deoxys-A can OHKO most of the tier by itself. Hitmontop is also a very good partner due to its access to Wide Guard, which can block spread moves, Feint, which can break Protect, and Fake Out, which can leave potentially dangerous threats vulnernable to being OHKOed by Deoxys-A. Speed control is also very important when using this set due to Deoxys-A's pathetic bulk, so Pokemon that can use Tailwind, such as Tornadus, can be a big help; Tornadus also has access to Prankster Taunt, which can stop the opposition from using moves such as Thunder Wave and Trick Room which would render Deoxys-A useless.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>A Pokemon that truly strikes fear in the hearts of its opponents and whose sheer presence makes them cower can be described in only three words: a giant bell. Bronzong's red eyes portray the anger it can cause its opponents through the use of Trick Room, a move that can completely turn the tide of a battle. Bronzong is one of the best users of this move due to its bulk and good typing which along with Levitate means that Bronzong is only weak to Fire-type moves. However, not all is good for Bronzong, as its offensive capabilities leave much to be desired. It also faces competition from other Trick Room setters, particularly Cresselia, which is bulkier than Bronzong and shares its Ground-type immunity. Despite its flaws, however, Bronzong can be a good team supporter for a Trick Room team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bronzong has access to Reflect and Light Screen, which it can use to support its team. However, Bronzong does not have enough moveslots to use them effectively. Rain Dance can be used with a Damp Rock on a rain team, providing the team with a backup rain setter in case Politoed goes down. Bulldoze is also an option to hit Steel-types without running the risk of damaging Bronzong's partner, but Earthquake is usually more useful. Hidden Power Ice is also an option, hitting Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus-T; this move is also useful in case Bronzong is hit by an Intimidate. Bronzong can also use Rest with a Chesto Berry to make up for its lack of recovery, but again, it simply does not have the room to do so; this strategy also isn't usually worth it. Finally, Bronzong can use Heatproof to bluff Levitate and take Fire-type moves more easily, but this is very unreliable and also stops its partners from taking advantage of its Earthquake immunity.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fire-types such as Chandelure, Volcarona, and Heatran can all dispose of Bronzong by taking advantage of its weakness to Fire-type attacks. Fake Out is also a good tool to use against Bronzong, preventing it from moving for a turn, thus giving the user's teammate a chance to potentially take Bronzong out. Detect can foil Bronzong's attempts to use Imprison to block Protect while making it waste a turn. Rain-boosted Water-type attacks can also deal a large amount of damage to the blue bell. Slow Pokemon such as Conkeldurr can use Bronzong's Trick Room against it and attempt to wreak havoc on its team. Pokemon with Protect can be useful to stall out precious turns of Trick Room, but this strategy can be stopped by Bronzong's Imprison. Gravity is a major thorn in Bronzong's side, taking away its immunity to Ground-type moves and thus allowing Pokemon such as Landorus-T to destroy it. Finally, Mold Breaker Excadrill can nullify Levitate and nail Bronzong with an Earthquake.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Bronzong's bulk and solid typing to make it a solid Trick Room setter and team supporter. Gyro Ball gives Bronzong a form of offense and allows it to hit hard due to Bronzong's extremely low Speed stat. However, Earthquake is also an option, allowing Bronzong to hit Steel-types, such as Heatran, for super effective damage. Imprison is used in the third slot to stop opposing Pokemon from using Trick Room and Protect, making the opponent unable to negate Trick Room and rendering them incapable of stalling it out easily. Imprison also works well if Bronzong is running Earthquake, as it can prevent the opponent from using it, which can be useful if the blue bell is partnered with a Pokemon such as Heatran. However, Swagger is an option as well, which can be used to annoy the opposition; it also works with partners such as Persim Berry Rhyperior, giving them an Attack boost at no cost. Protect works well in the last slot, giving Bronzong more options and allowing it to scout.</p> <p>Mental Herb is the item of choice, preventing Bronzong from being shut down by Taunt and Encore users, such as Thundurus and Whimsicott, respectively. The EVs allow Bronzong to survive a +1 Hydro Pump from Rotom-W in the rain; the rest of the EVs are put into Defense to give the bell more bulk. However, Bronzong can move these EVs from Defense into Attack if it's running Gyro Ball, which gives it an 87.5% chance to OHKO Terrakion. Explosion is an option in the third slot and can be nice for dealing a large amount of damage to every Pokemon on the field, but the moves listed above are usually more reliable. Psyshock and Psychic can also work on this set, letting Bronzong 2HKO Fighting-types, such as Virizion, Hitmontop, and Hariyama (8 Special Attack EVs are necessary to do this); these moves also work well if Bronzong gets hit by an Intimidate. Obviously, Pokemon that can take advantage of Trick Room, such as Conkeldurr and Rhyperior, are good partners for this set; Rhyperior is especially useful because Bronzong is immune to Earthquake, meaning that Rhyperior can use it freely without worrying about hitting its partner. Other Trick Room setters, such as Cresselia, are also useful. Heatran can be a good partner for this set as well, especially if Bronzong is running Imprison with Earthquake, as that will prevent the opposition from taking advantage of Heatran's biggest weakness. Finally, Politoed is a good teammate for Bronzong, making it less weak to the Fire-type moves that plague it.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>With Garchomp's great typing, good bulk, and powerful Attack stat, it manages to be a top threat in yet another metagame. Being one of the best Pokemon since its introduction in the DPP years, it really should come as no surprise that it's just as good in Doubles as it is anywhere else. The things holding this powerful Dragon-type back are having to rely on Dragon Claw as its main STAB and being slower than Latios and Latias. Garchomp definitely shouldn't be overlooked when team building, as it can easily rip apart unprepared teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There isn't much else Garchomp can do, but it can run a few interesting moves that could surprise your opponent. Dragon Tail has higher priority than Trick Room does, so Dragon Tail Garchomp could work like Roar Latias and phaze your opponents before they even get the chance to set up Trick Room. Stone Edge is a single target move Garchomp could use that is stronger than Rock Slide, but it is less accurate and cannot make the opponent flinch. Outrage is a option, but you can't control it's target, and you also can't switch out, which is likely to be fatal in Doubles. A Swords Dance set can be attempted, but it's harder to pull off in Doubles. Lastly, Rest paired with a Chesto Berry can be used as a form of recovery for Garchomp.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to its glaring weakness to Ice-type moves, Cresselia, Mamoswine, Weavile, Choice Scarf Cloyster, and any Pokemon with an Ice-type attack are all good counters to Garchomp. Pokemon with Intimidate such as Landorus-T, Hitmontop, and Scrafty all give Garchomp a hard time by lowering its Attack stat. Landorus-T is notable because it also avoids Earthquake. Politoed, Ludicolo, Kingdra, Rotom-W, and other common rain Pokemon can be problematic for Garchomp too. Another very large problem Garchomp has is faster Dragon-types, such as Latios, Latias, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Choice Scarf Salamence. Trick Room is a problem for Garchomp due to its relatively high base Speed, so it should try stay away from Trick Room as much as it can.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Offensive Chomp",
        "description": "<p>The idea behind this set is fairly simple: do damage, hit hard, and hit fast. The two main moves are Garchomp's best STAB moves, one being a single target attack and the other being a spread move. Dragon Claw is the better choice in the first slot thanks to it being Garchomp's best Dragon-type attack outside of Outrage, which targets a random enemy in doubles and is thus unreliable. Dual Chop could also be used in this slot, due to it being a multi-hit move that allows Garchomp to break Substitutes and Focus Sashes.</p> <p>There are several options for the third slot. Rock Slide brings the risk of having two spread moves, but it can hit Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate harder than Garchomp would otherwise. Fire Blast is only used to hit Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Scizor that Garchomp wouldn't otherwise be able to touch. If Garchomp is paired with a Pokemon like Scrafty, Hitmontop, or Togekiss, Substitute can be used to gain free turns thanks to your partner, making Garchomp even more of a pain than it already is.</p> <p>For the item, Yache Berry and Life Orb are the only two good options. Garchomp is incredibly weak to Ice-type moves, making Yache Berry a very attractive option that could buy an extra turn by staving off an OHKO. Life Orb gives Garchomp's already scary Attack stat a boost in power, making it an even more terrifying threat.</p> <p>Speed control is something that Garchomp loves to have on its side. It doesn't matter if it's Thunder Wave, Icy Wind, or Tailwind—Garchomp loves the support. Because of this, Cresselia, Thundurus, Togekiss, and Defiant Tornadus all make for awesome teammates. They avoid the spread damage from Earthquake and are also able to slow opponents down. Cresselia and Togekiss can not only control Speed but can use Helping Hand to further boost Garchomp's insane power as well. Other Flying-types and Levitate users also make for good partners; Pokemon such as Zapdos, Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Latios are all immune to Earthquake and help deal with rain. Discharge spam works here thanks to Garchomp's immunity to Electric-type attacks. Pokemon like Rotom-W and Thundurus-T are able to to take advantage of Discharge and inflict status without having to worry about Garchomp getting caught in the crossfire. Finally, Pokemon like Tyranitar, who can switch into Draco Meteor and Blizzard, are good teammates to have in the wings.</p> <p>Though Pokemon with the ability Defiant don't look like they would support Garchomp well, they actually make for some great teammates. Bisharp and Tornadus both have this ability, and Bisharp also has resistances to Ice- and Dragon-type attacks, two types Garchomp hates. Pair that with the ability to make Landorus-T, Salamence, Hitmontop, Scrafty, and Gyarados all scared to switch in and you end up having one of Garchomp's best friends. Not only does Bisharp do all that, but he also keeps Latios and Latias in check with STAB Sucker Punches and stops Cresselia from using Icy Wind to lower Garchomp's Speed. The other Defiant Pokemon is Tornadus, and although it doesn't have great type synergy like Bisharp does, it has a Ground-type immunity, so Garchomp can still freely use Earthquake. Icy Wind can be a problem still, as it hurts Tornadus just as much as it helps. Tornadus can also set up Tailwind in a pinch if it needs to, helping Garchomp outspeed Latios and Latias and base 100 Choice Scarf Dragon-types, as well as firing off powerful Flying Gem Acrobatics that can even knock out Latios. Although using Defiant Pokemon isn't as straightforward as using Cresselia or Togekiss, these Pokemon are able to create mind games that could give you an advantage.</p> <p>Garchomp can also use many different items. Because it's forced to use Rough Skin, you can use Rocky Helmet to indirectly deal quick damage to Pokemon like Hitmontop who think using Fake Out on Garchomp is a great idea. A Dragon Gem or Ground Gem can be used to deal heavy damage for a single turn, and items like Choice Scarf and Choice Band can always be used to boost Garchomp's Speed and Attack, respectively. Swagger + Lum Berry can be used to boost Attack and heal right away, and Focus Sash can be used to survive an immediate, powerful hit.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Toxicroak is yet another one of those Fake Out-using Fighting-types, and with Pokemon such as Hitmontop, Scrafty, and Hariyama running around the metagame, you might question what it has to stand out from the competition. The answer lies in its ability Dry Skin, which is a great addition for Toxicroak in the Doubles metagame, allowing it to merrily support rain teams while Surf-spamming partners replenish its health. Toxicroak's movepool comprises of a neat mixture of attacking and supporting options, topped by the ever-useful Fake Out, which is an enormous asset to any Pokemon lucky enough to get it. Its unique Poison / Fighting typing is a mixed bag, giving it some nice resistances including a rare one to the common Fighting + Dark coverage, but also some crippling weaknesses to the common Psychic- and Ground-type attacks and an ineffectual Poison STAB. Additionally, it faces competition from other Fighting-types, most notably Hitmontop, which also gets Intimidate and Wide Guard, outclassing it in many regards. If you are going to use Toxicroak, run rain and utilize Dry Skin, as otherwise, other Fake Out users will be of more use.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Although the options in the main set are generally the best, Toxicroak has other options to play with if it wants to. Gunk Shot and Poison Jab are available Poison-type STABs, but Poison is an awful type offensively speaking; additionally Gunk Shot's accuracy is even worse than Cross Chop's. Swords Dance and Bulk Up are setup options, but Toxicroak lacks the bulk to set up consistently in such a fast-paced metagame, and Nasty Plot is even worse due to a poor Special Attack stat and special movepool. Rain Dance is useful to help win weather wars but Toxicroak is often better off trying to kill the opposing weather setter and switching Politoed back in, as Toxicroak has a good match-up versus Tyranitar and Abomasnow. Sludge Wave, Rock Slide, and Earthquake are your best options for a spread move, but none offers coverage as good as Sucker Punch does. Stone Edge can be used to hit the likes of Volcarona and Thundurus, and particularly lures Volcarona which will often assume it is safe to set up, but its accuracy is a letdown. Ice Punch can OHKO various things that are 4x weak to it, but most of these outrun Toxicroak and OHKO first, so speed control support is a necessity. As far as different items go, Black Sludge and Leftovers are conceivably useful if you are really putting effort into keeping Toxicroak alive for as long as possible. Shuca Berry could let Toxicroak live an otherwise fatal Earthquake. Focus Sash is usable because of Toxicroak's frailty, but is broken by any weather that isn't rain, including sun, due to the negative side-effect of Dry Skin.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Because of Toxicroak's regenerative capabilities, the best way to kill it is in a single hit. Fortunately, due to its lackluster defenses, doing so isn't very difficult. Powerful Earthquake users such as Garchomp and the Landorus formes are good examples. Mamoswine and Excadrill (outside of sand) can do the same but need speed control as they are outsped and crushed with Cross Chop or Drain Punch. Gastrodon's Earth Power also does huge damage, even OHKOing with investment, and Gastrodon does well against rain in general. Bulky Thundurus can take on Toxicroak and deal damage back or cripple Toxicroak with Thunder Wave. Offensive Psychic-types such as Latios and Deoxys-A destroy it but must be wary of Sucker Punch; bulkier Psychic-types which don't care about Sucker Punch such as Cresselia, Metagross, and Jirachi win easily. Gallade also deserves a mention; it resists Cross Chop and gets an Attack boost from Sucker Punch thanks to Justified. Bulky Ghost-types can play around Sucker Punch with status, although Toxicroak can win if it carries Taunt; Sableye, with Prankster Will-O-Wisp, is a particularly good counter. As the only major user of Flying-type STAB, both Defiant and Prankster variants of Tornadus beat it with Acrobatics or Hurricane. Scizor's Bullet Punch leaves a gaping hole in Toxicroak, and Scizor can also OHKO it with Acrobatics or Aerial Ace. Volcarona exploits Dry Skin to do huge damage; a Fire Gem-boosted Overheat from it is capable of killing Toxicroak in one hit <em>in the rain. Additionally, it can set up Quiver Dances with impunity due to it resisting Fighting-type attacks —even if Toxicroak attempts to stop this with Fake Out, it risks being burnt by Flame Body. Toxicroak is also killed by really strong neutral attacks—Thundurus-T's Thunder is a good example. Amoonguss can just spam Rage Powder in Toxicroak's face and Toxicroak can do little about it unless it has Taunt or Ice Punch. If all else fails, you can also take away the rain that replenishes Toxicroak. Ninetales does this well as sun damages Toxicroak, but Ninetales might get rough treatment from Toxicroak's Water-type teammates. Also, neither Tyranitar nor Abomasnow can take a Cross Chop. Finally, Intimidate users generally blunt Toxicroak enough to make it switch out.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Toxicroak shouldn't be straying too far from this set. Fake Out is too good to pass up, as the potential for free damage and an opportunity for Toxicroak's partner to work with relative freedom for a turn can be game-changing. The choice of Fighting-type STAB is a tough one, but despite being frustratingly prone to missing at times, Cross Chop is better because Toxicroak needs the power boost, as it allows Toxicroak to achieve OHKOs on the likes of Hydreigon, Darkrai, Mamoswine, and Abomasnow, and a 2HKO on Ferrothorn, that would not otherwise be assured, and the fast-paced nature of Doubles means that Drain Punch's healing is less useful. However, Drain Punch can be used for its consistency and healing, and with additional healing from Dry Skin, it can make Toxicroak a deceptively tough nut to crack. Sucker Punch has brilliant coverage with Cross Chop, hitting everything at least neutrally bar Heracross and other Toxicroak. Sucker Punch also does big damage to the likes of Latios, and allows Toxicroak to get around its middling Speed stat. Protect is a staple, present on the vast majority of non-Choiced Doubles movesets, and Toxicroak is too frail to be an exception. Remember, when Toxicroak uses Protect in the rain, it gets 12.5% of its health back for free.</p> <p>Life Orb is the item of choice for this set as Toxicroak doesn't hit very hard without it, and Dry Skin naturally offsets Life Orb recoil. Since Toxicroak is intended to stick around and support its team rather than blow massive holes in the opponent, a Life Orb is better than Gems. A Jolly nature is suggested to outrun Jolly Mamoswine, Adamant Excadrill (in rain), speed tie with Modest Hydreigon, and destroy them all with Cross Chop; however, if Toxicroak has an Adamant nature, it will have no trouble beating Chople Berry Tyranitar and Ferrothorn and achieving a possible OHKO on Latios.</p> <p>Toxicroak also gets cool support options such as Taunt and Feint. In particular, Feint has great synergy with Fake Out, as you can score free damage on an opponent predicting a Fake Out and selecting Protect; likewise, Taunt works beautifully with Sucker Punch as it prevents an opponent playing around Sucker Punch with status moves. However, in both of these cases, Toxicroak will have to give up one of the listed moves, and it really needs all of them to work at its best. These moves also require good prediction, as Feint is a wasted move should the target use anything other than Protect, and several common targets of Taunt such as Cresselia and Togekiss will flat-out destroy Toxicroak should they choose to attack it. Substitute is another option to consider, as Dry Skin allows Toxicroak to make an almost indefinite number of Substitutes if necessary. It also encourages the opponent to attack Toxicroak, making Sucker Punch harder to play around.</p> <p>Toxicroak's Fighting-type STAB is hugely helpful to rain teams as it threatens Tyranitar, Abomasnow, and Ferrothorn, all of which are large problems for rain. For teammates, Politoed is the most obvious as it brings rain. As well as the obvious benefit of Drizzle, Politoed can support Toxicroak with Helping Hand to allow Toxicroak's moves to achieve more OHKOs, particularly with Sucker Punch, which can reliably kill Latios and Chandelure with Helping Hand support, and take a huge chunk out of Jellicent. Other pokemon that take advantage of rain might also take advantage of the Dry Skin and Surf combination, particularly Ludicolo, which is additionally able to remove Gastrodon, a prominent threat to Toxicroak, and Manaphy, which will find it easier to set up a Tail Glow with support from Toxicroak's Fake Out. Tornadus is a great partner as it discourages Earthquake and Intimidate, two things Toxicroak hates. Scizor, Metagross, and Genesect deal with the Psychic-types Toxicroak would rather avoid, while also benefiting from rain softening their weakness to Fire-type attacks.</p> "

  "Abomasnow": {
    "overview": "<p>Abomasnow seems lackluster at first glance, but it is actually a large threat in the Doubles metagame. Its key to success is its ability, Snow Warning. This allows it to be a great check to opposing weather teams, robbing Pokemon such as Kingdra and Excadrill of their respective weathers. Its STABs are also great offensively, providing good neutral coverage and allowing it to easily dispatch the two most common weather inducers in the tier, Politoed and Tyranitar. Defensively, its resistance to Water-type attacks allows it to be a thorn in the side of most rain teams. Furthermore, Snow Warning grants it access to perfectly accurate Blizzards, allowing it to be pose an even bigger offensive threat. However, it is also left weak to many common attacking types and spread moves. This makes Abomasnow difficult to keep alive, as those weaknesses can be easily exploited. Abomasnow does have its fair share of flaws, but its excellent ability and unique set of assets more than make up for this, making it a Pokemon that should be considered for many teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Substitute set can be useful to shield Abomasnow from Pokemon looking to KO it, but due to its slew of weaknesses, it can be difficult to find the time to set up a Substitute. Leech Seed can be useful to give Abomasnow gradual recovery as well as stacking residual damage with hail, but Leech Seed stalling isn't as effective in Doubles as it is in Singles. Earthquake is an option to hit Steel- and Fire-types for super effective damage; however, due to the fact that it lacks STAB and has its damage reduced due to being a spread move, it can be problematic. In addition, the fact that it would also hit Abomasnow's partner can make it difficult to use at times. Ice Beam is an option to allow Abomasnow to reliably hit Pokemon with an Ice-type STAB move when hail isn't up, but this option is rather situational and it is usually better to just run Blizzard. Icy Wind can be used to provide speed control for the rest of your team, but Abomasnow is usually better off leaving that to a teammate. Focus Blast can be useful on special attacking sets to hit non-Chople Berry Tyranitar harder than Giga Drain, as well as hitting Pokemon such as Heatran, Bisharp, and Kyurem super effectively. An Ice Gem is a nice way to power up Blizzard, doing large amounts of damage to anything it hits neutrally. Finally, a set utilizing Expert Belt can be a nice option to power up Abomasnow's coverage moves and net additional KOs.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fire-types such as Ninetales, Heatran, Chandelure, Victini, and Volcarona make for great counters, as they resist all of Abomasnow's commonly used moves and can easily KO it with STAB-boosted Fire-type attacks. Heatran and Volcarona are especially threatening, as they can easily set up a Substitute or a Quiver Dance, respectively, while Abomasnow is on the field. Jirachi makes a great check as it resists both of Abomasnow's STAB moves, is difficult for Abomasnow to wear down, and can use Follow Me to redirect its attacks and thus limit its usefulness. Metagross, Bisharp, Genesect, and Scizor also resist both of Abomasnow's STAB attacks and can deal large amounts of damage back with their Steel-type attacks. However, they must all watch out for Hidden Power Fire, especially Scizor. Fighting-types such as Hitmontop, Scrafty, Conkeldurr, and Terrakion also make good checks to Abomasnow, as they can easily threaten it with their Fighting-type attacks. Hitmontop and Conkeldurr are especially threatening, because they can use Wide Guard to shield both themselves and their partners from Abomasnow's Blizzard. Offensive Cresselia can take any of Abomasnow's hits and KO it with Hidden Power Fire. Tornadus easily outspeeds Abomasnow and can maul it with Acrobatics, although it has to watch out for Ice Shard and the Choice Scarf set. Rock Slide users such as Tyranitar and Excadrill can deal significant damage to Abomasnow, though if it lives through the hit, it is capable of doing a lot of damage to them in return.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With this set, Abomasnow can stay alive longer in order to keep hail up. It can also act as a good check to common weather sweepers such as Excadrill and Ludicolo. Blizzard is the main attacking move here due to the fact that it is both very powerful and a spread move, letting Abomasnow hit both opposing Pokemon hard. In addition, Blizzard has good neutral coverage, so it is easy to spam. Giga Drain is a good secondary STAB move, as it allows Abomasnow to hit bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent and Politoed. The recovery from Giga Drain is a nice bonus to grant more longevity and potentially allow Abomasnow to put itself back in Focus Sash range. Grass Knot is a nice alternative to hit heavier Pokemon such as Tyranitar for more damage, although the lack of recovery is unfortunate. Ice Shard is a useful option to pick off weakened Pokemon and somewhat makes up for Abomasnow's low Speed, while Hidden Power Fire is a great option to roast Scizor, Metagross, and opposing Abomasnow. The former in particular will otherwise switch into Abomasnow without worry.</p> <p>Focus Sash is used so that Abomasnow can survive any attack at full health. A Quiet nature is the main option because it makes Abomasnow slower than most weather inducers, which lets it put up hail turn one. In addition, it allows Abomasnow to be a nice check to Trick Room teams. However, if you'd rather have the additional Speed, you could use a Modest nature instead. Hidden Power Rock is an option to hit Volcarona, who otherwise has nothing to fear from Abomasnow. However, Abomasnow is not a very reliable check, as Volcarona can easily outspeed and KO it. It is also a very niche option and won't be needed very often, as outside of Fire-types, Hidden Power Rock and Blizzard have redundant coverage.</p> <p>Due to Abomasnow's poor Speed, Trick Room setters such as Cresselia and Slowking make for great partners, forming a devastating HailRoom combination that can quickly dismantle unprepared teams with Blizzard. Psychic- and Ghost-types are great options to set up Trick Room, as they can also cover up Abomasnow's Fighting weakness. Hitmontop makes for an amazing partner as it has access to Wide Guard, shielding Abomasnow from Rock Slides and Heat Waves that would otherwise deal heavy damage to it. Hitmontop's Fighting-type STAB also lets it threaten Rock-types, such as Tyranitar, and Steel-types, such as Heatran, that can cause problems for this set. Heatran and Chandelure make great partners for this set as they can discourage the opponent from using Fire-type attacks that would otherwise spell the end of Abomasnow. They can also defeat the Steel-types that resist both of Abomasnow's STAB moves and can KO Abomasnow in return. Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune make for nice partners, as they can defeat Pokemon that threaten Abomasnow such as Scizor, Heatran, and Tyranitar. In return, Abomasnow can eliminate Gastrodon. Other Blizzard users such as Kyurem and Rotom-F make for good partners as well, as they can provide the pieces for a deadly BlizzSpam strategy.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>The main goal of this set is to use raw power to eliminate opposing weather setters and win the weather war quickly. Wood Hammer is the main draw of this set, and thanks to its high Base Power, it can deal huge amounts of damage to Pokemon such as Politoed and Tyranitar. Although a special attack might seem more practical, Wood Hammer has the advantage of circumventing Tyranitar's Special Defense boost from sandstorm, allowing it to do more damage than special alternatives would. Blizzard is used as a secondary STAB move, and it is a great attacking option thanks to its high Base Power and the ability to hit both opposing Pokemon. It is also nice because it has great type coverage with Wood Hammer, taking out Flying-types that resist the move. Ice Shard is a nice option in the third slot to pick off weakened Pokemon and somewhat mitigate Abomasnow's low Speed. However, Hidden Power Fire is another great option to hit Steel-types, such as Scizor and Metagross, that can quickly become a problem for Abomasnow. It also allows Abomasnow to take out opposing Abomasnow, which is a nice bonus.</p> <p>Grass Gem is used on this set because it allows Abomasnow to net some important KOs with Wood Hammer, such as an OHKO on Politoed and Tyranitar, the two most common weather setters. Although the EV spread seems complicated, it serves a very specific purpose: 124 Attack in conjunction with a Brave nature allows Abomasnow to OHKO Tyranitar and Politoed with a Grass Gem-boosted Wood Hammer. The HP and Defense EVs allow Abomasnow to survive both a Rock Slide and a Low Kick from Tyranitar. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to power up Blizzard. Brave is used over Adamant so as not to reduce the power of Blizzard. It also ensures Abomasnow is generally slower than most opposing weather setters, so it can swiftly KO them with Wood Hammer and keep hail up.</p> <p>Other Blizzard users such as Kyurem and Rotom-F make for excellent partners to this set, as they can take advantage of Abomasnow's ability to get rid of opposing weather setters by spamming STAB-boosted Blizzards and heavily damaging opposing teams. Hitmontop is also a great partner, as Wide Guard support is appreciated with Abomasnow lacking any way to survive deadly spread moves such as Heat Wave and Rock Slide. The fact that Hitmontop has Feint is also great to get a surprise KO on Politoed and Tyranitar that think that they are safe by simply Protecting. Chandelure and Heatran are nice partners, as they can dissuade opposing Pokemon from using Fire-type attacks thanks to their Flash Fire ability. Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune make for good partners as well, as they can handle the Rock-, Fire-, and Steel-types that can give Abomasnow trouble; in return Abomasnow can quickly KO Gastrodon, who is a large nuisance to them. Thanks to its low Speed, Abomasnow partners well with Trick Room setters such as Cresselia and Slowking to utilize a HailRoom strategy that can be very difficult for the opponent to fight. Most Trick Room setters also either resist or are immune to Fighting-type attacks, so they can take on the Fighting-types that trouble Abomasnow.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped and maximum Speed investment, Abomasnow is able to reach 360 Speed, allowing it to outspeed fast sweepers such as Tornadus and Latios and dispatch of them. Blizzard is the main attacking move here, being an excellent move to be locked into thanks to its amazing neutral coverage, great power, and the ability to hit both opposing Pokemon at once. Hidden Power Fire is a good option to dispatch Scizor and Genesect. However, if these Pokemon are not concerning to you, Hidden Power Ground is a good option to hit Heatran and Chandelure, who would otherwise be massive threats to Abomasnow. Giga Drain is a good secondary STAB move to hit bulky Water-types, such as Politoed, that would otherwise not be bothered by Abomasnow's attacks. The fact that Giga Drain recovers some HP is a nice bonus as well. Grass Knot is an alternative to hit heavier Pokemon, such as Jellicent and Tyranitar, for more damage. Ice Shard is a good option to pick off faster Pokemon such as Shaymin-S, as even with a Choice Scarf equipped, Abomasnow still isn't that fast.</p> <p>This set has a nice surprise value, as Pokemon such as Latios and Tornadus will often attempt to OHKO Abomasnow, only to be outsped and OHKOed themselves. In addition, this set is a nice check to dangerous weather sweepers such as Kingdra and Excadrill, as it can remove their preferred weather, outspeed them, and hit them for nice damage.</p> <p>28 EVs are put into Defense to allow Abomasnow to survive both a Bullet Punch from Scizor and a Steel Gem-boosted Bullet Punch from Metagross, and the remaining EVs are put into Speed and Special Attack. A Modest nature might be appealing to grant Abomasnow more power, but Timid is necessary to outspeed Latios and Tornadus. Light Screen is an interesting option in order to give Abomasnow's partner more special bulk in a pinch, letting it survive hits it otherwise might not. However, being locked into Light Screen will quickly become problematic for Abomasnow. Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Volcarona, but it is very situational and outside of targeting Fire-types, Hidden Power Rock gets redundant coverage with Blizzard.</p> <p>Because this set has a harder time winning weather wars than its other sets, Pokemon that can take on Ninetales and Tyranitar, namely Terrakion, Garchomp, and Rotom-W, make for great partners. Heatran and Chandelure make for good partners to discourage the opponent from using Fire-type moves, which otherwise can easily eliminate Abomasnow. Other Blizzard users such as Kyurem and Rotom-F make for great partners to this set, as together they can form an effective BlizzSpam core.</p> "

Lickilicky's unassuming face masks an Explosion rivaled in Base Power only by Genesect with an Attack boost from Download. Like most Normal-types, Lickilicky's movepool is both huge and diverse, containing quite a few coverage moves with high Base Power. Even though Lickilicky's Attack is far from stellar, these attacks enable it to overcome its middling offensive prowess. Cloud Nine allows Lickilicky to provide team support just by existing, negating some of the damage that weather-boosted attacks do to its teammates. Lickilicky also has solid bulk that often lets it live some extremely powerful attacks. However, Lickilicky's weakness to Fighting-type moves and low Speed that tends to become awkward outside of Trick Room keep it from being a top tier threat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Lickilicky has a few oddball tricks hidden under its bib--Own Tempo, its other useful ability, is one of them. A teammate can continuously use Swagger on Lickilicky to boost its Attack, letting it KO even extremely bulky walls after a few boosts without having to resort to Explosion. If this combination is used, Fire Punch should be used over Fire Blast to take advantage of the boost to Attack. Normal Gem is usable to give Lickilicky's Explosion truly phenomenal power, but using it means giving up the boost that Life Orb grants to Lickilicky's other moves. Body Slam can be used in place of Return for its paralysis chance, but its effects become less desirable in Trick Room. Belly Drum can be used in tandem with Sitrus Berry, but such a set faces competition from the significantly stronger Snorlax. Swords Dance is a similar choice but does not require Lickilicky to damage itself. Helping Hand, Disable, Substitute, and Icy Wind are all viable moves but are difficult to fit onto Lickilicky's cramped set; Icy Wind also does not fit well on a Trick Room team.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hitmontop is Lickilicky's greatest enemy, as even if its Close Combat does not OHKO without a Fighting Gem, Intimidate dampens the power of most of Lickilicky's moves. Using Explosion around it is also dangerous, as it can even use Wide Guard to ensure that it and its teammates do not faint. In general, Pokemon with Intimidate cause Lickilicky problems. Landorus-T is another commonly used example. When Trick Room is not up, Lickilicky becomes far worse at performing its job. Cresselia can reverse an active Trick Room and Chandelure can use Imprison to ensure it is never set up. Ghost-types make using Explosion significantly less rewarding, as they make it impossible for Lickilicky to KO more than one target; Gengar is particularly troublesome for Lickilicky to KO. Depending on what coverage move it runs, various Pokemon give Lickilicky trouble; without a super effective move, Heatran, Chandelure, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Genesect all take little damage from Lickilicky's attacks. Of this group, Scizor even has a chance to OHKO with a Life Orb-boosted Superpower.</p> ",

When Trick Room is not up, having Lickilicky out pressures the opponent into either attacking it or using Protect, which can help a more vulnerable partner set up Trick Room. Power Whip's main purpose is to deal heavy damage to Tyranitar and Water-type Pokemon--some Politoed and Rotom-W can even be OHKOed with some luck if they don't invest Defense. Fire Blast allows Lickilicky to OHKO Scizor and has a good shot at doing the same to Ferrothorn with little investment in Special Defense. Because of Lickilicky's ability, this can even be done in rain, making the difficult job of dealing with these Pokemon much easier. Earthquake forgoes coverage against Scizor and Ferrothorn in exchange for a strong hit on Chandelure and an OHKO on Heatran without Shuca Berry. Return is a reliable STAB move for Lickilicky, but Protect can be used instead to stall for turns when Trick Room is not up and to evade priority moves and slower Pokemon otherwise.</p> <p>Lickilicky's EV spread maximizes Attack while giving it the most optimal bulk with the EVs remaining. Conveniently, it also turns Latios's Draco Gem Draco Meteor into a 2HKO, letting Lickilicky live for one more crucial turn in a pinch. Lickilicky's Speed is minimized in order to ensure that it moves first in Trick Room. A spread of 96 HP / 252 Atk / 160 SpD dedicates more of its bulk to the special side, letting it take a few more special hits before its demise. Aqua Tail and Hammer Arm are both options in the third slot. The former allows Lickilicky to KO Fire-types without jeopardizing its teammates but hits Heatran with less oomph than Earthquake, while the latter hits Tyranitar and some Steel-types a harder than Earthquake and lowers Lickilicky's Speed even further.</p> <p>On any team with Lickilicky, it is vital to include Pokemon that are immune to its Explosion, especially ones that can set up Trick Room. As such, Musharna and Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Chandelure are optimal teammates. Putting Protect on Lickilicky's teammates is also a good choice for the same reason. When using Fire Blast, Lickilicky fits well onto rain teams centered around Trick Room because of its ability to OHKO Ferrothorn and Scizor, which are usually difficult for such teams to remove. Pairing Lickilicky with Pokemon with Defiant makes switching in a Pokemon with Intimidate significantly less advantageous for its opponents, letting Lickilicky keep the power of its Explosion high; in Trick Room, Bisharp is a good option. A teammate that can use Imprison, such as Musharna, to block Protect also helps Lickilicky accomplish its explosive goals with greater ease.</p> "

In the Doubles metagame, Rhyperior performs in a similar style as it would in any singles tier: hit as hard as it can while avoiding any special attack. Rhyperior is one of the few Pokemon that can abuse dual STAB spread moves effectively, but is reliant on Trick Room to do so. Poor typing that is weak to common spread moves paired with the very low Special Defense stat and Speed makes Rhyperior a Pokemon that is very reliant on Trick Room to succeed. Once in Trick Room though, Rhyperior can deal major damage to both opponents with very little effort.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rhyperior evolves from a generation one Pokemon, and because of this has an extremely large movepool. Moves like Aqua Tail, Fire Punch, and Ice Punch can be used to round out coverage, while Rock Blast and Drill Run can be used as alternative STAB moves. Drill Run hits a single target harder than Earthquake while Rock Blast will allow Rhyperior to break Substitutes and Focus Sashes. Brick Break and Hammer Arm can be used for Fighting-type attacks. Brick Break will get rid of opposing screens while Hammer Arm will slow Rhyperior down and make it threatening to opposing Trick Room teams. Rhyperior also has two different ways to boost its own Attack, one being Swords Dance and the other Choice Band. Choice Band will restrict you to a single move, and Swords Dance is hard to pull off with Rhyperior. Not only can Rhyperior be a fearsome attacker, it can support its team as well. Sunny Day, Rain Dance, and Smack Down are all interesting options for Rhyperior to run. Sunny Day and Rain Dance will allow it to support its team by providing surprise weather while Smack Down can be used to ground opponents and make them vulnerable to Earthquake when they otherwise wouldn't be. The last thing worth mentioning is that Rhyperior gets access to the moves Counter and Avalanche. These paired with its relatively high physical bulk can net a few surprise KOs if the situation is right. Solid Rock is another ability that Rhyperior can use as it will help Rhyperior tank super effective hits better. The ability reduces the damage taken from super effective hits to 3/4 of the normal, which helps Rhyperior live longer in battle. Finally, an alternate EV spread that includes 244 Speed EVs as well as a positive nature will allowed you to outrun base 111s while Tailwind is up. A notable target for this set is Thundurus, which works further because Lightning Rod will protect Rhyperior's teammates from Thunder Wave.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>A weakness to common spread moves and almost any special attack is one of Rhyperior's biggest problems in the Doubles metagame, as all Water- and Ice-Type Pokemon directly threaten it with powerful special attacks. Pokemon that are faster and have a way to OHKO Rhyperior are also to be accounted for. Pokemon such as Latios, Breloom, Chandelure, Shaymin-S, Landorus, and Gem-boosted Metagross can all one-shot Rhyperior before it can even attack.</p> <p>Though Rhyperior hits extremely hard, it can be burned by bulkier Ghost Pokemon such as Dusclops, Cofagrigus, Dusknoir, and Sableye, which makes Rhyperior generally useless in battle. Intimidate Pokemon such as Landorus, Hitmontop, and Scrafty won't take much from its attacks while lowering its attack at the same time. Ferrothorn and Bronzong won't take much from any attack Rhyperior can throw at them. Finally, Rhyperior is reliant on Trick Room, which means when not in it, it's not performing as well as it could. Pokemon that can stop Trick Room from getting up can indirectly be considered a counter to Rhyperior.</p> ",

Earthquake and Rock Slide are the main attacks on this set as both will allow Rhyperior to hit almost everything for heavy damage. Stone Edge can be used in place of Rock Slide so Rhyperior is not Wide Guard bait, though it has worse accuracy and only hits a single opponent. Megahorn is the final offensive move used on the set. Megahorn will allow Rhyperior to hit Psychic- and Grass-types such as Breloom, Cresselia, Musharna, Bronzong, and Virizion harder than either of its STAB moves would. Protect rounds out the set, as it allows Rhyperior to guard against Special Attacks that would otherwise KO it.</p> <p>Being such a slow Pokemon, Rhyperior is very reliant on Trick Room, and so Pokemon such as Cresselia, Chandelure, and Dusclops all make great teammates. One Trick Room setter that Rhyperior synergizes very well with is Jellicent. Mental Herb Jellicent, which is immune to Fake Out, will be able to get Trick Room up most, if not all the time thanks to Rhyperior luring away Electric-Type attacks with its Lightning Rod ability. Being weak to common spread moves such as Surf, Muddy Water, and Blizzard, Rhyperior needs a teammate to patch up this weakness. Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Cresselia don't take much damage from any, and can handle Intimidate Pokemon at the same time, something else that Rhyperior doesn't like. Amoonguss makes for a good teammate thanks to the move Rage Powder, which will redirect any attacks Rhyperior doesn't like. Amoonguss can also put things to sleep. Tornadus, Thundurus, Togekiss, and other Pokemon with Flying-type STAB make for good teammates as well since they can cover Rhyperior's weakness to Grass-types as well as avoiding Earthquake. Lastly, the given EV spread allows Rhyperior to avoid a 2HKO by Modest Expert Belt-boosted Ice Beam from Cresselia 98% of the time while in sand or using its alternative ability, Solid Rock.</p> <p>Though Rhyperior has a lackluster Special Defense stat, there are ways to make up for it. A Rindo Berry reduces to damage taken from super effective Grass attacks while Tyranitar or Hippowdon can be used to raise its Special Defense while in sand. Bug Gem will allow Rhyperior to hit Psychic-type Pokemon harder.</p> "

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine is a very underrated threat in the Doubles metagame. Its wonderful dual Ice- and Ground-type STAB attacks can defeat a plethora of common doubles threats, such as Latios, Heatran, Thundurus, and Landorus-T. This is improved even further by the fact that Mamoswine's STAB attacks also provide it with both spread and priority in Earthquake and Ice Shard, respectively. To top it all off, its new ability, Thick Fat, allows it to negate its Fire-type weakness and gain an Ice-type resistance. Along with a wonderful immunity to Electric-type moves, this makes it one of the best checks to the likes of Thundurus, which can give many teams a lot of grief.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Mamoswine, a mere base 80 Speed means that it finds difficulty facing faster threats, and Ice Shard doesn't have enough power to make up for this in most cases. Furthermore, weakness to Fighting- and Steel-type attacks leave it vulnerable to some of the most common physical attackers in the tier, such as Hitmontop and Metagross. It is also weak to common rain abusers, all of which can easily dispose of it with their Water-type STAB attacks. However, Mamoswine's ability to eliminate various top-tier threats makes it more than worth the slot on most teams, and working around its flaws usually won't be difficult.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mamoswine doesn't have very many options to choose from. Endeavor can be used in conjunction with Focus Sash, as after the Focus Sash is broken, Mamoswine is able to bring an opponent down to 1 HP. This is hard to use in most situations thanks to the prevalence of priority attacks, however. Ground Gem can be used to OHKO Tyranitar with Earthquake, though other item choices tend to be superior. A Chople Berry can be used to endure powerful Fighting-type attacks should you lack a good Fighting-type counter on your team. A Choice Band can give Mamoswine's attacks a lot of power, but its lack of Speed and weakness to priority make a Choice Band an inferior choice in most cases. Bulldoze allows Mamoswine to provide its own speed control at the cost of a very noticeable drop in power. Finally, Substitute can be used with careful prediction, giving Mamoswine a useful burn immunity and extra protection against attacks.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Rain is Mamoswine's biggest enemy, as it cannot hit Water-types very hard and Swift Swim sweepers such as Kingdra and Ludicolo can crush it effortlessly. Bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent, Suicune, and Rotom-W, give it similar problems, as it cannot do anything to them and they can proceed to either decimate it or set up on it. Gyarados is one of Mamoswine's greatest enemies, as it lowers its offensive presence with Intimidate and can take it down with Waterfall. Kyurem-B and Kyurem are not as effective, but they can tank its attacks and proceed to decimate it with Dragon Claw and Draco Meteor, respectively.</p> <p>Fighting-types, particularly Scrafty, Hitmontop, Conkeldurr, and Breloom, can hammer it with their powerful STAB attacks. The former two also weaken its attacks with Intimidate and can break Focus Sash with Fake Out if it has one while the latter two pack powerful priority. Additionally, Hitmontop can protect its allies against Earthquake with Wide Guard. Steel-types that don't mind tanking an Earthquake, namely Scizor, Metagross, and Ferrothorn, can proceed to take it out with powerful Steel-type attacks. Getting hit by Intimidate or getting burned will also neuter Mamoswine, as the loss of power will prevent a lot of OHKOs and make it less threatening in general. Finally, Cresselia can tank Mamoswine's attacks any day of the week while supporting its team with moves such as Icy Wind, Trick Room, and Sunny Day.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This set aims to make the most of Mamoswine's offensive abilities, hitting as hard and fast as possible. Earthquake is Mamoswine's strongest Ground-type attack, hitting both of the opposing Pokemon at the cost of also hitting your ally. It is key for taking out Steel-type threats, particularly Heatran. Icicle Spear is Mamoswine's preferred Ice-type STAB option, as it can get past Yache Berries and Focus Sashes, which tend to be very common. However, Icicle Crash is also an option for more reliability and the ability to always OHKO Sitrus Berry Thundurus; it can also make use of an Ice Gem boost while Icicle Spear cannot and has a nifty chance to make the opponent flinch. Ice Shard provides useful STAB priority, and can deal a lot of damage to threats such as Thundurus and Latios. Protect is in the fourth slot as usual because it allows Mamoswine to burn time while its partner takes out something threatening.</p> <p>Focus Sash is the best option for this set, as it allows Mamoswine to survive a powerful attack that comes its way and is not easy to break thanks to Mamoswine's immunity to both hail and sandstorm damage. However, Ice Gem allows Mamoswine to make the most of its powerful Ice-type STAB attacks. If you run Ice Gem, an alternative spread of 40 HP / 248 Atk / 44 Def / 176 Spe with a Jolly nature is preferred, as it allows Mamoswine to still be faster than Breloom while surviving a Life Orb-boosted Mach Punch from it 87.5% of the time. Life Orb is also an option for Mamoswine, as unlike Ice Gem it can be used alongside Icicle Spear, but it comes at the cost of even more bulk thanks to recoil, making it inferior to Ice Gem in most cases.</p> <p>While Mamoswine usually can do what it needs to with its STAB attacks alone, Superpower is an option for this set should you find room for it. Superpower is Mamoswine's best option against Rotom-W, which otherwise completely walls it. Superpower can also hit Bisharp, Ferrothorn, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar harder than Earthquake can. However, in most cases you will not have room for Superpower in Mamoswine's limited moveslots.</p> <p>This set heavily appreciates Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Ludicolo, or those with Sunny Day, all of which help against rain, which this set is very weak to. As Mamoswine also hates Intimidate, good answers to users of Intimidate, such as Rotom-W and Tornadus, also make excellent teammates. Rotom-W and Tornadus are also immune to Earthquake, allowing Mamoswine to use it without risk. Furthermore, Tornadus synergizes well with Mamoswine, taking out Fighting-type threats that threaten it. Due to its lacking Speed stat, Mamoswine also appreciates speed control; Tailwind, Icy Wind, and Thunder Wave all are very helpful for patching up Mamoswine's lackluster Speed. Finally, Heatran is a nice teammate, as it can use Heat Wave to take out Steel-types that threaten Mamoswine. Unfortunately, Heatran is very weak to Earthquake, so Mamoswine will have to play carefully when it is on the field.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This spread aims to make the most of Mamoswine's bulk so that it can tank attacks and hit back hard. Earthquake is the Ground-type STAB of choice, providing a powerful spread attack and hitting common Steel- and Rock-types, such as Metagross and Tyranitar, hard. Icicle Crash is the Ice-type STAB of choice, as it becomes extremely powerful with an Ice Gem boost. To put things into perspective, an Ice Gem-boosted Icicle Crash can OHKO a Yache Berry Landorus-T even after Mamoswine's Attack is lowered by Intimidate. Ice Shard provides priority that can somewhat make up for this set's lacking Speed, as with an Ice Gem it can deal heavy damage to a variety of opponents. Furthermore, Ice Shard can actually OHKO Tornadus and offensive Thundurus 80% of the time with an Ice Gem boost. Protect takes its place in the fourth moveslot, protecting Mamoswine while its partner dispatches a potential threat.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Mamoswine to tank a Superpower from Adamant Landorus-T, an unboosted Draco Meteor from Timid Latios, and anything weaker than those respective attacks. Notably, this includes Mach Punch from Breloom, which can be a big threat to frailer sets.</p> <p>This set has a fair bit of bulk, so it doesn't fear priority as much as the other sets. Still, Tornadus makes for a great partner, removing troubling Fighting-types from the battlefield and discouraging Intimidate abusers from switching in. Additionally, Tornadus is immune to Mamoswine's Earthquake, allowing the mammoth to use it without risk. Heatran is also useful for removing Steel-types that would trouble this set. This set also appreciates Sunny Day support or anything that can handle common rain attackers, such as Rotom-W, Ludicolo, and Gastrodon. Cresselia gets a special mention, as it can provide Sunny Day support, speed control, take out Fighting-types with Psyshock, is immune to Earthquake, and can even use Helping Hand, which allows Ice Shard to gain a lot of OHKOs it normally couldn't on threats such as Hydreigon and Latios. Along with Heatran, Cresselia and Mamoswine can make for a great core, one that is particularly great at countering common threats in the metagame.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf, Mamoswine is capable of moving before fast threats. This allows it to use its stronger STAB attacks, such as Icicle Crash, to KO a lot of threats before they can attack, such as Latios, Thundurus, Tornadus, Thundurus-T, Landorus-T, and Yache Berry Garchomp. Icicle Crash is the preferred Ice-type STAB option, as it is more reliable and comes with a nifty 30% flinch rate; however, this set also runs Icicle Spear to get past common threats such as Focus Sash Landorus-T and Yache Berry Garchomp. Earthquake provides Ground-type STAB and is an ever-so-useful spread attack. The last slot depends on what you want to hit. Rock Slide can be used to OHKO Volcarona, which can be a big threat if it pulls off a Quiver Dance. However, Superpower can also be used, as it nails Ferrothorn and Choice Scarf Tyranitar hard and is also Mamoswine's strongest attack for Rotom-W.</p> <p>The given EV spread does a lot of important things. With 224 EVs in HP and an additional 4 EVs in Defense, Mamoswine can live a Fighting Gem-boosted Mach Punch from Jolly Breloom and an unboosted Draco Meteor from Timid Latios as well as anything weaker. The 160 Speed EVs allow Mamoswine to outspeed positive-natured Pokemon with base 111 Speed, when factoring in the Speed boost from Choice Scarf, and anything slower. The remaining EVs are packed into Attack so that Mamoswine can hit as hard as possible. If you are worried about Choice Scarf Landorus-T, an alternative EV spread of 208 HP / 84 Atk / 56 Def / 160 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used. This spread does all the things that the above spread does, but also survives an Adamant Superpower from Landorus-T at the cost of 36 Attack EVs. This spread does lose out on a notable amount of offensive power, unfortunately.</p> <p>This set partners extremely well with Tornadus. Tornadus discourages Intimidate users from switching in, is immune to Mamoswine's Earthquake, and takes out pesky Fighting-types. The duo of Choice Scarf Mamoswine and Tornadus form a powerful fast-paced attacking core that can eliminate a wide array of common threats. As for all Mamoswine sets, this set appreciates both Sunny Day support and anything that can help check rain teams, such as Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Ludicolo. This set is particularly less fearful of Steel-types, as it can outspeed most of them and hit them with Earthquake. However, Heatran is still a nice partner for eliminating Steel-types. Finally, as this set is designed to take out Thundurus, Landorus-T, and Tornadus safely, anything that hates those threats will appreciate Choice Scarf Mamoswine's support.</p> "

  "Rotom-Heat": {
    "overview": "<p>With Rotom-W presenting itself as a top-tier threat in the Doubles metagame, one would obviously wonder why anyone would use Rotom-H instead. The answer lies in its unique Fire / Electric typing, which in tandem with Levitate gives it a Ground immunity as well as resistances to Electric-, Flying-, Ice-, Grass-, Bug-, Fire-, and Steel-type attacks, many of which are very common in the metagame. Thanks to Rotom-H's large array of resistances, it can reliably check a lot of common threats, including Zapdos, Thundurus, Metagross, Scizor, and Volcarona, that lack Quiver Dance. Additionally, it is also one of the few Fire-types in the Doubles metagame that isn't reliably countered by Water-types, courtesy of its Electric-type STAB moves. It is also efficient offensively, as a Fire Gem-boosted Overheat is capable of frying common threats in the tier such as Scizor, Metagross, and Mamoswine.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Rotom-H has a lot of factors that hold it back from fame. Common sand and rain teams can easily work around it thanks to bulky Rock-types and speedy Swift Swim attackers, respectively. This is further compounded by its two weaknesses to Rock- and Water-types, which will often seem perfectly chosen to set Rotom-H up for failure against the aforementioned types of teams. These problems aren't enough to stop Rotom-H though, as its niche of handling threats such as Zapdos and Thundurus is one that very few other Pokemon can reliably fill.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>ChestoRest can be used to give Rotom-H semi-reliable recovery, allowing it to take advantage of its key resistances to Steel-, Electric-, Fire-, and Grass-type moves while also making it a great switch-in to sleep inducers such as Breloom and Amoonguss. However, Rotom-H loses the important coverage that Hidden Power provides if it chooses to run ChestoRest. The same applies to other useful support moves Rotom-H has access to, including Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, Light Screen, Reflect, Sunny Day, and Swagger. Discharge can be used as an alternate Electric-type STAB move, as it is a spread move with a high chance to paralyze an opposing Pokemon. However, there is a noticeable drop in power between Thunderbolt and Discharge, and the fact that Discharge can hit Rotom-H's partner can be a huge problem. A Choice Specs or Choice Scarf set can be used due to Rotom-H's access to moves such as Trick and Volt Switch. However, Rotom-H is generally outperformed as a Choice user by Rotom-W. Finally, Sitrus Berry can be used to help greatly with Rotom-H's longevity.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Rotom-H is fairly easy to check and counter thanks to its limited coverage and common weaknesses. Water-types that are neutral or immune to Thunderbolt, such as Swampert and Gastrodon, are great counters to Rotom-H, provided that it doesn't carry Hidden Power Grass. Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Latios are also excellent counters, as both resist Rotom-H's STAB moves and take little damage from Hidden Power Ice. They can then proceed to annihilate Rotom-H with a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor. Rock-types that do not take much damage from Thunderbolt, such as Rhyperior, Tyranitar, and Terrakion, are great counters. However, Rhyperior must watch out for Hidden Power Grass. Rain teams are generally troublesome for Rotom-H to face, as, despite its access to Thunderbolt, rain weakens the power of its Overheat and allows Pokemon with the ability Swift Swim, including Kabutops, Ludicolo, and Kingdra, to OHKO Rotom-H. Faster Pokemon carrying a super effective move, such as Manaphy, Landorus-T, and Kyurem-B, can KO Rotom-H after some prior damage.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This set aims to use Rotom-H's offensive potential and large set of resistances to have it function as a bulky hit-and-run attacker. The typical plan is simple: switch in on something that can do very little to Rotom-H, such as Thundurus, slam it with a Fire Gem-boosted Overheat, and then make a hasty exit. Then the set can come back in late-game and proceed to pick off whatever remains with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power. The Hidden Power of choice usually depends on what your team needs help with; Hidden Power Ice is a good option for picking off Dragon-types, especially Garchomp, while Hidden Power Grass hits the majority of Ground-types, notably Gastrodon. Protect rounds off the set, allowing Rotom-H to scout for dangerous attacks while stalling out field effects like Tailwind and Trick Room. It also lets Rotom-H function as bait for attacks while its partner takes out a threat or two.</p> <p>An alternative spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid nature is also viable, as it allows Rotom-H to move before opposing Rotom-W, Heracross, Mamoswine, Suicune, Chandelure, and bulky Thundurus. It is not favorable though, as Rotom-H loses a lot of bulk, which is one of its most valuable assets. Another option is an alternative spread of 252 HP / 104 SpA / 148 SpD and a Calm nature, which allows Rotom-H to survive a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor off of Timid Latios 100% of the time. However, this spread is not preferred, because Rotom-H loses a lot of offensive power and can't do much back to Latios anyway. Finally, Volt Switch can be used over Thunderbolt, allowing Rotom-H to do some damage while switching out, and can potentially allow for a teammate to get a safe switch in, assuming Rotom-H uses Volt Switch after the opposition has moved.</p> <p>When it comes to teammates, Hydreigon is one of the best for Rotom-H offensively, as their combined STAB attacks can dish out heavy damage to the majority of the Doubles metagame. Additionally, Fighting-types such as Hitmontop, Breloom, and Conkeldurr, and any other Pokemon that have a hatred of Flying-types, will work well alongside this set, as Rotom-H can reliably handle the majority of Flying-types in the tier.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W manages to stand out as a premier Water-type in yet another tier thanks to its great typing, bulk, offenses, and ability. Its dual STAB moves coming off of its base 105 Special Attack stat allow it to threaten common Pokemon in weather teams, and from a defensive standpoint, its typing in tandem with its good bulk allows it to check dangerous Pokemon such as Heatran and Kingdra. Its ability in Levitate is the icing on the cake, allowing it to both easily check and partner well with Earthquake users such as Excadrill and Landorus. Sadly for Rotom-W, however, it faces competition from other Electric-types in the tier, most notably Zapdos and Thundurus, who are more powerful and have cooler support options such as Tailwind and priority Thunder Wave. Thankfully, however, Rotom-W's access to Hydro Pump gives it a niche these other threats do not have, allowing it to maim the Ground-types looking to absorb an Electric-type attack. All in all, Rotom-W is a top tier threat that every team should be prepared for.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W can utilize a ChestoRest set to heal off damage and cure itself of status, but the lack of a support move can hinder its effectiveness. A Rain Dance set can be effective to aid Politoed in winning weather wars. Sunny Day might seem like a strange option, but thanks to Rotom-W's typing and bulk, it can take hits from common rain attackers, set up Sunny Day, and maul Politoed with a STAB Thunderbolt. A Life Orb attacker set can be used to grant Rotom-W more attacking power and flexibility, but the recoil hampers its ability to check important threats. Light Screen can be used to pad the Special Defense of Rotom-W and its teammates. A Rindo Berry can be used to let Rotom-W survive a hit from Shaymin-S or Ferrothorn, letting it respond with the appropriate status move. Finally, Electroweb is an interesting option that lets Rotom-W grant more speed control to its team.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Grass- and Dragon-types that resist both of Rotom-W's STAB moves make for good counters to it. Abomasnow can easily switch into all of Rotom-W's moves and hit it hard with a STAB Giga Drain. Ferrothorn and Virizion also switch in with ease and can quickly dispatch Rotom-W, although they both must watch out for Will-O-Wisp. While Breloom and Shaymin-S don't enjoy taking one of Rotom-W's attacks, they can outspeed and KO with Bullet Seed and Seed Flare, respectively. Amoonguss is able to switch into Rotom-W with impunity, redirect its attacks with Rage Powder, put it to sleep with Spore, and heal off the damage with Regenerator. Latios, Latias, Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Kyurem-B can all shrug off attacks from Rotom-W and deal huge amounts of damage back with their Dragon-type STAB moves. Gastrodon is immune to both of Rotom-W's STAB moves. Although it can do little in return of Toxic, it grants its partner full protection from Rotom-W's Hydro Pump.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With this set, Rotom-W makes an excellent offensive support Pokemon and can use its good bulk and offensive power to check powerful Pokemon such as Excadrill, Kingdra, and Tyranitar. Hydro Pump is a great attacking move here, as it is very powerful and has excellent neutral coverage. It also decimates Ground-types and Tyranitar, both of which wouldn't mind taking a Thunderbolt. The fact that it gets a boost under rain allows Rotom-W to be both a nice rain partner and an even better rain check. Thunderbolt is a nice secondary STAB move, mauling the bulky Water-types that would otherwise not be threatened by Rotom-W. Thunderbolt also gives Rotom-W a more accurate attacking option than Hydro Pump. Thunder Wave is used here in order to cripple faster Pokemon and allow Rotom-W to better support its team. It is also nice to give Rotom-W a way to hit Pokemon that otherwise would not be very threatened by it, such as Latios. Will-O-Wisp is nice to cripple physical attackers, but paralysis is generally a more useful status condition.</p> <p>Sitrus Berry is the main item on this set because it helps boost Rotom-W's survivabiity, allowing it to continue to be a threat to the opponent as well as granting it the ability to take multiple hits in a single turn when needed. Alternatively, Rotom-W may hold a Water Gem or an Electric Gem to power one of its STAB moves to net quicker KOs. The investment in bulk is used to let Rotom-W survive a Life Orb-boosted Giga Drain from Ludicolo and either cripple it with paralysis or hit it with a Thunderbolt; the rest of the EVs are invested in Rotom-W's Special Attack to allow it to hit the things it checks for solid damage. Hidden Power Grass is a nice option to hit Gastrodon, which is otherwise a huge problem for this set. However, the loss of a support move can hamper Rotom-W's effectiveness. Thunder is a nice option in rain to grant Rotom-W more power, but its accuracy is shaky outside of rain, which can be a problem. Another option for this set is Discharge, as it gives Rotom-W a spread move with a nice paralysis chance. However, there is a noticeable drop in power between it and Thunderbolt, and the fact that it can also hit your partner can be a huge problem as it either forces Rotom-W's partner to Protect or forces you to pair Rotom-W with a Pokemon with an immunity to Electric-type attacks.</p> <p>Because Rotom-W is vulnerable to Grass- and Dragon-types that don't mind its attacks, Pokemon that can handle them such as Scizor and Abomasnow make for great partners. Scizor resists both Grass- and Dragon-type moves and can damage their users heavily with its Technician-boosted attacks. Abomasnow's STAB Blizzards can easily threaten both Grass- and Dragon-types, and it can also take care of Gastrodon with Giga Drain, making it another good choice. Other good partners include Hitmontop for its Intimidate support, Latios for its ability to outspeed other Dragon-types and beat Grass-types, and Tornadus for outspeeding all common Dragon-types and decimating things that can threaten Rotom-W with a Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus can also be effective partners, as they appreciate Rotom-W's ability to check rain as well as its paralysis support; they also don't have to worry about hitting Rotom-W with Earthquake thanks to its Levitate ability.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>With Choice Specs and maximum Special Attack investment, Rotom-W's Special Attack reaches a whopping 509, letting it dish out serious pain to just about anything it attacks. Hydro Pump is the main STAB attack here, and it is a great move to be locked into thanks to its great coverage and high power, which lets it heavily damage Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Scizor. Thunderbolt is the secondary STAB move and has nice coverage with Hydro Pump, eliminating pesky Water-types such as Jellicent and Suicune that don't mind a Hydro Pump. It also allows Rotom-W to be locked into a more reliable STAB move and not have to risk Hydro Pump's 80% accuracy. Thunder might seem like a strange option alongside Thunderbolt, but it serves an important purpose. Even if you are using Rotom-W outside of rain, Thunder is necessary to net important KOs against common rain Pokemon, making this set a much better rain check. Here are some damage calculations comparing the power of Thunder to that of Thunderbolt:</p> <ul> <li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Thunderbolt vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Ludicolo: 220-259 (73.57 - 86.62%) -- guaranteed 2HKO <li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Thunder vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Ludicolo: 277-327 (92.64 - 109.36%) -- 56.25% chance to OHKO</li> <li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Thunderbolt vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Kingdra: 229-270 (78.69 - 92.78%) -- guaranteed 2HKO</li> <li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Thunder vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Kingdra: 288-340 (98.96 - 116.83%) -- 93.75% chance to OHKO</li> </ul> <p>If you are uncomfortable using Thunder outside of rain, Trick is another good option, as it lets you cripple a Pokemon by locking it into a move, severely hampering its usability. Trick is also useful because it prevents Pokemon from effectively taking advantage of moves such as Fake Out and Protect. Hidden Power Grass is mainly used to eliminate Gastrodon, which is very important because Gastrodon is immune to both of its STAB moves and not only redirects but also gets a boost from Hydro Pump. Hidden Power Ice is also an option to be able to eliminate Salamence and Shaymin-S. However, Thunder is able to OHKO both of them, so keep that in mind when deciding whether to use it.</p> <p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to fire off an attack while gaining momentum, but it is weaker than Thunderbolt and isn't able to be used as reliably due to forcing Rotom-W out when it is used. Another option for this set is Discharge, as it gives Rotom-W a spread move with a high chance to paralyze an opposing Pokemon. However, there is a noticable drop in power between it and Thunderbolt, and the fact that it can hit Rotom-W's partner can be a huge problem. This set really enjoys rain support, as not only does it grant Hydro Pump more power but it also allows Rotom-W to use Thunder reliably. The EVs allow Rotom-W to live a Life Orb-boosted Giga Drain from Ludicolo, which is even more important on this set because Rotom-W has a high chance to OHKO it in return with Thunder.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Scizor and Tornadus that can reliably eliminate Grass- and Dragon-types make good partners for this set as well. Garchomp, Excadrill, and Landorus appreciate this set's ability to easily wear down defensive Pokemon so they can clean up late-game. They also enjoy the fact that they can use their powerful Earthquakes without worrying about hurting Rotom-W. Cresselia also makes for a great partner as it can provide the speed control that Rotom-W likes having. It also enjoys the fact that this set can easily destroy things such as Scizor and Tyranitar that would otherwise threaten it.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf set, Rotom-W can outspeed and beat faster threats such as Tornadus. Hydro Pump is one of the main STAB moves used, and it is a great attacking option due to its high Base Power and its impeccable coverage. It is also great because it can eliminate Ground-types which are looking to absorb a Thunderbolt or Volt Switch; it also hits Tyranitar, which otherwise would not be bothered by anything on this set. Thunderbolt is another great attacking option because it hits bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Politoed and is more reliable than Hydro Pump due to its perfect accuracy. Volt Switch is a great option for picking off weakened Pokemon while maintaining offensive momentum. It is also a great way to bring in Pokemon such as Politoed to give your team an edge in weather wars. Trick is a great option to cripple defensive Pokemon that might try to take advantage of the fact that Rotom-W will be locked into a move. The fact that it disrupts the use of moves such as Fake Out and Protect is also a nice bonus. Hidden Power Grass is the main option on this set to get rid of Gastrodon, which is very important because Rotom-W has no way to get past it otherwise. However, Hidden Power Ice is an option to KO Shaymin-S and Salamence.</p> <p>The EVs are very simple and are meant to make Rotom-W as fast and as powerful as possible. A Timid nature is slashed first in order to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Heracross, but if this benchmark isn't necessary for your team, a Modest nature can be used for more power, netting useful KOs such as an OHKO on Tyranitar outside of Sand. Thunder is an option over Thunderbolt, but it should only be used with rain support, as otherwise its accuracy will be too shaky. Sadly, due to the lack of investment in bulk, this set has more trouble switching into hits than others. This set works best on teams that are slower and need a way to take on fast attackers, so teams utilizing strategies such as Tailwind will likely be better served by another one.</p> <p>Politoed makes for a great partner for this set, giving Hydro Pump a large boost in power and enabling Rotom-W to use Thunder instead of Thunderbolt. In addition, Politoed appreciates Rotom-W's access to Volt Switch, as it allows Politoed to perform better in weather wars. Pokemon that can defeat the Grass- and Dragon-types that don't mind taking on this set, such as Scizor, Abomasnow, and Tornadus, make for good partners. Cresselia makes for another good partner to this set as it can provide Helping Hand support, allowing Rotom-W to gain KOs that it might otherwise miss out on, such as an OHKO on Shaymin-S with Thunder.</p> "

  "Manaphy": {
    "overview": "<p>Manaphy's cute exterior hides one of the most powerful sweepers in the Doubles metagame. While it might seem like it's outclassed by Kingdra and Ludicolo in rain, it actually has several aspects that let it stand out over the Swift Swim users. Tail Glow boosts Manaphy's Special Attack to astronomical levels, allowing it to run straight through more offensive teams and punch huge holes in pretty much everything else. In addition, Manaphy has access to Hydration, meaning that not only does it get its STAB boosted in rain, but it becomes darn near impossible to take down with Rest. It doesn't even really need rain though, as it generally hits things incredibly hard regardless of weather, with the exception of sun. It even has nice bulk, letting it take a surprising number of hits.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Manaphy is not without its shortcomings. It is outsped by almost all of the Pokemon that threaten it, such as Latios and Thundurus, and has a severe case of four-moveslot syndrome, since it often lacks enough room for everything it needs to run. Manaphy also has an issue that many other Pokemon do not: it's surprisingly difficult to build a team around. With its main offensive move being a ridiculously strong Surf, Manaphy's pool of potential partners is heavily restricted, as otherwise viable choices will hate Surf just as much as its opponents. Nonetheless, Manaphy is one of the most terrifying Pokemon to run up against, especially in rain, and priority should always be given to its removal. Oh, did I mention it's adorable?</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Manaphy lacks very many useful options, as most coverage attacks are outclassed by the sheer power of its STAB attacks in rain. Psychic is an option for taking out Toxicroak, but it achieves nothing else and a +3 Ice Beam already OHKOes Toxicroak most of the time. Blizzard can be used alongside hail, as it is a powerful spread attack that works great in tandem with Manaphy's STAB options. Note that Rest no longer remains an option if using hail support, however. Calm Mind is an option over Tail Glow on the defensive Tail Glow set, as after a few Special Defense boosts Manaphy cannot be broken through by even the strongest attackers such as Rotom-W and Ludicolo and can easily heal off damage using Rest. If this set is used, an alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA and a Bold nature would be preferred, maximizing Manaphy's physical bulk so that it is nigh indestructible after a few Calm Mind boosts. Acid Armor is an option to use alongside Calm Mind, making Manaphy virtually unbreakable bar a critical hit, but this would leave Manaphy without coverage and make it incredibly weak to Taunt. You can run an all-out attacking set with Surf, Ice Beam, and Energy Ball, but Ludicolo presents stiff competition for such a set. Heart Swap allows Manaphy to pass Tail Glow boosts to its partners, which can be very useful, especially if they do not have access to Psych Up. Manaphy struggles to find room for such an option on a set, however. Manaphy has access to both Light Screen and Reflect, as well as many other support options including Helping Hand and Safeguard. However, Manaphy is generally better off taking advantage of Tail Glow and doesn't have the room in its crowded four moveslots to make use of these options. Finally, Manaphy can use Choices Specs, allowing it to hit hard without the need to use Tail Glow, but its attacks are significantly weaker at +1 than at +3.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Faster Electric-types, such as Thundurus and Thundurus-T, present a big threat to Manaphy. However, Electric-types need to be wary of Wacan Berry, as at +3 Manaphy can easily OHKO them. Dragon-types such as Latios, Kyurem, Kyurem-B, and Kingdra are also good checks, though many must also be wary of Ice Beam. Kyurem-B in particular is a great check, as a Life Orb-boosted Fusion Bolt has a chance to OHKO Manaphy, who can do little in return other than hope for a Scald burn. Choice Scarf users, especially Genesect, present Manaphy with similar problems so long as they can KO. Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Jellicent threaten Manaphy as well, as they resist its STAB moves and Ice Beam. Rotom-W in particular can be very troubling, as it packs a super effective STAB attack. Jellicent also is immune to Surf and is able to set up Trick Room and chip away at Manaphy's health should it lack Rest. Most bulky Water-types must be wary of a Tail Glow-boosted Energy Ball, however.</p> <p>Grass-types neutral to Ice Beam, such as Ferrothorn and Ludicolo, can smack Manaphy around with their STAB attacks while they take very little damage from Manaphy's attacks. Shaymin-S is also an excellent check granted it gets a safe switch-in, as it can OHKO Manaphy with a Life Orb-boosted Seed Flare. Abomasnow is a solid answer as well, as it can weaken Manaphy's Water-type STAB attacks thanks to Snow Warning, can tank an Ice Beam even if Manaphy is at +3 from Tail Glow, and can strike back with Wood Hammer or Giga Drain. Common Prankster users can be a nuisance; for example, Whimsicott and Thundurus can prevent Manaphy from setting up or sweeping thanks to priority Taunt and Encore, respectively. Finally, Sunny Day and Drought can put a stop to Manaphy's sweep, as they will make its STAB attacks incredibly lacking in power, even at +3.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Tail Glow",
        "description": "<p>This is Manaphy's trademark set in Doubles. With Tail Glow boosting its Special Attack three stages, Manaphy becomes absolutely deadly. This set is pretty straightforward, honestly. Set up when there's an opening late-game and just tear through the opponent. Surf will hit both opponents and maximizes sweeping potential at the cost of hitting a teammate, while Scald hits one opponent slightly harder and has a fair shot to burn the opponent. Ice Beam is for all of those pesky Dragon- and Grass-types that resist Surf. The last slot is a tossup between Protect and Rest. The former grants a key immunity to just about anything for a single turn, as if Manaphy is KOed, then all of its hard work will go to waste. The latter heals Manaphy back to full health and works great with Hydration in rain. Manaphy can choose between either Wacan Berry to take a stray Thunderbolt or Life Orb to pack even more power; however, if Life Orb is used, it is highly recommended to use Rest as well, as the item's recoil makes Manaphy susceptible to faster attacks like Latios's Draco Meteor and Breloom's Mach Punch.</p> <p>Blizzard is an alternative to Ice Beam that hits two opponents, and while its accuracy in neutral weather can be worrying, Manaphy is a pretty good addition to hail teams. Energy Ball can go in either of the last two slots as well, but Ice Beam gets generally better coverage, so Energy Ball should only be used if one has huge problems with bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon, Politoed, and Suicune.</p> <p>This set is best brought out late-game, when Manaphy can simply tear through even its normal checks with some prior damage. It really isn't as simple as finding a setup opportunity, unfortunately, as Manaphy's stats are only a bit above average and its typing leaves it with fairly common weaknesses in Electric and Grass. Even when Manaphy gets going, it still needs support to keep going, or it could miss a crucial KO and get destroyed or set up on in return. Outside of Politoed, which brings permanent rain to power up Surf and activate Hydration, Musharna and Parasect are possibly the two best teammates Manaphy could ever ask for to provide support. Musharna can prevent Trick Room with Imprison and power up Surf with Helping Hand while taking no damage from it due to Telepathy. Parasect might not be able to augment Manaphy's power like that, but Rage Powder and Spore are invaluable to Manaphy, and Manaphy heals Parasect with Surf due to Dry Skin. Parasect can also easily tank Grass- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Manaphy with Rage Powder. Manaphy appreciates partners that can use moves such as Thunder Wave and Tailwind to help it move before the opponent. Gastrodon is also an option if you wish to overwhelm your opponent by spamming powerful spread moves. Hitmontop is a valuable partner as well, if only for its ability to destroy Ferrothorn with Close Combat.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Defensive Tail Glow",
        "description": "<p>This set is well-suited for punching holes in the opponent to allow for another Pokemon to sweep. To ensure that Manaphy can pull off such a strategy, the set is constructed a bit differently than sets more focused on outright sweeping with Manaphy. In fact, Tail Glow is really the only thing this set has in common with them. Scald and Energy Ball are the preferred offensive moves on this set for a couple of reasons. The lack of Surf makes Manaphy easier to either build around or just tack onto the end of a team, and Energy Ball lures out and pummels bulky Water-types like Gastrodon, paving the way for a sweeper like Kingdra to pick up the pieces. However, Surf is still an option over Scald, as hitting both opponents can come in handy. Ice Beam can also be used over Energy Ball, as it can hit Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Manaphy's STAB attacks for heavy damage. Rest capitalizes on this set's bulk in tandem with rain, allowing Manaphy to heal any damage taken and then be cured of its sleep by Hydration at the end of the turn. Protect is an option over Rest, as it enables Manaphy to guard itself against potentially fatal attacks while its ally takes out the source of them.</p> <p>Wacan Berry is the preferred item for this set, as it lets Manaphy get past would-be checks such as Thundurus and Thundurus-T. However, Sitrus Berry is also an option, giving Manaphy some extra longevity to help it set up with less difficulty. With the given spread Manaphy can outspeed positive-natured Pokemon with base 70 Speed, such as Breloom. The given Special Attack investment allows for a +3 Scald to OHKO both Breloom and even the bulkiest Thundurus sets in the rain. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP in order for Manaphy to sponge as many hits as possible, with a few thrown into Special Defense so that Manaphy can survive a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor off of Timid Latios.</p> <p>Due to the lack of Surf, this set has much more freedom for teammates than it would otherwise. First and foremost, Politoed is almost a required teammate for this set as it needs Drizzle support in order to make the most of its bulk with Rest and boost the power of its STAB attacks. This set is great at luring out bulky Water-types and decimating them with Energy Ball, so it works nicely alongside Pokemon that are countered by bulky Water-types and function efficiently in rain, such as Kingdra and Scizor. Assuming you don't run Ice Beam, this set will have a difficult time getting around Dragon-types. As such, teammates that can dispose of Dragon-types, such as Weavile, Mamoswine, and Kingdra, are much appreciated. Cresselia also makes for a helpful teammate, as it can make Manaphy even more threatening by supporting it with Icy Wind and Helping Hand. Finally, Amoonguss and Parasect make for good teammates, as even with its bulk this set appreciates Rage Powder support, which pressures the opponent to avoid double-targeting Manaphy. Amoonguss is the preferred partner unless you are running Surf in most cases, as it has higher bulk and an overall better Grass / Poison typing.</p> "

  "Darkrai": {
    "overview": "<p>Power, Speed, and versatility—it's hard to find all of these things in a single package—but Darkrai has all three. Possessing an extremely fast base Speed of 125 and a monstrous base Special Attack of 135, Darkrai can hit hard and fast. To make things better, it has access to a movepool with a plethora of options, both offensive and support. On top of all of this, it has access to Dark-type STAB, a type that can hit many top support Pokemon such as Cresselia and Musharna for super effective damage, as well as hit many Pokemon for at least neutral damage. Combined with the high number of coverage moves it has, there is very little Darkrai cannot hit for at least neutral damage.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Darkrai isn't perfect. Possessing only passable defensive stats of 70 / 90 / 90 and an annoying weakness to Fighting-type moves (one of the most common coverage types in the game), Darkrai isn't difficult to KO. In addition, it unfortunately lacks access to a high-powered STAB and a powerful spread move, which serves to somewhat undermine its high Special Attack. To further compound matters, speed control of any sort (paralysis, Tailwind, Trick Room) from the enemy winds up utterly crippling Darkrai, as it heavily relies on going first in order to take as little damage as possible. Finally, Darkrai has four-moveslot syndrome, which somewhat undermines its versatility.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The most notable other option that Darkrai has, in order to make use of its extensive supportive movepool and passable defensive stats, would be a set with a Sitrus Berry and an EV spread of 252 HP / 112 SpA / 144 Spe EVs, alongside a Timid nature, having the moves Snarl, Icy Wind, Will-O-Wisp, and Taunt. The EVs are set to maximize bulk and outspeed everything notable after an Icy Wind drop, with the rest put into Special Attack. Though potentially very useful, it can be quite difficult to fit on a team and suffers stiff competition from the likes of Suicune, Raikou, and Cresselia; still, the ability to drop the opposing Pokemon's Special Attack with a decent STAB move is not to be underestimated.</p> <p>Snarl can be an option on the main set, as it provides a spread move for Darkrai to hit foes with, but its power might not be optimal. A Choice Specs set with Trick can be an option if more power is desired out of the gate. Spacial Rend can be used to hit Dragons neutral to Ice, and it also provides decent neutral coverage. Hypnosis in conjunction with Gravity support is an option. Psych Up can be used on some gimmicky teams. Icy Wind can be used for both a (very weak) spread option and speed control. Torment on the right team could possibly be useful. Finally, Dark Gem can be used for a one-time boost of power without HP loss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While powerful, Darkrai isn't exactly lacking in checks or counters. Fighting-types pose significant problems to Darkrai. Hitmontop and Conkeldurr can straight out murder it and fear only Psychic. Heracross threatens Darkrai with both STABs, though is threatened by both Psychic and Ice Beam. Scrafty can OHKO Darkrai with Drain Punch and heal itself at the same time, but falls to a Focus Blast. Virizion's Focus Blast is a huge concern, but it falls to both Ice Beam and Psychic.</p> <p>Bug / Steel types such as Scizor, Genesect, and Escavalier also severely threaten Darkrai and are not threatened by Dark Pulse or Ice Beam, though they fall to Hidden Power Fire. Trick Room is a huge liability to Darkrai, as it turns its fast Speed against it, making it easy pickings. Thunder Wave from the likes of bulky Thundurus is a good method of dealing with Darkrai, as it cuts down on Darkrai's Speed, leaving it open to a KO by just about anything. Anything that is specially bulky and not weak to Dark Pulse, examples being Politoed, Gastrodon, Amoonguss, and Jirachi, also gives Darkrai a hard time. Finally, anything that outspeeds Darkrai and deals massive damage to it, such as weather sweepers (particularly Excadrill and Kingdra) and Choice Scarf users with high power can simply KO Darkrai before it gets a chance to act. Deoxys-A can outspeed and OHKO with Superpower, though it is OHKOed in turn by Darkrai.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Although Darkrai has a lot of tricks up its sleeve, its standard set is pretty straightforward. Dark Pulse is run for STAB, while Ice Beam is the primary coverage option, since many top-tier Doubles threats are weak to Ice. For the third moveslot, if you desire coverage, you have your choice between Focus Blast, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Fire. While Focus Blast is the preferred option, since Darkrai isn't really fan of Steel-types such as Ferrothorn or Excadrill, Thunderbolt gives access to the coveted BoltBeam combination, as well as help Darkrai with its troubles against bulky Water-types such as Suicune. Hidden Power Fire is pretty much exclusively for Scizor, Escavalier, and Ferrothorn; be sure to run 31 / 2 / 31 / 30 / 31 / 30 IVs if you're using Hidden Power Fire. If additional coverage is not of concern, Darkrai can instead run Taunt, which is extremely useful for shutting down all of the supportive moves that fly around in Doubles. Finally, Protect provides Darkrai with both an extremely solid defensive option and useful utility in aiding the stalling out of field moves such as Trick Room and Tailwind.</p> <p>While Life Orb is the item primarily used due to Darkrai requiring all of the power it can get its hands on, Chople Berry is a viable alternative to keep Darkrai from instantly dying when a Fighting-type sneezes on it. The EVs and Timid nature enable Darkrai to just barely outspeed Choice Scarf Tyranitar, but Darkrai can use a Modest nature and 252 Speed EVs if said Pokemon and the additional bulk are not a concern; plus, it can still outspeed everything up to Jolly Terrakion. If you're running Darkrai with rain support, Thunder is an option, as is Blizzard should you run Darkrai with hail support. If you wish for Darkrai to have even more power, you can use Nasty Plot, but it requires Fake Out/Rage Powder support to work, as Darkrai is too frail to take a hit. Substitute is an option, both to act as a pseudo-Protect against everything slower than Darkrai (almost all of Doubles) and to provide it with a shield should Darkrai properly use it with Fake Out or Rage Powder support from its teammates. Psychic is an option if you're scared of Fighting-types. Finally, if you desire more utility, Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Disable are all very useful.</p> <p>Optimal partners for Darkrai include Pokemon such as Breloom and Conkeldurr, which appreciate Psychic- and Ghost-types removed from the field. Pokemon that can remove Fighting- and Steel-types, such as Chandelure, Tornadus, Latios, and Expert Belt Cresselia, also make for fantastic partners, as they can easily enable Darkrai to wreak some serious havoc with its banes removed.</p> "

  "Shaymin-Sky": {
    "overview": "<p>As the only Pokemon that was unanimously banned from OU, it should be no surprise that Shaymin-S is a threat to prepare for in Doubles. Thanks to its high Speed, Shaymin-S is able to outspeed a large number of important threats such as Darkrai, Terrakion, Garchomp, and Tornadus, as well as various Choice Scarf users such as Tyranitar and Abomasnow. Shaymin-S also has the ability Serene Grace, which gives its two main STAB moves, Seed Flare and Air Slash, an 80% chance to lower the foe's Special Defense and a 60% chance to flinch, respectively. Shaymin's Grass / Flying typing makes it an excellent check to common Pokemon such as Hitmontop, Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Breloom. Unlike several other powerhouses, such as Hydreigon and Latios, Shaymin-S's main STAB move, Seed Flare, eases prediction due to its high chance of a Special Defense drop. Shaymin can also eliminate common Pokemon with the ability Intimidate, such as Hitmontop, which can aid several physical attackers.</p> <p>Shaymin-S is not without its faults, however. Despite its typing giving it resistances to the common Water- and Fighting-type moves, it also plagues it with weaknesses to Rock-, Ice-, and Fire-type moves, three common attacking types in Doubles, and will most likely be OHKOed by these moves due to its subpar bulk. Furthermore, Shaymin-S struggles to OHKO anything that isn't weak to its moves without a flinch from Air Slash or a Special Defense drop from Seed Flare. Despite these setbacks, Shaymin-S will make an amazing addition to any Doubles team in need of check to Water- and Fighting-types; just make sure to work around its Ice- and Rock-type weaknesses.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shaymin-S lacks many other options due to its mediocre movepool. Shaymin-S can use Healing Wish in conjunction with a Focus Sash to attack once or twice and heal a damaged teammate. However, Shaymin-S's average bulk means that it may not always pull off this tactic, despite its amazing Speed. Shaymin-S can use a Choice Scarf to a great effect, as this allows it to outspeed opposing Choice Scarf users such as Genesect as well as every Swift Swim Sweeper up to Timid Kingdra. Shaymin-S also has several support moves such as Safeguard, Worry Seed, and Leech Seed, but this is better left to Whimsicott, which can immediately use these moves due to Prankster. Finally, Shaymin-S can use Leaf Storm to have a higher chance to OHKO Tyranitar, but it is inferior to Seed Flare in nearly every other situation.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Despite Shaymin-S's high Speed and Special Attack, its limited coverage makes it relatively easy to counter. As previously mentioned, Thundurus is Shaymin-S's greatest counter, as it can take one Hidden Power Ice and either cripple it with Thunder Wave or deal a large amount of damage with its own Hidden Power Ice. Zapdos and Thundurus-T can do similar jobs, but both lack the ability to immediately cripple Shaymin-S with a Prankster Thunder Wave. Rotom-H also makes a solid counter to Shaymin-S, as it resists everything in Shaymin-S's arsenal and can OHKO it with a Fire Gem-boosted Overheat. Cresselia is able to take two Life Orb-boosted Seed Flares from Shaymin-S and either cripple it with Thunder Wave or deal an enormous amount of damage with Icy Wind. Cresselia dislikes the Special Defense drops from Seed Flare and flinches from Air Slash, however. Bulky Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B, Hydreigon, and Latios are able to take one super effective Hidden Power Ice, or in Kyurem-B's case, Air Slash, and OHKO with their respective STAB attacks. Bulky Fire-types such as Chandelure, Heatran, and Victini aren't fazed by anything Shaymin-S throws at them apart from a Life Orb-boosted Earth Power and can OHKO in return with their respective Fire STAB. Steel-types such as Bisharp, Metagross, and Jirachi, as well as bulky Flying-types such as Tornadus and Togekiss, can function as solid checks to Shaymin-S, taking a hit and retaliating with their powerful STAB moves. Bisharp and Tornadus even benefit from Seed Flare's Special Defense drop due to Defiant, while Metagross is unaffected by it due to Clear Body. If you happen to lack any defensive answers to Shaymin-S, then revenge killing it is always an option. Weavile and Mamoswine can both bypass Shaymin-S's amazing Speed with a 4x super effective Ice Shard, while Choice Scarf users such as Genesect, Kyurem-B, Kyurem, and Cloyster can revenge kill Shaymin-S with an Ice move, even if it is carrying a Yache Berry. Pokemon with the Swift Swim ability, such as Ludicolo and Kingdra, can also revenge kill Shaymin-S with their boosted Speed in the rain. In the sand, Excadrill is a solid check to Shaymin-S, as a Life Orb-boosted Iron Head will bring Shaymin-S down to its knees. The rare Crobat and Aerodactyl are naturally faster than Shaymin-S and destroy it with Acrobatics and Stone Edge, respectively. Finally, Trick Room teams can make Shaymin-S's Speed a liability, as it is outsped by nearly every Pokemon in Doubles under the twisted dimensions.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With this set, Shaymin-S is able to support its team by removing threats such as Gastrodon and Hitmontop. Air Slash functions as Shaymin-S's main STAB move thanks to its amazing coverage in Doubles as well as its 60% chance to flinch, which can give free turns to both Shaymin-S and its partner. Seed Flare is Shaymin-S's secondary STAB move, OHKOing all but the most specially defensive Gastrodon through its Rindo Berry and can help several of Shaymin-S's teammates achieve more OHKOs thanks to its 80% chance to lower the foe's Special Defense. Earth Power allows Shaymin-S to hit bulky Fire- and Steel-types such as Metagross and Heatran for decent damage. Hidden Power Ice is an equally effective option, as it can hit several of Shaymin-S's counters, such as Thundurus, Hydreigon, and Tornadus for a great amount of damage. Protect allows Shaymin-S to scout what its foe is doing, as well as protect it from spread moves.</p> <p>A Life Orb is the recommended item for this set to increase Shaymin-S's damage output as well as OHKO standard Hitmontop after one turn of sandstorm damage. However, a Focus Sash can be used to survive various attacks, given that Shaymin-S is quite frail. Shaymin-S can also use a Grass Gem to have a decent chance to OHKO Tyranitar, but this item is not useful in any other situation. Tailwind is a viable option on this set, as Shaymin-S has access to one of the fastest non-Prankster Tailwinds in the game. However, this is better left to dedicated Tailwind users, such as Togekiss and Tornadus.</p> <p>Thundurus is Shaymin-S's worst nightmare, as it resists both of Shaymin-S's main STAB moves and can either neuter Shaymin-S with Thunder Wave or deal a tremendous amount of damage with Hidden Power Ice, so packing a counter to it such as Choice Scarf Mamoswine is recommended. While not required, Thunder Wave support is extremely useful, as it increases the chance of the foe doing nothing when combined with Air Slash. Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Hydreigon are very good partners, as they can all heavily damage Pokemon that give Shaymin-S trouble, such as Cresselia and Thundurus. Heatran and Kingdra are able to to defeat the Steel- and Fire-types that can easily wall Shaymin-S. Volcarona and Jirachi are also solid partners for this set, as the former can dismantle Latios, Latias, and Hydreigon with Bug Buzz as well as Steel-types and Thundurus with a Fire Gem-boosted Overheat, while the latter can redirect the threatening Ice- and Rock-type moves. Despite overlapping your team's Ice weakness, Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill are excellent partners, as they can defeat the Fire- and Steel-types that give Shaymin-S trouble. In return, Shaymin-S can defeat the Water- and Fighting-types, such as Breloom and Gastrodon, that give those Pokemon trouble. Shaymin's typing also lets them use Earthquake with no repercussions.</p> "

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill is the king of the sand in Doubles, thanks to its amazing abilities, good typing, ability to fire off powerful STAB Earthquakes, and huge Attack stat. Not only does Excadrill become one of the fastest Pokemon in the game in sand but also it can take advantage of two very powerful spread moves, Earthquake and Rock Slide. Excadrill is also immune to both Thunder Wave and Toxic, so you can't slow this monster down the easy way.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A couple of interesting options Excadrill has involve giving it an immunity to Earthquake. Both an Air Balloon and Magnet Rise make Excadrill immune to Ground-type attacks, which can be useful in certain situations. Swords Dance is another move you could run, but it's not as easy to pull off in Doubles as it was in OU. Drill Run hits a single target harder than Earthquake would, as Earthquake only deals 75% of its normal damage due to being a spread move. Finally, Excadrill can run a Choiced Mold Breaker set, which would allow it to seriously hurt some of its counters, but it would be difficult to fit it into a team and might even be harmful in some situations.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Pokemon that have good bulk and an immunity to Earthquake often find themselves countering Excadrill. Such Pokemon include Hitmontop, Landorus-T, Landorus, Scrafty, Rotom-W, Cresselia, and Gyarados, as they can all either Intimidate Excadrill or take middling damage from its moves. Wide Guard is a move that Excadrill isn't too fond of, and Pokemon such as Hitmontop, Mienshao, and Swampert can take advantage of it to prevent Excadrill from even doing any damage. Pokemon that can kill Excadrill before it can hurt anything are useful against it as well; Conkeldurr and Breloom come to mind with STAB Mach Punch. Lastly, the most obvious counter is rain, which makes Politoed extremely threatening to Excadrill because of its weather changing ability, which can render Excadrill useless.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Excadrill is an extremely one-dimensional Pokemon. It attacks, hits hard, and tries not to get hit hard. It's a Pokemon that can be used at any stage in the game to do major damage, as it can punch major holes at the start of the battle or clean up at the end. The two main moves on the set are Earthquake and Rock Slide, both of which are spread moves. Earthquake is used as a powerful STAB move, and Rock Slide is used to hurt Flying-types and Levitate users such as Zapdos and Rotom-W. The third slot can have a variety of moves. Iron Head can be used as a single target STAB, Substitute can be used on free turns with team support, and X-Scissor can be used as another single target attack to hit Pokemon like Hydreigon and Cresselia harder than Rock Slide can.</p> <p>Life Orb is the set's main item because it further boosts Excadrill's amazing Attack stat. A Chople Berry can also be used in order to survive Mach Punch from a Breloom that isn't holding a Fighting Gem. Adamant is the preferred nature in order to maximize Excadrill's damage output. The EVs on this set are very basic because Excadrill isn't trying to accomplish anything fancy. An EV spread of 52 HP / 252 Atk / 204 Spe with an Adamant nature can also be used. This spread allows Excadrill to outrun Choice Scarf Latios, but it loses to other Excadrill running max Speed.</p> <p>Because Excadrill is a Pokemon that takes advantage of the fact it has a powerful Ground-type STAB, it's only fitting that its teammates should try to avoid being caught in the crossfire. Some of the better teammates Excadrill can ask for are fast special attackers such as Latios and Tornadus. Latios can seriously hurt Fighting-types that threaten Excadrill directly, and the threat of Defiant from Tornadus prevents Intimidate users from freely switching in. Other good teammates include Rotom-W, who has good STAB moves and bulk; Cresselia, because of Helping Hand and her Psychic typing; Pokemon that help deal with rain, such as Latias and Thundurus; and Tyranitar for its ability to summon the sandstorm that makes Excadrill so dangerous in the first place.</p> <p>Excadrill can attempt to use a variety of items. Leftovers could be used to Substitute stall sandstorm and Life Orb damage, and a Gem could be used to deal large amounts of damage in a single turn. Focus Sash could be used to survive an otherwise-fatal hit and a Lum Berry could be used alongside a teammate such as Cresselia that has access to Swagger to further increase Excadrill's Attack.</p> "

  "Scrafty": {
    "overview": "<p>Scrafty has a unique Dark / Fighting typing which allows it to dominate Tyranitar and Cresselia, two of the greatest tanks in Doubles. Intimidate is a great ability in Doubles that works very well with Scrafty's impressive bulk. Its immunity to Psychic-type moves also allows it to stand out from Hitmontop, the other Intimidate-using Fighting-type in the tier. Scrafty also stands out from Hitmontop with its ability to bite off large chunks of health from Chandelure, Cresselia, and Latios with STAB Crunch. Its access to Fake Out further bolsters its utility in Doubles. However, Scrafty suffers from having a poor Speed stat, which leaves it outsped by a lot of Pokemon. Hitmontop gives Scrafty competition as a Fighting-type with Intimidate and has access to other useful support moves such as Wide Guard, Feint, and Helping Hand. Scrafty also lacks massive firepower, having only base 90 Attack and relatively weak STAB moves. However, it is able to hit many prevalent threats in Doubles for super effective damage, and can provide a more prolonged Intimidate + Fake Out support than Hitmontop thanks to its superior bulk.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hi Jump Kick is a usable move over Drain Punch for its great power, but as Protect is an extremely common move in Doubles, using it is very risky. If used, however, a Pokemon with Imprison and Protect should be used to disable said move. A Choice Band can be used to give Scrafty more power at the cost of not being able to effectively utilize Fake Out. Dragon Dance can be used to make Scrafty faster and stronger, and can work with Follow Me or Rage Powder support, and it outspeeds Tornadus after one boost. Outside of that, however, it's fairly risky to set up with. Bulk Up is also a usable option to boost Scrafty's power and bulk, and works quite well with Intimidate. Moxie is a decent ability that allows Scrafty to become pretty scary after a few KOs, and is good for Trick Room teams. Low Kick can be used to do more damage to heavier opponents, but misses out on the recovery and consistency Drain Punch provides. Taunt enables Scrafty to stop Trick Room users, but is very situational otherwise. Finally, ChestoRest can be used to fully heal Scrafty once.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hitmontop is best answer to Scrafty available, taking little damage from Scrafty thanks to Intimidate, while hitting back hard with Close Combat. Landorus-T also has Intimidate, while Breloom, Hariyama, and Conkeldurr can hit Scrafty hard with their Fighting STAB. Toxicroak and Heracross resist both of Scrafty's STAB moves and hit it fairly hard in return, making them good checks. Tornadus has Flying STAB to nail Scrafty, as well as Defiant to benefit from Intimidate. Gyarados and Salamence can take on most of what Scrafty has to throw at them thanks to Intimidate, though Salamence must be wary of Ice Punch. Metagross and Togekiss have enough bulk to take whatever Scrafty has to offer and can hit back fairly hard. Sableye has Will-O-Wisp to burn Scrafty and weaken its damage output. Overall, the best way to handle Scrafty is by taking it on with something reasonably bulky.</p> ",

Scrafty's Fighting STAB also allows it to take on the most common answer to Intimidate users, Bisharp. Intimidate is a great ability, as being able to weaken opposing physical attackers is fairly valuable. Fake Out is the main move on this set, and allows Scrafty to stop one opponent from moving for the turn of its usage; the free damage is also noteworthy. Drain Punch serves as a decently powerful and reliable STAB move that also provides recovery. Crunch is secondary STAB move and provides great coverage with Drain Punch. Detect is a useful move in Doubles that can block a hit, and it's preferred over Protect as it bypasses Imprison. Ice Punch, however, allows Scrafty to land a strong blow on Garchomp, Landorus, and Thundurus.</p> <p>A Chople Berry is the preferred item here as it lets Scrafty avoid the OHKO from some Fighting-type moves, notably Hitmontop's Close Combat. A Sitrus Berry, however, can give Scrafty decent recovery outside of Drain Punch once. A Dark Gem can be useful to deliver a stronger Crunch for one turn. The utility that Chople Berry and Sitrus Berry provide, however, is much more useful. Leftovers is also a viable option, as Scrafty is quite durable and it also cancels out hail and sand damage. There are also a number of viable alternate EV spreads over the one listed. 252 HP / 72 Atk / 100 Def / 84 SpD with an Expert Belt is usable to survive Latios's Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor and Hitmontop's Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat (after Intimidate), and provides as much power as maximum Attack Scrafty against targets weak to its moves. 252 HP and 60 Special Defense EVs can also be used to live a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor from Modest Kyurem and Modest Latios. 4 Speed EVs allow Scrafty to outpace opposing Scrafty and use Fake Out against them.</p> <p>Dusclops and Cresselia are both great teammates for Scrafty, sporting good synergy while being able to set up Trick Room; they can also run Helping Hand to let Scrafty deliver stronger blows. Jellicent is also a viable teammate that synergizes well defensively with Scrafty. Abomasnow has good offensive synergy as it can handle Flying-types such as Tornadus well with its Ice STAB, while Scrafty provides Intimidate support to lessen blows from Scizor and handles Tyranitar, Heatran, and Chandelure. Other Pokemon such as Reuniclus can be useful as well, as Reuniclus can handle Fighting-types, and Scrafty can aid in its ability to set up Trick Room with Fake Out and also handles opposing Psychic-, Ghost-, and Dark-type Pokemon.</p> "

  "Cofagrigus": {
    "overview": "<p>With base 30 Speed and huge defensive stats, Cofagrigus is a bulky Trick Room setter with excellent support options such as Will-O-Wisp. Its Ghost typing gives it an immunity to Fake Out as well as Fighting-type attacks, allowing it to wall the ever-common Hitmontop. It has a very weird ability that can sometimes rob an opposing Pokemon of its ability. This all seems great, but Dusclops has a very similar movepool and much greater defenses with Eviolite. Furthermore, its mediocre offenses and very bad four-moveslot syndrome make it largely outclassed by Dusclops. Mummy is an inferior ability to Dusclops's Pressure as some of the most useful abilities in Doubles are auto-weather and Intimidate, which activate upon switching in. Most Levitate users do not use contact moves. It can, however, eliminate other great abilities like Serene Grace from Jirachi. Unlike Dusclops, Cofagrigus isn't forced to use Eviolite but instead can use Mental Herb, Sitrus Berry, and Leftovers, giving it a small niche over Dusclops.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Yet again, Cofagrigus's moveslots are quite limited, preventing it from running too many other options. Hidden Power Fighting gives Cofagrigus perfect neutral coverage, but is very weak even against Pokemon weak to it such as Tyranitar. Nasty Plot can make these moves very powerful, and can be set up before Trick Room, but Taunt is a big obstacle for this strategy and Cofagrigus must sacrifice a lot of bulk to make it as powerful as possible. Calm Mind boosts Cofagrigus's inferior Special Defense, but it will take multiple boosts to make its Special Attack worth using. Imprison can be used to prevent a foe from using Trick Room, allowing it to act as an anti-Trick Room supporter. Disable allows Cofagrigus to shut down an opponent's utility moves such as Protect and Will-O-Wisp, as well as preventing a 2HKO from Tyranitar. After You is an interesting option to allow a speedy teammate to move first even in Trick Room, and is really good for hybrid Trick Room teams. Finally, please do not use Slaking with Fury Cutter to adopt Mummy from Cofagrigus. It's really predictable and your opponent will have no qualms double targeting Slaking before it can even attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Taunt users can mess up Cofagrigus pretty badly, preventing Cofagrigus from setting up Trick Room unless it's running Mental Herb, while preventing it from using Will-O-Wisp by just using Taunt again. Sableye is a great choice as it is immune to the likes of Scrafty's Fake Out, can easily Taunt Cofagrigus twice even in Trick Room, and can burn Cofagrigus and its partners easily. Cresselia is a great anti-Trick Room Pokemon, using Trick Room simultaneously with Cofagrigus while not taking too much damage from Shadow Ball even with minimal Special Defense investment. If all else fails, just attack it repeatedly until it falls.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set is fairly straightforward, working like most other Trick Room users in Doubles. Simply use Trick Room the first chance you get, with Mental Herb preventing your opponent from stopping you with Taunt. Rage Powder support from Amoonguss is especially useful, deflecting attacks aimed at Cofagrigus. Amoonguss is then guaranteed to use Spore bar Prankster users such as Sableye and Tornadus Taunting it. Intimidate and Fake Out support from Scrafty, which can do great damage to Tyranitar by 2HKOing Chople Berry variants with Drain Punch while recovering HP, is also good.</p> <p>Once Trick Room is up, start burning your opponent's team with Will-O-Wisp and providing extra damage for your teammate with Shadow Ball. The burn from Will-O-Wisp is great for crippling Ferrothorn (which outspeeds Cofagrigus in Trick Room), Tyranitar, Scizor, Hitmontop, Garchomp, Metagross, Landorus-T, and even Kyurem-B, as well as putting a timer on Pokemon using Leftovers or recovery moves. Protect is a staple move in Doubles, preventing Cofagrigus from taking damage from spread moves such as Earthquake from the likes of Rhyperior. It also gives Cofagrigus Leftovers recovery if it chooses to run that item over the two already listed.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Cofagrigus's mediocre base 58 HP as well as giving Cofagrigus a chance to survive Tyranitar's Crunch and possibly avoid a 2HKO if you can land a burn with Will-O-Wisp, while minimizing Cofagrigus's Speed to make the best use of Trick Room. The rest of the EVs are put into Cofagrigus's good Special Defense. If Cofagrigus uses a Sitrus Berry, it is guaranteed to survive the 2HKO from a burned Tyranitar and keeps Cofagrigus alive and kicking for providing further burn support. Slow offensive Pokemon such as Conkeldurr, Rhyperior, Gastrodon, Slowking, and Ferrothorn are the best partners for Cofagrigus. Gastrodon in particular makes a fantastic check to rain teams thanks to the Special Attack boost from Storm Drain.</p> <p>Cofagrigus has some other viable options, but beware as you must get rid of Protect to fit them on a set. Rest and Chesto Berry lets Cofagrigus last longer, potentially giving it a chance to use Trick Room again later in the match if need be. Pain Split is a shaky recovery option, but does well against Pokemon with high HP such as Cresselia, which can't do much back to Cofagrigus and will fall to repeated Shadow Balls. Finally, Colbur Berry is a good option to get around Tyranitar's Crunch, really frustrating it after a burn.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Reuniclus pairs perfectly with Trick Room: it has good all-around defenses to set up Trick Room reliably, poor Speed that is perfectly designed to use Trick Room, and an impressive Special Attack stat that allows for sweeping under Trick Room seem like a match made in heaven. It even has good neutral coverage, with access to Focus Blast, which is rare among Trick Room users. However, its specialized traits do make it one-sided and predictable. It also faces competition with much bulkier Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Musharna that set up Trick Room with more consistency and permit self-damaging spread moves from teammates by virtue of their abilities. 4-moveslot syndrome also limits what Reuniclus can do in a match. However, its immunity to residual damage and high offensive presence set it apart from other Trick Roomers, and still stands out as one of its most effective users.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Reuniclus has plenty of supportive options like Helping Hand, Skill Swap, Imprison, and Gravity, but is better left off to bulkier or faster Psychic-types that have more teammate-friendly abilities such as Levitate or Telepathy; Reuniclus is better off attacking anyway, though Skill Swapping Magic Guard is still cool. Hidden Power Fire is Reuniclus's strongest move against Scizor, Escavalier, and Metagross, but is useless against anything else, especially Tyranitar. Other offensive options include Energy Ball for Gastrodon, Signal Beam for Dark-types and Psychic-types, and Thunder mainly for a strong hit on Sableye (strangely, Reuniclus does not get Thunderbolt), but Focus Blast and to an extent Shadow Ball's coverage is superior. Magic Coat reflects Spore, Taunt, and Encore directed at Reuniclus, relieving the slot for Mental Herb, but leaves Reuniclus with mono-coverage and requires prediction, unlike Mental Herb. Colbur Berry allows Reuniclus to tank a Dark-type move and set up Trick Room or retaliate with Focus Blast. After You is nifty for non-dedicated Trick Room teams, as it allows Reuniclus to help a fast teammate move before an otherwise slower opponent (with Trick Room active), provided Reuniclus gets to act first. Imprison can allow Reuniclus to stop opposing Trick Room users from neutralizing its own Trick Room and turns the tables on the slower Musharna, but faster users of Imprison + Trick Room, such as Chandelure and Uxie, will still stop it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Spore (Breloom, Amoonguss), Taunt (Thundurus-I, Terrakion, Heatran), and Encore (Whimsicott, Liepard) can stop a Reuniclus without the appropriate item from setting up, or force a switch in terms of Encore, neutering it and its teammates' offensive potential. Dark-types, such as Hydreigon, Bisharp, Darkrai, and Tyranitar, as well as Bug-types, such as Volcarona, Genesect and Escavalier, all threaten to damage Reuniclus beyond repair or KO outright, which is another alternative to preventing Trick Room. Sableye stands out as the biggest obstacle for Reuniclus. It is completely immune to its attacks, has Taunt to stop Trick Room, and can burn its physically-oriented teammates. Phazing moves such as Roar and Whirlwind from Pokemon such as Latias and Suicune can stop Reuniclus from setting up Trick Room due to the latter's lower priority, and bypass Mental Herb.</p> <p>Bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia, Musharna, Jirachi, and Latias are Reuniclus's next biggest problems, and not just because they resist its main attacks; Trick Room users that are faster than Reuniclus can reset Trick Room as or after it goes up, regaining the Speed advantage and setting Reuniclus back. While rare, Imprison + Trick Room users can stop Trick Room as long as they remain in battle, and since its main users, Musharna and Uxie, will be difficult for Reuniclus to get rid of. These bulky Psychic-types also know Light Screen, which helps in waiting out Trick Room. Offensive Psychic-types, on the other hand, such as Latios and Victini, can easily take a hit from Reuniclus without Shadow Ball and strike with ludicrously powerful moves like Draco Meteor or V-Create. Steel-types that take neutral damage from Fighting-type attacks, such as Scizor, Escavalier, Metagross, Bronzong, and Jirachi, can also stop Reuniclus, the former three hitting Reuniclus very hard and the latter two being bulky enough to wear out Trick Room; Jirachi's Follow Me can also get in Reuniclus's way. Even though Reuniclus's bulk is acceptable, it is vulnerable to powerful STAB attacks if they are boosted by Gems and/or weather, namely Life Orb Kingdra's rain boosted Hydro Pump and Kyurem-Black's Dragon Gem-boosted Dragon Claw/Outrage.</p> ",

Psychic is Reuniclus's best attack and is very strong against many targets; Psyshock is slightly weaker but targets Pokemon with weaker Defense, such as Amoonguss, Politoed and Terrakion in a sandstorm. Focus Blast nails Dark-types and Steel-types, and while it has shaky accuracy, the payoff is great. Trick Room teams may prefer Reuniclus's power as opposed to bulkier Trick Room setters such as Cresselia and Musharna while still sporting enough bulk to set it up, making it one of the few reliable Trick Room users that can actually sweep alongside the TR sweepers rather than being pure support. Its Magic Guard ability grants the Life Orb boost for free, allow it to function normally in damaging weather, and its immunity to residual damage aids its overall bulk.</p> <p>Reuniclus needs Trick Room to function at its best, hence the minimum Speed investment and Speed-lowering nature. The EV spread is used to survive Latios's Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor more than 50% of the time, which 252 HP EVs alone would fail to do, in exchange for leaving it slightly more vulnerable to an OHKO from Tyranitar (which it can still survive), which can be remedied with an Intimidate from a teammate. Reuniclus has Shadow Ball to nail Psychic-types like Cresselia, Latios, and opposing Reuniclus, but that job is better left to teammates, and Focus Blast is a move that many other Psychic-types do not have access to. If you feel it is necessary to pack more coverage with Reuniclus, it can forgo Protect, but it will be more reliant on teammates to aid its set up. While Life Orb adds to Reuniclus's potent strength, Mental Herb and Chesto Berry can be used as consistency boosters, ensuring Trick Room goes or stays up even in the face of Taunt and Encore or Spore, respectively. Lum Berry can be used over Chesto Berry if one does not want their Reuniclus paralyzed or confused, though keep in mind it actually appreciates being burned or poisoned to avoid sleep-inducing moves.</p> <p>Pokemon that can function in Trick Room make great partners, especially if they can take out bulky Psychic-types; Scrafty, Escavalier, and even Rhyperior (to handle Jirachi) are good choices, and can sweep alongside Reuniclus. Pokemon that can aid in the setting of Trick Room, such as Amoonguss's Rage Powder or Fake Out from Scrafty, Hitmontop, or Hariyama, make good partners, and provide additional support with Spore or Fighting attacks to ward off Dark-types; Scrafty gets special mention for also deterring Ghost- and Psychic-types. Fire-types can ward off Sableye and roast Steel-types instead of relying on the inaccurate Focus Blast; Chandelure can hit Psychic- and Ghost-types with STAB Shadow Ball, while Heatran resists their attacks. As Reuniclus is immune to weather damage, Trick Room teams that utilize hail or sandstorm really appreciate Reuniclus as a partner, especially because Reuniclus disposes of problematic Fighting-types.</p> "

It even boasts good mixed defenses and a very nice defensive typing, resisting many attacks most notably Dragon-, Dark-, Ghost-, Bug-, Ice-, and Psychic-type attacks, thus allowing it to take on the likes of Latios, Kyurem-B, Bisharp, Scizor, Gengar, and other Pokemon that can trouble Trick Room users. However, Escavalier is severely let down by its sparse movepool and poor coverage, and is downed by any Fire-type move; it also struggles to bypass Steel-types and Pokemon that resist its STABs. However, if you can make up for its small movepool, Escavalier can make use of what it has to skewer its foes a new one.</p> ",

Pursuit catches fleeing Latios, Latias, and Gengar looking to avoid Escavalier's attacks, but it is useless outside of these threats as even a resisted Megahorn outdamages a super effective, unboosted Pursuit. Double-Edge is stronger than Return, but while the recoil can inch Escavalier into Swarm range, it also undermines Escavalier's great bulk. Reversal hits Steel-types such as Heatran but requires Escavalier to be near dead to work and that is difficult to time correctly. Rain Dance is an option to weaken Fire-type attacks and for unexpected weather changing, but it doesn't really benefit Escavalier itself. Overcoat is an option to block Hail damage, permitting Escavalier's use on Hail teams, but it still competes with the more offensively-minded Swarm, which suits Escavalier's playstyle. Steel Gem can result in strong Iron Heads that match Megahorn's power to surprise Bug-resistant foes, but the extreme power boost to Megahorn is what gives Escavalier its KOing power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to Escavalier's limited coverage, plenty of Pokemon can stand in its way. Fire-types such as Heatran, Volcarona, and Chandelure all roast it easily and their access to Heat Wave adds salt into the wound. Intimidate users such as Landorus-T, Hitmontop, and Gyarados tend to resist Megahorn and can tank Escavalier's hits well. Pokemon that resist Megahorn, are not weak to Iron Head, and can strike back at least neutrally fare well against Escavalier; Pokemon such as Genesect, Excadrill, Thundurus, Gyarados, Hitmontop, and Togekiss can take on Escavalier one-on-one. Surprise Fire-type attacks can also catch Escavalier off guard, though the move must at least have moderate power and not be used in rain. Escavalier becomes easy prey outside of Trick Room since it will then be susceptible to multiple beatings per turn, so if you can outlast Trick Room, you should be able to beat it down.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Escavalier's STAB Megahorn is its strongest move; it hits Cresselia really hard and also OHKOes Latios, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon with ease and hurts a lot of neutral targets. Iron Head provides an alternate, more reliable STAB move that can allow Escavalier to flinch opponents under Trick Room and hit Kyurem hard. Iron Head is also Escavalier's most effective attack against Ghost-, Flying- and Fighting-type Pokemon that resist Megahorn. Substitute can guard Escavalier from strong attacks and status and inch it into Swarm range, potentially letting it save up for a monstrously strong Swarm and Bug Gem-boosted Megahorn. Return is Escavalier's best attack against Pokemon that resist its dual STABs, such as Thundurus, Volcarona, and Gyarados, in case Escavalier gets into a bind with them, but it only 2HKOes most of them at best, limiting its usefulness. Quick Guard can be used to guard Escavalier's teammate from Fake Out while it sets up Trick Room, but it is only useful for that, and most Fake Out users have good matchups against Escavalier anyway.</p> <p>Escavalier really needs Trick Room to function at its best, hence its spread of absolute minimum Speed. Bug Gem-boosted Megahorn has over a 65% chance to OHKO even the most physically defensive of Cresselia, and the power boost can be restored or even stacked with Swarm. On the other hand, only 132 Attack EVs are needed for the same Megahorn to KO standard Cresselia, so if you are content with that, the other Attack EVs can be moved into Special Defense to take Draco Meteors and rain-boosted attacks better, or into Defense if Scizor is a greater issue. Occa Berry allows Escavalier to survive surprise Fire-type attacks such as Hidden Power Fire from Latios and Tyranitar's Fire Blast, but Escavalier still fares poorly against Fire-types due to their resistances, so they are best left for teammates to deal with.</p> <p>X-Scissor is a more accurate alternative to Megahorn, but it is much weaker; the role of an accurate STAB is already fulfilled by Iron Head regardless. Pokemon that can set up Trick Room, such as Reuniclus, Chandelure, Musharna, and Cresselia, make natural partners, as Escavalier can sweep and handle most Pokemon that threaten or wall Trick Room-setters. Escavalier also greatly appreciates Pokemon that can deal with Fire-types, Steel-types, and troublesome dual-typed Pokemon that resist its STABs. Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types can KO Fire-types and take advantage of Escavalier's 4x resistance to Grass-type attacks; Pokemon such as Politoed, Tyranitar, Rhyperior, Rotom-W, Gastrodon, Jellicent, and Slowbro and Slowking fit this bill, the former two and latter three receiving special mention due to weather control and Trick Room access, respectively. Rock-type teammates are favorable since they can crush bulky Flying-types. Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Hitmontop are the best partners to deal with Steel-types that Escavalier cannot pierce through; they also appreciate Escavalier's ability to scare Cresselia silly.</p> "

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>The main and only reason to use Amoonguss in Doubles is because it is an incredibly bulky Rage Powder user. That's more than enough, though; being able to redirect every single-target attack in the game towards an entirely expendable team member is very useful when using moves or Pokemon that require help setting up, such as Trick Room or Manaphy. Of the four viable Rage Powder or Follow Me users in the tier, Amoonguss only has direct competition from Jirachi as a damage sponge that does little save spam Rage Powder, as Volcarona and Togekiss tend to mostly use offensive pressure and have Follow Me more as a card in their back pockets to redirect troublesome attacks occasionally. Compared to Jirachi, Amoonguss has more reliable healing, a great move in Spore, and arguably better bulk due to its incredibly useful Water- and Fighting-type resistances, which help it take on rain teams. However, Regenerator is not as good as it might seem; it's tempting to keep Amoonguss on life support forever, as it is certainly capable of surviving for that long, but Amoonguss is entirely useless as a last Pokemon. The biggest point in its favor, though, is that Amoonguss is usually the best choice for teams that use Rage Powder to help set up Trick Room; most of Jirachi's support movepool is speed control, which is entirely useless under Trick Room, and Amoonguss has an incredibly fast Spore once it's helped set up. Furthermore, Amoonguss can be quite useful in beating Trick Room, as it can Spore the opposing team's setter for an almost guaranteed stop to the move.</p> <p>Of course, Amoonguss isn't easily better than Jirachi, either. Amoonguss's movepool is nearly empty, while Jirachi's is deep. Low Speed might be a boon under Trick Room, but outside of it, being outsped by every common Fake Out is a pain that Jirachi doesn't have to deal with. Jirachi's Dragon-type resistance (and many other resistances) also help to put it above Amoonguss, though Amoonguss still has the raw bulk not to be KOed by most neutral moves. Perhaps most importantly, Amoonguss lacks any offensive presence, often failing to break Substitutes of Pokemon that don't even resist Giga Drain. Still, Amoonguss's unique resistances and access to Spore make it an old standby for any team in need of a sponge.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Amoonguss without Rage Powder and Spore should never be considered. Protect and Giga Drain serve niche, but equally important, roles in making sure the set can fulfill its function: Protect so it is not Fake Out weak and Giga Drain so it is not Taunt bait and absolutely useless once it has used Spore (not to mention entirely necessary in the case of Amoonguss being your last Pokemon). As such, Amoonguss's moveslot customization options are extremely limited, but they do exist. Substitute over Protect trades the ability to block Fake Outs on turn one with the great utility of being able to redirect non-damaging effects at no cost, but it is hard to set up. That said, it is probably Amoonguss's best alternative move, as it can be extremely useful. Giga Drain can be replaced with Sludge Bomb or Grass Knot for more situational power but less overall utility. It can also be scrapped for Clear Smog, but Volcarona and Bisharp, two of the most common boosting Pokemon in Doubles, do not fear it. Stun Spore and Toxic appear to be good options for Amoonguss as they are more crippling than Giga Drain in almost all cases, but they leave it completely open to Taunt and are thus inadvisable. Synthesis is a bad idea in most cases because although it lets Amoonguss use Rage Powder more times over the course of the match, Amoonguss has to stop using Rage Powder in order to use Synthesis, and the turn wasted is rarely worth it. Hidden Power Ice can be used on teams that need a check to Flying- and Dragon-types such as Thundurus, Salamence, and Shaymin-S, but is only two-thirds as strong as Giga Drain against neutral targets and doesn't have any healing property. The only other move that Amoonguss should ever consider is After You, as it allows Trick Room teams running a fast tech to use that Pokemon while Trick Room is up without any ill effects. Lastly, Amoonguss can run Lum Berry, which is extremely useful for Spore Breloom and Amoonguss leads but absolutely pointless otherwise, or Black Sludge, which is better than Sitrus Berry if Amoonguss survives more than four turns, but should only be considered alongside Substitute, as otherwise Amoonguss should not be on the field that long.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best way to counter Amoonguss is not to chip away at it--as long as it has redirected attacks, it has done its job. The best way to counter Amoonguss is to keep it from using Rage Powder and Spore at all. As such, Taunt is absolutely invaluable, as is Fake Out, as long as the Amoonguss user is not prepared for those moves. Though spread moves such as Heatran's Heat Wave and Abomasnow's Blizzard don't actually stop Rage Powder, they circumvent it while simultaneously dealing a massive chunk of damage to Amoonguss and are thus some of your best options. If you can OHKO Amoonguss (especially with a fast Pokemon, whose partner can then proceed to attack Amoonguss's partner), it's a great way to beat it. Note that this basically will require a Gem-boosted STAB move, such as Tornadus's Acrobatics or Chandelure's Heat Wave. Speaking of Chandelure, it is the number one way to beat Amoonguss which are on Trick Room teams, as it can Imprison Trick Room instead of having to Taunt to stop it and can OHKO Amoonguss with Heat Wave while simultaneously attacking its partner. Though they can't ignore Rage Powder, bulky or Grass-resisting Pokemon with Substitute have nothing at all to fear from Amoonguss, which cannot break their Substitutes or Spore them when they are behind one. Lastly, Spore Breloom functions as a pseudo-Taunt user, being able to shut down Amoonguss for a couple of turns, but is very frail. If your team carries none of the above, the best way to beat Amoonguss is simply to beat it down as quickly as possible and remember not to target its partner with a single-target move that Amoonguss resists.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Rage Powder",
        "description": "<p>Rage Powder is the main draw of this set; to put it simply, Amoonguss should not be used if your team doesn't need Rage Powder. Rage Powder simply has so many neat applications, such as helping a frail sweeper survive another turn or letting a Trick Room user set up the move without fear of Taunt. When it doesn't need to use Rage Powder though, Amoonguss loves having Spore, a move that allows it to cripple virtually any Pokemon, though only one at a time. Amoonguss's other two moves are useful only in much more niche situations. Protect should mostly be used in the case of an obvious Fake Out (as it can outspeed Amoonguss's Rage Powder), in which case Amoonguss and its partner both protecting can save your strategy from disaster. It can also be used instead of Rage Powder if Amoonguss is certainly going to be double-targeted, but predicting this is incredibly risky and thus rarely advised. Giga Drain seems good at first, dealing damage and healing, but it's so weak that it can't break the Substitute of bulkier Pokemon which are neutral to it, such as Garchomp. As such, it's really only good when Amoonguss is Taunted or can use it to secure a KO. The most important thing to remember when using Amoonguss is not to be fooled into thinking that all four of its moves are equally useful: Giga Drain and especially Protect will mostly only find themselves as options in specific situations, so after activating Sleep Clause, Amoonguss is usually better off just using Rage Powder until it is KOed.</p> <p>Amoonguss's Speed is absolutely minimized because it is used most of the time under Trick Room, in which case it usually becomes the fastest Pokemon on the field and can Spore almost anything. Meanwhile, its given EV spread allows it to tank almost every hit in the game; 64 Defense EVs let it survive a non-item-boosted Zen Headbutt from Metagross, and putting the rest in Special Defense is just enough to avoid the KO from a full health non-item-boosted Eruption from Heatran. When Sitrus Berry is used in conjunction with these EVs, Amoonguss can take yet another 25% of its max HP in punishment, guaranteeing that it almost always lives to the second turn, though it still must be wary of being 2HKOed if the opponent leads with two strong attackers. However, if Thundurus is a major threat to your team, Amoonguss can use Mental Herb to redirect its attacks (all of which Amoonguss shrugs off) without worrying about being shut down by Taunt. Effect Spore's 30% status effect is great when it activates, but it is less reliable than Regenerator and doesn't boost Amoonguss's greatest selling point: longevity. Amoonguss's Speed tier is also almost fully customizable if you are not running it on a Trick Room team, as it has another junk stat in Attack and 31 IVs to work with. For example, 27 Speed IV Calm Amoonguss can outspeed paralyzed Choice Scarf Tyranitar outside of Trick Room, while still outpacing minimized base 50 Speed Pokemon in Trick Room.</p> <p>When it comes to picking good partners for Amoonguss, the two most important things to consider are as follows: 1) Does this Pokemon appreciate Rage Powder support more than any other type of support? For example, if it needs a little help dealing damage, Helping Hand users would be better, or if it is kind of slow, but not Trick Room slow, then paralysis or Tailwind support is optimal. 2) Is this Pokemon irreparably weak to common spread moves? If it is, then Amoonguss cannot help, as Rage Powder does not redirect Earthquake, Surf, Heat Wave, etc. What this paring process generally leaves is Pokemon that function well either after a turn of setup or under Trick Room. For example, Tail Glow Manaphy appreciates Amoonguss's redirecting of powerful Electric, Grass, and Dragon attacks and can spam powerful Surfs while doing minimal damage to Amoonguss. Another well-known teammate is Water Spout Jellicent, as Amoonguss can redirect Taunts that would stop Jellicent from using Trick Room, while simultaneously redirecting all single-target moves so Water Spout stays at full power. Many such team options are possible with Amoonguss--though it is important to make sure that Amoonguss is not on your team only to help out one other Pokemon.</p> "

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<p>Blessed with one of the best abilities for a physical attacker in the Doubles metagame, Bisharp is a force to be reckoned with. Defiant and Steel typing allow Bisharp to not only brush off Intimidate and Icy Wind but also grab an Attack boost from them instead. It also has access to and STAB on Sucker Punch, allowing it to take advantage of its ability against fast teams. Bisharp also does extremely well in and against Trick Room, as priority moves first both in and out of Trick Room. Rounding off the list of merits, Bisharp's typing allows it to keep common Psychic- and Dragon-types, such as Cresselia and Latios, in check.</p> <p>That said, Bisharp is unfortunately weak to common spread moves; Heat Wave and Earthquake hit it super effectively, and it does not exactly enjoy taking rain-boosted Surfs either. In addition to this, it also has a crippling weakness to Fighting-type moves, and being that Fighting-types resist Sucker Punch, it has a very hard time dealing with said Pokemon. In addition to these demerits, Bisharp is also very one-dimensional and is therefore predictable. Even with all these weaknesses, Bisharp is an amazing addition to teams that otherwise have problems with Intimidate and Icy Wind as its presence alone forces your opponent to think twice before using them.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bisharp has a ton of other options to try out, but many of them are very situational. Notable items to use include Life Orb, Lum Berry, Focus Sash, and Choice Band. Life Orb provides a more consistent boost, but Bisharp's bulk is ruined by the residual damage. Lum Berry allows Bisharp to avoid burn and paralysis once, but the power boost from Dark Gem is preferred. Focus Sash is great for taking threatening Fighting-type attacks, and it allows Bisharp to invest fully into Speed, but with no boost in power, Bisharp misses a lot of KOs if not boosted by Defiant. Focus Sash also helps Bisharp set up Swords Dance if you want to use that. Choice Band is definitely an item best suited for Trick Room, as outside of it, Bisharp will be open to many more Fighting-type attacks and therefore likes the ability to use Protect effectively much more.</p> <p>With a fantastic movepool at its disposal, Bisharp naturally has many other moves to try out as well. Thunder Wave is an option if your team is focused on spreading paralysis, and Magnet Rise can be used to dodge obvious Earthquakes, but Bisharp is best suited for an offensive role, and the two moves limit its coverage. Bisharp finds the best coverage alongside its STABs in Fighting-types moves, a few of which it learns besides Low Kick. Low Sweep can be used for speed control, but Low Kick hits the majority of targets for much more damage. Brick Break is the second coverage option and is a good choice for teams that have trouble with dual screens. Pursuit is another STAB option, especially useful for fleeing Psychic-types, such as Latios. Finally, Stone Edge is an option for hitting Flying-types, such as Tornadus and Zapdos, for more damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best way to keep Bisharp in check is to play around it carefully; refrain from use Icy Wind and switching in an Intimidate Pokemon while Bisharp is on the field. Once you begin to play around Bisharp like this, it is not very hard to counter. The presence of faster Fighting-types, such as Terrakion, Heracross, and Breloom, put Bisharp in a living hell, as they can shrug off Sucker Punch and OHKO with their STAB moves. Most Steel-types can wall Bisharp, especially if it doesn't carry Low Kick. Notable examples include Scizor, Heatran, Escavalier, and Excadrill. Fast Dark-types with coverage moves, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Hydreigon with Low Kick and Fire Blast, respectively, can put a stop to Bisharp as well, as said Pokemon can shrug off a Sucker Punch and OHKO back. Bar Jellicent, bulky Water-types, such as Politoed and Gastrodon are shaky checks, as they can easily take unboosted hits, but some miss the OHKO on Bisharp. Finally, there is Sableye which can easily play around Bisharp's Sucker Punch, and use priority Will-O-Wisp to limit its attacking capabilities.</p> <p>In addition to typing, there are also a couple of moves that counter Bisharp's main move, Sucker Punch. Substitute dodges Sucker Punch and allows its user to pose as a threat at the same time; this move is especially effective if the Substitute user is resistant to Bisharp's coverage moves. Will-O-Wisp also avoids Sucker Punch, but instead of making its user more threatening, the move makes Bisharp less threatening. Finally, Follow Me and Rage Powder are also moves that completely shut down Sucker Punch, as both redirect it and dodge it at the same time.</p> ",

        "name": "Defiant",
        "description": "<p>This set aims to to prevent opponents from freely spamming Intimidate and Icy Wind, becoming a huge threat if they make a mistake. Its combination of the ability Defiant and access to STAB Sucker Punch allows it to fill this role consistently and effectively. Sucker Punch is the main move of this set and should be, with the possible exception of Protect, the move you are using the most. In the second spot, Iron Head is the preferred option, as it is much more consistently powerful than Low Kick due to STAB, but if you want to use Night Slash in the third slot, Low Kick provides better coverage. In the third spot, Low Kick hits problematic Steel-types that Sucker Punch and Iron Head cannot, but Night Slash is great for preventing Trick Room from being set, as it hits the majority of setters super effectively. In the final slot, Protect is obligatory; it is a massive staple on offensive Pokemon in Doubles, especially those weak to common types such as Fighting, Ground, and Fire.</p> <p>Considering that Bisharp will be using Sucker Punch and Protect most of the time, Attack and HP investment is usually preferred over Speed investment, as both of these moves have priority. With 252 HP EVs, Bisharp is surprisingly bulky and can even take super effective hits such as Jolly Landorus-T's Earthquake and Modest Zapdos's Heat Wave. One could opt to run an alternative spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe alongside Steel Gem, as this enables Bisharp to outspeed standard Hitmontop and OHKO with +1 Steel Gem-boosted Iron Head, but the spread is situational. If using Bisharp on a Trick Room team, you should use a Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs, as this makes the most out of Trick Room. When it comes to picking an item, Dark Gem is usually preferred, gaining important OHKOs on Pokemon such as Tornadus and Reuniclus, but Steel Gem is very useful to get that OHKO on Hitmontop. Swords Dance is also a possibility, as Bisharp forces the opponent to play carefully, which helps it find opportunities to set up.</p> <p>When it comes to teammates, Bisharp enjoys the presence of Pokemon that can deal with Steel-types. Fire-types can roast said Steel-types; Volcarona is a notable partner, as it can also redirect Fighting-type attacks with Rage Powder. Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Hitmontop can also punch holes in Steel-types, allowing Bisharp to have an easier time breaking through the opposition. Any Pokemon susceptible to Intimidate or Icy Wind loves having Bisharp by its side, as the opponent will have to think twice about spamming said tactics. Notable Pokemon that appreciate this support are Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Tyranitar. Pokemon that carry Taunt such as Thundurus and Gyarados also support Bisharp well; Taunt support makes Sucker Punch much more reliable, as it will only fail if a Taunted Pokemon switches out or uses a faster priority move.</p> "

While Hydreigon might appear to be outclassed by other special attacking Dragon-types such as Latios and Salamence, it has several perks to differentiate itself. Hydreigon has an excellent movepool with moves such as Fire Blast, Earth Power, and Dark Pulse, and it lacks a weakness to both Rock Slide and Sucker Punch, which plague the other two Dragon-types. What truly differentiates Hydreigon from its brethren is its Dark typing, allowing it to check common Pokemon such as Cresselia and Chandelure. Hydreigon is not without its flaws, however. While its typing does give it useful resistances, it also gives it crippling weaknesses to the common Fighting-, Ice-, and Dragon-type moves. Hydreigon also faces a large amount of competition from other special attacking Dragon-types, as its awkward base 98 Speed leaves it outsped by Salamence and Latios, as well as Genesect. Despite these setbacks, Hydreigon's versatility and power make it a great Pokemon overall.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydreigon has plenty of other options to choose from thanks to its amazing movepool. Taunt is a very useful move that Hydreigon has access to, allowing it to shut down defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Cresselia. A Dark Gem can also be used to boost the power of Dark Pulse, but Hydreigon's Dark STAB not only has worse coverage than its Dragon STAB, but it also has less Base Power. Surf is an option if Hydreigon is being used on a rain team, but other Dragon-types, such as Kingdra and Latios, make better users of the move. A Choice Scarf or Choice Specs can be used to increase Hydreigon's power or Speed, respectively, but these items ruin Hydreigon's main draw over other Dragon-types: its amazing coverage. U-Turn can be used in conjunction with Tailwind to bring in a more suitable Tailwind sweeper. Thunder Wave is another option Hydreigon can use, as it cripples many faster threats, such as Shaymin-S and Thundurus. Finally, Hydreigon can use Psych Up to copy the opponent's stat changes, which would remove the stat drops from Draco Meteor and Icy Wind.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hydreigon's incredible coverage and power make it very difficult to counter. Chansey and Blissey can take whatever Hydreigon throws at it and can slowly wear it down with Seismic Toss. Occa Berry Metagross paired with Tyranitar is a very good check, as the Occa Berry allows it to take one Fire Blast, and the combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch will KO Hydreigon after two turns of sandstorm damage. Apart from Earth Power and Focus Blast, Heatran can take whatever Hydreigon throws at it and can 2HKO Hydreigon with Dragon Pulse. Jirachi can paralyze Hydreigon and wear it down with multiple Iron Heads, but it must watch out for Fire Blast. Apart from Focus Blast, Tyranitar isn't fazed by any of Hydreigon's attacks can and 2HKO it with Low Kick.</p> <p>While Hydreigon is very difficult to counter, its common weaknesses make it rather easy to check. Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Mamoswine can all revenge kill Hydreigon with a super effective priority move, while Pokemon such as Latios, Terrakion, Genesect, Volcarona, and Salamence can all outspeed and OHKO Hydreigon with a super effective STAB move. Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Cloyster, and Abomasnow can also revenge kill Hydreigon. However, many of the aforementioned Pokemon become risky checks if Hydreigon has a Tailwind boost.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Hydreigon's amazing offensive typing and Special Attack, it can function as an amazing special attacker. Draco Meteor is Hydreigon's main STAB; with a Dragon Gem boost, it deals a significant amount of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. However, Dragon Pulse is an option if you prefer consistency, but its lower Base Power makes it an inferior option overall. Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's secondary STAB move and deals a large amount of damage to common Trick Room users such as Reuniclus, Cresselia, and Musharna. Fire Blast gets amazing coverage with Hydreigon's Dragon STAB, hitting Steel-types such as Jirachi and Metagross for a great amount of damage. Earth Power can be used over Fire Blast to hit Heatran and Tyranitar for super effective damage while still hitting Steel-types hard. If none of these coverage moves interest you, then Tailwind can be used to increase Hydreigon's Speed to amazing levels and allow it to outspeed and OHKO faster threats such as Latios, Salamence, and Garchomp. Protect is the best option in the last slot, as it allows Hydreigon to avoid damage from the foe's attacks.</p> <p>If you are using Tailwind, then an EV spread of 80 HP / 176 Spe / 252 SpA with a Modest nature is recommended to outpace Adamant Excadrill in the sand. A Modest nature is the preferred nature if you are using a Dragon Gem, as many bulky walls that have EVs to survive Timid Latios's Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor will be overwhelmed by Modest Hydreigon's Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor. While the Dragon Gem does allow Hydreigon to break through bulky special walls, the Life Orb is the preferred item to boost the power of Hydreigon's coverage moves, giving it the power to 2HKO Cresselia with Dark Pulse and OHKO Metagross with Fire Blast. A Chople Berry can be used to survive relatively powerful Fighting-type attacks such as Terrakion's Close Combat, but the extra power from the Life Orb or Dragon Gem is usually more useful. Flamethrower or Heat Wave can be used for a more accurate alternate to Fire Blast, with the latter hitting both Pokemon on the foe's side of the field. However, the extra power that Fire Blast provides is much more useful. Focus Blast can be used to OHKO Tyranitar and Bisharp while still hitting Steel-types super effectually, but its low accuracy is a major drawback. Pokemon that can cover up Hydreigon's weaknesses are great partners. Jirachi is an amazing partner, as it can redirect the powerful Dragon- and Ice-type moves aimed at Hydreigon with Follow Me while also providing Thunder Wave support to mitigate Hydreigon's average Speed. Excadrill is a great offensive partner, as it can destroy nearly every relevant Steel-type with Earthquake, allowing Hydreigon to use Draco Meteor without risk late-game.</p> "

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>Terrakion is a very straightforward Pokemon in both concept and practice. While other Fighting-types might use supportive moves such as Fake Out or rely on other Pokemon to set up field conditions, Terrakion gets straight to the point, outspeeding the majority of the unboosted metagame and often KOing or dealing massive damage with its incredibly useful STAB moves. This straightforward approach is also one of Terrakion's weaknesses, however. The Doubles metagame is riddled with Intimidate users, Cresselia (which basically walls and 2HKOes it), and weather users capable of outspeeding Terrakion, and it can't do much back without getting KOed. However, Terrakion is still a high-priority target that threatens many teams, and with a little speed control, Terrakion can easily dominate games.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Terrakion doesn't have the largest movepool, but it still has some interesting options that could easily fit on the physical attacking set. Quick Attack is rather odd, but it allows Terrakion to pick off weakened opponents such as bulky Thundurus or 252 HP Kyurem-Black that might survive Terrakion's onslaughts and also picks at the opponent before an expected demise at the hands of a priority move or a faster Pokemon. Helping Hand could be used in a similar vein; its best use would probably be powering up a Psychic-type enough to OHKO a threatening Fighting-type or making Draco Meteor even more difficult to wall. On the subject of supportive moves, Safeguard can easily shut down Pokemon that are keen on spreading status, but it isn't useful against Breloom and Amoonguss, and it requires a turn of setup against Thundurus and Sableye due to Prankster. Additionally, Safeguard paired with a Lum Berry can be combined with Swagger to boost Terrakion's Attack to sky-high levels or simply negate an Attack drop from Intimidate.</p> <p>Swords Dance and Rock Polish are two other moves that can raise Terrakion's stats, but Rock Polish can be redundant if you run any sort of speed control. Swords Dance is a very interesting filler move that can be used on predicted double Protects to great effect, but it requires a great deal of prediction to pull off. Besides the aforementioned Lum Berry, there aren't many other items Terrakion could take advantage of aside from a Choice Band and Chesto Berry. Choice Band's usefulness should be obvious, but an appropriate Gem is usually enough to score KOs. Chesto Berry probably isn't as obvious, but it can prove useful to cure Terrakion of paralysis and burns when paired with Rest prevention is probably the best medicine in this case, though. Finally, Sacred Sword negates stat changes and doesn't cause any of your own, but it's rather weak and probably better suited to VGC environments where evasion moves are not banned.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Landorus-T and Cresselia are Terrakion's biggest roadblocks. Both can soften its attacks and 2HKO or OHKO Terrakion with their STAB moves while Terrakion can't do much to stop them. In fact, Intimidate in general can handily check Terrakion, but some Intimidate users won't like taking Stone Edges. Common priority users such as Conkeldurr, Breloom, and Scizor can also easily check Terrakion, provided it doesn't hide behind Quick Guard. Amoonguss takes a pittance from Terrakion's STAB moves and redirects them with Rage Powder, can put Terrakion to sleep, and can take chunks out of it's health with Giga Drain. Prankster users, such as Sableye and Thundurus, can also cripple it with priority moves, though again, Thundurus won't like taking a STAB Rock-type move. Faster Pokemon with super effective moves also make quick work of Terrakion, the most notable examples being Latios, Deoxys-A, Shaymin-S, Kingdra, and Excadrill, with the latter two being able to outspeed even the Choice Scarf set in their appropriate weather.</p> <p>Trick Room, as well as speed control in general, is a major threat to Terrakion, as basically everything it previously outsped can now outspeed Terrakion and KO it, depending on how many times its defenses have dropped due to Close Combat. Jellicent, Slowking, and Gallade are Trick Room setters that can take advantage of their own Trick Room, with the former two having spread moves that hit Terrakion super effectively and the latter having access to Feint to ensure a KO. Cresselia can simply utilize Icy Wind and throw a Psyshock Terrakion's way to KO it. It also sets up Trick Room with ease, which often results in a quick demise for Terrakion.</p> ",

        "name": "Sub + 2 Attacks",
        "description": "<p>The general idea of this set is to use Substitute to insulate Terrakion from its checks and to block status and Intimidate. Substitute also helps Terrakion circumvent Close Combat's defense drops, which is always appreciated. Terrakion's STAB moves comprise the set's coverage, which is almost unresisted. A Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat is Terrakion's weapon of choice, providing it with a power boost equal to that of a Choice Band, allowing Terrakion to OHKO threats such as Kyurem-B, Hitmontop (without Intimidate), Kingdra, and other similarly bulky Pokemon. Rock Gem is also an option, as it guarantees an OHKO on 252 HP Thundurus with Rock Slide as well as having a very good chance of OHKOing Latios with Stone Edge. Protect is in the last slot as a staple Doubles move, and it is especially useful against opponents that try to double target Terrakion's Substitute in hopes of reaching the chewy center.</p> <p>Gems are the main items you should consider for this set, as items such as Life Orb and Focus Sash would prove redundant or harmful with Substitute. Expert Belt is another item you could try if you dislike Gems, as it provides Terrakion with nice boosts against its common targets, but it's probably not going to score any impressive OHKOs, especially with Rock Slide. The 4 EVs in Defense instead of HP make Terrakion's HP odd, which allows it to make four Substitutes, provided it doesn't take any damage.</p> <p>Substitute Terrakion relies a bit more on Follow Me and Fake Out support than speed control. Mew, Jirachi, and Amoonguss, as usual, provide just that, as well as offensive support in taking care of Terrakion's checks with their coverage and resistances. Sableye provides Fake Out support as well as an incredibly useful priority Will-O-Wisp to threaten physical Fighting-types and Feint to ensure a knockout on Protecting Tyranitar and other such Pokemon. Cresselia, specifically offensive Cresselia, can provide Terrakion with important speed control and chip damage, as well as help Terrakion with Fighting-types and Landorus-T. A surprise Hidden Power Fire from Cresselia also goes a long way in dealing with the ever-threatening Scizor, but you have to be careful with using this method until you're sure Scizor isn't holding an Occa Berry.</p> "

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This is about as straightforward as Terrakion can get without losing the ability to change its moves. Close Combat is a staple on any Terrakion, as it OHKOes key Pokemon such as Kyurem and Chople Berry Tyranitar, even without Life Orb. Focus Sash is used, as it allows Terrakion to take a hit without having to worry about how many times it can use Close Combat before it's OHKOed by a slight breeze. Life Orb, in a sense, does the exact opposite, powering up Close Combat enough to turn some 2HKOs into OHKOs while sapping Terrakion of any semblance of bulk. Rock Slide is, by comparison, weaker but deals healthy spread damage to anything weak to or neutral against it, resulting in more gross damage. Stone Edge doesn't have the nice spread coverage or accuracy, but it can OHKO bulky Thundurus and isn't bothered by Wide Guard, allowing Terrakion to check Volcarona more easily.</p> <p>The third slot is mainly filler. X-Scissor does nice damage to Cresselia and other Psychic-types, 2HKOing said Cresselia with only one turn of Helping Hand support (the first attack brings it just below Sitrus range and the second attack KOes) or a few turns of Sandstorm damage, while Cresselia can only 2HKO in return. Quick Guard not only protects Terrakion from Bullet Punch and Mach Punch, but it also stops slower Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Liepard from using Fake Out on Terrakion or its partner. An important detail to note about Quick Guard is that it does not protect against Prankster-induced priority, such as Thundurus's Thunder Wave. Taunt is rather useful to stop Trick Room, but you have to be careful about Taunting some supporters such as Cresselia and Thundurus, as they can both easily cripple or 2HKO Terrakion regardless of Taunt. Protect is a staple on this set to buy time for Speed changes to take effect or to nab another turn for Terrakion's partner to take out whatever is threatening Terrakion at the moment.</p> <p>Terrakion doesn't ask for much support outside of the already essential speed control. Cresselia and Mew provide offensive support, tackling tough cats such as Hitmontop, Scizor, and Landorus-T, as well as potentially possessing the incredibly useful Helping Hand. While Hitmontop and Terrakion share the same typing, it can still support Terrakion with Wide Guard and Helping Hand, which can sometimes be all Terrakion needs to tango with rain and sand teams. Swampert also has Wide Guard, but its main attraction is the fact that it can use Ice Beam or Ice Punch to OHKO Landorus-T or leave it vulnerable to a Rock Slide. As a bonus, Swampert can offer Icy Wind support and generally deal damage with its decent base Attack and good STAB coverage.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>A charging bull makes for a frightening opponent. By extension, a bull charging at speeds you wouldn't expect it to makes for a very frightening opponent. To many, this is exactly what a Choice Scarf Terrakion is, with its STAB moves capable of OHKOing its checks that rely on being faster, and the fact that it can run Adamant without worrying about Speed only bolsters its destructive power. However, like the bull that only runs in a straight line, Terrakion can become rather clunky when it's locked into the wrong move, so as always, it's wise to utilize prediction. Earthquake and X-Scissor are mostly filler when compared to the usefulness of Terrakion's STAB moves, but they still offer their perks. X-Scissor hits Cresselia, Latios, and Tyranitar for super effective damage, which is very useful to ease prediction in some cases, while Earthquake is a relatively safe option to hit Heatran super effectively and Fighting-types neutrally.</p> <p>If you're feeling adventurous, you could use both Rock Slide and Stone Edge at the same time at the expense of Earthquake. Both moves can have different applications at times, with Rock Slide being a safe early-game option while Stone Edge is more suited to mid- or late-game where you might need more immediate power. To further compare the two, Rock Slide has the Base Power of 55 to one Pokemon, but it can deal damage to two Pokemon at once and has a good chance to flinch, while Stone Edge's Base Power is a whopping 100, but it only hit one Pokemon and has worse accuracy. The EVs ensure that Terrakion outspeeds max Speed Deoxys-A and can survive attacks such as Adamant Life Orb Breloom's Mach Punch and Landorus-T's Earthquake, while the remaining EVs are dumped into Attack for more power.</p> <p>Terrakion doesn't need much support in general outside of more offensive Follow Me, chip damage and, of course, Helping Hand to guarantee OHKOs. Volcarona can easily dispatch Breloom with Heat Wave, redirect Fake Out, can burn the offender with Flame Body, and can go the hyper offensive route with Terrakion that can easily bulldoze through unprepared teams. Liepard isn't all that powerful or bulky, but it possesses Fake Out as well as a Prankster-boosted Encore to lock Pokemon into undesirable moves such as Trick Room or Protect; in addition, it has rather interesting options in Swagger and Taunt to prevent setup and possibly create free turns for Terrakion. Liepard can also run Sucker Punch to utilize Justified and pick off Pokemon weakened by Terrakion, but you have to be careful about damaging your own Terrakion to the point where it can no longer take advantage of its defensive EVs. Cresselia's offensive set once again comes into play, but defensive sets with Helping Hand might be more suited to helping Terrakion run wild. Sunny Day Cresselia also does a nice job of supporting Terrakion, as it basically neuters rain long enough enough for Terrakion to maim many Pokemon commonly found on rain teams such as Kingdra and Thundurus-T. Outside of this, Terrakion appreciates speed control to manage the opponent's speed control that's working against it.</p> "

  "Tornadus": {
    "overview": "<p>Tornadus is often overlooked in the Doubles metagame, even though it is one of the best physical attackers in the tier, courtesy of Defiant. Its other ability, Prankster, is also effective, allowing it to use support options such as Tailwind with priority. This is further backed by the fact it is one of only a few Flying-types with access to Flying-type STAB outside of Hidden Power in Acrobatics, which along with Defiant, allows it to rip through common Fighting-types such as Hitmontop. Additionally, Tornadus has good offensive stats, and its base 111 Speed allows it to outspeed and OHKO Latios, the fastest Dragon-type in the Doubles metagame.</p> <p>While its strengths may make it seem like a true terror to face on the battlefield, it has weaknesses to three common attacking types, Electric, Ice, and Rock, and it is further crippled by mediocre 79/70/80 defenses. This leaves Tornadus completely open to common spread moves, such as Blizzard and Rock Slide, and common threats such as Thundurus. Fortunately, the raw power of Acrobatics and the pressure Defiant can apply to the opponent more than makes up for whatever flaws Tornadus may have.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tornadus has a variety of options. Icy Wind can be used to slow the opposition down. Unfortunately, Tailwind provides more Speed control, and there is little need for both in most cases. Air Slash, Heat Wave, and Grass Knot are all viable special attacking options, though in general, Tornadus's role is one of a physical attacker. Foul Play could see use on a bulkier set, dealing heavy damage to opposing attackers, but a bulky support set is outclassed by Thundurus in most cases. Role Play and Swagger are two great options for the Prankster set; Role Play can copy Drizzle, Sand Stream, or another ability off of a partner, resetting weather and helping your team in a weather war, but it can only be used once before Tornadus has to switch out. Swagger is a great move choice because it can give the opposition a lot of trouble from confusion, but it is basically a 50/50 coin flip, and is often as risky as it is rewarding. Still, it can be used on a partner with a Lum Berry or Persim Berry, essentially giving them a free +2 Attack boost before their assault. Yache Berry, Wacan Berry, and Charti Berry can be used to offset its weaknesses, but Tornadus prefers holding a Flying Gem for Acrobatics.</p> <p>An entirely different set involving Prankster Rain Dance and Hurricane can be used. This is probably one of the best special sets Tornadus can run; utilizing a moveset of Hurricane / Focus Blast / Rain Dance / Tailwind, with an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid Nature. Flying Gem and Damp Rock are both decent item choices for this set. Unfortunately, Thundurus outclasses this set too, and in general, Tornadus is best used as a physical attacker, since that is a role Thundurus, its life-long rival, cannot fill.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The easiest way to beat Tornadus is by using an Electric-type. Bulky Thundurus is probably the best, as it can nail Tornadus with a Prankster Thunder Wave (assuming Tornadus is running a Defiant set) and finish it off with a Thunderbolt. Rotom-W and Zapdos are also great choices to put a stop to Tornadus's shenanigans, as they can both OHKO it with a Thunderbolt. Ice-types such as Kyurem and Kyurem-Black are also great choices to put a stop to Tornadus. Faster Ice-types, such as Weavile, Choice Scarf Cloyster, and Choice Scarf Abomasnow, can take out Tornadus before it can hit back; Mamoswine and Abomasnow can also deal heavy damage through Ice Shard, though Abomasnow will need to watch out for Acrobatics. Cloyster and Mamoswine additionally get special mentions, as Icicle Spear will tear through a Prankster Tornadus's Substitute.</p> <p>Rock-types that can tank a Superpower will also work out nicely if they get a safe switch in; Chople Tyranitar is an example of this. Like Ice-types, speedy Rock-types, such as Scarf Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, can take Tornadus down before it can attack. Terrakion can also be a large issue, especially if it is holding a Choice Scarf, though it will need some investment to tank a Flying Gem Acrobatics or Superpower. A less efficient way to beat Tornadus is Intimidate, which can weaken Prankster sets; however, you have to be sure that Tornadus is using Prankster, as Defiant sets will gain a boost from Intimidate and put you in a very bad situation. Additionally, Steel-types that can tank Superpower, such as Metagross and Jirachi, will also put a stop to Tornadus, as they can tank its attacks and hit hard in return.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Defiant Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This is Tornadus's defining set. Defiant allows it to laugh at Intimidate, which will only give its attacks more power. It can also gain power from Icy Wind, though the loss of Speed still hurts it. A Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics is incredibly powerful; anything that doesn't resist it is going to take a lot of damage, and frail resists such as Thundurus will still take heavy damage as well. Superpower rounds out Tornadus's coverage, nailing Rock-types such as Tyranitar, who resist Acrobatics, very hard. The choice of moves in third slot is a difficult one. Taunt is generally the most common choice, stopping Trick Room, Tailwind, and more unfriendly status. Tailwind is also an option, allowing your team to move faster than the opposition, which can be very useful. U-turn stands out as an offensive option if your doesn't need any support, and also lets Tornadus switch out while doing some damage. Protect is in the fourth slot, as it allows Tornadus to guard itself against opposing attacks while its partner on the field handles things.</p> <p>The spread is simple, with maximum Speed and Attack investment. For moves, Tornadus doesn't really have many other options. The third slot can be filled by Substitute, but this counteracts the effects of Defiant, and Tornadus has better options. Bulk Up can be used to boost Tornadus's power to higher levels and increase its Defense so that it doesn't have to worry as much about priority, but it is pretty situational, even with Rage Powder support, because Tornadus is weak to spread attacks such as Rock Slide and Blizzard.</p> <p>This set pairs well with Steel-types, as they can switch in to dangerous Ice- and Rock-type attacks, emerge without a scratch, and blow the opposition to the ground with STAB moves. Metagross and Scizor are particularly useful, nailing threats to Tornadus, Tyranitar in particular, with Bullet Punch. Jirachi gets a mention, as it can use Follow Me to redirect Electric-type attacks; it also resists common spread moves that trouble Tornadus, such as Blizzard and Rock Slide. Heatran is another good choice, especially against Ice-types, though it rarely runs a Steel-type STAB move. Lightningrod is an ability Tornadus can work well with, redirecting Electric-type attacks away from it. Unfortunately, very few Pokemon have this ability, and the best users of it are Rhyperior, Rhydon, and Manectric, who have some crippling weaknesses; Rhyperior also prefers Solid Rock in most cases. Ground-types that are not deathly weak to Rotom-W are good teammates as well, since they can freely spam STAB Earthquake to deliver heavy damage to Rock- and Steel-types. Mold Breaker Excadrill and Garchomp are the best Pokemon to pair with Tornadus that fit the bill. Mold Breaker Excadrill, in particular, ignores Rotom-W's ability and can easily dispose of it with an Earthquake; making a solid team with Mold Breaker Excadrill is very difficult, though. This set works well with anything that hates Intimidate, as it will make Intimidate Pokemon risky to send in, allowing Tornadus's partners to work without worry of their attacks being weakened. Fighting-types have good offensive synergy with Tornadus as well; Terrakion, Hitmontop, Conkeldurr, Breloom, and others work very well with it, taking out potentially hazardous Ice- and Rock-types with their Fighting-type STAB attacks. Hydreigon can be useful, as it is able to deal heavy damage to bulkier Pokemon such as Cresselia and Rotom-W with a Dark Pulse and Draco Meteor, respectively.</p> "

        "name": "Tailwind Support",
        "description": "<p>This set aims to make the most of Tornadus's other ability: Prankster. Thanks to Prankster, Tailwind goes up with priority, meaning Tornadus will almost always get Tailwind up. It also gives Tornadus access to priority Taunt, which helps shut down opposing Trick Room and Thunder Wave users, which a Tailwind team hates, making Tornadus a great team supporter. Acrobatics is the STAB attack of choice, dealing heavy damage to a variety of threats. Superpower can be used in slot 2, rounding out coverage, but Taunt is an option here as well. Substitute is useful on this set because it does not have Defiant, and most opponents would not dare to bring in their Intimidate-user on the turn Tornadus sets up a Substitute.</p> <p>Rain Dance is an option here, allowing Tornadus either support a rain team or mess with opposing weather. While you may want to use Hurricane on this set, Acrobatics does not rely on rain to hit, and thus it is the better option, especially due to the fact that it can OHKO Amoonguss and Latios while Hurricane can't. In general, this set pairs well with Pokemon with middling Speed; Heracross, Chandelure, and Mamoswine all appreciate Tailwind support. Steel-type attackers also make good teammates. Pokemon such as Scizor, Metagross, Bisharp, and Heatran resist Rock- and Ice-type attacks that Tornadus hates, and can strike Ice- and Rock-types back with high-powered Steel-type attacks. Fighting-type attackers such as Terrakion, Hitmontop, and Breloom will also make great teammates; Breloom particularly loves a Tailwind boost, as it allows Breloom to cripple dangerous threats with Spore. Hitmontop can also provide Fake Out support, allowing Tailwind to be set safely. Tornadus also pairs well with Ground-types, such as Garchomp and Mold Breaker Excadrill, both of which can spam Earthquake without worrying about injuring Tornadus. They both greatly appreciate the Speed boost to outrun the likes of Latios and Terrakion, and have effective offensive synergy with Tornadus's Acrobatics. Hydreigon is also a good option, as it can take out threats to Tornadus with a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor and dent Trick Room setters such as Cresselia with Dark Pulse.</p> "

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Out of the few Ubers that dropped into the metagame in the shift from Singles to Doubles, Thundurus truly stands out as one of the most effective. With its godsend of an ability in Prankster and access to Thunder Wave, it can spread paralysis extremely effectively, making it an extremely huge pain for fast-paced teams to face. With Thunder Waves being thrown all over the place, bulky offense also gets a chance to plow through the paralyzed opposition. Besides being able to paralyze as many Pokemon as possible, Thundurus itself has a neat base Special Attack of 125, allowing it to deal solid damage with its STAB Thunderbolt and coverage move of choice. The ability to fill two roles with a single moveset is something that Thundurus does very effectively, and any team should be prepared to take on both Prankster Thunder Wave and strong BoltBeam coverage.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There are not many things that you should consider trying with Thundurus unless you have some good teambuilding skills. For STAB moves, the only really viable ones to try out are Thunder and Discharge; Thunder requires rain support, and Discharge requires teammates immune to it but could perform well in a core with Garchomp's Earthquake, though because spread moves are weakened, it won't be doing enough damage most of the time. For coverage moves, there are two that stand out: Grass Knot and Focus Blast. Grass Knot could prove very useful to hit Gastrodon and the rare Swampert, and Focus Blast does major damage to non-Chople Berry Tyranitar. That said, these moves are all situational and not nearly as reliable as Thundurus's main moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best way to counter Thundurus is by either using slow, bulky Rock-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Rhyperior, as they can easily stomach anything thrown at them and OHKO back with STAB Rock Slide, or by using Ground-types that can take Hidden Power Ice such as Excadrill and Yache Berry Landorus-T.</p> <p>Another way to deal with Thundurus is to lure in Thunder Waves and play around them with smart switching and Protecting. Thundurus also hates facing Lum Berry Pokemon, as they force it to waste a turn burning their Berries. Lightning Rod is another thorn in the side of Thundurus's paralysis spree, as it will redirect the Thunder Wave and gain the user a free boost. You can also limit its use by using Safeguard, as it will prevent Thundurus from paralyzing anything.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Support",
        "description": "<p>A well-played Thundurus can be a nightmare for any team, spreading paralysis and dealing massive damage to a good handful of Pokemon. This set is a supportive attacker and is very effective for offensive teams that need speed control. The combination of Prankster and Thunder Wave lets Thundurus paralyze at least one Pokemon guaranteed, provided your opponent doesn't outplay you with smart use of Protect. Getting one Pokemon paralyzed usually doesn't happen in Thundurus's case, because it more often than not gets to paralyze or damage at least two or three. Thunder Wave is a move that you should always use on Thundurus, as it allows for top-notch speed control. Thunderbolt is Thundurus's main STAB move, and if you are using an Electric Gem, it can OHKO anything in the tier weak to it. The choice of which Hidden Power you want is up to personal preference. Hidden Power Ice has better coverage alongside Thunderbolt and also doesn't hurt Thundurus's IVs too much. Hidden Power Flying provides an extra STAB move with decent coverage, but it requires dropping all stat IVs to 30 except for Speed. Protect is the safest option for the final moveslot, considering that it is a massive staple in Doubles, and it provides Thundurus with a way to keep itself safe while its partner takes out one of its counters. Taunt can prove effective if your team is weak to Trick Room and to generally limit Pokemon like Cresselia and bulky Whimsicott in pulling off their shenanigans. Substitute can be used as a pseudo-Protect with Prankster taken into account, and if you manage to set up a free one, Thundurus will become a huge threat to any team.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Thundurus to fulfill the role of a fast special attacker as well as it can. Full Speed investment helps it outspeed many relevant threats such as Terrakion, Latios, Garchomp, Infernape, and Manaphy, allowing it do a good chunk of damage to them all and even OHKO a few of them. Electric Gem is preferred on weatherless and chip damage weather teams, as Focus Sash is useless in Sandstorm and Hail, but if you are running a Sunny Day or Rain Dance team, a Focus Sash will help Thundurus survive a single hit, which is often useful for paralyzing as much of the opposition and acting as a glass cannon at the same time. You could also run Flying Gem in tandem with Hidden Power Flying, as that would enable Thundurus to OHKO Hitmontop and Ludicolo. Because Thundurus is weak to Blizzard and Rock Slide, Yache Berry and Charti Berry are also viable options, albeit more situational than Electric Gem and Focus Sash.</p> <p>This specific Thundurus fits teams that like to utilize speed control as much as possible yet still need some offensive presence. Bulky offensive Pokemon such as Heatran, Kyurem-B, Metagross, and Landorus-T all love Thunder Wave support, and Thundurus is the man for the job. If you want to let Thundurus shine as much as possible, it's a good idea to pair it with a Hitmontop or Infernape, due to Fake Out giving it more room to spread paralysis and their STAB Close Combats taking care of Thundurus's worst nightmare, Tyranitar. Hitmontop also appreciates Thunder Wave support, as it now gets to outspeed most opponents and hit hard with a Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat. Hitmontop can also shield Thundurus from its huge weaknesses to Rock Slide and Blizzard with the use of Wide Guard.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set aims to disrupt as much as it can through using Taunt and Thunder Wave, and does so to great effect with its bulk. The combination of said moves will allow Thundurus to counter both fast-paced teams and Trick Room teams. It can work wonders for your average bulky, offensive team, paralyzing as many Pokemon as it can before going down. Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice are usually the preferred attacking moves, as without Hidden Power Ice, Thundurus cannot hit Ground-types for much damage and they are the only thing standing in the way of it paralyzing entire teams. Hidden Power Flying is of course an option for STAB damage, but missing out on Ground-types is a real bummer. Sitrus Berry is the main item, as Thundurus takes on the supportive role of a disruptor here, and Sitrus Berry helps it stick around to paralyze more Pokemon.</p> <p>Like those used on most other specially defensive Pokemon neutral to Dragon-type attacks, the EVs allow Thundurus to survive a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor from Timid Latios 100% of the time. On the physical side, Thundurus is guaranteed to survive Adamant Tyranitar's Rock Slide + sand damage and therefore also Terrakion's, letting it catch these usual counters off guard. The 20 Speed EVs are to outspeed Jolly max Speed base 70s, letting Thundurus catch Breloom in particular with a Hidden Power of choice. An added bonus is outspeeding neutral max Speed base 80s such as Mamoswine and Chandelure. Some moves you could try out on this set include Role Play to either spam a lot of Intimidate or reactivate your weather, Swagger to be an annoying person who chooses to rely on hax, and Rain Dance. Rain Dance would work similar to Role Play + Drizzle, but it is a bit more reliable, as it doesn't force you to have your Politoed in the team spot beside Thundurus.</p> <p>When looking for teammates to accompany bulky Thundurus, you should pick a lot of different bulky attackers, as those Pokemon really appreciate consistent Thunder Wave support. Pokemon with awkward base Speeds between 60 and 80 now find themselves outspeeding even the fastest threats in the Doubles metagame due to Thunder Wave slowing down their opponents by 75%. Other than that, if you pack a Breloom or other Fighting-type, you will be able to fight, pun intended, your way through the Ice- and Rock-type Pokemon that threaten Thundurus.</p> "

  "Landorus": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its great offensive stats as well as two excellent ability choices, Landorus can quickly pose a threat to opposing teams. Sand Force turns it into a potent sand sweeper, granting Landorus's physical moves a sizable damage increase. Access to STAB-boosted Earthquake further bolsters Landorus's offenses, providing it with a powerful spread move. Its other ability, On top of that, its base 101 Speed allows it to outpace important Pokemon such as Volcarona and Manaphy. Its decent bulk and good typing helps provide useful resistances and immunities, such as to Ground-, Fighting-, and Electric-type attacks. Sadly however, its typing leaves it weak to other common spread moves such as Blizzard and Surf, and it can struggle against some team types due to this. Landorus can overcome these minor setbacks though, and its offensive prowess, typing, and bulk give more than enough reasons to use it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A physical set with Choice Scarf can be used to let Landorus clean up late-game with Earthquake, but due to the abundance of Earthquake immune Pokemon as well as Landorus's common weaknesses, it can be difficult to use. A set with Gravity or Smack Down can be used to take out Pokemon such as Rotom-W, which would otherwise have nothing to fear from Landorus, but finding time to use either can be difficult and they come at the cost of a move with more utility. In addition, when using Gravity, Earthquake can now hit almost any of Landorus's potential partners, so you must either Protect or have a Pokemon with Telepathy out such as Musharna to avoid taking damage. Bulldoze can be a nice option to grant speed control, but it is significantly weaker than Earthquake and still hits Landorus's partner. Imprison can be nice to remove an opposing Pokemon's access to Protect and also renders Pokemon such as Excadrill and Landorus-T useless. Swords Dance can be useful because it makes Landorus's Attack skyrocket, but it can be difficult to find time to set it up. Rock Polish is also an option for a setup move for a late-game sweep, but it is tough to set up, and Landorus can still be taken out with priority.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Cresselia is an amazing counter to Landorus, taking little to no damage from any of its sets and being able to hit back hard with Icy Wind. Swift Swim Pokemon such as Kingdra and Ludicolo make for good checks as they can outspeed and easily KO with rain-boosted Water-type attacks. Common hail Pokemon such as Abomasnow, Rotom-F, and Kyurem are also great checks as they can take a hit and strike with a fully accurate Blizzard. However, Rotom-F and Kyurem must watch out for Stone Edge from the physical set and Focus Blast from the special set. Mamoswine can take Landorus out with an Ice Shard before it has a chance to hit with an attack of its own. If Mamoswine has Icicle Spear it can even get around Yache Berry and Substitute. Weavile can also use Ice Shard to decimate Landorus and naturally outspeeds it, so it could use Ice Punch too. Rotom-W is immune to one of Landorus's STABs, resists the other, and can strike back with its own Water-type attacks. Gyarados is also immune to Landorus's Ground-type STAB, has Intimidate to limit its offensive presence, and can deal heavy damage with Waterfall. Opposing Landorus make for good checks due to their good bulk and Ground-type immunity. Landorus-T makes for an even better check, as it has a Ground-type immunity, good bulk, and access to Intimidate to cripple physical Landorus sets. Both formes must watch out for a Hidden Power Ice from special Landorus though. Latios and Togekiss make for great checks to the special set, as they are immune to Earth Power and don't take very much from its other moves. Togekiss can even redirect Landorus's hits with Follow Me while a partner KOes it. Scrafty is a great check to physical Landorus, with access to Intimidate to neuter its offenses and Ice Punch to take it out. It loses to the special set though. Hitmontop also has Intimidate and can use Wide Guard to block Earthquake. However, Earthquake still does a lot of damage even after the Intimidate drop, and Hitmontop is taken out by the special set as well. Excadrill can outpace Landorus in sand and use Magnet Rise to give itself an immunity to its Ground-type STAB, and it resists most of the other moves Landorus commonly has.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>When using Sheer Force, Landorus quickly becomes a fearsome special attacker, with its high Speed and Special Attack letting it quickly put holes in the opposing team. Landorus is also the only Pokemon in the tier that can be an effective Ground-type special attacker, so it is a great option to avoid using Earthquake, which can injure your partners. Earth Power is the main STAB move on the set, and is a great option since it gets a boost from Sheer Force and can do good damage to anything it hits neutrally. Hidden Power Flying is a nice option to hit Grass-types such as Breloom and Amoonguss harder than Earth Power would and has good coverage with Earth Power. Psychic is another option, hitting Fighting-types and other Pokemon such as Amoonguss as well as freeing Landorus to use Hidden Power Ice to hit Dragon-types. However while Psychic does have more power than Hidden Power Flying, it is resisted by important Pokemon such as Latios, Cresselia, Scrafty, and Hydreigon. Grass Knot is used to hit bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Gastrodon for more damage than Earth Power would, which is great because they can easily tank an Earth Power and KO Landorus in return. Hidden Power Ice is an option to hit Grass-types super effectively and also grants coverage on Dragon-types such as Salamence and Latios.</p> <p>Life Orb is the main item listed because Sheer Force negates its recoil drawback on some of Landorus's moves, essentially giving Landorus a free 30% damage increase. Yache Berry is another good option to let Landorus live an Ice Shard or Hidden Power Ice that would normally take it out with ease. With max Speed and a Timid nature, Landorus is able to pass the important base 100 Speed tier and outpace Pokemon such as Manaphy and Volcarona. However, a spread of 88 HP / 252 SpA / 168 Spe and a Modest nature can be used to outspeed neutral base 90s if you want more power. Focus Sash can be used if you want Landorus to be able to live through any hit at full health and strike back, but it can be broken easily, and Landorus appreciates the Life Orb boost. A Ground Gem is also a nice option for a high-powered Earth Power, but Life Orb's consistent power boost is usually preferable. Sludge Wave can be used to give Landorus a spread move, but lack of STAB and the fact that it hits Landorus's partner generally makes it a subpar option. Focus Blast can be a nice option since it hits Rotom-W, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon harder than any other moves it has, as well as providing excellent coverage alongside HP Flying. Sadly, its shaky accuracy makes it very risky to use in the fast-paced Doubles format.</p> <p>Landorus has trouble against Rain and Hail teams due to being weak to attacks commonly found on those teams, so Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Breloom make for great partners since they can handle those team types. Pokemon such as Tyranitar also make for excellent partners since they can deal heavy damage to Cresselia and Latios, who are otherwise hard counters to Landorus. Speed control such as Icy Wind is useful to allow Landorus to beat Pokemon such as Shaymin-S and Latios who would otherwise easily outspeed Landorus. Substitute can be used to let Landorus protect itself from stat drops and attacks, but the lack of an additional coverage move can hamper Landorus's offenses.</p> "
      },

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>While one might think that Excadrill is generally more suited to run a set like this, Sand Force, superior typing, and less of a reliance on sand being up all allow Landorus to carve out a great niche for itself. Earthquake is the main STAB move, and is a great attack since it can hit both opposing Pokemon at once. One must be wary of using it though since it hits your ally as well, so be sure to have a Pokemon with a Ground-type immunity on the field or have your ally use Protect to avoid taking damage. Rock Slide is a good coverage option since it can hit the Flying-types and Levitate Pokemon that would not be affected by Earthquake. While it has spread coverage, which can be useful, it also deals middling damage due to the lack of STAB and spread damage reduction, so Stone Edge is an option to deal more damage against targets. Stone Edge also lets you play around Wide Guard, which can come in handy when you need to KO Pokemon such as Volcarona. Since those two moves already grant it great coverage, Substitute makes a great option in the 3rd slot to shield Landorus from powerful spread moves and ease prediction. Thanks to Landorus's good bulk and typing, it doesn't have trouble setting up a Substitute, especially when one of the Pokemon out on the opposing side is a supporter. Once sitting behind a Substitute, Landorus has no trouble tearing holes in opposing teams. Substitute is also great to take advantage of moves such as Protect, Wide Guard, and Sucker Punch that your opponent may be using. If you're not comfortable using Substitute, U-turn is an option to bring another Pokemon in without the loss of momentum that accompanies switching out. Using Landorus with a Normal Gem and Explosion can be a good way to net some kills against an unsuspecting opponent, but it will hit your partner for high amounts of damage if it lacks an immunity and is not using Protect, so it can be a constraining option at times.</p> <p>A Yache Berry is the main option here to let Landorus live through Ice Shards, non-STAB Hidden Powers, and Ice Beams that would otherwise take it out, but if using Explosion, a Normal Gem should be used. Life Orb can be an option to grant Landorus even more destructive power, but the recoil can hurt Landorus's longevity, especially when using Substitute. Soft Sand is a good option to grant a consistent 20% damage increase to Landorus's Earthquake. A Ground Gem is also a cool choice to power up Earthquake, although it provides a one-time benefit, so Landorus might be better served by other items. Leftovers can be nice when using Substitute to allow Landorus to regain some HP lost from Substitute, but it's generally not too useful since Landorus won't be gaining back too much health due to the short length of the average Doubles match. The EV spread is used to outspeed neutral base 90s while granting maximum power. A spread with maximum Speed and a Jolly nature can be used to let Landorus better check Volcarona though. Hidden Power Ice and a Naive nature can be used to let Landorus take care of Landorus-T and opposing Landorus, but it usually appreciates another move in the 3rd slot more. If your team has issues with Brelooom, Hidden Power Flying can also be used to swiftly eliminate it.</p> <p>Fake Out, Follow Me, or Rage Powder support provides opportunities to set up a Substitute. Togekiss is an excellent user of Follow Me that is also immune to Earthquake. Because Landorus is weak to common spread moves such as Surf and Blizzard, Wide Guard support can be useful to shield it from being KOed by them. Hitmontop, Conkeldurr, and Scrafty make for good partners as they can dispatch the Ice-types that threaten Landorus. Hitmontop and Conkeldurr also have Wide Guard, allowing them to further support Landorus. Hitmontop and Scrafty can use Fake Out to give Landorus free turns to wreak havoc as well. Because Landorus can easily be taken out by Ice-types, Pokemon that can threaten them such as Scizor make for excellent partners. Thunder Wave and Icy Wind support from Pokemon such as Thundurus and Cresselia can be useful to help Landorus outpace faster Pokemon such as Shaymin-S and Latios. Thundurus and Cresselia in particular are also immune to Earthquake, meaning that Landorus can use it without fear of hurting them. Pairing Landorus with Tyranitar is mandatory to activate Sand Force's Attack boost. Tyranitar is also great because it threatens Latios, Cresselia, and Ice-types such as Kyurem and Rotom-F. Because Landorus-T is such a great answer to Landorus, Pokemon that can eliminate it make for good partners. Defiant Pokemon such as Tornadus and Bisharp can deter it from switching in, but Bisharp takes super effective damage from Earthquake coming from both Landorus and Landorus-T, and having both Tornadus and Landorus out makes you extremely BlizzSpam weak. Latios and Rotom-W can both eliminate Landorus-T with their powerful STAB-boosted attacks. They also both have Levitate, making them great partners to Landorus.</p> "

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>From its massive base 145 Attack, Intimidate, and STAB Earthquake right down to its sprite and roar-like cry, Landorus-T fits the very definition of a beast. With these essential tools, it preys on common sandstorm teams or just about any team heavily reliant on physical attackers with its Fighting-type resistance and Ground- and Electric-type immunities, which grant Landorus-T ample opportunities to switch in and cast its intimidating glare on its opponents. The main problems with using Landorus-T are its Water- and Ice-type weaknesses and the fact that Earthquake hits your ally as well, which makes it difficult to build around. Nevertheless, Landorus-T is a remarkably well-rounded Pokemon whose faults mainly lie in its straightforward checks, and is quite capable of keeping many common Pokemon under its paw.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T has a lot of options. Hidden Power Flying can be used to dispatch Breloom and 2HKO bulkier Fighting-types such as Hitmontop with some Special Attack investment. Hidden Power Ice can help against opposing Landorus-T and Dragon-types. Imprison can be used, as it prevents the opposition from using Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Protect, all of which tend to be fairly common. Swords Dance can be used, allowing Landorus-T to become a complete menace if given the opportunity to set up. Gravity is a unique option, guaranteeing that Stone Edge or Rock Slide will hit, while allowing you to destroy opponents such as Rotom-W with Earthquake. However, it also means you will hit common allies such as Cresselia and Thundurus with Earthquake as well, which can be a major drawback. Bulldoze can provide Landorus-T with its own Speed control, but be warned, it is really, really weak. Hammer Arm is an option over Superpower if you don't like losing attack power, or if for some reason you decide to use Landorus-T on a Trick Room team.</p> <p>Landorus-T also has a few notable alternative item choices. Choice Band can be used to rack up some notable OHKOs on Bisharp, Tyranitar, and non-Shuca Berry Metagross. Ground Gem can also achieve these KOs without locking you into a move, but it can only do so once per game. Finally, Normal Gem can be used alongside Explosion, allowing you to decimate anything that doesn't resist the move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Rain teams are one of the best ways to dispatch Landorus-T, as common Swift Swim sweepers such as Ludicolo and Kingdra can outspeed even the Choice Scarf set and proceed to OHKO. Ice-type attacks are also going to ruin Landorus-T's day; common Ice-types such as Abomasnow and Mamoswine can dispatch it assuming that Yache Berry is either not being run or has already been used. A special mention goes to the standard Choice Scarf Cloyster set, as it can break through Yache Berry and Focus Sash with Icicle Spear and can tank a Superpower off of Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Cresselia is able to force Landorus-T out, as its only option to hit Cresselia is U-turn, which results in Landorus-T leaving the field. Cresselia can also set up Trick Room. This leaves Landorus-T vulnerable to slower attackers, including Cresselia itself, which can take Landorus-T down with Ice Beam. Opposing Intimidate Pokemon, such as Hitmontop and opposing Landorus-T, can nerf the power of Landorus-T's attacks, leaving it open to a lot of attackers. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Rotom-W, and Politoed won't care about Landorus-T's attacks very much and can take it down with their Water-type attacks; Rotom-W in particular is a nuisance because it is immune to Landorus-T's Earthquake. Fast Dragon-type attackers, such as Latios and Hydreigon, are immune to Earthquake and can OHKO Landorus-T with their respective Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteors; just beware of Focus Sash, as a U-turn is going to do a lot of damage. Additionally, Kyurem-B and Kyurem can smack Landorus-T around with their STAB Ice-type attacks, but must be wary of Stone Edge and Superpower. Landorus and Breloom don't mind any of Landorus-T's attacks bar a Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Flying in Breloom's case, and can proceed to cripple Landorus-T with Hidden Power Ice or Spore, respectively. Finally, Defiant attackers, such as Tornadus and Bisharp, will become very powerful if they get hit by Intimidate and pressure Landorus-T into staying off of the field.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<p>This set aims to be versatile by utilizing both its attacking prowess and its ability: Intimidate. Earthquake is, of course, Landorus-T's main attack, as it receives a STAB boost and does spread damage, though you have to be careful and use either Flying-types or Pokemon with Levitate, or use Protect with a grounded partner, so they don't feel Landorus-T's wrath as well. Stone Edge is better than Rock Slide for immediate power that can net notable OHKOs on threats such as bulky Thundurus. U-turn dents Cresselia and Latios nicely and spreads chip damage along with a potential free switch. Superpower is more straightforward, as it provides nice Fighting-type coverage against Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Kyurem, and redundancy with Earthquake for when Landorus-T's partner would be hit. Stealth Rock can rack up a lot of chip and enable OHKOs for partners like Latios, but Protect is also great as always.</p> <p>Focus Sash is the main item option as it allows Landorus-T to survive Draco Meteors, Muddy Waters, and Ice Beams. Adamant is required to OHKO bulky Thundurus with Stone Edge without a boosting item, but even then it isn't guaranteed. Another option is running Jolly Rock Gem, which not only guarantees the OHKO on Thundurus but outspeeds and chunks Kyurem-B, although forgoing a defensive item means Landorus-T will be more reliant on Speed control and safe switching to stay afloat.</p> <p>As with any Pokemon using Earthquake, it's important to have Ground-type immunities. Cresselia and bulky Thundurus are two prime candidates for this role, as they both offer reliable Speed control. Cresselia can also power up Landorus-T's Earthquake with Helping Hand, giving it enough power to OHKO common threats such as Metagross and Tyranitar. Offensively, Latios can apply offensive pressure with Draco Meteor, though pairing it up with Landorus-T makes the duo rather susceptible to common Ice-type attacks.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Earthquake is a given as Landorus-T's main STAB. Stone Edge is preferred over Rock Slide on this set because it can nab OHKOs on threats such as Thundurus, Tornadus, and Shaymin-S. U-turn is the typical choice for the third slot, allowing Landorus-T to switch out while doing damage to threats that otherwise give it a lot of trouble, such as Cresselia. The final slot can be filled with a lot of options. Superpower is the most preferred, as it allows Landorus-T to deal heavier damage to threats such as Rotom-W and also OHKOes Bisharp and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, which Earthquake cannot consistently do. Rock Slide is still an option for the last slot alongside Stone Edge, as it provides spread damage and comes with a nifty 30% flinch rate. Finally, Explosion can be used, dealing massive damage to both opponents while providing a team member with a safe switch-in. However, it can be blocked by Protect and also hits your ally, so use it with caution.</p> <p>Landorus-T doesn't have many options in terms of spreads. You could EV it to live a Dark Gem Sucker Punch off of a +1 Bisharp, but this takes a spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 228 Def / 24 Spe, which costs too much Speed for it to pay off in most cases, given that Bisharp isn't going to be around every match.</p> <p>Since this set will get locked into Earthquake a lot, you will want several teammates that can avoid taking damage from it. Some particularly notable partners that accomplish this include Rotom-W, Latios, Cresselia, Togekiss, and Hydreigon. Rotom-W can dispatch Flying-types that avoid damage from Earthquake and can also handle opposing Ground-types, such as Landorus-T and Mamoswine. Latios makes for a great offensive partner for Landorus-T, as it can spam Draco Meteor with less risk since Earthquake can dispatch Steel-types that resist Latios's attacks. Cresselia can be a helpful support ally, boosting Landorus-T's powerful attacks even further with Helping Hand, while Ice Beam can dispatch Flying-types that give Landorus-T trouble if it is locked into Earthquake. Togekiss is a great support partner, redirecting harmful attacks not named Blizzard or Surf. It can also boost Landorus-T's attacks with Helping Hand like Cresselia can. Rotom-F can be absolutely destructive alongside this set with some hail support, as the combination of Earthquake and Blizzard will tear through almost anything. Hydreigon works alongside Landorus-T like Latios does, but it can also use Dark Pulse to deal heavy damage to various Trick Room setters that can be a big issue for Landorus-T. There are a few other partners to consider that aren't immune to Earthquake. Most notably, Abomasnow can spam Blizzard alongside Landorus-T and also resists Earthquake, allowing the pair to dish out some serious damage when given the opportunity. Hitmontop can guard Landorus-T against harmful attacks such as Blizzard with Wide Guard and also provides Fake Out support, while taking out Ice-types that would give Landorus-T a lot of trouble. Finally, Volcarona can help this set, redirecting attacks such as Ice Beam with Rage Powder and taking out troublesome Ice-types and Cresselia with Heat Wave and Bug Buzz, respectively.</p> "

  "Kyurem": {
    "overview": "<p>Kyurem is a menace to behold on the battlefield. Its immense 125 / 90 / 90 defenses are backed by equally intimidating base 130 offenses, and while base 95 Speed is by no means extraordinary, it is more than enough for Kyurem to work with. Kyurem's typing also gives it a powerful offensive presence, as Ice- and Dragon-type attacks are some of the most feared in the tier. There is a downside, though, as the Kyurem's Ice / Dragon typing leaves it weak to common attacking types such as Steel, Fighting, Dragon, and Rock. Fortunately, some useful resistances to Electric and Water help offset this somewhat, alongside Kyurem's stellar bulk.</p> <p>However, as powerful as Kyurem might seem, Kyurem-B exists. This means the majority of Kyurem's roles are outclassed, as Kyurem-B sports higher bulk, a massive base 170 Attack, and Fusion Bolt. In fact, Kyurem's only real advantage is that it has a higher base 130 Special Attack. This is more than enough for Kyurem, though, as it allows it to spam one of, if not the, most powerful Blizzards in the metagame. This makes Kyurem a very popular choice to use on hail teams. While this may not seem like much of an advantage, Kyurem has earned its place as the face of hail in Doubles for a reason; underestimate it at your own peril.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>First and foremost, Glaciate is an option Kyurem has that can provide for a decent spread attack outside of hail while also providing for its own speed control. Blizzard is much more powerful and Kyurem tends to be fairly frail, unfortunately. As such, Glaciate should really be considered only on bulky sets because they can make more use of this move. Focus Blast is yet another option for hitting Steel-types, but Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire are preferred because they don't have Focus Blast's shaky 70% accuracy, making them more reliable options. Light Screen and Reflect are both options for Kyurem; Light Screen in particular is great if you are using Kyurem to help against rain teams, as it really holds the power of Water-type spread attacks like Muddy Water and Surf back. Imprison is an option as it allows Kyurem to lock the opponent off of Protect and Draco Meteor, which can make Kyurem even harder to work around. Life Orb can provide for a consistent power boost that doesn't lock Kyurem into a move like Choice Specs would, but the recoil that comes with it will make Kyurem heavily susceptible to Bullet Punch and Mach Punch. Hail allows Kyurem to provide hail support without Abomasnow's help and can be used alongside Abomasnow to win weather wars, but it is difficult to find room for such an option and Abomasnow can usually beat opposing Politoed and Tyranitar anyway. Finally, a physical set could be an option with Kyurem's base 130 Attack stat, but Kyurem-B outclasses this entirely. As such, the main merit of this set would be surprise value, though Kyurem is better off using a typical special set anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Steel-types are usually the best checks to Kyurem because they can switch into Blizzard and Draco Meteor safely, though they must be played carefully due to Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire. Heatran can handle sets that run Hidden Power Fire with ease and can survive an Earth Power if it holds Shuca Berry, allowing it to hit Kyurem with Heat Wave. Metagross can tank both Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire assuming Kyurem isn't running Choice Specs and OHKO with Meteor Mash, as well as pick off weakened Kyurem with Bullet Punch. Scizor can also hit Kyurem hard with Bullet Punch, but most Kyurem are EVed to take that attack and can strike back with Hidden Power Fire, though Occa Berry Scizor can survive this assuming Kyurem isn't running Choice Specs. Bisharp is also a solid option as with 252 HP EVs it can tank an unboosted Earth Power 81% of the time and dish out heavy damage with Iron Head.</p> <p>Fighting-types are also a good answer to Kyurem, especially Hitmontop, which can block Blizzard by using Wide Guard. Conkeldurr and Breloom are also good answers to Kyurem as they pack powerful Mach Punches that will can KO Kyurem if it has been weakened to half of its full HP or less. Terrakion is an option, as it can move before non-Choice Scarf Kyurem and OHKO non-Chople Berry Kyurem with Close Combat. It can also do some heavy damage with Rock Slide. On a similar note, Rock-types can also check Kyurem. Tyranitar in particular can tank any of Kyurem's attacks assuming sand is up and proceed to strike back with Low Kick or Rock Slide. Fire-types can tank Blizzard and strike back with their Fire-type STAB attacks. Volcarona is especially threatening, as Quiver Dance variants can boost up while only fearing Draco Meteor, which will give them another opportunity to Quiver Dance if it is used and fails to KO. Bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Suicune can easily tank any of Kyurem's attacks bar a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor and proceed to set up Trick Room and Tailwind, respectively.</p> <p>While the best way to counter Kyurem is to have Pokemon that can tank its attacks, this is not always the easiest way thanks to its offensive power. Thanks to its only average base 95 Speed, an obvious way to handle Kyurem is to move before it and hammer it with powerful attacks. Faster Dragon-types, such as Latios and Hydreigon, are one of the easiest ways to do this, as a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor will OHKO every Kyurem set except those that run Haban Berry, which will still take heavy damage. Life Orb Excadrill and Kingdra can outspeed even Choice Scarf Kyurem in sand and rain, respectively. Kingdra must be wary of Haban Berry sets, however, as they can strike back for an OHKO. Finally, one of the most effective ways to move before Kyurem is by the use of speed control, as Icy Wind, Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Trick Room will all leave Kyurem all the more easier to deal with. Thunder Wave is particularly effective, as it will not time out or be remedied by Kyurem switching out, allowing you to cripple Kyurem for the rest of the match.</p> ",

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<p>This set aims to use Substitute to help Kyurem use its attacks with less risk, while protecting Kyurem from harmful status such as paralysis and sleep. Blizzard is the preferred STAB option, as it is an insanely powerful spread attack that hits common threats like Thundurus and Latios for an OHKO. However, it requires hail support, so on the off chance you aren't using hail, Ice Beam makes for a solid option, dealing a similar degree of damage to only one opponent at a time. Earth Power is preferred in the second slot, as Draco Meteor is fairly redundant alongside Kyurem's Ice-type STAB move of choice and Earth Power is useful for hitting Steel-types such as Heatran that would otherwise wall Kyurem. Of course, Draco Meteor can still be used, as it is very powerful and hits bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Jellicent, for heavy damage. Protect rounds off the set, protecting Kyurem and giving its partner an opportunity to take out an opponent that could otherwise KO Kyurem.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Kyurem to move before Adamant Landorus-T and the remaining EVs are packed into Special Attack and HP. Ice Gem is the preferred item, as it boosts Blizzard to massive levels of power. However, both Leftovers and Dragon Gem can be used, to allow for more Substitutes and to give Draco Meteor a boost should it be run, respectively. If you use Leftovers, an alternative spread of 36 HP / 248 SpA / 224 Spe with a Modest nature is preferable. The 4 extra HP EVs let Kyurem hit a Leftovers number, allowing Leftovers to heal as much HP per turn as possible at the lost of a very small amount of power. One last option you could consider is NeverMeltIce, as it can consistently give Blizzard a 20% boost, which can prove useful as Substitute can allow Kyurem to stay around for awhile. Ice Gem is preferred most of the time for more immediate power, however.</p> <p>This set is built to be used on with hail support, so Abomasnow is obviously a stellar choice for a partner. Apart from hail support, Abomasnow can use its Grass-type STAB attacks to help take down bulky Water-types like Suicune and Rotom-W for Kyurem. Volcarona is a major threat to Kyurem that lack Draco Meteor, as it can set up multiple Quiver Dances on Kyurem while taking a pittance from anything Kyurem uses. Thus, Pokemon that can defeat Volcarona, such as Terrakion and Garchomp, are good partners. Even with Earth Power, this set still hates many common Steel-types such as Scizor and Bisharp, as well as Tyranitar. As such, teammates that can reliably handle Steel-types, such as Landorus-T, Heatran, Volcarona, Conkeldurr, Breloom, and Hitmontop, make for useful partners. Hitmontop in particular can make this set a true nuisance to work around, allowing Kyurem to get a Substitute up through the use of Fake Out while making Kyurem's Substitutes more difficult to break due to Intimidate, all while protecting Kyurem from dangerous spread attacks, particularly Rock Slide, through the use of Wide Guard. Breloom is also a useful partner, making it easier to get a Substitute up with Spore while also taking out troublesome bulky Water-types. Volcarona is yet another very useful partner, as it can redirect Steel- and Fighting-type attacks with Rage Powder that would otherwise deal heavy damage to Kyurem, though the pair must be wary of Rock Slide. While it cannot handle Steel-types, nor Tyranitar, like the majority of useful partners for Kyurem can, Cresselia is a great teammate for this set. It is capable of supporting Kyurem with Icy Wind and Helping Hand while taking care of troublesome Fighting-types that could otherwise ruin Kyurem's day. Finally, this set makes a nice choice on teams that struggles against rain teams, as thanks to its resistance to Water and efficient bulk, it can set a Substitute safely in front of many common threats that are used on rain teams such as Politoed and Ludicolo.</p> "

        "name": "Choiced Attacker",
        "description": "<p>By equipping itself with a Choice item, Kyurem can gain a useful boost to either its sufficient Speed or its already massive Special Attack, both of which make it all the more terrifying have to deal with. Blizzard is the highlight of the set, as with some hail support it can easily tear down unprepared teams, and even with a Choice Scarf equipped OHKOes common threats like Tornadus, Landorus-T, Latios, and Hydreigon. However, Ice Beam is an option if you are not using Kyurem with hail support, as it deals about the same degree of damage to only one target at a time. Draco Meteor is Kyurem's strongest Dragon-type STAB attack and can deal massive damage to a target. It also helps Kyurem work around bulky Water-types like Suicune and Jellicent to a degree, though if you aren't running Choice Specs Jellicent will still be a challenge to work around. Earth Power is preferred in the third slot, as it hits Heatran, which otherwise thoroughly walls this set. However, Hidden Power Fire is an option as it can OHKO Scizor. Note that if Hidden Power Fire is used, you will need to change this set's spread to 108 HP / 248 SpA / 156 Spe, as the use of Hidden Power Fire will lower Kyurem's Speed IV to 30. Dragon Pulse is preferred in the last slot to provide a Dragon-type STAB that won't force you to switch out; however, Hidden Power Fire is an option here as well, as running both Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire on one set ensures that Kyurem can deal solid damage to any Steel-type opponent it might run into.</p> <p>Hidden Power Rock is an option against Volcarona if it poses a serious threat to your team, though Draco Meteor will still do plenty of damage regardless and Kyurem is not really the best way to counter Volcarona. The given EV spread allows Kyurem to always survive a Steel Gem-boosted Bullet Punch from Scizor, as well as any weaker attacks, which notably includes a Life Orb-boosted Mach Punch off of Breloom. The Speed EVs allow Kyurem to beat everything up to positive-natured Pokemon with base 130 Speed, which notably includes Shaymin-S, Thundurus, Tornadus, Landorus-T, and Latios. The remaining EVs go into Special Attack so that Kyurem can hit as hard as possible. An alternative spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe is an option, as while Kyurem a lot of bulk it can move before other Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Landorus-T. If Choice Specs is used, an alternative spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA can be used to make Kyurem as bulky as possible, though the same spread is preferred since because without Choice Scarf Kyurem still outspeeds Jolly-natured Breloom.</p> <p>Abomasnow is a vital asset to this set, as it provides much-needed hail support, allowing Kyurem to spam Blizzard without risk of missing. As for other partners, this set in particular requires good offensive synergy to function, as it is going to be locked into a move and as such will often need a partner that can take out a threat that it can't. Steel-types, most notably Heatran, are major threats to Kyurem due to their resistances to its STAB moves. Tyranitar is also a large threat to Kyurem due to it removing Kyurem's weather advantage with Sand Stream. Some prime choices for eliminating Steel-types and Tyranitar are Heatran, Landorus, Hitmontop, and Terrakion. Hitmontop is additionally capable of further supporting Kyurem with Fake Out, Feint, Intimidate, and Wide Guard. Some additional threats to cover are bulky Water-types, particularly Jellicent, which can use Trick Room to completely cripple Kyurem for the course of 5 turns if it is holding a Choice Scarf. Rotom-W and Breloom are the best options to eliminate Jellicent and other bulky Water-types such as Suicune thanks to their respective Electric- and Grass-type STAB attacks. Breloom is also capable of doing some serious damage to Tyranitar and Steel-types with a Technician-boosted Mach Punch.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Even though Kyurem's main advantage is in its Special Attack, one must not overlook its wonderful bulk. This set aims to use that bulk to tank hits and then strike back with powerful attacks. Draco Meteor is preferred in slot one, as it gives Kyurem a ton of power, but because it means Kyurem will have to switch out, Dragon Pulse can be used for more consistency. Blizzard is Kyurem's most powerful Ice-type STAB attack, but if you don't have the room for the hail support it needs, Ice Beam is a reliable option to fall back on. Earth Power rounds off Kyurem's coverage, hitting Steel-types like Heatran and Metagross for some heavy damage. However, Hidden Power Fire can be used in Earth Power's place, as it is Kyurem's best option against Scizor, which would otherwise care very little about Kyurem's attempts to damage it. Protect rounds off the set, allowing Kyurem to guard itself from dangerous attacks and giving its ally an opportunity to take out the source of those attacks.</p> <p>Haban Berry is usually the preferred item, as most Dragon-types are faster than Kyurem, making the need to tank Dragon-type attacks larger. However, Chople Berry is a great option as well, particularly for taking Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combats from the likes of Hitmontop and Terrakion. With the given spread and the proper Berry mentioned above, Kyurem can always endure either a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor off of Timid Latios or a Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat off of Terrakion. If Haban Berry is run, an alternative spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 SpD with a Modest nature is an option, allowing Kyurem to survive more powerful Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteors from the likes of Modest Latios and Kyurem. However, this spread sacrifices a significant amount of physical bulk, not to mention Modest Latios are very rare, so it is not preferred.</p> <p>Once again, Abomasnow makes an appearance as a key partner for Kyurem, providing the hail support that is necessary in order for Kyurem to operate at the peak of its potential. While this set's bulky nature allows it to get past numerable Pokemon that would normally counter it, it still appreciates allies such as Terrakion, Heatran, Hitmontop, Conkeldurr, and Landorus-T to take out Steel-types and Tyranitar that generally give Kyurem trouble. Volcarona is also a great option as it can redirect dangerous Steel- and Fighting-type attacks via Rage Powder while easily dispatching Steel-types for Kyurem, though be aware that Rock Slide will be a big problem for the duo. Due to this set's high bulk and lack of Speed, it will heavily appreciate speed control, especially Tailwind and Thunder Wave. If you run either of these, Heracross makes for a great partner, as it synergizes wonderfully alongside Kyurem offensively and the duo can OHKO a lot of common threats, including but not limited to: Landorus-T, Cresselia, Thundurus, Tornadus, and Tyranitar. Rotom-W and Breloom make for nice partners as well because they can get past bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Jellicent, which this set has trouble with. Finally, thanks to this set's ability to lure in Dragon- or Fighting-types and remove them, partners that have trouble with the aforementioned Pokemon, such as Heatran and Rotom-W, will appreciate its support. Note you can only lure out either Dragon-types or Fighting-types depending on whether Kyurem opts to run Haban Berry or Chople Berry, respectively.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Kyurem-B is a monster in Doubles, which is to be expected from the Pokemon with the highest BST in the metagame. It is certainly intimidating on paper, with incredibly efficient 125 / 100 / 90 defensive stats alongside useful Electric- and Water-type resistances and a base 170 Attack. Unfortunately, there are numerous problems that make Kyurem-B difficult to build a team around and even more difficult to use properly. For starters, it has no physical Ice-type attacks bar the unreliable Freeze Shock, which means it has to fall back on its base 120 Special Attack when using Ice-type moves, which is only average at best. Then there is its double-edged Dragon / Ice typing, which in exchange for useful STAB on Ice- and Dragon-type moves leaves it weak to Steel-, Fighting-, Dragon-, and Rock-type attacks, all of which are common in the Doubles metagame. It also suffers from its base 95 Speed, which leaves it outsped by common threats such as Hydreigon, Latios, and Terrakion, making speed control required if you want non-Choice Scarf variants to see success. Finally, while its Attack is stellar, common abilities like Intimidate as well as burns will lower its offensive presence significantly. However, don't let these flaws discourage you from using Kyurem-B, as it can completely tear down opposing teams with the proper team support. For example, a common Defiant attacker such as Tornadus or Bisharp as a teammate can discourage Intimidate.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Berries that offer Kyurem-B some cushioning against its common weaknesses, such as Chople Berry and Haban Berry to soften Fighting-type and Dragon-type blows respectively, can be used to defeat some of its common checks, but these are very situational. A combination of Power Herb and Freeze Shock can allow Kyurem-B to run a completely physical set with a semi-reliable Ice STAB, but this lowers the power of its other moves. A Substitute set can be used to cushion Kyurem-B from blows and ease prediction; however, this strategy is not as effective in Doubles as compared to in singles.</p> <p>Kyurem-B has a wide movepool, which grants it access to other useful moves that are highly situational. Icy Wind is a good option in the Doubles metagame, performing as a useful mechanism for speed control that also receives a STAB boost. Focus Blast can be used as a coverage option; however, its shaky accuracy is undesirable and thus Earth Power is better suited to eliminate pesky Steel-types. Kyurem-B, with its massive bulk, has access to Light Screen and Reflect. Such as set can throw the opponent off-guard as compared to a common Dual Screens setter like Cresselia. Rest with a Chesto Berry can be used to give Kyurem-B another chance at life, giving it a second chance to sweep the opponent's team.</p> <p>There are some other gimmicky options that Kyurem-B can try, such as Blizzard spam with hail support, but this would be better performed by normal Kyurem. Kyurem-B has access to Imprison, which can mess up the opponent's strategy if any of their Pokemon happen to carry the same moves as Kyurem-B. Access to Sunny Day and Rain Dance can allow Kyurem-B to disrupt the opponent's weather strategy, especially if their weather setter has been defeated, but this moveslot can be put to better use.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Almost any Steel-type, such as Scizor, Metagross, and Excadrill, will be a nuisance. However, Kyurem-B is properly equipped to deal with Heatran with Earth Power. Fighting-types serve as good checks to Kyurem-B. These include Breloom, Hitmontop, Conkeldurr, and Terrakion. However, Terrakion needs to avoid the Choice Scarf set, and the others might have some trouble breaking through the bulky sets. Kyurem-B hates Intimidate and burns, as they decrease its offensive power. Landorus-T and Hitmontop are common Intimidate users that can decrease Kyurem-B's damage output, but Landorus-T must avoid Ice Beam. Faster Dragon-types can outspeed and KO Kyurem-B, but they need to have an opportunity to switch in before doing so and must avoid the Choice Scarf set. As a final note, Kyurem-B dislikes sand teams in general as it cannot endure too many Rock Slides.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set aims to use Choice Band to hit Pokemon really hard repeatedly. While that seems gimmicky, Kyurem's massive base 170 Attack stat means even Steel-types like Metagross will lose half their health to Outrage. In particular, Kyurem-B's Water-type resistance makes this set a threat to rain teams, especially when Kingdra and Steel-types are eliminated. Electric-type resistance and Ice-type neutrality make it a good check to Electric-types such as Thundurus and Rotom-W, but it must be wary of Thunder Wave and Will-o-Wisp, respectively. However, this set requires support to function at its best; Kyurem-B is vulnerable to many of the tier's best attackers, especially after an Outrage, and Intimidate turns its OHKOes and 2HKOes into 2HKOes and 3HKOes.</p> <p>Dragon Claw is usually the STAB move to click when unintimidated, especially when your opponent still has Steel- and Dragon-types. Fusion Bolt hits bulky Water-types, especially Jellicent, slightly harder than Outrage does and is more reliable. Outrage should generally be used only when the opponent's Steel-types or Kyurem-B checks have been eliminated, allowing Kyurem-B to dominate the playing field and deal massive damage to opponents. It can be used early game to destroy Intimidate or Steel-type switchins, but can easily lock you in to get revenge killed. Sleep Talk is rarely relevant, but if you can switch in your Kyurem-B on Spore, it is an excellent sleep absorber: immune to other statuses, able to switch out after Outrage, and activating Sleep Clause.</p> <p>Kyurem-B should run max Speed for the mirror and max Attack for more power. Jolly is acceptable, but Kyurem-B needs Adamant to, for example, OHKO bulky Thundurus with Dragon Claw or Hitmontop with -1 Outrage.</p> <p>Choice Band Kyurem-B enjoys teammates that can dispose of the Steel-types that give it trouble. These include partners such as Heatran, Terrakion, and Hitmontop, which have powerful offensive capabilities to match Kyurem-B. Kyurem-B also enjoys teammates such as Tornadus, Cresselia, and Shaymin-S that can deal with Fighting-types. This set in particular has an intense hatred towards Intimidate, so partners with Defiant such as Tornadus and Bisharp make for great allies. Finally, speed control from partners such as Thundurus and Cresselia will help Kyurem-B move first, which is key in allowing it to outspeed faster Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Latios.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Due to how vast the special side of Kyurem-B's movepool is, it is not hard to see why a mixed attacking set is one of the most popular choices for Kyurem-B. Dragon Claw establishes itself as the Dragon-type STAB move of choice, as it is far more reliable than its more powerful counterpart and deals heavy damage to the majority of the metagame, especially opposing Dragon-types. However, Outrage is certainly a plausible option, as while it will hit a random opponent, it has 50% more power than Dragon Claw, allowing it to achieve KOs that Dragon Claw cannot. Fusion Bolt cements itself in the second slot, standing out as a method to hit Steel-types harder than Dragon Claw and deal super effective damage to bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Jellicent. Earth Power is preferred in the third slot, as it allows Kyurem-B to OHKO troublesome Steel-types, particularly Heatran. Earth Power also lands 2HKOs on the majority of other Steel-types, including Excadrill and Metagross that aren't holding Shuca Berry. However, Ice Beam is an alternative choice for the third slot, as it can hit threats such as Landorus-T and Shaymin-S for OHKOs. Protect is the obvious choice for the final slot, guarding Kyurem-B from dangerous priority attacks such as Bullet Punch and Mach Punch while its partner on the field does some damage.</p> <p>The 44 Special Attack EVs allow Kyurem-B to always OHKO 252 HP Heatran and Excadrill with a Life Orb-boosted Earth Power. Meanwhile, 236 Speed EVs allow Kyurem-B to hit a nice Speed tier, outrunning Adamant Landorus-T and everything slower, including Jolly Breloom. If Kyurem-B uses Ice Beam instead of Earth Power, 20 Special Attack EVs can be used instead to guarantee the OHKO on 252 HP Landorus-T holding a Yache Berry. If for some reason you would like to run Kyurem-B on a Trick Room team, a Brave Nature with 236 HP EVs should be considered.</p> <p>Dragon Gem is an option over Life Orb to give Kyurem-B's Dragon-type STAB move more power. However, do take note that Kyurem-B cannot OHKO Heatran with Earth Power without the Life Orb boost, even if 252 Special Attack EVs are invested. Sitrus Berry is another option that can give Kyurem-B some extra bulk that turns many 2HKOs into 3HKOs, but Kyurem-B's large array of weaknesses and the fact that it will no longer achieve an OHKO on Heatran with Earth Power makes this choice heavily situational.</p> "

Dragon Claw is the Dragon-type STAB move of choice; with the extra Speed from Choice Scarf, Kyurem-B can reliably OHKO threats such as Latios granted it gets a safe switch-in. Ice Beam provides Ice-type STAB and can take down threats such as Landorus-T and Shaymin-S. Fusion Bolt hits Tornadus and bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Jellicent for heavy damage. Rock Slide is useful as a spread move that has a chance to flinch the opponents, while Earth Power provides necessary coverage against Steel-types that would otherwise laugh at this set's attempts to hurt them.</p> <p>The given Speed investment allows Choice Scarf Kyurem-B to outspeed positive-natured base 130s. Maximum Attack investment and the rest of the EVs dumped into Special Attack maximize its offensive power. Because this set works around so many common threats, almost any Pokemon appreciates Kyurem-B's support. However, there are definitely some teammates that can help Kyurem-B out a lot; Tornadus and Bisharp with Defiant can deter Intimidate users from reducing Kyurem-B's offensive capabilities. Partners that can deal with Steel-types, such as Heatran, Chandelure, and Hitmontop are also useful so that Kyurem-B doesn't have to lock itself into Earth Power.</p> <p>This set hates opposing speed control a lot, so Taunt support or partners that can take down common users of Icy Wind and Trick Room will be very helpful. Some examples include Bisharp and Volcarona, which also takes down common Trick Room setters. Kyurem-B itself can usually defeat Thunder Wave Thundurus and common Tailwind setters, so they aren't as much of an issue.</p> "

  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<p>Keldeo is known to be one of the best Water-types available in Gen 5 Doubles, with a very good base Speed of 108 and a great base Special Attack of 129. As such, it is commonly seen on rain teams, but its versatility allows it to function well even outside of rain. Keldeo has a shallow movepool, but it is enough to allow it to be a potent force in the Doubles metagame. Access to Icy Wind is useful for speed control in Doubles, while a powerful Fighting STAB move in Secret Sword quite makes up for it. Secret Sword's main appeal is that bulkier Pokemon usually invest in their Special Defense and are paired with Intimidate support to work around physical attackers. Secret Sword bypasses this strategy as it strikes at their weaker Defense but isn't softened by Intimidate. Thus, Keldeo can help rain teams by using its Fighting STAB move of choice to remove checks to common rain sweepers such as Tyranitar, Abomasnow, and Ferrothorn. Unfortunately, every Fighting-type can perform this role, so Keldeo faces competition from other Fighting-types, especially from the rain-loving Toxicroak. In addition, Keldeo stacks up weaknesses to Grass- and Electric-type attacks along with Politoed, which might be problematic in teambuilding. Nonetheless, Keldeo remains a more powerful wallbreaker, especially in rain.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Keldeo's shallow movepool means that it doesn't have any other coverage moves bar Hidden Power. Hidden Power Psychic can possibly be used to deal a bit of damage to Amoonguss and OHKO Toxicroak, but that will not be a good use of a moveslot. A Choice Set can be used; Choice Scarf nets some surprise kills while Choice Specs overwhelms special bulwarks, including Cresselia. Keldeo can also boost the power of its STAB moves with Calm Mind, which it can set up with Fake Out and/or Rage Powder support. Helping Hand is a great move to boost a teammate's damage output, but is better used by a bulkier teammate such as Togekiss. Keldeo can use Rain Dance to change the weather instantly without having to rely on Politoed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Keldeo hates Trick Room and Thunder Wave, so common users of these moves like Cresselia, Gyarados, and Thundurus cripple it. Slowking is a threat that lurks on many Trick Room teams, resists both of Keldeo's STABs, and can retaliate with a super effective Psychic. Amoonguss is also a common threat, and its Rage Powder can stop Keldeo from doing anything useful to Amoonguss's partner, which sets it apart from the other counters. However, this is rendered ineffective if Keldeo runs Taunt.</p> <p>Shaymin-S is a dangerous check to Keldeo, and can be a full-blown counter if Keldeo isn't carrying Icy Wind. Kingdra and Ludicolo both outspeed Keldeo in rain due to Swift Swim and deal heavy damage to it. Keldeo's checks include faster Psychic-types such as Deoxys-A, Latios, and Latias; and Electric-types such as Thundurus formes, Rotom-W, and Zapdos, which can all hurt Keldeo pretty badly but cannot switch in safely. Jellicent is also a good counter to Keldeo, having a useful niche in being a Trick Room setter that is immune to Fake Out and strong Fighting- and Water-type moves. Celebi also shares the trait of resisting both of Keldeo's STABs, but it is not commonly seen in Doubles.</p> ",

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This set permits Keldeo to switch moves and deal damage with the appropriate STAB. Hydro Pump is a powerful STAB move that can punch holes in the opponent's team after being boosted by Life Orb and usually rain. Secret Sword is a great Fighting STAB move that strikes the enemy's Defense rather than their Special Defense, which nails rain checks Tyranitar, Abomasnow, Ferrothorn, and Kyurem, as well as Kyurem-B. Protect is a staple in Doubles for general scouting and defensive strategies. Life Orb and Expert Belt are the item options for this set. Life Orb gives significant boost in power but cuts 10% of Keldeo's health each time, while Expert Belt can be used if the user dislikes the recoil.</p> <p>Icy Wind is awesome in Doubles, hitting both opponents with fair coverage and also slowing both of them down, which is helpful for a slower teammate to break walls. However, its low Base Power means that it cannot even OHKO the Landorus formes with certainty. Taunt is useful to shut down status users like Thundurus and setup sweepers, disrupting their strategy for the match. A notable example is Amoonguss, which is extremely irritating due to Spore and Rage Powder. Furthermore, Taunt is also extremely useful for shutting down Trick Room teams, which are detrimental to Keldeo's quick playstyle. Hidden Power Grass is great for shutting down Water-types and especially Gastrodon, a major threat to rain teams in general. It is also useful against Jellicent, which is a prominent counter to Keldeo.</p> <p>Surf can be a good option for hitting both opponents, and wrecks enemies especially in rain. However, it also attacks the partner so care must be taken to select good teammates, for example to use Protect on the turn that Surf is used or have abilities that benefit from it, such as Water Absorb or Storm Drain. Several different moves can replace Icy Wind's slot in order to suit the team's needs. Hidden Power Electric can be used to deal damage to Water-types and also take down Gyarados. Substitute can be used to help Keldeo ease prediction and block status moves. Quick Guard can be used to protect Keldeo and its partner from priority moves, notably Fake Out and Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Politoed is a great teammate for rain support, allowing Hydro Pump or Surf to be extremely painful. Pokemon that are immune to Water-type attacks are extremely good partners if Keldeo is using Surf: these include Gastrodon and Toxicroak, which also happen to function well on rain teams. Gastrodon also happens to be one of the best partners for Keldeo, as Storm Drain allows it to boost its Special Attack each time it is hit by a Water-type move, allowing it to hurt enemies even more. Furthermore, it also has decent synergy with Keldeo, as it can take Electric-type moves, such as Discharge, while Keldeo resists Blizzard; both of them resist Rock Slide. Keldeo also pairs well with either of the top two Swift Swim sweepers, Kingdra and Ludicolo, as they each eliminate the other's checks. Kingdra can help eliminate Latias and Latios while Keldeo can remove Ferrothorn to assist Kingdra. Ludicolo eliminates bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Rotom-W while Keldeo removes Ferrothorn, Kyurem, and Kyurem-B.</p> <p>Keldeo also pairs well with Latios, as Latios deals with most of the bulky Grass-, Electric-, and Water-types that hinder Keldeo, while Keldeo threatens Tyranitar and Steel-types that can tank Latios's powerful STAB moves. Choice Scarf Tyranitar deserves a special mention as a great partner for Keldeo, despite being incompatible with rain. The two have tremendous offensive synergy, as Choice Scarf Tyranitar can outrun and take out the likes of Latios, Tornadus, Thundurus, Salamence, and Jellicent, against which Keldeo struggles.</p> "

  "Genesect": {
    "overview": "<p>Genesect's decent base Speed stat allows it to outrun a plethora of major threats in the Doubles metagame. Genesect also has great attacking stats, letting it take on the role of a physical or special attacker and making it easy to fit on teams. Its BoltBeam coverage is stellar, and its attacking prowess can be boosted significantly by a favorable Download boost. It also has access to STAB U-turn, which allows it to scout out the enemy team and makes it a potent Choice Scarf user. Its typing leaves it with only one weakness, albeit a large one, but unfortunately, its bulk leaves it unable to fully take advantage of it. Genesect fears paralysis and is dead weight in Trick Room, so it needs teammates that can cover those weaknesses.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Genesect can run a powerful Choice Band or physical Life Orb set, which has the power to OHKO every weather starter in the metagame with either Explosion or U-turn; it also has decent coverage with Blaze Kick to KO Steel-types and has revenge killing potential with ExtremeSpeed. A Focus Sash might allow Genesect to grab a few surprise KOs, and Genesect's immunity to sandstorm makes Focus Sash a more reliable item, but other items are generally better. Genesect can run an Occa Berry, but it still won't be able to survive most powerful Fire-type attacks used in the tier. Bug Gem is also an option for allowing Genesect to do major damage to Cresselia and Tyranitar without restricting its move selection, but Choice Band is generally the better item choice if you want extra power. Rock Polish is available, but Genesect doesn't quite have the bulk to pull it off in Doubles. Sitrus Berry is nice for longevity, but it is generally worse than more offensive items such as Expert Belt.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fire-type Pokemon, such as Heatran, Volcarona, Chandelure, and Ninetales, do not fear Genesect at all and can easily exploit its 4x weakness to Fire-type moves without taking much damage from its attacks. Excadrill in sand and Kingdra in rain are also big threats, as their powerful moves will deal a lot of damage to Genesect. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp also threaten Genesect with powerful spread moves such as Earthquake, though it is worth noting that Choice Scarf Genesect can beat Landorus-T with Ice Beam. Genesect can't really do much to Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Kyurem-B, either of which can strike back and take a serious chunk out of its health.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set makes use of Genesect's BoltBeam coverage to hit almost everything for at least neutral damage and many Pokemon super effectively. U-turn is great for scouting the opponent's team and is an option for when Genesect gets an Attack boost from Download. It also hits common Pokemon such as Tyranitar in sandstorm for more damage than Bug Buzz, which is still a viable alternative if you want a special STAB that is unaffected by Intimidate. Thunder is the better choice for rain teams and can OHKO 252/0 Politoed, provided Genesect has a Special Attack boost from Download; however, it is risky if rain is not up. Ice Beam deals with Dragons-types and other Pokemon 4x weak to it, such as Landorus-T, allowing Genesect to outspeed and KO them. Protect is standard for prediction and can keep Genesect safe while its counters are removed. Flamethrower is an option over Protect to increase Genesect's coverage but means Genesect is even more threatened by its checks and counters, and will be forced to switch out more often.</p> <p>With a favorable Download boost, Genesect can easily defeat a lot of Pokemon with not-so-stellar defenses; however, anything with decent bulk can force it out. Genesect also hates Trick Room, as it works against Genesect's Speed. Pokemon with moves such as Taunt to stop the enemy from using Trick Room can be good partners. This set really benefits from Tailwind support as it helps Genesect take on faster opponents and also lets it U-turn out into a Tailwind setter to keep momentum. Genesect partners well with Chandelure and Heatran, as they make opponents think twice about using Fire-type attacks. Genesect takes no damage from sandstorm, meaning it is easy to fit onto a sandstorm team. Giga Drain can be used to take down Gastrodon if it is an issue. Blizzard is viable, especially in hail, as it really packs a punch and can deal major damage. A Focus Sash can secure a few surprise KOs, but Expert Belt and Life Orb are generally better. Expert Belt is the preferred choice for most teams as it helps Genesect get a number of significant KOs with no drawbacks. Genesect can also use a Life Orb to increase its damage output, but it means that Genesect is worn down much faster.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Genesect is one of the premier Choice Scarf users in the tier thanks to its good Speed stat and ability to beat other common Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T with its Download-boosted attacks. BoltBeam coverage means that only a select few Pokemon resist Genesect's coverage. U-turn makes Genesect an excellent scout. It also allows it to dent Pokemon such as Cresselia and Tyranitar, and provides an answer to Reuniclus, one of the most popular Trick Room setters. With a beneficial Download boost, U-turn OHKOes both Latios and Latias, thus taking a major threat out of the game. Thunder will OHKO max HP Politoed 75% of the time, making it the better option for a rain team; however, Thunderbolt still packs quite a punch. The last slot depends on your team. Flamethrower provides more coverage but is worse on rain teams, on the one hand while Bug Buzz gives Genesect a special STAB move in case you don't want it to switch out. Explosion is great late-game, and can help deal with things your team might struggle with. Genesect must always be wary of getting predicted and locked into a bad move, as it doesn't have much bulk to rely on. Make sure you scout out the enemy's Choice Scarf users before being too reckless with Genesect due to this frailty. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Genesect hates dealing with sun teams, as it can't do much damage to many of their major threats.</p> <p>The given EV Spread allows Genesect to outspeed everything up to and including Deoxys-A (with 236 Speed EVs). The extra EVs in Attack allows Genesect to 2HKO Cresselia provided it receives an attack boost from Download. Giga Drain can be used in the last slot if your team has trouble dealing with the commonly seen Gastrodon. Genesect benefits greatly from a Pokemon that resists Fire-type attacks, such as Tyranitar; Genesect's immunity to sandstorm makes Tyranitar an even better partner. Chandelure also works as a great partner, as it can also get a boost from Fire-type attacks directed at Genesect.</p> "
