        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Hitmontop offers Intimidate combined with the rare access to Fake Out and Wide Guard. On top of this, Hitmontop has other support moves at its disposal, including Feint and Helping Hand. These moves, alongside better offensive pressure, separate Hitmontop from Scrafty. Hitmontop, however, is balanced by a mediocre Attack stat, susceptibility to Intimidate, reliance on Close Combat for damage, and low offensive pressure in the face of the metagame's most common Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Close Combat is Hitmontop's strongest STAB attack, allowing it to OHKO Excadrill and non-Chople Berry Tyranitar. Hitmontop mitigates its inability to damage bulky foes such as Jellicent and Cresselia with Toxic, which puts them on a timer and eventually forces them off the field. Helping Hand also mitigates Hitmontop's lack of offensive pressure by boosting the power of Hitmontop's teammate. Feint allows Hitmontop's teammate to pick up a crucial KO by preventing a foe from blocking incoming attacks with Protect. Wide Guard blocks powerful spread attacks such as Excadrill and Landorus-T's Earthquake, Kingdra's Muddy Water, and Heatran's Heat Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fighting Gem is the item of choice, allowing Hitmontop to secure the OHKO on Chople Berry Tyranitar, Heatran, and Kyurem-B. Fighting Gem also gives Hitmontop respectable damage output even against Fighting-resistant foes. Sitrus Berry is an option to increase its longevity, but it is typically not recommended due to Hitmontop's already low offensive presence.</p> </li> <li> <p>This EV spread outspeeds standard Heatran while maximizing Attack, with the remaining EVs dumped into HP to boost Hitmontop's overall bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hitmontop prefers to switch in and out frequently to reset Fake Out and Wide Guard while cycling Intimidate.</p> </li> <li> <p>As many teams can benefit from Intimidate and Fake Out, Hitmontop can easily fit on teams with minimal direct support. That said, Hitmontop shines best on teams with set up Pokemon, such as Volcarona and Suicune, as the free turn generated through Fake Out allows them to setup easier. Heatran is another excellent teammate, as it benefits greatly from Fake Out. Additionally, Hitmontop can threaten opposing Heatran and Tyranitar and block Earthquake and Muddy Water with Wide Guard. Latios and Thundurus are two Pokemon that benefit from Intimidate, effectively increasing their physical bulk, and Hitmontop's good matchup into Tyranitar and Steel-types.</p> </li> </ul>"

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>Togekiss is one of the best support Pokemon in the Doubles metagame. It has one of the largest array of support moves in its arsenal, including the unique combination of Follow Me and Tailwind. Togekiss's bulk is awesome, and it happens to be one of the most specially bulky users of Follow Me and Rage Powder. It's no slouch in the offensive department either, with a whopping base 120 Special Attack. Its typing is queer, having the ability to evade the common Earthquake. However, this renders it vulnerable to other common moves such as Blizzard and Rock Slide. Nonetheless, Togekiss is an extremely versatile Pokemon and should definitely be considered for a slot on your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Roost is a great option to heal yourself when necessary. Body Slam is also a great option for spreading paralysis as it bypasses Taunt. Togekiss can also run an interesting support set with dual screens, but is outclassed by Pokemon such as Cresselia in this regard. Tri Attack is usable for spreading debilitating status effects onto your opponent. Hyper Voice is Togekiss's strongest spread move and benefits from STAB, but its poor coverage is disappointing. ExtremeSpeed can catch opponents off guard, but has a poor damage output and thus is a waste of a moveslot. After You is an interesting option for speeding up your team, but has major limitations that prevent it from being effective. Togekiss can also function as a weather inducer with Sunny Day or Rain Dance, but the above sets are better. Togekiss also has other interesting moves such as Magic Coat, Encore, and Safeguard, but these function on a case-by-case basis.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Togekiss is weak to Blizzard and Discharge, and due to these moves being common in Doubles, Togekiss might have trouble finding turns to set up. Blizzard users include Abomasnow, Kyurem, and Rotom-F, while Discharge users include Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Thundurus. Taunt users that outspeed Togekiss, including Prankster users, can prevent Togekiss from using its support moves and render it helpless, barring the moderately powerful Air Slash. Rock Slide is also a threat to Togekiss, and thus it has to beware of users such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Excadrill. Togekiss, like any other Tailwind user, is quite vulnerable to Trick Room, and thus steps should be taken to prevent it from being set on the field.</p> <p>Common Electric Pokemon such as Zapdos are thorns in Togekiss's side, but might not necessarily OHKO it, allowing Togekiss to unleash a Tailwind or Thunder Wave before death. Rain-boosted Swift Swim users such as Kabutops can also outspeed Togekiss and deal heavy damage, and Sand Rush-boosted Excadrill can do the same. Steel-types are checks to Togekiss as they can handle Air Slash with ease, but are usually unable to stop Togekiss from playing its support role.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tailwind Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set invests in bulk in order to maximize sustainability for Togekiss, permitting it to set up multiple Tailwinds throughout the match. Tailwind is an obvious option to double the Speed of all your teammates for three turns, granting a tactical advantage that has been the staple of many Doubles cores. Air Slash is an option to deal with slower and bulkier threats, such as Cresselia, while your sweepers wreak havoc on the other opponent. It also boasts a 60% chance to flinch opponents, rendering them motionless for that turn. Follow Me is a great option to grant setup opportunities for your teammate, as it lures all the opponents' attacks onto Togekiss's giant bulk and keeps your teammate safe. Protect is a classic option in Doubles to defend Togekiss from attacks, possibly leaving your teammate free to attack the opponent or to shield it from multi-hit moves. Helping Hand is a wonderful option to grant a 50% power boost to your teammate, allowing it to deliver powerful blows to the opponents.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Togekiss to outspeed Cresselia, minimum Speed Rotom-W, and some faster Hitmontop variants. 248 HP EVs are used so Togekiss can attain an odd HP number to receive less damage from hail and sandstorm. The rest of the EVs are put into its already stellar Special Defense as an extra boost. 176 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed maximum Speed neutral base 70s, specifically Hitmontop and Ludicolo. 16 Defense EVs can be given to allow Togekiss to survive a Choice Band- or Helping Hand-boosted Rock Slide from Tyranitar. A Sitrus Berry is given instead of Leftovers as it is more useful in sand and hail, being able to restore 25% of Togekiss's health instead of being nullified by weather. Additionally, it is more helpful in allowing Togekiss to tank two attacks in a turn.</p> <p>Togekiss usually aids teammates instead of having teammates aid it; it works well with powerful teammates with middling Speed such as Kyurem-B, Hydreigon, Breloom, Metagross, and more. Mold Breaker Excadrill is a great partner for Togekiss, with Follow Me to allow a Swords Dance boost; it can also use Earthquake freely, as Togekiss is immune to Ground-type attacks. Hitmontop is also a good partner thanks to Intimidate, helping to cover Togekiss's weaker Defense while providing Wide Guard support to protect Togekiss from Blizzards, Rock Slides and Discharges. Heracross and Mamoswine are also decent partners, having good synergy with Togekiss and appreciating Tailwind support. Heracross can defeat the Rock- and Ice-types that threaten Togekiss, while Mamoswine handles Electric- and Ice-types. Landorus-T can also be used, but has to beware of Blizzard.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Paralyzer": {
        "description": "<p>This Togekiss set works wonderfully on bulky offense teams due to its ability to Thunder Wave a majority of the opponents and slow them down for your sweepers. Air Slash is a great move in combination with Thunder Wave, granting the paraflinch combo. Not to mention Togekiss also has Serene Grace, being able to double the rate of flinching from Air Slash and therefore being able to keep the opponent immobile for longer. Follow Me is Togekiss's advantage over other Thunder Wave users such as Thundurusâ€”the ability to lure attacks aimed at your partner and tank them with great special bulk is a huge selling point. Protect, as usual, is to defend Togekiss from attacks that are aimed at it. Helping Hand is a great move to give your partner a 50% power boost, allowing it to annihilate the already paralyzed opponents.</p> <p>The EVs are specially tailored to allow Togekiss to survive a multitude of powerful attacks, namely Rock Gem Terrakion's Rock Slide, Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor, Thundurus's Thunderbolt, and Choice Specs Rotom-W's Thunderbolt. The HP EVs are given an odd number in order to reduce damage taken from sandstorm and hail. A Sitrus Berry is used to grant greater longevity, helping Togekiss take two attacks in one turn and is overall more useful than Leftovers in this metagame.</p> <p>Togekiss works great with bulky offensive Pokemon that benefit from opponents getting paralyzed, allowing them to go first and wreak havoc. These Pokemon include Metagross, Landorus-T, Heatran, and Kyurem-B. Hitmontop is once again a good partner with Intimidate to cover Togekiss's weaker Defense and can also use Wide Guard to protect Togekiss from the likes of Rock Slide, Blizzard, and Discharge.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Tailwind": {
        "description": "<p>Togekiss isn't only meant to function defensively; it can also go offensive thanks to its useful base 120 Special Attack. Tailwind is on the set in order to increase the Speed of the whole team, while Air Slash is for a reliable STAB and helpful flinches. Heat Wave is a good Fire-type move that can hit both opponents for decent damage and has a nice 30% chance to burn them. Aura Sphere is another reliable option to induce solid Fighting-type damage onto the opponent. Protect is useful in this instance to stall out Trick Room turns, while Helping Hand is good for boosting allies, especially when Togekiss's coverage is ineffective in that particular situation.</p> <p>208 HP EVs are used to give Togekiss an odd HP number to reduce damage from sandstorm and hail. 48 Speed EVs are given to allow Togekiss to outspeed 4 Speed base 85s, most notably Cresselia. Sitrus Berry is given to grant Togekiss greater longevity and to take more hits, while Flying Gem can give Togekiss a cool one-time damage boost. Fire Blast or Flamethrower can be used instead of Heat Wave for greater damage on individual opponents.</p> <p>Good teammates should have good coverage in tandem with Togekiss so they can take out bulkier opponents such as Cresselia. Tyranitar and Chandelure are good choices in this regard, and also benefit from Tailwind. Mamoswine and Heracross are also good partnersâ€”Mamoswine has good coverage and enjoys the flinches that Togekiss deals onto the opponent, while Heracross enjoys the Helping Hand support which permits it to OHKO Cresselia, and also beats the Ice- and Rock-types that trouble Togekiss. Hitmontop's Intimidate comes in handy to cover up Togekiss's weaker Defense, and its Wide Guard support grants protection against Blizzard, Rock Slide, and Discharge.</p>"

      "Shadow Tag Support": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Gothitelle is the only Pokemon with Shadow Tag, giving it a unique niche in the metagame. Gothitelle excels at trapping passive Pokemon, such as Jellicent and Amoonguss, shutting them down with Taunt and effectively turning the fight into a two-on-one. That said, Gothitelle can oftentimes find itself being a liability due to its passiveness and poor damage output. Additionally, trapping is not as powerful against more offensive teams, as they can ignore Gothitelle and focus down on its teammate. Finally, the lack of reliable setup sweepers in the tier means that Gothitelle's trapping oftentimes only results in a one for one trade, which might not outweigh Gothitelle's passiveness.</p> </li> <li> <p>Taunt is necessary to shut down other passive support Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Jellicent, forcing them to use their weak attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Trick Room is a strong speed control option, enabling Gothitelle's teammate or itself to beat opposing speed control. Helping Hand boosts the power of Gothitelle's teammate, mitigating Gothitelle's low damage output. Skill Swap can be used to give a teammate Shadow Tag, take away crucial abilities from the foe, such as Prankster from Thundurus, or reset abilities so they can be activated again, such as Intimidate. Giving a teammate Shadow Tag also allows Gothitelle to switch out to a more offensive teammate, mitigating its lackluster damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Calm nature ensures that Gothitelle survives a Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor with the rest dumped into Defense so that it can better tank strong physical attacks, such as Tyranitar's Crunch.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gothitelle is best when trapping support Pokemon, so foes must be wary that Gothitelle can hard switch into them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Setup Pokemon, such as Suicune and Ferrothorn, are great teammates alongside Gothitelle because it can prevent the foe from switching from an unfavorable matchup, allowing its teammate to freely set up. Rain teams benefit greatly from Gothitelle's trapping because it can shut down Amoonguss and Jellicent, two common rain answers, allowing its teammate to remove them thus opening the door for Kingdra to sweep. Landorus-T is another excellent teammate, as U-turn allows Gothitelle to be brought in safely. Additionally, Gothitelle can use Skill Swap on Landorus-T, reactivating Intimidate and further weakening the opposing physical attackers. Finally, Pokemon with strong attacks, such as Dragon Gem Latios and Choice Band Kyurem-B, can benefit from Shadow Tag, allowing it to take out a crucial target.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other set options include Trick with Choice Scarf or Choice Specs. The idea is similar in that Gothitelle aims to shut down a passive support Pokemon by giving it a Choice item with Trick while trapping it but is typically less consistent due to Gothitelle needing to Trick away its item before it is able to support its teammate.</p> </li> </ul>"

  "Volcarona": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcarona has one of the best offensive typings in the Doubles metagame. Its STAB attacks hit everything from Cresselia to Bisharp for super effective damage, and it even gains useful resistances to Ice- and Fighting-type moves. To make life even better, it has a massive Special Attack stat, alongside a solid base Speed. It even gets additional support options in Tailwind and Rage Powder. To top it all off, it is one of the few Pokemon capable of making use of setup moves in Doubles, which it does through Quiver Dance.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even a fire-spewing moth has its faults. It is held back in that it has a mediocre Defense and a 4x weakness to Rock-type moves, leaving it susceptible to Rock Slide. Furthermore, a Water weakness leaves it begging for mercy against the majority of rain teams. It also has little coverage outside of its STABs. Fortunately, this rare species of \"Volcano Moth\" is far from extinct, as its lethal STAB combination is capable of taking down many common Doubles threats, including Cresselia, Breloom, Scizor, Hydreigon, and others.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fire Blast and Fiery Dance can be alternate Fire STABs, as they pack more power than Heat Wave at the cost of only being able to hit one target at a time and do not have a Special Attack drop like Overheat. Hidden Power Ground can achieve coverage against Heatran and anything else Volcarona struggles to hit; however, it is lacking in power and requires giving up a moveslot. Hurricane and Psychic can be used, taking out Hitmontop and other Fighting-types, but they are generally inferior to a Fire Gem boosted Overheat, which deals more damage. Giga Drain damages Politoed and can heal Volcarona, extending its longevity. Magnet Rise can surprise the opposition with a Ground-type immunity, but it is generally outclassed by Volcarona's support options in Tailwind and Rage Powder. Finally, Sunny Day can be used to mess with weather and buff Volcarona's Fire-type STAB to incredibly powerful levels, and SolarBeam can be used alongside it, hitting Rock- and Water-type Pokemon for heavy damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Heatran is more or less the ultimate Volcarona counter; bar the rare Hidden Power Ground, it walls every Volcarona in and out offensively. Heatran can easily hammer Volcarona back with Heat Wave, and Substitute Heatran can set up in Volcarona's face, making it even more difficult to take down. Chandelure is also a wonderful counter to Volcarona and can do what Heatran does by walling it and hammering it with repeated Heat Waves or setting Trick Room without fear of Volcarona's attacks.</p> <p>Faster physical attackers, such as Terrakion, Landorus, Excadrill, and Garchomp, can move first and OHKO Volcarona with Rock Slide. Volcarona can do little back to most of these, but if it has a Quiver Dance up, it can outspeed and deal heavy damage, so be cautious. Excadrill gets a special mention, as Volcarona will need two Quiver Dance boosts to beat it. One rare potential check is Stone Edge Hitmontop, which could trick Volcarona into thinking it is not an offensive problem. It is utterly destroyed by a Fire Gem Overheat though, so it needs to be played with caution. Rain in general will also give Volcarona trouble. Swift Swim Pokemon, particularly Kabutops and Kingdra, can run right through it with their respective STABs and can tank an unboosted Bug Buzz. Volcarona additionally hates opposing speed control; in particular, Thunder Wave and Trick Room will cripple it. Once it is slowed, a variety of slow threats can pick it off.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rage Powder": {
        "description": "<p>Despite its lower bulk, Rage Powder Volcarona has some good matchups as a pure redirector over Amoonguss. Most notably, it can outspeed and redirect Hitmontop's Fake Out, even having a 30% chance to burn with Flame Body. It also forces Latios to Draco Meteor, isn't Taunt bait in front of Thundurus, and safely redirects Substitute Kyurem-B, Scizor, Cresselia, and Conkeldurr. However it is destroyed by rain teams, and Stealth Rock often forces it to be kind of a suicide lead.</p> <p>Overheat OHKOes most Fire-weak Pokemon even without investment such as Metagross and does solid damage to frail neutral targets. Tailwind is a good greed option, but Bug Buzz is safer for solid damage against Water-types, Latios, and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Sitrus Berry gives Volcarona extra longevity. The EV spread outspeeds Hitmontop and survives Latios's Gem Draco Meteor while maximizing physical bulk for redirecting Fighting- and Steel-types. Volcarona needs Modest nature and near maximum investment to OHKO Amoonguss with Overheat, which generally isn't worth it, but could be. You can also run 252 SpA with Modest Fire Gem for a solid chance to OHKO Thundurus with Overheat, but the loss of bulk will be even more notable.</p> <p>This set pairs well with fast and heavy-hitting Pokemon that have good defensive synergy with Volcarona such as Latios, as Volcarona draws in attacks and paralysis, allowing its teammates to live longer. Anything that can get past Heatran, such as Garchomp, Landorus, Breloom, and Gastrodon, is also very helpful, as Volcarona has a lot of trouble with it.</p>"
      },
      "Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Volcarona is one of the few Pokemon that can successfully utilize setup moves in Doubles. After a Quiver Dance, it can rip through entire teams, as its STAB attacks get great coverage. Heat Wave provides a spread move and is lethal after a Quiver Dance boost. Bug Buzz is Volcarona's most powerful secondary STAB, dealing heavy damage to threats like Hydreigon and Cresselia. Protect allows Volcarona to evade dangerous attacks while your partner handles things.</p> <p>Modest Life Orb is needed to OHKO Tyranitar and Cresselia with +1 Bug Buzz and Landorus-T with +1 Heat Wave, so that's generally the best item to avoid a revenge kill. Lum Berry allows Volcarona to avoid being crippled by paralysis, especially from Thundurus, but since Volcarona does not OHKO at +1 anyway, Lum Berry is not a matchup on its own. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Hydreigon at +0 and Jolly Scarf Landorus-T at +1 but Heat Wave becomes a shaky roll to OHKO Landorus-T. A bulkier spread using a Bold nature can be used, as it allows Volcarona to tank more hits, though the standard spread is generally better as it does not require a Quiver Dance to deal heavy damage.</p> <p>Good teammates for this set include Rage Powder and Fake Out users, such as Amoonguss and Hitmontop, which make setting up easier. Hitmontop is also capable of guarding Volcarona from dangerous spread attacks such as Muddy Water and Rock Slide with Wide Guard. Anything that can take out Heatran, such as Garchomp and Rotom-W, also makes a good partner. Fast Pokemon such as Latios also help against other fast Pokemon packing Rock Slide, such as Garchomp and Terrakion. Weavile, in particular, is good alongside this set, as it has high Speed, can provide Fake Out support, and can nail a lot of counters, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Garchomp for heavy damage; watch out for Tyranitar with Chople Berry, though, because it can tank a Low Kick and get a double KO with Rock Slide. Breloom and Virizion can also make solid partners, using STAB moves to take out Rock-types and bulky Water-types, both of which give Volcarona trouble, along with archetypal rain and sand teams in general. Breloom can also help shut down troublesome threats with Spore.</p>"

Additionally, Suicune's good defensive typing and excellent bulk make it difficult to take down after just one Calm Mind. That said, Suicune is held back by its reliance on Calm Mind, oftentimes doing little if it isn't able to set up. As a result, teams with Suicune are built to exploit certain matchups, making it a harder fit for most teams unlike Jellicent, which offers immediate utility on top of also being a solid defensive wincon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scald is Suicune's most reliable STAB attack, with the potential burn effect facilitating further setup opportunities against physical attackers like Tyranitar and Conkeldurr. Substitute blocks Toxic and allows Suicune to set up easier, since weak neutral attacks, such as Tyranitar's Rock Slide, do not break Suicune's Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leftovers is the preferred item, since Suicune prefers staying on the field for many subsequent turns, therefore benefiting more from the passive healing.</p> </li> <li> <p>The EV spread ensures that Life Orb Kingdra's Muddy Water in rain does not break Substitute, with the rest dumped into Defense to allow Suicune to better tank strong physical attacks such as Choice Band Kyurem-B's Fusion Bolt.</p> </li> <li> <p>Suicune needs Calm Mind to be effective, so its teammate should focus on removing foes that can deter setup, such as Thundurus and Choice Band Kyurem-B, or Pokemon that wall Suicune, such as Water Absorb Jellicent. Many of the attacks that hit Suicune for massive damage are burst options like Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor. Forcing the opponent to use their boosted attacks on a different Pokemon lets Suicune set up easier in future turns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intimidate users are mandatory next to Suicune, as its effect increases Suicune's bulk and makes it more difficult for foes to take out. Notably, -1 Landorus-T and Tyranitar do not break Substitute with Earthquake and Crunch, respectively. Landorus-T, therefore, is an excellent teammate, capable of weakening physical attackers with Intimidate, threatening Thundurus, and pivoting into Suicune with U-turn for a good setup opportunity. Hitmontop is another good Intimidate user that can facilitate setup opportunities with Fake Out. Heatran beats Grass-types, such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn, that can deter setup. Gothitelle excels at trapping slower support Pokemon such as Jellicent and Amoonguss, allowing its partner to eliminate them and opening the door for Suicune to win or facilitating further setup opportunities for Suicune by locking the opponent in an unfavorable position.</p> </li> </ul>"

With the lack of abundant Fire-resistant Pokemon, Heatran oftentimes can exert immense offensive pressure with its Heat Wave by forcing Protect and switches, allowing it to generate free opportunities to set up Substitute.</li> <li>Heatran benefits greatly from Thundurus. In addition to Thundurus checking Water-types, its Prankster Thunder Wave can allow Heatran to outspeed threats, such as Latios, and set up Substitute while fishing for a full paralysis. Tyranitar is another excellent teammate due to its ability to check opposing Heatran, Thundurus; which can stop Heatran's Substitute with Taunt; Latios, and Cresselia. Heatran's Substitute can also stall for extra turns, allowing the sand damage to add up on the opposing team while Heatran recovers HP through Leftovers, thanks to its Steel typing.

This allows it to be played more aggressively to take advantage of the small number of Fire-resistant Pokemon in the metagame.</li> <li>Shuca Berry allows Heatran to tank a Ground-type attack that would otherwise OHKO it, notably improving the matchup against Latios and opposing Heatran. Earth Power is mainly to hit opposing Heatran super effectively. Flash Cannon is a second STAB attack that does better damage against Kyurem-B, Latios, and Tyranitar. Heatran can opt for more Speed if necessary. For example, 84 Speed EVs allow it to outrun Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T under Tailwind.</li> <li>Generally, this set likes to take advantage of Heatran's typing to generate free attacking opportunities by safely switching into resisted attacks. For example, Heatran counters the common Steel-types, such as Metagross and Genesect, so it can be played aggressively by switching directly into them, giving Heatran a free Heat Wave chance.</li> <li>Similarly to Substitute Heatran, Shuca Berry Heatran benefits greatly from Thundurus due to its speed control with Prankster Thunder Wave and its ability to check Water-types, such as Jellicent. Latios and Cresselia are also excellent teammates, as they can threaten Fighting-types, Landorus-T, and opposing Heatran while also having access to speed control. Since this set is worse against rain, Heatran appreciates teammates that can deter Kingdra, such as Jellicent. Finally, Tyranitar benefits from Heatran's ability to remove Steel-types and Amoonguss, and it can deter rain with Sand Stream and threaten opposing Jellicent, Latios, Cresselia, and Heatran.</li> <li>On dedicated Trick Room teams, Heatran can be used as a strong wallbreaker with an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA, a Quiet nature, 0 Speed IVs, Fire Gem or Charcoal for the item, and a moveset of Eruption, Earth Power, Heat Wave, and Protect.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Sporting incredible bulk, a Ground immunity, and a serviceable defensive typing, Cresselia is able to tank strong hits even without investment. Cresselia uses its bulk, many speed control options, and supporting moves to assist its teammates. Although it has a rather weak Special Attack stat, this is partially mitigated by access to a reliable combination of moves with which it hits many of the top threats in the metagame super effectively. All in all, Cresselia is a threat if left alone and is a Pokemon that all teams must have an answer to.</p> </li> <li> <p>Psychic is a STAB attack that can 2HKO Amoonguss, Conkeldurr, and Hitmontop.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ice Beam is used to hit common Ice-weak foes, such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Latios, super effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hidden Power Ground hits Steel-types, notably Heatran and Metagross, that resist Cresselia's other moves super effectively. Hidden Power Fire is used on teams that wish to improve their matchup against Scizor, Genesect, and Ferrothorn.</p> </li> <li> <p>The last moveslot is typically reserved for a speed control option, although the choice depends on the team. Thunder Wave is the most reliable, as its speed control benefits every type of team. Trick Room is an excellent option for teams with many slow Pokemon, such as Heatran, Conkeldurr, and Tyranitar. Trick Room can also be used to reset opposing Trick Room, ensuring Cresselia and its teammates keep the upper hand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Expert Belt takes advantage of Cresselia's ability to hit common metagame threats super effectively by boosting the power of these hits without any drawbacks. Notably, it allows Cresselia to 2HKO Latios and Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p>The spread maximizes Cresselia's damage output, with a Timid nature ensuring that it outspeeds unboosted Adamant Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cresselia's main role is to take heavy attacks and threaten a super effective hit on many of the top Pokemon in the tier. Keep in mind that Cresselia's damage output is rather poor and can have trouble OHKOing even with super effective moves, so most of the time, it will be weakening the Pokemon for its partner to clean up later. Cresselia's bulk allows it to tank many hits so it can be kept on the field longer to scare off these threats from coming in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cresselia is great on sand teams because it threatens common sand answers like Landorus-T and Conkeldurr, has Levitate, allowing Excadrill to freely use Earthquake, and has access to speed control for Tyranitar. In return, Tyranitar can beat Jellicent and opposing Cresselia, which shrug off any of Cresselia's attacks, and Excadrill beats opposing Tyranitar. Landorus-T is another excellent teammate, as it also threatens Tyranitar and can freely use Earthquake, and Intimidate allows Cresselia to better tank physical attacks. Heatran benefits from Cresselia threatening Landorus-T, Conkeldurr, and opposing Heatran, thus allowing it to set up Substitute more easily. Finally, Conkeldurr benefits from Cresselia's speed control and ability to threaten Amoonguss and Intimidate users, such as Landorus-T and Hitmontop.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cresselia has a large supporting movepool with which it can support different team compositions. Helping Hand boosts the power of Cresselia's partner, allowing Pokemon, such as Excadrill and Heatran, to pick up KOs that they normally couldn't. Sunny Day can be used as an emergency check to rain teams. These support options can be used in place of one of Cresselia's coverage moves. Icy Wind is an alternative speed control option. Other sets include a Cresselia with more defensive investment to focus more as bulky support, Calm Mind with a defensive EV spread, which can be a win condition, and minimum speed for dedicated Trick Room teams.</p> </li> </ul>"

That said, Politoed isn't useless, in part due to a great defensive typing alongside a plethora of support moves. Scald is a reliable STAB attack, benefiting from Politoed's ability. Toxic is great to hinder Jellicent and Gastrodon, allowing Politoed to passively cripple two of Kingdra's most viable checks. Helping Hand helps mitigate Politoed's lack of offensive presence and is especially devastating alongside Kingdra's Muddy Water. Encore disrupts or punishes foes that try to take advantage of Politoed's passiveness by setting up a Substitute, or it can lock them into an undesirable move such as Protect. Alternatively, Hydro Pump can be used as a stronger STAB attack.</li> <li>Eject Button is the item of choice, because it allows Politoed to immediately bring in a more offensive partner after setting rain. Eject Button also allows Politoed to be safely preserved in case it needs to set rain again. Sitrus Berry can be used instead to increase its longevity.</li> <li>The offensive EV investment allows Politoed to OHKO 4 HP Choice Scarf Landorus-T. The Special Defense investment lives a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor from Latios with the remaining EVs dumped into Defense.</li> <li>Politoed's one job is to set rain. If there is an opposing weather setter, such as Tyranitar, it is best to preserve Politoed as much as possible so that it can win the weather war.</li> <li>Naturally, Kingdra is a mandatory teammate for Politoed to take advantage of rain. Like Kingdra, Politoed also benefits from teammates that can remove common threats to rain abusers such as Jellicent, Thundurus, Grass-types, and Dragon-types. Thundurus-T can threaten Jellicent, Thundurus, and Grass-types.

        "description": "<ul> <li>Unlike defensive Politoed this set aims to maximize an offensive presence, pressuring the opposing team with its strong rain-boosted STAB attacks. Politoed's role, however, is still to set rain with Drizzle, so the choice between the defensive and offensive sets oftentimes comes down to personal preference.</li> <li>Hydro Pump is the strongest Water-type attack Politoed has access to and can do massive damage under rain. Scald is a reliable Water-type attack for when accuracy is preferred. Ice Beam can hit Water resistances, such as Latios and Amoonguss, super effectively. Toxic can be used to punish common bulky switch-ins such as Jellicent and Kyurem-B. Hidden Power Grass is a more offensive option to punish common Water-type switch-ins such as Jellicent and Gastrodon. Protect should only be used in combination with Water Gem.</li> <li>Choice Specs further boosts Politoed's power, while Water Gem trades the consistent power boost for the flexibility of switching moves. Both items, however, are equally valuable and the choice oftentimes comes down to player preference.</li> <li>This spread aims to maximize Politoed's damage output. Alternatively, a spread of 248 HP / 204 SpA / 56 SpD can be used to survive Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor from Latios at the cost of slightly decreased power.</li> <li>Although Politoed's main job is still to set rain, it still has enough offensive presence to allow it to stay on the field, since it is not as big of a momentum sap as defensive Politoed. Due to the lack of defensive investment, if the opponent has another weather setter, it is best to play safely and preserve Politoed in order to win the weather war.</li> <li>Kingdra is a mandatory teammate to take advantage of rain. Pokemon that threaten or answer common rain checks, such as Jellicent, Thundurus, Amoonguss, and Dragon-types, are excellent teammates. Thundurus-T can threaten Jellicent, Amoonguss, and Thundurus. Steel-types, such as Metagross and Genesect, can threaten Kyurem-B and Latios while also benefitting from Politoed's ability to threaten Heatran. Finally, Thundurus can threaten Jellicent and Amoonguss while also offering speed control with its Prankster Thunder Wave to mitigate Politoed's low Speed.</li> </ul>"

That said, Scizor relies heavily on Swords Dance to be threatening and can be slowed down by Intimidate. Additionally, it struggles heavily to beat some of the metagame's most common Pokemon, such as Jellicent and Thundurus, and is hard-countered by Heatran.</li> <li>Bug Bite is a solid second Technician-boosted STAB attack that is stronger than Bullet Punch and can steal berries from common Pokemon such as Cresselia and Amoonguss.</li> <li>Steel Gem is the preferred item, because it powers up Bullet Punch, Scizor's most commonly used attack, notably allowing it to OHKO Latios after a Swords Dance boost. Steel Gem can also allow Scizor to do respectable damage even without a Swords Dance boost.</li> <li>Scizor's main goal is to set up Swords Dance as safely as possible to clean the opposing team with its priority Bullet Punch.

Tyranitar can threaten Jellicent, Thundurus, and Heatran, opening the door for Scizor to set up. Additionally, the residual damage from sand can put Pokemon in range of being KOed by Scizor's attacks.

If that isn't enough, a strong spread Water-type attack in Muddy Water makes Kingdra difficult to switch into, thus solidifying it as one of the most fearsome threats in the metagame.</li> <li>Muddy Water is a strong spread STAB attack with increased damage in rain. Draco Meteor is another STAB attack that can hit Dragon-types that resist Water super effectively, such as Latios and Kyurem-B. It's also a strong attack for Pokemon immune to Water, such as Gastrodon and Jellicent. Substitute most importantly blocks debilitating statuses, such as Thunder Wave paralysis, and it allows Kingdra to tank a hit with minimal damage. Hydro Pump can be used over Substitute if the damage is preferred, but this will greatly hinder the Thundurus and Amoonguss matchups.</li> <li>Water Gem is an option if using Hydro Pump to give Kingdra a nuke that is capable of OHKOing Thundurus. This, however, is fairly situational and weakens Kingdra's overall damage output, so Life Orb is the better option in most cases.</li> <li>A Timid nature is an option to outspeed or Speed tie opposing Kingdra, although it lowers Kingdra's damage output.</li> <li>Kingdra's combination of Speed and power can allow it to function both as a wallbreaker or a cleaner. Most of the time, Kingdra will be using Muddy Water and only uses Draco Meteor on threats that it can KO, such as Dragon-types or a weakened Amoonguss, since Kingdra will likely have to switch out afterwards.</li> <li>With how powerful Kingdra can be, teams with Kingdra are oftentimes built solely around supporting it. Politoed is a mandatory to set rain. Teammates that can threaten Thundurus, such as Thundurus-T or Kyurem-B, or redirect Thunder Wave, such as Amoonguss, are important to prevent Kingdra from being paralyzed. Thundurus-T and Kyurem-B both also threaten Amoonguss and Jellicent, which are two of the most common answers for Kingdra. Pokemon that can threaten Tyranitar, such as Genesect, Scizor, and Landorus-T, are important to ensure that rain stays on the field. Landorus-T also threatens Thundurus and can also pivot with U-turn, allowing one to switch Kingdra in safely. Finally, Grass-types, such as Breloom, Ferrothorn, and Shaymin-S, are common partners to threaten Water-types that resist Muddy Water, with Ferrothorn aiding with rain teams' often poor Trick Room matchups.</li> </ul>"

Sand amplifies Tyranitar's Special Defense, letting it function as an emergency check to rain - albeit not a foolproof one due to its Water weakness. The residual damage from sand chips away at foes, breaks Focus Sash, and negates Leftovers healing. However, Tyranitar is susceptible to Intimidate, and its typing makes it weak to common types, such as Ground, Fighting, and Steel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rock Slide is a reliable spread STAB attack, while Stone Edge can be used for more power, notably allowing Tyranitar to OHKO bulky Thundurus. Crunch is a secondary STAB attack that hits Latios, Jellicent, and Cresselia super effectively. Low Kick rounds out Tyranitar's attacks, allowing it to hit opposing Tyranitar and Heatran super effectively. Stealth Rock allows for additional residual damage and is important in helping Tyranitar pick up KOs, notably putting bulky Thundurus and Jellicent in range of Rock Slide and Crunch, respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chople Berry allows Tyranitar to survive a Fighting-type hit that it could not otherwise, such as opposing Tyranitar's Low Kick, -1 Hitmontop's Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat, or Landorus-T's Superpower.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tyranitar typically prefers to be sent out as early as possible so it can control the field with sand and Stealth Rock. Tyranitar's bulk lets it tank neutral hits fairly well, allowing it to trade with Pokemon such as Latios and Heatran. Against opposing weather setters, Tyranitar should be preserved as much as possible to win the weather war.</p> </li> <li> <p>Excadrill is a great offensive teammate, taking advantage of sand to turn into a fearsome sweeper that can outspeed the entire metagame. Thundurus's Thunder Wave slows down faster threats for Tyranitar, forming an annoying combination alongside Rock Slide's flinch chance. In return, Tyranitar can threaten opposing Latios and Kyurem-B for Thundurus. Latios appreciates Tyranitar's ability to threaten opposing Latios, Thundurus, and Kyurem-B, while Latios threatens Landorus-T and Conkeldurr for Tyranitar. Jellicent and Tyranitar form a formidable defensive core, with Jellicent being able to cover Fighting-, Steel-, and Water-types that threaten Tyranitar, while Tyranitar beats opposing Jellicent, Kyurem-B, and Thundurus. The residual damage from sand also benefits Jellicent as a defensive win condition by chipping away at the foe's HP, while Jellicent can recover off the damage. Finally, Conkeldurr appreciates Tyranitar being able to beat Jellicent and Psychic-types.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tyranitar has a vast movepool, allowing it to run different coverage moves based on a team's needs, such as Ice Beam, which OHKOes Landorus-T when run alongside a Brave nature. Choice Scarf lets Tyranitar outrun faster threats, such as Latios and Kyurem-B, and OHKO them. Other resistance Berries can be used for specific teams. Babiri Berry with Fire Blast can be helpful on teams that are weak to Steel-types, while Shuca Berry with Ice Beam can be useful on teams weak to Ground-types.</p> </li> </ul>"

Crunch is another STAB attack that does massive damage to Dark-weak foes that fail to pressure Tyranitar back, such as Cresselia and Jellicent. Pursuit lets Tyranitar trap foes that want to switch to generate offensive pressure, such as Latios after a Draco Meteor and Cresselia, as it 2HKOes them even if they don't switch out. Superpower is an alternative over Stone Edge to OHKO Heatran and opposing Tyranitar, and it is preferred over Low Kick for its higher Base Power.</p> </li> <li> <p>Thundurus is an excellent teammate due to Thunder Wave and its ability to threaten Landorus-T. Latios is another great teammate by threatening Fighting-types and Landorus-T while also supporting Tyranitar with Tailwind. Tyranitar supports Latios by threatening Thundurus, Kyurem-B, and opposing Latios. Jellicent and Cresselia set Trick Room while threatening common Intimidate users, such as Landorus-T and Hitmontop.

Rain teams also appreciate Breloom's ability to answer bulky Water-types, most notably Jellicent and Gastrodon, and Kyurem-B. Heatran is an excellent teammate due to its ability to threaten Amoonguss, while Breloom can facilitate Substitute with Spore and beat common Heatran checks such as Jellicent, Tyranitar, and Kyurem-B.

Additionally, it is immune to Intimidate and has a sky-high Attack stat that can be further boosted with Meteor Mash. This allows Metagross to snowball behind a Substitute, giving it the opportunity to quickly take over games. Metagross, however, is held back by a lackluster Speed tier, allowing common Pokemon, such as Thundurus and Heatran, to outspeed and break its Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p>Meteor Mash is the preferred STAB attack due to its Base Power, doing significant damage to Tyranitar and Kyurem-B, and chance of raising Metagross's Attack. Zen Headbutt is a secondary STAB attack that hits Amoonguss super effectively and does reliable damage to Steel-resistant foes such as Thundurus and Jellicent. Earthquake hits Heatran, a common Metagross counter, and opposing Metagross super effectively.

Zen Headbutt also does more damage to neutral foes that have a resistance to Steel such as Thundurus and Jellicent.</p> </li> <li> <p>Metagross is most effective behind a Substitute, so it is best preserved until it finds a favorable opportunity to set it up, such as against Amoonguss, or when its teammate is able to outspeed and KO the foe. Even without Substitute, Metagross is still very usable, as its strong attacks and immunity to Intimidate make it difficult to switch into.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intimidate users effectively increase Metagross's Defense, allowing it to set up Substitute easier.

Thundurus makes up for Metagross's low Speed with Thunder Wave while threatening Landorus-T, a common Metagross check, and Water-types such as Jellicent. Water-types, such as Jellicent and Gastrodon, are also excellent teammates due to their ability to check Heatran and Ground-types that threaten Metagross. As a result, Metagross can be found on rain teams, as Kingdra is a more offensive Water-type that checks Heatran and Ground-types while also able to outspeed and KO foes that threaten Metagross to facilitate Substitute opportunities.

    "overview": "<p>Latias is outclassed in most roles that it can perform in Doubles due to the omnipresent Psychic-types, Cresselia and Latios. Cresselia usually pulls off a support role better courtesy of its mind boggling bulk, something Latias can only dream of rivaling. Latios, on the other hand, largely outclasses Latias as an offensive Pokemon, due to its higher Special Attack stat. That said, thanks to its good bulk, useful resistances to common attacking typesâ€”Water, Fire, Electric, and Fightingâ€”and Speed, Latias is one of the best Tailwind setters in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If you could describe Latias's movepool with a single word, it would be 'colossal'. That said, even with plenty of attacking and supportive options, there are few if any combinations Latias can use as effectively as the moves listed on the main set. There are two item options worth mentioning though: Yache Berry and Dragon Gem. Yache Berry is fairly self-explanatory; it helps Latias in countering Blizzard teams and taking Ice-type attacks comfortably in general. Dragon Gem, on the other hand, seems like complete madness, but because Latias secures OHKOs on Breloom, Kyurem-B, and Chandelure with it, it is a perfectly viable option if you wish to fling an extra hard-hitting Draco Meteor in your opponent's direction.</p> <p>As Latias is first and foremost a supporter, additional moves that help it support naturally get the first mentions. Icy Wind can be used as a different form of speed control, but it is often better used by more bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia. Heal Pulse is an interesting option that lets Latias heal a teammate, but should be used with caution; it will hit the opponent if your teammate goes down. Safeguard also deserves a mention, as it prevents the opponent from repeatedly using Thunder Wave, which is usually one of Tailwind's worst enemies. Reflect and Light Screen seem great for Latias on paper, but it is no Cresselia, and therefore has a hard time setting said screens up. Sunny Day and Rain Dance are options to help either support your weather team or disrupt problematic opposing weather teams. Role Play can also help perform this, as well as copying useful abilities such as Intimidate, but it is generally hard to consistently use effectively due to the move's gimmicky nature. Magic Coat is useful for bouncing back Taunt and Thunder Wave, but it is very situational. Swagger can be used in tandem with a teammate carrying a Lum Berry to boost its Attack for free; it can also be used to disrupt the opposition, but relying on coin flips is usually a terrible idea.</p> <p>Latias can also pack a punch, so a fully offensive spread with 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid nature is viable due to Latias having more bulk than Latios. The main moves for this set would be Draco Meteor, Psyshock, Hidden Power Fire, and Protect. Thunderbolt and Thunder could also be used to hit many bulky Water-types hard, and Grass Knot and Energy Ball could do the same against different Water-types. You could also opt to use Psychic over Psyshock, but because most Pokemon in Doubles invest in Special Defense rather than Defense, Psyshock hits most targets harder. Finally, Latias's humongous list of other options ends with a rather peculiar option: Mist Ball. This move works as a STAB move and a pseudo-Snarl at the same time, but Psyshock is a more consistent STAB Psychic-type attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Steel-types, such as Metagross and Bisharp, have no trouble walling Latias's attacks and can do a good amount of damage in return. Bug-types, such as Heracross, Genesect, and Scizor, can easily KO it with their STAB moves, and in Volcarona's case, even set up on Latias. Thundurus and Tornadus are problematic if Latias needs to set up Tailwind, as they can both Taunt it, the latter also being able to deal a big number with Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Another huge problem for Latias is bulky or fast Dark-types, such as Tyranitar and Weavile, as they can take it out with a STAB move of choice. Most Trick Room setters can both wall Latias and undermine its speed control, especially bulky setters such as Cresselia and Dusclops. Chandelure succeeds in both setting up Trick Room and dealing super effective damage, making it one of the big thorns in Latias's side. Latios will win against Latias if it gets lucky; it needs to win the Speed tie and hope that Latias doesn't carry Haban Berry, but if the situation is so, Latias gets OHKOed easily by Draco Meteor, boosted or not. Finally, Sableye is a Pokemon that will make Latias rip its (non-existent) hair out, due to its ability to shut Latias down with Taunt and burn the potential physical attackers standing at its side.</p>",

      "Speedy Support": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Latias pieces together all of its positive traits to make the most out of itself as a fast supporter in the Doubles metagame. Tailwind is a fantastic support move, helping your team wreak havoc throughout the four turns that it lasts without fear of getting outpaced, but Thunder Wave is a perfectly viable alternative that permanently affects a Pokemon on the opponent's team's Speed. Draco Meteor might seem odd on a support Pokemon, and Dragon Pulse looks a bit more appealing on paper, but Draco Meteor provides fantastic utility by being able to OHKO many popular Dragon-types in Doubles and makes sure Latias can perform an alternative role as opposed to just being a fully support-oriented Pokemon.</p> <p>To show the benefit of using Draco Meteor over Dragon Pulse, here are some important damage calculations:</p> <p>Draco Meteor vs. 4 / 0 Salamence: 119.27 - 140.96%</p> <p>Draco Meteor vs. 4 / 0 Hydreigon: 109.2 - 129.44%</p> <p>Draco Meteor vs. 4 / 0 Garchomp: 104.46 - 124.02%</p> <p>Draco Meteor vs. 0 / 4 Latios: 100.33 - 118.27%</p> <p>The third slot is another move that prevents Latias from becoming dead weight after using Tailwind or Draco Meteor. Helping Hand is extremely useful, as it can boost Latias's teammates' moves after Tailwind has been set up, helping it fill the role of a supporter more effectively. Protect is very useful in the last slot for playing mindgames and is a general staple on many Pokemon in Doubles, but because Latias is as bulky as it is, Protect is not nearly as necessary as it would be on an offensive Pokemon. Psyshock is another viable option, as it hits common Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Breloom for solid damage.</p> <p>The given spread allows Latias to use its amazing Speed tier to outpace key threats such as Terrakion, Salamence, and Garchomp. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD might look appealing for additional bulk, but Latias's Speed is what really sets it apart from Cresselia, and it is much harder to set Tailwind or use Thunder Wave if Latias is slow. Sitrus Berry is the main item, as it helps with Latias's overall longevity, but Haban Berry helps it deal with opposing Dragon-types much more effectively, as it can survive any Dragon-type attack and retaliate by either setting up Tailwind or hitting back hard with a Draco Meteor. Dragon Pulse could work over Draco Meteor, but it misses out on the important OHKOs listed above. Psychic is an option to hit Pokemon such as Breloom and Landorus-T for more damage, but Psyshock hits most Pokemon harder due to the metagame being more specially defensive in general.</p> <p>First and foremost when it comes to picking teammates, know that anything with middling to high Speed appreciates the speed control support from Latias. Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Heracross, and Victini are all good Pokemon to use on Tailwind teams and should therefore be considered for use alongside Latias. Even more notable Pokemon under this category are Ground-types that benefit from Tailwind. Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine are all fantastic teammates, as they can freely use Earthquake due to Latias's immunity to it. Steel-types synergize extremely well with Latias, as they resist attacks that hit Latias for super effective damage, so Pokemon such as Scizor and Metagross are good teammates as well. Finally, teams weak to sun and rain appreciate the presence of Latias, as its presence alone will be a thorn in the side of those archetypes.</p>"

This, alongside Hidden Power Ground to cover Heatran and Metagross, makes Latios difficult to reliably switch into and a threat that every team must prepare for.</li> <li>Psychic is another reliable STAB attack that can hit common Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Conkeldurr, without the drawback of Draco Meteor. Alternatively, teams can opt for Tailwind over Psychic if they require the speed control.</li> <li>Both Dragon Gem and Life Orb function to improve Latios's damage output. Dragon Gem gives Latios a one-time Draco Meteor nuke. The idea behind the Dragon Gem set is that Latios uses Draco Meteor most often and only uses Psychic or Hidden Power Ground against super effective targets such as Conkeldurr and Heatran, respectively, which already take a ton of damage even without a Life Orb boost. Given how common residual damage is, such as from Stealth Rock or sand, the lack of recoil with Dragon Gem can allow Latios to better tank hits, such as Landorus-T's U-turn, Excadrill's Iron Head, or Choice Band Genesect's Extreme Speed.</li> <li>On the other hand, Life Orb gives a boost to all of Latios's attacks, thus allowing it to function better as a wallbreaker by dishing out more damage to key metagame threats, such as Heatran, Metagross, and Amoonguss. Additionally, Life Orb gives Latios more consistent Draco Meteor damage. Overall, either set provides more or less the same value to a team, and deciding which item to use oftentimes comes down to personal playstyle.</li> <li>Latios's unique combination of speed and power can allow it to function as a reliable wallbreaker while also being able to outspeed and threaten much of the format's slower attackers, such as Kyurem-B.</li> <li>Latios requires minimal direct support due to its ability to fit on a variety of teams, although it does benefit from teammates that can remove Tyranitar, such as Conkeldurr, Landorus-T, and Genesect.</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Genesect and Ferrothorn, although Latios will be slower than opposing Latios due to HP Fire IVs.</li> <li>A Choice Scarf set with Trick over Protect and Ice Beam over Psychic can be used as a speedy revenge killer, allowing Latios to outspeed and OHKO opposing unboosted Latios, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T while enabling it to cripple bulkier Pokemon, such as Cresselia or Jellicent, with Trick.</li> </ul>"

However, Deoxys-A is extremely susceptible to speed control such as against rain, priority attackers, and Cresselia, as its paltry defenses leave it easily OHKOed by nearly any attack. Deoxys-A's single target damage is telegraphed and its pure Psychic typing doesn't fare well against common bulky Steel- and Psychic-types, which can punish the -2 Deoxys-A by forcing it off the field. As Deoxys-A is too frail to switch in at any time, it often functions as a revenge killer rather than a breaker and finds itself competing with Psychic-types with better offensive coverage or utility such as Latios and Cresselia.</p> </li> <li> <p>Psycho Boost is a single target nuke that OHKOes nearly the entire unresisted metagame, including Choice Band Kyurem-B and Thundurus after Stealth Rock. Superpower OHKOes Heatran and OHKOes both Chople Berry Tyranitar and Substitute Kyurem-B after Stealth Rock damage. Ice Beam is Deoxys-A's best way of hitting Latios while also OHKOing Landorus-T without having to commit to Psycho Boost's Special Attack drop.</p> </li> <li> <p>Life Orb is necessary to hit many offensive benchmarks such as OHKOing Heatran with Superpower and Latios with Ice Beam. Focus Sash can be used to take a lethal hit, but it is not recommended, as it is easily broken by sand damage and Fake Out.</p> </li> <li> <p>The EV spread lets Deoxys-A outspeed max Speed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T and OHKO Heatran with Superpower, with the remaining EVs invested in Special Attack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deoxys-A wants to use its Psycho Boost as much as possible to punch holes in the opponent's team early on, preventing Landorus-T from getting a favorable pivoting opportunity, and so its teammates can clean up late-game. However, it must remain wary of common priority users, such as Choice Band Extreme Speed Genesect, Bullet Punch Scizor, Sucker Punch Bisharp, and even Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, if Deoxys-A is chipped down from Life Orb recoil and sand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deoxys-A struggles against Steel-types such as Metagross and Genesect, so Fire-types like Heatran are necessary teammates. Landorus-T is another great partner, capable of taking out Thundurus with Stone Edge, preventing it from using Thunder Wave, leveraging Intimidate to weaken sand teams where Excadrill outspeeds Deoxys-A, and setting up Stealth Rock to put foes, such as Kyurem-B and Thundurus, in Psycho Boost range. Amoonguss also pairs well, as it can redirect common attacks that would eliminate Deoxys-A and Spore faster threats, such as Kingdra, and Trick Room users, such as Cresselia and Jellicent, to retain the Speed advantage. Thundurus also helps Deoxys-A keep its Speed advantage, as it can Thunder Wave faster foes like Kingdra and Taunt Trick Room setters. Genesect synergizes well offensively, as it threatens Dark- and Psychic-types with U-turn with which it can pivot safely into Deoxys-A. Furthermore, its Extreme Speed can either weaken foes for Deoxys-A to pick off with Psycho Boost or pick off foes Deoxys-A weakens, cleaning late-game.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also has good bulk, only being OHKOed by Grass-types and Outrage from Choice Band Kyurem-B. Gastrodon has access to reliable coverage, hitting common metagame staples, such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Heatran, super effectively. This makes Gastrodon one of the best anti-metagame Pokemon, capable of countering common threats as well as being a soft check to rain, deterring Kingdra from spamming Muddy Water. Gastrodon's damage output, however, is low even on super effective hits. This could be mitigated with Storm Drain boosts but it is not particularly reliable. More importantly, it faces competition with Jellicent as a bulky Water-type, which has more utility and is an easier fit for most teams, relegating Gastrodon to only specific team compositions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gastrodon hits the entire metagame for at least neutral damage with Earth Power and Ice Beam, the former being a reliable STAB attack that OHKOes Heatran and the latter hitting Flying-types, such as Landorus-T and Thundurus, super effectively. Recover increases Gastrodon's longevity. Toxic supplements Gastrodon's low damage output, allowing it to put bulky Pokemon, such as Jellicent and Cresselia, on a timer. Scald or Muddy Water can be used for a Water-type STAB attack but does not hit any relevant threats.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sitrus Berry is the preferred item to give Gastrodon instant recovery, allowing it to stay on the field longer.</p> </li> <li> <p>The given EV spread lets Gastrodon survive consecutive Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor and has a high chance of surviving Life Orb Conkeldurr's Hammer Arm, while the Special Attack investment allows Gastrodon to OHKO Substitute Heatran.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gastrodon likes to control the field by using its excellent coverage and the threat of Toxic to deter common Pokemon from switching in.

Genesect and Metagross benefit from Gastrodon's ability to beat Heatran, Thundurus, and Landorus-T. In return, Genesect and Metagross can both threaten Kyurem-B, which can shrug off Gastrodon's attacks and threaten a KO with a Choice Band Outrage. Heatran is another excellent teammate, as it can beat Amoonguss, while Gastrodon is able to threaten Landorus-T and opposing Heatran in return. Gastrodon can also redirect Water-type attacks, allowing Heatran to potentially set up a Substitute in front of Jellicent. Landorus-T's Intimidate can increase Gastrodon's longevity. In return, Gastrodon can redirect Water-type attacks and threaten opposing Landorus-T. The double Ground-type core also shuts down Thundurus, supporting the rest of Gastrodon's team, especially those that are more susceptible to Thundurus.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, its typing also leaves it weak to Stealth Rock and many common attacking types, and its bulk and dependence on Trick Room leave it prone to being picked off by strong neutral hits, which means it isn't as effective in weather wars as the other setters.</p> </li> <li> <p>Grass Gem-boosted Wood Hammer OHKOes Tyranitar and Politoed, forcing them to switch out and leaving Abomasnow with the weather advantage. It also OHKOes Jellicent. Abomasnow's Snow Warning guarantees Blizzard always hits both foes, notably OHKOing Landorus-T and 2HKOing Latios. Ice Shard is an option to chip away at the aforementioned Ice-weak foes whenever Abomasnow is at a Speed disadvantage.</p> </li> <li> <p>The given EV spread lets Abomasnow take a Low Kick from bulky Tyranitar and OHKO it with a Grass Gem-boosted Wood Hammer. The rest of the EVs are spent in Special Attack. 0 Speed IVs are necessary to move before Tyranitar in Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p>Abomasnow uses Wood Hammer as its Grass-type attack to guarantee the OHKO on Tyranitar, while other options like Energy Ball and Giga Drain do not. Another option for Abomasnow is Life Orb with a Quiet nature, making it a stronger Trick Room attacker that can OHKO Latios with Blizzard.</p> </li> <li> <p>Jellicent is a most natural partner for Abomasnow, as it sets up Trick Room and beats Heatran, which resists all of Abomasnow's attacks. Jellicent may even opt into a more offensive set such as Water Gem Water Spout, as Abomasnow beats common counterplay such as Tyranitar and opposing Jellicent, making a powerful offensive duo with their combined spread attacks. Cresselia may be used as an additional Trick Room setter that can boost Abomasnow's middling damage output with Helping Hand or run Expert Belt as to beat Fighting-types like Conkeldurr. Heatran is another natural partner, as Abomasnow beats Water-types and Latios and Heatran beats Steel-types such as Metagross and Scizor. Eruption Heatran works especially well, as nearly nothing can switch into a Blizzard and Charcoal-boosted Eruption at the same time. Slow Fighting-types like Conkeldurr and Scrafty work well in Trick Room and provide another way of beating Kyurem-B and Steel-types, especially Heatran.</p> </li> </ul>"

Icicle Spear is an option to OHKO Focus Sash Landorus-T but is less consistent against Thundurus and Latios, as it requires 3 hits to OHKO them. Earthquake OHKOes Heatran and 2HKOes Metagross and Tyranitar. Ice Shard gets around Mamoswine's mediocre Speed tier to hit Landorus-T and Latios first, 2HKOing them and circumventing Focus Sash Landorus-T, while Stealth Rock grants it some utility and chips foes to get them in KO range of its teammates' attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus Sash allows Mamoswine to guarantee a damage trade one time and is especially useful for Mamoswine as it isn't affected by sand and hail damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other options include Superpower to OHKO Tyranitar without Chople Berry.

  "Rotom-Wash": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W manages to stand out as a premier Water-type in yet another tier thanks to its great typing, bulk, offenses, and ability. Its dual STAB moves coming off of its base 105 Special Attack stat allow it to threaten common Pokemon in weather teams, and from a defensive standpoint, its typing in tandem with its good bulk allows it to check dangerous Pokemon such as Heatran and Kingdra. Its ability in Levitate is the icing on the cake, allowing it to both easily check and partner well with Earthquake users such as Excadrill and Landorus. Sadly for Rotom-W, however, it faces competition from other Electric-types in the tier, most notably Zapdos and Thundurus, who are more powerful and have cooler support options such as Tailwind and priority Thunder Wave. Thankfully, however, Rotom-W's access to Hydro Pump gives it a niche these other threats do not have, allowing it to maim the Ground-types looking to absorb an Electric-type attack. All in all, Rotom-W is a top tier threat that every team should be prepared for.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W can utilize a ChestoRest set to heal off damage and cure itself of status, but the lack of a support move can hinder its effectiveness. A Rain Dance set can be effective to aid Politoed in winning weather wars. Sunny Day might seem like a strange option, but thanks to Rotom-W's typing and bulk, it can take hits from common rain attackers, set up Sunny Day, and maul Politoed with a STAB Thunderbolt. A Life Orb attacker set can be used to grant Rotom-W more attacking power and flexibility, but the recoil hampers its ability to check important threats. Light Screen can be used to pad the Special Defense of Rotom-W and its teammates. A Rindo Berry can be used to let Rotom-W survive a hit from Shaymin-S or Ferrothorn, letting it respond with the appropriate status move. Finally, Electroweb is an interesting option that lets Rotom-W grant more speed control to its team.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Grass- and Dragon-types that resist both of Rotom-W's STAB moves make for good counters to it. Abomasnow can easily switch into all of Rotom-W's moves and hit it hard with a STAB Giga Drain. Ferrothorn and Virizion also switch in with ease and can quickly dispatch Rotom-W, although they both must watch out for Will-O-Wisp. While Breloom and Shaymin-S don't enjoy taking one of Rotom-W's attacks, they can outspeed and KO with Bullet Seed and Seed Flare, respectively. Amoonguss is able to switch into Rotom-W with impunity, redirect its attacks with Rage Powder, put it to sleep with Spore, and heal off the damage with Regenerator. Latios, Latias, Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Kyurem-B can all shrug off attacks from Rotom-W and deal huge amounts of damage back with their Dragon-type STAB moves. Gastrodon is immune to both of Rotom-W's STAB moves. Although it can do little in return of Toxic, it grants its partner full protection from Rotom-W's Hydro Pump.</p>",

      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Rotom-W makes an excellent offensive support Pokemon and can use its good bulk and offensive power to check powerful Pokemon such as Excadrill, Kingdra, and Tyranitar. Hydro Pump is a great attacking move here, as it is very powerful and has excellent neutral coverage. It also decimates Ground-types and Tyranitar, both of which wouldn't mind taking a Thunderbolt. The fact that it gets a boost under rain allows Rotom-W to be both a nice rain partner and an even better rain check. Thunderbolt is a nice secondary STAB move, mauling the bulky Water-types that would otherwise not be threatened by Rotom-W. Thunderbolt also gives Rotom-W a more accurate attacking option than Hydro Pump. Thunder Wave is used here in order to cripple faster Pokemon and allow Rotom-W to better support its team. It is also nice to give Rotom-W a way to hit Pokemon that otherwise would not be very threatened by it, such as Latios. Will-O-Wisp is nice to cripple physical attackers, but paralysis is generally a more useful status condition.</p> <p>Sitrus Berry is the main item on this set because it helps boost Rotom-W's survivabiity, allowing it to continue to be a threat to the opponent as well as granting it the ability to take multiple hits in a single turn when needed. Alternatively, Rotom-W may hold a Water Gem or an Electric Gem to power one of its STAB moves to net quicker KOs. The investment in bulk is used to let Rotom-W survive a Life Orb-boosted Giga Drain from Ludicolo and either cripple it with paralysis or hit it with a Thunderbolt; the rest of the EVs are invested in Rotom-W's Special Attack to allow it to hit the things it checks for solid damage. Hidden Power Grass is a nice option to hit Gastrodon, which is otherwise a huge problem for this set. However, the loss of a support move can hamper Rotom-W's effectiveness. Thunder is a nice option in rain to grant Rotom-W more power, but its accuracy is shaky outside of rain, which can be a problem. Another option for this set is Discharge, as it gives Rotom-W a spread move with a nice paralysis chance. However, there is a noticeable drop in power between it and Thunderbolt, and the fact that it can also hit your partner can be a huge problem as it either forces Rotom-W's partner to Protect or forces you to pair Rotom-W with a Pokemon with an immunity to Electric-type attacks.</p> <p>Because Rotom-W is vulnerable to Grass- and Dragon-types that don't mind its attacks, Pokemon that can handle them such as Scizor and Abomasnow make for great partners. Scizor resists both Grass- and Dragon-type moves and can damage their users heavily with its Technician-boosted attacks. Abomasnow's STAB Blizzards can easily threaten both Grass- and Dragon-types, and it can also take care of Gastrodon with Giga Drain, making it another good choice. Other good partners include Hitmontop for its Intimidate support, Latios for its ability to outspeed other Dragon-types and beat Grass-types, and Tornadus for outspeeding all common Dragon-types and decimating things that can threaten Rotom-W with a Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus can also be effective partners, as they appreciate Rotom-W's ability to check rain as well as its paralysis support; they also don't have to worry about hitting Rotom-W with Earthquake thanks to its Levitate ability.</p>"

Thunderbolt is the secondary STAB move and has nice coverage with Hydro Pump, eliminating pesky Water-types such as Jellicent and Suicune that don't mind a Hydro Pump. It also allows Rotom-W to be locked into a more reliable STAB move and not have to risk Hydro Pump's 80% accuracy. Thunder might seem like a strange option alongside Thunderbolt, but it serves an important purpose. Even if you are using Rotom-W outside of rain, Thunder is necessary to net important KOs against common rain Pokemon, making this set a much better rain check. Here are some damage calculations comparing the power of Thunder to that of Thunderbolt:</p> <ul> <li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Thunderbolt vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Ludicolo: 220-259 (73.57 - 86.62%) -- guaranteed 2HKO</li> <li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Thunder vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Ludicolo: 277-327 (92.64 - 109.36%) -- 56.25% chance to OHKO</li> <li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Thunderbolt vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Kingdra: 229-270 (78.69 - 92.78%) -- guaranteed 2HKO</li> <li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Thunder vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Kingdra: 288-340 (98.96 - 116.83%) -- 93.75% chance to OHKO</li> </ul> <p>If you are uncomfortable using Thunder outside of rain, Trick is another good option, as it lets you cripple a Pokemon by locking it into a move, severely hampering its usability. Trick is also useful because it prevents Pokemon from effectively taking advantage of moves such as Fake Out and Protect. Hidden Power Grass is mainly used to eliminate Gastrodon, which is very important because Gastrodon is immune to both of its STAB moves and not only redirects but also gets a boost from Hydro Pump. Hidden Power Ice is also an option to be able to eliminate Salamence and Shaymin-S. However, Thunder is able to OHKO both of them, so keep that in mind when deciding whether to use it.</p> <p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to fire off an attack while gaining momentum, but it is weaker than Thunderbolt and isn't able to be used as reliably due to forcing Rotom-W out when it is used. Another option for this set is Discharge, as it gives Rotom-W a spread move with a high chance to paralyze an opposing Pokemon. However, there is a noticable drop in power between it and Thunderbolt, and the fact that it can hit Rotom-W's partner can be a huge problem. This set really enjoys rain support, as not only does it grant Hydro Pump more power but it also allows Rotom-W to use Thunder reliably. The EVs allow Rotom-W to live a Life Orb-boosted Giga Drain from Ludicolo, which is even more important on this set because Rotom-W has a high chance to OHKO it in return with Thunder.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Scizor and Tornadus that can reliably eliminate Grass- and Dragon-types make good partners for this set as well. Garchomp, Excadrill, and Landorus appreciate this set's ability to easily wear down defensive Pokemon so they can clean up late-game. They also enjoy the fact that they can use their powerful Earthquakes without worrying about hurting Rotom-W. Cresselia also makes for a great partner as it can provide the speed control that Rotom-W likes having. It also enjoys the fact that this set can easily destroy things such as Scizor and Tyranitar that would otherwise threaten it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf set, Rotom-W can outspeed and beat faster threats such as Tornadus. Hydro Pump is one of the main STAB moves used, and it is a great attacking option due to its high Base Power and its impeccable coverage. It is also great because it can eliminate Ground-types which are looking to absorb a Thunderbolt or Volt Switch; it also hits Tyranitar, which otherwise would not be bothered by anything on this set. Thunderbolt is another great attacking option because it hits bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Politoed and is more reliable than Hydro Pump due to its perfect accuracy. Volt Switch is a great option for picking off weakened Pokemon while maintaining offensive momentum. It is also a great way to bring in Pokemon such as Politoed to give your team an edge in weather wars. Trick is a great option to cripple defensive Pokemon that might try to take advantage of the fact that Rotom-W will be locked into a move. The fact that it disrupts the use of moves such as Fake Out and Protect is also a nice bonus. Hidden Power Grass is the main option on this set to get rid of Gastrodon, which is very important because Rotom-W has no way to get past it otherwise. However, Hidden Power Ice is an option to KO Shaymin-S and Salamence.</p> <p>The EVs are very simple and are meant to make Rotom-W as fast and as powerful as possible. A Timid nature is slashed first in order to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Heracross, but if this benchmark isn't necessary for your team, a Modest nature can be used for more power, netting useful KOs such as an OHKO on Tyranitar outside of Sand. Thunder is an option over Thunderbolt, but it should only be used with rain support, as otherwise its accuracy will be too shaky. Sadly, due to the lack of investment in bulk, this set has more trouble switching into hits than others. This set works best on teams that are slower and need a way to take on fast attackers, so teams utilizing strategies such as Tailwind will likely be better served by another one.</p> <p>Politoed makes for a great partner for this set, giving Hydro Pump a large boost in power and enabling Rotom-W to use Thunder instead of Thunderbolt. In addition, Politoed appreciates Rotom-W's access to Volt Switch, as it allows Politoed to perform better in weather wars. Pokemon that can defeat the Grass- and Dragon-types that don't mind taking on this set, such as Scizor, Abomasnow, and Tornadus, make for good partners. Cresselia makes for another good partner to this set as it can provide Helping Hand support, allowing Rotom-W to gain KOs that it might otherwise miss out on, such as an OHKO on Shaymin-S with Thunder.</p>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Shaymin-S is infamous due to the combination of Serene Grace with Seed Flare and Air Slash. It can be difficult to reliably switch in to its attacks, as the opponent will be risking a potential Special Defense drop. Additionally, its high Speed combined with Serene Grace Air Slash makes it an annoyance, as it outspeeds much of the unboosted metagame and has a high chance of flinching foes. Although that might sound powerful, Shaymin-S has notable weaknesses that hold it back from being a top threat. It relies heavily on its Speed to be effective and thus is susceptible to speed control. Additionally, Grass and Flying aren't very useful offensive types, only hitting few Pokemon super effectively and notably leaving it walled by Thundurus, Metagross, and Heatran. This means that Shaymin-S oftentimes relies on RNG to make up for its underwhelming offensive output. While Grass is typically a solid defensive typing in the metagame, Shaymin-S lacks the bulk or utility required to make use of it and, as such, is difficult to fit on teams. Nonetheless, Serene Grace can allow Shaymin-S to still make an impact, making it a threat that teams should be wary of.</p> </li> <li> <p>Seed Flare is Shaymin-S's strongest Grass-type STAB move, allowing it to OHKO bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Gastrodon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Air Slash is a secondary STAB move that hits Amoonguss and Fighting-types, such as Conkeldurr, super effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Substitute blocks Thunder Wave and hits that would otherwise cause it to faint, mitigating two of Shaymin-S's biggest weaknesses. Earth Power is an option to hit Metagross and Heatran super effectively, which would otherwise wall Shaymin-S's attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Grass Gem boosts the power of Seed Flare, notably guaranteeing the OHKO on Jellicent and giving a 50% chance to OHKO Tyranitar in sand. Leftovers is an option when using Substitute to give Shaymin-S passive healing and mitigate the residual damage from sand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shaymin-S generally tries to set up Substitute as soon as possible. Shaymin-S behind a Substitute is a major threat, as a Seed Flare Special Defense drop or Air Slash flinch allows it to quickly control the field.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shaymin-S finds itself on more offensive teams, as they can afford the utility loss of a bulky Grass-type. Shaymin-S fits well on rain teams, as it threatens bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent and Gastrodon, and Grass-types such as Amoonguss. The Special Defense drop from Seed Flare also benefits Kingdra greatly, improving its already high damage output. Shaymin-S also synergizes well with sand teams; its Air Slash threatens Fighting-types, such as Conkeldurr, while its Ground immunity allows Excadrill to Earthquake freely next to Shaymin-S. In return, Excadrill threatens Thundurus, Heatran, and Metagross. Finally, Thundurus is an excellent teammate, as its paralysis support alongside the high flinch chance of Shaymin-S's Air Slash almost guarantees that the target won't move.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tailwind is a speed control option against foes that will likely use Protect, at the cost of better coverage. Lum Berry can be used to absorb Thunder Wave once, giving Shaymin-S more flexibility in the face of Thundurus. Life Orb can be used for increased damage.</p> </li> </ul>"

Additionally, Excadrill has an excellent typing that has an amazing matchup against some of the most common Pokemon, such as Thundurus, Tyranitar, and Metagross. Most notably, Excadrill hard-counters Thundurus, including a rare immunity to its Prankster Thunder Wave, which sets it apart from other fast attackers.</li> <li>Rock Slide is a secondary spread attack that can hit Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Thundurus, in addition to having decent odds of flinching opposing Pokemon. Substitute makes great use of Excadrill's typing, allowing it to set Substitute up easily against the likes of Thundurus. Substitute also blocks Intimidate, burns from Will-O-Wisp, and Amoonguss's Spore, which are common ways of slowing down Excadrill. Iron Head is a secondary STAB move that can be used to hit Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Latios or Landorus-T, harder. Finally, Swords Dance is a more aggressive option that makes use of Excadrill's excellent matchup into Thundurus, allowing Excadrill to snowball and take over the game.</li> <li>Life Orb is the preferred item, because it gives a consistent boost to all of Excadrill's attacks. Ground Gem is an option for a one-time power boost to Earthquake. The idea is that Rock Slide is typically only used on super-effective hits, so Excadrill can afford the drop in power. Leftovers is an option on those using Substitute, although this greatly weakens Excadrill's damage output.</li> <li>A Jolly nature can be used to ensure a Speed tie with opposing Excadrill but similarly will weaken Excadrill's damage output, notably missing the guaranteed OHKOs on Shuca Berry Heatran and Choice item Kyurem-B with Iron Head after sand damage.</li> <li>Unlike its other weather-reliant counterpart, Kingdra, Excadrill does not gain a power boost to its attacks; therefore, it mostly acts as a cleaner with its strong spread attacks once key threats, such as Landorus-T and Conkeldurr, have been removed or weakened.</li> <li>Tyranitar is a mandatory teammate to set sand. Because Tyranitar and Excadrill share common weaknesses, Pokemon that can cover Ground-, Fighting-, and Water-types make excellent teammates. Excadrill will use Earthquake most often so Ground-immune Pokemon are necessary. Finally, Intimidate can slow Excadrill down, so it will benefit from teammates that can threaten Landorus-T, Scrafty, and Hitmontop. Latios and Cresselia are two notable teammates, because they both threaten Landorus-T, the most common Intimidate user, Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr, and are immune to Ground-type attacks. Thundurus is another excellent teammate that can hit Water-types, such as Jellicent and Politoed, super effectively. Amoonguss can redirect super effective hits and generate free turns with Spore, allowing Excadrill to more easily set up.</li> </ul>"

In addition, its low Speed makes it an excellent Trick Room attacker, while its decent bulk and priority move can allow it to function well outside of Trick Room too, making it great at trading against faster, non-Trick Room attackers.</li> <li>Hammer Arm is a strong STAB attack, with the Speed drop drawback oftentimes being a positive for Conkeldurr, allowing it to underspeed Amoonguss under Trick Room. Drain Punch can be used over Hammer Arm for increased longevity in exchange for raw power.</li> <li>Mach Punch allows Conkeldurr to finish off weakened foes. Ice Punch can hit common Fighting-resistant foes, such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Amoonguss.</li> <li>Detect is preferred over Protect in the rare chance the foe is using Imprison.</li> <li>A Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs is recommended, if using Hammer Arm, so that Conkeldurr can underspeed Amoonguss after using Hammer Arm. If using Drain Punch, an Adamant nature with 31 Speed IVs can be used, which allows Conkeldurr to outrun faster paralyzed threats such as Choice Scarf Genesect and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B.</li> <li>This spread maximizes Conkeldurr's Attack while allowing it to live Expert Belt Cresselia Psychic.</li> <li>Life Orb is the preferred item because it gives a consistent boost to all of Conkeldurr's attacks, notably allowing it to OHKO bulky Thundurus with Ice Punch.</li> <li>Conkeldurr benefits greatly from any type of speed control, although it can be more effective under Trick Room due to its low Speed. It is worth noting that, depending on the chosen STAB move, Conkeldurr can have a different role on the team. With Hammer Arm, Conkeldurr acts as a dedicated Trick Room attacker. With Drain Punch, it can focus more on whittling down the opposing team, exchanging raw damage output for better damage trading and health recovery.</li> <li>Cresselia and Jellicent are two common Trick Room setters that benefit from Conkeldurr's ability to beat Dark-types, such as Tyranitar and Bisharp. Thundurus can provide speed control with its Prankster Thunder Wave while also threatening Jellicent. Tyranitar can threaten Psychic-types, such as Cresselia and Latios, and Jellicent.</li> <li>Thunder Punch is an option over Ice Punch to hit Jellicent; however, this would greatly reduce Conkeldurr's coverage, as it loses the ability to reliably damage Landorus-T and Amoonguss. Conkeldurr's low Speed in combination with common Fighting-resistant foes, such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Amoonguss, makes it easy to chip Conkeldurr if using Life Orb; therefore, Fighting Gem is an option to increase its longevity while maintaining a strong Fighting-type attack.</li> <li>Another option is a bulky set with a 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD EV spread, an Adamant nature, Drain Punch over Hammer Arm, and Sitrus Berry for the item. This set focuses on Conkeldurr's excellent coverage and passable bulk to force trades and can be more functional outside of Trick Room.</li> </ul>"

Scrafty's poor damage output, however, is a major downside, oftentimes missing KOs even on super effective hits. Added on to this is a susceptibility to Intimidate, meaning that Scrafty can find itself providing little utility after the initial Fake Out and Intimidate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fake Out can generate pressure and opportunities for Scrafty's teammate, allowing it to set up Trick Room or Substitute more easily. Drain Punch is a reliable STAB attack with the added benefit of recovering some health. Low Kick more often has a higher Base Powder, allowing Scrafty to dish out more damage against heavier Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Heatran. Notably, Low Kick OHKOes non-Chople Berry Tyranitar. Crunch is Scrafty's strongest Dark-type STAB move, giving it a high chance to 2HKO Jellicent. Taunt can be used to give Scrafty additional utility, allowing it to shut down support Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Jellicent.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sitrus Berry is the preferred item to increase Scrafty's longevity.</p> </li> <li> <p>The EV spread allows Scrafty to tank Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor twice in a row while the remaining Attack investment allows it to still 2HKO key targets such as Tyranitar and Heatran.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scrafty's utility comes from Intimidate and Fake Out, so it switches in and out often. Despite its low damage output, Scrafty's damage can still rack up if left unchecked, especially since it can be difficult to knock out thanks to Intimidate and its natural bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scrafty is common on Trick Room teams, as its unique skillset synergizes well with the needs of such teams. Cresselia and Jellicent are two common Trick Room setters that benefit from Intimidate and Scrafty threatening Latios and Tyranitar. Fake Out can also allow Cresselia and Jellicent to set up Trick Room easier. Latios is another excellent teammate, as it can benefit from Fake Out neutralizing a faster foe, such as Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, for a turn, allowing Latios to KO it. Additionally, Scrafty can threaten common Latios answers such as Tyranitar and Kyurem-B. It forms a solid Intimidate core with Landorus-T, neutralizing the opponent's physical attackers. Additionally, Landorus-T and Scrafty can control the pace of the battle, as Landorus-T pivots into a more favorable teammate, while Scrafty generates free turns with Fake Out.</p> </li> <li> <p>Instead of Detect or Taunt, Super Fang is an option to damage bulkier Pokemon such as Thundurus and Gastrodon. Ice Punch is another option that does solid damage to Landorus-T and Thundurus. Helping Hand boosts the power of Scrafty's partner, thereby slightly mitigating its own low damage output.</p> </li> </ul>"

A Sassy nature with 0 Speed IVs minimizes Amoonguss's Speed so that it can function better as a Trick Room check. Most notably, it underspeeds Conkeldurr in Trick Room. Sitrus Berry can increase Amoonguss's longevity by allowing it to survive being attacked by both foes or 2HKOs it would not otherwise, thus allowing it to continue disrupting with Spore or redirection. Lum Berry is mainly for opposing Amoonguss, as it cures Amoonguss from sleep, whereas Mental Herb is mainly for Thundurus, preventing Amoonguss from being shut down by Taunt for one turn.</li> <li>Amoonguss can be extremely flexible with its spread and item depending on the needs of the team. For example, teams can opt for a more physically defensive set if necessary.</li> <li>Amoonguss aims to disrupt the opponent by putting key threats to sleep or supporting teammates with redirection.

Cursed Body can be used on teams with sufficient rain answers and has a chance at disabling moves that hit Jellicent hard, such as Thundurus's Thunderbolt or Landorus-T's Earthquake.

Notably, this spread with Sitrus Berry gives Jellicent a 75% chance to be 3HKOed by bulky Thundurus's Thunderbolt.</li> <li>Since Jellicent is a defensive wincon, it can oftentimes win games by itself once its threats are removed. That said, Jellicent's excellent typing can allow it to switch in easily against common metagame threats.

Landorus-T is an excellent teammate due to Intimidate support and its ability to threaten Tyranitar and Thundurus. Metagross and Genesect are able to threaten Tyranitar while also matching well into Grass-types and the two most common Dragon-types, Latios and Kyurem-B. Pokemon that can benefit from Trick Room also pair well with Jellicent. Conkeldurr is a notable one, as it can threaten Tyranitar, Kyurem-B, and Thundurus. Heatran, which can benefit from Trick Room, appreciates Jellicent's ability to threaten Landorus-T, Conkeldurr, opposing Heatran, and rain while it, in return, can check Amoonguss. Finally, Amoonguss has excellent synergy with Jellicent, forming a strong defensive core. For example, Jellicent can switch into Heatran, Cresselia, and Ice-type attacks that threaten Amoonguss, while Amoonguss covers Jellicent by switching into opposing Toxic and resists Electric-type attacks.</li> <li>Leftovers can be used for more passive healing.

Bisharp, however, is held back by its middling speed tier, and its Sucker Punch can be played around with redirection. Its low Special Defense also means that stray neutral special moves, such as Thundurus's Thunderbolt, will do massive damage. Finally, the three Intimidate users, Landorus-T, Hitmontop, and Scrafty, all can hit Bisharp super effectively, mitigating its ability to snowball with Defiant. Night Slash is Bisharp's most reliable STAB move, OHKOing Jellicent with Dark Gem. Low Kick provides excellent coverage alongside Bisharp's Dark-type STAB attacks by covering Dark- and Steel-resistant Pokemon, such as Heatran and Tyranitar. Life Orb secures an OHKO on Heatran and Kyurem-B with Low Kick after Stealth Rock damage and allows Bisharp to fire off a strong Sucker Punch. Dark Gem grants a one-time boost to Sucker Punch, allowing Bisharp to do massive damage to a faster threat, such as OHKO Choice Scarf Landorus-T at +1. It also allows Bisharp to OHKO Jellicent with Night Slash. Landorus-T is a good teammate because Bisharp benefits greatly from Stealth Rock support, which puts foes in KO range of Sucker Punch. Landorus-T can also check Heatran while benefiting from Bisharp's ability to check Jellicent and Latios. Physical attackers are also excellent teammates, because Bisharp deters Intimidate users from switching in. Choice Band Kyurem-B is another good teammate, as the threat of a Defiant boost can prevent Intimidate, allowing Kyurem-B to fire off strong a Outrage.

Hydreigon has an excellent movepool with moves such as Fire Blast, Earth Power, and Dark Pulse, and it lacks a weakness to both Rock Slide and Sucker Punch, which plague the other two Dragon-types. What truly differentiates Hydreigon from its brethren is its Dark typing, allowing it to check common Pokemon such as Cresselia and Chandelure. Hydreigon is not without its flaws, however. While its typing does give it useful resistances, it also gives it crippling weaknesses to the common Fighting-, Ice-, and Dragon-type moves. Hydreigon also faces a large amount of competition from other special attacking Dragon-types, as its awkward base 98 Speed leaves it outsped by Salamence and Latios, as well as Genesect. Despite these setbacks, Hydreigon's versatility and power make it a great Pokemon overall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydreigon has plenty of other options to choose from thanks to its amazing movepool. Taunt is a very useful move that Hydreigon has access to, allowing it to shut down defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Cresselia. A Dark Gem can also be used to boost the power of Dark Pulse, but Hydreigon's Dark STAB not only has worse coverage than its Dragon STAB, but it also has less Base Power. Surf is an option if Hydreigon is being used on a rain team, but other Dragon-types, such as Kingdra and Latios, make better users of the move. A Choice Scarf or Choice Specs can be used to increase Hydreigon's power or Speed, respectively, but these items ruin Hydreigon's main draw over other Dragon-types: its amazing coverage. U-Turn can be used in conjunction with Tailwind to bring in a more suitable Tailwind sweeper. Thunder Wave is another option Hydreigon can use, as it cripples many faster threats, such as Shaymin-S and Thundurus. Finally, Hydreigon can use Psych Up to copy the opponent's stat changes, which would remove the stat drops from Draco Meteor and Icy Wind.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hydreigon's incredible coverage and power make it very difficult to counter. Chansey and Blissey can take whatever Hydreigon throws at it and can slowly wear it down with Seismic Toss. Occa Berry Metagross paired with Tyranitar is a very good check, as the Occa Berry allows it to take one Fire Blast, and the combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch will KO Hydreigon after two turns of sandstorm damage. Apart from Earth Power and Focus Blast, Heatran can take whatever Hydreigon throws at it and can 2HKO Hydreigon with Dragon Pulse. Jirachi can paralyze Hydreigon and wear it down with multiple Iron Heads, but it must watch out for Fire Blast. Apart from Focus Blast, Tyranitar isn't fazed by any of Hydreigon's attacks can and 2HKO it with Low Kick.</p> <p>While Hydreigon is very difficult to counter, its common weaknesses make it rather easy to check. Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Mamoswine can all revenge kill Hydreigon with a super effective priority move, while Pokemon such as Latios, Terrakion, Genesect, Volcarona, and Salamence can all outspeed and OHKO Hydreigon with a super effective STAB move. Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Cloyster, and Abomasnow can also revenge kill Hydreigon. However, many of the aforementioned Pokemon become risky checks if Hydreigon has a Tailwind boost.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Hydreigon's amazing offensive typing and Special Attack, it can function as an amazing special attacker. Draco Meteor is Hydreigon's main STAB; with a Dragon Gem boost, it deals a significant amount of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. However, Dragon Pulse is an option if you prefer consistency, but its lower Base Power makes it an inferior option overall. Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's secondary STAB move and deals a large amount of damage to common Trick Room users such as Reuniclus, Cresselia, and Musharna. Fire Blast gets amazing coverage with Hydreigon's Dragon STAB, hitting Steel-types such as Jirachi and Metagross for a great amount of damage. Earth Power can be used over Fire Blast to hit Heatran and Tyranitar for super effective damage while still hitting Steel-types hard. If none of these coverage moves interest you, then Tailwind can be used to increase Hydreigon's Speed to amazing levels and allow it to outspeed and OHKO faster threats such as Latios, Salamence, and Garchomp. Protect is the best option in the last slot, as it allows Hydreigon to avoid damage from the foe's attacks.</p> <p>If you are using Tailwind, then an EV spread of 80 HP / 176 Spe / 252 SpA with a Modest nature is recommended to outpace Adamant Excadrill in the sand. A Modest nature is the preferred nature if you are using a Dragon Gem, as many bulky walls that have EVs to survive Timid Latios's Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor will be overwhelmed by Modest Hydreigon's Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor. While the Dragon Gem does allow Hydreigon to break through bulky special walls, the Life Orb is the preferred item to boost the power of Hydreigon's coverage moves, giving it the power to 2HKO Cresselia with Dark Pulse and OHKO Metagross with Fire Blast. A Chople Berry can be used to survive relatively powerful Fighting-type attacks such as Terrakion's Close Combat, but the extra power from the Life Orb or Dragon Gem is usually more useful. Flamethrower or Heat Wave can be used for a more accurate alternate to Fire Blast, with the latter hitting both Pokemon on the foe's side of the field. However, the extra power that Fire Blast provides is much more useful. Focus Blast can be used to OHKO Tyranitar and Bisharp while still hitting Steel-types super effectually, but its low accuracy is a major drawback. Pokemon that can cover up Hydreigon's weaknesses are great partners. Jirachi is an amazing partner, as it can redirect the powerful Dragon- and Ice-type moves aimed at Hydreigon with Follow Me while also providing Thunder Wave support to mitigate Hydreigon's average Speed. Excadrill is a great offensive partner, as it can destroy nearly every relevant Steel-type with Earthquake, allowing Hydreigon to use Draco Meteor without risk late-game.</p>"

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>Terrakion is a very straightforward Pokemon in both concept and practice. While other Fighting-types might use supportive moves such as Fake Out or rely on other Pokemon to set up field conditions, Terrakion gets straight to the point, outspeeding the majority of the unboosted metagame and often KOing or dealing massive damage with its incredibly useful STAB moves. This straightforward approach is also one of Terrakion's weaknesses, however. The Doubles metagame is riddled with Intimidate users, Cresselia (which basically walls and 2HKOes it), and weather users capable of outspeeding Terrakion, and it can't do much back without getting KOed. However, Terrakion is still a high-priority target that threatens many teams, and with a little speed control, Terrakion can easily dominate games.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Terrakion doesn't have the largest movepool, but it still has some interesting options that could easily fit on the physical attacking set. Quick Attack is rather odd, but it allows Terrakion to pick off weakened opponents such as bulky Thundurus or 252 HP Kyurem-Black that might survive Terrakion's onslaughts and also picks at the opponent before an expected demise at the hands of a priority move or a faster Pokemon. Helping Hand could be used in a similar vein; its best use would probably be powering up a Psychic-type enough to OHKO a threatening Fighting-type or making Draco Meteor even more difficult to wall. On the subject of supportive moves, Safeguard can easily shut down Pokemon that are keen on spreading status, but it isn't useful against Breloom and Amoonguss, and it requires a turn of setup against Thundurus and Sableye due to Prankster. Additionally, Safeguard paired with a Lum Berry can be combined with Swagger to boost Terrakion's Attack to sky-high levels or simply negate an Attack drop from Intimidate.</p> <p>Swords Dance and Rock Polish are two other moves that can raise Terrakion's stats, but Rock Polish can be redundant if you run any sort of speed control. Swords Dance is a very interesting filler move that can be used on predicted double Protects to great effect, but it requires a great deal of prediction to pull off. Besides the aforementioned Lum Berry, there aren't many other items Terrakion could take advantage of aside from a Choice Band and Chesto Berry. Choice Band's usefulness should be obvious, but an appropriate Gem is usually enough to score KOs. Chesto Berry probably isn't as obvious, but it can prove useful to cure Terrakion of paralysis and burns when paired with Rest prevention is probably the best medicine in this case, though. Finally, Sacred Sword negates stat changes and doesn't cause any of your own, but it's rather weak and probably better suited to VGC environments where evasion moves are not banned.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Landorus-T and Cresselia are Terrakion's biggest roadblocks. Both can soften its attacks and 2HKO or OHKO Terrakion with their STAB moves while Terrakion can't do much to stop them. In fact, Intimidate in general can handily check Terrakion, but some Intimidate users won't like taking Stone Edges. Common priority users such as Conkeldurr, Breloom, and Scizor can also easily check Terrakion, provided it doesn't hide behind Quick Guard. Amoonguss takes a pittance from Terrakion's STAB moves and redirects them with Rage Powder, can put Terrakion to sleep, and can take chunks out of it's health with Giga Drain. Prankster users, such as Sableye and Thundurus, can also cripple it with priority moves, though again, Thundurus won't like taking a STAB Rock-type move. Faster Pokemon with super effective moves also make quick work of Terrakion, the most notable examples being Latios, Deoxys-A, Shaymin-S, Kingdra, and Excadrill, with the latter two being able to outspeed even the Choice Scarf set in their appropriate weather.</p> <p>Trick Room, as well as speed control in general, is a major threat to Terrakion, as basically everything it previously outsped can now outspeed Terrakion and KO it, depending on how many times its defenses have dropped due to Close Combat. Jellicent, Slowking, and Gallade are Trick Room setters that can take advantage of their own Trick Room, with the former two having spread moves that hit Terrakion super effectively and the latter having access to Feint to ensure a KO. Cresselia can simply utilize Icy Wind and throw a Psyshock Terrakion's way to KO it. It also sets up Trick Room with ease, which often results in a quick demise for Terrakion.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sub + 2 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>The general idea of this set is to use Substitute to insulate Terrakion from its checks and to block status and Intimidate. Substitute also helps Terrakion circumvent Close Combat's defense drops, which is always appreciated. Terrakion's STAB moves comprise the set's coverage, which is almost unresisted. A Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat is Terrakion's weapon of choice, providing it with a power boost equal to that of a Choice Band, allowing Terrakion to OHKO threats such as Kyurem-B, Hitmontop (without Intimidate), Kingdra, and other similarly bulky Pokemon. Rock Gem is also an option, as it guarantees an OHKO on 252 HP Thundurus with Rock Slide as well as having a very good chance of OHKOing Latios with Stone Edge. Protect is in the last slot as a staple Doubles move, and it is especially useful against opponents that try to double target Terrakion's Substitute in hopes of reaching the chewy center.</p> <p>Gems are the main items you should consider for this set, as items such as Life Orb and Focus Sash would prove redundant or harmful with Substitute. Expert Belt is another item you could try if you dislike Gems, as it provides Terrakion with nice boosts against its common targets, but it's probably not going to score any impressive OHKOs, especially with Rock Slide. The 4 EVs in Defense instead of HP make Terrakion's HP odd, which allows it to make four Substitutes, provided it doesn't take any damage.</p> <p>Substitute Terrakion relies a bit more on Follow Me and Fake Out support than speed control. Mew, Jirachi, and Amoonguss, as usual, provide just that, as well as offensive support in taking care of Terrakion's checks with their coverage and resistances. Sableye provides Fake Out support as well as an incredibly useful priority Will-O-Wisp to threaten physical Fighting-types and Feint to ensure a knockout on Protecting Tyranitar and other such Pokemon. Cresselia, specifically offensive Cresselia, can provide Terrakion with important speed control and chip damage, as well as help Terrakion with Fighting-types and Landorus-T. A surprise Hidden Power Fire from Cresselia also goes a long way in dealing with the ever-threatening Scizor, but you have to be careful with using this method until you're sure Scizor isn't holding an Occa Berry.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This is about as straightforward as Terrakion can get without losing the ability to change its moves. Close Combat is a staple on any Terrakion, as it OHKOes key Pokemon such as Kyurem and Chople Berry Tyranitar, even without Life Orb. Focus Sash is used, as it allows Terrakion to take a hit without having to worry about how many times it can use Close Combat before it's OHKOed by a slight breeze. Life Orb, in a sense, does the exact opposite, powering up Close Combat enough to turn some 2HKOs into OHKOs while sapping Terrakion of any semblance of bulk. Rock Slide is, by comparison, weaker but deals healthy spread damage to anything weak to or neutral against it, resulting in more gross damage. Stone Edge doesn't have the nice spread coverage or accuracy, but it can OHKO bulky Thundurus and isn't bothered by Wide Guard, allowing Terrakion to check Volcarona more easily.</p> <p>The third slot is mainly filler. X-Scissor does nice damage to Cresselia and other Psychic-types, 2HKOing said Cresselia with only one turn of Helping Hand support (the first attack brings it just below Sitrus range and the second attack KOes) or a few turns of Sandstorm damage, while Cresselia can only 2HKO in return. Quick Guard not only protects Terrakion from Bullet Punch and Mach Punch, but it also stops slower Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Liepard from using Fake Out on Terrakion or its partner. An important detail to note about Quick Guard is that it does not protect against Prankster-induced priority, such as Thundurus's Thunder Wave. Taunt is rather useful to stop Trick Room, but you have to be careful about Taunting some supporters such as Cresselia and Thundurus, as they can both easily cripple or 2HKO Terrakion regardless of Taunt. Protect is a staple on this set to buy time for Speed changes to take effect or to nab another turn for Terrakion's partner to take out whatever is threatening Terrakion at the moment.</p> <p>Terrakion doesn't ask for much support outside of the already essential speed control. Cresselia and Mew provide offensive support, tackling tough cats such as Hitmontop, Scizor, and Landorus-T, as well as potentially possessing the incredibly useful Helping Hand. While Hitmontop and Terrakion share the same typing, it can still support Terrakion with Wide Guard and Helping Hand, which can sometimes be all Terrakion needs to tango with rain and sand teams. Swampert also has Wide Guard, but its main attraction is the fact that it can use Ice Beam or Ice Punch to OHKO Landorus-T or leave it vulnerable to a Rock Slide. As a bonus, Swampert can offer Icy Wind support and generally deal damage with its decent base Attack and good STAB coverage.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>A charging bull makes for a frightening opponent. By extension, a bull charging at speeds you wouldn't expect it to makes for a very frightening opponent. To many, this is exactly what a Choice Scarf Terrakion is, with its STAB moves capable of OHKOing its checks that rely on being faster, and the fact that it can run Adamant without worrying about Speed only bolsters its destructive power. However, like the bull that only runs in a straight line, Terrakion can become rather clunky when it's locked into the wrong move, so as always, it's wise to utilize prediction. Earthquake and X-Scissor are mostly filler when compared to the usefulness of Terrakion's STAB moves, but they still offer their perks. X-Scissor hits Cresselia, Latios, and Tyranitar for super effective damage, which is very useful to ease prediction in some cases, while Earthquake is a relatively safe option to hit Heatran super effectively and Fighting-types neutrally.</p> <p>If you're feeling adventurous, you could use both Rock Slide and Stone Edge at the same time at the expense of Earthquake. Both moves can have different applications at times, with Rock Slide being a safe early-game option while Stone Edge is more suited to mid- or late-game where you might need more immediate power. To further compare the two, Rock Slide has the Base Power of 55 to one Pokemon, but it can deal damage to two Pokemon at once and has a good chance to flinch, while Stone Edge's Base Power is a whopping 100, but it only hit one Pokemon and has worse accuracy. The EVs ensure that Terrakion outspeeds max Speed Deoxys-A and can survive attacks such as Adamant Life Orb Breloom's Mach Punch and Landorus-T's Earthquake, while the remaining EVs are dumped into Attack for more power.</p> <p>Terrakion doesn't need much support in general outside of more offensive Follow Me, chip damage and, of course, Helping Hand to guarantee OHKOs. Volcarona can easily dispatch Breloom with Heat Wave, redirect Fake Out, can burn the offender with Flame Body, and can go the hyper offensive route with Terrakion that can easily bulldoze through unprepared teams. Liepard isn't all that powerful or bulky, but it possesses Fake Out as well as a Prankster-boosted Encore to lock Pokemon into undesirable moves such as Trick Room or Protect; in addition, it has rather interesting options in Swagger and Taunt to prevent setup and possibly create free turns for Terrakion. Liepard can also run Sucker Punch to utilize Justified and pick off Pokemon weakened by Terrakion, but you have to be careful about damaging your own Terrakion to the point where it can no longer take advantage of its defensive EVs. Cresselia's offensive set once again comes into play, but defensive sets with Helping Hand might be more suited to helping Terrakion run wild. Sunny Day Cresselia also does a nice job of supporting Terrakion, as it basically neuters rain long enough enough for Terrakion to maim many Pokemon commonly found on rain teams such as Kingdra and Thundurus-T. Outside of this, Terrakion appreciates speed control to manage the opponent's speed control that's working against it.</p>"

  "Tornadus": {
    "overview": "<p>Tornadus is often overlooked in the Doubles metagame, even though it is one of the best physical attackers in the tier, courtesy of Defiant. Its other ability, Prankster, is also effective, allowing it to use support options such as Tailwind with priority. This is further backed by the fact it is one of only a few Flying-types with access to Flying-type STAB outside of Hidden Power in Acrobatics, which along with Defiant, allows it to rip through common Fighting-types such as Hitmontop. Additionally, Tornadus has good offensive stats, and its base 111 Speed allows it to outspeed and OHKO Latios, the fastest Dragon-type in the Doubles metagame.</p> <p>While its strengths may make it seem like a true terror to face on the battlefield, it has weaknesses to three common attacking types, Electric, Ice, and Rock, and it is further crippled by mediocre 79/70/80 defenses. This leaves Tornadus completely open to common spread moves, such as Blizzard and Rock Slide, and common threats such as Thundurus. Fortunately, the raw power of Acrobatics and the pressure Defiant can apply to the opponent more than makes up for whatever flaws Tornadus may have.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tornadus has a variety of options. Icy Wind can be used to slow the opposition down. Unfortunately, Tailwind provides more Speed control, and there is little need for both in most cases. Air Slash, Heat Wave, and Grass Knot are all viable special attacking options, though in general, Tornadus's role is one of a physical attacker. Foul Play could see use on a bulkier set, dealing heavy damage to opposing attackers, but a bulky support set is outclassed by Thundurus in most cases. Role Play and Swagger are two great options for the Prankster set; Role Play can copy Drizzle, Sand Stream, or another ability off of a partner, resetting weather and helping your team in a weather war, but it can only be used once before Tornadus has to switch out. Swagger is a great move choice because it can give the opposition a lot of trouble from confusion, but it is basically a 50/50 coin flip, and is often as risky as it is rewarding. Still, it can be used on a partner with a Lum Berry or Persim Berry, essentially giving them a free +2 Attack boost before their assault. Yache Berry, Wacan Berry, and Charti Berry can be used to offset its weaknesses, but Tornadus prefers holding a Flying Gem for Acrobatics.</p> <p>An entirely different set involving Prankster Rain Dance and Hurricane can be used. This is probably one of the best special sets Tornadus can run; utilizing a moveset of Hurricane / Focus Blast / Rain Dance / Tailwind, with an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid Nature. Flying Gem and Damp Rock are both decent item choices for this set. Unfortunately, Thundurus outclasses this set too, and in general, Tornadus is best used as a physical attacker, since that is a role Thundurus, its life-long rival, cannot fill.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The easiest way to beat Tornadus is by using an Electric-type. Bulky Thundurus is probably the best, as it can nail Tornadus with a Prankster Thunder Wave (assuming Tornadus is running a Defiant set) and finish it off with a Thunderbolt. Rotom-W and Zapdos are also great choices to put a stop to Tornadus's shenanigans, as they can both OHKO it with a Thunderbolt. Ice-types such as Kyurem and Kyurem-Black are also great choices to put a stop to Tornadus. Faster Ice-types, such as Weavile, Choice Scarf Cloyster, and Choice Scarf Abomasnow, can take out Tornadus before it can hit back; Mamoswine and Abomasnow can also deal heavy damage through Ice Shard, though Abomasnow will need to watch out for Acrobatics. Cloyster and Mamoswine additionally get special mentions, as Icicle Spear will tear through a Prankster Tornadus's Substitute.</p> <p>Rock-types that can tank a Superpower will also work out nicely if they get a safe switch in; Chople Tyranitar is an example of this. Like Ice-types, speedy Rock-types, such as Scarf Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, can take Tornadus down before it can attack. Terrakion can also be a large issue, especially if it is holding a Choice Scarf, though it will need some investment to tank a Flying Gem Acrobatics or Superpower. A less efficient way to beat Tornadus is Intimidate, which can weaken Prankster sets; however, you have to be sure that Tornadus is using Prankster, as Defiant sets will gain a boost from Intimidate and put you in a very bad situation. Additionally, Steel-types that can tank Superpower, such as Metagross and Jirachi, will also put a stop to Tornadus, as they can tank its attacks and hit hard in return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defiant Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This is Tornadus's defining set. Defiant allows it to laugh at Intimidate, which will only give its attacks more power. It can also gain power from Icy Wind, though the loss of Speed still hurts it. A Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics is incredibly powerful; anything that doesn't resist it is going to take a lot of damage, and frail resists such as Thundurus will still take heavy damage as well. Superpower rounds out Tornadus's coverage, nailing Rock-types such as Tyranitar, who resist Acrobatics, very hard. The choice of moves in third slot is a difficult one. Taunt is generally the most common choice, stopping Trick Room, Tailwind, and more unfriendly status. Tailwind is also an option, allowing your team to move faster than the opposition, which can be very useful. U-turn stands out as an offensive option if your doesn't need any support, and also lets Tornadus switch out while doing some damage. Protect is in the fourth slot, as it allows Tornadus to guard itself against opposing attacks while its partner on the field handles things.</p> <p>The spread is simple, with maximum Speed and Attack investment. For moves, Tornadus doesn't really have many other options. The third slot can be filled by Substitute, but this counteracts the effects of Defiant, and Tornadus has better options. Bulk Up can be used to boost Tornadus's power to higher levels and increase its Defense so that it doesn't have to worry as much about priority, but it is pretty situational, even with Rage Powder support, because Tornadus is weak to spread attacks such as Rock Slide and Blizzard.</p> <p>This set pairs well with Steel-types, as they can switch in to dangerous Ice- and Rock-type attacks, emerge without a scratch, and blow the opposition to the ground with STAB moves. Metagross and Scizor are particularly useful, nailing threats to Tornadus, Tyranitar in particular, with Bullet Punch. Jirachi gets a mention, as it can use Follow Me to redirect Electric-type attacks; it also resists common spread moves that trouble Tornadus, such as Blizzard and Rock Slide. Heatran is another good choice, especially against Ice-types, though it rarely runs a Steel-type STAB move. Lightningrod is an ability Tornadus can work well with, redirecting Electric-type attacks away from it. Unfortunately, very few Pokemon have this ability, and the best users of it are Rhyperior, Rhydon, and Manectric, who have some crippling weaknesses; Rhyperior also prefers Solid Rock in most cases. Ground-types that are not deathly weak to Rotom-W are good teammates as well, since they can freely spam STAB Earthquake to deliver heavy damage to Rock- and Steel-types. Mold Breaker Excadrill and Garchomp are the best Pokemon to pair with Tornadus that fit the bill. Mold Breaker Excadrill, in particular, ignores Rotom-W's ability and can easily dispose of it with an Earthquake; making a solid team with Mold Breaker Excadrill is very difficult, though. This set works well with anything that hates Intimidate, as it will make Intimidate Pokemon risky to send in, allowing Tornadus's partners to work without worry of their attacks being weakened. Fighting-types have good offensive synergy with Tornadus as well; Terrakion, Hitmontop, Conkeldurr, Breloom, and others work very well with it, taking out potentially hazardous Ice- and Rock-types with their Fighting-type STAB attacks. Hydreigon can be useful, as it is able to deal heavy damage to bulkier Pokemon such as Cresselia and Rotom-W with a Dark Pulse and Draco Meteor, respectively.</p>"
      },
      "Tailwind Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to make the most of Tornadus's other ability: Prankster. Thanks to Prankster, Tailwind goes up with priority, meaning Tornadus will almost always get Tailwind up. It also gives Tornadus access to priority Taunt, which helps shut down opposing Trick Room and Thunder Wave users, which a Tailwind team hates, making Tornadus a great team supporter. Acrobatics is the STAB attack of choice, dealing heavy damage to a variety of threats. Superpower can be used in slot 2, rounding out coverage, but Taunt is an option here as well. Substitute is useful on this set because it does not have Defiant, and most opponents would not dare to bring in their Intimidate-user on the turn Tornadus sets up a Substitute.</p> <p>Rain Dance is an option here, allowing Tornadus either support a rain team or mess with opposing weather. While you may want to use Hurricane on this set, Acrobatics does not rely on rain to hit, and thus it is the better option, especially due to the fact that it can OHKO Amoonguss and Latios while Hurricane can't. In general, this set pairs well with Pokemon with middling Speed; Heracross, Chandelure, and Mamoswine all appreciate Tailwind support. Steel-type attackers also make good teammates. Pokemon such as Scizor, Metagross, Bisharp, and Heatran resist Rock- and Ice-type attacks that Tornadus hates, and can strike Ice- and Rock-types back with high-powered Steel-type attacks. Fighting-type attackers such as Terrakion, Hitmontop, and Breloom will also make great teammates; Breloom particularly loves a Tailwind boost, as it allows Breloom to cripple dangerous threats with Spore. Hitmontop can also provide Fake Out support, allowing Tailwind to be set safely. Tornadus also pairs well with Ground-types, such as Garchomp and Mold Breaker Excadrill, both of which can spam Earthquake without worrying about injuring Tornadus. They both greatly appreciate the Speed boost to outrun the likes of Latios and Terrakion, and have effective offensive synergy with Tornadus's Acrobatics. Hydreigon is also a good option, as it can take out threats to Tornadus with a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor and dent Trick Room setters such as Cresselia with Dark Pulse.</p>"

Taunt further boosts Thundurus's utility, as it can shut down Amoonguss, prevent Substitute, and stop Trick Room from going up. On top of this, an impressive Special Attack stat alongside BoltBeam coverage gives Thundurus an offensive presence that most support Pokemon do not have. Notably, Thundurus is one of most teams' only options in consistently pressuring Jellicent.</li> <li>All of this combined solidifies Thundurus as one of the best Pokemon in the metagame and a threat that all teams must be prepared for.</li> <li>This EV spread allows Thundurus to survive Timid Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor and outspeed Adamant Landorus-T. Thundurus can run many other spreads depending on the needs of the team. For example, a spread of 252 HP / 60 Def / 176 SpD / 20 Spe and a Calm nature allow Thundurus to survive a Timid Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor while outrunning boosted base 70s.</li> <li>Thundurus has extremely high value, so it is recommended to preserve it as long as possible or until it has slowed down key threats with Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave will always have utility at any stage of the game because a key full paralysis can oftentimes turn the tides of the battle.</li> <li>Thundurus can easily fit on many team archetypes and does not require much direct support to be effective; however, it does benefit greatly from teammates that can remove Kyurem-B and Tyranitar, two threats that can threaten an OHKO on Thundurus, such as Genesect and Conkeldurr.</li> <li>Thundurus has a plethora of other moves it can use. Hidden Power Flying is an option for better damage to Amoonguss. Substitute can block a strong incoming attack, such as Latios's Draco Meteor. Additionally, Substitute guarantees that Thundurus can take one hit, allowing it to more effectively spread paralysis. Protect can be used to increase Thundurus's longevity, as opponents oftentimes prioritize removing Thundurus. Finally, Sky Drop is an interesting option to remove a threat for one turn and is often used in combination with a setup Pokemon, such as Suicune.</li> <li>A set with a 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe spread, a Timid nature, and an Electric Gem can be used on teams that favor more offensive presence while still having the utility of Thunder Wave.</li> <li>A physical Thundurus with Defiant, a 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe spread, a Jolly nature, Life Orb, and a moveset of Wild Charge, Superpower, Crunch, and Protect is a solid anti-metagame option, as it can outspeed and threaten common Pokemon such as Latios, Tyranitar, and Jellicent.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>In a tier dominated by Thundurus and its Prankster Thunder Wave, Thundurus-T finds a solid niche in being one of the only Pokemon immune to it. This, in combination with its high Special Attack and decent Speed tier, allows it to be an offensive threat that is capable of checking the most common Pokemon in the metagame such as the aforementioned Thundurus and Jellicent. Thundurus-T, however, lacks the overall utility of its Incarnate forme, making it a harder fit for most teams. As a result, Thundurus-T is typically only used on more offensive teams, such as rain, where the utility of being a Thunder Wave absorber can be more beneficial than the use of Thunder Wave itself.</li> <li>If Thundurus-T is being used on a rain team, Thunder is recommended; otherwise, Thunderbolt should be used. Hidden Power Flying is typically recommended, as it hits Amoonguss super effectively. Hidden Power Ice is an option for teams that want to hit Landorus-T instead and is more suited for non-rain teams, as those already have multiple ways of hitting Landorus-T super effectively.</li> <li>Electric Gem is the preferred item, as it notably allows Thundurus-T to OHKO Jellicent with Thunder. Flying Gem can be used on rain teams for more damage against Amoonguss.</li> <li>Thundurus-T's main role is to use Thunder whenever possible and Volt Switch out against unfavorable matchups. If the opponent has a Thundurus, it is best to preserve Thundurus-T so that it can check Thundurus when needed.</li> <li>Politoed and Kingdra are excellent teammates, as they can threaten Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Excadrill. Thundurus-T, in turn, matches well into common rain answers such as Amoonguss, Jellicent, and Thundurus. Genesect is another teammate that benefits from Thundurus-T's ability to check Jellicent and Thundurus, while it can check Tyranitar and Kyurem-B for Thundurus-T. The two also form a formidable VoltTurn core, capable of pivoting between each other for better positioning.</li> <li>Other options include Choice Scarf, which turns Thundurus-T into a speedy, powerful pivot, and Choice Specs, which turns it into a strong wallbreaker. A Substitute set with Leftovers is another interesting option, taking advantage of its excellent matchup into common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Amoonguss, Jellicent, and Thundurus, setting up Substitute and spreading massive damage against the foe with its strong Electric-type attacks.</li> </ul>"

Jolly is an option if higher Speed is preferred, as many Pokemon, such as Cresselia, Kyurem-B, and the aforementioned Thundurus, will Speed creep Adamant Landorus-T.</li> <li>Landorus-T is a common lead Pokemon, since it can cripple foes with Intimidate, set up hazards, or pivot out of unfavorable matchups. Against teams with strong physical attackers, such as Excadrill, Conkeldurr, or Tyranitar, it is best to preserve Landorus-T's health so that it can continuously use Intimidate.</li> <li>Landorus-T is capable of fitting on many teams easily due to its splashability; however, it does appreciate Ground-immune teammates so that it can use Earthquake freely. A common partner is Thundurus, because it can cripple faster threats, such as Latios or Kingdra. Latios is also a common partner, since it can threaten Kyurem-B and opposing Landorus-T. Cresselia benefits from Intimidate while also being able to hit opposing Landorus-T super effectively.</li> <li>Explosion is an option on Jolly Landorus-T, as it can outrun Speed creeping Pokemon and is guaranteed to live a hit with Focus Sash, barring a double-target. Superpower over U-turn is also an option on Jolly Landorus-T to hit Kyurem-B super effectively.</li> </ul>"

Similarly, Adamant nature guarantees the OHKO on standard Thundurus with Stone Edge. Alternatively, a spread with Jolly and maximum Speed can be used to outrun positive nature Deoxys-A.</li> <li>With its Speed and U-turn, this set aims to spread chip damage while pivoting for favorable matchups. Importantly, U-turn allows Choice Scarf Landorus-T to outrun and threaten Latios. This set can also clean with its strong Earthquakes once the opponent's Ground-immune Pokemon have been removed.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Landorus-T requires teammates that it can Earthquake next to, since it does not have the luxury to switch moves. Latios is a great offensive partner, as its combination of Speed and Special Attack, alongside an immunity to Earthquake, can allow it to clean up games with Landorus-T. Since Landorus-T uses U-turn often, bulky Pokemon it can pivot into, such as Amoonguss, are great partners as well.</li> </ul>"

In fact, Choice Band-boosted Outrage is capable of 2HKOing even foes that resist Dragon, making it difficult for them to switch in to Kyurem-B. This allows Kyurem-B to brute-force its way through defensive cores, gaining quick and decisive advantages for the team.</p> </li> <li> <p>Choice Band further boosts Kyurem-B's high Attack stat. Outrage is the preferred Dragon-type STAB move due to its damage output, while Dragon Claw is a second STAB attack that trades damage for reliability, since it allows you to select the target. Fusion Bolt can hit bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent and Politoed, super effectively without relying on Outrage. Sleep Talk bypasses the effects of Spore, allowing Kyurem-B to attack even while asleep. Ice Beam is an option to hit Landorus-T, as Intimidate is a common way of slowing down Kyurem-B.</p> </li> <li> <p>An Adamant nature maximizes Kyurem-B's damage potential. A Jolly nature is an option to outrun Jolly Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p>Even though Kyurem-B cannot select its target, do not be afraid of using Outrage. Choice Band-boosted Outrage can OHKO traditionally bulky neutral hits, such as Amoonguss and Conkeldurr, and can even 2HKO foes that resist Dragon, such as Heatran, which mitigates the inability to select a target.</p> </li> <li> <p>This set benefits from speed control. Thundurus is an excellent teammate, because it can easily slow down faster threats such as Latios. Cresselia is another great teammate due to its access to speed control and ability to threaten Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Hitmontop. Landorus-T and Heatran can threaten Steel-types that commonly switch in to Kyurem-B.</p> </li> </ul>"

Access to unresisted coverage and reliable super effective coverage makes Kyurem-B great at breaking down the opposing team while its bulk and typing can make it difficult to remove, allowing Kyurem-B to act as a wincon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ice Beam is a reliable STAB attack that hits common Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Thundurus super effectively. Earth Power gives Kyurem-B unresisted coverage and works well with Ice Beam by allowing Kyurem-B to hit Steel-types, such as Heatran and Metagross, super effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>This EV spread outruns Jolly Landorus-T. The Special Attack guarantees a 2HKO on Metagross with Earth Power. The HP investment guarantees that Kyurem-B's Substitute will not be broken by Seismic Toss, while the extra Defense investment allows Kyurem-B to live a Meteor Mash from Metagross.</p> </li> <li> <p>As mentioned previously, Kyurem-B aims to set up Substitute on Pokemon that cannot break it easily, which then allows it to control the game with its unresisted coverage. Substitute also allows Kyurem-B to shield it from a lethal attack, such as Latios's Draco Meteor, which makes it difficult for the opposing Pokemon to reliably trade with Kyurem-B.

With Choice Scarf, Kyurem-B is capable of outrunning and OHKOing these common threats, giving teams a reliable answer to the pressure posed by these Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ice Beam is a reliable Ice-type STAB move that hits Landorus-T and Thundurus super effectively. Earth Power allows Kyurem-B to hit Steel-types, such as Heatran or Metagross, super effectively. Fusion Bolt can hit bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent, which are common switch-ins to this set. Dragon Claw is a second STAB attack that is powerful even with minimal Attack investment. Notably, a Dragon-type STAB move matches up better against opposing Kyurem-B and can allow it to OHKO Latios, whereas Ice Beam is only a roll. Since this set lacks high damage output, Toxic can be used to punish common bulky switch-ins such as Cresselia or Gastrodon. Finally, Draco Meteor is a stronger Dragon-type STAB move, albeit less reliable due to the Special Attack drop after its use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Due to the reliance on Speed, this set benefits greatly from teammates that can stop common speed control options. Landorus-T is immune to Thunder Wave and can threaten Thundurus. Similarly, Pokemon that can threaten Steel-types, such as Heatran and Conkeldurr, are excellent teammates. Conkeldurr, in particular, benefits greatly from Kyurem-B's ability to threaten Landorus-T and Latios.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, Keldeo struggles to find a place in the metagame, as the tier's best Pokemon either outright wall it, such as Jellicent and Amoonguss, or have a Speed advantage and trade positively against it, such as Latios and Thundurus. Furthermore, there's a plethora of other Water- and Fighting-types that offer greater utility, more favorable offensive matchups, and less reliance on speed control, leaving Keldeo as a mere fringe option for specific offense teams.</p> </li> <li> <p>Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump OHKOes all Water-weak foes such as Heatran, Excadrill, and Landorus-T. It also 2HKOes nearly the entire unresisted metagame, eliminating frailer foes, such as Scizor and Genesect after Stealth Rock, and bulky foes such as Metagross and Conkeldurr. Secret Sword is the safer option with which to OHKO Tyranitar and Excadrill while also being the main way of damaging Kyurem-B, Politoed, Kingdra, and Ferrothorn. Toxic is Keldeo's best option against Jellicent, which it can't hit otherwise, while Taunt is an option to shut down Jellicent, Amoonguss, and Cresselia's utility options.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keldeo struggles against the faster Latios and gets walled by Jellicent and Amoonguss. As such, Thundurus is a good teammate, because it can paralyze faster foes with Thunder Wave and shut down Amoonguss with Taunt while hitting Jellicent with Thunderbolt. Latios is another common partner, as its Draco Meteor chunks out Keldeo's defensive checks, and Psychic eliminates Amoonguss. Keldeo fares well on sand teams, as it beats Landorus-T and Substitute Heatran, which Tyranitar and Excadrill struggle against. In return, Tyranitar beats Jellicent, Thundurus, and Latios and disrupts rain, while Excadrill and Keldeo form an overwhelming high Speed offensive duo. Lastly, Metagross is an adequate partner, as Keldeo beats its checks, while Metagross beats Latios and uses Substitute against Amoonguss.</p> </li> </ul>"

Genesect also has great attacking stats, letting it take on the role of a physical or special attacker and making it easy to fit on teams. Its BoltBeam coverage is stellar, and its attacking prowess can be boosted significantly by a favorable Download boost. It also has access to STAB U-turn, which allows it to scout out the enemy team and makes it a potent Choice Scarf user. Its typing leaves it with only one weakness, albeit a large one, but unfortunately, its bulk leaves it unable to fully take advantage of it. Genesect fears paralysis and is dead weight in Trick Room, so it needs teammates that can cover those weaknesses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Genesect can run a powerful Choice Band or physical Life Orb set, which has the power to OHKO every weather starter in the metagame with either Explosion or U-turn; it also has decent coverage with Blaze Kick to KO Steel-types and has revenge killing potential with ExtremeSpeed. A Focus Sash might allow Genesect to grab a few surprise KOs, and Genesect's immunity to sandstorm makes Focus Sash a more reliable item, but other items are generally better. Genesect can run an Occa Berry, but it still won't be able to survive most powerful Fire-type attacks used in the tier. Bug Gem is also an option for allowing Genesect to do major damage to Cresselia and Tyranitar without restricting its move selection, but Choice Band is generally the better item choice if you want extra power. Rock Polish is available, but Genesect doesn't quite have the bulk to pull it off in Doubles. Sitrus Berry is nice for longevity, but it is generally worse than more offensive items such as Expert Belt.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fire-type Pokemon, such as Heatran, Volcarona, Chandelure, and Ninetales, do not fear Genesect at all and can easily exploit its 4x weakness to Fire-type moves without taking much damage from its attacks. Excadrill in sand and Kingdra in rain are also big threats, as their powerful moves will deal a lot of damage to Genesect. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp also threaten Genesect with powerful spread moves such as Earthquake, though it is worth noting that Choice Scarf Genesect can beat Landorus-T with Ice Beam. Genesect can't really do much to Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Kyurem-B, either of which can strike back and take a serious chunk out of its health.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes use of Genesect's BoltBeam coverage to hit almost everything for at least neutral damage and many Pokemon super effectively. U-turn is great for scouting the opponent's team and is an option for when Genesect gets an Attack boost from Download. It also hits common Pokemon such as Tyranitar in sandstorm for more damage than Bug Buzz, which is still a viable alternative if you want a special STAB that is unaffected by Intimidate. Thunder is the better choice for rain teams and can OHKO 252/0 Politoed, provided Genesect has a Special Attack boost from Download; however, it is risky if rain is not up. Ice Beam deals with Dragons-types and other Pokemon 4x weak to it, such as Landorus-T, allowing Genesect to outspeed and KO them. Protect is standard for prediction and can keep Genesect safe while its counters are removed. Flamethrower is an option over Protect to increase Genesect's coverage but means Genesect is even more threatened by its checks and counters, and will be forced to switch out more often.</p> <p>With a favorable Download boost, Genesect can easily defeat a lot of Pokemon with not-so-stellar defenses; however, anything with decent bulk can force it out. Genesect also hates Trick Room, as it works against Genesect's Speed. Pokemon with moves such as Taunt to stop the enemy from using Trick Room can be good partners. This set really benefits from Tailwind support as it helps Genesect take on faster opponents and also lets it U-turn out into a Tailwind setter to keep momentum. Genesect partners well with Chandelure and Heatran, as they make opponents think twice about using Fire-type attacks. Genesect takes no damage from sandstorm, meaning it is easy to fit onto a sandstorm team. Giga Drain can be used to take down Gastrodon if it is an issue. Blizzard is viable, especially in hail, as it really packs a punch and can deal major damage. A Focus Sash can secure a few surprise KOs, but Expert Belt and Life Orb are generally better. Expert Belt is the preferred choice for most teams as it helps Genesect get a number of significant KOs with no drawbacks. Genesect can also use a Life Orb to increase its damage output, but it means that Genesect is worn down much faster.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Genesect is one of the premier Choice Scarf users in the tier thanks to its good Speed stat and ability to beat other common Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T with its Download-boosted attacks. BoltBeam coverage means that only a select few Pokemon resist Genesect's coverage. U-turn makes Genesect an excellent scout. It also allows it to dent Pokemon such as Cresselia and Tyranitar, and provides an answer to Reuniclus, one of the most popular Trick Room setters. With a beneficial Download boost, U-turn OHKOes both Latios and Latias, thus taking a major threat out of the game. Thunder will OHKO max HP Politoed 75% of the time, making it the better option for a rain team; however, Thunderbolt still packs quite a punch. The last slot depends on your team. Flamethrower provides more coverage but is worse on rain teams, on the one hand while Bug Buzz gives Genesect a special STAB move in case you don't want it to switch out. Explosion is great late-game, and can help deal with things your team might struggle with. Genesect must always be wary of getting predicted and locked into a bad move, as it doesn't have much bulk to rely on. Make sure you scout out the enemy's Choice Scarf users before being too reckless with Genesect due to this frailty. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Genesect hates dealing with sun teams, as it can't do much damage to many of their major threats.</p> <p>The given EV Spread allows Genesect to outspeed everything up to and including Deoxys-A (with 236 Speed EVs). The extra EVs in Attack allows Genesect to 2HKO Cresselia provided it receives an attack boost from Download. Giga Drain can be used in the last slot if your team has trouble dealing with the commonly seen Gastrodon. Genesect benefits greatly from a Pokemon that resists Fire-type attacks, such as Tyranitar; Genesect's immunity to sandstorm makes Tyranitar an even better partner. Chandelure also works as a great partner, as it can also get a boost from Fire-type attacks directed at Genesect.</p>"
