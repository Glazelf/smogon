  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar is a unique Pokemon in the STABmons metagame. Its Ghost / Poison typing and its ability, Levitate, provide it with resistances to three common types in Bug, Fairy, and Grass and immunities to three other types in Fighting, Normal, and Ground, making it a good switch-in to notable threats like Landorus-T and Excadrill. Its typing also allows it to have good neutral coverage with its STAB moves alone and perform as a switch-in to most Fake Out + Extreme Speed users; however, the prevalence of Scrappy Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Mega Lopunny and Stoutland makes it more difficult for Gengar to stay on the field for long periods of time. Sadly, Gengar has terrible 60 / 60 / 75 bulk, meaning that it will get KOed from almost any neutral hit. Not only that, it is extremely predictable, as it will always either attack or use its utility move. Gengar's Speed tier isn't the most impressive in a metagame where priority and Choice Scarf users are common; however, base 110 Speed lets Gengar outspeed non-Choice Scarf Keldeo and Landorus-T, as well as unboosted Kyurem-B, and Speed tie with Latios and Latias. Additionally, Gengar has the ability to run a coverage move such as Focus Blast to take care of a plethora of Pokemon that resist its STAB moves. It can also run a utility move, giving it some variety depending on what its team needs. Overall, Gengar faces little to no competition thanks to the lack of any other offensive Ghost-types in the STABmons metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf can be used over Life Orb to outpeed Latios, Latias, opposing Gengar, and slower Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, but it causes Gengar's damage output to decrease by a significant amount, resulting in fewer KOs overall. Substitute can be used over Taunt to allow Gengar to live longer and to hit more Pokemon safely and to deal with Pursuit trappers more easily, but it causes Gengar's HP to go down crazily fast combined with Life Orb. Destiny Bond can also be used in the fourth moveslot to help Gengar deal with the Pokemon it has a hard time KOing otherwise. Pain Split can be used over Taunt to allow Gengar to live longer, but the health regained is sometimes too little to be significant, and Life Orb makes it hard for Gengar to live longer with Pain Split. Toxic Spikes can be used to support Gengar and its teammates by crippling bulky Pokemon to KO them more easily. Icy Wind allows Gengar to OHKO Landorus-T and threaten specially defensive Gliscor, and it cripples faster Pokemon to let Gengar outspeed them the following turns while preventing Dragon Dance users from boosting their Speed stat. Disable can be used to cripple all-out attackers and bulky walls. A Hex set with moves such as Will-O-Wisp to make Hex stronger, either Sludge Wave or Sludge Bomb to poison the foes that are immune to Will-O-Wisp, and Focus Blast to take care of Pokemon that resist or are immune to either attacking move such as Bisharp can be used to form a stallbreaker set. With the Hex set, use either Black Sludge to regain HP to live longer or Spell Tag for an even stronger Hex, and an EV spread of 144 HP / 108 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe to increase Gengar's bulk significantly, which can be crucial for the set to perform well.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Scrappy Fake Out + Extreme Speed Mega Lopunny and Stoutland, Water Shuriken Gyarados and Azumarill, Sucker Punch Tyranitar, Weavile, and Bisharp, and Gale Wings Talonflame all easily KO Gengar without it getting a chance to damage them due to its mediocre bulk; however, all of them, bar Talonflame, must be wary of Will-O-Wisp to avoid being crippled.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Weavile all easily KO Gengar with their Dark-type STAB moves. Weavile also functions as a Pursuit trapper and can easily trap and KO Gengar due to its frailty. However, all of them are crippled by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon such as Thundurus, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Choice Scarf Terrakion all threaten Gengar with their strong STAB and coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Mega Sableye, Mandibuzz, and Assault Vest Meloetta easily switch in on Gengar's moves and take care of it with their coverage. Meloetta is also immune to Gengar's Ghost-type STAB moves and takes little damage from its other moves.</p>",

      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball provides Gengar with good neutral coverage and gives it the ability to KO Mega Slowbro, Celebi, Espeon, and opposing Gengar. Sludge Wave, when used in tandem with Shadow Ball, gives Gengar solid neutral coverage and lets it KO opposing Fairy- and Grass-types such as Clefable and Serperior. Focus Blast lets Gengar hit Steel-, Dark-, Ice-, Rock-, and Normal-types such as Heatran, Bisharp, Weavile, Terrakion, and Porygon-Z super effectively, and it also covers the Pokemon that resist both Sludge Wave and Shadow Ball, such as Bisharp. Taunt prevents setup sweepers and entry hazard setters from doing their jobs successfully, whereas Will-O-Wisp lets Gengar cripple physical attackers.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs, along with a Timid nature, let Gengar hit as hard and move as fast as possible. Life Orb makes up for the lack of a Modest nature and further boosts Gengar's damage output. Levitate lets Gengar switch into Ground-type Pokemon, except for Excadrill. 29 HP IVs minimize Life Orb recoil.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Gengar in on Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Porygon-Z, Porygon2, and Ursaring. However, try to avoid Scrappy Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Mega Lopunny and Stoutland, though, as they easily KO Gengar with those moves. Use Shadow Ball on the predicted switch in from Latios, Latias, and opposing Gengar. Avoid Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, as they can easily KO Gengar with their STAB moves. Try to bring Gengar in on a safe switch because of how frail it is. Use Taunt to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and to prevent Pokemon such as Ferrothorn from setting up entry hazards. Use Will-O-Wisp on the predicted switches in from Choice Scarf Terrakion and Landorus-T, as well as from faster physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, or just to cripple unboosted Kyurem-B and non-Choice Scarf Terrakion and Landorus-T. Spreading burns is also very helpful if you don't know what move to attack with on Gengar. If the opponent has a Pursuit trapper, don't leave Gengar on the field for too long until it has been taken care of, or else Gengar has to continuously pivot out to avoid it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Physical walls such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Heatran are able to switch into Scrappy Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Mega Lopunny and Stoutland, and Gengar can switch into non-Scrappy Fake Out + Extreme Speed in return. Entry hazard clearers such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, Latias, and Starmie help Gengar stay on the field longer. Conversely, entry hazard setters such as Klefki, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn give Gengar an easier time with KOing foes. Dark- and Bug-types such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, Weavile, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Scizor help Gengar take care of Psychic-types such as Latios and Latias, as well as opposing Gengar. Fighting- and Fairy-types such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie take care of Dark-types such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile; Terrakion can also be used to take care of non-Scrappy Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Porygon-Z and Porygon2. Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Porygon-Z, Porygon2, Mega Lopunny, and Stoutland take care of Choice Scarf users such as Tyranitar; Mega Lopunny also takes care of Mega Sableye with its Scrappy Fighting-type STAB moves. U-turn, Volt Switch, and Parting Shot users such as Mega Scizor, Magnezone, and Sableye help get Gengar in safely.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran's amazing defensive typing leaves it with only three weaknesses, as well as an impressive nine resistances, one immunity, and an immunity to two status conditions. Its stats enable it to run multiple sets, making it very unpredictable. It is able to check or counter many top-tier threats such as Kyurem-B, Thundurus, and Sableye. Its great natural bulk allows offensive sets to take hits even without investment and makes defensive sets tough to tear down. While its great support movepool allows it to help its team throughout the battle, its lack of setup moves sometimes gives it trouble against bulky foes, and it also lacks a form of reliable recovery. Additionally, it has a 4x weakness to a very strong and common attacking type in Ground, and its other two weaknesses are to types that are prevalent and strong. It also often suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, and its below average Speed tier hurts its longevity and attacking potential.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Heatran gains Metal Burst from STABmons, and due to its bulk it could run a surprise Metal Burst set to punish foes that hit it hard. Heatran could also run a RestTalk set with Fiery Dance, which has a 50% chance to raise its Special Attack stat. This set is outclassed, however, because of its unreliability and because of the many switch-ins opponents carry for Heatran causing it to switch out often, interfering with boosts and sleep turns. Heatran can also run a set of Substitute / King's Shield / Toxic and a Fire-type STAB move to wear down foes due to its great defenses.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Keldeo</strong>: Keldeo resists both of Heatran's STAB types and is able to hit back extremely hard with either of its super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Heatran</strong>: Heatran has trouble dealing with opposing Heatran because of Flash Fire and Air Balloon. If Heatran is carrying Earth Power, it relies on Speed ties to hope to take down other Heatran.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types resist both of Heatran's STAB types and are able to hit Heatran hard with a super effective Water-type attack. Starmie, Rotom-W, Azumarill, and Mega Blastoise make for good Heatran counters for this reason. However, these Pokemon are hit hard by Solar Beam.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Heatran is 4x weak to Ground, and Landorus-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Hippowdon are all tanky enough to take a hit or outspeed it and OHKO it with their super effective STAB moves. Dugtrio can also give Heatran trouble by trapping and KOing it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Specially defensive walls such as Chansey, Meloetta, and Porygon2 serve as good counters to Heatran. They are able to take Heatran's attacks and either heal off the damage (in the case of Chansey and Porygon2) or set up to sweep (in the case of Meloetta).</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Because of Heatran's typing, Fighting-types such as Terrakion can give it trouble.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Because Heatran doesn't have access to any reliable recovery, it can be easily worn down by residual damage such as Leech Seed.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Lava Plume hits reasonably hard and has a 30% chance to burn. Doom Desire is a hard-hitting STAB move that allows Heatran to hit the foe two turns later and has great synergy with King's Shield and Roar, letting Heatran buy turns for the move to hit and force switches. Doom Desire hitting at the end of the second turn after it is used also makes it good for bypassing Protect and breaking Substitutes. King's Shield protects Heatran from attacks and lowers the foe's Attack by two stages if they use a contact move. Roar allows Heatran to phaze opposing setup sweepers and racks up Stealth Rock damage on the foe. Earth Power is important to damage opposing Heatran and other Steel- and Fire-types. Stealth Rock is an option to help support Heatran's team and help wear the opposing team down as they switch in over the course of battle. Taunt helps Heatran check stall-oriented foes and prevent them from hurting your team. Will-O-Wisp is another option for Heatran to guarantee a burn on foes, although it has some issues with accuracy. Searing Shot is an alternative to Lava Plume that hits harder and has the same burn chance. However, it only has 8 PP.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP and Special Defense investment guarantees Heatran survives Earth Power from Mega Diancie and gives it great overall bulk. A Calm nature increases Heatran's already impressive Special Defense even more. Flash Fire makes Heatran immune to Fire-type moves, making it the perfect switch-in to opposing Fire-types. The remaining 36 EVs are flexible. You can add them to Special Attack to let Heatran hit a little harder, or you can add them to Speed to creep common foes. Alternatively, you can add them to Defense or maximize Special Defense to make Heatran more bulky. Leftovers serves as Heatran's only form of recovery. You could also run 248 HP / 56 SpA / 204 SpD with a Calm nature to allow Heatran to survive Earth Power from opposing Choice Scarf Heatran and KO back. 248 HP / 192 SpD / 68 Spe is an alternative spread that can be used if you run Taunt. This spread allows Heatran to outspeed Mega Venusaur, Suicune, and Mandibuzz.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Heatran can switch into many special attacks because of its high Special Defense. It is best used early in the game to eliminate threats for your sweepers or to crack the walls the opponent has. This Heatran set is an amazing switch-in to Sableye, as it is immune to Will-O-Wisp, and Doom Desire can take out Focus Sash + Destiny Bond versions. It is also an amazing switch-in to the many Fake Out + Extreme Speed foes you will face, such as Stoutland. It is a good idea to use King's Shield on the first turn after using Doom Desire to scout what the opponent does and buy a turn towards Doom Desire hitting. The second turn, if they have an obvious Doom Desire switch-in like Chansey or Heatran, you may want to use Roar to force another foe to take the damage. If you carry Stealth Rock, you want to set it up as soon as possible. Because of Heatran's bulk, it can be used to phaze many setup sweepers.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This variant of Heatran works well with entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Garchomp, whose Spikes, Stealth Rock, or Toxic Spikes can help wear down the opposing team over the course of the battle. Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Mega Venusaur also work as good teammates for Heatran, resisting two of Heatran's weaknesses in Water and Ground and being able to hit such Pokemon back with a super effective STAB attack. Heatran in return resists or is immune to all of the types Grass is weak to. Hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise and Landorus-T work well with Heatran, preventing it from being worn down by residual damage over the course of the battle. Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, Clefable, Landorus-T, and Thundurus also make for good team options for Heatran, being able to cover one of its weaknesses. Flying-type teammates especially work well because they are are immune to the Ground-type moves that plague Heatran, and they resist the Fighting-type moves that it doesn't like while also being able to hit their users hard.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Blue Flare allows Heatran to hit opposing Pokemon hard, but it has two downsides in below average accuracy and only 8 PP. It outpowers Eruption once Heatran is at 86% health or lower. Earth Power is good for hitting other Fire-type foes that would otherwise give Heatran troubles, such as opposing Heatran. Hidden Power Ice allows Heatran to hit common foes hard such as Latios, Latias, Landorus-T, and other Flying-types. Flash Cannon is Heatran's secondary STAB move that hits Rock- and Fairy-type foes hard. Eruption is a powerful STAB option that hits at a maximum Base Power of 150 when Heatran is at full health. Alternatively, Ancient Power allows Heatran to hit Flying-types hard, as well as foes with Levitate. Searing Shot is another powerful Fire-type STAB option for Heatran if the accuracy of Blue Flare and unreliability of Eruption scare you. It still hits hard and carries a burn chance, but like Blue Flare, this move only has 8 PP. Stone Edge is another alternative to Ancient Power that is capable of OHKOing Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature increases Heatran's Speed. Along with the Speed EVs and Choice Scarf, it allows Heatran to outspeed base 135 Speed foes, including Mega Manectric and Mega Lopunny. Flash Fire makes Heatran immune to Fire-type moves while raising the power of its Fire-type moves if it is hit by one.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Offensive Heatran works better as a late-game cleaner after its checks have been eliminated. It still has great natural bulk even uninvested, allowing it to switch into many threats and then hit back hard. Choice Scarf sets make for great revenge killers. Try to switch Heatran into resisted hits such as Grass-, Ice-, and Fairy-type moves to keep it around longer. It is probably the best status sponge in the metagame, being immune to Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, making it a great switch-in to foes that you expect to use a status move. Watch out for Knock Off, as losing its Choice Scarf hurts this set. Similarly, watch out for Thunder Wave from foes such as Porygon2 and Chansey.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grass-types such as Celebi and Mega Venusaur serve as great teammates because they resist both of Heatran's weaknesses and Heatran resists almost all of theirs. Heatran also appreciates entry hazard control from teammates such as Mega Blastoise and Defog Landorus-T, as it will switch in a fair number of times and appreciates not taking residual damage each time it does. Flying-types such as Talonflame, Landorus-T, and Thundurus are also good teammates for Heatran, as they resist Fighting-types' STAB moves and are able to hit them back hard. Heatran also takes care of Rock- and Steel-types that they don't like. Entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon make for great teammates to help bring foes into OHKO range. As the Choice Scarf's lock-in can allow foes to set up on Heatran, a good teammate would be an Unaware user such as Clefable or Quagsire or a Fake Out + Extreme Speed user like Stoutland. Heal Bell support from a teammate such as Chansey is appreciated in case Heatran gets paralyzed.</p>"
      },
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Magma Storm is a high-powered move that traps the foe for four to five turns. It does, however, have awful accuracy. Earth Power provides almost perfect neutral coverage in tandem with Magma Storm as well as the added benefit of hitting opposing Fire-types, including Heatran. Taunt stops support Pokemon and setup sweepers, and if they're trapped with Magma Storm, it can render them useless. Toxic paired with Magma Storm damage wears down foes very quickly. Solar Beam is another option that can be used to hit unsuspecting Water-types hard on a predicted switch. King's Shield is another option to allow Heatran to stall while forcing the foe to take damage from Magma Storm and possibly Toxic for another turn. Will-O-Wisp can also be run to lower the foe's Attack and add damage on them each turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Timid nature and maximum Speed investment allow Heatran to outspeed as much as possible, which is important when trying to Taunt the foe. The 252 EVs in Special Attack allow Heatran to deal the most damage to the foe while trapping it. Leftovers serves as Heatran's only form of recovery. Power Herb allows Heatran to use Solar Beam once without a charge turn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set can be used to take out passive foes such as Chansey and Porygon2 by Taunting them to prevent paralysis and recovery and wearing them down with Magma Storm and Toxic. If you run Solar Beam, prediction is key, as Power Herb only works once. Only use it when you're sure the opponent is going to switch into something that it will hit super effectively. Solar Beam can also be used once the foe is trapped by Magma Storm. Because of its lack of recovery, Heatran appreciates having the field kept clear of entry hazards. This set should be used early in the game to eliminate strong defensive foes to allow Heatran's teammates to sweep late-game. Because of Heatran's great typing and defensive stats, it can also switch into many offensive threats and either force the opponent to switch or trap the foe and wear them down.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Terrakion and Garchomp work well to wear down foes. Ferrothorn is another option and has good synergy with Heatran. Hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise, Latios, and Landorus-T are appreciated. Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur work well with Heatran, as they resist Heatran's Ground and Water weaknesses and are able to hit users of those moves back with a super effective attack. Heatran resists all of their weaknesses. Celebi has great type synergy with Heatran, resisting all three of Heatran's weaknesses and hitting back super effectively, while Heatran is immune or resistant to five of its seven weaknesses. Sweepers such as Kyurem-B, Azumarill, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Charizard Y appreciate having special walls such as Chansey and Porygon2 removed.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Blue Flare is Heatran's primary STAB option and hits foes hard. It does, however, have shaky accuracy. Searing Shot is an alternative to Blue Flare, trading power for accuracy and a burn chance. Both of these moves have low PP, though. Earth Power paired with a Fire-type STAB move gives Heatran near-perfect neutral coverage, and it also hits other Fire-types hard. Doom Desire is a powerful secondary STAB move that hits two turns after it is used, allowing Heatran to bypass Substitutes. Flash Cannon is an alternative to Doom Desire and can be used to hit relatively hard immediately. Stealth Rock allows Heatran to support its team with residual damage. Hidden Power Ice is an alternative option to hit foes such as Landorus-T. Alternatively, Autotomize raises Heatran's Speed by two stages and can be used to set Heatran up to sweep.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum EVs in Speed paired with a Timid nature help Heatran outspeed as much as possible. Maximum EVs in Special Attack allow Heatran to deal as much damage as possible. Air Balloon gives Heatran an immunity to Ground-type attacks until it takes a hit. Shuca Berry is an alternative to Air Balloon that halves damage from Ground-type moves once. It has the benefit of only being used up when hit by a Ground move, so because of Heatran's typing and bulk, it is sometimes preferable.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set works well as a late-game cleaner, when its checks and counters have been eliminated and the remaining foes have been weakened. If running Air Balloon, Heatran can switch into a predicted Ground-type attack. If you run Doom Desire, many times the opponent will switch on the turn it will hit. Prediction is key here; try to predict which teammate they will go into and either double switch to put you in a good position or hit the switch-in hard with a coverage move. If you run a support move in the fourth slot, use that on a turn you predict the foe is going to switch.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon work as good teammates for Heatran. A stallbreaker such as Mega Charizard X works well with offensive Heatran to take out specially defensive walls such as Chansey and Porygon2. Status spreaders such as Chansey, Porygon2, and Sableye help Heatran by either wearing down foes over the battle or slowing them down with paralysis to allow Heatran to easily outspeed and damage them. Grass-types such as Celebi, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur have good type synergy with Heatran and work to form part of a Fire / Water / Grass core.</p>"

  "Blastoise": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Blastoise is one of the best wallbreakers in the STABmons metagame thanks to its hefty Special Attack stat and very helpful ability in Mega Launcher that boosts Origin Pulse to a 165 Base Power move while also making its coverage options like Dark Pulse and Aura Sphere hit significantly harder. Mega Blastoise's access to Rapid Spin makes it helpful for teams that need entry hazard control. It also has above-average bulk and a good defensive typing, boasting only two weaknesses. However, Mega Blastoise does have its shortcomings, namely its lack of boosting moves and its lack of reliable recovery, which make it unable to break through dedicated special walls and leave it more easily worn down over the course of a game. Mega Blastoise also takes up the team's Mega slot, removing the possibility of running other very powerful and useful Mega Evolutions. Mega Blastoise's subpar Speed also limits its sweeping potential late-game, and, as regular Blastoise is not viable in STABmons, its item choice is restricted to its Mega Stone. Lastly, the Mega slot can be freed up by replacing Mega Blastoise with other powerful Water-types such as Keldeo, which offers a secondary typing, and Starmie, which can do many of the things that Mega Blastoise can and also has access to Rapid Spin.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A RestTalk variant of Mega Blastoise can work very well on certain teams, as this combination greatly boosts Mega Blastoise's longevity while sacrificing some of its wallbreaking potential. Other viable moves that Mega Blastoise can run include Roar and Dragon Tail, which provide phazing support for the team. It is possible to run a defensive EV spread in conjunction with Scald, Dragon Tail or Roar, Rapid Spin, and Ice Beam. A set based on Mirror Coat is an alternative option, although it has a pretty small niche to surprise opposing special attackers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey walls Mega Blastoise to no end, and because of Mega Blastoise's inability to set up, it really has no way of getting around Chansey or other special walls that resist its coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Serperior, Mega Venusaur, and Whimsicott can be very annoying for Mega Blastoise to deal with, as they can use Spore to put it to sleep and can hit hard with Giga Drain and Leaf Storm. Ferrothorn also falls into this category; if Mega Blastoise does not have Aura Sphere, it can be really difficult to break through Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Both Thundurus formes can check Mega Blastoise pretty well, as they can OHKO it with a Life Orb-boosted Thunderbolt; other fast Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Raikou are also a nuisance for Mega Blastoise to deal with. While Electric-types cannot switch into Mega Blastoise safely, they force it out once they are on the battlefield.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types resist Origin Pulse and thus can give Mega Blastoise problems. Some of them, such as Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Gyarados, can beat it regardless of the coverage moves it is running, while others, such as Slowking and Slowbro, can deal with it depending on which moves Mega Blastoise has. Manaphy also only takes neutral damage from Mega Blastoise's common coverage moves and can set up using Tail Glow and then fire back with Energy Ball.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dragon-types</strong>: Kyurem-B can tank hits from Mega Blastoise even after Stealth Rock damage and can hit back hard, OHKOing depending on the set it is running. There's really nothing in Mega Blastoise's arsenal that lets it win in this one-on-one situation, so a partner to check this threat is important. Latios and Latias can also threaten Mega Blastoise and potentially set up Calm Mind on it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Origin Pulse is the only reason to run Mega Blastoise in STABmons, as Mega Launcher boosts its Base Power from 110 to 165, which is even more powerful than Water Spout at full health. Ice Beam is a great coverage move, as two of the three types that resist Water are weak to it, namely Grass and Dragon, allowing Mega Blastoise to hit some of its checks, including Amoonguss and Latias. Rapid Spin allows Mega Blastoise to clear entry hazards from its side of the field, and Ghost-types have a hard time switching into Mega Blastoise because of its access to Mega Launcher-boosted Dark Pulse and Origin Pulse. The last slot is up to the user's preference. Aura Sphere is nice to hit Ferrothorn, Mega Gyarados, and Kyurem-B for good chunks of damage, while Dark Pulse has excellent neutral coverage in conjunction with Origin Pulse and comes in handy against some common Pokemon that resist Water such as Slowking, Slowbro, Latios, and Latias.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Blastoisinite allows Blastoise to Mega Evolve. A Modest nature is necessary to have Mega Blastoise hit as hard as possible, and it has no reason to run a Timid nature due to its mediocre Speed tier. The given Speed EVs allow Mega Blastoise to outspeed uninvested defensive Landorus-T. The remaining EVs are put into HP so that Mega Blastoise can survive for as long as possible, as it lacks any form of recovery. Mega Launcher makes Mega Blastoise's aura and pulse moves extraordinarily powerful, allowing it to OHKO a lot of common Pokemon in STABmons. There's also the option to run a faster EV spread of 24 HP / 252 SpA / 232 Spe, which lets Mega Blastoise outpace Adamant Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Blastoise should be mainly used on offensive or balanced teams due to its ability to break through walls, making it easier for its teammates to sweep. Mega Launcher-boosted Origin Pulse is one of the most powerful special attacks in the metagame, so it should be spammed as often as possible. Mega Blastoise is able to force out many common Pokemon in the tier such as Heatran, Weavile, Tyranitar, and Landorus-T, which gives it the opportunity to remove entry hazards or deal damage to the Pokemon coming in on the switch. Mega Blastoise doesn't appreciate being burned, but it isn't game ending. Don't forget to use Rapid Spin, as getting rid of entry hazards is always nice.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The biggest threats to Mega Blastoise are Chansey and other specially defensive Pokemon, so a physical wallbreaker such as Terrakion, Aerodactyl, or Infernape is a really nice companion for Mega Blastoise. Fast Electric- and Grass-types also threaten Mega Blastoise; Thundurus in particular is troublesome, so Pokemon that can deal with it such as Excadrill, Kyurem-B, Thundurus-T make for great partners. Grass types help to absorb Electric- and Grass-type moves that can really trouble Mega Blastoise; in this regard Ferrothorn makes for a nice defensive partner, while Serperior can make for a good offensive partner. Flying-types such as Talonflame, Thundurus, and Landorus-T appreciate Mega Blastoise's ability to remove Stealth Rock and can also deal with some some of Mega Blastoise's Grass-type checks in return. Pokemon with access to moves like Sticky Web and Thunder Wave that can help with Mega Blastoise's low Speed are very helpful as well. Scizor is a common Sticky Web setter, while a Pokemon like Thundurus can use Thunder Wave to support Mega Blastoise.</p>"

  "Beedrill": {
    "overview": "<p>While regular Beedrill has mediocre Speed, this is remedied when it Mega Evolves. Mega Beedrill also has an amazing Attack stat, which is one of the highest in the STABmons metagame, as well as great coverage with Drill Run, and it hits incredibly hard with Adaptability-boosted U-turn and Gunk Shot. Moreover, while U-turn isn't the strongest Bug-type move, it helps Mega Beedrill's team gain momentum easily and is a good utility move, as is Knock Off. Sadly, Mega Beedrill has lackluster bulk, which means that it's easily KOed by everything and loses to priority, especially Fake Out + Extreme Speed. It is also a Mega Evolution that offers little to no defensive utility, and its weakness to Stealth Rock leaves it worn down quickly and is dentrimental to its role as a pivot. Not only that, Mega Beedrill also faces competition from Mega Scizor; however, while Mega Beedrill is weak to Stealth Rock and has to waste a moveslot on Protect, it has better Speed, can easily gain momentum with a fast U-turn, and its Poison-type STAB and larger range of coverage make it a good option.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance or Coil can be run over Drill Run to allow Mega Beedrill to hit a lot harder; however, this means it has no reliable way of hitting Steel-types and will probably need to switch out when facing them. If you run Swords Dance or Coil, make sure to use Megahorn over U-turn. Toxic Spikes can also be run over Drill Run to help Mega Beedrill and its teammates KO foes more easily; however, the same issue with lack of coverage still applies. Pursuit can also be run over Drill Run to let Mega Beedrill Pursuit trap opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types. All of these moves can be run over Protect too; however, this is extremely risky, as it makes it difficult for Beedrill to Mega Evolve.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Ice Shard Weavile and Kyurem-B, Sucker Punch Hoopa-U, Weavile, and Tyranitar, Water Shuriken Gyarados and Azumarill, and Fake Out + Extreme Speed Mega Lopunny, Porygon-Z, and Stoutland all easily KO Mega Beedrill because of its terrible base 40 Defense.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Heatran, Skarmory, Forretress, and Klefki all easily render Mega Beedrill useless because it can't hit them very hard. However, Heatran and Klefki should watch out for Drill Run, and Skarmory and Forretress dislike Knock Off immensely.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users, specifically those with over base 80 Speed, such as Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Keldeo, can outspeed and KO Mega Beedrill with Diamond Storm, Dragon Ascent, and Water Spout, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, Quagsire, Hippowdon, Gyarados, and Gliscor can survive a hit from Mega Beedrill. Mega Scizor resists U-turn, is immune to Gunk Shot, and takes neutral damage from Drill Run and can set up and KO it; Landorus-T has Intimidate to weaken Mega Beedrill, has enough bulk to survive its attacks, and has the movepool to easily get rid of it; and Quagsire, Hippowdon, Gyarados, and Gliscor survive any hit from it and can easily KO it in return.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Protect lets Beedrill safely gain its boost in Speed when it Mega Evolves; it also lets Mega Beedrill scout for coverage moves that the foe might have or for potential Choice items. U-turn takes care of Psychic-, Grass-, and Dark-types such as Meloetta, Mega Slowbro, Serperior, and Hoopa-U, and it lets Mega Beedrill gain momentum. Gunk Shot is Mega Beedrill's strongest move, and it lets it easily take care of Grass- and Fairy-types such as Serperior and Clefable; its chance to poison foes is also very useful. Drill Run lets Mega Beedrill KO Steel- and Rock-types such as Heatran, Excadrill, Klefki, Magnezone, and Terrakion, while Knock Off lets it remove items from bulky Pokemon such as Shed Shell Skarmory, Rocky Helmet Landorus-T, and Leftovers Heatran, which cripples them severely, in addition to OHKOing Gengar. Megahorn can be used over U-turn to let Mega Beedrill hit extremely hard; however, while U-turn lets Mega Beedrill gain momentum, Megahorn lets it KO walls such as Mega Sableye and Hippowdon more easily.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature let Mega Beedrill hit as hard and move as fast as possible, letting it outspeed Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf users such as Tyranitar, Heatran, Aerodactyl, and Hoopa-U and Speed tie with Mega Sceptile. Adaptability lets Mega Beedrill hit extremely hard with its STAB moves to KO a plethora of Pokemon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to get Mega Beedrill into the field after a teammate is KOed or with a pivoting move. Use Protect while Mega Evolving to safely gain the needed boost in Speed; you don't need to use Protect when Mega Evolving against Pokemon that are slower than Beedrill. Early-game, try to U-turn out of physical walls such as Mega Scizor, Mega Slowbro, and Landorus-T and to scout for moves and allow teammates to have better matchups. Use Gunk Shot to KO Fairy- and Grass-types and to break down walls. Avoid priority users such as Prankster Sableye with Will-O-Wisp or Parting Shot, Water Shuriken Azumarill, Fake Out + Extreme Speed Mega Lopunny, and Talonflame and Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, so that Mega Beedrill isn't KOed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Physical walls and bulky Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Heatran, and Hippowdon are good teammates because of their ability to switch into Fake Out + Extreme Speed users. Entry hazard clearers such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, Latias, and Starmie help Mega Beedrill survive longer. Entry hazard setters such as Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Garchomp give Mega Beedrill an easier time KOing threatening foes. Fire-types such as Heatran and Rotom-H take care of the Steel-types that aren't weak to Drill Run in Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Porygon-Z and Porygon2, as well as Gale Wings Talonflame, are good for handling Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo. Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Keldeo take care of opposing Rock- and Steel-types such as Terrakion and Bisharp. Magnezone and Magneton can be used as partners, as they can easily trap Steel-types and KO or damage them. Terrakion also handles Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Porygon-Z and Stoutland. Other U-turn, Parting Shot, and Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T, Sableye, and Rotom-W help gain momentum too and absorb Fake Out + Extreme Speed.</p>"

  "Pidgeot": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Pidgeot is a very threatening Pokemon by virtue of its high Speed and Special Attack as well as its strong STAB moves. This is complemented by recovery in Oblivion Wing, which is excellent for maintaining momentum, and a very fast Sing. However, Mega Pidgeot is walled by common threats such as Heatran and Mega Tyranitar. It is very frail and thus vulnerable to priority moves, and it has a poor defensive typing that leaves it weak to common offensive moves and resistant to only two uncommon types. Mega Pidgeot has limited coverage options, although the few it does have are good, as they provide coverage against every type besides Rock. Furthermore, the cost of using a Mega Evolution in STABmons is extremely high due to the overwhelming competition for a Mega slot, so Mega Pidgeot is a very team-specific Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Fighting is an option to let Mega Pidgeot take on Tyranitar and to provide general coverage for Pokemon like Heatran. Tailwind is an option to provide general team support, but Mega Pidgeot is generally outclassed as a Tailwind setter by other setters such as Thundurus. Encore is a decent option due to Mega Pidgeot's very high Speed; however, it is often hard to find room for the move. Super Fang is a great way to weaken Mega Pidgeot's checks, dropping their HP to 50% or lower every time; however, it is unable to finish foes off and is hard to fit into Mega Pidgeot's moveset.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Mega Diancie and Tyranitar resist every move that Mega Pidgeot commonly runs and thus are very annoying for it to deal with. Unless Mega Pidgeot is running Hidden Power Ground or Fighting, it often finds itself forced to switch out against them. Mega Diancie in particular is a very consistent counter, as it bounces back Sing with Magic Bounce, resists Mega Pidgeot's STAB and coverage moves, and can easily OHKO it with Diamond Storm.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Mega Pidgeot is relatively frail, so it is very prone to being revenge killed by priority moves. It is especially weak to Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Braviary and Ursaring, which can 2HKO it before it can do anything, as well as Kyurem-B's Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran can easily take any move that Mega Pidgeot has and hit it back hard. It does need to be wary of the occasional Hidden Power Ground, though.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Mega Pidgeot's main niche lies in its excellent Speed tier, so faster Pokemon such as Weavile and Choice Scarf Terrakion really hamper its effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Paralysis, Trick Room, and opposing weather remove most of Mega Pidgeot's effectiveness, as it is only viable because of its high Speed. Thundurus is particularly threatening because it has priority Thunder Wave as well as super effective STAB moves. Cresselia and Politoed can also remove Mega Pidgeot's speed advantage, with Cresselia being able to set up Trick Room and Politoed bringing rain for teammates like Kingdra to take advantage of.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Boomburst is a very spammable STAB move that will 2HKO nearly anything neutral to it and even some frailer Pokemon that resist it. Hurricane is another very powerful STAB move that also has a chance to confuse the foe. Heat Wave is an essential coverage move that allows Mega Pidgeot to hit the Steel-types that would otherwise wall it, besides Heatran. Sing gives Mega Pidgeot free turns and allows it to do something even against Pokemon that would counter it. Hidden Power Ground is an option over Sing in order to KO Heatran after luring it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment and a Timid nature maximize Mega Pidgeot's Speed and Special Attack for the most offensive pressure possible. Putting 4 EVs in Defense instead of HP allows Mega Pidgeot to switch into Stealth Rock four times.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Boomburst is very spammable because of its sheer power and thus should be used freely if you are unsure of what to do. Don't let Mega Pidgeot get paralyzed, as its Speed is one of its biggest selling points and prevents it from being outclassed. Mega Pidgeot should not be brought in against anything with a priority move, as it will often get KOed due to its frailty; in this regard, switching it in directly is generally a bad idea. It is better to bring Mega Pidgeot in to revenge kill or off of a teammate's slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Avoid facing Fake Out + Extreme Speed users, as the combination of these two moves completely demolishes Mega Pidgeot.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Terrakion beats most of Mega Pidgeot's checks and counters with its powerful STAB moves, such as Chansey, Zapdos, Tyranitar, and Heatran. Porygon-Z and Mega Pidgeot can wear down each other's checks and counters and allow one or the other to win, with Porygon-Z and Mega Pidgeot overwhelming Rock-types. Users of Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot such as Raikou, Jolteon, Meloetta, and Sableye give Mega Pidgeot opportunities to get in unharmed and consequently spread more damage. Sylveon is also a good partner to pivot into so that it can wear down foes with its own Boomburst. Mega Pidgeot is worn down pretty quickly by Stealth Rock, so Pokemon that can remove the hazard such as Excadrill, Latias, and Starmie are great team options. Starmie can also remove bulky Rock-types if Mega Pidgeot is not running Hidden Power Ground. Weavile can weaken foes with Knock Off and soft check Thundurus with Icicle Crash.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>As one of the bulkiest Pokemon in the game, Chansey is the premier special wall of STABmons, being able to check or counter most special attackers thanks to its massive special bulk alongside Eviolite. Its Defense isn't too bad either, allowing Chansey to wall its fair share of physical attackers. Both of these traits are also augmented by a fairly decent typing that, while giving Chansey only one immunity and no resistances, also gives it but a single weakness to Fighting, and the few Fighting-type special attacks available mean that special attackers will rarely have any super effective moves to use against Chansey. In addition, thanks to its titanic HP stat and access to Eviolite, Chansey is the only Pokemon in the metagame that can make use of Transform. However, Chansey is prone to being worn down given that it lacks Leftovers and is very reliant on its Eviolite, so it despises both Knock Off and Trick. In addition, the pink blob has a hard time taking on Psychic-types effectively, as Psystrike targets Chansey's weaker Defense stat, and it must rely on support moves and Seismic Toss in order to pose any direct threat to the opponent's team due to its abysmal attacking stats. Such reliance on support moves also makes it weak to Taunt, especially from Ghost-types and Pokemon with 101 HP Substitutes. Finally, while Chansey has many move choices in its arsenal, it may have trouble deciding on four of them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave cripples attackers and rids potential Speed ties after Chansey uses Transform, so it is a good choice on balanced teams. A full Baton Pass set with moves such as Substitute and Belly Drum is possible, but it requires several moveslots and limits Chansey's utility outside of Baton Passing. Given its low Speed, it is also easy to force Chansey out before it can pass along any stat boosts. Rapid Spin allows Chansey to get rid of entry hazards, but it is blocked extremely easily by almost all Ghost-types and is hard to fit onto Chansey's moveset; moreover, Chansey takes full damage from entry hazards when switching in. Stealth Rock can be used, but Chansey usually cannot find the space and would much rather be running another support move in its place. Encore can be disruptive to setup sweepers, but it doesn't do much that Seismic Toss and Transform don't already do. Perish Song works mostly like a delayed Whirlwind that can force out Magic Bounce users and deal with the opponent's last Pokemon, but it is generally inferior to Whirlwind. It can also be used on a Perish trapping set alongside Mean Look, but this usually backfires when the opponent knows what you're doing. Lovely Kiss can put potentially disruptive Pokemon to sleep and turn momentum to your favor. Finally, Noble Roar can weaken attackers that attempt to switch in and can help rack up entry hazard damage in the process, but it is generally inferior to Chansey's other options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Lucario can wallop Chansey for super effective damage on its low Defense stat, either forcing it out or dealing massive damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Due to only having access to Seismic Toss under Taunt, Chansey is relatively easy to take advantage of after being hit with the move. Therefore, Taunt users such as Thundurus are able to break down Chansey after depriving it of Recover and Transform. Ghost-types with access to Taunt such as Gengar and Sableye deserve a special mention given their immunity to Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick Users</strong>: Both of these moves remove Chansey's Eviolite, decreasing its bulk and making it easier to break through.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Tyranitar, which can break through Chansey's weaker Defense stat, are very dangerous for Chansey, but due to Transform, it is imperative that these Pokemon are paired with other Pokemon capable of countering them so that your team does not get swept by one of your own attackers.</p> <p><strong>Psystrike Users</strong>: Psystrike users such as Meloetta and Latios can crack down on Chansey's weaker Defense stat despite being special attackers.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Baton Pass gives Chansey's teammates a free switch thanks to Chansey's low Speed. It allows Chansey to pose a threat to the foe by stealing momentum via freely switching into the appropriate check to the opponent's Pokemon and also gives Chansey the ability to scout foes. Transform allows Chansey to transform into the foe. Because of Transform's mechanics, Chansey retains its base HP stat and the effects of Eviolite, so it becomes an extremely bulky version of your opponent's Pokemon. It also copies any stat boosts the foe may be carrying, deterring the foe from setting up on Chansey and forcing otherwise dangerous special sweepers to flee out of fear of being swept. Despite the benefits of Transform, Wish is also a usable move in the second slot to fully heal a teammate alongside Baton Pass, though the set becomes less threatening overall. Seismic Toss breaks Substitute, which blocks Transform, allows Chansey to act when Taunted, and also helps it wear down threats such as Heatran that may stay in on Chansey. Recover keeps Chansey healthy and allows it to keeping pivoting and transforming into enemy Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Transform's efficiency and gives Chansey maximum physical bulk, allowing it to check physical attackers with Transform. A Relaxed nature bolsters Chansey's Defense while lowering its Speed, ensuring that it moves last and can get teammates in for free with Baton Pass. The IV spread gives Chansey Hidden Power Ice while transformed, increasing its effectiveness against opposing Pokemon with Hidden Power. An IV spread of 0 Atk / 0 SpA / 0 Spe is also possible should Hidden Power Fire be desired. Chansey's Speed and Attack IVs are minimized in order to make Baton Pass as slow as possible and make Chansey take less confusion and Foul Play damage, respectively. Eviolite increases Chansey's defenses both in its base forme and while transformed, giving it considerable physical bulk and immense special bulk in base forme and almost impregnable defenses after transforming. Natural Cure allows Chansey to pivot against status inducers without many drawbacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set's primary role is to switch in on special attackers such as Thundurus and Heatran that cannot threaten Chansey and then to use Baton Pass to get another one of your Pokemon into the game with few drawbacks. Given Baton Pass's invaluable utility for keeping momentum, this variant of Chansey will almost always be using the move. If using Wish, Baton Pass should be used after Wish in order to allow the recipient to avoid taking potentially fatal damage before being restored to full or near-full health. Try not to let the foe get entry hazards on the field, as Chansey cannot use Leftovers and thus cannot restore its HP without sacrificing momentum with Recover. Should Chansey be facing a foe with Substitute and a setup move, Chansey can break Substitutes with Seismic Toss and threaten to use Transform when no Substitute is up. It is critical that Transform not be used if Chansey is low on health, as after transforming into a foe without recovery and absorbing an attack, Chansey will often be too weak to switch in again. Thanks to Natural Cure, Chansey can also pivot into status users such as Rotom-W and opposing Chansey, allowing you to get a Pokemon in without having it be crippled by a status ailment. However, be wary of taking status moves while transformed, as after transforming, Chansey no longer has Natural Cure to remove status conditions when switching out. Finally, it is advisable not to switch into Pokemon you think carry Knock Off or Trick, as without Eviolite, Chansey is much easier to damage in its base forme and Transform becomes less useful.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Sableye blocks entry hazards for Chansey, is immune to Fighting-type attacks, and has access to Parting Shot, meaning that it can pivot against physical attackers that Chansey is hesitant to pivot against. Defog or Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Stoutland is appreciated, as Chansey loathes entry hazards. Given that Chansey's bulk forces many switches, your own entry hazards from Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Heatran are also helpful. Frail attackers that do not like to switch directly into attacks, such as Gengar, Thundurus, and Serperior, benefit greatly from Chansey's utility as a pivot. Pokemon that are not frail but still prefer to avoid passive damage to extend their longevity such as Mega Blastoise and Togekiss are also great options. Other offensive Pokemon that aren't exactly frail or hesitant to take passive damage but still appreciate having a wall to fall back on due to frequent switching, or Pokemon are regularly targeted with special attacks, such as Mega Charizard X and Garchomp, are likewise ideal partners because Chansey helps them conserve momentum. Given that Chansey works well on VoltTurn teams, other users of U-turn, Volt Switch, and Parting Shot such as Scizor, Thundurus-T, and Hydreigon pair well with it. It is worth noting, however, that other Baton Pass users cannot be used alongside Chansey due to the Baton Pass clause.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Supporter": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Recover keeps Chansey healthy and allows it to continually counter special attackers. Wish allows Chansey to restore the HP of its teammates as well as itself, often fully healing its teammates considering its giant HP stat. Protect is an option alongside Wish, allowing Chansey to scout for moves such as Knock Off and Trick from the foe and letting Chansey reliably heal itself with Wish. It is, however, quite predictable and easily exploited, so Recover is usually the better option. It is also quite vulnerable to phazing. Heal Bell cures Chansey and its teammates of detrimental status ailments. Alternatively, Toxic helps Chansey rack up damage alongside Seismic Toss and helps deter attackers from switching in. Transform gives Chansey an offensive outlet to fight back against setup sweepers and most attackers in general, turning it into a very bulky version of the foe factoring in Chansey's base 250 HP and the Eviolite boost. Whirlwind is an alternative over Transform that allows Chansey to both rack up entry hazard damage and force out otherwise problematic attackers, but it comes at the cost of Transform's ability to restrict the opponent's sweepers. Seismic Toss is Chansey's main source of damage, allowing it to act under Taunt and break Substitutes, which block Transform.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread and a Bold nature make Chansey as bulky as possible, maximizing the effectiveness of Eviolite on its defenses. 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD is another possible EV spread that boosts the effectiveness of Wish and Transform, but it detracts from Chansey's special bulk, taking away from its ability to perform as an optimal special wall. The listed IVs give Chansey Hidden Power Ice, letting it combat Hidden Power users more easily after using Transform. An IV spread of 0 Atk / 0 SpA / 0 Spe is also possible should Hidden Power Fire be desired. Without Transform, however, maximum Defense IVs should be used because access to Hidden Power Ice is no longer needed. 0 Attack IVs minimize confusion and Foul Play damage. Eviolite increases Chansey's defenses both in its base forme and while transformed, giving it considerable physical bulk and immense special bulk in base forme and extremely high defenses after transforming. Natural Cure allows Chansey to function as a status absorber for the team.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Chansey should be used to wall special attackers such as Mega Blastoise and Heatran which are otherwise dangerous to stall teams. If using Wish and Recover, do not be afraid to use Wish often, as its recipient is always nearly fully healed, so Wish can serve as a scouting move of sorts, waiting for a potential switch and then healing the team's best answer to the foe. Try to use Heal Bell conservatively, as it does not have many PP. Toxic should be use to whittle down foes and put a timer on Chansey's main switch-ins. Transform should be used if you think the foe will set up, while Seismic Toss breaks Substitutes, which block Transform, from special attackers such as Togekiss. If running Whirlwind, it should be used whenever you suspect the foe is going to use a setup move or Substitute. It also serves as a useful scouting move by allowing you to identify Chansey's main switch-in and can be used to whittle switch-ins down with entry hazard damage. Finally, remain cautious and scout for Knock Off and Trick users, as these moves cripple Chansey. Protect is useful for scouting for these moves should you be running it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Quagsire walls physical setup sweepers capable of overwhelming Chansey such as Tyranitar and Mega Scizor. Landorus-T is another Ground-type that also strongly complements Chansey, as it has very high physical bulk alongside Chansey's special bulk and can absorb Fighting-type attacks. Defog or Rapid Spin users such as Mega Latias and Landorus-T are very helpful given that entry hazards wear Chansey down fairly easily. Chansey forces many switches, so an entry hazard user of your own such as Skarmory or Ferrothorn aids Chansey in accumulating damage. Pokemon that resist Psychic-type moves, such as Mega Latias, can deal with Psystrike attackers that otherwise break Chansey and can cover most of the metagame's special attackers in general. Pokemon that resist Dark or are able to take on attackers with Knock Off, such as Clefable and Mega Scizor, respectively, are useful for taking on Knock Off attackers that Chansey flees from.</p>"

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Gyarados is an extremely potent threat both offensively and defensively in STABmons. Its typing allows it to resist common offensive moves such as Earthquake, Iron Head, Origin Pulse, and Close Combat and gives it access to Roost, which greatly helps its walling and sweeping capabilities and allows it to check common attackers such as Mega Scizor and Heatran. Access to Intimidate further increases its ability to check physically offensive threats and provides it with more opportunities to set up.</p> <p>Access to Dragon Dance also allows Gyarados to be an extremely powerful offensive threat. Its Dark typing gained upon Mega Evolving gives Gyarados access to STAB on Crunch, which allows it to beat the likes of Slowbro easily. Gyarados also gains Mold Breaker when Mega-Evolved, which allows it to set up against Unaware users such as Quagsire and Clefable and hit Levitate users such as Rotom-W with Earthquake. Additionally, its Water / Flying typing gives it access to powerful STAB moves such as Crabhammer and Dragon Ascent. Its naturally high bulk and access to Roost make it difficult to revenge kill.</p> <p>However, Gyarados still has several exploitable weaknesses. Most notable is its 4x weakness to Electric, which is a common attacking type in STABmons. Gyarados's Mega Evolution also gives it a weakness to U-turn and Close Combat. Additionally, its coverage options are not strong enough to get past walls such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory. A weakness to Stealth Rock and common Rock-type coverage in Diamond Storm also reduces its longevity and forces it to Roost often to keep its HP up. It can also be checked by priority status users such as Thundurus and Sableye if it does not have a Substitute set up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Dragon Dance + 3 attacks set can be run for better coverage and more damage, but it gets easily worn down, revenge killed, or hit by status moves from Prankster users. Also, additional coverage moves such as Stone Edge and Ice Fang do not grant Gyarados much more relevant coverage than it already has, as Waterfall + Earthquake or Crunch covers most of the metagame already. Similarly, Gyarados can run 252 Atk / 252 Spe for maximum offensive presence, but this reduces its ability to switch into resisted moves and makes it more vulnerable to revenge killing. Gyarados can run a RestTalk + Dragon Dance set effectively, which gives it a way to remove status from itself, but it has less room than a Roost + Dragon Dance set for other moves. Gyarados can also run Water Shuriken for priority, but it is only +1 priority, so it does not help against Extreme Speed; however, the only other +1 priority move you will run into is Terrakion's Mach Punch, which is quite weak, and besides, having a couple of Dragon Dance boosts accomplishes a very similar result to using Water Shuriken. Gyarados is also fast enough after one boost to not really need priority moves. Defensively, Gyarados has access to Defog, but it takes away a moveslot from other useful support moves, and it is somewhat risky to run Defog on a Pokemon that is fairly slow and weak to Stealth Rock, as it can be pressured very easily. Scald can also be run to give Gyarados a chance to burn its foe, but it is weak and highly luck based. Brave Bird can be used on the Offensive Dragon Dance set as a solid STAB move to use prior to Mega Evolving.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types are especially threatening if Gyarados lacks Crunch. Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise and Slowbro can easily take a Waterfall and hit back with strong attacks or try to burn Gyarados with Scald. Rotom-W can easily wall Gyarados if it lacks Earthquake and can Volt Switch out to gain momentum. Quagsire can also easily wall non-Mega Gyarados sets.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type moves can easily OHKO Gyarados and can prevent offensive variants from setting up. Prankster Thundurus can use Thunder Wave to stop Gyarados's sweep short. Fast Pokemon such as Thundurus and Raikou can easily come in before Gyarados has boosted and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn can take even boosted hits from Gyarados, and they can be a huge nuisance if Gyarados lacks Taunt. Skarmory can easily phaze or use status moves on Gyarados to stop it from sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Fast Status Users</strong>: Prankster status users such as Sableye and Thundurus can shut down Gyarados's sweep if it doesn't have a Substitute up. Also, fast Pokemon such as Darkrai, Gengar, and Mega Sceptile can outspeed bulky Gyarados variants even after a boost and status it to stop its sweep. Focus Sash Alakazam is also a viable option, as it is a great answer to sweepers that lack multi-hit moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mono-attacking Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance is necessary to boost Gyarados's Attack and Speed and allow it to sweep. Waterfall is the preferred STAB move due to its decent power and flinch rate. Crunch can also be used as an attacking move, but Water has better coverage. Roost is necessary to keep Gyarados's health up so it can heal off weaker hits in the early-game and boost through the opposing team in the late-game. Roost also allows Gyarados to come in multiple times before attempting a sweep and handle Fake Out + Extreme Speed easily because of its massive bulk. Substitute is useful to stop status, prevent Gyarados from being revenge killed by Fake Out + Extreme Speed, and prevent Prankster users from stopping its sweep. Finally, Taunt can also be used to stop status and phazing, but Substitute is usually more useful, as it prevents revenge killing.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>152 Speed EVs allow Gyarados to outspeed maximum Speed Thundurus after one Dragon Dance. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP and Defense, along with an Impish nature, to maximize Gyarados's bulk and to provide easy setup opportunities; for example, Silk Scarf Ursaring's -1 Extreme Speed does 33% maximum, and 42% with Guts activated. Gyarados can also easily run a fully physically defensive spread to make it even harder to revenge kill, but this weakens its sweeping capabilities. Intimidate is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving because it gives Gyarados more opportunities to set up. After Mega Evolving, Gyarados gains Mold Breaker, which gives it the ability to break through Unaware, Sturdy, Water Absorb, and Storm Drain.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set should be used as a late-game cleaner against offensive teams. Therefore, do not allow it to be crippled by status moves. As non-Mega Gyarados has an arguably better defensive typing and access to Intimidate, it is better to keep Gyarados in its regular forme until it is ready to sweep. The immunity to Ground also makes it much easier to set up on Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. When Gyarados has Mega Evolved, it can easily set up on Slowbro and Slowking. When Gyarados ready to sweep, try to keep a Substitute up if possible so it can't get hit by Will-O-Wisps or Thunder Waves from Sableye or Thundurus, respectively, which can prevent its sweep. Substitute will also prevent Gyarados from being revenge killed by Fake Out + Extreme Speed and is able to block Transform from Chansey, allowing Gyarados to 2HKO it. Mega Gyarados can also be used as a powerful stallbreaker, as its high bulk and access to Roost make it difficult for stall teams to take down.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gyarados needs help clearing bulky Water-types and bulky Grass-types before it can sweep. Thundurus is excellent for this job because it can easily plow through those Pokemon with its STAB moves. Rotom-H and Raikou are good teammates because they can check the Electric-types that threaten Gyarados, and they can also use Volt Switch to gain momentum. Because Gyarados is weak to Stealth Rock, some form of entry hazard control is usually needed on your team. Excadrill is a good option to keep it off the field with Rapid Spin, and it can also provide offensive pressure. Alternatively, Landorus-T and Zapdos are good Defog users that can also use U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively, to gain momentum. Gyarados may also need a cleric if it gets hit by a status move before it has the opportunity to get a Substitute up. Clefable and Porygon2 are good defensive options, while Latios and Latias can provide support in the form of Lunar Dance while also providing Defog support. Stoutland is a great hazard remover with Rapid Spin, which can help Gyarados switch in easily. Serperior is a great teammate for Mega Gyarados, as it can break teams Gyarados struggles with, especially ones with faster revenge killers and physically defensive Pokemon. Kyurem-B is an amazing teammate for its ability to either clean weakened teams with a Choice Scarf set, heavily weaken teams with a powerful special attacking set, or overwhelm the opposing team with double Dragon Dance.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Gyarados's Attack and Speed to threatening levels. Waterfall is the preferred STAB move, as it hits hard and has solid coverage in the metagame. The second attacking move helps Gyarados get through some of its checks. Crunch is a solid STAB move that allows Gyarados to deal a large amount of damage to bulky Water- and Grass-types such as defensive Gyarados, Venusaur, and Ferrothorn and allows it to OHKO Latios and Latias. Earthquake hits more relevant threats such as Rotom-W and Heatran, and it is able to avoid the Attack drop from King's Shield on Steel-types, though Earthquake is generally weaker than Crunch. The last move gives Gyarados some utility. Roost allows Gyarados to keep its health up throughout the game and allows it to be played more defensively in checking threats. Taunt allows Gyarados to switch into defensive Pokemon easily and force them out, creating easy setup opportunities. Finally, Substitute helps it be more resistant to revenge killing; however, it costs 25% of its HP, which can make Gyarados a lot easier to handle considering it has no recovery.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This set aims to maximize Gyarados's Attack while taking advantage of its natural bulk to set up. Running 252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allows Gyarados to deal as much damage as possible. 152 Speed EVs ensure Gyarados outspeeds maximum Speed Thundurus after one boost. The rest of the EVs are put into HP to maximize bulk. Intimidate is the preferred ability, as it makes it easier to switch into physical attackers and set up on them. Moxie can be used to allow Gyarados to steamroll through weakened teams, but it does not create any additional setup opportunities. Gyaradosite allows Gyarados to Mega Evolve, gaining Mold Breaker and Dark typing along with STAB on Crunch. This allows it to break through Unaware and Sturdy, as well as hitting Levitate users such as Rotom-W with Earthquake, while being able to heavily damage Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Serperior with Crunch. Leftovers can be used over Gyaradosite if the Mega slot is occupied, which allows it to run Substitute with less risk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is an extremely potent cleaner against weakened teams. However, running two attacks means it can only afford one moveslot for a utility move, meaning you need to take more care when using offensive Gyarados to sweep. Try to make sure that all of Gyarados's checks and counters are weakened to the point where they can be KOed after a Dragon Dance, and do not attempt to set up if the opponent has a fast status user that can shut down Gyarados. If it is running Roost as its utility move, you can afford to use Gyarados as a check to certain threats and you can switch Gyarados in directly. Otherwise, make sure Gyarados does not take any unnecessary damage. If running Taunt, try to switch into slower threats that Gyarados can force out as, they will not be able to phaze or inflict status on it, and if running Substitute, try to keep the Substitute up prior to Prankster users coming in to avoid their priority Thunder Waves and Will-O-Wisps.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gyarados has high power and decent coverage, but it prefers to have the opposing team weakened before it sweeps. Thundurus is a great teammate that can easily deal with many of the Pokemon that give Gyarados trouble, such as Mega Venusaur, Skarmory, and defensive Gyarados. Raikou and Thundurus-T can easily counter Thundurus that try to revenge kill Gyarados. Landorus-T and Zapdos are good options for entry hazard removal, and they can both grant you momentum with U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively. Offensive Gyarados also highly appreciates cleric support from its team, as it has fewer options to protect itself than mono-attacking Gyarados. Latios is a great offensive option that provides Defog support as well as cleric support in the form of Lunar Dance. Serperior is a great teammate for this set, as it helps clean late-game and breaks teams that are capable of handling Mega Gyarados with its threatening Substitute + Spore set.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Roost restores Gyarados's HP, which allows it to continually check opposing threats. Waterfall is pretty powerful despite lacking investment, gives Gyarados an offensive presence, and has solid neutral coverage on the metagame. Thunder Wave allows Gyarados to cripple opposing sweepers and makes it easier for the rest of the team to deal with them. Roar and Dragon Tail both allow Gyarados to phaze sweepers, but both have drawbacks. Roar is the preferred phazing move, but it is stopped by Taunt, while Dragon Tail can be stopped by Substitute and Fairy-types and can miss.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This set maximizes Gyarados's physical bulk to allow it to continuously check common physical threats such as Excadrill and various Fake Out + Extreme Speed users. 8 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Adamant Azumarill. Gyarados can also run a specially defensive spread to check Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran better, but a physically defensive spread is usually preferred, as physically defensive Gyarados checks many more threats, takes better advantage of Intimidate, and still handles said Pokemon because Gyarados takes 41% at most from Mega Charizard Y's Blue Flare in sun. Leftovers keeps Gyarados healthy, though Rocky Helmet can be run to wear down opposing physical attackers. Gyaradosite can be used to boost Gyarados's bulk, but it takes up the Mega slot.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gyarados's great typing and defensive stats allow it to easily switch into threats such as Mega Scizor and Heatran and threaten them back by hitting them with its strong STAB moves or crippling them with Thunder Wave. Gyarados can use Roar to stop opposing Pokemon from setting up and potentially spread status throughout the opposing team. Because this set doesn't rely on massive damage output, avoiding status moves isn't as important. Intimidate makes it easier for Gyarados to check physical threats, but the given EV spread means that Gyarados can be taken down by strong physical threats if it has taken prior damage. As such, it is necessary to use Roost to keep Gyarados' health up from damage taken from attacks and Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gyarados benefits from Stealth Rock users, as it can use Roar to rack up hazard damage. Ferrothorn is a good entry hazard setter that has good defensive synergy with Gyarados, as it can take the Electric- and Rock-type moves that Gyarados has trouble with. Ferrothorn can also act as a cleric with Aromatherapy. Celebi can provide momentum with U-turn and Baton Pass, as well as provide helpful Spore support. Heatran is another good defensive option, as it offers phazing and Stealth Rock support for Gyarados, and Gyarados can take the Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-type moves that hurt Heatran. Gyarados also greatly appreciates a way to keep entry hazards off the field. Landorus-T is a great Defog user that can check Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Terrakion, which give Gyarados trouble. As Gyarados has no way of removing status from itself, it is useful to have a cleric on your team. Chansey is a good cleric that can tank extremely strong special hits, while Clefable is another option that can handle sweepers that get out of hand.</p>"

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to Imposter, which allows Ditto to transform into the foe and copy its stat boosts, it is one of the metagame's most potent revenge killers when equipped with a Choice Scarf. In addition to revenge killing, Ditto's ability allows it to scout the entire movesets of opposing Pokemon without them even revealing their moves, meaning that it is effectively the best scout in the game. While Ditto may not always get the opportunity to sweep the opponent's team with the team's own setup sweeper, its mere presence on the field is often enough to dissuade the foe from setting up, greatly limiting the effectiveness of their sweepers. However, due to its terrible HP stat, Ditto has a very hard time switching in, meaning that it must switch in either using pivoting moves such as Volt Switch and U-turn or when a teammate has fainted. Ditto also faces competition as a revenge killer from Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Stoutland and Ursaring, which, while not as effective as Ditto at revenge killing, aren't as one-dimensional and can accomplish other things outside that role. In addition, because of its Choice Scarf, Ditto cannot defeat defensive sweepers that cannot damage themselves sufficiently, such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Slowbro, and Clefable. Finally, Ditto's usefulness is largely dependent on the opponent's team, and it will rarely be able to do much to teams that are reliant on bulk as opposed to attacking power due to its Choice Scarf and low HP limiting its ability to function as a defensive Pokemon that it transforms into.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Opting to instead use status moves such as Whirlwind and Perish Song is not recommended, as Ditto's bulk is not sufficient to survive most attacks, especially boosted ones. Other Hidden Power types such as Grass are also usable, but they are not as useful as the listed types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Losing the ability to outspeed its foes is utterly crushing for Ditto, so Ditto becomes nearly useless when paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Bulky setup sweepers that cannot really harm themselves, such as Mega Gyarados and Shift Gear Heatran, are pretty much immune to being revenge killed by Ditto, as Ditto's Choice Scarf will be detrimental in these situations and the foe's ability to switch moves will allow it to beat Ditto.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: As Ditto cannot copy Pokemon behind a Substitute, maintaining a Substitute is an excellent way to make sure that Ditto cannot revenge kill its foe.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Users</strong>: Given that Ditto is mostly used to counter setup sweepers, having an Unaware user such as Quagsire or Clefable to fully shut down attackers it copies greatly hinders Ditto's overall usefulness.</p> <p><strong>Friendship-based Sets</strong>: While Ditto can make use of both Return and Frustration, it cannot do both simultaneously due to the mechanics of friendship. Frustration users will be able to beat maximum friendship Ditto, and Return users will be able to defeat minimum friendship Ditto.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room</strong>: As Choice Scarf makes Ditto slower under Trick Room, Ditto becomes very difficult to use when the field condition is active.</p> <p><strong>Unburden Users</strong>: Imposter does not copy Unburden's Speed boost, which means that Unburden users such as Slurpuff and Hawlucha can outspeed and defeat Ditto after using their item.</p> <p><strong>Zoroark</strong>: Zoroark beats Ditto when it has an active Illusion up, as Illusion blocks Imposter.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>While Ditto will rarely be using any of its listed moves because it will almost always be transformed, the given moves help Ditto cope with the few situations where Imposter does not activate. Extreme Speed, Ditto's most important move, allows it to strike at and break Substitutes, which block Imposter, allowing your teammates to better handle the Substitute user. The priority is crucial, as Ditto's horrid bulk will very rarely allow it to survive any hit. Fake Out allows Ditto to break Zoroark's Illusion without sustaining damage, which is important because Illusion blocks Imposter. Afterwards, Ditto can switch out and will be able to switch in on Zoroark again if need be. Boomburst allows Ditto to hit through Substitutes and potentially KO a weakened Pokemon, though it is only advisable to do this against weak attackers due to Ditto's frailty. Rapid Spin can be used to remove entry hazards against slow Substitute users if you know that your team is able to handle them and desperately needs entry hazards removed from the field.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf is necessary for Ditto to function, preventing Speed ties from determining the outcome of the game. Ditto's EV spread and nature maximize its HP while minimizing residual damage, and they also make Extreme Speed as strong as possible in order to break Substitutes. Because Imposter does not copy IV spreads, a spread of 30 Atk / 30 SpA / 30 Spe is recommended in order to possess Hidden Power Fire to give Ditto better coverage after transforming into sweepers that have Hidden Power in their movesets. Notable examples of sweepers that use Hidden Power Fire to obtain optimal coverage include Latios, Serperior, Yanmega, and Meloetta, all of which rely on the move to hit Steel-types. An alternate IV spread of 30 Atk / 30 Def is also a very viable option for Hidden Power Ice should Electric-types be giving your team trouble, as this Hidden Power type lets Ditto obtain better coverage after transforming into the metagame's various Electric-types such as Thundurus, Raikou, and Zapdos.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ditto should be used as a revenge killer due to its ability to transform into and outspeed almost any Pokemon that does not have its own Choice Scarf. It is advisable to use Ditto over Fake Out + Extreme Speed users on teams that require a more reliable revenge killer as opposed to extra utility. Due to the fact that Ditto can only Speed tie with the foe should it be holding Choice Scarf, it is highly recommended to make sure that the foe isn't holding a Choice Scarf or is at least locked into a harmless move before Ditto switches in. Try not to switch Ditto in directly, as even with maximum HP investment, its HP stat is not terribly high, and opposing sweepers usually do not have the best defenses. If you know that Ditto is needed to keep a certain threat in check, try to make sure that said threat can't get a free turn to use Substitute, as that prevents Ditto from being able to revenge kill it. Keep in mind that Ditto is able to switch into Pokemon with Volt Absorb and Water Absorb to regain HP on predicted Electric and Water-type moves, respectively. Should your team desperately need entry hazards removed from the field, it is possible to have Ditto copy the opponent's Defog user. This same concept applies to users of other utility moves, such as Heal Bell and Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>It is advisable to use Ditto on teams weak to offensive boosting Pokemon, as it functions as a check to almost all of them. Defensive Pokemon are commonly found on such teams, and Ditto can take advantage of the fact that most offensive teams generally rely on setting up to break through walls. Offensive teams vulnerable to foes boosting their Speed also appreciate Ditto's support. Defog or Rapid Spin from Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Stoutland is highly recommended when using Ditto, as Ditto takes damage in accordance to its Normal typing prior to transforming, meaning that it takes full damage from entry hazards. Pivots able to get Ditto in safely such as Chansey, Landorus-T, and Mega Sableye also function well alongside it to prevent it from taking direct damage when switching in.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl is one of the best Stealth Rock setters in STABmons; not only is it one of the fastest Pokemon in the metagame, it also has decent offensive presence. In STABmons, Aerodactyl is able to make excellent use of Rock Head, as it can take advantage of two insanely powerful STAB attacks in Brave Bird and Head Smash. With its access to Earthquake, it has nearly perfect neutral coverage. Unfortunately, Aerodactyl is very frail and offers almost no defensive synergy, although it can switch into Ground-type attacks in certain situations. In addition, despite having very powerful STAB attacks, they're only coming off a base 105 Attack stat so they don't hit overly hard. Aerodactyl also loses to common priority users, and has a weakness to Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Fang is a niche option, but it does offer a bit more coverage to hit Flying- and Ground-types super effectively and allows Aerodactyl not to be setup bait for Landorus-T and Garchomp. Fire Fang is also an option, as it 2HKOes foes such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn; however, it really doesn't hit much else. Aqua Tail covers Heatran while also hitting Ground-types such as Landorus-T hard, but it's not as powerful and misses out on a lot of OHKOs. Choice Band is an option to turn Aerodactyl into a fearsome wallbreaker. However, getting locked into the wrong move can give the foe a chance to setup and overall is more risky. Roost is an option, but again, due to Aerodactyl's terrible bulk it just won't be surviving enough hits for Roost to be viable in most situations. A Hone Claws set is worth a mention, but opportunities to set up are rare due to Aerodactyl's lack of bulk and it misses the coverage or utility of its last move slot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Aerodactyl dislikes dealing with physical walls, especially ones with Intimidate such as Landorus-T and ones with Rough Skin or Iron Barbs such as Garchomp and Ferrothorn. Mega Slowbro is also annoying for Aerodactyl to face, although it is somewhat Taunt bait; Jirachi is also a counter if Aerodactyl doesn't run Earthquake. Scizor, Tyranitar, and Porygon2 are able to either counter or check Aerodactyl.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Aerodactyl obviously can't perform well when asleep, burned, or paralyzed. Prankster status spreaders are the biggest problems, namely Sableye and Whimsicott, but any other status spreader that survives a hit can cripple Aerodactyl with Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: Common forms of priority OHKO or 2HKO Aerodactyl. Choice Band Bullet Punch or Water Shuriken from Scizor and Azumarill, respectively, can both OHKO. An Ursaring with Guts activated can KO with a combination of Fake Out + Extreme Speed. Jolly Life Orb Kyurem-B has a very high chance to OHKO with Ice Shard. Choice Band or Adamant Life Orb sets will always OHKO with it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Due to Aerodactyl's extremely high Speed stat and possible Focus Sash, it is nearly guaranteed to set up Stealth Rock. Head Smash's excellent 150 Base Power makes up for Aerodactyl's average Attack stat. STABmons gives Aerodactyl access to a good Flying-type STAB attack in Brave Bird as well. Because Rock Head makes Aerodactyl immune to recoil damage, Brave Bird becomes a perfectly accurate, 120 Base Power STAB move with no drawbacks. There are a few options for the fourth moveslot. Taunt is very useful for anti-leading other entry hazard setters, as it prevents them from getting their hazards up. Earthquake gives Aerodactyl perfect neutral coverage and allows it to hit a lot of its would-be counters, such as Heatran hard, possibly OHKOing them. Aerodactyl can hit nearly all of its checks or counters hard with the right move, which is another one of its good characteristics.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EVs maximize Aerodactyl's power and speed. Aerodactyl has terrible bulk, so investing in it would waste EVs. Running a Jolly nature instead of an Adamant one is important to let Aerodactyl outspeed and OHKO Jolly Talonflame without getting burned by Will-O-Wisp, as well as outspeed any Pokemon with base 115 Speed. Focus Sash nearly guarantees that Aerodactyl will set Stealth Rock up and allows it to survive a hit if it Taunts a foe that turns out to be attacking, such as Ferrothorn using Gyro Ball. Besides, Aerodactyl will get OHKOed by almost any powerful neutral hit, so Focus Sash allows it to survive the attack and get another move off. Life Orb is useful as well because Aerodactyl's base 105 Attack is not impressive, so it really appreciates the power boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Aerodactyl is usually a good choice for a lead, especially if it has Focus Sash, as it can toss Stealth Rock out early. If you do choose to lead with Aerodactyl, going for Stealth Rock or Taunt first is generally the smartest choice. Aerodactyl usually has terrible matchups against Magic Bounce users because they bounce back both Stealth Rock and Taunt and can either OHKO Aerodactyl in Mega Diancie's case or burn it with Will-O-Wisp in Mega Sableye's case; therefore, you should switch Aerodactyl out of them. However, if Aerodactyl is holding Life Orb, it does OHKO on Mega Diancie with Earthquake. Aerodactyl usually has trouble switching in because of its terrible bulk, but it can switch into Ground-type attacks during certain situations. You'll also want to avoid switching Aerodactyl in too often with Stealth Rock up because it loses a quarter of its health upon switching into it. The threat of STAB Head Smash or Brave Bird will cause a lot of switches, giving Aerodactyl another opportunity to set Stealth Rock if it was unable to earlier in the match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Aerodactyl works excellently with entry hazard control because it is weak to Stealth Rock. Latios and Latias are great options, as they resist Electric- and Water-type attacks, which Aerodactyl is weak to. Spinners are particularly good teammates, as they allow Aerodactyl's entry hazards to remain on the field. Starmie and Mega Blastoise work very well, as they can also deal with some of Aerodactyl's biggest checks, such as bulky Ground-types, particularly Landorus-T. Excadrill is also a potential spinner. Grass-, Water-, and Ground-types such as Serperior, Quagsire, and Landorus-T make for good teammates too, as they cover Aerodactyl's weaknesses to Water, Electric, and Rock and can help defeat its checks and counters. Prankster users such as Thundurus and Whimsicott are decent teammates because they beat a lot of threats to Aerodactyl, such as Sableye, Skarmory, and Quagsire. Defiant and Competitive users function perfectly with Aerodactyl, as they can deter Defog, snagging a free +2 boost to their Attack or Special Attack upon the foe's attempt to remove entry hazards. Powerful Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame have great synergy on the offensive side with Aerodactyl; they deal with most of Aerodactyl's biggest checks, such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn.</p>"

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>Quagsire is one of the best physical walls in the STABmons metagame because of Unaware, an excellent defensive typing that leaves it with only one weakness in Grass, and decent natural bulk. These attributes allow it to act as a blanket check to most setup sweepers. Its only weakness, Grass, is also rarely seen on physical attackers, and it has access to reliable recovery in Recover, which allows it to stay healthy. Thanks to these traits, Quagsire finds itself a home on many stall teams. However, it has mediocre Special Defense, making it ineffective at checking special attackers, and it generally lacks offensive presence. Its physical bulk is decent but not amazing, so it fails to wall more powerful physical attackers such as Life Orb Landorus-T and Azumarill. Quagsire's sets are also extremely predictable because they are usually all identical.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Yawn is an option over Toxic to cripple a lot of potential switch-ins, as it forces the foe to switch so that you can rack up entry hazard damage. Encore is also an option over Toxic; however, not having a status-inducing move removes Quagsire's ability to break through a lot of Pokemon. Curse is an option to give Quagsire stronger offensive presence. Ice Beam can be used to do more damage to Dragons such as Latias and Garchomp. Likewise, Precipice Blades is an option for a slightly more powerful Ground-type STAB move, but its extra power doesn't achieve anything notable, so it is generally the inferior choice to Earthquake. An offensive Quagsire set using Precipice Blades is a passable alternative for offensive teams weak to setup sweepers because of Quagsire's decent offenses and the surprise element. Haze is an option to beat Stored Power users, which can otherwise set up and beat Quagsire due to the actual Base Power of the move increasing. Protect is an option over either STAB move to let Quagsire gain a free turn of Leftovers recovery and rack up more damage with Toxic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Celebi and Serperior are the biggest threats to Quagsire because of its gaping 4x weakness to Grass, with even weak Grass-type moves often OHKOing it. Moreover, most Grass-types don't care about anything Quagsire can do.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Quagsire often fails to wall special attackers due to its low special bulk, so they generally force it out.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Any Taunt user can cripple Quagsire's effectiveness by preventing it from using Recover, but they should still be wary of Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Life Orb Landorus-T and Azumarill are able to 2HKO Quagsire, so it cannot wall them.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Setup Sweepers</strong>: Mold Breaker and its variants ignore Unaware, so Kyurem-B and Mega Gyarados can set up on Quagsire freely.</p> <p><strong>Status Inducers</strong>: Being burned or poisoned cripples Quagsire's effectiveness as a wall.</p> <p><strong>Stored Power</strong>: Stored Power users such as Latias can easily set up on Quagsire because the Base Power of Stored Power increases along with the stat boosts.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Recover is excellent for reliable recovery, as it allows Quagsire to have longevity as a wall. Scald is useful to give Quagsire the chance to burn physical attackers as well as Taunt users. Earthquake gives Quagsire passable offensive presence even when uninvested thanks to its high Base Power. Toxic is useful to wear down foes and break walls that Quagsire would normally be unable to break due to being relatively weak. Spikes is also an option, as Quagsire can set it up to support its team and accumulate some passive damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Unaware allows Quagsire to blanket check most setup sweepers. Maximum Defense and HP investment is used for maximum physical bulk, and a Relaxed nature is used because it lowers neither offensive nor defensive stats, and Quagsire doesn't care about outpacing opposing Pokemon. Leftovers gives Quagsire additional recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Quagsire is a great answer to physical setup sweepers and can freely switch into most of them if it is healthy. It can then force them out, getting free turns to stack Spikes or deal damage. However, some particularly strong physical attackers such as Life Orb Landorus-T and Azumarill will 2HKO Quagsire, so be aware that it cannot wall them. Do not leave Quagsire in on any Grass-type, as it won't be surviving a Grass-type attack no matter how bulky it is due to its 4x weakness to them. It also generally loses to special wallbreakers such as Meloetta and Sylveon because of its mediocre special bulk. Keep Quagsire healthy if your opponent has a likely setup sweeper such as Belly Drum Talonflame because you will need it to be healthy in order to win late-game. Remember that the foe's stat drops are also ignored by Unaware, so Quagsire can't deal with moves such as Draco Meteor easily, and keep in mind that a sweeper with Mold Breaker, Teravolt, or Turboblaze such as Dragon Dance Kyurem-B will usually break Quagsire because those abilities ignore Unaware. Avoid letting Quagsire get burned or poisoned because that hampers its effectiveness as a wall. Quagsire can freely switch in on almost any Electric-type Pokemon thanks to its immunity to their STAB moves and neutrality to Hidden Power Ice, which is an Electric-type's most common coverage move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Quagsire should be used on teams that are weak to setup sweepers, though it fits on stall builds a lot more than it does offensive builds, meaning that common stall teammates such as Skarmory and Mega Sableye are good options. Most defensive Flying-types such as Skarmory are good team options because they can absorb Grass-type attacks for Quagsire, and Quagsire can absorb Electric- and Rock-type attacks for them in return. Clerics such as Togekiss are excellent partners to heal Quagsire in the event it gets inflicted with a status ailment. Quagsire is easily worn down by Spikes and Toxic Spikes, so entry hazard removers such as Latias are useful teammates. Special walls such as Chansey and Clefable are good team options because they can absorb special attacks for Quagsire, while it can absorb physical attacks for them, and Clefable can also deal with special setup sweepers because it also has Unaware.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Scizor is a versatile and powerful physical attacker that brings plenty of utility to any STABmons team. Its typing gives it vital resistances to Dragon-, Fairy-, Ice-, Steel-, and Normal-type attacks, such as Kyurem-B's Icicle Crash, Sylveon's Boomburst, and the Fake Out + Extreme Speed combination. Its Mega Evolution has excellent physical bulk, which allows it to wall threats or set up with Shift Gear easily, while Life Orb and Choice Band give it incredible strength. However, Scizor is held back from completely dominating the metagame by its mediocre Special Defense stat, double weakness to Fire, and dependence on the unreliable Gear Grind and Pin Missile. Despite those negatives, Scizor's positive traits and ability to check or counter threats such as Kyurem-B, Landorus-T, Mega Diancie, Terrakion, Latios, Weavile, Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Ursaring firmly cement its place as a Pokemon that all teams should consider.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance sets are still usable, as the faster boost to Attack allows them to break through bulky Pokemon more quickly, but they overall perform worse against the speedy metagame. If the Mega slot needs to be kept open, regular Scizor can run the bulky Shift Gear set with Leftovers in place of Scizorite, but it's often let down by its relative frailty when compared to its Mega counterpart. Choice Scarf offers a speedy U-turn, Gear Grind, and Pursuit, but it's quite weak and still not very fast, making it a bad choice. Scizor can run neat Agility + Baton Pass sets, which passes boosts to Pokemon that can take advantage of baited Fire-types, such as Tail Glow Manaphy and Swords Dance Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon and Moves</strong>: Generally, any STAB Fire-type attack is capable of OHKOing Scizor. Heatran is only hit hard by Superpower, and Choice Scarf sets can beat defensive Shift Gear Scizor even at +2 Speed. Both Mega Evolutions of Charizard survive an attack and KO in return. However, it should be noted that Adamant Life Orb Scizor easily OHKOes Mega Charizard Y with a +1 Gear Grind. Rotom-H easily takes all attacks other than a +1 Superpower and OHKOes Scizor. Talonflame can OHKO Scizor or burn it with Will-O-Wisp and set up on it. Various other Pokemon can outspeed an unboosted Scizor and KO it with a Fire-type coverage move, such as Hidden Power Fire Latios and Fire Blast Garchomp.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos resists Gear Grind and Pin Missile and can OHKO Scizor in return with Heat Wave. Mega Manectric lowers Scizor's Attack with Intimidate and KOes with Flamethrower or Overheat. Magnezone can trap Scizor thanks to Magnet Pull and KO with Hidden Power Fire. However, the latter two Pokemon lose to offensive Shift Gear Scizor after a boost.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Suicune has amazing physical bulk and can burn Scizor with Scald. Keldeo resists both Gear Grind and Pin Missile and hits Scizor hard with Origin Pulse or revenge kills it with Vacuum Wave. Rotom-W comfortably takes attacks other than Pin Missile and can cut a Scizor sweep short with either Nuzzle or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Skarmory can always take a boosted hit from Scizor and Whirlwind it out while remaining healthy with Roost. However, it loses if Scizor is the last Pokemon on its team and therefore cannot be phazed. Quagsire tanks Scizor's attacks, with the exception of Pin Missile from offensive sets. It ignores Shift Gear boosts and can burn Scizor with Scald. Regular Sableye can use its priority Will-O-Wisp to cripple Scizor, while Mega Sableye can do the same but is forced to take a large amount of damage in the process. Generally, most physical walls are unable to deal with the awesome power of Gear Grind and Pin Missile.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Shift Gear": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shift Gear and Roost allow Mega Scizor to boost its Attack and Speed while remaining healthy throughout the whole battle. Gear Grind is Mega Scizor's main attack, and the boosts from STAB and Technician make it very strong. Knock Off has decent coverage and provides utility by removing items such as Heatran's Leftovers, Skarmory's Shed Shell, and Porygon2's Eviolite. Pin Missile hits Pokemon that resist Steel such as Rotom-W, Mega Slowbro, and Ferrothorn, but its coverage is very limited.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With maximum HP investment and 200 Special Defense EVs, Mega Scizor avoids the OHKO from Mega Diancie's Hidden Power Fire and the 2HKO from Mega Gardevoir's Focus Blast, both after Stealth Rock. The remaining 60 EVs are invested into Defense, which allows Mega Scizor to never be 2HKOed by Jolly Landorus-T's Precipice Blades or Dragon Ascent when used in conjunction with an Impish nature. A simple 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD EV spread is also an option, as Mega Scizor becomes capable of evading 2HKOs from powerful physical attacks such as Adamant Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick and Life Orb Terrakion's Close Combat. Scizorite drastically boosts Scizor's defenses, and Light Metal allows regular Scizor to take less Low Kick damage from Pokemon such as Weavile.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Mega Scizor shouldn't aim to set up and sweep early-game while the opponent's team is still healthy. Instead, it should pivot into the attackers that it walls, such as Tyranitar and Landorus-T, and use Knock Off and its STAB attacks to weaken the opposing team while remaining healthy with Roost. Keep this set away from crippling burns and paralysis, as well as powerful special attacks, especially Fire-type ones. When the opponent's team is weakened in the late-game, set up on a Pokemon that cannot deal significant damage to Mega Scizor, such as Tyranitar or defensive Landorus-T. Thanks to its excellent bulk, this Mega Scizor set can grab multiple boosts in front of these Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Mega Scizor variant is a good choice for balance teams that enjoy the presence of a reliable sweeper that can provide defensive synergy thanks to its access to recovery. Generally, it needs help from teammates to break through its checks and counters. Water-types deal with Fire-types such as Heatran, and some of them can also handle Keldeo. Slowbro can handle non-Choice Specs Keldeo while slowing down threats with Thunder Wave, while Rotom-W can also paralyze with Nuzzle and pivot with Volt Switch. Latios and Latias are capable of handling Keldeo and Fire-types, especially if they run Surf, and provide Defog and Lunar Dance support. Kyurem-B has excellent offensive synergy with Mega Scizor, as it can heavily damage Skarmory with Fusion Bolt and freely set up on Rotom-W with Substitute + Dragon Dance.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Shift Gear": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shift Gear boosts Attack and Speed, and with this Scizor's incredible power and coverage, it can destroy teams after just one boost. Gear Grind is boosted by STAB and Technician, making it incredibly powerful. Pin Missile has the potential to be even stronger, and hits bulky Pokemon that resist Steel such as Jirachi, Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Mega Slowbro hard. However, Scizor is often troubled by its varying damage output. Superpower is necessary coverage for Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn and also deals heavy damage to Keldeo at +1 Attack.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>When used alongside a Jolly nature, 204 Speed EVs allow Mega Scizor to outspeed Choice Scarf Keldeo and Terrakion at +2 Speed. The Attack EVs are then maximized and the remaining EVs are invested in HP to improve Mega Scizor's overall bulk. Scizorite allows Scizor to Mega Evolve and increase its Attack and defenses, which eases setup and reduces damage from Knock Off. However, Life Orb Scizor is also a viable choice, as it makes up for its lessened bulk with its incredible power.</p> <p>If outspeeding Choice Scarf Keldeo and Terrakion is not necessary, an Adamant nature with a simple EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe makes Mega Scizor even stronger. This is also the recommended spread for Life Orb Scizor, although both Adamant and Jolly are options, as it cannot hit the same Speed benchmark that Mega Scizor can.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Scizor set lacks longevity, as it doesn't run Roost, and has more difficulty setting up due to its lesser bulk. Due to this, it's recommended to keep Scizor healthy throughout the match, only switching it in when it needs to check a dangerous foe such as Weavile. However, this set's excellent power and coverage make it far more threatening early-game, and it can also choose to set up early- and mid-game to weaken the opponent's team. Keep in mind that if Scizor chooses to do this, it will be too weakened to sweep late-game unless it is healed with Lunar Dance, so its team should have an alternative wincon. Generally, work towards weakening Pokemon that resist Scizor's STAB moves such as Zapdos and Keldeo with attacks and entry hazards throughout the whole match and then set up with Shift Gear and sweep late-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set fits best on offensive teams that enjoy its presence as a strong and fast sweeper, and Scizor appreciates the entry hazard-stacking common on these teams. Terrakion, Heatran, and Tyranitar have access to Stealth Rock, and Landorus-T and Garchomp have access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes. These Pokemon also have a favorable matchup against the Fire-types that threaten Scizor. Offensive Water-types such as Keldeo and Azumarill also break through Fire-types, and Azumarill has the additional ability to check opposing Keldeo. Latios and Latias switch into powerful Water- and Fire-type attacks, break down walls with their powerful Draco Meteors, and provide Lunar Dance support to give Scizor a second chance at sweeping. Kyurem-B is another good Dragon-type partner, as it can overwhelm Skarmory with Fusion Bolt and take advantage of Rotom-W with Substitute + Dragon Dance.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>U-turn allows Scizor to scout and pivot, gaining momentum for Scizor's team. Gear Grind allows Scizor to break through walls. As an example of its power, it always OHKOes 252 HP / 0 Def Mew. Bullet Punch allows Scizor to revenge kill troublesome foes, outright OHKOing Gengar and Pokemon weak to Steel such as Terrakion and Aerodactyl. Superpower hits Steel-type switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Heatran, OHKOing specially defensive variants. Pursuit provides utility by trapping Pokemon that fear U-turn or Bullet Punch, such as Gengar, Latios, Latias, Meloetta, Mega Gardevoir, and Hoopa-U.</p> <p>Pin Missile can be used to hit bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Mega Slowbro, and Quagsire hard. Knock Off is another option that provides decent coverage and removes items such as Eviolite and Leftovers.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Speed EVs allow Scizor to outrun defensive Rotom-W and most specially defensive Heatran. Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature is a necessity to increase Scizor's power. The remaining EVs are invested in HP, which makes use of Scizor's decent bulk, pivoting capabilities, and access to Pursuit. A simple EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD can also be used for more bulk, which makes Scizor a more reliable Pursuit trapper and pivot, but it misses out on outspeeding defensive targets. Technician is the necessary ability, as it boosts the power of Pursuit if the foe doesn't switch out, Gear Grind, and Bullet Punch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Scizor cannot set up, but it makes up for it with its monstrous initial power and ability to pivot and scout. U-turn should be the move of choice early-game, as it provides momentum and scouts the opponent's default response to Scizor. Gear Grind should be used when to weaken the opponent's team, as it heavily dents all Pokemon that do not resist it. Use Superpower to hit Steel-types, but be wary of King's Shield. Scout for Fire-type coverage moves as well as Will-O-Wisp when Scizor is trying to Pursuit trap a foe. Bullet Punch should be used to revenge kill threats, as well as clean up weakened teams. However, be aware that the move lock from Choice Band means the opponent can often set up on Scizor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Scizor fits well into VoltTurn chains, as they provide momentum and allow it to Pursuit trap more easily. VoltTurn partners include Landorus-T, Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, and Tornadus-T. The latter two Pokemon are also capable of checking non-Choice Scarf Keldeo. Powerful wallbreakers such as Hoopa-U and Mega Medicham appreciate getting a safe switch thanks to U-turn, while reliable cleaners such as Mega Lopunny appreciate having the opposing team worn down by a VoltTurn chain. Entry hazards severely limit Scizor's checks and counters, as many are Fire- or Flying-types; Heatran can set up Stealth Rock while Garchomp can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes. These two Pokemon take little damage from Fire-type attacks aimed at Scizor and can threaten Skarmory with Blue Flare and Fire Blast, respectively. Rapid Spin support is appreciated so Scizor is not worn down quickly. It can be provided by Starmie and Excadrill, which hit Fire-types hard with their STAB attacks, or Normal-types such as Meloetta and Mega Lopunny. These Normal-types can also run Fake Out + Extreme Speed to revenge kill sweepers that set up on a Choice-locked Scizor.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Roost allows Mega Scizor to keep itself healthy and wall foes. U-turn provides momentum for Mega Scizor's team and brings in frail Pokemon easily. Even without Attack investment, Bullet Punch picks off weakened Pokemon that can be threatening for Mega Scizor's team, such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie. The last slot is dedicated to entry hazard removal and setup; Defog removes all entry hazards, while Sticky Web slows down the opposing team's grounded Pokemon.</p> <p>Mega Scizor can run Superpower so it can KO Bisharp, Excadrill, and various Normal-types quickly. Gear Grind stops Mega Scizor from being complete setup fodder for bulkier foes, as it still hits very hard without any Attack investment. Knock Off and Pursuit are also options to bring more utility to Mega Scizor's team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximized HP and Defense EVs make Mega Scizor insanely physically bulky, avoiding 2HKOs from powerful attacks such as Adamant Landorus-T's Precipice Blades and Dragon Ascent, Adamant Excadrill's Precipice Blades, Jolly Life Orb Mamoswine and Garchomp's Precipice Blades, Adamant Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick, Jolly Life Orb Terrakion's Close Combat, Adamant Life Orb Azumarill's Crabhammer, and Adamant Mega Tyranitar's Diamond Storm. This allows Mega Scizor to comfortably check or counter these Pokemon, as well as others such as Weavile and Bisharp. Scizorite allows Scizor to Mega Evolve into the much bulkier Mega Scizor, and Light Metal reduces the damage taken from Low Kick by regular Scizor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Mega Scizor should aim to switch into the many attackers that it walls and keep healthy with Roost. The free turns generated should be used to clear entry hazards, set up Sticky Web, or U-turn out for momentum. Sticky Web should be used as soon as possible to aid the slow Pokemon on Mega Scizor's team. The threat of Bullet Punch is also excellent for generating free turns. Switch Mega Scizor out against powerful special attackers, Pokemon with Fire-type moves, and Pokemon that can set up freely on this set's weak attacks. In particular, scout for Fire-type coverage moves from the above Pokemon, such as Fire Blast from Garchomp and Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set gives up Mega Scizor's innate sweeping capabilities and uses the team's Mega slot to control entry hazards and wall threats. It fits on balanced and defensive teams that appreciate a Pokemon that can remove or set entry hazards while serving as a solid physical wall. However, offensive teams also appreciate the slow U-turn that Mega Scizor brings, as well as Sticky Web to aid its slower wallbreakers. In general, pairing Mega Scizor with a Fake Out + Extreme Speed user such as Stoutland or Ursaring is helpful, as they can revenge kill the sweepers that set up on this fairly passive set. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Thundurus and Tornadus-T, appreciate Mega Scizor's ability to reliably use Defog. Slower wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Hoopa-U enjoy Sticky Web slowing down the opponent's team, as well as the safe switch provided by U-turn. However, they need to be able to deal with the Flying-types immune to Sticky Web. More defensively oriented VoltTurn users keep up momentum and deal with Pokemon that threaten Mega Scizor. Rotom-W paralyzes threats and can deal with many Fire-types, while Assault Vest Tornadus-T and Celebi can take on Keldeo. In return, Mega Scizor can switch into Grass-type attacks for Rotom-W and handles Weavile for Tornadus-T and Celebi.</p>"

  "Ursaring": {
    "overview": "<p>Ursaring is a very strong revenge killer and sweeper with access to good coverage options and two strong priority moves. It is one of the only Pokemon that are able to use the deadly Belly Drum + Extreme Speed combination, as it learns Belly Drum naturally. Belly Drum in combination with Ursaring's coverage moves turns it into one of the best sweepers in the tier once it has successfully set up, being able to cover almost anything it wants. It also acts as an amazing status absorber thanks to Guts. However, it struggles with only having four moveslots because it always runs two Normal-type moves, so it's often walled by common threats. Additionally, while Ursaring has a very high Attack stat, its mediocre bulk and pitiful Speed mean that it almost always relies on priority to take on faster threats. Ursaring also hates chip damage and is prone to being worn down due to its lack of recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Seed Bomb and Gunk Shot allow Ursaring to easily break through Unaware Quagsire and Clefable, respectively. However, these moves have terrible coverage otherwise. Fire Punch is a niche option to hit bulky Steel-types, particularly Scizor and Mega Scizor. However, Fighting- and Ground-type coverage is normally adequate for hitting these Steel-types. Facade is an option alongside Toxic Orb because it is very powerful, but it is hard to justify using Facade instead of a coverage move. Ice Punch is an option to hit Landorus-T and Garchomp but has poor coverage outside of them. Ursaring could potentially utilize a Rest + Sleep Talk wallbreaker set, allowing it to simultaneously activate Guts and recover damage. However, this set isn't great, as Sleep Talk is unreliable and Ursaring generally doesn't have enough bulk to tank two hits between each use of Rest.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types such as Skarmory and Scizor are hard for Ursaring to break because they resist its STAB moves and thus can wall it.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Physical walls such as Ferrothorn and Landorus-T are often hard for Ursaring to break, especially ones with Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are immune to Extreme Speed; however, they are rare in STABmons. In particular, Gengar is the only viable Ghost-type that outspeeds Ursaring, and it can OHKO Ursaring with Focus Blast. Sableye is another annoyance because it can use Topsy-Turvy to ruin Ursaring's sweep.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Users</strong>: Clefable and Quagsire wall Belly Drum sets that aren't carrying Gunk Shot or Seed Bomb, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fast Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Any Rock- or Steel-type that outspeeds Ursaring, such as Terrakion or Heatran, can be a big problem, as Extreme Speed cannot OHKO them unless they are seriously weakened, and they can deal major damage to Ursaring or even OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Due to Ursaring's lack of recovery, it is worn down easily by passive damage. Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and Rough Skin are the main sources of chip damage and are commonly seen on Garchomp and Ferrothorn, which can use their abilities in conjunction with Rocky Helmet to easily wear down Ursaring. Guts variants are forced to use Close Combat for Ferrothorn, which does OHKO it most of the time, but Garchomp is 2HKOed at best by Ursaring's moves, and having to attack it twice will inflict a lot of residual damage on Ursaring. Belly Drum Ursaring easily outpaces and OHKOes Ferrothorn with Earthquake at +6 Attack; however, Ursaring is slower than Garchomp, so it is forced to use Extreme Speed and take the contact damage from Garchomp.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out + Extreme Speed Users</strong>: Ursaring is one of the slowest Fake Out + Extreme Speed users in the metagame, so it is vulnerable to being revenge killed by other Pokemon with these moves, such as Stoutland and Braviary.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out and Extreme Speed form a powerful revenge killing combination. Play Rough is used to hit Sableye, which cannot weaken Ursaring's attacks with Will-O-Wisp thanks to Guts. Crunch is another option that hits other Ghost-types, which are rare but still threaten Ursaring. Close Combat is the most common move in the last slot, hitting most Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Terrakion. Earthquake hits Pokemon such as Jirachi and Raikou as hard as possible and OHKOes Heatran. Fire Punch is a more niche option that can OHKO Ferrothorn and can get a heavy hit on Skarmory but leaves Ursaring unable to significantly damage Heatran, which is very common in STABmons.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Silk Scarf leaves Ursaring much weaker than Toxic Orb but still boosts the power of Fake Out and Extreme Speed without wearing down Ursaring. On the other hand, Toxic Orb activates Guts, making Ursaring extremely powerful, and lets Ursaring sponge status ailments once it activates, giving your team a free switch-in to Pokemon such as Whimsicott. Unfortunately, Toxic Orb puts Ursaring on a timer, which is very undesirable due to the nature of Fake Out. Guts makes Ursaring much stronger and allows it to take advantage of Will-O-Wisp and other status moves. The EVs give Ursaring maximum power and Speed to make it effective at revenge killing; however, Ursaring can afford to use an Adamant nature instead of Jolly because Jolly doesn't help it outpace anything notable besides other Ursaring and some Stoutland sets, as it is relatively slow anyway and has dual priority to mitigate its poor Speed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ursaring should very rarely be switched in directly because it is prone to being worn down and is generally only good as a revenge killer. If possible, the only time Ursaring should be switched in directly is on a predicted status move after Toxic Orb has activated, provided it's running the item. Ursaring's main role is coming in after a KO and immediately threatening the foe with Fake Out and Extreme Speed, so being brought in after a threat KOes something on your team is useful. If running Toxic Orb, bring Ursaring in safely so that it can use Fake Out to activate the item. Not many Pokemon can switch into Ursaring safely, so use that to your advantage. Ursaring functions great as a blanket check to setup sweepers, so it should be brought in to revenge kill them. Prediction is very important because the more Ursaring attacks, the more HP it ends up losing. Opponents will often try to switch aggressively around this, so don't be afraid to predict. Pulling double switches is often quite useful because many people will try to stall Ursaring out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ursaring has trouble breaking through bulky Ground-types such as Garchomp and Hippowdon, so strong Water- and Ice-type attackers such as Azumarill and Weavile are helpful for breaking these Pokemon down. If Ursaring is running Play Rough over Crunch, Ghost-types other than Sableye can be troublesome, so partners such as Mega Gyarados can be helpful to take care of them. Pursuit users such as Weavile are especially good at removing Ghost-types. Generally, Ursaring dislikes sturdy physical walls, so special wallbreakers such as Mega Blastoise are good teammates. Ursaring appreciates entry hazard removal, as entry hazards and poison damage wear it down extremely quickly, making Defoggers and spinners such as Landorus-T and Starmie good partners. Starmie and Mega Blastoise are especially good because they offer good offensive synergy with Ursaring as well, covering bulky Ground-types and Ursaring can take care of walls such as Ferrothorn and Suicune in return. Entry setters such as Ferrothorn also help Ursaring a lot because it forces a lot of switches. In particular, Forretress can set up Toxic Spikes, which quickly wears down the opponent's team in conjunction with Ursaring's powerful Fake Out. Trappers, such as Gothitelle, are very useful teammates in order to eliminate Heatran and Ferrothorn.</p>"
      },
      "Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Belly Drum is Ursaring's main setup move and the main part of what makes this set so proficient. Extreme Speed fills the role of a STAB priority move and is the second part of what makes the set so effective. The rest of the moves are coverage options to allow Ursaring to break through Pokemon that would otherwise wall it. Fighting-type coverage is required, as Pokemon such as Skarmory and Aerodactyl wall Ursaring otherwise, and Ferrothorn survives +6 Earthquake at full health. Brick Break is usually the best option because it OHKOes most of its targets at +6. Close Combat is also an option if you want raw power; however, it leaves Ursaring more prone to being revenge killed by Stoutland and other Extreme Speed users. Earthquake is a good option to cover bulky Steel-types such as Jirachi, and it doesn't make contact, so it can hit predicted Ferrothorn or Garchomp switch-ins. Crunch is another decent option that OHKOes Cofagrigus, but it can also hit other Pokemon such as Gengar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry allows Ursaring to recover 25% of its maximum HP, giving it more longevity and many more opportunities to set up. Guts prevents Ursaring from being crippled by burns and turns status ailments into an advantage. Quick Feet is also a very viable option because the extra Speed can turn Ursaring into an even more proficient sweeper. Maximum Speed and Attack EVs are used to make Ursaring as strong and as fast as possible, and the remaining 4 EVs are placed into HP as to give Ursaring an even HP stat, allowing Sitrus Berry to kick in after using Belly Drum at full health. A Jolly nature is preferred because Ursaring usually won't miss the extra power at +6, and outpacing other Ursaring as well as a few slower threats is useful. However, an Adamant nature is still a viable option if maximum damage output is preferred.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Make sure that Ursaring only uses Belly Drum once any Pokemon with Unaware, such as Clefable and Quagsire, are gone from the opponent's team because they can completely stop Ursaring's sweep. If your opponent has revealed Topsy-Turvy on Sableye, make sure it is KOed before setting up because Sableye is immune to Extreme Speed and can ruin Ursaring's sweep and remove your team's momentum. As Ursaring can only set up Belly Drum once, use it wisely, and remember that Ursaring is better late-game once the opposing team has been worn down. Thanks to Extreme Speed, this set can be used as a revenge killer early-game as long as you don't let Ursaring take too much damage. Ursaring has relatively poor bulk, so only set up on Pokemon with weak attacks. A lot of players will try to switch Ferrothorn into a predicted Extreme Speed to stack up Iron Barbs damage, so predict this if possible and hit Ferrothorn with Earthquake as it switches in, provided Ursaring is running the move. Use the turn that Ursaring forces a frail foe out to set up Belly Drum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that provide dual screens support such as Espeon and Latias give Ursaring easier opportunities to set up. Memento and Parting Shot users such as Whimsicott and Sableye also provide Ursaring with setup opportunities. Ursaring is relatively slow, so Tailwind support from Pokemon such as Zapdos is very useful. Entry hazard support is very useful to break Sturdy and Focus Sash, so Pokemon such as Forretress are good team options. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn both beat Clefable and Quagsire, which wall Ursaring thanks to Unaware. Pokemon like Hoopa-U and Keldeo can cover physical walls like Ferrothorn and Garchomp, which can deal a lot of passive damage to Ursaring.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 has two good abilities in Download and Trace, which allow it to perform two decent roles in the STABmons metagame; the former allows it to get free boosts in either attacking stat to KO foes more easily, and the latter lets it take advantage of foes' abilities. Access to Extreme Speed and Boomburst lets it function as either a strong physical, special, or mixed attacker; additionally, while it is outclassed by Ursaring and Mega Lopunny as a setup sweeper, it has something they don't: Eviolite, which lets it survive a plethora of hits that both Ursaring and Mega Lopunny can't. Sadly, though, as a result, Porygon2 has a big vulnerability to Knock Off, and the lack of additional passive recovery from Leftovers makes it more difficult for it to function as both a bulky attacker and a defensive Pokemon. Its pure Normal typing also leaves it weak to a common type in Fighting, represented by prominent threats such as Mega Lopunny and Terrakion, and is a bad type for it offensively with two types resistant to it and one immune. Alongside all of this, Porygon2 also sometimes struggles with four-moveslot syndrome because it has to fit recovery and status into its moveset; however, it is overall a good, bulky attacker in the STABmons metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A bulky Swords Dance set with Hidden Power Fire, Swords Dance, Extreme Speed, and Recover along with a Brave nature, Download, and an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpA can be used to let Porygon2 act as a bulky setup sweeper and revenge killer; however, while its higher bulk gives it an advantage, this set is outclassed by Ursaring and Mega Lopunny as Extreme Speed users because it takes longer to set up. An EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD with 0 Speed IVs and Analytic can be used to let Porygon2 hit extremely hard and almost always get a boost from Analytic; make sure to run Boomburst if you do use this. Heal Bell is good to let Porygon2 cure itself and its teammates of any status ailments, but its limited moveset prevents it from being fit in. Whirlwind can also be used to phaze setup sweepers, but yet again, Porygon2's four-moveslot syndrome prevents it from fitting into the moveset.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Knock Off users such as Weavile, Mega Scizor, and Bisharp remove Porygon2's Eviolite, leaving it noticeably less bulky and easily KOed.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Status inducers, specifically Will-O-Wisp and Toxic users such as Sableye and Heatran, make Porygon2 need to repeatedly spam Recover to stay healthy, which wastes its PP and makes it eventually run out. Special walls in general such as Chansey and Ferrothorn take little damage from Porygon2's attacks, and Ferrothorn and Heatran also resist the Boomburst + Thunderbolt combination it uses.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Mega Lopunny can easily KO Porygon2 with their respective Fighting-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Sableye and Gengar prevent Porygon2 from being able to inflict status on threatening foes and regaining health.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Setup Sweepers</strong>: Calm Mind setup sweepers such as Clefable and Mega Sableye can easily set up on and KO Porygon2 due to their abilities and typings; more specifically, Clefable can ignore any status thrown at it by Porygon2 due to Magic Guard and easily restore health with Soft-Boiled, and Mega Sableye is immune to Boomburst, deflects all status moves thrown at it with Magic Bounce, and can recover its health with Recover.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Excadrill and Mega Scizor can take hits from Porygon2 easily and set up and KO it in return.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Recover allows Porygon2 to replenish its health to stay on the field for longer periods of time and to stay alive longer. Boomburst lets Porygon2 hit almost every Pokemon with a strong STAB attack with solid neutral coverage. Thunderbolt can be used instead of Boomburst in combination with Ice Beam to form the BoltBeam combination, which has near-perfect neutral coverage; however, it doesn't hit as hard as Boomburst. Shadow Ball is used to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types super effectively and can hit the Ghost-types that Boomburst can't, but in general, it can't provide the amazing coverage that BoltBeam does. Rapid Spin is an alternative in the third moveslot as well to let Porygon2 perform as an entry hazard clearer. Glare lets Porygon2 cripple fast foes, even Ground-types, so that its teammates can easily outspeed and KO them and in general helps alleviate pressure on the team. Toxic can be used instead of Glare to cut down the foe's HP to make KOing all foes easier and is used for taking down bulkier Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs, a Bold nature, and Eviolite let Porygon2 be as bulky as possible to survive more hits from threatening physical attackers such as Landorus-T. Trace lets Porygon2 take advantage of the foe's ability, and it is used over Download to allow Porygon2 to act as a switch-in to more Pokemon. For example, you can switch Porygon2 in against Intimidate users like Landorus-T to lower their Attack in return; Prankster users like Thundurus and Sableye to have priority Recover and Glare or Toxic; Rough Skin and Iron Barbs users like Garchomp and Ferrothorn to deal residual damage to physical attackers and more specifically Fake Out + Extreme Speed users; Regenerator users like Slowbro and Tornadus-T to get free health back when Porygon2 switches out; Flash Fire users, specifically Heatran, to gain another immunity; and Multiscale users like Dragonite early-game to have more bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Like it was mentioned above, switch Porygon2 in on Pokemon of various abilities to take advantage of said abilities. Avoid Knock Off users such as Weavile to retain Porygon2's added bulk from Eviolite for as long as possible. Try to avoid getting badly poisoned and burned to prevent having to use Recover more times than necessary. Avoid Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny and Terrakion, as they have strong STAB moves that easily 2HKO Porygon2, and Mega Lopunny has Fake Out + Extreme Speed to weaken Porygon2 more quickly. Try to use Boomburst to take advantage of Porygon2's nice base 105 Special Attack, and try to use the move to wear down Pokemon that lack recovery. Recover should be spammed quite frequently to ensure that Porygon2 can stay on the field for as long as possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard setters like Klefki, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn make it easier for Porygon2 to KO threatening foes. Entry hazard clearers such as Starmie, Landorus-T, Latias, and Excadrill allow Porygon2 to switch in more easily so that it can survive more hits. Pokemon that resist Fighting-type moves like Clefable, Mega Slowbro, and Landorus-T are good teammates because they easily take care of Terrakion and Mega Lopunny and help it live longer. Fairy-types in general pair well with Porygon2 because they resist and can switch in on Fighting-types and can take care of Dark-types, especially those with Knock Off. Clerics are good teammates because of their ability to help Porygon2 live longer. Pokemon that take care of Steel-types, such as Fighting- and Ground-types such as Terrakion and Excadrill, are good partners to reduce the number of times Porygon2 has to switch out; Magnezone is also a good teammate because Magnet Pull lets it trap Scizor and Ferrothorn and easily KO them with Hidden Power Fire. Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot users such as Magnezone, Scizor, and Weavile are helpful for getting Porygon2 in safely. Wallbreakers such as Terrakion are useful for taking care of the bulkier Pokemon that Porygon2 struggles with.</p>"

      "DownPass": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Baton Pass lets Porygon2 pass the boost it gets from Download to a teammate and lets it gain momentum. Boomburst allows Porygon2 to hit almost every Pokemon really hard and removes threatening foes for teammates. Glare can be used to let Porygon2 cripple fast foes, including Ground-types, so that it and its teammates can easily outspeed and KO them. Swords Dance can be used over Glare to let Porygon2 pass large Attack boosts to its teammates. Recover lets Porygon2 stay healthy for longer periods of time and makes it more annoying for the foes to KO it. Toxic can be used as an alternative in the third moveslot to cut down the foe's HP more quickly, leading to more easy KOs. Substitute can also be used in the third moveslot to let Porygon2 pass a form of defense onto its teammates and allows the Pokemon coming in to avoid taking damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs, when used in tandem with a Bold nature and Eviolite, let Porygon2 be as bulky as possible while still retaining some special bulk. Download lets Porygon2 gain boosts in either Attack or Special Attack to pass to a teammate, and it can use the Special Attack boosts to its advantage if need be. Minimum Speed can also be used to let Porygon2 be really slow for safer Baton Passing.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try avoiding Knock Off users such as Weavile so that Porygon2 can keep the additional bulk from Eviolite for as long as it can. Try to avoid status also so that Porygon2 doesn't need to spam Recover and waste its PP. Stay out of the way of Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny and Terrakion, as they can both easily KO Porygon2 with their STAB moves. Avoid stat-lowering effects such as Parting Shot, Intimidate, and Sticky Web to prevent making teammates weaker and slower. Baton Pass the stat boosts obtained from Download onto Porygon2's teammates. More specifically, pass Attack boosts to physical attackers and Special Attack boosts to special attackers. Porygon2 can also be used as a defensive pivot with Baton Pass against frail Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Porygon2 appreciates having entry hazard setters such as Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Garchomp as teammates because they make it easier for Porygon2 to KO threatening foes. Entry hazard clearers like Starmie, Landorus-T, Latias, and Excadrill are good teammates because they allow Porygon2 to switch in more easily and let it survive more hits. Clefable, Mega Slowbro, and Landorus-T are good teammates because they can switch in on Fighting-types that threaten Porygon2, helping it live longer. Physical attackers such as Terrakion and Scizor appreciate the Attack boosts from Download, whereas special attackers such as Thundurus and Mega Diancie appreciate the Special Attack boosts. In general, Fairy-types are decent choices for teammates because they resist Fighting-type moves and can switch in on Dark-types that carry Knock Off. Frail yet strong attackers like Weavile appreciate Porygon2's ability to switch it in safety with Attack boosts. Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot users such as Magnezone, Scizor, and Weavile are helpful for getting Porygon2 safely, and Porygon2 works well with them in return thanks to Baton Pass. Rotom-H in general is a very good Pokemon, especially if Porygon2 is running Rapid Spin, as Porygon2 takes care of Stealth Rock for Rotom-H, and in return, Rotom-H checks Thundurus and is used as a pivot to Porygon2.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar is most notable for its outstanding bulk and offensive capabilities, the combination of which lets it check and simultaneously threaten a good portion of the STABmons metagame. Take, for instance, its ability Sand Stream, which summons a sandstorm and boosts its Special Defense by 1.5 while slowly whittling away at other Pokemon. The extra Special Defense and its solid physical bulk, even when uninvested, let Tyranitar pivot into common Flying, Normal, Dark, and Psychic moves. It therefore makes for a good trapper with Pursuit and Sucker Punch against frailer Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon. Tyranitar's resistance to revenge killing tactics like Fake Out + Extreme Speed is especially helpful when it wants to tap its solid Attack stat and set up with Dragon Dance, and it has a usable Special Attack stat to run coverage in order to lure and beat its usual checks such as Landorus-T, Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Considering this along with its access to entry hazards, the sleep-inducing move Dark Void, and the momentum-generating Parting Shot, Tyranitar is extremely versatile.</p> <p>The lack of any reliable recovery besides Leftovers diminishes Tyranitar's ability to pivot into attacks throughout the match, however. While Sand Stream benefits Tyranitar, the residual damage also negates Leftovers or outright chips away at any of its teammates without a Rock, Ground, or Steel typing. Additionally, its crippling 4x weakness to Fighting can result in surprise KOs from enemy Pokemon that carry Fighting coverage just to eliminate Tyranitar, and it's also weak to common Ground- and Steel-type attacks. Lastly, it suffers from a lackluster Speed stat, which leaves it vulnerable even after a boost from Dragon Dance and to all types of status. These negative aspects need to be taken into account when choosing Tyranitar for your team, but overall it makes for a fantastic check to big threats such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Thundurus, supports the team with entry hazards or status, and often doesn't take up your Mega slot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With access to Sucker Punch, Tyranitar can utilize Substitute sets well and run Focus Punch to gain solid Dark / Fighting coverage. Dragon Tail and Roar are effective ways to spread entry hazard damage and control setup. Thunder Wave can also surprise a setup sweeper and has the benefit of lasting even after they switch, unlike Taunt. Head Smash is a much stronger but less accurate Rock-type STAB move that carries a nasty 50% recoil cost. With a Choice Band, Head Smash will deal massive damage, and the item also makes Pursuit and Knock Off extremely potent right off the bat. Tyranitar has access to Spikes, but it often doesn't have room to use it alongside Stealth Rock, which is overall much better in STABmons due to all the Flying-types. Rock Polish is usable over Dragon Dance if you want Mega Tyranitar to outspeed the unboosted metagame and even some Choice Scarf users at the cost of less power behind its attacks. Lastly, you can drop instances of Knock Off and Diamond Storm for Crunch and Stone Edge, which lets you add new status moves such as Dark Void, Parting Shot, and Switcheroo to Tyranitar's movepool. Switcheroo and Parting Shot are helpful on Choice sets, for example.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Terrakion, Lucario, and Conkeldurr resist both of Tyranitar's STAB types and Stealth Rock, giving them many opportunities to switch in and threaten it with their 4x super effective STAB moves. Priority Mach Punch on Terrakion and Conkeldurr is common and will render any Speed advantage Tyranitar has useless.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Azumarill resists Dark, is not hit super effectively by any of Tyranitar's coverage moves, and can use a switch to set up Shell Smash or Belly Drum. Mega Diancie only fears Precipice Blades or Earthquake and threatens with Play Rough or Moonblast, and it bounces back status and hazards with Magic Bounce.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Without Fire Blast or Superpower, there is little Tyranitar can do to Pokemon such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Bulky Mega Scizor can even set up on Tyranitar and then KO it with Gear Grind. Ferrothorn can lay entry hazards, use Leech Seed, or hit hard with Gyro Ball while resisting Diamond Storm and punishing Knock Off's contact with Iron Barbs. Skarmory phazes Tyranitar and clears its hazards with Defog. Besides Fire Blast, Excadrill also fears Ground attacks but can use Tyranitar's Sand Stream against it to threaten your team and also Rapid Spin away hazards.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Landorus-T and Gliscor need to be wary of Ice Beam, but otherwise, they don't mind switching into Tyranitar and attacking with super effective STAB moves. Both can clear Stealth Rock with Defog, and Gliscor has the added bonus of an effective status immunity thanks to Poison Heal. Unaware Quagsire shrugs off all attacks, heals itself with Recover, and hits back with STAB Earthquake, STAB Scald, or Toxic. Taunt or Dark Void will make Quagsire's job harder, however. Defensive Rotom-W carries Scald or Will-O-Wisp to severely cripple Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Priority or Faster Status</strong>: Sableye can threaten with priority sleep or burn. It also has Topsy-Turvy to reverse any of Tyranitar's stat boosts. Whimsicott resists Tyranitar's Dark STAB type and can Encore a status move or, like Sableye, induce priority sleep. Pokemon with a fast status attack, such as Serperior, Weavile, and Mega Sceptile, can neutralize Tyranitar and threaten it with a super effective attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is the preferred Dark-type STAB move on this set because Tyranitar should be faster than most targets, making Sucker Punch less valuable, and it hits harder than Crunch most of the time. Diamond Storm is Tyranitar's most reliable Rock-type STAB move, with a good chance to raise Tyranitar's Defense by one stage. Superpower hits Normal-types, Heatran, Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and Terrakion all for super effective damage, the last two being good Tyranitar counters otherwise. While the coverage is redundant, Pursuit allows Tyranitar to trap weakened Psychic-types, Ghost-types, and frail targets, especially those at the crucial base 110 Speed mark, such as Latios and Gengar, ensuring it will remove them from the game no matter if they stay in or switch. Ice Beam is an option over Pursuit to surprise common checks like Landorus-T and Gliscor. Outside of that, it has little use.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf allows Tyranitar to get the jump on faster Pokemon and KO them first. It also surprises faster checks that expect to switch in and force Tyranitar out only to be 2HKOed instead. Therefore, Tyranitar invests as many EVs as possible in Speed and Attack. The leftover EVs are put in Special Defense. With a Jolly nature, Tyranitar beats anything below fully invested base 116 Speed. If you opt for Ice Beam over Pursuit, use the Hasty nature instead, which preserves Tyranitar's Special Attack. Sand Stream is preferred to buff Tyranitar's Special Defense while also providing chip damage against the foe if it's not a Rock-, Steel-, or Ground-type.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Knock Off is fairly spammable, so use it more often than not to remove items and deal lots of damage in the process. This helps break down walls in the long run. Avoid Knock Off yourself, or else Tyranitar's utility as a revenge killer disappears. Try to scout for Mach Punch, Bullet Punch, and Water Shuriken on the likes of Terrakion, Scizor, and Azumarill, respectively, as these attacks outprioritize Tyranitar's even with its increased Speed. A Life Orb-boosted Mach Punch from Terrakion can OHKO a -Def Tyranitar, for example. Priority or faster status is always bad for Tyranitar, so play cautiously around Sableye and Weavile, both of which can put Tyranitar to sleep with Dark Void before it can move. In general, Choice item users carry the risk of having to switch against setup Pokemon if locked into the wrong move, so expect the opponent to use this to their advantage once they realize Tyranitar is holding a Choice Scarf.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A cleric is important should Tyranitar get statused. Celebi can run Heal Bell and absorbs status itself with Natural Cure. It can also bring Tyranitar in with U-turn. Something to take Knock Off is advised because Tyranitar is unable to perform that role with this set. Mega Scizor doesn't mind it, as it takes reduced damage from the move, nor does Terrakion to an extent, which also gains a Justified boost from Knock Off. Tyranitar has no way to remove Quagsire itself and also struggles with bulky Azumarill. Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur are great Azumarill checks with the benefit of also checking Quagsire. Bringing your own Unaware Quagsire or a way to stop setup such as Topsy-Turvy Sableye is recommended because setup Pokemon such as Shift Gear Mega Scizor can take advantage of Tyranitar if it is locked into an attack that does little damage. Finally, bring an entry hazard remover, as Tyranitar will need to switch around often to perform at its best. Starmie has Rapid Spin and a strong Analytic-boosted Origin Pulse or Psystrike to punish switch-ins. It can also remove Landorus-T and Gliscor if Tyranitar lacks Ice Beam.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Offensive": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is Tyranitar's strongest Dark-type STAB move when the target is holding an item and hits a lot of switch-ins very hard, whereas Sucker Punch pairs well with Pursuit to trap frail or weakened Pokemon, creating at best a 50/50 scenario for the opponent. It is a riskier option over Knock Off, however. Pursuit takes advantage of Tyranitar's ability to pivot into threats such as Talonflame and Latios and hits them as they switch for high damage. Diamond Storm is its more reliable Rock-type STAB move and has the benefit of possibly raising Tyranitar's Defense by one stage, which can reduce the chance of it getting KOed by a physical attacker the following turn. Stealth Rock gives your team important entry hazard support and chips away at the enemy's team over time. Tyranitar's Rock STAB type deters Flying-type Defoggers from trying to remove the hazard as well. Precipice Blades or Earthquake provides Ground coverage in the last slot to hit certain Steel-types hard, but common Steel-types like Heatran already hate Knock Off if Tyranitar has it. Superpower is an option should you want to hit Normal-types the hardest. It will leave Tyranitar vulnerable afterward, however, as it drops its Attack and Defense one stage each. Fire Blast can be used over Stealth Rock to catch Mega Scizor off guard, which doesn't care about Knock Off, can tank a Diamond Storm, and greatly threatens Tyranitar with Steel-type STAB moves. Ice Beam is a final alternative to KO Landorus-T and Gliscor, which can sponge Tyranitar's attacks and Defog away its hazards.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sand Stream is required to increase Tyranitar's Special Defense. Running 252 HP EVs gives it great overall bulk, especially when sandstorm is up, and lets it switch in to a lot of resisted or neutral hits throughout the match, which is important due to this set's ability to pivot and trap foes with Pursuit. An Adamant nature with 252 Attack EVs makes it hit as hard as possible. A Brave nature can be used over Adamant if Tyranitar has special coverage moves in order not to lower its Special Attack. The reduction in Speed isn't too bad, especially if Tyranitar has Sucker Punch. The rest of the EVs go into Special Defense. Leftovers is the preferred item to extend Tyranitar's life throughout the match, though Smooth Rock is an option to extend the duration of sandstorm from five turns to eight. Tyranitarite beefs up Tyranitar's overall bulk but doesn't offer enough extra benefit to use over Leftovers most of the time, and Mega Tyranitar competes with other, better Mega Evolutions.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Tyranitar into resisted or ineffective hits such as Gengar's Shadow Ball, Thundurus's Oblivion Wing, and Latios's Psystrike. It can also switch in on neutral special hits such as Thundurus's Thunderbolt fairly well and force their users out if they don't carry the correct coverage move. Use Pursuit against enemy Psychic- and Ghost-types if you suspect they'll flee that turn, and use Sucker Punch if you think they're going to attack. These include Latios, Meloetta, Espeon, Starmie, and Gengar, all of which take heavy damage from or are outright KOed by either attack. Use Knock Off if you want to hit an incoming target instead for high damage and to remove its item. Diamond Storm does respectable neutral damage to Pokemon coming in to take Knock Off, such as Azumarill and Mega Scizor. Additionally, if it boosts Tyranitar's Defense by one stage, it may allow it to tank a hit the next turn that it normally couldn't and finish off the target. Don't count on the Defense boost to beat these Pokemon, however. Stealth Rock should be used early to start spreading entry hazard damage as soon as possible and will make trapping threats easier later in the match. It's best used as the opponent switches out their Pokemon, such as a Chansey afraid of losing its Eviolite.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Latios, Espeon, and Meloetta are good partners for Tyranitar. Your own slower Dragon such as Garchomp likes Latios gone, and slow support Pokemon that are normally setup bait for special sweepers, such as Quagsire, appreciate Espeon and Meloetta gone. Because Tyranitar also keeps Flying-types at bay, Tangrowth, Serperior, and Mega Blastoise have less to fear with Thundurus and, in the case of the former two, Talonflame gone. In turn, Tangrowth and Serperior can help get rid of Azumarill, which otherwise gets in for free on Tyranitar and sets up. With the sand support Tyranitar brings, a Sand Rush user such as Excadrill is a great teammate and can clean up the foe's team after Tyranitar has weakened it. Fellow Rock-types such as Aerodactyl and Terrakion also appreciate the boost to their Special Defense, letting them tank special hits they normally couldn't. Similarly to Excadrill, these Pokemon can clean up after Tyranitar punches holes with Knock Off and Diamond Storm. Finally, Pokemon that draw in checks that are weak to Stealth Rock and sandstorm's chip damage work well with Tyranitar. Scizor will often draw Gyarados or either Mega Charizard, all of which lose HP to Stealth Rock and sandstorm, making their job of checking Scizor harder.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance raises Attack and Speed by one stage each, giving Mega Tyranitar a chance to take out faster threats with its increased damage output. Knock Off is the strongest Dark-type attack when the target is holding an item. If it doesn't KO the target, it will at least cripple them most times. Diamond Storm is Tyranitar's most reliable Rock-type STAB move, with a chance to boost Defense, and has good coverage in the metagame. Precipice Blades is a strong Ground-type attack and grants solid coverage with Rock, but the accuracy is subpar. Accordingly, Earthquake is a weaker but more accurate Ground-type move. Ice Punch catches checks like defensive Landorus-T and Gliscor for 4x damage, while Fire Punch can be used in the last slot to hit Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn the hardest instead.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature with 208 Speed EVs allows Mega Tyranitar to outspeed base 121 Speed Pokemon after a Dragon Dance, specifically Tornadus-T and Mega Pidgeot, which are both KOed by Diamond Storm. 252 EVs are put into Attack to hit hard, and the rest are added to HP to maintain some bulk. Unlike non-setup sets, Tyranitarite is always preferred because it adds more Speed while increasing bulk simultaneously. Sand Stream is the best ability to run on the base forme because it lets you switch Tyranitar into neutral special hits if needed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Evolve Tyranitar as quickly as possible to take advantage of the better Speed and bulk. Its ability stays the same, so you don't have to worry about losing the utility of Sand Stream. Mega Tyranitar should attack without setting up until important walls such as Quagsire, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn have been removed, unless you have the coverage to beat the latter two. Scout for Thunder Wave on Thundurus, as it will priority paralyze Tyranitar before going down and make checking it easier later. Don't set up either with Sableye still on the opponent's team, because it can Prankster status Mega Tyranitar with Will-O-Wisp and Dark Void or use Topsy-Turvy to invert its stat changes, halting its sweep and momentum. Mega Tyranitar is vulnerable to status in general, so keep it clear of faster status users such as Weavile, which still outspeeds it after a boost, and Mega Pidgeot, which outspeeds it before a boost. Considering Tyranitar's lack of recovery, you should be smart about switching it in and try to let it take only weak neutral or resisted hits. Once Mega Tyranitar's health is gone, it's gone, unless you carry a Wish passer or Lunar Dance user.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar needs Unaware Quagsire removed before it can sweep, so bring a Grass-type such as Tangrowth or Celebi to deal with it. Without Fire Punch, it also struggles with defensive Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, so a Fire-type like Heatran or Rotom-H can take them out. Gothitelle is notable for being able to trap and remove all of Quagsire, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and most Fighting-types with the correct coverage, clearing the path for Tyranitar later. Because it's vulnerable to all status, it enjoys having a cleric on the team to clear any burns or sleep status it might incur. Chansey is a great option that can also pass large Wishes to get back any lost HP for Tyranitar. Lunar Dance Espeon and Latios are options as well to clear any status and restore all HP back for Tyranitar so it can attempt another sweep. Keeping entry hazards off the field will also save Tyranitar HP. Scrappy Stoutland or Landorus-T can spin or Defog, respectively. Lastly, a Pokemon to take any Fighting, Ground, and Steel moves coming at Tyranitar makes for a valuable partner. Slowbro shrugs off these types, especially if they're physical.</p>"

  "Sceptile": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Sceptile can be extremely problematic for offensive teams due to its blisteringly high Speed and decent Special Attack. Mega Sceptile is the fastest Dragon-type in the tier, meaning it can easily revenge kill other Dragon-types, such as Garchomp, Latios, and Mega Charizard X, with Dragon Pulse. It also has a powerful STAB move in Seed Flare, which allows it to revenge kill fast threats such as Mega Manectric; Seed Flare in combination with Mega Sceptile's typing also allows it to easily deal with Water-types such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Slowbro. Another advantage its Grass typing brings is an immunity to Spore, which Mega Sceptile is also one the fastest users of. Furthermore, Lightning Rod also gives it an immunity to moves like Thundurus's Thunder Wave and Rotom-W's Volt Switch. However, due to its frailty, it is easily picked off by Choice Scarf users and priority moves, such as the common combination of Fake Out and Extreme Speed. This is compounded by its relatively bad defensive typing, which notably leaves it 4x weak to Ice Shard. It also doesn't have a very potent offensive typing and its strongest STAB move is widely resisted; thus, it often finds itself strained for coverage. Mega Sceptile also struggles against stall teams, as they tend to carry specific walls that Mega Sceptile cannot deal with easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Sceptile can use Energy Ball or Giga Drain alongside or over Seed Flare and Focus Blast for more reliable Grass-type STAB moves that also preserve Seed Flare's PP, but Mega Sceptile's coverage or power will be compromised. Earthquake with a Naive nature is a fine option that can deal with Steel-types if Heatran is particularly problematic or if hitting specially defensive Jirachi a bit harder is wanted. However, outside of its niche targets, Earthquake is generally inferior to Focus Blast and Hidden Power Fire as a coverage move. Substitute is a powerful tool on Mega Sceptile, as it provides protection from priority and can generate free turns by forcing Water-types out or by simply putting something to sleep. However, it will have to give up either the utility of Spore or coverage, and Mega Sceptile already struggles with its limited movepool. A Swords Dance set can be used, as Mega Sceptile has access to Power Whip, which provides a strong physical STAB move, and Spore, which eases setup; it also possesses a usable base 110 Attack and a good physical movepool. However, other Dragon-type sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Garchomp, and Haxorus outclass it in that area.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Bulky Flying-types are a problem for Mega Sceptile, as they can usually survive Seed Flare and heavily damage it with a STAB move in return. Togekiss is particularly troublesome for it, as Mega Sceptile usually runs nothing in the way of coverage against it and can potentially allow it to set up. Mandibuzz, while not as common, takes all of Mega Sceptile's moves. To make matters worse, Mandibuzz has Overcoat, meaning that Spore is completely useless against it. Other Flying-types, such as Assault Vest Thundurus-T and Talonflame, also cause problems for Mega Sceptile, although they do not appreciate Spore.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Priority moves such as Fake Out + Extreme Speed, Talonflame's Brave Bird, and Ice Shard from Kyurem-B and Weavile give Mega Sceptile problems due to its low bulk. Choice Scarf users that can outspeed Mega Sceptile, such as Thundurus-T and Terrakion, are also problematic.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: As long as Mega Sceptile does not have a coverage move to hit them, bulky Steel-types are an issue. For example, Mega Scizor walls Mega Sceptile without Hidden Power Fire. Some Steel-types are not bothered by Mega Sceptile's coverage moves; such Pokemon include Klefki and Jirachi, which both can easily survive a Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: While not that common, bulky Grass-types are an issue for Mega Sceptile, as they are immune to Spore. This problem is exacerbated if Mega Sceptile lacks Hidden Power Fire or other means to hit them. Pokemon like Assault Vest Tangrowth, Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn are examples of these.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Chansey, Clefable, and Porygon2 can easily take all of Mega Sceptile's moves, especially if it has already put something to sleep with Spore. Assault Vest users such as Meloetta and Thundurus-T cause the same problems for Mega Sceptile, being able to survive any hit Mega Sceptile can dish out and deal massive damage in return.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spore allows Mega Sceptile to put fast offensive Pokemon, such as Latios, Thundurus, Raikou, and Alakazam, to sleep. Seed Flare lets Mega Sceptile heavily damage its foes, especially Water-types such as Quagsire and Rotom-W. It also has a very high chance to drop the foe's Special Defense by two stages, allowing it to break through walls it would otherwise struggle against. Dragon Pulse allows Mega Sceptile to revenge kill Dragon-types such as Latios and Garchomp. It is also more reliable than Seed Flare in terms of accuracy and PP. Focus Blast grants Mega Sceptile the best possible coverage alongside its STAB combination, as it hits almost all Steel-types at least neutrally. However, if certain Steel-types that are not hit hard by Focus Blast, such as Scizor and Skarmory, are an issue, and if Heatran is not much of a problem, Hidden Power Fire can be used instead.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature is recommended, as Mega Sceptile would otherwise miss out on outspeeding fast threats such as Aerodactyl and Mega Manectric, which can heavily damage Mega Sceptile with Dragon Ascent and Hidden Power Ice, respectively. Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment is used to be as fast and powerful as possible. Lightning Rod allows Mega Sceptile to absorb Electric-type moves such as Thunder Wave and Volt Switch from the likes of Rotom-W.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is important to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, though that is easy to do thanks to Sceptile's high Speed. The extra power is appreciated, while the extra Speed is needed to revenge kill faster Pokemon, such as Aerodactyl and Mega Manectric. Lightning Rod is also important to check Electric-types and gain immunity to Thunder Wave. Mega Sceptile should be used both to revenge kill and to put key threats to sleep. While it might seem appealing at first, Spore should not be used early in the match, but rather on Mega Sceptile's counters or a fast Pokemon that threatens the rest of the team. You can also pivot Mega Sceptile into Water-types such as Rotom-W thanks to its 4x resistance to Water and blow them back with a Grass-type STAB move. However, Mega Sceptile should be wary about Ice Beam which will OHKO it. Mega Sceptile's typing lets it pivot into Electric-type Pokemon such as Raikou and force them out with its superior speed; however, Mega Sceptile must be careful about Hidden Power Ice or powerful secondary STAB moves. Mega Sceptile can pivot into Spore from the likes of Tangrowth and certain Ferrothorn sets, although it is not advised to stay in unless they take a decent amount from Dragon Pulse, as they can threaten Mega Sceptile out with their secondary STAB moves. Be careful when using Seed Flare, as it has a low 8 PP despite being easy to spam.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can handle Fairy-types, such as Dragalge and Gengar, make for good teammates, as Mega Sceptile is weak to Fairy-type attacks, while Fairy-types are not hit hard by its moves due to their generally high Special Defense. Pokemon that can remove Grass-types, such as Talonflame, Heatran, Rotom-H, and Gyarados, are great teammates to Mega Sceptile, as Grass-types can easily absorb Spore and force Mega Sceptile to use its weaker Dragon Pulse. Checks to Flying-types, such as Raikou and Rotom-H, are good teammates too, as Flying-types are generally able to survive Seed Flare and can retaliate with a super effective STAB move. Heatran can notably check Flying-types in addition to Grass-types. Talonflame is a good partner, as Mega Sceptile can deal with Pokemon that check it such as Rotom-W and Tyranitar. Any Pokemon that hates Rotom-W and other bulky Water-types such as Slowbro appreciate the presence of Mega Sceptile in general; examples of such Pokemon are Terrakion and Gyarados. Wallbreakers such as Hoopa-U and Choice Specs Dragalge can help Mega Sceptile clean up. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of bulky Ground-types, such as Tyranitar and Excadrill, also make for fine teammates. Entry hazard setters such as Heatran and Jirachi are also useful, as they wear down foes.</p>"

  "Sableye": {
    "overview": "<p>Sableye's great Dark / Ghost typing leaves it with three immunities and only one weakness, notably letting it serve as a great counter to all of the Fake Out + Extreme Speed users in the tier. Its amazing ability in Prankster paired with its expansive support movepool with moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Parting Shot, Topsy-Turvy, and Taunt allows it to quickly cripple foes. Access to recovery keeps it alive for a while, which allows it to support the team throughout the battle. Because of its versatility, it is able to partner well with many Pokemon and fit well on most teams and most playstyles. It is, however, easily beaten by Prankster Taunt and can suffer from four-moveslot syndrome.</p> <p>Mega Sableye, with its ability Magic Bounce, can turn foes' status moves back at them. With its increased Defense and Special Defense stats, Mega Sableye has the capability to set up and sweep teams. However, its below average HP, Attack, Special Attack, and Speed stats give it trouble at times, making it either frail, easily set up on, or outsped.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sableye can use a Choice Scarf set with Switcheroo, although this is very niche and outclassed. Sableye can also run Confuse Ray as an alternative to Will-O-Wisp; however, it is outclassed by Will-O-Wisp, as confusion doesn't cripple the Attack stat of the foe. Sucker Punch is an option to surprise and pick off weak foes such as Gardevoir, Latios, and other Psychic-types with low Defense. Metal Burst is another niche option that is possible on the Focus Sash set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie, Sylveon, and Clefable are able to counter Sableye, as they don't care about its Dark-type STAB moves and are able to hit back hard with their own STAB moves. Mega Diancie makes for a particularly good counter, as it is able to reflect status moves back with its own Magic Bounce.</p> <p><strong>Scrappy Foes</strong>: Foes like Mega Lopunny and Stoutland are able to hit Sableye and heavily damage Sableye with Fake Out + Extreme Speed thanks to Scrappy. Mega Lopunny is also able to OHKO Mega Sableye with a Fighting-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Prankster Foes</strong>: Opposing Prankster users like Thundurus and Whimsicott will outspeed and Taunt non-Mega Sableye, shutting it down. Whimsicott handles Mega Sableye as well by resisting Dark-type attacks and hitting it hard with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers such as Keldeo, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y are strong enough to overpower Sableye.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Parting Shot allows Sableye to switch out to avoid taking unwanted hits, as well as having the added benefit of weakening the foe by lowering each of its attacking stats by a stage. Will-O-Wisp allows Sableye to cripple physical attackers by halving their Attack, as well as damaging them each turn. Topsy-Turvy allows Sableye to stop setup sweepers in their tracks, as it reverses their stat changes. Foul Play is another option over Topsy-Turvy, as once Sableye has crippled physical sweepers with a burn, it can hit them hard with Foul Play if they try to boost. Recover allows Sableye to regain half of its health, which helps it stay around as long as possible. Knock Off allows Sableye to rid its foes of their items, something that can cripple many opposing strategies. Taunt is also an option that can help make Sableye a nice stallbreaker. Toxic can help break down bulky foes by dealing an increasing amount of damage each turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Prankster allows Sableye to bypass its awful Speed and increases the priority of its status moves, letting it Recover, fire off Will-O-Wisp, or pivot out with Parting Shot before the foe can attack. The maximum EVs in HP and Special Defense with an Impish nature paired with Will-O-Wisp allow Sableye to be as bulky as possible and take as many hits as possible. Leftovers allows Sableye to slowly regain health over the course of the battle, keeping it alive longer. 252 HP and Defense EVs along with an Impish nature could also be run to take more physical hits. Sablenite can be used to allow Sableye to Mega Evolve, giving it enhanced defensive stats and Magic Bounce.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If you use Parting Shot on a foe with Magic Bounce, such as Mega Diancie, the foe will be forced to switch out and Sableye's attacking stats will drop a stage, which then becomes a mind game with the opponent. Sableye is the slowest Prankster user in STABmons, so if the opponent runs another Prankster user such as Thundurus or Whimsicott, they can easily shut Sableye down with Taunt or status it with Thunder Wave and Spore, so it is best to switch out against them. Sableye is a check—not a counter—to most physical threats, meaning it isn't bulky enough to switch into them. It is better to switch Sableye in after a teammate has fainted or with a clean switch from U-turn. From there, it can either status a threat with Will-O-Wisp or force it out. Because of the versatility of this set, it can be used throughout the entire battle. This makes it important to keep using Recover whenever you have the chance. If you are sure the foe will do less than 50% to Sableye, it is helpful to use Recover to set it up to better take more hits. If Sableye Mega Evolves, it will gain Magic Bounce, which is good for reflecting Taunt and other status moves; however, it will lose the ability to pivot out before the foe attacks and instead will have to rely on a slow pivot.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types such as Heatran and Scizor are great switch-ins to Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Sylveon that would otherwise beat Sableye. Special walls such as Chansey, Porygon2, and Meloetta work well, as they appreciate opposing physical attackers being crippled by a burn. Entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Terrakion, and Heatran pair well with Sableye because the hazards help to wear down foes due to the switches that Sableye forces. VoltTurn users, such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Thundurus, go great alongside Sableye, keeping up the momentum along with Parting Shot to wear down the foes over the course of the battle. Hazard removers such as Landorus-T, Starmie, and Mega Blastoise are good teammates for Sableye, as it will be switching in many times. Because this set is countered by opposing Mega Sableye, Pokemon that beat it are great teammates; Mega Diancie is an option if you are not running Sablenite.</p>"
      },
      "Mega Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp allows Mega Sableye to cripple physical attackers by halving their Attack stat, giving it time to set up. Recover allows Mega Sableye to stay healthy by restoring half of its health. Calm Mind boosts Mega Sableye's Special Attack and Special Defense, making it harder to KO and letting it hit hard after a few boosts. Snarl, while not hitting the foe hard, drops its Special Attack by one stage each time it hits, making Mega Sableye extremely hard to KO when paired with Will-O-Wisp and Calm Mind. It also has 24 PP, allowing it to be used many times throughout the battle. Dark Pulse is a powerful STAB option that has 24 PP and can be used if you want to inflict more damage. Night Daze is a similarly strong STAB move that has a 40% chance to lower the foe's accuracy. This is useful because once the foe has had its accuracy lowered a few times, it is forced to either switch out or rely on inaccurate attacks hitting. However, it only has 16 PP, which isn't the optimal for this set. Shadow Ball is another option to chip Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir, which would otherwise wall this set.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Prankster is important the turn before you Mega Evolve Sableye, as it lets Sableye either cripple a foe with a priority Will-O-Wisp or get a quick Calm Mind boost. Sablenite allows Sableye to Mega Evolve, which dramatically increases its defensive stats, as well as giving it Magic Bounce for an ability. Magic Bounce is an extremely useful ability after Mega Evolving, as it lets Sableye send status moves back at the user. A Bold nature increases Sableye's Defense while lowering its Attack, making it as physically bulky as possible. The EVs in HP and Defense along with burn support allow Sableye to take on many physical hits.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is not necessary to Mega Evolve right away. Prankster is a great ability before Mega Evolving and has some advantages over Magic Bounce, such as getting off a quick burn with Will-O-Wisp to cripple a physical attacker or getting in a quick Calm Mind to be able to take an extra hit. Don't stay in on Fairy-types like Clefable and Sylveon, as they don't care about Dark-type moves and are able to hit hard with their own STAB moves. This set works best late-game once all of its checks and counters, such as Fairy- and Dark-types, have been removed. With Will-O-Wisp, this set serves as a great check to many physical threats in the game; however, because of its low Speed, make sure that Mega Sableye is able to take two hits from whatever it is facing, as it will need one turn to use Will-O-Wisp and another to Recover the damage. Afterwards, you can start setting up Calm Mind and prepare for a sweep. Reflecting status moves with Magic Bounce is helpful because it prevents Mega Sableye from being phazed with Roar or Whirlwind. Beware, however, of opposing Sableye, as your Sableye can be phazed by Parting Shot.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types such as Scizor and Heatran work well with Mega Sableye, as they are able to switch into and eliminate Fairy-types that Mega Sableye doesn't like. Fighting- and Fairy-types such as Terrakion and Sylveon also work well, as they can take out Dark-types that stand in the way of a Mega Sableye sweep. Entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Heatran can wear down foes over the length of the battle, something that Mega Sableye appreciates. Teammates that can switch into powerful wallbreakers like Mega Gardevoir and Keldeo, such as Latios, Porygon2, Chansey, and Jirachi, make for good teammates as well, as Mega Sableye would struggle with them otherwise.</p>"
      },
      "Focus Sash": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp allows Sableye to check physical attackers, cutting their Attack in half. Destiny Bond allows Sableye to take a foe with it if it is KOed, which works great alongside Prankster. Memento is another option that can be used to drop the foe's Attack and Special Attack by two stages each at the expense of Sableye itself, which gives a teammate an easy setup opportunity. Parting Shot allows Sableye to switch out with priority and drop the foe's Attack and Special Attack by one stage each. Knock Off rids foes of their items while also hitting with STAB. Foul Play hits foes that have boosted their Attack hard. Taunt is another option that works well with Destiny Bond, as it forces a foe to use an attack, which will activate Destiny Bond if it KOes. Topsy-Turvy can be used to reverse the stats of setup sweepers and then allow Sableye to pivot into a setup sweeper to take advantage of a weakened foe.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Prankster increases the priority of status moves, which is extremely important with this set, as it allows Sableye to take down a foe with Destiny Bond. The 72 Attack EVs allow Sableye to OHKO Espeon with Knock Off. The rest of the EVs go to HP and Defense to make Sableye as bulky as possible. Focus Sash is used so Sableye can be a last-resort check to many setup sweepers on opposing teams, allowing it to switch into them once and then take them down with Destiny Bond the following turn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set works at any point in the game because of its versatility, although it cannot switch into foes with multi-hit or priority moves, such as Azumarill, Cloyster, and Stoutland. Sableye can also be used to build momentum on a VoltTurn team by using Parting Shot to switch to a teammate with a better matchup. If you are running Memento, this set works really well when paired with a setup sweeper; in that case, make sure that the counters to your sweeper are eliminated before using the move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W makes for a decent teammate, as it is able to handle Azumarill, Cloyster, and Mega Diancie, which can all give Sableye issues. Setup sweepers such as Ursaring, Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo, Thundurus, and Mega Scizor also make for good teammates. To keep Sableye's Focus Sash intact, the field needs to be entry hazard free; teammates like Mega Blastoise, Landorus-T, and Defog Gyarados help do this.</p>"

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>Latios is one of the stronger special attackers in STABmons and is very hard to switch into due to its high-Base Power STAB moves that allow it to hit everything that switches in hard. It also has a decent defensive typing with good resistances to switch in safely on Pokemon such as Keldeo, Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Rotom-W. It is very helpful on offensive teams due to providing Lunar Dance support.</p> <p>However, Latios's STAB moves do not affect the common Fairy- and Dark-type Pokemon, and it is weak to Knock Off, which deals quite a lot of damage and leaves Latios crippled for the rest of the match. It sits at a crowded Speed tier that contains dangerous threats such as Latias, Gengar, and Mega Diancie. Its two most commonly used coverage moves aren't the best, as Hidden Power Fire leaves Latios outsped by base 110 Speed Pokemon and Earthquake gives Flying-type Pokemon, which are fairly common in the format, a free switch in. Finally, Latios is very vulnerable to Pursuit trapping, as well as revenge killers such as Fake Out + Extreme Speed users due to its low physical bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Calm Mind can be used to overpower more defensive teams, despite creating a loss of a coverage move or Defog. On the bright side, it can run through teams late-game with a +1 Psystrike, as well as still deal heavy damage with +1 Draco Meteor. It is also usable on the switch if a passive Pokemon such as non-Mega Diancie switches in. Latios also has a few utility moves to provide team support. Tailwind allows slow Pokemon to have a better matchup versus offense, Thunder Wave cripples fast Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, and Memento, though inferior to Lunar Dance, gives frail Pokemon such as Weavile an easy opportunity to set up. A Choice Scarf set gives Latios a better matchup versus offense and lets it act as a revenge killer due to outspeeding very fast Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Terrakion, Tornadus-T, and Keldeo even after switching in on Icy Wind. It provides some utility as well, including the ability to cripple walls such as Porygon2 with Trick and a very fast Defog. However, Latios's STAB moves aren't good to be locked into because Dark- and Fairy-types, which are immune to them, are common. A Choice Specs set allows Latios to function as a fearsome wallbreaker, as it hits very hard and not many Pokemon can switch in on it. Again, though, common Pokemon are immune to its STAB moves, and it is more vulnerable to Pursuit trapping due to the lack of boosted Speed. Finally, Mega Latios is a horrible waste of your Mega slot and should never be used.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Due to Latios's poor physical bulk, Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Mega Lopunny and Ursaring can deal a lot of damage, which means Latios might fail to check what it's supposed to. Sucker Punch users such as Tyranitar and Weavile can easily OHKO Latios as well.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Weavile can outspeed Latios and OHKO it with powerful STAB moves. However, Weavile can only switch in on Psystrike. Bisharp is an exception, as it resists Draco Meteor and is capable of OHKOing Latios with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Scizor and Assault Vest Metagross can switch in easily on Latios's STAB moves. The latter three can Pursuit trap Latios, while Jirachi can set up with Calm Mind. Ferrothorn can just set up entry hazards on Latios.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Clefable, and Mega Diancie can switch in easily on Draco Meteor, can take a Psystrike, and proceed to easily OHKO Latios with a STAB move such as Moonblast or, in Sylveon's case, Pixilate-boosted Boomburst. However, entry hazard damage can allow Latios to break through them with Psystrike. Mega Gardevoir resists Psystrike, however, so it can switch in more easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that can outspeed Latios such as Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf Landorus-T can easily deal a good amount of damage. However, most of them are quite frail, so Latios can OHKO them if it hits them as they switch in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's most powerful STAB move and deals a lot of damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it, while Psystrike allows it to get around special walls such as Chansey, as well as deal some damage to Fairy-types such as Diancie and Clefable and hit Assault Vest users such as Tornadus-T. Defog provides utility by removing entry hazards for Latios's team, allowing Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock such as Thundurus to easily switch in and fire off strong attacks. Lunar Dance allows Latios to sacrifice itself and bring something in to clean up after it punches sufficient holes in the opponent's team. It also gives sweepers such as Mega Tyranitar a second shot if they are weakened. Roost allows Latios to stick around throughout the match and keep firing off strong attacks. Hidden Power Fire can be used over Defog to allow Latios to hit Steel-types such as Metagross, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn. However, it lowers Latios' Speed IVs by one, which leaves it outsped by base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Gengar, Latias, and other Latios. Earthquake can be used to let Latios lure in and defeat Steel-types such as Heatran, specially defensive Jirachi, and Assault Vest Metagross. Spacial Rend is an option over Draco Meteor. It doesn't lower Special Attack, which means Latios won't have to switch out as much. However, it is weaker and falls short of a lot of KOs.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment is used to take advantage of Latios's great Speed tier. If Earthquake is used, move the last 4 EVs to Attack and use a Hasty nature to preserve Latios's better special bulk. Life Orb is the item of choice for a large power boost while still being able to switch moves. A Timid allows Latios to outrun Pokemon with lower than base 110 Speed, such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Mega Charizard X and Y. Levitate, aside from being Latios's only legal ability, allows Latios to switch into Ground-type moves and not be affected by Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Latios is best used as an early-game wallbreaker or late-game cleaner, as it is able to hit a lot of threats such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Keldeo very hard, if not outright OHKO them. Ideally, it should be brought in on resisted special hits such as Secret Sword, Blue Flare, and Origin Pulse, as well as Ground-type moves such as Precipice Blades. If Hidden Power Fire is used, beware of Pokemon like Heatran, which is immune to Fire, and special walls such as Porygon2 switching in. You also have to predict with Earthquake, as it will potentially allow Flying-types such as Tornadus-T to switch in. Unfortunately, Earthquake comes off of Latios's lower Attack stat. Latios can be used as a late-game cleaner as well once its checks and counters are weakened or removed. In addition to this, Lunar Dance should be used wisely, as while you only get one chance at using it, it can be used to give a sweeper a second chance at cleaning up the opponent's team after its checks and counters have been removed. It can also be used if Latios risks being Pursuit trapped, bringing in something else and fully healing it to deal with the Pursuit trapper. Use Defog against more passive walls to avoid giving a dangerous boosting Pokemon a free turn or taking more damage than necessary, although it should not be used until Pokemon with Defiant, such as Braviary, physical Thundurus, and Bisharp, have been removed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Keldeo is a prime teammate for Latios, as it can easily clean late-game once Latios has sufficiently weakened walls, and it can safely set up with Calm Mind once its counters are removed. It also counters Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Weavile and can set up on them with Calm Mind. Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard removal, such as Gyarados, Mega Charizard X and Y, and Aerodactyl, make for good teammates, as they have a Stealth Rock weakness and appreciate being able to switch in more freely. Steel-types such as Heatran can beat threatening Ice-types such as Weavile as well as Fairy-type Pokemon such as Clefable, Sylveon, and Mega Gardevoir. Late-game sweepers such as Swords Dance Weavile and Nasty Plot Thundurus can take advantage of the holes that Latios will break with its powerful attacks, being able to easily set up and clean the opposing team. Offensive entry hazard setters such as Stealth Rock Garchomp can guarantee OHKOs with Draco Meteor and cripple its switch-ins. Klefki and Ferrothorn are good teammates if bulkier hazard setters are preferred. They can easily switch in on the Dragon- and Fairy-type moves that trouble Latios and set up entry hazards that allow Latios to secure the OHKO on Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro and Mega Diancie.</p>"

  "Lopunny": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Lopunny is an incredibly dangerous sweeper and utility attacker in STABmons. Its incredible Speed stat allows it to outspeed almost all of the unboosted metagame, and its solid Attack stat allows it to hit most Pokemon hard. Its excellent STAB combination in conjunction with Scrappy gives it perfect neutral coverage with Extreme Speed and High Jump Kick. It also has an expansive movepool that contains utility options such as Fake Out, Rapid Spin, and Heal Bell as well as coverage in Ice Punch and Thunder Punch. However, Lopunny is held back by its frailty and mediocre defensive typing, which prevent it from offering good defensive synergy. Mega Lopunny also cannot hold a boosting item and does not have a particularly high Attack stat for a Mega Evolution, so its power is unexceptional without a Swords Dance boost. As a result, it struggles to break down some defensive walls, especially those that resist Fighting, and it can struggle to revenge kill threats effectively with Fake Out + Extreme Speed, especially in comparison to other Normal-types such as Porygon-Z and Ursaring.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute blocks status moves and eases prediction, especially against King's Shield users. It works well in conjunction with Toxic and Encore, which cripple many of Mega Lopunny's regular defensive counters. Heal Bell allows Mega Lopunny to cure status that has been inflicted on itself and its team, providing invaluable utility for some teams. However, Mega Lopunny generally struggles to find opportunities to use it. Head Charge can be used as a stronger Normal-type STAB move, especially on the Swords Dance set, as it allows Mega Lopunny to break through bulky Flying-types more easily. Thunder Punch hits bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Gyarados hard, but it has poor overall coverage. Recover can be used to boost Mega Lopunny's longevity, but Mega Lopunny is too frail to use it effectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Very physically bulky Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Hippowdon, and Skarmory can tank Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick even after a Swords Dance boost and hit back reasonably hard. Mega Lopunny cannot hit Pokemon that resist Fighting such as Gliscor and Gyarados hard, unless it is running Ice Punch or Thunder Punch. Landorus-T and Gyarados also lower Lopunny's Attack stat with Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Mew, Victini, and Celebi can tank a boosted Extreme Speed and retaliate by crippling Mega Lopunny with Will-O-Wisp and Spore or KOing it with Psystrike. Slowbro can take hits easily thanks to its excellent physical bulk and can heavily damage Mega Lopunny with Psystrike, and Regenerator allows it to tank hits throughout the battle. Mega Slowbro's incredible physical bulk allows it to avoid a 2HKO from +2 Extreme Speed, and it always OHKOes Mega Lopunny with Psystrike.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Magic Guard Clefable can tank a +2 Extreme Speed and retaliate with Moonblast. Unaware Clefable ignores any Swords Dance boost that Mega Lopunny may have obtained. Physically defensive Togekiss survives +2 Ice Punch and can hit Mega Lopunny hard in return with Moonblast or Oblivion Wing.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Aerodactyl outspeeds Adamant Mega Lopunny and threatens it with Brave Bird, but Jolly Mega Lopunny will outspeed it and KO with High Jump Kick. Various Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo and Landorus-T can outspeed and KO Mega Lopunny, but they are threatened by a boosted Extreme Speed. Choice Scarf users that resist Normal such as Jirachi and Terrakion can revenge kill Mega Lopunny effectively. Sand Rush Excadrill also outspeeds Mega Lopunny when sand is active and takes little damage from unboosted Extreme Speed.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Missing High Jump Kick or using it against a foe that uses King's Shield or Protect will instantly force Mega Lopunny to lose 50% of its health. Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs from Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn will wear down Mega Lopunny, taking advantage of Fake Out in particular. Mega Lopunny can also be worn down by Spikes as it switches in.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Lopunny's Attack stat to incredible levels, allowing it to break down defensive threats and sweep offensive teams easily. Extreme Speed is a reasonably powerful STAB attack that also has +2 priority, allowing Mega Lopunny to threaten faster Pokemon. High Jump Kick is Mega Lopunny's most powerful STAB attack and provides perfect neutral coverage with Extreme Speed. Drain Punch can be used instead to enhance Mega Lopunny's longevity by recovering health when it attacks; however, it is noticeably weaker than High Jump Kick. Ice Punch hits defensive threats such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Zapdos hard. Various other moves are usable in the fourth slot. Protect allows Mega Lopunny to sweep without fear of being picked off by opposing Fake Out users. Substitute blocks attempts to inflict status and Imposter and allows Mega Lopunny to avoid Fake Out flinches as well as set up in front of passive Pokemon such as Alomomola easily. Baton Pass allows Mega Lopunny to pass Swords Dance boosts to its teammates, making fast attackers such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T extremely threatening sweepers.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs increase Mega Lopunny's offensive potential. Adamant is the preferred nature, as it increases Mega Lopunny's power and allows it to hit crucial benchmarks such as 2HKOing Quagsire. However, Jolly can be used to outspeed threats such as Weavile, Aerodactyl, and Tornadus-T, as Extreme Speed may not always be sufficient to deal with them. Lopunnite is necessary to Mega Evolve Lopunny. Limber allows Mega Lopunny to avoid paralysis from defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Rotom-W before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If possible, Lopunny should be brought in safely with the use of a pivot, as it is quite frail. Use Mega Lopunny's powerful Extreme Speed to revenge kill foes, but be wary of its low PP. Swords Dance can be used mid-game to break down defensive threats; however, it is best used late-game when Mega Lopunny can easily clean up the opposing team. Be wary of Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, and Iron Barbs damage racking up. Predict Ferrothorn and Ground-type switch-ins and hit them with High Jump Kick and Ice Punch, respectively. Don't recklessly click High Jump Kick against Steel-types, as they can run King's Shield, or against a foe that commonly runs Protect, such as Mega Sableye or Mega Diancie; use Swords Dance or Substitute instead. Substitute can also be used in front of foes that often run status-inflicting moves, such as Mew and Celebi, and passive Pokemon such as Alomomola.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Stealth Rock Garchomp and Spikes Klefki wear down the opposing team. In particular, Rock-types such as Terrakion and Tyranitar can set Stealth Rock and threaten Flying-types. Strong special wallbreakers, such as Thundurus, Hoopa-U, and Gengar can deal with the physical walls that trouble Lopunny. Dark- and Ghost-types such as Weavile and Bisharp can Pursuit trap and outright KO bulky Psychic-types. Mega Lopunny appreciates Lunar Dance support from Jirachi and Latios, as it can get easily worn down throughout the match. Jirachi can also utilize Wish to restore Mega Lopunny's health without sacrificing itself, and it consistently threatens Fairy-types. Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot users such as Thundurus, Landorus-T, and Sableye allow Lopunny to come in safely. Rotom-W is particularly good at this, as it can also deal with the Flying- and Steel-types that threaten Lopunny.</p>"

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out + Extreme Speed allows Mega Lopunny to revenge kill many foes, as the combination is virtually a 120-Base Power priority attack. High Jump Kick is Mega Lopunny's strongest attack and hits Rock- and Steel-types hard. Rapid Spin clears entry hazards on Mega Lopunny's side of the field, and it cannot be blocked thanks to Scrappy. Ice Punch can also be used to 2HKO variants of Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor. Baton Pass can be used to allow Mega Lopunny to gain momentum, as it forces switches easily with the threat of Fake Out + Extreme Speed. However, Mega Lopunny should be wary of passing a lowered Attack stat from a foe's Intimidate.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature give Mega Lopunny as many opportunities to utilize Rapid Spin, as well as the ability to outspeed threats such as Jolly Aerodactyl. However, Adamant can also be used to increase the power of Fake Out + Extreme Speed significantly. Maximum Attack EVs give Mega Lopunny as much power as possible. Lopunnite allows Lopunny to Mega Evolve. Limber allows Lopunny to avoid paralysis before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Fake Out as soon as possible to safely Mega Evolve Lopunny. Use Fake Out frequently against offensive teams, as it racks up chip damage very quickly. Do not recklessly spam it against defensive teams, as damage from Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs will wear down Mega Lopunny rapidly. Instead, predict when Rocky Helmet users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp and Iron Barbs Ferrothorn will switch in, and hit them with Ice Punch and High Jump Kick, respectively. If Mega Lopunny is running Rapid Spin, use it when it forces switches with the threat of Fake Out + Extreme Speed. Lopunny can also serve as an excellent lead, as Fake Out allows it to safely break Focus Sash and Sturdy. Bring Lopunny in with the use of a pivoting move or after a teammate has fainted, as it is too frail to be directly switched into attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Generally, Mega Lopunny appreciates support from wallbreakers, as it struggles to break through common physical walls. In particular, Bug-, Dark-, and Ghost-types such as Volcarona, Hoopa-U, Crawdaunt, Weavile, and Gengar threaten bulky Psychic-types. Strong Water- and Ice-type attackers such as Keldeo and Kyurem-B break down the Ground- and Flying-types that non-Ice Punch Lopunny cannot beat. Pokemon that dislike Stealth Rock, such as Thundurus and Dragonite, appreciate Rapid Spin support. Lunar Dance users such as Latios and Jirachi can sacrifice themselves to heal Lopunny; the latter also takes on Fairy-types. Bulky Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot users such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Sableye can sponge attacks aimed at Mega Lopunny and bring it in safely with their pivoting moves.</p>"

  "Weavile": {
    "overview": "<p>Weavile finds its place in STABmons as a fast and versatile revenge killer. Its great Attack stat and incredible Speed tier are backed up by a potent STAB combination that heavily threatens common metagame threats such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Meloetta. Its utility is improved by its expansive movepool, which contains strong priority in Sucker Punch, excellent coverage in Low Kick and Poison Jab, and utility options in Pursuit and Parting Shot. However, the same typing that gives Weavile excellent offensive prowess leaves it weak to common attacking types such as Fairy, Fire, Fighting, Rock, and Steel, which means that it struggles against threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Scizor. Weavile is exceptionally frail, is weak to Stealth Rock, and commonly holds a Life Orb, so it is worn down very quickly and is vulnerable to priority moves such as the omnipresent Fake Out + Extreme Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Band is an alternative to Life Orb that allows Weavile to deal more immediate damage, take no recoil, and cripple defensive Pokemon with Switcheroo. However, such a set is often less threatening for opposing teams, as it's easy to take advantage of and cannot use Sucker Punch effectively. Dread Plate, Icicle Plate, and Expert Belt are all options to boost the power of specific moves without causing recoil, but they leave Weavile too weak. Icicle Spear can be used over Icicle Crash to revenge kill Pokemon behind a Substitute, such as Serperior and Landorus-T. However, its unreliable Base Power means it is generally inferior. Return allows Weavile to 2HKO both Keldeo and Azumarill, but it struggles to deal with Vacuum Wave from the former and Water Shuriken or Extreme Speed from the latter. Poison Jab allows Weavile to 2HKO Magic Guard Clefable and Azumarill and OHKO Mega Gardevoir. Iron Tail 2HKOes physically defensive Unaware Clefable and OHKOes Mega Diancie, but its shaky accuracy makes it unreliable. Taunt shuts down defensive Pokemon such as Slack Off Slowbro and prevents Weavile from being setup bait for sweepers such as Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Terrakion, Keldeo, Lucario, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny easily KO Weavile with their STAB attacks. Most of these Pokemon, especially Mega Medicham, dislike switching in. However, Keldeo and Lucario resist Icicle Crash, and Terrakion and Lucario can take advantage of Knock Off with Justified.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Azumarill can tank Weavile's STAB attacks easily, keep healthy with Recover, and retaliate with its STAB attacks or Extreme Speed. Mega Diancie avoids the OHKO from Icicle Crash and OHKOes Weavile in return. Clefable avoids the 2HKO from Icicle Crash and can proceed to cripple Weavile with Thunder Wave or 2HKO it with Moonblast. However, these Pokemon need to watch out for Poison Jab and Iron Tail.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Slowbro can survive an unboosted Knock Off and cripple Weavile with Thunder Wave or a burn from Scald. Mega Slowbro takes little damage from an unboosted Knock Off and can reduce the damage it takes with Iron Defense or Cosmic Power. Suicune can set up on Weavile and phaze it with Roar. Quagsire walls Weavile well and ignores Swords Dance boosts thanks to Unaware. Rotom-W is heavily damaged by a boosted Knock Off, but it easily cripples Weavile with Nuzzle or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Scizor takes little damage from Knock Off and can set up with Shift Gear while staying healthy with Roost. Klefki resists Ice and Dark and can set up Spikes, cripple Weavile with Thunder Wave, or attack with Moonblast while recovering with Moonlight. Skarmory and Ferrothorn avoid the 2HKO from Icicle Crash and can set up Spikes or KO Weavile. Heatran can easily OHKO Weavile with either of its STAB attacks. However, Ferrothorn and Heatran are 2HKOed by Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Prankster Sableye cripples Weavile with its priority Will-O-Wisp, while Prankster Klefki and Thundurus slow down Weavile with priority Thunder Wave. Weavile is extremely frail, so Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Ursaring and Mega Lopunny, Water Shuriken users such as Gyarados and Azumarill, and Gale Wings Talonflame all threaten to revenge kill it. All Mach Punch and Bullet Punch users are also very threatening, as they hit Weavile super effectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is Weavile's strongest Dark-type STAB attack and also removes items such as Leftovers, Eviolite, and Shed Shell. Icicle Crash is Weavile's best Ice-type STAB attack and hits common threats such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Thundurus hard. It also has a decent chance to make the foe flinch and allows Weavile to avoid taking damage from Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, or Rocky Helmet. Sucker Punch picks off naturally faster Pokemon such as Aerodactyl as well as Choice Scarf users such as Hoopa-U. Low Kick hits Rock-, Ice-, and Steel-types such as Tyranitar, Kyurem-B, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp hard. Pursuit allows Weavile to trap opposing Pokemon, especially Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Meloetta, Latios, and Gengar. It works very well alongside Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Ice Shard leaves Weavile less reliant on prediction than Sucker Punch, but it is only half as powerful against neutral foes. Parting Shot allows Weavile to pivot out of its counters and give its teammates setup opportunities, but Weavile struggles to use it effectively, as it is frail and vulnerable to entry hazards. Swords Dance allows Weavile to heavily threaten typical switch-ins such as Rotom-W and clean up teams late-game with Sucker Punch. However, Weavile struggles to find setup opportunities and can be easily revenge killed by Extreme Speed users.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Weavile's Attack and Speed EVs are maximized to increase its power and make the most of its excellent Speed stat. Life Orb boosts Weavile's power without locking it into one move. While it is rarely helpful, Pressure allows Weavile to quickly drain the PP of moves such as Extreme Speed and Close Combat before it is KOed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Weavile should never be switched directly into an attack, as it is far too frail to take even neutral hits. Instead, it should be brought in after a teammate has fainted or with the use of a pivoting move. Once Weavile is on the field, Knock Off should be used a lot to wear down teams and cripple foes. However, Weavile needs to avoid priority users, which easily revenge kill it, and status inducers, as they can often cripple it for the remainder of the match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As it is vulnerable to entry hazards, Weavile appreciates Rapid Spin or Defog support from Pokemon such as Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, Starmie, Latios, and Landorus-T. Entry hazard setters such as Terrakion, Garchomp, and Klefki limit the number of Pokemon that can switch into Weavile. Psychic- and Flying-types such as Starmie, Latios, and Tornadus-T threaten the Fighting-types, especially Keldeo, that Weavile hates. Steel- and Poison-types such as Excadrill, Scizor, and Gengar take on bulky Fairy-types. Ground- and Fighting-type attackers such as Landorus-T and Mega Lopunny threaten opposing Steel-types. Offensive Fire-types such as Heatran and both Mega Charizard formes are especially notable for their ability to break through Steel-types and beat most Fairy-types. Offensive Electric- and Grass-types such as Thundurus and Serperior handle the bulky Water-types that Weavile cannot break. Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot from the likes of Thundurus, Landorus-T, and Sableye allow Weavile to get onto the field safely, while Weavile can fit into these chains with its own Parting Shot. Weavile can reliably Pursuit trap Psychic-types, which Pokemon such as Keldeo and Mega Medicham appreciate, and Ghost-types, which Extreme Speed users such as Ursaring appreciate. These Pokemon can also revenge kill the setup sweepers that take advantage of Weavile with Vacuum Wave, Fake Out + Mach Punch, and Fake Out + Extreme Speed, respectively.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Due to Rotom-H's great typing, ability, and defensive stats, it can check a large number of top-tier threats such as Mega Scizor, Thundurus, Kyurem-B, and most Landorus-T variants. It has resistances to Electric, Fire, Bug, Steel, Flying, and Ice and an immunity to Ground, which are all common attacking types in STABmons. It can also function as a status sponge because it is immune to Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp. Rotom-H can support its team with a variety of status moves and can also keep up momentum with Volt Switch; additionally, it has access to high-Base Power Fire-type moves such as Blue Flare, Eruption, and Searing Shot. It is very versatile and can be used on a variety of teams. On the other hand, Rotom-H lacks good coverage moves and reliable recovery. It also faces competition from Rotom-W, which has a better overall defensive typing. Its below-average Speed stat forces it to use a Choice Scarf to compensate for it or else be outsped by threats, and its poor HP stat doesn't allow it to take as many hits as you would like.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic can be run to wear down bulkier foes. Sleep Talk can be run to let Rotom-H absorb almost every status, allowing it to counter all Grass-types, including Spore users. Magma Storm could be run alongside Toxic to trap foes on stall teams and wear them down quickly; however, this is better used by Heatran because Rotom-H doesn't learn Taunt, so it cannot prevent them from healing. A RestTalk set could be used, but counting on Sleep Talk is not reliable. Choice Specs can also be used, as it allows Rotom-H to hit incredibly hard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fast Water-types</strong>: Fast Water-types such as Choice Scarf Keldeo, Starmie, and Water Shuriken Azumarill are able to outspeed and heavily damage, if not OHKO, Rotom-H.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Terrakion, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar give Rotom-H a lot of trouble, as they resist Fire and are able to hit back with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Wallbreakers such as Ursaring, Mega Lopunny, Adaptability Porygon Z, Mold Breaker Excadrill, Mega Gyarados, and Earth Power Kyurem-B can give Rotom-H problems by just overpowering it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Special Walls</strong>: Bulky special walls such as Chansey, Porygon2, and Meloetta are able to heal off the damage and status ailments that Rotom-H causes, and it is not able to inflict significant damage on them.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-H to maintain momentum and switch to a teammate with a better matchup against the foe. Lava Plume has a 30% chance to burn the foe, which can be important to cripple physical attackers. Nuzzle has a 100% chance to paralyze the foe, which is very useful to slow it down and cripple it for the duration of the battle. Pain Split is Rotom-H's only real form of recovery, and because of its low base HP, it can often use the move to regain health while damaging the foe. Searing Shot also has a 30% chance to burn the foe; however, it hits harder than Lava Plume at the cost of having much lower PP. Blue Flare is another option for a Fire-type STAB move that hits harder but has low PP, below-average accuracy, and a lower burn chance. Will-O-Wisp is an option to inflict a guaranteed burn on the foe.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Levitate makes Rotom-H immune to Ground-type moves, turning what would be a 4x weakness into an immunity. Leftovers allows Rotom-H to passively recover HP each turn. Because Nuzzle isn't meant to deal significant damage, a Calm nature is run to make Rotom-H as bulky as possible, and Attack is the only stat it doesn't mind the drop in. Maximum EVs in HP and Special Defense help to make Rotom-H as bulky as possible, especially in conjunction with the Attack drop from a possible burn. Rotom-H can also run maximum Defense EVs and a Bold nature to tank hits better from stronger physically attacking foes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Pick which status move to use on the foe. If Rotom-H is facing a fast foe that gives your team a Speed disadvantage, try Nuzzle. If facing a physical attacker, try Lava Plume for the burn chance. Pain Split works based on Rotom-W's raw HP number, not its percentage, so don't accidentally weaken Rotom-W and heal a foe that may have a higher HP percentage and a lower overall HP stat than it. Use Volt Switch to pivot into something that will force a switch and either let a teammate set up on the foe or simply beat the foe one-on-one. If using Searing Shot or Blue Flare, be careful with PP and try to save them. Because Rotom-H's Speed stat isn't great, don't be afraid to switch out manually if the opponent brings in a Water- or Rock-type that is faster than it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Water-types such as Mega Blastoise, Azumarill, and Gyarados make for good switch-ins to other Water-types and hit Fire- and Rock-types hard with super effective STAB moves. In return, Rotom-H is able to take the Grass- and Electric-type moves that they don't like. Keldeo resists Water- and Rock-type attacks, and Rotom-H is able to take the Flying-type moves it doesn't like. Grass-types are also able to hit Rock-types as well as Water-types with super effective STAB moves. Other VoltTurn staples such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, Scizor, Thundurus, and Parting Shot Sableye work well to keep up momentum and continually switch out of the foe. Entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Garchomp work well due to their ability to help wear the foe down over the course of the battle along with any possible burns that Rotom-H inflicts. Entry hazard removers such as Landorus-T, Gyarados, Porygon2, and Skarmory are able to keep the field clear of hazards, which Rotom-H appreciates because it switches in and out often.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Blue Flare is Rotom-H's primary Fire-type STAB move that hits hard but has below-average accuracy. Volt Switch allows Rotom-H to hit the foe and then switch out to maintain momentum. Thunderbolt is an option for a secondary STAB move that hits harder than Volt Switch and doesn't force Rotom-H to switch out. Eruption hits incredibly hard because this set normally goes first; however, it doesn't always deal massive damage due to the amount of Fake Out + Extreme Speed users in the metagame. Trick serves as a way to cripple foes on stall teams by locking them into one move for the rest of the match. Searing Shot is an alternative STAB move that has 100% accuracy, has a 30% chance to burn the foe, and hits hard, but it has fewer Base Power than Blue Flare. Hidden Power Ice is a good option to hit Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp hard when they switch in on a predicted Volt Switch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Levitate removes the weakness Rotom-H would have to Ground-type moves, allowing it to freely switch into those moves. Choice Scarf allows Rotom-H to outspeed many threats in the metagame. A Timid nature and maximum EVs in Speed and Special Attack serve to make Rotom-H as fast and strong as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With Heatran being extremely popular and immune to Fire-type moves, and with Ground-type foes being immune to Electric-type attacks, Rotom-H's STAB combination is a risky one to be Choice-locked into, so prediction is key. This will also give Rotom-H a lot of problems breaking down bulky foes. Many times, when facing a bulky foe such as Chansey, it is better to either Trick Rotom-H's Choice Scarf onto them or pivot out with Volt Switch into a teammate that can handle them better. Don't lock Rotom-H into Trick when your opponent has their Mega Pokemon on the field or you suspect they will switch to it. This gives the foe a free setup opportunity and can also lead to it inflicting a lot of damage on your team. Beware of all the Fake Out + Extreme Speed users and other priority users, as they obviously make Rotom-H's Choice Scarf useless. This set also has the added bonus of surprise factor, which allows it to revenge kill many unsuspecting foes particularly when the opponent leaves their Pokemon in, expecting it to outspeed Rotom-H.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wallbreakers such as Keldeo, Mega Scizor, Thundurus, and Ursaring are able to take care of bulky foes that give Rotom-H trouble. Counters to priority users, such as Will-O-Wisp Sableye, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn, can stop them from damaging Rotom-H before it can move. Entry hazard setters such as Garchomp, Heatran, and Ferrothorn are able to damage the foe over the course of the battle, which can help Rotom-H have an easier time KOing them. Entry hazard removers such as Landorus-T, Rapid Spin Porygon2, and Skarmory are also good partners, as they let Rotom-H switch in freely multiple times. VoltTurn staples such as Landorus-T, Parting Shot Sableye, and Thundurus are able to keep up momentum by switching to keep the foe on their toes and maintain offensive pressure.</p>"

This, combined with its decent bulk, allows Rotom-W to check a lot of common threats such as Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, and Heatran. Rotom-W is also a good status sponge because of its immunity to paralysis. It can support its team by spreading status in the form of Nuzzle, Scald, and Will-O-Wisp and can keep momentum up with Volt Switch. These traits make Rotom-W easy to fit on many teams and playstyles. However, Rotom-W has average Speed and HP, which can lead to issues such as being outsped or not being able to take an extra hit at times. Finally, it lacks access to decent coverage moves and has no form of reliable recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Discharge is an alternative to Nuzzle that trades the 100% paralysis chance for a 30% one but hits much harder. Choice Specs can also be run to allow Rotom-W to hit harder. Whirlpool can be used to trap a foe and wear it down when paired with Toxic; however, this set is outclassed by other trappers such as Heatran, as Rotom-W doesn't have Taunt and can do nothing to stop the foe from healing itself while trapped. Soak can be used to make the foe a Water-type, followed by hitting them with a now-super effective Thunderbolt. Destiny Bond is an option to catch the foe by surprise and take it out.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Special Walls</strong>: Bulky special walls such as Chansey, Porygon2, and Meloetta don't take much damage from Rotom-W's attacks.

Nuzzle paralyzes the foe and in many cases cripples it for the rest of the match, while Will-O-Wisp, although less accurate, can be used to better deal with physical attackers. Pain Split is Rotom-W's main form of recovery, which works well when paired with Nuzzle because after the foe has been paralyzed, Rotom-W can easily outspeed it and heal itself before the foe attacks. Rest is another recovery option that also cures status, and it is not dependent on the foe's health. However, it is mainly has one-time use.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Levitate, Rotom-W's only ability, makes it immune to Ground-type moves, which would otherwise be a weakness. Leftovers allows Rotom-W to regain health each turn, helping it take more hits. Chesto Berry should be used if Rest is chosen instead of Pain Split, waking Rotom-W up immediately and serving as a one-time full restore. A Bold nature helps to increase Rotom-W's physical bulk, and it works well when paired with burn support and maximum HP EVs. 8 Speed EVs can be run to allow Rotom-W to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt, while 128 would make it outpace Adamant Breloom and Bisharp. An alternative spread with an investment of 252 EVs in Special Defense instead of Defense and a Calm nature allows Rotom-W to take special hits as well.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-W has the bulk to switch in on Pokemon it checks such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, Tornadus-T, and Heatran. Its access to a slow Volt Switch allows it to pivot into a teammate that can either KO the foe or set up on it. Choose which status move you want to use on the foe and decide which will support your team better. If you are facing a strong physical attacker, a burn is beneficial; if you struggle with faster foes, paralysis might support you better. Also make sure to be careful when using Scald, as it could inadvertently burn something you would rather have paralyzed. Avoid accidentally healing the foe with Pain Split; in particular, watch out for the opponent switching to a weakened member of their team. Remember that Pain Split is based on the total HP number, not percentage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel- and Flying-types, such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, Scizor, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T make for good teammates for Rotom-W, as they are able to switch into or eliminate Grass-types that trouble it. In return, Rotom-W can eliminate the foes they struggle with. Fire- and Grass-types have good synergy with Rotom-W and allow for a Fire / Water / Grass core. Mega Charizard X, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Celebi are examples of good teammates. Entry hazard setters such as Garchomp, Heatran, and Tyranitar are good options as well, setting up entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes and helping to wear down the foes over the length of the battle.</p> <p>While Rotom-W isn't weak to entry hazards, it still appreciates hazard removal because it will switch in multiple times and doesn't like taking the damage each time. Defog Gyarados, Landorus-T, and Rapid Spin Porygon2 and Chansey make good teammates. Pokemon such as U-turn Landorus-T, Thundurus-T, Scizor, and Parting Shot Sableye work well with Rotom-W, as they are able to help keep up momentum. Landorus-T makes for a particularly good partner for Rotom-W because they cover each other's weaknesses, and Landorus-T can set and remove hazards for Rotom-W. The two can also keep up momentum together with their VoltTurn combination. Finally, wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Scizor, Mega Lopunny, Thundurus, and Kyurem-B make for good teammates by taking down the special walls that Rotom-W otherwise struggles with.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to switch out to maintain momentum. Origin Pulse is Rotom-W's main STAB move that hits the foe hard. Water Spout is an option that hits harder than Origin Pulse when Rotom-W is near full health. However, Rotom-W sometimes struggles in STABmons due to the amount of priority in the metagame. Thunderbolt is an option for a stronger Electric-type STAB move that hits harder than Volt Switch without shuffling Rotom-W out. It also handles Substitute users such as Keldeo and Gyarados easier. Trick allows Rotom-W to switch its item with the foe, which can really cripple bulky foes like Chansey and Porygon2 by locking them into one move. Scald is another option to use to try to get a quick burn on a physical attacker, also crippling it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf allows Rotom-W to make up for its below-average Speed and attack first most of the time. A Timid nature paired with maximum EVs in Speed and a Choice Scarf serve to make Rotom-W as fast as possible. Maximum EVs in Special Attack allow it to hit as hard as possible. Levitate, Rotom-W's only ability, is used to give it an immunity to Ground-types, leaving it with just one weakness.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With Choice Scarf, prediction is key. If you predict the opponent will switch into a specially defensive wall, use Trick. If you think a Ground-type is coming in, Origin Pulse works well; otherwise, Volt Switch is good for scouting, maintaining momentum, and getting chip damage. However, don't be afraid to switch out manually if you predict your opponent will switch. Don't use Volt Switch or Thunderbolt into a Ground-type, which would allow the opponent an easy setup opportunity. Choice Scarf Rotom-W works best as a revenge killer or when it is brought in with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. This set also has a surprise factor, as Choice Scarf isn't generally expected.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wallbreakers such as Tornadus, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Scizor make for good teammates, as they are able to eliminate the walls that Rotom-W would otherwise struggle with. Entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon work well by laying down hazards such as Spikes and Stealth Rock that weaken the foes as they switch in. Other Pokemon that can form a VoltTurn core such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, Parting Shot Sableye, and Scizor make for good partners, as they are able to help keep up momentum. Scizor, especially Choice Band variants, works well with Rotom-W because they resist each other's weaknesses and form a powerful VoltTurn combination. Latios, Latias, and Kyurem-B checks, such as Ferrothorn, Weavile, and Tyranitar, make for good teammates, as these powerful Dragon-types can give Rotom-W trouble. Pursuit users such as Weavile and Tyranitar work well to take advantage of the Volt Switches. Fire- and Grass-types have good synergy with Rotom-W and allow for a Fire / Water / Grass core. Mega Charizard X, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Celebi are some Pokemon that can be in such a core.</p>"

  "Serperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Serperior is very useful in the STABmons metagame because of its access to an excellent ability in Contrary. With a very high base 113 Speed and a strong 130 Base Power STAB move to abuse Contrary with to gain boosts in Special Attack, Serperior is a top threat. Because of its access to Spore to cripple its checks and counters and gain free turns, it can sweep unprepared teams at a moment's notice. Serperior's Speed allows it to outrun notable Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Mega Latias, Gengar, and Thundurus. Unfortunately, its stats other than its Speed are subpar, and it often needs to get to +2 or +4 in Special Attack in order to successfully sweep. With the incline in usage of Pixilate FakeSpeed from the likes of Sylveon, Serperior really struggles due to its lacking bulk. Serperior also has limited coverage, as it is heavily reliant on Hidden Power, and it is held back because it is very predictable, but it is nonetheless a very good Pokemon in STABmons.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragon Pulse can be used to eliminate bulky Dragons that avoid the 2HKO from Leaf Storm or Hidden Power Ground. Aromatherapy is useful to remove status from Serperior if you aren't using Substitute. Knock Off is useful for removing Chansey's Eviolite, as Chansey is 2HKOed by Leaf Storm without its Eviolite, and it hits Gengar for solid damage as well. Giga Drain can be used for recovery, although having two Grass-type moves offers very bad coverage, and Leaf Storm is necessary on Serperior. Glare is useful for spreading paralysis, especially for Ground-types such as Landorus-T on the switch, as well as paralyzing Grass-types, including opposing Serperior and Mega Sceptile. Dragon Tail racks up more chip damage on Serperior's checks and counters by forcing them out and making them take more residual damage from switching in on entry hazards and boosted Leaf Storms. Synthesis is useful, as it allows Serperior to recover health from passive damage and entry hazards when it's facing sleeping Pokemon and thus can be used over Substitute.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Mega Sceptile, and Mega Venusaur are immune to Spore and resist Leaf Storm, which is Serperior's main way of doing damage. Mega Venusaur and Mega Sceptile both take neutral damage from Hidden Power Fire as well. Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur threaten Serperior with their Poison-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Aegislash, Scizor, Mega Scizor, and Heatran can come in relatively easily on Serperior, as they resist its STAB move, Leaf Storm. However, they must watch out for Hidden Power, and all but Ferrothorn hate Spore.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast Pokemon such as Weavile and Mega Pidgeot, Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, and priority users such as Fake Out + Extreme Speed users, including Braviary, Kangaskhan, Stoutland, and Ursaring, can defeat Serperior. Icicle Spear from the likes of Weavile and Kyurem-B will also break through Serperior's Substitute and OHKO it. Other effective priority users include Sableye, as Prankster Topsy Turvy halts attempted sweeps, and Thundurus, as Prankster Thunder Wave severely cripples Serperior. Fake Out + Extreme Speed users and most Choice Scarf users can't revenge kill Serperior if it is behind a Substitute, however, which also blocks Thundurus's Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fast U-turn Users</strong>: Fast U-turn users such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Talonflame can break Serperior's Substitute, allowing it to be revenge killed easier or forced out.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Unaware Clefable</strong>: Specially defensive Unaware Clefable isn't 2HKOed by Leaf Storm and can proceed to stall it out; however, it doesn't like Spore.</p> <p><strong>Sound-based Moves</strong>: Sound-based moves such as Bug Buzz and Boomburst hit through Serperior's Substitute and can KO it, especially from faster Pokemon such as a boosted Volcarona and Sylveon.</p> <p><strong>Special Tanks</strong>: Bulky specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Assault Vest Meloetta, Sylveon, and Porygon2 can all come in safely after Serperior has used Spore and deal with it via Whirlwind, Boomburst, and Ice Beam, respectively. Porygon2 can also run Whirlwind and Boomburst.</p>",

      "Contrary Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spore gives Serperior free turns because it puts the foe to sleep. Leaf Storm is a strong STAB move that gives Serperior +2 Special Attack when it's used in conjunction with Contrary. Hidden Power Fire hits the majority of Steel-types, such as Aegislash, Bisharp, Magnezone, and, in particular, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Scizor, hard, with the latter three Pokemon being 4x resistant to Leaf Storm. Hidden Power Ground nails the usual Serperior switch-in, Heatran, very hard while still hitting Bisharp and Aegislash for the same amount of damage as Hidden Power Fire, as well as hitting Magnezone for 4x damage instead of 2x. Hidden Power Ground also hits Mega Charizard X. Substitute allows Serperior to dodge status that would otherwise halt its sweep such as paralysis, and it provides Serperior with protection against revenge killers. Taunt can be used over Substitute to shut down status move users and can prevent Chansey from using Transform when Serperior is low on health, which could lead to a counter sweep, or Whirlwind, which can phaze Serperior.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Serperior to outspeed the multitude of Pokemon in the base 110 Speed tier, such as Mega Diancie and Gengar, as well as Thundurus, and 252 Special Attack EVs let Serperior hit as hard as possible. Contrary is the ability of choice so that Leaf Storm's negative side effect is actually positive, giving Serperior a +2 Special Attack boost instead of a -2 Special Attack drop. Miracle Seed boosts the power of Leaf Storm, whereas Leftovers offers passive recovery and allows Serperior to set more Substitutes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Serperior is rather frail, so it relies on getting a safe switch in. A slow U-turn or Volt Switch is excellent and is very helpful to Serperior. Serperior can also be brought in on a predicted Defog, as this will grant it an evasion boost that can be useful in dodging priority and other moves from potential revenge killers later on in the match. Once Serperior is on the field, you should generally use Spore first. If the target is asleep, Serperior should then set up a Substitute. Finally, it should attempt a sweep by nabbing boosts with Leaf Storm. Leaf Storm only has 8 PP, and Serperior is very reliant on using it to gain boosts and sweep, so be careful when choosing to attempt a sweep. In general, Serperior should attempt to sweep late-game, after its checks and counters have been weakened or KOed. Serperior can be also brought in early-game, but, in this stage of the game, it should generally just be for the utility of using a fast Spore to become an anti-lead and to spread sleep for teammates to rip holes in the opposing team. Substitute should be set up on predicted switches or when the foe is asleep to prevent status ailments and provide a buff against revenge killers such as Choice Scarf users and faster Pokemon such as Mega Pidgeot and Weavile. If you're using Taunt on Serperior, use it against stall Pokemon when you predict status moves such as entry hazards, Toxic, recovery moves, and Transform.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone is a great partner to trap and remove the Steel-types that trouble Serperior, such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Bulky support Landorus-T is also a good teammate for Serperior, as it provides Defog support, entry hazard support, and a safe switch in via U-turn. Clefable can provide Wish and Heal Bell support to Serperior, boosting its longevity. Heatran is an amazing teammate, as it has excellent defensive synergy with Serperior because it resists or is immune to all of Serperior's weaknesses and can also dispatch Steel-types with ease or set up entry hazards. Espeon and Azelf provide screens and entry hazard control, Espeon with Magic Bounce and Azelf with a fast Taunt before setting up entry hazards in return, and then heal up Serperior with Lunar Dance, allowing it to have another shot at sweeping. Lunar Dance is especially helpful, as it restores the Leaf Storm's PP as well. Rock-types, such as Terrakion and Tyranitar, are good teammates as well, as they can easily switch in against the opposing Flying-types that force Serperior out and set up entry hazards.</p>"

  "Stoutland": {
    "overview": "<p>Stoutland is a good physical attacker in the STABmons metagame thanks to its access to Scrappy Fake Out + Extreme Speed, solid base 110 Attack, and decent 85 / 90 / 90 bulk. It also has the ability to use Scrappy Rapid Spin, which makes it a better entry hazard remover than any Defogger. Because it has amazing coverage moves in its first three moveslots, it can run a utility move in the fourth. While it faces competition from Mega Lopunny and Ursaring, it doesn't take up a Mega slot like Mega Lopunny does, and it can use Scrappy Rapid Spin unlike Ursaring.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Glare can be used in the fourth moveslot to ensure that Stoutland outspeeds its foes, specifically Mega Lopunny, to KO them more easily. Don't use Crunch because Scrappy lets Stoutland hit Ghost-types with STAB- and Silk Scarf-boosted Normal-type moves anyway. Pursuit can be used to trap Pokemon that switch out of Fake Out + Extreme Speed, such as Gengar, Latios, Meloetta, and Hoopa-U. It also gives Stoutland a way to target Ghost- and Psychic-types, which fear Scrappy Fake Out + Extreme Speed, more easily Swords Dance can be run over Fake Out to let Stoutland easily clean up mid- to late-game. Make sure to use Protect in the fourth slot with Swords Dance, as it gives Stoutland a way to avoid taking damage and a way to hurt High Jump Kick users such as Mega Lopunny and Terrakion. A Lum Berry can be run with this set to prevent Stoutland from being burned, paralyzed, badly poisoned, or put to sleep; this set faces tremendous competition with Mega Lopunny, though. Life Orb can be used instead of Silk Scarf for more all-around damage. It lets Stoutland 2HKO Ferrothorn with Superpower, but the residual damage that it applies when used in tandem with Fake Out isn't good; nevertheless, it works well if Recover is used in the fourth moveslot, in the same way that Life Orb + Roost Latios works. Keep in mind that the recoil stacks up annoyingly quickly. Toxic wears down the bulky Ground- and Water-types that Stoutland has a hard time KOing, such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Mega Slowbro.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types:</strong> Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Scizor have enough bulk to survive multiple hits from Stoutland. Ferrothorn has Iron Barbs to damage Stoutland with any move it makes, Scizor has a lot of strong attacks to KO Stoutland with, and both Ferrothorn and Heatran have enough bulk to survive a Superpower and commonly run King's Shield to weaken physical attackers, making it hard for Stoutland to KO them.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, and Keldeo outspeed and easily KO Stoutland with High Jump Kick, Close Combat, and Secret Sword, and Terrakion also resists Normal and therefore doesn't mind Stoutland's Fake Out + Extreme Speed. However, Keldeo is revenge killed by that combination.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status spreaders such as Thunder Wave Klefki and Clefable, Will-O-Wisp Sableye, and Lava Plume Heatran severely cripple Stoutland by either slowing it down or halving its Attack.</p> <p><strong>Faster Extreme Speed Users</strong>: Faster Extreme Speed users such as Mega Lopunny and Kangaskhan are stronger than Stoutland and KO it easily with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers That Resist Normal-type Moves</strong>: Faster attackers that resist Normal-type moves such as Jirachi, Terrakion, and Aerodactyl all have strong moves that easily KO Stoutland, and Terrakion OHKOes it with Close Combat or High Jump Kick.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, Skarmory, and Mega Slowbro all survive a hit from and can KO Stoutland, and Landorus-T's Intimidate lowers Stoutland's already mediocre Attack; however, Toxic wears Landorus-T and Mega Slowbro down. Mega Scizor and Skarmory are immune to Toxic, resist Fake Out + Extreme Speed, and can deal a lot of damage to Stoutland.</p>",

      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out lets Stoutland deal chip damage to faster, frailer attackers that threaten it and its teammates, as well as slower, bulkier attackers that would otherwise survive a hit from it. Extreme Speed, when used in tandem with Fake Out, gives Stoutland a way to reliably revenge kill a plethora of Pokemon and has high priority and overall decent coverage. Superpower hits the Rock- and Steel-types that Fake Out and Extreme Speed can't, such as Terrakion, Tyranitar, and Heatran, super effectively; however, it's risky to use Superpower against Heatran because it commonly runs King's Shield, which can heavily weaken Stoutland. Rapid Spin clears entry hazards so that Stoutland's teammates have an easier time switching in, boosting the team's longevity, and it doesn't remove the entry hazards that Stoutland's teammates set, unlike Defog. Baton Pass is used to let Stoutland switch out of physical walls such as Landorus-T and Steel-types such as Mega Scizor. Fire Fang is an alternative option to Superpower, as it gives Stoutland a way to take care of Ferrothorn, Scizor, Mega Scizor, and Klefki, but it gives Stoutland a harder time dealing with Rock-types and Heatran. Recover can be used to restore lost health so that Stoutland can stay on the field and attack for longer.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs and an Adamant nature are used to let Stoutland hit as hard and move as fast as possible so that it can outspeed and KO Pokemon such as Ursaring more easily. An EV spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe can be used to let Stoutland have more bulk and enough Speed to let its Extreme Speed still hit first when it's facing Jolly Ursaring. Silk Scarf boosts Stoutland's Normal-type STAB moves even further to KO a bigger range of Pokemon. Scrappy lets Stoutland hit Ghost-types such as Gengar and Sableye with Fake Out and Extreme Speed, as well as hit Sableye super effectively with Superpower.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to use Stoutland as a revenge killer, as it easily takes care of threatening foes with Fake Out + Extreme Speed. When Stoutland is facing a King's Shield user, try to use a status move if you're running one on Stoutland, or switch out to prevent Stoutland from being weakened. Don't use Stoutland against Scizor and Ferrothorn if you're running Superpower on it; both will survive two Superpowers, and the latter has Iron Barbs to inflict residual damage. Avoid Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs damage to keep Stoutland healthy for as long as possible. Use Fake Out to deal chip damage to bulkier foes to help Stoutland and its teammates KO them more easily. Try not to switch Stoutland directly into attacks so that you don't risk it getting KOed. Try to use Rapid Spin on free turns generated by forced switches, and use Baton Pass to get away from King's Shield and Iron Barbs easily.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stoutland is a good fit on hyper offense, bulky offense, and balance teams. Landorus-T is a good teammate because it can take care of Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny and Terrakion. Ghost-types such as Gengar and Sableye can be used instead of Landorus-T, but Mega Lopunny can KO them easily because of Scrappy. Pokemon that like Gengar and Mega Sableye gone, such as Terrakion and Gengar, enjoy Stoutland as a teammate because of its ability to easily KO both. Special attackers and Fire-type absorbers such as Keldeo and Heatran give Stoutland a way to switch out of Will-O-Wisp and Parting Shot. Pokemon that can take care of Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Heatran are good teammates; examples are Thundurus, Keldeo, and a Heatran of your own. Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot users such as Magnezone, Scizor, Mega Scizor, Sableye, and Weavile give Stoutland a way to switch into powerful attackers such as Keldeo and Terrakion. Entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Klefki are good teammates because the switches that Stoutland forces makes the foes take a lot of residual damage. Klefki can also paralyze and tank hits from Terrakion and Mega Lopunny, which makes it a worthwhile teammate for Stoutland.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn's decent 74 / 131 / 116 bulk combined with access to reliable recovery in Synthesis and useful status moves such as Spore and Stealth Rock make it one of the premier walls of STABmons. In addition to this, Ferrothorn is both a fantastic check to Kyurem-B and one of the hardest Pokemon to switch into, as it has access to both Spore and Leech Seed to wear down its foes. Ferrothorn also has a decent Attack stat, and it can choose between a strong Gyro Ball, which hits hard thanks to its low Speed stat, and Power Whip, which allows it to hit Water-types such as Quagsire and Rock-types such as Tyranitar.</p> <p>However, although Ferrothorn has a decent typing that allows it to switch in on threats such as Azumarill, its typing also gives it a troubling 4x weakness to Fire-type moves from Pokemon such as Heatran. In addition to this, Ferrothorn has four-moveslot syndrome, and it can be hard to fit in all of its options on one set at times. Thundurus's presence is a major issue, as it can shut Ferrothorn down and set up on it. Ferrothorn also has a bad matchup against defensive teams due to its reliance on Iron Barbs, Leech Seed, and King's Shield to deal damage and the prevalence of Mega Sableye.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aromatherapy is great for teams that need a cleric and allows Ferrothorn to better switch into Scald users such as Quagsire, but Ferrothorn usually doesn't have the moveslot for it. Spikes is a good option for stacking entry hazards and dealing additional chip damage if Ferrothorn has room for it. Shed Shell is an option, as it prevents Ferrothorn from being trapped by Magnezone, but the recovery from Leftovers or the damage from Rocky Helmet is slightly more useful. Spiky Shield can be used instead of King's Shield for the extra damage and the ability to block status moves, but it makes Ferrothorn more vulnerable to physical attackers. Thunder Wave can be run over Spore, but it reduces Gyro Ball's damage and is not as effective overall at crippling opposing Pokemon. Knock Off removes key items such as Eviolite and Choice Scarf and allows teammates to have a much easier time sweeping, but Ferrothorn usually lacks the moveslot for it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye shuts down status moves and entry hazards with Magic Bounce and easily tanks any attack Ferrothorn has. In addition to this, it can also cripple Ferrothorn with Will-O-Wisp or set up Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran are not afraid of Gyro Ball or Power Whip and can retaliate with their super effective STAB attacks. However, most have to be wary of switching into status moves such as Leech Seed and Spore and hate taking Stealth Rock damage when they switch in.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Tangrowth can absorb Spore and Leech Seed while shrugging off Ferrothorn's attacks. Additionally, some carry moves that can threaten Ferrothorn, such as Hidden Power Fire and Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Magnezone is able to prevent Ferrothorn from switching out due to Magnet Pull, and then it can either OHKO or 2HKO it with Hidden Power Fire depending on whether it holds Choice Specs or Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Thundurus</strong>: Thundurus is not 2HKOed by any of Ferrothorn's offensive moves and can shut it down with Taunt or set up with Nasty Plot while staying healthy via Oblivion Wing. Even without Nasty Plot, it can still easily break through Ferrothorn with Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Substitute, Taunt, and Setup Users</strong>: Boosting Pokemon that resist Ferrothorn's attacks, such as Mega Charizard X, and Pokemon that can neutralize its status moves with either Taunt or Substitute, such as Serperior, are able to take advantage of Ferrothorn.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Synthesis grants reliable recovery and allows Ferrothorn to stay healthy during the match. Stealth Rock is an alternative that allows it to deal chip damage to the opponent's team. Gyro Ball is a very powerful attack on faster offensive Pokemon such as Terrakion and Serperior, while Power Whip allows Ferrothorn to hit Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Azumarill and Quagsire. Leech Seed gives Ferrothorn additional recovery while crippling most of its threats, and it should only be chosen if paired with King's Shield. Spore cripples most Pokemon that switch in and gives Ferrothorn's teammates opportunities to set up or apply offensive pressure. King's Shield allows Ferrothorn to force mind games and works well with Leech Seed, as the combination allows it to beat Pokemon such as Fake Out + Extreme Speed Ursaring.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Ferrothorn to survive two Brave Birds from Life Orb Adamant Aerodactyl after Leftovers recovery and Stealth Rock damage. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs ensure that Gyro Ball is always fully powered; however, if Power Whip is preferred over it, an Impish nature and 31 Speed IVs should be run instead. Leftovers gives Ferrothorn passive recovery and allows it to stay healthy without having to use Synthesis. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet works well in conjunction with Iron Barbs, as the combination can severely punish physical attackers that use contact moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Lead with Ferrothorn if it carries Stealth Rock unless your opponent has a threatening Pokemon such as Heatran. It should also switch into weaker physical attacks such as Extreme Speed and punish their users with the damage from Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet should it be carrying the item. Ferrothorn should use King's Shield early-game in order to scout for Pokemon with Choice items, such as Azumarill. Save Spore for a key target that your team cannot handle or needs disabled in order to win the game, and predict when the opponent will send in a Pokemon as sleep fodder. Use Leech Seed to cripple the opposing Pokemon and to deal further chip damage while keeping Ferrothorn healthy if it lacks Synthesis. Due to its low PP, Ferrothorn should only use Synthesis when necessary, and it should focus more on crippling the opponent's team with its status moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Clefable complements Ferrothorn well, as it is able to take on Mega Sableye and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Terrakion, which give Ferrothorn trouble, and can heal it of status, while Ferrothorn protects Clefable from Steel- and Poison-types such as Bisharp and Gengar. A bulky Water-type such as Quagsire or Slowking can help against Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran that Ferrothorn cannot effectively face, while Ferrothorn can absorb Spore and handle Grass-type Pokemon such as Serperior lacking Hidden Power Fire. Offensive Heatran is able to beat most of the Pokemon that threaten Ferrothorn, taking out walls such as Tangrowth and Clefable. Pokemon that are able to take advantage of Ferrothorn's Spore and entry hazards, such as Weavile, appreciate the ability to sweep more easily. Mega Latias can soak up most of the Fire- and Fighting-type attacks from threatening Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Terrakion.</p>"

  "Braviary": {
    "overview": "<p>Braviary is one of the most efficient revenge killers in STABmons thanks to its combination of Fake Out and Extreme Speed backed up with some decent stats and Defiant. With Defiant, Braviary isn't forced out by Intimidate users such as Gyarados and Landorus-T and is able to pressure Defoggers and ignore any King's Shield Attack drops. Defiant also gives Braviary its niche over other Normal-types such as Ursaring, Mega Lopunny, and Stoutland, which would otherwise outclass it. Compared to Mega Lopunny, Braviary's Speed tier isn't the best, meaning it can be easily beaten by faster Pokemon that resist both of its STAB moves. Braviary is also a pretty one-dimensional Pokemon, allowing it to be easily played around at times; furthermore, it is threatened by Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Outside of being a top-notch revenge killer in STABmons, Braviary doesn't have much going for it, as other Pokemon can easily fulfill other roles it can attempt to perform. Braviary can run a Choice Band set to hit defensive Pokemon harder, but this isn't recommended, as Braviary needs the freedom to be able to use its coverage moves when it wants to. Braviary gets Tailwind but usually lacks the moveslot to use it effectively. Swords Dance is another option that could be used over Fake Out to make Braviary a threatening sweeper rather than a revenge killer. U-turn is a great tool for Braviary to get momentum for the rest of the team but is usually inferior to Baton Pass, which can pass off boost from Defiant or either Swords Dance or Bulk Up to another Pokemon. Recover can allow Braviary to live longer. However, these sets are not as successful because running Baton Pass with Bulk Up or Swords Dance causes Braviary to forgo an essential coverage move, and running Recover compromises Braviary's power or its bulk.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fast Rock-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Terrakion, Mega Diancie, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar can switch in on one of Braviary's priority moves and either threaten it to switch out or OHKO it with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet hinders Braviary from spamming its attacks, as all the moves Braviary utilizes make contact. Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Skarmory often run this item. However, Landorus-T must be careful, as it takes more damage due to Intimidate giving Braviary a +1 Attack boost.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Skarmory, Excadrill, and Mega Scizor can handle Braviary, although Excadrill should be wary of Superpower. Mega Scizor and Excadrill can also easily set up on Braviary with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar is able to switch in on Braviary's Fake Out and Extreme Speed due to its immunity to Normal-type moves and can hit back really hard. Mega Sableye is able to tank a hit and get Will-O-Wisp off to cripple it and then recover the damage it takes.</p>",

      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out and Extreme Speed are reliable priority moves that allow Braviary to revenge kill Pokemon with ease, as it receives STAB on both. Dragon Ascent is pretty spammable and hits a lot of defensive walls, such as Hippowdon, harder than Fake Out and Extreme Speed. Lastly, Superpower allows Braviary to hit Steel-types, which would otherwise wall it due to its two STAB moves being unable to break through them.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Braviary's niche lies in its ability to take advantage of Defiant and not be easily threatened by common moves and abilities such as King's Shield and Intimidate. Braviary's EV spread and nature maximize its power and allow to hit a variety of defensive Pokemon. Silk Scarf is the preferred item, as it boosts the power of Fake Out and Extreme Speed, allowing Braviary to revenge kill much more efficiently. Life Orb is an option to give Braviary's other STAB and coverage moves more power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Braviary is one of the most reliable revenge killers out there, since it isn't easily forced out by Pokemon like Landorus-T and Ferrothorn. Dragon Ascent breaks down a ton of bulky Pokemon to be finished by other Pokemon. Momentum-gaining moves such as U-turn, Volt Switch, Baton Pass, and Healing Wish give Braviary a chance to revenge kill Pokemon with its priority moves or hit something really hard with Dragon Ascent. Due to this set's lack of Roost, it gets easily worn down by Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, and Iron Barbs, so it's best to try to avoid them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removers such as Defog Landorus-T, Defog Latios, and even Rapid Spin Starmie all aid Braviary's longevity by removing Stealth Rock. Special wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y and Meloetta are also great partners because they can easily break through a lot of physically defensive Pokemon like Mega Slowbro and Rotom-W. Pivots such as Rotom-W and Rotom-H are options to give Braviary a free switch in.</p>"

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>Terrakion is a very versatile and strong attacker that has a good base 108 Speed and base 129 Attack, which let it outspeed and easily KO threatening Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y. It also checks dangerous attackers, especially Dark-types such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile, and its Rock / Fighting typing gives it a nice resistance to Normal-type moves such as Fake Out and Extreme Speed. Not only that, Terrakion has access to priority in Mach Punch, which lets it finish off weakened threats. Terrakion has access to almost no viable coverage moves bar Iron Head, but it doesn't really need coverage moves to be usable, as it has access to Close Combat and Diamond Storm, both of which are boosted by STAB and have almost perfect neutral coverage. However, Terrakion has a bad defensive typing that leaves it weak to common attacking types in Fighting, Ground, Fairy, and Psychic. Adding onto that, Terrakion also has mediocre 91 / 90 / 90 bulk, which means it can easily be KOed by a lot of common threats in STABmons, such as Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, and Keldeo. Terrakion is also KOed really quickly due to the fact that it commonly uses Life Orb, and the prevalence of priority users in STABmons makes it difficult for it to stay healthy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Band can be used over Choice Scarf on the second set with Mach Punch instead of Toxic, as this gives Terrakion outrageous power and the loss of Speed makes priority a necessity. Rock Polish can be used over Mach Punch on the first set to form a double dance set. Be sure, if you use this, to set up Swords Dance when facing slower, bulkier teams and to set up Rock Polish versus faster, frailer teams; try to set up both if possible. Don't use Earthquake on either set because, while it might seem like a good idea, it's practically useless due to Terrakion's already good neutral coverage. You could run an Adamant nature on the Choice Scarf set to provide more power, but this means that Terrakion is outsped by opposing Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo and Terrakion. Final Gambit is also an option on the Choice Scarf set to quickly outspeed and KO threatening foes, but it is risky to use due to some foes having more HP than Terrakion.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Gliscor are threatening to Terrakion because they all resist at least one of its two STAB types and can survive one hit from it and KO it in return. Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon are especially threatening because Landorus-T's ability, Intimidate, hinders Terrakion's ability to successfully attack foes; Garchomp's Rough Skin makes it hard for Terrakion to attack with a neutrally effective move without taking too much damage, as all of Terrakion's Fighting-type moves make contact; and Hippowdon is generally bulky and can 2HKO Terrakion with Earthquake and possibly OHKO it with Precipice Blades.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Mega Slowbro, Keldeo, Azumarill, Manaphy, and Unaware Quagsire can all KO Terrakion with their Water-type STAB moves, and Mega Slowbro, Keldeo, Azumarill, and Quagsire all resist one of its two STAB types. Mega Slowbro is bulky enough to survive any of Terrakion's moves, even after a Swords Dance, it will still have enough health to KO in return, and both of its STAB moves KO Terrakion.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority users such as Fake Out + Extreme Speed Mega Lopunny; Mach Punch Breloom, Mega Medicham, and opposing Terrakion; Bullet Punch Mega Scizor; Water Shuriken Azumarill and Gyarados; Will-O-Wisp or Parting Shot Sableye; and Dragon Ascent Talonflame are all threatening to Terrakion because of their ability to easily KO or cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Diancie, Serperior, and Latios can all easily KO Life Orb Terrakion when it tries to revenge kill. However, Choice Scarf Terrakion outspeeds Mega Lopunny, Mega Diancie, Serperior, and Latios, and it Speed ties with Choice Scarf Keldeo, so Terrakion can still KO some faster revenge killers.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance lets Terrakion boost its Attack so that it can hit harder in the time span that it is on the field; it also lets Terrakion KO a larger field of foes. Stealth Rock can be used so that Terrakion can make it easier for it and its teammates to KO foes. Terrakion has the offensive presence to force switches, which makes it easier to set up either Swords Dance or Stealth Rock. Diamond Storm is the preferred Rock-type STAB move, as it is more accurate than both Rock Slide and Stone Edge and is stronger than Rock Slide, and it lets Terrakion KO common threats in the STABmons metagame such as Thundurus, Mega Charizard Y, Tornadus-T, Gyarados, and Weavile. Close Combat is used to KO possible threats to your team such as Heatran, Chansey, Magnezone, and opposing Terrakion. High Jump Kick can be used instead of Close Combat if you want a more powerful move on Terrakion that doesn't lower its defenses; however, it is less accurate and gives Terrakion trouble when facing Steel-types with the possibility of carrying King's Shield, which will make High Jump Kick miss and make Terrakion lose half of its health. Mach Punch lets Terrakion revenge kill weakened foes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Attack and Speed EVs are maximized to increase Terrakion's power and speed as much as possible. A Jolly nature is used to further increase Terrakion's Speed so that it can Speed tie with opposing Terrakion and outspeed unboosted Tyranitar. Life Orb boosts Terrakion's attacks to make up for the power drop from using a Jolly nature instead of an Adamant one. Justified is the only ability that Terrakion has access to, and it boosts its Attack when it is hit with a Dark-type move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When Terrakion is on the field, use the appropriate move to KO or damage the foe as much as possible. If the foe resists or is immune to one of Terrakion's moves or outspeeds and can possibly KO Terrakion, switch into a different Pokemon that checks or counters it. Use Terrakion to force out frail attackers like Thundurus and Weavile after a teammate is KOed and set up Swords Dance on the predicted switch. Make sure to switch Terrakion out of priority users and status inducers, as they both severely hinder its ability to be a useful attacker. If you're using Close Combat, be aware that it makes Terrakion more vulnerable to both physical and special attacks due to the drops in its defenses, which makes it more vulnerable to priority too. If you're running High Jump Kick, be aware that it has a chance to miss, and Terrakion will lose half of its health whenever the move misses or if it is used when the foe uses a protecting move. Try to predict when a foe uses a protecting move just to be safe.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Terrakion fits best on hyper offense teams because of its offensive presence, and it also partners well with sand setters such as Tyranitar and Hippowdon because of its Rock typing, as sand boosts its Special Defense, Tyranitar's secondary Dark typing gives it a helpful immunity to Psychic, and Hippowdon's bulk gives Terrakion a reliable teammate to switch places with. Terrakion likes having offensive entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Klefki to help it KO foes more easily. Terrakion also likes Psychic-, Flying-, and Fairy-types such as Starmie, Latios, Landorus-T, Mega Diancie, and Sylveon to take care of opposing Fighting-types. Fairy- and Grass-types such as Mega Diancie, Sylveon, and Serperior are also useful because of their ability to take care of Sableye and break down physical walls, especially bulky Ground-types. Terrakion also likes support from Steel- and Poison-types such as Excadrill, Scizor, Mega Scizor, and Gengar because they can take care of Fairy-types easily. Electric- and Grass-types such as Thundurus and Serperior are good teammates because they can take care of bulky Water-types such as Manaphy. Pokemon that like Ice-, Steel-, and Dark-types such as Mamoswine, Bisharp, and Weavile gone, such as Thundurus, Mega Diancie, and Gengar, appreciate Terrakion as a teammate because of how easily it takes care of those. Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot users such as Magnezone, Scizor, Sableye, and Weavile are good teammates for Terrakion because they can get it onto the field safely. Terrakion also appreciates Pursuit trappers and Dark-types in general as teammates because they can take care of Latios and Gengar easily.</p>"

Diamond Storm is Terrakion's go-to Rock-type STAB move because of its high accuracy and damage. It is used to KO Thundurus, Mega Charizard Y, Tornadus-T, Gyarados, Gengar, Weavile, and weakened Latios, and it has a chance to boost Terrakion's Defense; however, Terrakion probably won't be staying in long enough for the Defense boost to go to use. Toxic can be used to let Terrakion quickly damage threatening foes like Landorus-T, Hippowdon, Rotom-W, and Slowbro. Iron Head lets Terrakion KO opposing Fairy-types like Mega Diancie, whereas Head Smash lets weakened Terrakion severely damage a foe as it goes down.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Choice Scarf, Jolly nature, and 252 Speed EVs let Terrakion outspeed and KO foes that it normally wouldn't, such as weakened Serperior, non-Choice Scarf opposing Terrakion, Mega Diancie, Gengar, and Latios. Choice Scarf also lets Terrakion revenge kill Tornadus-T, +1 Mega Charizard X, +2 Adamant Scizor, and Mega Lopunny. 252 Attack EVs let Terrakion deal as much damage as possible without running an Adamant nature. Justified is the only usable ability, and it gives a free boost to Terrakion's Attack whenever it's hit by a Dark-type move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try not to switch Terrakion in if it isn't a safe switch, as it can easily be KOed by a lot of Pokemon. Use Terrakion to outspeed and KO Weavile and to revenge kill other Choice Scarf or Dragon Dance users. If Terrakion is facing a Prankster Pokemon with Parting Shot or Will-O-Wisp, switch into a Pokemon that has a momentum move and doesn't care about being weakened or burned to prevent Terrakion's Attack from being lowered.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Terrakion works best on hyper offense teams thanks to its great movepool and coverage while also having the ability to work well with sand setters such as Hippowdon and Tyranitar thanks to its typing. Offensive entry hazard setters such as Klefki and Garchomp are good options for teammates because they help Terrakion KO threatening foes more easily. Psychic-, Flying-, and Fairy-types such as Starmie, Latios, Landorus-T, Mega Diancie, and Sylveon are good teammates for Terrakion because they can take care of opposing Fighting-types. Terrakion also likes Fairy- and Grass-types such as Mega Diancie, Sylveon, and Serperior as teammates because of their ability to take care of Sableye and break down physical walls, especially bulky Ground-types. Steel- and Poison-types are also good teammates because they can take care of the Fairy-types that Terrakion can't KO with Iron Head, such as Sylveon. Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Thundurus and Serperior make for good teammates for Terrakion because they take care of the bulky Water-types that Terrakion is threatened by, such as Manaphy. Any Pokemon that enjoys having Ice-, Steel-, and Dark-types gone are good teammates for Terrakion, as it can outspeed and KO common Pokemon of those types, such as Weavile, Bisharp, and Tyranitar. Pokemon that run U-turn, Volt Switch, or Parting Shot, such as Magnezone, Scizor, Mega Scizor, Sableye, and Weavile, are good teammates for Terrakion because they can safely get it onto the field. Any Pokemon that likes opposing Terrakion to be KOed appreciates Terrakion as a teammate because it will always outspeed or Speed tie with the opponent's Terrakion, depending on the latter's set. Fire absorbers such as Heatran, bulky Pokemon such as Chansey, and special attackers such as Clefable are good teammates for Terrakion because they can take Will-O-Wisps for it. Pursuit trappers and Dark-types in general pair well with Terrakion too because they can take care of Latios and Gengar. Lunar Dance support from Latias and Latios is useful to give Terrakion a second chance. Magnezone is useful for taking care of Skarmory and Mega Scizor, as Terrakion can't do this due to the lack of Swords Dance.</p>"

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T is a top-tier threat in STABmons, being able to check or counter most of the top threats on opposing teams. Because of its versatility, it fits in on virtually every team and every playstyle. Landorus-T has Intimidate, great physical bulk, and a strong defensive typing, allowing it to check many physical attackers. It also has amazing Attack and an expansive movepool, making it capable of being either a great wallbreaker or sweeper. However, Landorus-T must choose between its access to support moves and reliable recovery and its high-Base Power STAB moves. Landorus-T is also prone to four-moveslot syndrome, often having to choose between coverage moves or choose which support move helps its team the best. It also possesses merely average Speed, giving it trouble keeping up with many threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T can use Spikes alongside Stealth Rock to serve as an entry hazard stacker. Landorus-T could also run a double dance set with Rock Polish and Swords Dance to set up to sweep, but it has problems with many priority users. With its good defensive stats and Intimidate, Landorus-T has the option to use Calm Mind to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense, attacking with Earth Power and Oblivion Wing, the latter of which also recovers HP. Because Landorus-T forces a lot of switches, it could run Substitute. If running the move, you should also run Salac Berry, use Substitute to activate it, and then use the turn behind the Substitute to use Swords Dance to try to sweep. Landorus-T is also capable of running a set comprising Stealth Rock or Spikes, Roost, Earthquake, and Stone Edge with Leftovers to take advantage of both its offensive and defensive abilities.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Kyurem-B, Cloyster, and Weavile are often able to OHKO Landorus-T with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Landorus-T cannot take Water-type STAB moves from the likes of Gyarados, Azumarill, and Cloyster well. Rotom-W is possibly the best Landorus-T counter in the metagame, as it is immune to Ground, resists Flying, and is able to either hit back with Origin Pulse or burn Landorus-T with Scald or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Fast special attackers such as Serperior, Tornadus, and Thundurus are able to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T and deal a lot of damage to if not outright KO it, as its Special Defense is just average.</p> <p><strong>Status Spreaders</strong>: Despite being immune to Thunder Wave, Landorus-T despises being burned or put to sleep from the likes of Sableye, Whimsicott, Serperior, Glare Porygon2, Rotom-W, and Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Physically defensive walls such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Mega Slowbro, Garchomp, and opposing Landorus-T are able to switch into attacks from Landorus-T and either cripple it with status, set up on it, or chip away at its health.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Defog helps Landorus-T support its team by clearing the field of entry hazards. Landorus-T makes for a good Defogger because it is immune to Spikes and neutral to Stealth Rock. Stealth Rock helps Landorus-T support its team by wearing down the foes as they switch in. Roost allows Landorus-T to restore half of its health, letting it stick around for a while. U-turn allows Landorus-T to switch out while maintaining momentum. Knock Off is an alternative to U-turn that has the advantage of ridding the foe of its item. Earthquake is Landorus-T's primary STAB attack and hits foes hard. Stone Edge is an alternative to hit foes such as Talonflame and Thundurus, which wouldn't mind Landorus-T otherwise.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given Defense EVs paired with an Impish nature and Intimidate help make Landorus-T a fierce physically defensive wall. 252 EVs in HP serve to make Landorus-T as bulky as possible. 8 Special Defense EVs may not seem like much, but they help Landorus-T survive certain hits such as Mega Manectric's Hidden Power Ice. 8 Speed EVs make a difference as well, allowing Landorus-T to outspeed threats such as Modest Magnezone. Leftovers grants Landorus-T some passive recovery each turn, and Rocky Helmet serves as an alternative item to punish the common Fake Out + Extreme Speed users.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With its good natural bulk and Intimidate, defensive Landorus-T is able to switch into many physical attackers, particularly the many Fake Out + Extreme Speed users. However, Landorus-T does not like Ice- or Water-types, so try to switch it out when you see them. Its U-turn can provide good momentum and create many opportunities to safely switch in your setup sweeper or a counter to the foe. Don't forget that Roost takes away Landorus-T's Flying typing for the rest of that turn, so beware of slow Ground-type attacks on turns Landorus-T uses Roost. Also be aware that Defog clears entry hazards on your side of the field as well as the opponent's, so if you rely on stacking entry hazards, know that using Defog will help the opponent too. Don't let the foe set up to sweep your team; if it starts to set up, U-turn out to a teammate that can handle the foe.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Special walls such as Chansey and Meloetta pair well with Landorus-T to back up its average Special Defense, forming a durable core. Landorus-T backs up their subpar Defense in return. Landorus-T also works well with Electric- and Rock-type Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Raikou, Mega Diancie, Terrakion, and Tyranitar. Landorus-T takes the Ground- and Electric-type moves that they don't appreciate, and they take out the Water- and Ice-types that Landorus-T struggles against in return. Being a Defogger, Landorus-T works well with Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as both Mega Charizard formes, Mega Pinsir, and Rotom-H, all of which can hit foes hard in return. Because some foes will try to set up on this passive Landorus-T, Pokemon like Unaware Clefable, Quagsire, Ditto, and Topsy-Turvy Sableye, which can stop setup sweepers, make for good teammates. Finally, Ferrothorn provides great defensive synergy with Landorus-T, and the two form a great defensive core together.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Precipice Blades is Landorus-T's premier STAB move and hits everything hard that doesn't resist it. However, if the move's imperfect accuracy scares you, Earthquake is an alternative that sacrifices some power for perfect accuracy. Dragon Ascent is Landorus-T's secondary STAB move that also hits many foes hard but lowers Landorus-T's Defense and Special Defense by one stage each time it is used. U-turn is good for getting chip damage and building momentum by switching into a teammate with a better matchup against the foe. Knock Off is good for ridding the foe of its item, potentially crippling its usefulness. Stone Edge is a good coverage move that hits many Flying-, Bug-, Fire-, and Ice-types hard. Hidden Power Ice is an alternative coverage move that is able to 2HKO opposing Landorus-T. Superpower is another option to surprise foes such as Ferrothorn and Tyranitar. Finally, Explosion is an option to keep momentum and inflict heavy damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum EVs in Attack allow Landorus-T to deal the most damage possible. A Jolly nature along with maximum Speed EVs and Choice Scarf allows Landorus-T to outspeed every unboosted foe in the game. If using Hidden Power Ice, a Naive nature should be used so as to not lower Landorus-T's Special Attack, and 30 Attack and Defense IVs should be used to give it Hidden Power Ice. Intimidate lowers the foe's Attack by one stage, weakening its offensive power, often forcing the foe to switch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Landorus-T can be used at any point in the game due to its versatility, but it works well early-game to help wear down the opposing team with U-turn, Knock Off, and its powerful STAB moves. It also works well late-game as a revenge killer. Choice Scarf locks Landorus-T into one move, so prediction is key. When in doubt, use U-turn and switch to a defensive teammate to take a hit from the foe. When using U-turn, it is important to predict your opponent's move and switch into a teammate that can take the hit. Switch out if your opponent switches in an Ice- or Water-type priority user such as Cloyster, Kyurem-B, or Azumarill. Landorus-T forces a lot of switches, so if you predict that the foe will switch, either use Knock Off to rid the switch-in of its item or use U-turn to keep up momentum and switch to a teammate with a better matchup against the switch-in. Running a Ground-type move on a Choice set is risky, so it is important to make sure that foes immune to Ground are eliminated before locking Landorus-T into it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Other Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Rotom-W, which has great type synergy with Landorus-T, Raikou, Celebi, and Magnezone can form a VoltTurn core with Landorus-T that helps build momentum and wear down the opposing team. Because it forces many switches, Landorus-T appreciates entry hazard support from teammates such as Heatran, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn, all of which Landorus-T can switch into Ground-type moves for. Water- and Rock-types also make for good teammates for Landorus-T in terms of defensive synergy. Water-types such as Blastoise and Starmie resist Water, while Landorus-T is immune to Electric. Rock-types such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie take out Ice-types, which Landorus-T doesn't like, and Landorus-T is immune to Ground. Landorus-T also pairs well with strong Fighting-types, such as Toxicroak and Mega Medicham, that can take down bulky foes such as Ferrothorn, Chansey, and Porygon2.</p>"

Stone Edge attains perfect neutral coverage along with Landorus-T's Ground-type STAB move. U-turn allows Landorus-T to switch out of a bad situation while maintaining momentum.

Because of its ability and impressive coverage, Landorus-T forces a lot of switches. Knock Off is great for punishing predicted switch-ins and ridding them of their item. Another option when predicting a switch is to use Rock Polish or Swords Dance should Landorus-T be running one of them, putting it in a better position to sweep. Landorus-T can also set up if you know that it can survive an incoming hit. Be careful when using Dragon Ascent, as even though it's powerful, the Defense and Special Defense drops make Landorus-T easily revenge killed. U-turn can be used when you know that Landorus-T outspeeds the foe to get chip damage and then switch to a teammate that can take the hit better. Even though Landorus-T has U-turn, don't be afraid to manually switch it out of battle. Landorus-T is susceptible to being revenge killed by Kyurem-B, Cloyster, and many fast Water-types, so don't let it take a hit from them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Stoutland, Ursaring, and Snorlax appreciate having Landorus-T eliminate the Rock- and Steel-types that stand in their way. Landorus-T also works well with Electric- and Rock-types such as Rotom-W, Raikou, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie, as they can help combat each other's weaknesses. They can eliminate the Ice- and Water-types that Landorus-T doesn't like, and in return, Landorus-T can switch into the Ground-type moves that they can't survive. Rotom-W has the added benefit of being able to take out opposing Landorus-T. Landorus-T appreciates entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Terrakion, and Heatran to help wear down foes and sometimes bring them into OHKO range. Landorus-T appreciates specially defensive walls such as Chansey, Porygon2, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar so that it can use U-turn and switch into them to take the special hits it may not be able to withstand.</p>"

  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<p>Keldeo is an outstanding offensive pokemon in STABmons, acting as one of the best revenge killers and wallbreakers in the metagame. Water / Fighting is an amazing STAB combination that gives Keldeo great neutral coverage and, combined with its high Special Attack stat, makes Keldeo a very credible offensive threat. It is able to 2HKO most of the metagame with powerful moves such as Water Spout, Steam Eruption, and Secret Sword. Steam Eruption brings great utility to the table, inflicting burns that cripple physical attackers and wear down walls rather quickly. Keldeo also possesses rather decent bulk with a good defensive typing that lets it check threatening Pokemon such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, Heatran, and Weavile, giving it nice defensive utility on offensive teams. Keldeo is also very versatile when it comes to its movesets, as it can act as a powerful wallbreaker with Choice Specs, an outstanding revenge killer with Choice Scarf, or a great sweeper with Calm Mind, allowing it to be quite unpredictable.</p> <p>Although Keldeo has a high Speed stat, it is still outsped and easily revenge killed by threats such as Latios, Thundurus, and Serperior. It also does not really have great coverage outside of its STAB moves, leaving it easily checked by Pokemon that resist its STAB combination. Despite these flaws, Keldeo remains an offensive powerhouse that can wear down the opposing team with its powerful moves and great offensive stats, making it a threat that should always be prepared for.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Calm Mind set with three attacks gives Keldeo an extra coverage move such as Icy Wind or Hidden Power Bug to power through Pokemon that would otherwise be counters to it, such as Celebi and Latios. Vacuum Wave also goes well in the third attack slot, outprioritizing faster threats such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Scarf Magnezone. However, Keldeo can easily be revenge killed due to the absence of Substitute. Taunt is another great move to shut down walls that rely on status moves to wear down the opposing Pokemon, increasing Keldeo's wallbreaking capabilities, but running Taunt amplifies Keldeo's four-moveslot syndrome. Keldeo can also run an effective Substitute set with Leftovers, and it can forego Calm Mind for a coverage move such as Icy Wind or Hidden Power Bug to better deal with its checks and counters. However, Keldeo does miss out on a lot of KOs without Life Orb, Choice Specs, or Calm Mind boosts. A RestTalk set in conjunction with two STAB moves allows Keldeo to have great longevity throughout the entire match due to Rest and still be threatening while asleep thanks to Sleep Talk. This set can greatly counter many Dark-type Pokemon such as Weavile and Tyranitar, and it allows Keldeo to break through Pokemon that rely on Toxic damage to wear down their foes. However, this set lacks power due to its reliance on Leftovers over an offensive item, which hampers its wallbreaking capabilities. Keldeo can also run Expert Belt, Splash Plate, or Fist Plate to forgo Life Orb recoil and Choice Specs restrictions, and these are great items to bluff which exact set it is running, although due to Keldeo's limited coverage, these items may be not utilized to their fullest capabilities. Aura Sphere and Focus Blast are other Fighting-type STAB options that Keldeo can run that have higher damage outputs than Secret Sword; however, these moves are generally never seen, as Secret Sword has the ability to take into account the target's Defense stat instead of Special Defense. Focus Blast is particularly unreliable due to its low accuracy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-types such as Mega Slowbro, Latias, and Celebi are able to take any STAB move from Keldeo and threaten to KO it in return. This can be mitigated, however, if you decide to run Hidden Power Bug, but it still does not guarantee even a 2HKO on some of them. Pursuit trappers can also help with this issue, as they can usually weaken these Pokemon immensely before Keldeo confronts them again.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-type Pokemon such as Azumarill, Mega Blastoise, Manaphy, and Gyarados can easily come in on any of Keldeo's Water-type attacks and threaten Keldeo with their respective coverage options. Running Hidden Power Electric can relieve this issue minimally, but having Grass-type Pokemon such as Serperior and Celebi to deal with them is usually the best way to counter these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Togekiss, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Diancie, and Sylveon resist Fighting-type moves and can threaten to KO Keldeo with their STAB attacks. Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir in particular can both deal with Calm Mind Keldeo due to their respective sound-based attacks, which bypass Substitute. Steel-type Pokemon such as Scizor and Ferrothorn are great options to deal with these threats.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus-T and Dragonite are both bulky enough to survive both of Keldeo's STAB options and can threaten to KO it with their respective Flying-type moves. However, they need to be wary if Keldeo decides to run Icy Wind, which can lower their Speed and allows Keldeo to KO them.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Serperior can deal with Keldeo quite easily, due to their resisting Water-type attacks and Mega Venusaur's resisting Fighting-type attacks as well. Flying-type Pokemon like Thundurus and Landorus-T are both great teammates that threaten Grass-types in general.</p> <p><strong>Fast Electric-types</strong>: Fast Electric-types such as Thundurus, Raikou, and Mega Manectric can threaten to KO Keldeo if it lacks Vacuum Wave. Thundurus is especially threatening, as it resists Fighting-type moves and can deal with Choice Scarf Keldeo with priority Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Keldeo does not appreciate priority users such as Talonflame, Mega Lopunny, and Ursaring, as they can severely weaken it, decreasing the power of its Water Spout.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Water Spout is a devastatingly strong STAB move that allows Keldeo to break down many teams, especially in conjunction with Choice Specs. Origin Pulse is another powerful STAB move, that lets Keldeo 2HKO most threats with ease without needing to worry about its HP. Secret Sword is Keldeo's secondary STAB move and lets it hit specially defensive walls such as Chansey and Ferrothorn for more damage. Steam Eruption is Keldeo's secondary Water-type STAB move of choice, and its high accuracy helps  Keldeo to secure the KO on weakened Pokemon. Steam Eruption is also able to cripple physical attackers and chip many switch-ins with its high chance of inflicting burns. Vacuum Wave is a great STAB priority option that allows Keldeo to hit faster threats such as Excadrill under sand and Choice Scarf Magnezone and helps Keldeo against Speed ties with Terrakion. Finally, Icy Wind is a nice coverage option that lets Keldeo hit Grass-types and Dragon-types such as Serperior and Dragonite. Hidden Power Bug can be used to hit Psychic-types such as Celebi and Starmie. Scald can also be used over Steam Eruption, as its higher PP helps Keldeo to break down bulkier teams. However, Steam Eruption's greater Base Power makes it the preferred option.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Specs boosts Keldeo's damage output to incredible levels, making it able to 2HKO most of the metagame. Life Orb can also be run to allow Keldeo to switch moves, but the damage loss compared to Choice Specs is quite noticeable and the recoil can wear it down quickly. Additionally, Water Spout should never be used alongside Life Orb. The EVs are maxed out in Special Attack and Speed to increase Keldeo's offensive capabilities. A Timid nature is chosen to let Keldeo outspeed threats such as Mega Charizard X and Kyurem-B, allowing it to remain a threat to offensive teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keldeo is a reliable wallbreaker, dismantling many powerful cores thanks to its powerful moves and high Special Attack. Keldeo can switch into resisted hits with ease due to its moderate bulk, but it should never be switched in on any attacks if you choose to run Water Spout. Keldeo is best utilized throughout the end of the match, as it can sweep through weakened teams once its checks and counters are gone. However, it can be used earlier on to break through defensive walls, allowing your other team members to sweep more easily. Try to eliminate faster threats such as Thundurus and Serperior that could potentially harm Keldeo before you try to sweep with it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Latios is a near-perfect partner for Keldeo, as it can deal with Keldeo's checks and counters such as Mega Venausaur, Slowbro, and Latias. Keldeo also deals with common Pursuit trappers like Weavile and Hoopa-U, while Latios can remove entry hazards and heal Keldeo with Healing Wish in return, allowing it to spam Water Spout more often. Bulky Grass- and Water-types such as Mega Venausaur and Gyarados can wall Keldeo extremely well, so it is recommended to run Pokemon that can beat them alongside Keldeo, such as Kyurem-B, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y. Tornadus-T is another great partner for Keldeo, as its Flying typing in conjunction with its amazing ability to pivot greatly helps Keldeo fend off Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Celebi. Pursuit trappers such as Weavile and Tyranitar also work well with Keldeo, as they can trap Psychic-types such as Latios, Celebi, and Slowbro that can take one hit from Keldeo and potentially KO it. Heatran is another great Pokemon that works well with Keldeo, as it can deal with Keldeo's checks and counters such as Latias, Talonflame, and Mega Venusaur quite well. Heatran's typing also provides resistances to types such as Grass, Flying, and Psychic that Keldeo is weak to. This set can usually be run on more offensively oriented teams due to its capability of breaking down many defensive cores, that many offensive teams have a difficult time with.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Water Spout is a powerful move that is able to 2HKO almost the entire tier at its highest damage output, and it is a very good move with which to revenge kill weakened threats. Secret Sword is Keldeo's main Fighting-type STAB move, being able to hit specially defensive walls like Chansey and Tyranitar much harder than Keldeo's special moves. Steam Eruption is Keldeo's second STAB Water-type move and can inflict burns, which weaken walls and cripple physical attackers. Icy Wind is a decent coverage option that allows Keldeo to hit Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Serperior and Dragonite super effectively, and it is a nice tool to lower the foe's Speed as well. Hidden Power Electric is another coverage option that lets Keldeo hit Water-type Pokemon such as Gyarados, Slowbro, Starmie, and Azumarill. Finally, Hidden Power Bug is a nice option that is not seen quite often and allows Keldeo to hit bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, Latias, and Celebi super effectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf enables Keldeo to outspeed faster Pokemon such as Alakazam, Serperior, and Mega Diancie that would otherwise threaten to KO it, allowing it to revenge kill them more easily. The EVs are maxed out in Special Attack and Speed to strengthen Keldeo's offensive capabilities, while a Timid nature is chosen to outspeed as many threats as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Latios synergizes really well with Keldeo, as it can remove entry hazards and heal Keldeo with Healing Wish, allowing it to wallbreak more often with Water Spout. They can deal with each other's checks and counters, as Keldeo can take on Dark-type Pokemon while Latios deals with Psychic- and Grass-type Pokemon. Tornadus-T is another great partner for Keldeo, as its Flying typing combined with the ability to safely pivot with U-turn allows it to switch into Keldeo's checks and counters, such as Mega Venusaur and Starmie, multiple times thanks to Regenerator. Keldeo should be used on more offensive teams, as it can act as a useful check to most of the Pokemon that can threaten this playstyle, such as Terrakion and Gengar, although it can be run on balanced teams that need a check to opposing offensive teams. Depending on what it runs, Keldeo can be walled by Grass- and Dragon-types, so it prefers to be paired with Pokemon that can deal with them. For instance, Landorus-T and Kyurem-B are nice options due to their amazing offensive typings that have great synergy with Keldeo's typing. Psychic-types are also a pain for Keldeo to deal with, so running Dark-type Pokemon with Pursuit such as Tyranitar and Weavile is highly recommended, as they let Keldeo have an easier time wallbreaking. Grass-types like Serperior and Ferrothorn pair well with Keldeo as well, as they can deal with bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Azumarill. Entry hazard removal is also useful, as hazards can weaken Keldeo quite quickly, which can decrease its offensive capabilities because it switches in and out quite often. Healing Wish support can also be essential from Pokemon such as Latias, Latios, and Jirachi, as it restores Keldeo's HP and allows Water Spout to deal more damage.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute works well with Calm Mind, as it secures Keldeo against attacks that have the potential to KO it and lets it set up much more easily. It also blocks crippling status conditions from Thunder Wave and Toxic, safeguards Keldeo from the popular Fake Out + Extreme Speed combination, and prevents Chansey from using Transform successfully. Calm Mind boosts Keldeo's wallbreaking capabilities to terrifying levels. It also gives Keldeo surprising amounts of special bulk, letting it survive powerful attacks from strong Pokemon after a couple of boosts. Scald is itsKeldeo's Water-type STAB move of choice, as it possesses a high chance to burn the target, which works well in conjunction with the Special Defense boosts from Calm Mind. Steam Eruption is not used on this set because its low PP does not mesh well with this set's focus on longevity and reliability. Secret Sword is the Fighting-type STAB move, letting Keldeo hit specially defensive walls and opposing Calm Mind users.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers is the best item to be used on this set, as it can passively recover HP that can be used to create Substitutes, and it also increases Keldeo's longevity. However, a Salac Berry can also be used to boost Keldeo's Speed, which, in conjunction with Calm Mind boosts, can be extremely devastating, though it allows Keldeo to be easily revenge killed by priority users such as Talonflame and Mega Lopunny. The EVs are maxed out in Special Attack and Speed to maximize Keldeo's sweeping capabilities, and Timid is the chosen nature to let Keldeo outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, such as Kyurem-B and Mega Charizard X.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keldeo should only start setting up once its checks and counters are gone or extremely weakened, as it doesn't have any coverage moves to hit them. Keldeo can also be threatened by sound-based moves such as Sylveon's Boomburst and Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice, which can bypass Substitutes and OHKO Keldeo. Try to not let Keldeo be weakened too much, as it needs quite a bit of HP to create Substitutes and set up Calm Minds. This set can force many physical attackers out with the threat of Scald. It is also not threatened by passive Pokemon such as Chansey, Mega Sableye, and Klefki because Keldeo can set up on them. All these reasons combined allow Keldeo to easily find an opportunity to set up a Substitute and commence sweeping. However, Keldeo should not try to start setting up if the opposing team has a phazer or a priority user that can end Keldeo's sweep quite abruptly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Latios is a great option in conjunction with this set, as it checks many Pokemon that wall Keldeo such as Mega Venusaur, Celebi, Latias, and Slowbro, and it can also keep entry hazards off the field, giving Keldeo an easier time sweeping later on during the match. Flying-type Pokemon such as Thundurus and Landorus-T are also great partners for Keldeo, as they can deal with Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Celebi that completely wall Keldeo. Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Weavile are also good teammates that can Pursuit trap bulky Psychic-types that can wall Keldeo such as Latias and Slowbro. Hoopa-U is another Dark-type Pokemon that can break through bulky Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro and Meloetta easily. Assault Vest Metagross is also another Pursuit user that can be considered, as its great bulk allows it to Pursuit trap key threats such as Latios and Latias, while it is also able to deal with other threats such as Mega Diancie and Mega Venusaur. Fairy-type Pokemon such as Clefable and Klefki are also very useful, as they can deal with Dragon-types like Dragonite and Latias, which can both take Keldeo's STAB moves and threaten to KO it. A physical Thundurus set is another great team option that can break through bulky Water-types such as Gyarados, Mega Blastoise, and Azumarill quite easily, remedying Keldeo's lack of coverage for these Pokemon. This set can be used on more balanced teams, as it is one of the best stallbreakers in the metagame; however, it can be run on bulky offense teams as well. Entry hazard setters such as Heatran and Ferrothorn are recommended, as the entry hazards can weaken some of Keldeo's checks and counters, thus allowing it to sweep more easily and efficiently. Toxic Spikes setters such as Gengar and Scolipede are especially valued because Toxic Spikes can wear down bulky Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro and Porygon2, as Keldeo tends to stall behind Substitutes.</p>"

  "Meloetta": {
    "overview": "<p>As one of the most versatile Pokemon in STABmons, Meloetta can fill a variety of roles. It has the potential to be a deadly setup sweeper, a powerful wallbreaker, or an excellent special tank. As such, it can fit into many team archetypes, such as balance and offense. Meloetta's unique typing provides an immunity to Ghost and only two weaknesses, which benefits Meloetta's longevity. Offensively, Meloetta gains a very spammable move in Boomburst. This is aided by Meloetta's solid Special Attack, which allows it to be one of the best special attackers in the metagame. In addition, Meloetta also has very good special bulk, allowing it to tank powerful hits. Unfortunately, Meloetta is held back by its poor Speed combined with its nearly useless ability. It also has an underlying vulnerability to Pursuit trapping and the more common Knock Off. Lastly, Meloetta doesn't have a very good STAB combination, so it often relies on coverage moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Meloetta can run a fully defensive set with Recover and Glare, which can be fairly useful. Calm Mind can be used, but such a set can be rather ineffective because it is generally outclassed by other special attackers such as Clefable. Alternatively, running Judgment and either Flame Plate, Fist Plate, or Earth Plate on the wallbreaker and sweeper sets is an option, as they offer more reliable and powerful coverage; however, using the item slot on the Plate can be disappointing, as it doesn't boost any other moves. Other coverage options such as Energy Ball, Shadow Ball, and Thunderbolt are all relatively viable and can remove threats such as Suicune, Jirachi, and Skarmory, although they don't cover anything notable and are very team specific. Meloetta can use a set with Wish, Protect, Baton Pass, and Hyper Voice or Psyshock, but this is usually unadvised due to other Pokemon outclassing it in this department such as Chansey. Using Meloetta-P is another option, as Meloetta has higher Speed in its Pirouette forme and can take advantage of Extreme Speed. Meloetta-P isn't that viable, though, as it has to spend a turn using Relic Song to transform and has to do it again if it ends up switching out, in addition to Relic Song wasting a moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Sableye</strong>: Due to its Dark / Ghost typing, Sableye is immune to both of Meloetta's STAB types. It is also immune to Meloetta's most common coverage option, Focus Blast. If Meloetta opts not to run Dazzling Gleam, Sableye walls it. If that isn't enough, Sableye can end Meloetta's sweep with Topsy-Turvy and turn it into setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Dark-types and Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Meloetta has mediocre physical bulk, and any physical Dark Pokemon such as Weavile or Tyranitar gives it a lot of trouble, especially if running Pursuit, which many Dark-types run in STABmons. Moreover, Bisharp resists or is immune to both of Meloetta's STAB types and always runs Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types such as Scizor and Jirachi resist both of Meloetta's STAB types and don't care much about Focus Blast. Unless Meloetta is running Fire coverage, they will force it out.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Meloetta is very vulnerable to being revenge killed by the likes of Stoutland and Weavile due to its mediocre Speed and lack of priority moves.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Boomburst is an incredibly spammable STAB move, with 140 Base Power, 100% accuracy, and no downsides whatsoever. Psystrike is another very powerful STAB move, and it hits specially defensive walls such as Chansey on their physical Defense rather than Special Defense. Focus Blast hits would-be safe switch-ins such as Heatran and Tyranitar hard. Dazzling Gleam is mainly used to hit Sableye, which otherwise walls Meloetta. U-turn is a great move to maintain momentum on predicted switches. Hidden Power Ice is a usable option to hit certain bulky Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Scizor in particular, as well as provide a more reliable attack for Ferrothorn. Trick is worth noting as well, as it can be used with Choice Specs to cripple walls such as Chansey and Porygon2.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs are set to maximize Meloetta's power and bulk, with enough Speed EVs invested to outspeed fully invested Tyranitar. Choice Specs is the ideal option to make Meloetta hit as hard as possible while not whittling down its HP, as Meloetta has no form of recovery. Life Orb is another viable option, that boosts the power of all of Meloetta's moves without locking it into a move. Meloetta uses a Modest nature for maximum power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Meloetta should be used to break down defensive cores because of its overwhelming wallbreaking potential. When in doubt, spam Boomburst, as no Pokemon wants to take a neutral Boomburst. Make sure to not switch Meloetta into physical attacks and especially a potential Knock Off, as Meloetta's physical bulk is rather poor and it is a very item-reliant Pokemon. In general, be careful bringing Meloetta out if the opponent has Tyranitar or Weavile, as they can Pursuit trap it, potentially KOing it. Following that, if Meloetta has Choice Specs, try to avoid using Psystrike until Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Weavile have been KOed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Meloetta functions very well on teams that have trouble dealing with defensive cores, because it dismantles bulky builds. Setup sweepers such as Porygon-Z and Scizor appreciate Meloetta's ability to beat most walls, including Unaware Clefable and Quagsire. Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Talonflame can beat the Steel-types that Meloetta can have trouble with, particularly Jirachi and Bug/Steel-type Pokemon (most notably Scizor and Forretress). Entry hazard setters make it even harder to switch in on Meloetta. As Meloetta is vulnerable to Dark-type moves, especially Knock Off, Pokemon that resist Dark and, specifically, Knock Off absorbers are good team options as well. Some good examples are Whimsicott and Terrakion.</p>"
      },
      "Special Tank": {
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Boomburst is a very powerful and spammable STAB move. Psystrike is another very powerful STAB move that hits special tanks, most notably Chansey. Focus Blast hits Steel-types, which otherwise stop Meloetta, although its poor accuracy makes it unreliable. Rapid Spin is an option for teams that need entry hazard control. U-turn is used to maintain momentum on predicted switches. Dazzling Gleam can be used to hit Sableye, which otherwise walls Meloetta, but it isn't as important on this set because Meloetta isn't trying to break walls and it can just U-turn out.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Meloetta has excellent natural bulk, and Assault Vest allows it to switch into many special attackers such as Gengar and Mega Manectric. Enough Speed is invested to outspeed fully invested Tyranitar, while full Special Attack investment and a Modest nature maximizes Meloetta's damage output. The remaining EVs are put into HP for maximum bulk. Boomburst can still hit hard without a boosting item thanks to its high Base Power. Alternatively, you can opt for 252 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature if you desire bulk over attack power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Meloetta has insanely good special bulk and can switch into just about any special attack bar Dark-type attacks comfortably. When in doubt, spam Boomburst because it will hit just about anything hard bar Pokemon that resist it; even when uninvested, it will 2HKO a large majority of threats. However, Sableye will nearly always switch into Meloetta, so don't be afraid to click Dazzling Gleam if Meloetta is running it and Sableye is still healthy. Rapid Spin is easy to use assuming the opponent doesn't have Sableye, as people won't be expecting it. It's important to keep entry hazards off the field when using Assault Vest Meloetta because of how prone it is to getting worn down coupled with Meloetta's lack of recovery. If you predict your opponent will switch Pokemon but aren't sure what they'll send in, U-turn is a great option. A slow U-turn allows Meloetta to absorb the hit if the foe attacks and allows you to send in whatever puts you in the best position.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Physical tanks such as Ferrothorn can absorb physical hits, while Meloetta can take special ones in return. Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp such as Sableye also help Meloetta by crippling physical attackers. Entry hazard removers such as Excadrill and Latias are good options because Meloetta is very prone to getting worn down and entry hazards expedite the process. Mega Charizard Y can deal with Steel-types, which otherwise annoy Meloetta, while Meloetta can remove Stealth Rock in return. Knock Off absorbers such as Terrakion are good partners due to Meloetta's weakness to the move. Wish passers such as Chansey and Clefable help preserve Meloetta's longevity, letting it continue walling threats.</p>"

  "Klefki": {
    "overview": "<p>Klefki's excellent typing allows it to check a myriad of top-tier threats such as Kyurem-B, Hoopa-U, Weavile, and Latios. While Klefki forces these Pokemon out, it is able to reliably set up Spikes for offensive teams. Thunder Wave is one of Klefki's biggest assets, as many offensive teams love having a priority Thunder Wave user to cripple fast threats such as Weavile, Serperior, and boosted Mega Scizor, which otherwise threaten to sweep after setting up. Klefki is very unpredictable as well, as it can pick from two coverage moves to limit its counters, and it has the ability to run wonderful utility moves such as Magnet Rise, Moonlight, and King's Shield. Prankster is one of the best abilities in the game, and Klefki has the perfect movepool to utilize it. However, although Thunder Wave is a great move, many Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Diggersby, are immune to it, thus leaving Klefki as setup fodder for these Pokemon. Klefki is also very weak to Ground-type moves, and although this can be mitigated with Magnet Rise, it takes a turn to use, and Klefki is unable to switch into Ground-types otherwise. Klefki has a large movepool, but it often can't accomplish everything it wants to due to its inability to fit everything it wants into one set. Finally, Klefki has absolutely no offensive presence, which leaves it unable to threaten setup sweepers immune to Thunder Wave.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic is a viable option to whittle down Mega Slowbro, which would otherwise wall Klefki entirely and use it as setup bait. Toxic wears a lot of defensive Pokemon down in general, but using it over Thunder Wave is really risky and gives up a key point to Klefki's success. Iron Head can be used over Flash Cannon to make the foe flinch, which can prove very annoying in combination with Thunder Wave, but it's really weak because of the majority of the metagame favoring Defense over Special Defense. An example of this is Landorus-T making Iron Head weaker through Intimidate. Charm acts as a Will-O-Wisp of sorts, but it's hard to fit into most of Klefki's sets. Fairy Lock is an interesting option to use alongside a setup sweeper to prevent a switch the turn after Klefki is KOed. Dual screens with Thunder Wave could potentially be pulled off, but STABmons is too offensive for the set to be used consistently. Moreover, even when it is put up, Fake Out is so common that these increased defenses don't last as long as one would like them to.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as both Mega Charizard formes and Heatran OHKO Klefki with Blue Flare and resist Klefki's attacking moves. Rotom-H cannot OHKO Klefki, but it is immune to Spikes and Thunder Wave and doesn't care about Klefki's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Even with Magnet Rise, Klefki can't do much to Ground-types. Without Magnet Rise, Klefki is forced out by most Ground-types. Specifically, Excadrill and Gliscor don't care about Klefki's attacks at all, and Excadrill can even threaten Klefki with Meteor Mash when Magnet Rise is set. Landorus-T and Hippowdon cannot hit Klefki during Magnet Rise, but Klefki also cannot do anything to them in return.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users</strong>: Mega Sableye takes heavy damage from Moonblast, and Mega Diancie is OHKOed by Flash Cannon, but both of them can switch on any other move and make Klefki regret using its own moves. Moreover, Klefki will always be countered by one or the other because it cannot run both Moonblast and Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Powerful attacks from Pokemon like Terrakion, Keldeo, and Mega Scizor spell doom for Klefki because it doesn't have the overall bulk to take these attacks. However, all of these Pokemon have to worry about being paralyzed with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Mega Slowbro and Suicune in particular hard counter Klefki. Thunder Wave doesn't bother either of them, and they're both able to use Klefki as setup fodder. Additionally, none of Klefki's attacks are threatening enough to either of these Pokemon. However, they have to be careful of the uncommon Toxic, which catches them off guard and heavily cripples them.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Unless Klefki carries Shed Shell, Magnezone is able to trap Klefki and whittle it down with Thunderbolt. In return, Klefki is left with nothing else to do but set up Spikes until it is eventually KOed. None of Klefki's attacks threaten Magnezone, so it's a relatively safe way to prevent Klefki from doing much.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spikes is Klefki's greatest asset and is a great form of support for its team because it chips away at the foe's health. Thunder Wave is also very important because it cripples faster Pokemon to help Klefki's slower teammates. The third slot is very team dependent. Magnet Rise is particularly useful to avoid Ground-type attacks from Landorus-T, which would otherwise hit Klefki for super effective damage. Meanwhile, Moonlight provides Klefki with a form of recovery outside of Leftovers, which allows Klefki to repeatedly set up Spikes and spread Thunder Wave throughout a match. King's Shield is a nice way to scare away physical attackers such as Terrakion. Flash Cannon is really useful to hit Mega Diancie, which can otherwise come in on any move Klefki throws out thanks to Magic Bounce and beat it. However, Moonblast holds merit for being able to hit Mega Sableye for the same reason, though it requires Special Attack investment to actually overwhelm Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers is Klefki's only form of recovery bar Moonlight, and the two in combination make Klefki hard to take down. If Moonlight is being run, however, Klefki can run Rocky Helmet to punish and wear down physical attackers. Shed Shell is another viable option to be able to switch out of Magnezone's Magnet Pull; however, if the opponent does not have Magnezone, Klefki has effectively wasted its item slot. Maximum Special Defense investment is preferred over full Defense investment to take on Thundurus, Gengar, and Keldeo a lot better than Klefki would with a physically defensive spread. However, if these threats are covered and your team desperately needs a physical wall, Klefki can run a spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature. Prankster is Klefki's only viable ability, granting it priority on its status moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Klefki should never directly switch into a Ground-type attack; instead, it should be brought in with pivoting and then catch the foe off guard with Magnet Rise. Spikes is best used on predicted switches, but it shouldn't be used in many other situations because it can leave Klefki vulnerable. Thunder Wave should be used often, as there really isn't much of a drawback to using it, and Ground-types can be caught off guard with Magnet Rise if they do potentially come in. Because Klefki's bulk is somewhat average, it should avoid switching directly into powerful attacks; it just can't take the hits. However, resisted attacks are easy to switch into because of Klefki's numerous resistances. Save Klefki for late in the match to cripple a setup sweeper that could potentially break through your team. Sacrificing Klefki in these situations is the way to go, as you're losing one Pokemon as opposed to your entire team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Flying-types such as Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Thundurus all appreciate the Spikes support that Klefki provides to enable them to wear down the opposing team quicker, and they share good type synergy with Klefki. Pokemon that can prevent Rapid Spin or Defog from being used, such as Gengar and Bisharp, are great partners for Klefki; these two Pokemon in particular thrive off of the Spikes that Klefki can set to break down the opposing team. A lure set on Thundurus that utilizes Defiant could also be used to catch the foe off guard. However, Gengar can't block Scrappy Rapid Spin, so simple Fighting-type partners such as Terrakion are good to pressure the opponent's spinner and prevent them from having an opportunity to use the move. Slower offensive Pokemon, such as Azumarill, Choice Specs Heatran, and Mega Charizard Y, are great partners because they appreciate Thunder Wave slowing the opposing team down. In general, powerful offensive Pokemon like Weavile and Hoopa-U can really put in work against the opposing team, as Spikes wears foes down. Setup sweepers, namely Shift Gear Mega Scizor, can simply stomp opposing teams once they've been worn down by Spikes.</p>"

  "Hoopa-Unbound": {
    "overview": "<p>Hoopa-U is one of the most fearsome wallbreakers of the STABmons metagame. Its ridiculous offensive stats and powerful STAB attacks allow it to 2HKO almost every relevant Pokemon. It also has access to an extremely powerful Sucker Punch, which allows it to revenge kill a plethora of offensive threats. Its high Special Defense stat lets it tank powerful hits from attackers such as Latios, Thundurus, and Gengar, and its access to Pursuit allows it to remove these Pokemon for the rest of the match. However, Hoopa-U is held back by its awful Defense stat, which renders it highly vulnerable to priority moves, including the common Fake Out + Extreme Speed. Its Speed stat is also fairly mediocre, making it overly dependent on Sucker Punch to threaten faster Pokemon. Finally, it suffers from a bad defensive typing that gives it little opportunities to switch in and leaves it weak to common attacking types in Fairy and Bug.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute can be used to take advantage of the many switches that Hoopa-U forces; however, running Leftovers over Life Orb then becomes a requirement to preserve Hoopa-U's longevity, and this cuts into its power notably. Taunt can be used to prevent bulky Pokemon from recovering, using status moves, or setting up entry hazards, but it limits Hoopa-U's coverage. Hidden Power Ice reliably OHKOes Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, something that the Choice Scarf set struggles to do otherwise. Memento can be used over Lunar Dance to grant a teammate setup opportunities, but reviving a weakened setup sweeper is often more useful. Parting Shot can be used on the wallbreaker sets, as Hoopa-U's Speed stat is low enough to bring in its teammates safely; however, Hoopa-U has to give up valuable coverage to run it. Night Daze can be used over Dark Pulse on all sets. It hits slightly harder and can drop the foe's accuracy, but Dark Pulse's higher reliability and helpful flinch chance are generally preferred. A specially-oriented Choice Scarf set can be used, but it is generally worse than the regular Choice Scarf set because it is weaker and has inferior coverage. Assault Vest gives up the power of Life Orb, but it allows Hoopa-U to have an easier time Pursuit trapping special attackers such as Latios, Thundurus, and Gengar.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Hoopa-U is easily revenge killed by all physical priority attacks because of its terrible Defense stat. In particular, Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Mega Lopunny and Ursaring and Sucker Punch users such as Bisharp, Weavile, and Tyranitar have an easy time because of their high Base Power attacks. Other priority users to watch out for include Water Shuriken Azumarill, Mach Punch Terrakion, and Bullet Punch Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Bisharp, Weavile, and Tyranitar can Pursuit trap Hoopa-U, especially when it is locked into one of its STAB moves, and they can also threaten faster variants of Hoopa-U with Sucker Punch. Mega Sableye can tank one of Hoopa-U's Dark-types STAB attacks and threaten it with Knock Off or Foul Play. Mandibuzz avoids the 2HKO from all attacks except for Life Orb-boosted Gunk Shot and Focus Blast, both of which have unreliable accuracy. It can then threaten Hoopa-U with Knock Off or Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Fast Physical Attackers</strong>: Fast physical attackers such as Aerodactyl, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T can easily revenge kill Hoopa-U. Mega Beedrill is especially notable for its ability to outspeed and revenge kill Choice Scarf Hoopa-U. However, many of these Pokemon can be picked off by Sucker Punch once they are at low health.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fast Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir can outspeed and OHKO non-Choice Scarf Hoopa-U. Azumarill and Clefable fear Gunk Shot but can tank a STAB attack and KO Hoopa-U in return. Klefki can capably switch into any attack except for Fire Punch and proceed to cripple Hoopa-U with Thunder Wave or KO it with Moonblast.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyperspace Fury is Hoopa-U's primary STAB attack. It doesn't make contact, allowing Hoopa-U to avoid damage from Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and Rough Skin; it also breaks through protection moves such as King's Shield. Sucker Punch is a very strong priority move that picks off naturally faster attackers such as Thundurus, Latios, and Aerodactyl, as well as Choice Scarf users such as Magnezone and Heatran. Drain Punch provides excellent coverage by hitting Dark-types such as Bisharp and Tyranitar, as well as allowing Hoopa-U to recover a small amount of health. Gunk Shot allows Hoopa-U to threaten Fairy-types such as Clefable and Togekiss as well as hit Mandibuzz for decent damage. Alternatively, Psycho Boost destroys physical walls such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W. Fire Punch can be used in the last slot to hit Klefki and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs make Hoopa-U as fast and strong as possible. 29 HP IVs are used to minimize Life Orb recoil. A Jolly nature allows Hoopa-U to Speed tie with other base 80 Speed Pokemon as well as outspeed Timid Heatran. An Adamant nature is generally unncecessary, as Hoopa-U's Attack is already very strong. 4 Special Attack EVs and a Hasty nature should be used with Psycho Boost. Life Orb boosts Hoopa-U's power and allows it to switch moves, giving it the possibility to use Sucker Punch effectively.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hoopa-U should be brought in safely with the use of a pivoting move or after a teammate has fainted, as it is exceptionally physically frail. However, it can switch directly into some special attackers such as Thundurus and Gengar if it does not need to be kept healthy. Hoopa-U should use its powerful STAB attacks early- or mid-game to break down opposing walls, but it can also revenge kill effectively with its powerful Sucker Punch; however, it is important to be wary of the foe taking advantage of this to set up a Substitute or switch out. Don't recklessly spam Hoopa-U's STAB moves against teams with a Pursuit trapper, as they can easily remove it for the rest of the match. Hoopa-U also needs to switch out of priority moves such as the common Fake Out + Extreme Speed, as it cannot tank these attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazards from setters such as Spikes Garchomp and Stealth Rock Terrakion wear down opposing teams and limit the number of Pokemon that can check Hoopa-U. Steel-types such as Klefki and Skarmory handle opposing Fairy-types, and these two can also set up Spikes. Sticky Web support from Bug-types such as Mega Scizor and Forretress allows Hoopa-U to outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny and Keldeo take advantage of the Pursuit trappers that Hoopa-U hates. Special attackers that struggle to break through common walls, such as Tornadus-T, appreciate Hoopa-U's wallbreaking ability. Reliable and powerful setup sweepers such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Scizor enjoy Hoopa-U's ability to break through the walls that they cannot, and in return, they perform well against fast offensive teams. Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot users such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Sableye give Hoopa-U opportunities to switch in. These Pokemon can also deal with physical attackers, especially Fake Out + Extreme Speed users, that threaten Hoopa-U.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dark Pulse hits physically defensive walls such as Landorus-T, Skarmory, and Mega Slowbro. Psystrike hits specially defensive walls such as Chansey, deals heavy damage to Fairy-types, and hits Mega Venusaur hard. Focus Blast rounds out Hoopa-U's coverage by hitting Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Bisharp and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn extremely hard. Psycho Boost improves Hoopa-U's matchup against bulkyier teams, as it OHKOes physical walls such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W. Alternatively, Sucker Punch allows Hoopa-U to revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Latios and Jirachi. Running Nasty Plot in the last slot allows Hoopa-U to run over bulky teams, but it generally prefers the ability to OHKO walls without a boost or revenge kill faster Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature make Hoopa-U as fast as possible so that it can outspeed threats such as Timid Heatran. Maximum Special Attack EVs increase Hoopa-U's power. If Sucker Punch is used, Hoopa-U should use an EV spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Hasty nature. Life Orb boosts Hoopa-U's power without locking it into one move. 29 HP IVs minimize Life Orb recoil.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hoopa-U should be used to break down walls early- or mid-game. Bring it in with the use of a pivoting move, after a teammate has fainted, or into special attackers such as Thundurus and Latias. However, it cannot switch into any physical attacks, as it is very physically frail. Make use of the unexpected nature of this set, as opponents usually expect a physically-oriented set. Be careful around opposing Dark-types, as they can switch in on a Dark- or Psychic-type attack and proceed to threaten Hoopa-U with Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Furthermore, Hoopa-U is easily taken advantage of once Psycho Boost has dropped its Special Attack. Make use of Sucker Punch's surprise factor to KO opposing revenge killers.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set has an excellent matchup against defensive teams, so setup sweepers generally appreciate Hoopa-U's wallbreaking ability; in particular, physical sweepers such as Shift Gear Mega Scizor and Swords Dance Excadrill enjoy Skarmory, Rotom-W, and bulky Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon being KOed. Garchomp and Landorus-T handle priority users and can set up Stealth Rock to wear down Hoopa-U's switch-ins, especially Mandibuzz. Rotom-W and Sableye handle Fake Out + Extreme Speed users and give Hoopa-U opportunities to come in with Volt Switch and Parting Shot, respectively. Sticky Web users such as Mega Scizor are also capable of slowing down the opposing team, which gives Hoopa-U an enormous advantage. Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion appreciate Hoopa-U threatening Psychic-types and have a good matchup against the Dark-types that threaten Hoopa-U.</p>"

Drain Punch hits Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Bisharp and allows Hoopa-U to recover some health. Psychic allows Hoopa-U to revenge kill Pokemon that resist Dark such as Keldeo and Mega Diancie as well as 2HKO Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Gunk Shot can be used instead to hit Fairy-types, allowing Hoopa-U to revenge kill Mega Gardevoir with ease. Lunar Dance allows Hoopa-U to revive a weakened teammate. Pursuit traps threats that try to switch out of Hyperspace Fury such as Latios, Gengar, and Meloetta. Trick and Switcheroo give Hoopa-U the ability to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Ferrothorn, but Hoopa-U often prefers hitting them hard instead.
