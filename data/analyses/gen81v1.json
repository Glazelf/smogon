It may not reflect current usage of this Pokémon.</p> <p>Thanks to its excellent defensive typing and great defensive stats, Slowbro is a threatening stall Pokemon in the 1v1 metagame. Its ability Oblivious helps it function as an effective PP staller, blocking Taunt from Pokemon like Corviknight, Haxorus, and Whimsicott. Iron Defense allows Slowbro to deal with physical powerhouses in the tier such as Galarian Darmanitan, Crustle, and Dracovish. Calm Mind covers Slowbro's mediocre Special Defense, which is useful against Pokemon such as Primarina and Salazzle, while also boosting the damage of Stored Power to defeat opposing stall Pokemon like Snorlax and Galarian Corsola. Slack Off allows Slowbro to heal damage taken while boosting its defensive stats. Rest is another recovery option that allows Slowbro to defeat Pokemon that use Toxic such as Chansey, but Slack Off is generally preferred to make it far less passive. Stored Power provides Slowbro with offensive capabilities that benefit from its defensive boosts, dealing with Pokemon such as Urshifu-R, Arcanine, and Kommo-o. The given EV spread with a Bold nature and the help of a Sitrus Berry is optimal for dealing with physical attackers like Haxorus and Galarian Darmanitan.</p> <p>Slowbro's main gameplan is to tank hits while setting up to improve its defensive capabilities. As such, Slowbro's passiveness leaves it vulnerable to Encore and Trick users like Primarina, Aromatisse, and Gardevoir. Against stall Rotom-W, use Calm Mind turn one, as Thunderbolt will deal less than 75% HP, activating Slowbro's Sitrus Berry. Afterwards, use Slack Off until it is around 80% health, then keep using Calm Mind and healing until Slowbro is at +3 and OHKO with Stored Power. Against any Zeraora variant, use Iron Defense immediately followed by Slack Off. From there, alternate between Slack Off and Iron Defense until Slowbro can 2HKO with Stored Power without getting 2HKOed itself. In terms of team options, Scyther is a fantastic partner to cover counters like Porygon-Z, Dragapult, Gardevoir, and Rillaboom. In return, Slowbro defeats Galarian Darmanitan and Crustle while also being extremely consistent against Zeraora. Fake Tears Sylveon is also a fantastic partner for Slowbro, due to its ability to take care of specially offensive threats like Primarina and Kyurem as well as Dark-types like Urshifu-S and Hydreigon. In return, Sylveon appreciates Slowbro handling Choice Band Crustle and Dracovish. Furthermore, Slowbro is quite slow, leaving it vulnerable to faster Pokemon like Choice Specs Porygon-Z and Rotom-H. Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Goodra are good options to alleviate that weakness.</p> "

This leads to many of Galarian Moltres's matchups being coinflips, such as Volcarona.

Be aware that the rare Choice Scarf Urshifu-R will require a Turn 1 Thunderbolt and will beat Magnezone if it uses Electroweb instead. While the Choice Band Rillaboom matchup seems cut and dry, Rillaboom can usually beat Magnezone without activating Weakness Policy by simply using Wood Hammer. Your opponent will have to misplay and assume a Choice Specs set. To prepare for this, always use Electroweb on the off chance that they do mispredict and use Superpower or High Horsepower. Magnezone struggles against Dragon-types such as Curse Dragapult, Mold Breaker Haxorus, Choice Scarf Dracovish, and Kommo-o.

However, against certain Trick users such as Cresselia and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, it is safest to use Encore Turn 1. This locks you into Encore again but nets you a free move Turn 3 to use Air Slash, which locks you into Air Slash for the final turn of Encore on Turn 4, resetting the cycle. If the foe uses an attacking move Turn 1 and deals less than half of Togekiss's health, it is generally safe to spam Roost and fish for paralysis turns before going for flinches with Air Slash. This keeps Togekiss from dropping to a stray critical hit as well as not risking being caught by priority or some other gimmick such as a surprise Custap Berry user. If the foe uses a setup or status move such as Calm Mind, Swords Dance, or Substitute, Togekiss should usually use Encore to lock them into their move so they can safely break them down without needing to deal with flinch and paralysis chances as long as Togekiss outspeeds. Where Togekiss shouldn't use Encore is against Pokemon like Aromatisse.

Use Air Slash when Togekiss needs to flinch a Pokemon like Naganadel or Volcanion that would KO it otherwise. Use Dazzling Gleam or Fire Blast when either of them more reliably wins the matchup such as against Garchomp or Ferrothorn, respectively. Trick is for opposing setup Pokemon as well as Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Dragapult, and Primarina that can't reliably 2HKO Togekiss.

Protect and Substitute are essential to make the most of Leech Seed recovery, while Protect has the added bonus of being used to scout for moves such as Trick and Taunt, with Prankster Substitute and Taunt serving to neutralize those threats respectively. Taunt also serves the purpose of preventing the use of recovery from opposing Pokemon such as Galarian Corsola and stall Snorlax with the option of Moonblast to help against Pokemon that otherwise beat Whimsicott, such as Urshifu-S, Mandibuzz, and Grass-types such as Rillaboom and opposing Whimsicott. Occa Berry alongside 248 HP EVs, 152 Defense EVs, and a Bold nature allows Whimsicott to always survive Alolan Marowak's Flare Blitz and Choice Specs Rotom-H's Overheat at -2. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Defense for maximum special bulk. Babiri Berry is another option, allowing Whimsicott to set up on Steel-types such as Aegislash and Magnezone. If Babiri Berry is used, an alternative spread of 248 HP / 140 Def / 120 SpD is required to survive against the aforementioned Steel-types, as well as Moonblast from Choice Specs Primarina.</p> <p>When using Whimsicott, most positive matchups are won by using Leech Seed Turn 1 and alternating between clicking Protect and Substitute. If you survive the first hit, Leech Seed stalling with Protect into Substitute will usually let you regain around 25% every two turns, allowing you to avoid all damage behind a Protect or a Prankster Substitute until the foe has lost its HP. Protect should always be used immediately to scout for Trick from common Choice-item Pokemon such as Rotom-H and Togekiss. If Rotom-H uses Overheat instead of Trick, using Substitute twice on Overheat followed by Leech Seed is optimal to minimize Whimsicott's chance of losing to poor RNG. It should also be noted that Gardevoir is an outlier, as it is a Choice item Trick user that is able to defeat Whimsicott due to Trace, which allows for a Prankster Trick. Whimsicott primarily struggles with Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed, so Fire-types such as Arcanine and Incineroar make great partners.

Galarian Darmanitan is 2HKOed by Moonblast and Rocky Helmet damage from Aromatisse, which means that if Aromatisse dodges or survives Giga Impact turn 1 and uses Trick Room, it can use Moonblast, disable Giga Impact as it recharges, and use Moonblast again to KO Galarian Darmanitan.</p> <p>With the defensive spread, use Icicle Crash or Ice Punch versus Celesteela instead of Flare Blitz. This ensures that Celesteela will not KO Galarian Darmanitan afterwards, and the Ice-type moves 2HKO most Celesteela.</p> "

If you believe your opponent is running a defensive Urshifu-R, use Iron Defense on the first turn to not get KOed by Body Press. However, if you suspect Urshifu-R is offensive, use Power Whip on the first turn instead to OHKO it after Close Combat.

Hydreigon, in return, is able to take out stall Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Mandibuzz and offensive Pokemon like Excadrill and Adamant Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan. Hydreigon is also troubled by physical attackers such as Conkeldurr, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Unnerve Choice Band, or Haban Berry Haxorus, and Avalugg. Fairy-types such as Primarina, Sylveon, and Aromatisse all pair well with Hydreigon, as they are able to cover Hydreigon's physical weaknesses, while Hydreigon can take on Poison-type threats such as Toxtricity and Silvally-Poison.

        "description": "<p>THIS ANALYSIS IS FROM AN EARLIER META! It may not reflect current usage of this Pokémon.</p> <p>By employing the FEAR strategy, Togedemaru can use Sturdy to keep itself at 1 HP, Endeavor to simultaneously bring the foe down to 1 HP and heal itself back to full HP with Shell Bell, and Toxic or Spiky Shield to finally finish off the foe. This strategy can beat Pokemon such as Dracovish, Diggersby, and Sawk. This set's main purpose is psychological warfare; its presence instills fear into the opponent at Team Preview, making the user's own picking easier. The EVs are irrelevant due to the nature of being Level 1. Endeavor is crucial in order to bring the foe to 1 HP for Togedemaru to finish it off with Toxic or Spiky Shield. Toxic is Togedemaru's main way to finish off the foe. Note that if the foe uses Counter, Toxic should be used first before Endeavor. Spiky Shield is used to finish off the foe if they rely on contact moves, such as Sawk, Durant, and Conkeldurr. This is useful because unlike Toxic, Spiky Shield cannot miss, and it protects Togedemaru from moves like Knock Off, which removes Shell Bell, and Iron Head, which can cause Togedemaru to flinch. Additionally, Spiky Shield is also used to scout for Trick or Switcheroo from common Choice-item Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Malamar. If Trick or Switcheroo is used, Encore can then be used to lock the foe into the move, allowing Togedemaru to freely use Endeavor and Toxic. Encore also allows Togedemaru to turn its matchup against Will-O-Wisp users like Arcanine into a coinflip. Berry Juice is another option over Shell Bell, allowing Togedemaru to consistently beat Counter users like Chansey while sacrificing matchups against some Sitrus Berry users like Arcanine. Alternatively, Disarming Voice can be used for its flawless accuracy and ability to hit Steel-types like non-Rock Blast Choice Band Steelix and Choice Specs Magnezone. However, Disarming Voice must be used with Shell Bell in order to bring the enemy to 1 HP. Togedemaru is completely helpless against anything that is immune to Endeavor, such as Dragapult, Galarian Corsola, and Zeraora after it uses Plasma Fists. Pokemon like Fake Tears Sylveon can help remedy this, along with beating Rest users like Type: Null and stall Rotom-W, while Togedemaru takes care of threats to Sylveon such as Dracovish and Diggersby. The FEAR strategy also gets ruined by Substitute, Encore, and Yawn users such as Volcarona, Aromatisse, and Sylveon. Choice Band Dracovish can take care of these threats as well as help with Taunt users like Corviknight and Mandibuzz that Togedemaru cannot break. In return, Togedemaru can defeat Pokemon like Sawk and non-Substitute Kyurem. Togedemaru is also weak to Pokemon that use Mold Breaker, such as Haxorus and Excadrill, so teammates like bulky Primarina can cover for them. Togedemaru in return beats Pokemon like Diggersby and Milotic for Primarina.</p> "

These two moves allow Kommo-o to wall and takedown threats like Crustle, Rotom-W, and Snorlax. Clanging Scales is a STAB move for hitting Dragon-types such as Dracovish, Timid Choice item Dragapult, and Dracozolt. The fourth slot can either be Counter, used to beat Choice Band Urshifu-S and Urshifu-R, Taunt, which is used for shutting down stall Pokemon like Corviknight and Gastrodon, or Substitute, which is for walling most Sylveon variants, In this case, Soundproof grants Kommo-o immunity to Hyper Voice, although there are risks involved for variants that carry both Quick Attack and Hyper Beam. Haban Berry is used to tank other Dragon-type attacks, namely Draco Meteor from Dragapult and Outrage from Choice Band Dracovish and Choice Band Dracozolt. The HP investment is for tanking a Draco Meteor from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult, while the Special Attack investment is to ensure that Clanging Scales OHKOes non-Haban Berry Dracovish. The Speed investment is to outspeed Adamant Choice Band Diggersby and the rest is dumped into Defense with a Bold nature to maximize defensive and offensive capabilities. An alternative EV spread of 200 HP / 84 Def / 224 SpD with a Bold nature can be run in order to survive a Choice Scarf Hyper Beam from Porygon-Z, with the leftover EVs invested into Defense to maximize Body Press' power.</p> <p>Kommo-o's typing makes it extremely weak to Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Primarina, and Aromatisse. Steel- and Poison-types such as Durant, Togedemaru, and Silvally-Poison are good teammates since they can deal with these threats. Kommo-o is a good partner for Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight, as it covers their weakness to Fire- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Incineroar and Conkeldurr. Kommo-o struggles to deal with Ghost-types that can't be OHKOed by Clanging Scales, Pokemon that can 2HKO it such as Aegislash, Gengar and Chandelure, as well as Psychic-types that OHKO it such as Celebi and Gardevoir. As such, Pokemon with naturally high Special Defense like Choice Band Snorlax and Choice Specs Rotom-H make for generally good partners, since they can often take a hit and then OHKO back. Kommo-o is also weak to Ice-type moves from Pokemon such as Avalugg, Galarian Darmanitan, and offensive Kyurem, so Fire- and Rock-types such as Arcanine and Crustle are good partners for Kommo-o.</p> "

Thunderbolt is usually used once foes can no longer damage Tapu Koko more quickly than it heals. Eerie Impulse shuts down many special attackers such as Tapu Lele and non-Choice Scarf Heatran. Taunt is for a better matchup against opposing stall Pokemon, such as Registeel and Zapdos. It also stifiles setup Pokemon, like Nasty Plot Galarian Moltres, Fake Tears Sylveon, and Metal Sound Magnezone.

Many Pokemon, like Togekiss, have Choice Scarf variants that run Trick, which could lock Tapu Koko into a status move. To prevent this, you should use Thunderbolt against potential Trick Pokemon on turn 1. One major exception to this rule is the Cresselia matchup, where Tapu Koko should use Taunt first because Choice Scarf Cresselia does not usually run enough Speed EVs to be faster than Tapu Koko. Using Taunt on Cresselia also prevents non-Choice item variants from using Calm Mind. Outside of these matchups, blocking setup Pokemon such as Volcorona or Zapdos with Taunt or using Eerie Impulse or Iron Defense to live attacks from Volcanion and Rillaboom is the best first course of action.</p> "

It may not reflect current usage of this Pokémon.</p> <p>Draco Meteor is Dragapult's strongest attack and is STAB-boosted and used to KO both frail and non-Haban Berry Dragon-type Pokemon, like Dracovish and Choice Band Haxorus. Shadow Ball also receives a boost from STAB and hits Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Gengar, physically defensive Galarian Corsola, and Choice Specs Chandelure for super effective damage. Opposing Substitute + Disable Dragapult will also be threatened by Shadow Ball. Flamethrower is mostly used to hit Steel-types such as Corviknight, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn. Hydro Pump is an option that improves matchups against Arcanine and non-Assault Vest Rhyperior. Thunderbolt may be used to beat Gyarados. The given Speed EVs allow Dragapult to outspeed Pokeomon like Inteleon and Adamant Choice Scarf Diggersby, with a slight optimization to always live Choice Specs Flash Cannon from Magnezone.</p> <p>Dragapult does well on teams with walls such as Corsola, Corviknight, and Milotic, as it's able to take on many of the hardest-hitting Pokemon in the tier such as Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Dracovish, Choice Specs Hydreigon, which can brute through stall. In turn, Dragapult appreciates their ability to take on most Choice Scarf users that can outspeed it such as Hydreigon, Haxorus, and Sawk. Dragapult does not hit especially hard, so many Pokemon may run EVs to tank hits from it, such as Aegislash and Arcanine, which a Dragapult user should be aware of. Dragapult is very easy to use; with few exceptions, use the move the deals the most damage.</p> "

Thunder Cage is its main STAB move, dealing solid damage and beating Endure users like Primarina, Blaziken, and Porygon-Z. Thunder deals more damage, which matters against Pokemon like Spectrier and non-specially defensive Necrozma.

The remaining EVs are put in Defense, as most priority moves and the few Choice Scarf users that outspeed Regieleki skew physically.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Regieleki's matchups are simple: figure out what move can OHKO and use it. Against potential Endure users like Primarina and Galarian Moltres, Regieleki should use Thunder Cage to KO them with trapping damage if they use Endure. In situations where Thunder Cage deals sufficient damage to KO, it should be used over Thunder, as it has a smaller risk to miss.</p> "

The Special Defense and Speed EVs allow Regidrago to survive Nihilego's Meteor Beam and outspeed it at +1.

Outrage OHKOes many Dragon-types such as Naganadel and Dragapult after surviving their attacks with Haban Berry. Breaking Swipe + Draco Meteor improves the Avalugg matchup, as at -1 Attack, Regidrago survives an Icicle Spear and has favorable odds to tank an Avalanche.

The Defense investment alongside Haban Berry allows Regidrago to tank a Dragon Darts from Choice Band Dragapult, and the Special Defense investment allows Regidrago to survive Draco Meteor from Modest Choice Specs Naganadel.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 88 HP / 252 Def / 24 SpA / 144 SpD with a Bold nature can be run to beat Choice Band Zeraora. It does not have the Speed investment that the main spread has, though, so it won't outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon after Scale Shot. This set should run Dragon Energy over Draco Meteor to deal more consistent damage to Rhyperior, Volcanion, and Swampert while also retaining some stallbreaking capabilities.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Scale Shot should be used turn 1 versus faster stall Pokemon, especially Entei and Zapdos, since +1 Regidrago outspeeds and 2HKOes them with Outrage.</p> <p>Breaking Swipe should be used to reduce Avalugg's or Crustle's Attack and break their Sturdy ability; Regidrago survives their attacks at -1 and KOes either with Draco Meteor afterwards.</p> "

Will-O-Wisp is absolutely essential; it allows Spectrier to tank physical attackers like non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, Metagross, non-Choice Scarf Sawk, and Aggron. Calm Mind lets Spectrier defeat Naganadel and Necrozma. Taunt is a useful tool against Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, Zapdos, Maranga Berry Togekiss, and Registeel.

Disable is another option at Spectrier’s disposal, being able to beat Choice item users one-on-one such as Choice Specs Volcanion, Choice Band Landorus-T while providing better reliability against Choice Scarf Haxorus and Choice Scarf Heatran. However, forgoing Taunt will mean that Spectrier now loses to stall Pokemon like Zapdos and Maranga Berry Togekiss.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>212 EVs in HP and 16 EVs in Special Defense allow Spectrier to handle Choice Specs Necrozma by letting it tank two Photon Geysers after a Calm Mind boost and Sitrus Berry heal. 184 EVs in Speed and a Timid nature let Spectrier outspeed and beat Naganadel. The rest of the EVs are invested in Defense to better tank attacks like Choice Band Garchomp's Outrage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Spectrier can defeat strategies based on Endure + Custap Berry used by Pokemon like Primarina, Aggron, and Sawk, as a Will-O-Wisp burn will ensure that these Pokemon are KOed even if they use Endure. Thus, against all aforementioned Pokemon, you should use Will-O-Wisp. However, Primarina will still win against Spectrier if Moonblast does drop Spectrier's Special Attack after a Calm Mind. There are some situations where Spectrier needs to use Calm Mind or another move to win. Against Necrozma, use Calm Mind first to ensure that Choice Specs-boosted Prismatic Laser doesn't OHKO Spectrier, and then 2HKO back with Hex. Kartana is beat by using Will-O-Wisp followed by Hex. Against Cresselia, Spectrier should use Taunt first; this helps prevent its slower Choice Scarf set from using Trick and beating Spectrier with Psychic, in addition to preventing its stall set from using Calm Mind. Be aware that Life Orb Rillaboom wins against Spectrier by using Grassy Glide followed by Wood Hammer, as boosted Hex will not OHKO Rillaboom, and offensive Grassy Seed variants with Knock Off also beat Spectrier. Choice Scarf users like Kartana and Galarian Darmanitan are often problematic, as they can land a attack before Spectrier can use Will-O-Wisp or Calm Mind.</p> "
