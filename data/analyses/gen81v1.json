It may not reflect current usage of this Pokémon.</p> <p>Arcanine can use its powerful Fire-type STAB moves against many top threats in the metagame such as non-Occa Berry Whimsicott, Galarian Darmanitan, and Corviknight. In addition to this, its fantastic ability in Intimidate makes its good physical bulk better, allowing it to even face foes that can hit it super effectively such as Haxorus and Choice Scarf Excadrill. Flare Blitz is Arcanine's STAB move of choice, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Excadrill. Close Combat can help with handling and OHKOing Normal-, Rock-, and Dark-types such as Choice Specs Porygon-Z, Tyranitar, and non-Choice Specs Hydreigon, while Play Rough lets you OHKO Urshifu-S while still being able to OHKO non-Choice Specs Hydreigon. Outrage is useful for the plethora of Dragon-types in 1v1 such as Haxorus, Dracovish, and Dragapult, assuming they aren't holding a Haban Berry. Extreme Speed gives Arcanine a guaranteed matchup against Choice Scarf Togekiss as Arcanine 3HKOes with priority whilst Togekiss can only 3HKO back but lacks priority itself. Wild Charge can also be used for a better matchup against non-bulky Gyarados. The given HP and Special Defense investment allows Arcanine to avoid the OHKO from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor. The given Speed investment outspeeds Timid Choice Specs Porygon-Z. You can also use a simple spread with maximum Attack and Speed investment, which lets you OHKO non-bulky Urshifu-S with Close Combat at the cost of the Choice Specs Dragapult matchup.</p> <p>Water-types like bulky Assault Vest or Chilan Berry Primarina or Azumarill are great teammates due to their great coverage against Rock- and Ground-types like Crustle and Rhyperior. In return, Arcanine covers for Grass-types such as Rillaboom, Celebi and non-Occa Berry Whimsicott. In addition to this, Grass-types such as Rillaboom cover Arcanine's weaknesses in Rock-, Ground- and Water-types such as Rhyperior and Gastrodon, and Arcanine in return covers for some of their weaknesses such as Bug-types like Durant and certain opposing Grass-types like Venusaur.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Arcanine is an excellent physical wall that can also counter some special attackers like Magnezone, Chandelure, and Aegislash. Intimidate combined with Arcanine's defensive utility in Will-O-Wisp and Burn Up lets it take physical hits from the likes of Galarian Darmanitan, non-Swords Dance Haxorus, and Choice Band Crustle. Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple physical attackers such as Diggersby as well as Sawk and Avalugg while also breaking their Sturdy. Arcanine uses Morning Sun to deal with Pokemon that may otherwise overwhelm it, like Choice Band Haxorus and Golisopod. Burn Up KOes Pokemon like Galarian Darmanitan and offensive Rillaboom and also removes Arcanine's Fire typing so that it is no longer weak to Rock-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks, which proves to be useful in matchups against non-Lum Berry Crustle, non-Swords Dance Rhyperior, and Adamant Choice Band Dracovish. Snarl is used to lower the Special Attack of Pokemon like Magnezone, Galarian Weezing, and Chandelure. Flamethrower deals consistent damage against threats Arcanine needs to hit more than once such as defensive Rillaboom, Taunt Zeraora, and Corviknight. Sitrus Berry gives Arcanine a source of immediate recovery to aid it in dealing with Choice Band Mold Breaker Haxorus and Assault Vest Kyurem so that it doesn't get knocked out after the first hit. Maximum Defense investment alongside 72 HP EVs with a Bold nature allows Arcanine to survive a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake from Jolly Galarian Darmanitan. 136 Speed EVs ensure that Arcanine is faster than Modest base 80 Speed Pokemon and below, such as Choice Specs Chandelure, offensive Venusaur, and Adamant Choice Band Dracovish and Diggersby. The leftover 48 EVs are invested into Special Attack to maximize the damage of Burn Up and Snarl. When using Flamethrower over Snarl, a spread of 244 HP / 136 Def / 8 SpA / 120 Spe should be used, which ensures Arcanine will always survive a Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Beam from Modest Magnezone while still surviving an Earthquake from Jolly Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, though it comes at the expense of no longer outspeeding fully invested base 80 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>Generally, Arcanine will find itself using Will-O-Wisp against physical attackers, although there are some matchups where this isn't ideal. Against non-Lum Berry Crustle, Choice Band Dracovish, and Choice Band Diggersby, Arcanine should use Burn Up to rid itself of its Fire typing followed by Will-O-Wisp and Morning Sun; this is because Burn Up is 100% accurate and achieves the same effect of halving damage as using Will-O-Wisp would, so you don't run the risk of losing on account of a miss. Certain defensive Primarina variants, like Assault Vest, can also be beaten by Arcanine through the use of Burn Up, Snarl, and Will-O-Wisp, but because Primarina can often run numerous varying techs, Arcanine shouldn't be relied on as a Primarina answer. Will-O-Wisp is also useful against special attackers like Magnezone, since it breaks its Sturdy so that Burn Up can then KO it. Will-O-Wisp also chips down Aegislash so that Burn Up can KO it after six turns of burn damage without risking the activation of its Weakness Policy. Against Choice Specs Magnezone, Arcanine should use Snarl to both break Sturdy and ensure that Arcanine will survive any hit. Pokemon like Sylveon, Primarina, and Choice Band Snorlax appreciate Arcanine's ability to handle hyper offensive threats like Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Adamant Choice Band Dracovish, and Rillaboom. In turn, these Pokemon help cover Arcanine's weakness to specially offensive threats like opposing Primarina, Hydreigon, and Kyurem. Arcanine struggles a bit when it comes to certain Encore and Taunt users like Primarina, Aromatisse, Kommo-o, and Corviknight if not running Flamethrower, so it appreciates the assistance provided by hyper offensive Pokemon like Choice Specs Porygon-Z, Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Salazzle, and Choice Specs Gengar. In return, Arcanine helps cover their weaknesses to bulky offense and Sturdy Pokemon like Assault Vest Azumarill, non-Swords Dance Rhyperior, Magnezone, Sawk, and Avalugg.</p> "

It may not reflect current usage of this Pokémon.</p> <p>Thanks to its excellent defensive typing and great defensive stats, Slowbro is a threatening stall Pokemon in the 1v1 metagame. Its ability Oblivious helps it function as an effective PP staller, blocking Taunt from Pokemon like Corviknight, Haxorus, and Whimsicott. Iron Defense allows Slowbro to deal with physical powerhouses in the tier such as Galarian Darmanitan, Crustle, and Dracovish. Calm Mind covers Slowbro's mediocre Special Defense, which is useful against Pokemon such as Primarina and Salazzle, while also boosting the damage of Stored Power to defeat opposing stall Pokemon like Snorlax and Galarian Corsola. Slack Off allows Slowbro to heal damage taken while boosting its defensive stats. Rest is another recovery option that allows Slowbro to defeat Pokemon that use Toxic such as Chansey, but Slack Off is generally preferred to make it far less passive. Stored Power provides Slowbro with offensive capabilities that benefit from its defensive boosts, dealing with Pokemon such as Urshifu-R, Arcanine, and Kommo-o. The given EV spread with a Bold nature and the help of a Sitrus Berry is optimal for dealing with physical attackers like Haxorus and Galarian Darmanitan.</p> <p>Slowbro's main gameplan is to tank hits while setting up to improve its defensive capabilities. As such, Slowbro's passiveness leaves it vulnerable to Encore and Trick users like Primarina, Aromatisse, and Gardevoir. Against stall Rotom-W, use Calm Mind turn one, as Thunderbolt will deal less than 75% HP, activating Slowbro's Sitrus Berry. Afterwards, use Slack Off until it is around 80% health, then keep using Calm Mind and healing until Slowbro is at +3 and OHKO with Stored Power. Against any Zeraora variant, use Iron Defense immediately followed by Slack Off. From there, alternate between Slack Off and Iron Defense until Slowbro can 2HKO with Stored Power without getting 2HKOed itself. In terms of team options, Scyther is a fantastic partner to cover counters like Porygon-Z, Dragapult, Gardevoir, and Rillaboom. In return, Slowbro defeats Galarian Darmanitan and Crustle while also being extremely consistent against Zeraora. Fake Tears Sylveon is also a fantastic partner for Slowbro, due to its ability to take care of specially offensive threats like Primarina and Kyurem as well as Dark-types like Urshifu-S and Hydreigon. In return, Sylveon appreciates Slowbro handling Choice Band Crustle and Dracovish. Furthermore, Slowbro is quite slow, leaving it vulnerable to faster Pokemon like Choice Specs Porygon-Z and Rotom-H. Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Goodra are good options to alleviate that weakness.</p> "

Soft-Boiled helps in matchups where the foe also has recovery to maintain health while Toxic whittles them down, which is particularly useful against Quiver Dance Volcarona, although Chansey will have to play around Substitute if Volcarona is running that. While Chansey's physical bulk is not nearly as good as its special bulk, the given EV investment allows for its to be as physically bulky as possible, letting it survive a hit from Choice item Haxorus, offensive Rillaboom, and Jolly Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan to OHKO them with Counter. Charm is an option over Counter to handle physical attackers that would like to set up on Chansey such as Shell Smash Crustle, Swords Dance Rhyperior, and Bulk Up Zeraora.

STAB Play Rough and Liquidation enable it to defeat Dragon- and Fire-types such as Haxorus, Kommo-o, and Volcarona. Aqua Jet gives Azumarill a way to pick off weakened foes like Choice item Rotom-H, Sawk, and Gardevoir. Superpower is an extremely important move in order to deal with Choice item Porygon-Z. The given EV spread ensures Azumarill will survive a Hyper Beam from Modest Choice Specs Porygon-Z and tank a Poison Jab from Jolly Choice Band Haxorus and Adamant Choice Band Urshifu-S. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack to maximize damage output. Alternatively, 132 HP / 124 Atk / 252 Def EVs with an Adamant nature let Azumarill survive a Choice Band Rock Wrecker from Crustle, but you lose the special bulk necessary to handle Choice Specs Porygon-Z. Since this alternative spread only defeats Choice Scarf Porygon-Z sets, Superpower becomes less of a necessity, meaning it can be replaced with Knock Off or Bulldoze instead, allowing Azumarill to defeat Substitute + Disable Dragapult or Magnezone.</p> <p>While Porygon-Z looks manageable at first glance with the help of Assault Vest, it sometimes runs a defensive Chople Berry set, utilizing Superpower's Attack drop to freely Recover and use Nasty Plot to reach +4 and OHKO Azumarill. Against Choice Band Sawk, it is best to use Aqua Jet turn one and then Play Rough, as it is likely that it is running Counter and will KO you if you use Play Rough, but there is the possibility of it using Poison Jab. Situations with the same guidelines include facing Alolan Marowak and Choice Band Crustle, if using the alternative spread. Despite being bolstered by Assault Vest, there are still special threats that Azumarill should try to avoid, like Choice Specs Primarina, Magnezone, and Porygon2. Azumarill enjoys having Kyurem as a partner, luring in threats such as Haxorus, Volcarona, and Urshifu-S, while Kyurem can deal with stall users like Slowbro, Mandibuzz, and Skarmory. Choice Specs Rotom-H also has great synergy with Azumarill, combating the likes of Chansey, Celebi, and Aegislash. In return, Azumarill can handle Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Kommo-o. Pokemon that can deal with physical wallbreakers pair well with Azumarill. Salazzle and Hawlucha are valued because of this, handling wallbreakers like Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Rillaboom, and Durant. In return, Azumarill can deal with Trick users like Choice item Rotom-H and Gardevoir. Due to Azumarill's mediocre Speed, it is often overwhelmed by faster Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Choice Band Diggersby. Therefore, faster Pokemon like Porygon-Z and Rillaboom pair well with it.

Galarian Corsola can beat back threats like Arcanine and opposing Primarina in return. Lastly, certain Trick users like Gardevoir, Malamar, and heavily HP-invested Rotom-W can present a problem for Galarian Corsola, so Pokemon that do not mind being Tricked and can avoid the move altogether, like Excadrill and Whimsicott, can be good partners.

Hyper Voice is a solid STAB attack that bypasses Substitute, making it especially useful against Pokemon like PP stall Kyurem, Leech Seed Venusaur, and Moonblast Whimsicott. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types like Chandelure and Gengar and has a 40% chance to lower the foe's Special Defense due to Serene Grace, while Flamethrower is useful against Steel-types like Magnezone, Ferrothorn, and non-Occa Berry Scizor. Calm Mind provides Blissey with offensive pressure and prevents it from losing to opposing Calm Mind users like Primarina as well as Amnesia users like Galarian Corsola. Scope Lens is useful versus stall Pokemon like Rotom-W, Galarian Corsola, and Slowbro, allowing Blissey to more easily score a critical hit in a longer game. A Timid nature with 216 Speed EVs allows Blissey to outspeed neutral-natured base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Primarina and Sylveon, while 52 Defense EVs let Blissey survive a Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch from Scizor and avoid the 2HKO from Corviknight's Iron Head. An alternate EV spread of 52 Def / 252 SpA / 204 Spe with a Modest nature can also be used, which improves Blissey's odds versus bulky Pokemon like Yawn Sylveon and Togekiss while hitting the same defensive benchmarks.

Porygon-Z can set up with Nasty Plot and use Eerie Impulse to minimize Blissey's damage. Choice Scarf Gardevoir utilizes Trick and Disable, only losing to an inconsistent Shadow Ball Special Defense drop or critical hit. Togekiss has positive chances to win thanks to its combination of Thunder Wave and Air Slash, while Choice Specs variants can simply spam Air Slash, which is also favorable to the opponent due to flinches. Additionally, Assault Vest Goodra can easily tank Blissey's moves and whittle it down using Acid Spray. While in most matchups Blissey can safely set up with Calm Mind turn one, against faster Pokemon with Encore or Trick, like Togekiss and Chandelure, Blissey should attack to prevent the possibility of getting locked into a non-damaging move. Taunt Whimsicott requires multiple successful 50/50s on Whimsicott's end, in order to simultaneously prevent Calm Mind boosting Hyper Voice and being hit from Flamethrower too often. Blissey also finds itself susceptible to many prominent physical attackers like Galarian Darmanitan, Urshifu-R, and Haxorus. As such, Blissey appreciates the support from Pokemon that are able to deal with these threats such as Crustle, defensive Arcanine, and Primarina.

It may not reflect current usage of this Pokémon.</p> <p>Thanks to its ability Sturdy, Magnezone beats most Choice item attackers, including Galarian Darmanitan, Urshifu-R, and Crustle. Thunderbolt and Flash Cannon are Magnezone's strongest STAB options, hitting Pokemon such as Primarina, Skarmory, and Fairy-types including Sylveon and Aromatisse, alongside Unnerve Haxorus. Electroweb allows it to beat opposing Sturdy Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Sawk whilst providing vital speed control against Pokemon like Eerie Impulse Porygon-Z and Dracovish. Metal Sound helps beat stall Pokemon like Type: Null and defensive Rotom-W, whilst Mirror Coat is an option to beat some special attackers Magnezone would otherwise be unable to deal with, such as opposing Choice Specs Magnezone. Magnezone's defensive investment allows it to live two Outrages from Choice Band Unnerve Haxorus and Surging Strikes from Choice Band Adamant Urshifu-R, and its Speed investment allows it to outspeed Wacan Berry Urshifu-R and Choice Band Urshifu-S after an Electroweb, alongside Speed tying other base 60 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>While Magnezone beats most Water-types, Primarina can live a Thunderbolt and beat Magnezone with Torrent-boosted Sparkling Aria into Aqua Jet. So, Magnezone should use Electroweb on Turn 1 to avoid putting Primarina into Torrent range, and only then use Thunderbolt on Turn 2 for the KO. Assault Vest variants will unfortunately be able to beat Magnezone, so avoid this matchup. Against Urshifu-R, use Electroweb Turn 1, in order to beat both the common Choice Band variant and the viable Wacan Berry set, followed up by Thunderbolt. Be aware that the rare Choice Scarf Urshifu-R will require a Turn 1 Thunderbolt and will beat Magnezone if it uses Electroweb instead. While the Choice Band Rillaboom matchup seems cut and dry, Rillaboom can usually beat Magnezone without activating Weakness Policy by simply using Wood Hammer. Your opponent will have to misplay and assume a Choice Specs set. To prepare for this, always use Electroweb on the off chance that they do mispredict and use Superpower or High Horsepower. Magnezone struggles against Dragon-types such as Curse Dragapult, Mold Breaker Haxorus, Choice Scarf Dracovish, and Kommo-o. Because of this, Fairy-type partners such as Primarina and Sylveon are appreciated. They in turn enjoy Magnezone's support to deal with physical breakers such as Galarian Darmanitan and Crustle. Dragon-types such as Choice Scarf Unnerve Haxorus and Haban Berry Kommo-o are also good team options for Magnezone, being able to deal with the aforementioned Dragon-type threats that Magnezone cannot break through. In return, Magnezone beats Fairy-types like Sylveon and Aromatisse. Despite making use of Metal Sound, Magnezone is unable to KO Chansey in the 4 turns that it uses Seismic Toss. Teammates that can deal with Chansey include Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R, Urshifu-S, Sawk, and Conkeldurr, all of which subsequently appreciate Magnezone's ability to deter Fairy-types.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mental Herb instead of Maranga Berry sacrfices certain matchups like Volcanion for the ability to beat Taunt and Encore users such as Spectrier and Gardevoir. Additionally a Charm + Kee Berry set allows Togekiss to answer slower physical threats such as Metagross, Aggron, Rhyperior, and Glastrier by reducing their attack and healing with Roost, slowly chipping them down with Counter or Air Slash. A Choice Specs set sacrifices some of Togekiss's Speed for more power, being able to break down bulky Pokemon like Volcanion quickly and reliably because you don't need as many flinches. This set can also run Grass Knot as a niche move to catch Pokemon like Rhyperior and Swampert. Nasty Plot is another option that can be used over Encore on Thunder Wave variants. Nasty Plot can help against stall users like Kyurem and Leftovers Gastrodon, if running Encore. Resist Berry sets usually are paired with Counter. Babiri Berry, for example, can lure Pokemon like Metagross or Kartana by surviving a hit and using Counter. It can also run other Berries such as Wacan Berry, Charti Berry, and even Yache Berry for threats such as Choice Band Zeraora, Choice Band Landorus-T, and Galarian Darmanitan respectively. However, Togekiss often has to sacrifice a lot of matchups to run these sets due to it needing to dedicate nearly all of its resources to run them. This makes these sets relatively niche and often saved for tournament play.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Togekiss makes use of tactical RNG manipulation through Serene Grace, Air Slash, and paralysis to immobilize and break down foes. Maranga Berry allows it to more reliably wall many special attackers such as Primarina, Sylveon, and Volcanion. Thunder Wave is useful for speed control in addition to making immobilizing foes more reliable. Roost paired with paralysis allows Togekiss to fish for paralysis turns while recovering, which increases reliability even more. Encore is useful for locking stall Pokemon such as stall Cresselia and Corsola-G into their setup moves, as well as bulky offensive setup Pokemon like Galarian Moltres, Primarina, and Fake Tears Sylveon by locking them into their status moves.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>The EVs allow Togekiss to survive Choice Specs Pixilate Sylveon's Hyper Beam and outspeed Choice Scarf Tapu Fini and Adamant Choice Scarf Haxorus after Thunder Wave. 52 Defense EVs maximize reliability against Assault Vest Arcanine and certain Dracovish sets.</p> <p>An alternative spread of 96 HP / 140 SpA / 20 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature allows Togekiss to defeat Magnezone with Mystical Fire. The EV spread allows Togekiss to defeat Choice Specs Volcarona and outspeeds bulky Tapu Fini variants as well as other Maranga Togekiss.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Most matchups with Maranga Berry Togekiss begin with Togekiss using Thunder Wave Turn 1. However, against certain Trick users such as Cresselia and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, it is safest to use Encore Turn 1. This locks you into Encore again but nets you a free move Turn 3 to use Air Slash, which locks you into Air Slash for the final turn of Encore on Turn 4, resetting the cycle. If the foe uses an attacking move Turn 1 and deals less than half of Togekiss's health, it is generally safe to spam Roost and fish for paralysis turns before going for flinches with Air Slash. This keeps Togekiss from dropping to a stray critical hit as well as not risking being caught by priority or some other gimmick such as a surprise Custap Berry user. If the foe uses a setup or status move such as Calm Mind, Swords Dance, or Substitute, Togekiss should usually use Encore to lock them into their move so they can safely break them down without needing to deal with flinch and paralysis chances as long as Togekiss outspeeds. Where Togekiss shouldn't use Encore is against Pokemon like Aromatisse. Instead, Togekiss should spam Air Slash in hopes of getting lucky and flinching Aromatisse down without being locked into Struggle by Encore and Disable.</p> "

It may not reflect current usage of this Pokémon.</p> <p>This Porygon-Z set functions as a menacing wallbreaker due to Nasty Plot and a terrifying Adaptability-boosted STAB move in Hyper Beam. Nasty Plot boosts Porygon-Z's Special Attack to astronomical levels, letting it power through walls like Arcanine, Chansey, Corviknight, and Slowbro. Hyper Beam is Porygon-Z's strongest STAB move and can OHKO certain Pokemon without a boost, such as non-Unnerve Haxorus and Rillaboom. Eerie Impulse, when used with Recover, allows Porygon-Z to break through Primarina and Choice Specs Magnezone. 132 EVs in HP and 252 EVs in Defense alongside Chople Berry allow Porygon-Z to survive a Close Combat from Choice Band Urshifu-R, with Bold beating Adamant variants and Modest only beating Jolly variants, as well as an Outrage from Choice Band Mold Breaker Haxorus. 72 EVs in Speed are run to outspeed non-Jolly Corviknight as well as Pokemon like Choice Specs Modest Magnezone and bulky Rillaboom. The rest is put into Special Attack to maximize damage output. Alternatively, Porygon-Z can run Electroweb instead of Eerie Impulse and a spread of 92 HP / 252 Def / 28 SpA / 136 Spe to beat Choice Band Sawk and Avalugg while outspeeding Choice Band Adamant Dracovish. Another spread it can use is 184 HP / 248 Def / 32 SpA / 44 Spe with Speed Swap and Uproar replacing Eerie Impulse and Recover to reliably defeat Zeraora, stall Rotom-A, and Substitute users like Whimsicott.</p> <p>You want to think carefully when using this Porygon-Z set, as it has many matchups requiring specific play. Against Primarina, Porygon-Z should always use Eerie Impulse immediately to survive the possible Choice Specs Hydro Cannon. If it is an Assault Vest or Chilan Berry variant, Porygon-Z only needs to use Eerie Impulse until it's at -4, heal off damage taken shortly afterwards, Nasty Plot till at least +4, and OHKO with Hyper Beam. To figure out whether the Primarina is Choice Specs or not, if -2 Hydro Cannon deals 58% of damage or more against the standard EV spread, that indicates that it is using Choice Specs, so you can end the battle after one use of Nasty Plot instead of two. Against Choice Specs Magnezone, the same process comes into play; however, you do not need to set up with Nasty Plot, as Hyper Beam 2HKOes. Against stall Arcanine, use Nasty Plot once, as +1 Hyper Beam OHKOes even if they use Snarl. Usually, you will use Hyper Beam first against particular Pokemon that aren't naturally specially defensive, such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and non-Unnerve Choice Band Haxorus. Porygon-Z appreciates Chilan Berry Primarina as a partner, which handles wallbreakers like opposing Choice item Porygon-Z, Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, and Shell Smash Crustle. In return, Porygon-Z can deal with specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Slowbro, and Goodra. Porygon-Z is relatively frail even with this set's bulkier spread and cannot take many hits; thus, bulkier partners such as Magnezone and Arcanine are appreciated. Having partners that can take on Ghost-types like Dragapult, Galarian Corsola, and Gengar is imperative, as Porygon-Z has no moves capable of hitting them. Dark-types like Mandibuzz and Taunt Incineroar help alleviate this weakness. In return, Porygon-Z can handle one of their biggest issues: Urshifu-R.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Porygon-Z is an extremely strong special attacker due to its high Special Attack and Adaptability, and when paired with Choice Specs, this makes it one of the biggest offensive threats in the metagame. Hyper Beam OHKOes threats like Togekiss, Sylveon, and Arcanine. Trick is mainly used against typical stall-oriented Pokemon such as Torment Skarmory, Chansey, and Galarian Corsola to lock them into one move, allowing Porygon-Z to set up with Nasty Plot and KO them once boosted, barring Galarian Corsola which will be PP stalled because Porygon-Z cannot touch it without Dark Pulse. Dark Pulse is able to defeat Alolan Marowak and non-Focus Blast Choice Scarf Gengar, Dark Pulse can also hit Ghost-types, which Hyper Beam can't touch, in specific Galarian Corsola and Alolan Marowak. Uproar can be used over Dark Pulse on lower Special Attack set's to 2HKO non-Mirror Coat Magnezone and Whimsicott. The given EVs allow Porygon-Z to survive Grassy Glide from Choice Band Rillaboom and outspeed non-Choice Scarf Dracozolt and Dracovish, as well as OHKO Alolan-Marowak. An alternative EV spread of 144 HP / 60 Def / 72 SpA / 232 Spe with a Modest nature can be run in order to survive Choice Scarf Chandelure and Modest Scarf Draco Meteor from Hydreigon. However, the drop in Special Attacker makes the Alolan-Marowak match up unreliable, and can hurt with rolls against particularly bulky threats, like uninvested Snorlax. Another EV spread of 4 HP / 200 Def / 72 SpA / 232 Spe can be used to beat Life Orb Rillaboom. Lastly, Porygon-Z can use a spread of 144 HP / 60 Def / 96 SpA / 208 Spe or 148 Def / 152 SpA / 208 Spe with the nature Timid to out speed Adamant Haxorus and Urshifu, alongside doing all that you did before, depending on which one you use. Choice Specs Porygon-Z in general can sacrifice investment in either bulk, power, or speed to beat or get close to beating specific threats, like Excadrill, or fully invest in Speed to speed tie other non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Generally, due to the power Choice Specs gives to Porygon-Z, it has a lot more room to invest in either overwhelming offense or bulk.</p> <p>Trick should be used immediately against Pokemon such as Skarmory, Chansey, Galarian Corsola, and Crustle. Against Skarmory, simply rotate between Hyper Beam and Recover if they're running a damaging move; if you lock them into a status move, simply click Hyper Beam twice. Against Chansey, use Trick followed by Nasty Plot twice to get to +4 and then OHKO with Hyper Beam. Against Galarian Corsola, simply Trick and PP stall it, as it won't have any moves that can deal damage to Porygon-Z. Similarly to Galarian Corsola, Porygon-Z needs to PP stall Crustle. Regardless of what item you receive back, spam Recover until the foe runs out of PP. Due to the multi-hit nature of Rock Blast, the matchup is more favorable for Crustle but is not guaranteed If Crustle goes for Shell Smash on your Trick, simply click Hyper Beam twice, as they will be Choice-locked and unable to attack. Porygon-Z struggles against Fighting-type Pokemon and Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage such as Urshifu-R, Sawk, Hawlucha, and Haxorus. Fairy-type Pokemon, specifically Primarina and Sylveon, go well with Porygon-Z, since they can cover the Fighting-type weakness whilst simultaneously appreciating Porygon-Z's ability to deal with their threats such as Chansey, Rillaboom, Rotom-H as well as Poison-types such as Toxtricity and Venusaur. Porygon-Z needs to be wary of common Chilan Berry and Assault Vest users, mainly Primarina, so consider teammates such as Zeraora and Rillaboom.</p> "

Eerie Impulse is used to drastically weaken special attackers such as Goodra and Primarina, while Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Dracovish, Galarian Darmanitan, and non-Lum Berry Crustle. Rotom-W can use Rest after crippling the foe enough to avoid getting KOed before waking up. Thunderbolt is Rotom-W's only non-status attack and is mainly used to inflict chip damage. Alternatively, Rotom-W can use Hydro Pump to deal damage to Pokemon that aren't affected by Will-O-Wisp such as Arcanine and Incineroar, and it allows Rotom-W to damage Zerarora. This EV set alongside Thunderbolt allows Rotom-W to outstall Seismic Toss users, outspeed base 60 Speed Pokemon, OHKO uninvested Urshifu-R, and take a Choice Band-boosted Superpower from Ushifu-R and both Mold Breaker and Unnerve Choice Scarf Haxorus. When running Hydro Pump, the EV spread should be 240 HP / 220 Def / 48 Spe instead, which maintains Speed and maximizes defensive presence.

Rotom-W is also very susceptible to Taunt users such as Incineroar and Trick users such as Porygon-Z, so Pokemon that are immune or aren't affected by these status moves such as Galarian Darmanitan work very well with Rotom-W. Rotom-W should be careful of Mold Breaker Pokemon such as Excadrill and Choice Band Haxorus that can use Earthquake while ignoring Levitate and Unnerve Haxorus, which can prevent Kee Berry from activating.</p> "

Hydro Pump is Rotom-W's strongest STAB option, dealing with Pokemon that are weak to Water such as Arcanine, Diggersby, and Rhyperior along with neutral targets such as non-Mirror Coat Magnezone and Zeraora. Thunderbolt targets bulkier threats that Hydro Pump cannot break through such as Primarina and Urshifu-R. Trick can stop certain stall Pokemon such as Galarian Corsola and Type: Null by locking them into either a setup move or an attacking move that can't 3HKO, with Rotom-W using Rest at intervals in order to avoid getting KOed. The HP investment means Rotom-W will always survive three Night Shades from Galarian Corsola, and the Defense investment ensures survival against Choice Band Urshifu-S's Close Combat. The Speed investment with a Choice Scarf allows Rotom-W to outspeed +2 Adamant Crustle, while the remaining EVs are invested into Special Attack for maximum damage output.</p> <p>While Trick allows Rotom-W to beat most stall Pokemon, Whimsicott can use Substitute before Rotom-W can use Trick thanks to Prankster. Aromatisse can also easily take hits from Rotom-W or lock it into Trick with Encore if Rotom-W uses Trick to stop Aromatisse's Substitute + Disable strategy. Rotom-W struggles with specially defensive attackers, such as Sylveon and Snorlax, so it appreciates help from physical wallbreakers such as Rillaboom and Galarian Darmanitan. In return, Rotom-W checks the Fire-types that beat both Rillaboom and Galarian Darmanitan along with other threats such as Choice Band Skarmory and Sap Sipper Azumarill. Due to its lack of coverage, Rotom-W is walled by most Dragon- and Grass-types, so Fairy-types such as Primarina and Sylveon are appreciated to help with the former.

A Guts-boosted Close Combat allows Conkeldurr to OHKO many Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn. Many matchups may require or benefit from Mach Punch, such as Sawk, Crustle, and Galarian Darmanitan. Against Crustle, use Mach Punch turn 1 instead of Protect or Close Combat, as this allows Conkeldurr to survive Counter and KO it the next turn with a Guts-boosted Close Combat. Against Sawk, use Mach Punch on turns 1, to avoid being OHKOed by Counter, and either use Close Combat if they used Counter, or use another Mach Punch if they used Close Combat. Using a Guts Boosted Mach Punch against Galarian Darmanitan removes the possibility of losing to Choice Band.

It may not reflect current usage of this Pokémon.</p> <p>Whimsicott’s ability Prankster, along with the combination of Leech Seed, Substitute, and Protect, allows it to Leech Seed stall most non-Leech Seed-immune Pokemon, given that it can survive an attack. Protect and Substitute are essential to make the most of Leech Seed recovery, while Protect has the added bonus of being used to scout for moves such as Trick and Taunt, with Prankster Substitute and Taunt serving to neutralize those threats respectively. Taunt also serves the purpose of preventing the use of recovery from opposing Pokemon such as Galarian Corsola and stall Snorlax with the option of Moonblast to help against Pokemon that otherwise beat Whimsicott, such as Urshifu-S, Mandibuzz, and Grass-types such as Rillaboom and opposing Whimsicott. Occa Berry alongside 248 HP EVs, 152 Defense EVs, and a Bold nature allows Whimsicott to always survive Alolan Marowak's Flare Blitz and Choice Specs Rotom-H's Overheat at -2. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Defense for maximum special bulk. Babiri Berry is another option, allowing Whimsicott to set up on Steel-types such as Aegislash and Magnezone. If Babiri Berry is used, an alternative spread of 248 HP / 140 Def / 120 SpD is required to survive against the aforementioned Steel-types, as well as Moonblast from Choice Specs Primarina.</p> <p>When using Whimsicott, most positive matchups are won by using Leech Seed Turn 1 and alternating between clicking Protect and Substitute. If you survive the first hit, Leech Seed stalling with Protect into Substitute will usually let you regain around 25% every two turns, allowing you to avoid all damage behind a Protect or a Prankster Substitute until the foe has lost its HP. Protect should always be used immediately to scout for Trick from common Choice-item Pokemon such as Rotom-H and Togekiss. If Rotom-H uses Overheat instead of Trick, using Substitute twice on Overheat followed by Leech Seed is optimal to minimize Whimsicott's chance of losing to poor RNG. It should also be noted that Gardevoir is an outlier, as it is a Choice item Trick user that is able to defeat Whimsicott due to Trace, which allows for a Prankster Trick. Whimsicott primarily struggles with Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed, so Fire-types such as Arcanine and Incineroar make great partners. Whimsicott, in return, helps with their weak matchups against Water-types such as Primarina and Dracovish. Whimsicott also struggles with Ice-types and Dark-types not weak to Moonblast such as Avalugg, Galarian Darmanitan, and Incineroar, making Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and Sawk great partners.

Icicle Crash also has a 30% flinch chance, allowing Galarian Darmanitan to potentially beat Sturdy users and bulkier threats like Crustle and Aromatisse. Giga Impact OHKOes many bulkier Pokemon such as Sylveon and Primarina and even has a chance to OHKO physically defensive Tapu Fini. Flare Blitz does massive damage to Steel-types, notably OHKOing Registeel and non-Occa Berry Celesteela, and also helps Galarian Darmanitan defeat slower Volcarona sets.

Against Zeraora, Ferrothorn should use Iron Defense on the first turn, which lets it survive the second turn and then KO with Body Press due to Close Combat Defense drops. If you believe your opponent is running a defensive Urshifu-R, use Iron Defense on the first turn to not get KOed by Body Press. However, if you suspect Urshifu-R is offensive, use Power Whip on the first turn instead to OHKO it after Close Combat. Be mindful that some Pokemon may run Fire-type coverage for Ferrothorn's 4x weakness to deal with it, such as Zeraora, Urshifu-R, Dragapult, and Dracozolt.</p> "

Gyro Ball, which is often Ferrothorn's strongest move, helps beat Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan, Togekiss, and Sylveon. Payback helps Ferrothorn beat Pokemon like non-Choice Specs Magnezone, Metagross, and Trick + Choice Scarf Cresselia. Revenge helps the Magnezone matchup and helps Ferrothorn beat Aggron. Leech Seed solidifies the Aromatisse and Regidrago matchups by allowing Ferrothorn to survive longer and set up further Swords Dances.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>240 HP EVs, 52 Defense EVs, and a Relaxed nature allow Ferrothorn to survive Fire Fang from Choice Band Garchomp.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If a Pokemon's attack will bring Ferrothorn to 25% or less health, it can set up a Swords Dance on the first turn and use its Custap Berry to move first on the next turn. This strategy can be used against Zeraora, Landorus without Protect, and Rillaboom. Against potential Encore users, Ferrothorn should use a damaging move to avoid being locked into Swords Dance or Endure. Against Choice Scarf Togekiss, usually use Endure the first turn to predict their Fire-type coverage and then Gyro Ball on the second turn. However, Togekiss can also use Trick or Encore on the first turn. To avoid this, Ferrothorn can use Gyro Ball on the first turn. Against Alolan Ninetales, Ferrothorn should use Gyro Ball into Power Whip to prevent Disable and Encore from forcing it to use Struggle. Against Aromatisse, Ferrothorn should use Leech Seed on the first turn due to Gyro Ball’s low damage output; due to its HP investment, it can beat Aromatisse even after Aromatisse locks it into Leech Seed or makes it use Struggle. Custap Berry Ferrothorn can beat Choice Band Garchomp by clicking Swords Dance into Gyro Ball, and it beats Regidrago by using Gyro Ball first to avoid being OHKOed by a combination of Dragon Energy and Draco Meteor.</p> "

Porygon-Z sometimes only runs Normal-type coverage, in which case Aegislash autowins, but Aegislash will fall to a combo of Trick into Shadow Ball or Dark Pulse.

        "description": "<p>THIS SET IS FROM AN EARLIER META! It may not reflect current usage of this Pokémon.</p> <p>Aromatisse serves as a bulky Fairy-type that utilizes Trick Room, Encore, and Disable to defeat hyper offensive threats such as Haxorus as well as certain stall Pokemon like Milotic and Rotom-W. 216 HP EVs and 136 Defense EVs allow Aromatisse to survive Choice Band Urshifu-R's Surging Strike, while 216 HP EVs and 156 Special Defense with a Calm Nature makes sure Aromatisse survives a Choice Specs Primarina's Hydro Cannon. Wiki Berry ensures it can survive Choice Band Struggle from Urshifu-R. Aroma Veil immunizes Aromatisse from moves like Taunt, Encore, and Disable. Moonblast hits many metagame-prevalent Pokemon like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan. Aromatisse's remaining three moves are used to set up a combination that forces the foe to damage itself with Struggle. Trick Room allows Aromatisse to outspeed a Pokemon that would normally be faster than it like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and force it to struggle by using Encore and Disable, or just Disable if the foe is holding a Choice item. When predicting that a potential Choice item holder like Rotom-H or Togekiss will use Trick, use Encore to give Aromatisse two free turns of Moonblast, which will often secure the win.</p> <p>Against certain stall Pokemon such as Milotic and Dubwool, using Encore turn one followed by a sequence of Moonblast, Trick Room, Disable, and Encore allows you to lock the opposing Pokemon into Struggle for two turns to deal maximum damage. Against some stall Pokemon with Special Defense-boosting moves that do not resist Moonblast like Rotom-W, Snorlax, and Type: Null, Aromatisse can permanently lock them into a boosting move by using Encore turn one. After that, use Trick Room turn two and repeat each of the status moves whenever it expires until the opposing Pokemon breaks out of Encore before the last turn of Trick Room. Once you are at that turn, use Encore followed by Moonblast and Trick Room and repeat. Doing so in this order will allow you to refresh Trick Room and Encore continuously without giving the opposing Pokemon a chance to switch moves. If they instead attack, use Disable on the attacking move and then KO it with consecutive Moonblasts. Porygon-Z will involve mindgames, either predicting them to attack, in which case you use Trick Room, or Trick, in which case you Encore. Pokemon with a positive matchup against Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-type Pokemon that Aromatisse struggles with, such as Salazzle, Haxorus, Chansey, Urshifu-R, and Dragapult can be useful partners in order to assist Aromatisse.</p> "

Afterwards, it should use Protect if the foe threatens to KO it next turn or is a faster Encore user like Primarina or Togekiss. Against potential Trick users like Choice Scarf Tapu Fini and Togekiss, it is good to use Protect Turn 1 to scout their move, then use Hyper Voice if they used Trick. Fake Tears should be used once against most targets, followed by Hyper Voice spam, but against passive stall Pokemon like Clefable and Stored Power Necrozma, Sylveon should keep using the move until it's able to OHKO or 2HKO. Against Mirror Coat users like Stall Avalugg and Swampert, Sylveon should only attack when it is guaranteed to OHKO or during the opponent's first sleep turn. Sylveon should only use Hyper Beam against a foe likely to be OHKOed, as the recharge turn means that Hyper Voice will otherwise be better.

Avalugg can make good use of Body Press thanks to its aforementioned high Defense stat, being able to muscle through Dark- and Normal-types like Snorlax, Porygon-Z, Porygon2, Hydreigon, and Tyranitar, as well as Galarian Darmanitan and Excadrill. Icicle Spear reliably takes out Grass- and Dragon-types like Whimsicott, Haxorus, and Substitute + Disabe Dragapult, as well as FEAR Pokemon like Togedemaru. Mirror Coat, in combination with Sturdy and its very low Special Defense, lets Avalugg beat specially offensive Choice Item variants like Primarina and Dragapult. However, Mirror Coat is easy to work around if the opponent is not using a Choice Item, so keep that in mind. Heavy Slam takes advantage of Avalugg's high weight, taking down Fairy-types like Sylveon and Aromatisse. Earthquake can alternatively be used to take down the specific threats of non-Air Balloon Zeraora, Aegislash, Chandelure, and Toxtricity. Maximum Attack investment helps Avalugg do as much damage as possible, notably helping it take on Sylveon with Heavy Slam, and maximum Defense investment maximizes its physical bulk while also boosting the power of Body Press. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 36 Atk / 224 Def alongside an Impish nature allows Avalugg to avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Choice Scarf Dracovish's Fishious Rend and 2HKO it back with Body Press. If this spread is being run, avoid using Heavy Slam, as Avalugg can no longer reliably beat Sylveon.</p> <p>Avalugg will be unable to beat Weakness Policy Incineroar with Body Press, which can live a Body Press and 2HKO Avalugg after Weakness Policy. Avalugg will also be unable to reliably beat Kommo-o, who will boost their Defense with Iron Defense, making Icicle Spear deal minimal damage. Magnezone and Gardevoir are Choice Item special attackers that can beat Avalugg, thanks to Magnezone's Sturdy ability and Gardevoir's Sturdy after Trace. When applicable, do not use Icicle Spear, if Avalugg has a better coverage option at its disposal, due to its multi-hit nature. This applies to Pokemon like Togekiss and Hydreigon. Non-Electroweb Chople Berry Porygon-Z involves mindgames for Avalugg, as Avalugg needs to either Mirror Coat on an attack, or Body Press on a setup move. Avalugg struggles heavily with stall Pokemon, so Pokemon like Chansey, Mandibuzz, Corviknight, Arcanine, and Slowbro should be avoided. Taunt and Trick users can be run alongside Avalugg, like both Urshifu formes and Porygon-Z, in order to cover these weaknesses.</p> "

Moonblast hits Dragon-types like Dragapult and Haxorus, Fighting-types like Kommo-o and Urshifu-S, non-Roseli Berry and Assault Vest variants of Urshifu-R, and most neutral targets such as Porygon-Z. Sparkling Aria deals with Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Salazzle, and non-Passho Berry Volcarona. Aqua Jet is used to finish off Sturdy users like Shell Smash Crustle and Sawk while also being generally useful for weakened foes such as Togekiss to avoid being hit with flinches from Air Slash. Hydro Cannon is useful for KOs that Sparkling Aria just can't quite reach, like Assault Vest Rhyperior. Energy Ball is useful against Pokemon with a 4x weakness to Grass such as non-Rindo Berry Gastrodon as well as opposing Primarina. 248 HP EVs and 148 Defense EVs allow Primarina to always survive a Choice Band-boosted Poison Jab from Haxorus, while 248 HP EVs along with 64 Special Defense EVs allow Primarina to survive a Choice Specs Hyper Beam from Porygon-Z; the rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack. An alternative spread of 248 HP / 80 Def / 40 SpA / 140 SpD with a Calm nature can also be run, which gives Primarina less defensive capabilities, only now living a Fishious Rend from Choice Band Dracovish, but now lets Primarina beat rare Uproar variants of offensive Choice Specs Porygon-Z. Torrent is the preferred ability, as it provides Primarina with situational boosts to its Water-type moves.</p> <p>Primarina will have issues with specially defensive walls such as Galarian Corsola and Snorlax, as using Assault Vest instead of a damage-boosting item prevents it from breaking down these threats due to their great natural bulk. Thus, Primarina appreciates teammates with stallbreaking capabilities, including Taunt users such as Skarmory, Haxorus, and Urshifu-S. Primarina threatens special attackers and faster Taunt users for Skarmory, bulky Dragon-types for Haxorus, and Fighting- and Fairy-types for Urshifu-S. Primarina also struggles with strong physical moves from many physical attackers in the metagame like Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan and Choice Band Crustle. Bear in mind that Choice Band Rhyperior often runs Speed investment, because it can afford to do so, which will allow it to beat Primarina. Physical walls like Avalugg, defensive Rotom-W, and Grassy Seed Rillaboom deals with the aforementioned threats, while Primarina handles threatening Dragon-types like Dragapult and Kommo-o for these Pokemon in return. Despite its type advantage, Primarina can't break through threats such as defensive Arcanine and Kyurem, as Arcanine utilizes Burn Up to rid itself of its Water-type weakness and follows up with Snarl and Morning Sun, while Kyurem can simply PP stall Primarina with the combination of Noble Roar and Roost. Teammates that handle these threats include options such as Urshifu-R and Fling + Swords Dance Haxorus.</p> "

Sparkling Aria is a less powerful alternate to Hydro Cannon, with its main upsides being that it doesn't have a recharge turn and can go through Substitutes. Sparkling Aria can take down the likes of Aegislash for Primarina. Moonblast is Primarina's most powerful Fairy-type move and is used to cover Dragon-types like non-Disable Dragapult, Dracovish, Haxorus, and Hydreigon. Energy Ball is a coverage move for Primarina which allows it to take on opposing Water-types for Primarina, such as non-Choice Specs Primarina, non-Thunderbolt stall Rotom-W, and Gastrodon. 248 HP and 148 Defense EVs allow Primarina to take an Poison Jab from Choice Band Haxorus and Choice Band Urshifu, while the 64 Special Defense combined with the aforementioned HP gives Primarina the bulk to take a Hyper Beam from Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Alternatively, running 96 HP and 196 Special Defense alongside 156 Special Attack with a Modest Nature allows Choice Specs Primarina to beat Porygon-Z, even if their Choice Specs is removed through Trick.

This strategy can beat Pokemon such as Dracovish, Diggersby, and Sawk. This set's main purpose is psychological warfare; its presence instills fear into the opponent at Team Preview, making the user's own picking easier. The EVs are irrelevant due to the nature of being Level 1. Endeavor is crucial in order to bring the foe to 1 HP for Togedemaru to finish it off with Toxic or Spiky Shield. Toxic is Togedemaru's main way to finish off the foe. Note that if the foe uses Counter, Toxic should be used first before Endeavor. Spiky Shield is used to finish off the foe if they rely on contact moves, such as Sawk, Durant, and Conkeldurr. This is useful because unlike Toxic, Spiky Shield cannot miss, and it protects Togedemaru from moves like Knock Off, which removes Shell Bell, and Iron Head, which can cause Togedemaru to flinch. Additionally, Spiky Shield is also used to scout for Trick or Switcheroo from common Choice-item Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Malamar. If Trick or Switcheroo is used, Encore can then be used to lock the foe into the move, allowing Togedemaru to freely use Endeavor and Toxic. Encore also allows Togedemaru to turn its matchup against Will-O-Wisp users like Arcanine into a coinflip. Berry Juice is another option over Shell Bell, allowing Togedemaru to consistently beat Counter users like Chansey while sacrificing matchups against some Sitrus Berry users like Arcanine. Alternatively, Disarming Voice can be used for its flawless accuracy and ability to hit Steel-types like non-Rock Blast Choice Band Steelix and Choice Specs Magnezone. However, Disarming Voice must be used with Shell Bell in order to bring the enemy to 1 HP. Togedemaru is completely helpless against anything that is immune to Endeavor, such as Dragapult, Galarian Corsola, and Zeraora after it uses Plasma Fists. Pokemon like Fake Tears Sylveon can help remedy this, along with beating Rest users like Type: Null and stall Rotom-W, while Togedemaru takes care of threats to Sylveon such as Dracovish and Diggersby. The FEAR strategy also gets ruined by Substitute, Encore, and Yawn users such as Volcarona, Aromatisse, and Sylveon. Choice Band Dracovish can take care of these threats as well as help with Taunt users like Corviknight and Mandibuzz that Togedemaru cannot break. In return, Togedemaru can defeat Pokemon like Sawk and non-Substitute Kyurem. Togedemaru is also weak to Pokemon that use Mold Breaker, such as Haxorus and Excadrill, so teammates like bulky Primarina can cover for them. Togedemaru in return beats Pokemon like Diggersby and Milotic for Primarina.</p> "

Clanging Scales is a STAB move for hitting Dragon-types such as Dracovish, Timid Choice item Dragapult, and Dracozolt. The fourth slot can either be Counter, used to beat Choice Band Urshifu-S and Urshifu-R, Taunt, which is used for shutting down stall Pokemon like Corviknight and Gastrodon, or Substitute, which is for walling most Sylveon variants, In this case, Soundproof grants Kommo-o immunity to Hyper Voice, although there are risks involved for variants that carry both Quick Attack and Hyper Beam. Haban Berry is used to tank other Dragon-type attacks, namely Draco Meteor from Dragapult and Outrage from Choice Band Dracovish and Choice Band Dracozolt. The HP investment is for tanking a Draco Meteor from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult, while the Special Attack investment is to ensure that Clanging Scales OHKOes non-Haban Berry Dracovish.

Kommo-o struggles to deal with Ghost-types that can't be OHKOed by Clanging Scales, Pokemon that can 2HKO it such as Aegislash, Gengar and Chandelure, as well as Psychic-types that OHKO it such as Celebi and Gardevoir. As such, Pokemon with naturally high Special Defense like Choice Band Snorlax and Choice Specs Rotom-H make for generally good partners, since they can often take a hit and then OHKO back. Kommo-o is also weak to Ice-type moves from Pokemon such as Avalugg, Galarian Darmanitan, and offensive Kyurem, so Fire- and Rock-types such as Arcanine and Crustle are good partners for Kommo-o.</p> "

To prevent this, you should use Thunderbolt against potential Trick Pokemon on turn 1. One major exception to this rule is the Cresselia matchup, where Tapu Koko should use Taunt first because Choice Scarf Cresselia does not usually run enough Speed EVs to be faster than Tapu Koko. Using Taunt on Cresselia also prevents non-Choice item variants from using Calm Mind. Outside of these matchups, blocking setup Pokemon such as Volcorona or Zapdos with Taunt or using Eerie Impulse or Iron Defense to live attacks from Volcanion and Rillaboom is the best first course of action.</p> "

Outrage is crucial to defeat Dragon-types such as Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Haxorus.

Additionally, Corviknight's access to status moves like Iron Defense and Roost lets it beat most physical threats that can't 2HKO it, such as Sawk, Golisopod, and Durant. 248 HP and 100 Defense EVs allow Corviknight to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Dracovish after Sitrus Berry and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan's Flare Blitz. 80 Special Defense, alongside the HP, lets Corviknight survive two Ice Beam from Choice Scarf Kyurem, letting Corviknight PP stall. The rest of the EVs are put into Speed, allowing Corviknight to outspeed non-Jolly Crustle and Gardevoir, if it receives a Choice Scarf through Trick. Generally, it's better to match Corviknight against physical threats that can't 2HKO it such as Crustle, Tyranitar, and Golisopod, as it can then use Iron Defense to bolster its Defense to the point where it can start to PP stall them via Pressure and use Roost to recover any incurred damage. Iron Head is Corviknight's main STAB move, and it allows Corviknight to hit Ice- and Fairy-types such as non-Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Whimsicott, and Gardevoir. Corviknight can also run Body Press, which will allow it to KO Choice Scarf Dracovish without waiting for it to run out of PP. This is expressly for the purpose of avoiding potential critical hits, and outside of this is wholly inferior to Iron Head. Corviknight can also handle Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dragapult and Choice Scarf Hydreigon through using Pressure to PP stall Fire Blast and slowly recover health until the foe struggles. An alternative spread of 56 HP / 252 Def / 200 Spe can be run in order to outspeed Modest Sylveon, avoiding Yawn and Fake Tears shenanigans, while still almost always beating Choice Scarf Dracovish. Corviknight in general can run many different Speed benchmarks, depending on what it needs to get done, which can let it beat opposing Taunt users such as bulky Mandibuzz, bulky Kommo-o, or physical threats, like Choice Band Diggersby.</p> <p>Dragon-type Pokemon such as Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Haxorus appreciate Corviknight's ability to handle Ice- and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan, and Sylveon. In return, they take advantage of the Fire- and Electric-type Pokemon that Corviknight struggles against, including Chandelure, Dracozolt, and Rotom-H. Galarian Darmanitan, in particular, pairs well with Corviknight, as it is able to check some Electric- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Choice Specs Hydreigon, and Dracozolt. In return, Corviknight can handle Pokemon like Aegislash and Crustle and threaten the aforementioned Pokemon. Corviknight appreciates Electric-type Pokemon such as Dracozolt and Rotom-W, as they can handle Water-type Pokemon such as Dracovish and Inteleon, which Corviknight struggles to beat. On the other hand, the same Electric-types, benefit from Corviknight's typing and ability to defeat many Ground-types that would otherwise give them trouble, such as Rhyperior and Excadrill.</p> "

Maximum Attack is run to OHKO Chansey. Special Defense can be invested into Dracovish in order to lure in and beat bulky non-Choice Specs Primarina. It will require heavy investment with a Careful nature, and matchups against certain Pokemon will have to be sacrificed to gain good odds against bulky Primarina. For example, one can run a spread of 176 Atk / 196 SpD / 136 with a Careful nature, which has the Attack investment needed to OHKO Snorlax, and the Speed necessary to outspeed Sylveon, or a spread of 148 Atk / 196 SpD / 164 Spe with a Careful nature, which outspeeds uninvested Arcanine and has the Attack investment for Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan. Be aware that Dracovish won't be able to beat the rarer, more offensive variants of Primarina.</p> <p>Fishious Rend is notable for being able to beat Aegislash, which can normally beat physical attackers with King's Shield, and Primarina, given the appropriate Special Defense investment. Despite being Fire-types, faster Arcanine variants and Substitute Volcarona beat Dracovish, either by losing its Fire typing through Burn Up, knocking Dracovish out with Outrage, or activating Swarm and Petaya Berry and OHKOing with Bug Buzz. Sturdy Pokemon are usually slower than Dracovish, but beat Dracovish anyway, since they avoid being OHKOed, and thus Crustle, Magnezone, and Sawk should be avoided. Galarian Corsola can beat Dracovish, despite being slower, since their access to Strength Sap and Cursed Body can heal off damage dealt until Dracovish's Fishious Rend is disabled.

Some offensive Pokemon that Dracovish can hit first with Fishious Rend or Dragon-types that don't use Haban Berry will be able to win regardless. Kyurem is naturally bulky enough to survive an Outrage with reasonable investment, Snorlax always runs large amounts of defensive investment, and Sturdy users like Crustle, Magnezone, and Sawk can all naturally avoid being OHKOed and threaten you in return. All stall Pokemon in general should be avoided, outside of Porygon2, which has no way to either threaten Dracovish or lessen damage taken, and is eventually knocked out. Fairy- and Steel-type Pokemon like Magnezone and Sylveon can be paired with Dracovish to make up for its weakness against problematic Dragon- and Fairy-type Pokemon.

It may not reflect current usage of this Pokémon.</p> <p>Boasting decent bulk, high Speed, and solid Special Attack, Spectrier uses Hex in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp and Calm Mind to beat threats such as Urshifu-R, and non-Choice Scarf Sawk. Will-O-Wisp is absolutely essential; it allows Spectrier to tank physical attackers like non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, Metagross, non-Choice Scarf Sawk, and Aggron. Calm Mind lets Spectrier defeat Naganadel and Necrozma. Taunt is a useful tool against Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, Zapdos, Maranga Berry Togekiss, and Registeel. It can also disrupt opposing Calm Mind users like Primarina. Disable is another option at Spectrier’s disposal, being able to beat Choice item users one-on-one such as Choice Specs Volcanion, Choice Band Landorus-T while providing better reliability against Choice Scarf Haxorus and Choice Scarf Heatran. However, forgoing Taunt will mean that Spectrier now loses to stall Pokemon like Zapdos and Maranga Berry Togekiss.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>212 EVs in HP and 16 EVs in Special Defense allow Spectrier to handle Choice Specs Necrozma by letting it tank two Photon Geysers after a Calm Mind boost and Sitrus Berry heal. 184 EVs in Speed and a Timid nature let Spectrier outspeed and beat Naganadel. The rest of the EVs are invested in Defense to better tank attacks like Choice Band Garchomp's Outrage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Spectrier can defeat strategies based on Endure + Custap Berry used by Pokemon like Primarina, Aggron, and Sawk, as a Will-O-Wisp burn will ensure that these Pokemon are KOed even if they use Endure. Thus, against all aforementioned Pokemon, you should use Will-O-Wisp. However, Primarina will still win against Spectrier if Moonblast does drop Spectrier's Special Attack after a Calm Mind. There are some situations where Spectrier needs to use Calm Mind or another move to win. Against Necrozma, use Calm Mind first to ensure that Choice Specs-boosted Prismatic Laser doesn't OHKO Spectrier, and then 2HKO back with Hex. Kartana is beat by using Will-O-Wisp followed by Hex. Against Cresselia, Spectrier should use Taunt first; this helps prevent its slower Choice Scarf set from using Trick and beating Spectrier with Psychic, in addition to preventing its stall set from using Calm Mind. Be aware that Life Orb Rillaboom wins against Spectrier by using Grassy Glide followed by Wood Hammer, as boosted Hex will not OHKO Rillaboom, and offensive Grassy Seed variants with Knock Off also beat Spectrier. Choice Scarf users like Kartana and Galarian Darmanitan are often problematic, as they can land a attack before Spectrier can use Will-O-Wisp or Calm Mind.</p> "
