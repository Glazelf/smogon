        "description": "<p>Arcanine can use its powerful Fire-type STAB moves against many top threats in the metagame such as non-Occa Berry Whimsicott, Galarian Darmanitan, and Corviknight. In addition to this, its fantastic ability in Intimidate makes its good physical bulk better, allowing it to even face foes that can hit it super effectively such as Haxorus and Choice Scarf Excadrill. Flare Blitz is Arcanine's STAB move of choice, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Excadrill. Close Combat can help with handling and OHKOing Normal-, Rock-, and Dark-types such as Choice Specs Porygon-Z, Tyranitar, and non-Choice Specs Hydreigon, while Play Rough lets you OHKO Urshifu-S while still being able to OHKO non-Choice Specs Hydreigon. Outrage is useful for the plethora of Dragon-types in 1v1 such as Haxorus, Dracovish, and Dragapult, assuming they aren't holding a Haban Berry. Extreme Speed gives Arcanine a guaranteed matchup against Choice Scarf Togekiss as Arcanine 3HKOes with priority whilst Togekiss can only 3HKO back but lacks priority itself. Wild Charge can also be used for a better matchup against non-bulky Gyarados. The given HP and Special Defense investment allows Arcanine to avoid the OHKO from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor. The given Speed investment outspeeds Timid Choice Specs Porygon-Z. You can also use a simple spread with maximum Attack and Speed investment, which lets you OHKO non-bulky Urshifu-S with Close Combat at the cost of the Choice Specs Dragapult matchup.</p> <p>Water-types like bulky Assault Vest or Chilan Berry Primarina or Azumarill are great teammates due to their great coverage against Rock- and Ground-types like Crustle and Rhyperior. In return, Arcanine covers for Grass-types such as Rillaboom, Celebi and non-Occa Berry Whimsicott. In addition to this, Grass-types such as Rillaboom cover Arcanine's weaknesses in Rock-, Ground- and Water-types such as Rhyperior and Gastrodon, and Arcanine in return covers for some of their weaknesses such as Bug-types like Durant and certain opposing Grass-types like Venusaur.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Arcanine is an excellent physical wall that can also counter some special attackers like Magnezone, Chandelure, and Aegislash. Intimidate combined with Arcanine's defensive utility in Will-O-Wisp and Burn Up lets it take physical hits from the likes of Galarian Darmanitan, non-Swords Dance Haxorus, and Choice Band Crustle. Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple physical attackers such as Diggersby as well as Sawk and Avalugg while also breaking their Sturdy. Arcanine uses Morning Sun to deal with Pokemon that may otherwise overwhelm it, like Choice Band Haxorus and Golisopod. Burn Up KOes Pokemon like Galarian Darmanitan and offensive Rillaboom and also removes Arcanine's Fire typing so that it is no longer weak to Rock-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks, which proves to be useful in matchups against non-Lum Berry Crustle, non-Swords Dance Rhyperior, and Adamant Choice Band Dracovish. Snarl is used to lower the Special Attack of Pokemon like Magnezone, Galarian Weezing, and Chandelure. Flamethrower deals consistent damage against threats Arcanine needs to hit more than once such as defensive Rillaboom, Taunt Zeraora, and Corviknight. Sitrus Berry gives Arcanine a source of immediate recovery to aid it in dealing with Choice Band Mold Breaker Haxorus and Assault Vest Kyurem so that it doesn't get knocked out after the first hit. Maximum Defense investment alongside 72 HP EVs with a Bold nature allows Arcanine to survive a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake from Jolly Galarian Darmanitan. 136 Speed EVs ensure that Arcanine is faster than Modest base 80 Speed Pokemon and below, such as Choice Specs Chandelure, offensive Venusaur, and Adamant Choice Band Dracovish and Diggersby. The leftover 48 EVs are invested into Special Attack to maximize the damage of Burn Up and Snarl. When using Flamethrower over Snarl, a spread of 244 HP / 136 Def / 8 SpA / 120 Spe should be used, which ensures Arcanine will always survive a Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Beam from Modest Magnezone while still surviving an Earthquake from Jolly Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, though it comes at the expense of no longer outspeeding fully invested base 80 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>Generally, Arcanine will find itself using Will-O-Wisp against physical attackers, although there are some matchups where this isn't ideal. Against non-Lum Berry Crustle, Choice Band Dracovish, and Choice Band Diggersby, Arcanine should use Burn Up to rid itself of its Fire typing followed by Will-O-Wisp and Morning Sun; this is because Burn Up is 100% accurate and achieves the same effect of halving damage as using Will-O-Wisp would, so you don't run the risk of losing on account of a miss. Certain defensive Primarina variants, like Assault Vest, can also be beaten by Arcanine through the use of Burn Up, Snarl, and Will-O-Wisp, but because Primarina can often run numerous varying techs, Arcanine shouldn't be relied on as a Primarina answer. Will-O-Wisp is also useful against special attackers like Magnezone, since it breaks its Sturdy so that Burn Up can then KO it. Will-O-Wisp also chips down Aegislash so that Burn Up can KO it after six turns of burn damage without risking the activation of its Weakness Policy. Against Choice Specs Magnezone, Arcanine should use Snarl to both break Sturdy and ensure that Arcanine will survive any hit. Pokemon like Sylveon, Primarina, and Choice Band Snorlax appreciate Arcanine's ability to handle hyper offensive threats like Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Adamant Choice Band Dracovish, and Rillaboom. In turn, these Pokemon help cover Arcanine's weakness to specially offensive threats like opposing Primarina, Hydreigon, and Kyurem. Arcanine struggles a bit when it comes to certain Encore and Taunt users like Primarina, Aromatisse, Kommo-o, and Corviknight if not running Flamethrower, so it appreciates the assistance provided by hyper offensive Pokemon like Choice Specs Porygon-Z, Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Salazzle, and Choice Specs Gengar. In return, Arcanine helps cover their weaknesses to bulky offense and Sturdy Pokemon like Assault Vest Azumarill, non-Swords Dance Rhyperior, Magnezone, Sawk, and Avalugg.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its excellent defensive typing and great defensive stats, Slowbro is a threatening stall Pokemon in the 1v1 metagame. Its ability Oblivious helps it function as an effective PP staller, blocking Taunt from Pokemon like Corviknight, Haxorus, and Whimsicott. Iron Defense allows Slowbro to deal with physical powerhouses in the tier such as Galarian Darmanitan, Crustle, and Dracovish. Calm Mind covers Slowbro's mediocre Special Defense, which is useful against Pokemon such as Primarina and Salazzle, while also boosting the damage of Stored Power to defeat opposing stall Pokemon like Snorlax and Galarian Corsola. Slack Off allows Slowbro to heal damage taken while boosting its defensive stats. Rest is another recovery option that allows Slowbro to defeat Pokemon that use Toxic such as Chansey, but Slack Off is generally preferred to make it far less passive. Stored Power provides Slowbro with offensive capabilities that benefit from its defensive boosts, dealing with Pokemon such as Urshifu-R, Arcanine, and Kommo-o. The given EV spread with a Bold nature and the help of a Sitrus Berry is optimal for dealing with physical attackers like Haxorus and Galarian Darmanitan.</p> <p>Slowbro's main gameplan is to tank hits while setting up to improve its defensive capabilities. As such, Slowbro's passiveness leaves it vulnerable to Encore and Trick users like Primarina, Aromatisse, and Gardevoir. Against stall Rotom-W, use Calm Mind turn one, as Thunderbolt will deal less than 75% HP, activating Slowbro's Sitrus Berry. Afterwards, use Slack Off until it is around 80% health, then keep using Calm Mind and healing until Slowbro is at +3 and OHKO with Stored Power. Against any Zeraora variant, use Iron Defense immediately followed by Slack Off. From there, alternate between Slack Off and Iron Defense until Slowbro can 2HKO with Stored Power without getting 2HKOed itself. In terms of team options, Scyther is a fantastic partner to cover counters like Porygon-Z, Dragapult, Gardevoir, and Rillaboom. In return, Slowbro defeats Galarian Darmanitan and Crustle while also being extremely consistent against Zeraora. Fake Tears Sylveon is also a fantastic partner for Slowbro, due to its ability to take care of specially offensive threats like Primarina and Kyurem as well as Dark-types like Urshifu-S and Hydreigon. In return, Sylveon appreciates Slowbro handling Choice Band Crustle and Dracovish. Furthermore, Slowbro is quite slow, leaving it vulnerable to faster Pokemon like Choice Specs Porygon-Z and Rotom-H. Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Goodra are good options to alleviate that weakness.</p> "

Toxic helps dispatch threats that can heal up on Chansey such as defensive Arcanine, Roost Kyurem, and non-Rest Slowbro. Soft-Boiled helps in matchups where the foe also has recovery to maintain health while Toxic whittles them down, which is particularly useful against Quiver Dance Volcarona, although Chansey will have to play around Substitute if Volcarona is running that. While Chansey's physical bulk is not nearly as good as its special bulk, the given EV investment allows for its to be as physically bulky as possible, letting it survive a hit from Choice item Haxorus, offensive Rillaboom, and Jolly Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan to OHKO them with Counter. Charm is an option over Counter to handle physical attackers that would like to set up on Chansey such as Shell Smash Crustle, Swords Dance Rhyperior, and Bulk Up Zeraora. Charm should be used to PP stall and negate boosts from the foe's setup moves to a point where any combination of Chansey's moves will win.</p> <p>Chansey is taken advantage of by Choice item attackers with Trick such as Rotom-H, Porygon-Z, and Gengar. Toxic can assist in dealing certain anti-stall measures such as Aromatisse and Fake Tears Sylveon; Chansey should use it before they are able to overly debilitate it with support moves like Encore + Disable and Fake Tears. Good teammates for Chansey are attackers that don't care about Trick and are able to retaliate, such as Choice Specs Magnezone and Choice Band Snorlax. Chansey also doesn't appreciate faster Taunt users such as Grassy Seed Rillaboom and Skarmory, as they PP stall Chansey and slowly chip it down.

        "description": "<p>This Snorlax set serves as a semi-stall Pokemon that beats many of the offensive threats in the 1v1 metagame, such as Galarian Darmanitan, Primarina, and non-Fling Choice item Haxorus. Counter deals with prominent physical attackers like offensive Rillaboom, non-Swords Dance Rhyperior, and Life Orb + three attacks Zeraora as well as Choice Band users such as Crustle and Azumarill. Amnesia utilizes Snorlax's fantastic Special Defense, which allows it to wall common Choice Specs users such as Magnezone, Sylveon, and Kyurem as well as miscellaneous specially oriented threats such as Salazzle and Volcarona. Snorlax also has access to many different coverage options that are interchangeable based on what its teammates are. Rock Tomb prevents Snorlax from being bait for Encore and Taunt users such as Primarina and Mandibuzz while also providing utility against Fire-types such as Choice item Rotom-H, Chandelure, and Volcarona. Defense Curl allows Snorlax to maximize its PP and fully commit to being a hard stall Pokemon, which helps secure the matchups against stall Kyurem and opposing non-Defense Curl Snorlax. Tackle allows it to maximize its PP while still being able to defeat other stall Pokemon such as Type: Null and Amnesia Slowbro. Double-Edge allows Snorlax to both beat certain Trick users such as Choice item Rotom-A and Choice Scarf Gardevoir while also inflicting recoil damage, which allows it to use Rest to maximize PP preservation. 252 HP and 252 Defense EVs along with an Impish nature allow Snorlax to have the best chance at taking a Choice Band-boosted Fishious Rend from Dracovish, and the extra 4 EVs are dumped into Special Defense. A Chople Berry allows Snorlax to take Fighting-type hits that would normally beat it such as a Superpower from Galarian Darmanitan or a Choice Band-boosted Close Combat from Conkeldurr.</p> <p>Overall, Snorlax is a straightforward Pokemon to use. However, there are a couple interesting matchups where setting up or clicking Counter immediately isn't optimal. Primarina is a good example of where you shouldn't immediately use Amnesia turn one. For Rock Tomb variants in matchups against Primarina and other known Encore or Taunt users, it is best to click Rock Tomb until Snorlax outspeeds the foe to prevent the opponent from locking Snorlax into Amnesia with Encore or disabling its setup moves with Taunt. Snorlax often struggles with setup Pokemon like Swords Dance Haxorus, Iron Defense Kommo-o, and Belly Drum Alolan Marowak as well as non-Choice item Fighting-types or ones that have a way to survive Counter like Reversal Hawlucha and Sturdy Sawk. Because of this, it often pairs well with Fairy-types such as Aqua Jet Primarina and bulky Quick Attack Sylveon. They are also able to take care of a lot of the counters like Urshifu-R and Sawk that normally beat Snorlax. Other good partners for Snorlax would include stallbreakers like Hex Dragapult and Choice item Rotom-A, both of which are able to deal with Pokemon that can outstall Snorlax such as Corviknight and Spite Galarian Corsola.</p> "

Giga Impact OHKOes neutral targets such as non-Stall Rotom-A. Its coverage options in Heavy Slam and Superpower hit Pokemon such as Sylveon, Porygon-Z, Hydreigon, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage.

Heat Wave can win against Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Genesect while also dealing super effective damage to threats such as Taunt Rillaboom and Metal Sound Magnezone. Hurricane can be used to deal with Urshifu-S but is unreliable and comes at the cost of having a shakier matchup versus Regieleki.

STAB Play Rough and Liquidation enable it to defeat Dragon- and Fire-types such as Haxorus, Kommo-o, and Volcarona. Aqua Jet gives Azumarill a way to pick off weakened foes like Choice item Rotom-H, Sawk, and Gardevoir. Superpower is an extremely important move in order to deal with Choice item Porygon-Z. The given EV spread ensures Azumarill will survive a Hyper Beam from Modest Choice Specs Porygon-Z and tank a Poison Jab from Jolly Choice Band Haxorus and Adamant Choice Band Urshifu-S. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack to maximize damage output. Alternatively, 132 HP / 124 Atk / 252 Def EVs with an Adamant nature let Azumarill survive a Choice Band Rock Wrecker from Crustle, but you lose the special bulk necessary to handle Choice Specs Porygon-Z. Since this alternative spread only defeats Choice Scarf Porygon-Z sets, Superpower becomes less of a necessity, meaning it can be replaced with Knock Off or Bulldoze instead, allowing Azumarill to defeat Substitute + Disable Dragapult or Magnezone.</p> <p>While Porygon-Z looks manageable at first glance with the help of Assault Vest, it sometimes runs a defensive Chople Berry set, utilizing Superpower's Attack drop to freely Recover and use Nasty Plot to reach +4 and OHKO Azumarill. Against Choice Band Sawk, it is best to use Aqua Jet turn one and then Play Rough, as it is likely that it is running Counter and will KO you if you use Play Rough, but there is the possibility of it using Poison Jab. Situations with the same guidelines include facing Alolan Marowak and Choice Band Crustle, if using the alternative spread. Despite being bolstered by Assault Vest, there are still special threats that Azumarill should try to avoid, like Choice Specs Primarina, Magnezone, and Porygon2. Azumarill enjoys having Kyurem as a partner, luring in threats such as Haxorus, Volcarona, and Urshifu-S, while Kyurem can deal with stall users like Slowbro, Mandibuzz, and Skarmory. Choice Specs Rotom-H also has great synergy with Azumarill, combating the likes of Chansey, Celebi, and Aegislash. In return, Azumarill can handle Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Kommo-o. Pokemon that can deal with physical wallbreakers pair well with Azumarill. Salazzle and Hawlucha are valued because of this, handling wallbreakers like Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Rillaboom, and Durant. In return, Azumarill can deal with Trick users like Choice item Rotom-H and Gardevoir. Due to Azumarill's mediocre Speed, it is often overwhelmed by faster Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Choice Band Diggersby. Therefore, faster Pokemon like Porygon-Z and Rillaboom pair well with it.

It should be used constantly against non-Trick Choice item Pokemon in order to heal off damage and fish for Cursed Body activations or stall until they can no longer deal significant damage. Night Shade is useful against Trick users, notably Rotom-H without much HP investment, which can be 3HKOed.

Will-O-Wisp can be used to shut down setup Pokemon like Crustle. Spite can be run in order to PP stall opposing PP stall Pokemon, like Meowstic and opposing non-Spite Galarian Corsola. The Defense investment and a Bold nature let Galarian Corsola take a Choice Band-boosted Fishious Rend from Adamant Dracovish, allowing Galarian Corsola to heal back up with Strength Sap. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense, which helps with rolls against Pokemon like Weakness Policy Aegislash. Galarian Corsola has many other benchmarks for its bulk: maximum HP and Defense maximizes Galarian Corsola's chance to beat Adamant Choice Band Dracozolt and rare four attacks Alolan Marowak. 252 HP and 148 Defense with a Bold nature can be run for Jolly Choice Band Dracozolt, while improving the Aegislash matchup further. 252 HP and 124 Special Defense is exactly what is needed to beat Aegislash, while 252 HP and 104 Special Defense with a Calm nature guarantees Galarian Corsola beats Dragapult.

In return, Galarian Corsola can handle hyper offensive threats such as Galarian Darmanitan, Sawk, and Choice Item Excadrill. Dark-types, particularly Bisharp, non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Incineroar, and Mandibuzz are also particularly threatening against Galarian Corsola, as they can hit it super effectively and often carry Knock Off, Taunt, or setup options. To aid against then, Pokemon like Choice Band Crustle, Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, and Primarina can all be used to beat the metagame's relevant Dark-types. Galarian Corsola can beat back threats like Arcanine and opposing Primarina in return. Lastly, certain Trick users like Gardevoir, Malamar, and heavily HP-invested Rotom-W can present a problem for Galarian Corsola, so Pokemon that do not mind being Tricked and can avoid the move altogether, like Excadrill and Whimsicott, can be good partners.

Scope Lens is useful versus stall Pokemon like Rotom-W, Galarian Corsola, and Slowbro, allowing Blissey to more easily score a critical hit in a longer game. A Timid nature with 216 Speed EVs allows Blissey to outspeed neutral-natured base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Primarina and Sylveon, while 52 Defense EVs let Blissey survive a Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch from Scizor and avoid the 2HKO from Corviknight's Iron Head. An alternate EV spread of 52 Def / 252 SpA / 204 Spe with a Modest nature can also be used, which improves Blissey's odds versus bulky Pokemon like Yawn Sylveon and Togekiss while hitting the same defensive benchmarks. However, the reduced Speed makes it prone to losing to Speed-invested Modest Goodra, as well as a few uncommon sets such as fast Calm Mind + Encore Primarina or fast Body Press Magnezone.</p> <p>A few special attackers are capable of defeating Blissey and therefore deserve particular note. Porygon-Z can set up with Nasty Plot and use Eerie Impulse to minimize Blissey's damage. Choice Scarf Gardevoir utilizes Trick and Disable, only losing to an inconsistent Shadow Ball Special Defense drop or critical hit. Togekiss has positive chances to win thanks to its combination of Thunder Wave and Air Slash, while Choice Specs variants can simply spam Air Slash, which is also favorable to the opponent due to flinches. Additionally, Assault Vest Goodra can easily tank Blissey's moves and whittle it down using Acid Spray. While in most matchups Blissey can safely set up with Calm Mind turn one, against faster Pokemon with Encore or Trick, like Togekiss and Chandelure, Blissey should attack to prevent the possibility of getting locked into a non-damaging move. Taunt Whimsicott requires multiple successful 50/50s on Whimsicott's end, in order to simultaneously prevent Calm Mind boosting Hyper Voice and being hit from Flamethrower too often. Blissey also finds itself susceptible to many prominent physical attackers like Galarian Darmanitan, Urshifu-R, and Haxorus. As such, Blissey appreciates the support from Pokemon that are able to deal with these threats such as Crustle, defensive Arcanine, and Primarina. Despite Blissey's stallbreaking capabilities, it struggles to break past certain stall threats such as non-Defense Curl Snorlax and Chansey, which team options such as Curse Dragapult and Urshifu-R are able to manage.</p> "

Electroweb allows it to beat opposing Sturdy Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Sawk whilst providing vital speed control against Pokemon like Eerie Impulse Porygon-Z and Dracovish. Metal Sound helps beat stall Pokemon like Type: Null and defensive Rotom-W, whilst Mirror Coat is an option to beat some special attackers Magnezone would otherwise be unable to deal with, such as opposing Choice Specs Magnezone. Magnezone's defensive investment allows it to live two Outrages from Choice Band Unnerve Haxorus and Surging Strikes from Choice Band Adamant Urshifu-R, and its Speed investment allows it to outspeed Wacan Berry Urshifu-R and Choice Band Urshifu-S after an Electroweb, alongside Speed tying other base 60 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>While Magnezone beats most Water-types, Primarina can live a Thunderbolt and beat Magnezone with Torrent-boosted Sparkling Aria into Aqua Jet. So, Magnezone should use Electroweb on Turn 1 to avoid putting Primarina into Torrent range, and only then use Thunderbolt on Turn 2 for the KO. Assault Vest variants will unfortunately be able to beat Magnezone, so avoid this matchup. Against Urshifu-R, use Electroweb Turn 1, in order to beat both the common Choice Band variant and the viable Wacan Berry set, followed up by Thunderbolt. Be aware that the rare Choice Scarf Urshifu-R will require a Turn 1 Thunderbolt and will beat Magnezone if it uses Electroweb instead. While the Choice Band Rillaboom matchup seems cut and dry, Rillaboom can usually beat Magnezone without activating Weakness Policy by simply using Wood Hammer. Your opponent will have to misplay and assume a Choice Specs set. To prepare for this, always use Electroweb on the off chance that they do mispredict and use Superpower or High Horsepower. Magnezone struggles against Dragon-types such as Curse Dragapult, Mold Breaker Haxorus, Choice Scarf Dracovish, and Kommo-o. Because of this, Fairy-type partners such as Primarina and Sylveon are appreciated. They in turn enjoy Magnezone's support to deal with physical breakers such as Galarian Darmanitan and Crustle. Dragon-types such as Choice Scarf Unnerve Haxorus and Haban Berry Kommo-o are also good team options for Magnezone, being able to deal with the aforementioned Dragon-type threats that Magnezone cannot break through. In return, Magnezone beats Fairy-types like Sylveon and Aromatisse. Despite making use of Metal Sound, Magnezone is unable to KO Chansey in the 4 turns that it uses Seismic Toss. Teammates that can deal with Chansey include Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R, Urshifu-S, Sawk, and Conkeldurr, all of which subsequently appreciate Magnezone's ability to deter Fairy-types.</p> "

An anti-Choice Specs Magnezone set can also be used, with 72 HP EVs and 244 Special Defense EVs alongside a Careful nature guaranteeing survival against Choice Specs-boosted Flash Cannon.

Nasty Plot boosts Porygon-Z's Special Attack to astronomical levels, letting it power through walls like Arcanine, Chansey, Corviknight, and Slowbro. Hyper Beam is Porygon-Z's strongest STAB move and can OHKO certain Pokemon without a boost, such as non-Unnerve Haxorus and Rillaboom. Eerie Impulse, when used with Recover, allows Porygon-Z to break through Primarina and Choice Specs Magnezone. 132 EVs in HP and 252 EVs in Defense alongside Chople Berry allow Porygon-Z to survive a Close Combat from Choice Band Urshifu-R, with Bold beating Adamant variants and Modest only beating Jolly variants, as well as an Outrage from Choice Band Mold Breaker Haxorus. 72 EVs in Speed are run to outspeed non-Jolly Corviknight as well as Pokemon like Choice Specs Modest Magnezone and bulky Rillaboom. The rest is put into Special Attack to maximize damage output. Alternatively, Porygon-Z can run Electroweb instead of Eerie Impulse and a spread of 92 HP / 252 Def / 28 SpA / 136 Spe to beat Choice Band Sawk and Avalugg while outspeeding Choice Band Adamant Dracovish. Another spread it can use is 184 HP / 248 Def / 32 SpA / 44 Spe with Speed Swap and Uproar replacing Eerie Impulse and Recover to reliably defeat Zeraora, stall Rotom-A, and Substitute users like Whimsicott.</p> <p>You want to think carefully when using this Porygon-Z set, as it has many matchups requiring specific play. Against Primarina, Porygon-Z should always use Eerie Impulse immediately to survive the possible Choice Specs Hydro Cannon. If it is an Assault Vest or Chilan Berry variant, Porygon-Z only needs to use Eerie Impulse until it's at -4, heal off damage taken shortly afterwards, Nasty Plot till at least +4, and OHKO with Hyper Beam. To figure out whether the Primarina is Choice Specs or not, if -2 Hydro Cannon deals 58% of damage or more against the standard EV spread, that indicates that it is using Choice Specs, so you can end the battle after one use of Nasty Plot instead of two. Against Choice Specs Magnezone, the same process comes into play; however, you do not need to set up with Nasty Plot, as Hyper Beam 2HKOes. Against stall Arcanine, use Nasty Plot once, as +1 Hyper Beam OHKOes even if they use Snarl. Usually, you will use Hyper Beam first against particular Pokemon that aren't naturally specially defensive, such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and non-Unnerve Choice Band Haxorus. Porygon-Z appreciates Chilan Berry Primarina as a partner, which handles wallbreakers like opposing Choice item Porygon-Z, Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, and Shell Smash Crustle. In return, Porygon-Z can deal with specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Slowbro, and Goodra. Porygon-Z is relatively frail even with this set's bulkier spread and cannot take many hits; thus, bulkier partners such as Magnezone and Arcanine are appreciated. Having partners that can take on Ghost-types like Dragapult, Galarian Corsola, and Gengar is imperative, as Porygon-Z has no moves capable of hitting them. Dark-types like Mandibuzz and Taunt Incineroar help alleviate this weakness. In return, Porygon-Z can handle one of their biggest issues: Urshifu-R.</p> "

Hyper Beam OHKOes threats like Togekiss, Sylveon, and Arcanine. Trick is mainly used against typical stall-oriented Pokemon such as Torment Skarmory, Chansey, and Galarian Corsola to lock them into one move, allowing Porygon-Z to set up with Nasty Plot and KO them once boosted, barring Galarian Corsola which will be PP stalled because Porygon-Z cannot touch it without Dark Pulse. Dark Pulse is able to defeat Alolan Marowak and non-Focus Blast Choice Scarf Gengar, Dark Pulse can also hit Ghost-types, which Hyper Beam can't touch, in specific Galarian Corsola and Alolan Marowak. Uproar can be used over Dark Pulse on lower Special Attack set's to 2HKO non-Mirror Coat Magnezone and Whimsicott. The given EVs allow Porygon-Z to survive Grassy Glide from Choice Band Rillaboom and outspeed non-Choice Scarf Dracozolt and Dracovish, as well as OHKO Alolan-Marowak. An alternative EV spread of 144 HP / 60 Def / 72 SpA / 232 Spe with a Modest nature can be run in order to survive Choice Scarf Chandelure and Modest Scarf Draco Meteor from Hydreigon. However, the drop in Special Attacker makes the Alolan-Marowak match up unreliable, and can hurt with rolls against particularly bulky threats, like uninvested Snorlax. Another EV spread of 4 HP / 200 Def / 72 SpA / 232 Spe can be used to beat Life Orb Rillaboom. Lastly, Porygon-Z can use a spread of 144 HP / 60 Def / 96 SpA / 208 Spe or 148 Def / 152 SpA / 208 Spe with the nature Timid to out speed Adamant Haxorus and Urshifu, alongside doing all that you did before, depending on which one you use. Choice Specs Porygon-Z in general can sacrifice investment in either bulk, power, or speed to beat or get close to beating specific threats, like Excadrill, or fully invest in Speed to speed tie other non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Generally, due to the power Choice Specs gives to Porygon-Z, it has a lot more room to invest in either overwhelming offense or bulk.</p> <p>Trick should be used immediately against Pokemon such as Skarmory, Chansey, Galarian Corsola, and Crustle. Against Skarmory, simply rotate between Hyper Beam and Recover if they're running a damaging move; if you lock them into a status move, simply click Hyper Beam twice. Against Chansey, use Trick followed by Nasty Plot twice to get to +4 and then OHKO with Hyper Beam. Against Galarian Corsola, simply Trick and PP stall it, as it won't have any moves that can deal damage to Porygon-Z. Similarly to Galarian Corsola, Porygon-Z needs to PP stall Crustle. Regardless of what item you receive back, spam Recover until the foe runs out of PP. Due to the multi-hit nature of Rock Blast, the matchup is more favorable for Crustle but is not guaranteed If Crustle goes for Shell Smash on your Trick, simply click Hyper Beam twice, as they will be Choice-locked and unable to attack. Porygon-Z struggles against Fighting-type Pokemon and Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage such as Urshifu-R, Sawk, Hawlucha, and Haxorus. Fairy-type Pokemon, specifically Primarina and Sylveon, go well with Porygon-Z, since they can cover the Fighting-type weakness whilst simultaneously appreciating Porygon-Z's ability to deal with their threats such as Chansey, Rillaboom, Rotom-H as well as Poison-types such as Toxtricity and Venusaur. Porygon-Z needs to be wary of common Chilan Berry and Assault Vest users, mainly Primarina, so consider teammates such as Zeraora and Rillaboom.</p> "

Against Sawk, use Mach Punch on turns 1, to avoid being OHKOed by Counter, and either use Close Combat if they used Counter, or use another Mach Punch if they used Close Combat. Using a Guts Boosted Mach Punch against Galarian Darmanitan removes the possibility of losing to Choice Band. The given HP and Special Defense investment allows Conkeldurr to tank a Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Dragapult, and the HP and Defense EVs allow Conkeldurr to tank Choice Scarf Dracovish. A Brave nature along with 29 IVs in speed allow Conkeldurr to underspeed minimum speed Aegislash, which allows it to hit it with a Guts-boosted Knock Off in its Blade forme. Guts and Flame Orb also have some defensive capabilities. Notably, Guts allows Conkeldurr to beat stall Rotom-A because it can ignore Will-O-Wisp, which is key to their defensive capabilities.</p> <p>Conkeldurr works well with Steel-type Pokemon such as Excadrill and Steelix that can defeat its Fairy-type counters such as Sylveon and Togekiss. In return, Conkeldurr can beat opposing Snorlax and Rotom-W. Conkeldurr also struggles with especially strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Dracovish and Choice Band Dracozolt. Because of this, Pokemon such as Crustle and Strength Sap Galarian Corsola that can survive their attacks make good teammates. In return, Conkeldurr can beat many Steel-types such as Duraludon, and strong offensive Pokemon such as Choice Specs Dragapult. It also appreciates teammates such as Incineroar who can beat Psychic-types such as Gardevoir. In return, Conkeldurr can beat many Steel- and Ground-types such as Excadrill, Steelix, and Choice Band Bisharp.</p> "

Poison Jab is helpful for beating Fairy-types, mainly Togekiss and non-Kebia Berry Whimsicott. Earthquake helps beat non-Fake Out Zeraora and Toxtricity.

        "description": "<p>Whimsicott’s ability Prankster, along with the combination of Leech Seed, Substitute, and Protect, allows it to Leech Seed stall most non-Leech Seed-immune Pokemon, given that it can survive an attack. Protect and Substitute are essential to make the most of Leech Seed recovery, while Protect has the added bonus of being used to scout for moves such as Trick and Taunt, with Prankster Substitute and Taunt serving to neutralize those threats respectively. Taunt also serves the purpose of preventing the use of recovery from opposing Pokemon such as Galarian Corsola and stall Snorlax with the option of Moonblast to help against Pokemon that otherwise beat Whimsicott, such as Urshifu-S, Mandibuzz, and Grass-types such as Rillaboom and opposing Whimsicott. Occa Berry alongside 248 HP EVs, 152 Defense EVs, and a Bold nature allows Whimsicott to always survive Alolan Marowak's Flare Blitz and Choice Specs Rotom-H's Overheat at -2. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Defense for maximum special bulk. Babiri Berry is another option, allowing Whimsicott to set up on Steel-types such as Aegislash and Magnezone. If Babiri Berry is used, an alternative spread of 248 HP / 140 Def / 120 SpD is required to survive against the aforementioned Steel-types, as well as Moonblast from Choice Specs Primarina.</p> <p>When using Whimsicott, most positive matchups are won by using Leech Seed Turn 1 and alternating between clicking Protect and Substitute. If you survive the first hit, Leech Seed stalling with Protect into Substitute will usually let you regain around 25% every two turns, allowing you to avoid all damage behind a Protect or a Prankster Substitute until the foe has lost its HP. Protect should always be used immediately to scout for Trick from common Choice-item Pokemon such as Rotom-H and Togekiss. If Rotom-H uses Overheat instead of Trick, using Substitute twice on Overheat followed by Leech Seed is optimal to minimize Whimsicott's chance of losing to poor RNG. It should also be noted that Gardevoir is an outlier, as it is a Choice item Trick user that is able to defeat Whimsicott due to Trace, which allows for a Prankster Trick. Whimsicott primarily struggles with Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed, so Fire-types such as Arcanine and Incineroar make great partners. Whimsicott, in return, helps with their weak matchups against Water-types such as Primarina and Dracovish. Whimsicott also struggles with Ice-types and Dark-types not weak to Moonblast such as Avalugg, Galarian Darmanitan, and Incineroar, making Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and Sawk great partners.

Additionally, Haxorus's access to high-Base Power moves like Outrage, Poison Jab, Close Combat, Aqua Tail, and Earthquake allows it to cover a variety of different threats in the metagame like Choice Band Dracovish, Whimsicott, all formes of Rotom, Whimsicott, Rhyperior, and Tyranitar. Generally, Haxorus should avoid other Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Darmanitan, Dracovish, and Togekiss, as they are all faster than it and can use their respective moves to take it out. It also should avoid bulky Pokemon like Corviknight, as it will lose easily.</p> <p>Bulky Pokemon like Sylveon, Vaporeon, and Tyranitar are helpful when handling fast Choice Scarf attackers like Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Togekiss.

Steel-types like Aegislash and Choice Scarf Durant help handle common Fairy-types like Sylveon and Togekiss. In return, Haxorus can handle the Ground-types that hinder them such as Excadrill, Choice Band Diggersby, and Steelix. Fire-types such as Chandelure and Arcanine are useful in handling the same Steel-type Pokemon like Corviknight and Aegislash.

Dark Pulse is for hitting Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Chandelure and non-Dazzling Gleam Celebi. Nasty Plot allows for Hydreigon to boost its Special Attack, letting it break through bulkier Pokemon such as Type: Null, Aegislash, Galarian Corsola, and Silvally. Taunt allows for Hydreigon to break down bulkier Pokemon that rely on setting up, namely stall Snorlax and Gastrodon, whereas Fire Blast is coverage for Steel-types such as Bisharp, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn. Focus Blast can be run in order to OHKO Choice Band Diggersby, alongside most of the Steel-types mentioned, but is generally less reliable. Haban Berry is to tank other Dragon-type attacks such as Draco Meteor from Dragapult and Outrage from both Choice Scarf Dracovish and Dracozolt. The EVs are for tanking Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Dragapult and Low Kick from Adamant Dracozolt. 212 Speed EVs allow Hydreigon to outspeed Braviary.

Porygon-Z sometimes only runs Normal-type coverage, in which case Aegislash autowins, but Aegislash will fall to a combo of Trick into Shadow Ball or Dark Pulse. King's Shield is unfortunately only marginally effective at beating threatening contact Pokemon. Both Urshifu-S and Urshifu-R have the ability Unseen Fist, which ignores King's Shield, and physical Fire-types like Darmanitan, Incineroar, Centiskorch, and Alolan Marowak can avoid bypass King's Shield with their moves or abilities. King's Shield will also prove ineffective against monstrous physical powerhouses, like Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Dracovish, and Dracozolt, though the former can be beaten if Aegislash uses King's Shield twice. Despite being super effective against Ghost Pokemon, Aegislash will lose against all Ghost-type Pokemon except Choice item Dragapult. If Aegislash is undersped by a Pokemon, it will be helpless defensively, and will often lose even against Pokemon it can hit super effectively, like Choice Band Avalugg and Crustle, Snorlax, Steelix, and Rhyperior. Among Rock- and Ice-types, only Shell Smash Crustle, Terrakion, Eiscue, Alolan Ninetales, and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan are relevant targets - the others, like Tyranitar and Kyurem, can win with their specific attributes. Aegislash has absolutely no stallbreaking ability, and thus all stall Pokemon should be avoided, outside of Slowbro, which can be KOed.

Torrent is the preferred ability, as it provides Primarina with situational boosts to its Water-type moves.</p> <p>Primarina will have issues with specially defensive walls such as Galarian Corsola and Snorlax, as using Assault Vest instead of a damage-boosting item prevents it from breaking down these threats due to their great natural bulk. Thus, Primarina appreciates teammates with stallbreaking capabilities, including Taunt users such as Skarmory, Haxorus, and Urshifu-S. Primarina threatens special attackers and faster Taunt users for Skarmory, bulky Dragon-types for Haxorus, and Fighting- and Fairy-types for Urshifu-S. Primarina also struggles with strong physical moves from many physical attackers in the metagame like Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan and Choice Band Crustle. Bear in mind that Choice Band Rhyperior often runs Speed investment, because it can afford to do so, which will allow it to beat Primarina. Physical walls like Avalugg, defensive Rotom-W, and Grassy Seed Rillaboom deals with the aforementioned threats, while Primarina handles threatening Dragon-types like Dragapult and Kommo-o for these Pokemon in return. Despite its type advantage, Primarina can't break through threats such as defensive Arcanine and Kyurem, as Arcanine utilizes Burn Up to rid itself of its Water-type weakness and follows up with Snarl and Morning Sun, while Kyurem can simply PP stall Primarina with the combination of Noble Roar and Roost. Teammates that handle these threats include options such as Urshifu-R and Fling + Swords Dance Haxorus.</p> "

Hydro Cannon, boosted with Choice Specs, can OHKO many threats such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, physically defensive Corviknight, Incineroar, and Arcanine. Sparkling Aria is a less powerful alternate to Hydro Cannon, with its main upsides being that it doesn't have a recharge turn and can go through Substitutes. Sparkling Aria can take down the likes of Aegislash for Primarina. Moonblast is Primarina's most powerful Fairy-type move and is used to cover Dragon-types like non-Disable Dragapult, Dracovish, Haxorus, and Hydreigon. Energy Ball is a coverage move for Primarina which allows it to take on opposing Water-types for Primarina, such as non-Choice Specs Primarina, non-Thunderbolt stall Rotom-W, and Gastrodon. 248 HP and 148 Defense EVs allow Primarina to take an Poison Jab from Choice Band Haxorus and Choice Band Urshifu, while the 64 Special Defense combined with the aforementioned HP gives Primarina the bulk to take a Hyper Beam from Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Alternatively, running 96 HP and 196 Special Defense alongside 156 Special Attack with a Modest Nature allows Choice Specs Primarina to beat Porygon-Z, even if their Choice Specs is removed through Trick. A spread of 252 HP / 232 Def / 20 SpA / 4 SpD with a Bold Nature can be run in order to survive a Rock Wrecker from Choice Band Crustle.</p> <p>Bulky Pokemon with Mirror Coat like Milotic and Avalugg take out Primarina with ease, so teammates that can counteract those Pokemon like Sylveon and Taunt Whimsicott make good partners for Primarina. In return for these teammates, Primarina can take down Steel-types that these are weak to like Corviknight and Excadrill. Primarina is also stopped in its tracks by Grass-types like Celebi, Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, Venusaur, and Whimsicott, so Fire-types like Arcanine and Salazzle can make good partners for Primarina, also allowing there to be a potential Fire / Water / Grass core. In return, Primarina can take out Water-types with its Energy Ball, such as Blastoise, non-Choice Specs Primarina, and Gastrodon. Primarina also loses Electric-types like Zeraora, Dracozolt, and Toxtricity, so Ground-types like Rhyperior and Choice Scarf Diggersby and Pokemon with Ground-type coverage like Conkeldurr and Choice Scarf Haxorus make good teammates for Primarina. In return, Primarina can take on Pokemon for the Ground-types like Blastoise, non-Choice Specs Primarina, Gastrodon, and Galarian Darmanitan. Stall Pokemon that can take advantage of Primarina like Galarian Corsola and Type: Null pose a threat to it, so wallbreakers like Taunt Corviknight and Incineroar are good teammates for Primarina. In return, Primarina can take down Choice Band Dracovish, Choice Scarf Rotom-H, and Keldeo for these teammates.</p> "

This strategy can beat Pokemon such as Dracovish, Diggersby, and Sawk. This set's main purpose is psychological warfare; its presence instills fear into the opponent at Team Preview, making the user's own picking easier. The EVs are irrelevant due to the nature of being Level 1. Endeavor is crucial in order to bring the foe to 1 HP for Togedemaru to finish it off with Toxic or Spiky Shield. Toxic is Togedemaru's main way to finish off the foe. Note that if the foe uses Counter, Toxic should be used first before Endeavor. Spiky Shield is used to finish off the foe if they rely on contact moves, such as Sawk, Durant, and Conkeldurr. This is useful because unlike Toxic, Spiky Shield cannot miss, and it protects Togedemaru from moves like Knock Off, which removes Shell Bell, and Iron Head, which can cause Togedemaru to flinch. Additionally, Spiky Shield is also used to scout for Trick or Switcheroo from common Choice-item Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Malamar. If Trick or Switcheroo is used, Encore can then be used to lock the foe into the move, allowing Togedemaru to freely use Endeavor and Toxic. Encore also allows Togedemaru to turn its matchup against Will-O-Wisp users like Arcanine into a coinflip. Berry Juice is another option over Shell Bell, allowing Togedemaru to consistently beat Counter users like Chansey while sacrificing matchups against some Sitrus Berry users like Arcanine. Alternatively, Disarming Voice can be used for its flawless accuracy and ability to hit Steel-types like non-Rock Blast Choice Band Steelix and Choice Specs Magnezone. However, Disarming Voice must be used with Shell Bell in order to bring the enemy to 1 HP. Togedemaru is completely helpless against anything that is immune to Endeavor, such as Dragapult, Galarian Corsola, and Zeraora after it uses Plasma Fists. Pokemon like Fake Tears Sylveon can help remedy this, along with beating Rest users like Type: Null and stall Rotom-W, while Togedemaru takes care of threats to Sylveon such as Dracovish and Diggersby. The FEAR strategy also gets ruined by Substitute, Encore, and Yawn users such as Volcarona, Aromatisse, and Sylveon. Choice Band Dracovish can take care of these threats as well as help with Taunt users like Corviknight and Mandibuzz that Togedemaru cannot break. In return, Togedemaru can defeat Pokemon like Sawk and non-Substitute Kyurem. Togedemaru is also weak to Pokemon that use Mold Breaker, such as Haxorus and Excadrill, so teammates like bulky Primarina can cover for them. Togedemaru in return beats Pokemon like Diggersby and Milotic for Primarina.</p> "

These two moves allow Kommo-o to wall and takedown threats like Crustle, Rotom-W, and Snorlax. Clanging Scales is a STAB move for hitting Dragon-types such as Dracovish, Timid Choice item Dragapult, and Dracozolt. The fourth slot can either be Counter, used to beat Choice Band Urshifu-S and Urshifu-R, Taunt, which is used for shutting down stall Pokemon like Corviknight and Gastrodon, or Substitute, which is for walling most Sylveon variants, In this case, Soundproof grants Kommo-o immunity to Hyper Voice, although there are risks involved for variants that carry both Quick Attack and Hyper Beam. Haban Berry is used to tank other Dragon-type attacks, namely Draco Meteor from Dragapult and Outrage from Choice Band Dracovish and Choice Band Dracozolt. The HP investment is for tanking a Draco Meteor from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult, while the Special Attack investment is to ensure that Clanging Scales OHKOes non-Haban Berry Dracovish. The Speed investment is to outspeed Adamant Choice Band Diggersby and the rest is dumped into Defense with a Bold nature to maximize defensive and offensive capabilities. An alternative EV spread of 200 HP / 84 Def / 224 SpD with a Bold nature can be run in order to survive a Choice Scarf Hyper Beam from Porygon-Z, with the leftover EVs invested into Defense to maximize Body Press' power.</p> <p>Kommo-o's typing makes it extremely weak to Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Primarina, and Aromatisse. Steel- and Poison-types such as Durant, Togedemaru, and Silvally-Poison are good teammates since they can deal with these threats. Kommo-o is a good partner for Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight, as it covers their weakness to Fire- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Incineroar and Conkeldurr. Kommo-o struggles to deal with Ghost-types that can't be OHKOed by Clanging Scales, Pokemon that can 2HKO it such as Aegislash, Gengar and Chandelure, as well as Psychic-types that OHKO it such as Celebi and Gardevoir. As such, Pokemon with naturally high Special Defense like Choice Band Snorlax and Choice Specs Rotom-H make for generally good partners, since they can often take a hit and then OHKO back. Kommo-o is also weak to Ice-type moves from Pokemon such as Avalugg, Galarian Darmanitan, and offensive Kyurem, so Fire- and Rock-types such as Arcanine and Crustle are good partners for Kommo-o.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Tapu Koko has a niche in 1v1 due to its ability to disrupt opposing Pokemon utilizing its useful status moves with its quick Speed. It gets access to reliable recovery in the form of Roost, which is essential to staying alive long enough to whittle down foes using Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt is usually used once foes can no longer damage Tapu Koko more quickly than it heals. Eerie Impulse shuts down many special attackers such as Tapu Lele, non-Choice Scarf Heatran, and Necrozma. Taunt is for a better matchup against opposing stall Pokemon, such as Registeel and Zapdos. It also stifiles setup Pokemon, like Nasty Plot Galarian Moltres, Fake Tears Sylveon, and Metal Sound Magnezone. With the above moves, combined with the immediate +1 Defense boost from Electric Surge and the Electric Seed, many slower Pokemon, such as Sawk and Necrozma, cannot KO it before it KOes them. Tapu Koko’s moveslots can be flexible, and some teams may require Tapu Koko to drop Taunt for Iron Defense, beating more physical threats such as Rillaboom and Avalugg.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>The Speed EVs on this set are for neutral-natured Choice Scarf Dracozolt and Dracovish. The HP investment ensures overall bulk, and the rest of the EVs are put in Special Defense, increasing the chances of Tapu Koko surviving against Choice Specs Porygon-Z and other special attackers after an Eerie Impulse.</p> <p>The Speed and Special Defense investments are customizable depending on what matchups Tapu Koko needs to cover. One such alternate option is a spread of 248 HP / 8 SpA / 156 SpD / 96 Spe with a Timid nature, which outspeeds Pokemon with base 110 Speed, such as Latios and Archeops, and survives Choice Specs Porygon-Z’s Hyper Beam after an Eerie Impulse, with the rest of the EVs put in Special Attack to maximize the chance for Thunderbolt to 2HKO Porygon-Z.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Playing with Tapu Koko can require some informed guesses about what moves and items the foe is running. Many Pokemon, like Jirachi and Togekiss, have Choice Scarf variants that run Trick, which could lock Tapu Koko into a status move. To prevent this, you should use Thunderbolt against potential Trick Pokemon on turn 1. One major exception to this rule is the Cresselia matchup, where Tapu Koko should use Taunt first because Choice Scarf Cresselia does not usually run enough Speed EVs to be faster than Tapu Koko. Using Taunt on Cresselia also prevents non-Choice item variants from using Calm Mind. Outside of these matchups, blocking setup Pokemon such as Volcorona or Zapdos with Taunt or using Eerie Impulse or Iron Defense to live attacks from Volcanion and Rillaboom is the best first course of action.</p> "

Outrage is crucial to defeat Dragon-types such as Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Haxorus.

The rest of the EVs are put into Speed, allowing Corviknight to outspeed non-Jolly Crustle and Gardevoir, if it receives a Choice Scarf through Trick. Generally, it's better to match Corviknight against physical threats that can't 2HKO it such as Crustle, Tyranitar, and Golisopod, as it can then use Iron Defense to bolster its Defense to the point where it can start to PP stall them via Pressure and use Roost to recover any incurred damage. Iron Head is Corviknight's main STAB move, and it allows Corviknight to hit Ice- and Fairy-types such as non-Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Whimsicott, and Gardevoir. Corviknight can also run Body Press, which will allow it to KO Choice Scarf Dracovish without waiting for it to run out of PP. This is expressly for the purpose of avoiding potential critical hits, and outside of this is wholly inferior to Iron Head. Corviknight can also handle Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dragapult and Choice Scarf Hydreigon through using Pressure to PP stall Fire Blast and slowly recover health until the foe struggles. An alternative spread of 56 HP / 252 Def / 200 Spe can be run in order to outspeed Modest Sylveon, avoiding Yawn and Fake Tears shenanigans, while still almost always beating Choice Scarf Dracovish. Corviknight in general can run many different Speed benchmarks, depending on what it needs to get done, which can let it beat opposing Taunt users such as bulky Mandibuzz, bulky Kommo-o, or physical threats, like Choice Band Diggersby.</p> <p>Dragon-type Pokemon such as Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Haxorus appreciate Corviknight's ability to handle Ice- and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan, and Sylveon.

Corviknight appreciates Electric-type Pokemon such as Dracozolt and Rotom-W, as they can handle Water-type Pokemon such as Dracovish and Inteleon, which Corviknight struggles to beat.

        "description": "<p>Draco Meteor is Dragapult's strongest attack and is STAB-boosted and used to KO both frail and non-Haban Berry Dragon-type Pokemon, like Dracovish and Choice Band Haxorus. Shadow Ball also receives a boost from STAB and hits Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Gengar, physically defensive Galarian Corsola, and Choice Specs Chandelure for super effective damage. Opposing Substitute + Disable Dragapult will also be threatened by Shadow Ball. Flamethrower is mostly used to hit Steel-types such as Corviknight, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn. Hydro Pump is an option that improves matchups against Arcanine and non-Assault Vest Rhyperior. Thunderbolt may be used to beat Gyarados. The given Speed EVs allow Dragapult to outspeed Pokeomon like Inteleon and Adamant Choice Scarf Diggersby, with a slight optimization to always live Choice Specs Flash Cannon from Magnezone.</p> <p>Dragapult does well on teams with walls such as Corsola, Corviknight, and Milotic, as it's able to take on many of the hardest-hitting Pokemon in the tier such as Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Dracovish, Choice Specs Hydreigon, which can brute through stall. In turn, Dragapult appreciates their ability to take on most Choice Scarf users that can outspeed it such as Hydreigon, Haxorus, and Sawk. Dragapult does not hit especially hard, so many Pokemon may run EVs to tank hits from it, such as Aegislash and Arcanine, which a Dragapult user should be aware of. Dragapult is very easy to use; with few exceptions, use the move the deals the most damage.</p> "
