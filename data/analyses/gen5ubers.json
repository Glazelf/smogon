  "Blaziken": {
    "overview": "<p>Forging new ground as the first starter Pokemon to ever become Uber, Blaziken appears to have a lot to live up to in the Uber metagame. However, it is perfectly capable of functioning well in Ubers, as thanks to Speed Boost, Blaziken will become nearly impossible to revenge kill as the boosts accumulate. Once enough boosts have been gathered, Blaziken can sweep rather easily with its sizable Attack stat and mighty dual STAB in Low Kick and Flare Blitz—the former hits the majority of the tier with 120 base power, and the latter is amped up in sunlight. These traits combine to make Blaziken nearly impossible to wall, enabling it to rip through most of the metagame with its powerful hits. Although it is frail and its STAB moves have unappealing side effects—Flare Blitz causes huge amounts of recoil damage, and Low Kick has varying base power—Blaziken is still a massive threat that needs to be considered when making a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Claw nails Giratina-O for an OHKO after Stealth Rock damage and a boost from Swords Dance, while hitting Lugia, Cresselia, Arceus-Ghost, and Arceus-Psychic for solid damage. It can therefore replace Flare Blitz, making Blaziken less weather dependent and saving it from having to take huge amounts of recoil damage. However, Shadow Claw still fails to OHKO Lugia, Cresselia, Arceus-Psychic, and Arceus-Ghost, as well as Mewtwo without a Swords Dance boost, so it is far inferior to Flare Blitz. Stone Edge hurts Lugia a lot more than Shadow Claw does, while also murdering Ho-Oh and Rayquaza, but a +2 sun-boosted Flare Blitz will usually KO them after Stealth Rock anyway, so it's not of much use. Work Up increases Blaziken's Special Attack stat as well as its Attack stat, but even with the increased Special Attack, it cannot defeat Giratina, which would be the main point in using it. Choice Band grants Blaziken more immediate power, but locking Blaziken into one attack is too restrictive for it and is counterproductive to Speed Boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Giratina is Blaziken's only real counter. Try as it might, Blaziken cannot OHKO it with any attack bar the unlikely +6 sun-boosted Flare Blitz, while Giratina can just phaze it out with Dragon Tail. Defensive variants of Giratina-O also perform a similar function, but won't take Blaziken's hits quite as effectively. If it is raining, Arceus-Psychic, Arceus-Ghost, Cresselia, Lugia, and Gliscor can all take a Flare Blitz and either phaze out Blaziken or KO it with a super effective attack. Rayquaza and Arceus can also bypass Blaziken's Speed boosts with Extreme Speed, which will cut through its low Defense like a hot knife through butter. Toxic Spikes also greatly annoy Blaziken, as the passive damage combined with Life Orb and Flare Blitz recoil will kill it off very quickly. If using High Jump Kick, both of Blaziken's STAB attacks also have a chance of inflicting recoil damage, so smart switching between Ghost-types and bulky Water- or Dragon-types will cause recoil damage to add up and eventually bring about Blaziken's demise.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance pumps up Blaziken's solid Attack stat to a frightening maximum of 734. When Speed Boost is thrown into the mix, Blaziken suddenly turns into a potent sweeper that only becomes harder and harder to revenge kill as time passes and it obtains more Speed boosts. Low Kick is Blaziken's main sweeping move: after a Swords Dance, it will OHKO all common Pokemon that do not resist it, save for the bulkiest of Groudon, which is quite an impressive feat. Protect ensures that Blaziken will obtain at least one Speed boost before sweeping, and makes up for its low initial Speed. Flare Blitz rounds out Blaziken's coverage and has the potential to be Blaziken's most powerful option by far. It gets STAB on top of its naturally high Base Power, and with sun support becomes so powerful that at +2, it can OHKO 4/0 Giratina-O after Stealth Rock damage. Considering Giratina-O resists Flare Blitz and is extremely bulky, the sheer damage output of that attack shows just how powerful Blaziken is. Shaymin-S and Mewtwo are also both OHKOed by an unboosted Flare Blitz. High Jump Kick can be used over Low Kick as it has 10 more base power, but High Jump Kick does cause 50% recoil when it misses, meaning that it is much less risky to use against teams with Ghost-types, such as a potential Arceus-Ghost.</p> <p>Blaziken cannot take any hits even with investment, so its Attack and Speed stats are fully invested in to optimize its sweeping capability. Jolly is by far the preferred nature on this set, as it allows Blaziken to outspeed Mewtwo and Shaymin-S after one Speed boost, and Choice Scarf Terrakion after two. Life Orb is the preferred item to grant Blaziken as much power as possible. However, Leftovers helps Blaziken mitigate recoil damage and survive for longer; as such, it is a better choice for Blaziken if it is being used on a stall team, where its main purpose is to check common stallbreakers such as Darkrai and Heatran. An Adamant nature can be used if running Leftovers to make up for the power loss.</p> <p>Groudon should always be used alongside Blaziken. It provides the sunlight necessary to power up Flare Blitz, and can also set up Stealth Rock, which Blaziken needs to obtain crucial KOs on Pokemon such as Lugia and Giratina-O. Groudon is also a wonderful check to Rayquaza and physical Arceus, which would otherwise destroy Blaziken with Extreme Speed, as well as Arceus-Poison, which walls Blaziken outside of sun.</p> <p>Giratina is the only Pokemon that is capable of outright walling Blaziken, as it cannot come close to OHKOing Giratina, while Giratina can either force Blaziken out of the battlefield with Dragon Tail, or just KO it outright with Outrage. Defensive Giratina-O, although uncommon, can perform a similar function. If the sun isn't shining, Lugia, Cresselia, Arceus-Psychic, and Arceus-Ghost can all take a hit from Blaziken and KO it with a super effective attack. It's no wonder, then, that Darkrai is a perfect partner for Blaziken. All of the aforementioned Pokemon will turn tail and run at the very sight of Darkrai, who can help pave the way for a Blaziken sweep by setting up with Nasty Plot and then severely damaging the foe's team with its own boosted hits. Dialga can also come in on Giratina and Giratina-O relatively easily and pound them into dust with Draco Meteor, while Arceus-Dark is a great counter to Lugia, Cresselia, Arceus-Psychic, and Arceus-Ghost thanks to its natural type advantage.</p> <p>Although Kyogre cannot counter Blaziken directly due to the threat of Low Kick or even High Jump Kick, the rain Kyogre summons will severely hinder Blaziken's ability to sweep by rendering Flare Blitz mostly useless. For this reason, it is recommended to pack reliable Kyogre counters when using Blaziken. Palkia and Arceus-Grass can both come in on the beast's mighty Water-type assaults with relative ease and put it down with a powerful super effective Thunder and Judgment, respectively. Finally, Blaziken might sometimes have trouble setting up due to its poor defenses. For this reason, Wobbuffet makes an excellent teammate. Thanks to Shadow Tag, it is able to trap many Pokemon and create openings to set up by using Encore, and it can also use Safeguard to protect Blaziken from status. Wobbuffet also draws Dark- and Bug-type attacks that Blaziken can easily set up on.</p>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>With Ferrothorn's excellent typing, defenses, and movepool, it can play a key role in any Ubers team. With its ten resistances and one immunity, it can switch into many common threats, such as Kyogre, Groudon, Palkia, and Zekrom, with ease. In conjunction with its support movepool, Ferrothorn's typing helps it to easily switch into a large number of threats and set up entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, and annoy opponents with Leech Seed. Its reasonable base 94 Attack also allows it to deal respectable damage to certain offensive threats, such as Kyogre and Groudon. They take considerable damage from Power Whip, and many other sweepers, such as Mewtwo and Darkrai, fear Gyro Ball. Gyro Ball will almost always hit with maximum power thanks to Ferrothorn's minuscule base 20 Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ferrothorn does not have many other options due to its limited movepool. Thunder Wave may be used to cripple common switch-ins at the cost of a weakened Gyro Ball. Explosion may be used as a last resort move or when Ferrothorn has fulfilled its job of setting up entry hazards. Extra Attack EVs on the support set may help in taking down some setup sweepers. A Curse set is also usable due to Ferrothorn's great bulk and decent power. Such a set could work well with rain support, which weakens Fire-type moves. However, Ferrothorn lacks a reliable recovery move, making it hard for it to survive for long. Toxic is useful for crippling opposing Pokemon, preventing them from setting up on Ferrothorn as they will inevitably be worn down. Rest may also be used as it is the only way for Ferrothorn to recover HP aside from Leech Seed, allowing Ferrothorn to regain health in order to set up again. However, using a cleric along with this set is advisable. Rocky Helmet is also an option in order to deal solid damage every time a physical attacker hits Ferrothorn. This is best used in conjunction with Leech Seed and Protect.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pokemon that resist both Ferrothorn's STAB attacks can comfortably switch in and set up or KO it. This includes Skarmory, Forretress, Arceus-Steel, Ho-Oh, and Reshiram; just be aware that turns spent switching in or setting up are turns Ferrothorn can use to lay down entry hazards. Any Pokemon with Fire-type attacks in the sun can KO Ferrothorn easily. This includes Pokemon such as Palkia, Dialga, and Rayquaza. However, in the rain, Ferrothorn is a little harder to take down even with Fire-type attacks. Forretress can easily spin away anything Ferrothorn sets up and barely takes any damage from Ferrothorn's attacks. Bulkier Pokemon can also set up on Ferrothorn, provided they have a recovery move and decent defenses. This includes Arceus-Ghost and Lugia.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Ferrothorn can be a great support Pokemon with its excellent movepool and typing. It can switch into many sweepers and users of Choice items, and set up entry hazards while the opponent either does little damage or switches. Ferrothorn can repeat this process many times, and can thus aid a stall team greatly. Due to its great typing and decent Attack, it can not only wall certain Pokemon, but also maim Pokemon with its attacks. Power Whip deals significant damage to Kyogre, Tyranitar, Groudon, and Palkia, while Gyro Ball deals heavy damage to sweepers such as Mewtwo, Shaymin-S, Giratina-O, and Darkrai. This allows Ferrothorn to take down setup sweepers attempting to boost up their stats while Ferrothorn sets up entry hazards. This makes Ferrothorn exceptionally hard to set up on and take down. Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs ability allows it to wear down the opponent even further when the opponent makes contact with it. With a combination of Leech Seed and Protect, Ferrothorn can even stall out a sweeper.</p> <p>Spikes is an obvious move for Ferrothorn. It can set up layers easily and wear down opposing Pokemon when they switch in. Power Whip takes down Kyogre and Groudon, which set up weather that might be undesirable for your team. Gyro Ball can deal heavy damage to frailer sweepers and prevents them from setting up. Leech Seed and Protect are useful for wearing down the opponent as well as providing self-recovery, making Ferrothorn exceptionally hard to take down. Protect can also scout for moves that can KO Ferrothorn, such as Hidden Power Fire and Fire Blast. If your team lacks it, Stealth Rock is vital to hurt any switch-in. Thunder Wave may be used to cripple an opposing sweeper, but should not be used with Gyro Ball as its power will be severely weakened.</p> <p>The choice between Power Whip and Gyro Ball depends on whether you fear Pokemon that can set up weather, or fast but frail sweepers. If one prefers Ferrothorn to live longer and deal gradual instead of immediate damage, they should run Leech Seed and Protect over Gyro Ball and Stealth Rock. If a team already has a Stealth Rock user, then Ferrothorn should run Leech Seed over Stealth Rock. If Ferrothorn is not running Gyro Ball, a Careful nature may be used. If Ferrothorn's team fears physical sweepers more than special sweepers, then it can choose to run Defense EVs instead of Special Defense. The EV spread given allows Ferrothorn to achieve a ton of special bulk while retaining the ability to break 252 HP Arceus-Dark's Substitutes with Power Whip; it would otherwise be extremely threatening to stall teams.</p> <p>Rain support is very useful to weaken Fire-type attacks thrown at Ferrothorn. When considering Ferrothorn's immense bulk, it can survive Fire-type attacks that it would normally succumb to in the rain. This makes Ferrothorn even harder to take down. Toxic Spikes support aids Ferrothorn when stalling out opponents with Leech Seed. Giratina-O is a great teammate for Ferrothorn, as their typings complement each other well. Giratina-O can also take down Forretress, preventing it from using Rapid Spin. Ferrothorn fears the sun as it is then vulnerable to common Fire-type moves used by Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Reshiram, Palkia, and Dialga.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>While it seems absurd to slap a Choice Band on such a defensive Pokemon, Ferrothorn is surprisingly powerful and can take down many common switch-ins. Ferrothorn has a very reasonable base Attack of 94, which seems low in the Uber tier until one realizes the power of its STAB Power Whip and Gyro Ball. Due to Ferrothorn's exceptionally low Speed, its Gyro Ball can almost always reach its maximum Base Power, and OHKO many offensive threats such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Shaymin-S, while 2HKOing some defensive threats such as Arceus, Lugia, and Giratina-O. Even Chansey is 2HKOed by Power Whip. With such powerful moves, Ferrothorn can easily prevent bulky Calm Mind sweepers such as Kyogre, Arceus, and Giratina-O from setting up on it, and 2HKO common switch-ins, expecting the support set.</p> <p>Due to Ferrothorn's unimpressive offensive movepool, the last two slots are mainly fillers. Bulldoze can deal reasonable damage to Steel-types that resist both Power Whip and Gyro Ball, such as Dialga, Jirachi, and Arceus-Steel. Explosion is a powerful suicide attack Ferrothorn can use at low health, and can be used to prevent Ferrothorn from becoming setup bait. Leech Seed may also be used for recovery and to wear down opponents, but being locked into it would cause obvious problems, and likely force Ferrothorn to switch out. Despite running an offensive set, Ferrothorn is still very bulky, as no Speed EVs are required due to its inability to outrun anything. This allows it to effectively sponge hits while unleashing powerful attacks.</p> <p>The following calculations prove how powerful Choice Band Ferrothorn is:</p> <ul> <li>Gyro Ball vs. 4/0 Mewtwo - 99.4% - 117.2%</li> <li>Gyro Ball vs. 4/0 Darkrai - 125.3% - 147.7%</li> <li>Gyro Ball vs. 4/0 Shaymin-S - 119.6% - 141.1%</li> <li>Gyro Ball vs. 4/0 Arceus - 72.3% - 85.1%</li> <li>Gyro Ball vs. 0/0 Giratina-O - 66.7% - 78.5%</li> <li>Gyro Ball vs. 32/0 Rayquaza - 89.4% - 105.3%</li> <li>Gyro Ball vs. 4/0 Reshiram - 47.1% - 55.6%</li> <li>Gyro Ball vs. 252/64 Lugia - 53.4% - 63%</li> <li>Power Whip vs. 4/252 Chansey - 58.1% - 68.4%</li> <li>Power Whip vs. 4/0 Kyogre - 149.7% - 177.2%</li> <li>Power Whip vs. 252/252+ Groudon - 66.8% - 78.7%</li> <li>Power Whip vs. 0/0 Palkia - 81.6% - 96.3%</li> <li>Power Whip vs. 0/0 Tyranitar - 112.4% - 132.6%</li> </ul>"

  "Qwilfish": {
    "overview": "<p>While Qwilfish is definitely not the first thing that comes to a person's mind when they select a Pokemon for their rain team, it has numerous niches that allow it to perform well in the Uber tier. With its ability Swift Swim, Qwilfish reaches an incredible Speed stat of 538, allowing it to outrun many Scarf users in the metagame. Qwilfish can function not only as a support unit, absorbing and setting up Toxic Spikes, in addition to disrupting walls and sweepers, but also as an offensive rain sweeper. However, Qwilfish does have its faults. Its minuscule defenses make it struggle to take even resisted attacks and will not last long unless played with great care. Overall though, with the right support, Qwilfish can function well even in Ubers, and can surprise unprepared teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Qwilfish's limited movepool, there are not many extra options that it might run. The utility set might run Poison Jab over Waterfall in order to deal with Water-types such as Kyogre and Palkia, but lacks the power to deal significant damage. Due to Qwilfish's frailness, Flail can also be used to deal strong neutral damage to Pokemon that resist Waterfall. Pain Split is an option that allows it to cripple Pokemon with high HP, but it cannot survive long even with replenished HP. Aqua Tail allows Qwilfish to do some extra damage at the cost of accuracy. Explosion can be used over Destiny Bond as it acts similarly, but does not guarantee a kill due to its lack of power. Toxic can also be used in order to cripple Groudon and Giratina-O as they switch in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Groudon is a surefire counter to Qwilfish. It provides the sun that cuts Qwilfish's amazing Speed and weakens Waterfall and its immense physical bulk allows it to take even a boosted attack with ease. Rayquaza renders rain's effects useless so that it can outrun and destroy Qwilfish. Dialga, Giratina, and Ferrothorn resist Qwilfish's dual STABs and can easily KO it, but must be wary of Taunt and Destiny Bond dragging them down as well. Any Pokemon with a priority move will easily take care of Qwilfish due to its minimal bulk. Scarf Mewtwo also outruns Jolly Qwilfish and can OHKO it with Psystrike.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>With Qwilfish's ability Swift Swim, it reaches a high Speed that allows it to fulfill many roles. In fact, it is the fastest user of Toxic Spikes in rain. It can easily get one layer of an entry hazard with its spectacular Speed, or cripple a wall with Taunt. Rain-boosted Waterfall dents even bulky Pokemon, and should a wall attempt to take down Qwilfish, it can drag them down along with it using Destiny Bond. It will also stop bulky sweepers such as Dialga, Zekrom, and Ho-Oh from sweeping a team thanks to playing mind games on the opponent when it alternates between Taunt and Destiny Bond. The bulky sweeper must either let both Pokemon be KOed or try to waste Destiny Bond's 8 PP. Taunt can easily stop that and force the sweeper to switch, or have both Pokemon KOed. The final thing that Qwilfish is useful for is that it can absorb Toxic Spikes. Many offensive rain teams fall prey to Toxic Spikes, and Qwilfish will render any attempt to set up Toxic Spikes useless.</p> <p>However, Qwilfish's lack of bulk will always be its Achilles' Heel. It will often be 2HKOed by even weak resisted attacks, not to mention being easily OHKOed by any sweeper's attacks. This will make very difficult for Qwilfish to switch in. Life Orb recoil does not help too much either. A Splash Plate might be used if Life Orb recoil is undesirable. However, Qwilfish is so frail that 10% of its HP matters little. Even with defensive EV investment, it lacks the bulk to take neutral attacks and must employ a hit-and-run strategy while setting up entry hazards or stopping sweepers.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is generally preferred for Qwilfish just for the extra damage, as the Jolly nature only allows it to outrun +2 Blaziken, Scarf Darkrai, and Shaymin-S. However, if one considers that important, then it is usable, especially due to the fact that Qwilfish might not attack very often anyway. Poison Jab might be used as a secondary STAB over Waterfall if one favors dealing damage to Water-types over taking down walls, beating sweepers, or setting up entry hazards, depending on which move it chooses to replace. However, the supporting moves are generally what allow Qwilfish to be so versatile. Qwilfish can be only used in the rain, as it allows it to double its Speed and increase the power of its STAB Waterfall.</p> <p>Qwilfish generally does not rely too much on teammates to fulfill its role due to its ability to prevent sweeps on its own and set up at almost any time. However, Kyogre is essential to provide the rain for Qwilfish. Giratina-O also makes a great teammate for Qwilfish, as it blocks any attempt to remove entry hazards that Qwilfish has set up. Arceus-Grass resists a large number of Qwilfish's weaknesses, and can take care of Groudon, one of the best checks to Qwilfish.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Qwilfish might also fulfill the role of an offensive sweeper in the rain. With its reasonable Attack and excellent Speed due to its ability Swift Swim, it can potentially set up and sweep. Qwilfish's dual STABs provide great coverage, and are able to OHKO Palkia, Kyogre, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Chansey, Mewtwo, and more after Stealth Rock and a Swords Dance boost. If Qwilfish is facing a Pokemon it struggles to harm, such as Giratina, it can render it useless with Taunt, attempt to drag down along with it using Destiny Bond, or set up with entry hazards. Qwilfish's Poison typing also allows it to fulfill the great utility role of absorbing Toxic Spikes, and being immune to poison prevents it from being worn down like other Swift Swim sweepers such as Kabutops and Kingdra.</p> <p>Qwilfish's primary weakness, as mentioned before, is its poor bulk. It must really rely on prediction in order to pull off a Swords Dance, or it might get KOed immediately or after a couple of turns of Life Orb recoil. Qwilfish must attempt to force out something it can check, such as Chansey, and set up Swords Dance. Once it successfully gains a Swords Dance boost, it can severely punch holes in the opposing team or even sweep it. If it encounters something it struggles to take down, it can lay an entry hazard or drag it down with Destiny Bond in order to have the last laugh. When Qwilfish is in no condition to attempt a sweep, it still has the power to revenge weakened Pokemon with Destiny Bond.</p> <p>Rain support from Kyogre, of course, is essential for Qwilfish's success. The Speed boost will allow it to outrun almost anything. This allows it to sweep entire teams late-game. It is inadvisable to allow Qwilfish to attempt a switch before an opponent's Groudon is removed from their team. Removing Qwilfish's rain almost immediately stops it from sweeping. Explosion might be used over Taunt in order to take out something when it has no options left. This is especially useful in case Groudon switches in. Waterfall cannot do much to it due to the sun, and Explosion can cause a lot of pain for Groudon. Team Preview is very useful to mark out the threats that can take Qwilfish down.</p> <p>Due to its frailness, Qwilfish can never prepare a sweep by switching in on anything. Even switching in on a resisted attack can prevent it from sweeping. Maintaining Qwilfish's health is critical. It must instead come in after a teammate has fainted, threaten the enemy Pokemon out, and set up. Wish support from Chansey might prove useful although it would be hard for it to switch back in when it is at low health. However, using Wish and then switching to Qwilfish when on relatively high health might prove useful, because if Qwilfish switches in on a resisted attack and survives it, the health provided by Wish will replenish its health and prepare it for a sweep. Mewtwo might also be a good partner for Qwilfish as it can take down Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Rayquaza, Groudon, and Giratina, which Qwilfish cannot harm.</p>"

  "Arceus": {
    "overview": "<p>After the pre-battle tintinnabulation is complete, please stare in pure, unadulterated awe and wondrous presentiment at what is unequivocally the best Pokemon in the entire game. His stats are unrivaled; His versatility is unmatched. His potential remains unlimited. He has transcended beyond typing, for Multitype allows Him to assume any of the seventeen types that He so desires. Even then, His purest forme remains seated upon His throne. Whether wiping His creations from the fabric of existence as Extreme Killer or standing as their resolute guardian by virtue of Wallceus, the God of Pokemon knows no bounds. Dare not incur Arceus's divine wrath, or else the consequences shall be severe and merciless, and life shall become but an evanescent wisp.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With His extraordinary movepool and His second to none stats, Arceus can fill almost any role. He could run a Calm Mind or Work Up set to utilize His excellent stats. He could run a Perish trapping set with Perish Song and Whirlpool. He could run a dual screens set in combination with Light Clay. He could run a Choice Specs set, a specially inclined version of the Choice Band set. Or He could run a Swords Dance Last Resort set to obliterate anything that is not a Ghost-type. For all intents and purposes, the choice is entirely up to you.</p> <p>Unfortunately, due to Species Clause, only a single Arceus is allowed on a team at a time. As such, the opportunity cost of running such sets will be high. Indeed, these sets are unorthodox for a reason: the Calm Mind and Work Up sets have horrible STAB coverage in comparison to other Arceus formes; Perish trapping is extremely unreliable in Ubers; dual screens is best left to other Pokemon; the Choice Specs set lacks power plus utility; and the Last Resort set requires a considerable amount of support. That being said, if these sets are of particular interest, then feel free to use them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Should you see Arceus on Team Preview, it is critical to rule out the presence of Extreme Killer before letting your answers to Him become compromised. While there is no true counter to Extreme Killer outside of Unaware Quagsire, there are four that can easily deal with Him for the most part: Skarmory, Wallceus, Great Wall Giratina, and Multiscale Lugia. All four of these checks can either stall Extreme Killer to death should they be healthy or phaze Him in the scenario that they are weakened or unwilling to risk a possible miss. However, even the toughest of checks can fall to the right move or item, albeit in circumstantial situations. Toxic Skarmory falls to non-rain Overheats and Fire Blasts and has to be wary of last-Pokemon +6 Brick Breaks. Faster, boosted, Life Orb Brick Breaks overpower Wallceus, while last-Pokemon Lum Berry Brick Break variants are problematic should He be running the shaky Will-O-Wisp. Similarly, Giratina bows down to a boosted Shadow Force, last-Pokemon Lum Berry Shadow Claw variants, or last-Pokemon Recover variants with Shadow Claw. Reflect + Toxic Lugia is overwhelmed by boosted Life Orb Shadow Claws after Stealth Rock. All of them must also watch out for the rare Bandceus that can Trick a crippling Choice Band.</p> <p>Rather than pseudo-countering Extreme Killer, it is easier to keep Him in check using multiple Pokemon through concerted means. For example, although Choice Scarf Terrakion cannot switch into Earthquake, it can easily survive a boosted Extreme Speed and revenge kill with Close Combat. However, should Arceus manage to survive, a combination check can be used to finish Him off. Offensive Arceus-Ghost is an excellent example, as His immunity to Extreme Speed allows Him to revenge kill weakened Extreme Killer. With smart combinations of both strong and lesser checks, the application of high pressure to limit setup opportunities, and careful conservation of these aforementioned checks, it is more than possible to deal with Extreme Killer.</p> <p>Thanks to priority Will-O-Wisp and Foul Play, Sableye is an excellent check. However, it will lose to sun-boosted Life Orb Overheat or Lum Berry Earthquake variants after Stealth Rock. Support Arceus-Ghost can be used similarly to Wallceus, but the lack of Leftovers, a strong attacking move, and His weakness to Shadow Force and Shadow Claw makes Him the lesser check. Physically defensive Groudon and Hippowdon are very effective phazers, but can be worn down. Arceus-Rock and Arceus-Steel can also use a support set like Arceus-Ghost, but the weakness to Earthquake and Brick Break is quite unfortunate. Likewise, Arceus-Fighting favors an approach similar to Terrakion, but obtains reliable recovery and bulk at the cost of power and the resistance to Extreme Speed. Thankfully, Arceus formes that carry Plates are very effective against Bandceus, though they dislike taking super effective attacks.</p> <p>Although it loses to Brick Break and non-rain Overheats and Fire Blasts, a physically defensive Bronzong can stall many variants. Along the same lines as Terrakion and Arceus-Fighting, other revenge killers can include Choice Scarf users such as Dialga and Heatran or Swift Swim users such as Kabutops and Omastar. However, they are generally less effective due to their weather dependency or lack of power. A physically defensive Giratina-O variant can survive any boosted move bar Shadow Force or possibly Dragon Claw and either Will-O-Wisp or phaze Him out. It also has an immunity to Trick, which is handy against Bandceus. Choice Band Landorus-T and Scizor can tank a boosted attack and inflict severe damage or possibly OHKO with Superpower, but have to be perfectly conserved. An utmost conserved physically defensive Forretress can triumph using Toxic and Pain Split, but will still lose to Fire Blast and Overheat. It also loses to Life Orb or Lum Berry Earthquake variants, but is still able to cripple Him. Similarly, physically defensive Ferrothorn is an annoyance with Leech Seed and Iron Barbs, but performs best when used as a combination check. If all else fails, faster Pokemon that are immune or resistant to Extreme Speed can attempt to use Destiny Bond, Trick, or Explosion to stop His sweep, but it will almost always result in their loss. Similarly, although no Intimidate user can truly stand up to Extreme Killer, the Attack drop might allow others to defeat Him.</p> <p>It should be noted that as Wallceus is more inclined to defeating answers with attrition, He necessitates a very different response than that of Extreme Killer. Thanks to STAB Fighting-type attacks and Recover, Arceus-Fighting is Wallceus's best counter. Arceus-Fire is similar and has an immunity to burn, but lacks Arceus-Fighting's consistent damage. Despite its vulnerability to attrition and lack of reliable recovery, stallbreaker Heatran shuts down any Wallceus that lacks the obscure Earthquake thanks to Taunt and Toxic.</p> <p>Any other answer to Wallceus is either easily worn down, can be phazed before significant damage is done, or is vulnerable to Return. Magic Bounce Xatu can switch into any move besides Return after Stealth Rock or Ice Beam and proceed to completely wall Arceus. Heracross can take advantage of a possible Attack boost through Guts, allowing it to pulverize Him with Close Combat. Reshiram and Victini roast Arceus with their powerful STAB Fire-type attacks. Blaziken smashes Him with High Jump Kick or sun-boosted Flare Blitz, but has to be mindful of Reflect. Strong special attackers such as Kyogre and Kyurem-W are particularly threatening due to Wallceus's lack of specialization against special attackers. Should the weather be sun, Ho-Oh can switch into any move but Return after Stealth Rock and proceed to deal considerable damage with Sacred Fire. However, Reflect variants actually wall Ho-Oh despite the sun boost, though the possible burn is an annoyance. Support Pokemon that can inflict detrimental status effects like Toxic poison, preferably with a method of alleviating status, can be quite effective against Wallceus. However, they are significantly less viable against Refresh variants.</p>",

      "Extreme Killer (Swords Dance)": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Extreme Killer's very good bulk and the priority of His Extreme Speed, He is very difficult to revenge kill. Combine it with a base 120 Attack stat, the ease of setting up a Swords Dance, and STAB on said Extreme Speed, and you get one of the best late-game sweepers in the entire game, capable of decimating offensive teams and cleaning up weakened defensive teams with ease.</p> <p>Swords Dance will enhance the power of His STAB Extreme Speed to incredible levels. With just a Silk Scarf and Swords Dance boost, Extreme Speed is more than capable enough to OHKO even the deadliest of Uber titans, such as Kyogre, Kyurem-W, Mewtwo, Latias, Palkia, and Reshiram.</p> <p>To repel the Ghost-types that can come in on Extreme Speed, Shadow Claw is the preferred option in the third slot for its high reliability. For those that crave more power, Shadow Force is another option. Its power after a Swords Dance is so extreme that even physically defensive Giratina risks being OHKOed without any hazards provided Arceus is Adamant and holding Life Orb; Giratina-O, Arceus-Ghost, and Wobbuffet are easily OHKOed. Shadow Force also evades crippling support moves such as Will-O-Wisp during its charge turn, though the charge turn in itself can prove most inconvenient against Lugia and Normal-type Pokemon. For His last slot, Earthquake eradicates the Rock- and Steel-types that could otherwise take an Extreme Speed, such as Dialga or Heatran. Brick Break, though less powerful, breaks through troublesome screens and is significantly more effective against Bronzong, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Wallceus. Recover improves His longevity and allows Him to act as a pivot at the detriment of coverage.</p> <p>With STAB Extreme Speed as His judgment, one might wonder why Arceus even bothers with Speed. After all, the given EVs and nature grant Him a superb combination of maximum power, bulk, and just enough Speed to outpace neutral base 95s. But alas, Arceus's incredible versatility allows Him to run several EV spreads just as effective as the last. Invest as many Speed EVs as desired to outspeed certain key threats. To outspeed positive base 90s like Timid Dialga, 124 Speed EVs is sufficient. 168 Speed EVs will outspeed any positive base 95s like Jolly Rayquaza. For other key threats, a Jolly nature becomes necessary. 160 Speed EVs is sufficient for outspeeding Terrakion. 176 Spe EVs will outpace positive base 110s like Froslass. Finally, 252 Speed EVs will guarantee a Speed tie against maximum Speed Arceus, which makes them unreliable answers, especially if they're using Will-O-Wisp. Once the desired Speed has been reached, maximize Attack and then place any remaining EVs into HP to improve His overall bulk. However, do recall that the greater the Speed investment, the lesser the bulk.</p> <p>Unlike His other formes, Extreme Killer can utilize almost any item. For those seeking a balanced approach, Silk Scarf is the preferred option. It provides a 20% boost to Extreme Speed without compromising bulk. For a more offensive touch, Life Orb provides a great deal more power to all of Arceus's attacks, though the recoil damage is unfortunate. With just a Life Orb and Swords Dance boost, Extreme Speed is capable of OHKOing threats such as Kyurem-B, Zekrom, and tank Ho-Oh without any hazards. It is also the best item to use against His top defensive checks. If the Speed of Jolly is favored, Life Orb is recommended to compensate for the loss of power in comparison with Adamant. For those that favor one-time status protection, Lum Berry is the best option. It is particularly useful for its utility in lead positions and SmashPass situations. However, the power loss is substantial: without the boost from Silk Scarf or Life Orb, Arceus is unable to OHKO many Pokemon like Palkia and Mewtwo without sufficient entry hazard support. For those that wish to maximize Arceus's staying power, Leftovers takes full advantage of His bulk. It works well with a bulkier spread in combination with Recover, dropping Attack to make room for more defensive EVs. Power Herb can be used alongside Shadow Force and Stealth Rock support to always get past Lugia and specially defensive Giratina, but is very situational.</p> <p>Although the given coverage moves are generally the most reliable, these slots are extremely flexible. A Life Orb-boosted Overheat incinerates Skarmory, Sableye, and Bronzong under sun, but is next to useless under rain. If Life Orb is forgone, Fire Blast is a better option while also having increased utility against Ferrothorn and Forretress. Dragon Claw can be used over Shadow Claw for its increased power against Giratina and Giratina-O, but loses utility against Lugia and Arceus-Ghost. Grass Knot 2HKOes Groudon and Hippowdon on the switch, but restricts coverage substantially. Similarly, Safeguard can prevent status for multiple turns, while Substitute eases prediction, protects against status, and punishes revenge killers.</p> <p>Two approaches exist to counteract Arceus: defensive titans and revenge killers. Defensive titans consist of Toxic stallers, phazers, or Will-O-Wisp abusers like Skarmory and Wallceus; revenge killers consist of Pokemon like Terrakion that can survive one of His faster boosted attacks comfortably yet deal considerable damage back. Arceus is specialized: He might be able to overpower several checks with a given moveset, but He is unable to overpower everything. As such, against defensive titans, the best support is to weaken any defensive Pokemon capable of dealing with His specialization beforehand. Luring them out and sufficiently damaging them will make the most of His sweeping abilities. Pokemon such as Blaziken, Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza can make excellent lures, as Arceus's defensive answers are often used in response to these threats. Powerful wallbreakers such as Kyogre, Kyurem-W, Latios, Mewtwo, and Reshiram can blast holes through the opponent's team, possibly exposing these Pokemon as well as easing Arceus's sweep. Entry hazard shuffling is also beneficial in both the damage and exposure element. Finally, specific answers that can come in on troublesome defensive Pokemon happen to be excellent teammates. Magnezone can trap and eliminate Skarmory. Xatu and stallbreaker Heatran are excellent answers against Wallceus. Giratina and Lugia dislike Darkrai, Zekrom, Reshiram, and Kyurem-W.</p> <p>Regarding revenge killers, the best support is to weaken them to the point where a faster boosted attack can OHKO, cripple their Speed, or reduce their offense to a manageable level. Entry hazards are very helpful for their damaging properties; Pokemon such as Deoxys-S, Ferrothorn, and Groudon are excellent entry hazard users. Lures such as Swords Dance Rayquaza or double status Darkrai can either deal considerable damage or cripple with status. Proper weather control through Pokemon such as Kyogre and Groudon is crucial as several revenge killers, such as Kabutops, Omastar, and Choice Scarf Heatran, are dependent on it. Dual screens from Pokemon like Deoxys-S and Latios can be helpful for softening enemy assaults. Carrying specific answers to His revenge killers is also a wise choice. For instance, Wobbuffet can dispatch Choice Scarf users while also buying Him a turn to use Swords Dance if necessary. Of course, keeping Arceus healthy is an option as most revenge killers are unable to OHKO Him should He be at relatively high health.</p>"

      "Wallceus (Physical Wall)": {
        "description": "<p>Standing up to the might of fearsome Uber titans, Wallceus can function as a nearly unbreakable wall. His Defense is so formidable that He is one of the best answers to even Extreme Killer. Although His Normal typing isn't exactly the holy grail of defensive typings, He stands out from His other formes with a lone weakness and the ability to hold Leftovers.</p> <p>To keep the physical attackers at bay, Will-O-Wisp is the preferred option. It disables nearly every physical sweeper in Ubers—Groudon, Rayquaza, physical Arceus, Garchomp, and Zekrom, to name a few—with a crippling burn. However, Will-O-Wisp's accuracy is shaky and does nothing to Fire-type Pokemon like Ho-Oh. If these issues are bothersome, Reflect is a better option. Although it lasts only five turns and can be canceled by Brick Break, Reflect does not miss, benefits the whole team, and can affect physical attackers behind a Substitute. Recover provides reliable recovery and lengthens His staying power, while Return provides a solid STAB attack that increases offensive pressure. It also enables Him to defeat Extreme Killer without the need to phaze.</p> <p>For His last slot, both options are useful for their utility against setup sweepers. Roar is the preferred option as it immediately phazes any threat that tries to set up, most notably physical attackers that have been neutralized by Will-O-Wisp or Reflect. It also weakens most switch-ins provided that there is sufficient entry hazard support. For those willing to take a longer approach, Perish Song is a better option. Although it takes three turns to have an effect, Perish Song will virtually guarantee an eventual switch and will place an inevitable end to last-Pokemon setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Arceus.</p> <p>As the physical attackers of the Uber metagame have such destructive potential, bulk investment is mandatory to effectively take them on. Heavy investment in physical bulk is necessary to successfully tank Extreme Killer's Extreme Speed. As such, the given EVs and nature ensure maximum physical bulk while still allowing Him to outpace neutral base 95s. Nevertheless, Arceus can be specialized to outspeed certain threats. Most notably, 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature takes full advantage of His base 120 Speed. By outspeeding most physical attackers, such as Terrakion and Garchomp, Arceus can cripple them with Will-O-Wisp or set up Reflect before they can land an attack. However, by lowering His bulk, Arceus's ability to actually switch in on physical hits is diminished. It also makes Him significantly more vulnerable to faster attacks, most notably Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Instead of running an attacking move, Wallceus can run a non-attacking move to provide additional utility. If status issues are particularly bothersome, Refresh is an excellent option. Status moves such as Thunder Wave or Toxic improve His status arsenal, while Magic Coat reflects entry hazards, status moves, or Taunt when used with proper prediction. Stealth Rock is also usable as a last resort. However, these options forsake offensive pressure as well as increasing His vulnerability to Taunt users. Iron Defense is a possible option over Will-O-Wisp or Reflect. Although it does not cripple the physical attacker and is dependent on Arceus's continued presence, Iron Defense does not miss, cannot be canceled by Brick Break, has greater defensive potential, and does not depend on status. It is also the superior option against Extreme Killer; only faster Life Orb Brick Break variants are capable of overcoming Him. Judgment can be used over Return along with a Bold (or Timid) nature and Ice Beam as the last moveslot. Ice Beam has increased utility against those vulnerable to Ice-type attacks such as Groudon, Zekrom, Rayquaza, and Garchomp, but is less effective against setup sweepers that are not. Of course, there are several options over Return. Although Extreme Speed has reduced PP and Base Power, it bluffs Extreme Killer and provides valuable priority. Flamethrower with a Bold nature incinerates Ferrothorn and Forretress. Earthquake shatters Heatran, which would otherwise wall this set completely.</p> <p>Although Wallceus is difficult to take down, He is not invincible. Despite His very good uninvested special bulk, extremely powerful special attacks from the likes of Kyogre and Kyurem-W can be an issue. Tanking strong Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon such as Arceus-Fighting and Heracross is also problematic. In addition, Wallceus lacks wide offensive coverage, which means He will always be vulnerable against certain checks as well as being possible entry hazard bait.</p> <p>For teams that require a sturdy physical wall, Wallceus can be a fantastic choice. He provides excellent utility for dealing with physical setup sweepers, especially with access to Perish Song. However, because He is unspecialized against special attackers, Pokemon such as Kyogre, Chansey, Latias, Ho-Oh, and Lugia tend to be great teammates. In particular, Calm Mind users are excellent partners, since provided that Arceus is running Will-O-Wisp, any crippled physical attacker is significantly less threatening to their possible sweep. Wallceus also appreciates teammates that can take on His Fighting-type weakness. Giratina and Giratina-O are excellent examples, as not only do they pack an immunity to Arceus's lone weakness, but they also spinblock the hazards that He can utilize for wearing down the opponent's team. Speaking of hazards, Wallceus greatly dislikes opposing entry hazards, as they compromise His excellent bulk. As such, Forretress is a great partner thanks to Rapid Spin, an immunity to Toxic, and its ability to provide entry hazards.</p>"
      },
      "Bandceus (Choice Band)": {
        "description": "<p>As befitting His stature, Arceus can utilize a Choice Band set to devastating effect. His value is not only in His ability to revenge kill threats such as Darkrai, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza with a stronger STAB Extreme Speed, but also His ability to lure the common checks of Extreme Killer.</p> <p>Utilizing the fact that Arceus is often assumed to be Extreme Killer, Bandceus can Trick a Choice Band to the incoming check, granting an opportunity for another sweeper to press their newfound advantage. After being Tricked a Choice Band, defensive answers like Skarmory and Lugia are turned into complete liabilities. However, Trick must be used with caution, for it is generally a one-way street. As such, it is critical that prior to using Trick, double switching is used to confirm the intended target is actually sent in.</p> <p>Bandceus's remaining slots are dependent on His intended role. If sweeping potential is desired after His Choice Band has been Tricked, Swords Dance and one additional coverage move allows Him to take on a persona similar to Extreme Killer, albeit limited in coverage. Coverage moves can include Earthquake, which deals with Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon, or Shadow Claw, which deals with Ghost-types. If better coverage at the cost of sweeping potential is desired, both Earthquake and Shadow Claw combined will suffice.</p> <p>Much like Extreme Killer, Bandceus doesn't have much reason to bother with Speed. The given EVs and nature grant Him the same combination of maximum power, very good bulk, and just enough Speed to outpace neutral base 95s. But Bandceus, just like Extreme Killer, has a multitude of spreads that can be used. Invest as many Speed EVs as desired to outspeed certain key threats. Most notably, 168 Speed EVs will outspeed positive base 95s like Jolly Rayquaza, while a Jolly nature with 252 Speed EVs will guarantee a Speed tie against maximum Speed Arceus as well as outspeeding Terrakion. Once the desired Speed has been reached, maximize Attack and then place any remaining EVs into HP to improve His overall bulk. However, do recall that the greater the Speed investment, the lesser the bulk.</p> <p>For those that prefer more power and PP, Return can be used over Extreme Speed. It is capable of 2HKOing Lugia after Stealth Rock, but the loss of priority hinders His revenge killing capabilities, His sweeping potential, and His Extreme Killer disguise. Dragon Claw can be used over Shadow Claw for its chance of 2HKOing physically defensive Giratina-O after Stealth Rock, but loses utility against Arceus-Ghost and Bronzong. Likewise, Punishment can be used for its utility against Calm Mind users such as Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, and Latias, but is rather dependent on the opponent's boosts. For those seeking improved performance against Bronzong and Ferrothorn as well as the cancellation of screens, Brick Break can be used over Earthquake, though is otherwise much weaker in general.</p> <p>When running Bandceus, one must be very careful to avoid running an inferior Extreme Killer. He has much less sweeping potential, so in order to justify His usage over Extreme Killer, it is critical that His lure and revenge killing capabilities are taken advantage of. As such, it is mandatory that He is paired up with offensive Pokemon that can take advantage of Extreme Killer's crippled checks. Good examples range from Blaziken to Ho-Oh and Groudon to Rayquaza. Regarding Arceus Himself, it is important to patch up any moveslot shortcomings. For example, should He be running Earthquake as His sole coverage move, some way of dealing with Giratina-O is essential. Of course, carrying teammates that specifically deal with His checks and counters is a very wise choice. For example, Latias deals with Arceus-Fighting, while Giratina or Giratina-O have an immunity to His only weakness and can spinblock.</p>"

  "Arceus-Bug": {
    "overview": "<p>Do not be enthralled by the pretentious divinity of Arceus-Bug, for once He so much as appears in your teambuilder, you have already followed the wrong path. He may distinguish Himself from Genesect in one way through His ability to slay Ho-Oh with Stone Edge and live to tell the tale, but He is inferior in every other regard. Arceus-Bug is vulnerable to every entry hazard and especially weak to Stealth Rock, meaning He greatly struggles to switch into play in a metagame where Rapid Spin users are scarce. While Arceus-Bug can vanquish unfortunates such as Latias, Latios, and Darkrai with His STAB X-Scissor, He cannot hope to effectively damage omnipresent foes such as Arceus-Fighting, Arceus-Ghost, and Giratina-O, rendering Him a mediocre sweeper. Ironically, Arceus-Bug's creation in Genesect consigns Him to the footnotes of mythology. Genesect can easily pivot out of difficult matchups with U-turn, preserving momentum for its team. Genesect also puts Arceus-Bug to shame with Download and its high Choice Scarf-boosted Speed, making it much more immediately threatening. Genesect's ability to run mixed sets means it can hit a much wider variety of targets than Arceus-Bug, and it also has a much better defensive typing that compensates for Arceus-Bug's advantage in bulk. Arceus-Bug's greatest downfall, however, is that Genesect offers teams so much more than He does without occupying a team's Arceus slot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Extreme Speed can be used over Earthquake, as it allows Arceus-Bug to revenge kill Pokemon such as Deoxys-A and severely weakened attackers, but it is very weak otherwise. Recover can also be run over Earthquake, giving Arceus-Bug some staying power in situations where its team fails to remove entry hazards. However, dropping Earthquake means that Arceus-Bug has no way of dealing with Dialga and Arceus-Steel.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: As Ghost-types force Arceus-Bug to rely on its weak coverage options, they make for very effective ways to shut down Arceus-Bug. Arceus-Ghost carrying Will-O-Wisp hard counters Arceus-Bug, as burn renders it useless; Arceus-Ghost can then use the free turn to set up Stealth Rock or switch into another threat. Giratina and Giratina-O can easily switch into Arceus-Bug and either phaze or burn it.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Fighting</strong>: Arceus-Fighting resists X-Scissor and can stall out Arceus-Bug with Toxic and Recover.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Unlike most Steel-types, Skarmory walls Arceus-Bug, as it is immune to Earthquake. It can freely switch into Arceus-Bug and either phaze it or set up Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Groudon</strong>: Physically defensive Groudon walls Arceus-Bug and can either 2HKO it with Stone Edge after Stealth Rock or phaze it with Dragon Tail. Life Orb Groudon, while frailer, can still take any one boosted hit from Arceus-Bug and OHKO it with Fire Punch or Stone Edge after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Several Choice Scarf users, such as Ho-Oh, Terrakion, and Reshiram, outspeed and can remove Arceus-Bug from play if it has taken some entry hazard or chip damage; however, Reshiram cannot OHKO Arceus-Bug with Blue Flare after Stealth Rock if rain is up. Extreme Killer Arceus can take any one hit from +2 Arceus-Bug, set up on it, and OHKO it most of the time with a boosted Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock. Life Orb Deoxys-A outspeeds Arceus-Bug and OHKOes it with Psycho Boost after Stealth Rock damage. Life Orb Mewtwo OHKOes Arceus-Bug with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock if rain is not up.</p>",

It is also a more reliable way of hitting Forretress neutrally than Stone Edge.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kyogre can remove Arceus-Bug's weakness to Fire-type moves with Drizzle, and in exchange, Arceus-Bug can offensively pressure two of Kyogre's most common checks in Latios and Latias. Arceus-Bug is very vulnerable to all entry hazards, so Rapid Spin users, such as Tentacruel and Mold Breaker Excadrill, make for good teammates; both of these Pokemon also complement Kyogre well. Darkrai can defeat Ghost-types that wall Arceus-Bug, such as Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O. Entry hazard setters, such as Ferrothorn and Forretress, can help wear down Arceus-Bug's foes to offset its generally lacking attacking power. Both of these Pokemon appreciate how Arceus-Bug can lure in and remove Ho-Oh in return. Will-O-Wisp Giratina-O can burn threats to Arceus-Bug such as Groudon and can also annoy Arceus-Fighting, which walls Arceus-Bug.</p>"

There will be no respite from the embodiment of primal fear, for none are immune to the terror of His STAB Dark-type attacks. Even the perceptive Latios is blinded in dismay, caught within a net of darkness where struggle is in vain. Soon stall will stand alone amidst a growing sea of shadow, struggling to hold off a boosting foe that is unassailable by status. His numerous Ghost- and Psychic-type creations will be silenced by the incoming tide; even the might of Mewtwo is quenched through the use of His support set. Although many of His creations have lost the faintest shard of hope, those that have purged their inner demons have managed to come to light. Brave warriors such as Ho-Oh, Tyranitar, and His Bug-, Fighting-, and Steel-type creations will keep the forces of Arceus-Dark at bay, preserving the existence of stall. However, if you believe that the authority of light has triumphed over darkness, then you are sadly mistaken; you can no more defeat the darkness than a Sunkern can reach for the stars.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Dark has a gigantic movepool, but not many other moves fit well on its Calm Mind set. Focus Blast gives it virtually unresisted neutral coverage, but Arceus-Dark already has bad four-moveslot syndrome and needs Refresh to fulfill its role as a stallbreaker. Fire-type moves also take out Steel-types which resist Judgment, but most Steel-types cannot harm Arceus-Dark very much anyway. Will-O-Wisp can punish physical attackers that prey on Arceus-Dark's weaker Defense stat, but Arceus-Dark shouldn't dedicate a moveslot to such an unreliable move. Roar and Reflect are in a similar vein; they are good moves, but Arceus-Dark cannot really afford to give up Refresh for them.</p> <p>The support set can run various moves, as its job is to support the team and it possesses numerous moves to do so. Roar is a great move for disrupting the opponent and forcing out setup sweepers, so if Flamethrower and Will-O-Wisp aren't needed, Roar is the move to use. Stealth Rock can be placed on Arceus-Dark so its teammates don't have to dedicate a moveslot to it; however, each and every moveslot is valuable to Support Arceus-Dark, and missing out on Roar, Magic Coat, or Flamethrower can diminish Arceus-Dark's value on a team. Punishment, though very situational, can stop some stat boosters, but should only be used on the support set. Substitute might be able to work on the Calm Mind set, but remember that Refresh is the only listed option because it grants Arceus-Dark the ability to handle Toxic Spikes. Only use Substitute if you know Toxic Spikes aren't a problem for your team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Arceus-Dark has numerous checks and counters. Ho-Oh is a popular counter to Arceus-Dark as long as Stealth Rock is not down on the opponent's side of the field. If Stealth Rock is down, Ho-Oh will be 2HKOed by Arceus-Dark's Judgment, but otherwise will 2HKO Arceus-Dark with Sacred Fire or Brave Bird. If, for some reason, Arceus-Dark lacks Refresh, Blissey and Chansey will destroy it with Toxic. Either way, Snatch Blissey and Chansey will always beat Arceus-Dark. Arceus-Fighting can easily set up on any Arceus-Dark or simply destroy it with super effective Judgments. Blaziken can do the same, but cannot switch in as often because of a lack of recovery and frail defenses. Lucario and Terrakion do the same unless Arceus-Dark has Will-O-Wisp, and Heracross will always beat Arceus-Dark thanks to Guts. Skarmory cannot beat Arceus-Dark one-on-one, but it resists Arceus-Dark's Judgment and can phaze with Whirlwind. Ferrothorn can wear Arceus-Dark down with Leech Seed, but Arceus-Dark will still win one-on-one by recovering the damage. Bulk Up Dialga resists Judgment and heavily damages Arceus-Dark, and Darkrai can switch in on any move aside from the rare Focus Blast and put Arceus-Dark to sleep with a faster Dark Void. Taunt Heatran can stop all of Arceus-Dark's moves aside from Judgment, and proceed to burn or Toxic it. Scizor can wear Arceus-Dark down with U-turn and Superpower, and Calm Mind Rest Kyogre can set up alongside Arceus-Dark and wear it down with rain-boosted Surfs or Scalds.</p> <p>The support set has more counters, but that is because it serves a specific niche of countering an opposing Mewtwo while still disrupting the opponent's team. Standard counters such as Terrakion will not want to switch into Arceus-Dark because of Will-O-Wisp, but once Terrakion is in, it will destroy Arceus-Dark with Close Combat. Heracross can switch into Will-O-Wisp but takes heavy damage from Flamethrower. Kyogre doesn't really care about burns and can 2HKO Arceus-Dark with a Choice Specs-boosted Surf, Hydro Pump, or Water Spout. However, Choice Scarf Kyogre cannot 2HKO Arceus-Dark with Surf, and needs to be at about 80% health to 2HKO Arceus-Dark with Water Spout. Blaziken just laughs at Arceus-Dark's weak attacks and sets up Swords Dance or outright KOes with High Jump Kick. Darkrai can outspeed Arceus-Dark, take little damage from its attacks, and use Dark Void on it. Afterwards, Darkrai is free to set up a Nasty Plot or just 2HKO Arceus-Dark with unboosted Focus Blast. Most Pokemon can switch in on Support Arceus-Dark freely because its strongest attack is a 50 Base Power Payback from an uninvested Attack stat.</p>",

For this reason, Arceus-Dark does not need to run a second attacking move like the Ghost forme must, but instead can run both Recover and Refresh to break stall teams that rely on passive damage and status effects to do damage. Additionally, Arceus-Dark does not worry about Toxic Spikes because it can just Refresh the Toxic away.</p> <p>252 HP EVs give Arceus-Dark a massive 444 HP, while its base 120 defenses allow it to shrug off the weak attacks that stall teams normally carry.

However, the two Dark-types have entirely different functions: Arceus-Dark is a bulky stallbreaker while Darkrai is a frail Nasty Plot sweeper. Arceus-Dark can run Focus Blast or a Fire-type move, but its niche is Refresh, and not using it makes it much more difficult for Arceus-Dark to demolish stall teams.</p> <p>Calm Mind Mewtwo and other special sweepers pair well with Arceus-Dark because Arceus-Dark can take out bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Lugia and Giratina-O, which would normally stop a Mewtwo sweep. Arceus-Dark also appreciates Stealth Rock support to wound Ho-Oh, who normally counters Arceus-Dark, as it is not 2HKOed by an unboosted Judgment. Forretress is a good choice for this because Arceus-Dark can take out the Ghost-types that block Forretress's Rapid Spin. Defensive Kyogre is also a good teammate for Arceus-Dark, as a bulky Kyogre can defeat Heatran, Ho-Oh, and Blaziken, which would usually stop this set cold.

Support Arceus-Dark in Ubers plays much like specially defensive Jirachi in OU; it switches in on some threatening special threats and forces the opponent to switch. A Calm Mind-boosted Aura Sphere from Life Orb Timid Mewtwo only does 63.5% - 75.2% to a specially defensive Arceus-Dark, while a Payback will always KO Mewtwo back after Stealth Rock damage. Even if Stealth Rock is not on the field, Arceus-Dark still OHKOes Mewtwo (after a round of Life Orb recoil) 43% of the time and Mewtwo will have to sacrifice itself in order to land a second attack on Arceus-Dark. Recover is rather obvious on a supportive Arceus; it's reliable recovery and allows Arceus-Dark to wall threats consistently throughout the match. Payback is a powerful STAB move that hits most Uber attackers on their weaker Defense and obviously damages Mewtwo greatly.</p> <p>The third and fourth slots are up for grabs. Flamethrower is recommended, as it can roast Ferrothorn, who laughs at Arceus-Dark's weak Paybacks. Magic Coat is the second option on Arceus-Dark. With a bit of prediction, Magic Coat can stop the opponent from landing a status move or an entry hazard on Arceus-Dark, instead sending the hindering effect back at the opponent. Magic Coat, aside from cleric support, is the only way to reliably keep Arceus-Dark free from status. Remember though that most Arceus-Dark already carry Refresh, so unless the opponent knows that Arceus-Dark is not the Calm Mind variant, they will probably not attempt to status it. Roar provides general utility, shutting down stat-boosting opponents and racking up entry hazard damage on the foe. The final slot should go to another utility move. Will-O-Wisp gets a special mention here, as it cripples physical attackers that want to prey on Arceus-Dark's more specially defensive set. Roar is always worth using if Will-O-Wisp's accuracy and situational utility is off-putting. If your team lacks a Stealth Rock user, Arceus-Dark can always support the team with it; this Arceus-Dark, fortunately, does not have the four-moveslot syndrome that the mono-attacker set does.</p> <p>Again, it's tempting here to compare Arceus-Dark to Darkrai, but even though the two Pokemon possess the same typing, their roles are completely different. This Arceus-Dark is also different than the Calm Mind set; while that set attempts to break classic stall teams, this Arceus-Dark is rather effective on a stall team. It can dispose of a major threat to stall teams, Calm Mind Mewtwo, as long as Aura Sphere does not score a critical hit and the opposing Mewtwo is not using the rare Focus Blast.</p> <p>The choice of item is obvious, and the nature depends on whether or not Arceus-Dark is running a special attack. If so, then Sassy is the best nature for Arceus-Dark; otherwise, use Careful so you don't needlessly detract from Arceus-Dark's great Speed. Punishment is usable on this set over Payback, because it demolishes Pokemon that boost their stats and does more damage to slower threats than Payback does. Perish Song is an interesting choice for Arceus-Dark, especially on a stall team. Perish Song can provide insurance against the Calm Mind Arceus-Dark set and other stallbreakers such as Heatran that stall teams commonly have trouble with.</p> <p>One must remember that this Arceus-Dark is not very powerful and has no way of boosting its offenses, so it's disadvantageous to rely on Arceus-Dark to deal much direct damage to the opponent. However, this Arceus-Dark boasts mammoth 444 / 286 / 363 defenses that are sure to cause switches, so entry hazard support is welcome. Ferrothorn and Forretress are natural candidates for partners, but Ferrothorn shares the Fighting-type weakness with Arceus-Dark and Forretress is also easily set up on, so it's important to have a Pokemon who can handle setup sweepers and Fighting-types. Lugia works well with Ferrothorn in particular, as it 4x resists Fighting-type moves and has the bulk to take the many Bug-type attacks that Arceus-Dark attracts. Groudon is a good partner as well, because it can take on Pokemon that switch in on Arceus-Dark such as Bulk Up Dialga and Choice Scarf Terrakion, and Drought powers up Arceus-Dark's Flamethrowers if it chooses to run the move. Though it shares a Fighting-type weakness with Arceus-Dark, Blissey is a good partner to provide Aromatherapy support, as this Arceus-Dark hates status. Really, any Pokemon that can capitalize on a defeated Mewtwo makes a good partner.</p>"

Reigning above all else, the authority of His Swords Dance and Calm Mind sets is simply supreme. No words can express the awe and wonder that His nearly unresisted Judgment and Outrage invoke, as they rain down upon the numerous Dragon-types that litter the Uber tier. Although the brute force of some of His draconian brethren surmounts even Him, fear not, as superior Speed and overall bulk allow Him to set up with greater ease. Even His creation Lugia, an unfaltering wall to the many Dragon-types found in Ubers, struggles to harm Him with its insignificant Ice Beams. Arceus-Dragon's typing also gifts Him with useful resistances to Electric-, Fire-, Grass-, and Water-type attacks. However, it is a double-edged sword in a battlefield filled with mighty Dragon- and Ice-type attacks. Kneel in honor of your deity lest you suffer His Judgment.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Dragon has a few alternative options it can use. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp and Zekrom, but Arceus-Dragon has trouble finding a moveslot on all of its sets. Overheat can provide coverage on the Swords Dance set to hit Steel-types immune to Earthquake, but it can't even 2HKO Careful Skarmory and Sassy Bronzong, nor can it OHKO Sassy Ferrothorn without sun support; in rain, it does pathetic damage even to Ferrothorn, and therefore is definitely not worth the moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Physical Choice Scarf users such as Zekrom and Garchomp are the best checks to Arceus-Dragon, as they will outspeed and OHKO it with Outrage while surviving a boosted Extreme Speed. Special attacking Choice Scarf users such as Palkia can revenge kill the Swords Dance set, but will fall to the Calm Mind sets. None of them can switch into Arceus-Dragon, though, as Judgment or Outrage will lay the smack down on them. Steel-types neutral or immune to Earthquake, such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, can take Arceus-Dragon's boosted attacks with ease, and phaze it or smack it hard with Gyro Ball, respectively; however, they do need to watch out for Fire Blast, which will smash them to bits. Chansey and Blissey wall the Calm Mind set and can stall out Arceus-Dragon with Toxic and Wish. Lugia survives a boosted Outrage or Judgment and can phaze Arceus-Dragon with Whirlwind or Dragon Tail.</p>",

        "description": "<p>With its fantastic offensive stats, Arceus-Dragon has no difficulty pulling off a Swords Dance set, hitting a mind-boggling 678 Attack stat after just one turn of setup. What sets it apart from other Arceus formes utilizing Swords Dance (Extreme Killer in particular) is the incredible power of its STAB Outrage, which blasts common Dragon-types, as well as anything that doesn't resist it, into oblivion. Earthquake pairs wonderfully with Outrage, smashing the Steel-types which resist Outrage. Finally, Extreme Speed finishes off weakened threats in addition to severely hurting healthy Choice Scarf users who wish to revenge kill Arceus-Dragon. However, it must be noted that Steel-types immune to Earthquake, such as Bronzong and Skarmory, will completely wall Arceus-Dragon, the latter phazing it with ease.</p> <p>The EV spread is straightforward; it allows Arceus-Dragon to hit as hard as possible while still outspeeding positive-natured Thundurus, Latios, and Choice Band Terrakion, as well as potentially winning the Speed tie with opposing Arceus-Steel to KO with Earthquake.</p> <p>Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp and Zekrom can survive a +2 Extreme Speed and give Arceus-Dragon a taste of its own medicine by revenge killing it with Outrage. Thus, walls such as Lugia and Groudon are great teammates for Arceus-Dragon, as they can check these threats with ease. Ferrothorn does a fantastic job as well, KOing or severely hurting Garchomp and Zekrom with Gyro Ball and Iron Barbs, even though the latter has a Steel-type resistance resists Steel-type attacks. Specially based Choice Scarf users such as Dialga and Palkia are also a headache for Arceus-Dragon, so special walls such as Chansey and Blissey make good teammates for Arceus-Dragon. Chansey and Blissey, in addition to sponging special attacks, Chansey and Blissey can support Arceus-Dragon very well with Wish and Heal Bell, and cripple the opponent with Thunder Wave. Skarmory will also wall this set, making Magnezone a great partner for Arceus-Dragon, as it can trap and eliminate Steel-types with ease. As usual, Encore support from Wobbuffet is extremely valuable, as it all but guarantees Arceus-Dragon a Swords Dance boost.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>As only Steel-types resist Dragon-type attacks, Arceus-Dragon can run a very effective Calm Mind set. While not providing a large offensive boost, Calm Mind also raises Arceus-Dragon's already-immense special bulk to massive levels, letting it set up fearlessly on special attackers. This is made easier by the fact that Arceus-Dragon packs useful resistances to Fire- and Grass-type attacks, allowing it to set up on Choice-locked Pokemon such as Kyogre. After a Calm Mind, STAB Judgment will dish out a massive amount of damage to anything that doesn't resist it, OHKOing or 2HKOing every neutral target in Ubers. Fire Blast complements Judgment well by finishing off Steel-types who hope to switch in, allowing Arceus-Dragon to roast both Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which is very useful considering the fact that the latter completely walls Arceus-Dragon otherwise. However, Substitute can be used to protect Arceus-Dragon from status, allowing it to survive powerful attacks from the likes of Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp and KO with super effective Judgment.</p> <p>The given EVs are fairly straightforward, maximizing Arceus-Dragon's Speed while boosting its overall bulk considerably. An alternate spread of 92 HP / 252 SpA / 164 Spe can be used with Substitute to bolster its offenses, while allowing it to create 101 HP substitutes in order to set up on Blissey and Chansey, who cannot hope to break them with one Seismic Toss. Alternatively, Arceus-Dragon can run a fully offensive spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe, allowing it to hit much harder with less set-up. Refresh is used to eliminate status if Substitute is not an option. Finally, Flamethrower can be used instead of Fire Blast if you are worried about accuracy, but it is significantly weaker.</p>"

It is no bolt from the blue that His energized state is one of His most offensive formes. Wielding the jaw-dropping power of STAB Electric-type attacks, Arceus-Electric hurls Thunders under rain or Thunderbolts to devastating effect. Even His mighty creations Ho-Oh, Kyogre, and Lugia slink away in terror from His malevolent storm. Yet, His resistances to Flying- and Steel-type attacks lack potential, while a weakness to the common Ground-type attacks will prove most damaging. Dialga, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar, prevalent among His creations, require Focus Blast to be annihilated, leaving Him with either less coverage or no Recover. Still, it is most imprudent to obstruct the path of the voltaic one, or else a wicked streak of lightning will be the last thing you shall ever see.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Judgment is slightly more powerful than Thunderbolt, but it has less PP and lacks the useful paralysis chance that Thunderbolt possesses. After a Calm Mind boost, Grass Knot will score an easy OHKO on Groudon, and it gets a stronger hit on Arceus-Ground, but Ice Beam retains coverage on Garchomp and Zekrom, and is therefore preferred. Fire Blast and Focus Blast are other attacks Arceus-Electric can use over Recover or Substitute--the former wrecks Ferrothorn and is incredibly powerful in the sunlight, and the latter is less accurate, but still covers Ferrothorn while also mangling Tyranitar. A boosted Earth Power allows Arceus-Electric to wreck Reshiram and Magnezone while retaining coverage on Zekrom and badly injuring Tyranitar, but Earth Power is generally less useful than the other attacks Arceus-Electric can run.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Arceus-Electric is very difficult to halt due to its excellent combination of Speed, power, and type coverage, but there are still some foes it will have a lot of trouble getting past without help. Blissey and Chansey are probably Arceus-Electric's worst enemies, as Arceus-Electric's attacks will bounce right off the vast rolls of pink, lumpy fat while they can whittle it down with Toxic. However, both blobs will lose to Arceus-Electric that carry Substitute. Groudon and Arceus-Ground can both take a boosted Ice Beam--although it will do a lot of damage--and KO Arceus-Electric with Earthquake. Choice Scarf Garchomp can switch in on any of Arceus-Electric's attacks bar Ice Beam and smash it with Earthquake. Bulky Excadrill is in a similar situation, but it has the potential to outspeed Arceus-Electric in the sand while not being too bothered by Ice Beam. Reshiram laughs off most of Arceus-Electric's attacks and can incinerate it with Blue Flare through its Calm Mind boosts, thanks to Blue Flare's sheer power under sunlight. Tyranitar doesn't care about any of Arceus-Electric's moves and can obliterate it with a mighty Earthquake. Finally, Toxic Spikes can more often than not stop Arceus-Electric from sweeping.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Although Arceus-Electric's pure Electric typing isn't so useful defensively, it is monstrous offensively, and Electric-type STAB is quite potent against many Uber Pokemon such as Lugia, Kyogre, and Ho-Oh. When combined with great Speed, bulk, power, and general lack of weaknesses courtesy of its typing, Arceus-Electric has the potential to become a true terror on the battlefield.</p> <p>Calm Mind is the crux of the set. After just one or two boosts, Arceus-Electric will become both overwhelmingly powerful and incredibly sturdy specially. Thunderbolt is the main attack for its consistent power and accuracy; it OHKOes most neutral targets after a boost or two. However, in addition to having a greater chance of paralysis, Thunder is significantly more powerful, and at +1 always OHKOes 4 HP Palkia after Stealth Rock damage. Nonetheless, Thunderbolt's consistent accuracy in all weather makes it a much more useful option. This is true especially if Arceus-Electric is being used on a sun team, where it has nice utilities, such as checking Kyogre and resisting Flying-type attacks from the likes of Ho-Oh and Shaymin-S. Ice Beam eliminates Ground-type Pokemon such as Garchomp and offensive Groudon, as well as other Pokemon that resist Electric-type attacks, such as Zekrom, forming the famous BoltBeam attacking combination. Recover is the preferred option in the fourth slot to assist Arceus-Electric in setting up more Calm Minds and negating damage from entry hazards, but Substitute offers protection from status and the ability to beat Blissey.</p> <p>The given set of EVs help to maximize Arceus-Electric's ability to sweep by optimizing its Speed and Special Attack. However, a bulkier spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe can also be considered. Due to the fact Arceus-Electric only has one weakness, it can make good use of its bulk to potentially set up even more Calm Mind boosts. This defensive investment would also allow Arceus-Electric to make Substitutes that Blissey cannot break with a single Seismic Toss, leaving the pink blob little more than setup fodder. If one desires greater type coverage, Fire Blast and Focus Blast can be used over Recover. Both options completely wreck Ferrothorn, which otherwise gives this set a hard time with Leech Seed, and hurt Dialga a lot more than Ice Beam does. However, without Recover, Arceus-Electric's survivability will be drastically reduced due to its lack of useful resistances. One can also run either attack over Ice Beam, but that leaves Arceus-Electric walled by Zekrom, Garchomp, and the Giratina formes.</p> <p>Arceus-Ground and defensive variants of Groudon are major issues for Arceus-Electric. Both these threats are immune to its STAB, are bulky enough to take an Ice Beam, and can drop it with one Earthquake. Reshiram resists Electric-type attacks, shrugs off Ice Beam, and will roast Arceus-Electric to a crisp with its powerful sun-boosted Blue Flare. Blissey and Tyranitar are special walls that can handle Arceus-Electric's hits all day and can subdue it with Toxic or annihilate it entirely with Earthquake, respectively. Choice Scarf Garchomp is also capable of outspeeding Arceus-Electric and crushing it with Earthquake before it can use Ice Beam. Mixed Rayquaza is therefore a terrific teammate for Arceus-Electric. Aside from being immune to Arceus-Electric's only weakness, mixed Rayquaza can lure out Arceus-Electric's most common adversary, Groudon, and piledrive it into the ground with a surprise Draco Meteor, leaving Arceus-Electric free to rampage. Kyogre can summon an infinite rainstorm that will slice the power of Reshiram's Blue Flare into unusable bits, hence preventing it from defeating Arceus-Electric. Groudon's high Attack and Defense make it a good and reliable answer to Garchomp, Blissey, and Tyranitar. Physical variants of Arceus-Ground can be handled by Groudon and special variants by Kyogre; finally, Shaymin-S is faster than Arceus-Ground and can put it down with Seed Flare.</p>"

Even the prevalent Dialga, the ruler of time, halts at His approach; the coverage of His virtuous STAB Fighting-type attacks is terrible to endure. Any mono-attacker utilizing Bug-, Dark-, or Rock-type attacks will flee before Arceus-Fighting's arrival, for they soon realize that defeat is all but inevitable. Yet even though His fighting spirit can win many battles, He can achieve the ultimate victory with the use of a support set. His attacks ring true against His alter ego Arceus. Make no mistake; only His Flying-, Ghost-, Poison-, and Psychic-type creations have the forthrightness to face Him in battle. For Arceus-Fighting Himself is judge; both vengeance and salvation will be delivered on that inescapable Day of Judgment.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Swords Dance set can be used with Brick Break, Shadow Force, and Recover as the remaining moves; Earthquake can also be run for its great neutral coverage. However, such a set is better done by Extreme Killer. Arceus-Fighting can also use Cosmic Power to boost its defenses. Arceus-Fighting has a huge support movepool and has no dearth of options; unfortunately, it often finds itself outclassed at many of them. For example, Arceus-Fighting can set up dual screens, but is outclassed by Lugia at this job.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ho-Oh is a great counter to Arceus-Fighting thanks to its huge Special Defense and HP, as well as its useful typing: it resists Judgment and takes little damage from Ice Beam and Dark Pulse. Ho-Oh also gets Brave Bird to OHKO Arceus-Fighting, and even has access to Recover or Roost to heal off any recoil damage taken. Soul Dew Latias can win the Calm Mind war thanks to the additional boost from her item and access to Psyshock, which not only bypasses Arceus-Fighting's boosts, it also hits for super effective damage. Ho-Oh's legendary companion, Lugia, walls Arceus-Fighting quite nicely too; it easily shrugs off Arceus-Fighting's attacks, can set up Light Screen to further reduce the damage it takes, and proceed to stall out Arceus-Fighting with a combination of Toxic and Roost. If Arceus-Fighting tries to set up, Lugia can just blow it away with Whirlwind. If Arceus-Fighting forgoes Dark Pulse for its coverage move, Wobbuffet becomes a massive pain as it can Encore Arceus-Fighting into Calm Mind or Recover. While niche, Arceus-Poison is also an effective counter. Support Arceus-Poison completely walls support Arceus-Fighting and can phaze out or poison Calm Mind variants. Calm Mind Arceus-Poison is even more dangerous, as its immunity to poison and resistance to Arceus-Fighting's STAB move allows it to use both of Arceus-Fighting's sets as setup bait.</p> <p>Mewtwo can outspeed Arceus-Fighting; offensive variants can OHKO with Psystrike, while defensive ones can use Taunt to prevent Arceus-Fighting from using Recover or setting up. Mewtwo also resists Judgment, and an unboosted Dark Pulse will only 2HKO. Shaymin-S is resistant to Judgment and can 2HKO Arceus-Fighting with a speedy Air Slash, but if Arceus-Fighting is lucky enough not to flinch, an Ice Beam will have Shaymin-S crying. Arceus-Psychic is a good counter to Arceus-Fighting; both can Calm Mind up, but the war will be won by Arceus-Psychic thanks to its type advantage and access to Psyshock. Calm Mind Kyogre can defeat Arceus-Fighting with its strong STAB moves and high Special bulk. Reshiram can come in on a Will-O-Wisp from the support set and 2HKO Arceus-Fighting with Blue Flare. Jirachi is not OHKOed by any attack and can cripple Arceus-Fighting with Thunder Wave and then take it out with Zen Headbutt or repeated Iron Heads.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Like every other Arceus forme, Arceus-Fighting possesses awesome base 120 stats across the board, and is blessed with a wide special movepool, including coveted moves in Calm Mind and Recover. Arceus-Fighting separates itself from the pack with its uncommon typing, which gives it some oddly useful resistances and few weaknesses. All these traits come together to make Arceus-Fighting one of the best users of Calm Mind in Ubers.</p> <p>Judgment is its primary STAB move, and can severely dent any Pokemon who doesn't resist it after Arceus-Fighting has notched up two Calm Minds. Two Calm Minds propels Arceus-Fighting's naturally great Special Attack stat to a mammoth 554. Ice Beam widens Arceus-Fighting's coverage, and hits several important Uber sweepers, namely Zekrom, Groudon, Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Shaymin-S, for super effective damage. Volcarona and Chandelure are the only Pokemon who resist the combination of Fighting and Ice, and fortunately, neither are seen much in Ubers play. Dark Pulse allows Arceus-Fighting to hit Ghost-types, who are immune to Arceus-Fighting's primary STAB, for super effective damage; it also hits the horde of Psychic-types in Ubers, especially Mewtwo, Mew, and Arceus-Psychic, for super effective damage. However, Ice Beam is generally the better option because of its higher Base Power and specific coverage.</p> <p>Maximum investment in HP along with Recover is used to make Arceus-Fighting as bulky as possible and hence bag more Calm Mind boosts. Arceus-Fighting can run a Modest nature with maximum investment in Special Attack in order to comfortably 2HKO Wobbuffet with Dark Pulse, 2HKO Chansey and Blissey after Stealth Rock, and OHKO Extreme Killer Arceus after Stealth Rock 87% of the time.</p> <p>Ho-Oh can counter Arceus-Fighting very well. Armed with base 106 HP and titanic base 154 Special Defense, it resists Judgment and laughs at Ice Beam. Ho-Oh is also one the few Uber Pokemon who has access to a STAB Flying-type move: Brave Bird, which after a Life Orb boost can OHKO Arceus-Fighting. However, Ho-Oh pays dearly for its typing, as it will lose 50% of its health every time it switches in if Stealth Rock is on the field. Shaymin-S is another one of the few Pokemon used in Ubers that has access to a Flying-type STAB move. It also outspeeds Arceus-Fighting and can 2HKO an unboosted Arceus-Fighting with Air Slash. Due to Air Slash's high flinch rate, which is further enhanced by Serene Grace, Arceus-Fighting will often not even be able to make a move before getting taken out. Even so, Shaymin-S has to be wary of Ice Beam. Finally, offensive Mewtwo's Psystrike will always OHKO Arceus-Fighting. Therefore, powerful Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Terrakion and Kyogre make good partners to Arceus-Fighting. Terrakion can easily check Ho-Oh and Shaymin-S with its STAB Stone Edge. However, Shaymin-S is rather annoying to deal with due to Seed Flare and Air Slash's flinch chance. Because of this, Lugia can act as a good partner to Arceus-Fighting thanks to its immense bulk, access to Reflect, and Pressure to eventually stall Ho-Oh out of Sacred Fire PP. Lugia can also Whirlwind away Substitutes set up by Shaymin-S and blast it with a 4x super effective Ice Beam.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Forretress, Deoxys-S, and Ferrothorn can all set up entry hazards reliably and are good partners to Arceus-Fighting. Stealth Rock is especially helpful for Arceus-Fighting as it strips Ho-Oh of 50% of its health every time it switches in. In addition to resisting Stealth Rock itself, Arceus-Fighting boasts resistances to common attacking types in Ubers, namely, Rock, Bug, and Dark. This makes Arceus-Fighting an excellent check to Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Choice Scarf Terrakion, and Arceus-Rock. Arceus-Fighting resists both of Tyranitar's STAB moves and can OHKO it with Judgment. Similarly, Terrakion is smashed to pieces by Judgment, while Arceus-Rock loses due to its natural type disadvantage. It must be noted that Arceus-Fighting is a good partner to Ho-Oh as it checks the Rock-types Ho-Oh hates.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Arceus-Fighting is an excellent Calm Mind sweeper, but it is equally adept at taking on a more supportive role. Arceus has a great support movepool, boasting access to moves such as Recover, Will-O-Wisp, and Stealth Rock. Arceus-Fighting's great bulk, excellent 120 / 120 / 120 defenses, and lack of common weaknesses all help it in its role. Judgment has good neutral coverage in the Uber tier and does respectable damage even when unboosted thanks to Arceus's great base 120 Special Attack stat and STAB. Ice Beam has great coverage and is especially useful for taking out the ubiquitous Dragon-types in Ubers, most notably Rayquaza, which Arceus-Fighting is an excellent check to. With Recover, Arceus-Fighting can heal up during battle, increasing its overall longevity.</p> <p>Toxic is the primary status move, and is chosen over Will-O-Wisp due to its ability to cripple Arceus-Fighting's four greatest checks: Ho-Oh, Mewtwo, Latias, and Lugia. Will-O-Wisp also provides less general utility, as the only semi-common Steel-type that can switch into Arceus-Fighting is Jirachi; physical attackers and support Pokemon such as Dialga and Ferrothorn can be smacked with a super effective STAB Judgment instead of relying on residual damage from Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Perish Song lets Arceus-Fighting beat late-game sweepers such as Calm Mind Kyogre and Refresh Calm Mind Arceus variants. Roar can also be used to phaze out other Pokemon trying to set up on Arceus-Fighting; it is best when used in tandem with entry hazards as it allows Arceus-Fighting to rack up entry hazard damage on its foes. Finally, Arceus-Fighting can set up Reflect to support the team if needed.</p> <p>The EVs are tailored to deal with specific Pokemon; a Bold nature and the Defense EVs means that a +1 Adamant Outrage from Life Orb Rayquaza will not OHKO, even after Stealth Rock. Even a Life Orb Adamant +2 Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus only has a minuscule chance to OHKO this set after Stealth Rock and three layers of Spikes. 4 Special Attack EVs ensure that Ice Beam will OHKO Rayquaza, even without Stealth Rock. 168 Speed EVs allow Arceus-Fighting to outspeed all unboosted Rayquaza, allowing it to switch into those that use Outrage off the bat and retaliate with Ice Beam before getting 2HKOed.</p> <p>This set has massive issues with Ho-Oh, Mewtwo, and Latias, but it actually does better against them than the Calm Mind set, thanks to Toxic. Ho-Oh laughs at all of Arceus-Fighting's attacks and OHKOes with Brave Bird, while Mewtwo resists Arceus-Fighting's STAB and can put it down with Psystrike. Latias with Psyshock will also wreck Arceus-Fighting. Shaymin-S can 2HKO Arceus-Fighting with Air Slash, which means that Arceus-Fighting will lose if it gets flinched. Choice Scarf Zekrom can reliably revenge kill Ho-Oh, Mewtwo, Latias, and Shaymin-S, in addition to being one of the few Pokemon to be able to threaten Multiscale Lugia. Heatran is a good partner, as it laughs at StallTwo and walls Ho-Oh lacking Earthquake. Choice Scarf Heatran can revenge kill offensive Mewtwo in the sun with Overheat, and switch into Shaymin-S's Seed Flare. A physically bulky Kyogre can switch into non-Life Orb Ho-Oh, as Brave Bird will take less than 50% of its HP; furthermore, changing the weather lets Pokemon such as Dialga handle Ho-Oh much easier. Wobbuffet walls Mewtwo without sun-boosted Fire Blast or Shadow Ball, and can stall out Pokemon that Arceus-Fighting has afflicted with Toxic. Lugia and Giratina wall Ho-Oh quite well and can stall it with Toxic or phaze it out. Lugia also resists Psychic-type attacks, while Giratina is a terrific spinblocker.</p>"

  "Arceus-Fire": {
    "overview": "<p>Do not anger Arceus when He sears as brightly as His Flame Plate lest you be consumed in His flaming inferno. Blazing with an offense that few formes can rival, Arceus-Fire can unleash STAB Fire-type attacks to incinerate the opposition. Although His fiery creations Ho-Oh and Reshiram have dual STABs and outclass even Him in firepower, He has superior initial Speed and viable access to both Recover and Calm Mind. Yet, in the thrill of intense battle, His defense begins to suffer. Reckless in devouring attack, the completely enraged Arceus-Fire takes no heed to avoid the crippling Stealth Rock, and is thus left with terrible weaknesses to Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type attacks. His scorching forme is also reliant on the sun to reach the height of His fury, something quickly quenched by the sea titan Kyogre. Nevertheless, if you anger Arceus-Fire into a burning rage, His all-consuming flames will leave you as nothing more than a mere wisp of smoke in the wind.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Fire can opt for Ice Beam over Thunder to hit Garchomp, Zekrom, Hydreigon, and Giratina for super effective damage. Grass Knot lets Arceus-Fire hit Tyranitar and Kyogre, but its utility stops there. Earth Power destroys Heatran and at +1 2HKOes Tyranitar; however, Ho-Oh will then pose a huge problem. Finally, keep in mind that in order to gain another coverage move, Arceus-Fire must drop Recover and will therefore take hefty damage from entry hazards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Kyogre can put a sudden halt to Arceus-Fire's plans. The Choice Scarf variant is of particular concern, as it can switch into a Flamethrower and OHKO an unsuspecting Arceus-Fire with a speedy Water Spout. Other variants of Kyogre can check Arceus-Fire to an extent, but as it is outrun by Arceus-Fire, Kyogre becomes vulnerable to a boosted Thunder. Rayquaza can take a +1 Flamethrower or Thunderbolt, nab a Dragon Dance boost, and OHKO Arceus-Fire with Earthquake. Blissey and Chansey can wall Arceus-Fire with their massive Special Defense and HP; both can Toxic Arceus-Fire and put a timer on its existence, as well as use Seismic Toss to hasten Arceus-Fire's demise. Specially defensive Heatran can defeat Arceus-Fire if it has Taunt and Toxic, but a boosted Earth Power or Focus Blast will do hefty damage. Ho-Oh is a good check to Arceus-Fire thanks to its great Special Defense and powerful Earthquakes. Gastrodon, though generally nonexistent in Ubers, is resistant to Fire-type moves and immune to Electric-type ones, and can Toxic Arceus-Fire and stall it out. Tyranitar resists Fire-type attacks, laughs at Thunder, and can KO Arceus-Fire with STAB Stone Edge. However, it must look out for Earth Power or Focus Blast. Choice Scarf Garchomp can switch in on a Thunder or Flamethrower and OHKO Arceus-Fire with an Earthquake. Choice Scarf Terrakion can just switch in on any attack and OHKO with Stone Edge. Finally, Arceus-Rock falls in the same category as Terrakion, and can check Arceus-Fire well in sandstorm due to its natural type advantage.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Fire is an excellent offensive typing. Flamethrower hits most Pokemon for neutral damage and is rounded off nicely by Arceus-Fire's plethora of coverage moves; it is used over Judgment because it has higher PP and a burn chance, and the power difference is negligible. Reshiram gives this set some competition, but Arceus-Fire is faster, bulkier, and has access to instant recovery. Arceus-Fire is an extremely powerful bulky sweeper in the sun, and after one Calm Mind, STAB Flamethrower coming off a base 120 Special Attack will immolate Pokemon who do not pack a quadruple resistance to Fire-type attacks. The prevalence of Dragon-type moves in the Uber tier means that there is an abundance of Steel-types, providing a perfect environment for Arceus-Fire to sweep.</p> <p>Fire Blast can be used over Flamethrower for its superior power, but it lacks the reliability of Flamethrower. It is liable to miss and has only 8 PP, which is not much at all thanks to the ubiquity of Pressure users in Ubers. Thunder 2HKOes Kyogre, Manaphy, and Ho-Oh after a Calm Mind boost, but as it has pathetic accuracy in sunshine, Thunderbolt can be used instead. However, the drop in power is quite large. Recover allows Arceus-Fire to take advantage of its great natural bulk, and also helps it win Calm Mind wars. Without Recover, Arceus-Fire easily falls prey to Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack allows Arceus-Fire to sweep with minimal setup, provided that the sun is up, while maximum Speed lets Arceus-Fire tie with other Arceus. A Modest nature can be used, but it leaves Arceus-Fire outsped by Terrakion, whom it could otherwise vaporize with a speedy Fire Blast. Arceus-Fire is certainly not strapped for alternative attacking options: Spacial Rend can be used to wreak havoc on the innumerable Dragon-types in the Uber tier, and is especially useful for hitting Palkia, who 4x resists Arceus-Fire's main STAB. Focus Blast hits Tyranitar and Heatran and also allows Arceus-Fire to do some damage to Blissey and Chansey. Though it might seem that almost everything in the Uber tier resists the combination of Flamethrower + Thunder, they all take hefty damage despite their elemental resistances. The following calculations assume Arceus-Fire has obtained one Calm Mind boost and the sun is up:</p> <ul> <li>Flamethrower vs. 4/0 Garchomp 63.1% - 74.6%</li> <li>Flamethrower vs. 252/0 Zekrom 49.0% - 57.6%</li> <li>Flamethrower vs. 4/0 Zekrom 57.8% - 68.1%</li> <li>Flamethrower vs. 252/0 Groudon 106.9% - 125.7%</li> <li>Flamethrower vs. 4/0 Mewtwo 122.0% - 143.5%</li> <li>Flamethrower vs. 28/252+ Wobbuffet 75.0% - 88.3%</li> <li>Flamethrower vs. 252/0 Arceus 76.4% - 89.9%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252/0 Lugia 82.2% - 96.9%</li> <li>Thunder vs. 248/0 Ho-Oh 61.2% - 72.3%</li> <li>Thunderbolt vs. 248/0 Ho-Oh 48.7% - 57.3%</li> <li>Thunder vs. 252/0 Kyogre 68.8% - 81.2%</li> </ul> <p>Arceus-Fire must be run alongside Groudon, as the infinite sun Groudon summons boosts Arceus-Fire's Flamethrower and negates its weakness to Water-type attacks. Groudon also checks most of the major threats to Arceus-Fire, namely Garchomp, Blissey, Arceus-Rock, Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Reshiram. As much as Arceus-Fire loathes entry hazards on its own side of the field, it loves Stealth Rock and Spikes on the opponent's side, as said hazards discourage the opponent from making too many switches. Groudon can set up Stealth Rock with ease, making it an excellent partner to Arceus-Fire. Forretress can set up all the hazards and also keep them off the field with Rapid Spin. Giratina definitely helps as it can spinblock and keep the entry hazards on the foe's side of the field.</p> <p>Kyogre is a constant source of trouble for Arceus-Fire. It takes away the sunshine Arceus-Fire enjoys and replaces it with rain, augmenting Arceus-Fire's weakness to Water and reducing the power of its STAB. Palkia 4x resists Fire-type moves and can 2HKO Arceus-Fire with Surf, while Blissey and Chansey can take Flamethrowers all day, Toxic Arceus-Fire, and heal up while Arceus-Fire dies a slow and painful death. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can take a Focus Blast and OHKO with Stone Edge if Arceus-Fire has previously taken Stealth Rock damage. Reshiram can check Arceus-Fire to a certain extent thanks to its 4x resistance to Fire-type moves and ability to OHKO with Choice Specs Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock damage. In turn, Palkia can counter Kyogre quite well due to its 4x resistance to Water Spout; it can even outspeed Kyogre and 2HKO it with Thunder. Palkia can also check Choice Reshiram locked into a Fire-type move by switching in easily and annihilating it with Spacial Rend. With some entry hazard support, even the mighty Blissey can be taken out by mixed Palkia. Groudon can check Choice Scarf Tyranitar with ease; Tyranitar is 2HKOed by Earthquake while Groudon takes almost nothing from Tyranitar's attacks. Wobbuffet can trap foes and Encore them into a harmless move to give Arceus-Fire a chance to set up. Tickle Wobbuffet can also be paired with a Pursuit user such as Scizor to KO Blissey.</p>"

  "Arceus-Flying": {
    "overview": "<p>Hark the hallowed voices that cry from The Original One as He descends from the heavenly Hall of Origin in a manner as holy as His Sky Plate. Soaring above the Spikes and Toxic Spikes bound to mortal lands below, Arceus-Flying pronounces His Judgment to be heard from the heavens. The Uber tier stands silent before Him, for none are immune and few are resistant to His STAB Flying-type attacks. Although His creations Ho-Oh and Shaymin-S have dual STABs and advantageous abilities to contest for the offensive supremacy of the sky, only He can viably use Calm Mind to reach heights beyond the limits of which can be seen. Yet, even Arceus-Flying can fall from the heavens. A weakness to Stealth Rock proves a great obstacle for His overall well-being. Though He resists Bug-, Grass-, and Fighting-type attacks and heeds no Ground-type attack, without the purity that comes from within a Calm Mind, the saintly Arceus-Flying plummets like a falling star in face of common Electric-, Ice-, and Rock-type attacks. Cry not in despair, for when the time comes for the heavens to finally open, His Judgment shall come as swiftly as the tempest of a thousand gales.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Flying can run a fun little Swords Dance set with Fly, Earthquake, and Extreme Speed or Recover. However, since Fly is a multi-turn attack, it makes Swords Dance Arceus-Flying extremely easy to play around. Arceus-Flying can also run a support set for a Ground-immune Pokemon, but on the flip side, He is weak to Stealth Rock and doesn't really have the best defensive typing. Lugia also outclasses Arceus-Flying in most ways in a defensive role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Choice Scarf Zekrom is probably the most practical counter to Arceus-Flying. It can switch into pretty much any attack, even an Earth Power, and OHKO with Bolt Strike. Arceus-Rock in the sand is probably the next best thing. With titanic Special Defense, it can easily tank Focus Blast and Calm Mind alongside Arceus-Flying. Arceus-Steel and -Electric  check Arceus-Flying, but both can be defeated if Arceus-Flying wins the Speed ties and hits them both with Focus Blast or Earth Power, respectively. Calm Mind Latias is generally a very solid counter to Arceus-Flying unless she is low on health. Her massive Special Defense allows her to Calm Mind up alongside Arceus-Flying and defeat Him with with Psyshock or Thunder. Specially defensive Kyogre can also Calm Mind alongside Arceus-Flying and pressure Him with rain-boosted Water-type moves and Scald burns. Choice Specs Kyogre also tends to be something Arceus-Flying finds difficult to handle one-on-one. Jirachi, Metagross, and Bronzong resist Judgment, but the former two must watch out for Earth Power, while all three need to watch out for Fire Blast in the sun. If Arceus-Flying is not running Focus Blast, Tyranitar laughs at Him. Magnezone 4x resists Flying-type moves and hits Arceus-Flying hard with Thunder, but will need to watch out for Focus Blast or Earth Power. If Stealth Rock is not up, Ho-Oh can take a hit and deal massive damage with either Brave Bird or sun-boosted Sacred Fire. The Thundurus formes resist most attacks Arceus-Flying uses apart from sun-boosted Fire Blast and deal huge amounts of damage with Thunder, or even Thunderbolt. If Arceus-Flying lacks Substitute, Thundurus can also paralyze Him with Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Heatran can Roar Arceus-Flying out or use Toxic on it, although it cannot defeat last Pokemon Arceus-Flying with Substitute, or Arceus-Flying with Earth Power or Focus Blast. Like Heatran, Skarmory can force Arceus-Flying out with Whirlwind or inflict Toxic on it, but loses to variants carrying Fire Blast, or if He is a last Pokemon with Substitute. Lugia and the Giratina formes can take a boosted Judgment and force Arceus-Flying out if they are healthy, but will also lose if Arceus-Flying is the last Pokemon and has Substitute. Choice Scarf Kyurem-B can revenge kill a weakened Arceus-Flying with Fusion Bolt. Kabutops and Omastar need rain to outspeed Arceus-Flying and need to watch out for Earth Power or Focus Blast, but Kabutops can revenge kill with Stone Edge, and Omastar can deal lots of damage with Hydro Pump. Beartic is another Swift Swim Sweeper that troubles Arceus-Flying, as it can OHKO Arceus-Flying after Stealth Rock damage, and Encore Arceus-Flying into Calm Mind and set up Swords Dance in His face. If sandstorm is up, Excadrill can defeat Arceus-Flying one-on-one if He lacks Focus Blast or Earth Power. Finally, Choice Scarf Terrakion can also revenge kill Arceus-Flying with Stone Edge.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Like many Arceus formes, Arceus-Flying's best and only viable set is one that utilizes Calm Mind. This does not mean, however, that Arceus-Flying is mediocre. While Arceus-Flying has a rather ordinary defensive typing, Flying-type is an extremely solid attacking STAB. This, coupled with an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, allows Him to use a very effective mono-attacking set, checkmating many stall teams that lack a powerful attacker to take Him down. Calm Mind, Judgment, and Recover are absolutely mandatory for a Calm Mind Arceus set, and this one is no exception. The last slot can be more variable. The ideal move is Substitute, as it allows Arceus-Flying to singlehandedly destroy stall teams. However, Focus Blast can be used for a more offensive approach, hitting most Pokemon that resist Judgment for neutral or super effective damage, and is especially useful for Dialga and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Since Arceus-Flying has a very large movepool, He can run a multitude of different moves in the last slot. Fire Blast can be used to fry Jirachi and Bronzong in the sun, both of which would be troublesome Pokemon to Arceus-Flying. Earth Power can be used to hit Jirachi out of the sun, as well as Zekrom and Heatran. Will-O-Wisp can cripple Zekrom switch-ins, but it still doesn't really allow Arceus-Flying to defeat Zekrom. Another option is to not even run Recover and run Calm Mind + 3 attacks, but Arceus-Flying isn't nearly as good as an all-out sweeper as He is a slow booster. Refresh is an interesting move, as other stallbreaking Arceus formes use it. However, since Arceus-Flying is immune to Toxic Spikes, He generally does not need Refresh to cure Himself of status conditions, since He will not get any as long as you play Him properly. On the other hand, Substitute protects Arceus-Flying from Leech Seed, Dark Void, paralysis, and critical hits, which are far more useful than what Refresh offers.</p> <p>The HP EVs give Arceus-Flying 405 HP, which allows Him to make 101 HP Substitutes, while still allowing Him to switch into Stealth Rock more than four times. Max Speed makes Arceus-Flying as fast as possible, while the rest goes into offenses. Another way to EV Arceus-Flying is to give Him max HP and max Speed like most other Calm Mind Arceus formes. Be aware that if you decide to go down that route, you lose a guaranteed 2HKO on Eviolite Chansey at +6, which means you could potentially be stalled out, even if you land a critical hit, if Chansey continues to spam Soft-Boiled. A fully offensive spread with max Special Attack and Speed is also an option if you forgo Substitute.</p> <p>Arceus-Electric, Arceus-Rock, and Arceus-Steel tend to counter Arceus-Flying very well. Bronzong, Jirachi, and Metagross only need to watch out for sun-boosted Fire Blasts, or in the latter two's case, Earth Power. Zekrom resists Judgment and OHKOes Arceus-Flying with Bolt Strike, fearing only Earth Power. The Thundurus formes resist both Judgment and Focus Blast and do huge damage with Thunder. Excadrill is an excellent teammate to take on all of the above—it not only synergizes well with Arceus-Flying, but it can also spin away Stealth Rock, which is a pain for Arceus-Flying to deal with. Other Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Groudon are also good, although they will need to watch out for boosted Ice-type moves. Other Rapid Spin users that Arceus-Flying can appreciate include Kabutops, Tentacruel, and Forretress. If Kyurem-W is healthy, it can tank a Judgment and OHKO with Choice Specs Ice Beam and Latias also gives Arceus-Flying troubles. Specially defensive Kyogre is a good Pokemon to deal with Kyurem-W, and Jirachi and Bronzong can deal with both Kyurem-W and Latias. If you're using a sun team, then Ho-Oh and Heatran are also relatively good switch-ins to both dragons.</p>"

  "Arceus-Ghost": {
    "overview": "<p>When Arceus-Ghost takes His place on the battlefield, He is certain to frighten the opponent to no end. Blessed with outstanding bulk, only two weaknesses, two immunities, and perfect coverage when using Judgment and Focus Blast, Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost is one of the most devastating sweepers in Ubers. Scant few Pokemon can claim to safely check Him, especially if Stealth Rock is up. In addition to His sweeping capabilities, He is a terrific spinblocker that is capable of beating all Rapid Spin users one-on-one. Arceus-Ghost is also versatile, as He is capable of running support, lead, and Swords Dance sets to varying degrees of effectiveness.</p> <p>As good as Arceus-Ghost is, He does not come without His faults. Most notably, Arceus-Ghost is vulnerable to all forms of status. Both Toxic and Thunder Wave can put a damper on His sweeping capabilities. In addition, two relatively useless resistances to Bug- and Poison-type attacks limit His opportunities to set up in the face of powerful attacks, although He possesses the bulk to set up on weaker neutral attacks like Choice Scarf Palkia's Spacial Rend. Finally, the general reliance on inaccurate moves such as Focus Blast and Will-O-Wisp makes some of His sets prone to bad luck. Do not let these drawbacks fool you into thinking Arceus-Ghost is easily taken down, lest you forever be haunted by the memory of Arceus-Ghost sending your entire team to the dark, cold afterlife.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Ghost is capable of running a Cosmic Power set with Roar, Recover, and Substitute. In conjunction with entry hazards, Arceus-Ghost is capable of wrecking the opponent's team with the passive damage that Roar provides. Such a set should run maximum Speed so that it can phaze out walls before getting phazed out itself. Surf can be used on the support set with rain teams to reliably smack Excadrill, Ho-Oh, and Forretress. Toxic and Thunder Wave are viable on the support and anti-lead sets to spread status, but they leave Arceus-Ghost unable to reliably deal with physical sweepers such as Double Dance Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus. In addition, most of the Pokemon that switch into Arceus-Ghost are slow and generally do not mind paralysis, while Toxic leaves both sets at the mercy of most Steel-types. Finally, Thunder can be used on the Calm Mind set to nail specially defensive Kyogre and Ho-Oh. However, Thunder is a terrible move if rain isn't up and leaves Arceus-Ghost walled by Steel-types, so it is generally a mediocre option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Darkrai is an excellent answer to all variants of Arceus-Ghost. It can outspeed Arceus-Ghost and put it to sleep, and then proceed to butcher it with Dark Pulse. Darkrai cannot directly switch into a Focus Blast or Brick Break, however. Similarly, Arceus-Dark beats Arceus-Ghost courtesy of its typing and has an easier time switching directly into it, though Arceus-Dark cannot put Arceus-Ghost to sleep. If Stealth Rock is not up, Ho-Oh generally counters Arceus-Ghost due to its titanic Special Defense and wallbreaking power. A Life Orb, sun-boosted Sacred Fire will rip away well over half of Arceus-Ghost's health while possessing a 50% chance to burn. However, offensive Ho-Oh variants risk getting OHKOed by a +1 Judgment from max Special Attack Arceus-Ghost if Stealth Rock is up, and can lose to the Swords Dance variant on the switch, even at full health. Choice Scarf users such as Zekrom and Kyogre can pick off weakened Arceus-Ghost, even assuming Arceus-Ghost has a Calm Mind boost in Kyogre's case. Similarly, weather sweepers such as Shiftry, Kabutops, and Omastar can revenge kill Arceus-Ghost under their preferred weather. Omastar can OHKO Arceus-Ghost with a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump, though the other two need a little more prior damage on Arceus-Ghost to take it down in one hit.</p> <p>If you are unable to overwhelm Arceus-Ghost via offensive pressure, it can still be checked via defensive measures. Specially defensive Kyogre counters the Calm Mind set, as it is not even 2HKOed by a +1 Judgment while it can phaze Arceus-Ghost out with Roar. Chansey and Blissey both wall the Calm Mind and support sets, provided Arceus-Ghost does not run Substitute, but they lose to the Swords Dance set. Jirachi is a good check at full health due to its excellent special bulk and ability to spread status. Jirachi takes good damage from boosted Judgments, so Arceus-Ghost can circumvent weakened ones. Specially defensive Scizor with Toxic and Roost can check Arceus-Ghost well unless it carries Fire Blast. Specially defensive Forretress and Tentacruel can lure Arceus-Ghost in and cripple it with Toxic, and both have enough bulk to take a hit or two from a +1 Arceus-Ghost. Specially defensive Skarmory can tank a +1 Focus Blast and phaze Arceus-Ghost with Whirlwind. Skarmory also checks the Swords Dance set, though dislikes getting burned by the support set and can get zapped by the rare Thunder. Hippowdon, physically defensive Kyogre, Will-O-Wisp Arceus formes, and physically defensive Forretress all make good checks to the Swords Dance set.</p> <p>If your team loses its primary Arceus-Ghost check, there are several emergency options. In a pinch, Thundurus can sacrifice itself to cripple Arceus-Ghost with Prankster Thunder Wave. Bisharp can hit Arceus-Ghost very hard with Sucker Punch, though it does not necessarily OHKO and can be foiled by Substitute variants. Heatran can phaze Arceus-Ghost out once with Roar or cripple it with Toxic, but it will take heavy damage from Focus Blast in the process. Genesect can attempt to repeatedly flinch Arceus-Ghost with Iron Head, though this isn't very reliable because Genesect takes massive damage from both Fire Blast and a boosted Focus Blast. Finally, Chople Berry Tyranitar can take a Focus Blast and deal back heavy damage with Crunch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>This is Arceus-Ghost's best set, and one of the most dangerous sets in all of Ubers. Though Arceus-Ghost does not hit that hard right off the bat, it is capable of sweeping entire teams after just one or two uses of Calm Mind. Its terrific bulk and lack of weaknesses enable it to set up a Calm Mind on many prominent Pokemon, such as Latias and most variants of Palkia. Judgment is Arceus-Ghost's obligatory STAB move, and its already good 100 Base Power is boosted further by Spooky Plate. Focus Blast hits Normal-, Steel-, and Dark-types super effectively, which is critical because those are the only three types that either resist or possess an immunity to Arceus-Ghost's STAB. Though Focus Blast is its best coverage move, Fire Blast is an acceptable replacement on sun teams due to its higher accuracy and reasonable power against the types that resist Judgment. Notably, Fire Blast helps break specially defensive Forretress, which gives Arceus-Ghost a harder time than almost any other spinner if it carries Toxic. Unfortunately, Fire Blast leaves Arceus-Ghost walled by Tyranitar and cannot break Steel-types, such as bulky Excadrill and Arceus-Steel in the rain, so Arceus-Ghost will be reliant on Drought support when using it. Finally, Recover replenishes Arceus-Ghost's health, which is important for pulling off sweeps and repeatedly switching into deadly threats like Latios. However, Substitute can be used on offensive teams that lack a status absorber, as this fixes Arceus-Ghost's inherent weakness to status when slower threats attempt to poison or paralyze it.</p> <p>In general, the given EV spread is ideal because it allows Arceus-Ghost to switch in on the likes of Latias and Latios. Arceus-Ghost can do more than just spinblock and sweep; the ability to check most Psychic-types found in Ubers is a godsend for offensive teams. The HP investment allows Arceus-Ghost to do a great job of this, as it can eat a Draco Meteor even after switching into entry hazards and Recover off the damage before it can be struck again. Speed tying other Arceus formes can help win Calm Mind wars and perhaps prevent weakened support Arceus from crippling Arceus-Ghost with status, but an alternative EV spread with 176 Speed EVs still allows Arceus-Ghost to outrun Latias and Latios while investing some in Special Attack. Finally, Arceus-Ghost can maximize its Special Attack stat instead of HP. Though the immediate power is nice and allows Arceus-Ghost to OHKO most Ho-Oh at +1 after Stealth Rock damage, it causes Arceus-Ghost to lose the ability to switch in and check threats as reliably. For example, Latios has a chance to OHKO uninvested Arceus-Ghost after Stealth Rock and Spikes with Draco Meteor. With that said, any Arceus-Ghost that uses Substitute over Recover should use maximum Special Attack, as Substitute places emphasis on sweeping over checking threats.</p> <p>Be careful about switching Arceus-Ghost in to spinblock if you only have one layer of entry hazards up. Weigh risk versus reward when considering switching Arceus-Ghost into a spinner, because Toxic is a very common move on Forretress, Excadrill, and Tentacruel. You also risk a 2HKO by Kabutops in the rain, although Arceus-Ghost can easily switch into Cloyster, assuming it has taken Stealth Rock damage. Because Arceus-Ghost is such a deadly sweeper, it's often worth allowing a spin in exchange for keeping status off of Arceus-Ghost. If your opponent lacks a Arceus-Ghost, specially defensive Kyogre, Ho-Oh, or Darkrai, a healthy Arceus-Ghost will probably do good damage to your opponent's team. However, if you have two or more hazards up, it's usually worth sending Arceus-Ghost in, especially if it has not been revealed yet. Although a skilled opponent will assume you carry a Arceus-Ghost if you carry more than one hazard and lack a Giratina forme, they will have more incentive to click Rapid Spin anyway if hazards are accumulating on their side of the field.</p> <p>Knowing when to set up a Calm Mind and when to Recover or attack are similar to using other Calm Mind Arceus formes. Set up once your opponent's counters are gone and checks such as Skarmory and Kyogre are weakened. If your opponent has healthy counters such as Life Orb Ho-Oh or Roar Kyogre, setting up will be for naught. However, there's nothing wrong with setting up to cripple Arceus-Ghost soft checks, like Skarmory, forcing them to phaze Arceus-Ghost out and possibly be unable to check it again during the match.</p> <p>Keep Arceus-Ghost unrevealed for as long as possible. Not only might it be able to bait your opponent into wasting a turn attempting to spin hazards away, but it can also use Choice Scarf Terrakion's Close Combat as a free setup opportunity. Your opponent might become more willing to lose their best options versus Arceus-Ghost, such as Darkrai or Ho-Oh, if they do not know which Arceus forme you are using.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Terrakion is a terrific partner for Arceus-Ghost. It can absorb a Dark Void from Darkrai and/or outright revenge kill it, and it can deal massive damage to Chansey and Blissey. It also OHKOes Ho-Oh with Stone Edge. Genesect is another Choice Scarf user that works well with Arceus-Ghost, as the bug resists both of Arceus-Ghost's weaknesses and has the ability to revenge kill Darkrai with U-turn. Stealth Rock support is mandatory to help break Ho-Oh; Dialga and Tyranitar can reliably set up Stealth Rock while providing Dark- and Ghost-type resistances, while Arceus-Ghost checks Mewtwo for them, unless it switches in on a Life Orb-boosted Psystrike. Lum Berry Tyranitar deserves special mention for its ability to defeat both Darkrai and Ho-Oh. In return, Arceus-Ghost can switch in on Genesect that attempt to severely damage Tyranitar with U-turn. Status absorbers pair well with Arceus-Ghost, as it is vulnerable to all status. Specially defensive Kyogre deserves a special mention because it can check Darkrai and phaze Pokemon that can set up on Arceus-Ghost, like Arceus-Dark. Tentacruel can spin hazards away to help Arceus-Ghost set up, and absorbs the Toxic Spikes that Arceus-Ghost loathes so much. Finally, Swift Swim sweepers such as Kabutops and Omastar can revenge kill Darkrai and destroy Ho-Oh while serving as secondary win conditions.</p>"

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Support Arceus-Ghost is an excellent support Pokemon due to its combination of outstanding bulk, Speed, and typing. Arceus-Ghost is useful for far more than simply spinblocking; it can check and burn almost every physical attacker in the tier, as powerful physical Ghost and Dark moves are very rare in Ubers and Arceus-Ghost can tank neutral hits well. Like other Arceus-Ghost, it remains a solid answer to Psychic-type Pokemon too.</p> <p>Judgment is Arceus-Ghost's obligatory STAB move and hits most offensive Pokemon for decent damage, even without Special Attack investment. Recover is mandatory to replenish Arceus-Ghost's health, allowing it to repeatedly come in to spinblock and check the appropriate threats. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and helps wear down bulky Pokemon like Dialga without reliable recovery. There are a few options for the last move. Roar is a great option for phazing out setup sweepers, such as Calm Mind Arceus. It also racks up entry hazard damage, and Arceus-Ghost's typing ensures that hazards will stay up as long as it doesn't faint, making it a great user of the move. Alternatively, Flamethrower can be used on sun teams to destroy Forretress and Ferrothorn, preventing them from setting up a significant amount of hazards on Arceus-Ghost. Flamethrower also hits Excadrill hard, provided sun is up. It has little use outside of hitting these targets, however. Stone Edge can be used lure in and smack Ho-Oh if your team is weak to it, and Perish Song is an excellent move on stall teams to stop setup sweepers that are the last Pokemon standing.</p> <p>In general, maximizing Arceus-Ghost's bulk and Speed is ideal because doing so allows it to Recover off damage or cripple Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp before getting hit. However, there are a couple of alternative spreads. A 252 HP / 96 Def / 48 SpA / 112 Spe spread with a Timid nature is viable, as it allows Arceus-Ghost to survive an Earthquake from a +2 Life Orb Groudon while still being able to outspeed Palkia. Arceus-Ghost can also run maximum Defense to essentially counter all physical threats; this also makes switching into Mewtwo's Psystrike and weather sweepers easier. However, the significant loss of Speed means that fast Choice Specs Kyogre, Life Orb Reshiram, and other dangerous wallbreakers will outrun Arceus-Ghost.</p> <p>In general, Will-O-Wisp will be used more often than Judgment, as spreading burns will cause more damage to your opponent's team than Judgment. When using this variant of Arceus-Ghost, be aware that it invites Ho-Oh to come in for free unless Arceus-Ghost carries Stone Edge. If you see a Ho-Oh, consider utilizing double switches often so it does not use Arceus-Ghost as a means to attain free turns. This set hates Toxic, but unlike the Calm Mind set, this isn't used as a win condition and thus has an easier time coming in on Rapid Spin users. In fact, support Arceus-Ghost can spinblock for a long time, often for an entire match. Take advantage of this by using it on entry hazard-based teams, especially if Arceus-Ghost carries Roar. Arceus-Ghost is a threatening enough Pokemon in its own right to force switches, racking up further hazard damage.</p> <p>Like most support Arceus, this set does not require much support of its own. However, there are still potential teammates that can make its job a lot easier. For example, Tentacruel can absorb Toxic Spikes while providing Rapid Spin support. In return, Arceus-Ghost can check Mewtwo as long it is healthy. Pokemon that enjoy setting up on burned opponents, such as Double Dance Terrakion, also make good partners. Terrakion also resists Dark-type moves aimed at Arceus-Ghost, making it a good Arceus-Dark check. Finally, a Darkrai check such as specially defensive Kyogre or Choice Band Ho-Oh is mandatory.</p>"
      },
      "Anti-Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This variant of Arceus-Ghost has an excellent lead matchup versus most common leads, including Deoxys-S, Deoxys-A, Groudon, Skarmory, and Custap Berry Forretress. It also provides a Stealth Rock user that can wreck most spinners and all Magic Bounce users, making it a nightmare for Stealth Rock-weak teams to deal with. Judgment with maximum Special Attack investment supplies Arceus-Ghost with a powerful STAB attack, while Flamethrower roasts Forretress and Excadrill. Extreme Speed is extremely useful for holding Deoxys formes to one entry hazard after they have been brought down to their Focus Sash with Judgment. For the last moveslot, Stealth Rock is desirable because Arceus-Ghost has an easy time setting it up. However, one can opt for Magic Coat to further aggravate Deoxys formes and Forretress and foil attempts to status Arceus-Ghost, at the expense of wasting Arceus-Ghost's ability to laugh at Espeon and Xatu. Though it's risky to stay in against a Darkrai, Magic Coat can reflect back a predicted Dark Void as well. Magic Coat is also matchup reliant and there are games where you will not need it, whereas Stealth Rock is always reliable and mandatory on any viable Ubers team. Will-O-Wisp and Recover are viable options, but they are better left to the support set as this Arceus-Ghost is a dedicated lead. Finally, Fire Blast can be used over Flamethrower to OHKO Ferrothorn if rain is not up. Note that Arceus-Ghost can typically switch out and come back in once to spinblock its own hazard, even without Recover.</p> <p>Anti-lead Arceus-Ghost is an early-game Pokemon, so only use it on teams in need of a way to reliably deal with lead Deoxys formes. These teams must be able to pressure spinners because Arceus-Ghost might not be around to spinblock its own Stealth Rock. The EV spread for this set is simple: max out its Special Attack and Speed because it isn't designed to check attackers throughout the game. Arceus-Ghost also wants to hit spinners such as Tentacruel and bulky Excadrill as hard as it can with Judgment and Flamethrower, respectively, since they might attempt to wear Arceus-Ghost down in hopes of spinning later in the match. The damage output against other leads like Groudon is noticeable as well. While this Arceus-Ghost set is situational with high opportunity cost, it is so good at anti-leading many common threats that it's worth it for players who like getting off to strong starts.</p> <p>Darkrai is by far the worst lead match-up for Arceus-Ghost. Though Magic Coat variants can take a risk and attempt to reflect back a predicted Dark Void, this isn't reliable and can cause your team to start 6-5 if Darkrai chooses to attack. Pokemon that can handle lead Darkrai, such as RestTalk Kyogre and Lum Berry Dialga, are good ideas for teammates. Dialga is also a problem for Arceus-Ghost, as it can shrug off Arceus-Ghost's attacks while easily setting up its own Stealth Rock and wearing down Arceus-Ghost with its powerful attacks. Offensive Groudon is a good teammate since it can lead and OHKO Dialga. Tyranitar beats Arceus-Ghost 1-1 (despite fearing a potential Will-O-Wisp) and is also dealt with by Groudon. Finally, though not commonly used as a lead, Scarf Kyogre OHKOes Arceus-Ghost with Water Spout. Palkia can deal with Kyogre and pressure all common Rapid Spin users to help preserve Arceus-Ghost's Stealth Rock.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost is rarity in high-level play, and for good reason; it has many common counters and has mediocre STAB moves that lack either power or reliability. However, it is capable of defeating foes that check its other sets, such as Ho-Oh and specially defensive Kyogre. Shadow Force allows Arceus-Ghost to hit harder than other Swords Dance Arceus formes, but can be played around due to its charge turn, especially if your opponent has a Normal-type. Swords Dance boosts Arceus-Ghost's Attack stat to a whopping 778 in just one turn of setup, allowing Shadow Force to hit extremely hard. Though Arceus-Ghost's other moves are not nearly as dangerous, Brick Break and Earthquake are still necessary to hit Steel-types. Brick Break is preferred to smack Ferrothorn and Extreme Killer Arceus, but Earthquake gets a stronger hit on Pokemon like Arceus-Steel and Dialga. Finally, Shadow Claw might seem redundant with Shadow Force, but it is necessary to foil Substitute users such as Lugia and makes it harder for the opponent to play around Arceus-Ghost mid-game.</p> <p>Though Arceus-Ghost has some other moves at its disposal, they are almost entirely outclassed. Recover can be used to give Arceus-Ghost longevity, but the combination of Shadow Force and Brick Break can be easily played around, especially early on in the game. Extreme Speed is an awful option due to its severe lack of power and does not threaten even modestly healthy Choice Scarf users, even after a Swords Dance boost. Also bear in mind that any Arceus-Ghost using a Swords Dance / Shadow Claw / Brick Break / Extreme Speed set will be completely helpless against defensive teams, as it cannot even dent its counters with these weak moves. Overheat can be used over physical coverage to destroy Ferrothorn and Scizor, but is extremely weather-reliant.</p> <p>In general, you should max out Attack and Speed as Arceus-Ghost needs all the power and speed it can get to have a shot at dealing major damage. An alternative Adamant spread with 212 Speed is viable to further increase Arceus-Ghost's damage output, but this leaves Arceus-Ghost vulnerable to burns. Unlike Swords Dance Arceus-Ground and Extreme Killer Arceus, this set does not have the luxury of packing significant bulk since it lacks Arceus-Ground's ability to easily fit Recover in its moveset and Extreme Killer's STAB priority.</p> <p>Conserve Arceus-Ghost for as long as possible because it usually does not run Recover and is weak to all forms of status, so it gets few opportunities to switch in. It can come in on Arceus-Fighting and Terrakion if need be, but beware of Toxic. Set up with Arceus-Ghost as soon as you get it in, unless you need it to revenge kill something like a 30% health Extreme Killer Arceus. The reason for this is because Arceus-Ghost will not find repeated opportunities to set up throughout the match due to its lack of bulk. It's up to the user to be responsible when using this set, so don't set up with Arceus-Ghost when the opponent still has a healthy counter.</p> <p>A major weakness of this set is how badly it loses to Pain Split Forretress, so this Arceus-Ghost does not spinblock it as effectively as the Calm Mind variant. The lack of bulk means that it fares worse against Cloyster, Excadrill, and Kabutops as well, though it does fare better against Tentacruel barring a Scald burn. Because this Arceus-Ghost variant does not spinblock as effectively as nearly any other spinblocker, do not use it on teams that rely significantly on entry hazards. Also, spinblock only if it is absolutely necessary; Arceus-Ghost functions more as more of a late-game cleaner than anything else.</p> <p>Though Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost is a standalone sweeper that happens to possess the ability to spinblock, there a few good partners for it. Double Dance Groudon can help wear down most of its checks, such as Hippowdon and support Arceus formes. Alternatively, Rock Polish Groudon with a Fire move can lure in Forretress and Skarmory, though skilled opponents will not switch these Pokemon into Groudon very often. Mixed Rayquaza can break through walls like Groudon and severely weaken support Arceus. Finally, Choice Band Zekrom possesses the ability to destroy almost all defensive walls commonly found in Ubers, paving the way for a potential Arceus-Ghost sweep. Bear in mind that this Arceus-Ghost offers its teammates little support of its own, outside of the admittedly important niche of spinblocking.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Marvel at The Creator's endless masterpiece unfathomable to human mind: His thousand arms are sent forth like the branches of His Meadow Plate. As the unwavering protector for the creations that He Himself has shaped, Arceus-Grass is perhaps the most supportive forme. He can provide boundless amounts of utility, for He is not only an excellent answer to the prevalent Groudon and Kyogre but also to the fearsome might of Excadrill, Kabutops, Kingdra, Manaphy, Palkia, Rayquaza, and Zekrom. With His marvelous resistances to Electric-, Grass-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks, He can act as a brilliant defensive pivot under rain. Unfortunately, the many talents of The Creator are not reflected elsewhere. His STAB Grass-type attacks have dismal offensive coverage, which leaves Him a liability against many of the Spikers and phazers that thrive in the Uber tier. His weaknesses to Bug-, Fire-, Flying-, Ice-, and Poison-type attacks can also prove problematic. However, despite these harsh conditions, The Creator has continued to flourish as does the life He created long ago.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Both Ice Beam and Earth Power can be used alongside Arceus-Grass's Grass-type STAB attacks, and Recover dropped for a more offensive Calm Mind Arceus-Grass. However, due to its poor STAB coverage and useful resistances, Arceus-Grass is better as a more defensive Pokemon. Will-O-Wisp can be used in the last slot on the support set, but is generally not as effective, as Arceus-Grass's main counters—Fire-types—are immune to it. Roar can be used on the last slot on the support set as well if you already have a Pokemon to set up Stealth Rock and do not care about spreading paralysis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ho-Oh is hands down one of the best counters to Arceus-Grass, as it is able to take all of Arceus-Grass's attacks and hit back with a powerful Sacred Fire. Other counters depend on Arceus-Grass's choice of coverage move: if using Ice Beam, Arceus-Fire, Reshiram, and Heatran will all wall Arceus-Grass, while Ho-Oh, Lugia, Salamence, Rayquaza, Giratina-O, and Arceus-Bug do the same if Earth Power is used. Blaziken can use Protect to boost its Speed and mow down Arceus-Grass with Flare Blitz, which does a meaty 92.3% - 109.5%, a sure OHKO after Stealth Rock. Arceus-Grass also needs to watch out for Victini, as Choice Scarf variants can outspeed and OHKO Arceus-Grass with V-create. Scizor laughs at all of Arceus-Grass's moves, and can dish out a large amount of damage with U-turn. In sunlight, Mewtwo can easily OHKO Arceus-Grass with Fire Blast. Lastly, Chansey and Blissey can easily stall out Arceus-Grass with a combination of Toxic and Soft-Boiled, while even boosted Judgment does meager damage to the duo.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Although it is rather lacking in coverage and is resisted by a variety of Pokemon, Grass is defensively among the very best types in Ubers, as it provides coveted resistances to Water-, Ground-, and Electric-type attacks. Arceus-Grass's wonderful bulk and blazing Speed, combined with these key resistances, make it a near-unstoppable Calm Mind user in Ubers. Thanks to these aforementioned resistances, Arceus-Grass should have no difficulty getting off a Calm Mind. One of the biggest dilemmas when using Arceus-Grass is whether to use Grass Knot or Judgment; the former is stronger against foes that weigh more than 100 kg, and has greater PP to boot. As this group includes most of the Pokemon commonly seen in the Uber tier, Grass Knot is usually the preferred choice. However, it must be noted that Manaphy in particular takes a pittance from Grass Knot and can threaten Arceus-Grass with a Tail Glow-boosted Ice Beam. Ice Beam allows Arceus-Grass to deal with Salamence, Rayquaza, Latias, Latios, Zekrom, and Giratina-O, but leaves it vulnerable to Fire- and Steel-types. In particular, Ho-Oh, Reshiram, and Dialga, although neutral to Ice Beam, can take the attack with ease and smack Arceus-Grass with their STAB attacks. Earth Power, on the other hand, lets Arceus-Grass take out Reshiram, Zekrom, Heatran, and Dialga, as well as other grounded Steel-types. However, it leaves Arceus-Grass vulnerable to Lugia, as well as most Dragon-types. Recover gives Arceus-Grass reliable recovery, making it very hard to kill outside of a super effective hit.</p> <p>The given EVs and nature allow Arceus-Grass to take full advantage of its fantastic bulk and Speed. In terms of other moves, Arceus-Grass can use Substitute over Recover in order to protect itself from status and thereby beat a certain pink blob named Blissey. In most cases, though, Recover is the superior option, because it does more in the way of keeping Arceus-Grass alive.</p> <p>Water-types make excellent teammates for Arceus-Grass, as they cover each other's weaknesses well. The best examples are Kyogre, who summons rain to weaken Fire-type attacks, and Palkia, who is doubly resistant to Fire-type moves. Like most other Calm Mind variants of Arceus, Arceus-Grass is also plagued by a massive weakness to Ho-Oh. In fact, Arceus-Grass is perhaps the Arceus variant that most fears Ho-Oh, as both of its STAB moves destroy Arceus-Grass easily, while Ice Beam does pitiful damage even after a boost. For this reason, Stealth Rock is recommended to stop Ho-Oh. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock and also has good synergy with Arceus-Grass. However, its Fire-type STAB moves will be weakened if Kyogre is on the team, so keep that in mind.</p>"

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Arceus-Grass's important resistances, incredible bulk, and high Speed allow it to function as a fantastic supporter. Recover ensures that it will be around for a long time, and effectively increases Arceus-Grass's bulk. Grass Knot is recommended over Judgment because most of the common Pokemon in Ubers take more damage from Grass Knot. Grass Knot also has more PP than Judgment, which can be useful considering the ubiquity of Pressure users. The choice between Ice Beam and Earth Power depends on which foes you want Arceus-Grass to hit harder. Ice Beam destroys Dragon-types such as Zekrom, Garchomp, Rayquaza, and Giratina, while Earth Power helps against Heatran and Reshiram. In the last slot, Thunder Wave is recommended as Arceus-Grass is an effective paralysis spreader, because it scares off Ground-types such as Groudon and Garchomp. Stealth Rock is also a viable option if none of its teammates can set it up; lastly, Magic Coat allows Arceus-Grass to bounce back status moves and entry hazards such as Stealth Rock, making it a great lead.</p> <p>112 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Arceus-Grass to outrun maximum Speed Garchomp, while 252 HP EVs maximize Arceus-Grass's overall bulk. The rest of the EVs are placed in Special Defense, as Water- and Electric-type attacks are commonly specially based. A Calm nature can be used, as it lets Arceus-Grass avoid the 2HKO from unboosted Kyogre's Ice Beam.</p> <p>Water-types make very good teammates. Kyogre and Palkia both deserve special mentions, with the former negating Arceus-Grass's Fire-type weakness with Drizzle, and the latter packing a quadruple resistance to Fire-type moves. As Ho-Oh laughs at this set, Stealth Rock support is an absolute necessity. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock easily, and has great defensive synergy with Arceus-Grass.</p>"

The dreams of the once-idealistic Zekrom are left in shattered remains, for the power of countless defeated giants is infused within Arceus-Ground; with an immunity to Electric-type attacks, a resistance to Stealth Rock, and very good bulk, there is no finer counter than He. Although His creation Groudon has greater Defense and Drought, the imposing Arceus-Ground holds the higher ground thanks to His superior overall bulk, Speed, and Recover. Indeed, the lack of Drought might prove a blessing, as it allows Him to act as an impressive offensive pivot under rain. For the very earth yields before His immense strength; Arceus-Ground can break the ground asunder Him with His Swords Dance and Calm Mind set or stand as a sturdy wall through His support set. It is true, nonetheless, that His earthly state leaves Him vulnerable to the common Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks. However, these efforts are all in vain, for no elemental attack can stop His rise once it has begun.</p>",

The most dangerous of them is the Choice Scarf variant, because it can outspeed Arceus-Ground and revenge kill it. However, Kyogre must be wary of locking itself into Water Spout as it is 2HKOed by Extreme Speed, and after a +2 Extreme Speed, Water Spout is incapable of OHKOing Arceus-Ground.</p> <p>Swords Dance Arceus-Ground can be countered by burning it. Once inflicted with a burn, Arceus-Ground becomes dead weight for the rest of the match. Pokemon such as Giratina and Mewtwo can both burn Arceus-Ground. Additionally, Darkrai can outspeed Arceus-Ground and put it to sleep using Dark Void. Shaymin-S, Arceus-Grass, Skarmory, Giratina-O, and Bronzong are all good counters to Swords Dance Arceus-Ground; Bronzong however needs to carry Toxic to be able to effectively damage Arceus-Ground. Skarmory and Bronzong must also be careful of Gravity as it makes them vulnerable to Arceus-Ground's STAB Earthquake. Pokemon such as Blissey, Chansey, and Ho-Oh are all good counters to the Calm Mind set.</p>",

After 2 Calm Minds, Arceus-Ground's Special Attack reaches an impressive 554 whiles its Special Defense sits at an excellent 552. Arceus-Ground will almost always be able to set up over 2 Calm Minds thanks to its bulk and access to recovery. Once Arceus-Ground has properly set up, it can proceed to wreak havoc on the opponent's team. Judgment is the main STAB move of choice and its Ground typing possesses great neutral coverage. The coverage is well-rounded off by Ice Beam, and with these two moves Arceus-Ground hits most of the Uber tier super effectively; notable mentions include Reshiram, Zekrom, Giratina, Shaymin, Groudon, Lugia, Rayquaza, and Garchomp. Bronzong is the only semi-common Pokemon who resists Arceus-Ground's Ground and Ice combo. A fully set-up Arceus-Ground is almost impossible to switch into, and the only way to take it down is through either super effective attacks or a critical hit. Access to Recover increases Arceus-Ground's longevity and effectively doubles its bulk, allowing it to set up more Calm Minds.</p> <p>Maximum investment in HP lets Arceus-Ground take hits better and significantly increases its already great bulk, while maximum investment in Speed enables Arceus-Ground to outpace most of the Uber tier and tie with opposing Arceus-Ground, which can be the deciding factor in a game. Arceus-Ground can run a more offensive EV spread of 132 HP / 252 SpA / 124 Spe to outspeed positive natured base 90 Speed Pokemon, such as Zekrom and Reshiram, and to do more damage after fewer boosts. While this spread trades bulk for power, it should be kept in mind that more investment in HP allows Arceus-Ground to set up more easily, increasing the chances of a sweep.</p> <p>Arceus-Ground is the best counter to Choice Zekrom, as Arceus-Ground switches in freely on a predicted Bolt Strike, threatens a super effective STAB Judgment, and can set up as Zekrom flees; as such, Pokemon threatened by Zekrom appreciate Arceus-Ground covering their backs. Conversely, the biggest counter to this set is Choice Scarf Kyogre. It can easily revenge Arceus-Ground thanks to its great Speed and OHKO it with a rain-boosted STAB Water Spout. Variants of Arceus packing moves that hit Arceus-Ground super effectively can somewhat check Arceus-Ground. However, Arceus-Electric and other types of Arceus who are hit super effectively by the Ground / Ice combination need to be wary of switching into the wrong move, and are hence not true counters.</p> <p>Shaymin-S is a good counter; Life Orb variants can switch into Judgment and OHKO Arceus-Ground with a speedy super effective Seed Flare. If Shaymin-S packs Leaf Storm, it is capable of OHKOing Arceus-Ground even without a boosting item, provided that Arceus-Ground has yet to bag a Calm Mind boost. Choice Specs Shaymin-S OHKOes even a +1 SpD Arceus-Ground. Palkia and Ferrothorn are both good partners to Arceus-Ground. Both resist Water-type moves while Ferrothorn has the added benefit of resisting Grass-type attacks. Palkia can switch into a fully powered Choice Specs Water Spout from Kyogre thanks to its 4x resistance to Water-type attacks. Ferrothorn can take a Seed Flare from Shaymin-S with ease and KO with Gyro Ball or paralyze it. Once paralyzed, Shaymin-S is no longer a threat to Arceus-Ground.</p> <p>Pokemon with sky-high HP and Special Defense are all good counters to Arceus-Ground. Blissey, Chansey, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Grass all come to mind immediately. Arceus-Ground would be hard pressed to 2HKO the former two without a critical hit; they can Toxic Arceus and stall out poison damage. Ho-Oh laughs at any of Arceus-Ground's moves and 2HKOes Arceus-Ground with the sun up. Arceus-Grass is resistant to Arceus-Ground's STAB Judgment, and Ice Beam will not take it down easily; it can proceed to set up Calm Minds, heal off the damage with Recover, and OHKO Arceus-Ground with a STAB Grass Knot.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Arceus-Ground can run a physical set with as much grace and ease as a special set. Recover allows Arceus-Ground to use its great bulk, particularly as a Zekrom counter, while Swords Dance enables Arceus-Ground to boost its already great Attack stat to astronomical levels. The two also work in tandem: Arceus-Ground's great natural bulk and 120 / 120 / 120 defenses ensure that it will almost always be able to notch up a Swords Dance. Access to reliable recovery is something Groudon would die for, and it is a major reason to consider Arceus-Ground over Groudon. After a single Swords Dance, Arceus-Ground reaches a mammoth 744 Attack; combined with the awesome coverage provided by its attacks, Arceus-Ground becomes very hard to switch into. Most of the Uber tier is OHKOed or 2HKOed by either Earthquake or Stone Edge. After a single Swords Dance, standard Rock Polish Groudon takes 81.6% - 96.2% from an Adamant Arceus-Ground's Earthquake. The only Pokemon who resist the EdgeQuake combo are Bronzong, Breloom, and Virizion, all of whom are rarely seen in Ubers. Maximum investment in Speed makes sure that Arceus-Ground outspeeds most of the Uber tier and ties with other positive-natured Arceus.</p> <p>Swords Dance Arceus-Ground is one of those Pokemon who can run multiple EV spreads quite well. The EV spread listed above allows Arceus-Ground to tank hits efficiently, so it can easily set up a Swords Dance; however, a more offensive spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe can be used. The loss in bulk is actually counteracted by the fact that the extra power helps Arceus to hit much harder. A Jolly nature can also be used with an EV spread of 144 HP / 252 Atk / 114 Spe to allow Arceus-Ground to outspeed Jolly non-Choice Scarf Garchomp and KO it. An Adamant nature can be used, but Arceus-Ground usually prefers to maximize its Speed to tie with other Arceus variants. Extreme Speed can be run in place of Recover. Forgoing Recover is not recommended though, as Arceus-Ground enjoys the extra longevity that Recover grants it; it is also a major advantage that Arceus-Ground has over Groudon.</p> <p>Swords Dance Arceus-Ground prefers Stealth Rock and Spikes support as they convert important 3HKOs into 2HKOs and 2HKOs into OHKOs. Pokemon such as Deoxys, Forretress, Groudon, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory are able to set up entry hazards reliably and all make good partners for Arceus-Ground. Giratina is an excellent counter to Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, as it is immune to Extreme Speed and can burn Arceus-Ground, rendering it useless for the rest of the game. Giratina-O is also a good counter, being immune to Earthquake thanks to its Levitate ability; however, it takes a hefty 51.2% - 60.3% from Stone Edge, which is a 2HKO. Like most other physical attackers, Swords Dance Arceus-Ground is walled by Skarmory. The physically defensive variant is never 2HKOed by +2 Stone Edge and can simply Toxic Arceus-Ground. If Arceus-Ground gets greedy and tries to get more boosts, Skarmory can just Whirlwind it out. Bronzong, though rare, is one of the few Pokemon resistant to the EdgeQuake combo; it can Toxic Arceus-Ground or whittle down its HP with Grass Knot. Shaymin-S is not OHKOed by +2 Extreme Speed and OHKOes in return with Seed Flare. Arceus-Grass can take Earthquakes and Stone Edges with ease thanks to its bulk and useful resistances. A Grass Knot from Arceus-Grass will make manure out of Arceus-Ground.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Arceus-Ground's fantastic natural bulk and access to reliable recovery in the form of Recover allows it to pull off a pure support set. This set aims to utilize Arceus-Ground's 120 / 120 / 120 defenses to provide essential team support. Arceus-Ground's huge support movepool and near-perfect coverage provided by Earthquake and Stone Edge make sure that nothing can bring Arceus-Ground to a grinding halt. Will-O-Wisp is the bread and butter of this set and cripples physical attackers, such as Groudon, Scizor, Rayquaza, Garchomp, and most notably, Extreme Killer Arceus. Recover grants Arceus-Ground more longevity and makes tanking hits even easier.</p> <p>Though this set functions very similarly to Giratina, Arceus-Ground has many perks over the ghostly dragon. Arceus-Ground lacks Dragon- and Dark-type weaknesses, which is a huge boon in Ubers. Arceus-Ground can also switch into Zekrom with impunity, which is something Giratina could never hope to achieve. Maximum investment in HP makes sure Arceus-Ground can tank hits very well, while the Speed EVs allow Arceus-Ground to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Terrakion and burn it; all base 90 Speed Pokemon, including Zekrom, are outsped as well. Additionally, Arceus-Ground can OHKO Choice Specs Reshiram before Reshiram can kill it with Blue Flare. All in all, Arceus-Ground's stellar Speed and access to reliable recovery are its main advantages over traditional walls such as Groudon and Giratina-A. Nonetheless, it must be noted that Groudon gives this set stiff competition with its slightly better physical bulk, infinite sunlight, and Dragon Tail for phazing.</p> <p>Arceus-Ground is capable of setting up Stealth Rock if necessary. However, it should be kept in mind that Will-O-Wisp is generally the better option as it allows Arceus-Ground to maim physical attackers and take physical hits better. Substitute is an option if Arceus-Ground is worried about status; it also allows Arceus to scout for counters.</p> <p>This set is countered by Arceus-Grass as well, especially Substitute variants. Arceus-Grass is resistant to Earthquake and can set up in Arceus-Ground's face, then KO it with a STAB super effective Grass-type Judgment. Like the other Arceus-Ground sets, this set is plagued by Kyogre, especially Choice Scarf variants.</p>"

  "Arceus-Ice": {
    "overview": "<p>Returning from the desolate wastelands of afar, Arceus shows His frigid side, His heart as cold as the Icicle Plate He bears. Being perhaps the most offensively inclined forme of them all, Arceus-Ice takes no prisoners in the kill-or-be-killed world of Ubers. His STAB Ice-type attacks have excellent coverage; most Dragon-, Ground-, Flying-, and Grass-types will fall beneath His power. He benefits from not only hail but also rain and sun, a feat few formes of His can rival. Although Kyurem-W and Kyurem-B have dual STABs and drastically increased power, Arceus-Ice has superior Speed, bulk, and the ability to utilize Calm Mind. However, in His frosty guise, Arceus-Ice cannot boast a strong defensive typing as a weakness to Stealth Rock limits His walling potential. His cold decision rids Him of any resistance save one to Ice and grants Him horrible weaknesses to Fighting-, Fire-, Rock-, and Steel-type attacks. Even so, if one has the misfortune to face Arceus-Ice in battle, unless your body is as solid as steel or your soul as searing as the sun, you might never again feel the warmth of a new day.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower is a more reliable way to hit Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Scizor, but the drop in power from Fire Blast makes it slightly inferior in most cases. Surf can be used in the rain to beat opposing Fire-types, but it is not of much use otherwise. Arceus-Ice can learn many useful support moves including status-inducing moves, Perish Song, Stealth Rock, and dual screens, but with Ice's lack of resistances, practically every other Arceus forme outclasses Arceus-Ice in this regard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Steel-types are some of the biggest threats to Arceus-Ice. Arceus-Steel can easily set up on Arceus-Ice and force it out with its own Judgment or Roar. Scizor can easily switch into a Judgment and threaten it with Bullet Punch. Without Fire Blast, Forretress and Ferrothorn can lay down entry hazards while threatening Arceus-Ice with Gyro Ball or, in Ferrothorn's case, Thunder Wave. Heatran can comfortably wall all of Arceus-Ice's attacks except Focus Blast while threatening it with devastating Fire-type attacks, particularly outside of rain. In fact, just about all threats that are not weak to Ice-type moves and pack a Fire-type attack will be in a position to force Arceus-Ice out if the sun is up; examples include Ho-Oh, Mewtwo, Reshiram, Palkia, and Arceus-Fire. In general, other Arceus formes who are not weak to Ice-type attacks can win a Calm Mind war if they have Recover, Focus Blast or Fire Blast, or a super effective Judgment. It almost goes without saying that Chansey and Blissey are able to switch in, cripple Arceus-Ice with a status condition, and stall it to death with their insane special bulk. Terrakion can switch into a Fire Blast and pulverize Arceus-Ice with Close Combat or Stone Edge. Darkrai easily outspeeds Arceus-Ice and can neutralize it with a combination of Dark Void and Focus Blast. As a last note, the humble Shedinja takes no damage at all from any attack except Fire Blast.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>This set is probably the best that Arceus-Ice can manage. If it can get a Calm Mind boost and emerge more or less unscathed, you can reap the sweet rewards of its Ice-type STAB. Judgment and Ice Beam are both valid options as Arceus-Ice's main attacking move. Judgment is the standard for specially based Arceus-Ice, as it combines 100% accuracy with solid power. Ice Beam has the same accuracy and PP, but it sacrifices a mere 5 Base Power for the added 10% chance to freeze outside of strong sunlight. The difference is often negligible, and the choice depends on whether you are more comfortable increasing the chance of key KOs or banking on a rare freeze. Thunder's main purpose is to damage opposing Kyogre, but it's also useful against Ho-Oh in rain. Fire Blast and Focus Blast are for hitting Steel-types; the choice between the two depends mostly on whether you can provide it with sun support. Recover can also be useful for healing off damage from entry hazards and enemies' attacks, making it easier to switch in multiple times.</p> <p>Its mono-Ice typing is quite the burden for a setup sweeper such as Arceus-Ice. Unfortunately, Arceus-Ice's resistance to Ice-type attacks, immunity to hail damage, and inability to be frozen are completely overshadowed by its weaknesses to Rock-, Fighting-, Fire-, and Steel-type attacks, as well as its severe vulnerability to entry hazards. On the bright side, however, Ice has excellent coverage in the Uber tier, hitting Dragon-, Ground-, Flying-, and Grass-types for super effective damage. Arceus-Ice generally fares better as a late-game sweeper than as a boosting tank because of its inability to switch into resisted moves. The EVs allow Arceus-Ice to hit as hard as possible while Speed tying with other offensive Arceus, but a Modest nature can be also used for that extra touch of power. With a Modest nature, Arceus-Ice misses out on outpacing Lugia and Speed-tying with other Arceus, though Lugia fears Ice-type attacks and Arceus-Ice loses to many common Arceus formes anyway.</p> <p>Arceus-Ice can fit into both sun teams and rain teams. Groudon is a fantastic partner to Arceus-Ice, boasting impressive Defense and the ability to set up permanent sunshine. Arceus-Ice can take advantage of sun's boost to Fire Blast, but sun aggravates its weakness to Fire-type attacks. With Kyogre support instead, Arceus-Ice effectively loses this weakness to Fire-type attacks, and Thunder is a more reliable attack to hurt Ho-Oh with. However, Fire Blast loses its effectiveness in rain. Nevertheless, Focus Blast is a decent coverage option, and Recover allows Arceus-Ice to acquire multiple Calm Mind boosts against Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Palkia and other Arceus. Additionally, with rain support, Ice Beam can replace Judgment. The 10% freeze chance can easily be the deciding factor in a game, and the 5 Base Power drop is not always noticeable. Judgment is still generally a better option, though, because of the increased chance to KO several major threats, and it is equally useful in any weather. Here are some calculations to illustrate the power difference of Judgment and Ice Beam in some key situations:</p> <ul> <li>Ice Beam vs. 252/0 Groudon 95.5% - 112.9% (74% chance to OHKO)</li> <li>Judgment vs. 252/0 Groudon 101.0% - 118.8%</li> <li>Ice Beam vs. 4/0 Zekrom 103.5% - 111.1%</li> <li>Ice Beam vs. 252/0 Zekrom 87.6% - 103.0% (15% chance to OHKO)</li> <li>Judgment vs. 252/0 Zekrom 92.1% - 108.2% (46% chance to OHKO)</li> <li>Ice Beam vs. 248/252+ Giratina 44.5% - 52.9% (81% chance to 2HKO after Stealth Rock and Leftovers)</li> <li>Judgment vs. 248/252+ Giratina 46.9% - 55.3% (guaranteed 2HKO after Stealth Rock and Leftovers)</li> </ul>"

    "overview": "<p>To gaze before the virulent Arceus-Poison is to look within your inner evil, for within His repugnant Toxic Plate lies all our sins remembered. His entrance onto the battlefield is so abhorrent that all Toxic Spikes are absorbed; this act alone makes Him a remarkable supporter. The heinous Toxic, commonly used by supposedly pure Pokemon like Blissey and Chansey, is futile against a boosting Arceus-Poison, for all despicable acts are useless against the collector of sins Himself. Unfortunately, our wrongs are so repulsive that His STAB Poison-type attacks are simply atrocious. Additionally, although His unusual resistances to Bug-, Grass-, Fighting-, and Poison-type attacks provide considerable defensive utility, His weaknesses to Ground- and Psychic-type attacks do not. But all too easy is it to assume Arceus-Poison is the enemy, when in reality the enemy is within you.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Two changes can be considered on the support set: first, Judgment or Sludge Bomb can replace Ice Beam or Flamethrower for a stronger attack, but having a Poison-type move as Arceus-Poison's only attack is horrible in Ubers. Second, Thunder Wave or Toxic can be used over Will-O-Wisp, but Will-O-Wisp's ability to cripple Arceus-Poison's biggest threats in Groudon and Garchomp makes it the superior choice. Finally, Earthquake can be used to eliminate Heatran in one hit.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mewtwo is definitely a huge threat to Arceus-Poison, as it is able to switch into any of Arceus-Poison's unboosted moves, and Psystrike OHKOes the Calm Mind set and 2HKOes the support one. Mewtwo can even set up its own Calm Minds while taking little damage, threatening not only to destroy Arceus-Poison, but also to take out your entire team. Additionally, Will-O-Wisp will not even cripple Mewtwo as it is specially offensive. Heatran and other Steel-types are a pain for Arceus-Poison because it will have to rely on Focus Blast's shaky accuracy in order to take care of them. Arceus-Steel is especially notable as not only can it set up Calm Mind boosts alongside Arceus-Poison, it can also use Roar to phaze Arceus-Poison out. However, Arceus-Steel risks being OHKOed by Fire Blast in the sun, or a +1 Focus Blast. Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Psychic are also great counters, as they can strike Arceus-Poison hard with their super effective STAB moves and KO without boosts; Arceus-Ground also resists Arceus-Poison's STAB.</p> <p>Groudon can shatter Arceus-Poison's thick hide with a mighty Earthquake; both Rock Polish and Choice Band Groudon will always OHKO non-support Arceus-Poison with Earthquake, but must avoid Will-O-Wisp. In a similar manner, Garchomp can pose a threat if Arceus-Poison lacks Ice Beam or Will-O-Wisp, as Choice Scarf Garchomp will 2HKO with Earthquake. Excadrill is immune to Arceus-Poison's STAB, but must be wary of Fire Blast or Focus Blast. In sandstorm, however, it outspeeds Arceus-Poison and can OHKO Calm Mind variants with a super effective Earthquake. Reshiram and Kyogre can OHKO the support set with their mighty STAB attacks, as well as the Calm Mind set without too many boosts. Calm Mind Kyogre can set up alongside Arceus-Poison and win the war with its superior special stats and weather-boosted attacks. Ho-Oh can smash Arceus-Poison with its mighty Sacred Fire or repeated Brave Birds while laughing off most attacks, but Ho-Oh will not enjoy facing support variants packing Roar and Stealth Rock, because Ho-Oh absolutely hates taking Stealth Rock damage.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Arceus-Poison's main advantage over its other formes is the ability to remove the dreaded Toxic Spikes; for that reason alone, it makes a fantastic supporter. With access to a reliable healing move in Recover, as well as great support moves, Arceus-Poison can stall out multiple threats. Furthermore, thanks to its Poison typing, Arceus-Poison can swallow any Fighting-type move from the likes of Terrakion, Heracross, and Lucario. Will-O-Wisp is a great move that helps Arceus-Poison weaken its opponents while severely crippling physical attackers, while Reflect never misses and halves damage to the team from physical attacks for five turns. Roar fits well in the final slot to prevent your opponent from setting up, and racks up residual damage; alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used if nothing else on your team can set it up. As Arceus-Poison usually doesn't need coverage moves on this set, Perish Song can be used instead to ensure victory over endgame sweepers, provided it can stall out at least three turns.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp is the preferred status move because this set is geared to counter physical sweepers such as Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost and Rayquaza. Though Toxic and Thunder Wave both have their merits, Will-O-Wisp has the advantage of crippling the feared Choice Band Groudon, who would otherwise stomp Arceus-Poison to pieces. Ice Beam's utility and coverage in Ubers make it the primary choice for an attack. It also deters Groudon from switching in, while OHKOing both Rayquaza and Garchomp. Flamethrower prevents Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory from setting up on Arceus-Poison for free.</p> <p>Arceus-Poison's main niche is to absorb Toxic Spikes; it is very hard to stop it from doing so. However, there are some Pokemon that are especially disruptive to Arceus-Poison. Mewtwo is this set's nemesis, as Arceus-Poison will be forced to fire very weak Ice Beams at it, and risk getting smashed by a super effective Psystrike. A great way of dealing with Mewtwo is Giratina-O, whose Shadow Sneak can wear down Mewtwo rather quickly. Lugia, and Giratina are also fine checks to Mewtwo. Heatran will wall Arceus-Poison easily due to its unique typing, so you will need a Ground-type such as Garchomp to take care of it with a powerful Earthquake. Reshiram can roast Heatran with Blue Flare thanks to Turboblaze while laughing at Heatran's Flamethrower.</p> <p>Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory make great teammates for this Arceus-Poison as it will be forcing a lot of switches, which the aforementioned Pokemon can take advantage of by laying down entry hazards of their own. Reshiram can easily threaten Arceus-Poison with an immensely powerful Blue Flare, while Kyogre can drown Arceus-Poison easily with a mighty Water Spout, making Palkia a great teammate: Palkia can come in on Blue Flare and Water Spout thanks to its resistances, and threaten Reshiram and Kyogre with Draco Meteor and Thunder, respectively. Choice Band Groudon can OHKO Arceus-Poison with its enormously powerful Earthquake, and even with Will-O-Wisp, Arceus-Poison should not try staying in on offensive Groudon. Giratina, Skarmory, and Lugia should be considered as partners to handle offensive Groudon. Chansey and Blissey are natural partners to any physical wall, Arceus-Poison included, as Arceus-Poison will greatly appreciate Wish support and a teammate to absorb powerful special attacks for it.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Poison-type moves are resisted by four types, not including Steel, while only hitting rarely-seen Grass-types super effectively. However, Arceus-Poison's immunity to Poison-type moves, especially Toxic, allows it to set up on both Chansey and Blissey with impunity. Apart from absorbing Toxic Spikes, this set plays identically to almost every other Arceus forme's Calm Mind set.</p> <p>The choice between Sludge Bomb or Judgment is up to the user. Sludge Bomb is the preferred attack, because it exchanges only 10 Base Power for a 30% chance of poison, which could secure victory in a Calm Mind war. However, this poison chance might backfire. For example, if a physical attacker such as Extreme Killer Arceus switches in and gets poisoned, Arceus-Poison will no longer be able to cripple it with a burn; this makes Judgment a very solid option. Judgment also has more Base Power, but that's subsidiary, as this set does not focus on immediate power. Focus Blast is recommended in the third slot due to its ability to hit most Steel-types for super effective damage. Fire Blast is another option to roast Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory in one blast, but in exchange, Arceus-Poison loses the ability to smack Dialga hard, and Heatran is now immune to both of its moves. Ice Beam, on the other hand, trades coverage on Steel-types for a hard hit on the plethora of Dragon-types in Ubers, most notably Giratina, who resists Sludge Bomb.</p> <p>Arceus-Poison greatly appreciates Groudon removed before it attempts to sweep, as the standard Rock Polish Groudon will always OHKO Arceus-Poison with Earthquake, while Arceus-Poison needs two Calm Minds under its belt to OHKO with Ice Beam, or five Calm Minds to guarantee an OHKO with Focus Blast. Lugia makes a fantastic partner for Arceus-Poison by resisting Psychic- and Ground-type moves, and Lugia can wall any Groudon set with a combination of Reflect and Roost. Wobbuffet is a great teammate for Calm Mind Arceus-Poison, as with Encore, it can almost guarantee a free Calm Mind boost for Arceus-Poison while your opponent switches out. Wobbuffet greatly appreciates Arceus-Poison removing Toxic Spikes. If Ice Beam is chosen over Focus Blast, Magnezone makes a great teammate, trapping and killing off the Steel-types that wall Arceus-Poison, though Magnezone needs Hidden Power Fire to eliminate Ferrothorn. Cresselia is also a decent partner as it provides useful resistances to Arceus-Poison's weaknesses while easily walling Groudon and Garchomp. Giratina-O makes a great partner by checking Mewtwo, who is a major threat to this set, and checking Groudon to an extent.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Armed with His Mind Plate, Arceus-Psychic pays no heed to His brutish challengers in the Uber tier. With unwavering discipline, He causes His fellow Psychic-types in Mewtwo and Deoxys-A to concede to their creator like they do to no other Pokemon. Although Latias may initially seem like a better choice as a defensive Psychic-type, Arceus-Psychic differentiates Himself with better physical bulk, more Speed, a lack of weaknesses to the common Ice- and Dragon-type attacks, and a support movepool that no mere mortal could ever hope to achieve, with options such as Will-O-Wisp, Stealth Rock, and Perish Song. Even so, brains are not always better than brawn, as Arceus-Psychic's access to Calm Mind and STAB Psyshock give Him the edge against any Calm Mind user foolish enough to challenge Him. In spite of all of that, even the strongest minds feel emotion, and the common Ghost-, Dark-, and Bug-type moves are more than enough to cloud Arceus-Psychic's brain with fear. In combination with only two resistances, He is not as impervious as He looks. Moreover, Arceus-Psychic's creations are apparently ignorant, as a myriad of Pokemon in Ubers resist or are immune to His STAB attacks; truly, it is difficult to inject intelligence into stupid beings. Entry hazard setters also give Arceus-Psychic a hard time because He struggles to find a moveslot for Fire Blast, exposing the limits of what He truly knows, although Psyshock variants can beat Tentacruel. Ultimately, despite Arceus-Psychic's flaws, it would be foolish to underestimate Him lest your own Psychic-types fall victim to the wrath of His willpower.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If you are using Arceus-Psychic on a sun team, Fire Blast is a viable option on both sets to nail bulky Excadrill and Forretress that attempt to spin on it. Fire Blast also stops Ferrothorn from setting up multiple layers of Spikes. Spacial Rend is a viable move on the support set to pressure Palkia, Reshiram, and other Dragon-types. Finally, Thunder Wave can be used as an alternative status move, though most of Arceus-Psychic's common switch-ins are not bothered by it much.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Darkrai is the best check to Arceus-Psychic in the game because it fears nothing Arceus-Psychic can throw at it and it can hit Arceus-Psychic super effectively with Dark Pulse. If Darkrai has not already put something to sleep, it can also use Dark Void on Arceus-Psychic. Certain Calm Mind Arceus will beat Arceus-Psychic one-on-one by virtue of typing, specifically Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Ghost. Ho-Oh is an excellent check to Arceus-Psychic, though it must be wary of an uncommon Stone Edge from the support variant and a +1 Psyshock after Stealth Rock from the Calm Mind variant. A sun-boosted Sacred Fire will deal massive damage to Arceus-Psychic while it will struggle to damage Ho-Oh in return. Dialga walls Arceus-Psychic and can cripple it with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Focus Blast variants have an easier time wearing Dialga down, but even a +1 Focus Blast will not come close to OHKOing it. Heatran walls both of Arceus-Psychic's sets and easily sets up Stealth Rock against it. Ferrothorn and Forretress can set up entry hazards against Arceus-Psychic too, though they dislike Will-O-Wisp and Magic Coat and despise the rare Fire Blast. Kyogre will easily beat Arceus-Psychic one-on-one, as Arceus-Psychic does not resist its powerful rain-boosted Water-type moves. Kyogre also takes little from any of its attacks and isn't too bothered by a Will-O-Wisp burn. Special Genesect will get a Special Attack boost from Download against the support variant and can proceed to destroy it with Bug Buzz. However, physical Genesect can only do around 50% with U-turn, so a healthy Arceus-Psychic can simply Recover off the damage every time Genesect comes in. Note that physical Genesect deals upwards of 70% damage to the Calm Mind variant after its Download boost. Various other Pokemon, such as Kingdra, Omastar, and Toxic Jirachi, will easily beat Arceus-Psychic one-on-one. In general, Arceus-Psychic is hard to KO, but very easy to switch into.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Arceus-Psychic is an excellent support Pokemon in Ubers due to its lack of relevant weaknesses to common physical attacks (barring Genesect's U-turn) and its ability to check threats such as Mewtwo, Deoxys-A, and Latias. Will-O-Wisp is an important move that allows Arceus-Psychic to take advantage of its lack of physical weaknesses and superb bulk to burn almost all physical attackers in the tier without worry. It also provides a way to wear down Dialga and Forretress, two Pokemon Arceus-Psychic despises. Recover is mandatory on Arceus-Psychic to enable it to repeatedly check threats throughout the game. As Psychic STAB is underwhelming in Ubers, this variant of Arceus-Psychic typically runs a coverage move in its place. Ice Beam is a good option to destroy Rayquaza and pressure Giratina-O, Groudon, and other Pokemon weak to Ice. However, should you opt for a spread that can reliably beat offensive Taunt Mewtwo, Payback can be used with a Jolly nature. Payback also deals good damage to Latias and Latios. The final move depends on the team's needs. Toxic is very viable even though Arceus-Psychic already runs a status move, as Will-O-Wisp cannot shut down opposing Calm Mind Arceus formes like Toxic can. Toxic is also Arceus-Psychic's best option against Lugia. Stone Edge can be used to lure and KO Ho-Oh if your team is weak to it. Finally, Roar is an excellent move on support Arceus in general, especially in conjunction with hazard support. It works best on Ice Beam variants that are inherently more susceptible to Calm Mind Latias and Latios.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Arceus-Psychic to outrun Garchomp while providing as much physical bulk as possible to deal with threats such as Double Dance Groudon and Swords Dance Rayquaza. Bear in mind that Payback variants should run a Jolly nature over a Timid one, especially if they opt to run Stone Edge as well. A max Speed spread can be used to outrun Latias and Latios while speed tying other Arceus formes, but the extra Speed is generally not very useful. Arceus-Psychic can run several moves not listed on this set with adequate effectiveness. It can serve as your team's Stealth Rock user, but only use Stealth Rock on Arceus-Psychic as a last resort. Perish Song is an option on stall teams to serve as a win condition against setup sweepers. Magic Coat is another intriguing option that can surprise status users and hazard setters, such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Froslass.</p> <p>Arceus-Psychic excels on defensively oriented rain teams, where it can check Life Orb Mewtwo efficiently, as rain will prevent Fire Blast from 2HKOing Arceus-Psychic. When using Arceus-Psychic, remember that its job it to spread status while being able to check powerful Psychic-types and physical attackers, so use Will-O-Wisp and Recover liberally. Arceus-Psychic will not need to attack very often, though it does need to hit Pokemon like Mewtwo, Rayquaza, and Deoxys-A with its coverage moves to actually defeat them one-on-one. Specially defensive Kyogre makes an excellent partner, as it can deal with Darkrai and Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost while simultaneously weakening Mewtwo's Fire Blasts. Heatran is a good partner as well, as it resists all three of Arceus-Psychic's weaknesses. In particular, Heatran can easily deal with special Genesect, which threatens to OHKO Arceus-Psychic at +1 with Bug Buzz after Stealth Rock damage. In return, Arceus-Psychic can burn Ground- and Fighting-types, such as Arceus-Ground and Terrakion. Finally, Lustrous Orb Palkia pressures entry hazard setters that Arceus-Psychic invites in and checks Kyogre, while Arceus-Psychic can handle faster Dragon-types, such as Latias and Garchomp, in return.</p>"

There are two quality options for the final slot. Focus Blast grants Arceus-Psychic a way to beat the myriad of Steel-types that would otherwise wall it, such as Ferrothorn, Dialga, and Heatran. On the other hand, Dark Pulse allows Arceus-Psychic to still function as an excellent check to Psychic-types like Latias, something this set cannot do well if you choose to forgo Dark Pulse. Both moves are equally viable, so the choice is up to you and typically depends on your team.</p> <p>This set opts for maximum Speed to tie opposing Arceus and outrun Latias and Latios; the extra Speed can prove critical in a Calm Mind war against the latter two as they also have access to Psyshock. Arceus-Psychic is vulnerable to all forms of status, so while it is capable of setting up a Calm Mind in the face of many offensive threats, it struggles with both poison and paralysis. Also, if you see a Pokemon that easily walls Arceus-Psychic, refrain from setting up a Calm Mind until the counter is sufficiently worn down. Toxic Spikes severely hampers Arceus-Psychic, so Tentacruel makes a great partner for it. Tentacruel also possesses the ability to lure and cripple Arceus-Psychic's checks with Toxic, such as Arceus-Ghost, while Arceus-Psychic can check Pokemon like Latios in return. Specially defensive Kyogre makes a great partner to this set because it can check Darkrai, Arceus-Dark, and Arceus-Ghost while weakening Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire. Ferrothorn and Forretress also make for good partners because both of them resist all of Arceus-Psychic's weaknesses and can set up multiple layers of Spikes, helping to wear down its checks. In return, Arceus-Psychic can check Terrakion and Arceus-Fighting for Ferrothorn.</p>"

  "Arceus-Rock": {
    "overview": "<p>Legends tell of a Pokemon that can draw unimaginable power from the Stone Plate; a primordial Pokemon so pure in heart that even the magnificent Ho-Oh humbles itself before it. This Pokemon is none other than the tried-and-true Arceus-Rock, who is capable of fulfilling both offensive and defensive roles alike. His strength is undisputed; STAB Rock-type attacks are incredibly solid against potent threats such as Kyurem-W, Reshiram, and Rayquaza. His Special Defense has outstanding potential; in the midst of sandstorm, even Choice Specs Draco Meteor from Kyurem-W is easily weathered. However, the most timeless of Pokemon can still show some age. Despite gaining a Special Defense boost under sandstorm, His numerous weaknesses to Water-, Ground-, Grass-, Fighting-, and Steel-type attacks are still easy to take advantage of. The frequent weather changes by Groudon and Kyogre can also be quite the nuisance. However, let it be known that Arceus-Rock knows both the beginning and the end; He is what legends are made from.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Arceus-Rock has an abundant special movepool to work with, none of its other options add more coverage than what is recommended. Flamethrower can be used if you find Fire Blast's accuracy off-putting. Focus Blast hits Steel-types and Dialga super effectively in place of Fire Blast, but its inaccuracy makes it a poor option. Thunder hits Kyogre extremely hard while having a high paralysis chance, but as Grass Knot does the same amount of damage to Kyogre, Thunder is generally not preferred.</p> <p>Arceus-Rock can run a mono-attacking Swords Dance set with Swords Dance, Recover, Refresh, and Rock Slide, but Calm Mind is generally better; regardless, such a set is much easier to wall. Arceus-Rock can run a rather useful dual screens set, as well as a very bulky Cosmic Power stall set. It can also drop Calm Mind on the mono-attacker set to run a full support set with Roar, Perish Song, or Stealth Rock in its place, should you desire it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As alluded to in the individual set descriptions, Arceus-Fighting is Arceus-Rock's number one enemy. As it resists Arceus-Rock's STAB and is neutral to Arceus-Rock's commonly used coverage moves, it can easily set up Calm Mind alongside Arceus-Rock and take it down with a super effective Fighting-type Judgment. Arceus-Steel and Arceus-Ground can work in a similar fashion, but need to watch out for Fire Blast and Grass Knot, respectively. Arceus-Grass and Arceus-Water both have a super effective Judgment to use on Arceus-Rock as well, but need to watch out for Fire Blast and Grass Knot, respectively, while boosted neutral Rock-type Judgments will also hurt.</p> <p>Any special variant of Arceus-Rock that lacks Substitute or Refresh is walled by Chansey and Blissey, who can both shrug off any attack Arceus-Rock can throw at them and cripple Arceus with Toxic. If Arceus-Rock lacks Grass Knot or Will-O-Wisp, Groudon can switch in without fear and KO it with Earthquake. Garchomp works in a similar vein, only fearing the rare Ice Beam, whereas Excadrill can switch into anything not named Earthquake, Will-O-Wisp, or Fire Blast, and KO with Earthquake. Kyogre causes problems for special variants of Arceus-Rock that lack Grass Knot, as its enormous Special Defense allows it to tank anything Arceus-Rock throws at it, while Arceus-Rock is forced to switch to avoid taking STAB Water-type attacks to the face. Choice Scarf Kyogre can outspeed and OHKO Arceus-Rock with Water Spout, even after a Calm Mind. Choice Scarf Terrakion and Heracross can revenge kill weakened Arceus-Rock, the latter also enjoys being burned by Will-O-Wisp. Groudon and Arceus-Ground will have a field day against Swords Dance Arceus-Rock, while Giratina and Ferrothorn can use Will-O-Wisp or Leech Seed to stall out Arceus-Rock. Be aware that should Arceus-Rock carry Overheat, Ferrothorn should stay well away unless it has rain support.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mono-Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Arceus-Rock's huge bulk and great STAB allow it to run an effective mono-attacking set. This set is useful for a number of reasons. First, with sandstorm support and its pure Rock typing, Arceus-Rock is a fantastic counter to many dangerous Pokemon. With its Rock-type Judgment, it can quickly put Ho-Oh and Reshiram in their place; with Will-O-Wisp, it can easily cripple Arceus, making it an excellent check to the Extreme Killer while maintaining a STAB with decent coverage. Under sandstorm, it can also switch into some of the most powerful special attacks in the Uber tier. For example, Draco Meteor from Modest Choice Specs Dialga only does 53.60% - 63.51%, allowing Arceus-Rock to heal off the damage and stall Dialga out. Second, access to Calm Mind lets Arceus-Rock switch from a defensive Pokemon into a deadly sweeper in the blink of an eye, and any team that lacks an appropriate counter for it will quickly be crushed. This allows Arceus-Rock to easily control the tempo of the match, switching between offense and defense at will. While this set is at its best on sandstorm teams, its utility does not end there. On a sun team, it works as an excellent check to opposing Fire-types, who become even more dangerous in the sun.</p> <p>Calm Mind is obviously the crux of the set, boosting Arceus's excellent Special Attack to levels where it can sweep, while skyrocketing its already bloated Special Defense to untouchable levels. Judgment is obviously Arceus-Rock's STAB, while Recover allows it to switch in and tank hits again and again. The last slot comes down to the user's preference. Will-O-Wisp complements Calm Mind and Judgment almost perfectly, enabling Arceus-Rock to cripple physical attackers such as Groudon and Garchomp. Refresh, on the other hand, allows Arceus-Rock to laugh off status, especially from the likes of Blissey and Chansey.</p> <p>Roar is usable over Will-O-Wisp or Refresh to allow Arceus-Rock to defeat opposing Calm Mind users that might attempt to engage in a Calm Mind war. Substitute lets Arceus-Rock get past Chansey and Blissey, but Refresh is better overall due to its ability to cure poison inflicted by Toxic Spikes. Otherwise, stick to the moves given for maximum efficacy. The EVs and nature aim to maximize bulk while allowing Arceus-Rock to Speed tie with opposing Arceus.</p> <p>Arceus-Rock is obviously best used in sandstorm, which means Tyranitar or Hippowdon should be used alongside it. Unfortunately, this doubles up on weaknesses to Water, Grass, Ground, Steel and Fighting, so teammates that resist these types are helpful. Shaymin-S is an excellent Pokemon to run alongside Arceus-Rock, as it resists most of Arceus-Rock's weaknesses, while Arceus-Rock can easily take Fire-type moves and weaker special attacks, such as Ice Beam, for Shaymin-S. Giratina and Lugia also have great synergy with Arceus-Rock, as they switch into most of Arceus-Rock's weaknesses with ease. Giratina is especially good because it can switch into Choice Scarf Terrakion and Choice Scarf Heracross, who can both deal huge amounts of damage to Arceus-Rock, the latter enjoying Will-O-Wisp as well.</p> <p>While this set can be extremely threatening, it is hard-countered by Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Steel, Arceus-Fighting, Arceus-Grass and Arceus-Water, who can all set up Calm Mind alongside Arceus-Rock and bring it down with their own super effective Judgments. Ho-Oh is an excellent counter to all of the aforementioned Arceus formes barring Arceus-Water due to its huge Special Defense and powerful STAB attacks. Arceus-Fighting can also be defeated easily by Psystrike Mewtwo, provided that it avoids switching into Shadow Ball or Dark Pulse. Dialga can deal with Arceus-Water without much trouble. If Arceus-Rock lacks Refresh, Chansey and Blissey can easily take anything it throws at them and cripple it with Toxic; if it lacks Will-O-Wisp, Groudon and Garchomp can freely switch in and take it out with super effective Earthquakes. As sandstorm will likely be used alongside Arceus-Rock, Excadrill can easily switch into Chansey and Blissey, as it is immune to both Thunder Wave and Toxic, and proceed to set up Swords Dance to sweep; Scizor and Lucario can work in a similar fashion. Finally, Kyogre is also a huge problem to Arceus-Rock, as it is able to use Calm Mind alongside Arceus-Rock and drown Arceus-Rock with its Water STAB, while Choice Scarf variants can outspeed and OHKO with Water Spout. Grass-types such as Celebi, Virizion and Shaymin-S synergize well with Arceus-Rock; Palkia also boasts the ability to switch into Kyogre's STAB attacks with its 4x resistance to Water.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>While the previous set focuses on using Arceus-Rock's defensive capabilities to pull off a sweep, this set takes full advantage of its excellent Special Attack, Speed, bulk, and coverage to pull off a sweep as quickly as possible. After a single Calm Mind, Arceus-Rock reaches a maximum of 558 Special Attack, with which it can deal huge amounts of damage to weakened teams. Judgment is Arceus-Rock's STAB attack, which hits most Pokemon that do not resist it extremely hard. Fire Blast allows Arceus-Rock to roast Arceus-Steel that might attempt to Calm Mind alongside it, as well as other Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn and Jirachi. Grass Knot, on the other hand, lets Arceus-Rock destroy any Groudon and Kyogre that think they can change the weather and stop Arceus-Rock with their super effective STAB attacks. Recover is preferred in the last slot, as it enables Arceus-Rock to still check dangerous threats such as Reshiram and Ho-Oh, but an additional coverage move can be used for maximum coverage.</p> <p>The EVs are simple: they just maximize Special Attack and Speed, allowing Arceus-Rock to be as fast and as powerful as possible. A Timid nature allows Arceus-Rock to Speed tie with other Arceus formes, and also lets it outspeed Lugia, Latias, Latios, Terrakion, Tornadus, and Thundurus; alternatively, a Modest nature enables Arceus-Rock to hit harder while still outspeeding non-Choice Scarf Garchomp. Earth Power can be used in place of Fire Blast or Grass Knot to hit Dialga harder, but with Recover, Arceus-Rock can set up on specially based Dialga that lack Toxic, Roar, or Dragon Tail anyway. Ice Beam can also be used to defeat Garchomp, who can otherwise cause Arceus-Rock a lot of trouble, but it is quite useless otherwise.</p> <p>Like all Arceus-Rock variants, this set is hard-countered by Arceus-Fighting. Again, Ho-Oh and Mewtwo are excellent teammates for this reason. Chansey and Blissey now completely wall this set, so again, Excadrill is a good teammate, as are Scizor, Terrakion, Garchomp, and Lucario. Wobbuffet can be used to trap Chansey or Blissey through the use of Encore and Tickle, allowing Tyranitar to come in and Pursuit them to and ensure they cannot take Arceus-Rock's attacks any more. Garchomp resists both Judgment and Fire Blast, does not take much damage from Grass Knot, and can defeat Arceus-Rock with STAB Earthquake. Physically inclined Dialga, especially those with Bulk Up, can set up alongside Arceus-Rock and destroy it with Outrage or Earthquake. Speaking of Dialga, a Bulk Up RestTalk Dialga of your own can come in very handy, as it can switch into Chansey and Blissey with impunity, as well as check Arceus-Water and Calm Mind Kyogre. It can also lure in Garchomp, survive Earthquake, and OHKO in return with Outrage. Forretress and Ferrothorn are decent checks to opposing Garchomp as well, and can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, which would whittle down Garchomp and stop it from walling Arceus-Rock.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Arceus-Rock is one of the select few Arceus formes that can viably run a Swords Dance set, and also the only Swords Dance Arceus that can defeat Skarmory without depending on weather. While Swords Dance Arceus-Rock may seem more appealing than its Calm Mind counterpart due to its ability to boost more quickly, Swords Dance Arceus-Rock does have a few disadvantages. Firstly, it can no longer switch into Ho-Oh as easily, as Sacred Fire has a 47.5% chance of crippling it, factoring in accuracy. Secondly, it is very easily walled, especially by Groudon, who poses a huge threat to sandstorm teams in general. That being said, Swords Dance Arceus-Rock is still an extremely potent sweeper. To illustrate its power, after a single Swords Dance, Jolly Arceus-Rock can OHKO specially defensive Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage most of the time. Stone Edge is Arceus-Rock's powerful—albeit inaccurate—STAB attack; STAB Stone Edge is what differentiates Arceus-Rock from Arceus-Ground, who can run a similar set. Earthquake gives Arceus-Rock fantastic coverage alongside Stone Edge. Recover allows Arceus-Rock to recover lost health and check threats such as Reshiram more easily.</p> <p>Arceus-Rock has a few other options it can run in the last slot. Overheat allows Arceus-Rock to deal huge amounts of damage to Ferrothorn outside of rain; it would otherwise prove to be a huge nuisance. Extreme Speed lets Arceus-Rock take out frail, faster Pokemon such as Shaymin-S and Darkrai, while Brick Break can be used to beat down Ferrothorn in the rain. A Jolly nature is preferred as it allows Arceus-Rock to Speed tie with opposing Arceus as well as outspeed Terrakion and Lugia, two Pokemon who would otherwise be problematic. However, an Adamant nature guarantees the OHKO on Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Arceus-Fighting remains a hard counter to this set as well. Again, Ho-Oh and Mewtwo are fantastic checks to Arceus-Fighting; they also laugh at Virizion, who resists Stone Edge and Earthquake. Groudon and Arceus-Ground now wall Arceus-Rock and take it out with a super effective Earthquake or Judgment. A healthy Garchomp will cause problems for Arceus-Rock too. Again, Grass-types such as Shaymin-S, Virizion and Celebi do very well against these Ground-types, and if you are using Arceus-Rock as a standalone Pokemon, a Groudon of your own also defeats them quite handily. Additionally, Ferrothorn is a problem if Arceus-Rock lacks Overheat; Magnezone can be used to trap and KO it.</p>"

  "Arceus-Steel": {
    "overview": "<p>Clad in His Iron Plate, the shining Arceus-Steel enters the battlefield in what is perhaps His most resilient forme. Equipped with a total of eleven resistances—including Dragon—in addition to very good bulk and a resistance to Stealth Rock, Arceus-Steel is ready to take an extreme amount of punishment. For His polished exterior is so impervious that Poison-type attacks, Toxic, or the presence of Toxic Spikes are rendered completely ineffective. All together, the armored Arceus-Steel can run a sturdy Swords Dance or Calm Mind set, boosting up with ease against even Blissey and Chansey. Unfortunately, His STAB Steel-type attacks are resisted by many of His creations, reducing His offensive capabilities. His armor also fails to protect Him from the common Fighting-, Fire-, and Ground-type attacks. However, Arceus-Steel's will is resolute, and few indeed will dare confront Him when He is at His full potential.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Steel's extensive movepool grants it no dearth of options. Cosmic Power can be used to boost both of Arceus-Steel's defensive stats, and it works well with Arceus-Steel's numerous resistances. Perish Song lets Arceus-Steel defeat late-game sweepers such as Kyogre and Arceus-Dark, and can create a setup opportunity for a teammate such as Rayquaza. Earth Power puts a dent in Heatran, but has no real use otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Any Pokemon capable of dishing out powerful Fire-, Fighting-, or Ground-type attacks is a threat to Arceus-Steel. Ho-Oh, Reshiram, and Groudon can all obliterate Arceus-Steel with their STAB moves; the latter is especially dangerous as the sunlight it summons powers up the Fire-type moves that Arceus-Steel hates. Heatran can switch on Will-O-Wisp, grab a Flash Fire boost, and do a large chunk of damage with Flamethrower. If the sun is up, Mewtwo can fry Arceus-Steel with Fire Blast, which easily OHKOes. Kyogre, Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fire, and Arceus-Fighting can all engage in a Calm Mind war with Arceus-Steel and eventually win thanks to their natural type advantage. Garchomp and Terrakion can turn Arceus-Steel to scrap metal with their powerful STAB moves, but they cannot switch in. Choice Scarf Heracross, although rare, can outspeed Arceus-Steel and even stomach an unboosted Judgment if it needs to; in return, it has no problem bringing Arceus-Steel down with its STAB Close Combat. Steel-types such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn can be a nuisance to the Swords Dance set; Skarmory in particular laughs at all of Arceus-Steel's moves and can phaze it out with Whirlwind.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>With its impressive defenses and wide array of resistances thanks to its Steel typing, Arceus-Steel can pull off a Calm Mind set without breaking a sweat. Access to Recover prevents Arceus-Steel from being taken down easily, and even allows it to wall Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Palkia after a few Calm Mind boosts. Steel has decent coverage in Ubers, but is resisted by Water- and Fire-types, which are fairly common. Roar can be used to phaze out opposing setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Dialga before they get out of control, and racks up passive damage when used alongside entry hazards. Thunder can be used to deal with Pokemon who resist Steel-type attacks, such as Kyogre, but it is not recommended unless rain support from Kyogre can be provided. Will-O-Wisp allows Arceus-Steel to cripple physical attackers such as Zekrom and works very well thanks to Arceus-Steel's excellent Speed. The combination of Calm Mind and Will-O-Wisp makes Arceus-Steel very hard to take out. Thanks to Arceus-Steel's immunity to Toxic and access to Recover, it can function as a deadly stallbreaker capable of defeating stalling machines such as Blissey one-on-one.</p> <p>The EVs are designed to grant Arceus-Steel maximum bulk, while also giving it enough Speed to tie with other offensive variants of Arceus. Speed and HP EVs can be transferred to Special Attack if immediate firepower is preferred over durability; 116 EVs with a neutral nature is the absolute minimum Speed you should run with Arceus-Steel, though, so it can still outspeed Garchomp. 168 Speed EVs is probably preferred though as it allows Arceus-Steel to outspeed all non-Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Kyurem-W, and Rayquaza, which can be invaluable especially considering Arceus-Steel is already a good check to both. A fully defensive EV set can be run by moving the Speed EVs into Defense and using a Bold nature.</p> <p>Kyogre makes a fantastic partner to Arceus-Steel thanks to its ability to check Groudon. The rain Kyogre brings along also negates Arceus-Steel's weakness to Fire-type moves, and allows it to wield a perfectly accurate Thunder. Kyogre can also check most variants of Reshiram and Ho-Oh, both of whom pose a huge threat to Arceus-Steel. Arceus-Steel pairs up well with almost any Dragon-type as it can take Ice- and Dragon-type hits for them, while they can take Fire-, Water-, Electric-, and usually even Ground-type moves for it. Rayquaza deserves a special mention because it is immune to Earthquake and has excellent synergy with Arceus-Steel on the whole.</p>"
      },
      "Utility Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set is a great choice for a supportive Pokemon. While it might lack the Leftovers recovery that other Steel-types--such as Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Skarmory--offer, Arceus-Steel's superior stats and wider movepool set it apart. In fact, it is both the fastest and specially bulkiest Steel-type in Ubers.</p> <p>Arceus-Steel is one of the few Steel-type Pokemon to learn Will-O-Wisp, so it's a given on a defensive set, as it allows Arceus-Steel to cripple most physical attackers. Note that this isn't a sure-fire way to cripple Extreme Killer Arceus, as Will-O-Wisp's shaky accuracy can result in it taking heavy damage from a Swords Dance-boosted Arceus. However, because most Extreme Killer Arceus don't run maximum Speed, Arceus-Steel can act as an emergency check to it if your team is running out of options to deal with it.</p> <p>Recover is the other major jewel in Arceus-Steel's crown, ensuring that unlike most other Steel-types, it isn't forced to rely on Wish, Rest, or other less reliable methods of healing. Arceus-Steel's longevity also makes it a great phazer. Roar is the reliable and immediate option for phazing, while Perish Song is a slower, more risky method that has the advantage of dooming the last Pokemon standing, but Roar is far more reliable in most situations. When it comes to offensive options, Ice Beam is the prime choice, as it allows Arceus-Steel to damage a wide variety of Ice-weak Pokemon, such as Rayquaza and Landorus, and also deals good damage to Groudon, Giratina-O, and Zekrom. Judgment's coverage isn't nearly as good, but it hits Kyurem-W, Terrakion, and Tyranitar super-effectively, while also being stronger than Ice Beam against neutral targets. Kyurem-W in particular can actually defeat Arceus-Steel that don't run Judgment with Fusion Flare, Focus Blast, or Earth Power.</p> <p>Arceus-Steel has a few other options up its sleeve, but finding moves to replace is tough, as removing Will-O-Wisp or its phazing move lessens Arceus-Steel's utility and replacing its attacking move makes Arceus-Steel even bigger Taunt bait. Stealth Rock is an option if your team is desperate to fit in the entry hazard, while Toxic allows Arceus-Steel to cripple Ho-Oh switch-ins and dangerous Calm Mind users. If your team is extremely weak to Ho-Oh, Arceus-Steel also has the more direct option of running Stone Edge. Finally, Magic Coat prevents Ferrothorn and other Spikers from setting up hazards and can surprise Deoxys-S leads (though note that Fire Punch 4HKOes Arceus-Steel outside of rain).</p> <p>The Speed investment lets Arceus-Steel tie with offensive Arceus formes, but if you prefer a bulkier set and don't mind losing a little bit of Speed, you can run anywhere from 176 Speed EVs and a Timid nature to outspeed Latias and Latios, or a Calm or Bold nature with 168 Speed EVs to outspeed Rayquaza and Kyurem-W.</p> <p>Because Arceus-Steel is such a great phazer, it's only natural that Spikes users such as the Deoxys formes, Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory make good choices as teammates, despite the typing redundancies. However, Arceus-Steel itself is very vulnerable to being set up on by hazard setters, so spinners such as Forretress, Tentacruel, Excadrill, and Kabutops are good teammates. There is always the riskier option of Espeon or Xatu to block hazards from going up; of the two, the former is preferred due to its decent offensive stats.</p> <p>Arceus-Steel has serious problems with several common Pokemon on sun teams, including Ho-Oh, Kyurem-W (when not using Judgment), and Reshiram; the threat of other dangerous special attackers such as Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fighting, and Kyogre make it important to also cover Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks. All of this makes Kyogre an excellent teammate. Not only does Kyogre nullify Arceus-Steel's weaknesses to sun teams with Drizzle, it can also use Arceus-Fighting and Arceus-Ground as platforms to launch its torrential assault. In return, Arceus-Steel does a good job of checking Latias for Kyogre. Just be warned, however, that even bulky Kyogre will take a lot from Ho-Oh's Brave Bird. When it comes to typing synergy, floating Dragon-types with Levitate--such as Giratina-O and Latias--partner well with Arceus-Steel, as they are resistant or immune to all of its weaknesses while Arceus-Steel covers theirs.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Although Steel-type STAB is admittedly not the best in Ubers, with many of the common Pokemon in the tier--most notably Kyogre--resisting it, Arceus-Steel can still be a potent user of Swords Dance. After a Swords Dance, Arceus-Steel's Attack stat hits a magnificent 678. Iron Head provides a reliable STAB move, and its 30% flinch chance is icing on the cake. Earthquake has excellent neutral coverage in Ubers in tandem with Iron Head, being resisted by only a handful of Pokemon. Extreme Speed can be used over Earthquake to deal with faster sweepers such as Mewtwo, but it is not nearly as powerful as Earthquake. In the last slot, Recover allows Arceus-Steel to make full use of its bulk, and gives it plenty of opportunities to set up.</p> <p>A more defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Speed can be used to give Arceus-Steel some staying power. Outrage can be used to destroy the plethora of Dragon-types in Ubers, but a Arceus-Steel locked into Outrage is easy to revenge kill.</p> <p>As opposing support Groudon have a field day with this set, offensive variants of Kyogre and Palkia are great teammates. Just like the previous set, most Dragon-types make good teammates for Arceus-Steel as they resist most of each other's weaknesses. However, one must be cautious about pairing Dialga or Zekrom with Arceus-Steel, as it compounds the team's weakness to Ground.</p>"

  "Arceus-Water": {
    "overview": "<p>Wielding both the power to create and destroy, Arceus-Water, much like His Splash Plate, has many meanings. On the one hand, He much prefers rain, as the power of His STAB Water-type attacks are augmented to terrifying levels; access to both Swords Dance and Calm Mind allows Him to wash all but the strongest of His creations away. Yet, on the other hand, unlike His creations Kyogre and Manaphy, Arceus-Water can function well under sun thanks to His excellent defensive synergy and Recover. Furthermore, He is not only capable of being an incredibly good answer to opposing Kyogre but also to the impressive might of Reshiram and Kyurem-W. Although His multifaceted forme lacks the sheer power of Kyogre and Palkia as well as the instant recovery of Manaphy, His torrential Speed dwarfs them in comparison. There are certain aspects, however, that remain as transparent as water. His weaknesses to Electric- and Grass-type attacks, most notably the common Thunder, will always prove to be an annoyance. However, much like the waters, there is no knowing what Arceus-Water can do; you can either be cleansed in spirit or drowned under waters without end.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Water does not have many other options. Surf is a very viable option over Judgment, exchanging 5 Base Power for another 8 PP. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast on the offensive Calm Mind set if you don't want to risk a miss, but the loss in power is very significant. Earth Power can be used on the same set as well, but it is very situational and only used for opposing Dialga. Focus Blast is another option, but rain-boosted Judgment or Fire Blast usually hits harder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The first step in countering Arceus-Water is to bring out the sun. Not only is defensive Groudon with Dragon Tail a decent check to physical Arceus-Water in its own right, but the sun it summons is absolutely devastating to Arceus-Water's offenses, as it removes the rain boost and replaces it with a general resistance to Water-type attacks. However, be aware that this will power up sets with Fire Blast. Toxic Spikes can be useful for combating Arceus-Water, but make sure that the Arceus you are facing is not a Calm Mind variant, as these can take advantage of a single layer of Toxic Spikes to avoid Toxic poison.</p> <p>Ferrothorn, Dialga, and the Giratina formes are your best bets against the Swords Dance set; just watch out for Brick Break or Dragon Claw. Even with these two coverage moves, however, Ferrothorn and Giratina are not KOed and can fire back a Power Whip, Dragon Tail, or Will-O-Wisp. Defensive Arceus-Grass also counters this set soundly, as it resists Waterfall and is bulky enough to take anything else. In return, it can cripple Arceus-Water with status moves, such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, or just smack it with a Judgment or Grass Knot for a near-OHKO. Shaymin-S outspeeds Arceus-Water and can demolish it with a brutal Seed Flare or a barrage of Air Slashes. In the way of checks, Choice Scarf Zekrom, Dialga, Palkia, and Kyogre resist Waterfall and possess solid enough defensive stats to weather any unboosted attack, firing back with a powerful super effective Bolt Strike or Thunder. If sun is up, any opposing Arceus set with Will-O-Wisp can render this set useless as well. If Stealth Rock and Spikes can be taken out, the rare Shedinja makes a fine check to any Arceus lacking a status move or Fire Blast.</p> <p>The Calm Mind variant of Arceus-Water is a different beast altogether, as its multitude of coverage and support moves make countering it tricky. Sets without Will-O-Wisp or Fire Blast are easy targets for Ferrothorn, who resists anything else that Arceus-Water can throw at it and 2HKOes with Power Whip after Leech Seed or Stealth Rock and a single layer of Spikes. Arceus-Water lacking Refresh or Recover are easily picked off by the combination of Seismic Toss and Toxic from Blissey or Chansey. Giratina formes, Dialga, and Arceus-Grass can keep this set from accumulating boosts by phazing it with Dragon Tail or Roar while shrugging off any attack but a boosted Ice Beam, which still doesn't hit all that hard. However, the Giratina formes and Dialga cannot win one-on-one.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Arceus-Water has an excellent niche in Ubers as a physical attacker, where it only faces true competition from the uncommon Kabutops. This set's execution is simple: just set up a Swords Dance or two and attempt a quick sweep, preferably aided by rain support to further power up its STAB Waterfall. The combination of Waterfall and Dragon Claw hits the vast majority of Pokemon for at least neutral damage, and even a resisted Waterfall in rain does monstrous damage. After a Swords Dance, rain-boosted Waterfall will even 2HKO 0/0 Giratina-O, OHKO 252/0 Arceus, and possibly OHKO standard Lugia after Stealth Rock damage. Waterfall also deals 47% - 55.4% to 252/0 Dialga, and does 49.7% - 58.8% to specially defensive Ferrothorn. Dragon Claw gets the nod too as it is the only way that Arceus-Water can deal appreciable damage to Giratina, which is never 2HKOed by Waterfall; it also has the added advantage of KOing Palkia after a Swords Dance. Brick Break allows Arceus-Water to eliminate Ferrothorn and Dialga even more easily if you don't want to rely on high damage rolls. Recover provides Arceus-Water with greater survivability and therefore the ability to do more damage, whereas Extreme Speed synergizes well with Dragon Claw, allowing Arceus-Water to pick off Palkia and Rayquaza switch-ins. The EV spread for this set simply maximizes Speed and Attack, eschewing bulk for raw muscle.</p> <p>Kyogre is a must for this set, as permanent rain ensures that Waterfall will deal as much damage as possible, while also ensuring that sun is kept out of play. As evidenced above, rain is necessary for gaining quite a few relevant OHKOs and 2HKOs. Kyogre makes a solid answer to Groudon as well, as do Gliscor, Skarmory, and Lugia. Spikes support is very useful for this set, as it wears down opposing grounded Pokemon, such as Giratina and Ferrothorn, and further weakens Groudon and opposing Choice Scarf users. Forretress and Skarmory are competent Spikes users, and can use Giratina and Ferrothorn to lay down multiple layers of Spikes, especially if it isn't too concerned about getting burned. Skarmory can add Whirlwind support to the mix, while Forretress can Rapid Spin away opposing Spikes and Toxic Spikes against Ferrothorn. A Ferrothorn of your own is a good teammate, as it can set up Spikes too. It might not be able to beat opposing Ferrothorn, but it is an excellent switch-in to Electric- and Grass-type attacks, as well as to Kyogre and Zekrom, two potentially serious threats to this set. Excadrill, Garchomp, Dialga, and Wobbuffet are good checks to Zekrom; Choice Scarf variants outspeed Arceus-Water and OHKO with Bolt Strike. Wobbuffet also gives Arceus-Water more chances to set up Swords Dance by using Encore.</p> <p>While Arceus-Water can 2HKO most Kyogre sets with boosted Waterfall, Choice Specs Kyogre can OHKO in return with Thunder, so packing a Ferrothorn or a Dialga to absorb Thunder and other Electric-type attacks would be very useful. Dialga sets up Stealth Rock and takes Grass-, Water-, and Electric-type moves with ease, and is also capable of sponging Zekrom's Bolt Strike. Chansey is a great partner for Arceus-Water too, as she is more than capable of taking Thunder and any other special attack aimed at Arceus-Water, subduing everything threatening other than Ferrothorn, Zekrom, and some Shaymin-S variants. Additionally, these aforementioned teammates are capable of coming in on Giratina to absorb pesky Will-O-Wisps as well, although only Dialga is truly threatening it. Shaymin-S is a huge threat, as it is faster than Arceus-Water and carries a super effective Seed Flare. Again, Dialga is a good answer to Shaymin-S, as it is able to tank all of Shaymin-S's moves bar Earth Power and strike back with a STAB Draco Meteor or phaze Shaymin-S with Roar or Dragon Tail. Ferrothorn is another good check to all but SubSeed variants of Shaymin-S. If taking an offensive route, your main goal should be to lure in and take out Groudon. Mixed Bulk Up Dialga, mixed Rayquaza, and mixed Zekrom are all capable of doing in Groudon by faking a physical set and then laying down the hurt with a Draco Meteor, attacking Groudon on its weaker defensive side.</p>"

      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Most Arceus formes can run an excellent Calm Mind set, and Arceus-Water is no exception. It is important to recognize, however, that this set competes directly with Calm Mind Kyogre and Manaphy. Arceus-Water's higher HP, Defense, and Speed are all important distinguishing factors here, as well as its much wider coverage. Judgment serves as a dependable STAB attack, and in conjunction with Spacial Rend, lets Arceus-Water hit nearly the entire metagame for at least neutral damage, only missing out on Ferrothorn and the almost nonexistent Shedinja and Empoleon. A +1 Spacial Rend can 2HKO Giratina-O, OHKO Rayquaza after Stealth Rock damage, and OHKO Palkia after two switch-ins to Stealth Rock. Additionally, note that a 2x resisted Judgment is stronger than Spacial Rend in rain. Ice Beam is a decent option for hitting opposing Dragon- and Grass-type Pokemon if you do not like Spacial Rend or are using Thunder. Fire Blast is an extremely solid option for denting the problematic Ferrothorn, 2HKOing it after a Calm Mind even in rain. Fire Blast can also 2HKO Dialga, 252/0 Arceus, +1 Mewtwo, and Wobbuffet. Finally, Thunder is a good option to hit opposing Kyogre that might otherwise attempt a Calm Mind war, but this is typically of secondary concern compared to dependably KOing Ferrothorn.</p> <p>If a healing move is more important than a coverage move, one move can be replaced with Recover. If Arceus-Water switches into a single layer of Toxic Spikes or gets burned, it can beat Chansey and Blissey in rain by setting up with Calm Mind and using Recover when needed. Once again, Kyogre support is very much appreciated, because although this set functions well without it; it doesn't like sunny weather. If running Kyogre, a Choice set is preferred, as Calm Mind Kyogre's role would otherwise overlap with Arceus-Water's.</p> <p>Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress are excellent partners to Arceus-Water, as all of them can provide Spikes support. Skarmory and Forretress are excellent answers to opposing Ferrothorn, as the former can Whirlwind it out to rack up damage or use Taunt to nullify its attempts at setting up, while the latter can Rapid Spin. Although Ferrothorn doesn't answer opposing Ferrothorn all that well, it is the premier Zekrom counter, and also checks opposing Calm Mind Kyogre admirably. All three aforementioned teammates can set up on the problematic Blissey and Chansey as well. Mixed Dialga and physically based mixed Palkia can lure in both pink blobs with ease and OHKO with their powerful STAB moves. The blobs are ironically good partners too, as they can soak up status and powerful special attacks, such as Thunder or Grass Knot, that can potentially break through Arceus-Water's boosts. Specially defensive Dialga is a great teammate as well, as it can come in on Electric- and Grass- attacks, in addition to the likes of Blissey, Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Arceus-Grass, and set up Stealth Rock or accumulate Bulk Up boosts. Though it is less effective in rain, Heatran can fulfill a similar role to Dialga bar stacking Bulk Up boosts. It can also switch into Giratina without getting burned and force out opposing Bulk Up Dialga.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>At first glance, this set might seem outclassed by Kyogre and Manaphy. However, neither Kyogre or Manaphy can function without the presence of rain, while Arceus-Water can. This set differs from the offensive Calm Mind set in that it is free to use Recover without giving up on a coverage move and consequently being easily walled. Instead, this variant of Arceus-Water packs Will-O-Wisp to burn Pokemon that bother it, such as Zekrom, Groudon, Bulk Up Dialga, and Rayquaza. Refresh, however, is a solid option over Will-O-Wisp if you would like Arceus-Water to be a phenomenal stallbreaker. Calm Mind is this set's boosting move, and, when used with Will-O-Wisp, makes Arceus-Water extremely hard to take down. The choice between Surf and Judgment as Arceus-Water's only attacking move is up to the user; Judgment has an extra 5 Base Power over Surf, but Surf has 8 more PP.</p> <p>The EV spread is straightforward; 252 HP EVs give Arceus-Water optimal bulk, while 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature let it Speed-tie with other Arceus. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe can be used if looking for a more defensive set.</p> <p>While this set does work outside of rain, it definitely appreciates it. Rain boosts Arceus-Water's sole STAB move and makes it much stronger, making Kyogre an ideal partner. Ferrothorn counters both Kyogre and Arceus-Water; however, it will not enjoy a burn at all. Lustrous Orb Palkia is an amazing Ferrothorn lure, as it is able to bluff a Choice item and strike Ferrothorn with a super effective Fire Blast. This set really appreciates entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, as they weaken Arceus-Water's counters and allow it to sweep much more easily. Ferrothorn is a good partner as it can not only set up Spikes and Stealth Rock, but also sponges Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Arceus-Water. Arceus-Water does not appreciate opposing entry hazards, so a spinner is recommended. Forretress and Excadrill are good partners; while the former deserves a special mention for setting up entry hazards as well, both spinners work well under rain, as it decreases their shared weakness to Fire. If not running Refresh, Arceus-Water will not enjoy being poisoned, so a cleric is advised. Chansey or Blissey are the only true clerics in Ubers, being able to heal your team from status by using Heal Bell or Aromatherapy.</p>"
      },
      "Sun Support": {
        "description": "<p>Arceus-Water might seem to be a poor check to Kyogre, as it is weak to Thunder; however, it is actually the best support Arceus for a sun team to use to check the titanic whale. Not only does Arceus-Water excel defensively under sunlight, as Groudon's Drought reduces Thunder's accuracy to only 50%, but it also resists Ice Beam and Kyogre's Water-type STAB. Arceus-Water might also seem overshadowed by Arceus-Grass for this role, as it is able to hit Kyogre super effectively with its Grass-type STAB, and resists Kyogre's stronger auxiliary move. However, Arceus-Water can safely wall any Dragon-type relying on Dragon-, Fire-, and Electric-type coverage in sun, something Grass Arceus can't do due to its boosted Fire-type weakness. Arceus-Grass also doesn't have a hope in hell against Kyurem-W, whose STAB Ice Beam easily OHKOes it, while Arceus-Water is only heavily damaged by Choice Specs Draco Meteor. Lastly, Arceus-Water is one of the few Pokemon that can switch into Reshiram under the sun, and the lack of a quadruple Stealth Rock weakness makes Arceus-Water a more reliable switch in for the plumed fire-dragon than Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Recover gives Arceus-Water the longevity that it needs, allowing it to switch repeatedly into strong special attacks and regain lost HP. Ice Beam is used to check Rayquaza, as Arceus-Water is an excellent switch-in for the deadly wallbreaker; it also deals good damage to Groudon and hits quite a few Uber Pokemon super effectively. The third slot is dedicated to status; Thunder Wave cripples offensive Kyogre for the rest of the match, in addition to neutering a whole slew of offensive Pokemon; Will-O-Wisp provides valuable chip damage against anything that Ice Beam is incapable of hurting significantly, and it also cripples Pokemon that rely on their physical Attack. Flamethrower can be run if Arceus-Water does not need a status move, and gives it a way to damage Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Excadrill outside of Will-O-Wisp. In the last slot, a utility move is run; Roar gives Arceus-Water a way to phaze opponents on predicted switches and rack up hazard damage; Perish Song allows Arceus-Water to check bulkier Kyogre, especially ones with Rest and Sleep Talk, which Arceus-Water is incapable of hurting without a strong Grass- or Electric-type attack; Grass Knot can be used as well as it gives Arceus-Water a more reliable way of damaging Kyogre, although with no Special Attack investment, Kyogre will come out on top if it is running Calm Mind.</p> <p>The EVs give Arceus-Water maximum special bulk while still maintaining the ability to outspeed neutral-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon that have maximized their Speed investment. This is especially important to outspeed Modest Choice Specs Kyurem-W, whose Draco Meteor would 2HKO Arceus-Water otherwise. Special Attack and Defense EVs are not used because Arceus-Water really needs all that bulk to switch into the multitude of extremely powerful special attacks thrown about in the tier.</p> <p>Arceus-Water can choose to run Stealth Rock, Magic Coat, Judgment, or Refresh in the last slot, but their utility is much more situational than any of the other moves listed. Toxic can be used as a status move, but one should take advantage of Arceus-Water's access to lesser distributed forms of status.</p> <p>This set's premier partner is Groudon, whose eternal sunlight reduces Thunder's accuracy to a measly 50%; it can also switch into the many Electric-type attacks that plague Arceus-Water. Ferrothorn also makes an excellent partner, resisting both of Arceus-Water's weaknesses and setting up entry hazards to support it. Ultimately, one should remember that this set aims to support; and, as such, it is fairly self-reliant outside of Groudon, and doesn't need any other teammates to do its job.</p>"

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone possesses the unique ability to trap and kill Steel-types who resist Dragon-type moves, in particular the tiresome Ferrothorn, allowing the many Dragon-types of the Uber tier to fire off their otherwise unresisted STAB moves much more freely. With good defenses, as well as resistances to Dragon-, Dark-, and Ghost-type moves and the BoltBeam combination, Magnezone can switch in on a multitude of attacks. However, it does have a few notable weaknesses, including a 4x weakness to Ground-type attacks, so proper team support is necessary to allow it to perform its role effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magnezone can attempt to hold a Choice Scarf and be a revenge killer, but it is generally too slow to do so. Hidden Power Ground hits Dialga and Heatran for super effective damage, but does nothing otherwise. Thunder Wave can help to make up for Magnezone's low Speed, and provides support to its teammates. Explosion, although a powerful physical attack, does too little damage due to its nerf in BW to significantly hurt any of its potential targets, and will most of the time result in a dead Magnezone for nothing. Sturdy allows Magnezone to always survive at least one hit, but Magnet Pull lets it trap and easily set up on Steel-types, which is the main reason to use Magnezone.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Technically, when Magnezone has trapped its prey, it cannot be countered because switching cannot occur, unless the opposing Pokemon has Volt Switch or U-turn. However, there are still Pokemon who match up excellently against Magnezone. Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Garchomp are immune to Thunder and can easily OHKO with a 4x super effective Earthquake. Dugtrio can switch into any Choice-locked Electric-type attack and set up with Hone Claws while Magnezone can do nothing. Specially defensive Tyranitar can easily take all Magnezone's attacks barring Flash Cannon and OHKO with Earthquake or Low Kick. Non-Choice Dialga packing a Fire-type move can lure in and KO Magnezone, and Heatran can easily OHKO with Fire Blast or Earth Power as well. Opposing Magnezone can trap and KO your Magnezone if they have Hidden Power Fire, but you can still escape with Volt Switch if you win the Speed tie. Finally, Ferrothorn can still potentially defeat Magnezone if it carries Bulldoze, as rare as it is.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubCharge": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to take full advantage of Magnezone's Steel-trapping abilities. The combination of Substitute and Charge Beam is Magnezone's most effective way to remove Ferrothorn, probably the biggest roadblock to any Dragon-type's sweep. As long as Magnezone avoids switching into Thunder Wave or Leech Seed, and the opposing Ferrothorn lacks the extremely rare Bulldoze, Magnezone can easily set up a Substitute to stop Ferrothorn from Leech Seeding it, and then proceed to set up with Charge Beam. The best Ferrothorn can do is 2HKO Magnezone's Substitute with Power Whip, giving Magnezone plenty of time to set up. Once Magnezone gains enough boosts or begins to run low on HP, start smacking Ferrothorn around with boosted Thunders, while maintaining an intact Substitute. After Ferrothorn goes down, proceed to smack whatever comes in ridiculously hard. Hidden Power Ice is used in the final slot for maximum coverage alongside Thunder.</p> <p>Magnezone can use the same strategy against other Steel-types not named Dialga, Heatran, or Arceus-Steel. However, some Steel-types might try to prevent Magnezone from setting up on them. Skarmory can use Whirlwind against greedy Magnezone, while Forretress, non-Choice Band Scizor, and Jirachi can use Volt Switch or U-turn to escape. In these situations, it is best to just heavily damage them with Thunder instead of trying to set up.</p> <p>44 Speed EVs allow Magnezone to outspeed minimum Speed Scizor and severely damage it with Thunder before it gets to U-turn out. Special Attack is maximized for optimal power, while the rest go into HP to boost Magnezone's decent bulk. Flash Cannon can be used instead of Hidden Power Ice for STAB, as well as to hit Tyranitar super effectively, but as Hidden Power Ice is super effective against most of Magnezone's enemies, namely Groudon, Garchomp, and Zekrom, it is better in almost all situations.</p> <p>The most obvious teammates to Magnezone include Dragon-types, who appreciate the removal of Steel-types. Arceus-Dragon is extremely difficult to stop with the removal of Steel-types, as are Rayquaza, Salamence, Dialga, Reshiram, and Zekrom. Extreme Killer Arceus and other Swords Dance Arceus formes also appreciate Skarmory gone. The removal of Ferrothorn can be an issue for an opposing team, as most rain attackers, such as Choice Scarf Kyogre, Palkia, Kingdra, Omastar, Manaphy, Arceus-Electric, and Arceus-Water, suddenly become much stronger threats that utterly destroy teams with Ferrothorn gone. Kyogre in particular is a good teammate to Magnezone as Drizzle dampens Magnezone's Fire-type weakness while making Thunder perfectly accurate. Rapid Spin users are also extremely nice to have, because when Ferrothorn realizes it cannot defeat Magnezone, it might set up Spikes in Magnezone's face to spite you, and having a full set of Spikes on your side of the field is never, ever fun. Excadrill is an excellent Rapid Spin user, as it can defeat Giratina-O in the rain and easily take down Blissey and Chansey. Tentacruel is another great Rapid Spin user to run in the rain, because of its excellent Special Defense and access to a form of recovery in Rain Dish.</p> <p>Technically, once Magnezone has trapped the opposing Steel-type, it cannot be countered because countering involves switching. However, there are a number of Steel-types who do not care about Magnezone's presence at all. Dialga resists Thunder and takes virtually nothing from Hidden Power Ice, can use Fire Blast or Aura Sphere to destroy Magnezone, or just Roar it away if it so desires. Heatran can roast Magnezone with its Fire-type STAB or OHKO with Earth Power. Excadrill outspeeds Magnezone, is immune to Thunder, does not take much from a neutral Hidden Power Ice, and OHKOes in return with Earthquake. Groudon is also troublesome, as it OHKOes with Earthquake and cuts the accuracy of Thunder to 50% with Drought. Garchomp and Arceus-Ground also scare Magnezone away with the threat of Earthquake. Chansey and Blissey can take hits from Magnezone all day long. With that in mind, Lugia is a good teammate to Magnezone, as it walls Groudon, Garchomp, Arceus-Ground, Excadrill, and Dialga easily. Terrakion is also another great partner, as it does not care about Heatran and can send Chansey and Blissey to the next dimension with its powerful Fighting-type STAB.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs brings Magnezone's already excellent Special Attack up to 591, making it useful not only as a Steel-type trapper, but also as an offensive powerhouse. To illustrate this fact, standard Palkia, Lugia, Mewtwo, and specially defensive Forretress are always OHKOed by Thunder after Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Fire allows Magnezone to heavily damage Ferrothorn to the point where it cannot tank hits any more; it is also Magnezone's best option against Steel-types in the sun. However, if you desire coverage, then Hidden Power Ice works best, as it OHKOes Rayquaza and Garchomp while 2HKOing maximum HP Groudon. Volt Switch is used to scout, dealing good damage with Magnezone's excellent Special Attack, but Magnezone must be wary of Groudon and Garchomp, which are immune to it. Thunderbolt is more reliable if it isn't raining, but it is noticeably weaker than Thunder, so Volt Switch is generally the better choice for the third moveslot, allowing Magnezone to scout the opponent's team and build momentum. Flash Cannon is used to hurt Tyranitar and as a workable secondary STAB, but doesn't really have much other use.</p> <p>Maximum Special Attack is necessary to do as much damage as possible. Factoring in the imperfect Speed IV from Hidden Power Fire, 48 Speed EVs allow Magnezone to outrun and KO minimum Speed Scizor before it can U-turn out or KO with Superpower. The rest of the EVs go into HP for added bulk, which works well with Magnezone's excellent typing.</p> <p>Magnezone makes an excellent companion to Extreme Killer Arceus, as the removal of Steel-types allows Arceus to forgo Earthquake or Overheat for Recover or another coverage move. Dialga also makes a good teammate, because although it shares some weaknesses with Magnezone, it is a reliable user of Stealth Rock and appreciates having Steel-type Pokemon removed, clearing the way for it to do major damage with its STAB Dragon-type moves. Forretress and the Deoxys formes are reliable users of Spikes, and can also deploy Stealth Rock effectively.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screen": {
        "description": "<p>Magnezone's excellent resistances and good defenses allow it to set up dual screens easily. Magnet Pull allows Magnezone to trap and set up on most Steel-types , giving it an edge over Bronzong, which has Levitate and better overall defenses. Reflect and Light Screen help sweepers to set up, which can be potentially game-ending. Thunder does excellent damage, OHKOing Skarmory and 2HKOing Forretress and Scizor after Stealth Rock damage, and allowing Magnezone to remain a potent Steel-type trapper as well as a dual screen user. While the sheer power of Thunder is hard to ignore, Volt Switch is an interesting option as it allows Magnezone's frail teammates to get a relatively safe switch-in. Hidden Power Fire lets Magnezone take out Steel-types in the sun, which lowers Thunder's accuracy to 50%, but Explosion allows Magnezone to get a sweeper in for free.</p> <p>48 Speed EVs enable Magnezone to always outrun 0 Speed Scizor, allowing it to KO before Scizor U-turns to safety or KOes Magnezone with Superpower, while 252 HP EVs give Magnezone good overall bulk to take hits more easily while setting up screens. The rest go into Special Attack, and a Modest nature is used so Magnezone can still use Magnet Pull to hit Steel-types hard. Air Balloon is an alternate option over Light Clay, granting Magnezone a temporary immunity to Ground-type attacks, which helps it to set up dual screens. However, Light Clay's increase in the duration of Reflect and Light Screen generally makes it the better choice.</p> <p>As this Magnezone is focused on support more than attacking, the best teammates are sweepers that can take advantage of the dual screens and the removal of the foe's Steel-type Pokemon. The best choices are usually offensive Dragon-types, as they can come into most of Magnezone's checks and spam their STAB moves. Rayquaza, Salamence, Arceus-Dragon, and Giratina-O are good choices, as they cover all of Magnezone's weaknesses and have enough power and bulk to set up under the protection of Reflect and Light Screen. Extreme Killer Arceus under screens is a death sentence to offensive teams. It becomes virtually impossible to revenge kill, as the screens let it tank a hit from revenge killers and continue its sweep. Extreme Killer Arceus also appreciates Magnezone removing Skarmory for it.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran has a unique niche in Ubers due to its very valuable resistance to the extremely powerful and common Dragon-type attacks, as well as a unique set of other resistances backed by respectable bulk. In addition to absorbing Dragon-type attacks, Heatran can successfully roast other Steel-type Pokemon such as Forretress and Ferrothorn, who can otherwise be troublesome. With a Speed stat just good enough to outpace stall-based Pokemon and access to great moves such as Taunt, Roar, and Toxic--as well as the ability to scare away the aforementioned defensive Steel-types--Heatran is incredibly useful in Ubers as a stallbreaker. Although Heatran's Special Attack stat is nothing to scoff at, it is outclassed offensively by other Pokemon such as Reshiram and Ho-Oh. A STAB Fire-type attack will still pack a punch in the sun, though. Heatran is definitely worth using and can be a major threat to stall teams when played correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heatran is far less versatile in the Ubers environment, but other options are available. A Choice Specs set can be run, but Reshiram packs much more offensive power. The only reason to use Heatran instead of Reshiram is Heatran's typing, which gives it resistance to Dragon-type attacks and neutrality to Stealth Rock. A Life Orb can be used instead of Leftovers to pack an extra punch, but this is not recommended on a set with only one attack. Fire Blast can be used instead of Flamethrower or Lava Plume for a sizable power increase should you want to take down your enemies a little faster. Dragon Pulse is a very usable option, allowing Heatran to nail common Dragon-types that switch in, such as Palkia and Giratina. It can also be used to allow Heatran to pick off a Dragon-type such as Rayquaza locked into Outrage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Anything that can exploit Heatran's gaping 4x Ground-type weakness makes a decent check to it. Pokemon such as Garchomp, Ho-Oh, and Groudon with a few Speed EVs can outspeed and OHKO Heatran with Earthquake. Giratina-O can also OHKO Heatran with Earthquake, even though it is a rare move to be seen on the legendary dragon. However, these Pokemon aren't a major problem for Heatran, as it can simply switch out of danger. Kyogre can counter Heatran absolutely, as it takes pathetic damage from Flamethrower, and--in the case of RestTalk variants--does not mind being poisoned. Kyogre also summons rain, which halves the power of Flamethrower. While rain is in play, Pokemon such as Manaphy and Palkia can OHKO Heatran with ease.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Because of serious offensive competition from the likes of Reshiram, this set does what Heatran is best suited to in Ubers: stallbreaking. Because of its great bulk, typing, and movepool, Heatran can easily put a stop to defensive Pokemon and their stall-based shenanigans. Taunt is the crux of the set, stopping all Pokemon from recovering lost health, using status moves, and setting up entry hazards. Notable examples are Blissey and Chansey with Wish or Soft-Boiled, and Giratina with Rest. Although the common Steel-type Spikes users--Forretress and Ferrothorn--will usually switch out due to a type disadvantage, either of them can take Fire-type attacks from Heatran when its raining, making Taunt advisable in that situation. Heatran cannot prevent entry hazards from being set up all of the time, because it is likely that Ferrothorn or Forretress will have an opportunity to switch in on a different team member. Double switching is vital against those Pokemon, preventing entry hazards from being set up on your side, and increasing your own entry hazard damage, provided they are in play.</p> <p>Toxic is great on Heatran and deals increasing damage to opponents. Whereas it is useless against most stall-oriented Pokemon--Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Forretress being immune and Blissey having Natural Cure--it can, however, be useful for poisoning common switch-ins to Heatran such as Palkia, Giratina, Kyogre, and Lugia. Ferrothorn can easily switch in on Palkia, setting up entry hazards while Palkia's health slowly withers away. In the case of Giratina, Heatran can use Taunt, preventing it from healing itself with Rest, and resists most of its attacks apart from a rare Earthquake. Kyogre spells trouble for Heatran, so poisoning and switching to something that walls Kyogre is the best that Heatran can do. Roar can shuffle the opponent's team, and is useful when the opponent switches. Roar also stacks entry hazard damage, and can take chunks of HP from Pokemon weak to Rock-type attacks, such as Reshiram, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza. Pokemon that might attempt to set up on Heatran, such as Rayquaza, are in for a surprise, as they can be easily phazed out.</p> <p>Flamethrower rounds off the set, and is Heatran's only attacking move. It is used over Fire Blast, as the perfect accuracy and extra PP are appreciated on less offensive sets. Flamethrower can toast Steel-type Pokemon, and do decent damage to others, especially under the sun, 3HKOing Blissey and Giratina and 2HKOing Lugia, assuming Stealth Rock is in play. Lava Plume is an alternative to Flamethrower, sacrificing the extra damage for a larger burn chance, which can be useful for halving a Pokemon's Attack stat and inflicting passive damage every turn. Protect is also an option to stack Leftovers recovery, as well as scout a Choice-locked Pokemon's attacks.</p> <p>The EV spread is straightforward: 252 HP ensures that Heatran is bulky and is capable of taking hits. 108 Speed allows Heatran to outspeed Pokemon with base 90 Speed and no Speed investment, such as Groudon, Giratina, and Deoxys-D. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Defense with a Calm nature, letting Heatran take powerful Dragon-type attacks, which are usually special. Heatran can also take hits from Mewtwo and Darkrai with Special Defense investment. An Aura Sphere from a 252 SpA Mewtwo will do just over 50% damage to Heatran, and Heatran is never OHKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Focus Blast from Darkrai.</p> <p>Sun support from Groudon is a blessing for Heatran, as its Fire-type attacks gain a boost, and it loses its Water-type weakness. This will also ensure an eventual Kyogre switch-in, allowing Heatran to cripple it with Toxic. As well as providing sun support, Groudon has access to Stealth Rock, and can take powerful physical hits for Heatran. Ferrothorn is also another great partner, laying Spikes, and walling Kyogre. A Ghost-type such as Giratina-O or Arceus-Ghost is also advised, as it can cover Heatran's Fighting-type weakness, as well as block Rapid Spin.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Heatran has an excellent typing that makes it a great defensive check to some of the metagame's most dangerous Pokemon. In particular, Heatran is capable of checking most Rayquaza and Ho-Oh variants, which is invaluable for slower, defensive teams. Because it can check so many Pokemon, it's a reliable Stealth Rock setter especially against sun teams focused on Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Lava Plume is a solid STAB move for Heatran that is also very useful for its high burn rate. As Choice Specs Kyogre is a common and safe switch-in, Protect is incredibly important to Heatran to scout Kyogre's move choice. It also helps to rack up passive damage from a Lave Plume burn or Toxic poison, and gives Heatran an extra turn of Leftovers to help with its glaring lack of reliable recovery. Roar allows Heatran to phaze out the threats it is supposed to check and is great with entry hazards for punishing switches. Stealth Rock allows Heatran to provide valuable utility for the team but if you have the move someplace else you can use Toxic instead to cripple Pokemon with a death timer.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Heatran's physical bulk with a small amount invested in Special Defense so that Heatran will always survive Darkrai's Life Orb-boosted Focus Blast at full health. You can choose to move all the Defense investment into Special Defense if you use your Heatran for checking special attackers such as Latios. Air Balloon can be used to give Heatran a temporary immunity to Ground-type attacks and make Heatran serve as a coutner to SubToxic Gliscor. Stone Edge allows Heatran to OHKO Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock if just phazing it out isn't enough for your team. Hidden Power Ice can OHKO Rayquaza after Stealth Rock but doesn't have any other use. Taunt can pester stall teams and prevent Ferrothorn from having a chance to use Spikes in the rain.</p> <p>Arceus-Grass is THE Heatran partner. The two have such fantastic synergy together as Arceus-Grass covers Heatran's Kyogre and Palkia weaknesses while Heatran can take care of Genesect and Ho-Oh for Arceus-Grass. Together, Heatran and Arceus-Grass check the metagame's biggest threats such as Palkia, Ho-Oh, Kyogre, Rayquaza, to a certain extent Zekrom, as well as many others. Heatran is also effective in general against sun teams while Arceus-Grass tends to be difficult for many rain teams to handle. The duo has the advantage of being effective under any weather conditions, although for non-rain teams, you will need a secondary Palkia check, such as Deoxys-D. However, Kyogre is particularly effective with this core as it covers a number of weaknesses that the core struggles with, such as Arceus-Ghost.</p> <p>Spikes support is helpful for Heatran as it forces a lot of switches thanks to its typing and makes its Roar much more dangerous in general. Deoxys-D and Skarmory have the best synergy with Heatran. Deoxys-D can check Arceus-Fighting and non-rain Palkia which tend to pester Heatran while Skarmory is good for Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Ghost.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Heatran can act as a potent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf and sun support, capable of revenge killing Darkrai, Mewtwo, and weakened Arceus. Its Steel typing is a huge asset over Choice Scarf Reshiram, granting Heatran an invaluable resistance to Extreme Speed, immunity to Toxic, and a neutrality to Stealth Rock. Overheat is Heatran's STAB move of choice, OHKOing Darkrai and Mewtwo in sunlight and dealing a massive amount of damage to Arceus. Hidden Power Rock, alongside Heatran's typing and Flash Fire ability, allows Heatran to check Ho-Oh, who is otherwise a serious threat to sun teams. However, Hidden Power Ice is also an option for its ability to OHKO Rayquaza. Dragon Pulse hits Palkia, Giratina-O, and Giratina for moderate damage, the latter two being unable to do much in return. Flamethrower provides a reliable STAB move for late-game sweeping, whereas Fire Blast obtains notable 2HKOs in the sun where Flamethrower cannot; more specifically Bulk Up Dialga and Arceus. Earth Power is also usable as it deals with other Heatran easily, and is Heatran's strongest option against Dialga in the rain. Heatran is an excellent check for Dialga in general, as few carry Aura Sphere and fewer still carry Earth Power.</p> <p>The EV spread shouldn't need much explanation, but a Timid nature is necessary, as Heatran cannot outspeed Darkrai or Mewtwo without it. Groudon support is vital for this set's success, as the raw power of Heatran's sun-backed STAB Fire-type moves is one of this set's biggest appeals. Entry hazard support is also important for this set, as Arceus needs to be weakened a bit before Heatran can safely take it out in one shot. A layer of Spikes also guarantees that Overheat will nearly always OHKO 252/4 Groudon, even after a turn of Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>Kyogre is this set's worst nightmare, so Pokemon that can handle it, notably Ferrothorn for its ability to supply entry hazards, are necessary. Other good examples of Pokemon that can manage Kyogre are Palkia, Zekrom, and Giratina-O, the last of whom has incredible typing synergy with Heatran and also checks Groudon. Heatran does have the option of running Explosion to deal a bit of damage to Kyogre, but this generally is not worth the moveslot given Explosion's relative weakness.</p>"

  "Shiftry": {
    "overview": "<p>Many players instantly turn to Darkrai when looking for a fast Dark-type sweeper to use in Ubers, but teams carrying Groudon have another option they can consider. Shiftry isn't powerful by Uber standards, but it has Chlorophyll, which is a great ability in Ubers, as well as an excellent offensive typing for the metagame. Though it can augment its sub par Special Attack through Nasty Plot, due to its frailty it needs to select when it goes for the boost very carefully. Shiftry needs the support of its teammates to work well, but it can certainly pay off when played correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shiftry has higher base Attack than Special Attack, but Seed Bomb is a far weaker STAB move than Grass Knot, and Sucker Punch, while better than Dark Pulse in some cases, has some drawbacks. Extreme Speed, a common move in Ubers, bypasses Sucker Punch with its +2 priority and usually OHKOes the frail Shiftry. Sucker Punch also leaves Shiftry unable to touch certain walls, such as Giratina, who can burn Shiftry with Will-O-Wisp without fear. Leaf Storm is a slightly more powerful STAB move than Grass Knot, and can be used on a 4-attacks set. Icy Wind decreases the opponent's Speed, but, unlike Hidden Power Ice, requires Stealth Rock to be up in order to OHKO Rayquaza. Tailwind doubles Shiftry's Speed, as well as that of its teammates, but Shiftry might as well use Nasty Plot if it has a turn to use Tailwind.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ho-Oh is the biggest counter to this set due to its insane special bulk and STAB Sacred Fire. Kyogre robs Shiftry of its precious sunlight with Drizzle, and a Choice Scarf set can outspeed and OHKO Shiftry. Chansey and Blissey both wall Shiftry effortlessly, and neither are even OHKOed by a +2 Low Kick. Priority also makes short work of Shiftry. Arceus and Rayquaza can massacre Shiftry with Extreme Speed, and the latter even outspeeds Shiftry due to Air Lock. Scizor can pick Shiftry off with Bullet Punch and only fears Hidden Power Fire. More niche priority users, such Ice Shard Mamoswine and Vacuum Wave Toxicroak, also get the job done. Shiftry is not blisteringly fast in the sun either. Very fast Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Terrakion, Darkrai, and Shaymin-S, can all outspeed and revenge kill it. Blaziken easily threatens Shiftry and doesn't take too much damage from any of Shiftry's moves bar Focus Blast. It can also outspeed Shiftry after two turns thanks to Speed Boost.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Shiftry is a very capable late game cleaner, capable of finishing off the opponent's team if it has been weakened significantly. Nasty Plot makes walling Shiftry very difficult. Due to Shiftry's frailty, however, it can only boost up when an opponent is expected to switch, or against a weak resisted move, such as Ferrothorn's Power Whip. Grass Knot hits for 120 Base Power against many Uber Pokemon, most notably against Kyogre, one of the biggest threats to dedicated sun teams. Dark Pulse hits a fair number of Uber Pokemon for super effective damage, the most prominent being Mewtwo and Giratina-O. The chance to flinch can also come in handy given Shiftry's high Speed stat in the sun. Focus Blast provides valuable coverage against Ferrothorn, Dialga, and Arceus, but Hidden Power Fire nails Ferrothorn and Scizor while lacking the drawback of shaky accuracy.</p> <p>A Life Orb and a Modest nature are necessary, since Shiftry needs every bit of power that it can get. Because Shiftry outspeeds so many Choice Scarf Pokemon in the sun, such as Palkia, Torment is an interesting choice. With it, Shiftry can come in on a choice-locked Pokemon, use Torment, and grab a Nasty Plot boost as the opponent is forced to use Struggle. Ho-Oh is one of the biggest threats to Shiftry, so Hidden Power Rock can be considered to help deal with it. Likewise, Hidden Power Ice can be used to OHKO Rayquaza and hit Zekrom a bit harder. Shiftry can also opt to use Low Kick, a Naive Nature, and run Growth over Nasty Plot so that it has a better shot at breaking through Chansey or Blissey.</p> <p>It cannot be stressed enough that Shiftry must be supported by Groudon. Without Drought, Shiftry becomes essentially useless. Though it can work on any team that has a Groudon, Shiftry fits best on dedicated sun teams. Ho-Oh is a common fixture on these kinds of teams, and it covers Shiftry's weaknesses well. Entry hazard support is also essential to Shiftry's sweep, so Pokemon that can reliably provide Spikes, such as Forretress and Ferrothorn, are greatly appreciated. Groudon itself can provide Stealth Rock. Dual screen support helps to compensate for Shiftry's frailty and makes it easier for it to set up. Deoxys-S can set up both screens, and can also use Spikes to further support Shiftry.</p>"

  "Giratina-Origin": {
    "overview": "<p>When talk comes of spinblockers in the Uber tier, it is impossible to not mention the holy trinity—Arceus-Ghost, the Father, Giratina, the Son, and of course, Giratina-O, the Holy Spirit. Trying to distinguish which one of them is the best is like trying to decide who is the best classical music composer out of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven. On the surface, it may appear that Giratina-O is outclassed by the two other parts of the trinity. It does not appear to be as dangerous offensively as Arceus-Ghost, which is faster, has less weaknesses and has Recover; it is also not as good defensively as Giratina, which boasts higher defenses and the ability to hold Leftovers. The biggest problem is the fact that Giratina-O lacks reliable recovery, which means that every bit of damage counts. However, despite this flaw, Giratina-O remains a fierce competitor for the title of being the best spinblocker in the entire game. This is largely due to its ability, Levitate, which gives it an immunity to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, both of which are used excessively in Ubers. Furthermore, unlike Giratina, Giratina-O's Dragon Tail is quite powerful, allowing it to fully abuse the entry hazards that it keeps down due to its Ghost-typing. Never overlook the power of Giratina-O, lest you end up like Team Galactic Boss Cyrus, wandering around the Distortion World and being fed its nightmares for all of eternity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Giratina-O can run an offensive Calm Mind set with max Speed and three attacks, but is mostly outclassed by Arceus-Ghost in this role, which boasts higher Speed and a typing that makes it harder to revenge kill. A Calm Mind RestTalk set is another option, but with BW's sleep mechanics and the relative ease of stopping such a set, it is not as useful as it was in DPP. A set comprised of Substitute and Shadow Force looks relatively enticing, especially if coupled with Toxic Spikes, but Shadow Force is rather easy to play around. Giratina-O also has access to Hone Claws, but generally has better things to do. Thunder Wave is an interesting option for Giratina-O. Like many Pokemon, however, Giratina-O does not have much use for Thunder Wave, as it has better things to do. Likewise, Toxic can be used, but justifying its use over Will-O-Wisp is difficult. Destiny Bond can be a nasty surprise for Pokemon such as Dialga that think they can easily take down Giratina-O. Pain Split can be used as a source of recovery for Giratina-O, but you must be very careful in using it due to Giratina-O's massive HP stat, and you may end up losing health instead of gaining it a majority of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There are three general ways of dealing with Giratina-O. There are Pokemon that don't care about anything that Giratina-O does. If Stealth Rock is not up, Ho-Oh does not care about anything Giratina-O does outside of the rare Stone Edge. Lugia, in general, is bulky enough to take on most anything Giratina-O throws at it and has reliable recovery to get its health back. The only exception are SubCM versions with Shadow Ball, against which Lugia would be forced to take a large amount of damage before forcing Giratina-O out with Whirlwind, unless Multiscale is intact. Bulky Arceus formes that are not weak to Giratina-O generally do not mind it either. Wallceus gets a special mention due to its physical bulk, access to Leftovers, and Will-O-Wisp to weaken Dragon Tail, as well as Roar to force Giratina-O out first.</p> <p>If you do not carry these Pokemon, however, it is important to remember that with the likely presence of entry hazards, it is difficult to counter Giratina-O directly, since Dragon Tail would force your counter to take a lot of damage along with the entry hazards and will likely force you into a poor matchup. This is why having Pokemon that can absorb Dragon Tail relatively well, as well as having Pokemon that can outright KO Giratina-O, is very important. The general strategy is to allow a Pokemon that can absorb Dragon Tails to take them and then wait for a favourable matchup. Pokemon that can absorb Dragon Tail tend to have substantial passive recovery, resistance or immunity to entry hazards, and/or high effective Defense or a resistance to Dragon Tail. Gliscor is an excellent example. Its large Defense stat means it can take Dragon Tail relatively well, while Poison Heal allows it to recover lost health quickly. Landorus-T and (if Stealth Rock is not up) Gyarados can Intimidate Giratina-O to weaken Dragon Tail. If Stealth Rock is not up, Tornadus-T, while taking significant damage from Dragon Tail, recovers most of it due to Regenerator, making it a decent switch-in to Giratina-O. Skarmory also takes Dragon Tail quite well, while having Roost to regain what little health it loses. If Spikes are not up, then bulky Steel-types such as Arceus-Steel, Bronzong, and Jirachi can also take Dragon Tail quite easily. Arceus-Steel is especially useful for the fact that if it does not come in on Dragon Tail, it can force Giratina-O out with Roar first. Another way to make it difficult for Giratina-O is making it take residual damage while spamming Dragon Tail. Ferrothorn forces Giratina-O to take a lot of residual damage every time it is hit by Dragon Tail due to Iron Barbs, and Rocky Helmet Skarmory can do something similar. Just be very careful that some Giratina-O may be running a mixed set; switching your Landorus-T into an incoming Draco Meteor can prove incredibly costly.</p> <p>As for Pokemon that take down Giratina-O, the list is quite long. These include any strong Dragon-type, Darkrai, Arceus-Ghost, Arceus-Dark, and Tyranitar. If a physical Pokemon is being used for this role, just make sure that it doesn't get it burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Finally, unless you have the Pokemon that do not care about Giratina-O as a whole, the above strategy of absorbing Dragon Tail and hoping for a good matchup often falls flat against the SubCM variant. It is therefore, a good idea to scout Giratina-O's set just in case. The SubCM set, if lacking Shadow Ball, can be defeated by Deoxys-D that has Taunt, Night Shade, and Recover, as well as Arceus-Ghost, and if lacking Thunder as well, Lugia. If Giratina-O lacks Aura Sphere, then Ferrothorn with Gyro Ball can check it, as can Tyranitar. If it lacks Thunder, Kyogre will cause it trouble in general. Skarmory can also Whirlwind Giratina-O out quite easily as well if it lacks Thunder. If Giratina-O lacks Dragon Pulse, then Latias has a better chance of taking it down, as can most Dragon-types in the tier.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of pretty much all of Giratina-O's fabulous qualities. If given a free turn, it is a monster. Dragon Tail is the main attack, allowing Giratina-O to deal respectable damage while simultaneously racking up entry hazard damage. Shadow Sneak picks off wounded opponents from all the entry hazard damage, while also allowing Giratina-O to check weakened Latias, Latios, Arceus-Ghost, and Mewtwo. For the third slot, Earthquake is preferred as it hits many Rapid Spinners for heavy damage, most notably Mold Breaker Excadrill, Tentacruel, and Kabutops, and also allows Giratina-O to hit Tyranitar for super effective damage. However, Will-O-Wisp allows Giratina-O to cripple many physical attackers, most notably ExtremeKiller Arceus and Groudon.</p> <p>As for the final slot, Substitute is the best option, as it allows Giratina-O to avoid status and gives it free rein to spam Dragon Tail. Magic Coat, however, stops Giratina-O from becoming hazard fodder, doing very well against Spiking leads, as well as surprising Darkrai that think they can spam Dark Void indiscriminately.</p> <p>Outrage can be used in the third or fourth slot for more power. Aqua Tail can be used on rain teams to hit Gliscor. Stone Edge can be used to OHKO Ho-Oh. However, these moves are relatively specific and therefore you should only use them to plug up certain holes in your team.</p> <p>Maximum Attack EVs allows Dragon Tail to be as powerful as possible. 84 Speed EVs allow Giratina-O to outspeed minimum Speed Tentacruel and Jirachi, and smack them incredibly hard with Earthquake. 164 HP EVs gives Giratina-O a large amount of bulk while minimizing damage from Stealth Rock, and the rest go into Defense to give Genesect, which tend to run a physical Choice Scarf set, a Special Attack boost.</p> <p>One thing to remember when using Giratina-O is that while is it is a very sturdy spinblocker, it needs to be careful in switching into common Rapid Spinners, as they have many ways to disrupt it. Forretress and Excadrill often carry Toxic, Kabutops can hit Giratina-O very hard with Stone Edge, while Tentacruel can either burn Giratina-O with Scald, or use Ice Beam for chip damage that prevents Giratina-O from setting up Substitutes.</p> <p>Being a spinblocker, Giratina-O obviously operates best when the opponent's side is littered with entry hazards. Forretress, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Deoxys-S are just a few of the good entry hazard users in the metagame. Since Giratina-O has no means of recovery, Wish and Heal Bell support is highly appreciated. Chansey and Blissey can provide both relatively reliably, while synergizing well with Giratina-O. Jirachi can also pass relatively large Wishes to Giratina-O. In terms of weather, Giratina-O prefers sun or rain, since they do not cause it to take residual damage, meaning that Groudon and Kyogre are good teammates. In the same vein, removing Stealth Rock through Rapid Spin also helps Giratina-O last longer. Excadrill, Kabutops, Tentacruel, Starmie, and Forretress are the most reliable Rapid Spin users in the tier. Rapid Spin also helps the fact that Giratina-O tends to attract entry hazard layers, and even if Giratina-O is immune to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, they are still detrimental to the rest of its team.</p> <p>Pokemon that can take on Giratina-O's weaknesses are obvious teammates. Arceus-Fighting with Toxic, RestTalk Kyogre, and Ho-Oh are excellent counters to Darkrai and Arceus-Ghost. A Darkrai of your own can also take on Arceus-Ghost. Steel-types can switch into Dragon-types that seek to beat down Giratina-O. Many of those Steel-types can also set up entry hazards that Giratina-O can so readily abuse. A number of these Steel-types, such as Jirachi and Arceus-Steel, can also take on Kyurem-W which also poses a great threat to Giratina-O.</p> <p>Lugia tends to not care about anything Giratina-O can do, apart from Toxic that can get bounced back by Magic Coat. Darkrai, Zekrom, and Kyurem-W can also defeat Lugia quite easily. Ho-Oh that invest EVs into Defense take zero net damage from Dragon Tail due to Regenerator. The easiest way to deal with these two is to set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible, which is rather convenient, as Giratina-O block Rapid Spin. The only Pokemon left that stops Stealth Rock are Pokemon with the ability, Magic Bounce. Fortunately, the Pokemon that have Magic Bounce are generally quite weak and fragile. Dialga sets up Stealth Rock very reliably against Xatu and Espeon. Deoxys-A is generally too threatening for Xatu and Espeon to block, while Mold Breaker Excadrill ignores Magic Bounce completely.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to address the biggest thorn in Giratina-O's side—the lack of recovery. This set allows Giratina-O to last longer and care less about residual damage. This set also allows Giratina-O to take advantage of +0 priority phazing when it is asleep with Sleep Talk. The last slot depends on what you want Giratina-O to do. Roar is preferred to maximize +0 priority phazing, which gives a higher chance for Giratina-O to phaze. Shadow Sneak lets Giratina-O revenge kill Deoxys-A, weakened Mewtwo, Latios, and Latias, while Outrage allows Giratina-O to hit hard, and does not lock it in when it is asleep.</p> <p>Max Speed and a Jolly nature allow Giratina-O to at the least speed-tie with all Pokemon with base 90 Speed, allowing it force out as many Pokemon as possible. If Giratina-O is using Outrage, it also allows Giratina-O to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza and revenge kill it. The EVs can be changed, however. Giratina-O can either invest in Attack or Defense at the cost of Speed. Attack EVs can be used to patch up Dragon Tail's low base power, while Defense EVs allow Giratina-O to take on Extreme Killer Arceus and other physical attackers better. In terms of other moves that can be used in the last moveslot, Hidden Power Fire can be used to defeat Forretress, Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Groudon, and Earthquake can be used to hit Tyranitar and Excadrill for super effective damage. If Giratina-O is not using Shadow Sneak, it may be a good idea to carry a relatively sturdy Mewtwo check, as Shadow Sneak goes a long in helping to take it down.</p> <p>Entry hazard layers thrive with Giratina-O's spinblocking support. Rapid Spin users are ideal teammates, as Giratina-O tends to be helpless in stopping opposing entry hazard layers, unless Hidden Power Fire (for Forretress) or Shadow Sneak (for Deoxys-S) is used. While this Giratina-O set has usable recovery, it still prefers to not get hit by sandstorm or hail, therefore Groudon or Kyogre support are still preferred.</p> <p>RestTalk Kyogre, Arceus-Fighting with Toxic, and Ho-Oh are excellent counters to Darkrai, Arceus-Ghost, and Arceus-Dark, which can all threaten Giratina-O. Kyogre and Ho-Oh also handle Kyurem-W relatively well. Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Forretress, Arceus-Steel, and Scizor can switch into Dragon-types. A Darkrai of your own, as well as Kyurem-W and Zekrom, can easily take out Lugia, while Arceus-Rock counters Ho-Oh.</p>"

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>A staple of late DPP and early BW, mixed attacking Giratina-O takes full advantage of its offensive prowess. It is an excellent check to offensive Ground-types, namely Groudon and Landorus-T. Draco Meteor obliterates Groudon that do not invest in Special Defense while hitting very hard in general. Shadow Sneak revenge kills weakened Psychic-types and Arceus-Ghost. Dragon Tail allows Giratina-O to do what it normally does (take advantage of entry hazards), although Outrage can be used to 2HKO Ho-Oh. Hidden Power Fire is the most preferable option as it OHKOes Forretress in the sun and severely damages it in neutral weather, while also 2HKOing Ferrothorn. Thunder is the better move to use in the rain to hit Steel-types, 2HKOing Skarmory, as well as hitting Kyogre very hard. Earthquake allows Giratina-O to 2HKO both Tyranitar and Excadrill.</p> <p>Max Attack and Special Attack is preferred as it allows Giratina-O to hit as hard as possible, leaning more towards Attack since Giratina-O's weaker attacks (Shadow Sneak and Dragon Tail) are physical, and thus need as much investment as possible. A good EV spread if you're using Hidden Power Fire is 248 Atk / 64 SpA / 196 Spe with a Naive nature. This allows Giratina-O to outspeed Swords Dance Rayquaza and revenge kill it with Draco Meteor. If you're using Thunder, 112 Atk / 204 SpA / 192 Spe with a Naive nature still outspeeds Adamant Rayquaza, and the additional Special Attack allows Giratina-O to 3HKO Forretress.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp allows Giratina-O to cripple physical attackers such as Groudon and ExtremeKiller Arceus. Substitute eases prediction, and Stone Edge OHKOes Ho-Oh. Magic Coat allows Giratina-O to bounce Dark Void back at Darkrai, as well as bounce back entry hazards. Tailwind can either allow Giratina-O to clean up late-game or facilitate a teammate's sweep. If Tailwind is used, Outrage is preferable to Dragon Tail as the physical STAB attack, due to its lack of negative priority.</p> <p>Entry hazard layers thrive with Giratina-O serving as a spinblocker. Depending on the choice of last attack, sun or rain support is appreciated. If Hidden Power Fire is used, Groudon support allows Giratina-O to OHKO Forretress, while Kyogre is an ideal teammate if Giratina-O is using Thunder. Giratina-O also appreciates Wish support from Blissey, Chansey, or Jirachi.</p> <p>RestTalk Kyogre, Arceus-Fighting with Toxic, and Ho-Oh are once again excellent counters to Darkrai, Arceus-Ghost, and Arceus-Dark, which can all threaten Giratina-O as per usual. Kyogre and Ho-Oh also handle Kyurem-W relatively well. Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Forretress, Arceus-Steel, and Scizor can switch into Dragon-types. A Darkrai of your own, as well as Kyurem-W and Zekrom, can easily defeat Lugia, while Arceus-Rock counters Ho-Oh.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Originally Giratina-O's flagship set, this set has fallen out of favor mainly due to the other sets being more versatile, as well as Arceus-Ghost being a more reliable Calm Mind user. However, this set still has distinct advantages. The ability to create massive Substitutes, coupled with immunity to Toxic Spikes, allow Giratina-O to set up easily on classic stall teams that are relatively slow and lacking in firepower. With its Ghost-typing and a number of other resistances, Giratina-O can set up easily on Seismic Toss and other weak attacks. In general, a classic stall team would have to either sacrifice or allow heavy damage to be taken by a key Pokemon, usually Latias, to take down Giratina-O. This allows you to take advantage of that hole with other sweepers.</p> <p>Dragon Pulse is the preferred STAB attack as it is more powerful, while hitting the numerous Dragon-types in the metagame such as Palkia for super effective damage. Shadow Ball, while weaker, hits Lugia and Arceus-Ghost for super effective damage, two Pokemon that can be seen on stall teams. It also hits stall Mewtwo for super effective damage. As for the last slot, Aura Sphere best complements Dragon Pulse or Shadow Ball for its ability to hit Steel-types, most notably Ferrothorn and Excadrill, as well as being the only attack that can threaten Tyranitar. Thunder hits most Steel-types with the exception of Excadrill and Forretress hard, as well hitting Skarmory for super effective damage. It also hits Lugia for super effective damage, making it a good choice if Shadow Ball is not used. It also smacks Kyogre incredibly hard. Finally, Shadow Ball can be used as a secondary STAB attack which is Giratina-O's best weapon against Jirachi as well as being able to hit Arceus-Ghost while keeping Dragon Pulse. However, its inability to hit most other Steel-types makes it relatively undesirable.</p> <p>The EVs listed allow Giratina-O to survive an Outrage from Choice Scarf Garchomp, as well as Choice Scarf Spacial Rend from Palkia without a Calm Mind boost. The remainder is put into Special Attack and a Modest nature is used to give Giratina-O as much power as possible. In terms of other moves that Giratina-O can use, Hidden Power Fire can be used to OHKO Forretress and deal huge damage to Ferrothorn, however, it is quite weak otherwise. Earth Power can used to OHKO Heatran and deal significant damage to Tyranitar.</p> <p>Giratina-O, being a stallbreaker, works by forcing key Pokemon on stall teams to sacrifice themselves to take it down. This allows other Pokemon to take advantage of the absence of those key defenders. For example, a boosting Giratina-O would force Latias to come in and stop it, severely damaging itself in the process. Pokemon such as Calm Mind Kyogre, Lustrous Orb Palkia, and Calm Mind Arceus-Fighting pose a much bigger threat with Latias out of commission. If using Thunder, it can lure in Pokemon such as Lugia and specially defensive Kyogre to take a lot of damage to phaze it out. Again, Calm Mind Arceus-Fighting works well with these two severely damaged. Kyurem-W finds much easier to mindlessly spam Ice Beam when Kyogre is out of the way.</p> <p>Giratina-O can obviously still act as a spinblocker with its Ghost-typing, which means the more entry hazards on the opposing side, the better. If Thunder is used, then Kyogre support is preferred for perfect accuracy, although it is not compulsory. Giratina-O also appreciates Wish support from Blissey, Chansey, or Jirachi.</p> <p>Depending on the moves used, Giratina-O will find it hard to bust through certain Pokemon. If it lacks Shadow Ball, it will find it hard to get past Arceus-Ghost, Deoxys-D, or (if Giratina-O also lacks Thunder) Lugia. If it lacks Aura Sphere, it will fail to defeat Tyranitar and will also have problems against Ferrothorn that carries Gyro Ball. If it lacks Dragon Pulse, it will potentially have a lot more trouble against balanced and offensive teams that have more powerful Dragon-types. Darkrai is an excellent teammate to run alongside SubCM Giratina-O to defeat Arceus-Ghost and Lugia. Groudon and other bulky Ground-types defeat Tyranitar as well as being able to defeat Ferrothorn. Arceus-Fighting does something very similar. For Dragon-types that threaten to take down Giratina-O, Steel-types are obviously the best Pokemon to go to. Arceus-Steel, Jirachi, Forretress, and Ferrothorn are just a few of many good Steel-types.</p>"

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresselia's amazing defenses and ability Levitate allow it to wall some of the most powerful attackers in the game, such as Salamence, Rayquaza, Groudon, Garchomp, Palkia, Giratina-O, Arceus-Ground, Terrakion, and more. A decent support movepool allows it to support the team through methods such as Thunder Wave, Toxic, Safeguard, dual screens, or even Trick Room. Cresselia lacks a Rock- or Electric-type weakness, meaning it takes neutral damage from Stealth Rock, Stone Edge, Bolt Strike, and Thunder, while sporting roughly the same physical durability as Lugia.</p> <p>Cresselia's main flaws are its inability to phaze like Lugia, laughable offensive stats (especially by Uber standards), and vulnerability to Toxic. Cresselia's weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-types also hamper its tanking ability. Lugia overshadows Cresselia for the most part, due to the latter's limited movepool, overall inferior stats, and the need for sun support in order to have reliable recovery in the form of Moonlight. The inability to counter Extreme Killer Arceus also hampers Cresselia's usability as a physical wall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If you desire more Speed, a faster Cresselia can be used to outspeed slow base 90 Speed foes, but this is generally an inferior version. Calm Mind is just awful even with Cresselia's defenses due to being outclassed by Lugia, who has better offensive stats and much higher Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Dark-types, such as Darkrai, Arceus-Dark, and Tyranitar, are the best ways to take Cresselia out. Arceus-Dark makes Cresselia cry and can threaten to OHKO the entire stall team. Arceus-Dark Judgments can easily fell Cresselia in two hits. Tyranitar can 2HKO Cresselia with Crunch, or even Pursuit the celestial duck as it switches. Kyogre and Dialga can freely set up on Cresselia with Calm Mind or Bulk Up. Choice Specs Kyogre and Reshiram can even OHKO Cresselia with their ridiculously powerful special attacks.</p> <p>Spikes users, such as Skarmory, Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Deoxys-D, completely wall Cresselia and use it as setup bait. All of the aforementioned Pokemon laugh at Cresselia's weak Ice Beam, while the former three also boast an immunity to Toxic. Anything with Toxic can cripple Cresselia. Bug-types such as Heracross and Scizor can 2HKO Cresselia with their powerful STAB moves, although they don't really like to be paralyzed. Heracross loves Toxic since it activates Guts and enables Heracross to OHKO Cresselia with Megahorn. Blissey walls Cresselia completely and can status it or set up on it with Calm Mind. Chansey does the same, though it cannot utilize Calm Mind effectively. Anything with Taunt, such as Heatran and Skarmory, can stop all Cresselia sets completely since Cresselia lacks power.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dual Screens + Lunar Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Cresselia's fantastic defensive stats make it a very reliable Trick Room user. While its weaknesses to common Dark- and Ghost-type attacks somewhat hamper its walling capacity, Cresselia can actually survive even super effective hits. The combination of Trick Room and Lunar Dance on this set is unique to Cresselia and is something Lugia cannot do. Additionally, Cresselia's lower Speed compared to Lugia becomes an advantage under the effects of Trick Room.</p> <p>Cresselia is extremely bulky, so it can utilize dual screens and Trick Room effectively to support an entire team based on Trick Room. Cresselia can turn the tables on common Pokemon who love to come in on it, such as Forretress, and use them as setup bait. You can switch Cresselia in on a Pokemon who can do little to harm it, particularly Blissey, Lugia, Giratina, Groudon, or even Forretress and Ferrothorn if your team doesn't mind entry hazards, then proceed to set up dual screens and Trick Room. Late-game, use Lunar Dance to fully heal one of your sweepers under the protection of dual screens. One must never use this Cresselia set as a physical wall, since the other set performs that role much better. Instead of utilizing a fast Cresselia to set up screens more quickly, one should focus on Cresselia's sheer bulk, since Cresselia isn't outspeeding anything significant even with max Speed.</p> <p>Cresselia should be used alongside powerful sweepers who benefit from dual screen and Trick Room support, such as Calm Mind Giratina-O, Zekrom, Swords Dance Groudon, Kyogre, Reshiram, or Dialga. If your team doesn't need Trick Room support, feel free to drop it for another support move. Safeguard can be used if your team fears status, while Thunder Wave allows Cresselia to cripple a speedy threat such as Darkrai. If you are using this set in a Baton Pass team, Cresselia should be paired with Mew, as the dual screen protection can help it set up and pass the boosts to a late-game sweeper. Lunar Dance also enables Mew to Baton Pass boosts twice, as Mew often loses a lot of HP during the first Baton Pass. However, bear in mind that Baton Pass is a lot more unreliable in today's metagame since Mew can only use one move in the last slot. If Mew uses Taunt, Dragon Tail totally ruins it; if Mew uses Substitute, Roar or Whirlwind will stop it cold; if Mew uses Dragon Tail, it is halted by Taunt and can no longer pass the boosts.</p> <p>A few Pokemon can switch in on Cresselia and prevent it from setting up dual screens. Choice Specs Kyogre and Reshiram 2HKO with Water Spout or Blue Flare respectively, even if Light Screen is up, though bulky Cresselia can usually survive two Blue Flares at full health. Lunar Dance sacrifices Cresselia to fully heal a teammate, which is important for Trick Room teams to maintain the momentum. After your team has been weakened mid-game, Cresselia can switch in, set up dual screens and Trick Room, and then sacrifice herself to help another powerful teammate, such as Groudon, successfully sweep.</p> <p>Light Clay prolongs the effects of the dual screens to eight turns. Ice Beam can be used if your team still needs an answer to Groudon or Rayquaza. However, Ice Beam won't deter most of Cresselia's counters, such as Heatran and Tyranitar, from switching in. This Cresselia set is extremely vulnerable to Taunt since it has no attacks. Pokemon with phazing moves can phaze Cresselia before it can set up Trick Room, so it is wise to set up dual screens first when facing a Pokemon likely to carry phazing moves such as Groudon. The given EVs grant Cresselia balanced bulk on both sides.</p> <p>The aforementioned counters can easily stop Cresselia, but it can turn the tables on them by setting up screens first, followed by Lunar Dance once its job is done. Any Calm Mind Arceus variant can also set up on and beat Cresselia one on one, especially Arceus-Ghost, Arceus-Dark, or Arceus-Bug. Choice Specs Kyogre can possibly 2HKO Cresselia even through Light Screen, so Cresselia best not be sticking around. Arceus-Grass, Palkia, and Zekrom can easily take down Kyogre for Cresselia thanks to their Water resistances and powerful Electric or Grass attacks. Groudon's massive Defense stat enables it to easily counter Tyranitar, also known as the bane of Cresselia. Heatran and Tyranitar can also be stopped by Kyogre due to the legendary whale's massive bulk, and the rain it brings serves to weaken Heatran further. This set can greatly aid powerful sweepers, such as Dialga and Kyogre, who enjoy dual screens and Lunar Dance support. After they have been weakened mid-game, Cresselia can step in and set up screens and Trick Room followed by Lunar Dance once her purpose has been fulfilled. This set works well in Trick Room teams as a suicide Pokemon to set up a game-breaking sweeper such as Rayquaza or Groudon.</p>"
      },
      "Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Cresselia's defenses are incredibly hard to break, so it is well suited to being either a physical or mixed wall. With the listed combination of moves, it can function as a decent counter to some of the top threats in the Ubers metagame, including Groudon, Rayquaza, Garchomp, Giratina-O, and Choice Scarf Palkia and Dialga. Cresselia is well-known as the best Groudon counter in the game, unless the Groudon carries Swords Dance and Shadow Claw for some odd reason.</p> <p>Moonlight heals 2/3 of Cresselia's HP under the sun, which is better than Lugia's Roost. However, it has only 8 PP, while the other reliable recovery moves have 16 PP. Moonlight allows Cresselia to stall out Groudon with ease, as it can survive even a +4 Stone Edge from most Groudon. Reflect bolsters Cresselia's huge Defense to even greater heights, allowing Cresselia to take hits from most physical attackers and making it a decent team player. With Reflect, Cresselia can check Swords Dance Groudon, Rayquaza, and Garchomp a lot easier. No physical attack can OHKO Cresselia when it is safely behind the screen. Toxic damages bulkier threats such as Groudon and Arceus, while Thunder Wave cripples speedy Pokemon like Darkrai and Mewtwo. Magic Coat allows Cresselia to bounce back status and entry hazards at the opponent; this is exceedingly useful since Cresselia tends to attract Spikes users such as Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Cresselia's lack of weaknesses to Ice-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves sets it apart from Lugia. Another advantage is that Cresselia can survive a Choice Band-boosted Bolt Strike from Zekrom; Lugia can still survive with a faster Reflect, but Cresselia can actually stall out Choice Scarf Zekrom, something Lugia cannot do. Terrakion is effectively walled by Cresselia as well. Do take note that Cresselia is outclassed by Lugia otherwise, as Lugia has higher Speed, a better support movepool, and overall better stats.</p> <p>Grass Knot can be used over Ice Beam since it hits Groudon harder and actually scratches Kyogre; however, Cresselia will lose its ability to counter physical Dragons such as Rayquaza and Garchomp. Hidden Power Fire can 2HKO Forretress outside of rain, but is essentially useless otherwise, since Ferrothorn takes laughable damage from the attack due to its good Special Defense. Cresselia's shabby offensive stats means that it can't go on the offensive route. A faster set can be used to outspeed slow base 90 Ubers like Groudon, but is not recommended since Cresselia really enjoys the extra bulk. Trick Room can be still used on this set if you need both a wall and someone to set it up.</p> <p>Kyogre counters Cresselia easily as it can come in and threaten to OHKO with Water Spout or set up with Calm Mind. Cresselia can barely touch Kyogre with Grass Knot due to Kyogre's massive Special Defense stat. Darkrai can pound Cresselia hard with a boosted Dark Pulse or incapacitate it with Dark Void, while Cresselia can only hope to paralyze Darkrai on the switch in. Tyranitar can 2HKO Cresselia with Crunch while taking negligible damage from Ice Beam thanks to the sandstorm Special Defense buff. Blissey, Chansey, and Heatran laugh at Cresselia while crippling it with Toxic, or Taunt in Heatran's case. Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress can freely set up on Cresselia unless Cresselia has Magic Coat. Heracross and Scizor can hurt Cresselia with their STAB super effective Bug moves. Heracross can even threaten to OHKO Cresselia with a Guts or Choice Band boost under its belt. Ho-Oh doesn't mind anything but Toxic, and can set up a Substitute on Cresselia for free while whittling away at its health with Sacred Fire or Brave Bird.</p> <p>Groudon provides eternal sunlight to make Moonlight more efficient, while countering Tyranitar, Heracross, Scizor, Blissey, and Chansey at the same time. Forretress resists Cresselia's weaknesses to Ghost- and Dark-type moves, and provides entry hazards to help Cresselia wear down the opponent faster. Giratina covers Cresselia's weaknesses to Heracross, Scizor, and Ho-Oh nicely.</p> <p>Groudon should always be partnered with Cresselia. The permanent sunlight really helps Cresselia when it's recovering with Moonlight. Forretress resists Ghost-, Dark-, Bug-, and Ice-type attacks and launches hazards onto the opponent's field--any form of entry hazard will help Cresselia weaken its counters. Cleric support is also great to help keep Cresselia free from Toxic; Blissey and Chansey are good choices as they can take most special attacks aimed at Cresselia. Most Dark-types can be taken down by Arceus-Fighting or Terrakion, while Groudon can take care of Blissey and Tyranitar. A RestTalk set is horrible for Cresselia in Ubers since it usually gives the opponent a free chance to set up, which can be game-deciding in Ubers. Cresselia can use Magic Coat, Psycho Shift, or Safeguard for status protection. Ferrothorn resists Cresselia's Dark and Ghost weaknesses while providing Spikes support and Leech Seed to weaken Cresselia's counters and checking Tyranitar.</p>"

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel was a bit on the fence last generation in regard to viability in the Uber tier. This generation has been kinder, granting it a few traits that make it quite useful and provide it with longevity. Rain Dish is a great boon, and it doubles Tentacruel's recovery per turn (assuming rain is up, of course). Tentacruel also boasts both Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin, two much sought-after moves in the Uber tier. The jellyfish also has quite good synergy with both Giratina-O and Ferrothorn, which can both help Tentacruel in various ways. Unfortunately, Tentacruel has rather poor physical bulk, and will fall easily to Earthquake and other physical attacks. Although 12.5% recovery per turn is nothing to laugh at, Tentacruel still lacks the staying power Pokemon such as Ferrothorn have against powerhouses, and the lack of significant recovery will usually catch up to it eventually. However, do not let these disadvantages deter you from thinking Tentacruel can be one annoying little jellyfish.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magic Coat is an interesting option to reflect moves such as Ferrothorn's Leech Seed and Darkrai's Dark Void, but it is a novelty at best. Liquid Ooze is also usable to annoy Ferrothorn, but its usefulness stops there, and Tentacruel will sorely miss Rain Dish. Confuse Ray can be used to annoy opponents, but it isn't very reliable. Icy Wind can slow down opponents, but Ice Beam is a far superior choice in almost every scenario, due to its higher Base Power. Giga Drain can be used to milk every last option of recovery Tentacruel has short of Rest, but it really isn't worth it and does rather poor damage. Finally, a Stallrein-esque set with Protect, Substitute, Toxic Spikes, and Scald in tandem with Rain Dish and Leftovers can be quite annoying, but, unfortunately, rain doesn't have the damaging quality that hail does, so it is a bit less effective. Still, it is not something to be taken lightly with Tentacruel's impressive Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Groudon is Tentacruel's #1 enemy. It takes away the rain Tentacruel loves so much and can OHKO Tentacruel with Earthquake, even with 0 Atk EVs, unless you invest significantly in Defense. Groudon can also incinerate Tentacruel's most commonly used partner, Ferrothorn, with Fire Punch. It does have to watch out for burns, though, and Toxic Spikes + repeated attacks will wear it down quickly. Tentacruel crumples to powerful attacks in general—it should be played as a tank, not a wall, lest you let its lack of a reliable recovery move catch up to it. Physical attackers in particular can easily wear Tentacruel down due to its poor Defense stat. From the special side, Palkia, Kyogre, and Dialga all receive special mention. Tentacruel really can't touch the former two no matter what attack it runs, although they must be careful of Toxic Spikes or they will quickly succumb to poison. Dialga, however, is immune to Toxic. All three of these Pokemon are commonly seen with Thunder, and although Tentacruel is not 2HKOed by a non-boosted Thunder, it certainly won't like taking one. Mewtwo can easily shatter Tentacruel with Psystrike, but once again Toxic Spikes and its usual Life Orb will wear it down quickly. Giratina-O can block Tentacruel's Rapid Spin and pose a threat with Thunder or Earthquake, although neither can ever OHKO a full HP Tentacruel, and the former can even fail to 3HKO (although that requires near-minimum damage rolls every time). Giratina-O also will not like Ice Beam very much. Manaphy can set up on Tentacruel with ease and ignore Toxic Spikes with Hydration. Almost any Arceus with Refresh and a boosting move can easily set up on Tentacruel. Arceus-Poison in particular can be a nuisance simply for the fact that you cannot see it on team preview and it can nullify the turns you spent setting up Toxic Spikes simply by switching in. Arceus-Ground can also OHKO Tentacruel, but it cannot switch in easily for fear of Scald and a burn. Ho-Oh can't be burned and isn't even 2HKOed by Scald in the rain, and can threaten Tentacruel with powerful physical attacks. Zekrom is another physical attacker which gives Tentacruel a run for its money with STAB Electric-type attacks, which can OHKO with ease, but Zekrom won't appreciate a burn so it must be careful. Finally, Giratina can annoy Tentacruel with Will-O-Wisp and Dragon Tail, and later Rest off the poison inflicted by Toxic Spikes.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>As previously mentioned, Tentacruel is one of the few viable users of Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin in the Uber tier. Do not make the mistake of thinking this Pokemon is inferior to Forretress; Tentacruel has several qualities that let it hold its ground against threats the bagworm might fall to. First off, Tentacruel has much greater special bulk, and, in comparison to Forretress's physical bulk, is more desirable in Ubers. Tentacruel also gained Scald this generation, which can burn any would-be physical threat and make it useless (unless the opponent packs a cleric). Scald also has respectable power in the rain after a STAB boost. Tentacruel was given Rain Dish in the generation shift as well, which, in tandem with Black Sludge, gives it 12.5% recovery per turn, which is nothing to scoff at. This jellyfish also has a surprising base 100 Speed, meaning it will often outspeed Pokemon such as Groudon and Dialga, which don't do much other than creep base 90 Speed Pokemon by a few EVs.</p> <p>The first two moves are obvious--Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin give Tentacruel its niche. Scald is a solid choice in the third slot, and can turn would-be counters into useless burned husks. However, if you wish, you can swap out Scald for one the of moves slashed in the fourth slot. The last slot is a bit trickier. Ice Beam allows you to put a respectable-sized dent in the Dragon-type Pokemon which run rampant in the Uber tier, and, more importantly, Giratina-O, though it can't do much to touch Tentacruel outside of the rare Earthquake, Outrage, or Thunder. The 32 Defense EVs prevent a max Attack Giratina-O with an Attack-boosting nature from OHKOing a full HP Tentacruel with Earthquake. Dragon Tail can annoy Tentacruel a bit, but it will quickly recover from minor hits through Rain Dish and Black Sludge. Protect is also a decent choice, allowing Tentacruel to maximize its Rain Dish and Black Sludge recovery; however, it can be risky. If you aren't careful, Protect can provide the opponent with free switches and turns to set up. Don't ignore this option though, since it can allow Tentacruel to accomplish impressive feats such as survive the 2HKO from unboosted Thunder off 150 SpA (it maxes at 61.5% with the given EV spread). Protect also causes the opponent to take a bit more damage from poison, burning a turn before you are forced to switch to a check.</p> <p>Ferrothorn is an outstanding teammate for Tentacruel, as it resists its most commonly abused weakness, Electric. In turn, Tentacruel resists both of Ferrothorn's weaknesses. This can be quite easy to exploit, and Tentacruel will often find free recovery from Ferrothorn's Leech Seed. Both Ferrothorn and Tentacruel also fit quite nicely on defensively minded teams; Tentacruel can provide Rapid Spin support and Toxic Spikes while Ferrothorn walls a great number of threats and can provide Spike support. Kyogre is also a great partner to the two aforementioned Pokemon, as Ferrothorn enjoys its Fire-type weakness lessened in severity, while Tentacruel needs Kyogre to fuel Rain Dish. Giratina-O is a great teammate for the jellyfish too. Giratina-O resists all of Tentacruel's weaknesses bar Psychic, which only Mewtwo is commonly seen using. Giratina-O also blocks Rapid Spin and, in addition, resists or is immune to Ferrothorn's weaknesses as well! Tentacruel also has the added bonus of being able to absorb Toxic Spikes upon switching in—an ability that is quite useful to defensive teams. It also may be wise to pack Pokemon like Lugia or Chansey to take the powerful attacks that Tentacruel simply can't manage.</p> <p>Knock Off is a viable option on Tentacruel to annoy offensive and defensive Pokemon alike. Pokemon which use Leftovers will hate to see it gone, and they will succumb to Toxic Spikes even faster. However, it may be more beneficial to allow Choiced Pokemon to keep their items, since this makes them quite easy to predict around. Tentacruel's impressive Speed can also allow it to act as a \"Suicide Toxic Spiker\". You can forgo the defensive approach and simply sacrifice Tentacruel to get a layer or two of Toxic Spikes and perhaps get a Rapid Spin in before Tentacruel goes down. You can also choose to invest a bit more in Defense, but Tentacruel's Defense stat is poor anyway, and it usually is a waste of its special walling potential. Haze deserves mention for its great utility, but it is illegal with Rapid Spin due to breeding restrictions. Finally, Venoshock deserves an honorable mention for reaching 195 BP and surpassing Scald in the rain if the opponent is poisoned, which is very possible considering you will be using Toxic Spikes. This, however, isn't a very reliable STAB and Steel-types are immune to it. You will often not be able to do much to Pokemon which are not affected by Toxic Spikes thanks to Levitate or a Flying sub-type as you can't poison them without outside help.</p>"

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Although mostly outclassed as a supporter by Ferrothorn and Forretress, Cloyster makes for a surprisingly deadly sweeper in Ubers. Its horrendous Special Defense makes it difficult to set up, but when it does get that Shell Smash off, there is very little that can stop it. Cloyster requires a lot of team support to work effectively, but it does have the potential to become a fearsome sweeper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used on the Shell Smash set to nail Ferrothorn, but should only be considered if Kyogre support can't be managed. Cloyster doesn't really have many options, because Shell Smash sweeping is the only thing it's good at. Cloyster can provide support with Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin, but Forretress outclasses it. Focus Sash or White Herb can be used to give Cloyster some longevity, but it desperately needs the power a Life Orb provides. A gimmicky Clamp set could be used to get up a lot of entry hazards, but it is extremely situational, as many Pokemon in the Ubers metagame threaten Cloyster.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>It should be kept in mind that Cloyster is incredibly frail on the special side, to the point where a -4 support Dialga will OHKO it with Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock. As such, pressuring Cloyster with special attackers will severely hamper its ability to get off a Shell Smash. In the event that Cloyster manages to set up, bulky Kyogre is perhaps the best counter to it, because it can take anything +2 Cloyster can throw at it and OHKO back with Scald. Similarly, 252/0 Manaphy can shrug off a +2 Rock Blast and KO back. In the rain, Kingdra can outspeed Cloyster and OHKO it with a special attack. A physically defensive Ferrothorn can just barely take a +2 Icicle Spear and OHKO back with Power Whip. Choice Scarf Darkrai and Shaymin-S can both easily revenge kill Cloyster, although the latter must be wary of Ice Shard. Darkrai also has the added benefit of not being overly troubled by Wobbuffet, who could otherwise trap and kill a Choice Scarf revenge killer.</p> <p>Priority helps deal with Cloyster very well, so Arceus and Rayquaza make very good checks when running Extreme Speed. Scizor is also capable of revenge killing Cloyster after Shell Smash, Stealth Rock, and a few turns of Life Orb recoil. Vacuum Wave users, such as Lucario and Toxicroak, do a fine job dealing with Cloyster as well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<p>Cloyster becomes incredibly difficult to wall after a Shell Smash, as it is capable of OHKOing many premier Ubers walls, such as Groudon, Lugia, and Giratina, thanks to its powerful Ice-type STAB. Icicle Spear is the crux of the set, because with Skill Link it effectively has a Base Power of 125. With rain support from Kyogre, a +2 Hydro Pump can KO many Steel-types who would normally wall Cloyster. Rock Blast obtains an immediate OHKO on Ho-Oh, and is Cloyster's strongest attack against opposing Kyogre.</p> <p>Life Orb is absolutely crucial due to the power it provides. A Naive nature with the given Speed EVs guarantees that Cloyster outspeeds Jolly Choice Scarf Terrakion after a Shell Smash. 32 SpA EVs guarantee that a +2 Hydro Pump in the rain will OHKO Arceus-Steel after one layer of Spikes. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Attack.</p> <p>The following damage calculations give an idea of the raw power Cloyster wields after a Shell Smash:</p> <ul> <li>+2 Icicle Spear vs. 252/252+ Groudon 121.5% - 143.5%</li> <li>+2 Icicle Spear vs. 252/252+ Giratina 109% - 131%</li> <li>+2 Icicle Spear vs. 4/0 Palkia 130.5% - 155.5%</li> <li>+2 Icicle Spear vs. 4/0 Dialga 105.5% - 125.5%</li> <li>+2 Icicle Spear vs. 252/4 Dialga 89% - 106.5%</li> <li>+2 Icicle Spear vs. 252/4 Ferrothorn 95% - 112%</li> <li>+2 Icicle Spear vs. 252/176+ Lugia 125% - 151.5%</li> <li>+2 Icicle Spear vs. 252/252+ Arceus 62% - 74.5%</li> <li>+0 Icicle Spear vs. 0/0 Giratina-O 97.5% - 118%</li> <li>+2 Hydro Pump in rain vs 248/0 Arceus-Steel 88% - 103.6%</li> <li>+2 Rock Blast vs. 4/0 Kyogre 90.5% - 108%</li> <li>+2 Rock Blast vs. 252/252+ Kyogre 54.5% - 64.5%</li> <li>+2 Rock Blast vs. 252/0 Manaphy 69.5% - 83%</li> <li>+0 Rock Blast vs. 248/0 Ho-Oh 149.5% - 178.5%</li> </ul> <p>Rapid Spin is an option over Rock Blast or Hydro Pump, allowing Cloyster to clear entry hazards if necessary. It helps that the best spinblocker in Ubers, Giratina-O, cannot switch safely into Cloyster. Another option is Ice Shard, which can be used to revenge kill a +1 Rayquaza or Shaymin-S. Razor Shell is an option over Hydro Pump, but it misses some noticeable KOs.</p> <p>Because Cloyster is so specially frail, it is almost mandatory to have either dual screen support or Wobbuffet as a teammate. A layer of Spikes is also crucial for some KOs. Deoxys-S can reliably provide both dual screens and a layer of Spikes. Arceus can provide both screens reliably, and can also burn physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, easing setup for Cloyster. Latios can set up screens and then further weaken the opponent with Memento, giving Cloyster a free switch in, and likely a safe opportunity to use Shell Smash. Ferrothorn and Forretress can both supply Spikes as well, with the latter being able to spin away Stealth Rock, which otherwise severely hampers Cloyster. Ferrothorn is also valuable for its ability to threaten and wear down bulky Water-types, especially Kingdra, which are some of the best answers to Cloyster. Rain support is also required for Hydro Pump to pick up some KOs, so Kyogre should be paired with Cloyster.</p>"

      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<p>Cloyster provides a reliable way to stave off entry hazards early-game for teams that desperately need their side of the field clear for several turns. It can effectively lead against hazard setters such as Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S and prevent them from laying their entry hazards on the field. Cloyster's ability to function in any weather (apart from possibly sand, which breaks its Focus Sash) makes it a versatile spinner that can fit onto many team archetypes that need a short-term solution to entry hazards. Cloyster can also set up its own entry hazards thanks to its respectable Speed and offensive presence. Unlike Forretress or Excadrill, Cloyster does not possess the typing or bulk to come into the match over and over again, so teams that need consistent spin support throughout the match should look elsewhere.</p> <p>Shell Smash is pivotal as it allows Cloyster to outrun Deoxys-S and other entry hazard setters, ensuring that their hazards will be spun away. It also gives Cloyster enough power to OHKO the Giratina formes, preventing them from spinblocking. Icicle Spear is a powerful STAB move that threatens Ground-types such as Groudon and Gliscor even before a boost, allowing Cloyster to lead against them. It can also beat Focus Sash Deoxys-A leads with one use of Icicle Spear, though it should not attempt to set up a Shell Smash on these as they often have Psycho Boost or Superpower, as well as Extreme Speed. The last slot is dedicated to an entry hazard, which can be used against foes that Cloyster cannot OHKO after a Shell Smash and doesn't need to worry about spinning against, such as bulky Kyogre. Cloyster will outspeed slower base 90s, which is helpful in allowing it to spin against these threats even without a boost or place at least two entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field. The choice between Spikes and Toxic Spikes is up to you. If setting up entry hazards does not appeal to you, you can go with another attacking move. Rock Blast OHKOes Ho-Oh while dealing heavy damage to Kyurem formes and opposing Cloyster. However, Rock Blast is very situational and your team will oftentimes miss the entry hazard support Cloyster can supply.</p> <p>Explosion is an intriguing option that can OHKO Kyogre after a Shell Smash boost. On offensive sun teams, winning the weather war is often worth losing Cloyster's support abilities, and Cloyster does tend to lure in Kyogre. However, there is significant opportunity cost; like Rock Blast, Explosion is very situational and generally entry hazard support will be more useful. Ice Shard picks off weakened Pokemon and allows Cloyster to beat all Shaymin-S one-on-one so long as Cloyster's Focus Sash is intact. Unfortunately, it has little use outside of that.</p> <p>An Adamant nature can be considered over Jolly for the extra power. There are some circumstances in which the extra power will prove beneficial. For example, +2 Jolly Cloyster only has a 6.25% chance to OHKO physically defensive Giratina after a Shell Smash. However, Adamant Cloyster OHKOes it 56.25% of the time, allowing it a much better chance to get a successful spin off whatever comes in after Giratina is gone. Also, Adamant Cloyster OHKOes all variants of Groudon at +2, whereas Jolly can only KO 252/252+ Groudon 62.5% of the time. However, Jolly is usually superior as it gives Cloyster the ability to outrun all threats up to Choice Scarf Terrakion after a Shell Smash, whereas Adamant Cloyster is outrun by base 95 Choice Scarf users and up, such as Kyurem-W. The ability to outrun Deoxys-S after using Shell Smash is a pivotal trait that Jolly Cloyster possesses over Adamant Cloyster.</p> <p>Physically defensive Arceus-Ghost with Stealth Rock is troublesome as it can burn Cloyster as it sets up a Shell Smash, set up Stealth Rock, and kill Cloyster with Judgment. Because of this, Darkrai makes a good teammate as it can put Support Arceus-Ghost to sleep without worrying about Judgment or Will-O-Wisp too much. Kyogre gives Cloyster a hard time as Cloyster cannot hit it that hard with any of its moves barring Explosion, so Kyogre checks such as Latias and Palkia pair up well with Cloyster. Lead support Dialga can survive a +2 Icicle Spear, so a teammate that can take it out in one hit, such as Earth Plate Groudon, is greatly appreciated. Finally, all status cripples Cloyster; Darkrai is particularly troublesome because it outruns Cloyster and puts it to sleep with Dark Void. Choice Scarf Sleep Talk users such as Dialga and Terrakion can come in on an expected Dark Void and absorb the sleep. As for other forms of status, Ho-Oh can switch in on Will-O-Wisps and Groudon and Arceus-Ground can come in on Thunder Waves.</p> <p>Good teammates for Cloyster include Pokemon that can take advantage of Cloyster's support sets. Dangerous sweepers such as Calm Mind and Swords Dance Arceus, Mewtwo, and Terrakion enjoy seeing Spikes on the opponent's side of the field, as they can wear down the opponent's team and allow Cloyster's teammates to clean up. Since Cloyster is too frail to consistently switch in on entry hazard setters throughout the match, teammates that can pressure these entry hazard setters are optimal. Palkia makes a great partner as it threatens Ferrothorn, Forretress, Gliscor, Groudon, and other common entry hazard setters. In return, Cloyster can prevent common entry hazard leads Palkia cannot stop, such as Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A, from setting up. Earth Plate Groudon can kill support Dialga (which beats Cloyster one-on-one) in one hit and sets up the sun that Cloyster generally functions best in.</p> <p>Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards appreciate Cloyster's ability to beat most spinblockers and pull off a successful spin. Ho-Oh is the first Pokemon that comes to mind, as it loathes losing half its HP to Stealth Rock every time it switches in. In return, Ho-Oh can kill Forretress that attempt to spin away Cloyster's own entry hazards. Kyurem-W, Rayquaza, and Reshiram also become far more threatening when their side of the field is clear of entry hazards.</p> <p>Because support Cloyster generally utilizes entry hazards, a spinblocker often pairs well with it. Substitute Giratina-O with Dragon Tail loves the Spikes that Cloyster provides and can use them to break down stall teams. Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost enjoys both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, as the latter can wear down pink blobs, increasing its chances of getting past them late-game. Cloyster also offers the ability to spin away Toxic Spikes that Arceus-Ghost hates. Giratina is susceptible to all three forms of entry hazards and thus appreciates Cloyster's ability to spin them away.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Chansey, the famous pink blob's little cousin, possesses amazing bulk which allows her to be a very effective support Pokemon in Ubers. When equipped with an Eviolite, she achieves incredible bulk with 642 HP, 163 Defense, and 508 Special Defense, assuming a Calm nature. Greater defenses allow Chansey to avoid being 2HKOed by a number of attacks that Blissey would succumb to, including Choice Specs Kyogre's Water Spout, Dialga and Palkia's Outrage, and Latios's Psyshock. However, holding Eviolite comes at the expense of no Leftovers recovery, so keep that in mind when choosing between Chansey and Blissey. Chansey does share Blissey's fantastic support movepool though, including Wish, which allows her to replenish a massive 321 HP for a teammate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If your team lacks a Pokemon with Stealth Rock, Chansey may use it over Seismic Toss in order to support the team even further. Protect is still usable over Soft-Boiled to secure Wish activation for Chansey herself. It can also be useful for scouting opponent's attacks, but its effectiveness is greatly hindered by the absence of Leftovers. Thunder Wave is an option for offensive teams to paralyze opposing Pokemon in preparation for a slower teammate to sweep. An EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD may be used if one wishes to pass more HP to teammates with Wish, or take physical hits better at the cost of less special bulk. Counter is another interesting option for Chansey; due to her higher physical bulk relative to Blissey, she can survive a number of physical hits from certain Pokemon and KO them with Counter. Using Counter requires a great deal of prediction, but makes it even more difficult for the opponent to take down Chansey. Light Screen is a useful move to support the team and ensures that pretty much no special attack will KO Chansey. Charm can be used in order weaken the opponent's physical attacks and allow Chansey to more effectively wall physical attacking Pokemon. Keep in mind that attack drops are removed by switching out so it is mainly effective only for phazing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Many physical sweepers such as Zekrom, Terrakion, Ho-Oh, physical variants of Arceus, and Rayquaza can counter Chansey reasonably well due to her lower Defense; however, even they have to fear being poisoned by Toxic and stalled out. Pokemon that can safely ignore poison and use stat boosting moves such as Swords Dance, Bulk Up, Calm Mind, and Nasty Plot can give Chansey a lot of problems. This includes Steel, Flying, and Poison types of Arceus, Kyogre, and Dialga. Ghost-types and Pokemon with 404 HP or more can use Substitute to set up fearlessly against Chansey, as they are not bothered by Seismic Toss or Toxic. Extreme Killer Arceus can simply set up on Chansey with Swords Dance, taking only relatively minor damage from Seismic Toss or Toxic. Mewtwo can easily 2HKO Chansey with Psystrike, a task accomplished with much ease when backed by Calm Mind boosts. Pokemon with Refresh, Aromatherapy, or Heal Bell and a Recovery move can also set up on Chansey at will. Refresh Arceus and Latias are notable examples.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Chansey's superb defenses thanks to Eviolite allow her to be an excellent wall, and a key player on any stall-inclined team. With her vast support movepool, she can pass enormous Wishes, cripple opponents, stall with Toxic, and remove status afflictions from the team with Heal Bell. Chansey can also remove any status dealt to herself by simply switching due to Natural Cure. This gives her incredible staying power and the ability to outstall opposing walls. Against such walls, she may then proceed to Toxic as the opponent is forced to switch, lest they face the slow spiral to death while beating futilely against Chansey's awesome bulk supported by Soft-Boiled. Note that even with Toxic Spikes support, Toxic is still a great move to deal with Flying-types and Levitate users such as Lugia and Giratina-O.</p> <p>The choice between Wish, Seismic Toss, and Heal Bell is dependent on how well Chansey's teammates can recover health and absorb status. Teams that are vulnerable to crippling statuses such as poison, paralysis, and burn appreciate Heal Bell, while teams that lack recovery moves benefit greatly from Wish. Snatch may also be used on Chansey as it allows her to take down mono-attacking Arceus (most notably Arceus-Dark) by stealing Refreshes and Recovers; if the Arceus is poisoned, Chansey can repeatedly abuse Snatch to prevent Arceus from removing its status or recovering its HP. This also allows her to steal Calm Mind boosts to further increase Chansey's Special Defense. Should a team be comfortable forgoing Wish's recovery or Heal Bell's status removing support, Seismic Toss should be used for its value in breaking down poisoned enemies that abuse recovery moves, most notably Lugia.</p> <p>In order to use Chansey effectively, you must always seize opportunities to switch into special sweepers that cannot significantly damage her. Entry hazard support greatly aids Chansey in stalling out sweepers; therefore, Spikers such as Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory make great partners for Chansey. Do not be afraid to switch Chansey in to certain weaker physical attacks, either. Due to awesome bulk with Eviolite, she can survive harsh beatings provided that there are few entry hazards. Chansey should be confident in switching into the likes of Palkia, Dialga, Kyogre, Reshiram, defensive Groudon, Latias, Latios, and mixed attacking Giratina-O, forcing them to switch out in fear of Toxic. Likewise, Chansey can stall out opposing walls such as Lugia with Toxic or force a switch.</p> <p>It should be noted that the inability to use Leftovers is a considerable loss when choosing Chansey over Blissey. While Chansey can take certain hits that Blissey cannot, Chansey is easily worn down by entry hazards and other forms of residual damage such as sandstorm, poison, and burn. It also takes away the opportunity to heal behind Protect. Additionally, Blissey can competently use special attacks such as Flamethrower and Ice Beam to take down certain threats, or even utilize them with Calm Mind, whereas Chansey's pathetic base 35 Special Attack is unusable.</p> <p>As for teammates, Lugia can easily take powerful hits from physical sweepers, use Reflect, and Whirlwind them away. Ho-Oh can address any Calm Mind abusers looking to set up on Chansey by hitting them with a powerful STAB Sacred Fire or Brave Bird. Giratina and Giratina-O are immune to any Fighting-type move thrown at Chansey, while she provides them with a Ghost immunity and the ability to sponge other powerful special attacks that they fear. Pokemon that lack recovery moves greatly appreciate Chansey's ability to pass Wish; examples range from sweepers such as Palkia and Zekrom to walls such as Groudon and Ferrothorn. Due to Chansey's massive HP, Wish recipients will recover 321 HP, often restoring them to full health.</p>"

  "Omastar": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to Omastar's extremely low base 55 Speed stat, one might wonder why it should be considered in Ubers when there are much faster Swift Swim sweepers available. However, Omastar's rain-boosted and Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump has more power than any other move available to another Swift Swim sweeper, as it can OHKO Arceus after Stealth Rock. In addition, Omastar's secondary Rock typing and excellent base 125 Defense stat allow it to check Extreme Killer Arceus and Life Orb Ho-Oh, two Pokemon that are extremely difficult to check offensively otherwise, effectively in rain. Although Omastar's low base Speed might be a deterrent at first, Omastar still reaches 418 Speed in the rain, which is enough for it to outrun the likes of Darkrai, Mewtwo, and Shaymin-S and OHKO them before they have a chance to strike. Omastar also gets Shell Smash, an excellent boosting move that it can use to end the game, given that it is able to set up and has hazard support. Unfortunately, Omastar does have its weak points. Unlike Kingdra and Kabutops, Omastar is outsped by almost all of the Choice Scarf users commonly seen in Ubers, making it relatively easy to revenge kill. Omastar also struggles to deal with rain stall teams unless it has significant hazard support, as it does not have a diverse movepool. Lastly, Omastar is almost completely useless if Kyogre's rain is removed by an enemy weather setter. Do not let these drawbacks deter you from discounting the fossil as a threat; Omastar's combination of power and Speed makes it a deadly threat that every team needs to prepare for.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Omastar's movepool is barren outside of the options already listed. Blizzard is usable on the Choice Specs set as it does a minimum of 76% to Latios, KOing it after it switches into Stealth Rock twice, and 2HKOes specially defensive Giratina. However, Blizzard's terrible accuracy means that Ice Beam is almost always a better option. If Omastar runs Shell Smash, a +2 Wring Out hits Palkia and Kyogre very hard if they are at or near full health. However, this is extremely situational and Omastar can break through most Kyogre and all Palkia with entry hazard support anyway. AncientPower can be used if you are feeling lucky, but Hidden Power Rock's higher Base Power makes it a more reliable option. Lastly, Stealth Rock can be used on the Life Orb set if you do not already have a Stealth Rock user.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Though Omastar hits hard, it is far from uncounterable. Specially defensive Kyogre can easily tank two Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pumps and OHKO Omastar with Scald. Gastrodon walls any set lacking Hidden Power Grass, but needs to be careful when switching in unless you are sure that Omastar does not carry the move. Ludicolo hard-counters all Omastar sets and threatens to OHKO it with a Grass-type STAB move. Palkia can take a +2 Life Orb Omastar's Ice Beam and possesses a 4x resistance to Water-type moves, but is hit hard by Hidden Power Rock and Choice Specs-boosted Ice Beam. Ferrothorn with Power Whip can take two Hydro Pumps and OHKO Omastar in return, but it must be at full strength when it switches in, as Hydro Pump hits it quite hard. The same applies to Abomasnow, which can act as a one-time check to Omastar, but can get worn down quickly by a combination of Omastar's attacks and Stealth Rock damage. Specially defensive Arceus-Water and Arceus-Grass can take on Omastar as well, but max HP Arceus formes will often fall to two consecutive Hydro Pumps after Stealth Rock even if they resist the attack. Chansey and Blissey can switch into Omastar as long as their side of the field is clear of hazards. Specially defensive Giratina is only 2HKOed by the rare Blizzard from the Choice Specs set, but cannot damage Omastar much in return. Kingdra and specially defensive Latias are also decent checks that can threaten to OHKO Omastar, but neither likes taking an Ice Beam. Two additional Pokemon can counter most Omastar sets, though both are very niche. Vaporeon can tank anything, even two consecutive Hidden Power Grasses, and hit Omastar hard with Scald. Jynx cannot handle the uncommon Hidden Power Rock but easily takes any of Omastar's other moves and can quickly recover health with Dry Skin.</p> <p>Checking Omastar offensively is significantly harder than checking it defensively, due to Omastar's naturally high Defense and resistance to ExtremeSpeed. Still, Choice Scarf users and Hasty Deoxys-A can revenge kill Omastar by preying on its low Special Defense stat. Do note, though, that Omastar Speed ties with neutral nature Choice Scarf base 90s. Choice Band Scizor can deal massive damage to Shell Smash Omastar due to the move's Defense dropping effect, as well as pick off a weakened one. Be aware that priority generally isn't enough to defeat Omastar, and you will need at least one dedicated check to prevent it from doing major damage to your team.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>This set allows Omastar to hit incredibly hard without suffering from Life Orb recoil. Although this Omastar cannot switch moves, it can check threats such as Ho-Oh, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Swords Dance Ghost Arceus extremely effectively in rain, as it can OHKO all three of them. Omastar can also accomplish feats such as 2HKOing max HP Arceus-Grass and Arceus-Water after Stealth Rock, and 2HKOing Blissey after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Hydro Pump is the main move Omastar will use early- to mid-game to ensure that it punishes Ho-Oh switch-ins and secures the OHKOs and 2HKOs that Surf cannot. To demonstrate Hydro Pump's power, the move 2HKOes 48 HP Latias after it switches into Stealth Rock twice. Ice Beam easily 2HKOes Latias, usually 2HKOes Palkia after Stealth Rock, and hits the Giratina formes hard. Surf is recommended on the same set despite its redundant coverage, as it allows Omastar to serve as a somewhat reliable win condition late-game, when the enemy's team has been weakened to the point that Hydro Pump is no longer needed. Surf is still strong enough to OHKO Darkrai and Mewtwo, though prior damage is needed for it to KO Arceus. The last move depends on personal preference. Earth Power smacks Dialga and Tentacruel for good damage and can OHKO offensive Dialga after Stealth Rock. However, Hidden Power Rock guarantees the 2HKO on Palkia after Stealth Rock and allows Omastar to check Ho-Oh in any weather, provided the phoenix does not carry Earthquake.</p> <p>As there are not many Pokemon with Speed stats between those of Mewtwo and Omastar in the rain, Omastar can often afford to run some HP EVs to take hits from Ho-Oh a little easier. However, do not run more than 40 HP EVs on Omastar, in order to ensure that it will outrun Adamant and Modest Deoxys-A in rain. Alternatively, one can choose to run more Speed on Omastar by utilizing a Timid nature, as doing so allows it to outrun uninvested base 90s even outside of rain. In the rain, Omastar will outspeed neutral-natured Choice Scarf Pokemon with base 90 Speed as well as Naive Deoxys-A. The loss of power is noticeable, though, as Timid Omastar cannot OHKO Arceus after Stealth Rock. Omastar's movepool is pretty barren, but Hidden Power Grass can be used in the fourth moveslot to destroy Gastrodon, which otherwise walls this set, and hit Kyogre and Arceus-Water reliably.</p> <p>Kyogre is required as a teammate in order to use Omastar in Ubers, as the rain it provides gives a boost to Omastar's Speed and Water-type moves. Though Kyogre and Omastar share checks such as Latias and Ferrothorn, they can easily power through them together. Calm Mind Ghost Arceus is a great teammate for Omastar, being able to spinblock the hazards Omastar needs to secure OHKOs and 2HKOs and set up on Choice Scarf Terrakion as it attempts to revenge kill the fossil with Close Combat. In return, Omastar can revenge kill Darkrai and switch into Ho-Oh, two of the best checks to Arceus-Ghost. Other bulky Calm Mind Arceus formes also appreciate Omastar's ability to beat opposing Arceus and Ho-Oh. Ferrothorn makes a good partner for Omastar as well, despite the fact that it is also weak to Rayquaza and Fighting-type moves. Ferrothorn can easily take on most Choice Scarf users that bother Omastar and proceed to set up Spikes. In return, Omastar destroys Ho-Oh and can easily absorb Fire-type attacks aimed at Ferrothorn. Landorus-T can switch in on Choice Scarf Zekrom and Choice Scarf Terrakion for Omastar. It can also serve as a nice switch-in to Groudon and Tyranitar due to its Ground / Flying typing, Intimidate, and ability to threaten them with a powerful Earthquake. Lastly, specially defensive Arceus-Grass can handle Kyogre and Kingdra, both of which Omastar struggles with.</p> <p>Though Choice Specs Omastar can fit on all rain teams, it functions especially well on rain stall teams alongside Ferrothorn and Tentacruel. This is because it can severely damage offensive sun teams that include Ho-Oh, which teams with Ferrothorn and Tentacruel usually struggle against. Whenever rain is up, Omastar can come in on Ho-Oh and Swords Dance Arceus formes and spam Hydro Pump, which is very likely to knock out an opposing Pokemon. Unlike with Kabutops, Groudon cannot come in on Omastar, or else it risks taking massive damage. Specially defensive Groudon is easily 2HKOed by Ice Beam and Hydro Pump, while offensive Groudon is cleanly OHKOed. If Groudon is sacrificed to stop Omastar's rampage, the opponent loses the weather war and your chances of winning increase dramatically so long Kyogre is still alive. Due to Omastar's lack of reliable recovery, it cannot come in on Life Orb Ho-Oh more than twice. As a result, physically defensive Giratina-O makes a good partner for Omastar on rain stall teams, as it can take two Brave Birds from Ho-Oh and has a useful immunity to Earthquake.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>This set eschews the extra power that Choice Specs brings in favor of the ability to switch moves and utilize either Shell Smash or entry hazards. Hydro Pump is Omastar's best move and deals heavy damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Hydro Pump no longer OHKOes bulky Extreme Killer Arceus after Stealth Rock, but it still does around 80% on average. Surf can be used over Hydro Pump for its consistency, but the decrease in power is noticeable. Ice Beam is needed to deal solid damage to Giratina, Arceus-Grass, and Latias. Earth Power 2HKOes Dialga and Tentacruel but hits little else, whereas Hidden Power Grass defeats Gastrodon.</p> <p>Omastar can run Shell Smash to double its Speed and Special Attack in one turn, making it extremely difficult to wall and impossible to revenge kill without priority. With Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, the only Pokemon that can take any of Omastar's common moves are specially defensive Arceus-Water, specially defensive Kyogre, Ludicolo, Abomasnow, Chansey, and Jynx. Depending on whether Omastar runs Earth Power or Hidden Power Grass, either Tentacruel or Gastrodon can stop it as well. It is sufficient to say that if Omastar is able to get off a Shell Smash, chances are that it will sweep. The trick is to find an opportunity for Omastar to set up, as Omastar's overall bulk is poor by Ubers standards. Forretress and Leftovers Ho-Oh are examples of Pokemon that Omastar can set up a Shell Smash on. Even with proper team support, Omastar will not always find an opportunity to use Shell Smash, but it can still check Pokemon like Ho-Oh. If Shell Smash is not appealing, Omastar can also utilize entry hazards, as it has access to all three. However, it should only run one type of entry hazard, as it will rarely be able to set more than one layer in a match. Hazards can punish switches nicely if the opponent still has a healthy Omastar check, such as Kyogre. If you already have a Spikes user, Toxic Spikes are preferred. If you don't, though, Spikes are often more helpful; it depends on your team's needs.</p> <p>On the Shell Smash set, Hydro Pump and Surf can be used together in lieu of an additional coverage move. Although running both moves adds to the list of Pokemon that can combat Omastar after a Shell Smash, Omastar becomes more consistent, as it can choose either the raw power of Hydro Pump or the accuracy of Surf. If you want Omastar to function as an all-out attacker, a set consisting of Hydro Pump, Surf, Ice Beam, and either Earth Power or a Hidden Power is ideal. Hidden Power Rock is another option, as it can 2HKO Palkia after Stealth Rock, but it does not provide much additional coverage.</p> <p>If Omastar runs Shell Smash, there are teammates available that can help it attain a boost. Dragon Dance Rayquaza can bait Choice Scarf Genesect's Ice Beam, which Omastar can easily set up a Shell Smash on. Mixed Dragon Dance Rayquaza can also break down walls that bother Omastar, such as Ferrothorn, while Omastar can switch into Swords Dance Arceus that try to set up on Rayquaza. Shaymin-S also baits Ice Beam from Choice Scarf Pokemon, as it threatens to flinch teams to death if it is not revenge killed. Bear in mind that Ice Beam is not the only Choice-locked move Omastar can set up on. If the opponent lacks priority moves, Omastar can take an attack such as a Stone Edge from Terrakion or an Outrage from any Choice Scarf-wielding Dragon-type in the tier and proceed to set up. Omastar can set up with ease on any Choice-locked Fire-type moves, although it is unlikely that your opponent will be using them in the rain. Wobbuffet can work well as a partner, as if it Encores the opponent into the right move, Omastar can get a free setup opportunity.</p> <p>Regardless of whether or not Omastar runs Shell Smash, the same teammates that apply to the Choice Specs set also apply here. Ferrothorn and Omastar only share a weakness to Fighting-type moves and can take care of each other's checks. Bulky Calm Mind Arceus formes such as Arceus-Fighting and Arceus-Grass appreciate Omastar's ability to handle Ho-Oh. In return, they can deal with most of the Choice Scarf users that attempt to revenge kill the shellfish. Timid Life Orb Dialga is an intriguing teammate, as it can deal with the weather setters that Omastar is weak to, and resists Electric- and Grass-type moves. A Ghost-type such as Arceus-Ghost or Giratina can provide a reliable switch-in to Choice Scarf Terrakion.</p>"

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>Although at first glance Kabutops seems completely out of place in Ubers, it has numerous traits that make it worth using, including the incredible Swift Swim ability, a handy resistance to Extreme Speed, access to Rapid Spin, and an Attack stat that just barely works for it. It is heavily dependent on Kyogre, but needing to be paired with the king of Ubers is never really a bad thing. Although Kabutops can struggle against physical walls, it can easily tear apart an offensive team if given the chance and is definitely worth consideration on any offensive team using Kyogre.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hone Claws can be used over Swords Dance in order to boost Stone Edge's accuracy, but generally Kabutops prefers the offensive power. Toxic can be used to cripple walls who Kabutops might otherwise not be able to break through. Knock Off can be used to remove the opponent's items, making it more difficult for walls to stall or for offensive Pokemon to sweep. Substitute can be used alongside Swords Dance in order to block status and attacks, but Kabutops does not have the defenses to make much use of this. Smack Down can be used to remove an opponent's immunity to Ground-type moves, although Kabutops doesn't benefit from this itself. Kabutops also has access to a wide array of special moves, but its abysmal Base 65 Special Attack remove these from consideration. Dig can be used to kill Toxicroak, although Toxicroak's low usage and the uselessness of the move make using it hard to justify.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Groudon is without a doubt the best counter to Kabutops. Even +2 Life Orb Kabutops can fail to 2HKO 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Groudon with Waterfall in the sun, while Groudon can comfortably OHKO back with Earthquake. Even if Groudon is no longer in good enough health to take on Kabutops it still robs it of its Speed, allowing it to be easily revenge killed. Rayquaza checks Kabutops well, as Swift Swim is rendered useless due to Air Lock. However, caution must be exercised when switching in as Stone Edge easily OHKOes Rayquaza. Arceus-Grass can take Stone Edge from Kabutops and OHKO back with Judgment, but it must be wary of X-Scissor. Toxicroak and Gastrodon fear nothing from Kabutops and can easily OHKO back with their Fighting- and Ground-type STABs, respectively. Ferrothorn takes little damage from Kabutops's STAB moves and threatens to OHKO with Power Whip, although it must be wary of Low Kick. Giratina can burn Kabutops with Will-O-Wisp after tanking a hit and then phaze it out with Dragon Tail, rendering it useless for the rest of the match. Choice Scarf Terrakion outspeeds Adamant Kabutops in the rain and can OHKO it with Close Combat. If Jolly Kabutops is a concern Timid Choice Scarf Darkrai and Timid Choice Scarf Shaymin both outspeed it in the rain and can OHKO it with Focus Blast and Seed Flare, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Cleaner": {
        "description": "<p>Life Orb is the preferred item due to the drastic increase of power it provides, although Lum Berry is also an option in order to evade status and avoid taking recoil damage from Life Orb. Waterfall is Kabutops's main STAB move, as the boost from rain makes it effectively a 120 Base Power move. Stone Edge also provides excellent coverage, and can shred Lugia, a Pokemon most physical attackers generally have a hard time taking on. Low Kick rounds out the coverage by smashing apart Dialga and Ferrothorn, two common Pokemon that resist its STABs. Rapid Spin is an excellent move to place in the fourth slot to remove the omnipresent Spikes and Stealth Rock, which can pave the way for a late-game sweep by a teammate. Due to the strength of its attacks, Kabutops can severely damage Giratina-O and Arceus-Ghost, paving a pathway for Rapid Spin. Keep in mind that Kabutops is quite frail, however, and will likely be knocked out if the opponent stays in, so use with extreme care. Aqua Jet can be used to OHKO Choice Scarf Terrakion and +2 Blaziken in the rain, both of which can otherwise outspeed Kabutops and KO it in return. Kabutops can take advantage of the switches it is capable of forcing in order to nab a turn to use Swords Dance, allowing it to tear into the opponent's team. However, finding the time to set up can be pretty tricky, and Kabutops can still be phazed by extremely bulky physical walls, such as Giratina, even at +2 and will still be revenge killed by the same threats it normally would be even with the extra Attack.</p> <p>Since Kabutops outspeeds nearly every commonly used threat in Ubers in the rain, an Adamant nature is preferred in order to deal more damage. However, a Jolly nature is also an option in order to outspeed Choice Scarf Terrakion while it is raining. However, it should be noted that Timid Choice Scarf Shaymin-S and Timid Choice Scarf Darkrai both still outspeed Kabutops in the rain. A simple 252 Atk / 252 Spe spread is used in order to make Kabutops as threatening as possible, with 4 EVs in Defense in order to take physical priority moves slightly better. X-Scissor is an option on this set as it allows Kabutops to reliably kill Arceus-Grass in the rain at +2, without having to rely on Stone Edge's shaky accuracy. Aqua Jet is also an option for revenge killing Blaziken. Rock Slide is an option over Stone Edge for its accuracy and chance for a flinch, but the power loss is noticeable. Conversely, Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall for more power at the cost of accuracy.</p> <p>It cannot be stressed enough that Kyogre should be paired with Kabutops. Kabutops is useless without rain support, but with it Kabutops is a monster. As both Pokemon share weaknesses to Grass- and Electric-type moves it is recommended that a Pokemon that can resist both types be partnered with them. Ferrothorn loves having its Fire-type weakness removed in the rain and can set up entry hazards for its team while sponging Grass- and Electric-type attacks thrown at Kyogre and Kabutops. Rayquaza nullifies Swift Swim with its Air Lock ability, so a teammate that can handle it is appreciated. Both Gyro Ball Ferrothorn and Choice Scarf Palkia can take out a Rayquaza that has locked itself into Outrage. Ferrothorn can also paralyze Rayquaza with Thunder Wave, allowing Kabutops to kill it before it can move. Bronzong can also take on mixed Rayquaza with the aid of prediction, allowing it to set up dual screens for the team, which also makes it easier for Kabutops to get off a Swords Dance. If Low Kick is not being used Magnezone can trap and kill Ferrothorn while also benefiting from access to perfect-accuracy Thunder. Wobbuffet, thanks to Shadow Tag, can also give Kabutops opportunities to set up thanks to Encore combined with Tickle or Safeguard, depending on the situation. Wobbuffet can also remove faster Choice Scarf Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Kabutops can also run a Choice Band set successfully, as it can 2HKO at worst a large portion of the Ubers metagame. Waterfall is Kabutops's strongest move in rain, with the exception of Aqua Tail if accuracy is not a concern. Stone Edge has excellent coverage and is Kabutops's strongest move when it isn't raining. Low Kick allows a 2HKO on Ferrothorn, who is otherwise a serious threat. X-Scissor is a reliable 2HKO on Arceus-Grass, preventing it from switching in safely. Aqua Jet can be used instead in order to revenge kill Blaziken and Choice Scarf Terrakion.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is far more important here than it is for the Swords Dance set, as Kabutops sorely needs the power it provides, although Jolly is still an option in order to get the jump on Choice Scarf Terrakion. Attack and Speed are maximized in order to make Kabutops as threatening as possible. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense in order to take physical priority moves slightly more effectively. Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall for more power at the cost of accuracy and the chance of a flinch. The reverse is true when deciding whether to use Rock Slide over Stone Edge, which trades power for 90% accuracy and a 30% flinch rate. However, using Rock Slide is not recommended as it misses the 2HKO on Giratina-O that Stone Edge provides. Rapid Spin is an option in order to remove entry hazards, especially since the most common spinblockers, Giratina-O and Arceus-Ghost, are both 2HKOed by one of Kabutops's STAB moves. However, being locked into a Base 20 Power move can be fatal in Ubers, as many threats can turn the game on a dime if they get the chance to set up, so Rapid Spin should be used with care. Brick Break can be used over Low Kick in order to smash dual screens, but it misses out on the 2HKO on Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Once again, Kyogre support is mandatory with this set. Choice Specs Kyogre makes an excellent teammate as 4 HP Palkia cannot survive a Choice Band Stone Edge after switching in to a Choice Specs Water Spout in the rain. Entry hazard support is even more important to this set. Ferrothorn is an excellent supplier of Spikes and also resists the shared weaknesses of Kyogre and Kabutops. However, both share a weakness to Fighting-type moves, so a teammate that can take those is recommended. Arceus-Ghost carries a useful immunity to both Fighting- and Normal-type moves, allowing it to check Fighting-types while also blocking Rapid Spin, preventing Ferrothorn's layers of Spikes from going to waste. Giratina-O also does this job well, and in addition carries resistances to Grass- and Electric-type moves. Choice Scarf Palkia can revenge kill Rayquaza, who otherwise can outspeed and OHKO Kabutops with Earthquake or a strong Dragon-type move, thanks to Air Lock nullifying Swift Swim.</p>"

  "Mewtwo": {
    "overview": "<p>The classic God of Pokemon has always been one of the most fearsome combatants of Ubers, but BW has given Mewtwo a gift so great that even Arceus is jealous: Psystrike. This move strikes fear into old nemeses Blissey, Ho-Oh, and Kyogre, as it makes Mewtwo a fearsome mixed attacker with almost none of the previous downsides! Like many other Uber Pokemon, Mewtwo has the stats and movepool to do virtually anything it wants. With viable sets that range from a fearsome sweeper to a frustrating staller, its versatility ensures that there is absolutely nothing that can counter it. However, while it is by no means frail, Mewtwo is not the bulkiest Pokemon around, and with its susceptibility to entry hazards and priority attacks, its longevity is an issue in the hard hitting Uber metagame. Like other Pokemon with huge movepools, it is a pity that Mewtwo can only use four of them at the same time. These problems highlight its greatest flaw of all: Mewtwo is unable to run everything at once. You have to choose between bulk and power, and Mewtwo's typing is rather poor defensively. BW2 also introduced Genesect, which made Mewtwo a lot easier to check for offensive teams. It is otherwise perfect, as its flaws end here. Dr. Fuji's dream was to create the world's most powerful Pokemon, and he most definitely succeeded.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Physical sets with Bulk Up can be used to surprise certain checks such as Tyranitar. Bulk Up also helps to reduce damage from potential revenge killers such as Arceus with Extreme Speed and Giratina-O with Shadow Sneak. However, physical Mewtwo is easily walled by Giratina, Lugia, Groudon, and even Ho-Oh depending on the coverage moves Mewtwo has. It is also very weak unboosted.</p> <p>Mewtwo does have a massive movepool, but is generally most effective sticking to the sets listed. Dual Screens + Self-Destruct + Taunt can be used on offensive or Baton Pass teams, but sacrificing Mewtwo for this usually not worth it. Choice Specs is rather mediocre because Mewtwo prefers the ability to switch moves, but the extra power gained from Choice Specs can surprise opponents. Defense boosting moves such as Barrier can be used on the StallTwo set, but pure defensive roles are better left to bulkier walls such as Lugia and Giratina.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mewtwo does not have any failsafe counters. Ever. It has such amazing power and coverage that there is no such thing as a safe switch-in, and its checks depend purely on what move and set it is using. Choice Scarf Genesect is probably the best check, as it can easily OHKO Mewtwo with a +1 U-turn or Bug Buzz. However, one wrong switch into Fire Blast will end it, and even Psystrike or Aura Sphere will punch a huge hole into Genesect, which means it can only come in safely after one of its teammates has fallen. Since Mewtwo lacks any true counters, revenge killers are often used. Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Zekrom, Ho-Oh, Kyogre and Reshiram are the more prominent ones. Be wary of going straight to revenge killers though, as few things outright KO full HP Mewtwo, so hazards and racking up Life Orb recoil via prediction are often useful before the revenge killer comes in. Toxic Spikes, sandstorm damage, and the fact that Mewtwo commonly carries Life Orb can help wear it down quickly. Giratina-O can make a dent in Mewtwo with Shadow Sneak. Arceus-Ghost can take a hit and deal major damage with Judgment. Physical Arceus-Ghost can bypass any boosts Mewtwo might have obtained with Shadow Claw, but will fail against StallTwo. Victini resists all of Mewtwo's commonly used moves and can OHKO with V-create in the sun. However, despite its resistance, Mewtwo can still 2HKO it after Stealth Rock, so it has to be careful switching into too many Psystrikes or the rare Shadow Ball. While normally rare in Ubers, Bisharp can revenge kill Mewtwo with Sucker Punch, but requires good prediction as Mewtwo can easily play mind games with Calm Mind and Substitute. Lastly, Choice Scarf Heracross can OHKO any Mewtwo set with Megahorn and has Guts to ignore StallTwo's Will-O-Wisp. One also must be careful because checks to offensive Mewtwo often fall flat against a support variant or even a more defensively oriented attacking set.</p> <p>Defensive Arceus-Dark with Payback is a bit gimmicky, but is one of the closest things to a \"counter\" to offensive Mewtwo out there; however, it will lose to StallTwo. In a similar vein, Arceus-Psychic walls the Psycho Killer if Mewtwo lacks Fire Blast, or if the sun isn't shining, and can 2HKO Mewtwo with Payback and Extreme Speed. Jirachi can check offensive variants in the rain or even neutral weather if they lack Fire Blast, as +1 Aura Sphere fails to 2HKO. Jirachi can cripple Mewtwo with poison or paralysis, effectively neutering it. Metagross or Bronzong can be used for a more offensive check in the rain as long as Mewtwo lacks Fire Blast. Lugia and Giratina can attempt to check Mewtwo by forcing it out with Dragon Tail, but will fail to do anything significant to StallTwo. As for StallTwo, powerful special attackers such as Kyogre and Reshiram are good choices to take it out. Ho-Oh and Reshiram are immune to StallTwo's Will-O-Wisp, but cannot take multiple Psystrikes.</p> <p>If Mewtwo lacks Aura Sphere, Dialga, Heatran, and Tyranitar can all act as effective checks. Tyranitar can safely KO Mewtwo with a super effective Crunch or Pursuit it if it tries to switch out. Wobbuffet can very effectively check non-Taunt variants, as even +1 Shadow Ball will never OHKO 28/252+ Wobbuffet after Stealth Rock. +1 Fire Blast in the sun, however, has a decent chance (a little over 50%) to OHKO Wobbuffet after Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Psycho Killer": {
        "description": "<p>If there is one set in the game that embodies the word \"uncounterable\", this is probably it. Mewtwo's blazing base 130 Speed and sky-high base 154 Special Attack make it a terrifying sweeper and end-game cleaner. Psystrike allows Mewtwo to take out all sorts of special walls, namely Blissey, Chansey, Ho-Oh, and Kyogre, without needing to waste EVs in Attack, by striking (pun unintended) their weaker Defense. Between Aura Sphere, Ice Beam, and Fire Blast, Mewtwo hits everything that resists Psystrike. Aura Sphere destroys the likes of Tyranitar and Darkrai, while doing a lot of damage to Dialga. Ice Beam brings down Lugia and Giratina, especially physically defensive variants. Fire Blast fries Genesect, Scizor, and Ferrothorn, and is Mewtwo's most powerful option in the sun, OHKOing bulky threats such as Jirachi and Arceus-Steel, as well as Lugia, after Stealth Rock damage. Calm Mind pushes Mewtwo's Special Attack to even higher levels, allowing it to take down walls effectively. It also makes Mewtwo surprisingly resilient on the special side, letting it take attacks such as Draco Meteor from Choice Scarf Palkia. Without Calm Mind, Pokemon such as Lugia, Giratina, and 252/0 Arceus avoid being 2HKOed by its attacks.</p> <p>As for move selection, Psystrike along with three coverage moves is a fine choice. Four attacks Mewtwo is preferable, since setup opportunities are usually quite limited for it. Calm Mind, however, makes Mewtwo much harder to wall. The best moveset for Calm Mind Mewtwo is Calm Mind, Psystrike, Aura Sphere, and Ice Beam, which retains excellent coverage while hitting Lugia and Giratina, the two bulkiest walls in the tier, for super effective damage. If you can give Mewtwo sun support, Fire Blast should replace Ice Beam due to its power and coverage, especially against Genesect. The only Pokemon that stands a chance of walling Calm Mind Mewtwo in the sun is physically defensive Giratina, who can phaze Mewtwo out with Dragon Tail, but even it risks getting 2HKOed by Psystrike. While Fire Blast Mewtwo is the most potent variant, rain's popularity makes Fire Blast less attractive for teams that don't have sun support.</p> <p>The moves listed above gives Mewtwo best all-around coverage, but they can be replaced if other moves better fit your team. Recover allows Mewtwo to mitigate some of the heavy residual damage that it tends to take. Grass Knot hits Groudon and Kyogre for super effective damage, in particular OHKOing all Groudon, which Ice Beam can fail to do. Thunder hits Lugia and Kyogre super effectively while hitting most Steel-types hard. Shadow Ball is Mewtwo's strongest attack against Wobbuffet, Lugia, and Arceus-Ghost in the rain, while Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast if you value accuracy. Blizzard is an inaccurate move, but it does allow Mewtwo to 2HKO Specially Defensive Giratina without a boost after Stealth Rock damage, if you hit. Charge Beam allows Mewtwo to quickly finish off a weakened Pokemon and potentially get a Special Attack boost. Taunt can prevent walls from recovering health and can be used in place of Calm Mind.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Mewtwo's Speed and Special Attack. 4 Defense EVs are used so Genesect gets a Special Attack boost instead of an Attack boost to minimize U-turn damage. Life Orb is preferred to make Mewtwo as powerful as possible, but other items let Mewtwo set up more Calm Minds. If you are turned off by the recoil, Leftovers can lengthen Mewtwo's lifespan, but the power drop is very significant, losing out on 2HKOs against Giratina, 252/0 Arceus, and Lugia at +1. Like Leftovers, Lum Berry lessens Mewtwo's power, but can allow Mewtwo to set up on status-inflicting Pokemon such as Thunder Wave Ferrothorn. Expert Belt gives Mewtwo conditional power while conserving its Mewtwo's health. Even though it does not boost Psystrike most of the time, Mewtwo's coverage is enough to hit most targets for super effective damage. On the other hand, Mind Plate boosts only Psystrike and not Mewtwo's coverage moves. With Mind Plate, Psystrike is still powerful enough to 2HKO specially defensive Giratina and Latias, and OHKO 252/0 Kyogre after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The only things that keep Mewtwo in check are Choice Scarf users, priority attacks, residual damage, and its inability to cover all threats with four moves. If Mewtwo lacks Fire Blast, Scizor can checkmate it with Pursuit and U-turn, while Jirachi can take anything it dishes out and paralyze it with Body Slam. Metagross can also do lots of damage in return, while not taking much from Aura Sphere. If Mewtwo lacks Aura Sphere, Tyranitar destroys it with no trouble at all, while Dialga, Arceus-Dark, and Darkrai can be troublesome outside of sunny weather. If Mewtwo forgoes Ice Beam, then Lugia counters Mewtwo without sun, while Giratina becomes a big problem. If Calm Mind is omitted, Mewtwo has a hard time against defensive teams in general, especially those with Latias, Lugia, or Giratina in them.</p> <p>Most Ubers teams plan to take down Mewtwo via a Choice Scarf user, as few Pokemon can actually wall it. It should be noted that not many Choice Scarf users can actually OHKO a healthy Mewtwo, but Life Orb recoil and entry hazards can put it in KO range. Most Choice Scarf users require at least one round of Life Orb recoil in addition to Stealth Rock damage to OHKO Mewtwo. The exceptions to this are Kyogre (with full HP Water Spout), Modest Reshiram in the sun, Adamant Kyurem-B and Zekrom, Heracross, Victini, and finally Genesect. Genesect in particular is problematic for Mewtwo, since it can deal massive damage to Mewtwo with U-turn, and avoid being locked into an attack that might be advantageous for another sweeper to set up on. Genesect is a nightmare to try and pin down, but some ways to make life difficult for it is to heavily stack on entry hazards, and try to hit it hard on the switch (Psystrike does a lot of damage, while Fire attacks OHKO it). Wobbuffet can remove most Choice Scarf users, with the exception of those just mentioned. Luring out Choice Scarf users with Thunder Wave Kyogre or other Thunder Wave users is a good strategy. Kyogre tends to lure in Choice Scarf Palkia and Zekrom, as well as Latias. If you do have sun support, though, removing Choice Scarf Kyogre is not too difficult with Wobbuffet, as you can sacrifice Groudon to Kyogre to bring in the sun, then use Wobbuffet to trap and remove Kyogre, keeping the rest of the match sunny. Sacrificing Hippowdon or Tyranitar when using a sand team has a similar effect. Reshiram is difficult to deal with if you are using a sun team, but is easy for rain and sand teams to take on. Victini can be trapped and KOed by Tyranitar or other Pursuit users that are not weak to its attacks. Heracross is walled by many Pokemon, such as the Giratina formes and Groudon. Lastly, as previously mentioned, Thunder Wave Kyogre tends to lure in Choice Scarf Palkia and Zekrom, as well as Latias, a wall that gives Mewtwo trouble.</p> <p>Residual damage has been mentioned, but it should be stressed that Life Orb and entry hazard damage allow priority attacks and Choice Scarf users to pick Mewtwo off. Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce users will mitigate entry hazard damage. For offensive teams that tend to carry Mewtwo, Custap Berry Forretress, Kabutops, and Excadrill are all good offensive Rapid Spin users, while Xatu and Espeon provide Magic Bounce for the team. Wish support from Blissey or Jirachi can help Mewtwo, but is not always necessary.</p> <p>In terms of offensive pressure and synergy, sometimes it is best to just stack sweepers with good offensive synergy with Mewtwo. Rock Polish Groudon and Landorus-T can set up on Choice Scarf Zekrom; Scizor, Arceus-Steel, and Bisharp can set up on Choice-locked Dragon-type attacks. Latias can set up on Choice Scarf Kyogre, as can Water-resistant Arceus formes. ExtremeKiller Arceus can set up on most Choice Scarf users besides Choice Scarf Terrakion, which cannot defeat Mewtwo. Dual Screen support also benefits Mewtwo, since they prevent most revenge killers from easily KOing Mewtwo. While Wobbuffet does not have particularly good synergy with Mewtwo, it can still Encore setup moves such as Calm Mind, giving Mewtwo a free setup opportunity.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Booster": {
        "description": "<p>This set maximizes Mewtwo's bulk, allowing it to set up Calm Mind with greater ease but sacrificing Mewtwo's immediate destructive power for greater longevity. With Calm Mind and Recover, Mewtwo can slowly boost in front of special attackers. This set is particularly useful on sand teams and teams that are more susceptible to Fighting-types such as Arceus-Fighting. Normally, entry hazard damage and sandstorm recoil can easily whittle Mewtwo down, but this set allows Mewtwo to stick around for longer to counter threats such as Arceus-Fighting. Be aware, though, that this Mewtwo set has significant coverage issues. Psystrike is Mewtwo's STAB attack, and helps it win Calm Mind wars. Flamethrower allows Mewtwo to hit most Steel-types for super-effective damage, in particular OHKOing Genesect. This is especially important because with a bulky spread, Mewtwo can survive both U-turn and Bug Buzz from Choice Scarf Genesect. Flamethrower also allows Mewtwo to hit most Steel-types for super effective damage. Aura Sphere hits Tyranitar, Dialga, and Darkrai for super effective damage. Ice Beam might not appear to add significant coverage, but it does hit Lugia and Giratina for super effective damage, and being able to quickly OHKO Rayquaza is always nice as well.</p> <p>The EV spread used maximizes Mewtwo's bulk and Speed. While the 4 Defense EVs might not look like much, they prevent Genesect from getting an Attack boost. Given the nature of the set and potential use on sand teams, Leftovers is far and away the best item to use. This set exacerbates Mewtwo's already severe four-moveslot syndrome. Fire Blast can replace Flamethrower to hit Excadrill harder in the rain, as well as for more power in general. Taunt and Substitute can prevent status and phazing attempts. However, keep in mind that if Recover is dropped for one of these moves, Mewtwo will have a lot less staying power, which goes against the point of this set. As for move options, Thunder can be used to hit Kyogre harder while still hitting Lugia super effectively. Grass Knot can be used to take down Groudon easily, while Shadow Ball is Mewtwo's most powerful attack against Wobbuffet.</p> <p>This set in particular has many counters no matter what move Mewtwo runs. Without Flamethrower, it will be walled by Steel-types. Even with Flamethrower, Genesect is a major thorn in Mewtwo's side. Scizor will also make life hell for Mewtwo that lack Flamethrower by checkmating it with Pursuit and U-turn, while Skarmory can take Aura Spheres and Ice Beams and force Mewtwo out with Whirlwind. If Mewtwo lacks Aura Sphere, Tyranitar walls Mewtwo and checkmates it with Pursuit, while Dialga can take attacks from it and either Roar it out or poison it with Toxic. In general, Lugia and Giratina wall Mewtwo, although they will not enjoy taking boosted Ice Beams for too long. Genesect is very difficult to pin down and take out, but entry hazards will limit Genesect's ability to continually U-turn in and out. If you can lock it into an attack that is not U-turn or Bug Buzz, Wobbuffet can trap and KO it. While Pursuit is inescapable, Pokemon such as Arceus-Fighting, Groudon, Landorus, and Gliscor can all set up on Tyranitar easily. Arceus-Fighting is also good for taking down Dialga. Finally, Lugia and Giratina are setup bait for entry hazard users, such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress.</p>"
      },
      "Support (StallTwo)": {
        "description": "<p>Defensive Mewtwo seems rather weird, but it is surprisingly effective. It is especially useful against opposing stall teams thanks to Mewtwo's great Speed and support movepool, traits that let it stall out a wide variety of threats. Taunt forces defensive Pokemon to hit it with weak attacks instead of healing or using support moves, allowing Mewtwo to easily stall them out. Recover in conjunction with Mewtwo's Speed allows it to heal before most things can even touch it, making it extremely hard to break. Furthermore, when combined with Pressure, Recover can easily sap up all of the opponent's PP. This is handy in a tier filled with 8 PP moves such as Spacial Rend and Draco Meteor. Once again, four-moveslot syndrome kicks in for Mewtwo. Will-O-Wisp allows Mewtwo to stall out physical attackers quite effectively, letting it repeatedly heal while they slowly die to burn damage, and easily cripples many initial switch-ins to Mewtwo, such as Genesect and Tyranitar. Toxic does more damage in the long run, and hits Fire-types outside of Heatran, with the downside of leaving Mewtwo helpless against Steel-types and without a way to cushion the blows of physical powerhouses such as Zekrom and Groudon. As such, Will-O-Wisp is usually the better option because Mewtwo's defenses, while not especially low, are not amazing either.</p> <p>Psystrike is Mewtwo's only option to hit Ho-Oh and Reshiram if you are running Will-O-Wisp. It also lets Mewtwo prevent powerful attackers such as Kyogre and Kyurem-W from switching in for free. Light Screen lets Mewtwo sponge all but the most powerful of special attacks, and makes Mewtwo hard to crack when used with Will-O-Wisp. Substitute is useful for scouting a switch in and preventing status. It also lets Mewtwo Pressure stall more effectively. As a bonus, Mewtwo's Substitute is strong enough to survive most Dragon Tails, while Roar and Whirlwind are blocked by Taunt. Without Substitute, stall teams can still Dragon Tail Mewtwo out, which can get annoying when combined with entry hazards. There is very little reason to run any item other than Leftovers. While Mewtwo really specializes in neutering things with Taunt + Status + Recover spam, it will often rely on prediction between status and Taunt (Gyro Ball vs Leech Seed on Ferrothorn, for example). One wrong move can prove fatal.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize bulk while allowing Mewtwo to outspeed Tornadus-T. Otherwise, you can run enough Speed to outspeed Darkrai (216 EVs with a Timid nature), or, if outspeeding Arceus isn't a concern, drop it down to enough to outspeed base 110s Pokemon such as Latias, Latios, and Lugia (96 EVs with a Timid nature). 88 EVs and a neutral nature let Mewtwo outspeed base 95s such as Rayquaza and Kyurem-W. Mewtwo can even go physically defensive, by shifting the Special Defense EVs to Defense.</p> <p>Without Light Screen, powerful special attackers can demolish Mewtwo, although not many like taking even an uninvested Psystrike (252/0 Kyogre has a good chance to be 2HKOed after Stealth Rock). Chansey and Blissey can easily sponge special attacks if you forgo Light Screen for Psystrike, making them excellent partners. Mewtwo in return can easily switch in on Fighting-type moves such as Close Combat, and OHKO most Fighting-types with Psystrike. Psystrike also KOes Tentacruel, which can Rapid Spin on Mewtwo as well. One of the great things about this Mewtwo set is that it completely rewrites the list of Pokemon that can check or counter it; defensive or bulky Pokemon hoping to tank a hit from Mewtwo and cripple it through non-attacking methods are now easily neutered.</p> <p>Darkrai, Ho-Oh, and Reshiram are the biggest enemies to this set if Mewtwo is running Will-O-Wisp. Darkrai doesn't really care about anything Mewtwo can run besides Toxic and can smash it with Dark Pulse or sleep it with Dark Void. Be aware though, that with the right prediction, Mewtwo can use Light Screen to cushion Dark Pulse and prevent Dark Void with Taunt, so taking out Mewtwo with Darkrai might not be simple. Ho-Oh and Reshiram don't really appreciate Psystrike, but can wall Mewtwo to no end if it lacks both Psystrike and Toxic. Stealth Rock support and something to deal with them is helpful if you forgo both of these moves. Kyogre can take care of these Fire-types as well as Darkrai, provided that Sleep Clause is activated or Kyogre is running a Sleep Talk set. Your own Ho-Oh can also help deal with Reshiram and Darkrai.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes completely neuter this Mewtwo set, so a spinner or absorber (such as Forretress, Tentacruel, Excadrill, Arceus-Poison) is almost mandatory. Toxic Spikes support of your own might conflict with the use of Will-O-Wisp, but they notably allow Mewtwo to simply Taunt and begin spamming Recover without having to waste a turn using Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. Like most defensive Pokemon, this set appreciates entry hazard support for the switching it will cause, especially against stall teams. Xatu easily shuts this set down with Magic Bounce unless you are willing to use Ice Beam over Psystrike, which is not recommended. Heatran will also annoy this set due to its immunity to both burn and poison and resistance to Psystrike. Either Kyogre or Zekrom can help deal with both Heatran and Xatu. Prankster users such as Sableye, Thundurus, and Tornadus can Taunt Mewtwo before it Taunts them, though the latter two have to watch out for Psystrike. Kyogre can also take down most of them without much effort, although it will need a Choice Scarf to outspeed Thundurus.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Mewtwo's power and excellent Speed let it outpace many dangerous threats and be a decent revenge killer. With a Choice Scarf, it reaches 591 Speed, outspeeding anything not at +2. Besides revenge killing, Mewtwo can also clean late-game when its counters, such as Lugia, are weakened. Psystrike is for STAB and is generally Mewtwo's most powerful move, but beware of trappers such as Tyranitar coming in for free. Thanks to Psystrike, Mewtwo has a good chance of breaking past Blissey and Chansey with entry hazard support. Mewtwo easily OHKOes Pokemon such as Rayquaza and Salamence with Ice Beam. Fire Blast, Flamethrower and Aura Sphere let it revenge kill Excadrill and most Steel-types. Additionally, it's good to have Aura Sphere in there somewhere for neutral-Speed-natured SmashPass recipients such as Dialga, as well as Choice Scarf Darkrai. Aura Sphere is also Mewtwo's only option to 2HKO defensive Tyranitar, and nails Heatran for solid damage too. Trick can let Mewtwo cripple a wall, such as Lugia and Giratina, which would both be more willing to switch in if they see no Life Orb recoil. It can also surprise Latias and Latios by removing their prized Soul Dew.</p> <p>The EV spread listed gives Mewtwo maximizes Mewtwo's Speed, letting it outspeed Kingdra in the rain, Adamant Excadrill in the sand, Choice Scarf Shaymin-S, Darkrai, Venusaur, and Shiftry in the sun, and Rock Polish Adamant Groudon. It also lets Mewtwo continue to outspeed unboosted threats if it has Tricked its Choice Scarf away. However, since Mewtwo is so fast, it can afford to invest in bulk or a Modest nature if outspeeding the aforementioned threats are not crucial for your team. A spread of 52 HP / 252 SpA / 204 Spe and a Modest nature outspeeds Choice Scarf Terrakion. 176 HP / 252 SpA / 80 Spe with a Timid nature also outpaces Terrakion, but focuses more on bulk. 240 HP / 252 SpA / 16 Spe outspeeds +1 base 100s.</p> <p>Mewtwo has some other coverage moves it can use thanks to its wide movepool. Thunder can be used to hit Kyogre harder but will fail to OHKO or even 2HKO specially defensive Kyogre, generally making Psystrike the safer option to hit the whale. Shadow Ball is another option to hit opposing Mewtwo, Lugia, Arceus-Ghost, Wobbuffet and Giratina, but is a really weak move otherwise. Mewtwo still can't revenge kill ExtremeKiller Arceus, so you'll need something else for it—Aura Sphere will only 2HKO Arceus while a boosted Extreme Speed will OHKO Mewtwo. If running Fire Blast, sun support is good for maximum power; in the sun, Fire Blast is even stronger than Psystrike. Wobbuffet can easily trap this Mewtwo, so you will have to predict carefully when you see one. Watch out for entry hazard layers such as Ferrothorn and Forretress, as they can switch into pretty much any move besides Fire Blast and Aura Sphere. Mewtwo can no longer break walls as effectively with this set, as the power reduction is rather significant, even standard Great Wall Giratina will never be 2HKOed by Ice Beam. However, they will need to watch out for Trick.</p>"

  "Mew": {
    "overview": "<p>With a movepool even Arceus envies, decent bulk, and acceptable Speed, Mew is one of the most versatile Pokemon in the game. It has all the necessary tools to be a fantastic team player and can run a Baton Pass set, scout, or even lead. That being said, Mew's poor typing, as well as the nerf to Explosion in BW, and the addition of Dragon Tail does slightly hamper Mew's effectiveness, but it is still very capable of doing its job when played well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Mew's movepool is incredibly vast, its typing and stats force it to compete for most other roles with its relative, Mewtwo. Explosion still stings and can be used to put a dent in whatever may be in at the time, but nothing of importance is OHKOed by it without substantial Attack investment. Mew can pull off a double status set with Thunder Wave and either Will-O-Wisp or Hypnosis, though Darkrai generally does this better due to a more accurate sleep-inducing move in Dark Void and much greater Speed. A physically defensive set with Will-O-Wisp, Super Fang, Taunt, and Soft-Boiled can really hamper common switch-ins to Mew, such as Giratina-O, Groudon, Swords Dance Arceus, and Rayquaza, though Mewtwo usually outclasses this due to its higher Speed. A more offensive Baton Pass set with one of Rock Polish / Swords Dance / Nasty Plot, 2 coverage moves, and Baton Pass could let Mew snag a quick kill before passing the boost and makes it a bit less dependent on dual screen support; keep in mind that the recipient will be much less threatening with only one of either an Attack or Speed boost, as both are usually necessary to pull off a clean sweep. Running Mew alongside standard bulky set-up sweepers such as Rock Polish Groudon and Flame Charge Reshiram can mitigate this problem, as Mew can pass one stat boost, preferably +2 Atk / SpA in this case, while they retain the ability to boost their Speed themselves, if given the chance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mew can run far too many sets to have a concrete counter; figure out the set, and then make a plan. The Baton Pass set's counters depend mostly on the fourth move choice; it resembles a game of rock, paper, and scissors: Taunt beats Roar, Substitute beats Dragon Tail, and Magic Coat beats Dark Void and priority Taunt users. Although technically speaking, Lum Berry + Taunt still beats Dark Void, it is a lot nicer to just put Darkrai to sleep, and still works if Mew switches into Toxic Spikes. MixQuaza can break through the dual screens with Brick Break and punish either Mew or the recipient very hard with a Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor followed by Extreme Speed. Rayquaza also has the option of using Dragon Tail to force the recipient out should they not be protected by a Substitute. Most Uber Pokemon commonly seen in the lead spot can 2HKO the lead set, though they must be wary of status on the second turn if your lead is slower. Choice Scarf Kyogre always beats the lead set, OHKOing Mew with Water Spout before it can accomplish anything. Ho-Oh is usually a good switch-in as Mew can really only Taunt it, while Ho-Oh can threaten back with a potentially boosted Punishment or STAB Sacred Fire / Brave Bird; however, with Taunt preventing recovery, Stealth Rock will wear Ho-Oh down very quickly. Choice Specs Reshiram is a threat to every Mew set so long as the sun is out, as Blue Flare will at worst 2HKO. In Dream World, Shadow Tag Chandelure can trap and kill any Mew lacking +2 Speed to Baton Pass out with. However, under Light Screen and with the suggested EVs, Choice Scarf Chandelure's Shadow Ball is only a 4HKO, factoring in Leftovers.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Mew has the ability to set up an almost certainly game breaking sweep in the blink of an eye, and with dual screen support, it can be very hard to stop. The strategy is simple: bring Mew in when the coast looks clear, usually after one of your own Pokemon faints, and start boosting. Rock Polish is a must to provide the recipient with the Speed necessary to attempt a sweep. The choice between Swords Dance and Nasty Plot depends on the recipient your team is built around; a physically based recipient will require Swords Dance, while a specially based one will need Nasty Plot. Baton Pass is the crux of the set and lets Mew pass any boosts it has accumulated to something more capable of using them. The last slot decides what Mew can effectively set up on. Substitute is the primary option, as it blocks status, prevents Dragon Tail's phazing effect, and can be Baton Passed, although Taunt is still an option to stop Roar or Whirlwind. Magic Coat has a few interesting uses, namely shooting back status moves such as Dark Void and sending any traditional phazing moves back at the user.</p> <p>Leftovers is usually the best choice to help Mew keep up a Substitute, and survive a bit longer to potentially squeeze in another boost, but Lum Berry is the preferred option should you forgo Substitute for Taunt or Magic Coat, as an untimely status affliction can spell doom for Mew. The EVs listed provide optimum bulk while still outspeeding Deoxys-S after a Rock Polish, though an alternate spread of 252 HP / 168 Def / 20 SpD / 68 Spe with a Bold nature will let Mew survive a Life Orb-boosted Shadow Claw + Extreme Speed from Arceus, without screens, while still outpacing any stray Deoxys-S after a Speed boost. Don't be afraid to use Baton Pass before gaining any boosts if the situation is not yet ideal for Mew. Of course, it is not a very good idea if Reflect and Light Screen are already in place, but bringing Mew out early in the game and immediately using Baton Pass out can give you a shot at taking on your opponent's Baton counter(s) before they get a chance to take on Mew.</p> <p>Mew really depends on dual screen support to keep it alive long enough to set up, so teammates capable of consistently providing them are necessary. Mewtwo, Latios, and Deoxys-S are the most effective dual screen users, each with their own niche. Mewtwo has access to Self-Destruct to bring Mew in unscathed, while also getting a decent hit on the opponent's active Pokemon. Latios follows suit with Memento, this time sharply lowering the opponent's offensive stats in exchange for its remaining life. Lastly, Deoxys-S possesses insane Speed and can lay Stealth Rock or Spikes in addition to the screens. Keep in mind that all three share common weaknesses with Mew, so make sure to have Ghost-, Dark-, and Bug-type resistances worked into the rest of the team.</p> <p>Groudon is the usually the best physical recipient, though Terrakion gives it competition through better STAB coverage and resistance to Extreme Speed. Though much less bulky, Terrakion can potentially snag a third devastating attack boost if it comes in on Dark Pulse / Crunch thanks to its ability, Justified. On the other hand, Dialga is the best specially-based recipient; with sky-high Special Attack, great resistances to both Extreme Speed and Bullet Punch, as well as solid overall bulk, it will nearly always pull off a sweep when successfully passed to. Wobbuffet can net Mew or a dual screen user a free turn to start setting up, but keep overall weaknesses in mind. Scizor and Forretress both have good synergy with Mew, and can bring Mew in off of a slow U-turn or set up and remove away entry hazards to support the team, respectively. Kyogre can generally force common phazers such as Groudon and Lugia out should they try and stand in Mew's way.</p> <p>Mew's counters are largely dependent on the final move choice on the set. If Substitute is used, users of Roar and Whirlwind, such as Groudon and Skarmory, can freely phaze Mew's hard work away; the same goes for Dragon Tail users such as Giratina and Lugia if Taunt is chosen. Lastly, Darkrai and Prankster users can be troublesome without Magic Coat to redirect their Dark Void and priority Taunt, respectively. That said, there are a few Pokemon that can outright kill Mew, even when behind screens. Choice Specs Kyogre can 2HKO with Water Spout or just spam Ice Beam should the opponent know your recipient is a Groudon. Choice Band Tyranitar can 2HKO with Crunch or Payback, but neither Dialga or Groudon will mind switching into it much, while Terrakion will actually enjoy it. Punishment Ho-Oh can cause problems as well, and can catch you off guard with Whirlwind, or land a burn on the recipient with Sacred Fire. Although relatively uncommon, Choice Scarf Deoxys-S can outspeed Mew or the recipient after a boost and cripple them with Trick.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This modified version of Mew's familiar 4th generation lead set can prove quite useful for offensive and balanced teams needing a Stealth Rock user, scout, and anti-lead, but are strapped for teamslots. The drastic drop in Explosion's power took an important card out of Mew's deck, but without it Mew still functions nearly as well. Stealth Rock is, as always, an important move to have, especially considering the relatively few Pokemon in the Uber environment capable of deploying it. The choice between Taunt and Magic Coat dictates how Mew will deal with opposing leads' attempts to set up. Taunt denies slower leads such as Groudon, Forretress, and Dialga the use of their supporting moves, most notably preventing their early use of entry hazards. Magic Coat allows Mew to bounce faster or priority Taunts back at the user, as well as sending back Darkrai's Dark Void; it can also help in dealing with early entry hazard users, often preventing the opponent from setting up their hazards and getting a layer up for yourself at the same time. U-turn is a great utility move and can help Mew escape unfavorable lead matchups, break Focus Sashes on leads such as Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A, as well as provide Mew with some usefulness midgame after the other moves have served their purpose. The choice between Fake Out and Magic Coat depends on whether you prefer to break Focus Sashes, or have extra insurance against opposing leads setting up. It should be noted that the extra damage from Fake Out can at times be significant, and the ability to break Deoxys-A's Focus Sash and tack on the rough equivalent of Stealth Rock damage before U-turning out of Pokemon such as Deoxys-S and Darkrai is never to be overlooked.</p> <p>Mew does not have many options other relevant to the lead spot. Explosion can still hurt Pokemon such as Chansey, Hasty Palkia, and Kyogre, but it never OHKOes without a ridiculous amount of Attack investment (we are talking Adamant with a Choice Band here), so it is rarely worth it. Will-O-Wisp is an interesting option to cripple Groudon leads and other random physically-based switch-ins, though the listed moves are more useful overall.</p> <p>Being a support oriented Pokemon itself, Mew does not require much support other than help dealing with a select few leads: Deoxys-S, Darkrai, Arceus-Ghost, Choice Scarf Kyogre, and Rayquaza. Choice Band Scizor has good synergy with Mew, and can take 4 HP variants of Deoxys-S and Darkrai out with Bullet Punch after Fake Out + U-turn from Mew. Arceus-Ghost can Magic Coat Mew's Stealth Rock / Taunt back, or 2HKO it with STAB Judgment or Shadow Claw, while Mew can do nothing back. Groudon can generally handle Arceus-Ghost, though variants with Will-O-Wisp can prove troublesome. Palkia can switch into Kyogre's Water Spout and threaten Rayquaza out after Mew breaks any potential Focus Sash with Fake Out. Giratina-O can keep Mew's Stealth Rock on the field, and also pick off Deoxys-S and Mewtwo with Shadow Sneak; note that their typings stack weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, however.</p>"

  "Xatu": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Xatu's extremely underwhelming stats may make it seem like an odd choice for an Uber team, its wonderful ability, Magic Bounce, makes it an excellent supporter and stallbreaker. With Magic Bounce, Xatu walls Ferrothorn and Forretress, completely turning the tables on them by reflecting their entry hazards and status moves. Xatu's high base 95 Speed enables it to get the upper hand on the base 90s that swamp Ubers, allowing it to invest in its Defense. Anyone who uses this feline bird with proper prediction can be confident that stall will not disturb their team. However, not everything is fun and games for Xatu. Its poor base 70 Special Defense and a weakness to the very rocks it reflects make life hard for this bird. This does not mean it is outclassed by the only other Magic Bounce Pokemon; the more specially defensive Espeon, as Xatu has better physical bulk. Regardless, the support Xatu's ability provides still makes it an excellent choice for any Uber team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Toxic / Heat Wave / Roost / Night Shade can be an effective stall breaker. It allows Xatu to take full advantage of its immunity to Roar, Whirlwind, and decent physical bulk to destroy common Spikers. A Calm Mind set with Psyshock, Heat Wave, and Roost can also make use of Magic Bounce to set up and possibly sweep. However, it will struggle against Giratina-O and Espeon is a more effective user of this strategy due to the fact it has better Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed. Finally, Xatu has the ability to set up Trick Room and proceed to U-turn to a more capable attacker. This not only sets up slower Pokemon for a sweep, but also prevents the entry hazards that, for instance, weaken Kyogre's Water Spout. Xatu's lack of special bulk and Trick Room's -7 priority may prevent it from surviving long enough to twist the dimensions, though.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Xatu can prevent Stealth Rock from being set up, wall Ferrothorn and Forretress, and set up dual screens. That is unfortunately pretty much the extent of Xatu's abilities. Its base stats often leave it overwhelmed in Ubers, as Kyogre, Palkia, Mewtwo, Shaymin-S, and most variants of specially offensive Arceus can happily switch in on all of Xatu's attacks, bar Toxic, and OHKO or 2HKO with their powerful special attacks. Dialga and Deoxys-A can do the same, but are even more threatening as they have access to Stealth Rock. Furthermore, the former has a Toxic immunity that leaves Xatu useless against it. Zekrom can also switch into anything but Toxic and OHKO with Bolt Strike or Fusion Bolt, although Choice Scarf variants will only manage a 2HKO if Reflect is up. Tyranitar deserves a special mention since it also sets up Stealth Rock, and can hit Xatu for super effective damage with Pursuit. Pursuit from Life Orb or Choice Band Tyranitar does well over 50% to Xatu even with Reflect up and will OHKO if Xatu switches. Offensive Groudon is also troublesome as Xatu will often switch in to catch Stealth Rock or Earthquake only to be outsped and OHKOed by a super effective Stone Edge. Xatu also fears Choice Scarf Terrakion and Victini in the sun, as they both always 2HKO Xatu and have a decent chance of OHKOing even through Reflect. Choice Band Metagross is not threatened by any of Xatu's moves and can continue to Meteor Mash until it gets an Attack boost or a critical hit for an OHKO. Scizor and Heracross can also annoy Xatu by hitting it with powerful Bug-type STAB moves when it Roosts, but they will take huge damage from Heat Wave in sun.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Xatu is able to completely prevent Ferrothorn, Forretress, Skarmory, Tentacruel, Deoxys-D, and Deoxys-S from setting up any entry hazards. It can make use of these free turns to support its team with Light Screen and Reflect, making it a great choice for offensive and stall teams alike. Its physical bulk, immunity to Ground-type moves, 4x resistance to Fighting, and access to reliable recovery in the form of Roost enable it to tank several physical attacks, which is something that its competitor, Espeon, cannot do. For example, Ferrothorn 2HKOes Espeon with Gyro Ball or Power Whip, but is unable to do the same to Xatu. Its physical bulk enables it to wall even most defensive Groudon, reflecting the Stealth Rock this land behemoth attempts to set up and throwing up a Reflect to tank incoming Stone Edges. Magic Bounce not only reflects hazards, but also status moves such as Taunt, Encore, Whirlwind, and Roar; therefore, with accurate prediction, Xatu makes a nice switch-in to Darkrai's signature Dark Void (although beware of its unreliable 80% accuracy), Taunt from the Deoxys formes, and Whirlwind from Lugia. Such talents are what make it a fantastic stall killer.</p> <p>In the final moveslot, Night Shade provides the most consistent damage, while sun support lets Heat Wave 2HKO the most specially defensive Ferrothorn and OHKO all Forretress once Sturdy is broken. Although Toxic leaves you ineffectual against these two Steel-types, Xatu can still PP stall Ferrothorn, and Toxic allows Xatu to wear down the likes of Ho-Oh, Groudon, and Lugia.</p> <p>Light Clay is obviously the preferred item for a dual screen supporter, but Leftovers is viable to ensure greater longevity against Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball, Groudon's Stone Edge, or Dialga's Draco Meteor. Xatu can also run a set with Wish and U-turn for additional team support. However, its Wishes are rather small due to Xatu's low base HP and this will reduce its longevity. Nonetheless, if such a set is desired, a Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs may be used to take a hit before Xatu's teammate is brought in.</p> <p>Xatu works well with anything that dislikes hazards, such as Ho-Oh or Kyogre, or benefits from screens, such as Rayquaza and Cloyster. However, it particularly enjoys Giratina-O and Groudon support. The former can block Forretress's Rapid Spin, and if you are brave, even be switched back for Xatu to nab another layer of hazards. Meanwhile, Groudon provides sun for Giratina-O or Xatu to pound Ferrothorn and Forretress with a boosted Heat Wave. It furthermore checks several of Xatu's biggest threats, including Zekrom, Terrakion, and Tyranitar. Ho-Oh also fits nicely into this combination, taking advantage of the lack of Stealth Rock and the sun from Groudon.</p> <p>With no investment in its paltry base 70 base Special Defense, Xatu is OHKOed by all of Kyogre's attacks and Draco Meteor from any specially offensive Dragon-type. However, correct prediction and Light Screen will allow it to wall Dialga and Choice Scarf Palkia. Both Chansey and Ferrothorn provide excellent support by taking advantage of the lack of hazards while soaking up these troublesome special attacks. Lastly, it should be noted that Dialga, Tyranitar, Deoxys-A, and Offensive Groudon can all set up Stealth Rock, but can also OHKO Xatu. Hence, Xatu requires a fairly high level of prediction to prevent Stealth Rock entirely.</p>"

  "Espeon": {
    "overview": "<p>At first, Espeon might seem completely out of place in the Ubers metagame. Aside from its Special Attack and Speed its other stats are pitiful, as base 65 / 60 / 95 defenses make Espeon very vulnerable to the powerful attacks thrown around in the tier, especially priority ones. It also has a barren movepool, making it one-dimensional and easy to play around. Being Pursuit weak is another undesirable quality, making Espeon easy pickings for Tyranitar and Scizor. To top it all off, its only form of recovery, Morning Sun, is near useless in the rain-infested metagame.</p> <p>However, it's Espeon's phenomenal ability, Magic Bounce, that makes it worth using in Ubers. This coveted ability allows it to deflect all forms of entry hazards, ensuring that dangerous sun sweepers, such as Ho-Oh and Kyurem-W, don't go down prematurely. Magic Bounce also allows Espeon to ward off other support moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Toxic, Roar, and Whirlwind, giving stall team headaches, as they usually rely on these moves to stall out their opponents. Espeon also happens to be capable of stopping Forretress and Skarmory, two common hazard setters, in their tracks and KO them. When thinking of a team supporter that can perform these roles, Xatu might come to mind first due to its immunity to Earthquake, reliable recovery, and slightly higher Defense. Unlike Xatu, however, Espeon can deal a fair amount of damage, preventing it from becoming setup bait. Espeon cannot be used recklessly though; it needs a good deal of team support to get its job done. One slight misprediction could result in Espeon's demise.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A dual screens set has merits, as Espeon is not stopped by Taunt and isn't setup fodder for entry hazard setters, but Deoxys-S pulls this off better thanks to higher Speed and makes up for its vulnerability to Taunt with access to the move itself. A set with Trick and a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs can allow Espeon to outpace or hit opposing Pokemon hard, while being able to cripple a wall—but again, Deoxys-S outclasses it in this role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hard-hitting priority users, such as Arceus, Giratina-O, and Scizor, will quickly dispatch of Espeon due to its frailty, although Scizor will have to watch out for Hidden Power Fire. Speaking of Scizor, it can also Pursuit trap Espeon if it decides to switch out. Tyranitar does this job even better, as it is at best 2HKOed by Hidden Power Fighting or Grass Knot after Stealth Rock. Ho-Oh can easily take anything bar Psyshock and OHKO back. Like a lot of Pokemon, Espeon can be preyed upon by revenge killers, as almost any Choice Scarf user in the tier can outpace and KO Espeon with the appropriate move. The most prominent of these is Genesect, which easily OHKOes it with U-turn after Espeon's Focus Sash is broken.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Focus Sash Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>As Espeon is fast, frail, and fairly powerful, a Focus Sash set immediately comes to mind. Being able to stop most defensive hazard setters—and even some offensive ones—this set can make way for powerful teammates that are troubled by entry hazards. Psyshock is preferred in the first slot as it is Espeon's better STAB move, allowing it to OHKO Tentacruel and Terrakion after Stealth Rock. Shadow Ball is another viable option to hit Deoxys-S and KO heavily weakened Mewtwo, Giratina-O, and Arceus-Ghost on the switch. Yawn prevents Espeon from being setup bait for the likes of Arceus and Mewtwo. Grass Knot is important, as it is Espeon's best move against Kyogre, Groudon, and Tyranitar, 2HKOing all of them after Stealth Rock. Lastly, Hidden Power Fire hits Skarmory and Forretress, two common hazard setters, for super effective damage.</p> <p>There are two other options that Espeon can make use of. The first is Baton Pass, which can be used to scout for counters and escape Pursuit. This can help preserve Espeon's Focus Sash and possibly allow it to come back later and bounce back entry hazards. The second viable option is Hidden Power Fighting, which is its best option against Tyranitar and Dialga; however, it will still fail to OHKO both and the former takes a good amount of damage from Grass Knot.</p> <p>The most obvious partner for Espeon is Groudon; it can easily take on Tyranitar, Scizor, and Dialga, all of which can force Espeon out. The sun it summons also powers up the Fire-type moves of Ho-Oh, Reshiram, and Kyurem-W, all of which appreciate Magic Bounce support, making them good teammates as well. Sun support also makes Morning Sun restore up to 67% of Espeon's health, making it a viable option. Another good teammate to consider is Choice Scarf Terrakion, who threatens Extreme Killer Arceus, Darkrai, and both Kyurem formes, all which Pokemon can otherwise trouble Espeon's other teammate, Groudon. Finally, Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost can stop Genesect, which easily threatens Espeon with its powerful STAB U-turn.</p> <p>It should be noted that due to Espeon's frailty, it will usually only block hazards twice; once when at full health, and once when it is down to its Focus Sash. However, Tyranitar will only let Espeon block them once, as it will Pursuit trap Espeon if it switches out, leaving it at 1 HP. Tyranitar can then proceed to set up Stealth Rock, thus taking Espeon out the moment it attempts to switch in. Excadrill sets up Stealth Rock with impunity due to Mold Breaker bypassing the effects of Magic Bounce. Groudon, and to a lesser extent, Terrakion, make good teammates as they can threaten these two entry hazard setters with STAB Earthquake or Close Combat.</p>"

  "Wobbuffet": {
    "overview": "<p>Although it might seem like Wobbuffet has dramatically fallen from grace this generation, not much has actually changed for the blue blob in Ubers. A common misconception about Wobbuffet is that Encore's nerf has greatly diminished Wobbuffet's utility, but this doesn't actually affect it much in Ubers. As Wobbuffet will almost always use Encore last--the main exception is against Ferrothorn--Wobbuffet's Encore will almost always last the full three turns, which is more than enough time for fearsome sweepers such as Mewtwo and Rayquaza to set up.</p> <p>Don't let these setbacks fool you: while a variety of common Choice Scarf users, such as Palkia and Zekrom, plague the Ubers metagame, Shadow Tag means Wobbuffet does an excellent job of revenge killing them, allowing insanely powerful sweepers such as Mewtwo and Darkrai to crush the many teams that rely on Choice Scarf users to beat them! Wobbuffet's utility doesn't stop there either. Encore still allows Wobbuffet to aid in setting up sweepers, and with most Mewtwo forgoing Taunt this generation, Wobbuffet can now check most Mewtwo in the rain. Finally, Wobbuffet's classic Tickle + Pursuit strategy is still an extremely effective way of defeating walls such as Lugia and Blissey, opening up holes for the many powerful sweepers of Ubers to demolish even a well-constructed stall team. Overall, despite Wobbuffet's downgrades this generation, its amazing and unique support capabilities make it a fine choice for any offensive Ubers team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wobbuffet doesn't have any other options, as the aforementioned set is all it can do. Splash is completely useless, and Wobbuffet is not bulky enough to utilize Charm. Before Wobbuffet can use Charm enough times to completely cripple the foe, it would take too much damage, making it prone to any attack. In comparison to Safeguard or Tickle, the aforementioned moves are completely useless. Destiny Bond is a great option to take the opponent down with Wobbuffet if it is KOed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Wobbuffet's Shadow Tag ability doesn't let most opponents switch out; therefore, Wobbuffet has no real counters. However, there are a few ways to deal with it, as Wobbuffet does have its weaknesses. Once you see Wobbuffet in the opponent's team roster, be sure to play carefully, as you do not want to lose a team member to a poorly thought-out move. Hitting hard and hitting fast as Wobbuffet switches in is the most solid way to deal with it, as even with its respectable bulk, Wobbuffet cannot take repeated hard-hitting moves such as Draco Meteor, Fire Blast, Thunder, Hydro Pump, and more. Unless Wobbuffet has used Safeguard, inflicting it with status, especially poison, also helps; this puts a lot of pressure on the opponent while also shortening Wobbuffet's lifespan.</p> <p>Wobbuffet also has no reliable form of recovery, which makes the \"hit hard and hit fast\" strategy much more solid. A common mistake of many Wobbuffet users is using Encore on Spikes or Toxic Spikes. Not only does that directly impact Wobbuffet's effectiveness, it affects your teammates by stripping down their HP or poisoning them.</p> <p>Overall, Psychic is not a great defensive type: it makes Wobbuffet weak to Ghost-, Dark-, and Bug-type moves. Darkrai is probably the biggest threat to Wobbuffet. Not only is it immune to Mirror Coat, but it packs a super effective STAB in Dark Pulse and can put Wobbuffet to sleep with Dark Void to avoid the Encore if Safeguard is not in effect. From there, Darkrai can set up Nasty Plot and proceed to sweep. Scizor also is a huge problem for Wobbuffet. It can U-turn to scout Wobbuffet's next move, and if Wobbuffet stays in, it gets KOed easily. Scizor can also use Pursuit on the switch to hit a fleeing Wobbuffet very hard. Arceus-Ghost and Arceus-Dark also make great examples of Pokemon that have super effective attacks against Wobbuffet. Both can set up Calm Mind and hit very hard with their STAB Judgment but risk being Encored by Wobbuffet. Choice Specs Kyogre and Reshiram are the hardest hitters in the entire tier, utilizing Water Spout or Blue Flare to OHKO Wobbuffet with the aid of rain or sun, respectively.</p> <p>Another way to deal with Wobbuffet is to simply Taunt it. Taunt prevents Wobbuffet from using Encore or Safeguard, thus making it setup fodder for the likes of Extreme Killer Arceus, Rayquaza, Mewtwo, and Cloyster. Wobbuffet also becomes weak to status, as it cannot use Safeguard to protect itself.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Oh, no! It's Wobbuffet! (Standard)": {
        "description": "<p>This is Wobbuffet's most famous and only set. This set is all Wobbuffet can really do because of its shallow movepool. Once the foe sees Wobbuffet in your team, you can be sure he is going to play very carefully, as only minimal prediction is required for Wobbuffet to take at least one member of his team down. Mirror Coat and Counter are staples on Wobbuffet: if you predict the foe to use a special attack, if he is Choice-locked, or if Wobbuffet has used Encore to lock him into a special move, obviously go for Mirror Coat. Otherwise, Counter is the obvious choice.</p> <p>Both Safeguard and Tickle are great support moves. Safeguard is the main option, as it protects Wobbuffet and the rest of the team from status and can also allow setup sweepers to nab a free turn if Wobbuffet Encores a status move. Tickle, however, requires a teammate that can use Pursuit, and while that strategy does not always fit in every team, it's still as solid as before.</p> <p>252 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature give Wobbuffet a much-needed Special Defense boost so it can better take hits from special attackers, which are more common than physical attackers in Ubers. 28 HP EVs grant Wobbuffet a Leftovers number, and with the 252 EVs invested in Special Defense, a healthy Wobbuffet can take Kyogre's full-health rain-boosted STAB Water Spout, the hardest hitting attack in Ubers. The leftover EVs are dumped into Defense so Wobbuffet will take physical attacks better.</p> <p>Because Wobbuffet's support allows many Pokemon to switch in safely, setup sweepers make fantastic partners. Not only does Wobbuffet let them switch in safely, it also lets them set up freely. Extreme Killer Arceus really appreciates the opportunity to come in safely, set up, and wreak havoc. It also appreciates Wobbuffet's ability to remove Choice Scarf users; Terrakion in particular is a huge threat for the Killer. Arceus-Ghost and Arceus-Ground fall in the same boat. Perhaps the Arceus forme that most needs Wobbuffet's support is Arceus-Dragon, as the huge amount of Choice Scarf Dragon-types in the tier, such as Palkia and Zekrom, can OHKO Arceus-Dragon with their STAB Dragon-type moves, and therefore ruin His sweep. Salamence, Garchomp, and Rayquaza also fall in the category of sweepers who appreciate Wobbuffet support because Wobbuffet can Encore Earthquake or Thunder to let the respective teammate switch in and set up safely.</p> <p>Darkrai and Mewtwo are two Pokemon that strike fear into the hearts of any team, as with a single boost from Nasty Plot or Calm Mind, they can completely tear most teams apart. Most teams rely on Choice Scarf users to beat them, and if they play wrongly they will fall to Wobbuffet, and allow Darkrai or Mewtwo to sweep with ease. The two can also use Substitute to scout the opponent's team, and take advantage of it to either set up or hit with the appropriate move and run.</p> <p>Cloyster is one of the most fearsome setup sweepers in the entire game, especially in Ubers. After a Shell Smash boost, Cloyster can OHKO the three main physical walls in Ubers--Groudon, Lugia, and Giratina--with Icicle Spear. However, Cloyster's terrible Special Defense makes it almost impossible to switch in. Thus, Wobbuffet's support is almost mandatory for Cloyster to work. Blaziken and Excadrill are similarly not bulky enough to switch in, but the latter also needs sandstorm support in order to sweep effectively.</p> <p>Double Dance Groudon and Terrakion can also make use of Wobbuffet's capabilities. If Wobbuffet Encores a move that Groudon or Terrakion resist, they can put a lot of pressure on the opponent. If the opponent's team is slow, they can boost their Attack to a sky-high level and rip the opposing team apart. However, if the opponent's team is frail and offensive, both can simply boost their Speed by a single Rock Polish and wreak havoc. Though it cannot boost its already respectable Speed, Manaphy falls in the same category. The bonuses it gets over Groudon and Terrakion are immediate +3 Special Attack by using a single Tail Glow and immunity to status and instant recovery in rain by using Rest.</p> <p>Wobbuffet can also trap and eliminate Ferrothorn: it switches in on any move not named Spikes, Encores it, and if Ferrothorn uses Power Whip or Gyro Ball, it will become dead weight. Palkia, Manaphy, Arceus-Water, and Kyogre will appreciate this support, as Ferrothorn puts a cold stop to their stay on the battleground due to its STAB and amazing typing.</p> <p>If using Tickle, be sure to carry a Pursuit user such as Tyranitar, Scizor, or Metagross on your team, as these Pokemon can OHKO the foe as it attempts to switch out after a few Tickles. For example, after 3 Tickles, 56 Attack Choice Band Scizor has a 74.36% chance to OHKO standard Chansey as she switches out, and after 4 Tickles it's an OHKO. 252 Attack Scizor will always OHKO -3 Chansey after Stealth Rock as she attempts to switch out, while 64 Attack Choice Band Tyranitar can OHKO a -2 fleeing Chansey. Lugia is at more risk, as 252 Attack Choice Band Scizor will always OHKO -3 Lugia switching out, while Tyranitar only needs Lugia to be Tickled twice to always OHKO with Pursuit.</p>"

  "Forretress": {
    "overview": "<p>Much has changed with the shift to BW, but Forretress is still Forretress. It remains exceptionally good at what it does, namely providing entry hazard and Rapid Spin support, but outside of that role, it is extremely limited. BW brought it a few buffs in Volt Switch and the improvement to Sturdy, which now acts as a pseudo-Focus Sash. Sadly, threats such as Reshiram and Magic Bounce Xatu have also come into play, making life a bit harder. All in all, play safe, support Forretress well, and watch as your opponent is shredded and poisoned at every turn by layer after layer of entry hazards. Be a bit careless and predict wrongly, though, and shudder as your bagworm is wiped out every match without fail.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As previously mentioned, Forretress is fairly limited outside of the listed options. Shed Shell is an option to escape from Magnezone, but Forretress will greatly miss the Leftovers recovery. Forretress learns Reflect and Light Screen, and can thus make decent use of a dual screens set, but it should usually opt to Volt Switch out or simply lay more entry hazards rather than use a screen. Under Light Screen and rain, however, Forretress can be a tough nut to crack with even Fire-type attacks. Protect can be used in the last slot to scout for foes carrying a surprise Fire-type attack, such as Espeon and Groudon, and also eases prediction when dealing with Choice item users, but the listed moves are generally more useful, and Forretress already has many move options as it is. Earthquake can be used to catch Heatran, Magnezone, and Reshiram on the switch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Magic Bounce Espeon and Xatu with Hidden Power Fire are probably Forretress's biggest counters; they reflect its attempts to set up entry hazards and can OHKO with a 4x super effective Hidden Power. Tentacruel can also be annoying, as it absorbs Toxic Spikes, has access to Rapid Spin, and can scare Forretress off with a potentially rain-boosted Scald, while Forretress can do little back bar Earthquake. Forretress has trouble with any Pokemon carrying a Fire-type move as well, as most of them will OHKO if rain is not present; Reshiram, Dialga, Palkia, Giratina-O, and Mewtwo are the most common users. Although Groudon is normally setup fodder for Forretress, it will sometimes run Fire Punch or Overheat to fry the bug. Both Ho-Oh and Reshiram can switch in at will and threaten Forretress with their STAB Fire-type attacks, only really fearing Stealth Rock damage or Toxic. Kyogre has little to fear from any of Forretress's attacks, and can drown Forretress with its Water-type STAB moves. Finally, although rare in today's metagame, Heatran can roast Forretress with Lava Plume or Fire Blast, and Poison Heal Gliscor can freely come in and either Taunt Forretress or set up a Substitute.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Forretress's amazing Bug / Steel typing, great overall bulk, and access to Rapid Spin, as well as all three entry hazards, make it a great choice for a support role on nearly any team. Due to the lack of Pokemon able to reliably set them up, Spikes is a massively useful move on Forretress in Ubers. Furthermore, there are a wide range of grounded Pokemon immune to Toxic Spikes, but affected by Spikes, such as Arceus-Steel, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Dialga; this makes Spikes a great move to use on Forretress. Toxic Spikes are the second hazard that Forretress will often use; they can be incredibly dangerous in Ubers due to very threatening Pokemon such as Darkrai, Mewtwo, Blaziken, Palkia, and the majority of Calm Mind Arceus formes (most notably Arceus-Ghost) being put on a timer once poisoned; note, however, that Calm Mind Arceus inflicted with only regular poison can still pull off a sweep. All weather starters are also vulnerable to Toxic Spikes, making them an effective weapon in winning the weather war. With the prevalence of Choice items and Draco Meteor users, Forretress will find plenty of opportunities to set up its hazards. Rapid Spin is where Forretress carves out its biggest niche. Thanks to its great resistances to common Ghost-, Dark-, Ice-, and Dragon-type attacks, it is able to consistently switch in and remove entry hazards, allowing Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Lugia, and Reshiram to come into play without losing huge chunks of their health. Bulky grounded Pokemon such as Groudon, Palkia, most Arceus formes, and Chansey also appreciate Forretress's ability to remove the Toxic Spikes that greatly reduce their staying power.</p> <p>Pain Split, Toxic, and Volt Switch are mainly filler options, but they have their uses. The first allows Forretress to switch into Choice-locked resisted moves more recklessly; and, perhaps more importantly, makes Forretress one of the best Ferrothorn counters in the game. Ferrothorn can only significantly damage Forretress with Iron Barbs and Leech Seed, but with Pain Split Forretress can set up hazards and Rapid Spin on Ferrothorn to its heart's content. Toxic allows Forretress to cripple spinblockers and walls such as Lugia and Ho-Oh, which are immune to Toxic Spikes, and also punishes Arceus formes that might try to set up on Forretress. Finally, Volt Switch lets Forretress act as a scout after it has laid a few entry hazards, and can be useful for maintaining offensive momentum, or even setting up a Pursuit trap on a careless spinblocker.</p> <p>Max HP and Special Defense along with a Special Defense-boosting nature is necessary to make the most of Forretress's relatively low special bulk, as it needs all it can get to take the Draco Meteors and Ice Beams thrown around in Ubers. Leftovers is the item of choice, as the passive recovery helps Forretress to shrug off weak or resisted attacks. Keep in mind, however, that even with full investment, neutral special attacks still take a fair chunk out of Forretress's health, so ensure that you play off of its numerous resistances.</p> <p>A more physically defensive spread (252 HP / 36 Def / 220 SpD with a Bold or a Relaxed nature) can be used with Toxic to check certain physical attackers. This spread ensures that Forretress is never 2HKOed by +1 Outrage from Dragon Dance Rayquaza. However, Forretress will still struggle against even non-Life Orb Extreme Killer Arceus packing Earthquake; as such, a spread of 252 HP / 136 Def / 120 SpD can be used to always avoid the 2HKO from a +2 Adamant Arceus using Earthquake. Life Orb Extreme Killer Arceus still possesses the ability to 2HKO after Stealth Rock with Earthquake almost all the time (guaranteed for Adamant, even without Stealth Rock); at this point, one should just use a fully physically defensive spread. Forretress also struggles with Lum Berry variants of Extreme Killer Arceus, which can absorb one Toxic and will beat Forretress more often than not, even if the Forretress is packing Pain Split.</p> <p>A Ghost-type is a mandatory teammate to block Rapid Spin, which can otherwise waste all of Forretress's hard work; the Giratina formes are probably the best, and both have good synergy with Forretress, though Arceus-Ghost makes a great choice as well. Blissey and Chansey can take most neutral or super effective special attacks directed at Forretress in stride, while supporting the team with Wish or Stealth Rock. In return, Forretress can easily set up on many of the physical attackers that threaten Chansey or Blissey, such as Garchomp and Groudon that lack a Fire-type move. Palkia can switch into many Pokemon that often come in on Forretress, such as Choice Specs Kyogre, Reshiram, Giratina-O, opposing Palkia, and Mewtwo, and threaten them with Thunder or its STAB Dragon-type attacks, and thus makes a great teammate. Sweepers such as most Calm Mind Arceus and Kyogre love having Forretress as a partner to both set up and remove Toxic Spikes. Ho-Oh and Reshiram enjoy Rapid Spin support, and can easily switch into most Fire-type attacks for Forretress; in return, it can tank Dragon-type moves for Reshiram and come in on defensive Groudon without a Fire-type move, which is a constant threat to Ho-Oh. Groudon also forms a potent physically defensive core with Forretress, and can set up Stealth Rock, phaze with Roar or Dragon Tail to rack up entry hazard damage, and scare Dialga off with STAB Earthquake. Kyogre can lessen Forretress's Fire-type weakness thanks to Drizzle and destroy Fire Punch Groudon, Ho-Oh, and select Arceus formes. Zekrom can stop defensive Kyogre and Ho-Oh with its STAB Bolt Strike. Dialga is also a great teammate, as it can come in after Forretress uses Volt Switch on the Giratina formes looking to spinblock, scaring them off and setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Despite the third slot being dedicated to a secondary hazard most of the time, Forretress can employ an additional utility move for fourth slot. Pain Split + Volt Switch allows Forretress to stay healthy and gain momentum. Pain Split + Toxic allows it to check Extreme Killer Arceus. Gyro Ball, Hidden Power Ice, and Payback also have their uses. Gyro Ball provides Forretress with a usably meaty STAB attack, and can hit common switch-ins such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Giratina-O for reasonable damage. It also gets a super effective hit on Kyurem-W, 2HKOing it even without Stealth Rock, although a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor 2HKOs Forretress in return. Hidden Power Ice gives Forretress the ability to counter Gliscor, provided that Forretress is healthy, and a strong attack against Rayquaza and Shaymin-S. Payback can be used to check Latias and Latios, but Forretress can only switch into sets with Dragon Pulse and Grass Knot, as Thunder, Surf or Hidden Power Fire will maul it. However, a +1 Dragon Pulse will 3HKO Forretress from either of the twins, making Forretress a shaky check at best.</p> <p>Stealth Rock can be used over Spikes or Toxic Spikes on more offensive teams lacking another entry hazard supporter. However, in most cases, it's a waste of Forretress's potential, especially considering the range of other Pokemon that can also set up Stealth Rock.</p>"
      },
      "Custap Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Say hello to one of Ubers's finest anti-leads and entry hazard users. The release of Custap Berry is a blessing to any Pokemon with Sturdy thanks to its BW mechanics. Even Deoxys-S, a common suicide lead that seems to outclass Forretress is beaten by this set, getting smacked by Gyro Ball and losing the entry hazards it has worked for thanks to Rapid Spin. Sturdy allows Forretress to tank even a Fire Punch or Hidden Power Fire from Deoxys-S, allowing it to go for the Gyro Ball or lay down some entry hazards if it isn't hit by Taunt. Do note that with the combination of Taunt and a Fire-type move, Deoxys-S will manage to limit this set's usefulness. The combination of Custap Berry and Sturdy is deadly on Forretress because it helps it act like an anti-lead and an entry hazard setter at the same time. This combination allows Forretress to almost always get a minimum of two entry hazards up; once when it's attacked and brought down to Custap Berry activation range, and once when Custap Berry gets activated.</p> <p>The set itself is pretty straightforward. Entry hazards are a blessing for offensive teams, and these are the teams this Forretress fits best on. While slower teams do often enjoy entry hazards, the fast pace of this set makes it a great addition to hyper offensive teams that wish to keep great pressure on their opponent. Rapid Spin is the key to Forretress's anti-hazard role, spinning away the entry hazards the foe worked to get on the field. Gyro Ball hits fairly hard with a Brave nature, 0 Speed IVs, and 252 Attack EVs and is a good emergency tool to take out the likes of weakened Rayquaza, Salamence, Groudon, and more if Custap Berry is in its activation range. You don't need to use Custap Berry immediately; feel free to keep it for emergency uses. Explosion lets Forretress go out with a bang and is capable of OHKOing Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage, along with leaving a huge dent in opponents such as Kyogre, Rayquaza, and Palkia. Explosion can also be used to block a Rapid Spin; in fact, it has a 93.75% chance to OHKO 252/32 Tentacruel after Stealth Rock. Toxic Spikes can be used over Spikes to pressure bulky offensive teams, as those teams do not appreciate the additional damage. However, many teams will find Spikes to be more useful than Toxic Spikes overall.</p> <p>The EV spread and nature guarantee that Forretress's Gyro Ball will hit as hard as possible. 0 IVs in HP, Defense, and Special Defense, allows Forretress to get into Custap Berry activation range very quickly: +1 LO Earthquake from Rayquaza and Earth Plate Groudon cannot achieve a KO and activate Forretress's Custap Berry the following turn. Yet, there are many other options for IV and EV spreads. 0 HP IVs paired with 31 Special Defense IVs ensures that Forretress can take two Modest Ice Beams from Kyogre, Lustrous Orb Palkia will only have 6.25% chance to OHKO with STAB Spacial Rend after Stealth Rock, and two Dark Pulses from Leftovers Darkrai will bring Forretress to Custap Berry activation range without Stealth Rock. 13 HP IVs with 31 Defense IVs ensures that Forretress is only 3HKOed by 4 Attack Groudon's Earthquake. A bulky spread is a viable option if your team needs something to take either physical or special attacks; go for Special Defense investment if you need to tank special hits like Draco Meteor and Ice Beam, and vice versa.</p> <p>This set doesn't have many other options bar Volt Switch, which is a brilliant move option if you wish to scout and catch the opponent's spinblocker or Xatu by surprise. Toxic Spikes should only be used over Spikes; if you use it over Stealth Rock, you get a suicide Pokemon that takes five turns to set up, which is, while somewhat viable, far too many, and if you use it over Gyro Ball or Explosion, Forretress becomes a huge setup fodder and loses versus opposing Deoxys-S.</p> <p>Any Pokemon that can force switches can take great advantage from this set's qualities. Double Dance Groudon is a great partner; with Stealth Rock and Spikes up, it can sweep easily. Toxic Spikes also puts huge pressure on Arceus formes, making it easier for Groudon to sweep. Rayquaza, thanks to its brute force and insane coverage, can also force switches while smacking the incoming switch with a brutal Dragon-type STAB move. Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O are advised as partners, as they are capable of spinblocking, so Forretress's work won't go to waste. They can also beat Giratina and Xatu, which trouble Forretress in doing its job. Choice Scarf Kyogre can drown Arceus-Ghost when healthy and can force many switches, which will become troublesome for the opponent with Forretress's entry hazards. Deoxys-S running Taunt and a Fire-type move and Darkrai are troublesome for this set. Giratina-O can handle Deoxys-S very easily, limiting it to a single entry hazard with its priority STAB Shadow Sneak, and while Darkrai is harder to deal with on offensive teams, a revenge killer, such as Genesect, Kyogre, or Arceus, should do the trick. Genesect is especially good, as it can force switches and scout the opponent's moves, rack up entry hazard damage, and help escape from the leads Forretress cannot beat.</p>"

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<p>Skarmory, one of the best physical walls since GSC, returns in BW to protect its team from Ubers' physical titans: Extreme Killer Arceus, Groudon, Rayquaza, and Excadrill. In fact, the steel bird is the best Swords Dance Arceus counter in general, specifically Extreme Killer Arceus, that exists. With base 140 Defense, reliable recovery in Roost, great defensive typing, and a wide arsenal of support moves such as Spikes, Stealth Rock, Whirlwind, Toxic, and Taunt, Skarmory makes for a great Pokemon to support your team. Skarmory's Sturdy ability allows it to tank and scout hits when at full health, which can prove helpful in some situations such as when facing Choice Scarf Kyogre or Palkia. Skarmory does have its downfalls, though; it is worn down quickly by common special attacks such as Surf and Focus Blast. Weaknesses to Fire- and Electric-type moves also make it prone to Fire Blast and Thunder, two moves that are very common in Ubers. Nevertheless, the armored bird's qualities are by far greater than its frailties, making it a great addition to any team, be it offensive or defensive one.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Skarmory does not have many other options. A spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD can be used, but Skarmory needs all the Special Defense it can get to tank common special moves such as Draco Meteor. A gimmicky Swords Dance + Autotomize set can be used, but it would not work well with Skarmory's poor selection of STAB attacks and mediocre base 80 Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As previously mentioned, Skarmory has a glaring weakness to special attackers due to its mediocre base 70 Special Defense, so Pokemon such as Reshiram, Kyogre, and Palkia make fantastic counters, though they will not enjoy being poisoned. Dialga deserves a special mention as it can switch into everything Skarmory has, including Toxic thanks to its Steel typing, and can OHKO with Fire Blast, or Thunder if it's raining. Thanks to Rayquaza's Air Lock ability, it ignores any weather changes, so it can come into Skarmory and OHKO with Fire Blast or V-create regardless of the weather. Reshiram, with its Turboblaze ability, and Zekrom, with its Teravolt ability, ignore Sturdy's new effect and can OHKO Skarmory with their Fire- and Electric-type STAB moves, respectively. Xatu also shuts down Skarmory with its Magic Bounce ability and access to Roost.</p> <p>Unless Skarmory is using Brave Bird, it is completely shut down by Taunt users such as Mewtwo and Thundurus. Although Gliscor is usually unable to touch Skarmory, in fact Skarmory is often considered to be one of its most reliable counters, when running Taunt Gliscor can easily stop Skarmory from doing anything, and can even set up a Substitute on it. Calm Mind Arceus can set up on Skarmory, but unless they carry Refresh, they fear Toxic and do not enjoy being phazed. Ho-Oh can easily OHKO Skarmory with its signature move, Sacred Fire, if it's not raining, but it does not enjoy being phazed if Stealth Rock is present. Giratina-O can OHKO with Thunder in the rain and Hidden Power Fire in the sun, but like many others, it does not enjoy being poisoned. Choice Band Terrakion can easily 2HKO Skarmory with Close Combat, whereas the Swords Dance variant can attempt to set up, but it takes 54.32% - 64.19% from Brave Bird at -1 Defense, making it a shaky check. Groudon with a Fire-type move, such as Fire Punch, Fire Blast, or Overheat, can land a surprise kill on Skarmory thanks to the sun it summons.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Spikes-stacking is an extremely dangerous playstyle in Ubers because it's very hard to Rapid Spin with bulky Ghost-types lurking everywhere--Arceus-Ghost and the Giratina formes. Skarmory is one of the lucky Pokemon to get access to Spikes, which can easily wear down the opponent, and, thanks to its excellent defensive typing, it can often lay down several layers in one game. With the ability to phaze with Whirlwind, Skarmory can easily stack more and more residual damage on the opposing Pokemon, eventually KOing them unless they have a recovery move. Roost provides reliable recovery, and it grants Skarmory the ability to take on a few, even boosted, physical hits with its base 140 Defense; this also makes it the best Extreme Killer Arceus counter you can find. Toxic is the preferred option in the last slot, as without it, Skarmory will not be able to stop Extreme Killer Arceus one-on-one. Toxic is also a great move against common switch-ins to Skarmory such as Kyogre, Palkia, Reshiram, and setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Arceus, as none of them appreciate Toxic. Taunt stops Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Forretress from freely setting up entry hazards on Skarmory, whereas Brave Bird lets Skarmory attack in case it has been Taunted itself.</p> <p>The EV spread and nature ensure that Skarmory will not be 2HKOed by a +2 Life Orb Extreme Killer Arceus's Brick Break if it hasn't taken Stealth Rock damage, while still retaining great special bulk. Moreover, Dialga with 56 Special Attack EVs has a very small chance of OHKOing Skarmory with Draco Meteor followed by Fire Blast (if both roll max damage, it does 103.91% factoring Stealth Rock damage). Here are a few damage calculations that demonstrate Skarmory's great bulk:</p> <ul> <li>+2 Life Orb 252 Atk+ Normal Arceus Brick Break 44.61% - 52.69%</li> <li>56 SpA Dialga Draco Meteor 36.22% - 42.81</li> <li>-2 56 SpA Dialga Fire Blast 41.31% - 49.1%</li> <li>4 Atk Groudon Stone Edge 20.95% - 24.55%</li> <li>252 Atk Rayquaza Outrage 43.11% - 50.89%</li> <li>252 Atk Salamence Outrage 30.53% - 36.22%</li> <li>252 SpA Palkia Draco Meteor 37.72% - 44.31%</li> <li>+1 0 Atk Dialga Outrage 22.75% - 26.94%</li> </ul> <p>If you wish to ensure Skarmory's victory against Extreme Killer Arceus, an EV spread of 252 HP / 184 Def / 72 SpD can be used. With this spread, Skarmory will never be 2HKOed by a +2 Life Orb Brick Break from Adamant Arceus with 252 Attack EVs even after Stealth Rock damage. If your team lacks Stealth Rock, it can be used over Spikes, but Spikes is generally a much better option as Skarmory is one of the few Pokemon that learn it, unlike Stealth Rock. Red Card can be used to take advantage of Skarmory's Sturdy ability, as it will allow Skarmory to stack more entry hazard damage on the opponent.</p> <p>Kyogre is a remarkable teammate; the rain it provides thanks to Drizzle nullifies Skarmory's weakness to Fire-type attacks, and the Spikes support Skarmory provides allows Kyogre to get past its usual counters, such as Palkia. Gastrodon synergizes perfectly with Skarmory, as it is immune to Electric-type attacks and resists Fire-type attacks, whereas Skarmory 4x resists Grass-type attacks. Moreover, Gastrodon can easily sponge the special attacks aimed at Skarmory and vice versa. Chansey and Blissey play similar roles to Gastrodon. They do not resist Fire- or Electric-type attacks, but their huge base Special Defense and HP allow them to easily sponge Fire Blasts and Thunders. In addition to this, they can cure Skarmory from status effects with Heal Bell and can pass enormous Wishes to Skarmory and its teammates. The Giratina formes also make fantastic partners, as they too synergize perfectly with Skarmory, and their spinblocking qualities ensure Skarmory's Spikes-stacking won't go to waste. A Ground-type Pokemon to switch into Thunder is advised, making Excadrill, Arceus-Ground, Garchomp, and the aforementioned Gastrodon great teammates. Excadrill can also provide Rapid Spin support, allowing Skarmory to avoid the 2HKO from Extreme Killer Arceus and Dialga.</p>"

      "Custap Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Skarmory is a staple of bulky entry hazard setters. However, when Skarmory takes a more offensive turn by becoming a suicide lead, it performs just as well. It has many qualities that other entry hazard Pokemon lack: great defensive typing, fantastic bulk, and an awesome support arsenal. Even without any investment in physical defense, Skarmory is still as bulky as ever: +0 252+ Life Orb Rayquaza's Outrage and +2 252+ Life Orb Extreme Killer Arceus aren't a 2HKO, allowing you to phaze them away, racking up entry hazard damage. Yet, if someone is trying to overpower Skarmory with special attacks or repeated physical hits, have no fear—the combination of Sturdy and Custap Berry will almost always guarantee you another move.</p> <p>This set is pretty self-explanatory. Stealth Rock and Spikes are a phenomenal way to apply pressure and support your team. Skarmory's base 70 Speed and the Speed EVs allow it to outspeed other common Pokemon such as Groudon and Dialga, which are now prevented from laying their own Stealth Rock by Skarmory's Taunt, which also prevents status inflictions. Whirlwind is a great method of stacking up entry hazard damage, also stopping Pokemon such as Arceus-Ghost, Rayquaza, and Groudon from setting up on Skarmory.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Skarmory to be as fast as possible in order to prevent opposing entry hazards and lay its own while still being somewhat bulky. Lowering HP and Defense IVs and EVs is an option if you wish to get into Custap Berry range much faster. This Skarmory has two advantages over Forretress in Whirlwind and Taunt, which completely stop setup Pokemon from doing their job. This set can use Lum Berry to set up in front of Darkrai and Smeargle, or Mental Herb to mess around with faster Taunt users, such as Deoxys-S. You can also use Brave Bird over Whirlwind as a damage inflicting move, which can also result in a spinblock by fainting to recoil damage or KOing the foe's spinner.</p> <p>Powerful Pokemon that can cause many switches are the best partners for this Skarmory, as they simply enjoy the additional damage caused by entry hazards. Ho-Oh, Palkia, Kyogre, Kyurem-W, Reshiram, Zekrom, and Rayquaza all come into account. Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O beat Xatu, which walls this set completely and makes it useless, while also spinblocking so Skarmory's work won't go to waste. Faster Taunt Pokemon, such as Prankster Sableye and Tornadus, also render this set useless, unless using Mental Herb. Thus, a Pokemon to deal with those two is advised, such as Ho-Oh or Thundurus.</p> <p>This set cannot stop Rapid Spin users from fulfilling their job, unfortunately. Thus, something to handle those reliably is advised; Giratina-O or Arceus-Ghost come to mind, as they can cause many switches with Dragon Tail or huge force. Both can also beat Deoxys-S, which is troublesome for this set, unless running Mental Herb. Darkrai is also a pain, as Skarmory cannot do much to defeat it. Genesect can leave a huge dent in Darkrai with its STAB U-turn, and Mewtwo, while not a reliable switch-in at all, can OHKO Darkrai with a single Aura Sphere.</p> <p>Do note that Sturdy is a key part of this team's success, and that this set will not do as well against defensive teams as it does against offensive ones. Thus, this set should only be used on offensive teams over other entry hazard setters when looking for an emergency Extreme Killer Arceus check and a Steel-type they could use.</p>"

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>Though Kingdra is usually seen as a bulky boosting sweeper in UU, it can actually be quite the threat in Ubers. With Kyogre's Drizzle summoning infinite rain, Kingdra will frequently receive doubled Speed from Swift Swim. Its two STABs are great offensively, as they are only resisted by Empoleon, Shedinja, and Ferrothorn. Despite Kingdra's shallow movepool and the fact that it received zero viable new moves in the new generation, its movepool has everything it needs.</p> <p>However, Ubers is riddled with Dragon-types, so it might be hard for Kingdra to find a team slot. Most Dragon-types in Ubers have ridiculous attacking stats, while Kingdra only has base 95 in both Attack and Special Attack. Even so, Kingdra's Speed is what sets it apart from the other Dragon-types. In addition, it has a resistance to Bullet Punch and a neutrality to Stealth Rock, two things that Rayquaza wished it had. The boost that Kyogre's Drizzle provides for Kingdra's Water-type attacks also somewhat remedies Kingdra's middling Attack and Special Attack. Dragon Dance further improves Kingdra's Attack, and allows it to outspeed everything in Ubers. If you have a rain-centralized team, definitely consider Kingdra for a team slot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kingdra really does not have much to work with outside of the moves listed on the above sets. It has access to Yawn, and in conjunction with Substitute, can allow Kingdra to set up a Dragon Dance or two. Unfortunately, it would limit Kingdra to choose between two attack: Outrage and Waterfall, with Groudon or Palkia walling it, respectively. Kingdra also gets Scald, but its Base Power is inferior to both Surf and Hydro Pump, and Kingdra needs to inflict as much damage as possible while it is on the field. It can use a set consisting of Substitute and a pinch Berry, but the immediate power that Life Orb provides is generally better. Dragon Pulse can be used over Draco Meteor if accuracy is a concern, but the Dragon Dance set would require much more investment in Special Attack in order to supply sufficient power. Ice Beam 2HKOes Groudon and OHKOes Shaymin-S without Stealth Rock damage, but Draco Meteor gets better neutral coverage. Toxic can be used to cripple walls that lack status-clearing moves, but Kingdra is geared more toward offense, not support. If Choice Scarf Shaymin-S is not a concern, 40 Speed EVs can be shifted to either Attack or Special Attack, while still allowing Kingdra to beat up to and including Choice Scarf Terrakion. If Terrakion is also not a concern, 40 more EVs can be removed so Kingdra will still outpace threats up to and including Choice Scarf Palkia.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Kingdra is one hard nut to crack if rain is on the field. In the rain, Arceus can sponge an unboosted Waterfall and 2HKO Kingdra with Extreme Speed. Shedinja is immune to Water and Dragon and can outstall Kingdra with either Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. Groudon ends Kyogre's rain via Drought, weakening Kingdra's Water-type attacks, is almost never 2HKOed by a +1 Outrage if carrying Leftovers, and can paralyze Kingdra with Thunder Wave or KO it outright with Earthquake. Ferrothorn, though, is a complete counter to Kingdra, provided that it hasn't already used Dragon Dance three or more times. Ferrothorn can easily sap Kingdra's health with Leech Seed, and then proceed to set up Spikes and/or Stealth Rock while Kingdra loses health to Life Orb recoil and Leech Seed each turn. In the rain, Ferrothorn becomes even more annoying since its Fire-type weakness is somewhat mitigated. Lugia is bulky enough to stave off Outrage, and can stall out Kingdra's health with Roost or Recover. It can also phaze away all of Kingdra's boosts courtesy of Whirlwind.</p> <p>The best way to KO Kingdra is to take it out of its element--rain. Without the Speed boost, Kingdra becomes much easier to remove from the battle. Rayquaza's Air Lock does this well and Rayquaza can easily OHKO Kingdra with a Dragon-type attack. Outside of rain, Choice Scarf Shaymin-S outspeeds Kingdra and can flinch it to death with Air Slash, or go immediately for the jugular with Seed Flare or Leaf Storm after Stealth Rock or Life Orb recoil.</p>",

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Despite the fact that Kingdra has less than base 100 in both of its attacking stats, it can still function as a very competent mixed sweeper. Because of Swift Swim and the infinite rain that Kyogre provides, Kingdra will also be a great revenge killer. With a neutral nature and maximum investment, Kingdra hits a dangerous 590 Speed, easily outpacing all of the unboosted Pokemon in the metagame. Surf is the preferred option over Hydro Pump after considering Hydro Pump's imperfect accuracy and Surf has more than sufficient power under rain. Waterfall is Kingdra's physical STAB attack, and for good reason. It has a good chance of 2HKOing Blissey in the rain, and is guaranteed to 2HKO with Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes. It will also always 2HKO Choice Band Tyranitar in sandstorm, a major threat to almost every rain team. Outrage will do tons of damage to any Pokemon that does not have either a huge Defense stat or a resistance to Dragon-type attacks. Even without Dragon Dance to boost its Attack, Kingdra can still do a good amount of damage to most Pokemon. Finally, Draco Meteor is Kingdra's strongest attack, capable of OHKOing many Pokemon. There is a great chance that Kingdra will OHKO Choice Scarf Shaymin-S with Draco Meteor, an achievement that can be guaranteed with the help of Stealth Rock. Darkrai is also OHKOed, but Surf will do more damage because of the pseudo-double STAB that the rain provides.</p> <p>Despite the sheer immediate power this Kingdra brings to the table, it still has no way of stopping Ferrothorn. Furthermore, because Kyogre is an absolutely necessary partner to Kingdra in order for it to function properly, and the rain Kyogre summons will only make taking out Ferrothorn harder. Shaymin-S has a powerful Air Slash which can flinch Ferrothorn to death, but should the move miss or fail to flinch, Shaymin-S will most likely be taking a Thunder Wave. Since this Kingdra has no method of attaining additional boosts outside of Baton Pass, it is easily countered outside of rain. Rayquaza, though unable to switch in on Kingdra's Outrage and Draco Meteor, can OHKO Kingdra with one of its own Dragon-type STABs. Choice Scarf Jirachi is an invaluable partner to deal with Rayquaza. Not only does it resist Rayquaza's STAB attacks and Extreme Speed, but it also KOes with Ice Punch and outspeeds all variants at +1 Speed, so it will not have to fear Earthquake or Fire Blast. If Choice Scarf Mewtwo is a concern, Wobbuffet can come in and revenge kill it with ease.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Even in the fast-paced Ubers metagame, Kingdra won't have much trouble setting up a Dragon Dance. Although, at first glance, Kingdra might seem to be outclassed by Dragon Dance Rayquaza and its much higher attacking stats, Kingdra has some notable advantages over the green dragon. The first is Kingdra's superior typing, which leaves it with only one weakness in comparison to Rayquaza's three. Next is Kingdra's Speed in the rain, which can allow it to outspeed enemies as fast as Choice Scarf Shaymin-S even without any Dragon Dance boosts. After one Dragon Dance, Kingdra can effectively outspeed the entire Ubers metagame.</p> <p>Waterfall should be Kingdra's primary attack, and with a boost from rain, it will become just as strong as its Outrage, the preferred attack in clear skies or other weather. The typing combination of Dragon and Water is almost unstoppable, with Ferrothorn being the only common Pokemon in Ubers resisting it. Because of Kingdra's blistering Speed, even before any boosts, it can also function as a competent revenge killer. Even though Kingdra will never be able to deal as much damage as Rayquaza can, the high Base Power and awesome coverage of its attacks add to create fearsome offensive abilities. Draco Meteor is just as important as Kingdra's physical attacks, since without it, Kingdra would have to rely on Outrage in order to KO Shaymin-S and other threats. With Draco Meteor, Kingdra can 2HKO Groudon and Dialga sets without heavy Special Defense investment with a combination of Draco Meteor followed by Outrage. After Stealth Rock damage, Draco Meteor also has the power to smash through and OHKO some Dragon-types, such as Palkia and Rayquaza, without having to lock itself into Outrage. Yawn is an interesting option over Draco Meteor, as it will allow Kingdra to more easily attain Dragon Dances, while still allowing Kingdra to have maximum coverage.</p> <p>Ferrothorn is a surefire counter to this set in every possible way. It has monstrous defenses and its typing allows it to resist all of Kingdra's STAB attacks. Furthermore, Ferrothorn can easily set up on Kingdra with Spikes, cripple it with Thunder Wave (though Kingdra will still move first because of Ferrothorn's lackluster Speed), sap its health via Leech Seed, or smack it with its STAB Power Whip. Because Kingdra should only be used with rain on the field, Fire-type attacks will have less of an effect on Ferrothorn. For that reason, Aura Sphere or Focus Blast users are great teammates. Dialga resists both of Ferrothorn's STABs, doesn't mind a Thunder Wave, and easily 2HKOes Ferrothorn with Aura Sphere. Mewtwo and Darkrai can OHKO Ferrothorn with Aura Sphere and Focus Blast, respectively, but they both need to be on the lookout for Thunder Wave. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S is another good teammate as it can attract Fire-type attacks, to which Kingdra has a 8x resist in the rain (though Kingdra should definitely be wary of switching into Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire because of its 50% chance of inflicting burn).</p> <p>The EVs on this set will allow Kingdra to outspeed all variants of Choice Scarf Shaymin-S while still allowing Kingdra to OHKO said Shaymin-S with Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock. Because Lugia is a common switch-in to Kingdra, Tickle Wobbuffet is an invaluable teammate. With a Pursuit user such as Scizor also on the team, all Lugia lacking Whirlwind don't even stand a chance of surviving. This can pave the way for a Kingdra sweep later on in the match, provided that Kingdra hasn't already sustained a lot of damage. Again, both Mewtwo and Darkrai are great partners, this time because they are quite adept at switching in and setting up on Lugia.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Simple and effective, this set is nothing short of devastating in the right hands. While Kingdra may seem outclassed by Kyogre and Palkia as a pure Special Attacking Water-type, Kingdra carves its own niche thanks to its ridiculous 538 Speed in the rain. While a base 95 Special Attack may seem low by Ubers standards, with the Choice Specs boost, Kingdra reaches 475 Special Attack, usable enough to break down many defensive Pokemon and clean up weakened teams. While the Life Orb set may seem like a better late-game cleaner, Choice Specs powers up Kingdra enough for it to actually be threatening in the early- and mid-game too, allowing it to be a revenge killer, semi-wall breaker, and sweeper all in one. While the Life Orb set eases prediction through freedom of moves, this set eases prediction through sheer power. In such an entry hazard-rich metagame as Ubers, any attempt to minimize residual damage is welcome. The moveset is as simple as it can get. When you have a Pokemon with Kingdra's Speed and two STAB coverage, the simplest set is generally the best. While it may seem redundant to carry two moves of both STAB types, the moves themselves serve different roles. Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump are used to break apart bulkier Pokemon in the early- and mid-game, while Dragon Pulse and Surf allow Kingdra to clean up in the late-game. Kingdra hardly needs anything else, although Ice Beam can go over one of Dragon Pulse or Surf to 2HKO Arceus-Grass, which is usually very problematic for rain teams.</p> <p>The EVs are extremely self-explanatory. Max Special Attack and a Modest nature are used for maximum power, while max Speed allows Kingdra to outspeed as many things as possible. Kingdra, unlike other weather dependent speed demons such as Kabutops and Venusaur, actually outspeeds Choice Scarf Terrakion without having to use a +Speed nature. However, if you are really paranoid, a Timid nature is always an option to outspeed Choice Scarf Darkrai and Shaymin-S, as well as Jolly Kabutops and +2 Blaziken. However, be aware that, without a Modest nature, there is a significant power drop. In terms of other move options, Hidden Power Fire is generally not a very good idea, since Hydro Pump in the rain does pretty much the same amount of damage to Ferrothorn anyway, although it does have some merit for being able to hit Ferrothorn a lot harder if it's sunny. Toxic can be used over one of Dragon Pulse or Surf to cripple potential Lugia and Arceus-Grass switch-ins.</p> <p>Kyogre is easily Kingdra's most important teammate. Without its eternal rain, Kingdra would just be an inferior Palkia in every way. Conversely, Kingdra's number one enemy is definitely Ferrothorn. For Kingdra to function effectively, you should be prudent to at least land around 40% damage onto the steel plant before trying to take it down with Kingdra. Fortunately, Ferrothorn is relatively easy to whittle away at, since it lacks reliable recovery outside of Leech Seed and is a common switch-in to many Uber threats. Pokemon such as Hone Claws mixed Kyurem-B, Choice Band Zekrom, Choice Specs Kyogre, and Palkia are all good teammates to lure in Ferrothorn and do enough to it that Kingdra can push through later in the game. Luring out other weather inducers is also extremely beneficial. Bulk Up mixed Dialga is an excellent lure for all weather inducers that threaten to take rain away. It can smash Groudon and Hippowdon with Draco Meteor, and break through Tyranitar and the rare Abomasnow with Aura Sphere, a boosted Brick Break, or Outrage. Mixed Zekrom is also relatively good at wiping Groudon and Hippowdon off the map, as is Hone Claws mixed Kyurem-B.</p> <p>Other Pokemon that give Kingdra trouble are Arceus-Grass, specially defensive Arceus-Water, Blissey and Chansey, specially defensive Kyogre, and Rayquaza. The first five Pokemon can take hits from Kingdra all day and reply with status; Rayquaza outspeeds Kingdra due to Air Lock and KOes it with its STAB Dragon-type attacks. Defensive Dialga is a good check to the first five defensive Pokemon, as it does not mind paralysis and can easily set up Stealth Rock and force switches with Roar. Bulk Up RestTalk Dialga can also use them as set up fodder. As for Rayquaza, Lugia and defensive Arceus are excellent all-round switch-ins. Otherwise, Choice Scarf Terrakion and Jirachi can revenge kill all variants of Rayquaza, while Choice Scarf Garchomp, Salamence, and Palkia can take out Dragon Dance variants.</p> <p>Apart from Rayquaza, even with Kingdra's fantastic Speed, it can still be revenge killed. Choice Scarf Darkrai and Shaymin-S, as well as Jolly Kabutops and Kingdra, can outspeed Modest Kingdra, while Choice Scarf Mewtwo can outspeed even Timid variants. An Arceus-Grass of your own can easily deal with Kabutops and Kingdra, as well as bulky Dialga and Lugia. As for the Choice Scarf users, Choice Band Scizor or Choice Scarf Jirachi are decent options to deal with all three, especially since Darkrai and Mewtwo can potentially cripple walls with Trick. Apart from Rayquaza, other users of Extreme Speed can also revenge kill Kingdra after prior damage. These include Extreme Killer Arceus and Deoxys-A. A bulky Steel-type such as Skarmory can easily take on Arceus, while Deoxys-A can be easily revenge killed by Giratina-O, Scizor, Choice Scarf Dialga, Jirachi, Terrakion, and Genesect, all of which can take an Extreme Speed without much trouble.</p>"

  "Smeargle": {
    "overview": "<p>Smeargle has always been a unique Pokemon that fills specific niches, and it does this in every tier, including Ubers. Its expansive movepool, consisting of almost every single move in the game, allows it to do things in ways no other Pokemon can do. Its range of options might be comparatively limited in Ubers, but Smeargle can still be a game-changing element when used correctly. Its most fearsome trait is undoubtedly its ability to use Baton Pass in conjunction with Shell Smash, but there are other niches that it can fill too.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although Smeargle has literally every move in the game at its fingertips, the nature of the Ubers metagame doesn't leave it with too many options. Entry hazards are among its usable options, as Smeargle can set up Stealth Rock, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes. Unfortunately Smeargle is outclassed completely at this role by Deoxys-S. Rapid Spin is also an option if a moveslot is available, but since Smeargle can't touch Giratina-O at all outside of Spore, it is not really worth using. Support moves such as Thunder Wave, Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, Tailwind, and Haze are all possible options, but these are only usable in specific situations, and the status moves conflict with Spore.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The key to beating Smeargle is preventing it from putting something to sleep and breaking its Focus Sash before it can do any harm. Entry hazards render Focus Sash useless, making Smeargle a much easier target to deal with. Priority helps to deal with it as well. For example, if Sleep Clause has been activated and Smeargle has already been brought to 1 HP, Arceus can switch in on Shell Smash or Trick Room and kill Smeargle before it can use Baton Pass or Endeavor, respectively. Pokemon with moves that hit multiple times are rare in Ubers, but the few that are used, such as Dual Chop Garchomp, make short work of Smeargle. Pokemon using Rest and Sleep Talk also have a much easier time with Smeargle, especially if they also have a phazing move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SmashPass": {
        "description": "<p>Baton Passing has long been regarded as Smeargle's signature role, and it pulls off its specialty with aplomb in Ubers. The raw power of the Ubers metagame makes Baton Pass chains difficult to use and rather impractical, but this generation Smeargle has a new toy that takes advantage of that same raw power: Shell Smash. With a Focus Sash equipped, Smeargle is nearly guaranteed to get off a Shell Smash safely, especially with the aid of the much-coveted Spore, which is what sets it apart from Baton Pass Gorebyss. Putting a slower opponent to sleep, such as support Groudon, allows Smeargle to boost up with its Focus Sash still intact, giving you complete control. It is highly recommended in most cases to use Shell Smash before Spore, as this makes dealing with Smeargle far more difficult. Magic Coat is useful for its ability to turn Roar, Whirlwind, and Taunt back on the user, also allowing Smeargle to \"steal\" entry hazards from the opponent; this makes the Baton Pass recipient even more difficult to stop. Ingrain blocks phazing attempts altogether and also provides recovery for the recipient, making wearing down the recipient a daunting task. Taunt is also usable, and while it is not as effective as Magic Coat, it does require less prediction to use.</p> <p>A Jolly nature and full investment in Speed are vital for Smeargle, as they allow it to outspeed a larger range of opponents, something that is crucial for its role. Because Ubers is an incredibly powerful metagame, there are very few moves Smeargle can survive, should its Focus Sash be broken before it has an opportunity to use Shell Smash. The remaining EVs are all placed in Defense, allowing Smeargle to survive Giratina-O's Dragon Tail even after switching into Stealth Rock or Spikes. It should be noted that if keeping the opponents' entry hazards out of play is not feasible, Smeargle should be led with or brought in on the turn that the opponent uses an entry hazard move, allowing it to keep its Focus Sash intact. Keep in mind that the latter scenario is extremely risky.</p> <p>Teammates should be the most important concern when using Smeargle. Pokemon that can make great use of the boosts they receive, such as mixed Dialga or Zekrom, are the best partners for this set. Priority moves, especially Extreme Speed, are the biggest danger to the recipients, so recipients that shrug off most forms of priority, notably Dialga and Giratina-O, are the most difficult to take down. The immunity to Toxic Spikes both have is also an excellent asset. The defense drops of Shell Smash are a hazard for recipients, so having them hold a White Herb is an option, although the raw power of a Life Orb is usually better for Pokemon that do not fear priority. If the opponent lacks priority, then powerful, frail Pokemon such as Mewtwo and Rayquaza make deadly recipients. Quiver Dance and Tail Glow are also excellent moves to pass to powerful special attackers such as Kyogre. Belly Drum is another option, but Smeargle is too slow to safely use the move, and Belly Drum's cost renders the Focus Sash useless, making it impractical.</p>"
      },
      "Lv. 1 FEAR": {
        "description": "<p>Although Lv. 1 Solosis fills this niche better in most ways due to Magic Guard, Smeargle's access to Spore is all it needs to make it a viable alternative. This set's primary aim is to get up Trick Room, and then if possible take something down with it. Spore nearly guarantees a free use of either Trick Room or Endeavor, depending on when it is used. Endeavor does an excellent job at crippling opponents even when Smeargle is at full health, as its HP at Lv. 1 is so low that most Pokemon commonly used in Ubers will die to residual damage when left with that amount. Dragon Rage can be used to finish off any Pokemon that has been hit by Endeavor, but Destiny Bond almost guarantees a kill, and is Smeargle's only option against Giratina-O.</p> <p>This set can only really work on a full Trick Room team, and Smeargle's teammates should be capable of abusing Trick Room; common Trick Room users such as Dialga and Palkia are thus highly recommended. Toxic Spikes support can help Smeargle nab kills with Endeavor, but poisoned opponents aren't affected by Spore, making this a risky option. Extreme Speed is also an option in the last moveslot. In the unlikely situation that Smeargle has used Endeavor on the last turn of Trick Room, Extreme Speed can be used to finish off the opponent, assuming it isn't carrying Leftovers. This set absolutely hates entry hazards, so unless Rapid Spin support is provided it is best to use it as the team's lead.</p>"

  "Blissey": {
    "overview": "<p>Blissey returns for yet another round in the Uber tier as the premier special wall. No Pokemon does Blissey's job better, with the possible exception of her sister Chansey. Few special attackers can break through Blissey thanks to her titanic Special Defense and HP stats. Almost any team, particularly stall teams, will appreciate Blissey's ability to sponge assaults. While Chansey gives stiff competition with better bulk, Blissey's consistent passive recovery allows her to switch in and out of battle without using Wish or Soft-Boiled as often. Thanks to Leftovers recovery, Blissey can take weaker hits such as Dialga's Dragon Pulse better than Chansey can. As a bonus, Blissey can even surprise opponents with her underwhelming but workable Special Attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blissey's movepool is extremely extensive, and while its most effective moveset is the one listed above, there are a couple moves that have niche uses in Ubers. Calm Mind lets her beat Giratina-O, Manaphy, and Kyogre in a Calm Mind war, but requires Blissey to use special attacks and sacrifices much of her utility. Light Screen seems odd on Blissey, but prevents Choice Specs Kyogre from 2HKOing with Water Spout. Sing can put an opponent's Blissey counter to sleep, but its shaky accuracy makes it less than desirable. Rest is usually inferior to Wish and Soft-Boiled, but can prove useful against opposing Blissey or teams with Toxic Spikes. Block can be used alongside Toxic to trap and eliminate Wobbuffet. Copycat may seem like a strange option on Blissey, but it can be useful against opponents such as Forretress, as it allows Blissey to potentially copy Spikes, Toxic Spikes, or even Rapid Spin. Gravity also has some niche use in Ubers, as many Pokemon in Ubers rely on moves with unreliable accuracy, especially Darkrai with its 80% accurate Dark Void and 70% accurate Focus Blast. It can also allow Garchomp and Groudon to abuse their powerful STAB Earthquakes more effectively.</p> <p>Blissey also has a couple options to make herself a little more threatening to opposing teams. With sun support from Groudon, Blissey can use Flamethrower to ward off Steel-types looking to abuse their immunity to Toxic. Flamethrower in the sun OHKOes Forretress, Ferrothorn, and most Scizor, nearly OHKOes Lucario, and 2HKOes Metagross factoring in Stealth Rock. Grass Knot hits Groudon, a common switch-in to Blissey, and also hits many other Ubers with 120 Base Power. Finally, Counter can be used to catch physical attackers off-guard. Blissey has a surprisingly large amount of physical bulk, and if she Counters a weak physical attack from foes such as Palkia, Dialga, defensive Groudon, Choice Scarf Garchomp, or even Scizor wthout Superpower, it's sure to take them out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulk Up Dialga is arguably the best Blissey counter. Dialga is immune to Toxic, and can easily set up on Blissey. Powerful physical attackers, such as Groudon, Zekrom, Rayquaza, and Garchomp, can make Blissey's life hard. However, Ice Beam will do massive damage to Garchomp and Rayquaza, and none of them like being hit by Toxic. Ho-Oh can easily come in on anything barring Toxic, and set up 101 HP Substitutes for blocking Blissey's Toxic and taking Seismic Toss twice. From there, Sacred Fire or Brave Bird can easily end Blissey's life. However, take note that Brave Bird recoil will be massive when hitting Blissey due to her enormous HP.</p> <p>Mixed Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina-O can surprise Blissey with physical attacks. Dialga in particular can be a problem, as it is immune to Toxic. Giratina-O can avoid Toxic with Substitute, and set up on Blissey with Calm Mind. Outrage from mixed Giratina-O can easily 2HKO Blissey. Mewtwo can easily OHKO Blissey with a boosted Psystrike. If Darkrai can get a Nasty Plot boost, it will 2HKO Blissey with Focus Blast.</p> <p>Kyogre and Giratina can use a combination of Sleep Talk, Rest, and Calm Mind to easily set up on Blissey. In the rain, Manaphy can easily set up Tail Glow on non-Calm Mind Blissey and 2HKO it with a +3 Surf. Choice Specs Kyogre and Reshiram also have the ability to 2HKO Blissey with Water Spout or Blue Flare (which requires sun support). Arceus-Steel and Arceus-Poison can set up on Blissey easily due to their immunity to Toxic and access to recovery moves. Any Arceus set with Refresh can easily use Blissey as setup bait. Arceus-Ground and Extreme Killer Arceus can OHKO Blissey with a +2 Earthquake or Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Wobbuffet can switch into Blissey and use Tickle several times to lower her Defense. After this, Blissey will be KOed by Pursuit from Scizor or Tyranitar. Wobbuffet can also use Encore on Blissey and switch in a sweeper such as Mewtwo or Giratina-O to take advantage of the free setup time. Ferrothorn has Leech Seed, which allows it to easily out-heal Seismic Toss from Blissey, and Iron Barbs, which damages Blissey every time it uses Seismic Toss on Ferrothorn. Meanwhile, Ferrothorn is free to either set up Spikes or hit it hard with Power Whip. Skarmory can also set up Spikes on it for free, and it also has Roost to shrug off repeated Seismic Tosses.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Blissey is the only Pokemon in Ubers other than Chansey who can wall such a wide variety of special threats such as Palkia, most variants of Dialga and Kyogre, non-Specs Reshiram, most Calm Mind Arceus, and Lugia. Seismic Toss is generally the most reliable attacking move, as it dents bulky Pokemon and offensive Calm Mind Kyogre, who will otherwise laugh at Blissey's pathetic attacks. Ice Beam is still a viable move, as some common Blissey switch-ins, such as Groudon, Zekrom, Garchomp, and Rayquaza, hate it. Toxic complements this set well, as the combination of Protect and Wish can very easily stall Pokemon to death. Toxic can also be used to cripple several threats, such as Kyogre, Darkrai, and Giratina-O, on the switch-in. Snatch can be used to steal support moves from the likes of Arceus, and allows Blissey to beat Calm Mind Arceus-Dark, a deadly threat to stall, by poisoning it with Toxic and then preventing Arceus from using Refresh with Snatch. Heal Bell can be used over Protect if your team needs a Wish passer as well as a cleric. Heal Bell also saves Blissey from opposing Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>While Leftovers is generally the preferred option, Shed Shell is still a viable alternative because of Wobbuffet, who can trap Blissey and eliminate it using a combination of Tickle and Encore when paired with a Pursuit user.</p> <p>Blissey is the best Wish passer in the Uber tier, and it is a good teammate for Pokemon that appreciate Wish. Defensive Groudon in particular enjoys Wish support since it lacks a recovery move. A few other Pokemon, such as Choice Specs Kyogre and Forretress, also love Blissey's Wish passing capabilities. Palkia pairs up quite well with Blissey, and can KO most Pokemon capable of threatening her, such as Choice Specs Kyogre and Reshiram. Most physically bulky Pokemon, such as Groudon, Ferrothorn, Lugia, and Skarmory, can act as good teammates. Forretress deserves a special mention thanks to its ability to set up all types of entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes. Two layers of Toxic Spikes on the field makes Blissey's job much easier, allowing her to stall out opposing Pokemon with aplomb.</p> <p>Blissey can act as a good counter to specially-oriented Scarf users such as Palkia and Reshiram. With her huge special bulk, Blissey will have no problem sponging special moves and healing with Soft-Boiled. However, one needs to be a wee bit cautious, since Scarf users such as Palkia often carry physical moves to destroy a weakened Blissey. Since most wallbreakers laugh at Blissey, make sure to pack checks for them lest they are able to stop Blissey. Choice Specs Kyogre can easily deal with both Heatran and Giratina-O, two common Ubers wallbreakers, thanks to its incredibly powerful Water Spout, which easily OHKOes Heatran and has a small chance of KOing Giratina-O factoring in Stealth Rock damage.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>As it frequently tops the OU usage lists, it is inconceivable that Tyranitar has not considered taking over the forbidden land of Ubers as well. Indeed, while the bipartisan dictatorship of Groudon and Kyogre persecute other weather effects from coming into play, the sand tyrant stands defiant, ready to introduce sandstorm to the world of Mount Olympus. Its ability, Sand Stream, allows Tyranitar to become an extremely sturdy special tank in the Uber metagame, a tier full of special attackers. It isn't indestructible by any means, however, as Tyranitar sports nasty weaknesses to the ubiquitous Aura Sphere and Earthquake. Overall, Tyranitar is an extremely versatile Pokemon, and every team that dreams of being successful should have an answer to the dinosaur.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Slide is a more reliable option over Stone Edge, but it is way too weak to do anything useful. Dragon Dance and Rock Polish can be used to improve Tyranitar's horrible Speed, but it would still be too slow after one boost, while it will find itself being walled way too easily. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple an Arceus forme or two, but since Tyranitar's main counter, Groudon, is immune to it, it is quite useless. Toxic can be used to cripple Groudon. Dragon Tail or Roar can be used on the tank set in conjunction with entry hazards for some decent results. Curse can be used to boost Tyranitar's Defense, giving it excellent mixed bulk, but Groudon and other counters can KO Tyranitar faster than it can boost.</p> <p>Tyranitar has the option of running a mixed suicide lead set, using a Hasty nature, max Speed, max Special Attack, and Ice Beam to deal heavy damage to Groudon. A Focus Sash or Air Balloon can be used to dodge an OHKO from Earthquake. This set is most effective when sandstorm is not central to the team's overall strategy. A combination of Focus Sash and Counter can also be used to surprise Groudon, but it is generally unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Groudon completely walls Tyranitar, removes the sandstorm, and OHKOes with Earthquake or forces it out with Dragon Tail. Arceus-Ground fulfills a similar role, while Arceus-Fighting resists both STABs and OHKOes with 4x super effective Judgment. Arceus-Steel also resists both STABs, but will not enjoying taking Low Kick. Garchomp and Gliscor can both switch into anything apart from the occasional Ice Beam and deal heavy damage with Earthquake. Kyogre can take an attack from Choice Band Tyranitar (albeit not very well) and deal huge amounts of damage with its rain-boosted STAB attacks. Terrakion and Lucario both enjoy switching into Tyranitar's Dark-type STAB for a Justified boost, although both need to watch out for Superpower, and in Lucario's case, Fire Blast. Heracross can also can switch into anything barring Choice Band Stone Edge and Fire Blast. All three of the Fighting-types listed above can OHKO with Close Combat. Similar to Heracross, Scizor only needs to watch out Fire Blast and needs to tread carefully around Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge, and it can OHKO in return with Superpower or deal huge amounts of damage with U-turn or Bullet Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>With the boost from sandstorm, Tyranitar's Special Defense is lifted to an enormous 463, and coupled with its impressive 404 HP, this allows it to weather even the mightiest of special attacks in the Uber metagame. These include Dialga's unboosted Draco Meteor, Palkia's Spacial Rend, Reshiram's Blue Flare, and so on. Unlike special walls such as Blissey and Chansey, Tyranitar can pack a punch with its attacks instead of relying on status and Seismic Toss. Using Crunch and Pursuit, Tyranitar can checkmate Giratina-O, allowing Rapid Spin to be used much more easily. It also checks unboosted Mewtwo, as it can survive a Life Orb-boosted Aura Sphere while dealing heavy damage back with STAB Crunch. It can Pursuit Choice Scarf Palkia locked into any attack apart from Surf, Pursuit Reshiram locked into a Fire-type attack, and Pursuit Kyogre locked into any non-Water-type attack, while also taking out Dialga with Low Kick. Tyranitar's chosen Dark-type STAB and Pursuit allow it to checkmate many threats, while Low Kick gives it fantastic coverage. Crunch is generally preferred as it allows Tyranitar to deal consistent damage to Dragon Tail Giratina-O, who would otherwise make Payback a 50 Base Power move.</p> <p>The last move is a toss-up between Fire Blast, Stealth Rock, and Stone Edge. Fire Blast allows Tyranitar to fry Ferrothorn and Forretress, who might try switching in to set up hazards, and keeps Scizor away. Stealth Rock can be used if the team requires Tyranitar to set it up, while Stone Edge allows Tyranitar to fully counter Ho-Oh, as it deals heavy damage to the phoenix even when Tyranitar has been burned by Sacred Fire.</p> <p>This set can also be used as a lead. With Tyranitar's horrible Speed, it is almost guaranteed that you will have sandstorm up unless your opponent decides to run Abomasnow, or something ridiculous like Iron Ball Kyogre. If Tyranitar is used as a lead, Superpower and Lum Berry can be considered as the Fighting-type move of choice and the item, respectively. This allows Tyranitar to take on anything Darkrai might throw at it, avoid being put to sleep by Dark Void and OHKO with Superpower (Focus Blast does not OHKO Tyranitar).</p> <p>Tyranitar has a few other moves it can run in the last slot, although their applications are not quite as useful as those listed. Ice Beam can be used so Garchomp does not get a free switch-in or a free setup; it also deals huge amounts of damage to Gliscor, who would otherwise be a nuisance to sand teams in general. Dragon Tail can also be used with hazard support, as Tyranitar is very good at forcing switches anyway.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Tyranitar to weather two Surfs from defensive Kyogre, meaning it can even switch into the leviathan and set up the sand, then switch out with the weather on its side. A Sassy nature is preferred if Tyranitar is using Fire Blast or Ice Beam, but Careful is preferred if it is not.</p> <p>Groudon is Tyranitar's biggest enemy, as it completely walls the sand tyrant, while wiping away the sandstorm with its ability, Drought. It takes little damage from anything Tyranitar uses and OHKOes with Earthquake. Arceus-Fighting, Arceus-Ground, and Garchomp are next in the long line of Tyranitar counters. Kyogre can switch in and introduce rain while drowning Tyranitar with its overpowered Water-type STAB. Arceus-Water, Arceus-Bug, Arceus-Steel, and Arceus-Grass also scare the pants off Tyranitar. Terrakion can come into any attack not named Low Kick or Superpower and OHKO with Close Combat, even receiving a Justified boost from Tyranitar's STAB Dark-type attacks. Heracross can do a similar job, but will not enjoy switching into Fire Blast. If Tyranitar lacks Fire Blast, Scizor can also switch in and deal massive damage with U-turn.</p> <p>Tyranitar's teammates, naturally, would fit into two categories: Pokemon that fit into the first category include those that can switch into Tyranitar's weaknesses or check the long line of counters just listed, while the second include Pokemon that can take advantage of Tyranitar's infinite sandstorm. Lugia and Giratina have excellent defensive synergy with Tyranitar; the former is 4x resistant to Fighting-type attacks, resists Grass-type moves, and also has a handy Ground-type immunity, while Giratina is immune to Fighting-type attacks and packs Bug-, Water-, and Grass-type resistances. Both have massive defenses to shrug off unboosted attacks as well. Palkia is 4x resistant to Water-type attacks, while Arceus-Grass and Latias can also switch into them without much hassle either. If sandstorm is not central to your game plan, Kyogre is an excellent teammate to Tyranitar, as it can also switch into unboosted Water-type attacks while scaring away a lot of Tyranitar's checks, such as Scizor and Groudon. In return, Tyranitar can chase down fleeing Palkia locked into Thunder, doing enough damage so that it cannot switch into Kyogre any more. Sand abusers include Pokemon such as Excadrill, who outspeeds virtually everything in the sand, Arceus-Rock, who becomes a nigh-unkillable tank, Garchomp, whose Sand Veil ability causes opponents to rip their hair out, and Landorus, who can use its Sand Force ability to decimate teams.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Tyranitar's high base 134 Attack and enormous Special Defense make it an excellent Choice Band user in the Uber environment. It can easily switch into many special attackers in the tier who are locked into unfavourable attacks and deal massive damage to them with Pursuit as they switch out. Such Pokemon include Choice Scarf Palkia locked into any attack apart from Surf, Giratina-O, and Reshiram locked into a Fire-type move. With these Pokemon removed, other Pokemon such as Kyogre can sweep a lot more easily. Crunch is Tyranitar's main STAB, although Payback is another option, since Tyranitar is slow. Payback will be weak against phazers such as Lugia and Giratina-O, though. Crunch's chance to lower Defense also allows Tyranitar to come out on top in certain situations. If you are lucky with the Defense drops, Tyranitar could potentially defeat Lugia one-on-one. Stone Edge is Tyranitar's most powerful attack, doing huge damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Low Kick rounds out the set, providing good coverage against Steel-types.</p> <p>The EVs used give Tyranitar a high chance of surviving any unboosted Aura Sphere from Mewtwo and OHKOing back with Crunch. Max Attack can be used so Tyranitar can OHKO Scizor with Stone Edge after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes, but this is not recommended as the bulk lost is considerable.</p> <p>Like the first set, Groudon walls Tyranitar, taking a measly 26.98% - 31.93% from Crunch. It removes the sand that Tyranitar provides for its team and OHKOes with Earthquake. Arceus-Fighting resists both of Tyranitar's STABs and OHKOes with Judgment. Arceus-Ground serves a similar purpose to Groudon, and walls Tyranitar even harder with access to Recover. Garchomp can switch in without much problem too. Arceus-Steel and Dialga resist both of Tyranitar's STABs, but must watch out for Low Kick. Other Arceus formes with super effective STAB can take down Tyranitar pretty easily too. Bulky Kyogre can switch into Tyranitar once, wipe out sandstorm, and deal massive damage with its rain-boosted STAB. It is for these reasons that Pokemon that cover Tyranitar's weaknesses are good teammates. Lugia and Giratina resist most of Tyranitar's weaknesses. Arceus-Grass, Palkia, and Latias can switch into most of Kyogre's attacks without much trouble, although its coverage moves will wear them down very quickly. Abusers of sandstorm are also great teammates to run alongside Tyranitar, and these include Excadrill, Arceus-Rock, Garchomp, and Landorus.</p>"

  "Lugia": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting the title as the Great Wall of the Pokemon world for four consecutive generations, Lugia's titanic defenses and exceptionally high Speed allow it to stall out a large portion of the Ubers metagame, ranging from the legendary Extreme Killer Arceus and Rayquaza to more obscure threats such as Venusaur. Unlike most walls, this flying beast is able to take both physical and special hits like a champ, sometimes even stalling out powerful STAB super effective hits with the help of Reflect or Light Screen. However, Lugia is not without flaws; it is not only total Spikes bait, but is also completely powerless against bulky foes. With newcomer Kyurem-W joining the metagame, Lugia might not enjoy its life as a wall just like it could in the past.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Pressure vs Multiscale</h3> <p>Due to Lugia's already insane bulk, Multiscale is not always the superior ability for Lugia. While Multiscale is a great ability, Pressure can be just as useful, because Lugia is a stalling machine and depleting the opponent's PP as quickly as possible can be crucial to Lugia's success. However, Lugia can only outstall certain threats by using Pressure such as Ho-Oh and Zekrom. If Lugia has Multiscale instead, it cannot PP stall Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire, Groudon's Stone Edge, and Zekrom's Bolt Strike as quickly, and the use of Substitute goes well with Pressure. Due to Lugia's naturally high Speed, Pressure can also let Lugia abuse Substitute and stall out enormously powerful hits such as Choice Specs Kyogre's Water Spout, which has only 4 chances. Multiscale is not really reliable because it activates only at 100%, and Lugia is also weak to Stealth Rock making this feat easier said than done. Pressure, on the other hand, is always active. Using Pressure also allows Lugia to fare better against Kyurem-W because it can use Substitute a few times to sap up all the PP, and Roosting when necessary. Timid Choice Specs Ice Beam only does 47.6% - 56.3% to 252 HP Lugia, so it can stall that out with the combination of Roost + Substitute and Pressure as long as Lugia is faster.</p> <p>However, Multiscale has its own fair share of advantages as well. With the ability, Lugia becomes a solid answer to Baton Pass teams because a +2 Thunder from Life Orb Dialga cannot even come close to OHKOing Lugia. Multiscale is also great for Lugia to tank the initial hit, such as when taking a +4 Arceus Extreme Speed before phazing it out. Substitute + Multiscale is another interesting combination, as when used together, Lugia's Substitute can survive even very powerful hits such as Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire. Multiscale halves damage only at full health, but when active, it allows Lugia to stall out even Choice Specs Palkia's Hydro Pump in the rain or to survive something like +2 Groudon's and Terrakion's Stone Edge. Multiscale will give Lugia the upper hand when trying to counter end-game Swords Dance Arceus because Pressure will be near useless in that case; an unboosted Attack from Arceus does not come close to 3HKOing Lugia.</p> <p>Unlike Dragonite in OU, Lugia's lack of offense and extremely high defenses deter the use of sheer power to take it down, instead attracting Toxic to bypass them. This in turn makes Multiscale less effective. However, if you do usually use brute force to take Lugia down, you might be extremely annoyed at how well Multiscale Lugia just soaks up hits. The Calm Mind set will generally prefer Multiscale if you just wish to sweep your opponent better and get more setup chances.</p> <p>In the end, it is up to your team preferences. Both abilities have their own advantages but the Calm Mind set will enjoy the extra buff from Multiscale more than the Great Wall set. Fast Lugia spreads also work better with Multiscale but is still usable with a bulky spread. Pressure is a useful ability for a titanic wall like Lugia and is great for all out stalling the opponent to death.</p> <h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Because Garchomp and Groudon will pretty much never switch into it, Thunder Wave is an excellent support move for Lugia. It can help slow the opponent's sweepers and revenge killers, paving the way for a slow Pokemon such as Groudon to sweep. However, Lugia's real use is in stall teams in which Toxic is generally the superior status to use. A specially defensive set can be used with Light Screen to take on certain sweepers such as Mixed Rayquaza and Mewtwo more effectively. Light Screen amps up Lugia's Special Defense even more, making it nigh impossible to break with special attacks. With Light Screen in effect, Lugia can even wall Specs Kyurem-W with Roost easily.</p> <p>Safeguard is also an option to give Lugia status protection and support for the team but it does not block Leech Seed. Shed Shell can be used as an alternative item choice to stop Wobbuffet from turning Lugia into setup bait but it is not worth it to sacrifice passive recovery from leftovers. Weather Ball combined with sunlight allows Lugia to fry Excadrill, Forretress, and Ferrothorn, which is very useful as otherwise, they can use Lugia as setup bait.</p> <p>By running a moveset of Rest / Sleep Talk / Whirlwind / Dragon Tail, Lugia can use an interesting tactic known as Speed Shuffling. Sleep Talk cancels out the negative priority of phazing moves, and because Lugia learns both Whirlwind and Dragon Tail, Sleep Talk will have a 66% chance of forcing the opponent to immediately switch out, which Lugia can abuse entry hazards for devastating effects due to its high Speed. Although Rest activates Multiscale 100% of the time, it only helps soften the initial hit, and Lugia is better off just using Roost. Lugia's walling capabilities will also be severely hampered when relying on Rest for recovery. However, this set cannot touch anything with Taunt and will often be put into a tough situation if Sleep Talk does not select a phazing move, so usage is generally not recommended.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Darkrai is usually a great answer to Lugia, as Lugia can't really hurt Darkrai due to its pathetic power. As Darkrai is a frail and offensive Pokemon, it does not really mind being Toxic poisoned. Darkrai carries STAB Dark Pulse to OHKO Lugia once it gets up a Nasty Plot with the help of Life Orb. Kyurem-W has an extremely powerful STAB Ice Beam to OHKO almost any Lugia variants as long as Lugia does not get the chance to use Roost or Light Screen. Scarf Kyurem-W can safely 2HKO Lugia with Ice Beam while laughing at Lugia's own Ice Beam, although Dragon Tail combined with entry hazards can easily wear Kyurem-W down. Even though Tyranitar risks being outstalled by Reflect and Toxic, it has powerful STAB Stone Edge and Crunch to deal major damage to Lugia. Tyranitar is a much better counter to the Calm Mind set as it does not fear weak Ice Beam and Thunders. Kyogre and Zekrom carry mighty Water- and Electric-type STAB attacks that are just too powerful for Lugia to handle. Choice Scarf Zekrom is generally the best set to deal with Lugia because it can outrun and quickly knock out Lugia with Bolt Strike before it gets the chance to use Substitute or Reflect. The pink blobs also completely wall Lugia and can outstall it with Toxic while laughing at Lugia's attempts to hurt it; beware of Substitute as it will turn the tables as both blobs rely on Toxic to kill Lugia. Reshiram, although it dislikes Calm Mind variants, can come in and roast Lugia alive with Blue Flare provided the weather is sunny. Heatran is in a similar position. Although it fears Earth Power and Earthquake much more than Reshiram, it doesn't care about Toxic and can even Taunt Lugia to stop it from healing itself. Skarmory can freely setup Spikes on Lugia but will loath Thunders coming from the Calm Mind set. Forretress can take on any attack barring a Weather Ball in the sun, and use Lugia as Spikes bait or wear it down with Toxic. It can also use Rapid Spin to remove all the entry hazards Lugia uses to wreak havoc. Jirachi can also squander any attack from Lugia and cripple it with a Toxic of its own. Lastly, Choice Band Kyurem-B can 2HKO all Lugia versions with Outrage while easily taking Ice Beams or Thunder as long as Lugia lacks Reflect.</p> <p>Toxic absolutely ruins Lugia's walling abilities, so simply hitting it with the debilitating Poison-type move will leave it crippled and near useless. Stealth Rock also isn't fun for Lugia either. Losing 25% HP on every switch-in really messes up Lugia's ability to take hits. However, Lugia can foil Toxic attempts with a faster Substitute.</p>",

      "Great Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Lugia's defenses are very tough to crack, but it is more suited to be a physical wall. With the listed combination of moves, it can function as an excellent counter to some of the top threats in the Uber metagame, including but not limited to Groudon, Rayquaza, Garchomp, Arceus, Giratina-O, Genesect, and some Palkia, Latias, Latios, and Dialga. It also gets Leftovers as an additional recovery so it will not get worn down by passive damage as easily as Arceus. Immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes is huge in Ubers because the metagame is heavily Spikes-based. Access to Dragon Tail allows Lugia to phaze through Taunt, which is something defensive Arceus wishes it could do.</p> <p>Roost is Lugia's most important move because its main role is to stall out the opponent. It provides reliable healing and cancels out its weaknesses to Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-type attacks for a turn, which Lugia can often take advantage of due to its great Speed stat. This is particularly useful when trying to stall out dangerous opponents such as Zekrom or Kyurem-B using Fusion Bolt. If you are not a fan of Whirlwind leaving Lugia exposed to Taunt, Dragon Tail is an acceptable alternative to phaze through it and deal a little damage in the process. Keep in mind that Dragon Tail cannot phaze through Substitutes, and with Lugia's pathetic offenses, this can prevent Lugia from stopping sweepers abusing Substitute such as Giratina-O.</p> <p>When using Whirlwind, Ice Beam is the preferred option to deal direct damage to the Dragon-types Lugia is famous for countering. Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Salamence are all easily OHKOed by Ice Beam after a layer of Spikes or Stealth Rock. Nevertheless, bulkier sweepers not weak to Ice such as Mewtwo and Arceus can easily shrug off Ice Beams. If you are using Dragon Tail over Whirlwind, Substitute becomes a decent option to prevent status such as Toxic from crippling Lugia. Once poisoned, Lugia is rendered useless as it can no longer stall out opponents due to the increasing damage. Substitute also allows Lugia to PP stall the opponent with ease.</p> <p>There are many options for the last slot as Lugia has a wide movepool. Reflect allows Lugia to bolster its Defense stat to counter powerful physical sweepers such as Groudon and Arceus more efficiently. This is especially important when Lugia is trying to stop Zekrom or Swords Dance Groudon due to their high base Attack stat and possess super effective moves to hit Lugia with. Reflect can be used to its fullest extend with a faster EV spread. If you are not a fan of Whirlwind, Toxic can be used. Toxic is Lugia's only way of dealing real damage to bulky opponents, and works well with Lugia's stalling prowess. When the opponent can no longer be forced out, Toxic works as a great solution such as when facing end game Swords Dance Arceus. Earthquake can also work in the last slot as it allows Lugia to strike at Zekrom, Heatran, and Reshiram switch-ins, all of which are key stallbreakers, so weakening them as fast as possible can be a game-changer. If you do not mind losing Ice Beam, a combination of Toxic and Reflect together with Roost will help Lugia defeat end-game Swords Dance Arceus all of the time bar a critical hit.</p> <p>The EV spread listed above is best to maximize Lugia's ability to stomach physical attacks--for example, a Lugia with this EV spread can never be OHKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Outrage from Rayquaza at +1 Atk after Stealth Rock damage, and it can also take on sun-fueled Sacred Fire from Ho-Oh; however Reflect is needed to outstall Ho-Oh. It also ensures that standard Extreme Killer Arceus is unable to 2HKO with a +2 Silk Scarf boosted Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock as long as Lugia uses Reflect on the turn it is hit. The Special Defense EVs also ensure that Lugia will rarely be 2HKOed by an unboosted Thunder from Timid Palkia, factoring in Leftovers. However, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Jolly or Timid nature is also reasonable. It allows Lugia to outspeed Terrakion, giving Lugia time to throw up a Reflect before it can use Stone Edge, and it allows Lugia to take on Garchomp, Swords Dance Rayquaza, Kyurem-B, and mixed Palkia and Dialga more effectively. It also allows Lugia to speed tie at worst with Latias and Latios, and with Roost, both of them are easily outstalled as long as the weather is not rain. The faster spread will work best with Multiscale, so Lugia's decreased bulk will not be so significant. A fast Roost can also allow Lugia to activate Multiscale before the opponent gets to attack and this can prove to be very important when facing powerful threats such as Choice Specs Palkia. 96 Defense EVs and a Defense boosting nature are already sufficient for preventing a Jolly Dragon Dance Rayquaza +1 Outrage from OHKOing after Stealth Rock and one turn of Leftovers. Max HP and Def is also a fine EV spread if you don't care about the additional Special Defense, while surviving +1 Outrage from the rare Adamant Rayquaza 100% of the time. If you like a balance of bulk and Speed, a spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 Spe can be used to outrun everything up to Modest Kyurem-W, while also providing optimum bulk to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Salamence's Outrage even after Stealth Rock and sandstorm or hail damage. Go any faster and you might as well just use max Speed because that sacrifices too much of Lugia's bulk already. Both of Lugia's abilities work well for this set depending on your team's needs.</p> <p>Toxic is probably Lugia's biggest hindrance, followed closely by Stealth Rock. The former renders Lugia incapable of walling anything due to the ever-increasing poison damage, while the latter slices 25% of Lugia's HP away every time it switches in, and it breaks Multiscale too if you choose to use it. Thankfully, Forretress is immune to Toxic and can also make use of Rapid Spin to clear Stealth Rock from the field, giving Lugia more freedom in switching in to absorb blows. Forretress is also capable of setting up entry hazards to help weaken foes alongside Whirlwind and Dragon Tail. Excadrill and Tentacruel are also excellent partners for Lugia as they are both immune to Toxic and have access to Rapid Spin and the latter with the ability to setup entry hazards as well. Cleric support from the likes of Blissey is also great in making sure Toxic doesn't cripple Lugia.</p> <p>Lugia is generally threatened by fast sweepers not weak to Ice Beam and which are capable of hitting it with powerful STAB super effective moves, namely Darkrai. Dark Void will block Lugia's attempts to phaze it out by lulling it to sleep, giving Darkrai a chance to obtain a Nasty Plot before destroying Lugia with a boosted Dark Pulse. Tyranitar and Magnezone also completely wall Lugia without Earthquake, and can easily cut it down using Stone Edge or Thunder, respectively. However, both of them have to beware of getting out stalled by Roost and Pressure. Lugia is also completely incapable of doing anything to defensive threats such as Chansey and Blissey, who can just cripple Lugia with Toxic and sit there until it succumbs to the debilitating poison. Wobbuffet can trap Lugia with Shadow Tag and turn it into setup fodder using Encore. Forretress and Ferrothorn can also come in and set up whatever they want on Lugia, as Lugia can't really hurt them. Lugia cannot spinblock the entry hazards it loves, so a spinblocker is recommended as a partner, although keep in mind Ghost-types share some similar weaknesses with Lugia. Kyogre and Zekrom pack super effective Electric-type attacks to annihilate Lugia. Kyurem-W is another major threat to Lugia as Choice Specs Ice Beam coming from Kyurem-W will always OHKO standard Lugia. Xatu prevents Lugia from doing anything if it lacks Ice Beam thanks to Magic Bounce. Groudon handles most Zekrom and Magnezone with ease thanks to its immunity to Electric-type attacks and great defenses, and the sunlight it brings with it makes Thunder less of a worry to Lugia. Tyranitar and Blissey also have little hope of getting through Groudon although Blissey can cripple Groudon with Toxic. Arceus-Fighting, with its impressive defenses and resistances, handles Darkrai, Arceus-Dark, Kyurem-W, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn very well, and is capable of using Forretress as setup bait, as long as the bagworm lacks Toxic. Palkia can come in on Kyogre with ease and blast it away with Thunder, and it can also use a mixed set to lure in and take out Wobbuffet. Genesect is capable of revenge killing Darkrai, Tyranitar, Kyurem-W, and Zekrom while also sharing great typing synergy with Lugia.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Lugia might seem outclassed by Arceus at first, who is faster and boasts better offenses, but this is simply not the case. Lugia, unlike most of the Arceus formes, can hold Leftovers, meaning Lugia can continue boosting without needing to use Roost as frequently. With Multiscale, Lugia has more initial setup opportunities and can switch into attacks better than Arceus can. If you choose to run Pressure instead, Lugia can become a PP stalling machine and allows it to win the war against opposing Calm Mind users such as Latias. Due to the prevalence of low PP moves in Ubers such as Spacial Rend, Pressure can be extremely useful even on a set like this because Lugia retains much of its bulk.</p> <p>Ice Beam is Lugia's main attack on this set. Although Lugia's Special Attack is mediocre, Ice Beam will still do plenty of damage after a few Calm Mind boosts, and the super effective coverage it has on Dragon-types is a huge plus. Thunder is a great move to use in general thanks to its solid base power and high paralysis rate. With Thunder, Lugia zaps Kyogre and Manaphy for good damage while getting a decent smack on Steel-type Pokemon, giving Lugia a way to get past its usual checks. Whirlwind can also be used to stop other Calm Mind users from setting up on Lugia, if one is willing to forgo the added type coverage. Whirlwind is particularly effective thanks to Lugia's immense bulk, as it is capable of taking hits from opposing boosters and removing all of their boosts through Whirlwind. With Whirlwind, Lugia can also abuse damage from entry hazards to weaken its usual counters before attempting a sweep.</p> <p>If you really hate certain Steel-types, Earth Power can be used instead. It blasts Excadrill, Heatran, and Magnezone to pieces while landing a solid smack on Reshiram and Tyranitar. Either way, both moves have great type coverage when paired with Ice Beam. However, it is generally not worth it to use Earth Power simply because Thunder offers better utility in general while Whirlwind allows Lugia to take advantage of its bulk. Psyshock is another interesting option for this set. It allows Lugia to beat pink blobs, Tentacruel, and opposing Calm Mind users, including Arceus, Latias, Kyogre, and Manaphy without phazing them out. However, Lugia loses great coverage and phazing prowess when using Psyshock. Certain Arceus forms, especially those dangerous to Lugia such as Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Steel, are not harmed by Psyshock. Aeroblast is a very powerful STAB but it has horrible PP and Lugia being a defensive Pokemon in general hates losing PP so quickly. Substitute can go over Thunder if you really hate status and Ferrothorn. Surf destroys Excadrill, Heatran, and Arceus-Ground in the rain but is pretty useless otherwise because it is weather dependent and does not have good neutral coverage.</p> <p>In addition to being hampered by all of the Pokemon that trouble the previous set, other Calm Mind users, such as the Arceus formes (Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Electric, Arceus-Ice, Arceus-Ghost, and Arceus-Rock), can easily beat Lugia one-on-one due to their better type matchup or offensive stats. However, Arceus might lose if Lugia runs Whirlwind because all of them cannot quickly dispatch Lugia, especially if Lugia has Multiscale. Blissey can handle most kinds of Calm Mind Arceus with ease thanks to Toxic. While Kyogre fears boosted Thunders, it can threaten Lugia back with powerful Thunders of its own. Kyogre is easily dealt with by Scarf Zekrom and Arceus-Grass thanks to their superior Speed, powerful super effective STAB moves, and resistance to Water-type attacks. Forretress and Tentacruel can also set up Toxic Spikes, which greatly hampers most of this set's counters by putting them on a timer so they won't be able to bother Lugia as much anymore. Excadrill can support Lugia by defeating Tyranitar and Zekrom. Kyurem-W is not as threatening to this set but a Choice Specs-boosted Ice Beam can still be an issue. The pink blobs and Jirachi can wall Kyurem-W and support Lugia with Wish.</p>"

  "Ho-Oh": {
    "overview": "<p>With a huge base 130 Attack and powerful STAB options in Sacred Fire (which carries an impressive 50% burn rate) and Brave Bird, Ho-Oh can easily put serious hurt on anything that dares to stand up to it. Regenerator increases Ho-Oh's durability, allowing Ho-Oh to function as a bulky pivot. Ho-Oh can even amp up its middling Speed with Flame Charge, potentially sweeping an entire weakened team with its immensely powerful STABs. Ho-Oh is one of the most dangerous sun based Pokemon in the game; even in rain, Ho-Oh still has a powerful Brave Bird to throw around, a move not even Kyogre will enjoy taking. Ho-Oh is not restricted to a specific weather archetype because it counters certain threats such as Arceus-Fighting, Arceus-Ghost, and sun teams, which often find themselves completely walled by Ho-Oh. 154 base Special Defense with 106 base HP gives Ho-Oh great special bulk and, when combined with Ho-Oh's good offenses and Sacred Fire's great burn chance, makes it an amazing offensive tank that has equal special bulk to Great Wall Lugia! Even with a crippling weakness to the common Stealth Rock, Ho-Oh's amazing qualities allow it to thrive in the hostile Uber metagame due to its combination of power and bulk. Unfortunately, Stealth Rock will continue to be Ho-Oh's biggest weakness even with access to Regenerator, as the rainbow bird despises losing 50% of its HP on every switch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Recover is an option over Roost if you desperately need to keep Ho-Oh's immunity to Ground-type attacks at all times. Hippowdon is the only notable Earthquake user that is always slower than Ho-Oh, but it can easily be burned and walled anyway. Ho-Oh can utilize any of Reflect, Light Screen, and Toxic to become a very good wall with Pressure, but that role is better left to Lugia, which has greater Defense and Speed. Ho-Oh is also a good spreader of paralysis with Thunder Wave, so the move can be used on defensive sets, but Ho-Oh is better off killing things directly. Ground-type Pokemon, such as Groudon and Garchomp, rarely switch into Ho-Oh due to the risk of getting burned by Sacred Fire. Safeguard can also be used to give Ho-Oh status protection, but Substitute is usually the better option, as it also stops Leech Seed. Finally, Ho-Oh can use Calm Mind or Choice Specs and run a decent special attacking set with its good base 110 Special Attack, but it's generally outclassed by Reshiram in that respect due to Reshiram's much higher Special Attack and access to STAB Dragon-type attacks. Thunder seems like a great move to KO Kyogre, but Brave Bird actually does more damage to most Kyogre due to Kyogre's Defense being much lower than its Special Defense and Ho-Oh's high Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ho-Oh is extremely hard to counter due to its high bulk, powerful attacks, and the threat of a burn. The best way to keep Ho-Oh in check isn't a Pokemon at all; it is Stealth Rock. Stealth Rock limits Ho-Oh's longevity by stripping off 50% of its health every time it switches in. Even with Regenerator, Ho-Oh fears Stealth Rock more than anything else. Keeping a sturdy Ghost-type such as Giratina-O or Arceus-Ghost is recommended to ensure Stealth Rock isn't spun away.</p> <p>Kyogre is by far the most common way to check Ho-Oh because of Drizzle canceling out Ho-Oh's beloved sunlight and Kyogre's immense power. A full power Water Spout from Kyogre can easily drown Ho-Oh regardless of its EVs. While surprising, specially defensive Ho-Oh actually stands a chance of surviving one Surf from non-Choice Specs Kyogre. Additionally, offensive Kyogre is 2HKOed by Brave Bird. Bold Kyogre avoids the 2HKO from Brave Bird, but Scald does not OHKO in return, making it a shaky check. The reason Kyogre is so widely used to counter Ho-Oh is because it can counteract Ho-Oh's most common partner, Groudon. Most of Ho-Oh's checks are defeated by Groudon, but Kyogre easily OHKOes both with its high-powered Water-type attacks, making it the most consistent check.</p> <p>Arceus-Rock is probably the closest thing Ho-Oh has to a true counter. It resists both Sacred Fire and Brave Bird, has the bulk to take multiple hits, and can OHKO Ho-Oh with a swift Judgment. However, Arceus-Rock really hates switching in on Earthquake repeatedly, as it 2HKOes, especially in conjunction with burn damage. Zekrom also resists both of Ho-Oh's STABs, has high Defense, and can easily fell it with Bolt Strike. However, Zekrom loathes a possible burn, and a Life Orb Earthquake almost OHKOes it. Heatran is immune to Sacred Fire and a burn and resists Brave Bird but is OHKOed by Earthquake and cannot do much to Ho-Oh in return besides Toxic. Palkia quadruple resists Sacred Fire and can take one Brave Bird from full health, but even though it possesses STAB Water-type attacks, Ho-Oh actually walls Palkia in the sunlight unless it carries Stone Edge. Outside of sun, Palkia can easily 2HKO Ho-Oh with Surf, and Stone Edge is a must if you rely on Palkia to check Ho-Oh. Power Gem does not even come close to OHKOing Ho-Oh. Giratina is one of the few walls capable of soaking up Ho-Oh's attacks somewhat comfortably, but it cannot do much in return besides phaze, as Ho-Oh can avoid Toxic with Substitute. Physically defensive Giratina-O is not 2HKOed by Brave Bird and can 2HKO Ho-Oh back with Outrage, but an untimely burn messes it up. Rayquaza also outspeeds Ho-Oh and can Outrage it into oblivion, but Rayquaza can only really come in on Earthquake, as it cannot risk eating a burn or Brave Bird. Lugia can cripple Ho-Oh with a faster Toxic, can soften hits with Reflect, and stall Ho-Oh out with Roost and Pressure. However, Lugia does not enjoy taking repeated Sacred Fires in the sun, especially because Lugia is likely to be burned as well. Lugia is also capable of forcing out Ho-Oh with Whirlwind but cannot deal real damage outside of Toxic. A fast Choice Band Groudon can survive at least one attack and OHKO Ho-Oh with Stone Edge, even after a burn. Tyranitar resists both of Ho-Oh's STABs and has a powerful Stone Edge to OHKO back, but it risks getting stalled out by Substitute if Stone Edge misses and is extremely vulnerable to being burned. Kyurem-B does not resist any of Ho-Oh's common attacks but is faster than it and bulky enough to take one hit and OHKO back with Fusion Bolt. Hippowdon can take repeated hits thanks to Slack Off, set up Stealth Rock, and Whirlwind Ho-Oh out, but it fails to do any real damage.</p> <p>Mewtwo can OHKO Ho-Oh with Psystrike after Stealth Rock damage, but it cannot switch in safely on any move besides Roost. While it is a rather strange proposition, a defensive Arceus-Fire with Stone Edge is immune to burn and can KO Ho-Oh in one hit, making it one of the best albeit niche counters to Ho-Oh. Kabutops quadruple resists Sacred Fire and is only 3HKOed by Brave Bird, so it can switch in on one hit and OHKO slower Ho-Oh sets with Stone Edge, but Earthquake can smash it to pieces, so it must be wary of switching in. Reshiram with Stone Edge can turn the tables on Ho-Oh, as it does not fear burn or Sacred Fire while Stone Edge OHKOes. Almost anything faster than Ho-Oh that has a Rock-type attack, such as Choice Scarf Garchomp or Terrakion, can easily revenge kill it with Stone Edge.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>This Ho-Oh set shrugs off most non-super effective hits while replying with powerful attacks of its own. Unlike most walls, Ho-Oh packs a lot of power, so it can KO the opponent outright instead of relying on status or phazing moves. Thanks to Ho-Oh's great stat layout, it can wall most special attackers with just 248 HP EVs; most Calm Mind Arceus that lack a super effective attack to hit Ho-Oh with have little hope of breaking past it. This set also checks many other notable threats, such as Darkrai, Shaymin-S, Palkia, Reshiram, Latias, Genesect, Dialga, and Tornadus-T.</p> <p>Sacred Fire and Brave Bird are the main attacks. Sacred Fire's solid burn rate deters switch-ins from the likes of Rayquaza and other powerful physical attackers hoping to take out Ho-Oh. Brave Bird is a powerful STAB move that can be easily thrown around in a tier where few common Pokemon resist Flying-type attacks, easily annihilating Kyogre, Palkia, and Reshiram. Roost lets Ho-Oh stall out defensive Groudon's Stone Edge, which becomes even easier when Groudon is burned with Sacred Fire. Although Roost makes Ho-Oh vulnerable to Earthquake, most users of the move are faster than Ho-Oh anyway, and Stone Edge from Groudon will still do more damage to a non-Roosting Ho-Oh than Earthquake to a Roosting one. Substitute gives Ho-Oh status protection and eases prediction; it can be set up easily because Ho-Oh frequently finds free turns due to the many Pokemon that can't touch it, such as Ferrothorn and Blissey.</p> <p>The Special Defense EVs just guarantee Ho-Oh's survival against some powerful attacks. +4 Timid Life Orb Darkrai cannot OHKO this Ho-Oh, Choice Scarf Palkia only has a 3.13% chance to 2HKO with Thunder, and 252+ Dialga's Draco Meteor does a maximum of 51.56%. Any max Special Attack neutral-natured Arceus will never 2HKO Ho-Oh with a +1 neutral Judgment thanks to Leftovers. A Life Orb can be used over Leftovers, trading longevity for power; the item secures important OHKOs and 2HKOs that Ho-Oh cannot achieve with Leftovers, such as the almost-guaranteed OHKO on Choice Scarf Kyogre with Brave Bird after Stealth Rock damage. Genesect can never get past Ho-Oh unless it manages to grab a Special Attack boost beforehand and has Thunder or Explosion. Even Kyurem-W has trouble killing a full health Ho-Oh, as only Modest Choice Specs Ice Beam stands a chance to 2HKO and Draco Meteor can be outstalled with Roost. Both Latias and Latios are walled by Ho-Oh unless the latter packs Psyshock or rain is up and they carry Surf. Thunder from Latias barely 2HKOes Ho-Oh, while Brave Bird can easily net a 2HKO or even an OHKO if you are using Life Orb. When using a Life Orb, an alternate spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe can be used for maximum power and optimum bulk. Leftovers is the preferred item, as Ho-Oh enjoys the extra recovery and the prevention of Brave Bird recoil from wearing down Ho-Oh too quickly.</p> <p>Earthquake is an option, as it rounds out Ho-Oh's coverage superbly, 2HKOing all forms of Zekrom (even OHKOing offensive variants after damage from Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes) as well as deterring Arceus-Rock and the rare Heatran from switching in freely. Whirlwind allows Ho-Oh to become a great phazer, but that is generally better left to physically defensive Ho-Oh, which has more bulk.</p> <p>If you need Ho-Oh to beat Choice Specs Kyurem-W, using a set with max Special Defense investment is possible, but Ho-Oh will have to sacrifice a lot of power. Sunny Day can also be used on this set (in the last slot) to lure in Kyogre, Ho-Oh's most common check, and turn the tables on it, but this can only be done on the predicted switch-in or on defensive Kyogre, which usually do not invest in Speed. Ho-Oh's favorite teammates are Groudon and a Rapid Spinner; the former pumps up the power of Sacred Fire, while the latter serves as a means to prevent—but not guarantee—Stealth Rock from being up to cripple Ho-Oh. This set also really appreciates paralysis support to make up for its low Speed. Arceus-Grass deters Ground-types from switching in with its typing, allowing it to slow down a large chunk of the enemy team with Thunder Wave. Dialga, Groudon, Lugia, Kyogre, Jirachi, and Blissey can also spread paralysis very effectively, as they are not common Thunder Wave users. Entry hazards are also recommended because Ho-Oh can force a lot of switches. Forretress can set up all three entry hazards, and Ho-Oh can easily come in on Fire-type attacks aimed at Forretress and start firing off powerful attacks. Excadrill is the best spinner in the tier, but it should only be paired with Ho-Oh on a sand team, as stacking Groudon and Excadrill with Ho-Oh makes the team extremely weak to Kyogre. Excadrill can easily switch in on Rock- or Electric-type attacks for Ho-Oh and weaken threats, while Ho-Oh can find many switch-in opportunities on Ground-, Fighting-, and Fire-type attacks aimed at Excadrill. While unreliable, Espeon and Xatu can use their Magic Bounce ability to keep Stealth Rock off the field for some time to support Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Forretress and Tentacruel are the only viable partners for Ho-Oh that can set up Toxic Spikes. Toxic Spikes, when combined with Substitute and Roost, can allow Ho-Oh to outstall many threats simply by spamming Substitute and Roost. For example, Ho-Oh can come in on something that it walls but is faster, such as Choice Scarf Palkia, and set up a Substitute as Palkia is worn down by the Toxic poison. From there, Ho-Oh can net another KO or two while safely behind its Substitute. However, bear in mind that you can no longer burn threats when they are poisoned.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Ho-Oh's greatest weakness has historically been Stealth Rock, which has dissuaded the use of Choice items on it. However, with Regenerator, Ho-Oh is able to switch in and out more freely, allowing it to wield the fearsome power of a Choice Band with far less risk. With a Choice Band, Ho-Oh becomes incredibly difficult to switch into; while a Life Orb also grants a comparable level of power, Choice Band's lack of recoil is appealing—even with Regenerator, Ho-Oh does not want to deal with additional passive damage when Stealth Rock is up. Choice Band-boosted Sacred Fire has amazing power in the sun, doing things such as OHKOing Arceus and Dialga after Stealth Rock and providing a comfortable 2HKO on physically defensive Groudon. It also ensures that Ho-Oh can take lead Deoxys-S down to its Focus Sash and—due to the chance of burn—limit Deoxys-S to one layer of hazards 47.5% of the time. Brave Bird is also incredibly powerful, OHKOing Kyogre and Palkia with no prior damage. It also 2HKOes Giratina-O, Forretress, and most physically defensive Arceus formes as well as a 2HKO on physically defensive Giratina with Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Earthquake covers Tyranitar, Arceus-Rock, Kabutops, Omastar, Heatran, and Dialga in rain. Sleep Talk allows Ho-Oh to be a relatively safe switch-in to Darkrai's dreaded Dark Void, while Punishment can be used to smash Calm Mind users weak to it, such as Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, and Latias.</p> <p>Heavy HP investment gives Ho-Oh more bulk and makes the use of Brave Bird much less risky. Alternatively, maximum Speed can be used to get the drop on as many other base 90 Pokemon as possible, but the loss in bulk is noticeable. Ho-Oh's movepool is quite sparse, so what's listed here is about as good as it gets. Very niche options for the fourth slot include Aerial Ace to guarantee a connection against an Evasion booster and Roost to help deal with residual damage if a free turn is presented—this is of course very risky on a Choice-locked Pokemon.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is actually more important for this set than sunlight. Unlike other sets, which have access to recovery, this Ho-Oh will be switching out often and relying on Regenerator to keep itself alive. Forretress can Rapid Spin while also providing entry hazards and switch-in opportunities with Volt Switch. Excadrill can switch into Zekrom fairly safely and can provide Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support as well. Groudon is also an important supporter for this set—while the raw power of Brave Bird allows this set to function even in rain, Ho-Oh greatly appreciates boosted Sacred Fires and a neutrality to Water-type moves. Groudon can provide Stealth Rock as well, which makes Multiscale Lugia easier to handle and ensures a few important OHKOes and 2HKOes. Offensively, Extreme Killer Arceus is an excellent complement to this set, as is Rock Polish Groudon. Both greatly enjoy this set's ability to cripple opposing Giratina and Groudon, and Sacred Fire's burn rate can grant easy set-up opportunities for them. Ho-Oh is also an excellent switch-in to Choice Scarf Genesect, something which can interfere with a weakened Extreme Killer Arceus's sweep. Defensively, partners that can switch into Kyogre are very important; Latias and Palkia are good examples.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>One of Ho-Oh's biggest problems is usually its middling base 90 Speed, but this can be mitigated by using Flame Charge or Tailwind to boost its Speed to more acceptable levels. Sun support from Groudon is highly recommended to power up Ho-Oh's STAB Sacred Fire and Flame Charge and to remove Ho-Oh's weakness to Water-type attacks. Sun also reduces Thunder's accuracy to an unreliable 50%, which can be helpful because some threats rely on Thunder to take out Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Flame Charge and Tailwind both have their own advantages. Flame Charge's Speed boost lasts until Ho-Oh switches out and allows Ho-Oh to soften up the foe with a light smack before going on the full offensive. It can also break Focus Sashes and Sturdy so that one of Ho-Oh's other attacks can KO on the next turn. Flame Charge is the more consistent option, as the boost stays until Ho-Oh switches out, and Ho-Oh can continue boosting its Speed till +6 with enough free turns. However, Tailwind offers a significantly higher initial Speed boost. For example, Ho-Oh requires a Jolly Nature and 252 Speed EVs just to Speed tie with positive natured base 90 Speed Pokemon that have a Choice Scarf. However, Ho-Oh can outrun max Speed base 108 Pokemon equipped with Choice Scarf while itself running a neutral nature and only 176 Speed EVs after a single use of Tailwind. Tailwind also benefits the entire team; if Ho-Oh needs to switch out, a counter to your opponent's Ho-Oh check can step in and perform a mini-sweep of its own using the boosted Speed granted by Tailwind. However, Tailwind only lasts three turns after being used, which means Ho-Oh cannot sweep for long when more than three faster threats are still around.</p> <p>Sacred Fire is always the main attack Ho-Oh will be using, and when backed by STAB and sunlight, outright OHKOes many Pokemon in the Uber tier, such as Mewtwo, as well as at least 2HKOing anything that does not resist it. Brave Bird, Ho-Oh's other incredibly potent STAB move of choice, nails Kyogre, Reshiram, and Palkia for assured OHKOs after just Stealth Rock damage. Brave Bird also provides Ho-Oh with a very strong sweeping attack in case the weather is not in its favor, but the recoil can be huge depending on how much damage it does. Roost rounds out the set brilliantly, helping Ho-Oh recover damage incurred from Stealth Rock and Life Orb, as well possibly allowing it to gain multiple Flame Charge boosts or to set up Tailwind repeatedly. While this Ho-Oh is an excellent offensive Pokemon, the loss of bulk is pretty significant, so it can no longer wall more powerful threats such as Calm Mind Arceus and Reshiram as reliably because both +1 Judgment and Draco Meteor OHKO Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage. Weaker threats, such as Shaymin-S and Darkrai, can still be checked, though. Although Fire- and Flying-type STABs are a good combination, they leave Ho-Oh walled by Zekrom, Heatran (it needs Toxic or Hidden Power Rock to beat Ho-Oh one on one, however), and Rock-type Pokemon. Earthquake solves this problem by OHKOing Zekrom after it takes damage from Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, always OHKOing Heatran, and 2HKOing at worst all common Rock-type Pokemon. However, without Roost, Ho-Oh is extremely vulnerable to Stealth Rock, so solid Rapid Spin support is necessary with Earthquake.</p> <p>The EVs are fairly simple. Maximum Attack is used to hit as hard as possible, and the Speed EVs enable Ho-Oh to hit 418 Speed after a Flame Charge, which lets it outpace everything below Choice Scarf Heatran. If using Tailwind, it is best to run 176 Speed EVs, which allow Ho-Oh to outspeed Choice Scarf Terrakion with Tailwind up. An Adamant nature is preferred because it affords Ho-Oh a large amount of much-needed power. However, Jolly allows Ho-Oh to outspeed Deoxys-A and tie with Choice Scarf-wielding base 90 Speed Pokemon, such as Timid Reshiram, after a Flame Charge boost and Jolly Max Speed Excadrill in the sand after a Tailwind. If you want to take advantage of Ho-Oh's bulk, a spread of 140 HP / 176 Atk / 192 Spe can be used with an Adamant nature to outrun everything up to Mewtwo after a Flame Charge boost, but this comes at the price of losing some power and Speed. Flame Plate is possible over Life Orb to power up Sacred Fire and Flame Charge if you hate the recoil. Sky Plate can be used to 2HKO bulky Kyogre and Giratina-O with Brave Bird. An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe lets you act like tank Ho-Oh with the ability to support the team through Tailwind, still giving Ho-Oh enough Speed to outspeed everything up to Mewtwo.</p> <p>Groudon, with its great bulk and everlasting sunlight courtesy of Drought, fulfills Ho-Oh's sunlight needs perfectly. Groudon can also set up Stealth Rock to help Ho-Oh nab some important OHKOs and is capable of beating many Pokemon that check Ho-Oh, such as Terrakion and Zekrom. Forretress's good Defense and many resistances allow it to fulfill the Rapid Spinning role perfectly; it can even set up Spikes to facilitate Ho-Oh's sweep. While attempting a successful Rapid Spin is hard in Ubers, Forretress does way more than that, as it can also help tank Outrages aimed at Ho-Oh and check certain threats, such as Terrakion with Gyro Ball. If you just wish to delay the setting up of Stealth Rock on your side of the field, Deoxys-S with Taunt is a good choice, as it can achieve this fairly easily thanks to its high Speed and can set up its own Stealth Rock. Magic Bounce users can also delay the opponent from setting up Stealth Rock. Sadly, the two Pokemon with the ability are easy to KO, making them mediocre partners.</p> <p>The best counter to this set is Arceus-Rock, as it packs resistances to both of Ho-Oh's STAB moves, is bulky enough to take an Earthquake, and can easily destroy Ho-Oh with one Judgment. Ho-Oh also isn't a fan of Kyogre and Zekrom, as the former disposes of Ho-Oh's beloved sunlight and the latter can handle one hit from Ho-Oh and OHKO it with Bolt Strike. Defensive Groudon can also be an annoyance to this set, as Sacred Fire only 2HKOes it while Stone Edge OHKOes Ho-Oh if you fail to burn Groudon. Rock-types are rare in Ubers, and the only semi-common ones are Tyranitar and Terrakion, which are easily checked by Groudon. Thankfully, Groudon's bulk and very powerful STAB Earthquake make it an excellent counter to Zekrom, opposing Groudon, and Rock-types, including Arceus-Rock. Palkia can easily come in on Kyogre's powerful Water-type strikes and defeat it with Thunder. Arceus-Grass is capable of checking pretty much all of Ho-Oh's counters, either crippling them with status or setting up on them with Calm Mind. Latias can also help defeat Kyogre and Terrakion with her powerful Grass Knot.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>While Tailwind and Flame Charge can boost Ho-Oh's Speed, those require a turn of setup. With a Choice Scarf, Ho-Oh becomes a great revenge killer and late-game cleaner with its powerful attacks and solid bulk. Although Ho-Oh does not outrun most opposing Choice Scarf users, it is still fast enough to outrun all Pokemon up to Mewtwo and positive-natured Deoxys-A if you choose to go with a Jolly nature.</p> <p>Sacred Fire, even without a Life Orb boost, is still a ridiculously powerful attack in the sunlight that maims anything that does not resist it. Brave Bird also stands as a very powerful secondary STAB that 2HKOes almost all Kyogre and Palkia. Only Bold Kyogre has a chance of avoiding the 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage and Scald does not even OHKO Ho-Oh in return. Earthquake is there to cover Pokemon such as Zekrom, Terrakion, Heatran, Tyranitar, and Reshiram, as well as getting a harder hit on Dialga outside of sun. However, getting locked into Earthquake is risky due to the sheer number of Flying-types and Levitate Pokemon in the Uber environment, so exercise caution before going ahead with the attack. Punishment is chosen as the last move to KO set-up sweepers such as Calm Mind Mewtwo, Giratina-O, and Arceus-Ghost. As Punishment increases in power as these Pokemon gain Calm Mind boosts, Ho-Oh can easily use Punishment to save your team from utter ruin if the enemy Calm Mind user has acquired multiple boosts. Sleep Talk lets Ho-Oh switch in on Darkrai; Brave Bird and Sacred Fire can KO it after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The EVs let Ho-Oh outrun everything up to neutral-natured Deoxys-A and maximize power, as this set needs all the power it can get. With an Adamant nature, Sacred Fire in the sun is even more powerful than Zekrom's Bolt Strike. If you manage to keep Stealth Rock off the field, Regenerator allows Ho-Oh to last a lot longer than most Choice Scarf users.</p> <p>Any teammate from the previous sets will also work well with this one. However, due to this Ho-Oh's considerably lower power, it can be more easily walled, as even defensive Groudon is not 2HKOed by any of Ho-Oh's moves. Wobbuffet can trap Ho-Oh with Shadow Tag and Counter it to oblivion as long as it does not come in on Sacred Fire in the sun. Choice Band Zekrom is able to stomp all over Kyogre with its powerful STAB Bolt Strike and can weaken Wobbuffet to the point where it can no longer trap Ho-Oh and live. Mixed attackers, such as Palkia and Dialga, can bluff a Choice Scarf by holding an item such as Lustrous Orb or Expert Belt to lure Wobbuffet in. As it Counters or Mirror Coats expecting a physical or special attack, Wobbuffet will quickly find itself being wiped off the face of the planet from an attack on the opposite side. However, Custap Berry allows Wobbuffet to somewhat bypass this with a faster Destiny Bond, although it has to be in the right HP range to work. Toxic Spikes from Forretress also badly mess up Wobbuffet. Using the sheer power that Pokemon such as Choice Specs Kyurem-W and Rayquaza possess can also help to eliminate Wobbuffet.</p> <p>This Ho-Oh set has no form of recovery outside of Regenerator, so Rapid Spin support from Forretress is a must. Using Wish support is also a good idea, as it gives Ho-Oh more switch-in opportunities, especially when Stealth Rock is up. Blissey is a notable Wish user, as it can pass Wishes so enormous that they will often fully heal Ho-Oh. Jirachi can also use Wish effectively and has access to U-turn, great bulk, and numerous resistances, including one to Rock-type attacks. If you are using Ho-Oh on a sand team, Excadrill can be a great partner thanks to its solid power deterring Ghost-types from switching in and access to Rapid Spin. However, using Ho-Oh on a sun team is best to power up Sacred Fire, and Groudon itself makes a great partner to Ho-Oh.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Ho-Oh's Defense might not seem like much, but when fully invested and with the assistance of Sacred Fire burns, the rainbow phoenix can take its fair share of physical abuse. This Ho-Oh aims to spread burns through Sacred Fire and act as an excellent pivot through Regenerator. Full investment in Defense allows Ho-Oh to take a myriad of physical attacks much more comfortably; Extreme Killer Arceus's +2 Extreme Speed, Rayquaza's +1 Outrage, Mewtwo's +1 Psystrike, and support Groudon's Stone Edge all fail to OHKO.</p> <p>Sacred Fire is needed to spread burns; Brave Bird is the other obligatory STAB attack, dealing respectable damage, even with minimal Attack investment. Substitute is the primary option to ease prediction and protect Ho-Oh from status. Earthquake can also be used to hit Heatran and the Rock-types that plague Ho-Oh. Whirlwind is another option to rack up hazard damage and scout switches; it is especially effective because Ho-Oh forces out a lot of Pokemon. Roost gives Ho-Oh some much needed longevity outside of switching out repeatedly. Roost can be used with a faster spread to absorb Ice-, Rock-, and Electric-type attacks.</p> <p>The EV spread is simple, as it maximizing Defense and maintains an odd HP number to round down Stealth Rock damage. The leftover EVs are placed in Attack to give a little kick to Sacred Fire and Brave Bird. Combined with Regenerator, this Ho-Oh can switch endlessly into both Giratina formes, only taking significant damage from invested Giratina-O's Outrage. Ho-Oh still has massive Special Defense, meaning it can perform its normal duties of switching into the powerful special attacks thrown about in Ubers.</p> <p>Like all other Ho-Oh sets, the removal of Stealth Rock is greatly appreciated; Forretress, Tentacruel, and Excadrill are all excellent spinners in Ubers. Groudon isn't nearly as necessary for this set as other Ho-Oh sets, as Sacred Fire's primary job is to spread burns. A physically defensive Ghost-type Pokemon, such as RestTalk Giratina-O, pairs excellently with this Ho-Oh, absorbing the weak attacks of burned Pokemon and phazing with Dragon Tail. Ferrothorn is also a great partner to this set, as it handles the majority of the Pokemon commonly found on rain teams and walls Choice Scarf Zekrom. Latias, Palkia, Chansey, and Blissey also make for great defensive partners, absorbing the few strong special attacks that Ho-Oh can't.</p> <p>This set still fears rain-boosted Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Kyogre and Palkia, in addition to Thunder, although the latter does not usually KO. Stone Edge from any offensively-inclined Pokemon will still KO Ho-Oh, although defensive Groudon has a chance not to. Jolly Choice Scarf Zekrom's Bolt Strike has a chance not to KO, but the KO with Adamant is still guaranteed.</p> <p>Thunder Wave can be used over one of the attacking options, as it is very annoying for opposing Ho-Oh and can cripple other threats that rely on their Speed, such as over-eager Choice Scarf Kyogre looking to switch in on Sacred Fire. Toxic is also viable, crippling Lugia and Arceus-Rock, two of Ho-Oh's greatest checks, but they don't exactly appreciate Thunder Wave either.</p>"

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo might initially seem like a terrible choice due to its poor movepool and subpar stats. However, Ludicolo gets Swift Swim, which doubles its Speed in rain, something easy to make use of as it is really common in Ubers due to the prevalence of Kyogre. Ludicolo might have a shallow movepool, but it attains great coverage from STAB Hydro Pump, Grass Knot, Ice Beam, and Focus Blast. Even Ferrothorn, the most popular Water-type resist in the tier, loses to Ludicolo as it is 2HKOed by Focus Blast. However, Ludicolo is no slouch defensively either. With its decent base 100 Special Defense and fantastic defensive typing, (which gives it weaknesses to Bug-, Flying-, and Poison-type attacks, all of which are rarely used in the Uber tier), Ludicolo can efficiently run a Leech Seed set. However, what really sets Ludicolo apart from its fellow Leech Seed users, such as Ferrothorn, is its access to Rain Dish, which heals Ludicolo's health by 6.25% per turn when it is raining. Ludicolo can potentially heal 25% of its health every turn factoring in Leech Seed, Leftovers, and Rain Dish. Ludicolo is also one of few Pokemon who can boast being able to check Choice Specs Kyogre. All in all, Ludicolo is probably the greatest example of the fact that appearances can be deceiving and every team ought to prepare for this pineapple or risk getting swept in its furious rampage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ludicolo does get access to Swords Dance, but with its frail defenses, it will not be able to set up and can still be walled even at +2. Scald can be used over Ice Beam on the SubSeed set to burn sweepers, but Ice Beam wards off Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Shaymin-S. Lastly, Giga Drain could be used over Grass Knot, but does significantly less damage than Grass Knot on average, as most Pokemon in Ubers are heavy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Groudon can change the weather and use Thunder Wave to cripple Ludicolo for the rest of the match, but it is 2HKOed by Grass Knot. Dialga makes a fantastic check to Ludicolo as it is rarely OHKOed by Focus Blast, while Ludicolo's other moves barely gash the Steel Dragon. Draco Meteor coming off Dialga's mammoth Special Attack stat will OHKO offensive Ludicolo variants factoring in Life Orb recoil, while the SubSeed variant takes a meaty 56.9% - 67%, assuming Dialga runs a Modest nature and 252 SpA EVs. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S outspeeds Ludicolo even when it is raining and can OHKO with a STAB Air Slash. Giratina can stomach two Ice Beams and either burn Ludicolo with Will-O-Wisp or phaze it out with Dragon Tail. Rayquaza resists every one of Ludicolo's moves except Ice Beam, cancels the weather, and KOes with STAB Outrage. Arceus-Grass can beat Ludicolo by bagging Calm Minds and Recovering off the damage. However, it does stand a chance of being beaten by offensive variants if it switches into Ice Beam and Ludicolo gets high damage rolls on the consecutive turns. Arceus-Bug can take a rain-boosted Hydro Pump from Ludicolo and OHKO back with Judgment. Ferrothorn can 2HKO the SubSeed set with Power Whip, but loses to the offensive set. If it is not raining, most Uber sweepers will outspeed offensive variants of Ludicolo and can OHKO it with a powerful attack such as Draco Meteor or Outrage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This is Ludicolo's standard offensive set. A Life Orb and rain-boosted STAB Hydro Pump will dent any Pokemon not named Blissey or Chansey. Surf can be used over Hydro Pump if the 80% accuracy gives you the jitters, but Ludicolo will usually want as much power as it can get. Grass Knot is an excellent choice in Ubers thanks to the heavyweights that infest the tier, and will usually be inflicting maximum damage. Ice Beam has great coverage in Ubers and will easily OHKO Rayquaza and Shaymin-S on the switch. Focus Blast is Ludicolo's only option against Ferrothorn, Dialga, and, to a lesser extent, Tyranitar, who all laugh at Ludicolo's other moves. Indeed, Ludicolo's greatest niche over other rain sweepers is its ability to beat Ferrothorn one-on-one. Focus Blast will 2HKO Ferrothorn, and Ludicolo is immune to Leech Seed and resistant to Gyro Ball. This set attains great coverage, resisted only by Shedinja, who is easily taken care of via Stealth Rock. As Ludicolo is not blessed with offensive stats similar to those of Dialga or Palkia, this set is best used as a mid-game revenge killer or a late-game sweeper, who can plow through teams once the walls have been weakened a bit.</p> <p>There is no point investing the EVs anywhere other than Ludicolo's Special Attack and Speed, because Ludicolo is rather frail anyway and would like to have maximum possible Speed and firepower. The choice of nature depends on whether you want Ludicolo to outspeed certain key threats or hit as hard as possible. With Timid, Ludicolo does lose a significant amount of power but gets the ability to outspeed certain threatening sweepers such as Choice Scarf Terrakion, Palkia, and even Adamant Kabutops.</p> <p>As Ludicolo relies heavily on rain for sweeping, Kyogre is absolutely necessary on the team due to its ability, Drizzle. Ludicolo is extremely susceptible to revenge killing by the likes of Rayquaza and Wobbuffet. Rayquaza cancels out the rain Ludicolo loves, can outpace Ludicolo, and OHKO with Draco Meteor or Outrage. Wobbuffet is not OHKOed by any of Ludicolo's moves and can OHKO in return with Mirror Coat. Darkrai and mixed Zekrom can handily beat Wobbuffet. The former is immune to Mirror Coat and can inflict major damage to Wobbuffet with a STAB Dark Pulse, while the latter can fire off powerful Bolt Strikes and Draco Meteors to take out Wobbuffet. Darkrai can also deal with Giratina, who is never 2HKOed by Ice Beam, can phaze out Ludicolo with Dragon Tail, then heal using Rest. Choice Scarf Palkia can outspeed and OHKO Rayquaza at +1 Speed with Spacial Rend. As Ludicolo isn't exactly an offensive powerhouse, entry hazards are useful in softening up walls such as Chansey and Blissey, who laugh at Ludicolo's attacks. Support Dialga, Forretress, and Ferrothorn thrive in the rain teams that Ludicolo calls home and can set up different types of hazards.</p>"
      },
      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<p>One might wonder why Ludicolo would make a better Leech Seed user over Ferrothorn, who has better defensive stats and typing, stronger offenses, and better support options. However, Ludicolo does have a few tricks up its sleeve that Ferrothorn would die for. Firstly, Rain Dish is an excellent ability in Ubers where rain is everywhere thanks to the abundance of Kyogre. With Leech Seed, Rain Dish, and Leftovers, Ludicolo can heal 25% of its HP in a single turn, allowing it to outstall numerous Pokemon such as Choice Kyogre and Palkia. Ludicolo is also never 2HKOed by a full-powered Water Spout from Modest Choice Specs Kyogre, something not even Chansey can boast of. Secondly, Ludicolo's defenses are nothing to laugh at and Grass / Water is an excellent defensive typing, providing an important 2x resist to Ground-type attacks and a crucial 4x resist to Water-type attacks. As this set causes numerous switches, Substitute is very useful for providing Ludicolo with status immunity, as well as the ability to beat Chansey and Blissey. On the other hand, Ice Beam allows Ludicolo to OHKO Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Salamence. Grass Knot helps Ludicolo deal with Groudon and offensive Kyogre, both of whom are 2HKOed, and is usually a reliable offensive option against the likes of Palkia and Mewtwo. Protect allows Ludicolo to get some free HP while inflicting some damage if the opponent has been seeded.</p> <p>The HP EVs are maxed out so that Ludicolo can take a few hits. 216 Special Defense EVs make sure Ludicolo is not 2HKOed by a Modest Choice Specs Kyogre's Thunder factoring in Rain Dish and Leftovers. The rest of the EVs are placed into Defense so that Ludicolo can take random physical attacks such as Earthquake from support Groudon, if needed. Ludicolo can run Toxic over Grass Knot, but that leaves it helpless against Pokemon such as Palkia who are neutral to Ice-type attacks. However, Ludicolo is no Blissey; it still takes a lot of damage from obscenely powerful special attacks such as Draco Meteor from mixed Rayquaza. Physical sweepers such as Rayquaza, Dialga, and Zekrom spell trouble for Ludicolo, because Outrage will easily KO it. Dialga is especially troublesome as it laughs at Grass Knot and Ice Beam. Rayquaza, however, must be particularly wary of switching into Ice Beam, which will OHKO it. Lugia is faster and can Toxic Ludicolo first or set up a Substitute. Ice Beam does piddling damage, which Lugia can easily Roost off and phaze out Ludicolo with Dragon Tail or Whirlwind. Arceus-Grass gets free set up turns unless Ludicolo carries Toxic. Ferrothorn can beat Ludicolo with Power Whip while taking pitiful damage from Ice Beam and being immune to Leech Seed and Toxic. Abomasnow can change the weather to hail and 2HKO with Wood Hammer. Dialga can beat all of these Pokemon using Fire Blast and can Roar out Arceus. As two layers of Toxic Spikes will cripple Ludicolo, Forretress and Tentacruel make good teammates thanks to their ability to both set up Toxic Spikes and remove them. Both also share good synergy with Ludicolo and find a good home on rain teams.</p>"

  "Sableye": {
    "overview": "<p>When looking at Sableye's stats, it seems as though it should have no place in Ubers. However, Sableye's awesome combination of a vast support movepool and Prankster enable it to function as a immensely useful supporter if used correctly. Prankster is a massive advantage that Sableye has over other Ubers utility Pokemon; it allows Sableye to fully invest in its bulk while outrunning some of the most eminent threats in the tier and smacking them with a Will-O-Wisp before they can strike back. Access to Foul Play only compounds this advantage, giving Sableye a tool to hit many opponents exceptionally hard without needing to worry about investment.</p> <p>Because of priority Will-O-Wisp, Sableye can serve as a formidable physical wall despite its terrible bulk; it is in its use that Sableye finds one of its more important niches: countering Extreme Killer Arceus. Because it's immune to Extreme Speed, Sableye can—assuming a hit—burn Arceus before it can hit back; even if Arceus uses Swords Dance on the switch, it can't OHKO, regardless of its item. That being said, Sableye's horrible special bulk holds it back. Priority Taunt is another reason that Sableye is so useful. By restricting defensive opponents' options, Sableye can function as an effective stallbreaker; for example, Sableye can completely shut down Forretress and the pink blobs with Taunt and by virtue of its Ghost typing, while Sleep Talkers are prevented from recovering and rendered helpless while they sleep. Sableye is an anti-metagame Pokemon thanks to said capabilities, and it is capable of handling entry hazard leads, Baton Pass teams, and stall teams on its own. Overall, Sableye must be played with caution, but in the right hands, it can be an effective tool against stall and offense alike.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Because of Sableye's extensive support movepool, it has several other options for moveslots. A myriad of miscellaneous support moves along the vein of Trick, Torment, and Knock Off could be run, but they force Sableye to give up one of its core moves. Night Shade could be used in place of Foul Play to hit special attackers harder, but it's generally ineffective due to the fact that most special attackers will slaughter Sableye. A Calm Mind and Will-O-Wisp set could be run to boost both defenses, but once again, a key move must be forfeited. A Substitute and Recover set faces a similar issue. While Moonlight may appear to be an attractive option in combination with sun, its inherent unreliability greatly outweighs the potential increase in survivability it could grant.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Sableye is hard countered by hard-hitting Fire-types, such as Blaziken, Reshiram, Ho-Oh, Heatran, and the rare Arceus-Fire; Ho-Oh needs to watch out for Foul Play, though, because offensive variants are OHKOed after Stealth Rock. In return, however, Ho-Oh can easily OHKO Sableye with a sun-boosted Sacred Fire. Heatran in particular works extremely well between its typing and specially offensive approach. Though Lava Plume cannot OHKO, it does a massive amount of damage and can leave Sableye with a problematic burn. Though not immune to Will-O-Wisp, Kyogre can OHKO Sableye with a rain-boosted STAB after Stealth Rock. Espeon and Xatu can both stop Sableye's annoyance by reflecting Taunt back at Sableye, but Foul Play does quite a number to both. A max Special Attack Arceus can OHKO Sableye with a neutral Judgment while fearing little in return. Essentially any special attacker, ranging from Dialga to Palkia to Kyogre, can take on Sableye and emerge victorious. Dialga easily switches in on Sableye and OHKOes with Draco Meteor, but a burn is detrimental to its otherwise formidable defenses. Likewise, Darkrai can check Sableye and 2HKO with Dark Pulse, but a burn will wear it down fairly quickly. As annoying as it is, Sableye doesn't pose a massive threat without walls to back it up; it can generally be outmaneuvered and without its teammates, you can usually just beat the crap out of it. Mixed attackers work especially well in this role, as often times they can bait a Will-O-Wisp and take Sableye out with a powerful special attack. Bear in mind, however, that they will emerge from the confrontation with a burn unless Will-O-Wisp misses. While a faster Prankster Taunt seems to be an effective strategy to counter Sableye, the two main users of it—Thundurus and Tornadus— would rather simply OHKO with a powerful Thunder or Hurricane. Heracross is another rare threat that fears nothing from Sableye; Will-O-Wisp gives it a Guts boost and it can easily shrug off a Foul Play. Entry hazards are another approach, especially Toxic Spikes; while it's nearly impossible to directly status Sableye unless it's unexpected, Toxic poison is an extremely effective way to take it down, compromising what little bulk it has and preventing it from annoying for long.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Prankster": {
        "description": "<p>Sableye's dangerous combination of Prankster, key support moves, and fair effective physical bulk thanks to Will-O-Wisp enables it to be a powerful tool for combating offensive and defensive threats. The moveset is fairly obvious, but every move plays a part. Foul Play and Priority Will-O-Wisp allow Sableye to hold its own against a wide variety of physical threats, including Excadrill, Groudon, and Extreme Killer Arceus. Once burned, the opponent can't boost up to try to break Sableye without taking a powerful Foul Play—for instance, a burned Extreme Killer Arceus is easily OHKOed by Foul Play at +4, while Sableye can otherwise easily stall out its attacks with Recover. Priority Taunt lets Sableye break down stall in conjunction with entry hazards by preventing the opponent from recovering or laying entry hazards, while against hyper offense it allows Sableye to prevent setup sweeps, though Sableye's lack of bulk means that in such a situation it will often end up taking loads of damage. It also allows Sableye to function as a potent anti-lead, due to the fact that it neuters Deoxys-S and gives you breathing room against Darkrai if necessary. Finally, Sableye is a decent spinblocker. Defensive Excadrill's Substitute is broken by Foul Play and Forretress can be shut down with Taunt. When using Sableye, however, it's important to gauge the advantages that another spinblocker could bring. Sableye's bulk pales in comparison to that of the other Ubers spinblockers, and its cardinal role is annoyer, not spinblocker. Sableye is notably one of the only Pokemon that can guarantee success against Baton Pass in any form, due to priority Taunt shutting down any attempts to pass boosts.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes physical bulk. Generally, Sableye should not serve as a part of a team's defensive core—its capacity for taking hits simply isn't up to par with other contenders like Ho-Oh, Kyogre, and Ferrothorn. Rather, a separate core should exist with Sableye aiding in shutting down sweepers and keeping entry hazards up if played well. Sableye can only spinblock if used with extreme care and correct prediction. All of the Rapid Spinners in Ubers have weapons with which they can eliminate Sableye easily otherwise—Forretress can use Toxic and Excadrill, Tentacruel, and Kabutops can all 2HKO, though the latter two require weather to be in their favor. Sableye requires entry hazard control to function as well; any form of residual damage is detrimental to Sableye's ability to take a hit on the switch. Finally, Sableye also appreciates cleric support to remedy status resulting from mispredictions. In the case of Toxic Spikes, it can also alleviate the imminent problem of constant Toxic poison; however, Rapid Spin support or a Poison-type teammate to swiftly remove Toxic Spikes is required, such as that from Excadrill, Forretress, or Tentacruel.</p> <p>A specially defensive spread could be used to beat Tentacruel and some Mewtwo, but doing so greatly weakens Sableye's ability to take on physical attackers, and is thus unwise. Likewise, Toxic could be run over Will-O-Wisp to break down opponents faster and to hit Ho-Oh, but it forfeits Sableye's niche. In general, it's best to just stick to the original set.</p> <p>When using Sableye, remember not to underestimate its ability to take physical hits; you can easily come in on offensive Excadrill, burn it, recover HP, and use Foul Play with no chance of dying barring a critical hit or a Will-O-Wisp miss. An important thing to note is that Sableye itself does not have good bulk. Rather, it is its access to priority Will-O-Wisp that indirectly grants it the ability to sponge attacks from physical attackers. Sableye is an excellent addition to hyper offense teams, keeping entry hazards up when utilized correctly and neutering physical cleaners that hyper offense teams tend to struggle with. Sableye's priority Taunt means that it pairs up well with a spinner in teams that absolutely require a lack of entry hazards. Because of its spinblocking ability and tendency to force switches, Sableye works best on a team whose focus is taking advantage of entry hazards. Sableye also forms an excellent core with Ferrothorn, due to several factors. Firstly—and most obviously—Ferrothorn's key proactive ability is laying Spikes, which Sableye can usually keep on the field. However, as has been noted previously, excellent prediction is required to spinblock successfully. Secondly, between Leech Seed, Will-O-Wisp, Iron Barbs, and Spikes, the opponent will also be taking an immense amount of residual damage; this residual damage is rendered even more deadly when combined with Sableye's ability to shut down recovery. Thirdly, Sableye's Will-O-Wisp in conjunction with Ferrothorn's bulk and typing will usually mean that any physical attacker that lacks a Fire-type move will be powerless against the duo.</p> <p>Weather has an interesting effect on Sableye's utility. If on a weather team, Sableye should only ever be used with sun or rain, as residual damage to Sableye of any kind is detrimental to Sableye's main goal. When running sun, Sableye can take advantage of its newfound ability to take on Tentacruel. However, the weather gives a boost to opposing Fire-types, which are inconveniently immune to Will-O-Wisp. Meanwhile, rain cripples the aforementioned Fire-types. Kyogre as a teammate is very beneficial to Sableye; it has the capacity to take many of the special hits that Sableye cannot and shares stupendous synergy with Ferrothorn, one of Sableye's best partners. However, it guarantees that any opposing Tentacruel and Kabutops will be able to muscle through Sableye, compromising its ability to spinblock against the two should it be necessary.</p>"

Dragon-type attacks are only resisted by one type in the game, Steel, thus making this combo very hard to stop. Either Rayquaza or Salamence can soften opposing Steel-types, allowing the other to wreak havoc on the opponent's team. However, sharing the same typing does have its drawbacks. Being weak to common Dragon- and Ice-type attacks is not pleasant at all. Moreover, both are weak to Stealth Rock and hurt badly by common priority moves, such as Bullet Punch and Extreme Speed, thus both require a lot of team support.</p> <p>Salamence's offensive stats and typing make it an amazing sweeper. With base 135 Attack, access to Dragon Dance, and a very wide movepool with good coverage, it's guaranteed that the flying salamander will be a nightmare for many teams. Moxie, Salamence's Dream World ability, grants an Attack boost each time Salamence kills an opponent, and with the aforementioned qualities, it's more than likely to happen. Salamence might be a forgotten wonder, but don't let its rarity fool you, as it is definitely a deadly force in Ubers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Salamence can run a mixed set very well, as it gets access to many amazing offensive moves, such as Draco Meteor, Outrage, Earthquake, Fire Blast, and Brick Break. However, such a set is outclassed by Rayquaza, who has better offensive stats and priority in Extreme Speed. Salamence can learn one move that Rayquaza can't: Roost, which is an amazing reliable recovery move, especially on offensive Pokemon. In the Ubers environment, however, Salamence will likely not get the chance to Roost. In the rain, 4 SpA Hydro Pump 2HKOes specially defensive Skarmory and Forretress, and OHKOes Heatran. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast if you don't want to risk a miss, but the loss in power is very significant. Crunch is another option if you wish to hit Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon harder, but Outrage is strong enough, and Crunch's coverage is very narrow. Furthermore, a neutral Outrage is stronger than a 2x super effective Crunch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Salamence is very versatile, it doesn't have many counters. However, because Salamence shares the same typing as Rayquaza, they both have similar counters. The best way to take on Salamence is by forcing it to use Outrage, and then switch to a bulky Steel-type such as Skarmory, Bronzong, or Arceus-Steel. Skarmory and Bronzong can Toxic Salamence; additionally, the former can Roost the damage off and phaze Salamence away with Whirlwind, and the latter can hit Salamence very hard with either Hidden Power Ice or Gyro Ball. Arceus-Steel can burn Salamence with Will-O-Wisp, set up Calm Minds on it, and Recover the damage it has taken. Arceus-Steel is also capable of phazing by using Roar, or it can limit Salamence's outrageous sweep by using Perish Song.</p> <p>Timid Lugia with maximum Speed EVs can outspeed a Salamence and OHKO with Ice Beam, but it risks being OHKOed by a +1 Stone Edge. The Great Wall Lugia, however, only has 28.21% chance of being OHKOed by +1 Stone Edge after Stealth Rock damage, making it a decent counter. In return, Lugia can phaze Salamence with Dragon Tail or Whirlwind, cripple it with Thunder Wave, or go for the kill with Ice Beam. Lugia can also heal itself with Recover or Roost. Cresselia falls in the same boat as Lugia; she can take a +1 Outrage, heal herself with Moonlight, and cripple Salamence with Thunder Wave or simply finish it off with Ice Beam. Groudon also makes a solid counter, as it only takes 64.85% maximum from a +1 Outrage, and from there either phaze with Dragon Tail, OHKO Salamence with Stone Edge after Stealth Rock damage, or cripple Salamence with Thunder Wave. Any bulky Arceus forme except Arceus-Dragon can burn Salamence or phaze it; as mentioned, Arceus-Steel is the best option.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Garchomp and Shaymin-S outspeed +1 Salamence and can OHKO with Outrage or Hidden Power Ice, respectively. Choice Scarf Palkia can also OHKO Salamence with Spacial Rend or Draco Meteor, but risks losing the Speed tie with +1 Salamence. Mamoswine and Weavile, though extremely rare, don't mind Salamence's Speed boost because their 4x super effective STAB Ice Shard will always strike first, bypassing Salamence's boosts. Salamence is weak to Stealth Rock; each switch-in strips it of 25% of its health, so if you can keep them on the field, Salamence will have a hard time setting up and sweeping. Moreover, Salamence's defenses aren't high, so priority moves from the likes of Scizor and Arceus will wear it down quickly.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>While this set may seem outclassed by Garchomp and Palkia, Salamence has one great advantage over them: its newly introduced ability, Moxie. Choice Scarf Salamence reaches a blazing Speed of 492, which outpaces many top threats in Ubers, such as Deoxys-A, Darkrai, Mewtwo, and Shaymin-S. It also Speed ties with Palkia, the most common Choice Scarf user. The point in this set is to surprise the opponent, such as in a situation where the opponent has a boosted Mewtwo packing Ice Beam at 80% of its health. Salamence's base Speed is lower than Mewtwo's, so the opponent will likely leave Mewtwo out, and then will be shocked as his genetic Pokemon is OHKOed by Outrage. But it doesn't stop there! After Salamence has killed one of the opponent's Pokemon, its Dream World ability activates, and boosts its Attack by one stage. Dragon Claw is Salamence's best choice against a weakened opponent, as it doesn't lock Salamence or leave it confused. Fire Blast and Earthquake are fillers, but they have perfect coverage with Salamence's Dragon-type STAB moves.</p> <p>A Naive nature is used to make Salamence as fast as possible, while not lowering its Special Attack, so Fire Blast will not lose power. Moxie is the preferred ability as it is this set's niche in Ubers. Dragon Dance is not needed anyway, thus Moxie is the superior ability. The EVs are straightforward: maximize Salamence's Attack so Outrage will hit as hard as possible, and maximize Salamence's Speed so it will outrun as many foes as it can. A Naughty nature can be used if you wish to strike the opponent harder, but it will cost you some Speed, meaning you will be slower than Choice Scarf Dialga, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and +1 Rayquaza, which might cost Salamence's sweep.</p> <p>When Salamence utilizes a Choice Scarf, it becomes a great cleaner, so before you send in Salamence, you will want to stack some damage on the opponent. There are a few ways to do so. Entry hazards will put a lot of pressure on the opponent; Stealth Rock and Spikes in particular can take 50% maximum out of the opponent's health, making Salamence's job much easier. Hard hitters, such as Choice Specs Dialga, Choice Specs Palkia, Choice Band Zekrom, and more, also do this well. Mixed Rayquaza once again is an amazing partner, as it can lure out many physical walls, such as Groudon and Lugia, and hit them hard with Draco Meteor. Salamence's weaknesses to Ice-, Rock-, and Dragon-type moves make Steel-type Pokemon great partners, as they resist all of Salamence's weakness. Scizor deserves a special mention here as well, as it can utilize U-turn to bring Salamence in safely. Stone Edge can be used over Earthquake or Fire Blast in order to pick off Flying-types, such as Lugia and Ho-Oh. Draco Meteor can be used over Dragon Claw to surprise Groudon and Lugia, but the stat drops make Salamence setup bait.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Salamence's combination of Speed, ability, and typing allow it to be a potent sweeper, capable of swiftly setting up and stealing the opponent's momentum. Once it has set up, Salamence is nigh unstoppable due to its excellent coverage; this is augmented by its excellent base 100 Speed, which allows it to outspeed many of the common Uber Choice Scarf users at +1. Unfortunately, without a boost Salamence's Attack is noticeably lacking when compared to Uber behemoths like Groudon, Zekrom, and Rayquaza. The choice of ability will help Salamence either get going or stay going; Moxie enables Salamence to break through walls that would ordinarily be able to sponge its attacks, while Intimidate is immensely helpful while setting up. Without Intimidate, Salamence has an incredibly hard time setting up without Wobbuffet or dual screens support, but without Moxie it can be difficult to put a full-fledged sweep into action. Really, it's up to personal preference, although in general Intimidate tends to be more effective due to its utility.</p> <p>Due to Salamence's apparent inferiority in this role to Rayquaza, many would choose to run the latter if picking between the two. Because of this, the best way to utilize Dragon Dance Salamence is as a partner to Rayquaza. The reasoning behind this logic goes as follows: the opponent will rarely carry more than one hard check to the generic \"Dragon Dancing Dragon / Flying type\"; by carrying both Salamence and Rayquaza, one can overwhelm this check by way of sheer pressure and force. Any variant of Rayquaza will do, really, but they all perform slightly different roles: mixed shreds Salamence's counters to pieces, Dragon Dance aims to get rid of its own checks (and, by extension, Salamence's), and Swords Dance works like a combination of the two.</p> <p>Max Speed is incredibly important for Dragon Dance Salamence, as going lower will open it up to all sorts of revenge killers at +1. This is especially important for beating Genesect; at +1 Attack, Salamence outspeeds and 2HKOes it on the switch. At +2—presumably attained by Moxie after a kill—Genesect is outsped and OHKOed. This is one of the biggest reasons to use Salamence over, say, Rayquaza. While Salamence lacks the raw mixed attacking power of our favorite meteorological serpent, its higher Speed means that it can assuredly avoid revenge kills from common Choice Scarf users like Genesect and Kyurem-W. Unfortunately for Salamence, its high Speed means nothing against priority, nor can its paltry bulk stand up to many of the powerful revenge killers that still outrun it at +1.</p> <p>Within Salamence's diverse movepool, there are several alternate move choices that are viable. Because of their similar coverage, Brick Break and Earthquake are somewhat interchangeable; Brick Break allows Salamence to hit Chansey without locking itself into Outrage and to break Ferrothorn at +2 regardless of weather. It also hits Air Balloon Heatran which, though rare, is nonetheless a threat. Earthquake has more general utility, however, as it hits threats like Jirachi, Arceus-Steel, and Dialga harder. Stone Edge and Aqua Tail could be used to hit Lugia and Skarmory (under rain) hard, respectively. However, Salamence's need for neutral coverage usually discourages this choice—no matter what one does, running one of them will cause certain walls to be able to counter Salamence with increased ease. Finally, Dragon Claw could be run over Outrage to pick off miscellaneous Dragon-types that Salamence conveniently outspeeds. However, such a role is better left to a Choice Scarf set; Dragon Claw simply lacks the raw power that Dragon Dance Salamence requires to sweep.</p> <p>While Dragon Dance Salamence greatly appreciates the boost that Life Orb grants it, other items deserve mention due to their ability to enhance Salamence's ability to set up. Lum Berry allows Salamence to shrug off miscellaneous status; this can be pivotal when Salamence requires a free turn to set up or land an attack. Dragon Gem could also be used to get the ball rolling, due to the powerful Outrage that it grants Salamence (so powerful, in fact, that it OHKOes specially defensive Giratina at +0!). When running one of these items, it's still important to provide Salamence with plenty of opportunities to set up. Though it will be easier, getting a sweep going still requires near-perfect timing when using something as frail as Salamence.</p> <p>Due to its relative lack of offensive power, Salamence greatly appreciates hazards to facilitate its sweep. Deoxys-S is a great choice for setting these up, being able to provide both hazards and screens; especially when running Moxie, dual screens give Salamence the opportunities it needs to set up effectively. Forretress, Skarmory, and Groudon are also viable partners. Forretress and Skarmory have excellent defensive synergy with Salamence, being able to sponge Extreme Speeds and Scarf Dragon-type attacks. Forretress also has the notable ability to spin, which is incredibly useful due to Salamence's frailty and weakness to Stealth Rock. Groudon powers up Fire Blast, as well as being able to take priority aimed at Salamence.</p> <p>When running Salamence, it's important to recognize that its lack of power means that it has several counters that need to be accounted for. Groudon can give this set major problems, especially if it's carrying Stone Edge. Wallceus, Skarmory in rain, and Lugia can all counter Salamence as well; Skarmory in particular is one of the few things that can stall out a +2 Outrage, even after Stealth Rock. This is where carrying Rayquaza along with Salamence is helpful. When running Dragon Dance Salamence, a mixed, Swords Dance, or even Dragon Dance Rayquaza can come in immensely handy for dealing with these opponents; due to its ability to carry different coverage moves and sheer attacking power, all of the threats mentioned above can be dealt with with relative ease.</p>"

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>Too long has Latias shied away from the embattled Uber tier, for with the aid of her precious Soul Dew, her time is at hand. From nothing into something, Latias makes her triumphant return. To the horror of every Kyogre, Latias can now use her numerous resistances, fantastic ability, and excellent Speed to their maximum potential. She isn't just an offensive pivot; Latias can be a balanced all-out attacker, a potent sweeper, or an exceptional special wall. Although her brother Latios is far more offensively inclined, her bulk is more than enough to make up for her relative power. However, Soul Dew is not the perfect solution. Her weaknesses to Dragon-, Ice-, Bug-, Ghost-, and Dark-type attacks remain a hindrance, and her physical bulk is only average at best. But none of this is enough to put a damper on her bright spirit; Latias is the rising star of the Uber tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As one of the most versatile Pokemon in the Uber tier, Latias will almost always have something that appeals to what needs to be done. If a dual screens user is needed, why not consider Latias? Combined with Light Clay, she can reliably set up dual screens and then sacrifice herself with Healing Wish to give a damaged sweeper another crack. Interested in a Kyogre-checking Wish supporter? Why not use Latias, who boasts incredible longevity and Levitate? Or for a bit of daring, why not maximize Latias's excellent base 110 Speed with a Choice Scarf and Trick? And with so many niche moves that she can use to reasonable success, there are plenty of options to choose from: Psycho Shift, Safeguard, Thunder Wave, Magic Coat, Reflect, Hidden Power Fighting, Double Team, Charm, DragonBreath, Sucker Punch, Mist Ball, Icy Wind, Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Protect, and RestTalk; Latias has a combination of utility moves for any scenario.</p> <p>That said, Latias is often outclassed in these roles: Deoxys-S, Latios, Cresselia, or even Deoxys for dual screens; Chansey, Blissey, or Jirachi for Wish support; and almost every single notable Dragon-type used in Ubers for Choice Scarf. Still, Latias can fill pretty much any utility role on a team, and if there's one that fits, use it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Latias is a very fun Pokemon to use; she isn't as fun to face. Her only true counter is Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost, who boasts greater Speed, reliable recovery, and the ability to either OHKO with Shadow Force or at worst 2HKO with Shadow Claw. Any other checks are dependent on the selection of both her moves and set.</p> <p>When playing against Latias, be wary of mindlessly switching in. When combined with sufficient entry hazard support, Roar will quickly whittle the health of most checks down; she can potentially overpower these weakened checks later during the game. As such, checks who have obscure weak points and either Pursuit or reliable recovery will generally perform the most consistently. Unless met with Grass Knot on the switch-in, Tyranitar can easily weather Latias's attacks, checkmating with Pursuit or Crunch. Swords Dance Arceus-Bug with X-Scissor performs similarly to Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost, but is severely damaged on the switch-in by sun-boosted Hidden Power Fire. Multiscale Lugia, preferably specially defensive, can use Toxic and either phaze or stall her with impunity, but once damaged, even it will fall to consecutive rain Thunders on the switch.</p> <p>The remaining checks to Latias are less consistent, as they either have noticeable weak points, only work against certain sets, are easily worn down, or are predominately revenge killers. It's not a bad idea to carry more than one of these checks to fully address Latias; if one check goes down against a certain set, the others can still potentially defeat her. This also combats her ability to defeat checks through attrition. Speaking of attrition, this can be used against her; without Leftovers, Latias can eventually be worn down through residual damage. However, working against her Levitate makes this easier said than done, as she is immune to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Steel-types are solid checks to Latias, only fearing attrition or her weather-reliant Hidden Power Fire, Thunder, or Surf in accordance to their secondary typing. Genesect and Scizor are the most notable, placing a halt to most sweeps with their STAB U-turn and possible Pursuit. Both Jirachi and Heatran wall her when placed in favorable weather. Ferrothorn is a huge annoyance to Latias lacking Substitute or the aforementioned Hidden Power Fire, stacking hazards with almost complete impunity. Bulky Excadrill can easily tank her STAB attacks and retaliate with Earthquake. Although rare, Metagross can checkmate Substitute-lacking Latias with Meteor Mash or Pursuit.</p> <p>Support Arceus-Dark and utility counter Arceus-Psychic with Payback easily defeat any Latias lacking Roar. Extreme Killer Arceus 2HKOes with Extreme Speed, but cannot safely switch into an all-out attacker Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock. Calm Mind Arceus formes such as Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Psychic, Arceus-Steel, Arceus-Ghost, Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Ice, and Arceus-Bug generally check offensive pivot and all-out attacker quite well. Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Psychic are the most consistent; Steel Arceus outspeeds with Roar but is vulnerable to last-Pokemon Psyshock or sun-boosted Hidden Power Fire; Arceus-Ghost and Arceus-Rock under sandstorm are unable to defeat Psyshock variants at all; Arceus-Ice and Arceus-Bug are similar but have vulnerabilities to both Stealth Rock and sun-boosted Hidden Power Fire. However, all Calm Mind Arceus have issues against the specially defensive set. They also cannot defeat Roar defensive Calm Mind; Arceus-Steel, the only exception, fights last-Pokemon Latias to a stalemate.</p> <p>Any faster Pokemon who is capable of OHKOing Latias can act as a revenge killer. These consist of strong physical Choice Scarf users such as Zekrom, Kyurem-B, Outrage Palkia, and Heracross, and those with natural Speed advantage such as Swords Dance Arceus-Dragon and Outrage Kingdra under rain. Strong priority users such as Giratina-O and Mamoswine can also pick off weakened Latias. Darkrai can Dark Void and attempt to set up, but if Sleep Clause is activated or she already has a Calm Mind or Light Screen up, then its chance of victory will be slim.</p> <p>Should Latias lack Psyshock or Refresh, Chansey and Blissey with their ridiculous special bulk can stop most sweeps. Wobbuffet can use her as setup bait, but has a vulnerability to entry hazards and cannot actually defeat Latias. Ho-Oh can possibly be a fantastic check with its terrific special bulk and Regenerator, but its vulnerability to Stealth Rock along with Surf, Thunder, and Psyshock limits its potential. Sucker Punch Bisharp forces Latias out, but its paltry special bulk ensures that it won't be able to do so consistently.</p>",

      "Classic": {
        "description": "<p>Although Latias is traditionally defensive in nature, do not be deceived; she can act as an incredible offensive pivot in her own right. Excelling in the ability to switch into a multitude of threats, such as Kyogre and several Calm Mind Arceus, Latias immediately places offensive pressure in the form of either a possible Calm Mind or attack. Although she does not grab the greatest initial momentum out of all Latias sets, she has the potential to grab the most momentum due to Calm Mind and heavy offensive investment.</p> <p>After a single Calm Mind, Latias is capable of dealing more damage to the opponent than any other set while also giving her the potential to sweep. Dragon Pulse is a reliable STAB attack, dealing considerable damage thanks to her heavy Special Attack investment. Roost grants Latias reliable recovery, essential for maintaining her health and for checking threats. For her last slot, both options are useful for their utility against Kyogre. Thunder is the preferred option thanks to its superior coverage against Steel-type Pokemon such as Genesect and Scizor. However, if Latias needs to deal with opposing Calm Mind users, Psyshock will allow her to hit the opponent's unboosted Defense stat, winning any and all Calm Mind wars. It also allows her to beat Chansey, Blissey, and Terrakion more effectively.</p> <p>Being an offensive pivot, having as much Speed and Special Attack as possible is critical. The Speed is necessary for outspeeding the maximum number of threats, while the Special Attack is necessary for KOs and increasing overall offensive pressure. As such, Latias's EV spread emphasizes offense in favor of bulk, guaranteeing an OHKO on Palkia regardless of Stealth Rock as well as allowing her to Speed tie with opposing positive base 110 Speed Pokemon like Latios. Even with her weakened focus on bulk, she still possesses excellent special bulk; her special bulk is greater than support Arceus-Grass.</p> <p>Even in the constrained role of an offensive pivot, Latias remains flexible. EVs can easily be taken from Speed and invested in bulk depending on personal preference. 60 HP / 208 SpA / 240 Spe with a Timid nature can be run if outspeeding Terrakion is the only concern, while 100 HP / 216 SpA / 192 Spe with a Timid nature can be run for outspeeding Garchomp. Feel free to take away even more EVs from her Speed, but do recall that taking too much Speed away is counterproductive to her purpose. Likewise, EVs can be moved Special Attack to HP for increased bulk. However, it's largely counterproductive; the heavy Special Attack investment is crucial for increasing her offensive threat. Without the listed investment, not only is Dragon Pulse weakened, but she also loses some critical power on her coverage move. Notably, at least 204 EVs are required to OHKO Forretress with Thunder after Stealth Rock damage. If bulk is really at a premium, running the Defensive Calm Mind set may be more effective.</p> <p>Although Latias is offensively focused, her slots remain readily adaptable. If Calm Mind's offensive power isn't needed, Tailwind doubles the speed of the rest of the team. This allows her to possibly retain momentum even after she switches out. Hidden Power Fire loses utility against Kyogre, but incinerates opposing Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Excadrill under sun. However, it's weather dependent, does negligible damage to Heatran and Ho-Oh, and comes at the cost of losing the Speed tie against other positive base 110s. Surf on the other hand maintains her ability to Speed tie with these Pokemon as well as having greater Base Power so that it still damages Steel-type Pokemon considerably. For example, Surf always 2HKOes specially defensive Scizor after Stealth Rock. However, it too is weather dependent as well as being ineffective against opposing Ferrothorn. For those seeking to maintain their utility against Kyogre, Grass Knot is a possible option while also being significantly more effective against Tyranitar and Groudon. However, its lesser coverage against Steel-type Pokemon in comparison with Thunder hurts its viability. Similarly, Thunderbolt can be used over Thunder for its greater accuracy outside of rain, but its lesser power along with the prevalence of rain makes it a situational option at best.</p> <p>Latias has two main issues as offensive pivot: low initial bulk and restraint on coverage. Due to her lowered bulk, Choice and Thunder Wave variants of Kyogre can prove problematic. Most notably, Choice Scarf Ice Beam is an almost guaranteed 2HKO after Stealth Rock; this is a serious problem given that any Latias caught on the switch will hamper momentum. Similarly, a full power Choice Specs Water Spout forces a mindgame as Latias is only able to attack or Roost; Calm Mind is not an option due to the high risk of being 2HKOed. Her lack of bulk also hurts her ability to safely take on Calm Mind sweepers such as Arceus-Electric who heavily invest in Speed and Special Attack.</p> <p>Latias suffers from a lack of coverage. Although she can get past many of her checks with the right coverage move, she only gets one. As such, Latias will always be left helpless against certain checks. Even then, U-turn users such as Genesect will always force her to switch out, seriously harming her ability to sweep.</p> <p>To utilize Latias to her maximum potential, play to her strengths. Due to her offensive pivot nature, she fits best on teams with an offensive focus. Avoid placing her on teams with a more defensive focus or even balanced, as her lack of bulk against threats such as Choice Specs Kyogre will prove disappointing.</p> <p>Provided she is placed on an offensive team, Latias does not need to be used with any specific Pokemon. She acts as an amazing glue Pokemon by filling crucial gaps in teams. For instance, most offensive teams find Kyogre problematic and cannot afford to run Pokemon such as Gastrodon or Arceus-Grass due to their inferior offensive pressure. These teams greatly appreciate Latias's Speed, Special Attack, and still excellent special bulk, especially as she carries reliable recovery and Calm Mind unlike Palkia. However, Latias greatly dislikes switch-ins who carry super effective attacks, like Genesect, so Pokemon who resist her weaknesses make great teammates. Depending on the team, good choices might include Steel-types such as Arceus-Steel and Forretress, or it might include Pokemon with more situational typing like Ho-Oh and Arceus-Fighting. Speaking of switch-ins, many offensive Pokemon are capable of utilizing her forced switches to pose an immediate threat. Genesect, Kyogre, and Groudon are some of the many Pokemon who happen to be particularly good at this role. Similarly, entry hazard support is great for taking full advantage of her ability to force switches as well as increasing the chance of her KOs. Finally, make sure her coverage problem is addressed in some form. For instance, if Latias lacks Hidden Power Fire, have a method of dealing with Ferrothorn such as Xatu, who coincidentally also provides Magic Bounce support for the rest of the team.</p>"

      "Defensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>While this Latias may lack good coverage and may not be as instantly powerful as most Uber Dragons, her excellent special bulk and speed make a defensive Calm Mind set very viable.</p> <p>For the short-term, Latias focuses on disruption, handling threats, and warring through attrition. Do not attempt to sweep early-game; she has too many checks who can stop her at this stage. Instead, focus on using her fantastic special bulk to easily come into threats such as Kyogre and Calm Mind Arceus. From there, proceed to wear the opponent's team down. Dragon Pulse acts as her reliable STAB attack, doing respectable damage despite the lack of investment. Calm Mind acts as her utility against opposing Calm Mind users, while Roost increases her longevity. Her last slot is an extension of her overall purpose. Roar handles opposing setup sweepers along with weakening most switch-ins, providing there is sufficient entry hazard support. Refresh maintains vitality by curing her of detrimental status, granting utility against status users like Gliscor. Substitute eases prediction, providing an opportunity to scout, damage, or switch regardless of Pursuit.</p> <p>Only when the time is right, when the opponent's team is sufficiently weakened, does Latias come in to finally sweep. Calm Mind acts as her win condition, dramatically increasing her potential so that she becomes a force to be reckoned with. Roar phazes any opposing Calm Mind user who dares set up Calm Mind alongside her, allowing her to proceed unheeded. Refresh crushes any team that now only has status to defeat Latias. Substitute protects her from most non-damaging moves as well as allowing her to stall out low PP attacks, which can enable her to defeat foes such as Ferrothorn.</p> <p>The longer Latias is able to last throughout the match, the better her chances of sweeping. As much bulk as possible is necessary for outlasting the opponent, setting up Calm Minds, and for using her non-attacking moves to their highest potential. Yet when Latias is finally able to sweep, she needs to be able to outspeed the maximum number of threats. As such, her EV spread provides the maximum amount of bulk possible while still maintaining the Speed necessary to Speed tie with opposing positive base 110 Speed Pokemon like Latios. The invested bulk also ensures that Kyogre's Choice Scarf Ice Beam is virtually unable to 2HKO after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Just like the teams she can fit on, Latias's EV spread is flexible. EVs can be diverted from HP to Special Attack if more power is warranted. 216 HP / 40 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature trades a bit of bulk for the ability to OHKO Palkia after Stealth Rock. However, taking too many EVs away from HP compromises her bulk, diminishing her ability to last throughout the match. Heavy investment in Special Attack will leave her with inadequate bulk, limited coverage, and a non-attacking move that is only situationally effective; a more offensive Latias set is the better option. Similarly, EVs can be diverted away from her Speed and into her power and bulk. 252 HP / 40 SpA / 24 SpD / 192 Spe with a Timid nature can be run if the only concern is outspeeding Garchomp, guaranteeing an OHKO on Palkia after Stealth Rock along with some extra special bulk. Feel free to take away even more Speed EVs, but note that the lesser Speed makes it more difficult to sweep; this is counterproductive for her purpose. If the team calls for a very bulky Latias, specially defensive is the superior option.</p> <p>Although Latias's other moves are mandatory for her sweeping purpose, her last slot can run a rather unique option—Reflect Type. By copying the opponent's typing, not only does it allow her to switch into Kyogre's Choice Specs Ice Beam after Stealth Rock, but also completely changes her checks. For example, Tyranitar is unable to Pursuit her effectively. A Genesect or Scizor switch-in will find their U-turn or Pursuit ineffective, instead granting momentum to Latias. Ferrothorn will now find its Leech Seed and other attacks useless, leaving it setup bait. However, Reflect Type is a situational move; more often than not will it be complete deadweight against teams that lack Pokemon who Latias can benefit from. Reflect Type can also backfire to disastrous results; once it has been revealed, it can be played around.</p> <p>Due to her emphasis in bulk, Latias has a deficiency in offense. This leaves her initial offensive pressure quite poor in comparison with her more offensive sets; she doesn't grab momentum nearly as easily. Do not expect any immediate results, for Latias needs to find the right time to set up Calm Minds for offensive impact. This problem is further augmented by her lack of coverage. Although this issue is worked around when she finally sweeps, this does not mean it is resolved in the short-term. Her checks are still as annoying as ever should they not be weakened and safely switched in, especially since she lacks the coverage to immediately get rid of them. For example, Genesect with its U-turn will always force Latias to switch out should she lack a Substitute.</p> <p>Certain issues against Kyogre remain despite the increased level of bulk. Although she is still capable of defeating Calm Mind Kyogre one-on-one, it's nowhere even close to the ease offensive pivot experiences. Should she lack Roar, significantly more time will be required, increasing her chance of losing to an unfortunate critical hit or detrimental status; this problem is similarly seen against other opposing Calm Mind users. Likewise, Thunder Wave Kyogre proves a hassle should she lack Refresh. What's more, Latias still suffers from the Choice Specs Kyogre mindgame, since though Water Spout is now manageable, Ice Beam is still far too powerful for Latias to handle without Reflect Type.</p> <p>Latias shines when she is used strategically for long-term benefit. She fits best on teams that take their time, such as stall, Spikes-stacking, and balanced. It is unwise to place her on teams that demand extreme offensive bias, as her initial offensive pressure is unable to keep up with their pace.</p> <p>Only entry hazard support is mandatory when using this set as they are crucial for capitalizing on her ability to force switches as well as wearing down the opponent's team. Otherwise, Latias doesn't require any other specific team support, instead acting as a fantastic glue Pokemon by providing both a win condition as well as considerable threat checking utility. However, as Latias is dependent on entry hazards, spinblockers such as Arceus-Ghost, Giratina, and Giratina-O can prove great teammates despite common weaknesses, especially since they provide a convenient resistance to Bug-type attacks. Early-game Latias still dislikes switch-ins who manage to switch in with super effective attacks, like Genesect, so Pokemon who resist her weaknesses are great teammates. Good choices can range from Jirachi to Heatran and Ferrothorn to Forretress, many of whom happen to provide valuable entry hazard support. Carrying a physical wall such as Wallceus or Skarmory is also wise for taking on physical threats like Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost. Finally, because she lacks offensive coverage, make sure to have a game plan against her checks in the short-term. For instance, should Ferrothorn safely switch in on a Latias lacking Substitute, Xatu and Forretress can help minimize its impact while providing Magic Bounce and Rapid Spin support respectively.</p>"

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>An all out offensive Latias may seem inferior to Latios, but don't be fooled! Latias's excellent special bulk sets it apart from its more bloody thirsty brother.</p> <p>Casting aside the consistency of Dragon Pulse, Latias takes up her most powerful STAB option—Draco Meteor. By far her strongest immediate attack, it pulverizes any Pokemon lacking a resistance or great special bulk. No longer can bulky Dragon-types such as Giratina-O or Arceus-Dragon possibly survive; they are now OHKOed with ease. Even after the Special Attack drop, Draco Meteor is still powerful enough to discourage Dragon-type Pokemon, most notably Rayquaza, from seeking a free switch-in. Roost provides reliable recovery, increasing her lifespan so that she can better fulfill her purpose.</p> <p>Latias's remaining slots are dedicated towards maximizing coverage. One slot provides utility against Kyogre; the other slot provides weather dependent coverage against Steel-type Pokemon. Grass Knot and Hidden Power Fire is the preferred attacking combination for most teams, in particular those utilizing sun, due to a lesser reliance on weather, its ability to deal with all auto-weather inducers such as Groudon and Tyranitar, and its specialization against Latias's key checks, in particular Ferrothorn and Jirachi. For those using rain, Thunder and Surf are better options. Although it is highly reliant on rain and incapable of defeating opposing Ferrothorn, this combination is capable of defeating Manaphy, Lugia, and Heatran. It is also better suited for blasting holes or even sweeping thanks to superior overall coverage and power.</p> <p>When maximizing damage output, both Speed and Special Attack are crucial. Yet, with the increased power of Draco Meteor along with its inherent hit-and-run nature, Latias can afford to place more emphasis on bulk while still maintaining great offensive pressure. As such, her EV spread guarantees the 2HKO on specially defensive Giratina regardless of Stealth Rock, ensures that Timid Kyogre's Choice Scarf Ice Beam is unable to 2HKO after Stealth Rock, and allows her to outspeed opposing positive base 102 Speed Pokemon like Garchomp. If Latias lacks Hidden Power Fire, simply transfer 4 Speed EVs into Special Attack as the Speed compensation is unneeded.</p> <p>Although bulk is one of Latias's greatest strengths, it is advised to refrain from any further bulk investment. Lowering her Special Attack greatly weakens her damage output, while lowering her Speed hinders her ability to offensively force switches by outspeeding threats. This is unacceptable for a set geared towards strong initial offensive pressure.</p> <p>Diverting EVs from HP into Special Attack and Speed is always an option. For those running Hidden Power Fire, 148 HP / 164 SpA / 196 Spe with a Timid nature can be run if one wants to always OHKO Groudon after Spikes. 100 HP / 164 SpA / 244 Spe with a Timid Nature can be run if outspeeding Terrakion is the primary concern- the 100 HP EVs will still prevent the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Kyogre's Water Spout after Stealth Rock. Finally, if Hidden Power Fire is not used, a spread with Speed maximized is an option. 88 HP / 168 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid Nature allows her to Speed tie with opposing positive base 110s. If at this point more power is still needed, consider using Latios instead.</p> <p>Despite her focus on strong coverage, her coverage slots can be configured to provide any desired utility. STAB Dragon Pulse inflicts consistent damage, bluffs, and allows her to more effectively sweep late-game should the opportunity arise. However, the loss of either utility against Kyogre or Steel-type Pokemon hurts its viability. Similarly, STAB Psyshock deals with Arceus-Fighting and possibly even Chansey or Blissey after some prior damage. If opposing Calm Mind users are an issue, Psych Up allows Latias to copy her opponent's current boosts. This recharges Draco Meteor for reuse and allows her to defeat any Calm Mind Kyogre. When paired with Psyshock, Latias becomes capable of taking on many Calm Mind Arceus formes. However, Psych Up is highly situational and cuts into coverage; it should only be considered if there is no other alternative for taking on Calm Mind users on the team. Thunderbolt can be used over Thunder for its greater accuracy outside of rain, but its lesser power along with her intended usage under rain makes it a situational option at best.</p> <p>The bane of this set is its vulnerability to setup sweepers. Although Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza are still unable to set up after a Draco Meteor, dangerous sweepers such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Mewtwo, and Latios are capable. Left unchecked, these threats will prove particularly problematic; this issue is further exasperated by her inability to reliably boost.</p> <p>Latias is unable to check Calm Mind Kyogre without Psych Up; this problem is similarly seen against Calm Mind Arceus. Thunder Wave variants will also prove problematic, albeit to a lesser extent due to reduced Speed investment. Likewise, a full power Choice Specs Water Spout forces a mindgame as she is forced to either attack or Roost.</p> <p>Playing with this set is quite straightforward: find an opportunity to switch in, decide whether to attack or Roost, and then switch out if the situation turns undesirable. As such, despite her lean towards offense, she fits on almost any team. However, unlike other Latias sets, all-out attacker requires some specific team support in order to function at full capacity. It is critical that she is paired up with teammates who can deal with dangerous setup sweepers. For example, Wallceus takes on physical setup sweepers like Swords Dance Arceus while Ferrothorn deals with special setup sweepers such as Kyogre, Latias, and Manaphy. Otherwise, Latias will prove to be a great glue Pokemon, providing excellent balance between both offensive and defensive utility. However, should Latias mispredict using her coverage, switch-ins like Genesect who carry super effective attacks will be most disliked. As such, Pokemon who resist her weaknesses happen to be great teammates, in particular Steel-type Pokemon such as Arceus-Steel, Heatran, and Jirachi. As Latias's great offensive pressure tends to force a lot of switches, partnering her with offensive Pokemon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Genesect is advised. Similarly, Pokemon who can set up entry hazards such as Skarmory and Forretress are excellent for punishing switches as well as increasing the chance of her KOs. Finally, because Latias still has a few coverage deficiencies, make sure these shortcomings are patched up in some form. For instance, should she lack Thunder, a Toxic user or very potent attacker such as Kyogre or Zekrom can help deal with troublesome Lugia.</p>"

      "Calm Mind Draco Meteor": {
        "description": "<p>Although it might seem counterproductive, using Calm Mind with Draco Meteor transforms Latias into an excellent Arceus-Ghost lure. A +1 Draco Meteor has enough power to cleanly OHKO an unboosted, 252 HP Arceus after Stealth Rock. On top of that, a +1 Psyshock can 2HKO the very same Arceus without any entry hazards necessary while an uninvested Ghost-type Judgment will always fail to 2HKO even with Stealth Rock support.</p> <p>This Latias variant is also extremely flexible. She can act similarly to the all-out attacker set by immediately attacking with strong Draco Meteors or increase her wallbreaking power with Calm Mind. Calm Mind also allows Latias to clean up late-game with her consistent Psyshock and Thunder. This versatility makes this set one of the best Kyogre checks as she will never run into issues her other sets might face, such as the inability to immediately punish the opposing team with powerful attacks or failing to stop Calm Mind Kyogre.</p> <p>Even when unboosted, Draco Meteor is a very strong attack that is capable of dealing 62% minimum to Choice Scarf Genesect, limiting it to a single switch-in. Psyshock is excellent for Calm Mind wars and for 2HKOing bulky Arceus at +1, but leaves Latias vulnerable to Spikes setters like Forretress. Because of that, Thunder can be used in its place as it still crushes Kyogre and Ho-Oh while potentially beating Calm Mind Arceus formes by crippling them with paralysis. Roost allows Latias to check Kyogre throughout the course of the match and to set up additional Calm Mind boosts when needed.</p> <p>The Special Attack EVs ensure that a +1 Draco Meteor will always OHKO 252 HP Arceus after Stealth Rock while the Speed EVs allow Latias to outspeed Garchomp. The remaining EVs are put into HP so Latias can avoid the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Kyogre's Water Spout after Stealth Rock. This, along with surviving Lustrous Orb Palkia's Spacial Rend after Stealth Rock, is why you should use this Latias instead of a similar Latios.</p> <p>Ferrothorn is a pest but it can only beat Latias if it runs Gyro Ball, as those with Power Whip as their attacking move are turned into setup fodder for Calm Mind. You can take advantage of this fact when considering teammates by using a Pokemon that loses to Ferrothorn only when it uses Power Whip, such as Calm Mind Kyogre. Regardless, you will want to use one of the typical Ferrothorn checks, such as Arceus-Fighting, to limit the number of turns it can use Spikes. You might also want to use a Rapid Spin user to remove the Spikes if Ferrothorn manages to set up. Tyranitar is another common problem for Latias, but not much can be done about it besides reserving Latias or indirectly pressuring Tyranitar with the threat of a weather sweeper, such as Kabutops.</p> <p>The beauty of this set is that it is extremely flexible and self-sufficient. It's more of a question of what Latias can do for your team rather than what team you need for her. If you find yourself in need of a reliable Kyogre switch-in, a solid Groudon punish, protection against the majority of Calm Mind Arceus formes, or just an additional check to Palkia, Calm Mind Draco Meteor Latias should fit easily on your team.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Looking for the best Kyogre counter in the game? Search no further, for in her most defensive role yet, Latias's special bulk is simply titanic—even specially defensive Giratina is outmatched. No other Latias set compares with her sheer utility, for she not only checks and counters the very same threats that they are capable of, but can accomplish feats that other Pokemon can only dream of.</p> <p>Following the use of Light Screen, Latias and her team becomes nigh impenetrable on the special side. No longer will she have to fear Kyogre's Choice Specs Ice Beam; any Kyogre is reduced to mere impotency. For as long as Light Screen remains active and she be at reasonable health, no special attacker in the game has the strength to overcome her. Not even Mewtwo's Psystrike, renowned for being the bane of special walls like Chansey, is capable of getting past Light Screen. In fact, Mewtwo will find itself checked by Latias, who can switch in with ease, possibly Light Screen, and then proceed to heal up with Roost or phaze with Roar. It's not just Mewtwo either: any Calm Mind Arceus, Deoxys-A, Dialga, other Latias, Manaphy, Omastar, Palkia, Reshiram, Shaymin-S—even Choice Specs Kyurem-W itself—will find themselves surprised by her sheer tenacity. Even wearing Latias down will prove difficult, for Roost provides reliable recovery and allows her to maintain long-term presence. Roar phazes any threat who tries to set up, weakening most switch-ins provided there is sufficient entry hazard support.</p> <p>Despite her lack of investment, Latias is no weakling; her last slot provides a potent STAB attack. Dragon Pulse is the preferred option for its high reliability. For those who desire more power, Draco Meteor is a better option. Its great power initially exceeds that of any Calm Mind Latias set, devastating opposing Dragon-type Pokemon. However, its Special Attack drop makes it inconsistent; Light Screen and Roar help minimize any serious repercussions.</p> <p>In the Uber metagame, the sheer number and power of its special attackers necessitate heavy investment in special bulk. But unlike other special walls, Latias can afford to place more emphasis on Speed while still maintaining titanic special bulk. As such, her EV spread provides the maximum special bulk possible while still allowing her to outspeed opposing neutral base 95 Speed Pokemon like Kyurem-W and Rayquaza. The invested bulk also ensures that Mewtwo's unboosted Life Orb Ice Beam is virtually unable to 2HKO after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Latias's EVs can easily be tweaked depending on personal preference to more effectively take on certain special attackers. Feel free to take some EVs away from Speed and invest it in her bulk instead. 252 HP / 12 Def / 148 SpD / 96 Spe with a Calm Nature can be run if the only concern is outspeeding neutral base 90 Speed Pokemon like Kyogre and Reshiram; this allows her to better deal with threats such as Deoxys-A and Mewtwo. More Speed EVs can be removed, but note that lesser Speed makes it significantly more difficult for her to use Light Screen or Roost before a relatively slow hit, or out-phaze with Roar.Conversely, a greater investment in Speed is also possible. 252 HP / 52 SpD / 204 Spe with a Calm Nature can be run for the ability to outspeed positive base 90 Speed Pokemon, but it comes with a significant decrease in Special Defense. However, any further Speed investment is counterproductive due to compromising her ability to safely switch into Kyogre's Choice Specs Ice Beam after Stealth Rock; this is a significant incentive for her usage.</p> <p>Light Screen, Roost, and Roar are crucial to Latias's purpose. However, if Latias's Dragon STAB isn't necessary, Refresh can be run to alleviate status issues. Toxic allows Latias to more effectively take down opposing Pokemon who can no longer be forced out, such as last-Pokemon Calm Mind Arceus. It also deals significant damage to very bulky opponents like Lugia. However, both options leave her particularly vulnerable to Taunt users and fail to take advantage of Soul Dew's Special Attack boost; this hurts their viability.</p> <p>Because Latias places so much emphasis into her bulk, it is understandable that her offense suffers. Although she is no offensive deadweight thanks to Soul Dew and her STAB Dragon-type attacks, she still isn't very strong; she has the weakest overall offensive pressure out of all Latias sets. This problem is further augmented by her lack of coverage. Although any special checks are now ineffective, her physical checks remain troublesome. For example, Genesect with its U-turn will always force Latias to switch out.</p> <p>Her issue in offense has little effect on her performance against Kyogre. Latias's increased special bulk, Light Screen, and Roar gives her far more luxury; no longer will she have to play on Kyogre's terms—she comes in whenever she wants to. For instance, a Latias at full health is capable of switching into a full power, critical hit Choice Specs Water Spout. In every single relevant scenario, she will reliably and consistently counter Kyogre regardless of set. Her only possible issue, last-Pokemon Calm Mind Kyogre, is averted by getting in first and utilizing Roar to rack up entry hazard damage. Light Screen allows other teammates to deal with Kyogre more effectively, while she still has the ability to take it on in a pinch; she can successfully outstall the attacking moves of a +6 mono-attacker Kyogre despite the possible burn.</p> <p>Latias is great for teams that need extra reassurance against special threats. Despite her lean towards defense, she fits on all but the most offensive teams. As such, avoid placing her on teams like hyper offense, or her lack of strong offense will prove disappointing.</p> <p>The closest thing to a glue Pokemon out of all Latias sets is specially defensive. She isn't really used with specific teammates; she holds a team together by providing an answer to a wide range of threats. Latias is invaluable for supplying specific team support in phazing, Light Screen, and more. However, physical attackers who carry super effective attacks, like Genesect, are a huge hindrance, so physically bulky Pokemon who resist her weaknesses happen to be great teammates. In particular, physical walls such as Wallceus and Skarmory are fantastic partners, especially since they are better suited for taking on physical threats like Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost. Because Latias in turn is particularly good at taking on special attackers, entry hazards from the likes of Ferrothorn and Forretress can help make the most of her ability to force switches as well as compensating for her reduced offensive power. Latias also finds many last-Pokemon situations particularly bothersome, so Perish Song support from an Arceus forme is greatly appreciated. Cleric support from Blissey or Chansey is also wise for curing her of detrimental status like Toxic. Lastly, make sure to have some way of dealing with her non-special checks. For instance, should Ferrothorn manage to safely switch in, Xatu and Forretress are excellent solutions who can provide Magic Bounce and Rapid Spin support respectively.</p>"

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>When one thinks of Latios in Ubers, the first thing that comes to mind is power. With a decent 130 Special Attack stat bolstered by Soul Dew, Latios possesses the power to break through many of the great walls found in Ubers, such as Giratina. Latios also possesses a great base 110 Speed stat, allowing it to outrun the majority of the Ubers metagame. Finally, Levitate is a great ability that gives Latios immunity to both Ground-type moves as well as Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Latios is not without its faults, however. Pitiful 80 / 80 physical bulk means that even super effective physical attacks that do not get STAB on them will likely OHKO it. Latios also cannot check Kyogre as well as its sister Latias, as a Water Spout from Modest Choice Scarf Kyogre at full health 2HKOes it. Like most fast sweepers, Latios is vulnerable to all forms of status. Finally, Latios does not possess a powerful Fighting- or Fire-type move, meaning that it has to resort to a Hidden Power if it wants to hit Steel-types super-effectively. If it chooses to forgo Hidden Power Fire, it becomes massive Spikes bait for Ferrothorn. Despite these flaws, Latios makes for an excellent wallbreaker due to its power and Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fighting hits Heatran fairly hard in any weather, 2HKOing offensive and physically defensive variants, while 3HKOing specially defensive Heatran. It is also Latios's best option against Tyranitar, though it will not even come close to OHKOing it. However, Latios is usually better off with Hidden Power Fire, especially on sun teams. Hidden Power Ground OHKOs Heatran, but has little use outside of that. Thunder Wave and Toxic can be used to cripple walls such as Lugia, but Latios doesn't really have room for them and is better off attacking. A Choice Scarf set might seem intriguing at first, but without Soul Dew Latios will dish out disappointing damage while easily succumbing to both physical and special attacks. Latios does have access to Trick, so a Choice Scarf set can cripple an unsuspecting check such as Heatran. Thunderbolt might seem useful on sun teams to hit Lugia and Water-type pokemon, but in reality Thunderbolt is a terrible move due to its low Base Power and average coverage; in addition, Draco Meteor outdamages Thunderbolt in almost all cases, bar against Gyarados. Psycho Shift is a very gimmicky move that seemingly solves Latios's problem with status moves, but in reality, it is really situational and rarely worth the moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Specially defensive Jirachi in rain fares very well against Latios, as neither of its STAB moves will bother Jirachi much and Hidden Power Fire's power is weakened by rain. Jirachi can retaliate in return by crippling Latios with status. Thunder does 3HKO it while having a 30% chance to paralyze, so Jirachi is far from a hard counter. Arceus-Dark gives Latios a lot of trouble, as it can use Recover to negate damage from Draco Meteor and retaliate with a super effective Judgment. Arceus-Ghost also behaves similarly, but has to beware of Psyshock. Arceus-Dark does not care about the Calm Mind variant either, as it can set up Calm Mind alongside it and is immune to Psyshock. Arceus-Steel fares very well in rain, as it resists Latios's main STAB moves and avoids a 2HKO from rain-boosted Surf. Arceus-Steel must be wary of Thunder paralysis and cannot effectively check Latios in sunlight if it carries Hidden Power Fire. Ferrothorn is similar to Arceus-Steel in that it resists Latios's STAB moves, but Hidden Power Fire will take away half of Ferrothorn's life even under rain, so it must be wary of switching directly into Latios; that said, Leech Seed and Protect can stall out Latios should Ferrothorn get in safely. Under sunlight, Heatran fares very well against Latios, fearing nothing except for the rare Hidden Power Fighting. Due to its lack of reliable recovery, however, Heatran cannot repeatedly come in on Draco Meteor if Stealth Rock is up; outside of sunlight, it must be wary of Surf as well. Tyranitar can trap Latios with Pursuit, though it does not enjoy switching into Grass Knot. Choice Scarf users generally do a good job revenge killing Latios. Genesect deserves a special mention as it OHKOes Latios after a Download boost with U-turn, while giving momentum to your opponent's team should you switch Latios out of the U-turn. Scizor also gives Latios trouble, as it can trap Latios with Pursuit or outright OHKO it with U-turn. Choice Band Bullet Punch will deal massive damage to Latios as well, though it falls short of an OHKO. Scizor and Genesect need to avoid switching into Hidden Power Fire though. Choice Scarf Dragons such as Zekrom, Rayquaza, and Palkia can OHKO Latios, though the latter needs Draco Meteor to do so even after Stealth Rock. Giratina-O and Swords Dance Arceus can pick off weakened Latios with Shadow Sneak and Extreme Speed, respectively.</p> <p>If Stealth Rock is off the opponent's side of the field, Latios becomes vulnerable to Lugia and Ho-Oh. Lugia can take any of Latios's attacks if Multiscale is intact, including Thunder, while retaliating with Toxic. Lugia does need to watch out for Magic Coat, though. Life Orb and Choice Band variants of Ho-Oh are not OHKOed by any of Latios's attacks and can OHKO back with Brave Bird. Ho-Oh cannot safely switch in, though, even if Stealth Rock is not up. Deoxys-Defense is another Pokemon that appreciates a hazardless field, as Deoxys is guaranteed to survive two consecutive Draco Meteors at full health, but may fall if Stealth Rock is up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This Latios set takes advantage of its excellent power, Speed and movepool. With Soul Dew, Latios reaches an impressive 538 Special Attack and makes for a terrific hit-and-run attacker. Latios checks Kyogre and Groudon fairly well due to its Dragon / Psychic typing and Levitate, and beats almost all Dragons in the tier one-on-one unless they wield a Choice Scarf. Dragon Pulse is Latios's main STAB move and possesses the power to OHKO Palkia and 2HKO Groudon. Psyshock lets Latios deal with Chansey and Blissey, usually 2HKOing Chansey after Stealth Rock and always 2HKOing Blissey. Psyshock also deals with Arceus-Fighting and Terrakion.</p> <p>The last two moves largely depend on what weather you are running. Under the sun, Hidden Power Fire is a terrific option to nail Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Forretress, and Scizor. However, Hidden Power Fire does cause Latios to run 30 Speed EVs, meaning that opposing Latios and offensive Latias will outrun it if they lack a Hidden Power of their own. However, the coverage provided by Hidden Power Fire is usually worth it. If Latios is used on a rain team, Thunder is the preferred option for beating Lugia while potentially spreading paralysis, as Hidden Power Fire is significantly weakened. Thunder still hits some Steel-types such as Jirachi and Heatran for adequate damage, though Latios is completely walled by Ferrothorn in the rain. Draco Meteor is a decent option in the last slot, as it can finish off pokemon that Dragon Pulse cannot, such as support Dialga at 70% health and Latias. However, the Special Attack drop is often unappealing and costs Latios momentum, so Grass Knot can be used in its place. In addition to OHKOing Groudon, Grass Knot deals with Arceus-Rock and Arceus-Ground (not to mention Arceus-Water if you are using Latios on sun teams). Grass Knot can also 2HKO Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. For the most part, Grass Knot does not offer Latios much in the way of coverage as the combination of Dragon Pulse and Psyshock hits most Water- and Ground-type Pokemon hard enough.</p> <p>Though this set is meant to cause as much immediate damage as possible by using Latios's excellent coverage and power, there are some intriguing non-attacking options at its disposal. Latios can utilize Magic Coat to combat anti-lead Deoxys-S as well as screw over status users such as Lugia and support Arceus. Roost is a decent option for replenishing Latios's health, though Latios will not find many opportunities to use it against offensive teams. Roar is a good choice for sets that use Draco Meteor as it prevents Latios from becoming setup bait after the Special Attack drop while racking up hazard damage. Roar is especially useful on teams with a dedicated hazard setter, such as Custap Berry Forretress or Deoxys-S. Finally, Memento can be used to give a sweeper an opportunity to set up. Latios does not have many more appealing options to attack with, though Surf is very usable on rain teams to destroy Heatran and Excadrill while hitting Jirachi harder than Thunder does. Since Surf hits both Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Rock, it is recommended not to run it alongside Grass Knot on the same set. Though Modest might be tempting for the additional power, Timid is greatly preferred to outrun dangerous threats such as Palkia and Garchomp. The slight drop in power is not nearly as noticeable as the drop in Speed.</p> <p>Darkrai makes for a good teammate, as it can put troublesome Pokemon such as Arceus-Ghost and bulky Steel-types to sleep. In return, Latios can handle the Pokemon that Darkrai struggles with, such as RestTalk Kyogre and Arceus-Fighting. Rocky Helmet Skarmory is a neat teammate because it makes revenge killing Latios more difficult for the opponent; Skarmory fares well against Swords Dance Arceus while pressuring repeated U-turns from Genesect. Powerful Ground-type Pokemon, such as Groudon and Landorus-T, can take many of Latios's checks down in one hit. Groudon is arguably the best choice for this purpose, as it allows Latios to run Hidden Power Fire and deal with some Steel-types itself. Bulky Arceus-Steel can handle most Choice Scarf-wearing dragons, barring Reshiram.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>This set eschews coverage in favor of wallbreaking potential. Though Latios can still be used as a hit-and-run attacker (and will have to be if the opponent has a Genesect), this Latios has the ability to take advantage of switches with Calm Mind. Psyshock and an immunity to Toxic Spikes make Latios a quality Calm Mind user. After a Calm Mind boost or two, Latios has the potential to beat walls it normally has a difficult time bypassing, such as support Arceus and Umbreon. The Special Defense boost also makes Latios incredibly difficult for specially based Choice Scarf users such as Palkia and Kyogre to revenge kill. A +1 Draco Meteor can kill most Arceus formes, though the Special Attack drop will often force Latios to switch out. If the Special Attack drop is unappealing, Dragon Pulse is a reasonable alternative, though the power drop is very noticeable. Psyshock gives Latios the edge in many Calm Mind wars, notably against Calm Mind Arceus formes and Kyogre. Roost is preferred in the final slot to give Latios staying power and potentially sweep, though Latios does not possess great coverage with its two STAB moves. Hidden Power Fire and Thunder are alternatives if coverage is more important to Latios than recovery.</p> <p>Other coverage moves are usable in the fourth slot, such as Surf and Grass Knot, but these don't offer Latios desirable coverage in comparison to Hidden Power Fire or Thunder. To support Calm Mind Latios, physically defensive Wobbuffet can be used to dispose of many physical Choice Scarf users such as Zekrom and Garchomp. Sadly, it cannot deal with Genesect. Again, Rocky Helmet Skarmory makes for an excellent teammate to prevent Genesect from using U-turn repeatedly. Latios also enjoys Pokemon that can destroy Steel-types, such as Earth Plate Groudon and Reshiram. In return, Latios fares well versus Kyogre and Arceus-Water. Other Pokemon that can beat Steel-types, such as Arceus-Fighting, are useful as teammates, though Latios does not cover Arceus-Fighting's weaknesses very well. Finally, all status cripples Latios, so a cleric is appreciated if your team can afford to run one.</p>"
      },
      "Speed Booster": {
        "description": "<p>This set plays similarly to the all-out attacker, but with a twist. Due to Latios's already high Speed, the fact that Tailwind doubles its Speed ensures that no Choice Scarf user can outspeed and revenge kill it. Tailwind also gives one of Latios's teammates an opportunity to clean up if Latios falls before the Tailwind peters out. The moves are simple: use Draco Meteor for power, Psyshock for Chansey and Blissey, and Hidden Power Fire or Thunder for coverage. Dragon Pulse can be used over Draco Meteor for consistency.</p> <p>Alternatively, Latios can use Dragon Dance as the boost in Speed does not disappear until Latios either switches out or faints. Dragon Dance gives Latios a better chance to clean by itself, but does not support the rest of the team should Latios fail to sweep. For this reason, Tailwind is often the better choice, especially on hyper offense teams.</p> <p>This Latios prefers to be on teams with heavy offensive pressure, as Tailwind lasts only a few turns. Choice Specs Kyogre, Rayquaza, and Life Orb Ho-Oh all make for excellent partners for Latios as they love the added Speed which Tailwind grants them. Latios cannot check Kyogre by itself, so Arceus-Grass is a solid teammate as it removes some pressure off Latios to deal with Kyogre. Latios can afford to run some bulk to help out against Kyogre due to the fact that Tailwind will allow it to outrun the entire metagame, despite the loss in Speed EVs; at least 176 Speed should be run to outrun Palkia, however. Like the other sets, Latios still appreciates support from Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Arceus-Fighting to remove Steel-types.</p>"

      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Latios's typing, ability, high base Speed, and access to Memento enable it to distinguish itself as an exceptionally good dual screen user. Light Screen and Reflect enable Latios to cushion both it and its team from the enemies' attacks for eight turns. With Memento in his arsenal, Latios can sacrifice himself to lower the offensive stats of an enemy even further, allowing a teammate a free switch-in. The third moveslot choice depends on what the team needs. If Latios's only goal is to cripple an opponent, Draco Meteor lets it do heavy damage before lowering its attacking stats. In addition, Draco Meteor prevents Latios from being destroyed by Taunt and stops Rayquaza from setting up on him. Alternatively, Latios can easily set up screens more than once a match, and Roost enables it to heal itself to do so even more reliably.</p> <p>The listed EV spread allows Latios to avoid a 2HKO on average from Timid Choice Scarf Palkia's Spacial Rend after Light Screen, and Speed tie with other Latios and Latias. If one feels that these Pokemon are simply too uncommon and wishes to increase Latios's bulk, a spread of 252 HP / 64 SpD / 192 Spe lets it outrun all non-Choice Scarf Garchomp, while 252 HP/ 160 SpD / 96 Spe enables it to outspeed all base 90 Speed Pokemon while retaining a fairly high amount of special bulk.</p> <p>Latios has other options outside of Draco Meteor and Roost if more team support is needed. Thunder Wave enables Latios to further cripple his enemies by cutting their Speed and the chance of full paralysis can even help his teammates get an extra boost. Tailwind enables Latios to double the Speed of his team. In particular, it can be used in conjunction with Memento for a teammate to take advantage of the boosts to both bulk and Speed. Finally, Latios can run Dragon Pulse as an option for a more reliable STAB. However, Dragon Pulse is fairly weak and incapable of breaking even the Substitutes of a 252 / 0 Ho-Oh or Lugia.</p> <p>As Latios's main purpose is to help a teammate sweep, it is a good idea to pair it up with stat-boosting teammates, such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Shell Smash Cloyster. In particular, Latios enjoys support from Mew and Gorebyss. They are capable of easily accumulating many boosts to pass to a teammate, who can further use the protection provided by dual screens to pave the way for a bulky sweep.</p>"

  "Kyogre": {
    "overview": "<p>Kyogre has been a defining part of Ubers since its fateful release, and this generation is no exception. With its metagame-shifting ability Drizzle, base 150 Special Attack, and very good bulk even by Ubers standards, it's no wonder that Kyogre continues to be one of the most common, if not the most common, Pokemon in the metagame. With STAB on its Water-type moves, and the additional boost due to the automatic rain, its power reaches truly monstrous levels. In fact, thanks to Drizzle, Kyogre's Water Spout is the strongest immediate, non-recoil attack in the game. Because of its sheer power, there are very few reliable switch-ins to this whale; Latias, Latios, and Arceus-Grass being just about all that can muster the willpower to do so.</p> <p>Kyogre's stats and abilities also make it a terrific team player. The rain that it sets up is helpful to a wide variety of Pokemon in Ubers, notably Steel-types, Water-types, and Thunder users. It also helps to neuter Reshiram's otherwise nuclear Blue Flare.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Kyogre has its fair share of checks and revenge killers. Zekrom is one of the most prominent of these, hitting Kyogre hard with its physical Electric-type STAB move, Bolt Strike. Ferrothorn and Gastrodon cause similar problems, the former being able to avoid a 2HKO from sets lacking Choice Specs, and the latter being immune to Kyogre's STAB moves altogether. In addition, Kyogre still has its old foes from the previous generations, such as Palkia and Shaymin-S. Despite all this, Kyogre is definitely one of the best Pokemon in the game, and is difficult not to put into an Uber team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kyogre can run a mixed set with Life Orb or Mystic Water to beat Blissey with Waterfall, but it still loses to Chansey if it lacks significant Attack investment. Safeguard, Roar and Toxic are the only other really notable alternatives. All of them have merit on a stall team, but Kyogre tends to perform better in a bulky sweeping role. Toxic is slightly more plausible because it is Kyogre's only way to beat Shedinja through its Focus Sash, but Shedinja is rare and entry hazards are more practical.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>When talking about checks and counters, there is always the realization that only a few Pokemon can switch into Choice Specs Water Spout at all, and even fewer can switch into Water Spout and Stealth Rock repeatedly. Palkia, specially defensive Giratina, Calm Chansey, defensive Ludicolo, and Gastrodon are the most reliable Pokemon to switch into Water Spout; indeed, their ability to take Water Spouts alone increases their viability significantly. Arceus-Grass also takes massive damage but will nonetheless force Kyogre out and weaken it with possible damage from entry hazards and attacks on future switch ins. Since Water Spout weakens as HP decreases, the number of viable switch-ins increases accordingly. Blissey and Ferrothorn can switch into Choice Specs Surfs fairly comfortably, and, consequently, they are very good counters to most Kyogre sets; Ferrothorn 2HKOes Kyogre before it can 2HKO back after one Calm Mind boost. Zekrom also threatens most Kyogre sets by delivering an easy OHKO with Bolt Strike.</p> <p>The best ways to deal with Kyogre are through offensive pressure and bulky setup sweepers. The aforementioned Ferrothorn and Zekrom deliver in this aspect; in particular, Mixed Zekrom and Substitute + Hone Claws Zekrom can destroy Kyogre + Ferrothorn cores. Bulk Up Dialga is also notable for its ability to set up on nearly every Kyogre set, only really losing to the Choice Specs set. Calm Mind users are great checks to Kyogre because Kyogre tends to lose Calm Mind wars with the many Dragon-types in Ubers, as well as Arceus formes that resist Water. However, many Calm Mind users are weak to Kyogre's coverage moves, which should be kept in mind. Latias, Arceus-Dragon, Giratina, and Giratina-O can set up on Kyogre that lack Ice Beam, while Arceus-Water, Manaphy, and opposing Kyogre can beat Kyogre that lack Thunder. While Thundurus cannot switch in, it can OHKO Kyogre with Thunder after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The issue with defensive tactics for dealing with Kyogre is that many Kyogre sets are made to set up on, or just power right through, most defensive Pokemon. The few Pokemon that can take the brutal assaults of Choice Specs Kyogre, such as Chansey, risk giving free turns to a SubCM or mono-attacker set. Nonetheless, the fact that Water Spout loses power as Kyogre loses HP is a great weakness for defensive Pokemon to exploit, so that the likes of Dialga, Arceus-Grass, and Giratina can wall Kyogre completely, and even use Roar to foil setup attempts.</p> <p>Groudon deserves a special mention. While it cannot switch into most of Kyogre's attacks at all, it can still switch into Thunder or come in after a KO, and use Drought to weaken Kyogre's STAB attacks significantly before switching right back out. Kyogre's Water-type assaults are cut to one-third of the power that they have in the rain, making it much easier for Groudon's various teammates to come in. Shedinja also deserves a mention because it walls Kyogre completely, though it cannot switch into entry hazards.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Kyogre is an effective and powerful revenge killer, though it cannot boast the absurd wallbreaking power that Choice Specs Kyogre has. It still has a very powerful Water Spout that deals at least 79.7% to +1 Mewtwo, an OHKO after Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil, which is an impressive feat that other special Choice Scarf attackers, such as Palkia and Dialga, fail to achieve. Considering that Kyogre is in the common base 90 Speed bracket, the Speed EVs are maximized to optimize its revenge killing capabilities, letting it tie with other base 90 Speed Choice Scarf users, such as Dialga. A Modest nature can still be used for the extra power, however.</p> <p>The choice between Modest and Timid nature can be somewhat complicated. The extra power makes it easier to KO several threats, which are listed below with damage calculations. On the other hand, some speed benchmarks that Modest misses are Deoxys-A and opposing Timid Choice Scarf Kyogre, both of which can deal massive damage to or OHKO Kyogre if they go first. One could note that most of the Pokemon listed below are weak against Ice Beam.</p> <p>Modest 131 Base Power Water Spout:</p> <ul> <li>vs 252/0 Arceus 37.6% - 44.4% (Chance to 2HKO with Stealth Rock; Timid fails entirely)</li> <li>vs 252/200 Dialga 39.9% - 47% (Very small chance to 2HKO with Stealth Rock)</li> <li>vs 0/0 Rayquaza 40.5% - 47.9% (2HKO with Stealth Rock)</li> <li>vs 252/0 Latias 42.9% - 50.3% (Chance to 2HKO)</li> <li>vs 4/0 Arceus 43.7% - 51.6% (Very large chance to 2HKO with Stealth Rock)</li> <li>vs 0/0 Giratina-O 44.2% - 52.4% (2HKO with Stealth Rock; Timid is not guaranteed)</li> <li>vs 252/0 Manaphy 48.3% - 57.2% (2HKO with Stealth Rock)</li> </ul> <p>Modest Surf:</p> <ul> <li>vs 0/0 Rayquaza 29.3% - 34.8%</li> <li>vs 0/0 Dialga / Zekrom / Manaphy 41.6% - 49.3%</li> <li>vs 4/0 Hydreigon 47.24% - 55.83% (2HKO with Stealth Rock; Timid is not guaranteed)</li> </ul> <p>The list of counters to the Choice Scarf set is somewhat long. Essentially, any Pokemon that resists Water and is at least as bulky as Arceus can wall Kyogre pretty comfortably. This notably includes Ferrothorn, Arceus-Grass, Giratina, and Dialga; the idea of breaking through Chansey, Blissey, and Palkia with Kyogre's STAB moves is pretty much out of the question, though Palkia will go down to a couple of bouts of Thunder. Additionally, Wobbuffet is fatal to Kyogre, being able to trap it and survive Surf, Ice Beam, or Thunder. Ferrothorn is especially a problem because it can use Kyogre as an opportunity to set up entry hazards, which hurts not only Kyogre but also the rest of the team. Bulk Up Dialga provides a more offensive threat, being able to set up a potential sweep against Kyogre.</p> <p>Generally, a wallbreaker can be of use to smash through some of the tougher enemies. Mixed Zekrom is a good example because it can lure and KO Ferrothorn with Focus Blast, destroy Giratina, and hit Dialga and Arceus hard. Mixed Giratina-O and mixed Rayquaza work similarly, as do mixed Palkia and mixed Dialga, which can lure Chansey and Blissey and smash them with physical attacks. These mixed attackers can also be used to lure in and KO Wobbuffet. Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Excadrill are good partners as well, particularly against Dialga; Groudon can run a Fire-type move to get rid of Ferrothorn, and Excadrill can use Rapid Spin to remove the entry hazards that Kyogre hates. Another way to beat some of the walls, particularly Chansey and Blissey, is to trap them with Wobbuffet and use Encore and Tickle to render them helpless against a Pursuit user, such as Scizor or Tyranitar. SubCharge Magnezone can also be used to punish a Ferrothorn switch-in severely by trapping and setting up on it, though one should have a Rapid Spin user to get rid of the entry hazards Ferrothorn is likely to set up.</p> <p>Wish support is recommended to restore Water Spout's power. Jirachi is great in this role due to its Steel / Psychic typing, which leaves it only vulnerable to Ground in the rain.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs is an obvious item to put on Kyogre considering the record-setting power of Water Spout. Almost no switch-in is safe from a 2HKO--even Chansey can be 2HKOed by Water Spout in the rain--making Kyogre an extremely dangerous wallbreaker. Kyogre also has Thunder and Ice Beam, both of which 2HKO Palkia, so that very few Pokemon can safely switch in at all. When Kyogre's HP drops lower, it can use its alternative STAB move, either Surf (at 63.3% HP or lower) or Hydro Pump (at 80% HP or lower).</p> <p>Water Spout alone gives severe problems to most opponents. The following examples give a good idea of this by demonstrating Water Spout's power after Kyogre is hit by Stealth Rock upon switching in.</p> <p>131 Base Power Water Spout:</p> <ul> <li>vs 252/216+ Ludicolo: 29.67% - 34.89%</li> <li>vs 248/252+ Giratina: 36.97% - 43.53%</li> <li>vs 0/0 Palkia: 38.94% - 45.79%</li> <li>vs 4/252+ Chansey: 42.52% - 50.16% (Possible 2HKO; guaranteed on Bold with Stealth Rock)</li> <li>vs 252/224+ Tentacruel: 52.2% - 61.5% (Might survive for a bit with Rain Dish + Protect)</li> <li>vs 252/252+ Ferrothorn: 53.98% - 63.64% (2HKO)</li> <li>vs 252/4 Arceus (resist): 56.08% - 66.22% (OHKO on other Arceus)</li> <li>vs 104/0 Zekrom: 79.84% - 94.01% (Possible OHKO with Stealth Rock)</li> <li>vs 252/80 Lugia: 91.59%+ (OHKO with Stealth Rock)</li> </ul> <p>Surf:</p> <ul> <li>vs 248/252+ Giratina: 26.83% - 31.61%</li> <li>vs 0/0 Palkia 28.04% - 33.02%</li> <li>vs 4/252+ Blissey 37.88% - 44.79%</li> <li>vs 252/252+ Ferrothorn 39.2% - 46.31% (Possible 2HKO with Stealth Rock)</li> <li>vs 252/4 Arceus (resist) 40.77% - 47.97% (Possible 2HKO with Stealth Rock)</li> <li>vs 252/0 Zekrom 52.72% - 62.13% (2HKO)</li> <li>vs 252/80 Lugia 66.59% - 78.61% (Possible OHKO with Stealth Rock)</li> </ul> <p>In essence, Choice Specs Kyogre has very few safe switch-ins at first--only the likes of defensive Ludicolo, specially defensive Giratina, Palkia, and Water-immune Pokemon can switch in to Water Spout repeatedly. However, the number of potential checks and counters grows as Kyogre loses HP. To avoid this problem somewhat, Kyogre can opt for Hydro Pump instead of Surf to 2HKO Ferrothorn, at the cost of the perfect accuracy of Surf. One can also trade HP for some Speed to outrun certain threats, such as Tyranitar, or run 252 Speed with a Timid nature for better sweeping prospects, but Kyogre really appreciates the added bulk from 252 HP EVs.</p> <p>The quirky nature of Water Spout gives this set some serious drawbacks. If Kyogre is damaged significantly while locked into Water Spout, the opponent essentially has a free turn as Kyogre is forced out. Additionally, this set is liable to being revenge killed by many faster threats in Ubers, including Dialga, Palkia, Zekrom, and Shaymin-S. While prediction or persistence can deal with Palkia, such is hardly an ideal solution, and coverage will not be enough to stave off Gastrodon, Ludicolo, or Chansey. Considering that Water-resistant Arceus formes and Ferrothorn can also switch in when Kyogre is weakened, one must be careful with the power wielded, so that Kyogre is not easily reduced to setup bait. On the other hand, just about every Pokemon switching into Water Spout will be heavily damaged, helping to pave the way for other attackers to pull off a clean sweep.</p> <p>It may strike some as ironic that Groudon is one of Kyogre's best partners. Groudon's stats and typing are well-suited to deal with some of Kyogre's most common, dangerous predators, including Zekrom and Dialga. Groudon also has Stealth Rock to help Kyogre to land some of its KOs. If Groudon's Drought is a turn-off, Arceus-Ground can play a very similar role and has more balanced defensive stats than Groudon. Ferrothorn can also help to tank attacks from Gastrodon, Palkia, Ludicolo (to an extent), and Zekrom. Skarmory is a decent alternative to Ferrothorn that fares better against Arceus and Arceus-Ground, but far worse against Zekrom.</p> <p>For Chansey and Blissey, one can employ a trapping combo of Wobbuffet and a Pursuit user. Wobbuffet uses Encore and Tickle to make them helpless against a switch to Scizor or Tyranitar. Wobbuffet is also useful to get rid of Choice Scarf Zekrom and Palkia. Mixed Palkia and mixed Dialga are good alternatives to take care of the pink blobs as well as Giratina, relying on luring and hitting hard with physical attacks rather than trapping. Palkia in particular benefits from a boosted Aqua Tail for this purpose.</p> <p>To take maximum advantage of Water Spout, fast Taunt leads, such as Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S, and Rapid Spin users, such as Excadrill and Forretress, make good partners. Bulky Excadrill in particular provides an excellent Thunder switch-in, while in return, Kyogre's rain removes one of its weaknesses. Kyogre also appreciates Wish support to restore Water Spout to usable power levels. Jirachi is especially good for this role because of its excellent defensive typing in the rain and its ability to paralyze switch-ins with Body Slam or Thunder Wave. Blissey is also a good Wish supporter because of its huge HP stat, but Jirachi tends to gel better with Kyogre; the choice really depends on the rest of the team.</p> <p>Tornadus is also worth a mention. It has very good offensive coverage, benefits from a perfectly accurate Hurricane, and can really weaken Ferrothorn. Additionally, if it is about to be KOed, it can use priority Tailwind, giving Kyogre a prime opportunity to sweep without faster revenge killers getting in its way.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>This is a simple bulky Calm Mind set with two coverage moves, which allows Kyogre to attempt a sweeper role, using its power and bulk to make up for its low Speed. The main advantage over the Choice sets is that Kyogre can take special hits from opponents like Palkia much better due to the Calm Mind boosts. In fact, after one Calm Mind, Palkia fails to 2HKO Kyogre with Thunder without a Life Orb or Choice Specs boost, while Kyogre easily 2HKOes with its own Thunder. Kyogre can also be more of a team player with Scald--since physical attackers such as Zekrom love to switch in on Kyogre, Kyogre can potentially burn them and effectively neuter them.</p> <p>The EVs depend on whether bulk or Speed is more desirable. For a faster Kyogre, a 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe EV spread with a Timid nature is recommended for tying with other base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Dialga, though a Modest nature is an acceptable alternative. On the other hand, the lost HP is quite significant, and there aren't many common Pokemon in Ubers to outrun within the possible Speed range.</p> <p>Zekrom, Ferrothorn, and Bulk Up Dialga are some of the most effective checks. In particular, +1 Kyogre cannot 2HKO Ferrothorn before it is 2HKOed by Power Whip, and Bulk Up Dialga can simply set up a counter-sweep. Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Excadrill take care of both Zekrom and Bulk Up Dialga, and each has its advantages. Mixed Zekrom resists both of Ferrothorn's STAB moves and threatens a Focus Blast, while SubCharge Magnezone, Arceus-Steel, and Lugia can easily set up on Ferrothorn or phaze it. On the other hand, one can elect to use Scald and burn all three of these counters (though Bulk Up Dialga commonly uses Rest and Sleep Talk), to support another sweeper with the same counters, such as Manaphy or Arceus-Water.</p> <p>Paralysis support is extremely helpful for minimizing the damage that Kyogre has to take, both because of the Special Defense boosts from Calm Mind and because some of Kyogre's checks, such as Arceus-Grass and Choice Scarf Zekrom, are faster and will not appreciate the paralysis. Jirachi is a great paralysis supporter for Kyogre because of its Steel typing, which blocks Toxic and Grass- and Dragon-type assaults, and the fact that its only effective weakness in the rain is Ground. It also has the option of using Body Slam instead of Thunder Wave, which can be useful to paralyze Garchomp and Arceus-Ground on the switch and render them nearly incapable of revenge killing Kyogre. Ferrothorn is a good alternative; it benefits from Steel typing, and resists both of Kyogre's weaknesses. Arceus-Grass may not have the Steel typing, but it is a good alternative nonetheless due to its great bulk and ability to take on Zekrom.</p> <p>Wobbuffet can be a very effective partner for this set. Paired with a Pursuit user such as Scizor or Tyranitar, Wobbuffet can put an abrupt end to Blissey and Chansey, using Tickle to bring them into the OHKO range of Pursuit. Wobbuffet can also remove the dangerous Choice Scarf Zekrom. Finally, by trapping an opponent and locking it into an inconsequential move, Wobbuffet can create a prime opportunity for Kyogre to set up at least one Calm Mind. Tornadus is another plausible teammate because it benefits from a perfectly accurate Hurricane. It can also use priority Tailwind just before it is KOed, giving Kyogre a prime opportunity to set up and sweep with its Speed temporarily fixed.</p>"
      },
      "Mono-Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set trades coverage moves for the ability to recover HP with Rest + Sleep Talk, making it an extremely \"heavy\" sweeper that becomes hard to stop once it gets going. This set will eventually defeat even Chansey and Blissey by healing and ridding itself of status ailments. Thus, the set uses a heavily physically defensive EV spread to maximize the defensive stat that Calm Mind does not boost. Scald becomes a great STAB move here, able to burn physical attackers to make Kyogre even harder to KO, though Surf is still well worth using. However, the opponent can exploit Kyogre's relative vulnerability while asleep, as Sleep Talk often picks the wrong move, essentially skipping crucial turns.</p> <p>This set's biggest problem is opposing Calm Mind users. In particular, Calm Mind users that resist Water, such as Giratina, Giratina-O, Latias, Manaphy, and Arceus-Dragon, wall this Kyogre completely and heavily pressure it into using Rest or switching out. Strong physical attackers also pose problems, especially Zekrom and Rayquaza, as they resist Surf, though both of them are afraid of Scald. Zekrom is a much bigger problem for this set than others, as it can switch in more easily and smack Kyogre to oblivion regardless of its defensive EVs. Ludicolo and Gastrodon wall this set completely as well. With Scald, this RestTalk variant has a good chance of beating Ferrothorn, but if the burn doesn't go through, Ferrothorn will prevail with Power Whip and Leech Seed.</p> <p>Considering that Dragon-types are such an issue, Choice Scarf Garchomp and Choice Scarf Zekrom are natural choices for partners, as they are excellent revenge killers and can pick off the opponent's Dragon-types to make way for Kyogre's sweep. Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Excadrill are also good partners for dealing with Zekrom and Bulk Up Dialga, and they can take advantage of burns that Kyogre may cause if it is running Scald. Also, Gliscor can switch into Zekrom to set up a Substitute stalling strategy. If Ludicolo and Gastrodon are problems, Ferrothorn can wall them, though it must watch out for Ludicolo's Focus Blast. Mixed Zekrom or Groudon can be used to lure Ferrothorn and beat it down with Focus Blast or Fire Blast, respectively, while SubCharge Magnezone, Giratina-O, Arceus-Steel, and Lugia easily tank Ferrothorn's attacks and phaze or set up on it. Another advantage of all of these examples is that they can use their powerful physical attacks to ward off specially defensive walls and force other Pokemon to take damage, paving the way for these walls to face a setup attempt by Kyogre.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Although most sets focus on taking advantage of Kyogre's fabulous base 150 Special Attack combined with Drizzle and its famous Water Spout, its amazing base 140 Special Defense, which is higher than Blissey's, is often overlooked. While obviously having a lot less HP than Blissey, Kyogre has several advantages over her as a special wall. Kyogre brings weather support to your team and has certain resistances which are crucial to walling extremely powerful attackers, such as Choice Specs Reshiram, who can 2HKO even Blissey under the sun.</p> <p>With a specially defensive spread, Kyogre becomes a fabulous check to several top threats in the metagame. Kyurem-W, the hardest hitting special Dragon, might not even 2HKO Kyogre with Choice Specs Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Kyogre also becomes a great check to most Calm Mind Arceus formes bar Grass and Electric, which are both rare in the current metagame. Even Arceus-Electric will not enjoy repeated Scalds and potential burns on the switch, leaving Arceus-Grass as the only Arceus forme that can beat this Kyogre without fail, though an unboosted Judgment will not 2HKO. Kyogre can choose to either try to burn them and then Roar them out or Roar them out immediately unless sleeping.</p> <p>If you're Darkrai weak, this Kyogre is the biggest check you can think of outside of Arceus-Fighting. Not only can it absorb sleep for your team, but it also doesn't take much damage from Darkrai's attacks, can Roar it out or 2HKO it in its sleep with Scald, and if Scald burns, KO it in two turns with burn damage. However, keep in mind that, if you get really unlucky with Sleep Talk, Darkrai might 3HKO Kyogre with +2 Dark Pulse combined with Bad Dreams.</p> <p>Rest gives Kyogre a way to repeatedly switch in and check the threats it needs to deal with. Kyogre can heal up after tanking a Draco Meteor from Reshiram, Kyurem-W, Latias, Latios, or Dialga. This is especially useful when they try to KO with two consecutive Draco Meteors, and if it Rests as they attack, it will wall them easily, because it is generally slower than them with this set. Sleep Talk is Kyogre's only chance to do something while sleeping. Surprisingly, this Kyogre is actually great at checking Palkia, a common check to most Kyogre sets, as Thunder doesn't even 2HKO from full health. Keep in mind, Kyogre will still lose to Palkia one-on-one and Choice Specs versions will still 2HKO you with Thunder. Pairing this set up with Ferrothorn is a good idea to completely wall Choiced Palkia, but beware of Lustrous Orb or mixed variants.</p> <p>The EVs are quite simple: 248 HP EVs instead of 252 HP so you have an odd HP number which is helpful versus Leech Seed, Stealth Rock, and Spikes at times, max Special Defense EVs because special walling is the purpose of the set, and the rest thrown in Defense. Running a Sassy Nature coupled with 0 Speed IVs is an option to almost always ensure rain on Turn one versus an opposing Groudon lead if you want momentum from the start. Thunder Wave is an option over Roar that you can be used to paralyze Calm Mind Arceus and switch to a Pokemon like Zekrom to beat it, but Roar is almost always the best choice to phaze and prevent setup from dangerous sweepers such as Rayquaza, which resists Scald and negates rain with Air Lock. Because this Kyogre works well with entry hazards, Roar is the best choice to take advantage of them.</p> <p>Surf is an option over Scald if your team is reliant on poison or paralysis support or if you want some additional power from your Kyogre. However, keep in mind that the power increase is hardly noticeable on this Kyogre as it is very weak compared to other Kyogre sets. Burning potential checks such as Palkia and Ferrothorn can also go a long way in wearing them down.</p> <p>The usual Kyogre counters still beat this set. Ferrothorn is more annoying than ever as it can pound Kyogre hard with Power Whip and will win unless it is burned by Scald. Kyogre also barely scratches Latias with Scald, but she barely even has a chance to 2HKO it with Grass Knot or Thunder even while running an offensive spread, meaning it can go for a phaze or a burn. It is advisable to pack a Latias check such as Tyranitar when using this Kyogre set, because Calm Mind Latias can still easily beat Kyogre once she can no longer be Roared out.</p> <p>Zekrom still murders this Kyogre with its STAB Bolt Strike but must watch out for a burn on the switch in. Mewtwo bypasses the specially defensive EV spread with Psystrike and can OHKO at +1 with a Life Orb. Offensive Groudon's boosted Earthquake will easily OHKO this Kyogre set, as Kyogre's Defense is rather bad by Ubers standards. Ho-Oh can 2HKO this set easily with Brave Bird and is capable of tanking a Scald due to its huge Special Defense and this Kyogre's lack of Special Attack investment. Shaymin-S can easily switch in on this set, due to its relatively weak Scald, and Seed Flare will 2HKO. The Choice Specs set will also OHKO Kyogre with Leaf Storm.</p> <p>Ferrothorn, Dialga, Giratina-O, and Tyranitar all make good partners for this set, and all of them besides Giratina-O can check Latias. Ferrothorn, Dialga, and Giratina-O resist both Electric- and Grass-type attacks, while Kyogre can easily tank Fire- and Ice-type attacks in return. Tyranitar easily traps Choice attackers, such as Palkia locked into Thunder trying to kill Kyogre. Genesect can switch in on Latias and beat it with U-turn and is capable of beating Shaymin-S as well.</p>"
      },
      "Thunder Wave": {
        "description": "<p>Kyogre can be useful as a lure for fast attackers and leads. It can be used as one of a team's lead options, standing up well to many opposing leads thanks to its bulk. Darkrai loses if Kyogre runs Lum Berry, and Groudon loses to Kyogre's STAB. Faster leads play a risky game between laying Stealth Rock on a Thunder Wave and using Taunt on an attack. When not leading, Kyogre can lure unsuspecting switch-ins, such as Zekrom, Palkia, and Shaymin-S, and cripple them with Thunder Wave; many of Kyogre's common switch-ins do not like Thunder Wave at all.</p> <p>Kyogre's paralysis support can turn \"counters\" such as Choice Scarf Palkia into bait for slower sweepers, such as Dialga, Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Garchomp. Jirachi and Shaymin-S also love the paralysis support because it combines with their Serene Grace-boosted flinching moves to keep their opponents immobile. Ground-type teammates especially appreciate the opportunity to switch into Electric-type attacks, as well as the paralysis support. Dialga also walls Gastrodon and really benefits from the paralysis support. However, there are still a few holes; Ferrothorn, Chansey, and Blissey don't mind anything that Kyogre throws at them. A combination of Tickle Wobbuffet and a Pursuit user (Tyranitar and Scizor are typically the best for this role) should be considered for dealing with Chansey and Blissey quickly, though Bulk Up Dialga, mixed Dialga, and mixed Palkia also work. Ferrothorn falls to strong Fighting-type moves like Mixed Zekrom's Focus Blast. It is also susceptible to setup or phazing by the likes of Arceus-Steel, Giratina-O, SubCharge Magnezone, and Lugia.</p>"
      },
      "SubCM": {
        "description": "<p>Substitute is a natural move to consider for a slow, bulky sweeper like Kyogre. The ability to make 101 HP Substitutes is especially notable for allowing Kyogre to set up on Chansey and Blissey, though Kyogre loses some coverage in exchange. Substitute is also an effective scouting tool in general, particularly when Zekrom is on the prowl. Speed isn't very important here due to all the setup time required to pull this set off, so one should just invest in HP and Special Attack to hit hard. Scald is an option to cripple physical attackers.</p> <p>This Kyogre has room for only one coverage move. Without Ice Beam, Kyogre is stopped by and vulnerable to Dragon-types, such as Latias, Arceus-Dragon, and Zekrom, but without Thunder, Manaphy, Arceus-Water, and opposing Kyogre will wall this set. One can use bulky Steel-types to deal with the aforementioned Dragon-types. Jirachi and Ferrothorn in particular can use Thunder Wave or Body Slam to paralyze faster opponents, such as Latias, Garchomp, and the many formes of Arceus. To take on opposing Kyogre, one should turn to specially bulky partners, such as Blissey, Dialga, and Water-resistant Arceus formes.</p> <p>Some threats pose a severe problem regardless of the coverage move used. Bulk Up Dialga and Choice Scarf Zekrom are among the most prominent of these because of their powerful physical moves, and Ferrothorn also proves threatening because it can 2HKO Kyogre while Kyogre cannot 2HKO back with a Calm Mind boost. Toxic Spikes in particular can be a huge problem to SubCM Kyogre because poison nullifies its ability to beat Chansey and Blissey. Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Excadrill are great partners for this reason, as they can deal with the likes of Bulk Up Dialga and Choice Scarf Zekrom. Arceus-Steel, SubCharge Magnezone, and Lugia are also plausible teammates because they can switch into Ferrothorn and easily set up or phaze it away. Mixed Zekrom works in a similar way, threatening a Focus Blast. Toxic Spikes can be absorbed through Arceus-Poison or Tentacruel, or removed by Rapid Spin from Forretress or Excadrill.</p>"
      },
      "ChestoRest": {
        "description": "<p>This set can be considered a cross between the slow mono-attacker set and other Calm Mind sets. By using Chesto Berry for a one-time free Rest before sweeping, Kyogre avoids the vulnerable period of sleep while retaining the ability to rid itself of status. Since Kyogre only gets one free Rest, this set requires some care to pull off. The Chesto Berry also provides insurance against Darkrai. The slow nature of this set emphasizes a need to concentrate on power and overall bulk, rather than on Speed.</p> <p>Having only one coverage move leaves Kyogre vulnerable to different groups of enemies depending on what it runs. Without Ice Beam, Kyogre is vulnerable to Dragon-types such as Latias and Arceus-Dragon, while forgoing Thunder opens it up to Manaphy, Arceus-Water, and opposing Kyogre. Jirachi and Ferrothorn can be useful for fighting Dragon-types, resisting their STAB moves and using Thunder Wave or Body Slam to paralyze them. Alternatively, revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Zekrom and Choice Scarf Garchomp, can be used, though users of this set should not rely too much on switching Kyogre out to deal with threats. Opposing Kyogre can be checked with specially bulky partners, such as Chansey, Blissey, Dialga, and Water-resistant Arceus formes.</p> <p>Regardless of the coverage move, Kyogre is weak against Zekrom, Ferrothorn, Bulk Up Dialga, Ludicolo, Gastrodon, and opposing Calm Mind users. Zekrom and Ferrothorn easily destroy Kyogre, Ferrothorn 2HKOing Kyogre with Power Whip before Kyogre can 2HKO back, while Bulk Up Dialga can set up on Kyogre, even using Rest to rid itself of burns. Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Excadrill can deal with Zekrom and Bulk Up Dialga reasonably well. A Ferrothorn of one's own is another good option because it can deal with Zekrom, Ludicolo, and Gastrodon, though the former two may carry Focus Blast with the intent to remove Ferrothorn. Of course, this also makes said Pokemon good partners to get rid of opposing Ferrothorn.</p>"

  "Groudon": {
    "overview": "<p>Groudon continues to leave its mark on the Ubers metagame even in the 5th generation. Its massive Attack, great physical movepool, powerful STAB Earthquake, and access to Rock Polish and Swords Dance make it a deadly physical sweeper. Drought also gives Groudon a useful niche for bringing on permanent sunlight, powering up Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Venusaur, and Reshiram while fueling devastating sun-based strategies. Groudon's excellent bulk also allows it to function well as a defensive Pokemon, countering top physical threats such as Rayquaza, Lucario, Zekrom, Terrakion, and Garchomp, while supporting its team with moves such as Stealth Rock, Dragon Tail, Thunder Wave, and Toxic. Groudon's ability to sweep, support, or do both make it a massive threat to any team, with its only real flaws being its modest Special Defense and Speed stats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar is an option over Dragon Tail to phaze Pokemon that may try to set up a Substitute on Groudon, but Dragon Tail carries the nice advantage of being able to phaze through Taunt. Groudon does have a good special movepool, but its only average Special Attack means it won't be sweeping with special attacks anytime soon. The only special attack that's really worth using is Overheat to nail Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn. Safeguard stops Giratina from screwing over Groudon with Will-O-Wisp while providing the team with status protection. Rest + Sleep Talk gets a mention for being Groudon's only form of recovery. Hammer Arm is Groudon's strongest attack against Arceus, but otherwise doesn't have too much utility. Lava Plume is usable if you want to try and spread burns around while having a move to hit Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Cresselia is the best counter to Groudon that exists. It can easily come in on Earthquake and proceed to wear it down with Ice Beam. Cresselia also takes a pittance from all of Groudon's other attacks, and can heal itself with sun-boosted Moonlight, only fearing the rare Toxic. Arceus-Grass resists Groudon's STAB Earthquake, is faster, and easily OHKOes with Judgment. However, Arceus-Grass must watch out for Overheat and Fire Punch. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S can outspeed all variants of Groudon and OHKO with Seed Flare, but it only really likes coming in on Earthquake. Kyogre can switch in on defensively-built Groudon, and OHKO with Surf. A physically defensive Kyogre can also take on the Rock Polish set. However, Kyogre will be worn down quickly by repeated Earthquakes. Giratina, Lugia, and Skarmory are also good options to wall Groudon. However, Lugia hates Stone Edge and being statused, and Skarmory will not enjoy an Overheat to the beak. Finally, poisoning Groudon is a good way to wear it down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Groudon is quite a good physical wall. With the given EVs, it can take powerful physical hits such as a +2 Outrage from Garchomp, a +2 Dragon Claw from Rayquaza, a +2 Close Combat from Lucario and Terrakion, and repeated Outrages from Zekrom, and deal with them easily with either Earthquake or Stone Edge, depending on what is appropriate. Groudon also isn't setup bait either, thanks to its base 150 Attack stat and Dragon Tail, making it a good defensive back up for stall and balanced teams alike.</p> <p>Earthquake provides STAB, and allows Groudon to take a decent chunk out of anything that doesn't resist it. Stone Edge is mainly there for Rayquaza and Ho-Oh, OHKOing the former after Stealth Rock damage and one turn of Life Orb recoil, and always OHKOing the latter. Fire Blast is also an option to hit other Groudon and Gliscor harder while also busting up Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Stealth Rock is Groudon's preferred support option as it is one of the few viable users of the move in Ubers, and Groudon doesn't have any other notable supporting moves to replace it with. However, Fire Blast should only be used if Groudon also runs Dragon Tail and if the team has reliable ways around Ho-Oh. Dragon Tail provides Groudon with the ability to phaze while also nailing Giratina-O, Rayquaza, Zekrom, and Palkia for decent damage. Thunder Wave and Toxic can also be used to cripple Lugia switch-ins and to provide general team support.</p> <p>The given EVs provide Groudon with the best possible physical defense, but if you would prefer to have Groudon be able to survive more special attacks, an EV spread of 252 HP / 32 Def / 224 SpD with a Careful nature is an option. This spread allows Groudon to take 2 Spacial Rends from Choice Scarf Palkia and live to tell the tale, and it also makes it capable of taking a Draco Meteor from Mixed Zekrom more effectively. Not even an unboosted Seed Flare from Shaymin-S can OHKO a specially defensive Groudon. Groudon will also still have enough Defense to survive a Life Orb-boosted Outrage from Rayquaza after it has used Dragon Dance once.</p> <p>Overheat and Fire Punch are two other Fire-type attacks Groudon can consider using on this set. Overheat does more damage than Fire Blast, but the drop in Special Attack that comes after using it will make it easier to stall out. Fire Punch runs off of Groudon's higher Attack stat and is guaranteed to OHKO a specially defensive Ferrothorn, but it isn't of much help against Gliscor, Skarmory, or other Groudon.</p> <p>This set is more troubled by Shaymin-S, Wobbuffet, and Kyogre than Groudon's other sets; they can switch in and proceed to trap Groudon with Shadow Tag (in Wobbuffet's case), or OHKO it with a powerful STAB attack. Forretress can help against Wobbuffet by setting up Toxic Spikes, which will limit the number of times it can come in. Zekrom can handle Shaymin-S and defensive variants of Kyogre easily with Bolt Strike, while Palkia can come in on offensive Kyogre variants and 2HKO with Thunder. Blissey is also a good teammate in general, as it can sponge the inevitable special attacks aimed at Groudon's hide with its vast rolls of pink fat.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>Groudon's enormous Attack and middling Speed stats allow it to capitalize on Rock Polish quite effectively. After one use, Groudon reaches 520 Speed, enough to outrun anything slower than Choice Scarf Terrakion. From there, Groudon can sweep pretty easily with its mighty STAB Earthquake.</p> <p>Dragon Claw enables Groudon to hit the Dragon-types that are immune to Earthquake, such as Latias, Latios, Rayquaza, and Giratina-O, while having a much higher chance of OHKOing the likes of Palkia and Garchomp. Stone Edge's main purpose is to 2HKO Lugia, but it is useful for hitting Flying-types in general, such as Ho-Oh. Overheat, however, provides completely unresisted coverage, and easily OHKOes Skarmory and Ferrothorn while 2HKOing Bronzong. It also cooks bulky Grass-types such as Arceus-Grass to a delicious crisp. Swords Dance is also an option over Dragon Claw. Groudon has excellent two-move coverage in Earthquake and Stone Edge, so it can use Swords Dance to increase its already great Attack stat to a jaw-dropping 872, letting it OHKO pretty much everything that doesn't resist its attacks. Swords Dance also lets Groudon break through stall teams more easily, but it can be difficult to get in both a Swords Dance and a Rock Polish without assistance from Wobbuffet or dual screens.</p> <p>The EVs give Groudon as much power as possible while giving Groudon enough Speed to hit the magic number of 520 after a Rock Polish. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to provide some extra bulk. An Adamant nature is used to make the most out of Groudon's beefy Attack stat. However, a Jolly nature with an EV spread of 4 Def / 252 Atk / 252 Spe can be used to outrun certain Pokemon that could otherwise revenge kill Groudon, such as Choice Scarf Shaymin-S. Be warned, however, that using Jolly will cost Groudon a significant amount of power.</p> <p>The main Pokemon Groudon will have trouble breaking past are Giratina, Lugia, Skarmory, and Arceus-Grass. Giratina can handle all of Groudon's attacks without any problems whatsoever, and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Lugia is weak to Stone Edge, and will lose if Groudon is packing Swords Dance as well, but a miss can allow Lugia time to use Toxic. Skarmory can handle all of Groudon's attacks except for the occasional Overheat, and either use Toxic, or set up Spikes. Arceus-Grass is bulky enough to survive an Overheat from Groudon, and doesn't care about any of its other moves. Groudon will be forced to switch out lest it feels like being OHKOed by STAB Judgment from Arceus-Grass. Defensive Kyogre, Wobbuffet, and Giratina-O also pose a threat to Groudon, as they can handle one hit from the Continent Pokemon and OHKO back with Surf, Counter, or Draco Meteor, respectively. Finally, Choice Scarf Shaymin-S can also outspeed Groudon unless it is Jolly, and OHKO with Seed Flare.</p> <p>Zekrom is an excellent teammate for Rock Polish Groudon. Lugia, Skarmory, and Kyogre are all dealt with by a quick Bolt Strike while Giratina and Giratina-O get crushed by a mighty Draco Meteor. Zekrom also resists Shaymin-S's Seed Flare, and is capable of OHKOing it with Bolt Strike. Palkia is notable for being able to switch in on Kyogre more easily, but it fares worse against Lugia than Zekrom does. Ho-Oh benefits from the sunlight Groudon provides and easily wrecks Arceus-Grass, Shaymin-S, and Skarmory with its powerful STAB Sacred Fire. Heatran can also take down Arceus-Grass, Skarmory, and Shaymin-S easily with Fire Blast, and it is also a great check to Giratina-O that lack Earthquake. Tyranitar can also remove Giratina-O from the match permanently, and its powerful STAB Crunch also gives Lugia a tough time. Entry hazards in the form of Stealth Rock and Spikes are also helpful to weaken Groudon's checks more quickly, easing its sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Paradancer": {
        "description": "<p>This is one of Groudon's more versatile sets, for it can both sweep and support the rest of the team. This set also lets it beat some of its counters. When first bringing Groudon in early game, you should usually use Thunder Wave. Generally, most things that switch into Groudon, such as Lugia, Shaymin-S, Kyogre, and Arceus-Grass, are neither Ground-types nor very slow, and therefore loathe paralysis. Late game, when a sufficient amount of your foe's team is paralyzed, Groudon can waltz right back in and set up a Swords Dance on something that doesn't threaten it, and proceed to sweep. Even Lugia will be taken down by a boosted Stone Edge after Stealth Rock damage has been taken into account, and it should hopefully be paralyzed and therefore slower than Groudon so it cannot use Roost to negate its weakness to Rock-type attacks.</p> <p>The given EVs look complicated but are actually very straightforward. 200 HP EVs afford Groudon the ability to take more hits while rounding down residual damage incurred from poison or Spikes. 200 Attack EVs usually guarantee that Lugia will be felled by a +2 Stone Edge after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs go to Defense for durability. For example, this Groudon set is still capable of surviving a +1 Outrage from a Rayquaza toting Life Orb.</p> <p>This set generally likes teammates that benefit from the paralysis it spreads, as well as those that appreciate having Lugia out of the way. Mixed Dialga, in additional to loving paralysis support, can easily destroy Giratina-O and Skarmory, two things that can take on this set. Choice Specs Kyogre also loves having Arceus-Grass paralyzed so that it cannot Recover before the bloated blue whale defeats it with Ice Beam. Kyogre is also a wonderful counter for Cresselia, another Pokemon that gives this set trouble. Most other slow yet strong Pokemon such as Giratina-O, Reshiram, and Zekrom, will cherish the paralysis support Groudon provides as well.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Band, Groudon reaches a titanic 657 Attack stat, allowing it to OHKO or 2HKO pretty much everything in the game thanks to its great type coverage. Earthquake is extremely powerful, and allows Groudon to OHKO even Kyogre after Stealth Rock damage. Dragon Claw destroys Giratina-O and Rayquaza switch-ins, and is a nice move to use when you have no idea what's coming in due to the great neutral coverage Dragon-type attacks possess. Stone Edge 2HKOes Lugia, and OHKOes Ho-Oh and Shaymin-S. Fire Punch gains pseudo-STAB courtesy of Drought, which makes it a very powerful attack capable of OHKOing Ferrothorn and 2HKOing Skarmory, Bronzong, and Arceus-Grass. Shadow Claw is also an option as it is Groudon's best attack against Cresselia, but even then it probably won't 2HKO the celestial duck.</p> <p>Generally, Groudon should open up with one of its coverage moves as the first strike. Your opponent will generally switch in something that is immune to or resists Earthquake, such as Lugia, Arceus-Grass, Giratina-O or Skarmory, so something like throwing out a simple Stone Edge can gash them badly, making them easier for Groudon to break through if they try to come back in. It is a bad idea to mindlessly spam Earthquake should your opponent still have Pokemon with immunities to Ground-type attacks, otherwise Groudon risks becoming setup bait.</p> <p>Generally, this set will appreciate the same teammates as the Rock Polish set, but paralysis support is also recommended to use alongside this set to make up for the low Speed. Lugia, Dialga, Kyogre, Arceus-Grass, and Ferrothorn can all make good use of Thunder Wave to slow down your opponent's team, paving the way for a Groudon sweep. Jirachi also gets special mention as its Body Slam can paralyze Ground-types such as Garchomp and enemy Groudon.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>This set chooses to forgo the common Groudon ideals of supporting, tanking, and boosting; instead, it chooses to become an offensive lead capable of beating all users of Rapid Spin and the all-too-common lead Dialga. This set is also a nasty surprise for physically defensive Kyogre, which likes to switch in on support Groudon, 2HKOing it without fail; Chansey, who is capable of walling the support set, cannot take two Earthquakes from this beast.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is that all-important hazard that every team requires, and this set excels at setting it up after tearing some serious holes in the opposition. Earthquake is the obligatory STAB move, and Groudon actually possesses the strongest one in the game! Fire Punch allows Groudon to OHKO Ferrothorn and Forretress (provided Sturdy isn't active), and also deals heavy damage to Skarmory. Stone Edge paired with Earthquake provides almost impeccable neutral coverage, and is also capable of 2HKOing Pressure Lugia provided Groudon is using a Life Orb. Dragon Claw hits Giratina-O, Latias, and Latios hard, OHKOing the latter two and doing over 60% to the former, provided a Life Orb is used.</p> <p>This set's EVs eschew Groudon's great physical bulk, and instead are poured into Attack and Speed to maximize its offensive presence. However, when running a Jolly nature, 96 EVs can be moved from Speed into HP to give Groudon a bit of extra bulk; this spread outspeeds Mixed Dancer Rayquaza and all neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>A Life Orb is the preferred item to give a solid boost to all of Groudon's attacks, and is needed in order to 2HKO Lugia with Stone Edge and Giratina-O with Dragon Claw. However, Earth Plate is usable when running an Adamant nature, as it nabs the OHKO on support Dialga with Earthquake and bluffs a Choice Band set. Keep in mind Earth Plate should not be used with a Jolly nature, as Groudon can fail to OHKO 252 HP Dialga with Earthquake if it is not running an Adamant nature.</p> <p>Froslass makes a good teammate for this set, as the Spikes that it sets up can be kept on the field thanks to Groudon's ability to outspeed and OHKO all spinners under the sunlight. Ironically, the Pokemon that this very set aims to beat is also an excellent teammate; Dialga switches into Giratina, Lugia, Arceus-Grass, and Choice Scarf Kyogre relatively easily, and is capable of scaring all of them out with its powerful attacks. Chansey and Blissey also synergize well with Groudon, sponging special attacks coming from Shaymin-S, Mewtwo, Kyurem-W, and Darkrai, all of which outspeed Groudon and can either OHKO or incapacitate it.</p> <p>Groudon can choose to run Thunder Wave or Toxic over one of its coverage moves, but it is usually better off attacking. Swords Dance can also be run in the same slot, as it allows Groudon to pack some serious punch behind its attacks.</p> <p>Opposing support Groudon and Hippowdon are only 3HKOed by Life Orb Earthquake, so the former can set up Stealth Rock and then switch out while the latter can set up Stealth Rock and sandstorm, recover lost HP with Slack Off, and then phaze Groudon out whenever it pleases. Arceus-Grass resists Earthquake and isn't even close to being OHKOed by Fire Punch, and can OHKO Groudon in return with its STAB Judgment or Grass Knot. A physically defensive Giratina isn't 2HKOed by Life Orb Dragon Claw and can phaze or burn Groudon with Will-O-Wisp in return. A fast Lugia with Reflect won't be 2HKOed by Stone Edge, and can Ice Beam or Toxic Groudon to wear it down. Any super effective special attack or strong Draco Meteor will immediately obliterate this set, so play to this set's Speed investment and don't let Groudon take hits it doesn't have to.</p>"

  "Rayquaza": {
    "overview": "<p>When people think of a threatening Pokemon that can devastate teams in a matter of seconds, Rayquaza immediately comes to mind. With base offenses of 150 each, Rayquaza is by far one of Uber's most threatening wallbreakers and sweepers. Its great offensive typing coupled with boosting moves such as Dragon Dance and Swords Dance make Rayquaza an even bigger threat in seconds. If you thought having two of the most useful boosting moves as well as some of the best attacking stats in the game was threatening enough, it also gets an expansive movepool which includes the best priority move in the game, Extreme Speed. Rayquaza also has another tool it can use to great effect: its ability, Air Lock. Thanks to Air Lock, it negates weather and weather-related abilities, which means it can check Pokemon that rely on weather to sweep, such as Kingdra and Venusaur. Rayquaza is also a very versatile Pokemon, as its stats imply. It has the ability to run either physical or mixed sets, and it can run a boosting set or immediately go on the offensive with its powerful attacks. It can even use Choice items to become an even bigger threat.</p> <p>While one might look at Rayquaza and think \"this must be one of the hardest Pokemon to take down,\" it does have a few flaws. For one, thanks to its Flying typing, it has a weakness to Stealth Rock, the most common form of entry hazard, which limits its ability to switch in. Its defenses, which are low by Uber standards, don't help this cause either. Nevertheless, Rayquaza still remains one of the most threatening sweepers in the Uber tier, and it can demolish teams in a heartbeat if given the chance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Focus Sash Dragon Dance lead is viable and almost always gets at least one kill. However, it lacks power and can't sweep late game. A Choice Specs set is a viable option on Rayquaza, as it can surprise its usual switch-ins. Generally, Dialga and Palkia are better choices for this, as Rayquaza can destroy Lugia with its mixed set just as easily, while Palkia and Dialga lack Rayquaza's weakness to Stealth Rock. Thunder Wave can cripple Pokemon like Choice Scarf Dialga switching into Rayquaza, but you shouldn't really be focusing on this and you should focus more on setting Rayquaza up. Ice Beam is pretty useless with Draco Meteor, but it can knock down Groudon without suffering a Special Attack drop. Rayquaza is capable of producing 101 HP Substitutes if you want to block any attempts of Seismic Toss or status. However, the amount of EVs needed to make 101 HP Subs just isn't worth the use. Bulk Up is rather novelty but you can use this move to survive a Choice Banded Stone Edge from Groudon and OHKO back with Outrage if you're holding a Life Orb. Toxic can poison Lugia on the switch, making it useless at tanking, but once again you should be more focused on sweeping. Sleep Talking an Outrage doesn't lock you into it, so that's an option. Rest can be used for defensive purposes, but it is rather novelty because Rayquaza dies very quickly. Crunch is a reasonable option on the Dragon Dance set, as it can hit the Psychic-type Ubers hard without resorting to Outrage. Tailwind is another nice option for Rayquaza, as it allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Palkia, Salamence, and Hydreigon for 3 turns. However, Dragon Dance is usually a superior option in raising Speed, as it also raises Attack, though outpacing common Choice Scarf users is a nice plus to the move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>With base attacking stats of 150 each, a great offensive STAB, and an expansive movepool, Rayquaza has no true counters. As such, the best way to tackle Rayquaza is by revenge killing it. Choice Scarf users such as Palkia, Terrakion, Kyurem-W, Jirachi, and Garchomp can all check the Dragon Dance sets and take out Rayquaza easily due to its frailty. Meanwhile, Terrakion, Choice Scarf Dialga and Jirachi are capable of revenge killing the Swords Dance set due to resisting Extreme Speed. Palkia, Latios, Latias, Hydreigon, Garchomp, and Salamence can also revenge kill most Rayquaza sets other than the Dragon Dance set. However, they take a hefty amount of damage from a boosted Extreme Speed. For example, a Swords Dance-boosted Extreme Speed will OHKO both Latios and Latias. Pokemon packing powerful priority attacks such as Scizor, Mamoswine, and Arceus can KO Rayquaza without any worries. Ditto is also unique, as it can not only revenge kill Rayquaza but also copy any boost Rayquaza has gained, which means that it can end up sweeping due to Rayquaza's boosts.</p> <p>While revenge killing Rayquaza is usually the best way of dealing with it, there are other methods of taking out the powerful Pokemon. Lugia can still handle physical sets easily with Reflect, Roost and Ice Beam, especially Lugia that still have Multiscale intact. Dragon Dance Rayquaza needs Stealth Rock to get past it, too. Support Groudon also does a decent job at checking Rayquaza, and can phaze it away with Dragon Tail, doing a decent chunk of damage.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Rayquaza's Dragon Dance set is a beast feared ever since its release in 2003, and it continues to strike terror in the heart of its opponents. After one Dragon Dance, Rayquaza's Attack skyrockets to 598 while its Speed rests at 475, outpacing every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame bar Deoxys-S. Outrage is Rayquaza's most powerful physical STAB attack, and alongside with Earthquake, Rayquaza can hit nearly every single Pokemon in the tier for at least neutral damage. Overheat is used in the last slot to get rid of the Pokemon that would give Dragon Dance Rayquaza trouble otherwise: Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory.</p> <p>As Dragon Dance Rayquaza strives to be as fast and as powerful as possible, EVs are maxed out in both Attack and Speed with the remaining 4 EVs invested in Special Attack to give Overheat a little boost. As for alternative EV spreads, 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe can be used, as it outpaces +1 base 90 Pokemon after a single Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Because Jolly Rayquaza can't always OHKO Lugia with Outrage, Stone Edge can be used over Earthquake to give it just a little more edge in power. As Choice Scarf Kyogre, Dialga, Zekrom and Deoxys-A are usually using Modest, Adamant, or Mild, an Adamant nature can be used to increase damage output, though it leaves Rayquaza prone to being revenge killed by positive-natured Choice Scarf users. Also, Rayquaza should always run Extreme Speed while using Adamant or any other Attack-boosting nature to beat Deoxys-A. An Adamant nature also allows Rayquaza to OHKO maximum HP Arceus (89.9% - 105.6%, guaranteed OHKO with SR).</p> <p>Rayquaza can use Haban Berry over Life Orb. With a Haban Berry, Rayquaza has an easier time getting an extra Dragon Dance on Choice Scarf Palkia, Salamence, and Hydreigon, three of Dragon Dance Rayquaza's common revenge killers. Lum Berry can also be used to avoid status such as Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave, which are detrimental to Rayquaza's sweep. While it might seem like an unorthodox option, White Herb can be used with V-create to avoid the aftereffects, making for a devastating attack that is not only boosted by Dragon Dance, but also helps if your opponent runs more than one Steel-type on their team. Be warned, as this only works once. Without White Herb, V-create is bad for Dragon Dance Rayquaza, as it takes away the Speed gained from Dragon Dance, as well as opening up Rayquaza to priority attacks, such as Extreme Killer Arceus's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Like most other sweepers, Rayquaza prefers entry hazards to be set up. Stealth Rock is extremely useful, as it grants Rayquaza a chance to OHKO standard Lugia. Forretress and Deoxys-S can set up entry hazards with ease. Forretress deserves a special mention, as it has good synergy with Rayquaza, resisting Dragon- and Ice-type attacks, and can spin away enemy entry hazards. Paralysis support is also advised, as it makes Choice Scarf users such as Palkia unable to revenge kill Rayquaza. Lead Kyogre can fulfill this role well and also acts as a good Palkia lure. Substitute can also be used to beat Choice Scarf Palkia that switch in on Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Due to its frailty, Rayquaza is prone to revenge killing by Scarf users, such as Zekrom, Reshiram, Kyogre, and especially Pokemon such as Palkia, Salamence, and Hydreigon, all of which can outpace Rayquaza even at +1 Speed. As such, Wobbuffet is an excellent partner to Rayquaza, easily trapping and eliminating Scarf users. Wobbuffet can even use Encore and Safeguard to create an opening for Rayquaza to set up. Although Rayquaza is near unstoppable after a Dragon Dance, certain bulky walls can live an Outrage and KO Rayquaza in return. Defensive Groudon takes 59.4% - 70% from Jolly Life Orb Rayquaza's Outrage and can then use Stone Edge to do 63% - 74.1%, an OHKO factoring in Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage. Bold Lugia with maximum Defense investment will always survive an Outrage even after factoring in Stealth Rock damage, taking 61.3% - 72.1%. Lugia can easily KO Rayquaza with Ice Beam, factoring in Stealth Rock damage. Most Kyogre variants make good teammates with Rayquaza due to their ability to check Support Groudon. Thanks to Air Lock, the rain which Kyogre brings does not gimp Overheat's power.</p> <p>It should be noted that Outrage is not a move to be used lightly. Even at +1 Attack, most Steel-types such as Arceus-Steel and Ferrothorn can live an Outrage and proceed to cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave, set up Calm Minds or entry hazards, or just KO a weakened Rayquaza with Judgment and Gyro Ball, respectively. Scizor makes a good teammate with its STAB U-turn and nifty STAB Bullet Punch. Tickle Wobbuffet and Pursuit Scizor can easily eliminate any pesky Lugia, paving the way for Rayquaza to sweep. The infamous Double Dance strategy can be used with Salamence, thanks to Salamence being able to KO or severely weaken most of Rayquaza's checks, and vice versa, allowing for a cleaner sweep.</p> <p>To demonstrate the power of Dragon Dance Rayquaza, as well as how vital entry hazards are for Rayquaza's sweep, the below calculations will show how much damage Rayquaza does to the best physical walls in Ubers after a single Dragon Dance. All the calculations are assuming a Jolly nature and a Life Orb:</p> <ul> <li>Outrage vs. 252/176+ Lugia: 64.66 - 76.44%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 252/16 Lugia: 80.28 - 94.71%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 252/0 Arceus: 82.2 - 96.62%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 252/252+ Arceus: 61.26 - 72.07%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 252/252+ Groudon: 59.9 - 70.54%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 252/0 Dialga: 100.49 - 118.31%</li> <li>Outrage vs. 252/252+ Kyogre: 81.18 - 95.54%</li> </ul> <p>As you can see with the above calculations, with Stealth Rock and Spikes support, Rayquaza can get past even the bulkiest of Pokemon. As such, it is recommended that Rayquaza is used as a late game sweeper, as after residual damage and entry hazards, Rayquaza will be very difficult to stop.</p>"

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Mixed Rayquaza is one of the most powerful wallbreakers in the entire Uber tier. Base 150 Attack and Special Attack go a long way in helping Rayquaza pick walls apart. This set attempts to lure in and obliterate usual Rayquaza switch-ins with its powerful special attacks. A Draco Meteor coming off 399 Special Attack will severely dent anything not resisting it, including Groudon and Lugia, both of which are cleanly 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Any Steel-types courageous enough to face a Draco Meteor are swiftly barbecued by a Fire Blast. V-create can be used as Draco Meteor will weaken Fire Blast, but the stat drops from V-create aren't too hot either. Extreme Speed allows Rayquaza to take down weakened Pokemon and does decent damage even without investment. Outrage gives Rayquaza a powerful physical STAB move while Dragon Tail allows Rayquaza to scout any switch-ins.</p> <p>The EV spread shown above is used to give Draco Meteor and Fire Blast a major boost in power. However, if one decides that two attacks that lower Special Attack is too much, transfer the Special Attack EVs into Attack and use V-create. Not only does this boost V-create, but Outrage or Dragon Tail get boosted as well. As for the choice of nature, both Naive and Hasty are viable. However, Hasty is recommended because special attacks are far more common in Ubers. Also, a Speed-boosting nature helps Rayquaza outspeed all Pokemon with base 90 Speed. However, if outpacing base 90 Pokemon isn't important to you, a Mild or Rash nature with 252 Special Attacks EVs allow Mixed Rayquaza to OHKO support Groudon with Draco Meteor.</p> <p>This set can be used as an effective offensive lead to put immediate pressure on the opponent. While being used as a lead, Lum Berry is a very useful item because it allows Rayquaza to check any Darkrai hoping to set up on it. Focus Sash helps Rayquaza survive super effective hits which would normally OHKO it, but is near useless mid-game. However, Life Orb is by far the most useful item, as it allows Rayquaza to significantly increase its damage output.</p> <p>While the above moveset provides Rayquaza with a way to get past most Pokemon in the Ubers tier, there are two other attacks in Rayquaza's expansive movepool that stand out. Earthquake hits the one Pokemon that resists every other attack in this set, Heatran. It is also useful in hitting Dialga harder without locking Rayquaza into Outrage or losing Special Attack via Draco Meteor. If you don't want to lose Special Attack after every use of Draco Meteor, Dragon Pulse is a safe alternative that always hits for consistent damage, though it is much weaker than Draco Meteor, missing out on 2HKOs on Groudon and Lugia after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Because mixed Rayquaza lacks the sheer offensive power of Dragon Dance or Swords Dance Rayquaza, entry hazards go a long way in helping Rayquaza break down walls. Pokemon such as Forretress and Deoxys-S are both adept at setting up Stealth Rock. It must be noted that Mixed Rayquaza is not intended to be used as a sweeper; rather, it paves the way for another sweeper by removing or weakening its checks with its powerful Draco Meteors and Outrages. Lucario is an amazing partner because of the great synergy it shares with Rayquaza, and the fact that Rayquaza lures in and KOs both Groudon and Lugia, two of Lucario's greatest counters. Bulk Up Dialga makes a great partner too, as it can plow though teams once Groudon is gone. Mixed Rayquaza can utilize the Double Dragon strategy quite effectively with Dragon Dance Salamence or Choice Band Garchomp. Once Rayquaza has killed or sufficiently weakened dedicated walls such as Groudon and Lugia, Salamence or Garchomp can cleave through the rest of the team with their brute strength. However, this strategy isn't lightly adopted, as it makes the team doubly weak to Dragon- and Ice-type attacks. Scarf Jirachi and Terrakion are both good teammates, as they cover Rayquaza's weaknesses while Rayquaza can eliminate their checks in return.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Dancer": {
        "description": "<p>Similar to Salamence's old set in DPP, this Rayquaza set utilizes a lot of surprise factor to eliminate its usual counters. Unlike the Mixed Attacker set, this Rayquaza is easily able to sweep on its own, even after using Draco Meteor. This is likely Rayquaza's most independent set, not relying on teammates to take care of its usual checks and counters.</p> <p>The idea when using this set is to Dragon Dance up as Groudon or another physical wall switches in and go straight for the OHKO with Draco Meteor. With this strategy, you can easily sweep with Rayquaza should the opponent lack another check to it. Most teams do not carry extra checks to Rayquaza as its usage has dropped significantly. Outrage is Rayquaza's physical move of choice. Even with few Attack EVs, Rayquaza's Outrage is still incredibly powerful, easily 2HKOing 252/0 Kyogre. Ho-Oh is also cleanly OHKOed after Stealth Rock by either Draco Meteor or Outrage. Even if Stealth Rock is not up, Rayquaza can still smash Ho-Oh with a +1 Outrage, something the standard Mixed Rayquaza cannot do.</p> <p>The choice of Fire Blast or Earthquake is entirely up to your team's needs. Fire Blast utilizes this set's focus on Special Attack EVs, and OHKOes Skarmory, Forretress, Ferrothorn, Metagross, and Scizor, the former two assuming that Sturdy is broken. Earthquake on the other hand is boosted by Dragon Dance and smashes Dialga, Jirachi, and Heatran. Unfortunately, Rayquaza cannot carry five moves, so pick the one that suits your team best.</p> <p>Most people tend to overlook Rayquaza's massive Special Attack stat, which allows it to easily bash through its usual counters. Draco Meteor will easily OHKO Support Groudon, while even Lugia takes a massive 57.2% - 67.8%, which will 2HKO with Stealth Rock damage. This not only gives Rayquaza a chance to sweep, but also paves the way for other physical sweepers to sweep with Groudon out of the way. Draco Meteor tears off 69.8% - 82.4% from Support Arceus, taking it out with Spikes and Stealth Rock support. Other Arceus can be taken out as well. A boosted Outrage will still OHKO Arceus with little prior damage, so choose carefully when deciding whether to boost up or just attack right away against Arceus.</p> <p>This set greatly enjoys entry hazards support, as it is the only way Rayquaza can break through Lugia. Forretress and Deoxys-S make fantastic partners for this reason, and Forretress can also spin away entry hazards. Swords Dance Arceus is also incredibly annoying, as Extreme Speed will tear a chunk out of Rayquaza's health. Packing a check to it, such as Terrakion, is important for this set to function at its best, although Draco Meteor will likely OHKO Offensive Arceus after just Stealth Rock alone. Scizor's Bullet Punch can also rain on Rayquaza's parade, but Fire Blast OHKOes Scizor 100% of the time, even at -2 Special Attack.</p> <p>The reason for using a Mild or Rash nature on this set is to OHKO Groudon 100% of the time after just Stealth Rock damage. Rayquaza sadly fails to do that with a Hasty or Naive nature. Groudon will likely switch in on Rayquaza early in the match, so this is your best opportunity to surprise the opponent and take it out. The Special Attack EVs are crucial for Rayquaza to OHKO Groudon and stand a chance of KOing Offensive Arceus after Stealth Rock damage. Attack EVs are just leftover EVs, so you can just max out Speed if you do not mind a slightly less powerful Outrage or Earthquake. The Speed EVs allow Rayquaza to outspeed everything up to a neutral nature Deoxys-A and neutral nature Choice Scarf Pokemon with base 90 Speed at +1. Darkrai is a great partner for this set to take out Lugia, while Rayquaza demolishes Ho-Oh and Groudon. Rayquaza can also OHKO potential Scarf Kyogre switch-ins with Draco Meteor. This set can just fire off powerful Draco Meteors right away instead of having to set up like the standard Dragon Dance set. The major drawback of using this set is that Timid Scarf Dialga, Kyogre, and Reshiram can outspeed this set even at +1 and KO you first.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Rayquaza is often seen boosting its Attack and Speed by Dragon Dance, but it is capable of utilizing Swords Dance to double its Attack. After a Swords Dance, Rayquaza reaches a ground-breaking 876 Attack. Although Rayquaza's meager base 95 Speed might seem rather underwhelming, fear not, for Rayquaza receives Extreme Speed, which allows it to bypass its low Speed and hit many foes first. After just one Swords Dance, Rayquaza can OHKO a significant part of the metagame with Extreme Speed, given Stealth Rock support. Darkrai is always OHKOed by a +2 Extreme Speed factoring in Stealth Rock damage, while offensive Mewtwo and Choice Scarf Palkia are also prone to being OHKOed with Stealth Rock. Although Swords Dance Rayquaza gets stiff competition from Swords Dance Arceus, which has more bulk, recovery, and a more powerful STAB priority move, Rayquaza still has a few perks over the Alpha Pokemon. Rayquaza's base Attack is 30 points higher than Arceus's, it is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and it has a fantastic STAB-type in Dragon. Swords Dance Rayquaza can also beat Giratina-O easily, which is something Extreme Killer Arceus can only dream of.</p> <p>Dragon Claw is the primary STAB move. After a Swords Dance, it will always OHKO Giratina, and do insane amounts of damage to anything not resisting it. V-create makes short work of any Forretress or Ferrothorn hoping to wall Rayquaza. V-create also helps Rayquaza hit Arceus-Steel, Dialga, and Metagross, which will otherwise eat Extreme Speed and Dragon Claws all day. Caution must be used with V-create however, as it makes Rayquaza slower, making it easier to be revenge killed. For example, if Giratina-O switches into V-create, it will outspeed due to the Speed drop and OHKO Rayquaza the next turn.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is useful due to prevalence of Zekrom and Reshiram, both of which often run max Speed, and can outpace and OHKO Rayquaza with their powerful Dragon-type attacks if Rayquaza is running an Adamant nature. While using Jolly, running an alternate EV spread of 34 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 216 Spe is an option, as it outpaces positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Dialga, Ho-Oh, Groudon, Kyogre, Zekrom, and Reshiram.</p> <p>While Swords Dance Rayquaza's moveset has all the tools to sweep through teams, there are other attacks it can utilize. Aqua Tail can be used over Dragon Claw if Groudon is a problem. Assuming Rayquaza is using an Adamant nature, a +2 Aqua Tail does a whopping 87.62% - 103.47% to the standard supporter. Earthquake can be used over V-create to help beat Heatran, which would otherwise wall Rayquaza.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is crucial for Swords Dance Rayquaza. Stealth Rock is almost mandatory, as it allows Rayquaza to always OHKO Darkrai with a +2 Extreme Speed. Choice Scarf Palkia and offensive Mewtwo also have a high chance of being OHKOed with Stealth Rock down. Skarmory, Deoxys-S, Forretress, and Groudon can all set up hazards reliably. Forretress and Deoxys-S can also prevent hazards with either Rapid Spin or a fast Taunt, respectively. Wobbuffet can eliminate most of Rayquaza's checks; Tickle Wobbuffet paired with a Pursuit user can even take down Lugia. Because Rayquaza really hates faster Steel-types such as Arceus-Steel, as they resist both its primary moves and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp, Groudon is a great partner for Rayquaza as it can set up Stealth Rock reliably as well and also beat the numerous Steel-types such as Arceus-Steel, Ferrothorn (needs Fire Punch or Fire Blast), and Jirachi. Body Slam Jirachi can switch in on most of Rayquaza's checks and can then use Body Slam to paralyze them, making them incapable of checking Rayquaza. Jirachi can also sponge Dragon- and Ice-type attacks, while Rayquaza can deal with super effective Fire- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Jirachi.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>While Rayquaza is usually seen fixing its Speed troubles with Dragon Dance, there are times when Rayquaza would just like to have that speed right off the bat. Choice Scarf not only fixes this problem, but it turns Rayquaza into something that it fears the most: a revenge killer. This variant of Rayquaza prefers to be used on offensive teams as it keeps up offensive pressure. However, the difference between Choice Scarf Rayquaza and other common Choice Scarf users, such as Palkia and Terrakion, is that Rayquaza uses its ability, Air Lock, to revenge kill Pokemon that use weather to sweep, such as Kingdra and Excadrill. Rayquaza can also clean late game if Pokemon are weakened with a very powerful STAB Outrage. Again, Garchomp is a competitor for this role; however, Garchomp lacks V-create as well as the ability to outspeed Kingdra, Venusaur, and Excadrill. Salamence is also a competitor for the Choice Scarf role, due to Moxie granting it an Attack boost after every KO, but, like Garchomp, it lacks V-create and the ability to outspeed weather sweepers.</p> <p>Outrage is your mandatory Dragon-type STAB attack, and it's no wonder. Packing base 180 power after STAB is calculated, if a Pokemon doesn't resist it, it won't enjoy taking an Outrage. However, just like the Choice Band set, V-create is just as powerful as Outrage, and because it doesn't lock Rayquaza into an attack, it is often best to start the battle by firing off V-create. Draco Meteor is strong, doesn't lock Rayquaza into Outrage, has base 210 power after STAB, and keeps the potential to OHKO Pokemon such as Darkrai and Shaymin-S. Earthquake is there alongside V-create and Outrage to retain perfect coverage of the entire Uber metagame. However, if you find faster Choice Scarf users such as Palkia or priority users such as Arceus and other Rayquaza a problem, Extreme Speed is a viable option in the last slot. Thanks to Extreme Speed, Rayquaza can get the jump on weakened Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Palkia, Arceus, Rayquaza, and other Pokemon that use either priority or speed to take care of Rayquaza.</p> <p>The EV spread is as straightforward as this set, maximizing Attack and Speed so that Rayquaza hits as hard and as fast as possible, with the remaining 4 EVs invested into Special Attack and a Hasty or Naive to make sure Draco Meteor isn't holding Rayquaza back. Of course, an Attack-boosting nature can be used because Rayquaza is using a Choice Scarf, but then Rayquaza won't be able to outspeed Pokemon such as Deoxys-A and a Dragon Dance-boosted Jolly Rayquaza.</p> <p>Rayquaza enjoys Rapid Spin or Magic Bounce support to remove Stealth Rock so it can switch in and out without taking too much residual damage. Skarmory, Deoxys-S, Forretress, and Groudon can all set up hazards reliably; Forretress and Deoxys-S can also prevent hazards with either Rapid Spin or a fast Taunt, respectively.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Rayquaza is an extremely powerful threat, reaching an enormous Attack stat of 657; with a Choice Band, Rayquaza is capable of 2HKOing the majority of the metagame. Although it might seem inferior to Choice Band Garchomp and Zekrom at first glance, with Garchomp having STAB on Earthquake, higher base Speed, and immunity to Thunder Wave and other Electric-type attacks, and Zekrom sporting an Electric STAB as well as Volt Switch to keep up the momentum, this is not the case. Rayquaza does have several key advantages over Garchomp, namely higher Attack, a priority move in Extreme Speed, and an immunity to Ground-type attacks; it also has a better movepool than Zekrom, as Zekrom lacks Extreme Speed and Earthquake. Rayquaza also has V-create to OHKO Ferrothorn, a Pokemon that gives Zekrom trouble.</p> <p>Choice Band Rayquaza lures in Pokemon such as Lugia and Groudon that are reliably 2HKOed by Outrage without hazards. However, thanks to the release of V-create, a move just as powerful as Rayquaza's Outrage, it is recommended to open the battle with it, as it has the same power of Outrage without being locked into it. To take into account just how powerful V-create is, it can 2HKO 4/0 Kyogre, one of Ubers bulkiest Pokemon. As such, make sure to scout out your opponent's team before locking Rayquaza into Outrage; otherwise, it's easy pickings for revenge killers. It is also hard for stall teams to beat Rayquaza, as immunity to Ground-type attacks, Toxic Spikes, and Spikes make it able to switch in and out a pretty easily.</p> <p>An Outrage from this set is so powerful it can 2HKO even defensive Groudon as well as Lugia after Stealth Rock damage. Earthquake and V-create are your best options to hit Steels, the former pairing nicely with Outrage to give Rayquaza the ability to hit everything neutrally barring Skarmory and Shedinja. The latter hits every Steel-type barring Heatran neutrally or super effectively, and is again just as powerful as Outrage. Extreme Speed gives Rayquaza strong priority for picking off faster Pokemon such as Darkrai and Mewtwo. Unlike Garchomp and Zekrom, Rayquaza's priority allows it to become a capable revenge killer as well as a powerful sweeper.</p> <p>Adamant gives Rayquaza the ability to 2HKO Lugia, Groudon, and other physical walls. However, this means Rayquaza doesn't outspeed positive-natured base 90s. Jolly loses the 2HKO on some Pokemon, but it does allow you to outpace base 90 Pokemon, and a generous application of entry hazards can help bridge the power gap.</p> <p>Choice Band Rayquaza enjoys Rapid Spin or Magic Bounce support to remove Stealth Rock so that way it can switch in and out without taking that residual damage. Skarmory, Deoxys-S, Forretress, and Groudon can all set up hazards reliably. Forretress and Deoxys-S can also prevent hazards with either Rapid Spin or a fast Taunt, respectively. Choice Band Rayquaza also enjoys Scizor and Jirachi support. Both are Steels that can absorb Dragon-type and Ice-type attacks as well as scout with U-turn, which is useful when trying to build up momentum against the opponent. Jirachi can even pass Wishes, which can be key as Rayquaza lacks recovery. Paralysis support is extremely recommended if using this set as a late-game sweeper, as it makes Rayquaza much more difficult to revenge kill and allows it to power through Lugia much more easily. Groudon, Dialga, Kyogre, and Jirachi are all sturdy Pokemon which can provide paralysis support for Rayquaza. Groudon in particular is a good choice as it can lay down Stealth Rock and lure in Lugia, making it that much easier to cripple it. Choice Specs Kyogre is also another great partner for Rayquaza. Kyogre's Choice Specs Thunder, Ice Beam, or Water Spout plus Rayquaza's Choice Banded Extreme Speed KOes standard Scarf Palkia. Rayquaza can in turn remove Ferrothorn, Ludicolo, and Gastrodon lacking Ice Beam. Choice Specs Water Spout, Surf, or Hydro Pump deals heavy damage to just about any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, and any Pokemon that does can be picked off by Rayquaza's Extreme Speed. Lastly, Wobbuffet gets rid of Choice Scarfed Dragon-types so Rayquaza can freely spam Outrage.</p> <p>Just like every other Rayquaza set, there are other options Rayquaza can use to achieve its goals. Fire Blast and Overheat are options, but they lack the power to OHKO specially defensive Skarmory. Forretress and Ferrothorn are different stories, though. Dragon Tail works on predicted switches, as well as working well alongside Spikes. However, there really isn't an attack that can be removed to make way for Dragon Tail other than Earthquake, which would otherwise leave it walled by Heatran.</p> <p>Choice Band Rayquaza works well on teams that have issues with rain stall or classic stall as it not only crushes all spinblockers, but it also breaks Ferrothorn, Giratina, and Lugia, all very common rain stall and classic stall Pokemon. Outrage also OHKOes uninvested Kyogre, which might switch in expecting a Dragon Dance or Swords Dance.</p>"

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Although the legendary Pokemon with a 100 base stat spread are typically underwhelming in Ubers with only a few boasting a niche set, Jirachi sets itself apart as the only one with significant potential. In a tier filled with Dragon-types, it is easy to see that this comes from Jirachi's fortunate Steel typing. Even among fellow Steel-types, Jirachi stands out due to its respectable bulk and secondary Psychic typing that allows it to also wall a variety of common coverage moves, such as Aura Sphere and rain-weakened Fire Blast. Jirachi's concept grants it access to the excellent support moves Wish and Healing Wish, further reinforcing its separation from the competition. Sadly, wishes always come with limits, and Jirachi's pitiful offensive presence is its twist. Even with the obnoxious Iron Head flinch rate due to Serene Grace, Jirachi must rely on status moves to deal any real damage, leaving it horribly vulnerable to opposing Steel types, especially those carrying Spikes. Unlike other equally crippled walls, Jirachi has all the coverage moves it could wish for, making even a Choice Scarf set a possibility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jirachi has a very diverse movepool but is sadly crippled by its subpar offensive stats along with its need to devote two slots for reliable recovery. Fire Punch can be used on the specially defensive set for Spikes users, but bear in mind that the rain Kyogre would provide weakens Fire Punch, rendering it useless. Magic Coat is another option that can be used to reduce Jirachi's weakness to Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn while also allowing it to function as an anti-lead against Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S. It doesn't do anything else, however, and Jirachi already suffers from four-moveslot syndrome. A Calm Mind set looks appealing due to Jirachi's immunity to Toxic, excellent typing, and quadruple resistance to Psyshock. However, its low Special Attack, tight moveset, and weakness to common Spikes users make this inadvisable. Zen Headbutt can be used on the Choice Scarf set to hit Arceus-Fighting while retaining a respectable 40% flinch rate, but it has poor coverage outside of that. Lastly, a special Choice Scarf set could be used, but it is largely outclassed by the physical one, as it can no longer check the threats it is supposed to despite the overall stronger attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Jirachi isn't very difficult at all to counter due to its horribly weak offenses. Both sets struggle against Steel-types, most notably those that lay entry hazards, such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn. Excadrill can also use Jirachi as a free chance to use Rapid Spin or simply threaten it with its strong STAB Earthquake, although it needs to be careful if Jirachi is using Body Slam. The specially defensive set relies on status, so anything that can deal with it is a great way to handle Jirachi. RestTalk users, such as Giratina and Kyogre, have nothing to fear from Jirachi besides excessive Iron Head flinching. Bulkier Substitute users, such as Zekrom, can setup on Jirachi. Strong Fire- and Ground-type attacks can also be used to threaten Jirachi; Gliscor receives a special mention because it has little difficulty switching in. Because the Choice Scarf set relies on flinching and coverage moves, predicting the right attacks or simply using a bulky Pokemon, such as Choice Specs Kyogre, can deal with it. Speaking of Kyogre, strong rain-boosted attacks from it and Palkia can break the specially defensive set. Keep in mind that Jirachi is still quite bulky, and if Palkia is afflicted with a status, even the Lustrous Orb set will lose to it one-on-one. Strong physical attacks, such as Zekrom's Bolt Strike, can hit Jirachi on its softer, uninvested side and force it to switch out. Paralysis and burn will also cripple Jirachi and prevent it from walling as efficiently or revenge killing. Simply changing the weather and removing the rain exposes Jirachi to Fire-type attacks, such as Latios's Hidden Power Fire, and greatly reduces the number of threats that it can wall.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>With its excellent typing and support options, it is no wonder that Jirachi's best set is a defensive one. With the majority of the attacks in Ubers being specially-based, Jirachi can shine with a specially defensive set. Jirachi's typing is its main selling point, allowing it to check an impressive amount of special attackers under rain, such as Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, most Calm Mind Arceus, Shaymin-S, Tornadus-I, Tornadus-T, Kyurem-W, and many more. This makes Jirachi a very attractive option for stall and balanced rain teams while reducing the need for a Choice Scarf revenge killer with its addition. It further supports its team by providing Wish support and creating more switch-in opportunities with U-turn.</p> <p>Deciding on the four moves to be used can sometimes be a struggle. Wish is an absolute must, as it provides Jirachi with a fairly reliably means of recovery and allows it to capitalize on its ability to support its team. The second choice is the hardest to make. Stealth Rock is generally the preferred option; its overall utility is important to every team. However, if another teammate has Stealth Rock, U-turn can be used to allow Jirachi to pivot on the multiple threats it checks as well as safely pass a Wish. If you want reliability out of your Jirachi, Protect can be used to stall the one turn delay of Wish for more dependable recovery. Iron Head might not do much damage, but it gives Jirachi a STAB attack and a means to stall out status thanks to its high flinch rate. Toxic rounds out the set by providing a crippling status that will generally be the source of most of Jirachi's damage output. Thunder can be used in the place of Toxic as an alternative status for teams that prefer to fight slower opponents rather than attempting to stall them out. Lastly, U-turn can be used with Protect over Iron Head and Stealth Rock if you are more interested in having a sturdy Wish passer than the ability to beat Substitute sets, such as SubSeed Shaymin-S.</p> <p>Jirachi's EV spread and nature are simple; the goal is to maximize its specially defensive walling potential. A physically defensive variant might seem appealing at first, but the more dangerous coverage options, such as V-create and Bolt Strike, the physical attackers in Ubers possess can obliterate it. Jirachi also has a few other move options that can be used. Ice Punch is noteworthy because it hits Dragon-types, Gliscor, and Shaymin for respectable damage. Thunder Wave and Body Slam can be used as alternative methods of paralysis spreading if 100% paralysis or hitting Ground-types, such as Excadrill, is more important than dealing damage or crippling Ghost-types, such as Arceus-Ghost.</p> <p>As far as teammates are concerned, Jirachi requires a fair amount of them to succeed. Above all others, Kyogre stands out, as the rain it provides is essential for allowing Jirachi to wall many special attackers, as Fire Blast and Hidden Power Fire would be overwhelming otherwise. Because Jirachi is incapable of touching Steel-types, partners that can spread burn status to them are recommended so that Jirachi can break them with Iron Head. A Rapid Spin user is also strongly suggested because Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory will not have any difficulty in laying Spikes against Jirachi. Even with its incredible typing and rain support, Jirachi remains vulnerable to Ground-types, so including partners such as Giratina-O and Skarmory is recommended for dealing with Ground-type threats, specifically Groudon and Garchomp. Jirachi is also vulnerable to physical attackers, so physically bulky Pokemon are useful to complete a defensive core.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Although Jirachi's poor offensive stats might suggest otherwise, it can also run a supportive Choice Scarf set. Its access to an assortment of coverage and utility moves and Iron Head's high flinch rate helps to offset the underwhelming damage output. Although this might make it appear as if Jirachi is outclassed by Genesect, its increased bulk, Speed, and support options are significant enough to separate the two. Once again, Jirachi's bulk and typing are important, as they allow Jirachi to directly switch into the threats it is intended to check, such as Mewtwo. Furthermore, Jirachi can support its team by sacrificing itself for teammate with Healing Wish or crippling a bothersome threat with Trick. Its base 100 Speed allows Jirachi to outrun the popular Genesect as well as Speed tie with Choice Scarf Palkia.</p> <p>Jirachi has many move selections that it can run. Iron Head is a mandatory choice, as it offers a reliable STAB and high flinch rate for a somewhat threatening damage output. A support move is also mandatory to capitalize on Jirachi's niche. Healing Wish is the preferred option, as healing a teammate can help your team in certain situations. It also allows your teammates to pull off surprising sweeps while giving you the choice on how to deal with specific threats. Trick is also a viable alternative to cripple threats such as Extreme Killer Arceus. However, caution is advised when using Trick, as a misprediction can foil your attempts, and a large portion of Ubers are indifferent to holding a Choice Scarf or other Choice item. U-turn helps Jirachi capitalize on forced switches and has super effective coverage on some dangerous Pokemon, such as Mewtwo and Darkrai, putting them in a difficult situation. For the final moveslot, you have a choice between Ice Punch and Fire Punch. Ice Punch is generally preferred due to the large quantity of Dragon-types in the metagame. However, Fire Punch is also very appealing for hitting Steel-types that give Jirachi trouble for some decent damage. It is especially useful to allow Jirachi to outspeed and OHKO Choice Scarf Genesect.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is the best choice of nature, as outspeeding +1 Rayquaza or Choice Scarf Genesect (depending on your coverage move) is important. Jirachi could also use Body Slam as a means to paralyze while dealing damage. It can even go so far as to run a status move to cripple threats that are too bulky for it to hurt. However, this comes at the price of key coverage moves, so it is generally not recommended.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Jirachi is quite similar to the specially defensive variant in terms of teammates. Kyogre is appealing for weakening Fire Blasts from the likes of Mewtwo so that switching in requires less prediction. However, it is not a requirement, and can even be a hindrance if Jirachi uses Fire Punch. Giratina-O is a more notable partner for its complementary typing and access to a strong Shadow Sneak to restrain opposing Deoxys-S to a single layer of entry hazards. Speaking of entry hazard leads, using a Deoxys can be useful for early entry hazards that help Jirachi rack up damage by forcing multiple switches with Iron Head and U-turn. If it lacks Fire Punch, Jirachi remains vulnerable to common Spikes setters, so having a Rapid Spin user can help prevent them from overwhelming Jirachi and your team.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Deoxys has great offensive stats, but suffers from being the middle child of Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S, often struggling to not be outclassed by either one of the two. However, with its slight advantage in bulk over the frail Deoxys-A, this fallen comet manages to carve itself a niche (albeit a tiny and mostly useless one) as an offensive dual screens user.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Deoxys has a great movepool, but all of its choices will leave it outclassed by its alternate formes. It has access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock, Magic Coat, Extreme Speed, and Taunt, all of which are useful, but unfortunately have as little a reason to be used as Deoxys itself.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Giratina-O's Shadow Sneak will 2HKO Deoxys, even if the second one is cushioned by Reflect, allowing it to only get one screen up or attack. Extreme Killer Arceus is 2HKOed by Deoxys, but Extreme Speed will 2HKO Deoxys back. Arceus-Ghost can take anything Deoxys throws at it and set up Calm Minds, using Recover when necessary. Jirachi walls sets without Fire Punch and can paralyze Deoxys, then take it out with Iron Head. Ho-Oh and specially defensive Giratina also wall this set, but cannot stop Deoxys from setting up both screens. Metagross and Scizor are only hit super effectively by Fire Punch, and have powerful STAB moves and priority to take out Deoxys. Any Choice Scarf user with more than 279 Speed can swiftly knock Deoxys out with a STAB or super effective move before it has a chance to set up screens.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Sporting double the base defensive stats of Carvanha, Deoxys can semi-reliably set up dual screens for its team. Unlike Deoxys-A, Deoxys can actually survive certain attacks, making it a decent offensive dual screens user.</p> <p>Light Screen and Reflect are fairly self-explanatory, providing a setup window for your sweepers. Psycho Boost is Deoxys's strongest STAB option, doing moderate damage to anything without huge Special Defense or a resistance to the attack. Ice Beam can be used to hit Grass-, Ground-, and Dragon-types super effectively without lowering Deoxys's Special Attack, but a neutral STAB Psycho Boost actually does more damage on the first use. Low Kick is the primary option for the last slot, threatening Tyranitar, Arceus-Steel and Arceus, Dialga, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Chansey and Blissey. Fire Punch can be used in the same slot to OHKO Ferrothorn and bring Forretress down to 1 HP.</p> <p>The HP and Defense EVs ensure that Life Orb Extreme Killer Arceus can't OHKO Deoxys with Extreme Speed, while the Attack EVs allow it to retaliate with an almost assured 2HKO from Low Kick. The Speed EVs allow Deoxys to outpace all neutral natured Choice Scarf users with a base Speed of 90 or below. The remaining 8 EVs are dumped into Special Attack to provide a bit of a kick to Psycho Boost and Ice Beam.</p> <p>Grass Knot is an option over Psycho Boost or Ice Beam to smack Kyogre and Groudon really hard. Thunder still hits Kyogre for super effective damage, and has an added bonus of Lugia and Ho-Oh being susceptible to it as well. However, its unreliability outside of rain and this set's dedication to the lead slot make this an inferior option most of the time. Shadow Ball prevents Mewtwo from setting up, but is fairly useless outside of that.</p> <p>Deoxys appreciates teammates that can take advantage of the screens it provides to set up and threaten the opposing team. Rock Polish + Swords Dance Groudon, Dragon Dance Rayquaza, and Extreme Killer Arceus are all examples of such Pokemon.</p>"

  "Deoxys-Attack": {
    "overview": "<p>The epitome of offense, Deoxys-A is a true powerhouse in every sense of the word. Between its unrivaled base 180 attacking stats (the highest in the game), blistering base 150 Speed, and fantastic movepool, including the coveted Extreme Speed, Deoxys-A has everything it needs to tear gaping holes in the opposing team. Stealth Rock and Spikes let it serve as a suicide or attacking lead with unparalleled offenses, being able to ward off every user of Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce in the game! Unfortunately, its poor typing and practically nonexistent defenses offer no defensive synergy to its team, and because even relatively weak neutral attacks will easily knock it out, it usually needs extensive team support to pull off a clean sweep. The fact that it is easily revenge killed by users of Choice Scarf and priority moves--even Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave--also make it difficult for Deoxys-A to find a place on a team. Couple this with the fact Deoxys-A is walled by certain Pokemon depending on what move it forgoes and you can see why it's rarely seen in the Ubers tier. These faults aside, however, Deoxys-A is certainly a threat to prepare for.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A few Choice items might come to mind when looking at Deoxys-A's stats. After all, base 180 in each offensive stat is nothing to scoff at. However, there are some huge issues with Choice Deoxys-A. The inability to change moves means Deoxys-A will have to switch often, particularly as Psycho Boost and Superpower both lower Deoxys-A's stats and cannot hit Dark- and Ghost-types respectively. Also, thanks to its abysmal defenses, Deoxys-A can pretty much only switch in after a teammate has fainted. Furthermore, Life Orb-boosted attacks already hit so hard that Pokemon which are not 2HKOed are few and far between. Choice Specs is incredibly strong though, capable of OHKOing even 252 HP Arceus. A Choice Scarf is also unnecessary, as base 150 Speed is already amazing, and to outspeed revenge killers by such large a margin is rather pointless when Deoxys-A could just switch out.</p> <p>As for move choices, thanks to its stellar offensive stats, Deoxys-A can make use of just about any decently powerful move in its arsenal; your other teammates should determine which moves it runs. However, there are a few moves that stand out. Psyshock is the first, as it can 2HKO Chansey without the need for Superpower's stat drops. Low Kick is another option which hits many heavy Uber Pokemon for a good amount of damage, while once more avoiding Superpower's negative effects. The combination of the two work well together, \"persuading\" Chansey not to switch in. Deoxys-A's ability to force many switches can be used to set up free Substitutes, which not only lengthen Deoxys-A's longevity but also ease prediction, as Deoxys-A no longer has to worry about using the wrong move and allowing a check to switch in. Pursuit also takes advantage of Deoxys-A's ability to force switches, killing or greatly weakening any Pokemon that dares switch out against Deoxys-A. Shadow Ball is an alternative to Dark Pulse if you fear that you might accidentally hit a Terrakion with the move and allow it to nab a boost in Attack, but its inability to hit Normal-types might allow Extreme Killer Arceus to switch in freely and proceed to kill Deoxys-A with Extreme Speed. Icy Wind and Low Sweep allow Deoxys-A to alleviate its issues with fast Choice Scarf Pokemon, but it should be noted that these moves are extremely weak. Signal Beam allows Deoxys-A to hit Darkrai and Mewtwo super effectively with one move, but it is quite weak and Bug-type moves provide terrible coverage on the rest of the tier. Taunt allows Deoxys-A to prevent a Pokemon from healing itself, but it should be noted that the turn Deoxys-A uses this move could have been dedicated to hitting the opponent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There are no true counters to Deoxys-A as its expansive movepool means it might be carrying a move that hits said switch-in super effectively. There is, however, one thing that can be considered close to a counter, and that is specially defensive Arceus-Psychic. Specially defensive Arceus-Psychic can easily switch into any move Deoxys-A has and proceed to outspeed and kill it the turn after with Extreme Speed. Deoxys-A also has many checks, some of which are listed above. To reiterate, anything faster than it or packing priority can reliably eliminate Deoxys-A. Most Choice Scarf users, such as Genesect, Palkia, Dialga, Jirachi, and Terrakion, are bulky enough to take an Extreme Speed and KO back with just about any move; however, it must be noted that neutral-natured +1 base 90 Speed Pokemon will not outspeed max Speed Deoxys-A. Deoxys-A is also greatly annoyed by Chlorophyll, Sand Rush, and Swift Swim users in their respective weathers, as they can outspeed and KO Deoxys-A with a STAB move. Giratina, Arceus, Beartic, and Scizor can annoy Deoxys-A with Shadow Sneak, Extreme Speed, Bullet Punch, and Aqua Jet, forcing Deoxys-A to switch out unless it wishes to be KOed. There are some walls that, should Deoxys-A lack a certain move for them, can create problems for it. Latios and Latias can both comfortably take any hit barring Life Orb-boosted Ice Punch and KO back with Dragon Pulse. Specially defensive Latias makes an even better check, as it is capable of stomaching two Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulses and can proceed to Recover the damage off, set up Light Screen to take hits with more ease, or just KO Deoxys-A with Dragon Pulse. Specially defensive Giratina also avoids being 2HKOed by any move bar Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam and can proceed to KO Deoxys-A back with Dragon Tail. If Deoxys-A lacks Thunder and Stealth Rock is not up, defensive Ho-Oh can cause problems, as it can tank hits comfortably with its massive Special Defense. Lugia is another specially defensive wall that can survive most of Deoxys-A's moves and easily KO back. Bulky Steel-types such as Scizor, Metagross, Forretress, Jirachi, and Bronzong will cause problems for Deoxys-A lacking a Fire-type move and can OHKO back with a STAB move. Scizor and Metagross in particular boast STAB Bullet Punch to knock Deoxys-A out before it moves. Wobbuffet, Cresselia, and Deoxys-D can easily switch into Deoxys-A lacking Dark Pulse. They can then OHKO Deoxys-A with Mirror Coat and Ice Beam, respectively, or proceed to cripple it with status. While rare, Extreme Speed Deoxys-S KOes its attacking brethren unless a Substitute is in the way.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Focus Sash Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Presenting Deoxys-A's bread and butter set, one of the tier's premier offensive anti-leads. This set can take on most leads in the current metagame and come out on top. If you thought Draco Meteor spam was impressive, think again: Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost is even more powerful, and does an immense amount of damage to anything that isn't outright immune to Psychic. For reference, Psycho Boost does 90.6% - 106.8% to Rayquaza! Ice Beam and Dark Pulse both improve Deoxys-A's coverage by allowing it to hit Latios and Latias. The former also provides Deoxys-A with a move to hit Rayquaza and Groudon outside of Psycho Boost while the latter allows Deoxys-A to hit its Psychic brethren, namely Deoxys-S, Deoxys, and Cresselia, super effectively, all the while providing a handy 20% flinch chance. Superpower is a move similar to Psycho Boost, albeit physically based, and hits Steel- and Dark-types that resist or are immune to Psycho Boost for super effective damage. This notably allows Deoxys-A to revenge kill non-Focus Sash Darkrai. Hidden Power Fire allows Deoxys-A to quickly OHKO Forretress and Ferrothorn. It should be noted that if Deoxys-A lacks Hidden Power Fire, then it will have great difficulty hurting Forretress, as it resists all other moves Deoxys-A can throw at it barring Superpower—which it easily absorbs thanks to its high Defense. However, without Superpower, Deoxys-A will find itself walled by Chansey. Extreme Speed is great for taking out weakened opponents such as Focus Sash Deoxys-S, and lands a decent hit on Choice Scarf users attempting to revenge kill Deoxys-A. It also provides mid-game revenge killing utility should Deoxys-A survive that long, which happens surprisingly often. However, it can be replaced with a coverage move if your team doesn't have much trouble with revenge killers and doesn't mind Deoxys-S nabbing an extra layer of Spikes on you.</p> <p>Max Speed and Special Attack with a Naive nature are used to make the most of Deoxys-A's amazing offensive stats, as its Defense is so poor that it will not survive any hits; in any case, it utilizes a Focus Sash. The remaining 4 EVs should go into Attack to boost Superpower and Extreme Speed. In particular, this Speed investment allows Deoxys-A to outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Kyogre and other neutral-natured base 90 Speed Choice Scarf users. A Rash nature, however, is also usable. An alternative spread of 16 Atk / 252 SpA / 240 Spe with a Rash nature allows Deoxys-A to still outpace Mewtwo and other base 130 Speed Pokemon, taking into account Hidden Power Fire's imperfect Speed IV. Using max Speed in tandem with Hidden Power Fire with a Rash nature is not advised, as the point lost in Speed will prevent a Speed tie with opposing Deoxys-A, the only common Pokemon with base 150 Speed, so dropping to 395 Speed (just above the base 130 Speed tier) and shifting the remaining EVs to Attack is the preferred choice. Deoxys-A also has the option of running Magic Coat, Fire Punch, Thunder, Grass Knot, or Ice Punch. Magic Coat allows Deoxys-A to reflect Spikes and Dark Void back at Deoxys-S and Darkrai respectively, if you can predict correctly. Fire Punch provides solid coverage while preserving perfect IVs, but it will be slightly weaker than Hidden Power Fire due to unequal offensive investment. Thunder is reliant on rain, but it allows Deoxys-A to hit enemy Deoxys, Forretress, Kyogre, Lugia, and Ho-Oh hard. Grass Knot allows Deoxys-A to always OHKO defensive Groudon without the Psycho Boost stat drops, but its inability to hit Steel-types burdens Deoxys-A. Lastly, Ice Punch can be used over Ice Beam solely for enemy Latios and Latias.</p> <p>As a dedicated lead, Deoxys-A does not require much support from the team. Should you forgo Magic Coat, a sleep absorber will be necessary, as Choice Scarf Darkrai will outspeed and incapacitate Deoxys-A with Dark Void before it can use Superpower. RestTalk + Calm Mind Kyogre is a great teammate in this regard as it does not mind being put to sleep and can retaliate with Sleep Talk, either drowning Darkrai with Scald or setting up for an early sweep with Calm Mind. Beware of switching Kyogre into a Trick, however, as a Choice item will cripple it. If Deoxys-A lacks Hidden Power Fire, lead Scizor can also cause problems; fortunately, a defensive Kyogre is generally an apt switch-in to most Scizor as well. Though not commonly seen as leads, Giratina-O and Extreme Killer Arceus can take Deoxys-A out with consecutive Shadow Sneaks and Extreme Speeds respectively, but Psycho Boost will deal severe damage to them. Dialga can easily switch into a resisted Shadow Sneak and scare Giratina-O out or OHKO with STAB Dragon-type moves. While entry hazards might seem odd on an attacking lead, the immense offensive threat Deoxys-A presents can often force switches, which gives it an opportunity to get Stealth Rock or a layer of Spikes onto the field.</p>"
      },
      "Sash Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Deoxys-A's ability to force many switches and access to entry hazards, coupled with the ability to destroy all users of Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce, allows it to become a fantastic user of Stealth Rock and Spikes. The decision between Stealth Rock and Spikes is based on your team's needs. Stealth Rock takes only one turn to setup, and affects all types of Pokemon. Spikes, on the other hand, deals consistent damage to all non-Flying-type Pokemon. Psycho Boost hits extremely hard, and allows Deoxys-A to deal heavy damage to enemy leads. The third slot is reserved for Deoxys-A's coverage needs. Both moves allow Deoxys-A to hit Steel-types, but both have their notable attributes. Superpower allows Deoxys-A to dent Dialga and OHKO enemy Tyranitar, while Hidden Power Fire can bring Forretress down to Sturdy and OHKO enemy Ferrothorn. It should be noted that both Superpower and Hidden Power Fire can take up the last two slots if you wish to have insurance against Tyranitar, Dialga, Forretress, and Ferrothorn. The last slot is also based on the team's needs. Ice Beam allows Deoxys-A to OHKO Rayquaza and crush Groudon without resorting to Psycho Boost. Extreme Speed 2HKOes Deoxys-S, and limits the amount of hazards it can setup. Lastly, Dark Pulse provides solid coverage against enemy Psychic-types, notably Deoxys-D, who would otherwise have no problem setting up hazards against Deoxys-A.</p> <p>As a suicide lead, Deoxys-A doesn't really need teammates to help it do its job, but there are many teammates that appreciate hazards on the field. Sweepers such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Extreme Killer Arceus enjoy having hazards on the opponent's side of the field, as it greatly helps them sweep the opposition. This coupled with Deoxys-A's ability to prevent hazards from going up on its side of the field (thanks to the fact its foes will try to knock it out to avoid getting mauled), allows Deoxys-A to even better help a Pokemon sweep. There are, however, a few teammates Deoxys-A needs. A spinblocker such as Giratina or Arceus-Ghost is needed so that the hazards Deoxys-A sets up will not be spun away. Additionally, Pokemon that can switch into priority moves, such as Shadow Sneak or Extreme Speed, are welcome. Dialga, in particular, makes a great partner. It can easily switch into a Shadow Sneak from Giratina and threaten to OHKO back with Draco Meteor. Dialga can also threaten any users of Rapid Spin with Fire Blast and Draco Meteor and provide Stealth Rock support, which allows Deoxys-A to run Spikes.</p> <p>Deoxys-A can run moves not listed on the set, but note that Deoxys-A will lose coverage. There is only one viable move not listed, and that is Thunder, which can be used in the fourth slot as a hybrid between Dark Pulse and Hidden Power Fire. Thunder is Deoxys-A's strongest move against Skarmory, and allows Deoxys-A to hit enemy Psychic- and Steel-types neutrally, hitting Forretress a lot harder than Superpower. Thunder, however, is reliant on rain, and as this Deoxys-A is designed to lead, it might be impossible to make Thunder accurate.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>For a Pokemon that can't take a hit but has unparalleled power, what better item is there than Life Orb? Such an attacking set is one of Deoxys-A's best options, and its execution is simple: simply select the correct coverage move and decimate the opponent. Psycho Boost is the preferred move, as it provides STAB and acts much like Latios's Draco Meteor in OU: spam it and things die. Ice Beam is useful for its great coverage over the tier, OHKOing Pokemon such as Groudon, Rayquaza, Shaymin-S, Garchomp, and Zekrom without resorting to Psycho Boost, while also giving Deoxys-A the best chance to 2HKO specially defensive Giratina and hitting Latios and Latias hard. Dark Pulse, on the other hand, allows Deoxys-A to defeat all of its Psychic brethren, 2HKOing Deoxys-D and Cresselia, Pokemon that Deoxys-A otherwise struggles to defeat, while also hitting Latios hard and even OHKOing offensive Mewtwo. It is also Deoxys-A's only move aside from Shadow Ball that can OHKO offensive Mewtwo. Superpower allows Deoxys-A to OHKO Chansey, Darkrai, and Blissey while providing Deoxys-A with the ability to hit Steel-types super effectively. The final slot is a toss-up; Hidden Power Fire provides coverage against Ferrothorn in situations where the Attack drop from Superpower is not welcome and OHKOes Forretress outside of Sturdy, but it only nabs the OHKO on both in neutral or sunny weather. If Ferrothorn and Forretress are not issues, Extreme Speed is a great option to take down weakened revenge killers.</p> <p>Because Deoxys-A is so versatile, its moveset can be molded to suit your team. Thunder, Grass Knot, Spikes, and Ice Punch are all good alternative moves that Deoxys-A can use. Thunder, although reliant on weather, allows Deoxys-A to hit enemy Steel- and Psychic-types hard. It is also Deoxys-A's best move against Skarmory and Lugia in the rain, as it can OHKO both after Stealth Rock. Grass Knot hits Kyogre and Groudon hard without the need for Psycho Boost stat drops, but its lack of coverage outside of hitting the two often makes it a poor choice. Ice Punch might seem outclassed by Ice Beam at first glance, but it gives Deoxys-A the best chance at OHKOing Latios and Latios, who avoid the OHKO from Ice Beam thanks to Soul Dew; it should be mentioned that it also hits Giratina and Lugia a lot less harder though. Spikes might seem awkward on a set designed to destroy its enemies, but Deoxys-A's massive potential for destruction gives it time to set up multiple layers of Spikes. Do be careful if you use Spikes though, as predicting incorrectly will result in a dead Deoxys-A.</p> <p>Deoxys-A has some alternative natures and spreads it can use aside from those listed. Maximum Speed along with a Naive nature enables Deoxys-A to outspeed everything up to +1 neutral-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf and Dragon Dance Rayquaza. A Rash or Mild nature is completely viable. An alternate spread of 24 Atk / 252 SpA / 232 Spe and a Mild nature provides more power at the cost of speed, allowing Deoxys-A to OHKO and 2HKO threats that it had trouble with earlier, such as specially defensive Giratina, as well as Multiscale-less Lugia, and Latias without the need for Stealth Rock. Deoxys-A can also invest in its Attack stat, as its special attacks already have a lot of power. A set of 184 Atk / 88 SpA / 236 Spe is viable, as it provides a massive boost to Superpower and Extreme Speed, giving the former a chance to OHKO support Dialga, Ferrothorn, and Chansey. It is recommended to use a Rash nature with this though, as a Rash Psycho Boost boosted by 88 Special Attack EVs is stronger than a Naive Psycho Boost boosted by 252 Special Attack EVs.</p> <p>There are a few partners that Deoxys-A always enjoys having on its side. As it is susceptible to revenge killing, Wobbuffet is a good partner to get rid of Choice Scarf users; it can also Encore harmless moves to give Deoxys-A a safe switch-in. Steel-types can cause trouble for Deoxys-A, especially in rain, as several of them are hit neutrally by Superpower, so Magnezone is another good partner, trapping these Pokemon and potentially setting up on them with Substitute and Charge Beam or OHKOing them with Thunder. Deoxys-A's frailty greatly hurts its ability to get in safely, so partners that can get Deoxys-A safely in with U-turn or Volt Switch—namely Genesect, Scizor, Forretress, and Zekrom—are welcome. Deoxys-A has the tendency to cause a lot of switches in a match and wants as much residual damage on the team as possible so that it can have the best chance to sweep. This means Deoxys-A appreciates having a partner that can use entry hazards such as Ferrothorn. Forretress can do this job well too. It can setup multiple hazards and allow Deoxys-A to switch back in easily thanks to its slow Volt Switch and Explosion.</p>"

  "Deoxys-Defense": {
    "overview": "<p>Deoxys-D's select movepool and defensive capabilities enable it to set up entry hazards against a variety of Uber threats. With access to Taunt, not much barring Magic Bounce Pokemon and Whimsicott can stop this defensive behemoth from withering the opposition away with poison, or littering the opponent's field with entry hazards. However, Deoxys-D does have its flaws. Its low base 50 HP stat restricts its bulk, which unfortunately makes it yet another creature that is OHKOed by the sheer power of Choice Specs Kyogre's Water Spout and Choice Specs Reshiram's sun-boosted Blue Flare. This, combined with its average base 90 Speed stat, makes it difficult for Deoxys-D to keep up with the competition, namely Ferrothorn for its role as a bulky Spikes user. Regardless of these shortcomings, Deoxys-D still makes a great support Pokemon that should not be forgotten, lest you wish to be walled by the alien.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Deoxys-D's usable attacking stats and great defensive stats might make it seem like a great user of Calm Mind and Cosmic Power, but sadly, any set utilizing them either falls victim to Taunt or status very easily, and makes poor use of Deoxys-D's wonderful support movepool. Deoxys-D can easily utilize dual screens thanks to its bulk and access to Taunt, which enables it to shut down any curious Wobbuffet and prevents it from being setup bait for the opposition. Lastly, a physically defensive spread consisting of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD can be utilized on any set, but a mixed defensive set is preferable due to the common nature of powerful special attacks flung around in the Uber environment, and Deoxys-D's lackluster typing for a physical wall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Although the alien's defenses transcend those of the legendary Arceus, its HP stat does not get granted a fate as desirable as its defenses. Due to this unfortunate circumstance, Deoxys-D experiences difficulty taking blows from Ubers who have their mythical powers amplified by Choice Specs or Choice Band, as their attacks will surely 2HKO the alien if it dares try to wall them. Kyogre and Reshiram deserve a special mention due to the fact that their mighty powers, boosted by Choice Specs, will OHKO the unsuspecting alien in a heartbeat, leaving the user dazed and mystified.</p> <p>Sadly, these are not the only problems that the alien faces. Deoxys-D cannot bear to be Taunted, Encored, or locked into a support move via Trick. Combine this with its average base 90 Speed and you have Choice Scarf users with Trick that are able to outspeed Deoxys-D even after an Agility boost, and force an unwanted Scarf upon the alien, making them very effective counters. Whimsicott also deserves a special mention, as its access to priority Taunt and Encore force the alien to either struggle or flee. As Deoxys-D tends to use only support moves, Xatu also deserves a special mention, as the bird can reflect all of its moves back at it and fear nothing in return. Sadly, the bird can do little to the alien if it lacks Toxic.</p> <p>Lastly, should one happen to equip their Pokemon with a Mental Herb and Toxic, they will be able to bypass Deoxys-D's futile attempts to Taunt them and effectively cripple Deoxys-D permanently. In a similar sense, Deoxys-D is doomed if it switches in with Toxic Spikes at its feet, as it will never be able to cure the poison that will plague it for the rest of the match.</p>",

      "Agility + Taunt": {
        "description": "<p>Deoxys-D's wide movepool and solid defensive capabilities enable it to easily poison the opposition and prevent them from using any healing moves with Taunt. With an Agility boost, Deoxys-D can easily outspeed and Taunt any foes attempting to Trick or Taunt it. Taunt is the crux of the set, as it prevents foes from setting up or Taunting Deoxys-D, and removes any hope that the opposition has of alleviating their team's suffering to poison. Nothing that carries Taunt will be able to outspeed Deoxys-D after an Agility, but it can still be foiled by the few devious Pokemon with the Prankster ability who bypass Speed entirely. Lastly, Recover allows Deoxys-D to heal itself of any wounds that the opposition might have desperately caused in an attempt to end the torture that the alien has enacted upon them.</p> <p>The given EV spread is designed so that Deoxys-D can outspeed all Deoxys-S after an Agility. If you wish to further safeguard Deoxys-D from being Tricked a Choice Scarf, then an alternate spread of 252 HP / 24 SpD / 228 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to outspeed all base 130 Pokemon carrying a Choice Scarf after an Agility boost. If one wants to focus more on Deoxys-D's walling capabilities and does not care about the possibility of being Taunted or Tricked after an Agility, then he can opt to use the more defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature to maximize Deoxys-D's walling potential.</p> <p>Though its defenses are mighty, Deoxys-D simply cannot withstand Kyogre's Water Spout or Reshiram's Blue Flare. In order to lengthen its life span, the alien greatly appreciates teammates that can absorb these mighty blows. Chansey deserves a special mention as it can pass Wishes that will heal 100% of Deoxys-D's health. Gastrodon and Palkia are very useful partners as both easily absorb those blows regardless of whether the opponent holds Choice Specs or not.</p> <p>Deoxys-D has a tendency to cause its foes to retreat in fear after they have been poisoned, and this makes entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, very useful for Deoxys-D as it increases the amounts of residual damage that its victims suffer. This makes teammates such as Forretress and Ferrothorn great options to use in conjunction with Deoxys-D, as their typing and defensive capabilities enable the two to set up hazards with ease. The former deserves a special mention as it is also capable of spinning away pesky hazards--Toxic Spikes in particular--as they can prove to be a great nuisance to the alien. As Deoxys-D does not possess a Ghost typing, it unfortunately cannot spinblock, so it will be of use to pair it with a spinblocker. Giratina-O distinguishes itself from other spinblockers as it can easily OHKO Forretress with Hidden Power Fire, while wreaking havoc with Dragon Tail should the bug dare try to escape the renegade's wrath.</p> <p>Finally, Deoxys-D cannot handle Xatu or Whimsicott due to their abilities. The former has the ability to bounce back all of Deoxys-D's non-attacking moves, while the latter can Taunt or Encore Deoxys-D into a support move before it can Taunt Whimsicott, courtesy of its Prankster ability. As a result, Deoxys-D appreciates partners that can swiftly eliminate these foes. In the long list of possible partners, Shaymin-S shines brightly, feared for its talents which allow it to be a fabulous quick stall abuser, capable of not only beating Deoxys-D's enemies, but creating free stall turns for Toxic to slowly intensify with the use of the flinch-mad move, Air Slash.</p>"
      },
      "Utility Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Deoxys-D's arsenal of support moves in conjunction with great defenses and a reliable recovery move lets it distinguish itself from Ferrothorn as a very bulky Spikes user. Unlike Ferrothorn, however, Deoxys-D does not carry a weakness to Fire-type attacks, and can easily heal its wounds mid-game rather than having to rely on Leech Seed. Spikes is a fantastic move, and supplies the team with entry hazard support. Deoxys-D can increase its longevity with clever use of Recover and Taunt. The choice for the third moveslot depends on the team's needs; if you do not want Deoxys-D to be forced to switch upon being Taunted, then you can opt to use Seismic Toss. Alternatively, Magic Coat allows Deoxys-D to reflect Taunt, entry hazards, and status back at the opposition, but it generally requires very good prediction. Knock Off allows Deoxys-D to take full advantage of its defenses and deprive the opposition of their items, but its lack of power often makes it setup bait for the opposition.</p> <p>Stealth Rock can be used over any of Deoxys-D's other moves on the set if needed. If Deoxys-D forgoes Seismic Toss or Knock Off for Stealth Rock, Deoxys-D loses the ability to damage setup sweepers, and is prone to becoming setup fodder. If Stealth Rock is used over Magic Coat or Taunt, it risks becoming Taunt bait for the enemy. Stealth Rock can be used instead of Spikes as a decent alternative, but the solid 25% damage to all grounded sweepers is arguably more reliable. Dropping Recover for Stealth Rock drastically reduces Deoxys-D's longevity, and is never recommended.</p> <p>Deoxys-D cannot handle Xatu, Whimsicott (if it is not carrying Magic Coat), Kyogre, or Reshiram, so it greatly appreciates the assistance of teammates that can. Deoxys-D also likes teammates that can take advantage of its hazards and bulk. Frail sweepers, such as Rayquaza, appreciate the hazards Deoxys-D provides and can use the alien as cover when the opposition sends in a check or counter. Lastly, Deoxys-D appreciates spinblocker support so that all its hard work does not get spun away. Giratina-O distinguishes itself from the crowd as it, unlike other spinblockers, can demolish the spinning foes with a Draco Meteor, and call upon the alien to take its place on the battlefield when its power weakens.</p>"

  "Deoxys-Speed": {
    "overview": "<p>The fifth generation was definitely not kind to Pokemon's sovereign of speed. Newcomers with fantastic abilities—Prankster and Magic Bounce, the former used by Thundurus-I and Sableye, and the latter used by Xatu and Espeon—mess with the alien in its Speed forme. Additionally, BW brought Team Preview with it, drastically hindering Deoxys-S's main role as a lead, as your foe can simply change its lineup order to effectively counter Deoxys-S's attempts. Lack of offensive prowess also puts Deoxys-S in a disadvantage versus most of Ubers's threats. Yet, Deoxys-S still remains one of the best leads in the game. With a gigantic arsenal of support moves, such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, Magic Coat, Taunt, Reflect, and Light Screen, under its belt, Deoxys is a real team player. Its Speed stat is unmatched and allows it to outspeed Ubers's finest Choice Scarf users, Genesect and Palkia. Play carefully with or against Deoxys-S, as with every turn that goes by, another layer of entry hazards is set or another turn of a screen is wasted.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive set with Life Orb as its item consisting moves such as Psycho Boost, Ice Beam, Superpower, Grass Knot, Thunder, Dark Pulse, Hidden Power Fire, or Fire Punch can be used in order to make use of Deoxys-S's ridiculously high Speed stat, which allows it to outpace common threats such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, Rayquaza, and all Choice Scarf users up to base 100 Speed. Nasty Plot can be used to boost Deoxys-S's usable Special Attack, but it won't be able to find the time to boost and do enough damage. However, as mentioned before, Deoxys-S's offensive presence is lackluster, so you'd probably be better off using another attacker. Skill Swap can be used to catch Magic Bounce and Prankster users, such as Xatu, Espeon, and Sableye on the switch, making Deoxys-S's job much easier to do. Counter and Magic Coat help Deoxys-S use its mediocre bulk and lack of offensive prowess in order to eliminate certain targets or U-turn switches, but require a decent amount of prediction.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to Deoxys-S's lack of offensive presence, countering it pretty much means to not enable it from setting up multiple layers of entry hazards. Therefore, Xatu makes a phenomenal counter (as long as Deoxys-S doesn't have Skill Swap!); it doesn't take much from Fire Punch, has Roost to recover lost damage, and thanks to its Magic Bounce ability, it completely messes Deoxys-S up by bouncing Taunt or entry hazards back. Espeon also has Magic Bounce which can be very useful if you manage to evade Fire Punch, as lack of recovery and lackluster defenses means that the damage will stack and Espeon will no longer be able to do its job. Tentacruel is also a brilliant way to beat Deoxys-S. Thanks to its high Special Defense, it can easily shrug many Psycho Boosts, it resists Fire Punch, carries Rapid Spin, and if rain is up, it can gain lost health back quickly.</p> <p>Magic Bounce, however, is not the only new ability the fifth generation has brought. Prankster users now have priority for non-attacking moves, making Taunt usually go first. Thus, Tornadus-I, Thundurus-I, and Sableye are brilliant ways to attempt to block Deoxys-S's attempts. Be wary though, Deoxys-S can use Magic Coat to bounce back Taunt, throwing your attempts to waste. Another extremely effective way to limit Deoxys-S's setup turns is by utilizing priority. Giratina-O's Shadow Sneak is a guaranteed 2HKO, whereas Deoxys-S cannot do much in return. Extreme Speed Rayquaza or Arceus formes are also effective, as thanks to the Fire-type resistance or high bulk, Deoxys-S won't do much in return. Scizor does not like Fire Punch but Deoxys-S does not OHKO 200 HP variants, whereas they 2HKO with Bullet Punch. All of the aforementioned priority users are also capable of finishing off a weakened Deoxys-S.</p> <p>Dedicated anti-leads like Froslass, Deoxys-A, and Cloyster are capable of limiting Deoxys-S to a single layer of entry hazards. Tyranitar, while not liking Superpower, brings Deoxys-S down to its Focus Sash with its STAB Crunch, and thanks to its Sand Stream ability, sandstorm damage finishes Deoxys-S off. A Magic Coat coming from Pokemon such as Arceus, Giratina-O, Latias, Latios, and Mewtwo can surprise Deoxys-S and bounce back its moves. Opposing Deoxys formes can also run Magic Coat, engaging a mindgame each turn. Deoxys-S's high base Speed means that if you want to revenge kill it with a Choice Scarf user, you can't just use any ordinary one. Common users of Choice Scarf such as Salamence, Palkia, and Genesect are outsped. For a Choice Scarf Pokemon to outspeed Deoxys-S, it must have a Speed stat of more than 337. This means that Terrakion, Mewtwo, Shaymin-S, and Darkrai all outspeed Deoxys-S with a Choice Scarf equipped.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Hazard Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Faster than the entire game, has access to two forms of entry hazards, can combat opposing entry hazard leads with Magic Coat and Taunt—what more can you ask for? Deoxys-S is the epitome of Pokemon's entry hazard leads, and because of that, this is what you'd call Deoxys-S's standard set. As Deoxys-S is faster than Genesect, a commonly seen Choice Scarf user, it can utilize Fire Punch to leave a huge dent in Genesect, as it only has 12.5% chance to survive. Taunt and Magic Coat are mainly to combat opposing entry hazard leads. However, both come with a bonus: Taunt stops setup boosters like Arceus and Rayquaza and Magic Coat can play mindgames with opposing Deoxys-S and cripple Prankster users, namely Tornadus, Thundurus, and Sableye. Spikes is a fantastic entry hazard that many teams appreciate, and allows many Pokemon to sweep effectively. Stealth Rock is another entry hazard Deoxys-S gets access to, however, it is less preferred as Stealth Rock is not a rare sight in many other Pokemon's movepools. Fire Punch is better than Hidden Power Fire, as it will do more damage to Excadrill, a common spinner.</p> <p>252 Attack EVs are used to score an OHKO on Genesect 87.5% of the time. 252 Speed EVs allow Deoxys-S be faster than every other Pokemon in the game, and Speed tie with opposing Deoxys-S if needed. The leftover 4 EVs are dropped into Defense to grant Genesect a Special Attack boost, which will allow Deoxys-S to tank U-turn better. Feel free to move the 252 EVs from Attack to HP to increase Deoxys-S's bulk, and it doing so, use Stealth Rock in Fire Punch's moveslot. Deoxys-S's bulk is often underestimated; With a little defensive investment, it can avoid the 2HKO from positive-natured Giratina-O's Shadow Sneak. To achieve this, Deoxys-S will need to use Impish nature with 252 HP and 148 Defense EVs and Leftovers as its item. If interested in special bulk as well, 252 HP and 92 SpD EVs will allow Deoxys-S to tank maximum invested neutral-natured Giratina-O's Draco Meteor without a Focus Sash. If you use a bulky spread and are interested in Stealth Rock, you should use it over one of the last two moves listed on the set.</p> <p>Rocky Helmet can be used as an item to defeat Custap Berry leads, mainly Forretress, and get pinch damage on physical attackers. However, this item is extremely situational and will often result in just a single layer of entry hazards instead of multiple. You can sacrifice a move from the ones listed above, but generally the others are more effective and make Deoxys-S harder to play the mindgames against. Leppa Berry, while also extremely situational, can be used to win PP wars against opposing Deoxys-S and other Magic Coat Pokemon, as it restores PP. Lastly, Mental Herb can be used to cure Taunt.</p> <p>Extreme Speed can be used to have a shot at preventing Forretress's Custap Berry activation, as Fire Punch damages it right into the activation range. Extreme Speed's new mechanics allow Deoxys-S to bypass Forretress's Custap Berry-influenced moves. Dark Pulse is a possibility to hit opposing Deoxys-S, Deoxys-A, and Mewtwo. It also hits Espeon and Xatu for a 2HKO, which think they can use their ability to take on Deoxys-S. Its flinch rate might also be useful, as Deoxys-S is the fastest Pokemon in the game. The combination of Extreme Speed and Dark Pulse can be used to take out opposing Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A leads as well. Superpower can nuke Tyranitar, Darkrai, and Dialga and get some damage on Arceus. Psycho Boost is Deoxys-S's strongest attack, and it can be utilized to leave dents in Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza. Ice Beam can be used to hit Salamence, Rayquaza, and Groudon for some damage, but other than these targets it's fairly useless and weak. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Skarmory and Forretress harder, but as mentioned, Fire Punch is generally better as it comes with the bonus of hitting Excadrill. Skill Swap is another cool move to render switch-ins such as Xatu, Espeon, and Sableye useless, as they rely on their ability to defeat Deoxys-S. A moveset of one entry hazard and three attacks or two entry hazards and two attacks of the aforementioned ones can be used to have some coverage, but Deoxys-S will not be able to keep entry hazards off your side of the field.</p> <p>Priority users, such as Giratina-O, Rayquaza, and Arceus, are this set's biggest nightmare. They hit strong enough to 2HKO Deoxys-S, limiting it to only a single layer of hazards. Darkrai and Dialga can tear Giratina-O apart, Genesect can beat Rayquaza with Ice Beam, and Terrakion can beat Rayquaza and Arceus. Arceus-Ghost is capable of beating all three while also spinblocking for Deoxys-S, but it will take severe damage, especially from Rayquaza. Tentacruel is a complete stop to this set as it can beat Deoxys-S with Scald and Rapid Spin away the precious hazards it has worked hard for. Earthquake Giratina-O can spinblock for Deoxys-S and 2HKO Tentacruel. While Groudon cannot spinblock, it is capable of OHKOing Tentacruel and laying down Stealth Rock. Giratina-O and Arceus-Ghost excel as spinblockers in order to preserve Deoxys-S work, especially if it's not using a Fire-type move.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Like the previous set, Deoxys-S utilizes its gigantic Speed stat in order to aid teams, however, this set is meant to aid hyper offensive teams more than balanced teams. Hyper offensive teams use the pressure created by multiple setup sweepers in order to overwhelm the opponent's team with boosted attacks. Thus, the combination of Reflect and Light Screen is perfect for said teams. By halving the power of opponent's attacks for eight turns with Light Clay, Deoxys-S grants its teammates enough time to set up and pull off a sweep. Taunt is used to stop opposing setup sweepers like Rayquaza and Arceus. Stealth Rock is the most basic entry hazard and is necessary for offensive teams in order to break Focus Sash users and get pinch damage. Fire Punch can be used to severely damage Forretress and Genesect.</p> <p>The EVs with Jolly nature grant Deoxys-S as much bulk as possible and allow it to outspeed the entire game, both of which allow it to set up at least one screen. Focus Sash can be used to ensure the setup of both screens, however, if you use moves properly (set up the screen which halves the power of your opponent's moves), you will ensure Deoxys-S has enough time to set up both. Magic Coat can be used to beat opposing Taunt users, such as opposing Deoxys-S or Sableye, but hyper offensive teams appreciate the full stop of entry hazard or setup Pokemon more. Spikes is an option over Stealth Rock if you can find a member on your team to use it. However, most of the hyper offensive teams are fast-paced and don't have the time to set up Spikes. Moreover, Spikes takes away turns from dual screens.</p> <p>As mentioned before, setup sweepers pair best with this set. Arceus formes, Rayquaza, Terrakion, Groudon, Darkrai, Mewtwo, Omastar, Kabutops, Landorus-T, Zekrom, Bisharp, Cloyster, and Excadrill are all superb setup sweepers in the Ubers metagame that can wreak havoc once boosted. Gorebyss can use the screens to boost her subpar bulk in order to get a Shell Smash boost under her belt and pass it to some other sweeper.</p>"
      },
      "TrickScarf": {
        "description": "<p>Deoxys-S's Speed makes it viable as a Choice Scarf user. Yes, this is no joke. The same way you did not see this coming, your opponent will not as well! Thanks to its unparalleled Speed, when equipped with Choice Scarf, it is almost guaranteed that Deoxys-S will move first, allowing it to Trick away its Choice Scarf to an opposing lead, or, more importantly, an enemy setup sweeper. Trick helps Deoxys-S buy time to set up Spikes on a Choice-locked setup move, such as Rock Polish or Stealth Rock. Even without Tricking away its Choice Scarf, Deoxys-S can use the bulk it now has to just rapidly stack up Spikes. Taunt also helps in shutting the locked Pokemon down completely, forcing them to use Struggle. It also helps stop opposing entry hazard leads, such as Deoxys-S, Forretress, or Froslass. Fire Punch allows Deoxys-S to get damage on Genesect and other entry hazard Pokemon, such as Forretress and Ferrothorn. However, Superpower helps Deoxys-S get damage on Darkrai, Tyranitar, and Dialga, which can come in handy.</p> <p>The EV spread might look a bit weird, but it has its purposes. 252 HP with 100 SpD EVs allows Deoxys-S to tank maximum invested Giratina-O's Draco Meteor and maximum invested neutral-natured Lustrous Orb Palkia's Hydro Pump out of rain, while maximum invested neutral-natured non-Life Orb Darkrai's Dark Pulse only has 12.5% chance to OHKO. Jolly nature and 8 Speed EVs allow Deoxys-S do some crazy stuff. With Choice Scarf still active, Deoxys-S will still outspeed +2 positive-natured Rayquaza and +3 neutral-natured Blaziken. Without Choice Scarf, it still outspeeds Choice Scarfed base 90s such as Kyogre and Dialga, +2 Beartic, and +2 Omastar.</p> <p>There are a couple of alternate moves you can use in the last slot. Ice Punch can be used to hit Rayquaza, Salamence, and many other Dragon-type Pokemon lurking in Ubers for super effective damage. Stealth Rock can be used to have another entry hazard on Deoxys-S, but due to Choice Scarf, dual entry hazards won't work properly.</p> <p>Some sort of entry hazard control is actually needed for this set. Deoxys-S might Trick its item onto an opponent that will use Spikes, and while it can effectively Taunt, a layer of entry hazards is already up. Moreover, if you choose to initiate a stack war, both sides will end with three layers of Spikes on their side. Excadrill is an amazing partner for this reason as it can also set up Stealth Rock. If choosing the Taunt route, Groudon and Dialga are excellent picks, as they can lay down Stealth Rock as well and eliminate opposing Spikers with Fire Punch and Fire Blast, respectively. A spinblocker is advised as well, so Giratina-O and Arceus-Ghost make fine partners, as they can also make use of Deoxys-S's Spikes by shuffling or aiding for sweep, respectively. Once again, setup partners love entry hazards, so Arceus formes, Rayquaza, Mewtwo, and Darkrai are all excellent choices.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon can do one thing and one thing alone in Ubers: wall the most popular Pokemon in the metagame, Kyogre. With access to Recover, Toxic, Mirror Coat, Yawn, and other annoying moves, Gastrodon can come in for free on Kyogre and provide team support, spread status, or just be annoying in general. Whilst Gastrodon faces competition from Shedinja and Quagsire in the Kyogre-annoyer field, it requires less team support than Shedinja to be successful, and has far superior special bulk to Quagsire, arguably making it the best option. Not only that, but Gastrodon can also hit surprisingly hard if it manages to get a Storm Drain boost, meaning it isn't complete Taunt bait.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Yawn lets Gastrodon try to phaze or induce sleep, but fails against the somewhat common RestTalk Kyogre, and synergizes poorly with Toxic's and Scald's chances to inflict status. Memento is an interesting option, or at least it would be if Gastrodon was fast enough to use it well. Counter can also be used somewhat effectively; Scarf Zekrom's Outrage will always fail to OHKO, but don't ask me how the poor sea slug would switch in on it. The mixed set's Dragon Claw will also fail to OHKO, but its Outrage stands a 50% chance, so be warned. Defensive investment is highly required in this case so that Gastrodon can survive all kinds of Life Orb-boosted Outrages; Gastrodon deals fairly well with Kyogre even without Special Defense investment. Stockpile is also a viable option, but inevitably leaves Gastrodon setup bait to the multiple Calm Mind users in the tier, and other boosters such as Extreme Killer Arceus.</p> <p>Gastrodon also gets Sand Force via Dream World. Though in itself an excellent ability, it is rather out of place on Gastrodon because of its poor offenses, and the only reason one would use Gastrodon in Ubers would be to tackle Kyogre. Furthermore, sandstorm is not a prevalent weather effect in Ubers, and thus this ability sees little use on Gastrodon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In one-and-a-half words, Grass-types. Shaymin-S completely destroys Gastrodon no matter what it attempts to do, easily setting up Substitute if Gastrodon lacks Ice Beam. Ferrothorn can OHKO all Gastrodon variants with an uninvested Power Whip, or set up Spikes and Stealth Rock with impunity. Arceus-Grass poses an enormous threat as it can force Gastrodon out for a free boost. Even if Gastrodon stays in and uses Toxic, Arceus can often get multiple boosts at no real cost if it packs Refresh. Groudon can hit Gastrodon hard and set up on it, although if Groudon is present on the opponent's team, Kyogre will most likely not be there, giving your team a small advantage. Some variants of Kyogre can also prove annoying to face, namely RestTalk and Substitute + Calm Mind: the former easily PP stalls Gastrodon, while the latter blocks status effectively.</p> <p>Generally speaking, however, Gastrodon just isn't effective in the tier at all outside of its niche of dealing with certain special attackers. If it is being used in a situation where it isn't reacting to a special attacker, chances are it isn't going to pose a threat to your team.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>One of Gastrodon's best qualities is its ability to come in on offensive Kyogre variants and stop them in their tracks. With immunities to both Water Spout and Thunder, and taking only 22.1% - 26.4% from an unboosted Ice Beam, Gastrodon can simply hit Kyogre with Toxic and spam Recover until Kyogre dies or switches out. Needless to say, this set is most effective against Kyogre's Choice sets, but it can also deal with other sets in a pinch. Support sets that run Thunder Wave over Water Spout are easily dealt with, and offensive Calm Mind sets also run into trouble. Even a +6 Ice Beam isn't guaranteed an OHKO, at which point Toxic will likely have killed Kyogre. RestTalk sets are troublesome as they can PP stall Gastrodon successfully, although if Sleep Talk selects Surf persistently, then Gastrodon can bolster the power of its own Scald to devastating levels, steamrolling Kyogre along with the rain boost.</p> <p>Scald is Gastrodon's primary attacking move, as the Special Attack boost gained from switching into Kyogre's Water-type moves allows it to hit neutral targets hard. It also has the advantage of occasionally burning Steel-types, who can otherwise come in on Gastrodon fairly easily. Recover is godly for Gastrodon, and vastly increasing its stalling power against many special attackers. Toxic is used to stack up residual damage and help Gastrodon stall in the first place, although if Toxic Spikes support is provided then Gastrodon can afford to run an extra attacking or utility move in its place. Mirror Coat is the primary option for the last slot because it allows Gastrodon to check other special attackers, such as Palkia and Dialga. With the given EV set, Gastrodon is never 2HKOed by Timid Lustrous Orb Palkia's Spacial Rend, and Gastrodon can thus rebound the attack with Mirror Coat for an easy OHKO on Palkia, recovering the damage off at some other point. Dialga's Draco Meteor also fails to 2HKO Gastrodon, letting it switch in and recover off the damage. However, Gastrodon has several other viable options for the last slot. Earth Power provides a useful secondary STAB and can hit Dragon-types harder than Scald after the Storm Drain boost. Clear Smog can be used to deal with Calm Mind users more directly; sadly, it fails against Arceus-Steel. On the other hand, Mirror Coat is arguably more effective against some Calm Mind users, as they will often fail to OHKO Gastrodon with their attacks, allowing it to bounce back the damage for an easy OHKO of your own. For example, a +6 Arceus-Steel Judgment only deals 57.7% - 68.3% to Gastrodon.</p> <p>The Speed EVs let Gastrodon outspeed uninvested Forretress, saving your team from an extra layer of hazards in certain situations, which is always nice. Furthermore, if Gastrodon has absorbed one of Kyogre's attacks and the opponent switches to Forretress in response, a rain- and Storm Drain-boosted Scald can even 2HKO specially defensive variants. A physically defensive EV spread is also usable, and helps to make Gastrodon with Clear Smog a more reliable check to many physical attackers. With 252 Defense EVs and a Calm nature, Gastrodon can take a +2 Life Orb Extreme Speed from Arceus or two Outrages from Lustrous Orb Palkia. It can also survive a High Jump Kick from 252 Adamant Life Orb Blaziken. Such a spread is not particularly good though, as most teams that use Gastrodon to ward off Kyogre would be using its antithesis Groudon, which obviously outclasses Gastrodon as a physical wall. Ice Beam can also be used as a secondary attacking option, as it hits Grass- and Dragon- types that resist Scald hard.</p>"

  "Bronzong": {
    "overview": "<p>Though this generation brought nothing new to Bronzong, it remains a very reliable supporter in Ubers. It has resistances to the common Dragon-, Ice-, and Ground-type moves seen in the tier. Bronzong has only one weakness, but thanks to the popularity of Kyogre, even that weakness can be remedied. Bronzong's unique typing and ability thus set it apart from other Steel-types seen in Ubers. Wish users such as Chansey also make up for its lack of recovery moves. Overall, whether it is setting up dual screens or just plain walling threats, these qualities all make Bronzong a great support Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bronzong can use a Calm Mind set with Flash Cannon or Psyshock but it's generally a waste of Bronzong's walling prowess. Grass Knot is Bronzong's strongest move against Groudon, but Groudon cannot touch Bronzong outside of Fire Punch anyway. Kyogre takes little damage from Grass Knot due to its mammoth Special Defense so Grass Knot isn't worth using over Bronzong's standard attacks. Rest can be used for recovery, but it is unreliable especially with the new sleep mechanics. Rock Slide can 2HKO Ho-Oh but does nothing else. Hypnosis is extremely unreliable, so it isn't recommended even when Bronzong can afford to miss a few times. Hidden Power Ice 2HKOes Rayquaza and Garchomp, but is useless otherwise. Payback is only useful for stopping Sub Calm Mind Giratina-O from setting up on Bronzong, and is generally a horrible option. Heatproof can be used to fool the opponent, but is generally a horrible option as it makes Bronzong vulnerable to Spikes and Earthquake. Macho Brace powers up Gyro Ball and can be used in conjunction with Trick to cripple sweepers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ho-Oh is probably the best counter to Bronzong, as it fears nothing but the occasional Rock Slide or Toxic on the switch-in, and can easily set up a Substitute on poor Bronzong. Sacred Fire will not only burn Bronzong, but eliminate it. Kyogre sets up on Bronzong easily, and Choice Specs Water Spout is an OHKO. Arceus-Steel, as well as Arceus-Dark with Refresh, can set up on Bronzong for free, as they don't fear Toxic. Keep in mind that Bronzong might be able to set up dual screens on Arceus-Steel though. Giratina laughs at whatever Bronzong has to offer and can burn it. Heatran walls Bronzong if it lacks Earthquake, KOing it with its STAB Fire-type attacks. Ferrothorn and Skarmory use Bronzong as setup bait. Reshiram hates Earthquake, but Choice Specs Blue Flare in the sun will OHKO Bronzong even through Light Screen. Manaphy gets to set up on Bronzong easily too, and has Hydration to heal status. However, keep in mind that most of the counters listed barring Giratina and the Steel-types hate taking an Explosion to the face.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>There are generally only three commonly used Steel-types in the Uber tier: Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Arceus-Steel. Dialga is neutral to Dragon-type attacks, so it is left out in the list. Bronzong has an Earthquake immunity thanks to Levitate, which allows it to completely wall many threats that the other Steel-types can only dream of achieving. It also makes an excellent user of Stealth Rock, which greatly limits the life span of offensive behemoths, such as Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, and Shaymin-S. Bronzong completely walls Shaymin-S, and and is capable of walling Rayquaza if the dragon decides to drop a Fire-type attack.</p> <p>Toxic can be used to take out bulky Pokemon such as Lugia and Arceus-Ground who can't touch Bronzong in return. Keep in mind that Bronzong needs Toxic to bring down bulky sweepers such as Calm Mind Recover Arceus and Groudon. Gyro Ball is Bronzong's most powerful attack and is thus the preferred attacking option. Due to Bronzong's low Speed, Gyro Ball can 2HKO Mewtwo and Darkrai after Stealth Rock damage. However, if you really hate Heatran, or want to at least prevent Dialga from coming in for free, Earthquake can be used instead. It also wrecks the occasional Magnezone coming in to trap and eliminate Bronzong. Momentum is a very important thing to have in Ubers, and Bronzong can keep a team's momentum by setting up dual screens, which also soften the blows Bronzong has to swallow. For example, with Reflect, Bronzong can easily wall Extreme Killer Arceus, and Light Screen gives Bronzong a chance to survive a Blue Flare from Choice Scarf Reshiram in the sun!</p> <p>Leftovers is the standard item on defensive Pokemon. However, Light Clay can be used to prolong the effects of the dual screens, which will help most offensive teams. The EV spread and Sassy nature maximize Bronzong's special bulk, helping it deal with the special attacks which are ubiquitous in Ubers. However, a physically defensive EV spread and a Relaxed nature can be used to deal with most Swords Dance Arceus formes, as well as any Groudon and Rayquaza lacking a Fire-type move. Trick Room can also be used on this set over a screen move.</p> <p>Wish support from the likes of Chansey or Blissey is very useful due to Bronzong's lack of a reliable instant recovery move. With Wish support, Bronzong can stay alive much longer and take repeated hits. Bronzong is very vulnerable to Trick users, so Giratina-O makes a great partner because it is immune to the move. Kyogre is a staple on rain teams, where Bronzong generally find its home in. The two have excellent defensive synergy as well; Bronzong resists Grass-type attacks and checks Arceus-Grass for Kyogre, while Kyogre drowns any Fire-type and brings torrential rain to the field. Ho-Oh might be a decent partner for Bronzong as it absorbs Fire-type attacks easily, but Bronzong prefers to play in the rain. Palkia makes a good teammate as well because it resists Fire-type attacks, while Bronzong in return soaks up Dragon-type assaults and provides dual screen support. Tentacruel can survive Fire-type attacks easily and provide Toxic Spikes support. Bronzong helps take out Arceus-Ground and Groudon for it, making it a good teammate as well.</p> <p>Bronzong's aforementioned resistances give it plenty of opportunities to come in and set up dual screens. It can brave Earthquake, Ice Beam, Dragon Pulse, Draco Meteor, and even Seed Flare with little worry and use that time to set up both screens. With dual screen support, frail sweepers such as Rayquaza and Lucario can clean late-game easily. For example, Rayquaza can survive a Spacial Rend from Palkia, set up Swords Dance, and KO Palkia the next turn, a feat it normally cannot achieve. If Reflect is up, Lucario can actually survive an Earthquake from Groudon, nearly KOing back if it has two Swords Dance boosts under its belt. Groudon is also a decent candidate to make use of screens support too, as even Choice Specs Kyogre's Ice Beam will fail to OHKO Groudon with Light Screen support, while a +2 Earthquake will OHKO any Kyogre variant.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Just like in OU, Bronzong is one of the most reliable users of Trick Room. Gyro Ball is standard fare, as it provides STAB coverage and can nearly OHKO Darkrai or Mewtwo. Other speedy Pokemon in Ubers are easily eliminated by Bronzong. Explosion can still be used to tear holes in the opponent's team despite the nerf, also allowing a Trick Room sweeper to switch in for free. However, if you don't have a Stealth Rock user, Bronzong itself can run Stealth Rock over Explosion. Earthquake can 2HKO Dialga and finishes Heatran in one hit.</p> <p>Using Life Orb gives Bronzong some decent firepower. Unlike a normal support set, this Bronzong aims for a more offensive approach and as such, having dedicated Trick Room sweepers are a key to Bronzong's success. While most Ubers are bulky, Bronzong has that auspicious typing and isn't vulnerable to hazards at all which allows it to set up Trick Room easily. Trick Room sweepers such as Victini, Dialga, Kyogre, and Reshiram will appreciate Bronzong's support, as Bronzong can even give them a free switch in through Explosion. Stallbreakers such as Rayquaza and Zekrom are very useful, because defensive teams are the bane of Trick Room teams. The latter also smashes Kyogre to bits, making it a good teammate. If you really hate Ho-Oh, Rock Slide can be used to OHKO the rainbow turkey. Dialga and Palkia make awesome partners not only because of their sheer power, but also because they are the main users of Trick Room in Ubers. Palkia also boasts a 4x resistance to Fire-type attacks, which is Bronzong's only weakness. Dialga can lure in and smash Blissey with Outrage, paving the way for special attackers to sweep under Trick Room.</p>"

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>The generation shift brought Garchomp no notable moves and basically left it the same old Garchomp. This, however, is not a bad thing by any means, since Garchomp is just as as threatening as ever with its great base 102 Speed, which allows it to outspeed a good portion of the tier, and awesome base 130 Attack. In addition, Garchomp also has excellent Dragon- and Ground-type STABs, which allow it to hit nearly everything in the game for at least neutral damage. However, Garchomp does have its shortcomings; its defenses, while still decent, pale in comparison to the Uber tier's powerhouses. Also, its great STAB moves can only carry it so far, and it will sometimes find itself walled quite easily. With the changes BW2 brought to the metagame, namely the reintroduction of Soul Dew, Latias and Latios have seen a major rise in their previously rock-bottom usage. This is a stumbling block for Garchomp, as they both easily outspeed and threaten it with their own powerful Dragon-type attacks if Garchomp isn't using a Choice Scarf.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Garchomp does not have a very wide movepool, so it's rather strapped for options. Garchomp can go mixed, but its base 80 Special Attack is rather underwhelming, especially in Ubers. It is best to just stick with physical sets, maybe with Fire Blast thrown in. Crunch can be used to hit Psychic-types harder than Earthquake, but there are better options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Timid Lugia can outspeed all but Choice Scarf Garchomp, set up Reflect in Garchomp's face, Roost off the damage, and then proceed to KO Garchomp with Ice Beam. Groudon can wall the Choice Scarf set to a degree, but it struggles to wall the other sets due to their sheer damage output and its own lack of reliable recovery. Most Steel-types can switch into Garchomp locked into Outrage. Of particular note are Skarmory and Ferrothorn. Skarmory is immune to Earthquake and resistant to Outrage, and can also set up Spikes while Roosting off the damage. Skarmory can even rack up some passive damage with Whirlwind. Ferrothorn can Leech Seed Garchomp and set up Spikes in its face. Thanks to Iron Barbs and Leech Seed, Garchomp will be losing 25% of its health each turn it decides to attack. However, a Fire Fang or Fire Blast will make quick work of either of them. A boosted Earthquake will also 2HKO Ferrothorn easily. Bronzong resists all of Garchomp's moves, and can do some damage with Gyro Ball. Deoxys-D can wall the Choice Scarf set but fails against every other set. Defensive Arceus can stomach a boosted Outrage, outspeed it, and OHKO it with Ice Beam the next turn.</p> <p>Wobbuffet can revenge kill the Choice sets with ease. Mewtwo can outspeed and KO all but Choice Scarf Garchomp with Ice Beam. Darkrai can also do the same, except it can also put Garchomp to sleep with Dark Void. From there, it can set up on Garchomp and beat it with a boosted Dark Pulse. Choice Scarf Palkia and Zekrom can outspeed and decimate Garchomp with Spacial Rend or Outrage, respectively. However, both need to watch out for Choice Scarf variants and the rare Haban Berry Garchomp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Garchomp remains as effective a revenge killer as it was last generation. When equipped with a Choice Scarf, it hits a 499 Speed stat, outspeeding every Pokemon in the tier bar Deoxys-S. Fantastic dual STABs allow Garchomp to hit every Pokemon in the tier for at least neutral damage, Skarmory and Bronzong being the only semi-common Pokemon there who resist the combo. Garchomp is especially useful in checking powerful speedy Dragon-types such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza and opposing Choice Scarf users such as Palkia. Outrage, coming off Garchomp's base 130 Attack, allows Garchomp to revenge kill most Pokemon quite reliably. For example, Outrage does 83% - 98% to max HP Zekrom, so it's an OHKO roughly 50% of the time factoring Stealth Rock damage. Earthquake smashes any Steel-type hoping to wall Garchomp to pieces (besides the two semi-common ones mentioned above). Dragon Claw allows Garchomp to use its Dragon-type STAB without getting locked in, and thus avoid becoming setup bait for Pokemon such as Rock Polish Groudon. Stone Edge allows Garchomp to dent Ho-Oh and Lugia, who would otherwise laugh at Garchomp's attempts. Stone Edge is a sure OHKO on Ho-Oh and, with Stealth Rock, has a chance to 2HKO Timid Lugia.</p> <p>Garchomp can run Fire Fang or Fire Blast to roast Skarmory or Ferrothorn. With sun support, Fire Fang does 95.5% - 112.5% to specially defensive Ferrothorn (which is more commonly seen), meaning Ferrothorn will always be OHKOed if it has taken Stealth Rock damage. With Fire Blast, Ferrothorn is OHKOed regardless. Garchomp can also utilize Toxic instead of Stone Edge to cripple Lugia.</p> <p>Since Choice Scarf Garchomp lacks the raw power of Choice Band or Swords Dance Garchomp, Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes are critical for Garchomp to net important OHKOs. Stealth Rock allows Garchomp to OHKO Palkia and Rayquaza with Dragon Claw. Outrage will always OHKO Giratina-O with Stealth Rock, and a layer of Spikes ensures Earthquake will take down the mighty Dialga. Deoxys-S and Forretress can both reliably set up Stealth Rock as well as Spikes. Forretress is a particularly useful teammate since it resists Dragon- and Ice-type attacks, while Garchomp can switch in on any Fire-type attack aimed at Forretress. Forretress can also keep entry hazards off the field with Rapid Spin. Ferrothorn can also team up with Garchomp, but lacks a resistance to Ice-type attacks.</p> <p>Garchomp loves sandstorm, which activates its Sand Veil ability. This allows Garchomp to evade attacks aimed at it and destroy its opponent with a suitable move. Tyranitar is the only viable Sand Stream user in Ubers. If sandstorm is being used, Excadrill makes a good teammate with its fantastic Sand Rush ability. It resists Dragon-type attacks, and can form a deadly offensive core with Garchomp. However, it must also be noted that sandstorm is hard to maintain in Ubers due to the omnipresent Kyogre and Groudon. That said, Kyogre makes a good teammate as it can easily check Skarmory, Lugia, and Groudon, all of whom give Garchomp trouble. Garchomp can switch into any Thunder aimed at Kyogre, while Kyogre can take Ice Beams for Garchomp in return.</p> <p>Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, Arceus-Steel, Scizor, and Skarmory can switch into Choice Dragon-type attacks thanks to their resistance. However, all Steel-types other than Ferrothorn and Skarmory need to be wary of Earthquake. Skarmory makes an excellent counter to Garchomp. It resists Outrage, and is immune to Earthquake. Fire Fang does a paltry 24.6% - 29.3% without sunlight, while Skarmory can set up Spikes in Garchomp's face or Whirlwind it away. Skarmory can also poison Garchomp with Toxic while Roosting off the damage. Lugia takes 35.6% - 42.1% from Outrage and can set up Reflect. Lugia can then proceed to Roost and phaze Garchomp with Whirlwind or threaten a KO with Ice Beam. Groudon laughs at Garchomp's attempts to damage it and can 2HKO (most of the time) with Dragon Claw or phaze Garchomp with Dragon Tail. Deoxys-D is not 2HKOed by Outrage and has no problem walling Garchomp. Choice Band Scizor can put a dent in Garchomp with its priority Technician-boosted Bullet Punch, but Fire Fang will scorch Scizor's metal exoskeleton quite badly.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Garchomp's excellent base 102 Speed coupled with its stellar base 130 Attack makes it a powerful Swords Dance sweeper. Garchomp's Speed allows it to outspeed a major part of the Uber tier, most notably Hasty Palkia. Its 108 / 95 / 85 defenses are also better than most other Uber sweepers. With a Swords Dance under its belt, Garchomp reaches a mind-boggling 718 Attack stat. Outrage and Earthquake provide near-perfect coverage, and Stone Edge rounds it off quite well. Fire Fang is can be used to hit Skarmory if Stone Edge's shaky 80% accuracy is a matter of concern.</p> <p>It is nearly impossible to switch into Garchomp once it has set up properly, since with just Earthquake and Outrage it can 2HKO almost the entire Uber tier, provided entry hazards have been set up. Even Groudon bows down to the wrath of Garchomp, being 2HKOed by a +2 Outrage, and OHKOed with Stealth Rock and 3 layers of Spikes. Almost any Steel-type brave enough to switch in is also swiftly taken down by a powerful STAB Earthquake. Stone Edge helps to kill Ho-Oh and Lugia, while Fire Fang ensures that overzealous Ferrothorn and Skarmory are burnt to a crisp. Life Orb increases Garchomp's damage output and ensures Garchomp will be doing maximum damage. Haban Berry is especially useful against Choice Scarf Palkia and Zekrom, since it allows Garchomp to take a Dragon-type attack from them if need be and KO them with its powerful Outrage. It must be noted, though, that without Life Orb, Garchomp loses the ability to OHKO Lugia switch-ins.</p> <p>Swords Dance Garchomp really shines with entry hazards support. Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes makes it nearly impossible to switch into Garchomp. With these two all-important entry hazards in place, Garchomp can OHKO both of the premier physical walls of Ubers, Groudon and Lugia. Deoxys-S and Forretress can set up both types of entry hazards quite well.</p> <p>Tyranitar is a good teammate since it can set up sandstorm, which allows Garchomp to occasionally grab a free turn with Sand Veil. However, it must be noted that it is quite hard to maintain sandstorm in Ubers with all the popular auto-weather Pokemon running around. If Life Orb is chosen, then paralysis support from a Pokemon such as Groudon or Kyogre is extremely helpful for Garchomp. Kyogre makes an excellent partner since it can lure in Choice Scarf Palkia and paralyze it. Kyogre can sponge Ice Beams aimed at Garchomp, while Garchomp can switch into Thunder in return. Wobbuffet can help create an opening for Garchomp with Encore, and can also trap and take out Choice Scarf Palkia and Zekrom with ease. Additionally, Tickle Wobbuffet paired with a Pursuit user like Tyranitar or Scizor can put an end to Lugia. Steel-types resist all of Garchomp's weaknesses and make good partners to it. Magnezone deserves a special mention as it can trap and eliminate opposing pesky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire, allowing Garchomp to spam Outrage more freely.</p> <p>Timid Lugia has a chance of surviving two boosted Outrages from Garchomp behind Reflect. Furthermore, it can outspeed Garchomp and do 80.4% - 95% with Ice Beam. Bold Lugia walls Garchomp as well, but it cannot outspeed Garchomp. However, neither of them would like to take a boosted Stone Edge. Steel-types can switch into Outrage and set up. Skarmory is extremely annoying and can wall most Garchomp easily due to its resistance to Dragon-type attacks, immunity to Earthquake, and ability to phaze Garchomp with Whirlwind. Bronzong can also accomplish this, but to a lesser extent. Ferrothorn can Leech Seed Garchomp and set up Spikes, while Garchomp loses 35% of its HP every turn, thanks to Life Orb recoil, Leech Seed, and Iron Barbs. Mewtwo can destroy Garchomp with Ice Beam, while Darkrai can put it to sleep and set up Nasty Plot.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Garchomp makes a fantastic Choice Band user with its excellent Speed and massive Attack stat. With this EV spread, Garchomp reaches 333 Speed and 538 Attack, meaning it will be able to outspeed and KO most of the Pokemon in Ubers. Choice Band allows Garchomp to do insane amounts of damage right off the bat without any prior setup thanks to Garchomp's excellent Dragon- and Ground-type STAB attacks, which have near-flawless coverage. Outrage will crush anything which is not a Steel-type, and Earthquake can 2HKO most Steel-types trying to wall Garchomp. Stone Edge hits any Ho-Oh and Lugia switch-ins hard. Fire Fang can be used to 2HKO Skarmory while the sun is up. Dragon Claw allows Garchomp to use its Dragon-type STAB without locking itself into Outrage.</p> <p>Garchomp can use Toxic to cripple walls such as Timid Lugia who otherwise laugh at Garchomp's assaults. Fire Blast can be used to take a decent chunk out of Skarmory. With sun support, Fire Blast will do 77.2% - 91% to physically defensive Skarmory.</p> <p>Sandstorm support from Tyranitar makes Garchomp even more annoying to deal with. Since Choice Band Garchomp is usually troubled by powerful Choice Scarf Dragon-types, Palkia in particular, Wobbuffet makes a good team mate since it can take them out with ease. Tickle Wobbuffet along with a Pursuit user can be used to take out Lugia. Paralysis support is useful to remove Pokemon who can revenge kill Garchomp out of the equation; defensive Kyogre is especially adept at this since it can lure Choice Scarf Palkia. Ferrothorn, thanks to its excellent defenses and resistances, can wall Choice Scarf Palkia and Zekrom with ease, although Fire Blast from Palkia will cook the durian to a lovely golden brown if it's not careful. Lastly, entry hazard support is always preferable, and Deoxys-S or Forretress can do the job quite well.</p> <p>Steel-types can switch into Outrage with ease. Skarmory is particularly annoying since it is immune to Earthquake and resistant to Outrage. It can switch in on Outrage, Roost off the damage, and start setting up Spikes or even phaze Garchomp out. However, a sun-boosted Fire Fang or Fire Blast will hurt, so Skarmory needs to watch out. Timid Lugia can switch in and set up Reflect. It is not 2HKOed by Outrage and can stall out Garchomp with Toxic and Roost. Garchomp is extremely vulnerable to revenge killing by powerful Choice Scarf users such as Zekrom and Palkia, both of whom can decimate Garchomp with their powerful Dragon-type STAB moves. Mewtwo and Darkrai both outspeed and OHKO Garchomp with Ice Beam. In Darkrai's case, it can also put Garchomp to sleep and set up with Nasty Plot. However, none of them can directly switch into Garchomp.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Garchomp's most infuriating set from OU makes its return in Ubers. With sandstorm support, Sand Veil Garchomp can easily hax the opposition; Substitute is used to scout for a miss and avoid nasty status. After it's safely behind a Substitute, Garchomp can set up using Swords Dance and sweep with its fantastic dual STAB. Understanding this, it is no wonder that this set is extremely easy to use. All Garchomp has to do is to switch in on something harmless, set up a Substitute, and act accordingly. If the opponent is slower than Garchomp, set up Swords Dance and continue to test your luck by making more Substitutes. If you're facing something faster than Garchomp, such as Mewtwo, attack it with Earthquake as they break your Substitute, then switch out immediately. If the opponent fails to break the Substitute, then simply repeat.</p> <p>Groudon and Kyogre require Garchomp to tread carefully, as they get rid of sandstorm, thus making Sand Veil useless. In Groudon's case, Garchomp can Swords Dance as it breaks its Substitute, and hit Groudon hard with Outrage or Earthquake as it forces Garchomp out with Dragon Tail (which won't KO). If Groudon carries Roar, however, then Garchomp will always lose. Against Kyogre, Earthquake should be used to see how much Speed and bulk it has. If it's slower than Garchomp, it can use Swords Dance the next time Kyogre switches in and KO it. If it is carrying a Choice Scarf, then it's unlikely to be able to switch into Garchomp for a second time.</p> <p>The moveset is self-explanatory. Substitute and Swords Dance allow Garchomp to set up, sometimes for free. Outrage is the preferred Dragon-type STAB move, since the Uber metagame is much bulkier in general, but Dragon Claw can be used instead for scouting purposes. Earthquake rounds out the set, hitting most Dragon-type resists very hard.</p> <p>Max Speed and Attack EVs let Garchomp use its unique Speed tier to the maximum effect. Leftovers is the preferred item since it allows Garchomp to make as many Substitutes as possible, but Haban and Yache Berries can be used to avoid being revenge killed, even without a Substitute up. A bulkier spread of 188 HP / 68 Atk / 252 Spe can be used to set up 101 HP Substitutes, but the power drop is very noticeable, and Blissey and Chansey are unlikely to stay in on Garchomp anyway. Dragon Tail is another option for the Dragon-type STAB move, especially with entry hazard support; this allows Garchomp to force Groudon and slow Lugia out first. However, Dragon Tail is extremely weak, and its negative priority completely undermines Garchomp's good Speed stat.</p> <p>Although this set is perfectly usable without relying on Sand Veil, the 20% evasion boost from sandstorm can really win you games. This is why Tyranitar and Hippowdon are excellent teammates for Garchomp. Hippowdon walls Groudon, who give Garchomp problems otherwise, and cripples it with Toxic. Tyranitar, on the other hand, can Pursuit Kyogre that are locked into Ice Beam for major damage and cause a lot of trouble for Lugia.</p> <p>Skarmory and Bronzong completely wall Garchomp, boasting resistance to Dragon-type moves while being immune to Earthquake. Investing a team slot in Magnezone to remove them can prove useful. Magic Bounce Xatu can easily switch into Skarmory and bounce back Spikes that it lays. Powerful attackers such as Choice Specs Kyogre, Choice Band Zekrom, and Mewtwo also discourage Skarmory and Bronzong from switching in too readily. Groudon and Lugia have massive Defense stats, and they don't care much about Garchomp, either. A mixed Bulk Up Dialga can lure out Groudon and KO it with Draco Meteor, as well as roasting the aforementioned Skarmory and Bronzong. Ho-Oh can switch into an Ice Beam that is directed at Garchomp, and threaten Groudon, Skarmory and Bronzong. Tyranitar causes a lot of trouble for Lugia, as does Zekrom and Darkrai. A surprise Toxic on Lugia can also go a long way.</p> <p>Arceus-Grass is also problematic for Garchomp because it resists Earthquake and forces Garchomp to use Outrage, which would allow it get revenge killed. Again, Ho-Oh makes Arceus-Grass very sad, as does Heatran and Latias. Cloyster can take a +2 Outrage or Earthquake and KOs Garchomp through Substitute with Icicle Spear. Steel-types in general can take on Cloyster. Toxic Spikes pretty much neuter Garchomp's Substitute strategy. Since sandstorm is likely to be used with Garchomp, Excadrill is an excellent offensive Rapid Spin user to use alongside Garchomp. Tentacruel can absorb Toxic Spikes, and it synergizes well with Garchomp. Arceus-Poison can do the same, while countering Arceus-Grass. Finally, Wobbuffet can Encore non-damaging attacks for Garchomp to switch in and set up on, as well as trapping and removing revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Palkia and Choice Scarf Kyogre.</p>"

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>While Hippowdon might seem statistically inferior to many Ubers, it has certain qualities that set it apart from the pack. Its great physical bulk and pure-Ground typing make it a sturdy physical wall, and while it might appear outclassed by Groudon, the hippo has some very distinct advantages over the land titan. Firstly, Hippowdon has access to reliable instant recovery, something that Groudon would kill to get. Also, unlike Groudon and Arceus-Ground, Hippowdon has the rare Sand Stream ability, which allows it to support its team in a unique way, and can open up some very interesting team options. Play Hippowdon to its advantages, and it will likely be an excellent addition to your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hippowdon has the option of running a Curse set, but given the specially offensive nature of the Uber metagame, it will be taken down way too easily. The same goes for a Stockpile set. Yawn can be used to force switches, but Whirlwind is much better, as it is not blocked by Substitute. Fire Fang can be used to hit Ferrothorn for decent damage, and discouraging it from setting up hazards with impunity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hippowdon is countered by anything that is not weak to Earthquake and has access to reasonably strong special attacks. Kyogre is especially problematic because it wipes out sandstorm and drowns virtually everything that it touches. Any Uber Dragon-type will take down Hippowdon with a Life Orb- or Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor. Physically defensive entry hazard users such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory can also use Hippowdon as setup fodder. Skarmory is particularly problematic because there is absolutely nothing Hippowdon can do to it, while Skarmory can shut down Hippowdon completely with Taunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Hippowdon's good physical bulk and access to instant recovery make it an excellent physical wall. It can easily take hits from physical attackers such as Ho-Oh, Choice Scarf Zekrom (watch out for mixed sets), Groudon, Arceus, and Excadrill. It is also a reliable Sand Stream user that can come in repeatedly to set up sandstorm, something that a stall team can use without having to run Groudon, if sunny weather is not to your fancy. Slack Off is obviously the main attraction of this set, allowing Hippowdon to take hits repeatedly and heal off the damage. Earthquake is Hippowdon's reliable STAB move, and Whirlwind allows it to force out dangerous enemies such as Ho-Oh and Arceus. Toxic is preferred in the last spot to defeat last-Pokemon Arceus, which would otherwise set up Swords Dance without fear of being forced out. Stealth Rock is a solid support option due to Hippowdon's good physical bulk, while Ice Fang can be used to score surprise KOs on Garchomp and Rayquaza.</p> <p>Hippowdon receives Sand Force from the Dream World. While it might seem like a useless ability on Hippowdon unless you run Tyranitar along with it, the ability to run something that's not Sand Stream is precious. With a relatively \"inert\" ability, Hippowdon can see use on teams based on other types of weather--apart from sun, where it faces huge competition from Groudon. In particular, it can replace Arceus-Ground on rain teams, freeing up a slot for another Arceus variant. Note that Stealth Rock is illegal with Sand Force.</p> <p>The EVs used maximize physical bulk and allow Hippowdon to avoid being 2HKOed by Ho-Oh's Life Orb-boosted Brave Bird; it can then simply recover off the damage. A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Careful nature gives Hippowdon mixed defenses rivaling those of 252/0 Arceus-Ground while further enjoying Leftovers recovery; this allows Hippowdon to take hits such as Draco Meteor from Giratina-O. However, the loss of physical bulk would mean that Hippowdon can no longer wall strong physical attacks from Ho-Oh and friends as easily. Hippowdon can also run Stone Edge in the last slot to deal huge damage to Ho-Oh, but between Stealth Rock, Whirlwind, and Slack Off, Ho-Oh is not getting past Hippowdon easily anyway.</p> <p>Hippowdon's main weakness is its lackluster Special Defense. Powerful attacks such as Draco Meteor from most Uber Dragon-types, and in particular Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks will send Hippowdon blasting off like Team Rocket. Blissey is an excellent teammate for soaking up special attacks, as is Latias for Water- and Grass-type attacks. Gastrodon pairs well with Hippowdon too, as it is one of the best Kyogre counters out there. Arceus-Rock can take advantage of the sandstorm's boost to its Special Defense to better sponge attacks such as Draco Meteor and set up Calm Mind. Ferrothorn resists most of Hippowdon's weaknesses and set up entry hazards as well. Lugia is also a great defensive partner that can wall mixed Dialga and synergizes very well with Hippowdon overall. Offensive partners to Hippowdon are essentially those that benefit from sandstorm. Excadrill, Garchomp, Landorus, and Arceus-Rock all appreciate Sand Stream support, and Hippowdon can easily switch into and wall Groudon, which gives them trouble. Ho-Oh is also a fantastic offensive partner to use alongside Hippowdon, as it can lure in Kyogre and severely damage it with Brave Bird, while also easily defeating Pokemon such as Arceus-Grass.</p>"

  "Gliscor": {
    "overview": "<p>Respectable bulk, few weaknesses, resistances to Fighting and Bug, and key immunities to grounded entry hazards, status, and Ground- and Electric-type moves provide Gliscor with ample opportunities to come in and set up a Substitute or just threaten opponents with its STAB Earthquake from its very usable Attack stat. Poison Heal and Protect provide excellent passive recovery. As one of the premier Groudon counters in the game, Gliscor can also contribute excellently to a defensive core if necessary. Unfortunately, it is very weak on the special side, so in some scenarios Gliscor can turn out to be completely dead weight. However, if you play to Gliscor's strengths, it will prove to be a marvelous asset to your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gliscor has Baton Pass, Swords Dance, and Agility at its disposal, but it is generally inferior to Mew for Baton Pass sets, as it is easily dispatched by Kyogre, even when behind dual screens.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Manaphy with rain support is arguably the best Gliscor counter, with immunity to Toxic and high defenses to avoid taking heavy Earthquake damage; it is further aided by its excellent healing option in Rest, and STAB Surf with which to hit Gliscor's Water-type weakness. Defensive Kyogre with Rest, and Refresh Arceus and Latias variants can easily shrug off Gliscor's moves and set up Calm Mind. You should also be careful of Palkia, as it can fake a Choice Scarf with Lustrous Orb and ruin your attempts to switch in something else to take the hit. Ferrothorn is immune to Toxic and takes relatively little from Earthquake; it can retaliate with Power Whips and Gyro Balls that deal enough damage to easily break Gliscor's Substitute. Skarmory has to watch out for Taunt, but is immune to Earthquake and Toxic and can set up Spikes or Whirlwind Gliscor out. Bronzong, although less common, is also immune to both moves, but cares even less about Taunt. All of these Pokemon are also more than capable of PP stalling Gliscor as well if necessary.</p> <p>A number of other things also resist the combination of Toxic and Earthquake, although they rarely if ever show up in Ubers. Crobat, Gengar, Weezing, opposing Gliscor, and Magic Bounce Xatu can halt Gliscor without the need for items, while any Poison- or Steel-type with Air Balloon, most notably Excadrill and Heatran, can switch in with impunity. Anything faster with Taunt or Substitutes that aren't broken by Earthquake can also be a problem for this set, although Toxic Spikes support can mitigate this issue somewhat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>Come in on Choice-locked Ground- or Electric-type attacks, Groudon, or something that Gliscor can force out with Earthquake, and set up a Substitute. Gliscor can then proceed to cripple the switch-in with Toxic, or just use Earthquake if they are immune to the status. The combination of Protect and Substitute provides a full 32 turns of undisturbed stalling, which means that anything with Life Orb, burn, poison, or Choice-locked into a low PP move will be forced to switch or die. Taunt is an excellent option over Protect, Toxic, or Earthquake, as without it this set is a sitting duck for Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress to set up on. Roost is an option worth considering as it gives Gliscor instant recovery, letting it wall certain threats far more reliably such as Terrakion and Rayquaza. Keep in mind though that Gliscor then loses its ability to scout, and will also lose its Flying typing for a turn. Taunt allows Gliscor to take on Chansey, Blissey, and Pokemon with healing moves attempting to heal off damage and poison. Unfortunately, removing any of the moves listed above for Taunt can pose severe problems to the set's overall effectiveness. The loss of Protect reduces Gliscor's healing capabilities and means that it can't scout as easily or PP and Toxic stall for 32 turns. Removing Earthquake leaves Gliscor vulnerable to being countered continually by any Steel- or Poison-type with Leftovers. Removing Toxic is also a bad idea, as even with Toxic Spikes up, Levitators, Flying-types, and Air Balloon users can all come in with impunity.</p> <p>Another option for the set is using 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature, as this allows Gliscor to take on Choice Scarf Zekrom far more easily, in addition to setting up on support Groudon variants with little to no trouble. However, the loss of that much Speed is not without its disadvantages.</p> <p>The beauty of Gliscor's Speed stat is that it outspeeds the common base 90 group, meaning that Gliscor can use Toxic as they break the Substitute, then set up another before they have the opportunity to move. Better yet, faster Pokemon that could prevent Gliscor from using Toxic before executing the Substitute and Protect chain, such as Palkia, Rayquaza, Mewtwo, Shaymin-S, and Darkrai, tend to carry Life Orb or Choice Scarf. Substitute allows Gliscor to scout the move that Choiced Pokemon use and either PP stall it to give itself yet another free turn or switch to the appropriate counter. Due to the fact that Life Orb incurs recoil if the user attacks a Substitute, Gliscor doesn't even need Toxic to inflict passive damage on Pokemon that use it. These Pokemon will often faint without even relieving Gliscor of its Substitute, which means that it can simply start the process all over again on the opponent's next Pokemon.</p> <p>As mentioned previously, this Gliscor variant handles almost any Groudon set extremely well, being immune to Earthquake and neutral to Fire Punch, Stone Edge, and Dragon Claw. For offensive versions, simply Toxic and then SubStall away. Support versions are even easier to deal with, as they typically lack the punch needed to break Gliscor's Substitute with Dragon Tail, and may have only the inaccurate and low PP Stone Edge to retaliate with. Support Groudon can easily provide Gliscor with several free Substitute opportunities throughout the game, each one often netting a KO. The standard Dragon Tail / Will-O-Wisp Giratina set provides equally good setup fodder, as Dragon Tail cannot break Gliscor's Substitute. Gliscor can also set up against Dragon Claw variants of Giratina-O, as Dragon Claw does only so-so damage and Draco Meteors are absorbed by the Substitute. Outrage variants are handled pretty easily as well, but Gliscor will take a good chunk of damage when Toxicing on an Outrage. Arceus-Ground, although relatively rare, is also a good Pokemon to switch in on.</p> <p>Gliscor can also do some other important things for your team. It is an excellent switch-in to U-turn because it is resistant to Bug, immune to Spikes, and can heal back HP and scout the opposing switch-in with Poison Heal and Protect. Gliscor's 12.5% passive recovery is also useful for taking on Leech Seed users such as Whimsicott and Jumpluff, as Leech Seed will do 0 net damage after Poison Heal recovery, meaning that Gliscor can switch around and easily waste Leech Seed PP. If your team is especially weak to Choice Specs Kyogre, you can use Gliscor's Substitute and Protect to stall Kyogre out of Water Spout PP.</p>"

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>This generation has been extremely kind to Mamoswine, and it is now endowed with a reliable Ice-type STAB attack: Icicle Crash. Icicle Crash and Earthquake score 2HKOes on nearly everything in the Uber tier, with the assistance of Stealth Rock. Mamoswine also has access to priority in the form of Ice Shard, which can be extremely useful in Ubers with the plethora of Dragon-types that run rampant. Mamoswine also has an ever-useful immunity to Electric-type attacks, which provides it with many opportunities to switch in. However, Mamoswine is not without its flaws. Its below-average Speed is its biggest downfall, and makes it a bit reliant on prediction. Mamoswine's typing makes it vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, which will wear it down quickly. It also is a bit frail by Ubers standards, and can't take many hits, if any, on the special side. Do not let these downfalls deter you from using Mamoswine; it can be a terror on the battlefield when used correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mamoswine doesn't really have many useful options that aren't already detailed above. You could use an Endeavor Lead set with Stealth Rock, Ice Shard, and a Focus Sash, but that's iffy at best. A Choice Band set can capitalize on Mamoswine's raw power, but it will rely even more heavily on prediction. Icicle Spear does more damage if it hits four times, and, in addition, it can break Substitutes; however, it is otherwise an unreliable method of causing damage. A set with Curse could be used, but Mamoswine would be demolished by basically every special attacker. Body Slam can let Mamoswine spread its own paralysis, but it's wasting its potential. Finally, Superpower would have its uses if not for the fact that it is illegal with Icicle Crash.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mamoswine is hard countered by Skarmory and Bronzong. It can't really run anything to break through them, so it will have to rely on teammates. Defensive Arceus that aren't weak to its STAB moves aren't 2HKOed with some investment, and can burn Mamoswine with Will-O-Wisp, taking away any chance it has of causing havoc. Manaphy can outspeed Mamoswine and OHKO it easily with Surf. It also isn't taken down by Earthquake + Ice Shard unless it invests next to nothing in its defenses and a significant amount of entry hazards are down. Entry hazards in general will wear down Mamoswine quite quickly in conjunction with Life Orb. Reshiram is another Pokemon that sends Mamoswine running, as it isn't weak to Ice Shard and can outspeed Mamoswine and OHKO it, however, it can't switch in directly for fear of Earthquake. A fast Kyogre is in a similar boat; it can easily OHKO Mamoswine with its STAB moves and resists Ice Shard, but it too will have trouble switching in directly. As long as it doesn't switch into Icicle Crash, Lugia can come in and set up Reflect on Mamoswine. It will still take a decent chunk of damage, but it can Roost away the wounds Mamoswine has inflicted upon it. If Giratina manages to switch in safely, it can burn Mamoswine, making it useless. Scizor can Bullet Punch Mamoswine into oblivion, and Mamoswine can't touch a Heatran with an Air Balloon. In general, Mamoswine is easily checked by faster Pokemon who aren't weak to Ice Shard.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Mamoswine is quite powerful, and has the ability to 2HKO basically everything in the tier, save for its two hard counters. A reliable physical Ice STAB is what really gives Mamoswine its niche, however, as it allows it to 2HKO common physical walls such as Giratina, Groudon, and Lugia with Stealth Rock support. Its other STAB is not forgotten though. Ground is an amazing STAB that lets Mamoswine send Steel-types that aren't immune to it running. Even Ferrothorn is 2HKOed by it, despite its great defensive prowess.</p> <p>Icicle Crash is really what gives Mamoswine its niche--not many Pokemon have a powerful physical Ice-type move. Earthquake is raw power, and can tear through most neutral targets that resist Icicle Crash. Ice Shard is a powerful, and extremely useful, priority move. In a tier where Dragon-type Pokemon run rampant, Ice Shard finds itself many uses. Ice Shard OHKOes Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Shaymin-S, and does a truckload to most Dragon-type Pokemon. The last slot is a bit of a filler, but it can be useful. Mamoswine will often cause an obvious switch, and you will need to predict what switches in to safely 2HKO it. Substitute can ease this kind of prediction and make Mamoswine's life easier, but it will make Mamoswine die even faster to hazards and Life Orb recoil. Stealth Rock can go in the final slot if your team is desperate for a Stealth Rock user, but there are far better users of the move.</p> <p>Here are some calculations to show just how powerful Mamoswine is, and show how much it appreciates Stealth Rock:</p> <ul> <li>Icicle Crash vs. 252/252+ Groudon 55.4% - 65.8%</li> <li>Icicle Crash vs. 252/252+ Lugia 56.7% - 67.8%</li> <li>Ice Shard vs. 252/252+ Lugia 27.4% - 32.2%</li> <li>Icicle Crash vs. 248/248+ Giratina 50.5% - 59.6%</li> <li>Icicle Crash vs. 0/0 Giratina-O 90.2% - 106.6%</li> <li>Icicle Crash vs. 248/0 Ho-Oh 52% - 61.7%</li> <li>Earthquake vs. 252/0 Dialga 98.5% - 116.3%</li> <li>Earthquake vs. 252/0 +1 Dialga 65.8% - 77.7%</li> <li>Earthquake vs. 4/0 Kyogre 74.6% - 88%</li> <li>Ice Shard vs. 4/0 Kyogre 14.9% - 17.5%</li> <li>Earthquake vs. 252/0 Arceus-Steel 89.6% - 105.9%</li> <li>Earthquake vs. 252/0 Ferrothorn 52.8% - 62.2%</li> <li>Ice Shard vs. 4/0 Rayquaza 115.9% - 137.5%</li> <li>Ice Shard vs. 4/0 Garchomp 110.6% - 130.7%</li> <li>Ice Shard vs. 4/0 Shaymin-S 138% - 164.9%</li> </ul> <p>As you can see, Stealth Rock is necessary to secure a few important KOs. Mamoswine is not that reliable of a Stealth Rock user, so it is wise to carry one, such as Dialga or Groudon. It may seem odd to use Adamant and max Speed, but both are necessary. The max Speed allows it to outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon that do not invest heavily. If they do invest heavily, they will likely use a Speed-boosting nature, in which case Jolly would not help anyways. Adamant's power is also necessary to score key 2HKOes against defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn. It may be tempting to use Expert Belt to lessen the passive damage Mamoswine takes, but it really needs that extra power, especially against Pokemon like the aforementioned Ferrothorn, where it has to rely on raw power to muscle through. Stone Edge may be a bit tempting to use, but notice the Icicle Crash calculation vs. Ho-Oh--it is most likely dying, making Stone Edge highly unnecessary. Paralysis support is also something to consider when using Mamoswine, as it is on the slow side, so luring in and paralyzing the Pokemon that can cause it trouble can really give it the edge to push through the opposing team. Kyogre, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn all excel in spreading paralysis.</p> <p>Zekrom makes a great partner to Mamoswine, as it can decimate Pokemon like Skarmory, Kyogre, and Bronzong that would otherwise give Mamoswine a hard time. Mamoswine can also take down Groudon for Zekrom while it resists a good portion of Mamoswine's weaknesses, giving it something to switch in on. When using Mamoswine, it is good to have Pokemon that can switch into the likes of Kyogre. Palkia fits the bill, and can also, depending on the weather, incinerate and electrify Skarmory and Bronzong. Mamoswine can also use teammates that lure Electric-type attacks for it to switch in on. Kyogre is one of such Pokemon, and it can also drown Skarmory and Bronzong with Surf or Water Spout. If you really hate the oft-repeated Steel-type duo that give Mamoswine trouble, you can use Magnezone to send them packing. Finally, a teammate with Rapid Spin can help Mamoswine, as it is vulnerable to all forms of hazards. Forretress and Tentacruel are examples of Pokemon that can work well in Ubers and provide Rapid Spin support, in addition to other useful support options.</p>"

  "Froslass": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Froslass seems outclassed by Deoxys-S, it has a few traits that differentiate it from the cosmic biped. Firstly, Froslass is the only Pokemon in the game that can both spinblock and use Spikes. Secondly, Froslass is immune to Extreme Speed, the most common priority move in the tier. This allows it to almost always get two turns against slower opponents--of which there are many, thanks to Froslass's base 110 Speed stat. Lastly, Froslass's ability, Cursed Body, allows it to disable moves from Choice Pokemon and render mono-attackers useless. However, Froslass is still extraordinarily frail and weak, suffering the dilemma of having to choose between using Taunt or setting up hazards; the wrong choice can let an opponent knock it out or set up on it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Froslass can use Thunder Wave to potentially catch Choice Scarf users trying to get a quick 2HKO on it. Toxic can also be used to catch Giratina-O and Lugia off-guard; however, Thunder Wave can hit a much larger range of targets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Froslass is actually fairly difficult to stop from doing its job. Darkrai is undoubtedly the best way to handle Froslass, as it outspeeds the icy lady and incapacitates her with Dark Void. Darkrai can also set up a Substitute with little risk on predicted switches. Tyranitar also beats Froslass reliably, as Crunch will bring it down to its Focus Sash and sandstorm damage will finish it off on the same turn. Giratina-O can also swiftly 2HKO Froslass with Shadow Sneak and limit it to only one layer of Spikes. Espeon can switch into Froslass if it's not using Shadow Ball and reflect Spikes and Taunt with Magic Bounce, which renders Froslass useless. Although rare, a lead Cloyster can bypass Focus Sash with Rock Blast and OHKO Froslass.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>This is the only set Froslass should ever use. Spikes and Taunt are non-negotiable; Spikes is the crux of the set, as the ability to deal indirect damage to the grounded Pokemon in Ubers is an amazing asset to any team. Taunt prevents a multitude of dangerous Pokemon from setting up, and stops others from laying entry hazards. This set also functions as a decent anti-lead, as getting off one layer of hazards and using Taunt against the opposing lead is quite a likely scenario. The combination of Icy Wind and Shadow Ball can be used to 2HKO Deoxys-S. Ice Beam can be used to 2HKO Groudon and OHKO Rayquaza; however, against Rayquaza, Froslass should first use Spikes and then Icy Wind, as it 2HKOes Rayquaza if it decides to use Dragon Dance. If Rayquaza decides to attack right off the bat, at least it won't be able to boost its Speed. Destiny Bond can prove fatally annoying for the opponent; with a layer of Spikes down, Froslass can use Destiny Bond for up to eight turns, all whilst the opponent switches around trying to find a way to KO Froslass. Taunt should be used against slower Pokemon to prevent them from using Toxic or Will-O-Wisp to break Froslass's Focus Sash. Destiny Bond is also useful to revenge kill Extreme Killer Arceus without a Speed-boosting nature if Deoxys-S is not a concern.</p> <p>The Special Attack EVs are needed to get the aforementioned 2HKOs and OHKOs. Maximum Speed is needed to outspeed Terrakion and Speed-creeping Arceus; investing in bulk doesn't help Froslass survive anything.</p> <p>Leads are said to be non-existent in BW. However, with the fall in usage of Scizor in Ubers, Froslass can lead more often than not. The only semi-common leads Froslass should avoid are Tyranitar and Darkrai. A fast Groudon with Stealth Rock and an auxiliary Fire-type move makes a good partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock, outspeed and OHKO all Ubers spinners, and deal with Tyranitar. Froslass needs another sturdy Ghost-type team mate to spinblock after it inevitably bites the dust; Giratina-O is a good candidate, as it works very well on sun teams. A Choice Scarf Genesect can lead against Darkrai and bring it down to its Focus Sash or outright KO it with U-turn. If another Pokemon comes in to absorb U-turn, it is more than likely Froslass can then come in and do its job.</p>"

  "Dialga": {
    "overview": "<p>Dialga's unique typing and well-distributed stats allow it to fit into most teams. On the offensive side, Dialga has stunning base 120 Attack and base 150 Special Attack stats that are backed by the ever-dominant Dragon-type STAB. Defensively, Dialga's typing offers it nine resistances and an immunity, as well as a lack of weaknesses to Ice- and Dragon-type moves. With its stellar base defenses combined with its resistances and excellent support movepool, it is no wonder that Dialga is widely regarded as one of the most versatile Pokemon in Ubers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dialga has a wide movepool and hence a variety of other options. Psych Up allows Dialga to copy stat boosts from Calm Mind Kyogre and Arceus. Flash Cannon is a decent auxiliary STAB attack, but Steel is a poor offensive type. Choice Specs Ice Beam allows Dialga to OHKO Groudon without resorting to Draco Meteor or Overheat, but it is otherwise a generally poor choice. Iron Head can surprise Tyranitar and Calm Mind Arceus-Rock but is rather useless otherwise. A Choice Band set could work, but it is outclassed by Zekrom, which has STAB Electric-type attacks at its disposal to break through Lugia. Dialga's typing gives it a niche as a Choice Band user, though.</p> <p>Magnet Rise can be a good option on some Dialga sets, as it can foil Dialga's arch-enemy, Groudon. If you opt to run Bulk Up alongside Magnet Rise, then use an EV spread of 116 HP / 252 Atk / 140 Spe; this allows Dialga to use Bulk Up as Groudon switches in, use Magnet Rise before most Groudon can move, and then either hit the next switch-in hard with Outrage or Earthquake or use Bulk Up again. However, this is not recommended, as Groudon can use Dragon Tail to force Dialga out. Air Balloon keeps Dialga safe from Ground-type moves for a turn and lets it avoid Spikes; it might be viable on the mixed set. The power loss is significant, though.</p> <p>Fully defensive EV spreads are usable, but other Pokemon outclass Dialga as walls. Groudon, Skarmory, Wallceus, and Lugia outclass it as physical walls, while Blissey and Chansey are better special walls. Dialga's main strength lies its ability to take a hit or two and strike back hard, not to sponge attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Dialga is ridiculously hard to counter in the strictest sense due to its versatility, wide coverage, and enormous offensive stats. Calm Mind Arceus-Rock in the sand is probably the best counter to offensive Dialga; it can sponge special attacks relatively easily while racking up Calm Mind boosts and can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple mixed variants. However, it is rather useless against defensive variants. The Bulk Up + RestTalk set can easily boost up, Rest off damage, and take out Arceus-Rock with Outrage, while support Dialga that carry Toxic can simply cripple Arceus-Rock unless it has Refresh. Calm Mind Arceus-Steel also counters Dialga in rain fairly well, but it needs to watch out for Choice Specs-boosted Aura Sphere, which is an easy 2HKO. Blissey and Chansey can take on all purely special attacking variants. Tyranitar can take on most special attacking Dialga, provided they don't carry Aura Sphere. In the sun, Ho-Oh can take most attacks from Dialga and roast it with Sacred Fire. It does need to watch out for Outrage, though. While Lugia cannot do much to Dialga, Dialga cannot hurt Lugia much in return if it lacks Thunder.</p> <p>In general, specially bulky Steel-types are good checks to Dialga. If rain is up, Jirachi can take most attacks that Dialga dishes out, with the exception of Choice Specs Fire Blast or the rare Earth Power or Earthquake on the mixed set. In the sun, Heatran defeats all variants of Dialga that lack Aura Sphere, Brick Break, Earth Power, or Earthquake, as it can either 3HKO with Flamethrower or use Taunt to shut down Bulk Up variants.</p> <p>Outside of the listed Pokemon, prediction and preying on its low Speed are the main ways to defeat Dialga. As bulky as Dialga is, it cannot stand up to powerful super effective STAB attacks, including Earthquake from Groudon, Garchomp, Arceus-Ground, and Excadrill, Close Combat from Terrakion and Lucario, and Judgment from Arceus-Ground and -Fighting. Be aware, however, that all of these attackers--with the exception of Groudon--require a boosting item to OHKO Dialga that invest in bulk. Apart from Garchomp, all of them have the ability to take on Bulk Up RestTalk Dialga as well. Offensive Groudon and Arceus-Ground can either use Swords Dance and Earthquake to decimate Dialga or simply wear it down with repeated Earthquakes. Excadrill and Lucario boast a resistance to Outrage and can use Swords Dance and then their respective STAB attacks to defeat Dialga. Terrakion requires Sacred Sword to be able to take down Bulk Up Dialga. In the sun, Choice Specs Reshiram will always be able to OHKO Dialga with Blue Flare, although it cannot switch into Dialga easily.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Dialga is one of the very few Dragon-types that can take a support route; it is especially useful as a bulky all-around pivot. As very few Pokemon can outright OHKO Dialga, it can easily switch into an opposing Pokemon and set up Stealth Rock or just start dishing out damage. Draco Meteor packs a strong immediate punch, but if you prefer PP and consistency, Dragon Pulse is an excellent alternative STAB move. Notably, Draco Meteor allows Dialga to severely damage Groudon, as well as OHKO Reshiram and Palkia without Stealth Rock. Fire Blast rounds out the coverage; in particular, it 2HKOes most Groudon in the sun and Ferrothorn in the rain. Roar lets Dialga force switches, but if you want Dialga to phaze through Taunt instead of Substitute, Dragon Tail is a fine alternative. Thunder works best alongside Kyogre, as its Drizzle ability remedies Thunder's poor accuracy.</p> <p>The given EVs ensure that Dialga is not 2HKOed by Palkia's Lustrous Orb-boosted Spacial Rend or by non-Choice Specs Kyogre's full-power Water Spout. The Special Attack EVs and Modest nature allow Dialga to OHKO Darkrai with Draco Meteor and to 2HKO most Kyogre and some Ho-Oh with Thunder. Lum Berry prevents Dialga from being put to sleep by Darkrai leads; Dialga can then severely cripple them with Thunder Wave or OHKO them with Draco Meteor. Dialga can use Toxic in the last slot to cripple walls such as Lugia, while Thunder Wave helps Dialga's offensive teammates take advantage of slower opponents.</p> <p>Dialga appreciates the residual damage from Spikes and Toxic Spikes that defensive teams can provide, as it can easily shuffle opposing Pokemon around with Roar or Dragon Tail. Tentacruel can set up Toxic Spikes, while Forretress can set up both Spikes and Toxic Spikes. However, relying on Forretress to lay down that many hazards puts it under a lot of stress. Lead Deoxys-S is a good choice to set up Spikes right off the bat, and it can even forgo Stealth Rock if Dialga opts to use it. Skarmory is an excellent partner, as it can lay Spikes, completely walls Groudon barring the rare Overheat or Fire Punch, has access to a recovery move, and can use Whirlwind to force switches. Ferrothorn can switch into most Kyogre variants and set up Spikes easily. With entry hazards taken into account, Dialga needs a teammate that can block Rapid Spin. Giratina, Giratina-O, and Arceus-Ghost are the best Pokemon for the job. Giratina and Giratina-O share great type synergy with Dialga thanks to their immunity to both Ground- and Fighting-type attacks; both check Groudon as well. Dialga also resists the Dark- and Ghost-type attacks they are weak to.</p> <p>In addition to hazards support, offensive teams tend to appreciate Toxic or Thunder Wave support from Dialga. Swords Dance variants of Groudon, Terrakion, and Garchomp, as well as Rayquaza, Mewtwo, and Darkrai, all appreciate opposing Choice Scarf users being paralyzed, while a Toxic-poisoned Lugia will find it difficult to wall Rock Polish Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus. Finally, offensive Groudon appreciates Dialga's ability to batter many of its checks, such as Skarmory and Giratina.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Dialga's typing and enormous base 150 Special Attack just scream for the user to slap Choice Specs on it and click Draco Meteor whenever possible. Indeed, with its excellent bulk and typing, Dialga is the cream of the crop when it comes to the many Draco Meteor-spamming Dragon-types in the game. Draco Meteor is easily Dialga's best STAB move, and it completely decimates anything that doesn't resist it. To illustrate, it deals at least 85% to defensive Dialga. Thunder easily OHKOes Kyogre that do not invest in Special Defense, while both Fire Blast and Aura Sphere help Dialga swat aside Steel-types. Fire Blast has a chance to OHKO Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock damage even in rain, while Aura Sphere allows Dialga to 2HKO Heatran and OHKO Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. Dragon Pulse rounds out the set as a reliable STAB move.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Dialga to take advantage of its excellent bulk to repeatedly switch in and dish out the pain, but an alternative spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe is perfectly usable. Earth Power can OHKO Heatran, but Aura Sphere easily 2HKOes it anyway. Thunderbolt can be used in sunny weather to strike down Ho-Oh, as can Power Gem, but it is comfortably 2HKOed by Draco Meteor anyway. Choice Specs provides the power that makes this set so threatening, but if its locking effect is not appealing, Dialga can use a Life Orb as an alternative item to power up its attacks. If using Life Orb, Stealth Rock is an option in the last slot so that Dialga can act as an offensive lead. Be aware that if you're looking for a bulky attacker, Choice Specs is definitely the better option. On the other hand, a Timid nature with maximum Speed is usable if you want Dialga to Speed tie with all base 90 Pokemon.</p> <p>Blissey and Chansey are the only surefire counters to Choice Specs Dialga, as Dialga lacks any reliable way of KOing the pink blobs. Arceus-Rock in sand can take a Draco Meteor--although it still won't enjoy it--and use Recover to heal off the damage. Otherwise, one will have to rely on prediction to prevent a switch-in from becoming horribly mutilated by one of Dialga's attacks. Dialga's low Speed also makes it rather susceptible to faster revenge killers packing super effective moves. Finally, the Special Attack drop Draco Meteor causes allows bulky threats such as Arceus to set up easily. Therefore, Terrakion is a good partner, as it easily scares away Blissey and Chansey, while Arceus-Rock will not enjoy taking it on either. Excadrill is also a good teammate, as it easily outspeeds Arceus-Rock in a sandstorm and buries it with its powerful Earthquake. While not sweeping in sandstorm, Excadrill is a good spinner for rain teams, which Dialga also thrives in as rain makes Thunder 100% accurate. As Dialga is weak to Fighting- and Ground-type moves, Giratina-O is an excellent partner due to its immunity to both types; as a bonus, it can also block Rapid Spin. Lugia is another defensive Pokemon that can easily switch into attacks targeted at Dialga, while Dialga has no problem switching into Thunders directed at Lugia.</p> <p>Dialga's powerful wallbreaking abilities attract two other kinds of teammates, namely entry hazard setters and cleaners. With entry hazards, Dialga finds it a lot easier to break down walls. Deoxys-S is possibly the best entry hazard layer for offensive teams, while Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress can use their bulk to set up Spikes and Stealth Rock for more balanced ones. As Dialga's main attack is its Dragon STAB, it tends to lure in Steel-types and damage them heavily. This makes sweepers such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Rayquaza, Arceus-Dragon, Choice Scarf Salamence, and Garchomp much more dangerous.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed": {
        "description": "<p>Dialga's monstrous Special Attack often eclipses its deceptively dangerous base 120 Attack. With significant EV investment in both Attack and Special Attack, as well as ridiculously powerful coverage moves, it is no wonder that Dialga is one of the most difficult Pokemon to wall in the entire game. With a Life Orb equipped, Draco Meteor from 438 Special Attack will quickly crush all but pink blobs and specially defensive Steel-types. The former Pokemon can easily be defeated by Dialga's physical move of choice; both Outrage and Brick Break can 2HKO most Blissey and Chansey after Stealth Rock damage. Outrage is preferred due to its superior power and coverage, but Brick Break can be used if you do not like locking Dialga in; it also boasts the ability to hit Heatran for super effective damage. Fire Blast absolutely annihilates most Steel-types, but it does come at the price of being nerfed in rain.</p> <p>Thunder can be used in the final slot to hit Steel-types and is extremely useful in the rain to smash down Kyogre. However, Bulk Up opens up many opportunities for Dialga; not only does it allow Dialga to become progressively more dangerous, but it can also be used to lure in certain threats, such as Groudon, which is the best counter to defensive Bulk Up Dialga. Groudon will readily switch into Dialga after it uses Bulk Up, only to be met with a Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor, which will OHKO any Groudon that don't significantly invest in Special Defense and severely cripple even those that do. Bulk Up also allows Dialga to comfortably tank an unboosted Garchomp's Earthquake and OHKO in return with its Dragon-type STAB attack.</p> <p>There are many ways to EV mixed Dialga, and your pick should depend on your team. The spread listed above allows Dialga to hit extremely hard both physically and specially. With maximum Attack investment, Dialga can 2HKO most Blissey and Chansey with Outrage or Brick Break, as well as OHKOing 252/0 Kyogre and Ho-Oh with Outrage. Dialga can also invest in Speed; a Hasty nature and 192 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed neutral base 95s, most notably Adamant Swords Dance Rayquaza. Keep in mind, however, that most Rayquaza run a Speed-boosting nature. Dialga can even run a spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Hasty nature to Speed tie with all base 90 Pokemon. On the other hand, Dialga can drop its Speed to the absolute minimum with a spread of 120 HP / 136 Atk / 252 SpA and a Quiet nature; such a spread allows it to survive attacks such as Choice Scarf Garchomp's Earthquake and Life Orb Mewtwo's Aura Sphere and OHKO in return with Draco Meteor. Quiet Dialga is also usable on a Trick Room team and can even forgo its last move to set up the field effect itself. Another thing to consider when running Trick Room Dialga is to lower its level to 99; this allows Dialga to outspeed uninvested Scizor in Trick Room.</p> <p>It is also worthy to note that Dialga is probably the best Shell Smash recipient in the game. It resists all forms of priority aside from the rare Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch and is also immune to Toxic Spikes. Should Dialga be a designated SmashPass recipient, it should fully maximize its Speed to outrun virtually everything. Gorebyss, Smeargle, and the rarer Huntail are the only Pokemon that can pass Shell Smash, but all three can do it admirably. Should Dialga receive a Shell Smash safely, your opponent should start praying to a deity for divine intervention, because not even Arceus will be able to stop it.</p> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item as it allows Dialga to hit as hard as possible while keeping the ability to switch moves. Quiet Dialga can also consider Expert Belt, as it helps preserve Dialga's bulk while still allowing it to break the walls it is supposed to. An Adamant Orb can be used to bluff a Choice item, while Leftovers can help Dialga survive for even longer. Other moves, however, are generally outclassed by the options listed. Dragon Tail allows Dialga to shuffle switch-ins and is rather effective with multiple layers of entry hazards. Earthquake is a decent fourth move, as it allows Dialga to 2HKO Jirachi and OHKO Heatran; the latter can be OHKOed by Earth Power too. If your team really hates Ho-Oh, Stone Edge and Power Gem are options to clip the phoenix's wings. Again, Stealth Rock is always an option should nothing else on your team be able to set it up, but it is a big waste of Dialga's talents.</p> <p>As with all wallbreakers, Dialga appreciates entry hazard support. Deoxys-S is the premier offensive Spikes setter, while Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress work very well on more balanced teams. Giratina-O easily blocks Rapid Spin and switches into attacks super effective on Dialga, while ChestoRest Giratina can spinblock while remaining a dangerous threat. As for sweepers, those that can take advantage of the holes that Dialga punches make good teammates. Extreme Killer Arceus, Rayquaza, Arceus-Dragon, Choice Scarf Salamence, and Garchomp can all take advantage of the ravaging of Steel-types. Sweepers that synergize well with Dialga are fine choices too; Mewtwo resists Fighting-type attacks, while Flying-types such as the aforementioned Rayquaza can easily capitalize on incoming Ground-type attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up + RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Dialga's numerous resistances, well-distributed defensive stats, great neutral STAB coverage, and access to Bulk Up. By boosting its Attack and Defense, Dialga can power up its attacks while increasing its physical bulk. After Dialga manages to set up Bulk Up, it can be almost impenetrable on the physical side. For example, it can easily survive a Choice Band Close Combat from Terrakion and OHKO with +1 Outrage. Rest lets a weakened Dialga heal itself, while Sleep Talk enables it to remain threatening. The RestTalk combination also allows Dialga to absorb Dark Void from Darkrai. Outrage gives Dialga more power but locks Dialga in when it is used, except when selected by Sleep Talk; alternatively, Dragon Claw can be used if you want reliability instead of more PP and power.</p> <p>As Dialga will be boosting its Defense via Bulk Up, maximum Special Defense helps it cushion most special attacks. Dragon Tail can be used with entry hazard support, but it is generally an inferior option as it is quite weak. Furthermore, some phazers outspeed Dialga anyway, which makes it useless. Dialga can, however, run 164 Spe EVs to outspeed uninvested Lugia. In particular, a set of Bulk Up, Dragon Tail, Earthquake, and Substitute, along with entry hazard support, puts lots of pressure on stall teams that use phazing as their main way of dealing with Bulk Up Dialga.</p> <p>As sturdy as Bulk Up Dialga might be, there are still Pokemon that can break through its defenses. Groudon can easily set up alongside Dialga with Bulk Up or Swords Dance and smash it with Earthquake; Arceus-Ground can do a similar job with Calm Mind. Excadrill and Lucario both resist Outrage, can set up Swords Dance, and OHKO +1 Dialga with Earthquake and Close Combat, respectively. Sacred Sword Terrakion can 2HKO Dialga irrespective of its Defense boosts, while Outrage cannot OHKO Terrakion without Defense drops. On the special side, Reshiram OHKOes with sun- and Choice Specs-boosted Blue Flare. Arceus-Fighting can boost up with Calm Mind, take relatively little from Outrage, and 2HKO with Judgment. Heatran can use Taunt to stop Dialga from setting up or recovering and 3HKO with Flamethrower. Skarmory and Lugia can both phaze Dialga, although they cannot stop it if Dialga is the last Pokemon. Therefore, Giratina, Giratina-O, and Kyogre are excellent teammates to run alongside Dialga due to their ability to defeat these Pokemon. Arceus-Water is also a good teammate to Dialga, as it can easily take on Heatran and Reshiram and is bulky enough to deal with Lucario, Excadrill, and Terrakion.</p> <p>Phazers are also significant threats to Bulk Up Dialga. As Dialga has no Attack investment, it is quite weak initially. Skarmory and Lugia have absolutely no problems forcing Dialga out with Whirlwind or Dragon Tail, unless Dialga itself is running Dragon Tail, in which case Skarmory will be forced out first. Groudon and Hippowdon take little from Outrage and can Roar Dialga out as well. Various Arceus formes, such as Arceus-Steel, have no problems taking on and phazing out Dialga. It should be noted, however, that should Dialga be the last Pokemon, it cannot be forced out, and any team lacking a win condition will be in trouble. Perish Song is probably the best win condition, as it ensures that Dialga is KOed in three turns; its most common user is defensive Arceus. Tricking Dialga a Choice Scarf also effectively neuters it; Darkrai and Mewtwo are effective users of this strategy.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Dialga's lackluster Speed can be fixed with a Choice Scarf, which allows it to reach 400 Speed. While faster Dragon-types such as Palkia and Salamence exist, Dialga's main attraction is its typing. Its resistance to Extreme Speed allows it to check Swords Dance Rayquaza and weakened Extreme Killer Arceus, though keep in mind that Draco Meteor cannot KO a healthy Arceus, and if Arceus has Recover, Dialga loses. It is also one of the revenge killers to Tail Glow Manaphy; offensive sets are OHKOed by Thunder, while bulkier ones fail to OHKO Dialga in return. Draco Meteor is the primary attack, as with Stealth Rock in play, it easily OHKOes Darkrai, Reshiram, Zekrom, Rayquaza, Arceus-Dragon, Garchomp, and unboosted Mewtwo. Thunder 2HKOes Lugia and Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock and inflicts severe damage on Kyogre. Fire Blast prevents Steel-types from switching in freely, while Aura Sphere nails Heatran and Tyranitar for super effective damage. Lastly, Dragon Pulse gives Dialga a way of dealing consistent damage.</p> <p>A Modest nature is preferred so that Dialga is strong enough to revenge kill the threats it should defeat. The Speed EVs allow Dialga to outspeed neutral-natured Deoxys-A. The advantage of outspeeding Adamant Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Naive Deoxys-A might be lost, but Rayquaza generally runs a Speed-boosting nature anyway, while Deoxys-A tends to run a Rash nature. Nonetheless, Dialga can use a Timid nature and maximum Speed if outspeeding all Deoxys-A is critical; in addition, maximum Speed Dialga Speed ties with all Choice Scarf base 90s. In terms of other options, Outrage can be run in the last slot to 2HKO non-defensive variants of Calm Mind Kyogre, as well as to 2HKO Blissey after some prior damage.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Dialga might be faster than most Pokemon, but it does lose to other Choice Scarf users, such as Palkia, Garchomp, Terrakion, and Darkrai, as well as Dragon Dance Rayquaza. Groudon can handle Garchomp, Terrakion, and Rayquaza most of the time, but it can be worn down due to its lack of recovery. Scizor can switch into Darkrai safely and OHKO it with U-turn or deal major damage with Bullet Punch; if Sleep Clause is activated, various Arceus formes can easily set up on it. Finally, be very cautious of Wobbuffet, as it can easily revenge kill Choice-locked Dialga.</p> <p>Blissey and Chansey don't fear anything from this set. Lugia and Ho-Oh are both problematic if rain is not up, as is opposing defensive Dialga. Ferrothorn can take any attack not named Fire Blast and set up Spikes or use Leech Seed. Defensive Arceus and Groudon can take any attack; the latter can subsequently OHKO Dialga with Earthquake. Kyogre can check defensive Arceus, Ho-Oh, Lugia, and Groudon with its powerful Water-type strikes, Giratina-O can handle Groudon and set up on opponents locked into Fighting- or Ground-type moves, while Lugia covers Dialga's weaknesses and checks Choice Scarf Palkia, Choice Scarf Garchomp, and Dragon Dance Rayquaza.</p>"

  "Palkia": {
    "overview": "<p>Palkia is a dick. That isn't just a reference to its phallic appearance—Palkia is one of the most dangerous offensive threats in the metagame and often poses problems for nearly every team archetype. This comes from its ability to cough up a powerful STAB Surf or Hydro Pump, which can be reinforced by the presence of rain and supported by its signature Dragon-type STAB, Spacial Rend, as well as its many other coverage move options. It also has a key base 100 Speed that the many Ubers Pokemon sitting at base 90 or 95 Speed lust for. All these traits make it extremely difficult to block Palkia without resorting to the likes of Chansey or Arceus-Grass. Palkia is also notable for its ability to stand erect in front of the mighty Kyogre's Choice Specs Water Spout, making it one of the few safe switch-ins to the king of Ubers. Palkia comes in all shapes and sizes ranging from its special attacking Lustrous Orb set to its Choice Specs and Choice Scarf variants. It also functions well under any weather condition, making it extremely easy to insert into a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>For the more unfortunate, Dragon Pulse doesn't risk the miss that Spacial Rend does but it is significantly weaker and the chance of missing with Spacial Rend is very small. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple a Calm Mind Arceus attempting to set up on you or an Arceus-Grass switch-in. Blizzard is a very inaccurate way to 2HKO Arceus-Grass. Thunderbolt and Flamethrower might seem appealing due to their consistency, but their damage output is so underwhelming that you should never actually use them over Thunder and Fire Blast. Likewise, Ice Beam is an extremely ineffective move, more so when you consider that you can use the mediocre Blizzard to actually accomplish something in its place. Physical Palkia sets like Choice Band and physical mixed have the appeal of beating typical Palkia counters, most notably Chansey, but those counters are already very limited and a simple change in the final move on the all-out attacker set accomplishes the same thing. Furthermore, in exchange for bypassing Chansey, these physical sets add more checks and counters to the list, such as the dreaded Ferrothorn. Palkia doesn't have many options to boost its stats beyond Bulk Up and Absorb Bulb. Bulk Up suffers from the same problems as the other physical sets except that Palkia has even less coverage moves, which further increases its number of checks and counters. Absorb Bulb is an interesting way to increase Palkia's Special Attack when switching into Kyogre's Water Spout or Surf, but it suffers from being single use and from robbing you of a more consistent item like Lustrous Orb.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Arceus-Grass under rain, Chansey, and Blissey are the three biggest counters to Palkia. Thanks to its resistance to Water-type attacks and meaty natural bulk, only Spacial Rend from the Choice Specs set has a chance of beating Arceus-Grass, but even that does not beat the support set if it fails to land a critical hit during the Recover stall before running out of its meager 8 PP or missing. A Calm Mind variant with a bit of Special Defense investment will easily beat even Choice Specs Palkia. The faster Speed also helps as it makes it harder for Palkia to use Dragon Tail in order to weaken Arceus-Grass enough to not have the health to switch in. However, Arceus-Grass will not be able to beat Palkia outside of the rain as Fire Blast will overwhelm it. Chansey and Blissey have such an absurd amount of special bulk that they can easily shrug off any of Palkia's special attacks regardless of the weather. Even a Choice Specs rain-boosted Hydro Pump will fail to 2HKO without Stealth Rock plus a layer of Spikes being up on the field. However, they do have to be wary of Palkia running Aqua Tail with Lustrous Orb, as their Defense, especially for Blissey, isn't nearly as gigantic as their Special Defense. Their lower Speed also leaves them vulnerable to Dragon Tail as they won't be able to use Soft-Boiled before being hit by one of Palkia's attacks.</p> <p>Changing the weather will allow more threats to counter Palkia. If the weather is sunny, just about any bulky Arceus forme will work well. Even Arceus-Rock could beat Palkia as the sun would remove his Water-type weakness. Deoxys-D also works very well under the sun as long as Palkia isn't equipped with a Choice Specs. If Stealth Rock isn't up, Ho-Oh can take on Palkia very well thanks to the sun removing his Water-type weakness and crippling the accuracy of Thunder. When a sandstorm is raging, there are less options for bulky Arceus formes that counter Palkia as it maintains an unharmed Water-type STAB. Also, the extra residual damage from the sandstorm will put 252 HP Arceus in 2HKO range from a Lustrous Orb-boosted Spacial Rend. However, a minor amount of Special Defense investment remedies this issue. Deoxys-D, however, remains just as effective under a sandstorm as under sunny weather.</p> <p>There remains a few more situational checks to Palkia. Gastrodon can survive two Spacial Rends from Lustrous Orb variants, but it does this with such little health remaining that it only takes a single Dragon Tail for Palkia to be able to play around it. Ludicolo is in the same boat, but at least it can hit Palkia with Leech Seed before being forced right back out by Dragon Tail. Latias can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Palkia and can even survive a Lustrous Orb-boosted Spacial Rend if healthy enough. Once in, she can easily OHKO Palkia with her Dragon-type STAB. Even Haban Berry Palkia risks being OHKOed after Stealth Rock by Draco Meteor if Latias runs enough Special Attack investment. Defensive Dialga can switch in once on the Lustrous Orb set but will lose outright to Haban Berry and Choice Specs variants. Specially defensive Kyogre can check Palkia if it lacks Thunder or fails to predict properly in the case of Choice Specs Palkia. Ferrothorn under rain is a pest to Choice Scarf Palkia and can beat Lustrous Orb variants if it manages to avoid switching into Fire Blast.</p> <p>To scratch the bottom of the barrel, you can use faster Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Latios if you manage to bring them in with excellent prediction or after Palkia knocks something out. Haban Berry Palkia excels at luring these types of response out and punishing them, so be careful or use very powerful Dragon-type attacks like Latios's Draco Meteor. If Palkia lacks Dragon Tail or fails to paralyze with Thunder, Calm Mind Arceus formes can set up on it once safely in. Wobbuffet, and to a lesser extent, Tyranitar, can trap Choice Scarf and Choice Specs Palkia locked into a weaker coverage move. Using a Dragon-type with Haban Berry is another way to beat Palkia one-on-one.</p> <p>In general, the best way to handle Palkia is to just deny it as many free turns as possible. By filling your team with faster threats or bulky ones that can beat it one-on-one as well as checks like Dialga and Latias, you can minimize the amount of damage Palkia does to your team.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>All-out attacker Palkia is gifted with the right amount of power and coverage to be able to 2HKO nearly the entire metagame without having to resort to a Choice Specs set. This makes it extremely effective at tearing apart defensive cores as it requires little to no prediction. The freedom to change attacks allows it to maintain momentum and avoid becoming setup fodder. The versatility this set offers also helps to make it unpredictable, further complicating the process of checking it.</p> <p>Spacial Rend is a reliable Dragon-type STAB and its ability to easily topple specially defensive Dragon-types like Giratina is what separates Palkia from other powerful Water-type special attackers. STAB Surf complements Spacial Rend excellently and is absurdly powerful under the rain, capable of 2HKOing bulky Arceus formes. Hydro Pump can be used in its place to secure more OHKOs than Surf; however, the inaccuracy is off-putting, and a rain-boosted Surf already 2HKOes everything you would use Hydro Pump for. Fire Blast is extremely important for 2HKOing Ferrothorn under rain and punishes Arceus-Grass outside of rain. Thunder is a solid option for the last slot as it allows Palkia to fully fill its common role of checking Kyogre. However, Dragon Tail is very useful for preventing Calm Mind Arceus formes from setting up on Palkia and, with entry hazard support, is effective at wearing down Palkia's few checks, making it the superior choice for teams that aren't quite as concerned with Kyogre. Keep in mind that specially defensive Kyogre becomes quite a nuisance to Palkia if it does decide to pass on Thunder.</p> <p>Lustrous Orb allows Palkia to OHKO Forretress with Surf after Stealth Rock as well as give a significant boost to Palkia's main STABs for general purposes. As Palkia's sole weakness is to Dragon-type attacks, Haban Berry allows Palkia to be an effective lure although at the price of power. Leftovers is another item choice that helps Palkia check Choice Scarf and defensive Kyogre more effectively; however, it misses out on the same power Haban Berry does. For those that dislike paralysis or burn from Kyogre's Thunder or Scald, Lum Berry is useful to keep Palkia in good condition. However, this is a one-time solution to a side effect of an already painful Thunder or a surely recurring burn from the long-lasting defensive Kyogre, making the loss in damage output all the more bothersome. Lastly, an Expert Belt can be used for those who would like to favor Palkia's super effective coverage options; however, its main STABs lose their consistent boost in power.</p> <p>Palkia can use Aqua Tail with a Hasty nature over Thunder and Dragon Tail to 2HKO Chansey. Focus Punch can also be used with a Hasty nature over Fire Blast to hit Chansey while retaining Thunder or Dragon Tail and not losing automatically to Ferrothorn. Substitute can be used with or without Focus Punch to punish switches and protect Palkia from status; however, the loss in coverage generally increases the number of checks to Palkia. For teams that struggle against Ho-Oh in the sun, Stone Edge can be used to deal significant damage to it. Outrage can be used with Haban Berry to OHKO Latias; however, the result of getting locked into Outrage makes this option mediocre at best.</p> <p>As dangerous and effective as Palkia is, it still appreciates team support to be at its best. Having a strong response to Chansey and Arceus-Grass, especially for rain teams, is worthwhile. Fortunately, these two are quite easy to take advantage of, leaving you with multiple options. Forretress, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn are generally safe switch-ins to both Chansey and Arceus-Grass and can set up Spikes or use Rapid Spin without much risk. Watch out for Calm Mind or Fire Blast Arceus-Grass variants that might set up or KO your Spikes setter however. Tornadus-T and Ho-Oh are good offensive options to deal with Palkia's two main counters, but they need to be careful of switching into Toxic or Ice Beam in the case of Tornadus-T. Genesect and Kyurem-W are also good answers to Arceus-Grass, although the former needs to watch out for Will-O-Wisp and Fire Blast. Also, keep in mind that Arceus-Grass can be built to give Genesect a Special Attack boost, making it difficult to take down with U-turn when hazards are up. Powerful Fighting-types, such as Terrakion, can be used to force Chansey out, although they do not like switching into Toxic.</p> <p>Even for Palkia that run Dragon Tail, Calm Mind Arceus formes are threatening enough that a check to them in some form is strongly suggested. Bulky Choice Specs and specially defensive Kyogre are fairly reliable checks to the majority of the Arceus formes that use Calm Mind. Besides direct checks, simply overloading the Arceus forme with offensive pressure from the likes of Mewtwo and Darkrai can wear it down enough to no longer threaten Palkia. Darkrai in particular is a helpful teammate as it is one of the few offensive checks to Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost, the most common and dangerous Calm Mind user, and has Dark Void to serve as a blanket solution to the other Calm Mind Arceus.</p> <p>Packing a Steel-type to switch into the Dragon-type attacks that Palkia attracts is helpful to avoid losing a Pokemon every time Palkia knocks something out. Latios and offensive Latias can be especially bothersome to handle if they manage to find themselves face-to-face with Palkia. Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Arceus-Steel, and Heatran are generally reliable switch-ins to these two. Genesect is also a note-worthy check with its STAB U-turn, however, its fragility means even resisted Draco Meteors take a sizable chunk out of its health.</p> <p>Spikes support is worthwhile for teams using Dragon Tail Palkia, as it allows Palkia to wear down its checks more quickly, reducing the need to predict switches as often. Forretress, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn are effective defensive Spikers that can also serve as Chansey or Arceus-Grass checks as mentioned above. Deoxys-S, Deoxys-A, and Froslass are some good examples of reliable suicide leads that can quickly set up layers of Spikes for offensive teams.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>What used to be one of the best sets in DPP has certainly fallen from grace. However, Choice Scarf Palkia still serves as a nice glue for teams that desperately need a Kyogre check and a revenge killer in one Pokemon. Choice Scarf Palkia still maintains most of the same advantages it always had. The base 100 Speed is a major advantage for a Choice Scarf user in order to keep Dragon Dance Rayquaza variants in line. It also has the advantage of outspeeding Choice Scarf Genesect, by far the most common Choice Scarf user, which adds significantly to Palkia's ability to clean teams. Palkia's Water typing and signature Spacial Rend are two unique advantages it has as a cleaner as well.</p> <p>Surf is Palkia's most consistent and powerful move when you factor in rain support. Spacial Rend is almost just as important as it provides Palkia with an alternative move with consistently high power to clean up teams with, as well as hit the many bulky Dragon-types that resist Surf for super effective damage. Fire Blast allows Palkia to 2HKO Ferrothorn under the rain so that Palkia isn't utter Spikes fodder. Thunder rounds out the set by giving Palkia a means to hit Kyogre for super effective damage with a strong attack in order to fulfill its common role of Kyogre check.</p> <p>Outrage can be used to OHKO Latias after Stealth Rock even when using a Timid nature. Just be sure to move the leftover 4 EVs from HP into Attack when using Outrage to have a guaranteed chance to OHKO All-out attacker Latias. Draco Meteor is another useful move for its ability to outright OHKO Pokemon like Darkrai. For those who really like power, Hydro Pump can be used over Surf, although the shaky accuracy will eventually come back to haunt you. Sleep Talk is a possible move choice in order to turn your Palkia into a sleep absorber for Darkrai, but Palkia is already very stretched for moveslots.</p> <p>Rain support from Kyogre is very important to make Palkia as effective a cleaner as possible. Rain-boosted Surfs have the power to cleanly 2HKO max HP Arceus, which is often the core part of an offensive team's defensive backbone. It also makes Palkia a more effective revenge killer in general as it can drown threats such as Darkrai, Genesect, Tornadus-T, and often times even Mewtwo with a single Surf after Stealth Rock. That isn't to say that Choice Scarf Palkia should only be used on rain teams. Although it becomes far less effective, it still might find itself useful on a sand or sun team due to its ability to compress roles. If you happen to be considering Palkia for one of these teams, you can also consider using one of the alternative moves mentioned earlier, Draco Meteor and Outrage, in place of Surf. Keep in mind that, even on a sun team, Surf is beneficial for the possibility of cleaning up opposing rain teams.</p> <p>Ferrothorn is often one of the biggest troubles to Choice Scarf Palkia, as it can easily switch in on most of its unboosted, Choice-locked attacks and proceed to set up layers of Spikes or pester the rest of your team with Leech Seed. Even Fire Blast comes no where near OHKOing under the rain, forcing the Palkia user to perfectly predict the Ferrothorn switch-in twice in order to remove it. This inherent Ferrothorn weakness puts more pressure on your team to not share the same difficulty. It's also important to have a teammate that can quickly force Ferrothorn out such as Ho-Oh or Arceus-Fighting. Using a spinner is also not a wasted investment in the case that you find Ferrothorn setting up too many layers of Spikes on your field. Forretress is particularly effective at fighting off Ferrothorn as it can switch into any of its attacks, use Rapid Spin to remove any entry hazards and Leech Seed, and even set up Spikes itself thanks to Pain Split making it next to impossible for Ferrothorn to wear it down.</p> <p>As with any other viable Palkia variant, Chansey, Blissey, and Arceus-Grass are extremely difficult for Choice Scarf Palkia to beat. However, Arceus-Grass is somewhat easier to eventually muscle through as Choice Scarf Palkia outspeeds it, allowing Palkia to land an extra Spacial Rend before Arceus-Grass has a chance to use Recover. Being Choice-locked also opens up other potentially troublesome switch-ins such as Latias and Kyogre. Providing your team with some defensive backbone such as a Jirachi or Arceus-Grass can help remove the risk you take when selecting one attack over another with Choice Scarf Palkia.</p> <p>Although Choice Scarf Palkia is often used for its ability to revenge kill as well as check Kyogre, that doesn't mean it should be the only Kyogre check on your team. On the contrary, it's advised to add an additional Kyogre check as Choice Scarf Palkia is simply very inefficient at that role itself. Arceus-Grass, Latias, and Latios are some good examples of additional Kyogre checks that you can use. You can also choose to severely limit the number of free turns your team gives to the assorted Kyogre sets instead of adding a secondary Kyogre check. This can help Palkia indirectly by decreasing the number of times you have to resort to it to check Kyogre.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Although this set has intense competition from all-out attacker variants as a wallbreaker, there is certainly something to be said about possibly 2HKOing the likes of Ferrothorn with a resisted STAB. In general, Choice Specs Palkia OHKOes more and thus forces more switches than any other Palkia set. The strong STAB choices somewhat make up for the need to predict as a result of the inability to change moves. However, it does still run the risk of becoming setup fodder after its move choice has been revealed.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is the most important move on this set, as the power it has under rain is absolutely absurd. It cleanly 2HKOes Protect Blissey with Stealth Rock and a single layer of Spikes and also had a solid chance to OHKO bulky Arceus formes without any hazards up at all. Spacial Rend becomes quite formidable with a Choice Specs as well, being capable of 2HKOing max HP Arceus formes, such as Arceus-Grass, after Stealth Rock even if they Calm Mind after switching in. Draco Meteor is also impressive for those situations where you just want to nab a quick OHKO, such as against the likes of defensive Groudon, and then switch out afterwards. Fire Blast can be used instead of Draco Meteor to effortlessly wipe out Ferrothorn in the rain without having to put up with the fuss of Protect and insufficient hazards or prior damage. Thunder rounds out the set by giving Palkia a move to cleanly bust through specially defensive Kyogre with proper prediction.</p> <p>You can attempt to jam Surf someplace to have another option for when you don't want to risk the miss with Hydro Pump.</p> <p>Chansey and Arceus-Grass with some Special Defense investment remain an issue for Palkia. Specially defensive Kyogre can also be bothersome if you don't properly predict with Thunder. Therefore, Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress are valuable teammates, especially as they can provide the Spikes support needed to secure multiple 2HKOs and OHKOs. Alternatively, simply having those Spikes early on, such as through a suicide lead like Deoxys-S or Deoxys-A, will allow Palkia to 2HKO these three nuisances as they attempt to switch in. You can also use something like Tornadus-T or Shaymin-S if you prefer to convert Chansey, Arceus-Grass, and specially defensive Kyogre into free turns for something offensive. This is especially effective as these three will likely have to spend their following turn using some form of recovery after switching into Palkia.</p> <p>Although the Chansey, Arceus-Grass, and specially defensive Kyogre are generally the safest switch-ins, Pokemon such as Latias and Arceus-Steel can absorb one of Palkia's STABs exceptionally well even if they do run the risk of an instant OHKO if Palkia opts for the other STAB. Because of this, it's good to have a teammate that can switch into these guys in case you predict poorly. Genesect and Arceus-Steel are good options to handle a smart Latias user while a Ho-Oh or Dialga can keep most Arceus-Steel in line.</p> <p>Choice Specs Palkia demands rain more than any other Palkia variant simply because of how obscenely powerful its Hydro Pumps become with that support. However, it's worth noting that the significantly stronger Spacial Rend and Draco Meteor are valuable when the weather changes to sun, as they allow Palkia to 2HKO bulky Arceus formes and Ho-Oh without Stealth Rock. Therefore, it is difficult to say that rain support is a must as Choice Specs Palkia remains threatening outside of rain and, of course, becomes even more dangerous when facing a rain team.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>While Palkia does have a high base Speed for Ubers, it simply isn't high enough to sweep teams. Trick Room, although meant for much slower Pokemon, helps Palkia control Speed. With 0 Speed IVs and a Quiet nature, Palkia can \"outspeed\" all base 75s under Trick Room. This enables Palkia to outspeed all the base 90 Dragon-types that roam the tier, such as Zekrom and Reshiram. The rest of the moves help Palkia sweep when it sets up Trick Room. Spacial Rend is a strong, reliable STAB move that 2HKOes anything that doesn't resist it and isn't named Chansey. Hydro Pump boosted in the rain and by Lustrous Orb is a frightening move to face, OHKOing even 252 HP neutral Arceus formes and Lugia after Stealth Rock. Surf is a more reliable option but loses many OHKOs that Hydro Pump could achieve. The final choice comes down to which walls you want to harass more. Fire Blast OHKOes Ferrothorn in the rain after it has taken a Surf but is largely useless outside of that. Thunder deals massive damage to defensive Kyogre, which avoids getting 2HKOed by Spacial Rend, but it comes with a chance to paralyze enemies, which might hurt Palkia if it has used Trick Room.</p> <p>Palkia uses a spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA to make itself bulky and strong at the same time, but there are some alternative spreads that are also viable. For instance, if you want to use a physical move like Outrage to better hurt Chansey and defensive Kyogre, then a spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 SpA with a Quiet nature can be used to maximize the damage output of Outrage.</p> <p>Palkia appreciates teammates that can provide entry hazard support so that its enemies can be weakened. In fact, after taking Stealth Rock damage, Palkia's Hydro Pump OHKOs Great Wall Lugia and 252 HP support Arceus hit neutrally by Palkia's Hydro Pump! Deoxys-A, Deoxys-S, Forretress, and Ferrothorn, thus, are great partners for Palkia as they can setup Stealth Rock and Spikes to whittle away at the enemy's health. Ferrothorn and Forretress in particular excel at this job due to their great synergy with Palkia. As an added bonus, Palkia can absorb Fire-type attacks fired at the two and use Trick Room to let them and itself move first. Forretress can also wall enemy Ferrothorn that threaten Palkia. Kyogre is a great partner for Palkia, too. It not only boosts the power of Hydro Pump and makes Thunder 100% accurate, but because Kyogre and Palkia share similar checks, Choice Specs Kyogre can be used to weaken opponents like Latias and Chansey down for Palkia. Pokemon that can stop Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Arceus-Grass in general are great partners for Palkia. Tornadus-T, Genesect, and Scizor do an exceptionally good job at this. All three can threaten Arceus-Grass with their STAB attacks and transfer momentum to Palkia with U-turn. Scizor in particular performs well at this role. Its low Speed enables it to not only help get Palkia in safely in by providing a slow U-turn but also benefit from the Trick Room Palkia sets, enabling it to hammer down walls if necessary.</p> <p>Palkia generally relies on its good bulk and its ability to bluff another set to set up Trick Room. If you want a more reliable way to get Palkia to set up Trick Room, however, you can use Wobbuffet. Wobbuffet can easily Encore Fire- and Water-type attacks for Palkia to set up on as well as kill troublesome foes with Mirror Coat and Counter. If you do not want to use Wobbuffet, giving dual screen support to help Palkia take a hit and set up is another viable idea. Latios deserves a special mention in this role, as it can use Memento after it has set up screens to help Palkia force an enemy to switch, which is a turn Palkia can use to set up Trick Room.</p>"

  "Giratina": {
    "overview": "<p>Even though Dragon-types have always served to limit Giratina's impressive walling potential, one would regret discounting it as a defensive threat. Giratina is the most resilient spinblocker of the Ubers metagame and an excellent counter to potent threats such as Rock Polish Groudon and almost all physical variants of Arceus. While its low offenses do turn Giratina into setup fodder for some entry hazard users, such as Forretress and Ferrothorn, and some dangerous threats, such as Rayquaza and Darkrai, Giratina still finds a niche on stall teams as both a spinblocker and wall. Dragon Tail and Roar prevent Giratina from being complete setup bait, somewhat alleviating its issues. Giratina can even take advantage of its natural bulk to set up multiple boosts, allowing it to sweep an unsuspecting team. While Arceus-Ghost gives it serious competition, Giratina still has many notable advantages. Its sheer bulk and ability to hold Leftovers allow it to stop Excadrill and Kabutops from spinning, something Arceus-Ghost is incapable of. Its unique typing allows it to avoid getting 2HKOed by Choice Specs Kyogre's Water Spout and wall Blaziken, Pokemon that would OHKO Arceus-Ghost. While the lack of a recovery move outside of Rest does hinder Giratina's walling capabilities, one would be foolish to think this stops it from fulfilling its role. Finally, its titanic defenses allow it to viably use RestTalk as a method of recovery, a feat few Uber Pokemon can boast.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Giratina can use Dragon Claw, but Dragon Tail is recommended for phazing, and Outrage is recommended for more power. Shadow Sneak has the merit of being able to pick off Pokemon that Giratina has worn out with its constant phazing, but outside of that it has little to no use and is generally not worth the moveslot. Earthquake allows Giratina to destroy Heatran and 2HKO Excadrill, but it is weak when hitting other Pokemon. Giratina can also utilize an attacking lead set with Magic Coat, but it is generally too unreliable. Giratina's offensive stats are mediocre especially by Uber standards. Hidden Power Fire doesn't even kill Forretress after Stealth Rock, and Ferrothorn and Skarmory can even laugh at it. If you want to go on the offensive, Giratina is not the one to fulfill your needs. Giratina-O and Arceus-Ghost are the offensive spinblockers you should be using. A Choice Scarf Giratina is a gimmick because it is very weak and largely outclassed by others such as Choice Scarf Dialga. Using a Choice item also means Giratina wastes its tremendous bulk. Spite can be used effectively thanks to Giratina's massive walling capabilities. Spite combined with Pressure can easily drain tons of PP in an environment where most moves only have 8 PP. Giratina can use Substitute or Roar well on its Calm Mind sets. The former enables it to avoid status and Leech Seed while the latter eases its issues with enemy phazers, but missing out on coverage generally makes these two moves inferior.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>While Giratina is a phenomenal wall, it suffers heavily due to its common weaknesses. Darkrai, Arceus-Ghost, and Arceus-Dark in particular destroy it easily. Darkrai can even put to sleep another of Giratina's teammates if it is sleeping due to Rest. Giratina's complete reliance on preventing itself from being set up on through Roar or Dragon Tail makes it very vulnerable to Taunt, and if a phazer faster than Giratina, such as Lugia, confronts it, it will be rendered useless as it cannot do anything aside from statusing said phazer. Reliance on RestTalk for recovery makes Giratina that much more vulnerable to Taunt and phazing when entry hazards are up. Gyarados and Gliscor are perfect examples of Pokemon that utilize all these attributes to easily destroy Giratina. Gliscor and Gyarados can simply Taunt Giratina to prevent it from recovering, use Substitute to prevent themselves from getting phazed by Dragon Tail, and wear down Giratina with Toxic, or in Gyarados's case, Dragon Tail. Giratina doesn't even need to have one Pokemon to specifically counter it. If Giratina uses Rest and entry hazards are up, it can be continuously phazed or threatened out by the presence of an offensive Dragon-type, eventually causing it to faint due to the fact it takes a lot of damage from entry hazards as it is weak to all of them.</p> <p>There are a few Pokemon that can counter Giratina on their own. Powerful Dragon-type sweepers such as Rayquaza, Choice Band Garchomp, Arceus-Dragon, Salamence, Kyurem-B, and Zekrom can all threaten to 2HKO Giratina if they can avoid a burn when switching in. These Dragon-types won't enjoy Dragon Tail, however. If Giratina uses Rest, all of those Dragon-types can come in and force it out. If Tyranitar avoids Will-O-Wisp, it can 2HKO Giratina with Choice Band Crunch, and it is a great counter to both the boosting tank Giratina set and ChestoRest Giratina set due to the Special Defense buff Tyranitar gets from the sandstorm it creates.</p> <p>One of Giratina's roles is spinblocking, but there is one Pokemon that even Giratina cannot stop from spinning. Cloyster can easily Shell Smash as Giratina comes in to stop it and OHKO with Icicle Spear, preventing Giratina from spinblocking. Giratina also has considerable problems with Substitute Excadrill with Swords Dance and Pain Split Forretress with Toxic. The former's Substitute cannot be broken by Dragon Tail, so if Giratina lacks Roar it will eventually get beaten down by Earthquake. The latter will never get worn down from Giratina's Dragon Tails and entry hazards due to Pain Split, meaning Giratina will be turned into permanent Spikes fodder and might eventually even go down to continuous Toxic and Pain Split damage.</p> <p>If it is the last Pokemon, Bulk Up Dialga with Rest defeats Giratina quite handily. Arceus-Dragon with Calm Mind easily beats most Giratina sets. Pokemon that have their moves boosted by an item that wield powerful STAB Draco Meteors can exploit Giratina's typing and KO it. Latios, Latias, Choice Specs Dialga, Choice Specs Palkia, Choice Specs Reshiram, and Life Orb Kyurem-W can all OHKO Giratina with a powerful STAB Draco Meteor. Reshiram in particular excels at doing this as it can come into Will-O-Wisp for free. Finally, Wobbuffet can exploit Dragon Tail's negative priority in order to Encore Giratina and help a dangerous sweeper set up.</p>",

      "The Great Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Giratina's impressive defenses and access to Will-O-Wisp allow it to counter many prominent physical threats, including most physical Arceus variants, any Groudon, Ho-Oh, Blaziken, Scizor, Metagross, and many more. Giratina's enormous defenses make it the only spinblocker capable of preventing Kabutops and Excadrill that have used Swords Dance from spinning. It should be noted that Excadrill will 2HKO Giratina after it has used Swords Dance, so Giratina is at best able to phaze it and Rest. Giratina can't even burn Excadrill without fainting. Dragon Tail is an alternative phazing move that works even while Taunted, which stops Giratina from being setup fodder for many powerful setup sweepers such as Mewtwo. It also allows Giratina to punish any Dragon-type or Pokemon with weak defenses that thinks it can switch in freely, denting said Pokemon while forcing it out. The ability to phaze and deal respectable damage in the process often makes Dragon Tail appear to be the preferred move, but its inability to phaze Pokemon that use Substitute, such as Ho-Oh and Excadrill, often makes Roar the better choice. Giratina can use both phazing moves, but forgoing Will-O-Wisp prevents it from permanently crippling physical attackers. However because Giratina is often used on general Uber stall teams, Will-O-Wisp might be worthless if your team focuses heavily on wearing down the opponent with Toxic Spikes. Will-O-Wisp, however, still has the ability to burn Steel-types such as Arceus-Steel and Ferrothorn, slightly hampering their bulk. Needless to say, Giratina has the ability to block Rapid Spin, but it's worth noting that Giratina cannot hurt Forretress at all, while it has an easy time setting up Spikes on Giratina. Whether or not you want to use Roar depends upon what your team needs.</p> <p>You can consider investing additional Speed EVs if you wish to engage in a Speed creep contest with opposing Groudon, Dialga, and Giratina. Other moveslot options include Toxic and Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave might have some use as a lure for fast attackers such as Darkrai, but Will-O-Wisp has more overall utility as this Giratina is supposed to counter physical threats. Earthquake pairs well with Dragon Tail and kills Heatran in one hit, when it would otherwise wall Giratina completely.</p> <p>Giratina is countered by sweepers who can capitalize on its numerous common weaknesses. In particular, Darkrai, Arceus-Dark, and Dialga terrorize Giratina as it can't really hurt them aside from preventing them from coming in through smart Dragon Tail use. Powerful Dragon-types such as Rayquaza, Reshiram, Zekrom, Latios, Latias, Kyurem-W, and Palkia can also easily 2HKO Giratina at worst with their incredibly powerful Dragon attacks provided they safely switch in. However, all of these Dragon-types hate to stomach a Dragon Tail or a potential Will-O-Wisp. In order to deal with these Pokemon, it's recommended to use partners such as Chansey, Blissey, Groudon, and Lugia. All in all, the best partner for Giratina is probably Forretress: the two have excellent type synergy, Giratina protects the entry hazards set up by Forretress, and Forretress spins away the nasty Spikes that hurt Giratina. Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Genesect are decent partners to Giratina too. All three boast Dragon-, Dark-, and Ghost-type resistances and the first two can launch Spikes onto the opposing battlefield that Giratina conveniently blocks. Genesect can assist in stacking entry hazard damage and also destroys Latios and Latias with its powerful U-turn. Ho-Oh is a decent partner because its special bulk and typing help against the strong special attackers such as Arceus-Dark and Palkia that plague Giratina. Lugia might share Ice-, Dark-, and Ghost-type weaknesses with Giratina, but it checks most physical Dragon-types that plague Giratina and Giratina in return can absorb Thunder and Bolt Strike for Lugia. Groudon checks the physical sweepers Giratina cannot stop such as Rayquaza, Garchomp, Zekrom, Dialga, and Salamence thanks to its massive Defense stat and lack of Dragon-type weakness. Scizor gets a mention for sharing good type synergy with Giratina and countering most Dark-types.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Many people argue that Arceus-Ghost overshadows Giratina. This set utilizes Giratina's main advantage over Arceus-Ghost: resistances and Leftovers. While Arceus-Ghost lacks nasty Dragon- and Ice-type weaknesses, Giratina has resistances to Fire-, Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type moves, something Arceus-Ghost can only dream about. Instead of focusing on Defense, this set takes a different approach to using Giratina. With the EVs and nature used on this set, Giratina can even survive two full-power Choice Specs-boosted Water Spouts from the most powerful of Kyogre given that no entry hazards are up. This in conjunction with Pressure allows Giratina to stall out Choice Specs Kyogre locked into any move not named Ice Beam with ease. If your team lacks something to stomach Blue Flares from the deadly Reshiram or a check to Calm Mind Arceus, Mewtwo, or Deoxys-A, this Giratina can do it well. No Calm Mind Arceus, Mewtwo, or Deoxys-A will be able to 2HKO it even after Stealth Rock damage. In fact, Giratina will always a survive Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor from Reshiram or Rayquaza, given that no entry hazards are up. Arceus-Ghost can never achieve such amazing feats. In fact, Arceus-Ghost is always OHKOed by Choice Specs Kyogre. Giratina can easily stall out Shaymin-S's Seed Flare as well with its resistance, bulk, and Pressure. Even when using this set, Giratina still retains a lot of its physical bulk. For example, it can still survive a Choice Scarf Zekrom's Outrage after Stealth Rock damage, taking only 74% - 87.5%, and it can still stop Excadrill and Kabutops from spinning. It should be warned that Swords Dance boosted Earthquake from Excadrill will OHKO with Stealth Rock and sandstorm damage though.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp ruins physical attackers such as Garchomp and Zekrom that might attempt to take advantage of this Giratina's weaker Defense stat. Dragon Tail phazes and damages Pokemon, which helps quickly accumulate damage onto an opponent's team, and is not blocked by Taunt. This combined with its ability to severely harm Dragon-types that try switching into Giratina makes it a wonderful move. Roar blasts through Substitute, which can be useful if you are facing a Kyogre or Shaymin-S with Substitute. RestTalk is all Giratina has as recovery, but it's really all it needs. With those moves, Giratina can also act as a status absorber for the team.</p> <p>You can consider investing additional Speed EVs if you wish to engage in a Speed creep contest with opposing Groudon, Dialga, and Giratina. Other moveslot options include Toxic and Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave might have some use as a lure for fast attackers, but Will-O-Wisp has more overall utility.</p> <p>This Giratina is meant to utilize its resistances and absorb resisted powerful special hits such as Kyogre's Water Spout. However, even with this layout, Giratina still hates facing powerful Draco Meteors. Therefore, Blissey and Chansey are great teammates. Other teammates, such as Forretress, Lugia, Groudon, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory, work for this set as well. Forretress and in fact spinners in general, are a particular necessity for Giratina. Because the presence of entry hazards will make Giratina get 2HKOed by attacks that it would otherwise avoid getting 2HKOed from, such as Choice Specs Water Spout from Kyogre, a spinner or Magic Bounce user greatly helps it perform its job as a special sponge.</p>"
      },
      "ChestoRest": {
        "description": "<p>One playstyle is always associated with Giratina, and that is stall. This set attempts to capitalize on that stereotype and catch the opponent by surprise, although it should be noted that the lack of Leftovers might prematurely reveal it to the opponent, as it is one of the few viable Giratina sets that does not use Leftovers. While standard Giratina is more suited for stall teams, ChestoRest Giratina can be used as an aggressive spinblocker on more offensively based teams. Giratina is easily the bulkiest Pokemon in the entire game, which means that it can very easily snag one or two Calm Mind boosts. This set plays a lot like ChestoRest Kyogre, but trades power for much more overall bulk and coverage. While an offensive Calm Mind set is usually more suited to Giratina-O, its inability to hold a Chesto Berry automatically disqualifies it from running this particular set. This Giratina hits surprisingly hard after a Calm Mind or two, and outside of extremely powerful physical attacks, it will not faint without first netting at least one or two kills. To illustrate, it easily 2HKOes Extreme Killer Arceus and Dialga with a +1 Aura Sphere; neither Pokemon is able to OHKO in return, unless Dialga is carrying Choice Specs.</p> <p>The best part about that set is that most people attempt to take it out like they would the regular defensive sets; that is, by using Toxic and attacking it while it is sleeping. ChestoRest Giratina flips that concept on its head by casually setting up with Calm Mind until its health gets low, using Rest to get back to full health, and waking up immediately thanks to the Chesto Berry. Dragon Pulse is preferred for the main STAB. Aura Sphere gives the best overall coverage as it is unresisted alongside Dragon Pulse, and most importantly, it 2HKOes Ferrothorn and Tyranitar at +1. However, if Ferrothorn is of no concern, Thunder is useful as it takes down Kyogre, Skarmory, and Lugia much more easily.</p> <p>Shadow Ball can be used as the STAB attack to hit Mewtwo, Lugia, and Arceus-Ghost harder, but its relatively low power and inability to take out Dragon-types is a letdown. Will-O-Wisp can be used in the last slot to cripple physical attackers, but as this set is attempting to sweep, it isn't exactly helpful. Earth Power is Giratina's best weapon against Jirachi and Metagross, who could potentially be annoying, and also grants it an easy OHKO on Heatran. Hidden Power Fire allows Giratina to OHKO Scizor and do more damage to Ferrothorn, but it is rather useless otherwise. Substitute allows Giratina to avoid Ferrothorn's Leech Seed, status, and helps it avoid getting revenge killed by faster Dragon-types, but it is largely useless outside of that.</p> <p>A Modest nature and maximum Special Attack investment allow Giratina to hit as hard as possible, while the rest of the EVs make it as bulky as possible. A more physically bulky spread of 112 HP / 252 Def / 144 SpA can be used to survive a Life Orb-boosted Outrage from Jolly Rayquaza at full health, although the power drop is very significant. Additionally, even if Giratina does survive such a hit, it's not going to be sweeping much anyway. Giratina can reallocate EVs from its HP stat into its Speed stat to Speed creep, but doing so lowers its bulk, which might make it harder to get Calm Minds. On the other hand, it is useful for outspeeding slower Kyogre, Zekrom, Reshiram, Dialga, and Giratina and Resting or killing said Pokemon before they can harm Giratina.</p> <p>Strong, super effective physical attacks are the key to taking down Calm Mind Giratina. Life Orb- or Choice Band-boosted Outrage from Rayquaza, Zekrom, and Garchomp can OHKO Giratina, and Choice Band Crunch from Tyranitar and Icicle Crash from Mamoswine will also leave a huge dent. In addition, Bulk Up Dialga can defeat Giratina if it has some Speed investment and Outrage. Choice Band Metagross can be problematic as it resists Dragon Pulse and has enough bulk to tank Aura Sphere, and Giratina's lack of Will-O-Wisp allows Metagross to Meteor Mash it with impunity. Skarmory can force +1 Giratina out with Whirlwind if Giratina lacks Thunder; Jirachi can also be annoying with paralysis and Iron Head flinches.</p> <p>Physically defensive Steel-types are excellent teammates for Giratina. Forretress can Rapid Spin away the Toxic Spikes that might force Giratina to Rest earlier than is desirable, and can set up Toxic Spikes of its own, allowing Giratina to defeat Blissey and Chansey more easily. Skarmory can also switch into Outrage and set up Spikes, but it must watch out for Zekrom's Bolt Strike and Rayquaza's V-create. It is worth noting that these entry hazards are easily kept on the field by Giratina's spinblocking abilities. Magnezone can trap and KO Skarmory as well as Metagross locked into Meteor Mash. Groudon, especially Swords Dance variants, can take on Dialga, Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Metagross easily.</p> <p>Giratina's other major enemies are specially defensive Calm Mind users. Arceus-Steel resists Giratina's STABs and outspeeds it, allowing Arceus-Steel to cushion Aura Sphere with its own Calm Mind; Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Ghost can do the same thing. Ho-Oh is therefore another great teammate for Giratina, as it can defeat most of the Calm Mind users that Giratina has trouble against. Darkrai is also an excellent offensive check to Arceus-Ghost as it outspeeds and can put Arceus-Ghost to sleep with Dark Void and then set up Nasty Plot to sweep. Giratina won't be able to sweep all the time either, but it will generally leave a hole in the enemy team for another Pokemon to take advantage of and sweep. As such, Pokemon that can finish off Giratina's sweep are appreciated. Arceus-Steel excels at this. It not only synergizes nicely with Giratina but can also wage a winning Calm Mind war against any enemy Calm Mind Arceus that Giratina encounters, thanks to its access to Roar.</p>"

      "Mono-Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>While Giratina is usually seen as a wall, its amazing defenses in conjunction with Calm Mind mean it can easily set up on many threats. After a Calm Mind, it is nearly impossible to OHKO Giratina with any attack. Only extremely powerful attacks like Kyurem-W's Choice Specs Draco Meteor and powerful physical attackers such as Kyurem-B can OHKO Giratina. If supported properly, Giratina should be able to achieve six Calm Minds, but as always, exercise discretion when setting up. Unfortunately, even after six Calm Minds, Giratina fails to 2HKO Blissey and Chansey, but both of them can be PP stalled with Pressure, a strategy that works better with Toxic Spikes support from Forretress. This set beats mono-attacking Calm Mind Kyogre and Arceus-Fire one-on-one due to its resistances and Pressure.</p> <p>If you want to forgo Sleep Talk, Giratina has a number of options. Shadow Ball is useful against Mewtwo, and Will-O-Wisp is an option if you want this Giratina to act as a lure for Tyranitar, or as a check to physical Arceus variants and Groudon. Roar allows Giratina to boost alongside the opponent and Roar it out.</p> <p>Unfortunately, none of these options let Giratina defeat its counters, which include many powerful attackers such as Darkrai, Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Ghost, Arceus-Steel, and Dialga. As such, Scizor, Genesect, Blissey, and Chansey are good options for teammates. You might want Heal Bell support from Chansey and Blissey particularly because of the BW sleep mechanics. Finally, you will probably want Toxic Spikes support from Forretress to help handle Chansey and Blissey, who give Giratina trouble otherwise. Ho-Oh also checks most Calm Mind Arceus and Darkrai for Giratina and scares of Chansey and Blissey. Heatran is a decent partner for Giratina as it resists all of Giratina's weaknesses and Giratina protects it from Groudon and Earthquake Ho-Oh. Heatran can also check Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Ghost, and Arceus-Steel, all of whom can beat Giratina easily. Kyogre can be used to absorb Ice Beam and check most Calm Mind Arceus.</p> <p>Weather doesn't really matter to Giratina, but Groudon is recommended as a check to the physical attackers Giratina cannot handle such as Zekrom and Rayquaza. One of the Steel-type Spikers, Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory, is a required partner for Giratina because of their type synergy and ability to lay entry hazards. Genesect can also work as a partner for Giratina, switching into Rayquaza or Zekrom's Outrage and KOing in return with Download-boosted Ice Beam. Forretress is probably the best partner for Giratina, as it also removes Spikes with Rapid Spin, which can be a particular nuisance if Giratina gets phazed while they are up. Giratina is greatly annoyed by enemy phazers, especially Perish Song Arceus, as they can completely remove its boosts, so it's recommended that you either weaken or take down the phazers so that Giratina can more easily sweep. Chansey, Blissey, Ho-Oh, and Kyogre all help check the special attackers that trouble Giratina. Kyogre's turbulent rain will make Reshiram sad while a powerful Surf can easily drown it. Chansey and Blissey can handle the special attacks that are too powerful for Giratina to handle such as a Choice Specs Dialga's Draco Meteor. They can also wake Giratina up immediately after using Rest with Aromatherapy or Heal Bell. Kyogre can set up alongside most Calm Mind Arceus formes and eventually win the Calm Mind war with Surf or Scald, thanks to the weather and Kyogre's superior special stats.</p> <p>If Giratina is used with Groudon and Forretress, you can use Ho-Oh and Heatran, which are other excellent checks to Giratina's counters such as Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Steel, and Arceus-Ghost. Heatran can Taunt and eventually kill most special attacking Arceus formes, and Ho-Oh can bypass Calm Mind boosts with its incredibly powerful Sacred Fire and Brave Bird. Scizor and Genesect can still work as partners to counter Darkrai and Arceus-Dark. Outside of that, however, Scizor and Genesect are pretty much useless. Metagross is also a decent teammate for Giratina, thanks to its Steel typing and great Attack stat. Metagross can 2HKO most Arceus formes with its bone-shattering Choice Band Meteor Mash. Lugia can assist Giratina in walling physical or mixed attackers such as Rayquaza and Garchomp. Arceus-Steel resists most of Giratina's weaknesses and beats Arceus-Dark one-on-one. Excadrill gets a mention for Rapid Spin and resistances to Dragon-, Ghost-, and Dark-type moves. It can also beat Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Steel one-on-one.</p>"

  "Manaphy": {
    "overview": "<p>The prince of the seas may appear to just be another pixie. After all, why use a pure Water-type with base 100 stats across the board when you can use one with base 120 stats across the board in Arceus? The answer lies in Manaphy's ability, Hydration, which grants it immunity to all forms of status in the rain. This, along with its boosting moves, Calm Mind and Tail Glow, allows it to utterly annihilate stall teams as long as Kyogre's ubiquitous rain is kept up. Every team needs to have a decent answer to Manaphy unless it plans to lose and lose badly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Manaphy can competently run a Toxic stall set due to Hydration's benefits. Either an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature or a bulkier spread is optimal with a moveset of Toxic, Scald, Rest, and Ice Beam. Heart Swap is also an interesting option, especially when coupled with Tailwind support from Tornadus. With this combination, you can easily let an opposing Calm Mind Arceus grab six Calm Minds, send in Tornadus for the Tailwind, steal Arceus's boosts with Manaphy, and then proceed to sweep.</p> <p>Manaphy can also make use of Reflect and Light Screen and take on the role of a supporter, which is useful due to the offensive nature of the Uber tier. Acid Armor can be used on the Calm Mind set to increase Manaphy's Defense, but Manaphy really enjoys the coverage provided by Ice Beam. Manaphy can run an effective Choice Specs set due to its decent movepool and ability to scout with U-turn or recover all of its health with Rest. It is also immune to status moves in rain, which gives it ample opportunity to switch in on Pokemon that carry them. It is, however, outclassed by Kyogre as a Choice Specs user. Likewise, Manaphy can run a Choice Scarf set with Surf, Ice Beam, Grass Knot, and U-turn to revenge kill Rayquaza and other threats, but Palkia generally does a much better job at this, as it has much more power and much better coverage than Manaphy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Calm Mind Arceus-Electric is probably the most reliable counter to Manaphy that you can find. Against Manaphy's Calm Mind set, Electric Arceus can easily Calm Mind alongside Manaphy, while the Tail Glow set is OHKOed by Thunder. Arceus-Grass is also excellent at taking on Manaphy, but it must use Judgment as Grass Knot does next to nothing. Ferrothorn can take an attack and hit Manaphy back very hard, although it is 2HKOed by the Tail Glow set. Also, if Ferrothorn gets burned by Scald, Manaphy can use it as setup fodder. Choice Scarf Zekrom can revenge kill just about every variant of Manaphy with Bolt Strike. Calm Mind or Choice Specs Kyogre with Thunder, Calm Mind Latias, Mewtwo, Arceus-Dragon, and Choice Specs Dialga can all defeat Calm Mind Manaphy. Choice Scarf Kyogre and Palkia can take on offensive Tail Glow Manaphy that lack Grass Knot, while Choice Scarf Dialga will win most of the time against any Tail Glow variant. Thundurus and Shaymin-S can outspeed and OHKO Tail Glow Manaphy, although they need to watch out for Ice Beam and rain-boosted Surfs.</p> <p>Because Manaphy is heavily reliant on rain, taking away Kyogre's Drizzle support is a good idea. While Groudon does not enjoy switching into any of Manaphy's attacks, it can switch in on Tail Glow or Rest and remove the rain, making Manaphy easier to deal with. Tyranitar works in a similar way, as does Hippowdon. Abomasnow, although rare, handily beats most Manaphy variants as it takes away the rain, resists Manaphy's Water-type attacks, resists Grass Knot, and takes neutral damage from Ice Beam. With a specially defensive spread, Abomasnow can easily make Manaphy's life difficult with moves such as Leech Seed and Giga Drain. Finally, although it gets OHKOed by Ice Beam, Rayquaza can switch in on a predicted Rest and set up on Manaphy for a sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>While Manaphy's other setup move, Tail Glow, seems more appealing with its massive +3 Special Attack boost, Calm Mind is actually Manaphy's most reliable form of stat boosting. A common way of defeating the Tail Glow set involves equipping Kyogre, Palkia, or Dialga with a Choice Scarf and taking it down with Thunder. However, with a Calm Mind boost, the aforementioned Pokemon will not be doing enough damage to stop Manaphy from setting up another Calm Mind, using Rest to recover the damage, and then waking up immediately if rain is active. Manaphy can then alternate between Calm Mind and Rest to slowly set up until it is ready to sweep. The beauty of this set is Manaphy's ability to singlehandedly destroy stall teams without crumbling immediately to offensively based teams. While the Tail Glow set is scary due to its ability to hit extremely hard and quickly, the Calm Mind set instills a whole new type of fear, a fear that is slowly sewn into your opponent's mind as they helplessly watch the prince of the seas take apart their team. Calm Mind and Rest are obviously the crux of the set, allowing Manaphy to set up on what would have been 2HKOs. Scald is the preferred STAB in this case, as a potential burn can cripple the physical attackers attempting to bypass Manaphy's Special Defense boosts. Ice Beam rounds off the set, as it allows the best possible coverage, as well as OHKOing dangerous threats such as Shaymin-S, Rayquaza, and other Dragon-types.</p> <p>To demonstrate Manaphy's durability after a Calm Mind, here are a few damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>252 SpA Kyogre, Palkia, or Dialga Thunder vs. +1 Manaphy 48.02% - 56.93%</li> <li>252 SpA Kyogre, Palkia, or Dialga Thunder vs. +2 Manaphy 36.14% - 43.07%</li> <li>252 SpA+ Kyogre or Dialga Thunder vs. +1 Manaphy 52.97% - 62.38%</li> <li>252 SpA+ Kyogre or Dialga Thunder vs. +2 Manaphy 39.60% - 47.03%</li> <li>252 SpA Shaymin-S Seed Flare vs. Manaphy 61.39% - 72.77%</li> <li>252 SpA Thundurus Thunder vs. Manaphy 62.87% - 74.75%</li> </ul> <p>As shown above, with the exception of Modest Choice Scarf Kyogre or Dialga (which still need two very high damage rolls to 2HKO with Thunder), none of the listed revenge killers of the Tail Glow set can stop Manaphy from setting up Calm Minds, unless they land a critical hit, which admittedly is likely enough for a slowly boosting Pokemon such as Calm Mind Manaphy.</p> <p>The EV spread makes Manaphy as bulky as possible while retaining the ability to outspeed an unboosted Rayquaza and Speed tie with base 100s, most notably Palkia. A bulkier spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature can be used, as it allows Manaphy to survive a Jolly Choice Scarf Zekrom's Bolt Strike at full health. This EV spread also makes Manaphy harder to take down with physical attacks in general, but Manaphy really likes the ability to KO Rayquaza before it can do anything. As for moves, Grass Knot is an option to take down Kyogre, but Ice Beam is by far the better move due to its super effective coverage; unless Kyogre is carrying Choice Specs or has both Calm Mind and Thunder, it will lose to Manaphy anyway.</p> <p>Because Manaphy's main attraction is Hydration in tandem with Rest, support from Kyogre is essential. The biggest problem with this is that Manaphy and Kyogre both share weaknesses to Electric- and Grass-type attacks. Dialga resists both Grass- and Electric-type moves and can use the combination of Bulk Up and Draco Meteor to lure out Groudon and put it out of commission. Defensively, Giratina and Giratina-O also resist both Electric- and Grass-type moves. Choice Scarf Zekrom is especially dangerous because it outspeeds and OHKOes both Manaphy and Kyogre with Bolt Strike. A Dialga holding a Choice Specs also defeats Manaphy, as it resists Scald, it takes a pittance from Ice Beam, and Manaphy cannot set up on it as Thunder 2HKOes Manaphy even at +2. Because Electric-type attacks are extremely common in Ubers, Ground-types that take advantage of Choice-locked Electric-type attacks are extremely useful. Swords Dance Arceus-Ground and Garchomp can switch into Choice Electric-type attacks and snag a free Swords Dance. While extremely risky, Substitute + Hone Claws Dugtrio can severely punish a Choice Scarf Zekrom locked into Bolt Strike by trapping it, setting up a Substitute, and using Hone Claws multiple times in order to sweep.</p> <p>Ferrothorn is, in general, a good check to Manaphy, although if it gets burned by Scald on the switch-in, Manaphy can easily set up on it. Calm Mind Kyogre, Arceus-Water, Arceus-Dragon, Arceus-Grass with Judgment, Arceus-Electric, Mewtwo, and Latias can also defeat Calm Mind Manaphy one-on-one. A Kyogre with Roar can force Manaphy out if it's not the last Pokemon. Because of this, a Ferrothorn of your own works very well to defeat the aforementioned Calm Mind users—apart from Arceus-Grass—by using Leech Seed and Power Whip to whittle down their HP. A Choice Scarf Zekrom of your own also works very well, as it can revenge kill Kyogre, Arceus-Water, Arceus-Dragon, Mewtwo, and Latias easily. Dialga can also defeat Arceus-Grass, as can Lugia, Chansey, and Blissey. Even though it prefers sun, Ho-Oh can check Grass Arceus, as well as combating sun teams. Arceus-Steel, Jirachi, Blissey, and Chansey also help to combat Choice Specs Dialga. Rayquaza can be troublesome if it catches Manaphy using Rest as it switches in, as Air Lock nullifies Kyogre's rain. Choice Scarf Palkia, Salamence, and Garchomp can easily revenge kill Dragon Dance Rayquaza, while fast Steel-types can take down Swords Dance variants.</p>"
      },
      "Tail Glow": {
        "description": "<p>Manaphy's other major attraction is its semi-unique boosting move, Tail Glow. With it, Manaphy can gain a huge +3 Special Attack boost, transforming into an offensive powerhouse in a single turn. Not only that, but against slower, more defensive teams, Manaphy can reach +6 in the space of two turns, and without an appropriate counter, any stall team will be swiftly flattened. Surf is its main STAB attack, and it is powerful enough to 2HKO Ferrothorn in the rain while Manaphy avoids being OHKOed in return. Ice Beam gives Manaphy excellent coverage, OHKOing Rayquaza and hitting Grass- and Dragon-types extremely hard. Grass Knot, however, can be used to severely damage opposing Kyogre on the switch-in or to simply OHKO slower variants if Manaphy has a Tail Glow boost.</p> <p>There are actually a number of different ways to play Tail Glow Manaphy. The given EV spread allows Manaphy to be as strong and fast as possible, but because Tail Glow gives Manaphy a huge +3 Special Attack boost, a bulky spread can be used so Manaphy can survive more hits. A spread of 252 HP / 40 SpA / 216 Spe with a Timid nature allows Manaphy to always survive Choice Scarf Kyogre's Thunder after Stealth Rock and one round of Leftovers recovery while OHKOing in return with Grass Knot after Stealth Rock damage. If Speed is not too important, another spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature takes full advantage of Manaphy's bulk, as it allows Manaphy to survive attacks such as Thundurus's Thunder and Shaymin-S's Seed Flare. If you are using a bulky spread, Manaphy can use Scald to potentially land a burn on its counters. Energy Ball is usable over Grass Knot if you want a quick way to take out opposing Manaphy, but Grass Knot is better in all other scenarios. As for the item choice, Leftovers is the most preferred, as Tail Glow gives Manaphy a huge boost in power while letting it take advantage of its decent bulk. However, if overkill attacking power is your thing, Life Orb can be used, as it does allow Manaphy to OHKO some variants of offensive Dialga with Surf.</p> <p>Another way of playing Tail Glow Manaphy is to use the main EV spread, but to equip a Wacan Berry onto it and use Tail Glow and three attacks instead of Rest. With a Wacan Berry, Manaphy can bait in common revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Zekrom and Kyogre, survive an Electric-type attack, and OHKO in return with the appropriate coverage move.</p> <p>The easiest way to take out Tail Glow Manaphy is to find something that outspeeds it and can hit it with a strong, super effective attack. Unless Manaphy is holding a Wacan Berry, Choice Scarf Zekrom will always OHKO Manaphy with Bolt Strike. Choice Scarf Dialga is the next best check to Manaphy, as it can outspeed and OHKO offensive Tail Glow Manaphy, while defensive Manaphy will fail to OHKO in return with Surf. Choice Scarf Kyogre and Palkia will also defeat Manaphy that lack Grass Knot. Arceus-Electric, Thundurus, and Shaymin-S can OHKO Manaphy with their super effective Thunder or Seed Flare, respectively, although Thundurus and Shaymin-S need a Life Orb or Choice Specs to do so. Because of this, Bulk Up mixed Dialga is an excellent teammate for Manaphy, as it resists both Grass- and Electric-type attacks while being able to lure out Groudon and KO it with a Draco Meteor. The Giratina formes and Ferrothorn are also great to take on the aforementioned Pokemon. Ground-type setup sweepers are also good to switch into Choice-locked Electric-type attacks, and these include Swords Dance Garchomp, Arceus-Ground, and Substitute + Hone Claws Dugtrio.</p>"

  "Darkrai": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting a blazing-fast base 125 Speed and a stellar base 135 Special Attack, Darkrai is one of the most potent sweepers present in Ubers. With access to Nasty Plot and a fantastic Dark STAB, this malevolent specter of darkness has quite a few tricks up its sleeve, more than enough to have its enemies shudder in fear. Its signature move, Dark Void, a sleep-inducing move with 80% accuracy, allows Darkrai to set up with extreme ease, and makes it very difficult to counter. Darkrai's ability, Bad Dreams, complements this well by causing enemy Pokemon to lose health slowly as they are asleep, breaking their Focus Sashes. In addition, Darkrai is one of the few Pokemon that Wobbuffet cannot touch, as Darkrai is immune to Mirror Coat. Indeed, Darkrai is sometimes known as the bane of stall teams, and for good reason. Darkrai's only true flaw is its average defenses, which allow it to be taken down by powerful neutral attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Darkrai can also run a physical Swords Dance set comprising of Sucker Punch, Brick Break, and Dark Void; this set has the advantages of immense surprise factor and STAB priority Sucker Punch. However, once Darkrai's set is revealed, it will be easily walled due to its meager base 90 Attack. Thunder allows Darkrai to destroy Ho-Oh and Kyogre, but has little use outside of that. Ice Beam is usable on the Choice Scarf set to revenge kill Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Salamence, as well as Choice Scarf Garchomp, and also does sizable damage to Zekrom, Groudon, and Arceus-Ground. Psychic is Darkrai's most powerful attack against Arceus-Fighting and Heracross, but has little use otherwise. Taunt can be used to prevent sleep absorbers from using Sleep Talk, rendering them incapable of countering Darkrai.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Darkrai is extremely difficult to counter directly, but there are certain ways by which it can be taken down. The best method to handle Darkrai is to let something absorb Dark Void, and then send in another Pokemon that is either faster or capable of surviving a boosted hit, and that can OHKO it. Sleep Talk users such as Kyogre and Heracross can absorb Dark Void, and do all of the above. Kyogre can take a +2 Dark Pulse and does 92.2% - 108.9% with Surf, a guaranteed OHKO after Life Orb recoil. Heracross resists both Dark Pulse and Focus Blast, and can hit Darkrai super effectively with either of its STAB moves. Heracross has the added benefit of Guts, which powers up its moves when it is inflicted with status. Arceus-Fighting and Ho-Oh can switch in on anything except Dark Void and OHKO Darkrai with Judgment or Brave Bird respectively. Once Sleep Clause has been activated, strong Choice Scarf users such as Palkia, Garchomp, Dialga, Kyogre, Reshiram, and Zekrom can revenge kill Darkrai with ease. Scizor can OHKO Darkrai with U-turn and survive all of its attacks bar a +2 Life Orb Focus Blast. Choice Scarf Terrakion can switch in on a Dark Pulse, grab a free potential Attack boost thanks to Justified, outspeed, and threaten an OHKO with its STAB Close Combat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This is the very set that propelled Darkrai to fame, or rather notoriety, last generation. Darkrai's stellar base 125 Speed and Dark Void's decent accuracy make pulling off a sweep very easy. The basic game plan is to switch into a Pokemon slower than Darkrai, put it to sleep with Dark Void, grab a Nasty Plot boost or set up a Substitute, and start sweeping. After a single Nasty Plot, Darkrai's Special Attack reaches a jaw-dropping 738, and Dark Pulse will dent anything not resistant to it. Focus Blast hits the Dark- and Steel-types that resist Dark-type attacks, most notably Tyranitar, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and opposing Darkrai. To put Darkrai's insane power into perspective, even Chansey is 2HKOed by Focus Blast after a Nasty Plot boost. Dark Pulse and Focus Blast have near-perfect coverage, resisted only by Heracross and Toxicroak. Substitute allows Darkrai to avoid crippling status, have a fighting chance against Sleep Talk users, and scout for its counters. Dark has good type coverage in Ubers, so a mono-attacking set without Focus Blast is extremely viable, although Darkrai will then easily be walled by Steel-type Pokemon and Blissey.</p> <p>This Darkrai set functions exceptionally well as a lead or late-game sweeper, and the choice of item depends heavily on the position the team needs Darkrai to fill. Lead Darkrai can utilize Focus Sash well, as it stops most support leads with Dark Void and can 2HKO Prankster Taunt users such as Thundurus with STAB Dark Pulse. Focus Sash Darkrai can also pull off a mini-sweep early-game when played correctly. Thanks to Bad Dreams, Darkrai does not have to worry about an opponent's Focus Sash. Leftovers is the preferred item with Substitute, as Life Orb recoil will drain Darkrai's health too quickly. However, it must be kept in mind that without Life Orb, Darkrai's damage output drops significantly.</p> <p>As the only way Darkrai can set up a Nasty Plot and sweep is by putting something to sleep, this set absolutely despises Sleep Talk users, particularly Heracross and Kyogre, as both can easily survive a boosted Dark Pulse and KO back with a STAB move. Giratina-O and Calm Mind Giratina thus make good partners for Darkrai as both can check and set up on the aforementioned threats. Giratina has the further advantage of checking Extreme Killer Arceus and Choice Scarf Terrakion, both of which threaten Darkrai with priority or by virtue of greater Speed, respectively.</p> <p>It is nearly impossible to beat Darkrai without sacrificing a Pokemon to sleep, but once Sleep Clause has been activated, Darkrai becomes infinitely less threatening. One of the best ways to take out Darkrai is to let it put a Pokemon to sleep, then switch to a faster teammate to revenge kill it. Mewtwo, Shaymin-S, and Choice Scarf users such as Palkia, Kyogre, Dialga, Terrakion, Reshiram, and Zekrom are all great choices to revenge kill Darkrai. Darkrai also hates powerful users of priority attacks, such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Scizor. If one prefers a more defensive approach, Ho-Oh can survive a boosted Dark Pulse and OHKO with Brave Bird; Arceus-Fighting can do the same with Judgment. If Darkrai lacks Focus Blast, almost all Steel-types can wall it easily.</p> <p>Wobbuffet makes a good partner to Darkrai as it not only has Encore to give Darkrai many setup opportunities, but can also revenge kill Choice Scarf users easily thanks to Shadow Tag. Arceus-Grass and Palkia are both good checks to Kyogre as they can switch in on Surf or Water Spout and threaten Kyogre with super effective attacks. Water Absorb Quagsire also fears nothing from Kyogre, and can use a combination of Encore and Toxic to wear it down. Zekrom can check Kyogre and Ho-Oh too, as neither of them dares take a STAB Bolt Strike. Ironically, defensive Kyogre also does a good job in checking Ho-Oh. Stealth Rock is possibly the best way to beat Ho-Oh; in general, entry hazard support is very much recommended to aid Darkrai in its sweep. Forretress and Deoxys-S make good partners as they can both set up entry hazards quite reliably. Magnezone and Groudon can be used to check Steel-types if Darkrai lacks Focus Blast; Mewtwo also makes a good teammate as it can decimate Arceus-Fighting with Psystrike.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to take care of Darkrai's chronic problems with faster revenge killers. This set works best as a lead, as every non-Choice Scarf Pokemon is outsped and crippled by a combination of Trick and Dark Void; Darkrai can then proceed to set up with Nasty Plot and start a sweep. Thanks to Darkrai's monstrous base 135 Special Attack and its great coverage, STAB Dark Pulse packs a real punch, even when resisted. Darkrai can also come in later in the game to pose a threat to the opponent's team. It must be noted that although Trick can completely ruin one of your opponent's Pokemon, it must be used very carefully. Using Trick carelessly on a Pokemon that is immune to it, such as Arceus, or on an opposing Choice user will only give the surprise away. In order to avoid such situations, try to refrain from using Trick on common Choice users, until and unless it can be confirmed that the particular Pokemon is holding some other item.</p> <p>As with Nasty Plot Darkrai, Choice Scarf Darkrai works well as a lead or a late-game sweeper. With a Choice Scarf, Darkrai outspeeds the omnipresent Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A leads. Darkrai can then put them to sleep with Dark Void, cripple them with Trick to lock them into one attack, or attack them directly with a STAB Dark Pulse. Additionally, Choice Scarf Darkrai is especially useful in taking down fast sweepers such as Adamant Rock Polish Groudon, or Choice Scarf users such as Palkia and Zekrom.</p> <p>Focus Blast can be used to take out Steel-types such as Dialga, Heatran, and Tyranitar, while Ice Beam lets Darkrai maul the ubiquitous Dragon-types in Ubers, and also has good coverage with Dark Pulse. Spacial Rend has slightly more power than Ice Beam, as well as a nifty critical hit rate. Moreover, Spacial Rend has the added advantage of hitting Palkia--a common Choice Scarf user--super effectively.</p> <p>Even though Choice Scarf Darkrai is a fantastic anti-lead, it still has problems with certain leads. Lum Berry leads that are capable of OHKOing Darkrai, such as Dialga, Kyogre, and Scizor, are this set's biggest threats. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S can outspeed Darkrai and 2HKO it with Air Slash, while Extreme Killer Arceus and Scizor can threaten Darkrai with their powerful priority moves, with the latter also resisting Dark Pulse. Jolly Rock Polish Groudon can outspeed Darkrai after a boost and OHKO it with STAB Earthquake; similarly, Choice Scarf Mewtwo can outspeed and smack Darkrai with Aura Sphere, which OHKOes it.</p> <p>Shaymin-S and Scizor can easily be beaten by Dialga, Reshiram, and Ho-Oh. All of them have access to Fire-type moves and resistances to Shaymin-S's or Scizor's STAB attacks. Dialga and Reshiram have to be wary of a super effective Life Orb Earth Power from Shaymin-S, however. Quagsire can easily switch into lead Kyogre and use the turn to do whatever it pleases. Palkia and Arceus-Grass will dislike Thunder Wave, but are otherwise great switch-ins as well, as they can dent Kyogre with Thunder or Grass Knot. Groudon can easily take on Terrakion and Tyranitar, check Dialga, and set up Stealth Rock to facilitate a sweep. Mewtwo can annihilate Arceus-Fighting with Psystrike, while Wobbuffet can help create an opening for Darkrai, thanks to Shadow Tag, Encore, and Tickle, and thus help it sweep. Last but not least, entry hazards help Darkrai greatly as they soften up potential checks to Darkrai and discourage the opponent from switching frequently.</p>"
      },
      "Double Status": {
        "description": "<p>This set draws its inspiration from, of all Pokemon, Butterfree and its double powder combination. This set works by first putting the opposing Pokemon to sleep using Dark Void, as is to be expected from Darkrai. At this point, your opponent should most likely switch out, because staying in would mean Darkrai can set up a Nasty Plot or a Substitute. By using Thunder Wave the following turn, Darkrai can cripple two Pokemon on your opponent's team. This set works because Darkrai's common switch-ins are Choice Scarf wielders looking for a revenge kill, such as Palkia, Kyogre, and Genesect, as well as priority users, such as Extreme Killer Arceus.</p> <p>For the remaining two moveslots and item, this set has a few options. Dark Pulse will always fill one of these two slots, as its power with STAB and its ability to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types for super effective damage is impossible to pass up. The last slot can be filled with either Focus Blast or Nasty Plot. Focus Blast offers Darkrai awesome coverage with Dark Pulse, especially against Steel-types such as Dialga and Ferrothorn, as well as any Terrakion that it caught with Thunder Wave. Nasty Plot gives Darkrai a tool to sweep late-game, once its counters have been paralyzed or put to sleep. Mono-Dark coverage, while not optimal, is still usable, but be sure to include a teammate such as Fire Punch Groudon to get rid of Steel-types such as Dialga and Forretress. The item choice depends on what Darkrai's main goal is. If you want Darkrai to spread as much status as possible, then Focus Sash gives it insurance against faster threats and Dark Void's shaky accuracy. If you want some extra power, such as guaranteeing the OHKO against Mewtwo with Dark Pulse, then Life Orb is the superior choice. Leftovers provides a bit of longevity, but due to Darkrai's general frailty, it is inferior to the other two items listed.</p> <p>Even though this set fills a more support-oriented role, its defenses are still too low for an all-out support spread, so the standard special attacker EV spread is the most effective. Maximum Speed investment takes advantage of Darkrai's blistering base 125 Speed stat, while max Special Attack investment allows it to hit as hard as possible. The extra Defense EV raises Genesect's Special Attack stat so that U-turn doesn't OHKO unless it has significant Attack investment; however, Bug Buzz will obviously OHKO Darkrai if Genesect carries it. This set pairs up well with slow, hard-hitters, such as Choice Specs Kyogre and Kyurem-W, and setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza. By paralyzing and weakening opposing Choice Scarf users, Darkrai provides its teammates a chance to sweep unhindered or use powerful attacks without being forced out by a faster threat.</p> <p>Although Darkrai is fairly self-sufficient, it still appreciates teammates that can cover its weak spots. As it is using two reflectable status moves, Xatu and Espeon can initiate a deadly guessing game with Darkrai, where the one that predicts wrong is as good as dead. Bulky Water-types such as RestTalk Kyogre and Manaphy also give Darkrai some problems, as they can take its attacks all day and are indifferent to Dark Void and Thunder Wave. Because of that, Zekrom is a good teammate as it can KO all of them with a powerful Bolt Strike. Entry hazards break Darkrai's Focus Sash, so try and keep them off the field if Darkrai is holding one. If you lack a way to clear the field of hazards, then leading off with Darkrai is the best way to keep its Focus Sash intact. Perhaps the best way for your opponent to foil this set is by not switching out after being put to sleep; this does not only wastes you a turn, but it also alerts your opponent of your strategy, which gives the opponent time to avoid it.</p>"

  "Shaymin-Sky": {
    "overview": "<p>Shaymin-S holds the title for being the first Pokemon to be unanimously banned from the OU tier. Whether it was existing bias in the form of \"60% = 100%\" (a reference to a 30% chance to flinch opposing Pokemon with Air Slash that is doubled by Serene Grace), or that it was just that good, Shaymin-S once again finds its home among the Uber Pokemon. Excellent base 127 Speed and decent base 120 Special Attack make this flying deer a solid choice offensively, especially because its ability, Serene Grace, abuses the side effects of Seed Flare and Air Slash to great effect. Unfortunately, Shaymin-S is still weak to Stealth Rock, although this matters less considering Shaymin-S's 100 / 75 / 75 defenses are hardly enough to shoulder the powerful moves in the tier anyway. Overall, Shaymin-S is very much the same Pokemon it was in DPP, causing rage quits since September 12, 2008.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shaymin-S has a few other options it can consider. A Swords Dance set is possible, as Shaymin-S has access to powerful physical moves in Seed Bomb and Return. Unfortunately, the rest of its physical movepool is barren. Hidden Power Rock is a viable alternative to other Hidden Power types for KOing Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock, 2HKOing Rayquaza, and 2HKOing opposing Shaymin-S, but has little added coverage outside of that. A Yache Berry allows Shaymin-S to bluff a Choice set and survive Ice Beam, but more powerful users of the move will OHKO Shaymin-S regardless. Lastly, our flying deer makes good use of Healing Wish due to its high Speed. This move can give a sweeper another chance to plow through the opposing team, especially after a counter to said sweeper is removed. However, this is generally situational, and may end up being an unneeded move in most matches.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory comfortably sponges Seed Flare and can retaliate with either Whirlwind or Brave Bird, provided it is not met with a Hidden Power Fire. Bronzong is a similar case, tanking both Seed Flare and Air Slash with ease, and can KO Shaymin-S with Gyro Ball. Ho-Oh, as long as it has a reasonable amount of health left, laughs at Air Slash and can KO back with either of its STAB moves or even Whirlwind Shaymin-S away. Arceus-Steel is another great choice to counter Shaymin-S, as it is bulky enough to take an Earth Power or two and has access to Recover and Roar.</p> <p>Choice Scarf users such as Dialga, Heatran, Jirachi, and Metagross can use their resistances to switch in and KO, making them great checks too. Pokemon with priority, such as Mamoswine and Scizor, bypass Shaymin-S's high Speed and maim it. Scizor must be careful, though, as after a Special Defense drop from Seed Flare, it will fall to Air Slash, because its Bullet Punch is unable to KO Shaymin-S even after Stealth Rock. Bisharp is another check in this priority category, as it is immune to flinching due to Inner Focus and can 2HKO Shaymin-S with Sucker Punch. Ferrothorn would be a great counter, but it is very susceptible to flinches from Air Slash, and Gyro Ball can only 2HKO. Likewise, Lugia and Latias can KO Shaymin-S with Ice Beam and Dragon Pulse, respectively, but must be wary of Seed Flare followed by Air Slash flinches.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Leech Seed": {
        "description": "<p>Shaymin-S can successfully employ the SubSeed strategy due to its extremely high Speed. In fact, it is outsped only by Jumpluff in the sun and Ludicolo in the rain, whereas Prankster Whimsicott has priority SubSeed. Fortunately, all three of these are relatively uncommon in Ubers, so the competition is virtually nil. While it may be tempting to use Whimsicott, remember that Shaymin-S has a great base 120 Special Attack, allowing it to take on a more offensive approach. As with all SubSeed strategies, one starts by switching in Shaymin-S to scare off certain whales or behemoths. Then, it can Substitute on the switch and begin to wreak havoc, alternating between Substitute and an attack after Leech Seed. Alternatively, Seed Flare can force switches, as the Special Defense drops cause plenty of fleeing for Shaymin-S to take advantage of. Air Slash fills the last slot to annoy any victim that stays in; its health will be slowly sapped by Air Slash, unable to fight back due to the excessive flinching. Hidden Power Fire and Earth Power are also options to hit Scizor and Dialga, respectively, but Air Slash's high flinch chance makes it too good to pass up.</p> <p>The EVs accentuate Shaymin-S's strong points, Special Attack and Speed. There is little use in investing in defenses, as by Uber standards, 100 / 75 / 75 is rather poor. A Timid nature takes advantage of Shaymin-S's unique Speed tier, ensuring it is not outsped by any Arceus or Darkrai; a Special Attack-boosting nature is less important because the offensive moves are used only for their secondary effects, not for damage output. Hidden Power Ice can surprise Dragon-types such as Rayquaza and Garchomp, but as mentioned, Shaymin-S will find it difficult to fit it onto its moveset.</p> <p>Tons of Pokemon aid Shaymin-S in endlessly annoying its opponents with SubSeed. Wobbuffet is especially notable, as it can prey on the Choice Scarf users that aim to take down speedy Shaymin-S. In addition, the blue blob can use Encore to give Shaymin-S a free opportunity to set up. Deoxys-S is another great partner, as it provides entry hazard support to whittle down the opponents' health from the number of switches the SubSeed strategy forces. Forretress also pairs well in this regard, providing Rapid Spin support and setting up Toxic Spikes to further wear down walls.</p> <p>Shaymin-S without Hidden Power Fire must be wary of Scizor, as its priority Bullet Punch bypasses Shaymin-S's high Speed. Skarmory also walls Shaymin-S lacking Hidden Power Fire, using Roost to heal off damage and phazing Shaymin-S out. Groudon provides necessary support to take these threats out. Rayquaza sets up on any set lacking Hidden Power Ice, outspeeding and destroying Shaymin-S after boosts from Dragon Dance. Likewise, Dialga will take advantage of any Shaymin-S set without Earth Power. Without a Special Defense drop provided by Seed Flare, both Calm Mind Giratina and Calm Mind Giratina-O have the potential to outstall Shaymin-S.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Shaymin-S becomes a great revenge killer, outspeeding the entire unboosted tier. It can also function as a lead, flinching threats such as Darkrai to death before they can even respond. Seed Flare is the main STAB attack, having the ability to neutralize switch-ins with a Special Defense drop. Air Slash complements this move very well, also receives STAB, and can KO opponents lacking a resistance simply through repeated flinches. Earth Power provides coverage against those that resist Seed Flare and Air Slash, namely Steel-types such as Dialga, Jirachi, and Metagross. Hidden Power Ice has the most utility on a Choice Scarf set, revenge killing other common Pokemon with a +1 boost such as Garchomp, opposing Shaymin-S, and Dragon Dance Salamence and Rayquaza.</p> <p>Leaf Storm is a more powerful alternative than Seed Flare right off the bat, and it is viable on a set that switches as often as this. However, it drops Shaymin-S's Special Attack by 2 stages, making additional hits very weak; repeated Seed Flares will most likely increase damage output due to the Special Defense drops it can inflict, too. Another way to augment power is with the nature. Modest is preferred for a revenge killing role, as Choice Scarf Shaymin-S outspeeds even Timid Choice Scarf Palkia. However, a Timid nature is viable if one prefers Shaymin-S to be a lead, as the extra Speed is needed to outpace Darkrai. Either way, it is a great check to standard Rock Polish Groudon, as even at +2, Groudon is outsped and OHKOed by Shaymin-S.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire is an option over Hidden Power Ice to incinerate Scizor, but this choice leaves Shaymin-S vulnerable to other Shaymin-S sets. Rapid Spin support is appreciated, as Choice Scarf Shaymin-S will most likely be switching constantly. Likewise, entry hazards support is appreciated to wear down opponents. Shaymin-S must watch out for Pokemon that resist Grass-type moves or have high Special Defense, such as Rayquaza, Dialga, and Latias, as they can come in and set up with ease. Mixed Dialga is thus a good teammate since it is able to deal with Blissey, Latias, Skarmory, and Swords Dance Rayquaza for Shaymin-S.</p>"
      },
      "Special Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>With excellent Special Attack and Speed stats even by Ubers standards, as well as a movepool that gives it good coverage, Shaymin-S makes a dangerous special sweeper. Seed Flare is what makes Shaymin-S so fearsome, as with Serene Grace there is a high chance of inflicting that Special Defense drop. After that, Shaymin-S can plow through the opponent or continue to assault the switch-in with its powerful attacks. One must be wary of spamming this move, however, as the prevalence of Pressure users means its PP could drop at an alarming rate. Air Slash is a secondary STAB move that has a great flinch chance, decimating switch-ins before they can even retaliate in conjunction with the Special Defense drops which Seed Flare can cause. Earth Power provides coverage on Steel-types such as Dialga, who resist both Seed Flare and Air Slash. However, this is hardly a problem if they have been inflicted with the Special Defense drops. The final slot is given to Hidden Power Fire, which KOes Scizor and Skarmory, both of whom 4x resist Seed Flare.</p> <p>A few other moves can work in the last slot as well. Hidden Power Ice is one option, KOing Lugia if it has already been hit with a Special Defense drop. This also applies to Latias, Giratina, and Giratina-O, who could otherwise take Hidden Power Ice with ease. On the other hand, Growth forgoes coverage and gives Shaymin-S the ability to boost its Special Attack instead of relying upon Seed Flare's Special Defense drops. While the Attack boost would be unhelpful for the most part, +1 in Special Attack will allow Shaymin-S to take down Pokemon it would otherwise fail to KO. This becomes more useful in the sun, as Growth will grant a +2 boost to Special Attack; Shaymin-S can then proceed to decimate weakened teams with its decent three-move coverage of Seed Flare, Air Slash, and Earth Power.</p> <p>The EVs are straightforward here, bolstering Special Attack and Speed to their maximum levels. Once again, a Timid nature is preferred over a Special Attack-boosting nature because of Shaymin-S's unique base Speed. The final 4 EVs are placed in Special Defense to ensure the maximal number of switch-ins to Stealth Rock. The IVs serve a very particular purpose, namely to reduce Life Orb recoil, allowing Shaymin-S to survive 11 whiplashes instead of 10. Speaking of items, Life Orb is preferred to maximize damage output, which is especially devastating in conjunction with Seed Flare's effect. However, Leftovers provides passive recovery to increase Shaymin-S's survivability, especially when used with Growth, as Shaymin-S will then be powering up itself and the extra power of Life Orb is secondary.</p> <p>The easiest way to take down Shaymin-S is with faster attackers. Priority easily KOes this frail flier, especially after Stealth Rock damage and Life Orb recoil, as it has no priority of its own to retaliate with. Furthermore, Scizor can Pursuit a fleeing Shaymin-S, ensuring that it will die to Stealth Rock the next time it switches in. Choice Scarf users are in the same boat, especially those that resist Seed Flare and Air Slash, such as Jirachi, Metagross, Heatran, and Dialga. Once again, Wobbuffet deals with these Choice-locked opponents, and can help Shaymin set up Growth with Encore. Ho-Oh walls Shaymin-S cold, as it can easily take Air Slash with its massive Special Defense. Groudon is a helpful partner, KOing most Steel-types with Earthquake and checking Ho-Oh to an extent.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>A Choice Specs set is a different take on Shaymin-S, affording it immediate power without the recoil of Life Orb. Seed Flare maims any switch-in that does not resist Grass-type moves, and even those that do pack a resistance must be wary of the Special Defense drops; if Shaymin-S outspeeds, the opponent will inevitably fall. Air Slash provides a second STAB move, and is especially great because of its 60% chance to flinch the opponent. Due to the fact that Choice Specs powers up Shaymin-S's special attacks, less Air Slash uses would be needed than without the boost, and thus there is a higher chance the opponent will be flinched to death before it can retaliate. Earth Power provides additional coverage, hitting the Steel-types that resist Grass- and Flying-type moves, such as Dialga and Jirachi. Hidden Power Ice rounds out the coverage, OHKOing Dragon-types such as Rayquaza and Garchomp; tread carefully around Choice Scarf variants of the latter, though, as they will outspeed and deal massive damage if not OHKOed.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire is an alternative in the last slot, as with it Shaymin-S will be able to beat Skarmory and Scizor. The EVs are distributed to maximize power and Speed, indicative of an offensive set; the last 4 EVs are placed in Special Defense to avoid an even HP stat, providing more switch-ins into Stealth Rock. The choice between a Modest and Timid nature depends on whether one wants the extra power afforded by the former or the extra Speed to get the jump on Darkrai and maximum Speed Arceus formes afforded by the latter. For example, Modest Choice Specs Seed Flare has a 58% chance to KO Blissey, provided the first Seed Flare inflicts the Special Defense drop. Such a feat is not possible with a Timid nature.</p> <p>Pokemon that can take a Seed Flare are generally the best counters to Shaymin-S. Blissey can stall it out with a combination of Wish and Protect, cripple it with Thunder Wave or Toxic, or deal massive damage with Ice Beam. Skarmory can either Whirlwind Shaymin-S or KO it with Brave Bird. Any Pokemon with a powerful STAB move can easily revenge kill Shaymin-S, such as Palkia and Kyogre. Wobbuffet is a good partner to deal with these threats. Ho-Oh is not afraid of any move Shaymin-S carries, and it can use its Fire- or Flying-type STAB to take out Shaymin-S. Ferrothorn and Bronzong can survive long enough against Seed Flare to 2HKO Shaymin-S with Gyro Ball.</p>"

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<p>Hailed as the Victory Pokemon, Victini may not seem very strong with only base 100 Attack. This little guy is not to be underestimated, however. The Movie 14 giveaway has brought to Victini two huge assets. The first is Bolt Strike, a drawback-free attack that allows Victini to zap any wayward Kyogre daring to rain on its parade. The second, and most important, is V-create. V-create is a move with staggering power—so powerful that, when backed by sun and STAB, it reaches an incredible 405 Base Power. Victini also boasts a fair number of other useful qualities, namely base 100 Speed, which is good enough to outpace most of the metagame, and solid bulk with 100 / 100 / 100 defenses. Victini also packs useful resistances to Psychic-, Fire-, Ice-, Grass-, and Fighting-type attacks, which makes it an excellent check to dangerous threats such as Mewtwo.</p> <p>However, not all of Victini's traits are positive. It is vulnerable to the dreaded Stealth Rock, which makes it somewhat difficult to switch in and out repeatedly. Victini is also shackled by weaknesses to Water-, Ground-, Rock-, Ghost-, and Dark-type attacks, which can make switching it in even more trying. It is also extremely reliant on sunny weather to provide the majority of its power. Despite this, Victini is still an amazingly powerful threat that can easily nuke teams at a moment's notice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although Victini has a ton of moves at its disposal, most of them either aren't worth it in the slightest or only have specific, situational uses. Victini has a pretty good special movepool, with Blue Flare, Searing Shot, Thunder, Grass Knot, Psyshock, Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast as viable options. However, it is usually outclassed at special attacking by Reshiram, who is far stronger than Victini on the special side and also possesses a far better secondary STAB. Flame Charge allows Victini to boost its Speed, but since V-create, its most powerful attack, lowers Speed, the boost is usually not useful. Work Up is Victini's only way to boost its offensive stats, but it is usually better off just attacking due to its raw power. Light Screen offers some protection against special attacks, but again, Victini should be using its time in battle to attack instead of trying to set up defensively due to its poor defensive typing. Zen Headbutt gets STAB and is Victini's best attack against Palkia and Reshiram, but the extra damage it does over a sun-boosted V-create is miniscule and has poor coverage otherwise.</p> <p>Taunt allows Victini to stop other Pokemon from trying to set up on it, but Victini's sheer offensive strength usually discourages set-up attempts. Substitute eases prediction and gives Victini a safety net against status moves. Victini can also make 101 HP Substitutes, which Blissey cannot break with a single Seismic Toss, but since Victini primarily uses physical attacks, it is usually suicide for Blissey or Chansey to stay in. Victini gets Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Will-O-Wisp as ways to support the team, but Victini has no recovery options (bar Rest) and many weaknesses, so it is not wise to play it as a defensive Pokemon. Finally, Final Gambit is an interesting option on the Choice Scarf set. Victini can reach 404 HP maximum, which will allow Victini to lure in and always KO some of its biggest checks—Tyranitar, Kyogre, Palkia, and Reshiram—without needing to predict at the cost of its life, provided Victini is at full HP. However, Victini's biggest enemies are Giratina and Giratina-O (to a lesser extent), who are both completely immune to Final Gambit, so more often than not the move will be useless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Despite Victini's amazing strength, it will still find itself hopelessly doomed when pitted against Giratina. The great beast can handle any and all of Victini's attacks and severely hurt it with Dragon Claw. Reshiram packs solid defenses and a quadruple resistance to Fire-type attacks while also resisting Electric-type attacks, meaning it switches in on Victini fairly well and can OHKO it with Draco Meteor. Palkia can do the same, although Bolt Strike will leave a huge dent in it, and both Palkia and Reshiram dislike taking repeated blows from V-create in the sun. Kyogre is able to come in on any attack not named Bolt Strike, cancel out the sun that is so vital to Victini's power thanks to Drizzle, and drown it with a mighty Surf. If Victini leaves home without Brick Break, Tyranitar and Heatran can come in with impunity and wreck Victini with strong super effective hits. Tyranitar is particularly dangerous since it can trap Victini with Pursuit, leaving the Victory Pokemon hopelessly lost. Giratina-O, although it absolutely hates taking sun-fueled V-creates, possesses STAB priority in Shadow Sneak to easily snipe Victini if need be.</p> <p>Finally, Victini loathes entry hazards. It will lose a quarter of its health every switch in while Stealth Rock is in play, and Toxic Spikes will cut its sweep short. Finally, V-create's nasty drawback of lowering Victini's Speed and defenses leave it vulnerable to being revenge killed by anything faster after it has used its signature attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Victini possesses several qualities that make it a fine user of a Choice Scarf. For one, it reaches an impressive 492 Speed when equipped with said item, allowing it to outpace any Pokemon slower than Jolly Rayquaza that has used Dragon Dance once. Victini's typing is also useful. It can switch into nearly every move the standard Mewtwo possesses except for the rarely used Shadow Ball and destroy it with a sun-boosted V-create. A Choice Scarf also allows Victini to retain a decent amount of Speed after a single use of V-create, possibly giving it a chance to cause some more damage. These qualities all make Victini a superb revenge killer that can take out menacing threats such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and most types of Arceus quite easily.</p> <p>V-create is Victini's move of choice—backed by harsh sunlight and STAB, it reaches a crippling 405 Base Power. This is enough to always OHKO 4 HP / 0 Def Mewtwo without any prior damage and cause insane amounts of damage to anything else that does not resist it. Bolt Strike strikes down Kyogre that are normally eager to come in on Victini, easily 2HKOing 4 HP / 0 Def variants and even OHKOing 87% of the time after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. U-turn is another incredibly useful move for Victini. With it, Victini can pepper its counters for a bit of damage, switch to a more suited ally, and maintain offensive momentum. Hidden Power Ice rounds off Victini's coverage nicely by enabling it to revenge kill Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Garchomp, as both take little damage from all of Victini's other moves. However, this leaves Victini without a consistent STAB move due to V-create's nasty drawback of lowering its defenses and Speed by one stage. For this reason, Flare Blitz can be used instead. Although much weaker than V-create, it is still quite powerful in the sunlight and can be used to clean up weakened teams nicely. That said, it is only recommended for use if your team has plenty of coverage against Rayquaza and Garchomp.</p> <p>The EVs are very basic, with Victini's Attack and Speed maximized for the best revenge killing potential. A Naive nature should be used if running Hidden Power Ice so as to not weaken the move. When not running Hidden Power Ice, a Jolly Nature should be used so Victini's defenses aren't needlessly lowered.</p> <p>When using Victini, don't ever leave home without Groudon. It provides the glorious sun, which is necessary for Victini's attacks to pack a stronger punch. Groudon can further help out Victini by setting up Stealth Rock, making revenge killing easier. Also, it counters Tyranitar, who otherwise comes in effortlessly and crushes Victini with its powerful STAB Crunch. As Victini is weak to all forms of entry hazards and will most likely be needing to switch quite a bit, Rapid Spin support will be necessary. Forretress is perfect for this role, as it can also set up more entry hazards to help Victini smash through enemies. It also baits Fire-type attacks more easily than a block of cheese baits a mouse, giving Victini some easy switch in opportunities.</p> <p>Victini is greatly troubled by foes that can take V-create without issue. Kyogre kills the sunlight with Drizzle and rains on Victini's parade with the threat of a STAB Surf. Palkia and Reshiram both 4x resist V-create, so they can easily hop in and blast Victini away with a STAB Draco Meteor. Trying to use Victini to break Giratina is like trying to beat down a truck with a toothpick—it won't happen. Giratina can tank Victini's hits all day while obliterating it with Dragon Claw. Giratina-O doesn't take V-create nearly as well as its bulkier cousin, but it possesses super effective STAB priority in Shadow Sneak to easily swat Victini away. Heatran's Flash Fire ability also allows it to take V-creates with no repercussions whatsoever. Furthermore, none of Victini's other moves will really hurt the giant lava beast. Palkia and Arceus-Grass are the premier answers to Kyogre—both can switch in fairly comfortably and blast it apart with super effective hits. Giratina and Giratina-O are also easily brought down with Dialga, who can switch in without difficulty and take the ghostly dragons apart with its own STAB Draco Meteor. Palkia and Reshiram are unfortunately difficult to handle, but Arceus-Rock can perform well against both of them. Palkia cannot KO it as the sun will weaken Palkia's STAB Water-type attacks, and Reshiram cannot win either unless it packs Focus Blast.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Although 448 Attack may not seem like much in Ubers, especially considering that Victini needs a Choice Band to reach such strength, the sheer might of V-create more than makes up for it. Backed by sun, V-create is so mighty that it stands a chance at OHKOing 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Groudon after it takes damage from Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes—quite impressive as Groudon is one of the most physically bulky Pokemon in the game. Even Palkia and Reshiram, who both 4x resist V-create, are always 2HKOed by V-create from this set after taking Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>As V-create is Victini's main form of offense, the other three moveslots are dedicated to taking down what V-create cannot. Bolt Stike OHKOes 4 HP / 0 Def Kyogre after it takes damage from Stealth Rock once and will 2HKO all other forms of the leviathan, while also leaving a huge dent in Palkia. U-turn is still useful for scouting out the nature of Victini's counters and for maintaining offensive momentum. Brick Break is strong enough to OHKO Tyranitar with no problems while also 2HKOing most variants of Heatran, who cannot outspeed Victini without a Choice Scarf. Flare Blitz is also present to have a consistent STAB attack, though the lack of Speed provided by a Choice Scarf coupled with recoil damage makes it a less useful sweeping option. Because of this, Brick Break is generally preferred.</p> <p>The only four things that can take a Choice Band-boosted V-create more than twice are Heatran, Tyranitar, Kyogre, and Giratina. Out of these, the first and second are wrecked by Brick Break, whereas the third is zapped off the planet by Bolt Strike, so only Giratina can reliably take on this set. Dialga once again works well, and Darkrai and Arceus-Dark are also fantastic Giratina counters. Palkia and Arceus-Grass are also recommended for dealing with Kyogre and Tyranitar. Palkia is also valuable against Heatran thanks to its STAB super effective Water-type attacks. Groudon and Forretress are also needed for reasons discussed in the Choice Scarf set.</p> <p>Palkia and Reshiram are still very dangerous as well. Although they can only switch in on Victini once if Stealth Rock is up, they can still handle the first attack and then blast Victini to pieces with Draco Meteor before it can make another move. Arceus-Rock backed with sun support is a solid answer to both of these threats.</p> <p>Playing with this set is a lot like using a real nuclear bomb. It is extremely powerful, but the fallout is very dangerous. In Victini's case, this fallout is the reduced defenses and Speed that come with Victini using V-create, so it is very prone to getting revenge killed by nearly everything. Pokemon that can take attacks that prey on its weaknesses to Water-, Ground-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Rock-type moves are necessary. Arceus-Grass handles Water-, Ground-, and most Rock-type attacks very well, Groudon doesn't care about any Rock-type, and Steel-types do well against Ghost- and Dark-type moves. Steel-types can also take Dragon-type moves such as Draco Meteor that Pokemon such as Reshiram and Palkia may use against it.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Victini often finds it difficult to actually sweep due to the Speed-centric Ubers metagame as well as V-create's unfortunate Speed drop side effect. However, these hindrances actually become advantages when Trick Room is brought into play. Although 100 base Speed seems fast for Trick Room, V-create's Speed drop actually works as a buff under this field effect. Combined with Victini's sheer power, it can easily wreck teams as well as support Trick Room teams very well.</p> <p>V-create is still Victini's go-to move for causing insane amounts of pain to its foes—things that are faster than Victini under Trick Room, such as Ferrothorn and Chansey, are obliterated by it, making them non-issues. Everything else not resisting it is utterly destroyed, and even Palkia and Reshiram are both 2HKOed after eating damage from Stealth Rock. Bolt Strike is once again there to wreck Kyogre's life, although this time Victini has the advantage of always outspeeding it under Trick Room. Brick Break stops Tyranitar from ruining the sweep while still 2HKOing Heatran, although without Stealth Rock damage, bulky Heatran sets can avoid the 2HKO with Leftovers.</p> <p>With 252 Attack EVs and a Brave nature, Victini reaches its maximum power. As Victini wants to be as slow as possible for Trick Room, a 0 IV in Speed as well as a speed reducing nature (Brave) is necessary. Victini reaches 403 HP with 248 EVs, giving it plenty of bulk and the ability to switch into Stealth Rock up to four times. The rest of the EVs go into Defense to protect Victini against priority attacks. Life Orb is the preferred item, as it affords Victini both massive power and the freedom to switch moves.</p> <p>The ideal partners for this set are Dialga, Palkia, and Groudon; all three of them work excellently in Trick Room. Groudon provides sunlight and can abuse Trick Room as well thanks to its sub-par Speed making it faster than nearly everything. Dialga can set up Trick Room reliably and plow through many of Victini's checks with its titanic hits. It can also cover all of Victini's weaknesses save Ground-type attacks. Palkia can set up and abuse Trick Room, and it has the added bonus of being able to come in easily on Kyogre. If enemy Palkia or Reshiram get a chance to come in and threaten Victini with Draco Meteor, Scizor and Bronzong are good choices to take the assault.</p>"

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill serves two main roles in the Uber tier. Firstly, with a high base 135 Attack and an ability that doubles its decent base 88 Speed in sandstorm, Excadrill is a terrifying sweeper. Swords Dance is the icing on the cake, pumping Excadrill's already high Attack stat to insane levels. Excadrill has the perfect typing for a sweeper too, being immune to both Thunder Wave and Toxic, while resisting Stealth Rock. Its concise movepool contains all it needs to sweep, allowing it to act as a decent offensive Rapid Spin user. Secondly, Excadrill possesses the bulk and typing to run a bulky spinner set in the rain. Its ability, Mold Breaker, allows it to smash the commonly used spinblocker, Giratina-O, with a powerful STAB Earthquake.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Excadrill has a rather shallow movepool, so it doesn't have many viable options outside of the ones mentioned. X-Scissor can be used over Shadow Claw to get a harder hit on Psychic-types and Arceus-Grass, but Excadrill loses precious coverage against Giratina-O. Toxic can also be used to cripple walls such as Lugia that laugh at most of Excadrill's moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory is the best defensive response to Excadrill, as it is immune to Earthquake and resists Excadrill's other STAB. It can then Roost off the damage if required or even phaze out Excadrill with Whirlwind. However, Skarmory can't hurt Excadrill back and has a good chance to be 2HKOed by a boosted Rock Slide after Stealth Rock. Bronzong resists or is immune to all of Excadrill's moves, and with an Earthquake of its own can check it easily. Bold Lugia can check Excadrill provided Stealth Rock is off the field. Giratina can just burn Excadrill and phaze it out, but loses if Excadrill gets a flinch from a boosted Iron Head, as it will then be KOed by Earthquake the next turn. Gliscor can check the mole thanks to Poison Heal, excellent physical bulk, and an immunity to Earthquake; however, it falls to a +2 Iron Head.</p> <p>Offensive Kyogre and Groudon can switch in and remove the sandstorm from play, negating Excadrill's Sand Rush ability. With enough investment in Speed, they can then proceed to destroy Excadrill with Surf or Earthquake, respectively. Rayquaza ignores Sand Rush thanks to Air Lock, and can OHKO Excadrill with Fire Blast or Earthquake. Arceus-Grass can survive a boosted Earthquake, and do 59-70% to Excadrill with Judgment or cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, but will lose if it gets flinched by Iron Head. Defensive Arceus, though rare, survives any attack from Excadrill, and can neuter it with Will-O-Wisp. Landorus-T is immune to Earthquake and has Intimidate; however, it still takes heavy damage from a +1 Iron Head. An opposing Excadrill with Air Balloon or a faster spread can revenge kill Excadrill with an Earthquake of its own, but +2 Iron Head still does a lot of damage, despite being resisted. Air Balloon Terrakion can set up a Rock Polish on Excadrill if it is not using Iron Head, and then outspeed and KO it the next turn. Choice Scarf Ditto can revenge Excadrill without Air Balloon; however, a Choice-locked Earthquake is very easy to predict and take advantage of.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<p>I know you're thinking that this is probably an April Fool's joke or something of that sort, but it isn't. Bulky Excadrill is quite the viable Pokemon in Ubers, and most players will agree that it is quite a bit more useful than its more offensive counterpart. Although Excadrill might seem terribly unsuited to the role of a bulky spinner, it has some extremely subtle advantages that help it perform well in this role. First of all is its incredible typing, which gives it an immunity to both Toxic and Thunder Wave, as well as a lovely Dragon-type resistance. In a metagame where Dragon-types are everywhere, this can be incredibly useful. Apart from that, Excadrill is surprisingly bulky and, though its Defense might seem lackluster, its invested special bulk is greater than that of Forretress, which is a popular spinner in Ubers. Lastly, it is an effective check to Pokemon that give most teams nightmares, such as Bulk Up Dialga, Giratina-O, Substitute + Hone Claws Zekrom, and Arceus-Dark. Excadrill can also shakily check Latias and Latios without Surf or Hidden Power Fire; however, a +1 Dragon Pulse 3HKOes Excadrill without fail.</p> <p>Furthermore, Excadrill is probably the only Rapid Spin user in Ubers capable of threatening stall, as few Pokemon on a standard stall team can beat it. However, Ferrothorn with Power Whip will give Excadrill trouble, as well as the omnipresent Kyogre. Groudon and certain support Arceus formes will also prove problematic for Excadrill. However, mixed Giratina-O, the most commonly used spinblocker, actually loses to Excadrill, because Hidden Power Fire will not even 3HKO Excadrill in rain, while Excadrill's boosted Earthquake can 2HKO back. Earthquake is the obligatory STAB move, hitting many threats hard off the bat. Swords Dance paired with Mold Breaker Earthquake allows Excadrill to bust through the aforementioned Giratina-O, and even leads to an occasional sweep. Rock Slide can also be used to hit Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, and Shaymin-S on the switch-in. Substitute with mono-type coverage is actually viable due to Mold Breaker, and should be considered if Excadrill's only goal is to spin; Substitute eases prediction, blocks Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp, and prevents Dragon Tail Giratina from phazing Excadrill out.</p> <p>The EV spread might look as unfathomable as the coefficients on the binomial theorem, but their main purpose is to balance out Excadrill's defenses. The leftover EVs are put mainly in Attack, with the tiny investment in Speed serving to outspeed uninvested base 90s, such as Kyogre.</p> <p>This set can also run Stealth Rock in the last slot, making Excadrill a decent offensive setter of the hazard. It also beats all Deoxys-S without Superpower and can set up Stealth Rock on the many switches that it forces. Mold Breaker also prevents Magic Bounce Pokemon from reflecting Stealth Rock. Iron Head can be used as a coverage move, but bulky Excadrill is too slow to make use of it properly.</p> <p>It must be noted that Excadrill is not meant to be used like a standard Uber sweeper. It has a distinctive niche and fills that particular niche quite well. Excadrill fills the role of a crucial offensive Rapid Spin user on a rain team. Although Excadrill really likes the boost to its Speed under sand, it has good synergy on a rain team thanks to its immunity to Thunder and ability to consistently spin away entry hazards. The rain also diminishes Excadrill's Fire-type weakness, allowing it to walk all over Giratina-O lacking Earthquake or Will-O-Wisp. Excadrill also destroys Bulk Up Dialga as well as most Zekrom variants, which can terrorize most rain teams. As Groudon laughs at all Excadrill can do and crushes it with Earthquake, Kyogre is extremely helpful as a teammate, because it scares off Groudon with powerful Water-type moves. Arceus-Grass is also helpful as it can check both Groudon and Kyogre. Latias can easily stomach a Water Spout from Kyogre, is immune to Earthquake, and has Dragon Pulse to wreck Groudon after a Calm Mind. Apart from these, most offensive Pokemon commonly used on rain teams enjoy Excadrill's spinning prowess, especially Choice Scarf users such as Palkia, because they can keep flitting in and out of battle without having to worry about residual damage piling up.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>After a Swords Dance, Excadrill reaches a mammoth 738 Attack with a Jolly nature, or 810 with Adamant. Thanks to its excellent ability, Excadrill's Speed doubles in sandstorm, allowing it to outspeed every non-Choice Scarf user in the game. If using a Jolly nature, Excadrill hits 604 Speed, while with Adamant, it sits at an impressive 550 Speed, still enough to outspeed Deoxys-S, the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the game.</p> <p>A +2 STAB Earthquake will dent anything not resisting it, and even support Groudon takes a hefty 61.6% - 72.8% from Jolly Excadrill, a sure 2HKO. Rock Slide hits all Pokemon resistant to Ground-type moves, with the notable exception of Bronzong. The last move is mainly filler and depends on what Excadrill wants to hit. Iron Head is the primary option, as it can OHKO Giratina-O at +2 if it does not invest in bulk, and it also provides a strong neutral move to use against Gliscor and Arceus-Grass. Rapid Spin can also go in the last slot as Excadrill makes a fantastic offensive Rapid Spin user, its Steel typing giving it a natural immunity to Toxic Spikes and a resistance to Stealth Rock, and Air Balloon granting it immunity to Spikes. Shadow Claw can be used if bulky Giratina-O is a concern, but even when boosted it can only get the KO on those that only invest in HP, not Defense.</p> <p>The EV spread is meant to maximize Excadrill's Attack and Speed, while the leftover EVs are put in HP. Air Balloon allows Excadrill to switch into Choice-locked Ground-type attacks as well as Gliscor and set up a Swords Dance on the switch. On the other hand, Life Orb grants Excadrill a significant amount of power at the cost of 10% recoil damage. It must be noted that Excadrill can only 2HKO Groudon with a boosted Earthquake if equipped with a Life Orb. Adamant is the preferred nature, as it allows Excadrill to do insane amounts of damage after only a single Swords Dance. Adamant also allows Excadrill to perform as an amazing revenge killer under sandy conditions. However, while using Air Balloon, Jolly is the preferred nature as Excadrill loses several important KOs without Life Orb anyway, such as the KO on Darkrai after Stealth Rock. Substitute can easily go over one auxiliary move to make Dragon Tail Giratina setup bait as well as ease prediction when setting up. A Lum Berry can be used to absorb Will-O-Wisp once and power through several defensive checks that rely on this method to stop Excadrill. X-Scissor can also be used to check Arceus-Grass, but its use besides that is pretty situational as it only hits Psychic Pokemon for 10 Base Power harder than a STAB Earthquake, and +2 Iron Head disposes of Latias easily.</p> <p>As Excadrill absolutely needs sandstorm to sweep, Tyranitar is a necessity. It sets up the precious sandstorm, and when equipped with a Choice Band, it can check quite a lot of Pokemon, such as Giratina-O, thanks to its fantastic Dark-type STAB. Arceus-Grass can check Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, and Arceus-Ground easily, and therefore makes a good teammate. Lastly, Stealth Rock support is much desired, because it allows Excadrill to OHKO 252/0 Kyogre after a boost, and stops Lugia from checking it. Deoxys-S and Tyranitar can both set up Stealth Rock reliably. Hippowdon can also be paired with Excadrill, as the more defensive of the two Sand Streamers has much greater longevity. Hippowdon also beats Groudon, which Excadrill and Tyranitar both struggle with. Hippowdon is also a decent check to Extreme Killer Arceus and Zekrom, and can also set up Stealth Rock. Wobbuffet can be used to help Excadrill set up, and use Tickle on Giratina for Tyranitar to Pursuit it. However, Wobbuffet does not appreciate the residual damage from sand. Mixed Zekrom, Rayquaza, and mixed Bulk Up Dialga can lure opposing Groudon and smash it, opening up a sweep for Excadrill.</p>"

  "Accelgor": {
    "overview": "<p>Having a good lead is vital in BW Ubers, and Accelgor is a strong contender for this role. With an insane base 145 Speed stat, a solid STAB Bug Buzz that frightens opposing lead Darkrai, and the ability to force switches with Yawn, Accelgor can set Spikes versus nearly all teams. Unfortunately, this is about where Accelgor's utility ends. Due to stats that are generally weak by Ubers standards, it is unable to function as anything besides a suicide lead, making it quite challenging to justify on anything except offensive teams. Even as an entry hazard setter, Accelgor faces competition in Ubers. Lack of access to Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes might make it challenging to justify over competing suicide leads like Deoxys-S and Custap Berry Forretress. The fact that some Pokemon, such as Magic Coat Giratina-O and Deoxys-A, completely shut it down, too, also might make a different suicide lead like Cloyster or Rocky Helmet Deoxys-S a better alternative in some instances. Regardless, when slotted on the right team, Accelgor is a very competent Spikes user sure to disrupt the opponent's play.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Accelgor can run a variety of moves in its last slot. Quick Attack is reserved solely for limiting Deoxys-S to a single layer of entry hazards, which, though generally less useful than generating momentum, is still a valuable thing for some teams. Encore can shut down spinners attempting to anti-lead Accelgor, assuming they use an attacking or hazard-setting move first. Knock Off can bother Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Dialga, that may wish to anti-lead Accelgor. Though incredibly situational, Baton Pass may be used over U-turn to escape a lead Tyranitar's Pursuit. Accelgor, too, can run Pursuit to catch Pokemon like Froslass and Deoxys-S that may switch out of Yawn, but this requires prediction, and U-turn capitalizes on these switches anyway while having more overall use. Gastro Acid can perhaps enable Accelgor to set Spikes on Xatu, but this too requires correct prediction and is redundant with Bug Buzz versus Espeon, BW Ubers's other Pokemon with Magic Bounce. Accelgor can attempt to run Final Gambit with maximum HP investment; using this turn one versus a slow attacker enables Accelgor to OHKO or nearly OHKO most of Ubers but at the cost of Accelgor's life and a layer of Spikes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Xatu is Accelgor's best counter, easily Roosting off any Bug Buzz damage and endlessly bouncing back attempts to Yawn or set Spikes. Magic Coat support Arceus-Ghost resists Accelgor's Bug Buzz and indefinitely prevents Spikes and Yawn. Magic Coat Giratina-O cannot use Recover to negate Bug Buzz chip damage, but it still easily walls Accelgor and has a great chance of surprising Accelgor by bouncing back Spikes. Choice Scarf Garchomp can outpace Accelgor and OHKO it with Dual Chop through Focus Sash. Choice Scarf Darkrai can surprise Accelgor, rendering it useless with a fast Dark Void. Lum Berry Extreme Killer Arceus can actually Swords Dance on Accelgor and threaten its team right out of the gate with +2 Extreme Speed without fearing Yawn. Lead Tyranitar fears Bug Buzz but still can OHKO Accelgor through its Focus Sash with sand damage; Lum Berry variants are particularly untroubled by Accelgor. Though Bug Buzz will almost certainly bring Cloyster down to its Focus Sash, it still easily dispatches of Accelgor through its Focus Sash with Icicle Spear and can limit Spikes with Rapid Spin. Deoxys-A outpaces Accelgor and can Extreme Speed it for an easy KO after knocking it down to its Focus Sash, but it fears Yawn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set represents Accelgor's only viable role. It easily sets Spikes to prevent threats like Genesect, Palkia, and Darkrai from switching too much. Yawn is a very effective way to ward off Pokemon that otherwise might anti-lead Accelgor, such as Cloyster and Deoxys-A, by threatening sleep. Bug Buzz is a powerful STAB move that primarily hits Darkrai and Deoxys-S. Due to Accelgor's tendency to force switches, U-turn can often effectively generate early-game momentum and score early chip damage with Spikes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Accelgor's best ability is Unburden, which lets it outpace even Choice Scarf Deoxys-S after losing its Focus Sash. Its EVs are simple. Special Attack is maximized to deal as much damage to Darkrai as possible, with Speed maximized to outpace nearly everything in Ubers that lacks a Choice Scarf or some other Speed boost. The remaining 4 EVs are thrown in Attack because investing in Accelgor's bulk can be detrimental. This also is why its IVs are minimized: to trigger Unburden and make Accelgor faster than everything in Ubers, it must be knocked down to 1 HP. 3 SpD IVs are used so that 4 SpA Deoxys-S's Dark Pulse will only 3HKO. A Naive nature further reduces Accelgor's bulk by lessening its Special Defense, which is a fair bit higher than its Defense. The Speed boost a Naive nature also grants lets Accelgor outpace neutral-natured Choice Scarf Kyogre and Zekrom before Unburden.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even though Accelgor's main purpose is setting Spikes, the move it should use first in most scenarios is Yawn. This is because Accelgor's Yawn forces out nearly all Pokemon that lack Sleep Talk, and gaining momentum from Yawn plus a guaranteed layer of Spikes versus anything that isn't a Xatu, a spinner, or a Pokemon with priority tends to be better than two layers of Spikes. After Accelgor uses Yawn, it should set a layer of Spikes in nearly all instances, except those where the momentum of U-turn is more desirable than guaranteed chip damage on some of the opponent's team. U-turn is generally used to punish misplays; if Accelgor is able to secure a layer of Spikes with an unbroken Focus Sash, it can easily punish the opposition with a Yawn followed by a U-turn. This lets Accelgor get easy momentum while preserving it as death fodder for later. Bug Buzz should only be used versus Focus Sash Pokemon your team is weak to or Bug-weak Pokemon.</p> <p>One particularly important Bug-weak lead Accelgor may run into is Deoxys-S. If Accelgor opts to run Quick Attack, this matchup is relatively straightforward: first, use Bug Buzz to bring Deoxys-S down to its Focus Sash, then Quick Attack to finish it off should Deoxys-S use a move that doesn't directly damage Accelgor. Even if the opponent switches to a different Pokemon to absorb Accelgor's Quick Attack, it still should be able to Yawn and set Spikes. If Deoxys-S instead attacks Accelgor and it is brought down to its Focus Sash, it's better to use Bug Buzz than Quick Attack if desiring a dead Deoxys-S so as to avoid potential Rocky Helmet damage KOing Accelgor. If Accelgor doesn't run Quick Attack, however, this matchup is less favorable. Accelgor should always Bug Buzz first versus Deoxys-S to break its Focus Sash; though Yawn may be tempting, the opponent will still secure Stealth Rock and Spikes with Deoxys-S and have it to fodder later, which isn't desirable. If Deoxys-S sets Stealth Rock and Spikes as Accelgor attacks twice, you should be okay; Accelgor and the Stealth Rock user it's paired with can equalize entry hazards with the opponent, with you having a slight advantage due to Accelgor forcing the foe to switch via Yawn. If Deoxys-S attacks once, bringing Accelgor down to its Focus Sash, and sets Stealth Rock, Accelgor's user must make a judgment call as to whether it would prefer to KO Deoxys-S or secure a guaranteed layer of Spikes. In the unlikely event that Deoxys-S attacks Accelgor and doesn't bring it down to its Focus Sash, it may be wise to switch out Accelgor and save it for a time where it may secure Spikes more easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Good Accelgor teammates appreciate its ability to set Spikes. Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O are its best teammates; both appreciate Spikes's capacity to limit the switches of checks like specially defensive Kyogre and Darkrai. Both also prevent Pokemon like Forretress and Excadrill from coming in and spinning Accelgor's hazards away. Other solid partners tend to force lots of switches; Pokemon like Latios and Kyogre are good teammates because they either Roar the foe out or just slam it with powerful attacks. Due to its lack of longevity, Accelgor fits best on offensive teams. This makes it logical to pair it with offensive Pokemon like Darkrai, Mewtwo, Genesect, and Rayquaza. Because Accelgor lacks Stealth Rock, teams must use another Pokemon to set it. Bulky Stealth Rock setters that fit on offense are typically preferred, given their ability to survive a hit should a Pokemon affected by Yawn choose to attack instead of switching. Groudon and Dialga are great candidates for this, especially since they can Dragon Tail or Roar the opponent's Pokemon to rack up even more entry hazard damage.</p>"

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>Feast your eyes on one of the best Choice Scarf users in the Ubers metagame. A very reliable revenge killer that doubles as a dangerous late-game cleaner, Terrakion is not to be underestimated. Its above average Speed and Attack carry it a long way, but what really makes it shine is its amazing STAB moves. Close Combat and Stone Edge are all Terrakion ever needs, which makes him the king of filler moves and opens up all sorts of different set options. Although you won't see much else than its trademark Choice Scarf set, Terrakion is still capable of being a diverse offensive threat, with sets ranging from Choice Band to Stealth Rock lead. Terrakion is far from perfect, though, as it's on the fragile side, and has a ton of common weaknesses that undermine its very average bulk. Ghost-types also serve as a perpetual roadblock to all of its sets and make that final cleanup something you'll have to work for.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute with Swords Dance isn't very viable anymore now that Giratina runs Roar to avoid being setup fodder for Ho-Oh. Liechi Berry and Salac Berry are too weak to clean up any better than the Double Dance or Choice Scarf variants and only have one shot at doing so, while leaving Terrakion vulnerable to even resisted priority. X-Scissor does a bit more damage to Psychic-types than Stone Edge and doesn't risk a miss, but outside of the Choice Scarf variant, it is largely non-viable as it requires dropping superior filler options and involves being Choice-locked into a very poor move on top of being completely prediction-based. It is also unlikely that the intended targets will even attempt to directly switch into Terrakion rather than attempt to revenge kill. Double Kick is another interesting move for Choice Scarf Terrakion to OHKO Smeargle past its Focus Sash. However, it is completely useless besides this single target, as even Deoxys-A has enough bulk to avoid the OHKO.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ghost-types, such as Arceus-Ghost, Giratina, Giratina-O, and even Sableye are massive pains for Terrakion, especially the Choice Scarf variant, which is by far its most common set. All of the listed Pokemon are not bothered at all by the stronger and more reliable of its two STAB moves, Close Combat, while the first three have a enough natural bulk to shrug off Stone Edge. Bulky Ground-types, such as Groudon, Hippowdon, and Arceus-Ground, resist Stone Edge and can tank Close Combat easily with defensive investment. The Ground / Flying types, Gliscor and Landorus-T, resist Close Combat while typically having significant enough defensive investment such that Stone Edge is not an issue for them either. Gliscor is special in that it actually benefits from Terrakion's Toxic rather than being crippled by it thanks to its ability, Poison Heal. Other assorted Pokemon that resist Rock- or Fighting-type attacks can be used with prediction as Terrakion is often Choice-locked. Although uncommon, Scizor's Bullet Punch and Kabutops's Aqua Jet are the two viable priority attacks that hit Terrakion for super effective damage. Sand Rush Excadrill, Swift Swim Kingdra, and very fast but rare Choice Scarf users such as Mewtwo and Shaymin-S can revenge kill even a Choice Scarf Terrakion. Rock Polish Terrakion, however, can only be stopped by priority attacks or defensive checks once it has attained the boost.</p> <p>Although Terrakion can do a lot, it can't do it all at once. Either it will be really fast with a Choice Scarf or Rock Polish but a lot weaker and have to work for OHKOs or it will be very strong with a Choice Band or Swords Dance but not very fast. Once you know the set it is using it's a lot easier to play around, since it lacks the bulk to survive most attacks, meaning if it fails to KO its opponent, it will be the one to be KOed.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Terrakion is the fastest commonly seen Pokemon in the Ubers metagame, ignoring the weather sweepers Kingdra and Excadrill. This exceptional speed, on top of its sturdiness against common priority, such as Extreme Speed, greatly helps make Terrakion such an effective cleaner. It's also a reliable revenge killer, being able to hit the majority of the metagame hard with one of its STAB moves and is even one of the few Pokemon that can claim to revenge kill the infamous Extreme Killer Arceus through its resistance to Normal-type attacks and super effective Close Combat.</p> <p>For the most part, this set is made up of Terrakion's two strong STAB choices, Close Combat and Stone Edge, with the rest being filler options. Toxic is an appealing choice to cripple common switch-ins such as Arceus-Ghost and Groudon. Sleep Talk is an alternative to Toxic if you would rather your Terrakion serve as a sleep absorber for Darkrai, which is effective, although it's disappointing to lose control over your moves. Rock Slide is for when you want a higher chance to hit with your Rock STAB and even has a tasty flinch chance to disrupt things like lead Deoxys-S. Sacred Sword is another option if you need a way to bypass the last straggling Bulk Up Dialga or increase the odds of selecting a Fighting STAB with Sleep Talk.</p> <p>You want your Terrakion to hit as fast and hard as possible, while having the remaining 4 EVs in Defense so that Genesect has a weaker U-turn and Iron Head in case you decide to switch out or stay in to eat the hit. As appealing as it may be, an Adamant nature is not an option as Terrakion then loses the ability to outspeed other very common Choice Scarf users like Genesect. X-Scissor has the benefit of hitting Psychic-types like Latias and Mewtwo for a tad more than Stone Edge and doesn't risk missing, but it's a terrible move to lock yourself into. You can even go so far as to not run a fourth move at all if you prefer to always choose one of Terrakion's strong STAB moves with Sleep Talk.</p> <p>The first thing you need to do if you plan on cleaning is get Ghost-types out of the way, or at least in range of a Stone Edge KO. You'll also have to soften up the resists to whichever STAB you aim to finish the game with, although it'll mostly be the Fighting-type resists you want gone, since Close Combat is stronger and more accurate than Stone Edge. Entry hazards are an excellent way to accomplish this by racking up passive damage and limiting the number of times they can switch in. It's worthwhile to pack a switch-in to the Ground-types that can stomach Stone Edge, such as Groudon, as well as something for those Ghost-types that will giggle at Close Combat. Giratina-O does a fine job of handling most Ground-types as well as spinblocking so that entry hazards stay up to wear them down. Just about anything with meaty special bulk and no weakness to Ghost- or Fighting-type attacks can be used to keep Arceus-Ghost in line. Giratina is relatively easy to switch into as long as you have something that doesn't mind burn. Giratina-O is the trickiest to handle because Dragon Tail hurts and forces the switch-in out, so try to keep hazards off the field, pack multiple things that can force it out to increase your chances that one of them gets dragged in, and use something that can put up with multiple Dragon Tails and the potential Earthquake, such as Skarmory. Pokemon such as Darkrai and Palkia with super effective STAB attacks against common switch-ins to Terrakion are good for double switching.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Terrakion can support the team with an effective Stealth Rock lead set. This set takes advantage of Terrakion's offensive presence to create free turns to setup the crucial Stealth Rock. The offensive pressure also makes it difficult for opposing Rapid Spin users to remove the entry hazard and allows Terrakion to be conserved for later to function as a mid-game attacker.</p> <p>Terrakion's trusty STAB combination is all it needs for offense, as it is strong and has excellent coverage. This variant is designed to lead and support the team, so Stealth Rock is a natural choice. Taunt is a great move to have in the Ubers metagame and doubly so on something as weak to Giratina as Terrakion, although Dragon Tail variants are still annoying. It also helps stop other Stealth Rock and Spikes setters from getting to lay their entry hazards down at the same time.</p> <p>Fist Plate allows Terrakion to OHKO lead Dialga, any Tyranitar variant, and Ferrothorn, along with 2HKOing Forretress switch-ins. Focus Sash is useful if you want Terrakion to be a dedicated lead and simplify setting up Stealth Rock or score an extra hit, but the power drop in comparison to Fist Plate is noticeable. Quick Attack can be used to limit Deoxys-S leads to a single layer of entry hazards in which case you should use a Life Orb in order to maintain the benefits of Fist Plate while also ensuring that you 2HKO Deoxys-S with Stone Edge and Quick Attack.</p> <p>The goal of this set is to support the rest of the team, so it doesn't need any special support for itself. All the same, a Ghost-type is appreciated, as Terrakion isn't a sturdy Stealth Rock setter and may no longer be around once Stealth Rock is spun away. There are certain leads that Terrakion can not beat, such as Darkrai in general, or Deoxys-S if Terrakion doesn't run Quick Attack, so Pokemon that have a favorable match-up against them, such as Choice Scarf Genesect and Giratina-O, will be needed. These Pokemon can also serve as switch-ins to common Terrakion checks, as Giratina-O can handle bulky Ground-types like Groudon while most defensive checks to Darkrai, such as Ho-Oh or Kyogre, can also check Arceus-Ghost.</p>"
      },
      "Double Dance": {
        "description": "<p>When all the coverage you need can be summed up with two high-powered STAB attacks, it's clear that a double dance set becomes viable. Double dance Terrakion adapts to the opposing team type and situation through using the appropriate boosting move. This set's effectiveness is further boosted by Terrakion's natural resistance to common priority attacks, thus easing its attempts to sweep. Don't feel obligated to click a boosting move at every chance you get, as even an unboosted Terrakion is dangerous. This set functions at its best when biding its time for the ideal moment.</p> <p>Running both Close Combat and Stone Edge is standard fare for Terrakion and this set won't leave you wanting for any other coverage options or fillers thanks to the two setup moves it has. Swords Dance is used when you want Terrakion to bust through defensive cores on balanced or stall teams. You will want to click Rock Polish for offensive or balanced teams that you have managed to weaken and are ready for cleanup.</p> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item due to the slew of key KOs it secures, such as Substitute shuffler Giratina-O, Latios, Wobbuffet, and Gliscor, as well as for the general extra punch, especially to Ghost-types. Fist Plate is an acceptable alternative as it still gets many important KOs, saves HP, and fakes a Choice set. Air Balloon is another item choice that allows Terrakion to mess with Pokemon like Groudon, Hippowdon, and Earthquake Extreme Killer Arceus. Taunt can be used over a boosting move to be more flexible with Rock Polish sweeps or as a really dedicated wallbreaker when used alongside Swords Dance.</p> <p>This set appreciates entry hazard support to help up setup Rock Polish cleanups or wallbreak with Swords Dance, but doesn't need it as much as the Choice Scarf variant. If you are adamant about using Terrakion's setup moves, dual screens and/or Wobbuffet support is useful to help buy you those free turns. Wobbuffet is doubly useful because of the ease with which it traps Mewtwo and Choice Scarf users, thus easing Terrakion's need to use Rock Polish. Thunder Wave support, from Pokemon such as Arceus-Grass or Kyogre, is also effective at slowing the opposing team down so that you can click Swords Dance instead of Rock Polish. Otherwise, this set is very flexible so it's nice to have a flexible team around it. Pokemon that can switch into common checks are worth having so that Terrakion can act as a early or mid-game attacker. Using lures or teammates whose checks overlap with Terrakion's helps to weaken a team for a late-game Rock Polish cleanup.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>This is Terrakion's least flexible set, as it's Choice-locked and slow compared to the others but it makes up for these drawbacks with raw power. It doesn't have to waste any time boosting up to crush things and it's fairly fast in the Ubers metagame. Unlike other Choice Band users, Terrakion always has a safe option, since both its STAB moves are strong attacks with little drawbacks. They are once again the heart of the set with the filler options being even more situational because of the extra strength and lack of Speed. Quick Attack is surprisingly the most useful of its remaining options, as the extra punch from Choice Band barely gives it a relevant amount of power, so it's helpful to have the utility of priority for a slower set. Rock Slide is always nice to have since Stone Edge can choose to miss at the most inopportune moments. Toxic is exclusively for the likes of Arceus-Ghost, which becomes a bigger pain for this set than the Choice Scarf variant since the drop in Speed means Terrakion is now slower and it still can't even do as much as 60% to bulky Calm Mind variants.</p> <p>Sacred Sword is sort of an option to deal more damage to Bulk Up Dialga, but Close Combat hits so hard already that the difference isn't really notable. Choice Band Terrakion is far less entry hazard dependent than the other sets, as that extra passive damage is really only worthwhile for Giratina and Arceus-Ghost. However, it is much more reliant on teammates, as it's designed to switch in, hit hard, and switch back out. The same teammates that work for Choice Scarf apply for this set. It will also need a stronger general defensive backbone out of the team supporting it to deal with the large amount of threats that now outspeed Terrakion. You can also support it with Thunder Wave to slow down those faster threats.</p>"

  "Tornadus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>When looking at Tornadus-T's generally disappointing base stats, one may question why it deserves to be used in the Uber tier. Its Special Attack stat is mediocre at best, lower than every other specially offensive Pokemon in the Uber tier, forcing it to use Choice Specs or Life Orb to gain sufficient power to threaten its foes. To make matters worse, its most powerful STAB move, Hurricane, is largely useless and unreliable outside of rain. On top of this, its Flying typing and underwhelming defenses make killing it easy. So how does Tornadus-T manage to be useful in the Uber tier, threatening both stall and offensive teams alike? The answer is simple: Regenerator.</p> <p>Because of Regenerator and an immunity to Spikes, Tornadus-T is the only Pokemon viable in Ubers that regains all HP it lost from entry hazards when switching out of battle. When combined with its high base 121 Speed, which allows it to outspeed Arceus, and its access to Taunt, you have a Pokemon that can break stall at any time of the match, regardless of circumstances. These boons don't make up for all of Tornadus-T's shortcomings, and it faces immense competition as a stallbreaker from Shaymin-S who boasts more Speed and Special Attack, Serene Grace Air Slash, and Leech Seed at the price of Regenerator and Hurricane. However, support it well, use it to its strengths, and you will have a monster on your hands.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tornadus-T has a few alternate moves that it could use on certain sets but often can't find a spot for. Substitute allows Tornadus-T to take advantage of double switches and Toxic Spikes, as well as preventing status, but it generally can't find a spot for it, and Shaymin-S can generally utilize Substitute better thanks to its access to Leech Seed. Grass Knot can be used on the Choice Specs set to OHKO Groudon and deal massive damage to Tyranitar and Hippowdon, but Tornadus-T again struggles to find a spot for it as the other moves on the set all serve important roles. Hammer Arm is a worse Superpower since it lowers one of Tornadus-T's strong points, its Speed, but it can be used if you dislike Superpower's Attack drops. Rain Dance can be used in the third slot of the Life Orb set, as it allows Tornadus-T to continue spamming Hurricanes even after Tyranitar and Groudon come in, but most of the time it's better off crippling them with Grass Knot. Lastly, Hidden Power Fire is a more accurate alternative to Heat Wave, but it forces a drop in Tornadus-T's Speed that prevents it from Speed tying with other Tornadus-T.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Countering and revenge killing Tornadus-T is difficult. Its access to Regenerator allows it to fearlessly switch away from any Pokemon that tries to revenge it and come back later to continue to release powerful Hurricanes. Because of this, even the bulkiest revenge killers can get worn down if they continuously switch into moves fired off by Tornadus-T.</p> <p>Tornadus-T, however, is relatively easy to wall. Specially defensive Giratina, standard Ho-Oh, and Great Wall Lugia avoid getting 2HKOed by every attack Tornadus-T can throw at them if Stealth Rock is not up. Giratina and Lugia can then Dragon Tail Tornadus-T out, regardless of whether or not it packs Taunt, while Ho-Oh can Brave Bird Tornadus-T to its doom. Latias can also check all Tornadus-T, as it is able to avoid being 2HKOed by any of its moves with a defensive spread of 252 HP EVs and 40 Special Defense EVs, but beware as it takes heavy damage from U-turn.</p> <p>If you lack a Lugia, Ho-Oh, Latias, or Giratina, you can try to figure out what set Tornadus-T's using and then deduce what moves it is running. If Tornadus-T is not running Superpower, Chansey can switch into Tornadus-T and absorb all of its attacks, retaliating with a 4HKO from Seismic Toss. Beware, though, as Taunt will prevent Chansey from using Soft-Boiled and Regenerator allows Tornadus-T to recover the damage it takes from a single Seismic Toss. If Tornadus-T lacks Heat Wave or is in the rain and lacks Taunt, Jirachi and Skarmory can switch into and inflict status upon Tornadus-T.</p> <p>If you lack these Pokemon as well, then you might as well try to have a Pokemon that can tank a hit and kill it. Arceus-Electric, Arceus-Steel, and Zekrom can switch into Tornadus-T and strike it down with their Judgments and Bolt Strikes, respectively. Beware, though, as Arceus-Steel in particular will take huge amounts of damage from Choice Specs Focus Blasts and sun-boosted Heat Waves.</p> <p>If all else fails, then you can resort to revenge killing Tornadus-T, but be aware that Tornadus-T can always switch out from whatever Pokemon you try to use. Virtually every Pokemon whose Speed is boosted by a Choice Scarf, Swift Swim, Chlorophyll, or Sand Rush, and anything with a priority move will be able to KO Tornadus-T with a STAB move before it can move. Zekrom deserves a second mention at its ability to revenge kill Tornadus-T. It can use Volt Switch to either scout what Pokemon Tornadus-T may try to switch into or kill Tornadus-T should it decide to stay in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Tornadus-T's ability to heal all damage from entry hazards simply by switching out, coupled with its ability to release strong Hurricanes, makes it a huge threat to stall teams. Combine this with the ability to prevent the enemy from healing by using Taunt, and you get one of the scariest stallbreakers in the Uber tier. To put icing on the cake, Tornadus-T can combine Regenerator with Life Orb to essentially get a free power boost on all its attacks, as Regenerator will heal Life Orb damage.</p> <p>Hurricane is a strong STAB that allows Tornadus-T to dent all walls not named Chansey in the rain as long as they don't resist it. Superpower pairs well with Hurricane coverage-wise, obliterating Blissey and Tyranitar, and when used in conjunction with Taunt, it allows Tornadus-T to remove Chansey from the game. Focus Blast, while it has lower accuracy, lets Tornadus-T hit everything else harder and allows it to OHKO Ferrothorn after it has taken damage from a Hurricane. Grass Knot deals immense damage to Groudon, 2HKOing even the most specially defensive variant. Alternatively, U-turn allows Tornadus-T to take advantage of Regenerator and all the double switches it forces. U-turn also allows Tornadus-T to beat all Latias that run less than 244 HP EVs and try to switch into its Hurricane after taking damage from Stealth Rock. Lastly, Taunt prevents enemy walls from recovering any HP, and also gives Tornadus-T the ability to beat any Giratina lacking Dragon Tail.</p> <p>Tornadus-T excels at breaking stall and weakening walls, so sweepers, particularly those that enjoy the removal of Arceus-Grass, are great partners for it. Since Tornadus-T already requires Kyogre to boost the accuracy of Hurricane, partners with Swift Swim, such as Kingdra, Kabutops, and Omastar, are welcome. These Pokemon can take advantage of a weakened Giratina and Arceus-Grass and proceed to sweep the other team. Zekrom deserves a special mention as it can completely eliminate Pokemon Tornadus-T has trouble killing, such as Giratina, Lugia, and Ho-Oh, while also combining its Volt Switch with Tornadus-T's U-turn to form a VoltTurn chain and keep up momentum.</p> <p>Tornadus-T's ability to force double switches when used in tandem with entry hazards can result in a massive amount of residual damage. Because of this, partners that can supply Tornadus-T with entry hazards are welcome. Deoxys-S in particular can guarantee at least one layer of Spikes and Stealth Rock while preventing the loss of momentum due to its high Speed.</p> <p>Tornadus-T's niche is stallbreaking for a team that has trouble dealing with hazards and cannot provide Toxic Spikes support. If you are able to fit a Pokemon with Rapid Spin on your team and can provide Toxic Spikes support then you may be using an inferior Shaymin-S. In this case, all Tornadus-T boasts over Shaymin-S is Hurricane, Heat Wave, and Taunt. In contrast, Shaymin-S boasts higher Special Attack and Speed as well as a non-weather reliant STAB in the form of Serene Grace Air Slash--which can act as both a Taunt and a STAB move stronger than Hurricane if it successfully flinches an opponent.</p> <p>Aside from the moves listed on the main set, Tornadus-T can successfully utilize Heat Wave and Hidden Power Ice. The former can wipe out Ferrothorn and Forretress if it isn't raining while the latter easily eliminates Rayquaza. It should be noted, though, that Tornadus-T will find it difficult to use these moves. Forgoing Taunt means that Tornadus-T can no longer beat Giratina without Dragon Tail or prevent other Pokemon from recovering HP. Losing Hurricane means giving up Tornadus-T's strongest STAB while getting rid of Superpower and Focus Blast makes it lose against Tyranitar, Dialga, Chansey, and Blissey. In reality, the only moves Heat Wave and Hidden Power Ice can be effectively used over are Grass Knot and U-turn. However, be aware that without these moves Tornadus-T can no longer create a VoltTurn chain with Zekrom or prevent Groudon from switching into it and removing its rain.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>This set attempts to increase Tornadus-T's offensive capabilities so that it can more easily break down walls on stall teams. Unlike most Choice item users, thanks to its effective immunity to hazards, Tornadus-T can switch in and out as it pleases, without having to worry about the recoil from hazard damage stacking. Unfortunately, Tornadus-T's Special Attack is less than impressive; when boosted by Choice Specs, it is still 4 points lower than that of Kyurem-W's unboosted stat.</p> <p>Hurricane is Tornadus-T's strongest STAB move and 2HKOes practically everything that doesn't resist it or have high Special Defense investment. Focus Blast provides necessary coverage, 2HKOing support Dialga and OHKOing Tyranitar with Spikes and a layer of Stealth Rock in the sand. Heat Wave allows Tornadus-T to OHKO Ferrothorn and Forretress in all weathers other than rain. The last moveslot is based on your team's needs. U-turn allows Tornadus-T to scout what will come in and take advantage of Regenerator. Hidden Power Ice allows Tornadus-T to more reliably OHKO Rayquaza, who would otherwise threaten Tornadus-T thanks to Air Lock lowering Hurricane's accuracy and its resistances to Heat Wave and Focus Blast. Lastly, Air Slash serves as a more reliable, albeit weaker, STAB move that Tornadus-T can use in non-rainy weather.</p> <p>Rain is mandatory for all Tornadus-T, and this set is no exception. Kyogre is crucial for Tornadus-T's success as it increases the accuracy of Hurricane, allowing Tornadus-T to spam the move without much of a worry. Tornadus-T also appreciates Swift Swim partners who can clean up after its work is done. Kabutops, Kingdra, Omastar, and Ludicolo can all sweep an opposing team after Tornadus-T has dealt heavy damage to the enemy's walls with its Choice Specs-boosted, STAB Hurricanes.</p> <p>Tornadus-T appreciates assistance from Pokemon that can get past Chansey, Lugia, Ho-Oh, specially defensive Latias, and Giratina, as all five avoid being 2HKOed by Choice Specs Hurricane. Zekrom perfectly fits Tornadus-T's needs, OHKOing all five of the aforementioned Pokemon with the combination of STAB Bolt Strike and STAB Outrage. To add to that, Zekrom also gets Volt Switch, meaning it can form a VoltTurn core with Tornadus-T, helping their team get free switches and keep momentum. It's a general rule that all VoltTurn cores appreciate entry hazards, and this core is no exception. Pokemon that excel at laying hazards on the field, particularly Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A, are great partners for it. Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A can ensure that both a layer of Spikes and Stealth Rock are on the field while preventing any momentum loss with their high offensive capabilities and their nearly unmatched Speed.</p>"

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Because of Darkrai, Thundurus is a rather overlooked Uber despite its wonderful offensive stats and a high base 111 Speed. However, its immunities to Ground-type attacks, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and access to the most powerful Thunder in the game after a Nasty Plot boost all differentiate it from Darkrai. Thundurus also gets the excellent Prankster ability, which endows it with a priority Thunder Wave and Taunt, allowing it to stop most entry hazard leads in their tracks. Choice Scarf users such as Palkia and Zekrom fear to revenge kill Thundurus since it can leave a parting gift in the form of Thunder Wave, crippling them for the rest of the match. Thundurus can also stop a sweeper such as +1 Dragon Dance Rayquaza (provided that it doesn't have Extreme Speed) in an emergency with Thunder Wave, although Thundurus will usually die in the process. Unfortunately, this genie has its share of weaknesses. Thundurus is incredibly frail, even more so than Darkrai, and it suffers from a crippling Stealth Rock weakness, which ensures that it will never last too long on the battlefield factoring in Life Orb recoil. Nevertheless, with the proper team support, Thundurus can be very difficult to stop, and is a threat which every team should watch out for.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Agility can be used on Thundurus to further boost its Speed stat and help remedy its chronic problem with Choice Scarf users. However, after an Agility boost, Thundurus lacks the power to take down Mewtwo with Thunder without Spikes and Stealth Rock. Also, bulkier Choice Scarf users such as Zekrom, Dialga, and Palkia will still beat Thundurus regardless. Substitute can be useful on the Prankster set to scout for switches but will make Thundurus have an even shorter life span if you predict wrongly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Anything faster than Thundurus will KO it pretty easily due to its frailty. Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Choice Scarf users such as Palkia and Dialga come to mind. Although they risk being crippled by Thunder Wave, Thundurus will usually die to them. Chansey can beat the Life Orb set easily even when Taunted. It takes a meager 18.2% - 21.5% from Thunder and can take out Thundurus with repeated Seismic Tosses. However, it still needs to watch out for the Nasty Plot set, since a +2 Focus Blast will 2HKO. Blissey falls in the same category as Chansey, except for the fact that it can actually 2HKO Thundurus with Ice Beam. Both the blobs will, however, hate taking a Hammer Arm to the face. Giratina, especially the specially defensive variant, is quite a good counter to Thundurus. It can stomach Hidden Power Ice easily and can phaze out Thundurus with Dragon Tail or paralyze it with Thunder Wave. Arceus-Ground is one of the best counters to Thundurus since it is immune to Electric-type moves, survives a Hidden Power Ice or even Grass Knot, outspeeds Thundurus, and can easily 2HKO with Ice Beam or Stone Edge (OHKOes after Stealth Rock damage). Both Arceus-Grass and Arceus-Electric give Thundurus issues since they resist Thundurus's Electric STAB and laugh at Hidden Power Ice, which fails to 2HKO either of them. Neither of them likes Thunder Wave, however, though both usually run Ice Beam to KO Thundurus. Specially defensive Groudon can switch into Thunder, survive a boosted Hidden Power Ice, and KO with Stone Edge. With Stealth Rock off the field, Ho-Oh is only 2HKOed by Thunder and can deal massive amounts of damage with Sacred Fire. Pokemon packing priority moves in their arsenal, such Rayquaza, Arceus, and Lucario, can KO Thundurus if it has taken some previous damage. An Extreme Speed from Adamant Rayquaza does 62.2% - 73.2%, and will OHKO if Thundurus has taken some damage in addition to Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Prankster": {
        "description": "<p>Thundurus's impressive base 125 Special Attack and base 111 Speed make it a force to be reckoned with in Ubers, where its main niche is its devious Prankster ability that gives it priority to support moves such as Taunt and Thunder Wave. Taunt stops most common leads, including Deoxys-S, from setting up entry hazards. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple a Choice Scarf user such as Palkia or Shaymin-S and pave the way for a sweeper, while Volt Switch in conjunction with Thundurus's blazing Speed makes Thundurus a fine scout. STAB Thunder is the primary offensive option, and it does massive amounts of damage to anything that doesn't resist it, OHKOing all variants of Lugia and Kyogre with Stealth Rock support. Hidden Power Ice rounds off Thundurus's coverage nicely, 2HKOing Support Groudon and most Dragon-types packing an Ice-type weakness. Hammer Arm is possible in the last slot since it places a nice dent in most Pokemon that give Thundurus trouble. Blissey takes a nice 63.8% - 75.2% from a Life Orb boosted Hammer Arm, and the move scores a guaranteed 2HKO on Chansey after Stealth Rock damage. Hammer Arm also OHKOes Tyranitar and puts a nice dent into the likes of Dialga and Ferrothorn. A Naive nature should always be used instead of Timid so that Hammer Arm does maximum damage. A Hasty nature is not preferred since it leaves Thundurus prone to the more common physical priority moves from the likes of Arceus.</p> <p>Focus Blast can be used over Hidden Power Ice since it allows Thundurus to have an easier time dealing with the likes of Dialga, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn, especially since the former two can beat Thundurus easily if Thundurus lacks Focus Blast. Nasty Plot can be used to boost Thundurus's Special Attack further, and although it does not sweep as well as the pure sweeper set, it can be used to fool opponents into believing Thundurus lacks Thunder Wave. If the recoil from Life Orb is unwanted, then Focus Sash is an option. Focus Sash makes Thundurus an excellent anti-lead, allowing it to take on common leads such as Darkrai, Deoxys-S, and non-Choice Scarf Kyogre. Since Thundurus relies heavily on Thunder to make an impact, rain support from Kyogre is very much needed; the unending rain Kyogre brings along gives Thunder perfect accuracy. If Kyogre support can't be provided, Thunderbolt is recommended over Thunder since it is more accurate and also has more PP. However, be aware that without Thunder, Thundurus will lose a large amount of power. Grass Knot can be used over Hidden Power Ice if Groudon is especially troublesome.</p> <p>Stealth Rock support is crucial since it allows Thundurus to net some important OHKOs. For example, Thunder will always OHKO Lugia and Kyogre factoring in Stealth Rock damage. In another vein, Stealth Rock harms Thundurus since it strips away 25% of Thundurus's HP every time it switches in. Therefore, Forretress makes an excellent teammate, as it can remove Stealth Rock from the field with Rapid Spin. Since Chansey can be a nuisance to Thundurus, Pokemon capable of eliminating Chansey are good teammates. Tickle Wobbuffet paired with a Pursuit user such as Scizor can easily beat Chansey. Lucario or Terrakion can also do the same with STAB Close Combat, and also have good defensive synergy with Thundurus. Bulk Up Dialga is also a good check thanks to its immunity to Toxic.</p> <p>Thanks to Prankster, Thundurus can easily cripple Mewtwo, Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and all the Scarf users. Several Ubers enjoy and can take advantage of this paralysis support. Notable examples are Swords Dance Garchomp, Darkrai, Mixed Dialga (an excellent Blissey and Chansey lure), and bulky Excadrill (who can use Rapid Spin and beat Tyranitar and Bulk Up Dialga). Apart from these, Jirachi and Shaymin-S can abuse Serene Grace and paralysis support to flinch Pokemon to death, and slow base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Kyogre and Zekrom will no longer be held back by their below-average speed.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Thundurus has everything one could possibly need to run a Nasty Plot set effectively: blazing Speed, a sky-high Special Attack stat, and key immunities to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Ground-type moves. The basic idea is to switch in on a support Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn, or a Pokemon that Thundurus scares out, such as Kyogre, grab a Nasty Plot as they switch out, and gear up for a sweep. Nasty Plot pumps Thundurus's already impressive Special Attack stat to an amazing 698, making it a terror to face. Thunder will do insane amounts of damage to anything not immune or resistant to it. Just to put it into perspective, Palkia is cleanly OHKOed by a +2 Thunder, while Reshiram, which is resistant to Electric-type moves, takes a massive 65.7% - 77.6%, an OHKO factoring in Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Any Groudon foolish enough to switch into Thunder is swiftly taken down with Hidden Power Ice. Focus Blast dents Pokemon such as Dialga and Ferrothorn that can otherwise annoy Thundurus, rounding off Thundurus's overall coverage very well.</p> <p>Volt Switch can be used over Focus Blast, allowing Thundurus to also function as a powerful scout, but it is usually not worth wasting a Nasty Plot boost. Taunt is also a viable alternative since it shuts down Blissey, Chansey, and Forretress, allowing Thundurus to grab a free Nasty Plot boost on them. Kyogre is an obvious choice for a teammate thanks to Drizzle making Thunder 100% accurate. Kyogre can also take Ice-type moves fired at Thundurus and eliminate opposing Groudon with ease. If rain support cannot be provided, Thunderbolt can be used over Thunder. Consequently, though, Thundurus will lose a lot of power and some key OHKOs.</p> <p>Thundurus's main flaw is its frailty, which makes it incredibly prone to revenge killing by Choice Scarf users such as Palkia and Zekrom. Wobbuffet makes a fine partner since it can eliminate common Choice Scarf users such as Palkia with ease and beat Mewtwo in rain. Wobbuffet can also utilize Encore to allow Thundurus to set up. Dual screen support from support Arceus or the like can also be used in place of Wobbuffet. Also, as strange as it might sound, Thundurus appreciates paralysis support to help deal with Choice Scarf users. Kyogre is especially adept at luring in Palkia and crippling it with Thunder Wave, while Jirachi can just spam Body Slam and can even beat Mewtwo in rain or if Mewtwo lacks Fire Blast. Ferrothorn fits well on rain teams, and Dialga is not a bad choice. If you intend to use Thundurus on a sun team, ParaDancer Groudon helps Thundurus by providing Thunder Wave support while also being a good physical attacker thanks to Swords Dance and Earthquake.</p> <p>Since Thundurus is frail, it is incredibly vulnerable to priority moves such as Extreme Speed from Arceus. Choice Scarf Terrakion makes a good teammate since it resists Extreme Speed and can hit both back with either a powerful STAB Close Combat or Stone Edge. Even if Terrakion lacks a Scarf, it can still deal with Rayquaza and Adamant Arceus. Thundurus can also switch into Ground-type moves aimed at Terrakion. Arceus-Steel also pairs up well with Thundurus, as it can easily take on most of its checks, including Rayquaza, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Chansey. Both Arceus and Rayquaza are burnt with Will-O-Wisp, while Chansey is setup bait as Arceus-Steel is immune to Toxic and can easily heal the damage inflicted by Seismic Toss with Recover. Support Arceus, Arceus-Ghost with Will-O-Wisp, and Skarmory can check Extreme Killer Arceus easily. Skarmory has the added advantage of setting up Spikes, which soften up potential walls such as like Chansey. Other entry hazards are recommended for similar reasons. Forretress is capable of setting up hazards and removing them reliably.</p>"

  "Reshiram": {
    "overview": "<p>Although its dual STABs are notorious for being unresisted, Reshiram's reliance on weather, lack of defensive utility, and susceptibility to hazards make it a lesser player on the Ubers scene. Additionally, Reshiram has to compete with Kyurem-W for the position of \"Dragon-type special nuke.\" In the minds of many, Kyurem-W's extra power, better Speed tier, and lack of weather dependence overshadow the ridiculous power of Reshiram's sun-boosted Blue Flare. The introduction of Regenerator Ho-Oh causes more problems. If Stealth Rock isn't up, Ho-Oh can now switch into a Choice Specs Draco Meteor and switch out to a resist on the second hit; any other move on the Choice Specs set—save for the uncommon Stone Edge—can be easily weathered by the flaming turkey. Taking into account all of these drawbacks, one might wonder if there is any reason to consider using it in BW2.</p> <p>Fortunately, Reshiram's combination of Roost and Tailwind means that it can step outside of its traditional nuking role and provide support for its team. This is augmented by Reshiram's superior defensive typing, which allows it to stand up to sun-boosted Fire-type attacks, Genesect, and Ferrothorn—all things that threaten Kyurem-W immensely. That said, Reshiram's defining factor is its massively powerful Blue Flare. After the boosts from sun and STAB, Blue Flare hits 292.5 net Base Power; with the exception of Kyogre's Water Spout, it's the most powerful commonly seen special attack in Ubers! Reshiram's Dragon-type STAB also comes in handy for hitting the multitude of Fire resists in Ubers, giving Reshiram an edge over Ho-Oh against Kyogre and Giratina. Altogether, Reshiram is a versatile, powerful threat that one would be foolish to dismiss the viability of.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Reshiram has other possible sets, it's best that one sticks to the beaten path. A lure set with Expert Belt is feasible, but Reshiram's STABs provide neutral, not super effective, coverage. However, if one was to run such a set, a moveset of Draco Meteor, Blue Flare, Focus Blast, and Stone Edge best deals with Reshiram's most prominent checks. Though it's highly unrecommended, Reshiram can run a dual screens set with Roost, Reflect, Light Screen, and Draco Meteor. While it works in theory, the opportunity cost is high, and it's heavily outclassed in practice by Deoxys-S and Latios due to their higher Speed and better utility moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Although Reshiram might not have counters in the strictest definition of the word, specially defensive Kyogre and Arceus-Water come pretty damn close. Without Stealth Rock down, the only set that can hope to best them is Sunny Day Reshiram with Solar Beam, although Kyogre will also fall to Outrage. Even Chansey can't switch in safely, for fear of being 2HKOed by Blue Flare after Stealth Rock. However, Reshiram loses a lot of its power when it doesn't have sun, and even more when it's raining. Once the weather has been changed, Chansey and Blissey can both safely avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Reshiram and stall it out. Ho-Oh and Arceus-Rock under sand can also defeat Reshiram handily with conditions their way, but Ho-Oh's Stealth Rock weakness and Arceus-Rock's susceptibility to Focus Blast mean that they are not strict counters. Tank Tyranitar can weather both Blue Flare and Draco Meteor, but falls to Focus Blast.</p> <p>Palkia, Kyurem-W, Terrakion, Latias, and Choice Scarf Kyogre can all revenge kill Choice Specs and offensive Reshiram, but it's hard to get them in. Flame Charge Reshiram can still be taken down by faster Choice Scarf Pokemon, namely Kyurem-W, Terrakion, and Palkia. However, one will often struggle to deal offensively with an offensive Reshiram that uses Tailwind on the switch. Reshiram's perfect two-move coverage means that it can almost always hit viable switch-ins to one move for enormous damage. However, it's rather slow, so if one can get something in that can hurt it, it's pretty easy to force Reshiram out.</p> <p>Finally, Reshiram is quite susceptible to residual damage. Sandstorm, Life Orb recoil, and entry hazards all lower its life expectancy considerably. Exploit its weakness to hazards, and Reshiram will fall quickly. Conversely, it's recommended that if Reshiram is on the opponent's team, try to keep hazards off your side of the field. Getting extra HP chipped away can compromise a wall's ability to continuously switch into Reshiram. Finally, Toxic poison is a viable option for dealing with Reshiram; Chansey can poison it and stall it out with Soft-Boiled.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>This is Reshiram's flagship set from BW1; Choice Specs pushes Reshiram's power to new heights. Its sun-boosted Blue Flare can 2HKO even the specially defensive behemoth that is Chansey with only minor residual damage; needless to say, more common walls, such as Lugia, Giratina, Groudon, and 252 / 0 Arceus (with the exception of the rarely seen Arceus-Water), are blasted to bits by either of Reshiram's potent STABs. Because of this, Reshiram functions as an excellent wallbreaker; under sun, its power is so great that Blue Flare can OHKO Manaphy with no prior damage! That said, Choice Specs Reshiram has its fair share of flaws. A weakness to entry hazards severely limits Reshiram's ability to switch in and out freely. This is further compounded by its middling Speed, which leads to Reshiram being forced out by a multitude of faster threats. Moreover, the ubiquitous Kyogre can easily stomach a Blue Flare and dampen Reshiram's Fire-type attacks to a mere ember. Overall, though, Choice Specs Reshiram is a powerful wallbreaker that every team needs to be prepared for.</p> <p>Because it has impeccable STAB coverage, Reshiram's coverage moves take less of a \"I need to hit everything for neutral damage\" role and more of a \"What threats can I hit for super effective damage?\" role. For this reason, Focus Blast is the main coverage option for this set, as it allows Reshiram to wipe the floor with Tyranitar and land a solid hit on Arceus-Rock. Alternatively, one could run Stone Edge to get a solid hit on Ho-Oh, regardless of prior damage. That said, both of Reshiram's STABs can KO after Stealth Rock—despite its resistance, Ho-Oh takes 45-53% from a sun-boosted Blue Flare—and Stone Edge isn't a guaranteed KO. Because of this, Stone Edge is generally not recommended. One could also run Flamethrower over Dragon Pulse for a perfectly accurate Fire STAB. However, Dragon Pulse's lack of a Special Attack drop generally proves itself to be more useful than the extra accuracy of Flamethrower.</p> <p>Weather is unarguably the most important factor in determining Reshiram's success. As such, Groudon is a mandatory partner. Without control over weather, Reshiram will be rendered ineffective against a large portion of teams due to the ubiquity of rain. Groudon's access to Stealth Rock compounds its usefulness; Choice Specs Reshiram greatly appreciates the presence of entry hazards on the opponent's field because they aid it in breaking through common switch-ins such as Ho-Oh—which can no longer switch into Reshiram at 50%—Kyogre, and Arceus-Rock. A spinner or Magic Bounce user is also important to this set, due to its reliance on Reshiram's ability to switch in, hit hard, and switch out. Finally, Choice Specs Reshiram's wall-shattering power makes cleaners, such as Darkrai, Mewtwo, and Choice Scarf Palkia, great partners due to their ability to easily sweep through a weakened team.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>While a Choice Specs set allows Reshiram to destroy stall, this set allows for more flexibility and greater staying power in exchange for a drop in damage output. With its ability to switch attacks, Reshiram poses a more significant threat to slow, bulky teams, which rely on pivoting to deal with it. This set thrives on forced switches, and against a hyper offense team Reshiram's bulk often won't be enough; it's exceedingly susceptible to getting revenge killed unless it runs Tailwind or Flame Charge.</p> <p>Due to Reshiram's impeccable two-move coverage, an all-out offensive set is redundant; unfortunately, before BW2 Reshiram lacked the movepool to run an effective 3 Attacks + Support set. BW2 gave Reshiram exactly what it wanted: Roost. With reliable recovery, Reshiram can capitalize on the switches that it causes to get rid of hazard and Life Orb damage.</p> <p>This set's third moveslot, its support move, is one of the defining factors that determine how the set will play. Running Tailwind turns Reshiram into a momentum snatcher for its team, setting up on a forced switch and potentially sweeping. Although Modest Reshiram hits 558 Speed—which easily outspeeds most relevant threats—after a Tailwind, a Timid nature is still usable, as there will be times when Reshiram will not have time to use Tailwind. If maximum Speed is of no concern, one could run an alternative EV spread of 80 Atk / 252 SpA / 176 Spe, which allows Reshiram to outspeed the fastest commonly seen Ubers Choice Scarf user, Terrakion. However, 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe is generally better, because when Tailwind isn't in effect the loss of Speed is noticeable. Running Tailwind also allows Reshiram to support its team; powerful offensive wallbreakers, such as Rayquaza, mixed Zekrom, four attacks Mewtwo, and Lustrous Orb Palkia, become far more threatening with their Speed doubled. Alternatively, Roost can be run to increase Reshiram's longevity greatly; between hazards, Life Orb, and miscellaneous attacks, Reshiram's HP will drop quickly without it. Running Roost will transform Reshiram from a sweeper to a tank, taking hits, healing up, and returning fire.</p> <p>As for the last slot, the main choice is between Outrage and Stone Edge. While Stone Edge allows Reshiram to annihilate Ho-Oh, Outrage is generally the better option due to its increased power against Latias, Chansey, and others. It can also serve as a backup sweeping tool if one is running Draco Meteor, as a Reshiram at -2 SpA will often want a solid STAB option to continue a sweep if need be. If one is running Tailwind in the third slot, Roost becomes a viable option in the last slot as well. Running the combination of Roost and Tailwind will turn Reshiram into a team supporter capable of facilitating sweeps repeatedly. However, the lack in coverage is noticeable and generally Outrage or Stone Edge will be of more use.</p> <p>As will always be the case with Reshiram, sun support is mandatory for this set. Without it, Blue Flare will often be weakened by rain. Despite having Roost, Reshiram still appreciates Rapid Spin support, as the more turns spent recovering, the less turns are spent attacking. Entry hazards on the opponent's field are, as always, important. They allow Reshiram to get many of the KOs that it would otherwise miss. Paralysis is also incredibly important, especially if one isn't running Tailwind. Due to Reshiram's moderately low 90 base Speed, it needs the support to be able to perform to the best of its ability; Groudon, Dialga, Arceus-Grass, and Ferrothorn can all spread this helpful status reliably. Finally, this set also appreciates not only the aforementioned wallbreakers, but a fast cleaner that can take advantage of the holes that Reshiram makes in teams.</p>"
      },
      "Flame Charge": {
        "description": "<p>Yet another exploitation of Reshiram's natural power and coverage, this set aims to sweep teams through the use of Flame Charge; frail offensive teams often are simply unable to handle a Reshiram at +1. Reshiram hits 459 Speed after a Flame Charge, which allows it to outspeed all relevant non-Choice Scarf Ubers threats, bar Deoxys-S—which does not commonly carry moves which can impede Reshiram—and users of Chlorophyll or Swift Swim. In addition, Flame Charge's chip damage can often trigger a favorable situation. Under sun, Arceus-Rock can be KOed by the combination of Flame Charge and Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock; Ferrothorn or Forretress in sunlight are forced to switch, and Reshiram gets the Speed boost either way.</p> <p>However, common Choice Scarf users, such as Terrakion and Palkia, can still outspeed and revenge kill +1 Reshiram; despite this downside, Genesect, another common Choice Scarf user, while still outspeeding Reshiram, is unable to revenge kill it without sacrificing itself with Explosion.</p> <p>There are two main variants of Flame Charge Reshiram: mixed and special. If one decides to go mixed (i.e. use Outrage or Stone Edge in the last slot), then one of Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse has to be forgone. Draco Meteor has much higher power, allowing it to take out Choice Scarf Kyogre with relative ease, but its Special Attack drop is somewhat counter-intuitive with the sweeping—as opposed to nuking—nature of this set. If one chooses to run Draco Meteor, it's recommended that Outrage is run in the last slot to have a moderately powerful Dragon-type STAB on hand. Stone Edge makes another appearance, and is, again, is solely for taking out Ho-Oh in a single hit, as it would otherwise be a pest, forcing Reshiram into Outrage (which does not even OHKO unless Stealth Rock is present).</p> <p>Alternatively, one could just run a special Flame Charge variant and get the best of both worlds. Having access to Dragon Pulse and Draco Meteor lets Reshiram get rid of some of its own checks before sweeping. While this is a viable strategy, it suffers from the huge block to almost all special attackers: Chansey. Even under sun, Blue Flare can't 2HKO after Stealth Rock, which means Chansey can come in and PP or Toxic stall Reshiram out. Moreover, Ho-Oh is only threatened by Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock, making it a fine check. In addition to its problems with Chansey, purely special Flame Charge Reshiram is complete setup bait after it uses Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Flame Charge is pretty much the most high-maintenance Reshiram set there is. Due to the fact that Reshiram needs to be able to OHKO or 2HKO as many foes as possible when sweeping, sun support is, as always, mandatory. Entry hazards need to be up on the opponent's field as well, for the same reason. Because this set lacks as much power as some others, it needs all the help it can get; carrying a reliable Spikes user, such as Forretress, will work wonders. On the topic of Forretress, Rapid Spin support is helpful as well; however, it's not as important as with the Choice Specs set due to the fact that the aim of this set is to sweep. That said, it is important to keep residual damage to a minimum on Reshiram, as not only does Flame Charge expose Reshiram for a turn, but should its HP get too low, it is liable to be sniped by the myriad of priority in Ubers. For the same reason, try to bring Reshiram in off of a KO or a slow U-turn or Volt Switch to keep the extra damage at bay. Finally, a wallbreaker, such as Kyurem-W or Mewtwo, will help to soften up Reshiram's checks so it can sweep; this will especially help get Reshiram past Ho-Oh and Chansey, two of its most reliable checks.</p>"
      },
      "SubRoost": {
        "description": "<p>On such an offensively-oriented Pokemon, one might wonder why a SubRoost set is even considered. Because Reshiram only needs two moveslots to get perfect neutral coverage, it can run SubRoost alongside its attacking moves and not lose out on any major threats. Reshiram can set up Substitutes on a multitude of defensive Pokemon, most notable Ferrothorn and Forretress, with no fear of having its Substitute broken. With Substitute, Reshiram no longer has to rely on predicting the switch-in; with a Substitute up, the opponent has to stand and fight regardless of how fast or strong they are. Because of this, SubRoost Reshiram makes a great lure to weaken its checks; use Substitute on the switch, attack while they break the sub, and switch out to a pivot. Roost allows Reshiram to recover HP lost from Substitute, hazards, and other miscellaneous damage. With the combination of Substitute and Roost, Reshiram becomes an efficient weapon against bulky teams; even with Leftovers, its attacks are fearsomely powerful.</p> <p>The choice between Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse is one of power vs. reliability. With Draco Meteor, Reshiram has an enormous amount of immediate power, consistently being able to OHKO Kyurem-W at -2 after Stealth Rock and 2HKO offensive Dialga. However, Reshiram becomes a giant, flaming, sitting duck after using it due to the stat drop. On the other hand, Dragon Pulse is significantly weaker but cannot be played around like Draco Meteor, due to its consistent damage.</p> <p>Because this set forces a lot of switches, hazards are mandatory to its success. SubRoost Reshiram excels at wearing down balanced teams that are simply unable to juggle coping with the onslaught of attacks that Reshiram throws at it and breaking Reshiram's Substitutes; as such, cleaners that can sweep crippled opponents are welcome partners. Also, SubRoost Reshiram is fairly slow. Because of this, it will struggle against offensive teams unless it has paralysis support.</p> <p>This set is unique for being Reshiram's only set that can accomplish much of its intended goal under rain. As such, while sun support is highly recommended, it is not required; if running this set without Groudon as a partner, one should run Dragon Pulse in the last slot. The trio of Substitute, Roost, and Dragon Pulse allow Reshiram to outlast a surprising number of foes. Because this set does not rely on sheer force to get past opponents, Leftovers is recommended to offset Substitute's HP cost. Life Orb is a feasible option to increase Reshiram's damage output; however, its recoil is not appreciated in conjunction with Substitute.</p>"
      },
      "Sunny Day": {
        "description": "<p>While other Reshiram sets aim to break teams apart after their checks are gone, Sunny Day Reshiram intends to lure some of those same checks in and eliminate them. By using Sunny Day, Reshiram can beat Kyogre, although against variants that outspeed it, such as Choice Scarf, one needs to predict the switch-in. However, in the case of specially defensive Kyogre, Reshiram doesn't even need to predict, as it outspeeds regardless; under sun, Kyogre deals a pitiful 15.24-18.18% with Scald. However, Reshiram will not be able to KO the same Kyogre reliably unless it is using Solar Beam. Sunny Day Reshiram plays a little more conservatively than the other sets; while they capitalize on Reshiram's power and coverage to force switches, this set focuses on eliminating its counters. Because of this, one will have to adjust their use of Reshiram accordingly. Sunny Day Reshiram has to be played carefully, as it lacks the immediate power, speed, or safety that the other sets have.</p> <p>In addition to its upfront purpose, Sunny Day Reshiram also fulfills a hidden task: weather backup. If one's weather inducer (presumably Groudon) is KOed, the opponent will automatically start playing more recklessly with theirs. Once their inducer faints, Sunny Day Reshiram swoops in, creating sun for five turns and permanently eradicating the adverse weather. The illusion of not having a second inducer can be augmented by bluffing a Choice item on Reshiram through the use of Charcoal; however, the loss in power is obvious on everything but its Fire-type STAB.</p> <p>Roost is usable for the same reasons as the offensive set. Reshiram does have a bit of bulk to its name (+1 U-turn from max Attack Genesect deals 23.75 -- 28.15%), and with Roost it could act as a bulky weather pivot. That said, running Roost requires Reshiram to forgo its coverage move, which means that it'll be tough to take down Tyranitar even under sun.</p> <p>Sunny Day Reshiram isn't meant to be a weather inducer for the team; rather, it is the counter-inducer. Thus, Groudon is an excellent partner as usual. Plenty of hazards help Reshiram get past Kyogre and Tyranitar, as well as its old foes. Due to Sunny Day Reshiram's ability to increase one's control over weather, running sun-dependent Pokemon, such as Blaziken and Ho-Oh, is a good idea with this set.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>In a similar vein to Flame Charge, Choice Scarf enables Reshiram to clean up weakened opposing teams with relative ease. Though it competes with Kyurem-W, Reshiram has a potent niche as a Choice Scarf user due to its Blue Flare. Even without a boosting item, a sun-boosted Blue Flare is incredibly powerful—252/0 Arceus can be OHKOed after Stealth Rock, while Great Wall Lugia is swiftly 2HKOed. Ironically, Choice Scarf Reshiram can also check Ho-Oh with decent success due to its ability to switch in on Sacred Fire with impunity and deal heavy damage with Stone Edge. Unfortunately, Reshiram's weather dependence holds it back at times. Without a boosting item, Blue Flare loses much of its power under rain, severely limiting the scope of opponents that it can efficiently revenge kill.</p> <p>While Dragon Pulse is useful for cleaning weakened teams regardless of weather, Outrage is a viable option due to its ability to OHKO Latias after Stealth Rock. Though Outrage doesn't hurt when it's coming unboosted from a 4 Atk 120 base Attack stat, not much is lost due to the fact that Scarf Reshiram is better off cleaning with Blue Flare late-game. Basically, if you need to be able to revenge kill Latias, run Outrage; otherwise, Dragon Pulse is your best bet.</p> <p>Though it's best to stick to the given set, Focus Blast could theoretically be run over Stone Edge to dent Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock. However, the extra damage does not usually warrant a slot over the ability to eliminate Ho-Oh semi-reliably. The choice between Mild and Hasty is the eternal battle between speed and power; Hasty grants Reshiram the ability to tie with other +1 base 90s, whereas Mild grants it the extra boost that is needed to get some notable KOs.</p> <p>When using Choice Scarf Reshiram, it is of cardinal importance that one makes sure that it is not outclassed by Kyurem-W. As has been touched on (or rather, persistently reiterated), Reshiram needs sun to function at the top of its game. As it is a potent cleaner, Choice Scarf Reshiram settles into a defensive sun team quite nicely, increasing the team's ability to handle threats such as Arceus-Ghost, Mewtwo, and Genesect, as well as ripping through weakened offense. Defensive sun teams are pretty much the most reliable format with which to maintain sun; as Choice Scarf Reshiram isn't as powerful as other Reshiram variants, it is arguably the most dependent on weather. In addition, due to its aforementioned lowered damage output, Choice Scarf Reshiram appreciates the hazards that a stall team can get up and keep up greatly.</p> <p>On the other hand, offensive sun also appreciates Choice Scarf Reshiram's combination of speed and power. Ironically, Reshiram forms a powerful offensive core with Kyurem-W by breaking each other's checks. Reshiram also appreciates the wallbreakers that are so commonly found on sun offense, such as Palkia, Rayquaza, and Ho-Oh, as they weaken opposing teams—this in turn allows Reshiram to break through the opponent by way of sheer force.</p>"

  "Zekrom": {
    "overview": "<p>With a monstrously high base 150 Attack stat, combined with powerful and complementary Electric- and Dragon-type STAB moves, Zekrom has the power to devastate many teams. Zekrom's signature move, Bolt Strike, will leave enormous dents in even those who resist it, and forces people to run a Ground-type Pokemon or a very bulky Electric-type resistor in their teams. Even then, they will have to tread carefully against its extremely powerful Dragon-type STAB moves. While Zekrom does not have much to offer defensively, it is an excellent check to Ho-Oh and defensive Kyogre due to its resistances to Fire-, Flying-, and Water-type moves. However, Zekrom does have notable flaws in its rather middling Speed, common weaknesses, an almost useless ability, and a very limited movepool. Regardless, Zekrom's incredible strength is definitely something to watch out for.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As stated before, Zekrom's movepool is lackluster, and there aren't a lot of options for it to play around with. Thunder Wave can be used to slow down Lugia so it cannot stall Zekrom's Bolt Strikes with Reflect and Roost. Imprison can be used to block Draco Meteor and Outrage, but will still leave it vulnerable to Spacial Rend and Earthquake. Zekrom learns Reflect and Light Screen, and can use Volt Switch to aid in safely sending in its target teammate, but its rather low Speed and common weaknesses hinder it from setting them up easily. Finally, Zekrom learns Dragon Tail for phazing.</p> <p>Haban Berry is an interesting option to use over Life Orb on the mixed set, which allows Zekrom to take a hit from opposing Dragons and OHKO them back with its own attacks. Air Balloon can be used to avoid Earthquake and escape Dugtrio, but will pop after getting hit by a single attack. Groudon can simply Dragon Tail Zekrom away while Garchomp can penetrate Zekrom with Outrage or Dragon Claw. Dragon Fang is an option over Life Orb for the mixed attacker if you despise taking 10% each turn due to Life Orb, but should only be used with the slower variants, as it requires investment in both Attack and Special Attack to deal a good amount of damage in the absence of Life Orb.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Zekrom is difficult to counter due to its immense strength and coverage, but there are several Pokemon in the game that can annoy it. Ferrothorn resists both Electric- and Dragon-type moves, but needs to be wary of Focus Blast from the mixed set. Also be aware that Choice Band Outrage or Bolt Strike 3HKOes specially defensive Ferrothorn. Although Groudon needs to be wary of Draco Meteor and Outrage, it can take on Zekrom's other physical attacks and retaliate with Earthquake. The best counter to Zekrom, however, is Arceus-Ground, as it can take a hit and outrun Zekrom to KO it with Earthquake or Judgment.</p> <p>Zekrom is fairly easy to revenge kill due to its low Speed and weaknesses to Ground-, Ice-, and Dragon-type attacks. Garchomp can switch into a predicted Bolt Strike and KO Zekrom back with Earthquake or Outrage. Keep in mind, however, that maximum HP Zekrom takes only 81% maximum from Garchomp's Earthquake. Palkia, Rayquaza, Arceus-Dragon, and Choice Scarf Dialga are all faster than Zekrom and OHKO it with their Dragon-type attacks. Mewtwo is much faster than Zekrom and can knock it out with Ice Beam, provided Zekrom has taken a bit of residual damage. Wobbuffet can to an extent pose problems for Zekrom, as it revenge kills the Choice Scarf set, and the Choice Band set if Zekrom is not locked into Bolt Strike or Outrage. Dugtrio, though rare, can trap and revenge kill Zekrom. Choice Zekrom in particular needs to be wary of this, as Dugtrio can set up Hone Claws on a Choice-locked Electric-type move. Although practically nonexistent in the Uber metagame, Steelix is the best Choice Zekrom counter in the game, sporting a base 200 Defense to go along with its resistance to Dragon and immunity to Electric.</p> <p>There are other ways to play around Zekrom. Against the mixed attacker, you can attempt to lure out its Draco Meteor and send in a Steel-type Pokemon to take the hit and weaken Zekrom's Special Attack, then send in Groudon to wall it. Zekrom in general hates Toxic Spikes, so laying it down will cut its rampage short. This especially applies to the mixed attacker, as it would take at least 22.5% every time it launches a successful hit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Zekrom is quite a formidable mixed attacker, sporting a great base 120 Special Attack in addition to its obscenely high base 150 Attack. STAB Draco Meteor, bolstered by Life Orb and 339 Special Attack, is a frightening move to switch into. Even 252/4 Groudon, an otherwise easy safe switch-in to Zekrom, takes a painful 75%-88% from it. Bolt Strike complements Draco Meteor very well, providing almost unresisted coverage, as well as striking extremely hard on the physical side. Its immense strength and excellent type coverage allow Zekrom to blast through Kyogre, Blissey, Chansey, Lugia, Ho-Oh, and most Steel-type Pokemon, in addition to giving most Arceus formes a very tough time stalling and setting up. Dragon Claw is Zekrom's most reliable attack, but Outrage can be used if the extra power is needed, such as against Arceus-Grass or Arceus-Electric. Focus Blast allows Zekrom to hit the few Pokemon that resist its STABs, most notably Ferrothorn, but Volt Switch can be used to break Shaymin-S's Substitute and to escape from Wobbuffet.</p> <p>The Attack EVs allow Zekrom to OHKO the standard Giratina-O with Dragon Claw after Stealth Rock damage. They also allow Bolt Strike to have a high chance of KOing Chansey after two Stealth Rock switch-ins, and to always OHKO 248 HP Scizor after Stealth Rock damage. Furthermore, assuming neutrality, 4/0 Arceus will take 71% minimum. The Special Attack EVs maximize the amount of damage Draco Meteor and Focus Blast can do. The rest are thrown into HP to give Zekrom a bit of bulk, and 4 Speed EVs allow it to outrun other base 90 Speed Pokemon that lack any investment. You may find it insufficient, however, so feel free to invest more in Speed until you feel comfortable.</p> <p>If Focus Blast is too unreliable for your taste, Hidden Power Fire can also nail down Ferrothorn, and OHKO Forretress through its Sturdy ability thanks to Teravolt. This comes at the cost of one Speed and one Special Attack IV, and of being stuck with a pathetically weak move in rain. Thunder Wave is an option to paralyze potential non-Ground-type switch-ins and cripples Lugia, who could actually be a pain to fight against due to Pressure, Reflect, and Roost. As far as EV spreads go, if you're a speed freak, you might consider using maximum Speed and Special Attack, with a Hasty or Naive nature. Although Zekrom loses a considerable amount of power, the extra Speed minimizes the amount of attacks it will have to take or fear.</p> <p>The first thing you want to consider is what role would Zekrom serve on your team. Zekrom can act as magnificent Groudon bait, and as such it makes a great partner to Pokemon such as Kyogre and Ho-Oh, both of whom would love to have the opposing Groudon gone. Zekrom also serves as a check to bulky Kyogre (watch out for Scald burns!) and Ho-Oh, and can fit in well in sun teams that struggle against them.</p> <p>As with literally almost every Pokemon in the game, Zekrom appreciates entry hazards to aid in killing its targets. Forretress, Deoxys-S, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory can all set up Spikes and Stealth Rock. All of them but Deoxys-S also resist Dragon, and Skarmory is immune to Ground as well. Forretress also provides Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin support. Groudon can set up Stealth Rock and use its high Defense to sponge Earthquakes and Outrages, and appreciates Zekrom's ability to remove defensive Kyogre. Since Zekrom will be taking 10% damage every time it launches an attack, Wish support can be helpful. Blissey, Chansey, and Jirachi are all capable of passing Wishes to Zekrom; the former two can pass absolutely massive Wishes, while Jirachi resists Zekrom's Dragon- and Ice-type weaknesses. Also, keep in mind that Zekrom cannot handle offensive Kyogre well, and as such Palkia is a great partner.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Tremble in fear of Zekrom's Choice Band-boosted and powerful, complementary STAB attacks, bolstered by a maximum Attack stat of 438. Its Bolt Strike is powerful enough to terrorize even most of the Pokemon that resist it, dealing a solid 41%-49% to max HP Dialga and 44%-52% to the standard Naughty Giratina-O. With that in mind, Bolt Strike will absolutely murder those who do not resist it. However, as tempting as it is to spam Bolt Strikes, it is unwise if any Ground-types are present, as they will absorb the blow and leave Zekrom helpless. Dragon Claw is a safe move to throw out to damage the Ground-type switch ins, and is a safe move to spam in general. However, it is somewhat weak and doesn't do a lot of damage against defensive Groudon. Outrage provides Zekrom with the ability to easily 2HKO even 252/252+ Groudon after Stealth Rock damage, and allows it to clean up slower teams, but can leave it very vulnerable to revenge killing. The sole reason Fusion Bolt takes up the fourth slot is for reliability, because Bolt Strike can miss at the worst times. Volt Switch can be used to break Shaymin-S's Substitute so a faster Pokemon can switch in safely.</p> <p>Unlike the previous set, the EVs are quite simple. It promotes maximum power and gives Zekrom a fair amount of bulk. Similarly to the previous set, some Speed EVs can be added to outrun other Pokemon of similar Speed, such as Kyogre and Ho-Oh. Obviously, if you decide to use Jolly, use 252 Speed instead of HP.</p> <p>Despite Outrage being able to 2HKO defensive Groudon, it will still be a big pain to fight as it walls the rest of Zekrom's moveset. Luckily, it isn't too hard to counter. Defensive Kyogre, Giratina-O, and Arceus-Grass are some examples of excellent switch-ins to Groudon. Conversely, Zekrom could lure in Groudon and severely injure or KO it with Outrage, making it easier for other attackers, such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Swords Dance Arceus, to sweep--however, be sure to invest in Speed for this purpose. Physically defensive Ferrothorn is an issue as well, resisting both of Zekrom's STAB moves, and as such, Pokemon with access to Fire-type moves are great partners. Forretress can set up entry hazards on Ferrothorn while Rapid Spinning Ferrothorn's away. The lack of Life Orb means this Zekrom does not drain its own health every time it attacks, making Wish support less of a priority. Otherwise, the partners from the previous set all work well here.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Zekrom's middling Speed can be patched up with a Choice Scarf, allowing it to act as a revenge killer. Zekrom possesses a couple of traits that separate it from its fellow Choice Scarf users Palkia, Dialga, and Garchomp. For one, its high Attack and Bolt Strike allow it to take down Mewtwo from 80% health down (73% with Jolly) and to murder Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Lugia, all of whom can give Choice Scarf Palkia, Dialga, and Garchomp issues. With Adamant nature, it can also 2HKO maximum HP Arceus (assuming neutrality, of course), while Palkia, Dialga, and Garchomp are turned into setup bait. Finally, it has access to Volt Switch, which allows it to keep up the momentum against the opponent so long as a Ground-type doesn't switch in.</p> <p>Bolt Strike and Outrage are the bread and butter moves of this set, both possessing immense power and STAB, hitting nearly everything for neutral damage. As a matter of fact, Zekrom's Outrage is strong enough to 2HKO offensive Groudon, something Garchomp is incapable of doing. Dragon Claw is a safe move to use should locking into Outrage or Electric-type moves be risky, but it is rather weak. Finally, Fusion Bolt can be used over Volt Switch if you find Volt Switch's utility to be too little for you, and is 100% accurate, unlike Bolt Strike.</p> <p>Adamant and Jolly are equally viable on Zekrom. With Adamant, Zekrom gains the ability to 2HKO maximum HP Arceus and to OHKO Mewtwo after Stealth Rock damage and one round of Life Orb recoil. However, it loses the Speed tie against other base 90 Choice Scarf users and +1 Speed Ho-Oh and Reshiram (due to Flame Charge). Adamant also means Deoxys-A will outrun Zekrom.</p> <p>Although Zekrom is an effective revenge killer, it is incapable of handling Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Salamence, and thus, defensive Groudon is a decent partner. Since Choice Scarf Zekrom lacks the raw power of the other two sets, an anti-Groudon or Dialga is more necessary than before. Giratina-O, Arceus-Grass, Kyogre, and Lugia (who also counters Dragon Dance Rayquaza) are all great choices for countering defensive Groudon. Dialga is trickier to handle, but Arceus-Fighting, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Groudon, and sturdy Steel-type Pokemon that can absorb its obscenely powerful Dragon-type attacks are all decent checks. As with most Choice Scarf users in the game, Zekrom is quite vulnerable to Wobbuffet, who can trap it and OHKO back with Counter, but at this point there is not much you can do.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Hone Claws": {
        "description": "<p>Zekrom's average Speed stat makes it a mediocre sweeper on its own, so Hone Claws seems like the perfect choice to make Zekrom an even better sweeper by increasing its already ridiculously high Attack stat. However, this set's main purpose is not to use Hone Claws and Substitute to improve its attacking prowess. Instead, it aims to take advantage of one of Zekrom's most common switch-ins, Ferrothorn, while still maintaining the superb coverage granted by Dragon- and Electric-type attacks.</p> <p>Substitute allows Zekrom to set up on Ferrothorn--probably Zekrom's most common switch-in--and scout other switch-ins. Outrage and Bolt Strike are amazing STAB moves, as both are extremely powerful and have wide coverage in conjunction with each other. The choice between Dragon Claw and Outrage is up to the user. Outrage's undeniable power--it OHKOes Giratina-O and 2HKOes Max HP Dialga after Stealth Rock damage--makes it the superior option. However, if you don't want to be locked into Outrage and risk hitting yourself in confusion, feel free to use Dragon Claw. It should be noted, however, that doing so will cost you some crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as the ones that have been mentioned above.</p> <p>The EV spread is quite straightforward; it gives Zekrom maximum bulk and power while allowing it to outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon that don't invest in Speed. However, you can opt to use more Speed EVs to outspeed certain foes. 8 Speed EVs outruns 4 Speed Kyogre and Groudon, 36 Speed EVs outpaces base 90s with 32 Speed EVs, such as Substitute Ho-Oh, and 164 Speed is just enough to outspeed Lugia, allowing Zekrom to strike it before it sets up Reflect. In all of those cases, you should take the EVs out of Attack, as the bulk is necessary. However, if you want a more offensive approach, you can use a spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature. This will let Zekrom outspeed everything it can at the cost of bulk and many important KOs.</p> <p>The big decision you will need to make for this set is what item it will use. Leftovers fits this Zekrom set perfectly, allowing it to use Substitute to scout switch-ins while regaining the lost health, minimizing the consequences of multiple uses of Substitute. With a Life Orb, Zekrom will usually focus on attacking first, only using Substitute to set up on Ferrothorn; thus, it should only be used with a Jolly nature and its corresponding EV spread. Life Orb is also notable for letting Zekrom gain several key KOs that Leftovers forces it to miss out on. For example, after one Hone Claws boost, Jolly Life Orb Zekrom will always OHKO maximum HP Arceus with Bolt Strike after Stealth Rock damage; Adamant Life Orb Zekrom also has an 87% chance of OHKOing maximum HP Dialga with a +1 Outrage. Finally, with Life Orb, you have the option of using Draco Meteor over Outrage and Dragon Claw. Assuming a spread of 104 HP / 148 Atk / 252 SpA / 4 Spe, Draco Meteor will 2HKO Groudon, one of this set's biggest problems, and can also be used to lure Ferrothorn in after it is used once. The downside in doing so is that Zekrom will have serious problems getting past most Dialga.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes and hazards completely tear this set apart, so a Rapid Spin user should be used. Tentacruel is an amazing spinner, as being part Poison-type means that it can simply clear the field of Toxic Spikes when it switches in. Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Hippowdon are immune to Bolt Strike, laugh at Outrage with their massive Defense stats, and strike back hard with their super effective STAB moves. Hippowdon and Arceus-Ground can heal themselves by using Slack Off and Recover, respectively. Excadrill falls in the same boat as the aforementioned Pokemon, but it resists Outrage. Arceus-Grass usually carries Ice Beam and Will-O-Wisp, resists Bolt Strike, and has the ability to Recover off the damage, which makes it a solid switch-in. However, Arceus-Grass will take a lot from a +1 Outrage. Garchomp and any other faster Dragon-type Pokemon can revenge kill Zekrom. Garchomp gets a special mention, as it is able to break Zekrom's Substitute and OHKO it with Dual Chop. Like Garchomp, Cloyster also outspeeds Zekrom, and can use Icicle Spear to break through Zekrom's Substitute and OHKO it. Lugia, if faster, can set up Reflect before Zekrom gets the chance to hit with Bolt Strike, and proceed to stall it with Roost.</p>"
      },
      "Tailwind": {
        "description": "<p>Zekrom's mediocre base 90 Speed makes it nearly impossible for the poor Dragon to sweep, so this set attempts to remedy this by utilizing Tailwind. Under the effects of Tailwind, Zekrom can outspeed a majority of the tier, even when running mixed offensive EVs. Draco Meteor, despite lacking full investment, packs a huge punch, allowing Zekrom to heavily dent any troublesome Groudon and support Arceus that might try to halt its sweep. Bolt Strike is extremely strong with maximum Attack investment, and can do heavy damage to Pokemon, such as OHKO 0 HP Arceus after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage. The last moveslot is based on the team's needs. Outrage gives Zekrom a strong STAB move to spam after it has used Draco Meteor, but beware, as it may leave Zekrom locked in after Tailwind has ended. Volt Switch allows Zekrom to keep momentum by scouting for any potential double switches and can give Tailwind's Speed boost to another teammate. Lastly, Focus Blast allows Zekrom to kill weakened Ferrothorn, as the move always 2HKOes after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Zekrom is walled by different Pokemon depending on what it runs in the fourth moveslot. If Zekrom forgoes Focus Blast, Ferrothorn will be able to switch in with ease and can stomach any attack, as it resists all moves that Zekrom can hit it with. If Zekrom forgoes Outrage, then it risks being defeated by Latios, Latias, and specially defensive Groudon after it has used Draco Meteor. If Zekrom forgoes both Focus Blast and Outrage, then Excadrill will be able to switch in to it, avoiding the 2HKO from any move that Zekrom has, and proceed to OHKO Zekrom with Earthquake should it not switch out. Regardless of which move you choose to use, Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Grass will always be problematic. Partners that can help Zekrom defeat or weaken these foes are welcome, particularly those that also appreciate Tailwind's Speed boost. While practically every Dragon with a base 90 Speed stat falls in this category, Latios, Latias, Reshiram, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza deserve special mentions; they can weaken enemy Ferrothorn, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Grass with their powerful moves while supporting Zekrom with a Tailwind of their own. Arceus-Steel, though boasting high Speed, is also a great partner for Zekrom. Arceus-Steel's typing allows it to resist powerful Dragon STAB moves aimed at Zekrom while allowing the titan to setup on Ferrothorn, as it resists all of the common moves that Ferrothorn can try to hit it with and can nab Calm Minds while it struggles to hurt Arceus.</p> <p>Zekrom also appreciates Pokemon that can lay hazards, which are beneficial in easing a clean sweep. Partners, such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory, pair nicely with Zekrom, as they not only provide Stealth Rock and Spikes support, but can also absorb Outrages and Draco Meteors aimed at Zekrom while creating potential setup opportunities by attracting choice-boosted Fire-type moves. Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A also pair nicely with Zekrom, as they can easily lay Spikes down early in a match while also preventing any momentum loss thanks to their high Speed and good offensive capabilities.</p> <p>Zekrom has a few other moves it can run in the fourth moveslot. Roost lengthens Zekrom's longevity and allows it to wall Ferrothorn, but Zekrom can now no longer maim Excadrill and Dialga. Hidden Power Fire can be used on a sun team to fry Ferrothorn and Forretress, but it hurts Zekrom's ability to prevent Dialga from coming in and taking momentum. Lastly, Dragon Claw can be used if you want a reliable Dragon STAB move that doesn't lock Zekrom in, but beware, as the power drop is noticeable.</p> <p>The listed EV spread allows Zekrom to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf Terrakion while under Tailwind, as well as maximize Zekrom's Attack stat, with the rest of the EVs being thrown into Special Attack to power up Draco Meteor. Naughty is the nature of choice, as it allows Zekrom to maximize its Attack while keeping its Defense intact. A Lonely nature makes Zekrom take more damage from priority, but can be used to preserve Zekrom's Special Defense. If this EV spread doesn't suit your needs then you can use a more specially offensive spread of 164 Atk / 168 SpA / 176 Spe. This allows Zekrom to 2HKO Groudon with Draco Meteor while having enough power in Bolt Strike to OHKO Mewtwo. Fully investing in Attack and Speed while entirely forgoing Draco Meteor for Outrage is also an option, but note that when you do this, you may have trouble when facing Groudon, as physically defensive variants avoid the 2HKO from Outrage and can OHKO back with Earthquake.</p>"

  "Landorus": {
    "overview": "<p>When taking a first glance at Landorus, it may seem worthless in the Ubers metagame. It is weak to the common Water- and Ice-type moves of the tier and has no valuable resistances other than Fighting. Moreover, it has underwhelming defensive stats of 89 HP, 90 Defense, and 80 Special Defense, which means that even resisted moves will leave a mark. However, as prominent as these setbacks may be, do not put Landorus's qualities aside! It may not be good defensively, but that is surely made up by its high base 125 Attack and 101 Speed, as well as a notable base 115 Special Attack. In fact, Landorus's extraordinary Speed gives it the jump on common Choice Scarf users, such as Palkia and Salamence. Landorus's Sand Force ability makes it a phenomenal addition to any sandstorm-based team, as it boosts its fantastic Ground STAB. Landorus's coverage includes moves such as U-turn, which makes it a phenomenal scout in conjunction with its Speed stat, and Stone Edge, which is also boosted by Sand Force. Landorus can also boost its great Attack thanks to Swords Dance and become a deadly sweeper in sand once set-up. In addition, thanks to its typing, Landorus packs a natural immunity to both Ground- and Electric-type moves, both of which are extremely common in Ubers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Landorus unfortunately does not have many other viable options in Ubers. Black 2 and White 2 gave it access to Stealth Rock via move tutors, so Landorus can run a set of Stealth Rock + 3 attacks very well. Landorus also has access to Bulk Up, but this move is outclassed by Swords Dance. Landorus can use Calm Mind to boost up its respectable Special Attack, but its special movepool is very shallow. A mixed Sheer Force set, consisting of Earth Power, Focus Blast, U-turn, and Stone Edge with Life Orb can work, but is generally unreliable unlike Landorus's other sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Many of Landorus's counters depend on its sets. Skarmory and the rare Bronzong completely wall Landorus, only fearing Smack Down or Gravity which negates their Ground immunity. Cresselia is capable of tanking Landorus thanks to her high bulk, access to Reflect and Moonlight, and has a 50% chance to OHKO with Ice Beam. However, if she switches into +2 Life Orb Sand Force Smack Down, she is OHKOed next turn by Earthquake, as Smack Down does 25.67% minimum, and Earthquake 77.25% minimum. She also must be wary of Gravity too. The Giratina formes are also bulky enough to take an Earthquake or Stone Edge, though Giratina has a small chance of breaking Landorus's Substitute with Dragon Tail and Giratina-O must be wary of Smack Down or Gravity. Bulky Arceus formes, such as Wallceus, Arceus-Grass, and Arceus-Ghost are bulky enough to take even a boosted Earthquake, can cripple Landorus with Will-O-Wisp, Recover the HP they have lost in the process, and hit hard with Return, Ice Beam, or Ghost-type Judgment, respectively. Choice Scarf Kyogre can outspeed Landorus and drown it with its Water STAB, whereas it can also tank a hit from the Choice Scarf set. Bulkier variants of Kyogre can tank a +2 Life Orb Earthquake and OHKO in return with Scald. Lugia can only tank an unboosted Stone Edge, even in sand, and proceed to OHKO Landorus with Ice Beam. Multiscale Lugia can now afford a faster EV spread, meaning Lugia will hit Landorus before Landorus even gets the chance. Latias and Latios are immune to Landorus's Ground-type STAB move, and can set up on the Choice Scarf set if it is locked into Earthquake. Both are also faster than the Swords Dance set, and both can do a lot of damage with their Dragon-type STAB moves.</p> <p>If Landorus lacks Hidden Power Ice, then Gliscor turns it into setup bait and can stall it out with Toxic. Keldeo outspeeds the Swords Dance set and can OHKO with its STAB Hydro Pump. Hippowdon is not OHKOed by Grass Knot and can hit back hard with Ice Fang, although it takes massive damage from Grass Knot and Ice Fang does not score an OHKO. Landorus's low bulk makes it extremely weak to priority moves, such as Scizor's Bullet Punch and Extreme Speed from Rayquaza and Arceus. The rare Mamoswine deserves a mention, as not only does its STAB Ice Shard have priority, it can also score the KO on Landorus. Cloyster can tank an unboosted Stone Edge and break Landorus's Substitute with Icicle Spear, which OHKOs, or do a minimum of 96.23% with Ice Shard. If Landorus does not have a way to boost its Speed (Choice Scarf or Rock Polish), faster Pokemon such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Shaymin-S can become problematic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Base 101 Speed turns Landorus into a fantastic Choice Scarf user, as it gets the jump on Palkia and Salamence, two prominent Choice Scarf users in Ubers, and Pokemon that can boost their Speed, such as Rayquaza. Landorus fits extremely well in sandstorm teams thanks to Sand Force, which makes it very powerful, but it is not limited to those only. Choice Scarf Kyogre, one of the most common sets Kyogre runs, is easily 2HKOed by Earthquake, even outside of sandstorm, which can be a big deal for sandstorm teams. Landorus's high Speed also means that when equipped with Choice Scarf, it can outrun faster threats such as Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and Deoxys-A. One of the more threatening fast Pokemon in the tier is Mewtwo, which takes a minimum of 64.12% from Sand Force Earthquake, whereas U-turn, one of the reasons to use this set, does 46.32% minimum. Stone Edge grants wide coverage to Landorus with Earthquake, whereas U-turn allows Landorus to scout the foe's team with its high base Speed. Grass Knot hits Groudon that can wall this set otherwise; support variants are easily 2HKOed.</p> <p>Once again, the EVs and nature are self-explanatory: hit as hard as possible, and as fast as possible. The leftover EVs are dropped into Special Attack to slightly bump up Grass Knot's power. Hidden Power Ice can be used over Grass Knot to hit Rayquaza and Salamence, but you have Stone Edge for them anyway. Hidden Power Ice does hit Garchomp and Gliscor very hard, however. Rock Slide can be used if risking the miss is not to your likeliness, while the flinch chances are. Do note that the loss in power is significant, however. Punishment can use Arceus-Ghost's and Mewtwo's boosts against them by powering up the move. Landorus gets access to Outrage, and as appealing as the move might be, it makes Landorus a complete setup bait for Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Arceus-Steel.</p> <p>Skarmory and the Giratina formes put a full stop to this set, as thanks to their high base Defense, they can easily tank any of Landorus's moves. Thus, Pokemon that can deal with them, such as Darkrai and Dialga, make good partners, as they clear the way for Landorus. This set also appreciates entry hazards because it can force many switches with its immense power and U-turn. Therefore, Ferrothorn or Forretress make good partners; Forretress in particular can use Volt Switch which works extremely well with U-turn. A Volt Switch partner, such as Zekrom, Thundurus, or Thundurus-T, can form the VoltTurn combo with Landorus, which can become deadly with entry hazards. Tyranitar and Hippowdon are again key teammates, as they power up Earthquake and Stone Edge thanks to Sand Force. Tyranitar is the primary option, as it can tank special attacks, such as Ice Beam, a lot easier than Hippowdon, but both can work nevertheless.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Once it has a Swords Dance boost under its belt, Landorus's Attack reaches a shocking stat of 698. When this is backed up by Life Orb and Stone Edge, even Landorus's usual counters won't stand in its way. For example, 252/4+ Skarmory, one of Landorus's prime counters, takes a massive 72.75% - 85.92% from +2 Life Orb Stone Edge in sandstorm. Moreover, Stone Edge rounds off Landorus's coverage with Earthquake, which creates the EdgeQuake combo, which hits the vast majority of the tier for neutral damage. Earthquake is a phenomenal STAB and is Landorus's main attack; for example, 252/252+ Kyogre, one of the bulkiest Water-type Pokemon in the tier, has a 43.75% chance to be OHKOed by +2 Life Orb Earthquake from this set.</p> <p>For the fourth move, Rock Polish can be used to turn Landorus into a fast, strong sweeper, and makes Landorus's job easier against faster, frailer teams. However, if Groudon troubles you, Grass Knot is a viable option over Substitute, as it manages to do a minimum of 62.37% to 252 HP Groudon, whereas Earthquake needs a boost to 2HKO. Don't worry about the nature, Life Orb still guarantees the 2HKO with Jolly. Substitute can be used to take advantage of the switches that Landorus forces, by giving Landorus a free turn to hit the foe for a ton of damage.</p> <p>The EVs and nature are fairly straightforward; they allow Landorus to outspeed everything it can and hit as hard as it can. The choice between Life Orb and Leftovers depends on the moveset. Leftovers should only be used with Substitute, as it lets Landorus create more Substitutes during the match. However, thanks to the high power Life Orb provides, it remains as the main item.</p> <p>Smack Down and Gravity deserve a special mention, as they can work extremely well over Stone Edge. Once the effect is active, there's not a single Pokemon in the game that can avoid the immense power of Landorus's Ground STAB move. Smack Down gives Landorus a secondary coverage move, and although it's weaker than Stone Edge, it also allows Landorus to hit Rayquaza and Salamence immediately, if needed. Smack Down can be easily negated by switching out, whereas Gravity ensures that everything that switches in is going to be struck by Earthquake. In addition, Gravity means that Landorus's most common switch-ins, such as Skarmory and Giratina-O, will not only be vulnerable to Earthquake, but it also means they will take entry hazard damage. Moreover, while it can be a two-edged sword, it lowers the evasion of every Pokemon on the field by two stages. This means that moves that would sometimes miss, such as Draco Meteor, Thunder outside of the rain, and Fire Blast, are very likely to hit. Gravity does have a con though, as it also means that if Landorus switches into the battlefield while it's taking effect, Landorus will also take entry hazard damage.</p> <p>Landorus also has a few other options for this set. Hidden Power Ice can be used to get past Gliscor immediately, which would otherwise become annoying if you do not carry Smack Down or Gravity. Outrage can be used to hit the Dragon-types lurking everywhere for super effective damage, namely Giratina, but being locked into the move is not desired as Landorus become bait for Steel-types. Moreover, there's a good chance Landorus will hit itself due to confusion, and when it's boosted, Landorus is going to take a lot of its own HP. Explosion is a good option when Landorus has done its job, and it actually hits quite hard; 252/252+ Groudon has only a 18.75% chance to survive when Landorus uses Life Orb.</p> <p>Once Landorus gets to +2 Attack, nothing can switch into it safely due to its fantastic coverage, Smack Down, or Gravity. However, if Landorus is not using Substitute, it can be easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon, such as Latias and Mewtwo. If Smack Down or Gravity is absent, then Gliscor and Skarmory will become problematic. Thus, teammates that can handle the Pokemon mentioned above, such as Genesect and Xatu, can work along with this set. Sandstorm is a must for this set to become effective, as it dramatically increases Landorus's damage output. Tyranitar or Hippowdon are the only Pokemon for this job; Tyranitar is usually better as it can tank moves such as Palkia's Spacial Rend and Ice Beams much easier. Like any other sweeper, Landorus really appreciates entry hazards, so Pokemon such as Ferrothorn or Forretress make great teammates. Lastly, Landorus can take advantage of Wobbuffet's unique qualities. Wobbuffet can trap and kill Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Palkia, protect Landorus from status afflictions with Safeguard, and Encore moves that Landorus resists or is immune to, such as Earthquake or Thunder, to grant it a free turn of setup.</p>"

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T is a very interesting addition to BW2. With its sky-high base 145 Attack stat, Intimidate and good defensive typing, Landorus-T is an excellent physical tank that is a good alternative to Groudon for those who don't want Drought on their team. Don't make the mistake, however, of thinking that Landorus-T is just a \"Groudon replacement for rain teams\". It has a secondary Flying typing that brings Spikes and Toxic Spikes immunity, making the giant sun dinosaur, as well as Hippowdon, jealous. It also has U-turn for scouting switches. Not only can Landorus-T run tank sets, but it can also run sweeping sets, making it an excellent Groudon switch-in and Electric immunity for rain teams. Landorus-T's low Special Defense in a tier dominated by special attackers is a drawback, but this can easily be fixed with appropriate team support. If your rain team needs a bulky Ground-type with a greater offensive presence without using an Arceus forme, Landorus-T is the one for you.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf is not a bad option for Landorus-T. However, its base 91 Speed means it fails to outspeed +1 Rayquaza, which is a big landmark for most Choice Scarf users in the tier, and it is also outclassed by other Choice Scarfers such as Landorus, Garchomp, and Terrakion. Gravity is an interesting option, since it allows Landorus-T to hit Skarmory and Bronzong super effectively and Giratina-O harder with Earthquake. Smack Down is generally an inferior option to Gravity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Arceus-Grass is Landorus-T's worst enemy. While it is not the absolute best counter to Landorus-T, it causes rain teams that Landorus-T fits on many problems. It won't, however, enjoy Choice Band-boosted U-turns, especially with hazards up. Lugia can take a hit from Landorus-T without much trouble and OHKO in return with Ice Beam. Skarmory and Gliscor wall most of Landorus-T's sets, but both will lose to the SubSD set (Skarmory loses if Landorus-T is the last Pokemon). Giratina and Groudon can phaze out Landorus-T if they have Roar, and in Giratina's case, burn Landorus-T if it does not have Substitute or a Lum Berry. Physically defensive Arceus can also burn Landorus-T, Roar it out, or use Perish Song to stop last Pokemon SubSD variants. Although rare, Cresselia and Bronzong can wall Landorus-T and deal huge amounts of damage to it with either Ice Beam or Hidden Power Ice. Since Landorus-T's Special Defense is poor, special attackers that are faster than it can also put it out of commission extremely quickly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set is probably the most flexible of Landorus-T's sets. It can tank many physical attacks while supporting the team with Stealth Rock and creating free switches with U-turn. It is especially good on rain teams to take on Groudon, Excadrill, Terrakion, and Tyranitar. If Zekrom and Rayquaza do not run mixed sets, Landorus-T stops them pretty handily too, as well as Blaziken if the rain is up. What sets Landorus-T apart from other bulky Ground-types such as Gliscor and Hippowdon is the fact that it still hits very hard without much Attack investment. The choice between Toxic and U-turn can be interesting. Toxic allows Landorus-T to cripple support Groudon, as well as put Extreme Killer Arceus on a timer, allowing it to be more easily dispatched by the rest of your team. However, U-turn allows for more free switches and also gives momentum, capitalizing on Intimidate's ability to force switches. The last slot depends on what is more important to your team. Stone Edge offers the best coverage for Landorus-T, covering threats such as Rayquaza and Ho-Oh. Superpower allows Landorus-T to hit Extreme Killer Arceus hard, and if you run U-turn in the third slot and still wish to run Toxic, the latter is another option in the last slot.</p> <p>The Attack EVs listed allow Landorus-T to OHKO Dragon Dance Rayquaza after Stealth Rock and a round of Life Orb recoil; it can easily tank a +0 Outrage with the rest of the EVs maximizing its physical bulk. An additional 76 Speed EVs can be taken out of Defense and to put into Speed, allowing Landorus-T to outspeed and OHKO Tentacruel if you desire. Hidden Power Ice can be used to stop Gliscor from being the annoying bat that it normally is, as well as hitting Rayquaza about as hard as Stone Edge. However, Stone Edge is generally better due to being physical and hitting many relevant targets just like Hidden Power Ice, as well as OHKOing Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Landorus-T is best used on a rain team that needs a bulky pivot to switch into Groudon and Zekrom. It shares very good synergy with many rain team members—Kyogre can take Water- and Ice-type attacks (and most special attacks) aimed at Landorus-T, as can Ferrothorn, while Landorus-T can switch into Electric-type attacks for Kyogre and Fighting-type attacks for Ferrothorn. It is a very easy Pokemon to fit onto defensive rain team cores.</p> <p>While Landorus-T is very sturdy physically, note that some of the premier physical attackers in the tier still have ways of getting past it. While you can use Landorus-T to Intimidate Extreme Killer Arceus, make sure it is either as death fodder or Arceus is at low enough HP for Landorus-T to KO it (Earthquake generally does about 30%). This is because Arceus can easily just use Swords Dance again and brush Landorus-T aside. Also ensure you scout out Zekrom's and Rayquaza's sets thoroughly as well, as they can bluff physical sets and KO Landorus-T with Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Landorus-T cannot do much to Spikes users such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn. This is why having a Rapid Spin user or a Pokemon with Magic Bounce on its team can be very favorable. Tentacruel offers excellent coverage with Landorus-T for defensively oriented rain teams, while Kabutops is a good offensive rain spinner. Excadrill is not a bad spinner either, but it shares similar weaknesses with Landorus-T. Xatu is a good Magic Bounce user on rain teams, as the main Spikers in the tier are stopped by it. Grass Arceus is probably one of the most annoying enemies for rain teams and Landorus-T to face. Fortunately, it can do little to stop most Spikes users of your own, such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn. Since Landorus-T's Special Defense is pretty mediocre, special tanks and walls, particularly those that can switch into its weaknesses, are also good teammates. Specially defensive Kyogre can switch into most attacks directed at Landorus-T, as can Palkia, Dialga, Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Latias, although the latter shares a weakness to Ice.</p>"
      },
      "SubSD": {
        "description": "<p>With its excellent physical tanking ability and its high Attack stat, Landorus-T tends to force quite a lot of switches. This gives it many opportunities to set up Substitute and use Swords Dance to set up on physically defensive Pokemon such as Groudon and Ferrothorn. Substitute allows Landorus-T to block status, Leech Seed, and the phazing effects of Dragon Tail, while Swords Dance boosts its already massive Attack stat to monstrous levels. Earthquake and Stone Edge offer the best overall coverage. It is an excellent weapon for rain teams to use against sun and sand teams. For sun teams, Landorus-T can set up bulky Groudon variants with ease, while it counters both Excadrill and Tyranitar (provided the latter lacks Ice Beam) and finds easy opportunities to set up Substitute against Ferrothorn and Giratina that are found on sand teams.</p> <p>The EVs listed allow Landorus-T's Substitutes to survive anything that 0 Attack Groudon throws at it, with the exception of the rare Fire Blast, which means any defensive Groudon variant without Roar or Fire Blast becomes setup fodder. 76 Speed EVs allow Landorus-T to outspeed uninvested base 100s such as Tentacruel and Jirachi and destroy them with Earthquake before they try to do anything. The rest go into Attack, as even with only 140 Attack EVs, Landorus-T still reaches 397 Attack with an Adamant nature.</p> <p>Arceus-Grass is the biggest enemy to this set, as well as to rain teams in general. Lugia with Ice Beam also easily stops Landorus-T. Special attacking Giratina-O is immune to Earthquake and easily takes Stone Edges, while dealing heavy damage with Dragon Pulse or Draco Meteor. As far as teammates go, Kyurem-W can smash through them with its overpowered Ice Beams. Darkrai can put all of them to sleep and set up on them. Tornadus-T can Taunt them and fire off powerful Hurricanes. While Intimidate and Substitute stop Dragon Tail from forcing Landorus-T out, physical walls with Roar or Whirlwind, namely Roar Groudon, Giratina, Hippowdon, and Skarmory, can still force it out. Bulk Up Dialga is an excellent lure for all of them, as it can smash them with Draco Meteor, Fire Blast, or Thunder after they switch into Bulk Up. As for Landorus-T's weaknesses, specially defensive Kyogre, Blissey, Chansey, Latias, Palkia, and Ferrothorn are all good switch-ins to special attacks directed at Landorus-T.</p>"
      },
      "Double Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Landorus-T's excellent Attack stat and usable Speed make it a very powerful double dancer. Depending on the opposing team, Landorus-T can use Rock Polish to outspeed most things on an offensive team and deal heavy damage, or use Swords Dance to flatten slower, more defensive teams. Earthquake and Stone Edge provide the best general coverage. This set is best used on rain teams, especially against sun and sand teams. Sun teams usually lack a strong answer to Landorus-T, while sand teams can easily be swept if Giratina has been weakened enough. While Landorus-T fits best on a rain team, any hyper offensive team that does not want to use Groudon or Arceus-Ground could benefit from this set due to its physical bulk and important resistance to Fighting, as well as its immunities to Electric and Ground.</p> <p>The EVs used allow Landorus-T to be as powerful as possible while outspeeding Choice Scarf Terrakion after a Rock Polish boost. 80 HP EVs give Landorus-T a Life Orb number, while the rest go into Defense. Life Orb is the preferred item for the set as it allows Landorus-T to OHKO Genesect after Stealth Rock without a boost. However, Lum Berry is better against slower teams that depend on Will-O-Wisp to stop Landorus-T.</p> <p>While this set is called \"Double Dance,\" do not be afraid to remove one of the setup moves if you find it to be unnecessary. It is perfectly fine to run Rock Polish + 3 attacks or Swords Dance + 3 attacks if you are absolutely sure that you do not require the other setup move. In terms of moves that can potentially replace Rock Polish or Swords Dance, Superpower is a decent option to KO Ferrothorn more easily, while Explosion allows Landorus-T to go out with a bang, especially after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>One important thing to note about this set is that your main objective is not for Landorus-T to get both Rock Polish and Swords Dance under its belt, as this is generally too difficult to achieve. Instead, use Team Preview to scout what kind of team your opponent is using: if it has more fast, frail attackers, then use Rock Polish, and if it is slower and bulkier, use Swords Dance. However, do not hesitate to get both boosts when you get the opportunity, and this doesn't mean you should not bother with trying to create such opportunities; an example would be giving Landorus-T dual screens and Wobbuffet support. With dual screens, Landorus-T will be able to survive more attacks, while Wobbuffet gives it a free turn and protects it from status effects with Safeguard. Deoxys-S, Xatu, Latias, and most Arceus formes can set up dual screens with proficiency.</p> <p>Arceus-Grass walls this set badly, while Bold Lugia that run enough EVs to outspeed Landorus-T before a boost can also set up Reflect, Roost off the Stone Edge damage, and KO Landorus-T with Ice Beam or phaze it out with Dragon Tail or Whirlwind. Giratina-O can take a +2 Stone Edge and OHKO with Draco Meteor. Arceus-Grass and Lugia are both easy Spikes fodder for Ferrothorn and Skarmory, while offensively, Kyurem-W blasts through both without much trouble at all. Tornadus-T can also cause problems for both by firing off powerful Hurricanes and using Taunt to prevent recovery or status. Specially defensive Kyogre, Palkia, Dialga, Latias, and Blissey can all switch into most special attacks directed at Landorus-T.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Landorus-T's high Attack stat, access to U-turn, immunity to Spikes, and Intimidate make it an excellent candidate for a Choice Band set. It is especially powerful against many sun or sand teams that find switching into it difficult. Earthquake is Landorus-T's powerful and accurate STAB move. U-turn allows Landorus-T to scout around and keep offensive momentum, as well as deal a sizable chunk of damage to its greatest enemy, Arceus-Grass. Stone Edge gives the best coverage alongside Earthquake and U-turn. The last move is mainly to take down Extreme Killer Arceus, since Landorus-T can Intimidate Arceus and OHKO with either move. Superpower is generally the more useful move, as it also allows Landorus-T to deal a lot more damage to Ferrothorn. However, Explosion is a very powerful move that allows Landorus-T to OHKO Gliscor on the switch-in.</p> <p>The EVs used allow Landorus-T to always survive a +1 Extreme Speed from Life Orb Extreme Killer Arceus and OHKO in return with Superpower or Explosion, as well as allowing it to survive a +1 Judgment from 4 SpA Arceus formes that hit neutrally.</p> <p>Skarmory and Giratina-O are probably the best counters to Choice Band Landorus-T due to their immunity to Earthquake and high physical bulk to take Stone Edge with. Arceus-Grass is also annoying, but will be a lot less willing to switch into U-turn and face down a counter, especially with entry hazards up. Lugia does not enjoy boosted Stone Edges, but can take a hit and OHKO in return with Ice Beam. All of Landorus-T's usual counters still work well here. Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress can set up Spikes against Arceus-Grass. Kyurem-W and Tornadus-T can push through Lugia and Arceus-Grass easily, while Darkrai can take down Giratina-O. Latias, Palkia, Kyogre, Blissey, and Dialga are all good switch-ins for Landorus-T's weaknesses.</p>"

  "Kyurem-White": {
    "overview": "<p>Once upon a time, there lived a sad third brother named Kyurem. Day and night, it would be humiliated by its brothers Reshiram and Zekrom, the rest of the dragon tribe of the OU metagame, and millions of Pokemon trainers around the globe. The abuse was so horrific that the poor thing descended into UU, the land of mediocre Arcanine and Milotic. It prayed to Arceus, asking for respite from its constant torment. With the release of Black and White 2, the God of Pokemon answered its prayer. While the poor third brother remains neglected, it has gained a new forme with the most overpowering and spammable attacking stats ever. With base 170 Special Attack, it now has the most powerful Draco Meteor in the game to take advantage of, and its Ice-type STAB, which used to be the butt of many jokes, can smite the many walls in the Uber tier that are weak to Ice. It does have its downsides, however. Kyurem-W is quite poor defensively with its Ice typing, as it is weak to all forms of entry hazards while being rather lacking in the resistances department. This doesn't detract from its awesome attacking stats all that much, though. The ugly duckling of the Tao Trio has not returned as a beautiful swan, but as the sacker of cities and destroyer of worlds. The Pokemon world can now tremble in utter terror; because its name is White Kyurem, it rhymes with endurin', which is what its victims can't do as it skewers 'em!</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kyurem-W's movepool is surprisingly shallow for such a ridiculously powerful Pokemon. The most obvious move is Dragon Pulse, which can be used over Ice Beam for a reliable STAB move. The main problem is that between Draco Meteor and Ice Beam, you will hardly ever need Dragon Pulse. The super effective coverage granted from STAB Ice Beam is partly why Kyurem-W is so threatening, turning would-be counters such as Lugia into tissue paper in front of a cannon. Icy Wind can be a fun gimmick to slow down your opponent so you can take them out next turn, but should not be used as a serious option. Unlike its brother Kyurem-B, Kyurem-W has access to a strong Ice-type STAB attack that works off its higher offensive stat, which makes its signature move, Ice Burn, redundant. Endeavor can be used if you ever get Kyurem-W down to 1 HP, but is a gimmick at best.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>If your team lacks a Pokemon called Chansey, good luck trying to counter Kyurem-W, because she is the only Pokemon that isn't 2HKOed by any of Kyurem-W's attacks; although with Stealth Rock and a bit of prior damage, even she falls. In the same vein, Blissey can take most of Kyurem-W's attacks, but risks getting 2HKOed by Modest Choice Specs Focus Blast after Stealth Rock damage. Arceus-Rock in sandstorm is not a bad switch-in, although it gets 2HKOed by Focus Blast and cannot OHKO in return. If you can avoid switching into sun-boosted Fusion Flare or Earth Power, specially defensive Jirachi can sponge attacks from Kyurem-W, paralyze it with Body Slam, and take it out with Iron Head, all the while recovering its health with Wish. Arceus-Steel is in a similar position, although it finds itself OHKOed by Choice Specs Focus Blast. Bronzong and Heatran work similarly to Jirachi, although their lack of recovery means they get whittled down relatively quickly. Ho-Oh with a lot of Special Defense investment can take hits from Kyurem-W fairly well if Stealth Rock is kept off the field and can use Recover and Regenerator to quickly recover its health.</p> <p>Apart from that, taking on Kyurem-W generally comes down to prediction, as well as revenge killing. Getting Stealth Rock up early will limit the amount of times that Kyurem-W can switch in and wreak havoc. Dialga is an excellent Stealth Rock user, as most Pokemon that try to stop it will end up getting destroyed. Deoxys-S is great for getting Stealth Rock up quickly. Groudon, Ferrothorn, and Forretress are good, bulky options to get Stealth Rock up as well. In terms of revenge killers, anything faster than Kyurem-W that possesses a strong super effective move should do the trick. Palkia, Salamence, Terrakion, Garchomp, Mewtwo, Arceus formes, Latias, and Latios can all take down Kyurem-W easily, although those without a Choice Scarf will need to watch out for Choice Scarf variants. Excadrill in sand can outspeed and OHKO Kyurem-W with Iron Head; Kingdra and Kabutops in the rain can do a similar job. Scizor can also strip off copious amounts of health from Kyurem-W with Bullet Punch, should you be able to switch it in safely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>With base 170 Special Attack and two of the best STABs in the tier, it should not take a genius to figure out that Kyurem-W can run a Choice Specs set. With Specs attached, Kyurem-W reaches a sky-high 723 Special Attack (assuming a Modest nature), which means that it can obliterate virtually anything that switches in provided it picks the correct move. Kyurem-W's Draco Meteor is so powerful that it has around an 80% chance to OHKO 252 HP / 0 SpD Kyogre after Stealth Rock. It is even punching sizable holes into Blissey and bulky resists. For example, Blissey takes an average of 45% from a Modest Choice Specs Draco Meteor, and standard stallbreaker Heatran takes an average of 41% from the same attack. STAB Ice Beam is Kyurem-W's other main attraction. Even though it might seem redundant with Kyurem-W's Dragon STAB, Ice Beam hits more key threats than it might appear. It easily OHKOes Lugia, with Turboblaze negating Multiscale, and 2HKOes Ferrothorn and Ho-Oh without factoring in entry hazards. The last two moves brush up Kyurem-W's coverage, allowing it to hit everything that can take its STAB attacks. As inaccurate as Focus Blast is, it allows Kyurem-W to OHKO Tyranitar, Heatran (assuming Stealth Rock), and Arceus-Steel, as well as 2HKOing Blissey after Stealth Rock damage, assuming a Modest nature. The last move allows Kyurem-W to hit whatever is left, and depends on what weather you are running. Fusion Flare is best used if Kyurem-W can get sun support, as it OHKOes Jirachi and Bronzong in the sun, as well as OHKOing Arceus-Steel without having to resort to Focus Blast. Earth Power, on the other hand, is a better general move to use if you are not using a sun team to reliably 2HKO Jirachi, Bronzong (Turboblaze negates Levitate), and Arceus-Steel.</p> <p>The EVs used are as simple as they can get. Max Special Attack and Speed give Kyurem-W maximum offensive potential. The nature can be quite a hard decision to make, however. A Modest nature is preferred due to the sheer number OHKOs that it brings. With a Modest nature, Kyurem-W has a high chance to OHKO defensive Dialga and Kyogre with Draco Meteor, as well as 2HKO Blissey with Stealth Rock damage only. However, a Timid nature allows Kyurem-W to outrun the growing number of base 90 Speed Ubers that are running a positive Speed nature of their own, as well as Speed tie with Rayquaza, which in itself is huge.</p> <p>While hail is a rather difficult weather condition to keep up in Ubers, Blizzard is an excellent option on Kyurem-W if you do manage to keep it up. Choice Specs Blizzard is so powerful that it can 2HKO Choice Scarf Kyogre, assuming it hits both times. It also makes using Chansey to defend against Kyurem-W a lot harder, as it gets whittled down pretty easily with hail and entry hazards.</p> <p>One of Kyurem-W's biggest weaknesses is that it is extremely weak to entry hazards, especially to Stealth Rock. For this reason, spinners and Pokemon with Magic Bounce are very helpful to Kyurem-W's success. Tentacruel and Forretress are excellent defensive Rapid Spin users to use alongside Kyurem-W. Tentacruel has excellent special bulk and extra healing from the omnipresent rain, while Forretress synergizes extremely well with Kyurem-W. If you're after a more offensive Rapid Spin user, Excadrill and Kabutops are both good options. Xatu, and to a certain extent, Espeon, can also help to keep entry hazards off the field.</p> <p>Chansey is the only Pokemon that can avoid getting 2HKOed by any of Kyurem-W's attacks. Strong physical attackers are able to force her out and set up on her. Other than Chansey, specially defensive Jirachi and Bronzong are decent switch-ins, as they only fear Fusion Flare in the sun and Earth Power in Jirachi's case; Bronzong lacks recovery and will get whittled down quickly however. Arceus-Steel functions similarly, although on top of Fusion Flare and Earth Power, it also fears Focus Blast. Ho-Oh and Reshiram love switching into these Steel-types if you favor sunny weather. If your team is more rain-inclined, then Kyogre and other Water-types are good for drowning Jirachi and Arceus-Steel, and Excadrill, Garchomp, and Landorus make their lives difficult in the sand. Due to Kyurem-W's middling Speed, faster Dragon-types, Arceus with super effective STAB moves, and Terrakion can all revenge kill Kyurem-W fairly easily. The Giratina formes, Groudon, Landorus-T, and Gliscor are all good checks to Terrakion. Latias, Ho-Oh, and Mewtwo can easily take down Arceus-Fighting. As for Dragon-types, an Arceus-Steel of your own does well most of the time, while Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress can switch into many Dragon-type attacks and set up entry hazards.</p>"

      "Burning Red White Kyurem (Choice-less)": {
        "description": "<p>While the mind-blowing power of Choice Specs might be extremely tempting, Kyurem-W can tone down the firepower in exchange for the freedom to switch attacks. Draco Meteor and Ice Beam are Kyurem-W's two STAB moves that maim virtually everything that does not resist them. The last two slots are where things get interesting. Basically, Kyurem-W has two slots to make best use of five potential moves. Focus Blast and Roost are the most preferred as the former gives the widest coverage (despite its horrible accuracy) and the latter lets Kyurem-W recover off its numerous sources of residual damage. Fusion Flare and Earth Power provide more specific coverage in the third slot against Jirachi and Bronzong in the sun and the rain, respectively. In the final slot, Substitute is also an option for Kyurem-W to ease prediction as well as avoid being revenge killed. Alternatively, you can run a fourth coverage move.</p> <p>Kyurem-W has the ability to run a SubRoost set, but is generally lacking in coverage against key threats, such as Tyranitar and Arceus-Steel if it does, especially when the use of Substitute favors the use of Leftovers. While Draco Meteor and Ice Beam give very good coverage, Kyurem-W really likes an additional coverage move. As for other moves that Kyurem-W can use, Outrage is a decent option. It is a common strategy for players to send Kyogre into Kyurem-W after it gets a Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor, and Outrage allows Kyurem-W to 2HKO max HP Kyogre, as well as 2HKOing Chansey after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item on Kyurem-W simply because of the power that it brings. However, Haban Berry can be used to bluff a Choice set to lure in Dragon-type revenge killers such as Palkia, survive the incoming Dragon-type attack, and KO another Pokemon at the same time. Leftovers works well with Substitute, as it gives Kyurem-W passive recovery that really helps its already flailing durability. The EVs are max Special Attack and max Speed for maximum offensive prowess. A Timid nature is preferred, as most of the OHKOs that a Modest nature can provide require the use of Choice Specs. As Choice Specs is not used on this set, a Timid nature is preferred so Kyurem-W is able to outspeed all the Ubers with base 90 Speed, as well as Speed tie with Rayquaza.</p> <p>Tentacruel, Forretress, Kabutops, and Excadrill are excellent Rapid Spin users for clearing away entry hazards that limit Kyurem-W's durability. Xatu and Espeon can help keep entry hazards off to a certain extent as well. In terms of Pokemon that Kyurem-W has trouble with, strong physical attackers can be used to set up on Chansey. Strong Fire-types such as Ho-Oh and Reshiram, strong Water-types such as Kyogre, Palkia and Swift Swimmers, and many sand sweepers such as Excadrill and Garchomp make Jirachi and Arceus-Steel's lives miserable in Kyurem-W's favor. The Giratina formes, Groudon, Lugia, and Gliscor are all good counters to Terrakion, and an Arceus-Steel of your own can take on most of the Dragon-types that run around in the Uber tier.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Kyurem-W's overpowering base 170 Special Attack and usable base 95 Speed make it a decent Choice Scarf user, despite its weakness to Stealth Rock. It can easily OHKO Darkrai with Draco Meteor or even Ice Beam if Darkrai has taken some prior damage and easily does over 60% to +1 Mewtwo, limiting its sweep. It is also an excellent Pokemon to stick on a sun team to take out troublesome Arceus-Ground, on a rain team to deal with Arceus-Grass, or on a sand team to crush Gliscor. Furthermore, while its base 95 Speed only allows Kyurem-W to Speed tie with Dragon Dance Rayquaza at best, it still outspeeds some of the common Uber Choice Scarf users that only have base 90 Speed, most notably Kyogre and Zekrom. If its counters are eliminated, Kyurem-W can easily clean up late-game by spamming Ice Beam from its 439 Special Attack. Draco Meteor and Ice Beam are pretty much essential; the other two moveslots are pretty much up to your tastes. Focus Blast is the preferred third move due to its overall coverage, but Fusion Flare and Earth Power can be used to take out Jirachi and Arceus-Steel in sun and rain, respectively. Outrage is the preferred last option, as Kyurem-W cannot OHKO Latias with a Calm Mind up without it. It might also allow Kyurem-W to 2HKO Blissey switch-ins as well as Kyogre variants that don't run a lot of bulk. However, Focus Blast can be used with Fusion Flare or Earth Power for maximum coverage, while Sleep Talk can allow Kyurem-W to operate as an effective sleep absorber against Darkrai.</p> <p>Blizzard can be used over Ice Beam if you have hail support but is generally not advised due to how difficult it is to keep hail up in Ubers. A Hasty or Timid nature along with max Speed investment allows Kyurem-W to outspeed as many threats as possible as well as Speed tie with Dragon Dance Rayquaza at worst.</p> <p>Rapid Spin helps Kyurem-W go a long way. Tentacruel, Forretress, Excadrill, and Kabutops are good Rapid Spin users in Ubers. Ho-Oh, Reshiram, Kyogre, Excadrill, Garchomp, and Arceus-Ground are all good at taking on Jirachi and Arceus-Steel, and bulky Steel-types are helpful for taking on faster Dragon-types such as Choice Scarf Palkia that try to revenge kill Kyurem-W. Strong physical attackers such as Groudon, Excadrill, Terrakion, and Extreme Killer Arceus are fine at setting up on Blissey and Chansey.</p>"

  "Genesect": {
    "overview": "<p>Rising from the ashes of the nuclear fire, the Team Plasma Systems Model 101, Genesect, finally comes to the present! Scizor may be the first thing to come in mind when you think of \"Bug / Steel type Pokemon that maintains momentum with U-turn\", but Genesect brings a whole new twist on the familiar role thanks to its many unique attributes. Unlike Scizor, Genesect has a good base 99 Speed and an excellent special movepool that, when combined with a Choice Scarf chip, allows Genesect to revenge kill dominant life forms such as Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza, and Darkrai. Skynet's new warrior is also equipped with a top of the line combat ability in Download, which means one of Genesect's attack stats will always be boosted when it switches in. Because of Download, Genesect's above average base 120 attack stats will become the equivalent of a monstrous uninvested 189 base Attack with 0 EVs, and near an even more murderous base fully invested 205 Attack with 252 EVs!</p> <p>All of Genesect's excellent qualities may make it look like the beginning of the end for humanity, but fortunately for us humans (and unfortunately for Skynet), Genesect doesn't have what it takes to bring forth the apocalypse alone! Genesect's greatest flaw is that unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger, this robotic assassin isn't very durable, with even unboosted Draco Meteors and Life Orb Mewtwo's unboosted Psystrike chipping off over 50% of the insectinator's health, which means that most neutral hits in Ubers will fry Genesect's CPU. Also, because Genesect constantly switches out due to U-turn, the prominence of Stealth Rock and Spikes in Ubers and the difficulty in spinning will quickly wear down Genesect's exoskeleton, making its warranty even shorter than usual. Finally, while Genesect does take advantage of an Attack boost from Download via U-turn, it's a shame that the only other worthwhile physical attacks Genesect has are Iron Head and Explosion. However, once you get past the durability and movepool issues, you're still left with one of the most dangerous U-turn users the game has to offer. So while Genesect may not cause the end of the world as we know it, Genesect, much like the Terminator, is one hell of a lethal machine!</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Genesect may be dangerous, Skynet didn't give this Terminator model a very wide movepool. Charge Beam can be used to boost Genesect's Special Attack, but Genesect is usually better off predicting its defensive switch-ins instead of hoping for another Special Attack boost. Flame Charge can boost Genesect's Speed, but is mostly outclassed by Rock Polish. Dark Pulse is the hardest Genesect can hit Arceus-Ghost, but its usefulness ends there. Thunderbolt allows Genesect to always hit Ho-Oh in the sun, but it's such a weak move vs Kyogre that Thunder is better most of the time. Metal Sound can be used to scare many walls with the idea of getting KOed, but their ability to simply switch makes this strategy only useful with entry hazards.</p> <p>Choice Specs may seem like a natural fit for Genesect's great special attacking movepool, but the choice restrictions and the inability to boost U-turn's power make this one of Genesect's lesser sets. Insect Plate can be used to boost Genesect's U-turn power, but Choice Band is usually the better way to go for powerful U-turns.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Genesect is out there. It can't be bargained with; it can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead. However, what makes Genesect even more difficult to counter than most cyberkinetic assassins is its habit of U-turning out of the battlefield before you can say \"Hasta la vista baby!\". Thankfully, you can exploit Genesect's U-turn strategies by setting up Spikes and Stealth Rock, which will force the synthetic assassin to sacrifice 25% of its health each time it scouts. Ferrothorn in particular can use most of Genesect's non super effective or scouting attacks to set up Spikes, while Forretress and Skarmory can set up Spikes on physically based Genesect that aren't U-turning.</p> <p>While Genesect may be difficult to directly counter, there are several Pokemon that can take most of its attacks. Bulky Arceus-Ghost is one of the best checks in the game, as it can take on most of Genesect's attacks, and can even threaten to set up Calm Mind when Genesect doesn't U-turn. Arceus-Steel can also generally out-machine Genesect as long as it doesn't switch into a boosted Flamethrower in the sun. Specially defensive Dialga braces anything except boosted Flamethrowers in the sun and Hidden Power Fighting, and can threaten to OHKO Genesect with a Fire attack of its choice. Heatran defeats Genesect even more easily than Dialga thanks to Flash Fire. Provided that it's raining, bulky Excadrill isn't 2HKOed by anything but a boosted Hidden Power Fighting, and it can hit Genesect hard with Earthquake. Ho-Oh can take anything but Explosion and Thunder and use Genesect as the perfect time to set up a Substitute. In a similar manner as Ho-Oh, Reshiram and Arceus-Fire can switch into most of Genesect's attacks and threaten to either set up or unleash powerful sun-boosted Fire attacks. Specially defensive Giratina isn't 2HKOed by any of Genesect's moves (with the exception of a Life Orb +1 Ice Beam), and can threaten to either phaze or cripple Genesect's scouting power with Will-O-Wisp. As far as more situational checks go, Blaziken can switch into U-turn with its 4x Bug resistance to get a free Speed Boost turn, while Wobbuffet can trap and revenge kill any Choice Scarf Genesect that isn't locked into a Bug attack.</p> <p>Non-Choice Genesect can be a bit trickier to directly counter due to Download and its excellent coverage, but generally, any Pokemon that is faster than Genesect in Ubers has a good chance of crashing its hard drive after a kill, such as Mewtwo, Palkia, Hidden Power Fire Latias, and most Choice Scarf Pokemon.</p>",

      "Physically Based Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Equipped with a high speed Choice Scarf processor, this model of Genesect is one of the most dangerous scouting machines in existence! U-turn is key to Genesect's success at wearing down organic beings, allowing Genesect to deal a good amount of damage to the enemy while allowing your army to keep control of the offensive momentum. Even without a Download boost, Genesect can still deal 66.7% - 79.7% to Mewtwo and 83.7% - 100% to Darkrai (a 74% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock damage). After a Download boost, Genesect's scouting duties become much more dangerous to the opponent, allowing U-turn to OHKO Mewtwo, Latias, and Latios, and also inflicting 52-61% to 4 HP Kyogre, 50-59% to Timid Palkia, 45-53% to Timid Kyurem-W, and 62-74% to max HP Arceus-Grass.</p> <p>Ice Beam is one of Choice Scarf Genesect's main tools for assassination, allowing it to outspeed and terminate threats that are 4x weak to Ice such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza, Garchomp, Shaymin-S, Gliscor, Salamence, and Landorus. With the power of Download, Genesect's Ice Beam can also severely damage 252 HP Groudon (who takes 64-76%) and 4 HP Zekrom (who takes 70-83%).</p> <p>While Explosion's power has dwindled this generation, a Download boost will ensure that Genesect's sacrifice won't be in vain, allowing the metallic martyr to vaporize max HP Kyogre, max HP Ho-Oh, Palkia, Reshiram, and Kyurem-W. In emergencies, you can even use Genesect's Extreme Speed resistance to wear down an Arceus with an unboosted Explosion, dealing 49-58% to max HP Arceus and 57-68% to 4 HP Arceus. While Iron Head offers poor coverage, Genesect's hyperalloy skull shatters Kyurem-W after the Download boost, and before the boost, deals 83-98% to Terrakion and 63-75% to Kyurem-B. Iron Head also has a 30% chance of flinching, allowing Genesect to infuriate even the most well-prepared general if Lady Luck is on your side.</p> <p>If you are willing to give up Explosion or Iron Head, Genesect has two other options to choose from. Flamethrower is Genesect's best chance of hurting most Steel-types in the sun, allowing it to OHKO Forretress, Skarmory, and Scizor (assuming a Download boost), deal 92-100% to Ferrothorn, and 2HKO Excadrill. Be warned though, if your army has rain support, Flamethrower becomes pathetically weak, only being able to 2HKO Forretress and Scizor. The final, most niche choice is X-Scissor. X-Scissor deals less damage to Ghosts, both Kyurem, Terrakion, and has no chance of flinching which usually makes it a less effective weapon than Iron Head, but the extra damage done to Mewtwo, Darkrai, Latias, Kyogre, and Palkia can help Genesect clean through some weakened armies more easily after a boost. One final configuration to note is your Genesect's nature. Naive allows Genesect to take less from physical priority attacks like Extreme Speed, while Hasty allows Genesect to take a bit less from the many powerful special Dragon attacks.</p> <p>Genesect's Choice Scarf processor and scouting routines with U-turn make it an incredibly independent machine that can work on almost any kind of army, but there are a few things to consider that can make Genesect even more effective than usual. Always try to take advantage of Genesect's common switch-ins, which include Ho-Oh, Lugia, Arceus-Ghost, Giratina, Dialga, and most other Steel-type Pokemon. While checking these Pokemon isn't a bad idea, one of the best ways to take advantage of U-turn is to pair Genesect with powerful, momentum shifting teammates. Choice Scarf and Choice Specs Kyogre are a great example of this, not only setting up rain, but also giving Kyogre the perfect opportunity to unleash a healthy Water Spout depending on the enemy. Choice Kyogre also does a good job of drowning Ho-Oh, Arceus-Ghost, and Forretress. Life Orb Deoxys-A is another example of a great Genesect teammate, using Genesect's U-turn support to patch up its issue with switching in, and letting loose insanely powerful Psycho Boosts. If your army prefers a Pokemon who can take a hit but still offers similar power to Deoxys-A, then Kyurem-W is an excellent alternative. With Choice Specs or Life Orb, almost nothing can switch into Kyurem-W's super powerful Draco Meteors besides Steel-types and Chansey/Blissey, and Fusion Flare and Focus Blast will smash most Steel-types, while Choice Specs can defeat Blissey and Chansey with Focus Blast and hazards support. Choice Specs Kyurem-W is also a good response to most Giratina and Dialga switch-ins after a U-turn. Other Dragon-type Pokemon with powerful Draco Meteors like Rayquaza, Dialga, Palkia, Latios, and Reshiram will also perform a good job of complementing Genesect's U-turn support if Kyurem-W doesn't fit into your team. If your team has sun support, Ho-Oh can be a great soldier to pair with Genesect. Several of the Pokemon Genesect lures in have serious issues with Ho-Oh in the sun (such as Ferrothorn, Dialga, and Arceus-Ghost). Ho-Oh can use Genesect's Fire weaknesses as a great time to switch-in, and thanks to Regenerator and Roost, Ho-Oh can be a great U-turn partner for a longer time than most of Genesect's regular teammates. While Terrakion has issues with Arceus-Ghost and Giratina, it does a great job of smashing through Dialga and Ferrothorn with Close Combat, and ripping Ho-Oh to shreds with Stone Edge. Choice Band Landorus-T can also defeat Dialga, Ferrothorn (if you have Superpower), and Ho-Oh, and can use its own U-turn to form a momentum-keeping partnership with Genesect. Finally, while Darkrai doesn't have the powerful unboosted attacks like the former teammates, Genesect's U-turn support gives Darkrai the perfect opportunity to put a life form to sleep with Dark Void, and it still does a good job of scaring out Giratina, Arceus-Ghost, and Lugia.</p> <p>Genesect's biggest problem is being worn down by Stealth Rock and Spikes, but ironically Genesect also loves hazards support to make switching out of U-turn more punishing than usual. While Genesect doesn't need Spikes and Rapid Spin support to function, it can make the hyperalloy scout a more effective soldier. Tentacruel is one of the best Rapid Spin users around for Genesect, with a resistance to Genesect's only weakness, Fire. Genesect can also revenge kill some of Tentacruel's problems such as Mewtwo and Latios. While it does share the Fire weakness, Excadrill can use Rapid Spin, offers Stealth Rock, and has the ability to slam Dialga with a STAB Earthquake. Forretress can provide Genesect with Rapid Spin and Spikes support to punish your enemy for switching out, and even has access to Volt Switch to keep momentum on your army's side. If you just need a Spiker, then Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Deoxys-S, and Deoxys-A are still fine choices if your army doesn't need Rapid Spin support. While a more risky option than spinning, Genesect can be paired with one of the two Magic Bounce users, Espeon or Xatu, to take care of hazards. Another option for extending Genesect's warranty is to pair it with the viable Wish users of Ubers: Chansey, Blissey, and Jirachi. One final thing to note is that if your team deals with entry hazards and has Drought support, Ho-Oh is an even greater teammate than usual!</p>"

      "Specially Based Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>While Genesect has the usual Choice Scarf processor, this model takes a radically different approach to using it. Instead of focusing on wearing down the opposition with fast, boosted U-turns, this model of Genesect invests in Special Attack EVs to take advantage of its excellent special attacking movepool, allowing Genesect to have an easier time cleaning teams and gain new KOs vs several threats in Ubers. As a side effect, U-turn is significantly less powerful, now needing Stealth Rock to OHKO 160 HP Latias 79% of the time. Despite this setback, U-turn will still be Genesect's most commonly used attack because of its ability to scout and wear down the enemy army.</p> <p>Ice Beam is Genesect's weapon of choice for the many Pokemon in Ubers that are 4x weak to Ice, and thanks to the Special Attack investment, a boosted Ice Beam will almost always terminate minimum HP Zekrom and minimum HP Groudon after Stealth Rock damage. Additionally, a boosted Ice Beam can 2HKO physically defensive Giratina and max HP Arceus-Ground.</p> <p>There are 3 viable special attacking weapons left in this model's arsenal; the right combination of them greatly depends on your army's needs. While Bug Buzz may seem like a redundant weapon with U-turn, it does a great job of helping Genesect sweep through weakened teams after a Special Attack boost. For example, a +1 Bug Buzz will OHKO Darkrai and Mewtwo, and also 2HKO fairly bulky offensive Pokemon like Latias, Groudon, Zekrom, Kyurem-W, and minimum HP Kyogre. Flamethrower is Genesect's weapon of choice for most Steel-type Pokemon, and the extra Special Attack investment this model has makes it Genesect's most powerful weapon in the sun, giving +1 Genesect a 91% chance of 2HKOing max HP Arceus. Finally, while most of Thunder's targets give Genesect an Attack boost, it still allows Genesect to 2HKO max HP Kyogre and Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage. With a Special Attack boost, Genesect can also 2HKO Lugia after Stealth Rock damage, OHKO Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage, 2HKO Forretress, and OHKO Skarmory.</p> <p>If your army is dead set on having Bug Buzz to ease cleaning, then Flamethrower is the best final choice on sun teams for the extra power, while Thunder is the best choice on rain teams for 100% accuracy and the ability to still OHKO Skarmory and 2HKO Forretress. If your army has both Kyogre and Groudon, or if you feel that better coverage trumps easier cleaning power, then you can use both Thunder and Flamethrower over Bug Buzz.</p> <p>There are several different EV modifications for this model of Genesect that may fit your army better if you are willing to make a few sacrifices. If you are willing to give up on some cleaning power and the ability to always OHKO min HP Zekrom after Stealth Rock, you can opt to use an EV spread of 88 Atk / 196 SpA / 224 Spe. The Attack EVs allow Genesect to OHKO offensive Mewtwo and 160 HP Latias after Stealth Rock damage with a boosted U-turn, while the 224 Speed EVs allow Genesect to still outspeed Dragon Dance Rayquaza.</p> <p>If your army is fine with sacrificing Genesect's revenge killing power vs Dragon Dance Rayquaza and the many Choice Scarf users of Ubers, you can choose to use a Rash nature for more Special Attack. In addition to allowing Genesect to clean through weakened armies more easily, Rash will also allow Genesect's boosted Ice Beam to OHKO max HP Groudon after Spikes damage, and OHKO max HP Kyogre with Thunder with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Furthermore, if your army is fine with not being able to outspeed neutral natured base 90 Choice Scarf users like Kyogre, you can use an EV spread of 136 Atk / 252 SpA / 120 Spe. 120 Speed EVs is enough for Choice Scarf Genesect to outspeed Mewtwo, while the remaining 136 EVs give U-turn a healthy increase in power, now allowing Genesect's +1 U-turn to always OHKO Mewtwo after Stealth Rock, and always 2HKO Timid Palkia after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>The final viable EV spread for Rash is 252 Atk / 136 SpA / 120 Spe. This Genesect still has a higher Special Attack stat than the standard special Scarf model by 2 points, but it also has the same Attack stat as the physical Scarf set, allowing you to use Explosion or Iron Head over the usual coverage moves if you are willing to give up more revenge killing power.</p> <p>Because this Genesect model is the preferred set for cleaning through weakened teams, adding Spikes to the usual Stealth Rock support can make this set much more effective. Deoxys-S, Deoxys-A, and Froslass are good examples of Spikers for offensive teams, but more defensive Spikers like Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory are reasonable options for some teams as well.</p>"

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Genesect's amazing revenge killing power can be difficult to replace, but if you are willing to take the risks, Expert Belt Genesect can provide benefits to your army that few Pokemon can match. In addition to netting Genesect even more KOs than usual, Expert Belt is a great bluffing item, allowing your army to get surprise KOs vs many slower Pokemon that think you will be forced to switch out due to Choice Scarf.</p> <p>As usual, U-turn is Genesect's weapon for scouting, and it does a good job of fooling the enemy into thinking your Genesect is a specially based Choice Scarf set. Ice Beam will do far more than just terminate the usual 4x weak Pokemon, as a Special Attack boost allows Ice Beam to OHKO Groudon and mixed Giratina-O, and 2HKO physically defensive Giratina. Thunder zaps Kyogre, Lugia, and Ho-Oh, and with a Download boost, it will OHKO Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage, OHKO Lugia after Stealth Rock damage 56% of the time, and OHKO max HP Kyogre 62% of the time after Stealth Rock damage. +1 Flamethrower will OHKO most Steel-types in the sun, but even if the weather is rainy, Genesect can still 2HKO Ferrothorn and OHKO Forretress after Stealth Rock damage. If your army has Drizzle support, Hidden Power Fighting can be an appealing alternative to Flamethrower, with +1 Hidden Power Fighting being able to 2HKO support Dialga, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn at the cost of being walled by Jirachi.</p> <p>While Expert Belt is the preferred item for its luring capabilities, Life Orb can still be a reasonable choice. While Life Orb will cut Genesect's warranty when combined with U-turn and hazards damage, it does gain some new KOs. A boosted Ice Beam will now always terminate max HP Groudon, and 2HKO specially defensive Giratina after Stealth Rock damage. Also, boosted Thunders will now OHKO Kyogre and Lugia after Stealth Rock damage, while boosted Flamethrowers in the sun will now 2HKO support Dialga. Finally, Genesect's U-turn will now become far more powerful, now being able to do 50% to max HP Kyogre after a boost.</p> <p>If your army is willing to give up the amazing momentum keeper in U-turn, you can opt to replace U-turn with Rock Polish, and use a Timid nature. As a Speed-boosting cleaner, Genesect has trouble competing directly with Groudon and Landorus-T due to its reliance on a Download boost. However, Genesect can still do a nice job of hitting Pokemon hard with its good coverage, so the strategy behind Rock Polish Genesect is to play it much like the regular special attacking set, and focus more on using Rock Polish as a more situational / surprise set-up move, rather than the kind of sweeper you may focus a team around supporting. Note that if you want to destroy healthy Mewtwo and Darkrai and deal a good amount of damage to Latias, Thunder or Flamethrower will need to be replaced with Bug Buzz.</p> <p>Another alternate approach to this model of Genesect is to use a mixed attacking EV spread of 128 Atk / 128 SpA / 252 Spe with a Life Orb. The Special Attack EVs give a boosted Ice Beam enough power to OHKO max HP Groudon after Stealth Rock damage, 2HKO support Dialga in the sun with boosted Flamethrower, and deal around 1% less damage than Expert Belt Genesect vs most other Pokemon. With the Attack investment, you can now run Explosion or Iron Head over Thunder or Flamethrower. Explosion is insanely powerful after a boost, being able to terminate max HP Arceus and max HP Kyogre after Stealth Rock damage, and even deal 52-62% to support Dialga! Iron Head on the other hand, allows Genesect to crush both Kyurem formes and 2HKO max HP Arceus after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The most valuable support you can give any of these special attacking Genesect sets is paralysis support, because most Pokemon that outspeed Genesect can crash its hard drive. Thunder Wave Kyogre is a superb teammate for this, with its ability to lure in Latias, Palkia, and Arceus-Grass, none of which like taking boosted U-turns. Arceus-Fighting still does a good job of luring in Latias, but can also attract Mewtwo and deal with Dialga that switch into Genesect's U-turn. Groudon can also attract Latias, but can also paralyze fast Lugia switch-ins to prevent it from stalling Genesect with Roost. While Jirachi may unfortunately share Genesect's Fire weakness, it does a good job of spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave, Thunder, or Body Slam, and can extend Genesect's warranty with Wish support. Ferrothorn is also a good paralysis spreader that can also extend Genesect's lifespan with Leech Seed. Finally, while Thundurus must often sacrifice itself to paralyze fast Pokemon via Prankster Thunder Wave, many of these fast Pokemon will take a serious amount of damage from Genesect's attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>A Choice Band processor may seem like an odd choice considering Genesect's narrow physical movepool, but when combined with Download, Genesect can fire off U-turns so powerful that any lifeform that doesn't resist it will take an incredible amount of damage. For example, +1 U-turn can deal near or over 50% to Ferrothorn, max HP Kyogre, max HP Arceus, offensive Groudon, bulky Excadrill, Zekrom, Tentacruel, and Jirachi. Even Rayquaza, defensive Groudon, and Lugia will usually take over 35% from these monstrous boosted U-turns!</p> <p>The other big selling point of Choice Band Genesect is Explosion. Explosion already deals plenty of damage coming from Choice Scarf Genesect, so when Choice Band Genesect unleashes it, Explosion will deal such ungodly amounts of damage that even Skynet would consider it a worthy addition to its nuclear arsenal! A +1 Explosion is so powerful that Arceus-Steel, Skarmory, Forretress, and specially defensive Dialga can take over 60% from it, leaving only three Ubers viable Pokemon who don't resist a boosted Explosion that can survive it after Stealth Rock damage: defensive Groudon, defensive Arceus, and defensive Landorus-T; even those three usually still take over 80%!</p> <p>Iron Head pairs well with U-turn and Explosion, and when boosted, it allows Genesect's reinforced skull to 2HKO Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, and Excadrill, and after Stealth Rock damage, it 2HKOes Ho-Oh, Lugia, specially defensive Giratina, and Reshiram. Finally, while this may be a Choice Band set, Genesect still appreciates a special attack to help patch up its poor coverage. Ice Beam will let Genesect OHKO Rayquaza and 2HKO defensive Groudon, while Flamethrower is Genesect's best non suicidal attack vs Skarmory and Forretress.</p> <p>This model of Genesect does best when it has paralysis support, so Thunder Wave Kyogre, Groudon, and Arceus-Fighting are good teammates for luring in and crippling Latias. While Jirachi may share Genesect's Fire weakness, it's one of the few paralysis spreaders that can keep Genesect alive longer via Wish. Ferrothorn won't restore as much health as Jirachi, but it can take on Kyogre that lack Choice Specs when Genesect is locked into Iron Head. Thundurus is one of the few paralysis spreaders that has a powerful scouting move in Volt Switch to support your army, though it must often sacrifice itself to paralyze faster enemies like Mewtwo and Darkrai. Dialga also deserves special mention for its ability to not only paralyze the enemy with Thunder Wave, but also scare out the physically defensive Giratina that attempt to switch-in.</p>"
