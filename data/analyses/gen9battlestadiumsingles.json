Clodsire, the most noteworthy special wall in the format, can fall to an Analytic-boosted Flash Cannon or Steel Beam when carrying Choice Specs.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: A Fairy-type Tera Blast is very useful against common Dragon-types, most notably Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting: Gaining a resistance to Dark allows Magnezone to surprise and defeat Kingambit and Hydreigon, ignoring the former's Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass: Grass has excellent defensive and offense synergy with Magnezone, especially through its utility against Ground-type attackers and Spore immunity. Most notably, Tera Blast Grass can OHKO max SpD Hippowdon with Choice Specs.

Water lacks a Ground resistance or a Spore immunity, but it gives Magnezone a much-appreciated Fire resistance for Pokemon like Skeledirge. Much like in the case of Grass, Tera Blast Water can OHKO Hippowdon, while also having the possibility of KOing Unaware Clodsire, although the risk it runs when considering Water Absorb should be noted.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel: The boost from Tera Steel makes Steel Beam absurdly powerful, with Analytic letting Choice Specs Magnezone OHKO even offensive Multiscale Dragonite!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Modest: Running at least some Speed investment lets Magnezone outspeed critical Pokemon like Azumarill, Corviknight, Skeledirge, and Kingambit. 252 EVs give Magnezone a chance at outspeeding slow Mimikyu, Dragonite, Gholdengo, and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 252 SpA / 60 Spe with Modest: Magnezone's excellent typing means you often switch it into attacks, especially if you aren’t using Sturdy as an ability.

Sturdy also helps Magnezone play around Dondozo, as it can safely come in on Fissure and use Volt Switch against it, which renders Yawn moot. However, if Magnezone switches into a Yawn and not Fissure, it should be noted that Dondozo often runs Protect to block Volt Switch and ensure Magnezone falls asleep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Magnet Pull</strong>: Magnet Pull ensures Magnezone can eliminate Corviknight. In the case Magnezone uses Fighting as its Tera Type, Magnet Pull also allows it to beat both Kingambit and Tera Steel Hydreigon with more reliability.</p> </li> </ul> "
