Freeze-Dry is much less powerful but is more consistent at pressuring Water-types like Basculegion and Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Thanks to its high Speed and increased physical bulk in snow, Alolan Ninetales does not normally want to Terastallize. It’s true it can help with Steel-types moves from Scizor and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, but it is often more advisable to play around this weakness through its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a balanced defensive typing that completely flips Alolan Ninetale's Steel-type weakness, all but guaranteeing it can set Aurora Veil. It also resists Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes--a common counter against screens--though Alolan Ninetales will normally survive it without Terastallizing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire can be used offensively and defensively against Steel-types, with invested Tera Blast usually OHKOing Scizor and 2HKOing Gholdengo. Do note though that this comes at the cost of having a dramatically worse Urshifu-R matchup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice lets Alolan Ninetales keep its Defense boost in snow while increasing its offensive output, letting it more consistently 2HKO Dondozo with Freeze-Dry.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Light Clay</strong>: Light Clay extends Aurora Veil's duration and makes it much harder for the opponent to play around it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash is good insurance against fast super effective hits, but it's overall less useful in the majority of matchups.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spread</h1> <ul> <li><strong>36 HP / 212 Def / 4 SpA / 52 SpD / 204 Spe with Timid</strong>: With heavy investment in physical bulk, Alolan Ninetales in snow almost always avoids the OHKO from unboosted Scizor's Bullet Punch and always avoids the OHKO from Ogerpon’s super effective Ivy Cudgel. The Speed investment lets Alolan Ninetales outrun Jolly Garchomp.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Shell Smash and Skill Link more than make up for Cloyster's weak Attack stat, making it a formidable sweeper that Focus Sash and Mimikyu can't easily stop.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Shard</strong>: Priority may seem like overkill, but it helps pick off weakened threats without setup. It also gets around priority attacks from Breloom, Dragapult, and Meowscarada after a Shell Smash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Blast</strong>: This is Closyer's best shot at dealing with the many Tera Fires that resist Icicle Spear, as well as OHKOing Chien-Pao, Iron Bundle, and Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drill Run</strong>: This hits Gholdengo and other Steel-types hard without needing to Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is the preferred nature to maximize offensive power, as a single Shell Smash lets you outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. However, Cloyster is in the same speed tier as Breloom, so Jolly is a consideration if you want to minimize Speed tie scenarios in that matchup.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: As a Focus Sash user, Cloyster wants to avoid using Tera when possible, but opposing priority attacks and defensive typings can sometimes make it a necessity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Since Cloyster will often be at extremely low health after Shell Smash, Tera Ghost helps it avoid getting revenge killed by Breloom's Mach Punch and Dragonite’s Extreme Speed. It also provides coverage against Gholdengo with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: The increased damage from Tera Ice makes it very difficult for Pokemon to wall Cloyster without resisting it, with even Corviknight getting OHKOed by +2 Adamant Icicle Spear after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Volt Switch users like Rotom-W love to take Cloyster down to its Sash and pivot to a priority attacker; Tera Ground both immunes the damage and prevents the switch, giving Cloyster significant momentum with a free turn to Shell Smash. It also lets Cloyster challenge defensive Gholdengo, blocking Thunder Wave and giving +2 Adamant Drill Run a strong chance to OHKO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: While Tera Fire Tera Blast actually does less damage to Corviknight than Tera Ice Icicle Spear, Tera Fire otherwise helps Cloyster muscle past Steel-types it traditionally struggles to beat, such as Scizor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal is a niche option that offers no offensive benefits to Cloyster, but it does prevent Mimikyu and Gallade from revenge killing it with Shadow Sneak.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Considering Cloyster's paper thin Special Defense, Focus Sash gives Cloyster by far the most set up opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>King's Rock</strong>: King's Rock is a risky option that doesn’t help Cloyster set up, but it does give Icicle Spear and Rock Blast a 41% chance of flinching.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, care should be taken on the timing of Terastallization depending on the matchup, as Dragonite more effectively checks several prominent threats, such as Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W, with its base typing.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Fire Punch</strong>: Fire Punch gets around Dragonite's issue with Tera Steel Levitate Pokemon such as Latias, but its pretty weak otherwise.</li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Stealth Rock is commonly set up specifically to break Dragonite's Multiscale, so Heavy-Duty Boots are a good way to always preserve Dragonite's ability to set up and revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet lets Dragonite play more passively against physical threats, which is especially relevant before it Terastallizes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: The residual recovery of Leftovers makes it easier to maintain Multiscale when using Roost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry gives Dragonite a good safety net against common Yawn + Stealth Rock users such as Hippowdon and Swampert, especially when Encore is there to punish Stealth Rock.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish</strong> Going fully defensive means Dragonite won't sweep nearly as easily, but Dragonite is still capable of being an effective defensive Pokemon even after Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 Def / 100 Spe with Impish or 156 HP / 252 Atk / 100 Spe with Adamant</strong>: These EV spreads outspeeds Jolly Ursaluna, who while not common, can seriously threaten to break past Dragonite with Guts boosted Facade.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>52 HP / 252 Atk / 204 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This EV spread is the minimum amount of Speed needed to outspeed Flutter Mane after Dragon Dance, the two Pokemon immune to Extreme Speed. Outspeeding Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao can also be useful since both are known to sometimes use Tera Ghost for Extreme Speed. 236 Speed EVs can be run as well if the rare Dragapult is a serious issue.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Paraflinch Dragonite is a defensively oriented Dragonite set that takes full advantage of Terastallization and the element of surprise to cripple and downright defeat numerous Pokemon. Multiscale allows Dragonite to paralyze its foes relatively safely, becoming a massive nuisance for unprepared opponents.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Slash vs. Iron Head</strong>: Air Slash is a more practical move for this set, as it can cover a wider range of Pokemon for at least neutral damage. Air Slash also does not trigger Rocky Helmet and is naturally boosted by Dragonite's STAB. The Iron Head variant of Paraflinch, however, gives Dragonite an easier time against a number of common threats such as Flutter Mane, at the cost of struggling against Gouging Fire before they Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore vs. Substitute</strong>: Encore will allow Dragonite to effectively check a wider variety of Pokemon such as Ursaluna-B by locking them into an unfavorable move, giving it a free opportunity to land Thunder Wave on your opponent's switch-in on the following turn. Substitute, on the other hand, will give Dragonite a much easier time dealing with defensive Pokemon that rely on status infliction such as Porygon2 and Dragon Tail Archaludon.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Waterfall</strong>: Waterfall can be a viable option. However, the move is less reliable for the application of this set, as its chance to flinch is 20% as opposed to Air Slash and Iron Head's 30%. It does deal more damage to common Electric-types like Thundurus-T though.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel is a great defensive type that provides resistance to Fairy-type attacks, such as Moon Blast from Flutter Mane. If using the physical set, Tera Steel also provides a significant boost to the damage of Iron Head.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is Dragonite's best option against opposing Dragon-types, such as Roaring Moon and Gouging Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water provides Dragonite with the much-needed defensive versatility to paralyze and wall common threats, such as Chien-Pao and Azumarill. Water is an excellent defensive type in general with its only weaknesses being Electric and Grass.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV and IV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 236 Def / 28 Spe</strong>: 52 Speed EVs are the minimum Speed requirement to outspeed paralyzed Iron Bundle that lack Booster Energy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 140 Def / 116 Spe</strong>: This is the minimum requirement to outspeed paralyzed Modest Choice Scarf Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>0 Attack IVs</strong>: If using Air Slash, 0 Attack IVs are highly recommended for having a high chance of retaining Substitute against STAB Foul Play users such as Porygon2</p> </li> </ul>"

If using Tera Flying with Tera Blast as the only attack, this set will need Terastallization to function.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: With Tera Blast, Tera Flying gives Dragonite a solid mono-attacking option and defensive typing in one, at the cost of almost always needing to Terastallize to function.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy gives Dragonite an excellent mono-attacking Tera Blast that gives it an advantage over other Dragon-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel covers Dragonite's former weaknesses very well, and can still work somewhat well even if not Terastallized thanks to Iron Head, though note it makes this Dragonite much more vulnerable to Urshifu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gifts Dragonite a resistance to Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash without being weak to Sacred Sword, plus it pairs well with Waterfall.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Though this requires extra coverage to be viable, Tera Electric gives Dragonite only a single weakness to Ground-type attacks, and has excellent coverage with Ice Spinner.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet lets Dragonite play more passively thanks to the chip damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Preserving Multiscale even when Stealth Rock is set up can help Dragonite survive attacks in emergencies.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's passive healing gives Dragonite a better matchup against passive foes it can Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: With Covert Cloak, Dragonite becomes a very solid check to Garganacl, as well as no longer fearing Breaking Swipe or flinches.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Weakness Policy</strong>: Since Multiscale makes Dragonite very difficult to OHKO, Weakness Policy is a viable option to turn the tables on foes targeting Dragonite's weaknesses.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads And Dragon Dance Speed Tiers</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 188 Defense / 76 Spe with Impish</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds up to Urshifu after one Dragon Dance, and Iron Bundle after two Dragon Dances.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 148 Defense / 108 Speed with Impish</strong>: This spread outspeeds Garchomp and Chi-Yu after Dragon Dance, all of which are threats that can easily revenge kill Dragonite once Multiscale is broken.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 52 Def / 204 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This is the minimum Speed needed to outspeed Timid Iron Bundle after a boost, and it also outspeeds Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Phazer": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Multiscale's incredible bulk potential and Dragon Tail bypassing Taunt, Dragonite is a unique and very effective phazer that massively ups the danger of entry hazards!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Tail VS. Roar</strong>: Dragon Tail is preferred for it disregarding Taunt and providing some good chip damage. However, Roar can phaze out meddlesome Fairy-types and users of Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Teammates</strong>: For this Dragonite to be at its most effective, you'll need some partners to at least set up Stealth Rock. Ting-Lu and Archaludon are particularly bulky examples that pair well, but other options include Landorus-T, Swampert, and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake VS. Iron Head</strong>: Earthquake is the most wide-reaching coverage move, ensuring good damage against Normal resistances like Garganacl and Archaludon. If using Roar, Iron Head prevents Levitate Pokemon from completely walling Dragonite, and its flinch rate synergies well with Thunder Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Dragonite's bulk makes it an ace at spreading paralysis, making it more of a team supporter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute versus Encore</strong>: Substitute is a fantastic option against Pokemon with status moves that threaten Dragonite's phazing cycles, such as Garganacl, Porygon2, and Toxapex. Encore won't do as well against these threats but does punish opposing foes carrying Substitute that can be a problem for Dragon Tail along with slower foes that use status moves in general such as Ting-Lu and Ursaluna-B. Encore can even be used over extra coverage if teammates can deal with Fairy-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Extreme Speed versus Aqua Jet</strong>: Extreme Speed's ability to pick off threats is useful, even on defensive variants of this set. Despite being half as powerful, Aqua Jet is still worth considering for its ability to pick off weakened Flutter Mane, which can be difficult for this set to handle due to its power when Multiscale isn't in play.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Dragonite's defensive typing can be quite helpful against foes like Urshifu-R and Chi-Yu, but some of the huge exploitable weakness to Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane will require Terastallization to cover.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dragon immunity gels well with Dragonite and is a great defensive typing in general against foes like Chien-Pao and Urshifu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is not only an incredible defensive typing that covers much of Dragonite's former weaknesses, but the power boost it provides to Iron Head lets it OHKO all but the most bulky Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water's Ice and Fire resistance makes it a great pick against Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Heatran and is among the best defensive types in general. The boost to Aqua Jet can also be helpful for picking off threats, though it won't be as powerful as Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal isn't that incredible defensively, but it can be worth it for boosting Extreme Speed's power, letting offensive EV spreads 2HKO Chien-Pao with it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a niche option that lets Dragonite absorb Toxic Spikes and gain a Toxic immunity without being weak to Fighting- and Fire-type attacks like Tera Steel is.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is a high value item, but it's worth using on Dragonite if using Substitute, as it gives Dragonite a serious chance of passively gaining Multiscale's effect back.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet allows Dragonite to play more passively, punishing Pokemon that rely on contact moves like Choice Item Urshifu-R and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots' Stealth Rock immunity makes Multiscale more flexible, especially if Dragon Tail brings in a threat Dragonite isn't equipped to handle.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 Def / 180 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread gives up quite a bit of bulk in exchange for outspeeding Adamant Breloom, while still often mantaining a Substitute against Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 124 Atk / 108 Def / 4 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is optimized for use with Earthquake and Aqua Jet, allowing Dragonite to 2HKO 4 Defense Flutter Mane with that combination of moves without needing to Terastallize. Only Modest Tera Fairy Flutter Mane will have a chance to OHKO through Multiscale.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is a far more offensive approach, mainly for use with Extreme Speed to pick off threats more effectively.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Due to Dragonite's offensive presence and high bulk, many opponents choose to either check it defensively or set up against it to break through Roost + Multiscale. Against either option, Encore can turn Dragonite practically invincible allowing it to reside on the field indefinitely in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire Spin</strong>: This allows Dragonite to defeat almost any Pokemon universally by simply making full use of its longevity. Trapping an Encore locked Pokemon in the field is also highly valuable. Fire Spin is used instead of Wrap because it affects Ghost-types and doesn't trigger chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Iron Head</strong>: Earthquake prevents Dragonite from being entirely passive against Archaludon, Gouging Fire, and Flutter Mane. Meanwhile, Iron Head fits using Tera Steel, and does massive damage to Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draco Meteor</strong>: With a Bold Nature, Draco Meteor is a powerful move that can catch opposing Dragon-types off-guard and deal big damage to Ursaluna-B and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Dragonite's typing does have some fairly exploitable weaknesses that can harm its defensive capability, but an immunity to Toxic Spikes and useful resistances to common attack types such as Ground, Fire, and Fighting mean that Terastallization is not always the right play.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Due to Dragonite’'s low Speed compared to other Dragon-types, Tera Fairy is a great response against them. This also retains its advantage against Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel massively improves Dragonite's matchups against Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, at the cost of being even more vulnerable to Salt Cure and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water adds a resistance to Ice without losing Dragonite's innate Fire-type resistance, which is helpful against Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: The niche Tera Poison gives Dragonite a way to remove its common weaknesses without being vulnerable to Toxic Spikes, while still resisting Fighting unlike Tera Steel.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Heavy-Duty Boots</strong> Generally, Leftovers preserves Dragonite’'s longevity best, as it cancels out the damage from Sandstorm and makes timer stall easier. However, the increased usage of entry hazard setters in response to Dragonite makes Heavy-Duty Boots a strong option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet makes it easier for Dragonite to defeat Pokemon such as opposing Dragonite, Urshifu-R, and Gouging Fire (while Dragonite is Terastallized), and its residual damage can be used to execute a win condition.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: With Covert Cloak, this Dragonite becomes a very effective check to Garganacl, in addition to no longer being vulnerable to flinches from Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash while Terastallizing.</p> </li> </ul>"

This can also work against Chien-Pao, but Icicle Crash's flinch chance makes this rather risky.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Low Kick</strong>: Earthquake is the preferred coverage move for dealing big damage against Archaludon and Gholdengo, common responses to a Dragonite locked into Tera Blast. Low Kick trades smacking Gholdengo for revenge killing opposing Tera Normal Dragonite and dealing massive damage to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is the best nature for needing less chip damage to revenge kill weakened targets with priority attacks, but Jolly can make sense if outspeeding foes like Modest Gholdengo, Adamant Gouging Fire, and the rare Jolly Breloom is appealing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Almost Required</strong>: This set is highly reliant on using Tera Blast as a luring tool, so Terastallization should be a top priority for Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sharp Beak</strong>: Sharp Beak gives Dragonite the most offensive presence with the fewest drawbacks, giving Flying-type Tera Blast just enough of a boost to usually 2HKO Ursaluna-B, or 3HKO defensive variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Assault Vest vastly improves Dragonite's matchup against Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane, especially if Multiscale's protection has been lost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots means Stealth Rock will no longer remove this set's ability to trade blows with powerful threats.</p> </li> </ul>"

If the opponent's Pokemon is unable to attack on the turn Umbreon uses Wish, Umbreon can easily pass the Wish to a teammate.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Umbreon can Taunt opposing walls and deny their recovery, with foes such as Hippowdon and Corviknight being especially vulnerable.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Despite its incredible bulk, Umbreon's Fighting- and Fairy-type weaknesses are exploitable by several top threats and often needs to be removed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: In a heavily Dragon-centric metagame, Tera Fairy on defensive Pokemon is highly valuable. Removing Umbreon's Fighting- and Fairy-type weakness also helps deal with Sacred Sword Chien-Pao and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison resists Fighting, Bug, and Fairy and provides an immunity to Toxic, but makes it more vulnerable to Earthquake from the likes of Dragonite and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Combined with Protect, Leftovers keeps Umbreon healthy and a little less reliant on Wish.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet's chip damage is serviceable, but many top physical threats have suitable non-contact moves they can use on Umbreon, especially after Umbreon Terastallizes.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Inner Focus</strong>: Inner Focus avoids flinches from Chien-Pao and Kingambit, making Umbreon a more reliable check.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Synchronize</strong>: Synchronize punishes attempts to burn Umbreon.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with Bold</strong>: With Terastallization, this spread allows Umbreon to tank a majority of the physical metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>172 HP / 252 Def / 60 SpD / 20 Spe with Bold</strong>: If running Taunt, 20 Speed EVs outpace Skeledirge and Corviknight while retaining all-around bulk.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thanks to its high Attack, great defensive typing and solid bulk, Scizor is an effective bulky pivot that can also punish faster foes with Technician-boosted Bullet Punch, such as Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao, and Latios.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Knock Off versus Thief</strong>: Beyond being a fantastic support move, Knock Off is a great option against Gholdengo. Thief does offer more consistent damage than Knock Off though, thanks to Technician.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dual Wingbeat</strong>: Dual Wingbeat is Scizor's best option against Ogerpon-H as well Fighting-types like Annihilape and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: Close Combat is Scizor's best option to hit opposing Ursaluna-B and Chi-Yu as well as Steel types, even when using defensive EV spreads.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Scarf is a shocking twist against Ogerpon-H and Urshifu formes to launch off a strong Dual Wingbeat, but this does mean Scizor's bulk is heavily compromised against the threats it usually checks, like Flutter Mane.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization can be quite helpful in either cleaning teams or preparing against Scizor's classic Fire-type issues, the power of its priority and pivoting don't make it needed for it to function consistently.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water turns its Fire weakness into a resistance, giving Scizor a fighting chance against dangerous Fire-types such as Chi-Yu, Gouging Fire, and Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is ideal for more offensive Scizor variants, making Bullet Punch an even better cleaning tool. Tera Steel also softens Scizor's weakness to Fire, letting it avoid the OHKO from attacks like Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire is a great response most Ogerpon-H sets, and shields Scizor from burns that foes like Entei like to deal out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Increasing Dual Wingbeat's power with Terastallization nets Scizor some useful new OHKOs against offensive Urshifu formes and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: While not an incredible defensive typing, Tera Dragon is fantastic against most Fire and Water Pokemon that give Scizor trouble, with Ogerpon formes being a particularly prominent example. As a downside though, it harms Scizor's ability to check Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: While much less immediately threatening than Choice Band, Assault Vest lets Scizor more comfortably switch into stray special attacks like Gholdengo's and Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball or Rotom-W's Volt Switch, improving its longevity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band</strong>: Choice Band lets Scizor function as a scary late-game cleaner, especially with Tera Steel-boosted Bullet Punch. The high damage output also helps Scizor to break down walls for its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet is perfect for more defensive Scizor, letting it continually switch into weaker physical attacks and wear down the team with U-turn and residual damage.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 92 Atk / 164 SpD with Adamant</strong>: This spread is meant to be used with Assault Vest, letting Scizor almost always avoid a 2HKO from Modest Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball. It also maintains enough Attack investment to always OHKO uninvested Chien-Pao after Stealth Rock chip.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 68 Atk / 204 Def with Adamant</strong>: This spread avoids an OHKO from Tera Dark Life Orb Chien-Pao, is not 2HKOed by Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast, and reduces the amount of residual damage Scizor receives thanks to the HP stat being 1 lower than divisible by 16.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 68 Atk / 204 Def with Adamant</strong>: This bulky spread lets Scizor survive +2 Life Orb Adamant Tera Ghost Mimikyu's Shadow Claw.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: Defensive Scizor might seem strange, but when paired with Rocky Helmet, it becomes an effective pivot that can survive extreme attacks: it avoids the OHKO from Choice Band Tera Dark Chien-Pao's Crunch as well as the 2HKO from Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake. Just note that this will make Scizor focus more on pivoting than revenge killing with Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brave or Relaxed with a Speed IV of 8 or 9</strong>: This Speed IV can be used to use U-turn after some Hippowdon use Yawn, but still outspeed Ting-Lu. Note that being slower than Ursaluna-B can be troublesome.</p> </li> </ul>"

If using U-turn, Scizor can focus on pivoting in some matches, making Terastallization even less needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water lets Scizor ambush Chi-Yu, Iron Bundle, and Incineroar with a resistance and is especially handy against Fire-types when using Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Boosting Bullet Punch is Scizor's best ticket for revenge killing and late-game sweeping, and it gains a Flying-type resistance into powerful Tera Flying Choice Band users like Dragonite and Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire ensures that Siczor's hard work won't get ruined by Will-O-Wisp or Sacred Fire, in addition to stopping revenge kills from common Fire-types like Ogerpon-H, Gouging Fire, and Incineroar.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark can cushion Shadow Ball from Gholdengo and Flutter Mane, giving it an extra turn to set up or hit back with Tera-boosted Knock Off.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric is Scizor's best shot of breaking past Toxapex and Urshifu-R with Tera Blast, and it does good chip damage to Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs</strong>: Sitrus Berry trades late-game sweeping power for new setup opportunities, such as avoiding a 2HKO from Modest Gholdengo that lack Choice Specs. Make sure to run 244 Speed EVs to gain an even HP number, letting Sitrus activate after getting hit by Ruination once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: While Life Orb does compromise Scizor's bulk, it's worth it for being able to OHKO Iron Bundle with a boosted Bullet Punch. Boosted Close Combat will also OHKO even physically defensive Ursaluna-B, and it has good shot of OHKOing physically defensive Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Best used with U-turn, Rocky Helmet transforms this Scizor into a good bulky pivot that has the surprising option to sweep late-game.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 228 Atk / 20 Def / 20 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This spread gives Scizor enough bulk to survive Tera Dark Life Orb Chien-Pao's Crunch, and less residual damage if using U-turn. It also avoids a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast. With Sitrus Berry, Modest Gholdengo's Shadow Ball is also no longer a 2HKO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 124 Atk / 156 SpD with Adamant</strong>: This Sitrus Berry optimized spread avoids a 2HKO from Jolly Chien-Pao's Crunch, Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, and Modest Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 28 Atk / 204 Def / 20 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This bulky spread avoids the OHKO from Adamant Tera Ghost Life Orb Mimikyu's +2 Shadow Claw. When used with Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs, it also avoids the 2HKO from Modest Gholdengo's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: This defensive spread is best used with U-turn and Rocky Helmet, making Scizor function more like a bulky pivot that can sweep late-game.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>The old reliable special wall is still viable, but it now takes a more active role through the use of Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: Ghost-types like Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Swords Dance Mimikyu are still common options used against Blissey. This makes Shadow Ball a consistently strong option, particularly after a couple of Calm Mind boosts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast is a very flexible attacking option, giving reliable STAB before Terastallizing and providing new offensive coverage thereafter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fling with Flame Orb</strong>: This is a surprising option to burn common Blissey switch-ins like Great Tusk, though failing to use it right away will force switching out to get rid of the burn. Fling also gets rid of Choice items from Trick users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock remains a trusty support move for Blissey, punishing teams that are forced to switch around Blissey and its teammates.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Fling with Toxic Orb</strong>: This is as close as it gets to Blissey regaining Toxic, though getting badly poisoned is devestating if Blissey is the last Pokemon around, making it a risky option.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Blissey is known for shrugging off big special hits with ease. However, its presence at team preview often attracts hard counters, and Tera is one way of dealing with that.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Dark Tera ruins Espathra's attempts to break through Blissey with Stored Power, at least forcing a Calm Mind war instead of a total loss. Blocking the occasional Psyshock from foes like Nasty Plot Gholdengo is also a plus.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: The Fighting-type immunity comes in handy for Blissey and prevents it from being trapped, though it does become more vulnerable to Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire puts the brakes on Choice Specs Tera Fire Chi-Yu’s wallbreaking parade, ruining its ability to reliably 2HKO Blissey.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: With the Flying Tera type, Blissey gains a handy resistance to Fighting and no longer has to worry about Fissure from Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: As is the case with most walls, Leftovers’ passive recovery is a great supplement to Softboiled and helps Blissey be less passive itself.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak lets Blissey set up against Garganacls that lack Body Press. It also blocks flinches from Chi-Yu’s Dark Pulse as well as the Special Defense drop from Espathra’s Lumina Crash.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD with Calm or Bold</strong>: Beyond making Tera Blissey that much harder to break by foes like Espathra and Chi-Yu, going all-in on Special Defense means less frequent Softboiled uses against special attackers, especially with Leftovers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spd with Bold</strong>: Maximizing both HP and Defense gives Blissey a little extra boost in physical bulk.</p> </li> </ul>"

Psyshock is the best option into Flutter Mane, Iron Moth, and Clodsire, while Psychic puts more pressure on Toxapex and many variants of Bulk Up Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Pinch Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry is normally the preferred recovery item for bulky Gardevoir sets, but it is a highly sought-after item. If needed elsewhere, Gardevoir's bulk profile is strong enough that running a pinch Berry can work.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Using Tera usually improves common matchups like Flutter Mane and is certainly an option if a target is deemed high enough priority. Otherwise, Gardevor's impressive suite of defensive attributes combined with excellent STAB coverage are great as is.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire’s resistances to Ice, Steel, and Fairy are all excellent, greatly improving the matchups against Flutter Mane, Scizor, and Kingambit. Tera boosted Mystical Fire will also 2HKO maximum HP Kingambit without Assault Vest.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy can patch up this set's lacking power by boosting Moonblast, and the removal of Gardevoir's Psychic typing makes dealing with opposing Ghost-types like Flutter Mane and Mimikyu more manageable.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal's defensive attributes are lacking overall, but nullifying a key Ghost-type attack from the likes of Flutter Mane and Mimikyu can give an opening to deal extra damage or inflict a crucial burn.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p>The spreads listed below all have an even HP stat to guarantee that Sitrus Berry activates after getting hit by Ruination. All spreads are also capable of surviving one unboosted Shadow Ball from Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 244 Def / 20 Spe</strong>: Near maximum HP and Defense gives Gardevoir fantastic defensive calcs; after Sitrus Berry recovery and inflicting a turn 1 burn, Gardevoir has a strong chance of avoiding the 3HKO from Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash and Assault Vest Ting-Lu's Heavy Slam. The Speed investment outspeeds maximum Speed Adamant Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 204 Def / 60 Spe</strong>: A little extra Speed investment lets Gardevoir outspeed defensive Gholdengo with 20 Speed EVs, but Gardevoir is much less likely to avoid the 3HKOs mentioned in the main spread.</p> </li> </ul>"

Loaded Dice Breloom, however, does like Terastallization covering up its iffy defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: With Tera Blast, Tera Fire provides an alternative way to get past Gholdengo, avoids getting burned by other foes, and gives bulkier Breloom a chance against Flutter Mane and Focus Sash Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is a good choice for picking off foes more easily with Mach Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Bullet Seed's boost from Tera Grass means it will OHKO Chien-Pao through its Focus Sash if Breloom rolls at least three hits.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock</strong>: Besides boosting Rock Tomb's damage output, Tera Rock prevents Sandstorm from breaking Breloom's Focus Sash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground-boosted Bulldoze has a 93.8% chance to OHKO 4 HP Gholdengo, making Breloom a situational lure. It also severely punishes Rotom-W that attempt to Volt Switch out, and Hippowdon that don't Terastallize.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Since Breloom's bulk isn't very good, Focus Sash is the most reliable way to fire off Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Loaded Dice</strong>: Guaranteeing 4 hits from Bullet Seed can be quite useful for bulkier Breloom sets, clinching an OHKO on Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao, and Iron Bundle regardless of them running Substitute or Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe</strong>: If using Focus Sash, maximizing Speed is important to deal with slower foes that might invest in Speed, such as Corviknight and Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 180 Atk / 76 SpD</strong>: This bulkier spread makes sense if using Loaded Dice and Swords Dance, letting Breloom survive one hit from Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, or Choice Specs Flutter Mane with the correct Tera type.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, do note that this set is very susceptible to Taunt and Encore, which can make it difficult to even select Breloom in the team preview phase.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect gives Breloom an opportunity to scout out its opponents and further stall them out once Leech Seed has been set up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Timer Stalling</strong>: If you obtain a numerical advantage early in the match, you can utilize Breloom to win on timer. This is particularly effective since the Leech Seed damage happens after recovery from Leftovers and Poison Heal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze</strong>: Bulldoze allows Breloom to further support its teammates and threaten Gholdengo, which likes to absorb status moves. Do be wary that many Gholdengo are Tera Flying, which can render Breloom ineffective versus it.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic can be difficult to fit into the set, but it allows Breloom to punish Tera Grass foes that attempt to circumvent Breloom's Spore and Leech Seed.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: While Breloom's typing does have some useful resistances, its low bulk means more favorable resistances granted by Terastallization can be key to setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: This defensive Tera type allows Breloom to resist Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear and Skeledirge's Torch Song, both of which are threats to Substitute. It also helps against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, though note that Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Tera Fire Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: This Tera type allows Breloom to resist Ice- and Fire-type attacks while also providing Breloom with a Fairy-type resistance. With Toxic, Breloom is able to fight back against common Grass-type switch-ins. However, this type has more weaknesses when compared to Water.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread allows for maximum physical bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>156 HP / 100 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread allows for maximum Speed and can survive a Choice Band Extreme Speed from Tera Normal Dragonite after Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>204 HP / 164 Def / 140 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread hits a Speed stat of 108 which ties 4 Spe Adamant Baxcalibur. Furthermore, the defensive investment means that after Terastallization, Breloom's Substitute has a high chance of surviving three hits from Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear.</p> </li> </ul>"

Along with its decent bulk, Thick Fat gives it key resistances to Fire- and Ice-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bullet Punch</strong>: Bullet Punch provides Hariyama with a non-situational priority move that can grab KOs on weakened targets, and, when boosted by Tera Steel, turn the tides against Fairy-type opponents such as Flutter Mane and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fake Out versus Knock Off</strong>: Fake Out gives Hariyama another source of priority, and it can even be used to scout for Covert Cloak users if the opponent doesn't get flinched by it. Knock Off cripples switch-ins by removing their items; however, it can't remove a Booster Energy from an opponent with the Protosynthesis or Quark Drive in Sun or Electric Terrain, respectively, as it's consumed before Hariyama gets to move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Drain Punch</strong>: Close Combat is the stronger move but at the cost of cutting into Hariyama's bulk with each use. Drain Punch can fail to get a 2HKO on specially defensive Ting-Lu more than 90% of the time, but it provides Hariyama with some recovery, bolstering its bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Headlong Rush</strong>: Headlong Rush drops Hariyama's defenses with each use, but it 2HKOes defensive Toxapex and Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch gives Hariyama a strong option to hit Dragonite with and can catch it by surprise, considering it isn't pressured to Terastallize against Hariyama's other moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam</strong>: Heavy Slam, coupled with Tera Steel, provides Hariyama with a strong move against lightweight foes such as Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, Mimikyu, and Terastallized Iron Moth and Volcarona that doesn't drop its defenses.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Hariyama can work without Terastallization, it can provide an extra kick to its coverage or improve its defensive presence against certain threats.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel Tera gives Hariyama STAB on Bullet Punch, a resistance to Fairy, Psychic, and Steel, and an immunity to Poison, greatly improving its matchup against Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, Psychic Chi-Yu, Gholdengo, and Tera Fairy Iron Moth and Volcarona. Thanks to Thick Fat, it can take on non-Choice Specs variants of Chi-Yu even after Terastallizing if it's kept healthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Besides the burn immunity, Tera Fire capitalizes on Hariyama's Thick Fat, discouraging threats like Tera Fire Chi-Yu and Choice Band Chien-Pao from using their most powerful moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: While Tera Fighting doesn't provide anything defensively for Hariyama, it makes Close Combat a force to be reckoned with.</p> </li> </ul>"

Drain Punch is weaker, but the recovery can help offset the burn damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Headlong Rush</strong>: Earthquake complements Hariyama's coverage nicely, hitting Poison-types that resist Close Combat. Headlong Rush is stronger, but comes with the drawbacks of lowering defenses and being a contact move, triggering Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch is Hariyama's best hope of hitting Dragonite, as it doesn't fear much from Hariyama's other moves.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Terastallization gives a much appreciated boost to Bullet Punch, but it isn't necessary on every match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Terastallizing into the Steel-type turns Hariyama's Fairy and Psychic weaknesses into resistances along with giving STAB to Bullet Punch.</p> </li> </ul>"

Still, thanks to Levitate, Latios has some effective defensive options to consider.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel has superb synergy with Levitate, making Latios an effective offensive check against common foes like Landorus-T and Dragonite while giving Latios great counterplay against Fairy-types like Flutter Mane defensively and offensively with Tera Blast. This also lets Latios tank a Blood Moon from Ursaluna-B, though the Vacuum Wave weakness can be bothersome afterwards.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire also gives Latios a vital resistance to Fairy-types while maintaining the resistances against Ogerpon-H's STAB moves and providing a powerful Tera Blast against most Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water covers Latios's issue with Ice-type attacks, which can save it in a pinch against Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle, while still retaining an important resistance to Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric removes all of Latios's weaknesses except from Mold Breaker users with Earthquake like Excadrill and provides a useful paralysis immunity against common status spreaders like Porygon2, Flutter Mane, and Serperior.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a decent alternative to Tera Steel, giving Latios a good option against Dragon-types while still retaining a Fighting-type resistance.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs VS. Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Specs is preferred on Latios for the excellent wallbreaking potential. Choice Scarf Latios is a reasonable revenge killer, but it still doesn't deal well with Chien-Pao due to the Sucker Punch weakness, making it more reliant on unique qualities like Trick and Levitate to separate itself from other Choice Scarf revenge killers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Soul Dew</strong>: While not as effective at breaking walls as Choice Specs, Soul Dew is a reasonable alternative to still take advantage of Luster Purge's Special Defense drops, and it is a great way of getting around Item Clause issues if Latios still needs a power boost.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Neutral Nature</strong>: It's best to use a neutral nature with a Timid Mint to ensure that Latios can eat any berry without getting confused after using Trick.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Empoleon's fantastic typing and good movepool make it a great choice for a specially defensive Stealth Rock setter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Yawn versus Roar</strong>: Yawn has fantastic synergy with Stealth Rock, forcing foes to either take damage or be put to Sleep. Roar is more reliant on Stealth Rock being set up first, but it isn't as vulnerable to common Substitute foes like Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flash Cannon versus Ice Beam</strong>: Flash Cannon is the preferred STAB move for dealing good damage to Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle. Ice Beam is still worth considering for dealing far more damage to Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn versus Surf</strong>: Flip Turn makes Empoleon a good pivot despite its low damage output, though Surf is still a reasonable alternative for doing good damage against Ground-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roost</strong>: Despite Empoleon's good defensive profile, Roost can be hard to fit in since it means either giving up support or coverage. Still, it does make Empoleon a better check with Flutter Mane when paired with Flash Cannon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calm versus Sassy</strong>: In addition to making Flip Turn stronger, Sassy's lower Speed can help Empoleon pivot out last. However, Sassy forces a Speed tie with 4 Speed EV Ursaluna-B unless 20 Speed EVs are used. If the power drop isn't an issue, a Calm nature with a Speed IV of 17 can be used to reach the same Speed.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Empoleon's superb typing means Terastallization should only be used to flip certain troublesome match-ups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying floats above common Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Ursaluna-B, and it additionally grants an important Fighting-type resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a good response against Fighting-types like Urshifu while making Electric-types such as Zapdos and Vikavolt less problematic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: In addition to a Ground-type resistance (though this can be risky against Landorus-T), Tera Grass saves Empoleon from Breloom's Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Bug isn't normally a great defensive type, but the resistances to Fighting and Ground, combined with not being weak to Electric, makes it a viable choice on Empoleon.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is the most reliable healing item, especially when getting free turns with Yawn.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry's quick burst of recovery is a decent alternative to Leftovers. Make sure to use 244 HP EVs with it so it activates after getting hit by Ting-Lu's Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: Empoleon is an especially effective user of Air Balloon with its offensive advantages against Ground-types, doing especially well against Gliscor thanks to Empoleon's Toxic immunity.</p> </li> </ul>"

Grass Knot's coverage is less impressive, but it prevents Empoleon from being totally walled by bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Milotic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn</strong>: Flip Turn will require giving up coverage or priority, but Empoleon is a bulky enough pivot to justify it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vacuum Wave</strong>: While not being a strong priority move, Vacuum Wave is great for picking off weakened threats, especially Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Competitive versus Torrent</strong>: Competitive is the most reliable option for checking Flutter Mane, punishing Charm variants and ensuring that Special Attack drops from Moonblast turn into an advantage. Torrent can make some sense with Tera Water though, making Surf very difficult to switch into.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Empoleon relies on its excellent typing to be a great Assault Vest tank, but its lack of recovery means Terastallazation can still be important for flipping certain match-ups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water vastly improves Empoleon's match-up against common Ground-types like Ursaluna-B and Landorus-T, removing the Earthquake / Earth Power weakness and having a powerful Surf.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a great response against Fighting-types like Urshifu and also lets Empoleon tank Electric-types like Zapdos and Vikavolt more reliably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying's Ground-type immunity is perfect for saving it from sweepers like Garchomp and Landorus-T, and it additionally removes grievances with Dondozo's Fissure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass protects Empoleon from Breloom's Spore and makes Grass Knot more desirable.</p> </li> </ul>"

If using Focus Sash, Terastallization becomes far less needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: A Steel Tera type has excellent synergy with Garchomp's typing, letting it more effectively tackle faster Dragon-types, Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, Mimikyu, and Normal-type priority from Dragonite, Entei, and Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: While the Stealth Rock weakness is unfortunate against bulkier teams, a Fire Tera type still gives out a vital Fairy and Ice resistance, and gives a powerful Tera Blast against levitating Tera Steel Pokemon like Latias.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Fairy is an even stronger option against Dragon-types, and gives Garchomp a better matchup against Urshifu-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water not only gives that sweet Ice resistance to Garchomp, but it makes Choice Scarf Urshifu-R regret ever using Surging Strikes thanks to Rough Skin!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Loaded Dice</strong>: Loaded Dice keeps Scale Shot at its most reliable damage output, making it the ideal tool for sweeping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Surviving shocking attacks with Focus Sash gives Garchomp new sweeping and revenge killing potential, and makes it a reliable setter of Stealth Rock if needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: If used with Tera Steel and Iron Head, Life Orb's damage boost can potentially push Garchomp past the dreaded Charm Flutter Mane with a 2HKO even after the Attack drop!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry lets Garchomp deal with major Yawn users more easily, such as Swampert and Hippowdon.</p> </li> </ul>"

Even on Choice Scarf sets, Scale Shot is a less risky Dragon-type attack over Outrage, and outspeeding extremely fast threats like Booster Energy Iron Bundle is welcome.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head</strong>: With Tera Steel, Iron Head lets Choice Band Garchomp 2HKO Charm Flutter Mane, who can otherwise edge out a victory with Pain Split and repeated Attack drops.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stone Edge versus Rock Tomb</strong>: Rock Tomb is fairly weak, but the speed control can be very useful on Choice Scarf variants if sacrificing Garchomp. Stone Edge deals massive damage to common Tera Flying Pokemon such as Gholdengo, and it prevents it from being walled by Tera Fairy Levitate Pokemon like Latias.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Fire Fang</strong> While weak, this is Garchomp's best option against Corviknight and Tera Steel Latiias when not Tera Fire.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / Low</strong>: When using the slower Choice Band variants, Terastallization becomes important for avoiding revenge kills.

However, note that some important targets such as Corviknight and Skeledirge are a tad faster than it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Calm</strong>: With maximum Special Defense investment and Assault Vest, Magnezone becomes a good soft check against Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, and one of the best pivots in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 SpA / 180 Spe with Modest</strong>: While this spread sacrifices a large amount of power, in exchange it outspeeds Adamant maximum Speed Kingambit, who can threaten to deal massive damage otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Modest</strong>: If using Sturdy, Magnezone can run maximum Speed to outspeed unexpected foes, such as Specially Defensive Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: The increase in special bulk helps Magnezone against the myriad of Choice item special attacking Dragon-types, like Hydreigon and Dragapult. If using Calm, Magnezone can even take on Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs gives Magnezone a devastating amount of power, with even Clodsire having trouble handling it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: The temporary Ground-type immunity helps Magnezone against foes like Garchomp and Dragonite without Terastallizing.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Analytic</strong>: A Magnezone boosted by both Choice Specs and Analytic is incredibly hard to switch into, making it easier for Magnezone to generate momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: With Sturdy's guaranteed survivability and Magnezone's high damage output, Magnezone will very likely take down at least one Pokemon per game. Sturdy also helps Magnezone play around Dondozo, as it can safely come in on Fissure and use Volt Switch against it, which renders Yawn moot. However, if Magnezone switches into a Yawn and not Fissure, it should be noted that Dondozo often runs Protect to block Volt Switch and ensure Magnezone falls asleep.</p> </li> </ul>"

Feint is used mostly for winning Focus Sash duels against Chien-Pao's Ice Shard and Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Night Slash versus Knock Off</strong>: Night Slash's consistent power is best for pure offense, potentially 2HKOing targets like Bold Gholdengo, assuming they can't stall with Recover and Rocky Helmet. If more utility is desired, Knock Off can be used for removing opposing items.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leaf Blade</strong>: Fully invested Sharpness Leaf Blade has a 75% chance of OHKOing 252 HP Azumarill and is Gallade's best hope of muscling past Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Aqua Cutter</strong>: Aqua Cutter benefits from Sharpness, but it doesn't add a lot of extra coverage.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Gallade uses Focus Sash or Assault Vest as its main tool for cushioning a big hit and has great natural coverage.

Leaf Blade also becomes an easy 2HKO on Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel flips Gallade's weakness to Fairy-type attacks to a resistance. The Ice resistance can also be used in a pinch to keep Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear from OHKOing Gallade through Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: With Focus Sash, Gallade duels opposing Focus Sash users with its hard-hitting STAB attacks and priority moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Gallade has enough Special Defense to make good use of Assault Vest if Focus Sash is already taken, comfortably surviving unboosted hits from targets like Chi-Yu. Furthermore, Assault Vest isn't rendered useless by Stealth Rock chip, making Gallade a safer mid- or late-game option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scope Lens</strong>: While Scope Lens is risky due to Gallade's average bulk and Speed, it pairs well with the increased critical hit ratio many of Gallade's attacks have.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Adamant</strong>: A maximum offense spread is standard for Focus Sash and Speed ties with offensive Adamant Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 HP / 252 Atk / 60 Spe with Adamant</strong>: For sets that run Assault Vest over Focus Sash, this slower spread avoids the OHKO from Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash after Stealth Rock damage.

Night Slash has more offensive presence than Knock Off and is a good choice if you really need to hit Gholdengo with consistent damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leaf Blade</strong>: Leaf Blade is a great coverage option and, if Trick isn't available, your best move against Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Choice Scarf Gallade normally isn't a strong user of Tera.

This way, it can't be confused by any Berries given with Trick.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Discharge</strong>: While weaker than Thunderbolt, the 30% paralysis chance can be devastating for some of Rotom-H's more troublesome matchups, such as Chi-Yu. Do note though that Choice Scarf Rotom-H will have a much harder time 2HKOing Assault Vest Azumarill and certain variants of Dondozo.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: If not running Tera Blast, Rotom-H normally wants to keep its unique typing for defensive purposes, allowing it to switch into several key threats.

Thunder Wave is still a reasonable choice, though, stopping special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Iron Moth in their tracks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick and Flame Orb</strong>: This one-use method of burning may seem silly, but taking away important items can be devastating against certain Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, and Rotom-H can use this to get rid of troublesome Choice items if it's taken a Trick as well. Note that Rotom-H will burn itself if it Terastallizes while holding Flame Orb, which is generally not good outside of blocking sleep or Toxic poison.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using a Neutral Nature with a Bold Mint</strong>: If using Trick, it's best to run a neutral nature such as Serious and change the stat boosts with a Bold Mint. This way, Rotom-H won't get confused by any Berry it receives.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Rotom-H's defensive typing is very valuable, so Tera is normally reserved for very specific situations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel with Levitate is a sublime defensive typing, letting Rotom-H better handle huge threats like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is an alternative option to soak up Dragon-type attacks, and it also gives Rotom-H a better matchup against Great Tusk and Iron Hands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While this unfortunately makes Gholdengo a much bigger issue, Tera Ghost is still worth considering for making Rotom-H immune to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Iron Valiant's Close Combat.

Modest is usable with Choice Specs, allowing Thundurus-T to outspeed up to Jolly Baxcalibur and Great Tusk, and the extra power can be handy in some situations, such as usually 2HKOing specially defensive Clodsire with Tera Blast Flying.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Thundurus-T is perfectly fine with its base typing, it makes such good use of Terastallization that it'll often Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying makes Tera Blast a powerful STAB option with very few resistances while gaining no extra weaknesses thanks to Volt Absorb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Not only does Tera Ice give Thundurus-T powerful coverage against Ground- and Grass-types like Landorus-T and Wo-Chien, it also gives an important resistance to Iron Bundle's and Chien-Pao's Ice-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a fantastic defensive option, turning Thundurus-T into an excellent check against Regieleki and Zapdos while still giving it a good coverage option against Landorus-T. However, it still retains Thundurus-T's weakness to Freeze-Dry.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs versus Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Specs makes Thundurus-T difficult to wall without an extremely sturdy special wall, with even Pokemon like Clodsire and Cresselia at risk of a 2HKO. Choice Scarf, on the other hand, allows Thundurus-T to double as a good revenge killer, outspeeding major threats like Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: While Thundurus-T isn't known for its bulk, Volt Absorb means Assault Vest makes Thundurus-T more effective at checking other Electric-types, especially when using bulkier EV spreads.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Bulkier EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>20 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 228 Spe with Timid</strong>: This Assault Vest spread outspeeds both Urshifu formes and takes 70% maximum from Timid Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry without sacrificing power.</p> </li> <li> <p>188 SpA / 68 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid or Modest**: This spread is optimized for Assault Vest, letting Thundurus-T survive Timid Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry without Terastallizing.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>0-3 Attack IV</strong>: Foes that commonly run Foul Play such as Amoonguss and Rotom-W have more powerful moves to use against Thundurus-T, but there's no drawback to minimizing Foul Play's damage.</li> </ul>"

Sitrus Berry is still a good option, though allowing Thundurus-T to instantly restore some health after being hit by Ruination, as long as its maximum HP is an even number.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: When paired with Tera Water, Substitute lets Thundurus-T set up on Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Blast</strong>: Focus Blast's unreliability makes it hard to recommend for most teams, but it's the only way Thundurus-T will break through Hisuian Goodra without Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Giving up coverage is risky, but Taunt shuts down a lot of defensive counterplay against Thundurus-T such as Whirlwind Ting-Lu and Toxic Clodsire.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Thundurus-T's typing is totally functional for sweeping and wallbreaking, but Terastallization makes it far harder to revenge kill thanks to Volt Absorb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying gives Thundurus-T a powerful STAB option, letting it cleave through specially bulky foes, like Water Absorb Clodsire, particularly easily.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: While Tera Water does leave Thundurus-T vulnerable to certain Pokemon, such as Water Absorb Clodsire and Hisuian Goodra, it's a fantastic defensive Tera type that lets it deal with other common Electric-types that Terastallize like Regieleki and Zapdos.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice is a great offensive option, letting Thundurus-T cleave through most Ground-types that aren't weak to Grass such as Landorus-T and Clodsire.

It also gets around potential users of Throat Chop before Terastallization, such as Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psyshock</strong>: This is Sylveon's best shot of dealing with Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: Shadow Ball hits foes such as Mimikyu, Flutter Mane, and Gholdengo super effectively, and it means Sylveon does not have to Terastallize to hit Gholdengo for good damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Quick Attack</strong>: Though it is weak, Quick Attack gives valuable priority for picking off weakened threats, and thanks to Pixilate, surprise users of Tera Ghost aren't able to absorb it. A Quiet nature can be used to increase its power, though this risks Sylveon getting outsped by Kingambit.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: Psychic deals more damage to physically defensive Toxapex and Amoonguss, but its lower damage output against Iron Moth makes it disappointing if not using Tera Ground.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyper Beam</strong>: Despite the serious risks from the recharge turn, Hyper Beam's extreme power makes it a good filler move.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Assault Vest lets even offensive Sylveon be specially resilient.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: With the boost from Choice Specs, Sylveon is a surprisingly potent wallbreaker, making the most out of its many opportunities to switch in.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA</strong>: This spread capitalizes on Sylveon's good natural bulk while maximizing its power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe</strong>: While no bulk investment makes Sylveon more difficult to safely get in, Speed investment allows it to outrun and threaten a wider range of foes, such as Scizor and Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Sylveon suffers coverage issues on its own, so its heavily reliant on either Tera Blast or the sheer power of Tera Fairy Hyper Voice to break past them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire allows Sylveon to break past troublesome Steel-types, like Gholdengo and Kingambit, and gives it a key resistance to Ice and Fire attacks from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives good coverage against Fire-types like Iron Moth and Skeledirge, in addition to surprising Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu by resisting their strongest STAB attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground doesn't match up quite as well against Steel-types as Tera Fire, but it lets Sylveon turn the tables on Iron Moth, and deal massive damage to Toxapex and Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Getting an extra boost on Hyper Voice and Hyper Beam makes Choice Specs Sylveon far more difficult to wall, with even resists such as Gholdengo and physically defensive Skeledirge getting 2HKOed by Hyper Voice!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Giving Sylveon extra special bulk lets it take on powerful threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle more reliably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs turns Sylveon into a surprising wallbreaker, especially if using Tera Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Throat Spray</strong>: With Hyper Voice activating Throat Spray, Sylveon could potentially break apart slower foes in the late-game, though it only gets one shot at this Special Attack boost. This is best used with Tera Blast to give Sylveon an alternative STAB attack that doesn't activate Throat Spray.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its good bulk and Special Attack and a reasonable healing move in Wish, Sylveon is a good choice for a bulky Fairy-type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyper Voice</strong>: Hyper Voice gives Sylveon a reliable STAB even when Terastallized, and hits through common Substitute users like Iron Bundle and Wo-Chien. While It's possible to drop this attack for Tera Blast in an attempt to run more coverage, this seriously worsens Sylveon's matchup against Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Beyond just Terastallization, Tera Blast is still impacted by Pixilate, making it a good move to use against foes that sometimes carry Throat Chop, like Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect pairs excellently with Leftovers, and makes Wish a more reliable recovery move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Yawn</strong>: Sylveon's good bulk makes it a great choice for phazing with Yawn.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psyshock</strong>: Psyshock is Sylveon's best hope for Iron Moth switch-ins.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: Shadow Ball offers important coverage on Gholdengo without demanding that Sylveon Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Sitrus Berry</strong>: Leftovers is the preferred recovery item for its synergy with Protect and Wish, but Sitrus Berry is a reasonable alternative if Protect isn't wanted, or if another teammate needs Leftovers more.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Sylveon's coverage issues are much easier to deal with when using Terastallization, but this set can still be used well defensively without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: A Fire Tera type grants Sylveon resistances to Steel and Fairy, allowing it to take on foes it would otherwise have to run from, such as Gholdengo, and a good STAB to hit Chien-Pao hard with if not using Hyper Voice. It also works against Scizor, but note that Tera Water is common on that foe. Tera Fire also makes Sylveon far more vulnerable to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a great mono-attacking option, making it ideal if only running Tera Blast to do decently well against Steel-types. It also gives Sylveon a better matchup against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, and is a safer option against Ting-Lu and Tera Water Scizor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: If not using Tera Blast, Fairy becomes a reasonable option for boosting Hyper Voice's damage output. Note that Tera Blast is not needed to justify a different Tera Type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground worsens Sylveon's matchup with Chien-Pao, but it does let it deal big damage to Iron Moth, Gholdengo, and Toxapex.</p> </li> </ul>"

While Heavy Slam isn't very useful against heavy targets, it's worth using for OHKOing offensive Flutter Mane, one of the biggest threats in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draco Meteor versus Ice Beam</strong>: Draco Meteor's power makes switching offensive threats like Urshifu-R into Hisuian Goodra tricky, and it is notable for 2HKOing Dondozo. Ice Beam lets Hisuian Goodra punish important Ground-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acid Spray</strong>: Acid Spray is a useful wallbreaking tool, capable of making even specially bulky foes like Clodsire risk taking massive damage after the Special Defense drop.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: Thunderbolt is another way to 2HKO physically defensive Dondozo and OHKO offensive Urshifu-R and pairs very well with Ice Beam in terms of coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: While not particularly strong, Earthquake is highly recommended for 2HKOing Heatran and 3HKOing opposing Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra, as both of these will wall this set otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: For other Steel-types like Gholdengo and Scizor, Flamethrower will deal much more damage than Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modest versus Quiet</strong>: The importance of mirror matches makes Modest an appealing option for Hisuian Goodra, but Quiet will ensure that all but the bulkiest Flutter Mane will need to Terastallize to avoid an OHKO from Heavy Slam.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Surf</strong>: Surf is a decent option to hit Ground-types and Heatran with one attack, but Surf will, at best, usually only 3HKO Heatran.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Despite Hisuian Goodra's superb typing, its common weaknesses to Ground and Fighting make Terastallization a valuable route for it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying covers Hisuian Goodra's former weaknesses fantastically, even giving it an out against Fissure Dondozo. This comes at the cost of doing much worse against Iron Bundle, Thundurus-T, Zapdos, and Rotom-W though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy still gives Hisuian Goodra a vital Fighting resistance, as well as being a good defensive typing in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water has good synergy with Sap Sipper, giving Hisuian Goodra a sole weakness to Electric, in addition to gaining a useful Ice resistance against Chien-Pao, at the cost of doing worse against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Female Gender</strong>: If using Heavy Slam, there is a a chance that Hisuian Goodra can become infatuated by the very rare Cute Charm Enamorus, making a female gender very slightly superior.</li> </ul>"

Ice Beam, on the other hand, is a safer and stronger option against Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rest and Chesto Berry</strong>: Rest and Chesto Berry combine to give Hisuian Goodra a great way to restore health, though the combination is only reliable once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Dew</strong>: Life Dew doesn't restore much health even with Leftovers, but it can help Hisuian Goodra last longer against some physical threats after setting up.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Hisuian Goodra's fantastic typing doesn't make Terastallization a requirement, but it does make setting up against major physical threats like Urshifu-R and Landorus-T much more feasible.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying not only covers all of Hisuian Goodra's former weaknesses, but it also means Fissure is no longer an option to break through its boosts from the likes of Dondozo or Ting-Lu. The new weaknesses to Electric and Ice can harm it though, since Electric- and Ice-type coverage moves are commonly special.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy gives Hisuian Goodra shielding from both Urshifu formes without giving it the harmful Electric and Ice weaknesses that Flying does, though it can harm mirror matches against Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Careful or Sassy</strong>: This specially defensive spread is Hisuian Goodra's best shot at avoiding a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Tera Fairy Moonblast, assuming extra Leftovers recovery from Protect.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish or Relaxed</strong>: Maximum physical bulk means Hisuian Goodra won't check Flutter Mane nearly as well, but it let will let Body Press become a better sweeping tool.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Acid Armor</strong>: Acid Armor is the best option for boosting Defense due to its higher PP, but it requires Hisuian Sligoo to evolve while knowing the move in either Scarlet or Violet, as it's not able to be relearned by Hisuian Goodra. Shelter is still a viable, albeit strictly inferior, option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Female Gender</strong>: While very rare, Heavy Slam being a contact move means Hisuian Goodra does risk of activating Enamorus's Cute Charm, making a female gender a marginally better choice.</p> </li> </ul>"

This makes Icicle Crash the more consistent option for overall damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Support Partners</strong>: Even though Avalugg stops foes such as Dondozo from using Fissure, it lacks the power to cleanly beat these targets on its own. Common stall teammates such as Toxapex and Clodsire can bring Toxic or Toxic Spikes to spread status, allowing Avalugg to simply stall while poison wears down the opposition.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: Full investment into HP and Defense give Avalugg insane physical bulk.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With the rise of powerful defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Dragonite, Toxapex stands out as a masterful spreader of poison to support its teammates!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic is the most reliable way to spread the deadliest version of poison and is especially effective against Taunt users like Annihilape if using Mental Herb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Toxic Spikes makes the team less reliant on Toxapex to spread status directly, and acts as excellent support for stalling teammates like Ting-Lu, Dragonite and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Haze</strong>: Even with Toxapex's great bulk, powerful setup sweepers like Chien-Pao and Dragonite quickly get out of control for it, so Haze is the best solution to prevent Toxapex from being setup bait.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Liquidation versus Chilling Water</strong>: Liqudation isn't particularly strong but it allows Toxapex to 2HKO Chi-Yu and is the best option for breaking Substitute against targets like Flutter Mane. Chilling Water with a Bold or Impish nature gives Toxapex another tool against physical sweepers, but makes it much more vulnerable to Substitute in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Baneful Bunker</strong>: If using Black Sludge or Leftovers, Baneful Bunker is a fantastic way to spread poison against physical attackers and get some extra recovery with one moveslot, but keep in mind that this won't work against Urshifu-R. It's also key for scouting dangerous uses of Trick from the likes of Gholdengo and Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Physically Defensive versus Specially Defensive</strong>: Physically defensive Toxapex does well against some hard-to-check threats, such as Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao. Specially defensive Toxapex, on the other hand, has a better shot of beating Heatran and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Infestation</strong>: Infestation is Toxapex's best chance of doing chip damage to Toxic-immune threats, such as Corviknignt and Gholdengo, and the trapping works fairly well against foes that do have problems with Toxic. It also prevents double switching from being an issue for Toxapex.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization can help Toxapex beat a new set of threats, its bulk and good defensive typing usually makes it a rare occurrence compared to its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Besides making Toxapex far less vulnerable to Electric, which some foes like Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur may Terastallize into, Tera Poison retains the ability to restore health with Black Sludge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy removes all of Toxapex's weaknesses and can save it from taking massive damage from Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse. It also does well against powerful Dragon-type attacks such as Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage and Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass can prevent Breloom and Amoonguss from being disastrous with Spore, in addition to doing well against Rotom-W. It also gives an important Ground-type resistance against targets such as Ting-Lu and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While Normal isn't an impressive defensive type, Tera Normal can punish Choice locked Ghost-types, such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: While the Stealth Rock weakness can be an issue, Tera Bug is a niche way to resist Ground-type attacks while being neutral to both Ice- and Electric-type moves, unlike other methods.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying not only protects Toxapex from its irritating Ground-type weakness but also means bulky users of Fissure, such as Dondozo and Ting-Lu, will no longer pressure Toxapex. However, this typing makes Toxapex much worse into general offense.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Black Sludge versus Leftovers</strong>: Having passive healing is wonderful, especially with Baneful Bunker. Black Sludge is a clever way to get around Item Clause, but Leftovers gives Toxapex more freedom in choosing its Tera type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: While Urshifu-R often has contact protection, other physical attackers such as Chien-Pao can be gradually worn down through Rocky Helmet chip.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: With Mental Herb providing one-time protection from Taunt, Toxapex can surprise foes like Annihilape and Ting-Lu with Toxic, which is especially helpful if not running an attack.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>The combination of Curse, Substitute, and Pain Split is devastating against key defensive Pokemon such as Dondozo and Wo-Chien.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Play Rough versus Shadow Claw:</strong> Play Rough is the most consistent option due to having no immunities, and doing well against the large amount of Dark and Fighting Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu. Shadow Claw is Mimikyu's best shot at dealing damage to Gholdengo, at the cost of doing poorly against Normal-types.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt does an even better job of shutting down defensive foes, but makes Mimikyu totally useless against Gholdengo and vulnerable to faster uses of Taunt itself.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This Mimikyu rarely Terastallizes, but it can be useful in a few situations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy / Ghost</strong>: Terastallizing this Mimikyu for extra damage output is fairly situational, but getting a bit of extra power can help late game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Besides being a good defensive typing, Tera Steel means Mimikyu can get around Toxic Spikes later in the match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Against common users of Fissure such as Dondozo, this gives Mimikyu a situational way to stall them out more easily while healthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison lets Mimikyu absorb Toxic Spikes, which seriously threaten this strategy otherwise.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Despite this set's focus on stalling, Life Orb's offensive boost is worth considering to give Mimikyu the potential to clean up weakened teams, as well as OHKO frail foes such as Chien-Pao with Play Rough.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Salac Berry</strong>: Salac Berry gives Mimikyu a new option for cleaning up teams late-game. Note that unlike almost any other user of Salac Berry, this Mimikyu will prefer to use Substitute as much as possible to fully take advantage of Curse, so using an HP stat divisible by 4 is not recommended.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Figy Berry</strong>: Figy Berry and it's other counterparts give Mimikyu another method of healing after using Substitute enough times.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bright Powder</strong>: While not particularly reliable, even one miss against Mimikyu can be devastating!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>20 HP / 220 Atk / 12 Def / 4 SpD / 252 Spe</strong> This EV spread lets Mimikyu maintain its Substitute against 4 Attack EV Garganacl's Salt Cure, The odd HP number is relevant if Mimikyu uses Curse without its Disguise being broken, keeping Mimikyu's HP stat odd so that it can use Substitute twice after using Curse, or use Curse twice in a row without KOing itself.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 12 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This bulkier EV spread gives Mimikyu an odd HP number that it can take advantage of if it uses Curse without its Disguise being broken, letting it use Curse again without KOing itself the next turn or using Substitute twice after using Curse. The rest is place in Defense to take priority attacks better.</p> </li> </ul>"

This way, Mimikyu can't be confused by eating any Berry after using Trick.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Destiny Bond</strong>: Mimikyu's good Speed makes it a good option for making trades with Destiny Bond.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This Mimikyu's supportive nature means it'll only Terastallize under specific conditions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy gives enough of a boost to Play Rough to OHKO Chien-Pao and deal over 50% to Ting-Lu that don't invest in Defense.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost gives Mimikyu a good chance to OHKO Dragapult with Shadow Claw, and a boosted Shadow Sneak has situational value in the late-game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: With Wood Hammer being boosted, Mimikyu OHKOes offensive Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While this makes Mimikyu far more vulnerable to Breloom, it is useful for catching other Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane off guard.</p> </li> </ul>"

Meanwhile, Iron Head ensures that Corviknight will not be walled by Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, and Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Corviknight might not be fast, but it's fast enough to shut down most other defensive Pokemon with Taunt, such as Dondozo and Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brave Bird</strong>: Brave Bird can be difficult to fit in, but it's a fantastic response against Breloom, and means Corviknight doesn't have to be passive against Amoonguss and Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Corviknight's defensive typing is fantastic, so don't Terastallize too hastily, or else it'll lose to threats it normally checks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Dragon and Fairy weaknesses are devastating, but in the late-game, resisting Electric and Fire can give Corviknight new win conditions against old foes such as Rotom-W, and a shot to seriously damage Chi-Yu with Body Press. Just note that Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Getting STAB on Body Press can give Corviknight a surprisingly decent chance at cleaning weakened teams, with being able to 3HKO specially defensive Ting-Lu being a highlight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: With Tera Water, Corviknight consistently survives all but Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu's Overheat, letting it deal serious damage with Body Press. It also gains a key resistance to Ice for Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: While this set doesn't always use Brave Bird, Tera Flying lets Corviknight keep its typing while using Roost, meaning Earthquake and Fissure can no longer hit Corviknight while its restoring health.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: This lets Corviknight wear down physical threats more quickly while pivoting.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: Safety Goggles ensures Corviknight won't be impacted by Spore from Breloom, Amoonguss, or Brute Bonnet, regardless of having Taunt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's consistent recovery can be quite helpful for taking repeated hits from Ruination when attempting to stall it out with Pressure.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: Mirror Armor's ability to punish Flutter Mane for using Mystical Fire makes it the best ability choice on Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Corviknight's excellent bulk makes Pressure a good alternative for stalling out foes such as Dondozo, and is particularly good at stalling out Ruination from Ting-Lu and Wo-Chien.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also prevents Corviknight from being walled by Flutter Mane and Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: While U-turn with this set may seem strange, Corviknight is still a decent pivot even if it must give up Taunt.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Corviknight has a fantastic defensive typing, so only Terastallize if you need to win certain matchups, especially since it becomes vulnerable to Toxic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: With a Fighting Tera type, Body Press is easier to sweep with, with many Ting-Lu variants now being 2HKOed by boosted Body Press.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Corviknight a way to resist both Chien-Pao's and Chi-Yu's most powerful STAB attacks, though Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: A Dragon Tera type lets Corviknight resist common attacks aimed at it, such as Electric- and Fire-type attacks. However, the new weaknesses to Fairy and Dragon make this an especially reactive Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: A Flying Tera type lets Corviknight retain its Flying typing even when using Roost, making it a more reliable check to Fissure users such as Dondozo and Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: The passive damage from Rocky Helmet against Mimikyu gives Corviknight a much easier time using Taunt over Iron Head.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: When paired with Taunt, Covert Cloak makes Corviknight an effective Garganacl check, though note Corviknight will no longer drop Flutter Mane's Special Attack with Mirror Armor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: With Safety Goggles blocking Spore, this Corviknight is now an excellent check against most offensive Breloom, just watch out for the occasional Tera Fire Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Since this Corviknight attempts to sweep, Sitrus Berry's burst of quick recovery can make it less pressured to spend a turn using Roost. Leftovers on the other hand, will still keep healing Corviknight even after being hit by Ruination, so it can make sense with Pressure.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: Mirror Armor means Flutter Mane can't use Mystical Fire without getting its Special Attack dropped, unless Corviknight is holding Covert Cloak.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Corviknight's ability to take powerful, low PP moves such as Close Combat after Iron Defense makes Pressure a viable alternative, in addition to giving Corviknight a better chance of dealing with Ruination from Ting-Lu and Wo-Chien effectively.</p> </li> </ul>"

That being said, outspeeding Pokemon that commonly have their Speed boosted via an item, such as Flutter Mane, Gholdengo, and Iron Bundle, can lead to surprising win conditions.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Dragapult's cleaning capabilities are improved quite a bit by Terastallization, though it doesn't need to rely on it to be functional.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Boosting the power of Dragon Darts makes Dragapult very effective at shredding through Focus Sash Pokemon such as Chien-Pao, in addition to removing the annoying Sucker Punch weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel has a fantastic synergy with Dragapult's former typing, giving it a far better match-up against foes such as Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost is notable for letting Dragapult use a less risky STAB move in Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives a valuable Fairy-type resistance and is a more powerful tool against Steel-types at the cost of a Stealth Rock weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dragon-type immunity can help win Tera wars against foes like Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting vastly improves Dragapult's match-up against Kingambit, Chi-Yu, Chien-Pao, and Choice Scarf Meowscarada.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band</strong>: Choice Band guarantees that Breloom is OHKOed through its Focus Sash with Dragon Darts, and gives a 75% shot to the same happening to Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb makes Sucker Punch a less risky option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Dragaoult's bulk isn't terrible, but Focus Sash will save it from the huge amount of top tier Pokemon that are capable of OHKOing it, such as Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: This may seem like overkill, but Choice Scarf gives Dragapult the edge over Booster Energy users such as Iron Bundle, Roaring Moon, and Flutter Mane, and other Choice Scarf foes such Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also forces opponents to use recovery moves or switch out, allowing Dragapult's teammates to get in and set up safely. Curse is Dragapult’s best option to bypass Substitute, Protect, and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: This breaks Focus Sash, hits Ghosts like Gholdengo and Flutter Mane that normally threaten it, and breaks Mimikyu's Disguise. Notably Gholdengo stops Curse with Good as Gold, making Dragapult totally helpless against it if it does not carry Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Darts</strong>: Dragon Darts can be used for more power to make Dragapult more self-sufficient when it has to stay on the field, and breaks Focus Sash as well. Its dual-hit nature makes it bypass most Substitutes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical attackers. In tandem with Reflect, this can be a potent strategy to allow the next Pokemon to set up nearly risk-free.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Very Situational</strong>: As a dual screens lead, Terastallizing can compromise its teammates sweeping abilities, so it should only be done in emergencies.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost / Dragon</strong>: If you are in a bad spot, Ghost and Dragon power up its STAB move of choice.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: A defensive typing like Steel can allow Dragapult to survive certain moves like Iron Bundle's Ice Beam, boosted Cloyster's Icicle Spear, and boosted Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush and retaliate.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: A Fairy Tera type is useful for enemy Infiltrator Dragapult's Dragon Darts.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: While Light Clay is standard, Focus Sash nearly guarantees setting at least one screen without having to Terastallize, in the event Dragapult leads off against Choice Scarf users like Gholdengo, Hydreigon, and Meowscarada.</li> </ul>"

After a Swords Dance boost, Tera Dark-boosted Wicked Blow is a guaranteed OHKO on physically defensive Zapdos, while Close Combat has a high chance to OHKO Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: This Tera type allows Urshifu-S to survive common Fairy-type and Fighting-type attacks that would otherwise threaten to KO Urshifu-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: For Focus Sash sets, Tera Ghost blocks Normal-type priority from the likes of Dragonite, Ogerpon formes, or Entei from picking Urshifu-S off.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash can help Urshifu-S more reliably get off a Swords Dance boost.

Black Glasses gives a slightly stronger boost, while Punching Glove helps to protect Urshifu-S from contact effects like Rocky Helmet and Zapdos's Static. Urshifu-S is much less vulnerable to these effects compared to Urshifu-R due to lack of a multi-hit move.

Even if running Focus Sash, Urshifu-R can restore enough health with boosted Drain Punch that it can save itself from being chipped off by weak priority moves, such as Aqua Jet from Primarina and opposing Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Aqua Jet</strong>: Aqua Jet is perfect for picking off weakened foes that are faster than Urshifu-R, such as Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane, but this does come at the cost of coverage or a setup move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: With Swords Dance, Urshifu-R becomes far more difficult to wall, with Surging Strikes now 2HKOing even the bulkiest Cresselia.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch versus Ice Spinner</strong>: While Ice Spinner is more powerful when not using Punching Glove, Ice Punch can still make sense because it reveals less information about Urshifu-R's set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Punch</strong>: Thunder Punch is overpowered by Close Combat even against foes that are weak to it, but it can potentially 3HKO Dondozo when using Tera Electric and Punching Glove and is a safer option against opposing Urshifu-R than Close Combat. This is also Urshifu-R's most powerful attack against Primarina.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jolly versus Adamant</strong>: Jolly is preferred for outspeeding Landorus-T and Mimikyu, key targets of Surging Strikes. Adamant can make sense if using Swords Dance and Aqua Jet together, having a better chance of sweeping late-game against fast threats that often run some bulk investment, such as Flutter Mane and Choice Band Chein-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Bulk Up</strong>: Bulk Up takes advantage of Urshifu-R's underrated physical bulk, though it will fail to wallbreak defensive foes like Cresselia as easily.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trailblaze</strong>: While difficult to fit in coverage-wise, Trailblaze's Speed boost can be a shocking win condition considering Urshifu-R's decent Speed, letting it outspeed even Iron Bundle!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Urshifu-R is able to function perfectly fine without Terastallization, though it has both offensive and defensive uses for it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: The Tera Water boost to Surging Strikes makes Urshifu-R even more difficult to wall, with even Ting-Lu that lack Sitrus Berry being OHKOed by +2 Surging Strikes. It also makes Aqua Jet a more effective cleaning move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison gifts Urshifu-R a key Fairy and Fighting resistance, in addition to absorbing Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a strong defensive option for Urshifu-R, letting it take on Fairy, Grass, Flying, and Psychic attacks that normally threaten to OHKO it. It also means Iron Bundle will no longer OHKO Urshifu-R with Freeze-Dry. However unlike Tera Poison, it's an issue when fighting opposing Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: When paired with Thunder Punch, this is Urshifu-R's best shot of breaking through Primarina and wearing down Dondozo, in addition to giving it a useful Electric-type resistance and paralysis immunity.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove</strong>: Punching Gloves protects Urshifu-R from taking devastating damage by hitting Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin with Surging Strikes, in addition to boosting other punching moves.

However, Headlong Rush's extra power can better fit the playstyles of Ursaluna that may aim for a sweep rather than just wallbreaking, such as Trick Room and Jolly variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drain Punch versus Close Combat</strong>: Drain Punch doesn't offer much extra coverage, but it's Ursaluna's only decent way of restoring health. Close Combat's sheer power does make it decent coverage though and can particularly punish Heatran for Terastallizing into a Grass-type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch versus Play Rough</strong>: Once Ursaluna is burned, Ice Punch will deal so much damage to Dragonite that even the bulkiest sets can not restore all their health with Roost. Play Rough isn't nearly as effective against Dragonite, but when used with Tera Fairy, Ursaluna can now OHKO Urshifu-R before Flame Orb kicks in.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: While Ursaluna is powerful, it needs the Flame Orb activation to truly wallbreak, so Protect can help when switching it in isn't easy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulk Up versus Swords Dance</strong>: Bulk Up is the prefered setup move for making Ursaluna difficult to revenge kill with physical attacks, but Swords Dance does offer some truly absurd wallbreaking potential, allowing Ursaluna to OHKO even physically defensive Ting-Lu with Facade! Swords Dance can also be a better fit on Trick Room teams due to the limited amount of turns Ursaluna has to sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trailblaze</strong>: If using Jolly Ursaluna, Trailblaze lets it outspeed key threats such as Zapdos, both Urshifu formes, Mimikyu, and even Speed tie with Timid Thundurus-T!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Ursaluna benefits from Terastallization, but it's not integral to its wallbreaking prowess.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Beyond getting rid of Ground's annoying weaknesses, Tera Normal turns Ursaluna into an even more fearsome wallbreaker,</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy does a great job of protecting Ursaluna from powerful Fighting-type attacks and Dragonite's Outrage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While Tera Ghost does make the matchup against Flutter Mane and Gholdengo worse, the Fighting immunity can turn a match around in the blink of an eye.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is the prime Tera type to use when in need of an Ice and Water resistance, which is helpful against Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: If using Drain Punch, Tera Fighting is a reasonable option for restoring even more health, at the cost of being rather weak against Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Gass is a niche option that lets Ursaluna deal extra damage with Trailblaze while resisting Water-type attacks and taking Spore before Flame Orb activates.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Brave and a 0 Speed IV versus Adamant</strong>: On a Trick Room team, this lets Ursaluna underspeed some major Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Dondozo. However, some Trick Room teams may still prefer Adamant to outspeed such slow Pokemon if they also function outside Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 252 Atk / 116 SpD with Adamant or Brave</strong>: This more specially defensive EV spread survives some powerful attacks even after burn damage, including Timid Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast, Thundurus-T's Grass Knot, Timid Greninja's Hydro Pump, and Modest Chi-Yu's Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximizing Speed may seem strange on such a slow Pokemon, but Ursaluna makes fantastic use of it, making Trailblaze viable due to outspeeding even offensive variants of Zapdos after a boost and letting it wallbreak common Pokemon that often don't invest in enough Speed such as Dragonite and Heatran.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Female Gender</strong>: Since Ursaluna uses contact moves, a female gender will prevent it from being attracted to the rare Cute Charm Enamorus.</li> </ul>"

It's a great way to cover a switch or predicted Terastallization, but it requires some forethought to maximize efficiency because it cannot be used on consecutive turns.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vacuum Wave</strong>: Vacuum Wave is highly valuable for revenge killing foes, notably hitting Chien-Pao. It can hit Gholdengo due to Mind's Eye.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power</strong>: Earth Power gives great coverage against the Steel-types that resist Blood Moon, making Ursaluna-B nearly unwallable except by non-grounded Steel-types like Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyper Voice</strong>: Hyper Voice is a more spammable Normal-type STAB move that can bypass Substitute, allowing Ursaluna-B to thwart attempts to Substitute stall out Blood Moon, like Tera Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Ursaluna-B often uses Terastallization to compensate for its lackluster defensive typing; however, it is often capable of functioning without Tera.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its good Attack, Speed, and access to Flower Trick and Knock Off, Meowscarada is a potent cleaner that is also hard to switch into.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flower Trick</strong>: With its guaranteed critical hit, Flower Trick is a dangerous cleaning move once resistances to it have been sufficiently chipped.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: If using Protean, Meowscarada is a pivot that does far more damage than most users of U-turn, and helps Choice Scarf Meowscarada get out of some tricky early-game situations such as Chien-Pao leads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Triple Axel versus Play Rough</strong>: Triple Axel may not be the most reliable move out there, but it strikes fear into the heart of Dragonite and Landorus-T, who can both be big offensive issues for Meowscarda. Play Rough isn't nearly as good at handling Dragon-types besides Roaring Moon, but it does blast through Urshifu-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jolly versus Adamant</strong>: Jolly is usually preferred for outspeeding fast threats like Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant, but Adamant 's extra power can be justified on Choice Scarf since it still outspeeds Choice Scarf Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protean versus Overgrow</strong>: Protean’s type-shifting allows Meowscarada to make the most of its colorful movepool, particularly on Choice-locked sets, where the limitation to only changing types once is effectively nullified. f you intend to make use of a Tera type other than Grass or Stellar, Overgrow is worth considering, as it allows Meowscarada more flexibility with its moves by not changing type and removing STAB from Flower Trick or Knock Off.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Low Kick versus Brick Break</strong>: Low Kick OHKOs Chien-Pao, Roaring Moon, if using Protean, as well as Tera Normal Ursaluna-B if using Choice Band, but Brick Break deals far more damage against Chi-Yu. Both however, can face competition with Meowscarada's other coverage moves.</li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: With the Speed offered via Choice Scarf, Meowscarada can threaten otherwise faster foes, such as Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane, potentially putting more pressure on offensive teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band</strong>: Choice Band boosted Meowscarada hits incredibly hard, and with its naturally high Speed it can serve as a cleaner and a potential wallbreaker.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Terastallization overriding Protean means Meowscarada should usually only Terastallize to clean a weakened team late-game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: While Terastallizing does override Protean, Tera Grass Meowscarada can be used to power through teams ill-prepared for it. Dual screens teams in particular are especially vulnerable to the sheer power of Choice Band-boosted Tera Grass Flower Trick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosted Knock Off isn't as reliable at sweeping as Flower Trick, but it can surprise bulky Steel-types such as Scizor and Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar's one-time boost per attack can give Meowscarada more flexible cleaning options. If Meowscarada Terastallizes after using Protean, the type it currently is will get the double base power boost, which can lead to unexpectedly powerful coverage moves!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives Meowscarada a Will-O-Wisp immunity and an Ice resistance that can surprise Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>76 HP / 244 Atk / 108 Def / 4 SpD / 76 Speed with Jolly</strong>: This spread allows Meowscarada to outspeed timid Chi-Yu while avoiding an OHKO from Breloom's Mach Punch, Chien-Pao's Ice Shard and Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Trick And Neutral Natures</strong>: Trick can help Choice-locked sets incapacitate an annoying wall, such as Dondozo or Wo-Chien, by locking them into a single move. Make sure to use a neutral nature and use a Jolly Mint on Meowscarada, so it won't get confused by eating any Berry after Trick.</li> </ul>"

It also hits Chi-Yu switch-ins hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute is a good way around status, especially Garganacl's Salt Cure. It also becomes effective when used on Toxic Spikes teams.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: When paired with Substitute, Skeledirge can seriously punish passive Pokemon, though at a serious cost in coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flame Charge</strong>: Despite Skeledirge's low Speed, stacking Flame Charge boosts can make it difficult to check, though it'll often need multiple boosts to outspeed threats without compromising its bulk.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Skeledirge's defensive typing isn't without its merits, but the wide variety of weaknesses it has often forces Skeledirge to Terastallize to check major threats like Chien-Pao and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Terastallizing into the Fairy typing removes Skeledirges glaring weakness to Dark and provides an overall superior defensive typing. making Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu far more reasonable to deal with. It also provides a neutral typing for the inevitable Shadow Balls that will be thrown at Skeledirge, like from Flutter Mane or Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While Tera Normal isn't fantastic defensively, it lets Skeledirge severely punish attempts from special attacking Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo to check it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: A Water Tera type lets Skeledirge take on opposing Water attacks, providing a valuable turn to burn foes like Azumarill and Palafin-H. It should be noted that Tera Water tends to be a safer option versus the common Gholdengo, as it does not often run Thunderbolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Despite the defensive nature of this set, Tera Fire's increased power for Torch Song is welcome, and it still helps Skeledirge against Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Sitrus Berry</strong>: Residual recovery helps Skeledirge use Torch Song more freely. Leftovers is the best option since Skeledirge has instant recovery, but Sitrus Berry with an even HP stat can be used to restore some health after getting hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak ignores the secondary effects of Salt Cure and Acid Spray, improving Skeledirge's match-up against Garganacl, Iron Moth, and Bellibolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: The immunity to Spore Skeledirge gains lets it check Breloom, Amoonguss, and Brute Bonnet far more effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: This makes Skeledirge less pressured to Terastallize to rid itself of its Stealth Rock weakness.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>220 HP / 76 Def / 212 SpD with Bold</strong>: This EV spread allows both Tera Fairy and Water Skeledirge to avoid a 2HKO from a plethora of offensive threats, such as Focus Sash Chien-Pao, Modest Gholdengo, Adamant Azumarill, and Choice Specs Dragapult, while still boasting significant physical bulk.</li> </ul>"

Modest variants will outspeed up to Modest Choice Scarf Chi-Yu and Jolly Choice Scarf Annihilape, while Timid sets will Speed tie with +1 Espathra.</p> </li> </ul>"

Grassy Terrain also halving Earthquake’s power is greatly appreciated by bulky teammates like Skeledirge, Arcanine, and Iron Hands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: This move keeps Arboliva from becoming setup bait against foes like offensive Dragonite, and is also your best move into Wo-Chien before Tera.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast is a great option for hitting types that Arboliva lacks natural coverage for. Tera Fire lets Arboliva hit Steel-types like Scizor and Tera Electric punishes Tera Flying users like Gholdengo. Both Tera Fire and Tera Electric cover Corviknight as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Coat</strong>: This set’s massive special bulk can make getting one-shots with Mirror Coat awkward, but it is still a great option, particularly against boosted or super effective hits. Bear in mind though that this won’t work against Chi-Yu as long as it keeps its Dark typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leaf Storm</strong>: Leaf Storm trades consistency for a single turn of high burst damage and can be worth it if investing in Special Attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Arboliva’s raw special stats make it capable of tanking super effective hits without using Tera. Nonetheless, Tera is still a strong tool to extend Arboliva’s uptime and contest matchups that would otherwise capitalize on its mediocre defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire can flip matchups against Focus Sash Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu when healthy. If running Tera Blast, it also gives Arboliva the opportunity to contest Steel-types more effectively. Be aware, though, that this significantly worsens other key matchups, like Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a solid defensive option, especially into Toxic abusers like Toxapex and Clodsire. Notably, it flips several weaknesses, blocks Toxic, and allows for absorbing Toxic Spikes later in the match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric is Gholdengo's worst nightmare. It gives a resistance to Make It Rain, blocks Thunder Wave from defensive sets, and punishes Tera Flying usage that is meant to get around Earth Power. On top of that, Arboliva still hits Corviknight very hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is another great defensive option for neutralizing most of Arboliva's weaknesses, and the extra power behind Dazzling Gleam can make it easier to break defensive Dragonite variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass removes Arboliva’s Fighting weakness while maintaining Spore immunity, letting it check Breloom. If both Tera and Grassy Terrain are active, Modest Giga Drain can even 2HKO Breloom!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: While not as strong defensively, invested Tera Earth Power can OHKO uninvested Chi-Yu and Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 4 Def / 140 SpA / 124 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread balances bulk and power, avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Specs Gholdengo's Make It Rain and almost always surviving Modest Chi-Yu’s Fire Blast before Tera! If running Tera Ground, there are enough Special Attack EV’s to turn Earth Power into an OHKO against uninvested Chi-Yu and Gholdengo. The Speed EV's Speed tie with 4 Speed Gastrodon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 252 SpA / 20 SpD with Modest</strong>: This simple spread still provides plenty of bulk while maximizing Special Attack, working nicely with Leaf Storm and Tera Types that boost Arboliva's coverage moves. If Grassy Terrain is present, fully invested Leaf Storm has a 75% chance of OHKOing 4 Special Defense Garchomp. The bulk investment lets Arboliva always avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire after Grassy Terrain recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 20 SpD / 252 Spe with Modest</strong>: While maximum Speed investment may seem a bit strange, it can be worth it when running Tera Fire Tera Blast to get the jump on Scizor, Corviknight and the rare Timid Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 4 Def / 148 SpA / 20 SpD / 100 Spe with Modest</strong>: This alternative Speed spread gives Arboliva a nice boost in Special Attack while still letting it outrun 4 Speed Azumarill. This is usually more than enough Speed to outrun Ting-Lu as well.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With some entry hazard support, this Garganacl can be very difficult to outstall, thanks to the constant passive damage from Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Not only does Protect scout for surprise Tera types, but it also goes well with the passive healing from Leftovers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Since this set benefits so much from Stealth Rock support, running it on its own is a reasonable sacrifice if Garganacl needs to be more self-sufficient.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: This makes Garganacl even more difficult to properly switch into, providing protection against Trick, OHKO moves, and opposing Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fissure</strong>: Garganacl's great bulk makes it a prime candidate for fishing with Fissure itself, though its low PP can be an issue in mirror matches.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fling with Light Ball, Toxic Orb, or Flame Orb</strong>: Although the loss of Leftovers can be a huge blow for Garganacl, Fling and its associated status inducing items can be a devastating surprise for some of its checks, such as Annihilape and Urshifu formes. Just note that Covert Cloak will still block these statuses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy and Custap Berry</strong>: Getting rid of Garganacl's status immunity and Ghost resistance is a huge sacrifice, but it can let Garganacl lead against some surprising Pokemon effectively without needing to Terastallize, like Choice Specs Chi-Yu and Iron Bundle. Custap Berry's pseudo-priority can also lead to surprising Stealth Rock set-ups.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Rock may be an awful defensive typing, this Garganacl's complete focus on taking advantage of Salt Cure means that in some scenarios, it can get away without Terastallizing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison's Fighting and Fairy-type resistance vastly improves Garganacl's match-up against Flutter Mane, Ogerpon-H, and Urshifu-R, making it a prime Tera choice. As a bonus, this also lets Garganacl absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Garganacl a better matchup against Chien-Pao, Urshifu-R, and Gholdengo, in addition to being an excellent defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While removing Purifying Salt's Ghost resistance is a shame, Tera Ghost does wonderfully against Archaludon and opposing Garganacl due to the Body Press immunity, and in general removes all of Garganacl's common weaknesses. Tera Ghost also can make foes paranoid of it being the Curse set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying gets rid of the Ground and Fighting weaknesses, giving it a far better chance of beating Landorus-T and Ursaluna-B. It also makes Fissure no longer an issue from Ting-Lu, Dondozo, and opposing Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy lets Garganacl tank powerful Fighting coverage such as Chien-Pao's Scared Sword, and shrug off powerful Dragon-type attacks from Latios and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Curse's well-known different effect for Ghost-types being brought into play by Terastallization, Garganacl makes dangerous and diverse use of the move! Boosting Salt Cure's meager power can also help against frailer Substitute users such as Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Ghost Curse</strong>: If using Tera Ghost, Curse will change its effect, which drastically changes Garganacl's playstyle. While the 50% health cut can make it a tad risky, the Curse affliction is very powerful at wearing down Pokemon, including major foes that take advantage of Salt Cure, such as Covert Cloak Pokemon, bulky Substitute users, and Blaziken Baton Pass chains. When combined with Salt Cure, it can even overwhelm bulky Pokemon with recovery, such as Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curse and Earthquake</strong>: Ghost Curse unfortunately does not work against Gholdengo, so using regular Curse alongside Earthquake makes Garganacl far less passive against against Gholdengo and frail Substitute users such as Flutter Mane. This is especially recommended if using other Tera types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect versus Substitute</strong>: Protect is perfect for getting some extra Leftovers recovery, but Substitute comes in handy against Dragon Tail users like Archaludon and Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Salt Cure means Garganacl can still without Terastallization, but to truly take advantage of either facet of Curse, expect to Terastallize it often.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: In addition to being a great defensive typing that leaves Garganacl with only a weakness to Dark thanks to Purifying Salt, this is the Tera type that enables the unique properties of Curse.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is Garganacl's best option against Flutter Mane, ensuring it resists both STAB attacks. Absorbing Toxic Spikes is also helpful against stall teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: If messing with Gholdengo is the goal, Tera Water is an excellent choice, resisting the powerful Make It Rain and being a good defensive typing in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Beyond being a great typing that offers a Fighting-type resistance, it also means Garganacl no longer has to worry about Dragon Tail from Archaludon. This doesn't improve Garganacl's match-up against Gholdengo though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying has excellent synergy with Garganacl's former typing, making it immune to Landorus-T and Ursaluna-B's Ground-type attacks, and even removing any worry about Fissure from Ting-Lu and Dondozo. However, this comes at the cost of still making it vulnerable to Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul>"

The Fighting-type resistance against Urshifu formes and Toxic Spikes absorption is also quite helpful.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water vastly improves Garganacl's chances of defeating Gholdengo, Urshifu-R, and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: A Ghost Tera type gives Garganacl an immunity to Body Press, giving it the edge against Archaludon and opposing Garganacl, especially when paired with Leftovers. It can also fool players into thinking Garganacl is using the Curse set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: A Flying typing lets Garganacl take on new foes such as Landorus-T, Ursaluna-B, and Garchomp, though it makes Garganacl fairly weak to Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Fairy is a good defensive type for Garganacl, giving it a useful Fighting and Dark resistance to help against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, and no longer worrying about powerful Dragon-type attacks. However, Garganacl still remains vulnerable to powerful Steel-type attacks from foes like Gholdengo. EV Spreads ========</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Careful</strong>: Maximizing Special Defense is the best choice for easier setup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish</strong>: In addition to powering up Body Press, a focus on Defense makes setting up on powerful setup sweepers such as Dragonite an easier task.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 84 Def / 172 SpD with Careful</strong>: This EV spread allows Tera Steel Garganacl to avoid a 2HKO from Breloom's Mach Punch after Iron Defense.</p> </li> </ul>"

On the other hand, Armarouge can specialize to handle certain matchups better, at which point Tera can become more necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: This Tera typing turns Armarouge's Water- and Ground-type weaknesses into resistances, and gives a vital Spore immunity against opposing Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: With a boost from Tera Psychic, Expanding Force OHKOes even relatively bulky foes such as Garchomp and Flutter Mane. With Stealth Rock, Expanding Force still achieves most notable KOs without Tera Psychic, but the extra damage is still appreciated.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: In cases where setting up Psychic Terrain proves to be more difficult, Tera Fairy grants a resistance to Sucker Punch and makes disrupting other Dark-types like Chi-Yu easier. Its also just a solid defensive typing that neutralizes all of its other weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is a more niche option for a Dark-type resistance that also powers up Aura Sphere.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Weak Armor</strong>: This ability takes full advantage of Focus Sash, guaranteeing you live a single hit from a physical attacker and granting a big Speed boost thereafter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flash Fire</strong>: While more situational, Flash Fire is worth considering with certain Tera Types like Grass, keeping momentum against revenge killers who use Fire-type attacks.

      "Bulk Up Sweeper": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Bulk Up Ceruledge makes excellent use of both its respectable bulk and Bitter Blade's high recovery. By changing its typing to a more defense oriented one, while maintaining the Fire immunity thanks to Flash Fire, Ceruledge can set up Bulk Ups on a variety of common Pokemon, ranging from Corviknight, Kingambit, Azumarill and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt lets Ceruledge set up Bulk Up without needing to fear common phasing moves (with the exception of attacking moves such as Dragon Tail), as well as opposing setup moves such opposing Bulk Up and Iron Defense, provided you outspeed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Sneak</strong> Priority of some form is always nice to have on a Pokemon, which makes Shadow Sneak an easy contender for the last move. Gaining extra added strength against Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Dragapult and Annihilape is certainly charming.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass Tera Blast</strong>: This allows Ceruledge to eliminate Dondozo more quickly. While Taunt can shut down Dondozo's Yawn, it cannot shut down Fissure. The only way to beat Dondozo would be to eliminate it as quickly as possibly, which Grass Tera Blast aids with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flame Charge</strong>: Flame Charge provides Ceruledge an extra net of safety against potential Scarf users and Annihilape, who are capable of turning the tides against it. While normally, Ceruledge is prone to faster Taunt + Bulk Up users and Scarfed Trick, Flame Charge helps mitigate both of those weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Ceruledge can be a status spreader in games where it can't set up as easily. It also helps Ceruledge set up more easily against threats such as Unaware Clodsire.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy helps Ceruledge's matchup against prominent Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: An immunity to Spore and a resistance to Water makes Grass the most notable Tera type for this set. Flash Fire eliminating one of Grass's many weaknesses is also noteworthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Increasing Bitter Blade's power will always be a valuable trait. Eliminating Ghost's weaknesses to Ghost and Dark also allows Ceruledge to set up more comfortably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Tera Bug is similar to Tera Grass, but in exchange for losing the Water resistance and maintaining the Rock weakness of Fire / Ghost, Ceruledge can tank Volcarona's Bug Buzz with significantly more ease.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: Investing into Defense prepares Ceruledge and its mediocre physical bulk for the physical-biased metagame. Bulk Up will boost its Defense, but it can struggle to take some physical hits even after a boost, and its special bulk is naturally high.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: A faster spread helps Ceruledge outspeed other Bulk Up users, like Annihilape opting to invest in bulk. Being faster, more often than not, lets Ceruledge win these matchups with ease.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: While most threats in the metagame at the moment are physical, a specially defensive spread is still noteworthy for its ability to surprise Hydreigon.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With a stellar offensive typing, a unique set of attacks, Weak Armor allowing it to outspeed a large part of the metagame, and its immunity to Extreme Speed and Mach Punch, Ceruledge proves itself to be a very solid Focus Sash option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bitter Blade</strong>: Bitter Blade's recovery can make Focus Sash usable even if entry hazards chip it. If Ceruledge is brought down to 1 HP, a +2 Bitter Blade can heal it to the point that it can tank an extra attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Shadow Claw</strong>: Close Combat hits the Normal-, Dark-, and Rock-types that resist Ceruledge's STAB combination. Still, Shadow Claw is a noteworthy choice to guarantee the KO on Mimikyu and let Ceruledge pressure Skeledirge. Note, however, that maximum Defense Skeledirge can recover more than Shadow Claw's damage, barring critical hits, and a Terastallized Skeledirge can completely wall this set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance versus Destiny Bond</strong>: As powerful as Swords Dance boosted attacks from Ceruledge are, the abundance of Unaware Pokemon, primarily Dondozo, has made some players opt to use Destiny Bond to snag surprise kills. Destiny Bond can also make the matchup against KOing common Sucker Punch Pokemon, such as Meowscarada and Kingambit, easier to win without having to rely on predictions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant's added damage output is valuable, but Jolly allows Ceruledge to outspeed non-Scarf Gholdengo, and gives it a chance at outspeeding Modest Rotom formes and Glimmora. All of the mentioned examples are Special Attackers, meaning Ceruledge's Weak Armor often does not trigger in these matchups.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Giving Bitter Blade an extra push in damage is quite useful, giving Ceruledge more recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Normal is an exceedingly common Tera Type on Ghost types due to the immunity it brings to the table. Ceruledge makes particularly excellent use of Normal Tera by resisting both Steel and Fairy, making it very difficult for Gholdengo and Mimikyu to click anything other than a Ghost type move when facing off against Ceruledge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Giving extra reach pwer to Close Combat, a powerful option against Pokemon such as Hydreigon, makes Fighting a solid choice for a Tera Type.</p> </li> </ul>"

Alternatively, Chilling Water weakens common switch-ins such as Garchomp and Baxcalibur, allowing you to reposition your team more safely.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acid Spray</strong>: This threatens non-Steel type switch-ins, and it also lets Bellibolt effectively use Electromorphosis without having to take damage first.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Tera Fire Scovillain's damage under sun is absurd, managing to barely KO even Fire-resistant targets. Most notably, its ability to defeat most Pokemon, even powerful Dragon-types, without fearing surprise Terastallizations makes Scovillain a charming offensive option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Overheat and Fire Blast</strong>: Overheat combined with Tera Fire and Choice Specs guarantees the KO on Garchomp  without bulk EVs, and OHKO offensive Roaring Moon after Stealth Rock damage. Against the frailer Dragapult, Tera Fire and Fire Blast is enough to earn the KO. It's recommended to run both Fire STAB moves because Overheat's added damage can be necessary to guarantee certain KOs, but its stat drop can be fatal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Solar Beam versus Leaf Storm</strong>: Solar Beam nails the few bulky Water-types that can survive Scovillain's absurd attacks, most notable examples being notably Gastrodon and Assault Vest Azumarill. However, Leaf Storm can be used in its stead for the ability to OHKO Hippowdon, despite it summoning sand.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: Flamethrower is perfectly accurateand is typically more than enough to nip off frailer foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: In spite of the type matchup, Scovillain is deceptively weak to Kingambit thanks to Sucker Punch. Additionally, many Pokemon will use Protect in front of Scovillain to waste sun turns— most notably Espathra and Dondozo. Against all of these foes, a well-timed Substitute can guarantee the win.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: It is almost mandatory to run Tera Fire on this Scovillain set. Tera Fire guarantees KOs on most Dragon-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: The abundantly common Dragonite is incredibly strong against Scovillain. Should Stealth Rock support be deemed enough to let Scovillain sweep teams reasonably, even without Tera Fire, using Tera Ghost to gain an immunity to Extreme Speed can be very useful.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock</strong>: Tera Rock with Tera Blast can be a decent alternative to Tera Fire, as it gives Scovillain excellent coverage and also provides a much-needed countermeasure to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Moody Ace": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>The metagame's abundance of Unaware Pokemon makes it difficult to maneuver Moody Pokemon in general. On top of that, Scovillain is held back by the powerful Dragon-types that resist its STAB combination. However, Scovillain still carves a niche for itself by being the only Moody Pokemon with excellent recovery moves, Leech Seed and Ingrain, allowing it to win a variety of matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect and Substitute</strong>: Protect and Substitute are mandatory to get the most opportunities to activate Moody. Once you gain enough Defense or Special Defense boosts that Scovillain's Substitute can tank an attack without breaking, it tends to be easy to win the game. Note, however, that Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers's animation make Scovillain very vulnerable to losing via timer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: With enough Moody boosts, Scovillain's Flamethrower tends to be enough to break through an entire team. There are very few Pokemon that are immune or quadruply resistant to Fire, and Flamethrower has good PP and accuracy, which makes it an easy pick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: Unlike Flamethrower, Giga Drain gets shrugged off by a lot of Pokemon, even at +6, notably Corviknight and Dragonite. However, an attacking move that helps recover HP lost from Substitutes gives Scovillain more mileage off of Moody. Giga Drain is also notable to more reliably defeat Dondozo, one of the Unaware Pokemon that would give Scovillain a lot of trouble otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leech Seed</strong>: Leech Seed combined with Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers helps Scovillain restore HP while collecting Moody boosts, as well as chipping Pokemon it'd otherwise have trouble against, such as Clodsire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain</strong>: Ingrain is an alternative recovery option that makes Scovillain impervious to phazing moves. When purely considering recovery, it's more reliable than the inaccurate 90% accurate Leech Seed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast with Tera Fairy is an excellent option that helps remedy Scovillain's Dragon susceptibility, particularly making the Infiltrator Dragapult and Roaring Moon matchup easier.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: The Water resistance helps Scovillain beat Dondozo. Even though Dondozo ignores Scovillain's Defense boosts via Unaware, with Tera Water, Scovillain's Substitute can tank a Wave Crash. Tera Water also keeps the Scovillain's Steel resistance, unlike Tera Grass, which makes it easier to check Scizor—a common priority user that people attempt to use to check Moody Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy mitigating Scovillain's weakness to Dragon-types is massively helpful.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>180 HP / 220 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 100 Spe with Bold</strong>: This spread bolsters Scovillain’s physical bulk. Notably, Tera Water Scovillain's Substitute manages to survive Dondozo's Wave Crash with this spread. The Speed allows Scovillain to outspeed slow Baxcalibur and Gholdengo, as well as Dragapult with one Moody Speed boost. The HP is adjusted to make maximum use of Leftovers, with the resulting stat having a remainder of 1 when divided by 16. The remaining EVs are split between Special Attack and Special Defense because, at level 50, investing 8 EVs in either stat has no benefit over investing 4.</li> </ul>"

However, Tera Blast provides more flexible coverage that can also cover Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect versus Substitute</strong>: Protect is the most reliable way to get a free turn of Speed Boost. Substitute is a riskier option for Speed Boost stalling, but it severely punishes passive Pokemon and works extremely well on dual screen teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roost</strong>: Roost can make it incredibly difficult for special attackers to break Espathra after its used Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bold versus Timid</strong>: The given EV spread allows Espathra to outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp after two turns of Speed Boost and unboosted Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle after one turn.

With Mold Breaker ignoring Multiscale, fully invested Adamant Tera Fairy Play Rough almost always OHKOs offensive Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground thwarts Volt Switch pivoting, potentially giving Tinkaton extra turns to set up for itself or teammates.

It's possible to drop if coverage is desperately needed, but forcing Palafin to switch and losing out on a useful pivot move is not the right call in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch is Palafin-H's best bet against Dragonite before it Terastallizes, and deals decent damage to Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Drain Punch</strong>: Close Combat is good coverage, hitting Rotom-W for neutral damage and covering Baxcalibur, Iron Bundle, and Roaring Moon. While weaker, Drain Punch's lack of defensive stat drops makes sense for a better matchup against Focus Sash Chien-Pao and restoring a good amount of health against Iron Bundle before usually KOing it with Jet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: An Adamant nature increases the damage Wave Crash and Jet Punch inflict, making Palafin-H a more effective wall breaker and revenge killer. A Jolly nature enables Palafin-H to outspeed Jolly Mimikyu, Jolly Baxcalibur, and Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Grass Knot</strong>: Grass Knot lets Palafin-H potentially 2HKO physically defensive Dondozo, whose normally a good Palafin-H check.

Substitute has a worse matchup defensive set-up Pokemon, but in exchange it turns Garganacl into an excellent set up opportunity and makes Palafin-H a fearsome sweeper with Toxic Spikes support.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: If using Tera Water, Ice Punch is a reasonable option for hitting Dragon-types, though it does leave Palafin-H walled by Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: While harder to justify than the other support options, Encore does give Palafin-H new chances to set up, punishing slower set-up sweepers like Annihilape in particular.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Unless using Tera Blast, Palafin-H is only pressured to Terastallize to improve certain matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Besides being an excellent defensive typing that punishes Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu for using Dark-type attacks, Tera Fairy gives Palafin-H a great offensive option against Dragon-types like Dragonite and Baxcalibur, as well as coverage against Wo-Chien and Meowscarada with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Boosting Drain Punch's power with Tera Fighting can make Palafin-H even more difficult to take down and can seriously compromise defensive Rotom-W thanks to Taunt or Substitute blocking Will-O-Wisp. However, it does make Palafin-H particularly vulnerable to Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water helps Palafin-H pick off more threats with Jet Punch, having a good shot to OHKO offensive Flutter Mane unboosted after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Besides offering a useful Fairy resistance, Tera Poison lets Palafin-H absorb Toxic Spikes and stop Toxic without a support move, making it a viable alternative.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers takes advantage of Palafin-H's slow setup and is a requirement if using Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove</strong>: If using Taunt, Punching Glove is a good option to free up Leftovers for a teammate. Palafin-H appreciates the extra power Jet Punch and Drain Punch gain, and it becomes harder for Rocky Helmet Dragonite to wear it down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If using Taunt, Covert Cloak turns the tables on the Garganacl matchup in addition to protecting Palafin-H from surprise Light Ball Flings from foes like Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 140 SpD / 116 Spe with Careful</strong>: This spread maximizes Palafin-H's Special Defense while still outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximizing Speed allows Palafin-H to outspeed fast support Pokemon like Mimikyu and Annihilape so it can Taunt them. This spread also outspeeds the rare Choice Specs Hydreigon, which can deal massive damage with Draco Meteor if not using Tera Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 140 Atk / 116 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This is a far more offensive approach to the set, letting Palafin-H function more as a revenge killer with the potential to sweep rather than a bulky setup Pokemon. This is best used with Tera Water, as Palafin-H will then OHKO offensive Flutter Mane with unboosted Jet Punch. The given Speed is for outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> </ul>"

Heavy Slam can 2HKO offensive Dragapult and OHKO offensive Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rest</strong>: Rest gives Orthworm better longevity for stalling out physical threats. It can be run with Chesto Berry, but usually another item is preferable.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shed Tail</strong>: In the early-game when IronPress may not be as effective, Shed Tail gives Orthworm a useful pivot for setting up teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute stops Salt Cure damage from Garganacl and phazing from Garchomp's Dragon Tail.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake can hit Gholdengo, but it won't 2HKO, so Recover is still a problem.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: IronPress sets have a more difficult time fitting it in, but Orthworm can run Stealth Rock if the team can't run it elsewhere.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry helps ensure that Orthworm can still Shed Tail after taking a big hit or, if able to stay healthy, gives it two uses of Shed Tail.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Not only does Rocky Helmet make it even easier to wear down physical attackers, but it makes running Body Press as the only attack much more feasible.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is a consistent option, especially in conjunction with Substitute.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Orthworm's excellent bulk profile give it good setup opportunities, but combining Terastallization with Earth Eater can further augment its defensive capabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison provides a key Fighting-type resistance and a single weakness and maintains a key resistance to Flower Trick, letting Orthworm perform better against Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and Iron Valiant.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy provides a Fighting-type resistance and Dragon-type immunity, turning Dragon Tail Garchomp into setup bait, and dealing with Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish</strong>: Maximum physical bulk is ideal if relying on Orthworm to beat Dragonite and Baxcalibur in the late-game.

This can work on Toxapex, but be warned that Toxapex commonly carries Mental Herb, which could get Annihilape poisoned if it doesn't Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore is an interesting alternative to Taunt, not able to directly shut down defensive answers to Annihilape, but it severely punishes them when Annihilape switches into a support move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: With Vital Spirit, Annihilape can absorb Spore from foes like Breloom, Brute Bonnet, and Amoonguss.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization is quite helpful at saving Annihilape from certain extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Flutter Mane, but Annihilape is perfectly functional without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: In addition to giving a useful resistance to Fairy, Fire, and Ice attacks from dangerous foes like Flutter Mane, Chi-Yu, and Chien-Pao, Tera Fire also prevents Will-O-Wisp from hitting.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel turns Annihilape's Psychic and Fairy weakness into resistances, as well as being an excellent defensive type overall. It lets Annihilape set up freely on Amoonguss and Toxapex, gives it a better chance of defeating Flutter Mane, and resisting Flower Trick means Meowscarada has a much harder time revenge killing it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: While not as sturdy of a defensive typing as Tera Steel, Tera Poison offers a better matchup against Flutter Mane, does well against Meowscarada, and lets Annihilape freely switch into Toxic and Toxic Spikes later in the match. This also drastically reduces the risk of Taunting Toxapex, which makes this Tera type a menace against stall teams!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying helps a lot to avoid Fissure from Dondozo and Ting-Lu, forcing it to attack with moves that boost Rage Fist. It also improves Annihilape's match-up against Great Tusk, and makes Hippowdon an easy foe to set up on.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a good choice against Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Palafin-H.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's residual recovery eases the long-game of setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs</strong>: Reducing the HP EVs to 244 gives Annihilape an even HP stat, which lets Annihilape recover its health with Sitrus Berry the moment it gets hit by Ruination. This makes dealing with Ting-Lu and Wo-Chien an easier task.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak makes Annihilape immune to being Salt Cured, making it a great check against Garganacl. It also gives peace of mind, avoiding potential flinches from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, or Special Defense drops from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove</strong>: Removing contact damage from Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin is helpful against defensive Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximum Speed mainly helps Annihilape outspeed Gholdengo, Great Tusk, Baxcalibur, and Modest Chi-Yu.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Annihilape's good bulk and significant offensive presence makes it an easy to use Stealth Rock setter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rage Fist</strong>: Rage Fist is Annihilape’s strongest move; its power and coverage often lets Annihilape either defeat or significantly chip one of the opponent’s Pokemon on top of getting Stealth Rock up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drain Punch versus Close Combat</strong>: The huge amount of Dark-types in this metagame necessitates a Fighting STAB attack. Drain Punch is preferred in most cases for the extra recovery, but Close Combat makes plenty of sense if using Focus Sash and an offensive EV spread.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt gives Annihilape a strong matchup into bulky walls such as Ting-Lu and opposing setup foes like Volcarona, while also making it easier to boost Rage Fist’s power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Final Gambit</strong>: Annihilape's impressive HP stat makes Final Gambit into a powerful KO trading tool, being able to take out bulky foes like Garganacl, Corviknight, Wo-Chien, and Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb versus Bulldoze</strong>: Rock Tomb is an excellent Speed reducing move for its ability to hit Dragonite, and threaten Volcarona and Iron Bundle. Its low accuracy should be noted as a risk, however. Bulldoze trades hitting Dragonite in exchange for dealing good damage against Gholdengo and Iron Moth.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore is an incredibly powerful move that can lock the opponent into an attacking move to boost Rage Fist's power. Alternatively, it can lock the opponent into a status move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fling and Light Ball</strong>: This gives Annihilape a chance to paralyze a foe, including Gholdengo that lack Covert Cloak, and break potential Focus Sashes too.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curse</strong>: This is an excellent way for Annihilape to retire itself from the battle while putting significant pressure on the opponent to switch out and shutting down gimmicks such as Baton Pass.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This Annihilape is often used quite early in the game to set up Stealth Rock, so Terastallization is often not needed unless it must check a specific threat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel has excellent defensive synergy with Annihilape thanks to the Fairy resistance and doing particularly well on spreads that are faster than -1 Chien-Pao to move before Sacred Sword lands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Beyond offering a valuable Fairy resistance, the Ice and Fire resistances make Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu easier to deal with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Ghost-type attacks are incredibly common. Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and opposing Annihilape all struggle against an unexpected Tera Normal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison has a good matchup against Flutter Mane, and lets Annihilape deal with Toxic and Toxic Spikes without needing to Taunt.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Even when using bulky EV spreads, Focus Sash is useful for surviving an attack from foes that can be difficult to EV for, such as Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry can be used with specialized spreads to avoid certain 2HKOs. Just make sure to have an even HP stat, to ensure that Sitrus Berry activates after getting hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roseli Berry</strong>: Roseli Berry works well on specially defensive EV spreads designed defeat Flutter Mane leads that lack Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: Vital Spirit adds to Annihilape’s reliability as a lead. Immunity to sleep moves from common Pokemon such as Breloom, Brute Bonnet, Dondozo, Hippowdon, and Skeledirge lets Annihilape thrive with more defensive EV spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Defiant</strong>: While Intimidate Pokemon are far from common from the format, Defiant can take advantage opposing Speed control moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Inner Focus</strong>: This niche ability prevents flinches from Chien-Pao and Dragonite from happening.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>172 HP / 4 Atk / 212 Def / 4 SpD / 116 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This Speed drop based spread allows Annihilape to outspeed -1 Iron Bundle and avoids getting 2HKOed by Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: If using Focus Sash and Close Combat together, maximizing Attack and Speed will win the most matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>220 HP / 244 SpD / 44 Spe with Careful</strong>: This Roseli Berry based spread lets Annihilape survive Modest Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball and outspeed -1 Garchomp and 4 Speed EV Tinkaton.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Sitrus Berry EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 180 SpD / 100 Spe with Careful</strong>: This Sitrus Berry optimized EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, while outspeeding Adamant Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 244 Def / 20 Spe with Impish</strong>: This defensive spread is Annihilape's best chance at being a soft check to Chien-Pao, though note that Swords Dance and Terastallization together can still overwhelm Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Flutter Mane's blistering Speed and Special Attack along with its powerful unresisted STAB combination exerts an oppressive amount of pressure on most teams, making it one of the premier offensive Pokemon in the format.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mystical Fire</strong>: Mystical Fire scorches the common Flutter Mane check, Scizor. It also heavily disrupts enemy special attackers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Power Gem</strong>: Power Gem gets a bit of extra damage against Fire-types like Ogerpon-H and Incineroar, which can be relevant when using Tera Stellar.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Calm Mind + Substitute is a classic duo that greatly assists Flutter Mane's setup attempts, allowing it to set up in-front of Thunder Wave Porygon2. Even without Calm Mind, it can save Flutter Mane from devastating uses of Thunder Wave from the likes of Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is hugely disruptive against a variety of support Pokemon, such as Swampert, Ting-Lu, and Porygon2.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Stellar Tera Blast</strong>: With Tera Stellar, Tera Blast can be some good insurance against Pokemon with unpredictable Terastallization options, but the Special Attack drop doesn't gel well with Booster Energy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draining Kiss</strong>: When using extremely bulky Flutter Mane variants, Draining Kiss can be paired with Calm Mind to keep it around much longer. However, Tera Fairy is highly recommended when using this, as Draining Kiss is otherwise very weak.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Flutter Mane's incredible Speed is put to good use, outspeeding almost everything in the metagame with the major exceptions being Booster Energy Iron Bundle and the very rare Choice Scarf Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash patches up Flutter Mane's poor physical bulk, giving it new revenge kill chances.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Flutter Mane benefits from Terastallization, it's generally flexible enough to go without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Flutter Mane boosting all of its offensive moves once gives it good offensive flexibility, especially since it retains the important immunity to Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy makes Moonblast a potent sweeping move, while reducing damage against Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch and Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is handy for giving a resistance to Steel, Ice, and Fire, giving improved matchups against Scizor, Ting-Lu, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: In addition to resisting Bullet Punch, Tera Electric protects Flutter Mane from the dreaded Thunder Wave and Glare!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives Flutter Mane an offensive and defensive edge against Scizor, though the weakness to Urshifu-R's Aqua Jet is quite unwelcome.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p>All of these EV spreads are designed to give Flutter Mane a Speed Boost with Protosynthesis.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 108 Defense / 140 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: The Defense investment usually allows Flutter Mane to survive Sucker Punch from Adamant Chien-Pao. To require Adamant Chien-Pao to get a critical hit to OHKO Flutter Mane with Sucker Punch, an EV spread of 4 HP / 124 Def / 124 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can also be used.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>116 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 132 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Jolly Roaring Moon and survives an opposing Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball without Terastallization. In addition, Life Orb Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak has a fairly low chance of OHKOing, and Iron Bundle fails to KO with the combination of Hydro Pump and Freeze Dry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: If using Focus Sash, this simple spread is best for maximizing Speed and power. Note that this spread's vulnerability to priority makes it a poor fit for Booster Energy variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 252 Def / 20 Spe with Bold</strong>: This extremely defensive spread allows Flutter Mane to survive Tera Dark Life Orb Jolly Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch without needing to Terastallize itself, while still outspeeding Choice Scarf Jolly Landorus-T and Gouging Fire after Booster Energy.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Choice Attacker": {"description": "<ul> <li> <p>This set's write-up has not started yet, but here's some basic info to get you started!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: This spread allows Flutter Mane to usually survive Adamant Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch before Terastallizing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Type</strong>: Tera Fairy gives this set the easiest late game sweeping opportunities, and saves Flutter Mane from powerful Sucker Punches from the likes of Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S.</p> </li> </ul>"},

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>The combination of Charm and Pain Split turns Flutter Mane into a devastating control option, massively crippling opposing offensive threats and healing itself with the combination of Pain Split and Draining Kiss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calm Mind versus coverage</strong>: Calm Mind allows Flutter Mane to maintain its role as a sweeper by increasing its damage output while simultaneously reinforcing its longevity. However, this leaves Flutter Mane quite vulnerable to Steel-types, so Shadow Ball and Mystical Fire are reasonable alternatives.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draining Kiss versus Moonblast</strong>: Moonblast's far superior damage output is a great option versus more defensive teams, while Draining Kiss supplies superior lasting power against more offensive teams and is a great fit for Tera Fairy.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Since this Flutter Mane is trying to defeat unexpected physical threats one-on-one, Terastallization is great at patching up some matchups that Charm can't on its own, even if it's not required for this set to work.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Flutter Mane a very useful resistance to Steel, Ice, and Fire, giving it improved matchups against Scizor, Ting-Lu, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy Further boosts Moonblast's impressive damage output while removing Flutter Mane's Ghost weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric not only gives a useful Bullet Punch resistance against Scizor, but it also prevents common paralysis spreaders like Porygon2, opposing Flutter Mane, Archaludon, and Serperior from crippling Flutter Mane.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>124 HP / 252 Def / 132 Spe with Timid</strong>: The chosen EVs ensure that Flutter Mane will always outspeed Jolly Booster Energy Roaring Moon. Maximum Defense investment gets the most out of Charm with the rest placed into HP.</li> </ul>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With a decent defensive typing in Ground / Steel and good bulk, Iron Treads can run an effective Assault Vest set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head versus Heavy Slam</strong>: While Heavy Slam is not as consistent as Iron Head due to Iron Treads's middling weight, it reaches maximum power against targets such as Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant. Heavy Slam gets an OHKO on Iron Valiant and 2HKOes Iron Bundle, which is something that's not achievable with Iron Head, however, Iron Head 2HKOes Baxcalibur, and does non-negligible damage to Dragonite, which isn't possible with Heavy Slam.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rapid Spin</strong>: It may seem weird to run Rapid Spin on such a fast-paced-format, but with it, Iron Treads can support teammates like Dragonite and Focus Sash Flutter Mane. Additionally, with a Jolly nature and minimal Speed investment Iron Treads can outrun Timid Iron Bundle after a Rapid Spin.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Ice Spinner gives Iron Treads a move to hit Dragonite, Hydreigon, Garchomp, and Great Tusk hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off is Iron Treads's best move against Rotom-W and Rotom-H, and its item removal is valuable all around, crippling both the Pokemon it's supposed to check as well as common switch-ins.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Volt Switch</strong>: Pivoting can help Iron Treads against physically bulky Pokemon like Dondozo, Corviknight, and Terastallized Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: The EV Spread aims to maximize Iron Treads's ability to take special attacks, especially when coupled with an Assault Vest; the Speed allows it to outspeed Jolly Breloom before a Rapid Spin and Timid Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying provides Iron Treads with a Ground immunity and a Fighting resistance, along with neutralizing its Fire weakness, which can be useful against Tera Fire Flutter Mane and Sylveon, Skeledirge, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth.</li> </ul>"

      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Iron Treads possesses an incredible support movepool along with a great base 106 Speed stat, making it a great support option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric Terrain</strong>: A manual Electric Terrain may seem odd, but Iron Treads has the bulk to run it and use it to activate its own Quark Drive along with its teammates' if applicable, and the lack of other Terrains in the current series means Electric Terrain can run for its full duration a lot of times. Electric Terrain also blocks sleep moves from foes such as Skeledirge, Espathra, Iron Valiant, Gengar, Breloom, and Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rapid Spin</strong>: Despite the fast-paced-nature of BSS, Rapid Spin allows Iron Treads to both boost its speed and clear entry hazards from its side of the field, supporting teammates such as Focus Sash Iron Bundle and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Along with its item removal ability, Knock Off is Iron Treads's best move to hit Rotom-W and Rotom-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Ice Spinner allows Iron Treads to hit foes such as Dragonite and Great Tusk hard, but it should be used carefully if it's run alongside Electric Terrain, as it ends the current active Terrain.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam</strong>: With Heavy Slam, Iron Treads can OHKO Iron Valiant, as well as 2HKO Iron Bundle without Tera Steel. After Terastallizing into Steel, Heavy Slam can OHKO Iron Bundle after a Rapid Spin.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Wild Charge</strong>: If Iron Treads is holding a Life Orb, Wild Charge is capable of 2HKOing Corviknight in Electric Terrain.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze</strong>: While weaker than Earthquake, Bulldoze is a speed control option for Iron Treads that affects Ghost-types, unlike Rapid Spin.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground neutralizes Iron Treads's Fire, Ground, and Fighting weaknesses and ramps up the power of its Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel gets rid of Iron Treads's Water weakness and gives it resistances to Ice and Grass.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy increases Iron Treads's speed even further, allowing it to outspeed Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, Dragapult and slower Choice Scarf foes, making it very likely to get a move off first.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Terrain Extender</strong>: Terrain Extender increases the duration of Terrains to eight turns, giving Iron Treads or one of its Quark Drive teammates more turns to make use of their ability.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash is an option for ensuring Iron Treads can get at least one move off against faster foes that can KO it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: An Air Balloon allows Iron Treads to have an edge against other Ground-type leads such as Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: When used alongside Electric Terrain, Life Orb boosts Iron Treads's offensive pressure, and a Terrain-boosted Wild Charge can 2HKO Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul>"

It's especially effective at punishing Sucker Punch revenge killers such as Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Beam</strong>: With a power-boosting item, Ice Beam OHKOes Dragonite through Multiscale, and is a far safer way to OHKO Ursaluna-B that lack Assault Vest.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn</strong>: Pivoting is a big help when Iron Bundle is facing Pokemon likely to Terastallize such as Chi-Yu or Landorus-T, though it doesn't have great synergy with Booster Energy's one-time use.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt will make support Pokemon such as Alolan Ninetales and Ting-Lu want to take a holiday, though watch out for common users of Mental Herb such as Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Whirlpool</strong>: Although difficult to pull off with Iron Bundle's mediocre bulk, trapping foes with Whirlpool can make Encore especially deadly.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric Terrain</strong>: Giving Iron Bundle a Speed boost via Electric Terrain isn't nearly as flexible as Booster Energy, but it does let Iron Bundle support potentially deadly Quark Drive teammates such as Iron Valiant and Iron Hands.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Iron Bundle's perfect coverage and high Speed means its fairly flexible with a team's Terastallization needs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Besides the power boost for Hydro Pump, Tera Water enables a reliable Water-type STAB move in Tera Blast and avoids an OHKO from Choice Scarf Urshifu-R's Close Combat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost gives Iron Bundle an important immunity to Extreme Speed and Quick Attack, which can especially ruin Dragonite, Ogerpon-H's, and Entei's holiday with Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: With Tera Ice, Freeze-Dry will OHKO offensive Dragonite through Multiscale and Ice Beam will OHKO even bulky Dragonite and most Assault Vest Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Quark Drive's Speed boost lets Iron Bundle outpace key Choice Scarf and Booster threats such as Flutter Mane, Urshifu-R, and Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs Iron Bundle regifts support moves so it can wallbreak, with moves such as Tera Water Hydro Pump now OHKOing physically defensive Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Getting around Iron Bundle's iffy bulk makes it a fantastic lead and revenge killer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: While Life Orb compromises Iron Bundle's ability to take priority attacks, it boosts damage without passing on powerful support moves.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Bulkier EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>44 HP / 12 Def / 148 SpA / 52 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: This bulkier spread survives Jolly Chien-Pao's Sacred Sword and Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</li> </ul>"

It can also beat Focus Sash leads, such as Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch gives Iron Hands a good option to hit Dragonite and Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam</strong>: Heavy Slam is Iron Hands's best option to hit Fairy-types, notably OHKOing Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Volt Switch</strong>: Volt Switch, though incredibly weak, can scout switches and maintain offensive momentum.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: While Iron Hands will function without Terastallizing, it'll be needed to handle Choice Specs Flutter Mane, argubly the most dangerous special attacker in the metagame, as well as handle Ground coverage more reasonably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground gives Iron Hands a strong Earthquake and removes most of its common weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass giving Spore immunity can stop Breloom cold if it doesn't Terastallize. The Ground-type resistance also lets Iron Hands square up with Ting-Lu much more effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water's Ice and Fire resistances help a lot against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: A Fairy-type Tera allows Iron Hands to take advantage of its great bulk by giving it a better defensive typing, though previously walled Steel-types like Gholdengo and Magnezone become a lot more threatening.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying lets Iron Hands completely flip its matchup against Ground-types like Garchomp and Great Tusk and dodge Fissure attempts from the likes of Dondozo and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>:Tera Electric elevates Thunder Punch's power to more acceptable levels, makes Wild Charge very difficult to switch into, and removes Iron Hands's weakness to Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting allows Iron Hands to deal more damage with Drain Punch while also removing its weakness to Ground-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel grants a resistance to Fairy and boosts Heavy Slam's power, drastically improving Iron Hands's matchup against Flutter Mane.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 204 SpD / 52 Spe with Adamant</strong>: Because Iron Hands is in a highly contested Speed tier with Azumarill and Kingambit, some Speed investment is very helpful. 52 Speed EVs is a substantial boost to help with this while also jumping above the next Speed tier, outrunning targets like 4 Speed Blissey and Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: Going with a simple spread that maximizes power and special bulk is still a very effective option for Iron Hands.</p> </li> </ul>"

The Attack boost also pairs very well with Drain Punch, keeping Iron Hands healthy and making it much harder to break.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch provides more immediate damage against pure Ground-types and the ever-present Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake hits Gholdengo, Iron Moth, and Tera Fire Chi-Yu hard. It also does well against foes that try to block Drain Punch with Tera Poison.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Despite having a strong bulk profile, Iron Hands frequently needs to remove its common Ground- and Fairy-type weaknesses to be effective.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy removes all of Iron Hands's most troublesome weaknesses while also granting a powerful Dragon-type immunity. This does, however, make Iron Hands much easier to revenge kill with Gholdengo and Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is another solid defensive option that drastically improves the Chi-Yu matchup. Likewise, the resistance to Ice is fantastic against Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur, with the latter no longer being able to rely on Icicle Spear to effectively break through Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting boosts Drain Punch's output while removing Iron Hands's Ground weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire can block Will-O-Wisp from support Dragapult and Rotom formes, which otherwise outspeed and burn Iron Hands if it doesn't already have Substitute up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass can turn the tide against faster Grass-types like Breloom and Wo-Chien, blocking their status moves and buying a free turn to start setting up.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>92 HP / 4 Atk / 172 Def / 212 SpD / 28 Spe with Impish</strong>: The defensive investment keeps uninvested Dondozo's Wave Crash from breaking Iron Hands's Substitute, providing superior protection from Fissure spam. After Terastallizing, non-STAB Earthquake from the likes of Dragonite and Baxcalibur often fails to break Substitute as well.

If using Assault Vest, even Choice Specs Flutter Mane fails to 2HKO with Shadow Ball!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 28 Def / 160 SpA / 180 Spe with Modest</strong>: This Assault Vest based spread avoids a 2HKO from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball, and OHKOes Iron Bundle with Fiery Dance.</p> </li> </ul>"

While Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle are the usual go-to for this, Iron Moth doesn't have to worry about Toxic Spikes or Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Energy Ball</strong>: Energy Ball is the best option for dealing damage to bulky foes like Ting-Lu and Suicune, and it also OHKOes Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: Dazzling Gleam is Iron Moth's ticket to overloading Dragon-types like Garchomp and Roaring Moon, who can otherwise stop a sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes versus Toxic</strong>: This Iron Moth set is arguably the fastest offensive Toxic Spikes setter that makes sense, making it a reasonable option for Toxic Spike loving teammates like Garganacl. Toxic on the other hand, directly puts a timer on common bulky switch-ins like Dragonite and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: While not providing great coverage overall, Psychic is Iron Moth's best move against Toxapex and opposing Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: The given EV Spread ensures Iron Moth gets a Speed boost upon consuming Booster Energy while providing as much protection from priority attacks as possible.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Iron Moth may seem like a strange Pokemon to use as a bulky Toxic spreader, but it sets itself apart from other Pokemon like Toxapex thanks to being far less passive and having access to phazing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fiery Dance</strong>: While Fiery Dance is not a particularly reliable away to sweep, taking the chance is worth it considering Iron Moth's Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes versus Toxic</strong>: Toxic Spikes is the preferred option for its excellent team support for bulky Pokemon like Garganacl, Charm Flutter Mane, and Latias. Toxic on the other hand, lets Iron Moth independently punish bulky responses to it like Ting-Lu and Porygon2.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Whirlwind</strong>: A phazing move may not seemingly gel well with Speed investment, but it has incredible utility when Toxic Spikes are set up, punishing teams that leave their Toxic Spikes absorber in on Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sludge Wave versus Energy Ball</strong>: Giving up on Whirlwind does lose a unique selling point as a Toxic Spikes setter, but in exchange makes Iron Moth much harder to check with Chi-Yu and Primarina. Sludge Wave's damage output makes it the best choice, but Energy Ball stops Swampert from having a field day.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: When the aim is to simply set up Toxic Spikes, Terastallization is not that important. However, Iron Moth's typing gives it enough weaknesses that Terastallization can give it a far longer life span.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Iron Moth a resistance to Water moves without losing its resistance to Ice and Fire, which is helpful against Urshifu-R, Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu. It's also a great type to use with Tera Blast for dealing damage to Chi-Yu and Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass lets Iron Moth deal with powerful Earthquakes from the likes of Ting-Lu and Landorus-T, gives it a vital resistance to Water, and nullifies Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dark resistance can surprise Chien-Pao looking to revenge kill Iron Moth and protects it from powerful Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Choice Band Dragonite and Gouging Fire.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy can be paired with specialized EV spreads to either get easier KOs, gain a Speed boost, or survive surprising special attacks at the cost of the flexibility of more general EV spreads designed to switch in multiple times.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: The quick burst of recovery Sitrus Berry gives can be paired with specialized EV spreads, allowing Iron Moth to survive a wider range of attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak protects Iron Moth from the dreaded Salt Cure, which can otherwise put a timer on phazing. It also prevents specially defensive Iron Moth from losing to Chi-Yu's flinch chance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Black Sludge</strong>: Leftovers's residual recovery pairs well with using Whirlwind as much as possible, but it's a fairly high-value item. Black Sludge is an acceptable alternative, but note that it will hurt Iron Moth after Terastallization if not using Tera Poison.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Booster Energy Exclusive EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 244 Def / 36 SpA / 4 SpD / 36 Spe with Modest</strong>: This Booster Energy optimized spread OHKOes 4 Special Defense EVs Iron Bundle with a Quark Drive-boosted Fiery Dance while having good enough physical bulk to have a good chances of surviving powerful attacks from full health, like Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Psyshock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 220 SpD / 36 Spe with Calm</strong>: This EV spread gives Iron Moth a Special Defense boost with Quark Drive, making it so bulky that even a Modest Choice Specs Chi-Yu has a low chance of 2HKOing it with Dark Pulse!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Sitrus Berry Exclusive EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p>When using Sitrus Berry, make sure to run an even HP stat, so that one use of Ruination will activate it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>180 HP / 228 Def / 100 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread almost always survives two hits from Jolly Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Crunch with Sitrus Berry, and it outspeeds Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 188 Def / 12 SpA / 12 SpD / 52 Spe with Bold</strong>: This EV spread has around a 90% chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Adamant Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Crunch. The minor Special Defense investment also avoids a 2HKO from Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse and Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other EV Spread Examples</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 228 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 36 Spe with Modest</strong>: This EV spread survives Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Psyshock from full health.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 HP / 132 SpD / 180 Spe with Calm</strong>: This EV spread almost always avoids the 2HKO from Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse while outspeeding it alongside Adamant Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 164 SpD / 100 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Jolly Annihilape and, as a bonus, gives Leftovers Iron Moth a nearly guaranteed chance to avoid being 2HKOed by Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse and Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 52 Def / 4 SpA / 12 SpD / 196 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread sacrifices some bulk to outspeed Garchomp while still surviving Life Orb Chien-Pao's Crunch and having a great shot of surviving two uses of Dark Pulse from Timid Chi-Yu. It also gets a Speed boost from Quark Drive.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Benchmarks for Speed EVs</h1> <p>Like many fast bulky Pokemon, Iron Moth has a huge variety of viable EV builds. If you'd like to make your own EV spread though, keep these Speed tiers in mind! Natures that can efficiently use these Speed tiers will be mentioned.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>36 Speed EVs with any Neutral Nature</strong>: This is the minimum amount of Speed to run, outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>52 Speed EVs with any Neutral Nature</strong>: This outspeeds Modest Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>76 Speed EVs with Timid or 180 Speed EVs with Calm</strong> This outspeeds Modest Chi-Yu and Adamant Urshifu formes. Note that Timid will give Iron Moth a bonus point to Speed, but a Calm nature has a greater chance of surviving some special attacks with specific EV spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>132 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This is the minimum investment for Iron Moth to get a Speed boost from Quark Drive, assuming no Special Attack investment, since doing so will increase Special Attack instead.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>156 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Urshifu formes and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also gives Gholdengo its most reliable Tera Blast against Incineroar and Entei.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: With a Flying Tera type, Gholdengo gains an extremely useful immunity to Ground, which is especially useful on Choice Specs sets against Ursaluna-B and Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Make It Rain becomes very powerful with a Tera boost, giving Choice Specs the chance to OHKO several Ursaluna-B variants in particular.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: A Normal Tera type gives Gholdengo the edge against opposing Ghost-types, potentially flipping the table against hard to check sets like Thunder Wave Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a useful way to resist Sucker Punch without being weak to Fairy-type attacks from Flutter Mane, though the weakness to Scizor can be a huge issue for the Choice Scarf set.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: With this, Gholdengo outspeeds key threats such as Urshifu formes, Ogerpon formes, and Chi-Yu. It also outspeeds Chien-Pao and Meowscarada, but beware of Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs make Gholdengo much more difficult to wall, with Make It Rain dealing over 50% to Assault Vest Landorus-T in particular.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: Gholdengo mirror matches are common enough that maximizing Speed is usually a wise idea.

When used with Rocky Helmet, it also makes Gholdengo an effective Choice Scarf Urshifu-R check.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Avoiding Earthquake against foes like Landorus-T makes Tera Flying extremely useful for Gholdengo; this also gives it protection against Fissure from the likes of Dondozo and Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy gives Gholdengo a much better matchup against Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S, who commonly revenge kill Gholdengo otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal is not incredible defensively, but it does let Gholdengo surprise faster Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane and Mimikyu, both of whom despise paralysis.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 236 Def / 20 Spe with Bold</strong>: The given EV spread will outspeed up to paralyzed Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Calm</strong>: This offers Gholdengo the best shot of surviving Ursaluna-B's Earth Power followed by Vacuum Wave after Leftovers recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 84 Def / 172 with Bold</strong>: The Speed investment allows Gholdengo to outspeed Choice Scarf Urshifu formes and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu with the magic of paralysis, which is an especially effective combination when using Tera Water!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet takes advantage of Gholdengo's excellent typing against physical moves, making it a good way to punish contact moves such as Outrage from Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: This is Gholdengo's best shot of outstalling Garganacl, since it grants an immunity to Salt Cure's effect.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is at its best with specially defensive Gholdengo, letting it withstand Ursaluna-B's Earth Power followed by Vacuum Wave without requiring Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Weakness Policy</strong>: While this might seem strange on a defensive Pokemon, Weakness Policy lets Gholdengo beat opposing Gholdengo as long as they lack Choice Specs.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With excellent bulk and a unique array of moves to support it, Wo-Chien stands out as a dangerous user of Leech Seed and a prime Pokemon to stall matches out with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Foul Play versus Knock Off</strong>: Foul Play is Wo-Chien's most consistent offensive move that also happens to punish setup sweepers, while Knock Off's support is especially helpful against Trick users such as Gholdengo and Rotom-W. Note that both are viable together if you're willing to give up a support move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: When paired together with Toxic Spikes, Protect and Substitute makes even foes that should beat Wo-Chien get worn down before they can KO it, such as Chi-Yu. Substitute itself protects Wo-Chien from slow users of Yawn such as Dondozo and Hippowdon, and slow OHKO moves from Ting-Lu, Dondozo, and Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ruination</strong>: Ruination gives Wo-Chien powerful chipping down potential, though it should never be used as Wo-Chien's only attack due to it being extremely difficult to KO with. When paired with Knock Off, it's especially useful against Wo-Chien mirror matches.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: With Stealth Rock support, Giga Drain OHKOes Iron Bundle and almost always 2HKOes Chien-Pao. If you allocate 60 EVs to Special Attack, Giga Drain will OHKO Iron Bundle regardless of Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt does an excellent job of surprising other Taunt Pokemon switching in, such as Annihilape and Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes Partners</strong>: Wo-Chien becomes far more deadly with Toxic Spikes support, letting it quickly wear down a wide variety of foes even faster. Toxapex is one of the best options thanks to its good defensive synergy with Wo-Chien, but other options include Iron Moth, Glimmora, Clodsire, Focus Sash Meowscarada, and the niche Gengar.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Snarl</strong>: Snarl makes fearsome special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu far easier to switch into when Wo-Chien needs to escape, though Wo-Chien will need to have the correct Tera Type to outstall these foes itself.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain</strong>: In addition to providing some extra recovery, Ingrain makes phazers such as Ting-Lu and Hippowdon fail to stop Wo-Chien consistently, though Wo-Chien being trapped is a serious drawback.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Despite Wo-Chien's fantastic bulk, its vulnerability to Toxic Spikes and poor defensive typing mean it must often Terastallize to stall out teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison provides a vital resistance to Fairy and Fighting, and it also lets Wo-Chien absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Besides being a great defensive type, Tera Fairy helps Wo-Chien against Fighting-types that'd normally beat it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water provides Ice and Fire resistances, helpful against Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives useful resistances to Fairy, Fire, and Ice, which help against major threats like Flutter Mane, Baxcalibur, Chi-Yu, and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Wo-Chien's stalling playstyle makes Leftovers the most consistent recovery item.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Big Root</strong>: If another Pokemon desperately needs Leftovers, Big Root is a viable alternative for getting extra recovery from Leech Seed and Giga Drain.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads and Adjustments</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish or Bold</strong>: Maximizing Wo-Chien's physical bulk lets it pull off some incredible stunts, such as avoiding a 3HKO from Breloom's Mach Punch with Leftovers and, after Terastallization, avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Band Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Careful or Calm</strong>: With the correct Tera Type and maximum Special Defense, Wo-Chien can take on Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle much more effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using 60 SpA EVs</strong>: If you're willing to give up a bit of bulk, this investment is required to OHKO Iron Bundle with Giga Drain with either a Bold or a Calm nature.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using 100 Speed EVs</strong>: With some sacrifice to bulk, this Speed investment lets Wo-Chien outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Kingambit, and it can be vital in Wo-Chien mirror matches after Terastallization makes it vulnerable to Leech Seed, due to Substitute blocking Leech Seed.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "RUINOUS ATTACKER": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its high Attack and Speed, and incredible ability in Sword of Ruin, Chien-Pao is one of the strongest physical attackers in the game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Icicle Crash</strong>: While Ice Spinner is perfectly accurate, Icicle Crash’s higher power and flinch chance makes it the preferred attack. Additionally, not being a contact move allows Chien-Pao to avoid unnecessary chip damage from Rocky Helmet users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sucker Punch versus Crunch</strong>: Sucker Punch offers priority with a strong base power at the cost of necessitating prediction, while Crunch is a more standard attack whose Defense drop can allow Chien-Pao to potentially break through bulky foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Shard</strong>: Ice Shard is a more consistent albeit weaker alternative to Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sacred Sword</strong>: Sacred Sword provides coverage for Pokemon that resist one or both of Chien-Pao’s STAB attacks, like Chi-Yu and other Chien-Pao, plus its Chien-Pao's best shot against Porygon2. Additionally, ignoring defense boosts allows Chien-Pao to deal more consistent damage to foes who boost their Defense like Archaludon and Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psychic Fangs</strong>: Psychic Fangs rips up Dual Screens, which makes Focus Sash Chien-Pao's match-up against Alolan Ninetales more favorable. Otherwise, it does good damage to Primarina, Urshifu-R, and Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant gives Chien-Pao a significant power boost for sniping Pokemon with Sucker Punch, but Jolly is important for Speed tying with Flutter Mane and opposing Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>0-1 SpA IV</strong>: If using Tera Blast on Jolly Chien-Pao, make sure to to use a SpA IV that's 0-1. This is because if Flutter Mane uses Charm, any SpA IV that's higher will result in Tera Blast becoming a Special Attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: While it can be difficult to fit and very reliant on Focus Sash, Swords Dance boosts Chien-Pao’s Attack to unwallable levels, making it a very potent sweeper.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lash Out</strong>: Lash Out is a situational but powerful response to Charm Flutter Mane and Breaking Swipe Gouging Fire thanks to the doubled BP on the turn Chien-Pao's Attack is lowered.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sheer Cold</strong>: While it may seem alluring, Sheer Cold is a very risky slot on this set, as its standard attacks already hit most relevant foes. Even if Chien-Pao fails to KO a foe, it will generally leave it within range for a teammate.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Chien-Pao offers power in spades without needing to Terastallize, only needing it on very rare occasions to break past specific walls or dodge priority moves aimed at it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric can be used in tandem with Tera Blast to improve Chien-Pao’s matchup against key threats such as Urshifu-R and Primarina while also making it immune to paralysis.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost doesn’t offer much offensive benefit, but it allows Chien-Pao to dodge Normal-type priority from Dragonite, Ogerpon formes, and Entei, which can be particularly useful if using Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Stellar's one-time boost per attacking type can open up new sweeping opportunities for Chien-Pao, especially for Life Orb sets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass lets Chien-Pao survive Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes, which otherwise threatens to OHKO through Focus Sash. Combined with Tera Blast, Chien-Pao still threatens big damage into Urshifu-R and Primarina.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosts Sucker Punch to extreme power levels while making Crunch exceptionally difficult to switch into without a resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice can allow Chien-Pao to finish foes off with Ice Shard from higher ranges and makes Icicle Crash an even more formidable tool.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Choice Band transforms Chien-Pao into one of the most bloodthirsty wall-breakers in the metagame!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Shard versus Sucker Punch</strong>: Ice Shard is the weaker but more reliable priority move for cleaning late-game. Sucker Punch is one of the most powerful priority moves in the metagame, but falters against support moves like Substitute and Thunder Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sacred Swords versus Psychic Fangs</strong>: Sacred Sword gives Chien-Pao useful coverage against bulky foes like Porygon2 and Archaludon, as well as opposing Chien-Pao. Psychic Fang's coverage is worse, but it hits the important Urshifu-R and Primarina, as well as breaking dual screens.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Chien-Pao is already plenty powerful, Choice Band combined with Tera can elevate 2HKOs to OHKOs on some of the bulkiest walls in the meta. For this reason, Tera can be worth using on Choice Band sets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark turns Choice Band Crunch into a devastating wallbreaker move that few can withstand, OHKOing Max HP Annihilape, Entei, and Scizor if using an Adamant nature. Neutralizing Chien-Pao’s Steel-type weakness also makes it less vulnerable to Scizor’s Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice gives Choice Band Icicle Crash enough power to challenge even physically defensive Ting-Lu, having approximately a 69% chance to OHKO if using an Adamant nature; be warned, however, that Ting-Lu often Terastallizes in front of Chien-Pao, making this inconsistent. The extra power behind Ice Shard is also a welcome boost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy combined with Choice Band Tera Blast handily defeats some of Chien-Pao's less common checks, OHKOing standard variants of Annihilape and Urshifu formes. It also removes several weaknesses, most notably turning Chien-Pao's 4x Fighting-type weakness into a resistance. Make sure to use a Special Attack IV of 0 or 1 to avoid Charm flipping Tera Blast into a Special Attack!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>20 HP / 228 Atk / 12 Def / 60 SpD / 188 Spe Adamant</strong>: This spread allows Chien-Pao to survive all but the highest damage rolls from Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed, and Modest Ursaluna-B's Vacuum Wave. The Speed investment outspeeds Jolly Ogerpon formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe Jolly</strong>: This spread just attempts to speedtie with Flutter Mane and opposing Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Ting-Lu's absurd bulk and excellent support movepool make it the premier Stealth Rock setter in the metagame!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ruination</strong>: Ruination gives Ting-Lu the most consistent option for damage output, without resorting to offensive investment.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: While Ting-Lu's Speed is awful compared to most Taunt users, using Taunt against foes like Urshifu formes on the switch is still useful, plus Ting-Lu can use some specialized Speed EVs to outspeed certain paralyzed threats. Note that while using Taunt against Toxapex can be useful, it is highly likely to run Mental Herb, which risks getting Ting-Lu poisoned.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect with Leftovers is a strong choice when running Ting-Lu with high sustain teammates such as Toxapex, and can keep Ting-Lu's health up when its in risky situations like trapped by Dragonite's Fire Spin.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam</strong>: Heavy Slam deals serious damage to Fairy-types, with Flutter Mane in particular needing a huge amount of defensive investment to avoid being OHKOed by it.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fissure</strong>: Fissure lets Ting-Lu potentially punish passive Pokemon without Substitute, such as Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: Getting Stealth Rock and Spikes together makes Whirlwind a very effective damage dealing tool, in addition to supporting other offensive Pokemon. However, it can be difficult to set up without compromising Ting-Lu's damage output.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Even with Ting-Lu's fantastic bulk, Terastallization greatly increases the amount of Pokemon it can beat one-on-one, such as Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison gives Ting-Lu an important resistance to Fairy and Fighting, and it lets it absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: In addition to a useful Fighting resistance, Tera Fairy helps Ting-Lu against powerful Dragon-types like Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Band Gouging Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: With Tera Water, Ting-Lu has a significantly better matchup against Urshifu-R. The Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu matchups can also benefit, but be mindful of potential Tera Blast coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel retaining a Fighting weakness is unfortunate, but in exchange, Heavy Slam will OHKO even most bulky Flutter Mane, and it gives Ting-Lu a good matchup against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Ting-Lu's lack of reliable recovery usually makes Sitrus Berry the most reliable method of surviving an extra attack. Leftovers is a good alternative if Sitrus Berry is needed somewhere else, and even preferable if running Protect.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: Mental Herb can be used to nullify one use of Taunt or Encore, which Ting-Lu is fairly vulnerable to, at the cost of reducing its lifespan with a lack of any recovery.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spread Information</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Physical Defense versus Special Defense</strong>: Specializing in one defensive stat depends on which threats Ting-Lu needs to handle, with physically defensive variants preforming better against threats like Dragonite and Roaring Moon, and when Terastallized, Chien-Pao, Ogerpon-H, and Urshifu-R. For specially defensive variants, major targets include Gholdengo and Latios, and when Terastallized, Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>HP Stat Adjustments with Sitrus Berry</strong>: When using a Sitrus Berry, running an even HP number is the best option, so Ting-Lu will eat its berry right after being hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 Def / 100 SpD with Impish</strong>: When Terastallized to a neutral typing and holding a Sitrus Berry, Ting-Lu survives up to four Icicle Crashes from Jolly Focus Sash Chien-Pao. It also avoids a 2HKO from Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast even without Terastallizing thanks to Sitrus Berry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 116 Def / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: This Specially Defensive spread withstands even Modest Choice Specs Chi-Yu's Overheat!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Speed Benchmarks With Taunt</h1> <ul> <li> <p>Investing in Speed may seem absurd, but with paralysis support, Ting-Lu can realistically outspeed some major threats!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>60 Speed EVs</strong>: This outspeeds up to paralyzed Jolly Dragonite, which can save Ting-Lu from Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>76 Speed EVs</strong>: This outspeeds up to paralyzed Adamant Urshifu-R, and many variants of Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>92 Speed EVs</strong>: This outspeeds up to paralyzed Modest Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also lets Tera Blast become a powerful STAB move while Chi-Yu is locked into using it, letting it get around the normal limitations of using a Choice item.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is a good response to Urshifu-R and Primarina, and lets Chi-Yu avoid being OHKOed by Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is Chi-Yu's best shot of defeating Roaring Moon and and gives it an important Fighting-type resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost lets Chi-Yu surprise common users of Normal-type priority such as Dragonite, Ogerpon-H, and Entei, with the bonus of blocking Breloom from an easy revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: While Tera Dark is nowhere near as impressive as a boosted Overheat, Dark Pulse has excellent coverage and also removes Chi-Yu's troublesome Stealth Rock weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Getting a Water-type resistance is always useful against Urshifu-R, but the real key for Tera Water is that it helps Chi-Yu in the mirror match-up, especially against Assault Vest Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Scarf patches up Chi-Yu's lukewarm Speed into something usable for revenge killing and also makes bulkier builds easier to use.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs trades revenge killing for terrifying wallbreaking power. With Tera Fire, the heat gets so extreme that even Blissey is 2HKOed by Overheat!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Bulkier EV Spread</h1> <ul> <li><strong>228 HP / 12 Def / 124 SpA / 4 SpD / 140 Spe with Modest</strong>: This is a bulky spread meant for Choice Scarf, outspeeding up to Iron Bundle. The bulk investment survives Breloom's Mach Punch, Mimikyu's Play Rough followed by Shadow Sneak, and has a good shot of surviving Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed. 40 EVs can be moved from Special Attack to Speed to outspeed Dragapult at a serious cost to power.</li> </ul>"

Note that Overheat will out-damage targets like Annihilape though.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: If not using Assault Vest, Will-O-Wisp severely punishes bulky physical threats like Roaring Moon and Dragonite that may switch in and works great with Terastallization to surprise other bulky threats such Ting-Lu.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Chi-Yu has a ton of weaknesses to common attacking types, so while Terastallization isn't needed to function, it can especially help bulkier Chi-Yu check more threats and otherwise focus less on hit-and-run attacking.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Beyond giving Overheat soul-melting damage output, Tera Fire gives Chi-Yu a vital Fairy-type resistance against Flutter Mane and a good shot of OHKOing even bulky Flutter Mane with Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is a huge help against Urshifu-R and Primarina, and can save Chi-Yu from Choice Scarf Landorus-T revenge kills as long as it doesn't use Flying Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy has good synergy with Chi-Yu's former typing, giving it a vital Fighting-type resistance and ensuring Chi-Yu is not walled by Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost is Chi-Yu's best hope against Dragonite and Entei's Extreme Speed, as well as blocking snipes from Ogerpon-H's Quick Attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water works great on Assault Vest Chi-Yu with Tera Blast, ironically turning it into a decent check against other Chi-Yu!

It also avoids a KO from Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak following Play Rough and often survives Tera Normal Dragonite's Choice Band Extreme Speed. If outspeeding the rare Dragapult after Flame Charge is a priority, 40 Special Attack EVs can be moved to Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with Modest or Timid</strong>: When using more offensive items like Life Orb or Focus Sash, going a more offensive route makes Chi-Yu a better late-game sweeper.

If Terastallized, Chi-Yu has a good chance of retaining its Substitute against Salt Cure as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Timid versus Modest</strong>: While this Chi-Yu is more focused on extreme wall-frying than sweeping, Timid is nice for outspeeding Urshifu formes and Annihilape, whom certainly can't handle boosted attacks well.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Chi-Yu's poor defensive typing can make it fairly easy to revenge kill, so having Terastallization free gives Chi-Yu much more KO opportunities beyond cooking slower threats.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire makes Overheat an insane wall-breaking move, with Life Orb threatening to OHKO Blissey after a boost!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost covers Chi-Yu's Fighting-type weakness and helps against Extreme Speed and Quick Attack, making it much harder to stop its sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: With Tera Grass, Chi-Yu can threaten to OHKO Primarina after a boost in addition to resisting Urshifu-R's Aqua Jet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy gives Chi-Yu a helpful Fighting-type resistance and a better match-up against powerful Dragon-types like Dragonite and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: With Nasty Plot and Life Orb, Tera Dark Chi-Yu is capable of OHKOing even the most specially defensive Annihilape with Dark Pulse!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water lets Chi-Yu deal with opposing Chi-Yu more comfortably.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash makes setting up Nasty Plot much easier, at the cost of power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: While it makes Chi-Yu even more vulnerable to priority moves, Life Orb is otherwise an excellent wallbreaking item, notably giving Chi-Yu a better matchup against stall teams.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>24 HP / 12 Def / 220 SpA / 252 Spe with Timid or Modest</strong>: If using Substitute, this spread prevents Garganacl with 4 Attack EVs from breaking a Terastallized Chi-Yu's Substitute with Salt Cure.

However, Spirit Break's Special Attack drops give Iron Valiant a chance to help teammates set up after it gets KOed, and it will still put Terastallized offensive Flutter Mane into Shadow Sneak's KO range.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: This is Iron Valiant's only way to 2HKO offensive Gholdengo, and removing items gives it a good support niche.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Since this Iron Valiant often uses Destiny Bond, Terastallization isn't very important for it, thought the surprise value still makes it viable in certain matches.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost lets Iron Valiant safely Encore Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: An extra powerful Close Combat gives Iron Valiant better late-game cleaning potential.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Getting around Iron Valiant's aluminum-thin bulk gives it the potential to take down multiple Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Getting a one-time Speed boost trades Iron Valiant's great early-game potential for excellent revenge killing potential.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spread</h1> <ul> <li><strong>12 HP / 228 Atk / 84 Def / 36 SpAtk / 148 Spe with Naive</strong>: This Focus Sash EV spread gives Iron Valiant a very high chance of surviving Adamant Baxcalibur's five-hit Icicle Spear and likely OHKOing it back with Close Combat.

However, Aura Sphere does hit many physically defensive foes such as Corviknight harder, and it gets around Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This set's focus on Destiny Bond makes Terastallization a waste fairly often, but it can make sense in more late-game contexts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost gives Iron Valiant an opening to Encore Extreme Speed Dragonite and gives Shadow Sneak a more acceptable amount of power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's boost to Moonblast potentially gains a 2HKO on Dondozo and Terastallized Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: With Tera Steel, Iron Valiant gains a useful resistance to Bullet Punch and Ice Shard, making Booster Energy variants harder to revenge kill.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash is particularly useful for letting Iron Valiant surprise Skeledirge, who normally OHKOes with a +1 Torch Song.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: While unlikely to enable a sweep unless it's late-game, this consumable Speed boost transforms Iron Valiant into an effective revenge killer.</p> </li> </ul>"

Spirit Break's low Base Power reduces Iron Valiant's general sweeping potential in exchange for dealing big damage to common Tera Fairy Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Sneak versus Knock Off</strong>: With a boost, Shadow Sneak is capable of ruining Flutter Mane's attempt to revenge kill, but Knock Off lets Iron Valiant deal with Gholdengo, hit Volcarona and Iron Moth hard, and punish Skeledirge switch ins.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: While this set isn't reliant on Terastallization, it does make late-game sweeping a much more feasible task for Iron Valiant, making it less vulnerable to priority attacks that can ruin its sweeping potential.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Powering up Shadow Sneak can make cleaning easier and the Extreme Speed immunity can turn Extreme Speed Dragonite into setup bait with Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel has excellent defensive synergy, giving Iron Valiant an important Bullet Punch and Ice Shard resistance and covering Flying- and Fairy-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy / Fighting</strong>: Terastallizing into one of Iron Valiant's STAB types can make cleaning through bulky foes easier if dropping coverage for Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: In addition to a useful Bullet Punch resistance, Tera Fire gifts Iron Valiant a burn immunity and can even be used with Tera Blast to break defensive Gholdengo and Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Not only does this help Iron Valiant against Scizor, but Tera Electric can be paired with Life Orb and Tera Blast to wear down Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: If not using Encore, this is the most reliable way to get Swords Dance set up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Quark Drive's Speed boost makes it far more difficult to revenge kill Iron Valiant, outpacing key threats such as Dragapult, Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb makes Iron Valiant more effective at hit-and-run tactics and can let it OHKO bulky threats such as Corviknight after a boost and Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> </ul>"
