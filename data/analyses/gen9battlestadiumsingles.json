It also gets around priority attacks from Breloom, Dragapult, and Meowscarada after a Shell Smash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Blast: This is Closyer's best shot at dealing with the many Tera Fires that resist Icicle Spear, as well as OHKOing Chien-Pao, Iron Bundle, and Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drill Run: This hits Gholdengo and other Steel-types hard without needing to Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly: Adamant is the preferred nature to maximize offensive power, as a single Shell Smash lets you outspeed the entire unboosted metagame.

It also provides coverage against Gholdengo with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice: The increased damage from Tera Ice makes it very difficult for Pokemon to wall Cloyster without resisting it, with even Corviknight getting OHKOed by +2 Adamant Icicle Spear after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground: Volt Switch users like Rotom-W love to take Cloyster down to its Sash and pivot to a priority attacker; Tera Ground both immunes the damage and prevents the switch, giving Cloyster significant momentum with a free turn to Shell Smash.

Ting-Lu and Garchomp stand out for being particularly bulky options that can even set up Spikes, but other options include Annihilape, Clodsire, Landorus-T, and Kleavor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Iron Head: Earthquake is the most wide-reaching coverage move, ensuring good damage against Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra. Iron Head is worth considering as it prevents Dragonite from being walled by Tera Fairy Rotom-W and has good damage output against Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute versus Encore: Substitute is a fantastic option against Pokemon with status moves that threaten Dragonite's phazing cycles, such as Garganacl, Wo-Chien, and Clodsire. Encore won't do as well against these threats but does punish opposing foes carrying Substitute that can be a problem for Dragon Tail along with slower foes that use status moves in general such as Dondozo and Ursaluna. Encore can even be used over extra coverage if teammates can deal with Fairy-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Extreme Speed versus Aqua Jet: Extreme Speed's ability to pick off threats is useful, even on defensive variants of this set.

The boost to Aqua Jet can also be helpful for picking off threats, though it won't be as powerful as Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal isn't that incredible defensively, but it can be worth it for boosting Extreme Speed's power, letting offensive EV spreads 2HKO Chien-Pao with it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a niche option that lets Dragonite absorb Toxic Spikes and gain a Toxic immunity without being weak to Fighting- and Fire-type attacks like Tera Steel is.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is a high value item, but it's worth using on Dragonite if using Substitute, as it gives Dragonite a serious chance of passively gaining Multiscale's effect back.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet allows Dragonite to play more passively, punishing Pokemon that rely on contact moves like Choice Item Urshifu-R and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots' Stealth Rock immunity makes Multiscale more flexible, especially if Dragon Tail brings in a threat Dragonite isn't equipped to handle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: With Dragonite often moving last with Dragon Tail, it's especially vulnerable to Spore from Breloom, Amoonguss, and Brute Bonnet, so Safety Goggles can be a good pick if Substitute isn't a good fit.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 Def / 100 Spe with Impish: This spread outspeeds Jolly Ursaluna, who while not common, can seriously threaten to blast past Dragonite with Facade.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 Def / 180 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread gives up quite a bit of bulk in exchange for outspeeding Adamant Breloom, while still often mantaining a Substitute against Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 124 Atk / 108 Def / 4 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is optimized for use with Earthquake and Aqua Jet, allowing Dragonite to 2HKO 4 Defense Flutter Mane with that combination of moves without needing to Terastallize. Only Modest Tera Fairy Flutter Mane will have a chance to OHKO through Multiscale.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is a far more offensive approach, mainly for use with Extreme Speed to pick off threats more effectively.</p> </li> </ul> "

Trapping an Encore locked Pokemon in the field is also highly valuable. Fire Spin is used instead of Wrap because it affects Ghost-types and doesn't trigger chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Waterfall</strong>: Earthquake prevents Dragonite from being entirely passive against Heatran, Flutter Mane, and Clodsire.

This also retains its advantage against Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel massively improves Dragonite's matchups against Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, at the cost of being even more vulnerable to Salt Cure and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water: Tera Water adds a resistance to Ice without losing Dragonite's innate Fire-type resistance, which is helpful against Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison: The niche Tera Poison gives Dragonite a way to remove its common weaknesses without being vulnerable to Toxic Spikes, while still resisting Fighting unlike Tera Steel.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>252 HP / 156 Def / 100 Spe with Impish</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Jolly Ursaluna, who can threaten to wallbreak Dragonite before it can Encore Earthquake or Headlong Rush otherwise.</li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Heavy-Duty Boots</strong> Generally, Leftovers preserves Dragonite’'s longevity best, as it cancels out the damage from Sandstorm and makes timer stall easier. However, the increased usage of entry hazard setters in response to Dragonite makes Heavy-Duty Boots a strong option. </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet makes it easier for Dragonite to defeat Pokemon such as opposing Dragonite, Kingambit, and Meowscarada, and its residual damage can be used to execute a win condition.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak: With Covert Cloak, this Dragonite becomes a very effective check to Garganacl, in addition to no longer being vulnerable to flinches from Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash while Terastallizing.</p> </li> </ul> "

Multiscale allows Dragonite to paralyze its foes relatively safely, becoming a massive nuisance for unprepared opponents.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Slash vs. Iron Head</strong>: Air Slash is a more practical move for this set, as it can cover a wider range of Pokemon for at least neutral damage. Air Slash also does not trigger Rocky Helmet and is naturally boosted by Dragonite's STAB. The Iron Head variant of Paraflinch, however, gives Dragonite an easier time against a number of common threats such as Flutter Mane, at the cost of only defeating Heatran that are Terastallized.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore vs. Substitute: Encore will allow Dragonite to effectively check a wider variety of Pokemon such as Ursaluna by locking them into an unfavorable move, giving it a free opportunity to land Thunder Wave on your opponent's switch-in on the following turn.

The Speed boost also comes in handy considering how crowded Scizor's Speed tier is.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / Low: Terastallization works very well at shutting down common methods of revenge killing or walling Scizor, but its typing is good enough to function without Terastallization. If using U-turn, Scizor can focus on pivoting in some matches, making Terastallization even less needed. </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water lets Scizor ambush Chi-Yu, Iron Bundle, and Heatran with a resistance and is especially handy against Fire-types when using Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel: Boosting Bullet Punch is Scizor's best ticket for revenge killing and late-game sweeping, and it retains its Flying-type resistance into powerful Tera Flying Choice Band users like Dragonite and Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark: Tera Dark can cushion Shadow Ball from Gholdengo and Flutter Mane, giving it an extra turn to set up or hit back with Tera-boosted Thief.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric is Scizor's best shot of breaking past Toxapex and Urshifu-R with Tera Blast, and it does good chip damage to Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs: Sitrus Berry trades late-game sweeping power for new setup opportunities, such as avoiding a 2HKO from Modest Gholdengo that lack Choice Specs and a good chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Timid Rotom-W's Hydro Pump. It also has good synergy with Thief, allowing Scizor to steal important items such as Leftovers from Dondozo. Make sure to run 244 Speed EVs to gain an even HP number, letting Sitrus activate after getting hit by Ruination once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Best used with U-turn, Rocky Helmet transforms this Scizor into a good bulky pivot that has the surprising option to sweep late-game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: While Life Orb does compromise Scizor's bulk, it's worth it for being able to OHKO Iron Bundle with a boosted Bullet Punch, and has a good shot of OHKOing physically defensive Ting-Lu with a boosted Close Combat as well.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 28 Atk / 204 Def / 20 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This bulky spread avoids the OHKO from Adamant Tera Ghost Life Orb Mimikyu's +2 Shadow Claw.

It also avoids a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast. With Sitrus Berry, Modest Gholdengo's Shadow Ball is also no longer a 2HKO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 124 Atk / 156 SpD with Adamant</strong>: This Sitrus Berry optimized spread avoids a 2HKO from Jolly Chien-Pao's Crunch, Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, and Modest Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: This defensive spread is best used with U-turn and Rocky Helmet, making Scizor function more like a bulky pivot that can sweep late-game.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Slow U-turn</strong>: When running U-turn, Scizor can drop the Speed investment from any spread and run a Speed IV of 27 to underspeed opposing Scizor and the rare Chesnaught.</li> </ul> "

Tera Steel also softens Scizor's weakness to Fire, letting it avoid the OHKO from attacks like Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water turns its Fire weakness into a resistance, giving Scizor a fighting chance against dangerous Fire-types such as Heatran and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark: Tera Dark works as a single turn surprise to soften Ghost-type attacks from the likes of Flutter Mane and Gholdengo.

It also maintains enough Attack investment to always OHKO uninvested Chien-Pao after Stealth Rock chip.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: Defensive Scizor might seem strange, but when paired with Rocky Helmet, it becomes an effective pivot that can survive extreme attacks: it avoids the OHKO from Choice Band Tera Dark Chien-Pao's Crunch as well as the 2HKO from Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake. Just note that this will make Scizor focus more on pivoting than revenge killing with Bullet Punch.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Minor Optimizations</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Slow U-turn</strong>: Scizor already has a very slow U-turn, but Scizor can drop the Speed investment from any spread and run a Speed IV of 27 to underspeed opposing Scizor and the rare Chesnaught.</li> </ul> "

However, do note that this set is very susceptible to Taunt and Encore, which can make it difficult to even select Breloom in the team preview phase.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect: Protect gives Breloom an opportunity to scout out its opponents and further stall them out once Leech Seed has been set up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Timer Stalling</strong>: If you obtain a numerical advantage early in the match, you can utilize Breloom to win on timer. This is particularly effective since the Leech Seed damage happens after recovery from Leftovers and Poison Heal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze</strong>: Bulldoze allows Breloom to further support its teammates and threaten Gholdengo, which likes to absorb status moves. Do be wary that many Gholdengo are Tera Flying, which can render Breloom ineffective versus it.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic can be difficult to fit into the set, but it allows Breloom to punish Tera Grass foes that attempt to circumvent Breloom's Spore and Leech Seed.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High: While Breloom's typing does have some useful resistances, its low bulk means more favorable resistances granted by Terastallization can be key to setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: This defensive Tera type allows Breloom to resist Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear and Skeledirge's Torch Song, both of which are threats to Substitute.

Feint is used mostly for winning Focus Sash duels against Chien-Pao's Ice Shard and Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Night Slash versus Knock Off: Night Slash's consistent power is best for pure offense, potentially 2HKOing targets like Bold Gholdengo, assuming they can't stall with Recover and Rocky Helmet.

It also provides a useful Freeze-Dry resistance against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: Tera Fairy guards against fearsome powerful Dark, Dragon, and Fighting attacks that Rotom-W can have trouble handling and lets it use Tera Blast to hit Dragonite and Chien-Pao hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost offers Rotom-W a vast array of immunities with Levitate, enabling it to defeat certain Dragonite sets and do much better against Iron Hands and Iron Valiant when Rotom-W lacks Will-O-Wisp.

Shelter is still a viable, albeit strictly inferior, option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Female Gender</strong>: While very rare, Heavy Slam being a contact move means Hisuian Goodra does risk of activating Enamorus's Cute Charm, making a female gender a marginally better choice.</p> </li> </ul> "

This makes Icicle Crash the more consistent option for overall damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Support Partners</strong>: Even though Avalugg stops foes such as Dondozo from using Fissure, it lacks the power to cleanly beat these targets on its own. Common stall teammates such as Toxapex and Clodsire can bring Toxic or Toxic Spikes to spread status, allowing Avalugg to simply stall while poison wears down the opposition.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread: Full investment into HP and Defense give Avalugg insane physical bulk.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With the rise of powerful defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Dragonite, Toxapex stands out as a masterful spreader of poison to support its teammates!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic: Toxic is the most reliable way to spread the deadliest version of poison and is especially effective against Taunt users like Annihilape if using Mental Herb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes: Toxic Spikes makes the team less reliant on Toxapex to spread status directly, and acts as excellent support for stalling teammates like Ting-Lu, Dragonite and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Haze: Even with Toxapex's great bulk, powerful setup sweepers like Chien-Pao and Dragonite quickly get out of control for it, so Haze is the best solution to prevent Toxapex from being setup bait.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Liquidation versus Chilling Water: Liqudation isn't particularly strong but it allows Toxapex to 2HKO Chi-Yu and is the best option for breaking Substitute against targets like Flutter Mane. Chilling Water with a Bold or Impish nature gives Toxapex another tool against physical sweepers, but makes it much more vulnerable to Substitute in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Baneful Bunker: If using Black Sludge or Leftovers, Baneful Bunker is a fantastic way to spread poison against physical attackers and get some extra recovery with one moveslot, but keep in mind that this won't work against Urshifu-R. It's also key for scouting dangerous uses of Trick from the likes of Gholdengo and Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Physically Defensive versus Specially Defensive: Physically defensive Toxapex does well against some hard-to-check threats, such as Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao. Specially defensive Toxapex, on the other hand, has a better shot of beating Heatran and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Infestation</strong>: Infestation is Toxapex's best chance of doing chip damage to Toxic-immune threats, such as Corviknignt and Gholdengo, and the trapping works fairly well against foes that do have problems with Toxic. It also prevents double switching from being an issue for Toxapex.</li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low: While Terastallization can help Toxapex beat a new set of threats, its bulk and good defensive typing usually makes it a rare occurrence compared to its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Besides making Toxapex far less vulnerable to Electric, which some foes like Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur may Terastallize into, Tera Poison retains the ability to restore health with Black Sludge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: Tera Fairy removes all of Toxapex's weaknesses and can save it from taking massive damage from Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse. It also does well against powerful Dragon-type attacks such as Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage and Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass: Tera Grass can prevent Breloom and Amoonguss from being disastrous with Spore, in addition to doing well against Rotom-W. It also gives an important Ground-type resistance against targets such as Ting-Lu and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal: While Normal isn't an impressive defensive type, Tera Normal can punish Choice locked Ghost-types, such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: While the Stealth Rock weakness can be an issue, Tera Bug is a niche way to resist Ground-type attacks while being neutral to both Ice- and Electric-type moves, unlike other methods.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying not only protects Toxapex from its irritating Ground-type weakness but also means bulky users of Fissure, such as Dondozo and Ting-Lu, will no longer pressure Toxapex. However, this typing makes Toxapex much worse into general offense.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Black Sludge versus Leftovers: Having passive healing is wonderful, especially with Baneful Bunker. Black Sludge is a clever way to get around Item Clause, but Leftovers gives Toxapex more freedom in choosing its Tera type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: While Urshifu-R often has contact protection, other physical attackers such as Chien-Pao can be gradually worn down through Rocky Helmet chip.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: With Mental Herb providing one-time protection from Taunt, Toxapex can surprise foes like Annihilape and Ting-Lu with Toxic, which is especially helpful if not running an attack.</p> </li> </ul> "

It also provides a neutral typing for the inevitable Shadow Balls that will be thrown at Skeledirge, like from Flutter Mane or Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal: While Tera Normal isn't fantastic defensively, it lets Skeledirge severely punish attempts from special attacking Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo to check it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: A Water Tera type lets Skeledirge take on opposing Water attacks, providing a valuable turn to burn foes like Azumarill and Palafin-H. It should be noted that Tera Water tends to be a safer option versus the common Gholdengo, as it does not often run Thunderbolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire: Despite the defensive nature of this set, Tera Fire's increased power for Torch Song is welcome, and it still helps Skeledirge against Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Sitrus Berry</strong>: Residual recovery helps Skeledirge use Torch Song more freely. Leftovers is the best option since Skeledirge has instant recovery, but Sitrus Berry with an even HP stat can be used to restore some health after getting hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak ignores the secondary effects of Salt Cure and Acid Spray, improving Skeledirge's match-up against Garganacl, Iron Moth, and Bellibolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Safety Goggles: The immunity to Spore Skeledirge gains lets it check Breloom, Amoonguss, and Brute Bonnet far more effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots: This makes Skeledirge less pressured to Terastallize to rid itself of its Stealth Rock weakness.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>220 HP / 76 Def / 212 SpD with Bold</strong>: This EV spread allows both Tera Fairy and Water Skeledirge to avoid a 2HKO from a plethora of offensive threats, such as Focus Sash Chien-Pao, Modest Gholdengo, Adamant Azumarill, and Choice Specs Dragapult, while still boasting significant physical bulk.</li> </ul> "

Grassy Terrain also halving Earthquake’s power is greatly appreciated by bulky teammates like Skeledirge, Arcanine, and Iron Hands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam: This move keeps Arboliva from becoming setup bait against foes like offensive Dragonite, and is also your best move into Wo-Chien before Tera.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast: Tera Blast is a great option for hitting types that Arboliva lacks natural coverage for. Tera Fire lets Arboliva hit Steel-types like Scizor and Tera Electric punishes Tera Flying users like Gholdengo. Both Tera Fire and Tera Electric cover Corviknight as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Coat: This set’s massive special bulk can make getting one-shots with Mirror Coat awkward, but it is still a great option, particularly against boosted or super effective hits. Bear in mind though that this won’t work against Chi-Yu as long as it keeps its Dark typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leaf Storm: Leaf Storm trades consistency for a single turn of high burst damage and can be worth it if investing in Special Attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Arboliva’s raw special stats make it capable of tanking super effective hits without using Tera.

Notably, it flips several weaknesses, blocks Toxic, and allows for absorbing Toxic Spikes later in the match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric: Tera Electric is Gholdengo's worst nightmare.

On top of that, Arboliva still hits Corviknight very hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is another great defensive option for neutralizing most of Arboliva's weaknesses, and the extra power behind Dazzling Gleam can make it easier to break defensive Dragonite variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass removes Arboliva’s Fighting weakness while maintaining Spore immunity, letting it check Breloom. If both Tera and Grassy Terrain are active, Modest Giga Drain can even 2HKO Breloom!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground: While not as strong defensively, invested Tera Earth Power can OHKO uninvested Chi-Yu and Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 4 Def / 140 SpA / 124 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread balances bulk and power, avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Specs Gholdengo's Make It Rain and almost always surviving Modest Chi-Yu’s Fire Blast before Tera! If running Tera Ground, there are enough Special Attack EV’s to turn Earth Power into an OHKO against uninvested Chi-Yu and Gholdengo.

If Grassy Terrain is present, fully invested Leaf Storm has a 75% chance of OHKOing 4 Special Defense Garchomp. The bulk investment lets Arboliva always avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire after Grassy Terrain recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 20 SpD / 252 Spe with Modest: While maximum Speed investment may seem a bit strange, it can be worth it when running Tera Fire Tera Blast to get the jump on Scizor, Corviknight and the rare Timid Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 4 Def / 148 SpA / 20 SpD / 100 Spe with Modest: This alternative Speed spread gives Arboliva a nice boost in Special Attack while still letting it outrun 4 Speed Azumarill.

By changing its typing to a more defense oriented one, while maintaining the Fire immunity thanks to Flash Fire, Ceruledge can set up Bulk Ups on a variety of common Pokemon, ranging from Corviknight, Kingambit, Azumarill and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt lets Ceruledge set up Bulk Up without needing to fear common phasing moves (with the exception of attacking moves such as Dragon Tail), as well as opposing setup moves such opposing Bulk Up and Iron Defense, provided you outspeed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Sneak</strong> Priority of some form is always nice to have on a Pokemon, which makes Shadow Sneak an easy contender for the last move. Gaining extra added strength against Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Dragapult and Annihilape is certainly charming.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass Tera Blast: This allows Ceruledge to eliminate Dondozo more quickly. While Taunt can shut down Dondozo's Yawn, it cannot shut down Fissure. The only way to beat Dondozo would be to eliminate it as quickly as possibly, which Grass Tera Blast aids with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flame Charge: Flame Charge provides Ceruledge an extra net of safety against potential Scarf users and Annihilape, who are capable of turning the tides against it. While normally, Ceruledge is prone to faster Taunt + Bulk Up users and Scarfed Trick, Flame Charge helps mitigate both of those weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Ceruledge can be a status spreader in games where it can't set up as easily. It also helps Ceruledge set up more easily against threats such as Unaware Clodsire.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: Tera Fairy helps Ceruledge's matchup against prominent Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass: An immunity to Spore and a resistance to Water makes Grass the most notable Tera type for this set. Flash Fire eliminating one of Grass's many weaknesses is also noteworthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Increasing Bitter Blade's power will always be a valuable trait. Eliminating Ghost's weaknesses to Ghost and Dark also allows Ceruledge to set up more comfortably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Tera Bug is similar to Tera Grass, but in exchange for losing the Water resistance and maintaining the Rock weakness of Fire / Ghost, Ceruledge can tank Volcarona's Bug Buzz with significantly more ease.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def with Impish: Investing into Defense prepares Ceruledge and its mediocre physical bulk for the physical-biased metagame.

Being faster, more often than not, lets Ceruledge win these matchups with ease.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: While most threats in the metagame at the moment are physical, a specially defensive spread is still noteworthy for its ability to surprise Hydreigon.</p> </li> </ul> "

If Ceruledge is brought down to 1 HP, a +2 Bitter Blade can heal it to the point that it can tank an extra attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Shadow Claw</strong>: Close Combat hits the Normal-, Dark-, and Rock-types that resist Ceruledge's STAB combination. Still, Shadow Claw is a noteworthy choice to guarantee the KO on Mimikyu and let Ceruledge pressure Skeledirge. Note, however, that maximum Defense Skeledirge can recover more than Shadow Claw's damage, barring critical hits, and a Terastallized Skeledirge can completely wall this set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance versus Destiny Bond: As powerful as Swords Dance boosted attacks from Ceruledge are, the abundance of Unaware Pokemon, primarily Dondozo, has made some players opt to use Destiny Bond to snag surprise kills. Destiny Bond can also make the matchup against KOing common Sucker Punch Pokemon, such as Meowscarada and Kingambit, easier to win without having to rely on predictions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly: Adamant's added damage output is valuable, but Jolly allows Ceruledge to outspeed non-Scarf Gholdengo, and gives it a chance at outspeeding Modest Rotom formes and Glimmora. All of the mentioned examples are Special Attackers, meaning Ceruledge's Weak Armor often does not trigger in these matchups.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire: Giving Bitter Blade an extra push in damage is quite useful, giving Ceruledge more recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Normal is an exceedingly common Tera Type on Ghost types due to the immunity it brings to the table.

Note, however, that Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers's animation make Scovillain very vulnerable to losing via timer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: With enough Moody boosts, Scovillain's Flamethrower tends to be enough to break through an entire team. There are very few Pokemon that are immune or quadruply resistant to Fire, and Flamethrower has good PP and accuracy, which makes it an easy pick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: Unlike Flamethrower, Giga Drain gets shrugged off by a lot of Pokemon, even at +6, notably Corviknight and Dragonite. However, an attacking move that helps recover HP lost from Substitutes gives Scovillain more mileage off of Moody. Giga Drain is also notable to more reliably defeat Dondozo, one of the Unaware Pokemon that would give Scovillain a lot of trouble otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leech Seed: Leech Seed combined with Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers helps Scovillain restore HP while collecting Moody boosts, as well as chipping Pokemon it'd otherwise have trouble against, such as Clodsire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain: Ingrain is an alternative recovery option that makes Scovillain impervious to phazing moves. When purely considering recovery, it's more reliable than the inaccurate 90% accurate Leech Seed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast with Tera Fairy is an excellent option that helps remedy Scovillain's Dragon susceptibility, particularly making the Infiltrator Dragapult and Roaring Moon matchup easier.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Water: The Water resistance helps Scovillain beat Dondozo. Even though Dondozo ignores Scovillain's Defense boosts via Unaware, with Tera Water, Scovillain's Substitute can tank a Wave Crash. Tera Water also keeps the Scovillain's Steel resistance, unlike Tera Grass, which makes it easier to check Scizor—a common priority user that people attempt to use to check Moody Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: Tera Fairy mitigating Scovillain's weakness to Dragon-types is massively helpful.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li><strong>180 HP / 220 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 100 Spe with Bold</strong>: This spread bolsters Scovillain’s physical bulk. Notably, Tera Water Scovillain's Substitute manages to survive Dondozo's Wave Crash with this spread. The Speed allows Scovillain to outspeed slow Baxcalibur and Gholdengo, as well as Dragapult with one Moody Speed boost. The HP is adjusted to make maximum use of Leftovers, with the resulting stat having a remainder of 1 when divided by 16. The remaining EVs are split between Special Attack and Special Defense because, at level 50, investing 8 EVs in either stat has no benefit over investing 4.</li> </ul> "

This can work on Toxapex, but be warned that Toxapex commonly carries Mental Herb, which could get Annihilape poisoned if it doesn't Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore: Encore is an interesting alternative to Taunt, not able to directly shut down defensive answers to Annihilape, but it severely punishes them when Annihilape switches into a support move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: With Vital Spirit, Annihilape can absorb Spore from foes like Breloom, Brute Bonnet, and Amoonguss.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium: Terastallization is quite helpful at saving Annihilape from certain extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Flutter Mane, but Annihilape is perfectly functional without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire: In addition to giving a useful resistance to Fairy, Fire, and Ice attacks from dangerous foes like Flutter Mane, Chi-Yu, and Chien-Pao, Tera Fire also prevents Will-O-Wisp from hitting.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel turns Annihilape's Psychic and Fairy weakness into resistances, as well as being an excellent defensive type overall. It lets Annihilape set up freely on Amoonguss and Toxapex, gives it a better chance of defeating Flutter Mane, and resisting Flower Trick means Meowscarada has a much harder time revenge killing it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison: While not as sturdy of a defensive typing as Tera Steel, Tera Poison offers a better matchup against Flutter Mane, does well against Meowscarada, and lets Annihilape freely switch into Toxic and Toxic Spikes later in the match. This also drastically reduces the risk of Taunting Toxapex, which makes this Tera type a menace against stall teams!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying helps a lot to avoid Fissure from Dondozo and Ting-Lu, forcing it to attack with moves that boost Rage Fist. It also improves Annihilape's match-up against Great Tusk, and makes Hippowdon an easy foe to set up on.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water: Tera Water is a good choice against Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Palafin-H.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers: Leftovers's residual recovery eases the long-game of setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs</strong>: Reducing the HP EVs to 244 gives Annihilape an even HP stat, which lets Annihilape recover its health with Sitrus Berry the moment it gets hit by Ruination. This makes dealing with Ting-Lu and Wo-Chien an easier task.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak: Covert Cloak makes Annihilape immune to being Salt Cured, making it a great check against Garganacl. It also gives peace of mind, avoiding potential flinches from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, or Special Defense drops from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove: Removing contact damage from Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin is helpful against defensive Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly: Maximum Speed mainly helps Annihilape outspeed Gholdengo, Great Tusk, Baxcalibur, and Modest Chi-Yu. With Bulk Up and Rage Fist improving its offense, Annihilape can invest in HP over Attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 244 SpD / 12 Spe with Careful: More special bulk can make it much more difficult for special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu to revenge kill Annihilape. This spread in particular has a 62.5% chance of surviving Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 164 Def / 100 SpD with Careful</strong>: This EV spread avoids a OHKO from +2 Chien-Pao, which can be especially helpful with Covert Cloak blocking the flinch chance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 SpD / 100 Spe with Careful</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom and Cloyster while still giving Annihilape good special bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 196 Def / 60 Spe with Impish: This physically defensive spread will survive Tera Flying Adamant Dragonite's Tera Blast, while outspeeding 4 Speed EV Mimikyu and Jolly Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> </ul> "

Drain Punch is preferred in most cases for the extra recovery, but Close Combat makes plenty of sense if using Focus Sash and an offensive EV spread.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt gives Annihilape a strong matchup into bulky walls such as Ting-Lu and opposing setup foes like Volcarona, while also making it easier to boost Rage Fist’s power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Final Gambit: Annihilape's impressive HP stat makes Final Gambit into a powerful KO trading tool, being able to take out bulky foes like Garganacl, Corviknight, Wo-Chien, and Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb versus Bulldoze: Rock Tomb is an excellent Speed reducing move for its ability to hit Dragonite, and threaten Volcarona and Iron Bundle.

Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and opposing Annihilape all struggle against an unexpected Tera Normal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison: Tera Poison has a good matchup against Flutter Mane, and lets Annihilape deal with Toxic and Toxic Spikes without needing to Taunt.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash: Even when using bulky EV spreads, Focus Sash is useful for surviving an attack from foes that can be difficult to EV for, such as Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry can be used with specialized spreads to avoid certain 2HKOs. Just make sure to have an even HP stat, to ensure that Sitrus Berry activates after getting hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roseli Berry</strong>: Roseli Berry works well on specially defensive EV spreads designed defeat Flutter Mane leads that lack Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Abilities</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: Vital Spirit adds to Annihilape’s reliability as a lead. Immunity to sleep moves from common Pokemon such as Breloom, Brute Bonnet, Dondozo, Hippowdon, and Skeledirge lets Annihilape thrive with more defensive EV spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Defiant: While Intimidate Pokemon are far from common from the format, Defiant can take advantage opposing Speed control moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Inner Focus</strong>: This niche ability prevents flinches from Chien-Pao and Dragonite from happening.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Alternate EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>172 HP / 4 Atk / 212 Def / 4 SpD / 116 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This Speed drop based spread allows Annihilape to outspeed -1 Iron Bundle and avoids getting 2HKOed by Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: If using Focus Sash and Close Combat together, maximizing Attack and Speed will win the most matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>220 HP / 244 SpD / 44 Spe with Careful</strong>: This Roseli Berry based spread lets Annihilape survive Modest Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball and outspeed -1 Garchomp and 4 Speed EV Tinkaton.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Sitrus Berry EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 180 SpD / 100 Spe with Careful: This Sitrus Berry optimized EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, while outspeeding Adamant Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 244 Def / 20 Spe with Impish</strong>: This defensive spread is Annihilape's best chance at being a soft check to Chien-Pao, though note that Swords Dance and Terastallization together can still overwhelm Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> "

It also gets a Speed boost from Quark Drive.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 236 Def / 36 Spe with Bold</strong>: This very physically defensive EV spread will allow a full health Iron Moth to survive Tera Dark Black Glasses Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave after Supreme Overlord has been boosted by two KOed teammates.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Sitrus Berry Exclusive EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p>When using Sitrus Berry, make sure to run an even HP stat, so that one use of Ruination will activate it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>180 HP / 228 Def / 100 Spe with Timid: This EV spread almost always survives two hits from Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Throat Chop with Sitrus Berry, and it outspeeds Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 188 Def / 12 SpA / 12 SpD / 52 Spe with Bold</strong>: This EV spread usually prevents Iron Moth from getting 2HKOed by Timid Flutter Mane's Psyshock and avoids a 2HKO from Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Throat Chop as well. The minor Special Defense investment also avoids a 2HKO from Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse and Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Booster Energy Exclusive EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 244 Def / 36 SpA / 4 SpD / 36 Spe with Modest</strong>: This Booster Energy optimized spread OHKOes 4 Special Defense EVs Iron Bundle with a Quark Drive-boosted Fiery Dance while having good enough physical bulk to have a good chances of surviving powerful attacks from full health, like Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Psyshock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 220 SpD / 36 Spe with Calm</strong>: This EV spread gives Iron Moth a Special Defense boost with Quark Drive, making it so bulky that even a Modest Choice Specs Chi-Yu has a low chance of 2HKOing it with Dark Pulse!</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Benchmarks for Speed EVs</h1> <p>Like many fast bulky Pokemon, Iron Moth has an huge variety of viable EV builds. If you'd like to make your own EV spread though, keep these Speed tiers in mind! Natures that can efficiently use these Speed tiers will be mentioned.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>36 Speed EVs with any Neutral Nature</strong>: This is the minimum amount of Speed to run, outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>52 Speed EVs with any Neutral Nature: This outspeeds Modest Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>76 Speed EVs with Timid or 180 Speed EVs with Calm This outspeeds Modest Chi-Yu, Jolly Baxcalibur, and Jolly Great Tusk. Note that Timid will give Iron Moth a bonus point to Speed, but a Calm nature has a greater chance of surviving some special attacks with specific EV spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>132 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This is the minimum investment for Iron Moth to get a Speed boost from Quark Drive, assuming no Special Attack investment, since doing so will increase Special Attack instead.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>148 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 Speed EVs with Timid: This outspeeds Jolly Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> "

Toxapex is one of the best options thanks to its good defensive synergy with Wo-Chien, but other options include Iron Moth, Glimmora, Clodsire, Focus Sash Meowscarada, and the niche Gengar.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Snarl: Snarl makes fearsome special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu far easier to switch into when Wo-Chien needs to escape, though Wo-Chien will need to have the correct Tera Type to outstall these foes itself.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain: In addition to providing some extra recovery, Ingrain makes phazers such as Ting-Lu and Hippowdon fail to stop Wo-Chien consistently, though Wo-Chien being trapped is a serious drawback.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Despite Wo-Chien's fantastic bulk, its vulnerability to Toxic Spikes and poor defensive typing mean it must often Terastallize to stall out teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison provides a vital resistance to Fairy and Fighting, and it also lets Wo-Chien absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Besides being a great defensive type, Tera Fairy helps Wo-Chien against Fighting-types that'd normally beat it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water provides Ice and Fire resistances, helpful against Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire: Tera Fire gives useful resistances to Fairy, Fire, and Ice, which help against major threats like Flutter Mane, Baxcalibur, Chi-Yu, and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Wo-Chien's stalling playstyle makes Leftovers the most consistent recovery item.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Big Root</strong>: If another Pokemon desperately needs Leftovers, Big Root is a viable alternative for getting extra recovery from Leech Seed and Giga Drain.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads and Adjustments</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish or Bold</strong>: Maximizing Wo-Chien's physical bulk lets it pull off some incredible stunts, such as avoiding a 3HKO from Breloom's Mach Punch with Leftovers and, after Terastallization, avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Band Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Careful or Calm: With the correct Tera Type and maximum Special Defense, Wo-Chien can take on Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle much more effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using 60 SpA EVs</strong>: If you're willing to give up a bit of bulk, this investment is required to OHKO Iron Bundle with Giga Drain with either a Bold or a Calm nature.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using 100 Speed EVs</strong>: With some sacrifice to bulk, this Speed investment lets Wo-Chien outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Kingambit, and it can be vital in Wo-Chien mirror matches after Terastallization makes it vulnerable to Leech Seed, due to Substitute blocking Leech Seed.</p> </li> </ul> "

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its high Attack and Speed, and incredible ability in Sword of Ruin, Chien-Pao is one of the strongest physical attackers in the game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Icicle Crash</strong>: While Ice Spinner is perfectly accurate, Icicle Crash’s higher power and flinch chance makes it the preferred attack. Additionally, not being a contact move allows Chien-Pao to avoid unnecessary chip damage from Rocky Helmet users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sucker Punch vs Crunch</strong>: Sucker Punch offers priority with a strong base power at the cost of necessitating prediction, while Crunch is a more standard attack whose Defense drop can allow Chien-Pao to potentially break through bulky foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Shard</strong>: Ice Shard is a more consistent albeit weaker alternative to Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sacred Sword</strong>: Sacred Sword provides coverage for Pokemon that resist one or both of Chien-Pao’s STAB attacks, like Heatran, Chi-Yu, and other Chien-Pao. Additionally, ignoring defense boosts allows Chien-Pao to deal more consistent damage to foes who boost their Defense.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance: While it can be difficult to fit and very reliant on Focus Sash, Swords Dance boosts Chien-Pao’s Attack to unwallable levels, making it a very potent sweeper.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>0-1 SpA IV</strong>: If using Tera Blast on Jolly Chien-Pao, make sure to to use a SpA IV that's 0-1. This is because if Flutter Mane uses Charm, any SpA IV that's higher will result in Tera Blast becoming a Special Attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Throat Chop: Throat Chop disables the use of sound-based moves from targets like Skeledirge and Sylveon, but these matchups are so uncommon that it generally isn't worth using over Crunch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner: Ice Spinner can be used as a more consistent Ice STAB, however it makes Chien-Pao more vulnerable to Rocky Helmet users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sheer Cold</strong>: While it may seem alluring, Sheer Cold is usually a waste of a slot on Chien-Pao sets like this, as its standard attacks already hit most relevant foes. Even if Chien-Pao fails to KO a foe, it will generally leave it within range for a teammate.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li>With few exceptions, Chien-Pao is about all-out offense. However, its choice of item drastically affects its strategy. Tera Types have been organized by item choice to better clarify how each Tera Type works in that context.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Tera Types for Focus Sash and Life Orb</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Chien-Pao offers power in spades without needing to Terastallize, only needing it on very rare occasions to break past specific walls or dodge priority moves aimed at it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric can be used in tandem with Tera Blast to improve Chien-Pao’s matchup against key threats such as Urshifu-R and Dondozo while also making it immune to paralysis.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost: Tera Ghost doesn’t offer much offensive benefit, but it allows Chien-Pao to dodge Dragonite’s Extreme Speed, which can be particularly useful if using Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass: Tera Grass lets Chien-Pao survive Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes, which otherwise threatens to OHKO through Focus Sash. Combined with Tera Blast, Chien-Pao still threatens big damage into Urshifu-R and Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosts Sucker Punch to extreme power levels while making Crunch exceptionally difficult to switch into without a resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice can allow Chien-Pao to finish foes off with Ice Shard from higher ranges and makes Icicle Crash an even more formidable tool.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Tera Types for Choice Band</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Chien-Pao is already plenty powerful, Choice Band combined with Tera can elevate 2HKOs to OHKOs on some of the bulkiest walls in the meta. For this reason, Tera can be worth using on Choice Band sets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark turns Choice Band Crunch into a devastating wallbreaker move that few can withstand, OHKOing Max HP Annihilape and Scizor if using an Adamant nature. Neutralizing Chien-Pao’s Steel-type weakness also makes it less vulnerable to Scizor’s Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice: Tera Ice gives Choice Band Icicle Crash enough power to challenge even physically defensive Ting-Lu, having approximately a 69% chance to OHKO if using an Adamant nature; be warned, however, that Ting-Lu often Terastallizes in front of Chien-Pao, making this inconsistent. The extra power behind Ice Shard is also a welcome boost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: Tera Fairy combined with Choice Band Tera Blast handily defeats some of Chien-Pao's less common checks, OHKOing standard variants of Annihilape and Assault Vest Iron Hands. It also removes several weaknesses, most notably turning Chien-Pao's 4x Fighting-type weakness into a resistance.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly or Adamant: This offensive spread works with all standard sets. Adamant gives Chien-Pao a significant power boost, but Jolly is important for Speed tying with Flutter Mane and opposing Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 68 Def / 188 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This alternate spread is commonly associated with Choice Band, fully maximizing Attack while still maintaining enough Speed to outrun Timid Iron Moth. When used with an appropriate Tera type, the Defense investment lets Chien-Pao survive Life Orb Mimikyu's Play Rough into Shadow Sneak.</p> </li> </ul> "

Note that while using Taunt against Toxapex can be useful, it is highly likely to run Mental Herb, which risks getting Ting-Lu poisoned.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect: Protect with Leftovers is a strong choice when running Ting-Lu with high sustain teammates such as Toxapex.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fissure</strong>: Fissure lets Ting-Lu potentially punish passive Pokemon without Substitute, such as Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: Getting Stealth Rock and Spikes together makes Whirlwind a very effective damage dealing tool, in addition to supporting other offensive Pokemon. However, it can be difficult to set up without compromising Ting-Lu's damage output.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Tera Types</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Even with Ting-Lu's fantastic bulk, Terastallization greatly increases the amount of Pokemon it can beat one-on-one, such as Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy: In addition to a useful Fighting resistance, Tera Fairy helps Ting-Lu against powerful Dragon-types like Choice Band Dragonite and Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison: Tera Poison gives Ting-Lu an important resistance to Fairy and Fighting, and it lets it absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: With Tera Water, Ting-Lu has a significantly better matchup against Urshifu-R. The Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu matchups can also benefit, but be mindful of potential Tera Blast coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel: Tera Steel retaining a Fighting weakness is unfortunate, but in exchange, Heavy Slam will OHKO even most bulky Flutter Mane, and it gives Ting-Lu a good matchup against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>Items</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Ting-Lu's lack of reliable recovery usually makes Sitrus Berry the most reliable method of surviving an extra attack. Leftovers is a good alternative if Sitrus Berry is needed somewhere else, and even preferable if running Protect.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: Mental Herb can be used to nullify one use of Taunt or Encore, which Ting-Lu is fairly vulnerable to, at the cost of reducing its lifespan with a lack of any recovery.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Maximum Physical Defense versus Maximum Special Defense</strong>: Specializing in one defensive stat depends on which threats Ting-Lu needs to handle, with physically defensive variants preforming better against threats like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Kingambit, and when Terastallized, Chien-Pao, Azumarill, and Baxcalibur. For specially defensive variants, major targets include Gholdengo and Iron Moth, and when Terastallized, Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>212 HP / 4 Atk / 116 Def / 156 SpD / 20 Spe with Impish: When Terastallized to a neutral typing, Ting-Lu survives up to four Icicle Crashes from Jolly Focus Sash Chien-Pao.

The Speed EVs let it outrun uninvested Hippowdon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>44 HP / 252 Def / 212 SpD with Careful: This EV spread is optimized for use with Sitrus Berry, letting Ting-Lu avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage, and Timid Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast when Terastallized to a neutral typing.</p> </li> </ul> "
