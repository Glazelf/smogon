Access to all of Fake Out, Follow Me, and a pivot move in Flip Turn makes Blastoise incredibly effective at controlling the board and generating space for teammates to operate. Its respectable defenses leave it quite adept at soaking up attacks for its team; its pure-Water typing can be a mixed bag, though, only truly vulnerable to Grass-types such as Rillaboom but giving little in meaningful resistances. Blastoise generally fits best in fast, aggressive teams that feature threatening setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult, Nasty Plot Spectrier, and Quiver Dance Volcarona. While Blastoise does compete with Amoonguss as a redirector and Tapu Fini as a bulky Water-type, it can be a better fit for borderline hyper offensive compositions that prefer its dynamic, positioning-oriented arsenal over slow, controlling utility of Amoonguss's Spore and Tapu Fini's terrain control. Most glaringly, though, Blastoise's focus on sponging hits can let strong attackers like Urshifu-R and Zygarde simply overwhelm it or ignore the redirection; its lack of any offensive presence whatsoever means its partners must be threatening enough to make the support count.</p> ",

  "Zapdos-Galar": {
    "overview": "<p>Hailing from the Crown Tundra, the regional variant of Zapdos distinguishes itself as a strong, fast attacker thanks to its good Speed and great STAB combination. Galarian Zapdos also has the benefit of being a physical attacker that punishes Intimidate attempts with its Defiant ability, which makes it even stronger. Its Fighting / Flying typing grants it an excellent STAB combination that threatens many excellent Pokemon such as Rillaboom, Urshifu-R, Kyurem-B, and Incineroar. In particular, Galarian Zapdos is one of the best Rillaboom counters thanks to its resistance to Grass-type moves and ability to OHKO it with Brave Bird. This makes it one of the best partners for Tapu Fini, which greatly appreciates one of its greatest threats being removed. Another great teammate is Zygarde, who also loves Galarian Zapdos handling Rillaboom, along with it discouraging Intimidate from the likes of Incineroar and Landorus-T. Thanks to the combination of its base 100 Speed and the boost from Choice Scarf, Galarian Zapdos is able to outspeed Kyurem-B after a Dragon Dance, as well as common users of Choice Scarf, most notably Genesect. Galarian Zapdos's ability to consistently be the fastest Pokemon on the field is invaluable for bulkier teams that can struggle against more offensive teams. However, Galarian Zapdos struggles against the same bulkier teams, as Pokemon with high Defense like Tapu Fini and Diancie are mainstays on those teams, and Galarian Zapdos can struggle to break past them. Its damage can also be lackluster against neutral targets without a rare Defiant boost. Galarian Zapdos's poor defenses also make it dead weight against opposing speed control, and its reliance on Choice Scarf makes it very susceptible to Fake Out putting it in a vulnerable situation, along with the move lock being easily exploited. On top of that, it faces stiff competition from fellow Fighting-type Urshifu-R, which indirectly ignores Intimidate via Surging Strikes, while also being able to ignore Protect thanks to Unseen Fist.</p> ",

Mew is often used as a lead, to set up either speed control or hazards early on, or as a mid-game Tailwind enabler. Pokemon with strong spread moves, such as Choice Band Zygarde and Heatran, benefit from Mew's ability to reliably set Tailwind. Pokemon such as Genesect, Incineroar, and Tyranitar can threaten Mew with super effective attacks; teammates such as Heatran, Zygarde, and Urshifu-R can make use of Tailwind to put pressure on these threats.

Strong teammates such as Urshifu-R, Landorus, and Heatran are preferred to capitalize on Crobat's Tailwind, with these three in particular being notable for decimating Diancie. One must be wary of opposing Zeraora, however, which completely counters Crobat because it is faster, can prevent Tailwind with Taunt, and hits Crobat super effectively with Plasma Fists.

Attackers like Urshifu-R, Zapdos, Kingdra, and Tornadus take advantage of rain, and Helping Hand boosts their strength even further. Scald burns and support moves such as Icy Wind and Encore give Politoed further utility value beyond setting rain. A major drawback Politoed faces is matching up poorly against a plethora of common Pokemon, such as Rillaboom, Tapu Fini, Kyurem-B, Amoonguss, and Dragapult, among others. The aforementioned teammates, along with others like Genesect and Tsareena, can help this, though. Politoed's relative passivity can also clash with the typically fast-paced nature of rain teams.

In particular, Kingdra excels in using its offensive presence to give its teammates space and clean up weakened teams. However, it has multiple awkward matchups in the metagame, including against DOU's top threats in Rillaboom, Tapu Fini, and Kyurem-B, and its average Special Attack stat can at times feel lacking, which is a major downside, as it offers no utility outside of purely attacking. Kingdra, in particular, faces stiff competition as a Water-type attacker in rain from Urshifu-R, which boasts noticeably better power output and coverage, an improved matchup against Trick Room, more relevant utility in the ability to force trades with Unseen Fist, and most importantly a non-reliance on rain to be effective; while Kingdra does offer blazing Speed and a better match-up against fast Dragon-types in Dragapult and Naganadel, its Speed is also easily compensated for by the rain archetype's many Tailwind-setting Flying-type options in Tornadus and Zapdos, and its need for Speed also leaves it much more vulnerable in the face of opposing speed control.

Its passable natural bulk, particularly its solid Defense, makes it difficult to KO in one hit without a special Ground- or Rock-type attack. However, Torkoal has its limitations: namely, entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes, which greatly limit its offensive potential, as they cripple Eruption's power as soon as Torkoal enters the battlefield. Additionally, its reliance on Trick Room, and accordingly, multiple Trick Room setters like Porygon2, Diancie, and Necrozma, and sun means that it needs to work hard to get the most out of the few turns it is afforded. Even then, other Fire-types such as Heatran and Volcanion give it stiff competition for a slot on semi-Trick Room teams.

Prankster Tailwind is a great tool, as it immediately enables many strong attackers, and it can even be consistently set while opposing speed control is up, which is invaluable to the Hyper Offense teams Whimsicott is usually found on. Pokemon like Heatran, Urshifu-R, Zygarde, and Landorus especially appreciate Whimsicott's support, and the latter two can threaten the Fire-types, like Incineroar, that Whimsicott hates. Heatran and Landorus further benefit from Fake Tears. Whimiscott also has limited defensive utility, as its typing allows it to switch in on the likes of Rillaboom, Zygarde, and Urshifu-R, although its poor defenses make this risky. This same bad bulk, alongside its overall poor typing, means Whimsicott has trouble setting Tailwind multiple times, as it struggles to stay in for multiple turns or switch back in after leaving the field.

It is bulky enough to live most attacks, and the added survivability from Regenerator allows it to perform its role repeatedly throughout a match. Additionally, Pollen Puff ensures Amoonguss's teammates can also remain healthy. Setup Pokemon, such as Dragon Dance Zygarde or Kyurem-B and Calm Mind Tapu Fini, benefit the most from Amoonguss's support and can make up for its minimal damage output. Due to its low Speed and Spore, Amoonguss also works well both with and against Trick Room teams, as it can then send most Pokemon to sleep before they move. Trick Room users such as Porygon2 and Diancie also appreciate the redirection support while setting it. Despite being able to stomach most hits, Amoonguss must be wary of Fire-types such as Heatran and Incineroar as well as Psychic-types such as Tapu Lele and Necrozma, requiring teammates to deal with them such as Urshifu-R and Heatran, respectively. The presence of Misty Terrain hampers Amoonguss's Spore, so terrain setters such as Tapu Lele and Indeedee-F, or Metagross with Steel Roller, are essential to remove it. Opposing Grass-types such as Rillaboom, or Pokemon holding Safety Goggles, can also be troublesome, as immunity to powder moves lets them mostly ignore Amoonguss and attack its partner. Blastoise, its biggest competitor as a redirector, doesn't share this drawback.</p> ",

However, Eject Button can be awkward if Amoonguss intends to use Spore and gets forced out instead or needs to redirect two attacks. Another option is Rocky Helmet, which provides chip damage on physical attackers such as Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, and Genesect. These alternate item choices are not as generally useful as the recovery from Sitrus Berry, though. Clear Smog is a weaker Poison-type STAB move compared to Sludge Bomb, but it can be used instead to help deal with opposing setup.

Its base 101 Speed is just enough to pin down nearly the entire unboosted metagame, letting it get the jump on Mew, Urshifu-R, and Zygarde while only being outrun and threatened by Nihilego, Naganadel, and Dragapult. However, Landorus offers very little defensive utility in disadvantaged positions against opposing speed control, is vulnerable to Ice- and Water-type attacks from the likes of Porygon2 and Tapu Fini, an is relatively frail, leaving it easily OHKOed by the aforementioned three faster threats. Tailwind teammates mitigate this weakness, with Naganadel in particular also matching up well against Assault Vest Kyurem-B, Tapu Fini, and Rillaboom, which Landorus can struggle against.

Thousand Arrows is a big draw to Zygarde, as it is one of the best offensive spread moves in the game due hitting Ground-immune Pokemon, making it having no immunities and a lack of resistances on an already great offensive type. Choice Band allows Zygarde to be immediately threatening to teams with instant power, while Dragon Dance turns it into a threatening sweeper. However, both options have issues with being too slow and requiring multiple turns of setup to be threatening, respectively. Redirection support from the likes of Volcarona and Amoonguss as well as Fake Out support from Rillaboom and Zeraora can help alleviate these weaknesses, with the Dragon Dance set in particular appreciating these opportunities to set Substitute and set up. Due to the Zygarde's middling Speed tier and lack of immediate power ,it is easily pressured by the likes of Genesect, Kyurem-B, and Dragapult which outspeed and threaten to OHKO it. Furthermore, Rillaboom, Tapu Fini, and the aforementioned Kyurem-B easily take a hit from Zygarde and can force it back out. Intimidate from both Landorus-T and Incineroar can make Zygarde much easier to deal with defensively. Zygarde also faces stiff competition with Landorus, which boasts much more immediate power and better coverage options.</p> ",

However, the Defense drop and being forced to drop a potentially more useful coverage option makes it not worth it most of the time.

Offensively, Rock has minimal resistances and hits common Pokemon like Kyurem-B and Incineroar super effectively. While its typing might leave it with four common weaknesses, its outstanding defensive stats mean that it can usually take a hit and activate Weakness Policy. Diancie fits best on semi-Trick Room compositions, where it takes advantage of its low Speed and can set up Trick Room multiple times and start shredding holes in the opponent's team with Diamond Storm, stacking Defense boosts to make it much harder to get rid of. Clear Body also lets it ignore Intimidate, making it very hard to stop once it gets going. Volcanion makes for an excellent partner, as it helps remove Grass- and Steel-types such as Rillaboom and Genesect for Diancie, which in return provides reliable speed control. Rillaboom's Fake Out makes Trick Room easier to set up and its powerful Grass-type STAB moves help against Urshifu-R and Tapu Fini. In return, Diancie takes care of Fire-types and Kyurem-B. Diancie struggles quite a bit outside of Trick Room, where its poor Speed leaves it vulnerable to super effective hits from the likes of Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, Zygarde, and Genesect, the first ignoring any Defense boosts Diancie might accumulate and the second having strong priority to hit first even if Trick Room is active. Diancie is also hard walled by Metagross, and must always worry about its strong Steel-type STAB moves threatening an OHKO. Furthermore, it can struggle to break past bulkier Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Amoonguss even under Trick Room, the latter of which is able to land Spore freely if Diancie isn't using Safety Goggles.</p> ",

Play Rough is another alternative to Moonblast that's stronger, but it risks missing and the power difference is typically not needed, especially if Diancie gets the Weakness Policy boost. Babiri, Rindo, Shuca, and Passho Berry are all options to make sure Diancie lives a certain hit on specific teams and Mental Herb can be used to ignore Taunt once, but these items are less useful overall than Weakness Policy or Safety Goggles.</p> ",

Naganadel and Kyurem-B threaten to OHKO Kommo-o before it sets up; however, if it safely gets a Clangorous Soul off it will become a threat to them instead. Rillaboom is a support for Kommo-o as it both checks Tapu Fini and sets Grassy Terrain to replace Misty or Psychic Terrain. The recovery provided by Grassy Terrain also helps make up for Clangorous Souls recoil.

    "overview": "<p>Tapu Fini is an important asset of balance teams thanks to its defensive and offensive utility, which stems from its typing and ability. A Water / Fairy typing lets it easily take attacks from the likes of Heatran, Urshifu-R, and Volcanion, especially when considering its great natural bulk, which also allows it to take neutral attacks from the likes of Zygarde and Dragapult relatively well. In return, it can threaten the aforementioned Pokemon back with its STAB moves, giving it offensive utility as well. Misty Surge allows Tapu Fini to exert Terrain control, with Misty Terrain removing priority from Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and turning Necrozma's Expanding Force into a single target move. Misty Terrain also has the benefit of blocking Amoonguss's Spore and weakening Dragon-type moves from the likes of Dragapult and Kommo-o. Tapu Fini can take advantage of Pokemon it walls with a Calm Mind set, which lets it function as a dangerous wincon while maintaining its defensive and offensive utility. It can also take on a support role and utilize its great support movepool with moves like Heal Pulse and Nature's Madness. The Calm Mind set can take a bit to get going and relies on Leftovers to keep it healthy, while the support set is mostly passive. Further, both sets have a tendency to be and share a considerable weakness to one of the best Pokemon in the tier, Rillaboom. It threatens Tapu Fini with its powerful STAB Grassy Glide and resets Misty Terrain. Tapu Fini also has a tendency to get overwhelmed and chipped while it switches in to take resisted hits and change the terrain, a problem made worse by its lack of instant recovery. Pokemon that can handle Rillaboom make excellent partners for Tapu Fini. Kyurem-B and Incineroar in particular are great partners, as Tapu Fini beats Urshifu-R for them as well.</p> ",

    "overview": "<p>While Nihilego shines in DOU as a menacing attacker that can quickly turn a game in its favor, it is particularly held back by its one-dimensional nature, lacking coverage, and vulnerability to the tier's various physical threats. Its access to the combination of STAB-boosted Meteor Beam and Beast Boost make it quite dangerous, with the ability to completely dominate the game off a single KO being its main selling point. This is supplemented by its impressive offensive stats, as its base 127 Special Attack is quite high and its Speed allows it to outrun a large swathe of the metagame, only beaten by the likes of Zeraora, Dragapult, and Naganadel. Outside of purely attacking, though, Nihilego can only really utilize its astounding Special Defense to soak some special hits in a pinch; it otherwise offers no team-wide utility whatsoever, which means it's completely useless in opposing speed control, as it wouldn't be able to safely attack. Its paper-thin Defense leaves it prey to the likes of Rillaboom, Urshifu-R, and Zeraora, and it's also completely walled by Zygarde and Metagross. Fake Out and redirection support from Incineroar, Rillaboom, Blastoise, and Amoonguss can be handy in giving it the space to operate, with Incineroar also having Intimidate to hide Nihilego's low Defense, while the likes of Dragapult, Kyurem-B, and Genesect help in making up for Nihilego's lacking coverage. Most glaring, though, is how predictable Nihilego can be, as it practically needs Meteor Beam to be truly threatening, and its set is also essentially telegraphed due to needing both reliable STAB moves and having a lacking movepool.</p> ",

Volt Switch offers fast pivoting that can also deal okay damage, Electroweb gives fast, spread speed control to support middling-Speed wallbreakers, and Snarl expands upon the special bulk provided by Assault Vest while annoying special attackers. For a more offensive take on Zeraora, it can use a Life Orb and drop Fake Out in favor of Protect. Close Combat often finds its way onto such sets, as it hits Kyurem-B super effectively as well as Incineroar and Porygon2. Using an Adamant nature is a different way to get a bit more power, notably increasing the chance to KO Urshifu-R with Plasma Fists. This misses out on outrunning Dragapult and Spectrier and Speed tying with opposing Zeraora, but teams with adequate answers for these foes can get away with it. Equipping a Magnet guarantees the Plasma Fists OHKO on Urshifu-R without changing the makeup of Zeraora's standard set, but this is the only benchmark it enables.</p> ",

    "overview": "<p>Rillaboom is among the best pivots in the metagame thanks to its excellent ability, useful utility moves, and strong priority STAB attack. Grassy Surge lets Rillaboom set Grassy Terrain on switch-in, providing passive healing for teammates and slowing down threats that benefit from Psychic Terrain such as Necrozma. Grassy Glide is given priority and boosted by Grassy Terrain, letting Rillaboom soft check a wide variety of threats regardless of Speed, such as boosted Dragon Dance Zygarde and Diancie under Trick Room, as well as picking off any Pokemon low on health. Rillaboom works well on a variety of team archetypes thanks to the sheer utility it provides. For example, structures that rely on Trick Room or setup appreciate Rillaboomâ€™s ability to create safe turns through the use of Fake Out, while the latter also appreciates Grassy Terrain's passive healing to keep wincons healthy. Volcanion and Urshifu-R synergize well with Rillaboom, as they remove Fire-types and Kyurem-B, respectively, and in return, Rillaboom checks Water-types such as Tapu Fini. Rillaboom is not without faults, though; its Grass typing leaves it with a plethora of weaknesses that are exposed by common Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Genesect, and it can be tricky to use alongside other Terrain setters. It's also worn down quickly by pivoting in and out, especially with entry hazards up, as it typically has no recovery besides Grassy Terrain and doesn't carry Protect, leaving it open to being attacked every turn and susceptible to double targets.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Superpower is an option over Wood Hammer to hit Heatran and Kyurem-B, while High Horsepower secures an OHKO on Heatran and is better against Metagross, but it leaves Rillaboom toothless against Kyurem-B. If using High Horsepower, Rillaboom can also run a more offensive spread with a Jolly nature to always outspeed Heatran. Knock Off is also available to hit Dragapult, but all three alternatives mean missing out on your most powerful STAB attack. Eject Button is an option to switch in, set Terrain, and immediately pivot out to a strong attacker on more offensive teams if keeping up momentum is preferred over longevity. A Choice Band set can deal massive damage, notably securing the OHKO on Urshifu-R with Grassy Glide under Grassy Terrain, but it loses out on Fake Out and overall support value. Miracle Seed is another option to make sure Rillaboom can OHKO Urshifu-R while retaining Fake Out, but it's significantly weaker than Choice Band and generally inferior to Assault Vest and Eject Button besides from that one benchmark.</p> ",

While Indeedee-F faces competition from Tapu Lele, its access to Follow Me essentially lets it act as the hyper offensive archetype's defensive backbone, as it leaves Necrozma and other attackers such as Heatran and Urshifu-R safe to wreak havoc on the opposing team. If Necrozma is not on the same team, though, then Indeedee-F is generally a poor pick; as a redirector, Indeedee-F pales in comparison to Blastoise and Amoonguss with regard to defensive stats, typing, and utility, and as a Psychic Terrain setter, Tapu Lele's monstrous strength and overall better stats will be more useful. Even within Psychic spam teams, Indeedee-F's lack of offensive presence compared to Tapu Lele can be quite exploitable, with Tapu Lele's ability to check Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Kyurem-B possibly being missed, and Indeedee-F's redirection niche is still replaceable by Amoonguss.

    "overview": "<p>Dragapult is useful on a wide variety of teams for its great typing and Speed. Its Dragon / Ghost typing lets it switch into Pokemon like Urshifu-R, and Heatran. It's also a great offensive typing, as Ghost-type moves are virtually unresisted in the metagame bar Pokemon like Incineroar and Porygon2, and Dragon-type moves hit many important targets like Kyurem-B and Zygarde. Its Speed allows it to outpace the vast majority of the unboosted metagame. These qualities allow it to handle many great Pokemon like Urshifu-R, and Zygarde, along with other Pokemon like Rillaboom and Necrozma. Its Choice Specs set can apply pressure instantly, while conversely, its Dragon Dance set can end a game outright if given the freedom to set up. However, Dragapult is heavily relies on its Speed, and its lack of bulk can give it trouble with speed control and switching in. Both sets can also feel underwhelming at times, as the Choice Specs set has to make use of Dragapult's mere base 100 Special Attack, while the Dragon Dance set is reliant on getting boosts to become threatening and lacks reliable STAB moves. As a result, it can struggle to break bulkier Pokemon like Porygon2 and Amoonguss, and it falls easily to faster attackers like Choice Scarf Genesect and Dragon Dance-boosted Kyurem-B. Dragapult also loathes Tapu Fini, as Misty Terrain severely limits Dragapult's offensive pressure, and Tapu Fini can OHKO it after minimal chip. This weakness to Tapu Fini makes Rillaboom a prime partner for the drake; Rillaboom can change the Terrain and provide openings for Dragapult to set up via Fake Out. Blastoise is a good partner for the Dragon Dance set, as it packs both Fake Out and Follow Me. Diancie is also another good partner for Dragapult, as it handles Kyurem-B and Incineroar well.</p> ",

Instead, it is often answered offensively by the likes of Rillaboom, Dragapult, and Necrozma. Urshifu-R is held back by a fairly middling Speed tier, meaning pairing it with speed control and priority will be very helpful.

After a Nasty Plot boost, Spectrier is difficult to slow down due to Grim Neigh making it stronger with each KO, along with a Fake Out immunity.

However, without a boost, Spectrier can struggle to break past bulkier Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Incineroar, the latter of which doesn't fear Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball is also its only good attack, which exacerbates the issue of needing a boost to snowball and be optimally effective. Spectrier also has issues setting up a Nasty Plot, due to the being frail enough to fear spread damage even when given redirection, and Life Orb recoil leaves it vulnerable to priority moves such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. To top it all off, Spectrier relies heavily on its Speed, which makes it weak to opposing Tailwind or Trick Room, while also being threatened by the two Pokemon naturally faster than it, Zeraora and Dragapult.
