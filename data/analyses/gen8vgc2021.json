        "description": "<p>Chlorophyll makes Venusaur into an excellent attacker able to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame while threatening opponents with its great offensive typing, coverage, and Sleep Powder. Grass Knot takes advantage of the heavy weight of the restricted Pokemon of the format, reaching maximum Base Power against Groudon, Kyogre, and Xerneas. Leaf Storm is not reliant on weight for its power, having a chance to OHKO Landorus with a Life Orb and a Modest nature. Sludge Bomb hits Xerneas and Tapu Lele as well as hitting Tapu Fini hard, which does not take much damage from Grass Knot due to its light weight. Sleep Powder disrupts the opposition and lets Venusaur disable Pokemon in unfavorable matchups. Earth Power is important to hit many Ground-weak-Pokemon such as Stakataka and Nihilego as well as other metagame staples such as Incineroar and Zacian-C for decent damage. Alternatively, sun-boosted Weather Ball threatens to deal much more damage to Zacian-C while also hitting Amoonguss hard. Life Orb enables Venusaur to OHKO Nihilego with Modest Earth Power, 2HKO Zacian-C with Earth Power, and OHKO Kyogre with Modest Grass Knot. Alternatively, Focus Sash gives up power for survivability, avoiding an OHKO from the likes of Incineroar, Zacian-C, and Volcarona. A Timid Venusaur outspeeds Regieleki in sun, but it fails to outspeed any other notable targets and gives up much appreciated power.</p> <p>Venusaur must be paired with a Drought setter, Torkoal or preferably Groudon, in order to activate Chlorophyll. Groudon greatly appreciates Venusaur's ability to threaten opposing Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Tsareena while it handles Fire types such as Incineroar for Venusaur. Venusaur is not a very good Kyogre check on its own, so be sure to add secondary Grass- or Electric-type checks such as Assault Vest Rillaboom, Tsareena, and Regieleki to your team. Nihilego and Incineroar are great teammates for Venusaur for their ability to check opposing Fire-types like Volcarona and Incineroar; in exchange, Venusaur can pick off many Ground-types-such as opposing Groudon for them.</p> "

Waterfall is Gyarados's main STAB move, hitting prevalent Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon like Entei and Landorus. Power Whip provides Gyarados with coverage for Water-types, hitting Kyogre and Urshifu-R for a 2HKO, as well being the strongest option to hit Groudon with in the sun. Icy Wind offers speed control for letting Gyarados and its teammates surpass fast threats such as Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, and Landorus. Lash Out makes Gyarados a solid check to Calyrex-S and Lunala, notably OHKOing the former. Lash Out is used over Crunch or Payback in order to always get the OHKO on Calyrex-S, even if Gyarados is worn down by opposing Intimidate. Stone Edge gives Gyarados an option to OHKO Volcarona and ignore its Flame Body and the ability to 2HKO Entei in the sun, which is especially relevant, as Entei is sometimes paired with Groudon. Assault Vest significantly improves Gyarados's ability to take on powerful special attackers such as Calyrex-S and Kyogre.

Water Spout is the primary reason to Kyogre, being able to OHKO just about everything weak to it and still doing significant damage to some Pokemon that resist, notably still 2HKOing Miracle Seed Rillaboom. Hydro Pump, Scald, and Origin Pulse are Water-type STAB options that don't rely on Kyogre's HP to deal good damage. Hydro Pump is absolutely necessary for Timid Kyogre, as it is the only possible way to OHKO Calyrex-S outside of Tailwind. Both Hydro Pump and Scald notably bypass Wide Guard from the likes of Araquanid, Stakataka,and Mienshao with the latter also having a chance to burn, whereas Origin Pulse is a higher-Base Power alternative that allows Kyogre to continue hitting both targets at the cost of a significant amount of accuracy. Ice Beam is the primary coverage move for Kyogre, allowing it to do significant damage to Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Tsareena. Thunder is an option for opposing Kyogre; however, it is less advised due to its reliance on rain. A Timid nature allows Kyogre to naturally outspeed the likes of maximum Speed Rillaboom as well as Calyrex-S and Zacian-C at +1.</p> <p>Kyogre really appreciates Tailwind as speed control, as its base 90 Speed is less than ideal, underspeeding several common Pokemon such as Calyrex-S, Regieleki, Zacian-C, and Xerneas. As such, Tornadus is a must-have partner alongside Kyogre, as it can also fire off 100% accurate Hurricanes into the aforementioned Grass-types. Tsareena is also a great partner for Kyogre, as it is capable of blocking Fake Outs that would otherwise disrupt Kyogre, as well as protecting it from Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Regieleki works well with Kyogre, as its Thunder can't miss in rain and helps deal with opposing Kyogre and Tapu Fini. Like most Pokemon, Kyogre enjoys the presence of Fake Out users such as Incineroar that allow it to pin down KOs.

Scald allows Kyogre to ignore Wide Guard from the likes of Araquanid, Stakataka, and Mienshao while still hitting hard with a Water-type STAB move. Origin Pulse is an alternative that allows Kyogre to deal spread damage while locked into a move at the cost of a bit of accuracy. Ice Beam gives Kyogre the necessary coverage to stand up to the likes of Tsareena and Rillaboom, notably 2HKOing both of them. Thunder is a potential option that Kyogre can use to duel opposing Kyogre, Tapu Fini, and Araquanid, with its perfect accuracy  in rain being a huge boon when locked into the move. Choice Scarf means Kyogre has less reliance on speed control to still do a good amount of damage, whereas Choice Specs will let it deal damage capable of OHKOing most unrestricted hits.

While Groudon is certainly threatening by itself, it's so good more because Drought serves as a catalyst for two of the metagame's most dangerous Pokemon, those being Charizard and Venusaur. Precipice Blades is Groudon's strongest STAB move and gives it access to Max Quake to boost its weaker Special Defense. Groudon has more consistent STAB options, but there is simply too much opportunity cost to reasonably justify them. Rock Slide gives Groudon means to hit Flying-types such as Zapdos and Yveltal, and most critically it threatens an OHKO against Dynamaxed Charizard via Max Rockfall. Swords Dance is useful for offsetting Intimidate from the likes of Landorus-T and Incineroar, and thanks to Groudon's bulk, it can oftentimes get one or even multiple boosts. Sitrus Berry improves Groudon's longevity as a bulky Swords Dance user and support Pokemon to Charizard and Venusaur. Alternatively, Groudon can run White Herb in order to offset Intimidate and make itself generally more threatening; however, Groudon oftentimes doesn't need to be more threatening because its teammates do that job. The given EV spread allows Groudon to outspeed -1 Thundurus and outspeed Tornadus while at +1, both of which are relevant given Groudon is often paired with Charizard, which can use Max Airstream, and Electroweb Regieleki.</p> <p>Groudon should always be paired with Venusaur and almost always with Charizard; there is simply little reason to not use Pokemon that are so powerful in the sun. Venusaur helps Groudon by thwarting Water-types such as Rotom-W, Blastoise, and Kyogre. In return, Groudon can thwart Fire-types like Incineroar and Coalossal. Charizard can assist Groudon by checking Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Venusaur, while Groudon can check Regieleki and Coalossal for Charizard. Regieleki is a great teammate for being one of the best answers to Kyogre teams, and it can also provide Groudon speed control with Electroweb. Grimmsnarl can provide dual screens to bolster Groudon's already good defensive stats, which can help it set up with Swords Dance more safely. Grimmsnarl can also mitigate Groudon's middling Speed via Scary Face or Thunder Wave. Porygon2 is a great partner for Groudon because it's a great check to Landorus-T with Ice Beam, most importantly, and also Calyrex-S with Eerie Impulse, which are both Pokemon that can greatly trouble Groudon teams. Porygon2 can also provide speed control to Groudon with Trick Room. Incineroar supports pretty much every Pokemon well and Groudon is no exception, appreciating Incineroar's ability to keep the likes of Venusaur, Rillaboom, and Calyrex-S in check if it's running Assault Vest. Umbreon is one of the best answers to Calyrex-S and also a solid answer to Calyrex-I, both of which can greatly trouble Groudon and its common teammates. Note that running Umbreon gives up the ability to reasonably justify Porygon2, which compromises the matchup against Landorus-T.</p> "

Moonblast allows Whimsicott to check some of the common Dark- and Fighting-types in the metagame such as Urshifu-R, Urshifu-S, and Yveltal. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam deals chip damage to both Pokemon and can KO a low HP Pokemon protected by a redirector such as Indeedee-F. Grass Knot is another option, dealing significant damage to Kyogre and Groudon. Taunt prevents common status moves such as Stakataka's and Palkia's Trick Room and Amoonguss's Spore. Due to the banning of Dynamax, and Fake Out becoming more prevalent, Encore is great for punishing Fake Out from common non-Dark-type users such as Rillaboom and Mienshao as well as more passive moves such as Protect and Substitute from Zacian-C and Calyrex-S.

Furthermore, Volcarona's main role is not one of a damage dealer but of a redirector. Rage Powder is used to protect allies from opposing attacks while they set up or wreak havoc upon the opposing team. However, it also synergizes well with Flame Body, threatening to burn physical attackers such as Zacian-C, Urshifu-R, and Rillaboom that make contact with their moves. Struggle Bug slows down special attackers like Calyrex-S and Xerneas. Whirlwind is an alternative option to phaze threats such as Geomancy-boosted Xerneas and Substitute Calyrex-S, while Quiver Dance makes Volcarona more and more dangerous as boosts stack. Xerneas appreciates Volcarona's ability to redirect opposing moves like Taunt, Fake Out, and Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade on the turn it sets up with Geomancy. Stakataka is also a great partner, as Volcarona can take opposing Fighting-types' moves like Mienshao's Close Combat and Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and threaten them with a burn while Stakataka sets up Trick Room. Even Zacian-C appreciates Volcarona's help, as it can redirect Landorus's Earth Power and Entei's Sacred Fire, while in exchange, Zacian-C can take out Xerneas and Stakataka for Volcarona with its powerful moves.</p> "

Tailwind also allows Tsareena, another common teammate, to outspeed Landorus and Kyogre. Taunt prevents Trick Room from users such as Stakataka while also shutting down Spore from Amoonguss and Geomancy from Xerneas. Tornadus can run Icy Wind or Rain Dance over Protect; however, it loses its ability to avoid Fake Out and can easily be OHKOed by Pokemon such as Regieleki. Icy Wind provides coverage and speed control, comfortably 2HKOing Pokemon such as Landorus and letting Tornadus control the game's pace if hit by taunt. Rain Dance is useful when playing against Groudon and Torkoal, resetting the weather for Kyogre and weakening Groudon's Heat Crash and Torkoal's Eruption. Focus Sash allows Tornadus to survive Regieleki's Thunderbolt and Volt Switch as well as powerful moves such as Kyogre's Water Spout. Mental Herb allows it to ignore Taunt and Encore and still utilize Tailwind and Taunt for its team.

For its last move slot, Lunala can choose between Wide Guard and Protect. Wide Guard allows Lunala to discourage the powerful spread moves in the format, most notably Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, while Protect instead gives it a more consistent positioning move. This EV spread gives Lunala the bulk to turn +0 Zacian's Behemoth Blade into a 3HKO even without Shadow Shield, but the spread is flexible and can be adapted in many ways.</p> <p>Lunala works well with partners that help it set Trick Room. Incineroar can suppress an opposing Pokemon with Fake Out, while also lowering foes' offensive power with Intimidate and Parting Shot. Amoonguss provides redirection support via Rage Powder, and can disable opposing Pokemon with Spore once Trick Room is up. Lunala also appreciates support moves that heal it back to full health and reactivate Shadow Shield, such as Tapu Fini's Heal Pulse and Amoonguss's Pollen Puff. Stakataka is another good inclusion for Lunala teams, as it provides another option for setting Trick Room and can take advantage of the effect itself. Lunala struggles to damage Dark-type and Normal-type Pokemon after using Meteor Beam; for example, Indeedee can redirect its powerful Moongeist Beam with Follow Me, or even threaten Lunala with a super effective Shadow Ball. Incineroar that run Throat Chop or Darkest Lariat are also capable of inflicting lots of damage, though they need to watch out for Meteor Beam.</p> "

Photon Geyser OHKOes Urshifu-R and gives Necrozma-DM a strong STAB attack unaffected by Intimidate. Trick Room takes advantage of Necrozma-DM's middling speed, allowing it to turn the battle into its favor. Prism Armor and Necrozma-DM's massive bulk make it a good Weakness Policy user often able to stomach super effective attacks, such as Yveltal's Foul Play or Landorus Earth Power. Safety Goggles is an option that protects Necrozma-DM from Amoonguss and Venusaur's sleep moves and bypasses Volcarona and Amoonguss's Rage Powder, though without potential boosts from Weakness Policy Necrozma-DM's damage output can be underwhelming.

Stone Edge hits Fire-types like Incineroar and Entei and notably OHKOes Volcarona. Rock Slide is an alternative for spread damage, but it fails to OHKO maximum Defense Volcarona. Since running Rock coverage unfortunately leaves Necrozma-DM walled by Urshifu-R and Kyogre, Photon Geyser is an option for OHKOing the former and hitting the latter hard; however, this leaves Necrozma-DM walled by Incineroar. Swords Dance can offset Intimidate from the likes of Incineroar and Landorus-T and boost Necrozma-DM's Attack to insane levels, for example OHKOing Yveltal with +2 Sunsteel Strike or +1 Stone Edge. Trick Room can turn the battle in Necrozma-DM's favor due to its middling speed. Weakness Policy has good synergy alongside Swords Dance, enabling you to discourage your opponent from attacking Necrozma-DM in respect to the item and punish them.

Body Press lets Stakataka 2HKO Incineroar while being unaffected by Intimidate, and only gets stronger with each KO it takes thanks to Beast Boost raising Stakataka's Defense. Trick Room helps versus the mostly fast-paced meta, and can turn the battle in Stakataka's favor extremely quickly. Finally, Wide Guard is able to ward off threatening spread moves such as Astral Barrage, Water Spout, Electroweb, and Precipice Blades. Wide Guard can be switched out for Protect to avoid Fake Outs and other hits or Rock Slide for situations where teams need Rock-type coverage against Pokemon such as Yveltal and Volcarona. Chople Berry helps Stakataka survive Fighting-type hits from Urshifu-S, Urshifu-R, Mienshao, and Zacian-C. Safety Goggles can be an option to deal with Spore Amoonguss and Sleep Powder Venusaur, as well as ignoring Rage Powder from Amoonguss and Volcarona. Lastly, for more offensive variants, Life Orb is an option, boosting the power of Stakataka's already powerful attacks. The given EV spread allows Stakataka to survive a Helping Hand-boosted +2 Moonblast from Xerneas or a Life Orb- and Helping Hand-boosted Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S, as well as a chance of living Close Combat from Choice Band Urshifu-S and Urshifu-R should it be holding Chople Berry.

Follow Me is a great tool to protect frail partners such as Calyrex-S as they set up Substitute or wreak havoc with their powerful moves.

Urshifu-R makes a great common partner to restricted Pokemon such as Xerneas and Zacian-C by pressuring and taking down their common checks such as Volcarona, Incineroar, Stakataka. Furthermore partners such as Regieleki, Incineroar, and Rillaboom create an offensive core with good type coverage that universally fits on many teams and is capable to handling most Pokemon in the metagame; Fire-types like Incineroar, Volcarona, and Entei pair especially well to take care of the Grass-type Pokemon that cause a lot of problems to Urshifu-R such as Amoonguss, Tsareena, and Rillaboom.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Regieleki's astounding Speed and powerful Electric-type moves fueled by Transistor, along with it providing speed control with Electroweb, make it an excellent speedy attacker. Transistor allows Regieleki to hit deceptively hard and greatly threaten Pokemon like Kyogre and Tornadus. Thunderbolt 2HKOes Zacian-C and Urshifu-S, along with OHKOing any Urshifu-R without Focus Sash. Volt Switch is weaker than Thunderbolt, but it allows Regieleki to quickly switch out of disadvantageous situations and take advantage of opposing switches while still dealing damage, and it synergizes well with other pivoting Pokemon like Rillaboom and Incineroar. Electroweb is especially useful when considering Regieleki's great Speed, which allows it to lower the Speed of Pokemon like Calyrex-S before they can even move. Focus Sash circumvents Regieleki's poor bulk, and Protect allows it to preserve that Focus Sash. Regieleki is useless against Ground-types such as Landorus, so Pokemon that can handle them relatively well like Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, and Kyogre make great partners for it. Pokemon that appreciate it's speed control like Groudon are also good teammates, especially because Regieleki handles Kyogre for Groudon quite well. Regieleki's great Speed and offensive utility make it beneficial to almost any team archetype in the metagame.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Incredible bulk, one of the highest Attack stats in the metagame, a highly diverse movepool, and success both under and outside of Dynamax make Calyrex-I one of the premier Restricted Pokemon and Trick Room sweepers in the Series 11 metagame. Glacial Lance is arguably the best spread move in the game, and its synergy with As One allows Calyrex-I to quickly snowball under Trick Room, with very few Pokemon able to withstand a boosted attack. High Horsepower hits Fire- and Steel-types, which resist Glacial Lance, for super effective damage. Calyrex-I's third and fourth moveslots are more flexible. Heavy Slam is mainly useful under Dyanamax to hit opposing Calyrex-I, and it can pair with Max Quake to provide whichever defensive boosts are needed. Protect allows Calyrex-I to avoid damage, as opponents often focus on it to take it out quickly before it tears through teams, while Trick Room instead ensures that Calyrex-I isn't fully dependent on a partner to have a speed advantage. Many Calyrex-I opt for Weakness Policy as the item, which can work both with an activator partner or just taking foes' attacks, the latter being helped by Calyrex-I's immense bulk and several weaknesses. Other common options include Life Orb, which trades the massive damage potential of Weakness Policy for a more consistent offensive boost, and Lum Berry, which allows Calyrex-I to avoid burns and other statuses that are used to try and neutralize it. Other common set option include an Assault Vest set, which will typically run Close Combat alongside Heavy Slam in the final two moveslots, and faster sets on teams that use speed control methods other than Trick Room.</p> <p>Calyrex-I relies on several common partners to maximize its potential. It is most often run alongside a Trick Room setter: Dusclops and Mimikyu are common options that can support Calyrex-I with various moves, such as Haze on Dusclops to neutralize Intimidate drops and Safeguard on Mimikyu to deter status effects, as well as activating Weakness Policy with Shadow Sneak. Porygon2 has a less exhaustive support movepool but is much stronger against Calyrex-S teams due to not sharing a Ghost weakness with Calyrex-I like the Ghost-type setters do. Other common supportive partners for Calyrex-I include Tapu Fini, which protects Calyrex-I from status effects, redirectors such as Amoonguss, which can draw attention away from Calyrex-I while it sets up Trick Room or deals damage, and Fire-types like Incinceroar or Torkoal, which can pressure problematic Steel type Pokemon like Zacian-C, Solgaleo, and Necrozma-DM. Some teams will also opt for a secondary Dynamax or Gigantamax option that both covers some of Calyrex-I's weaknesses and gives the team an alternative \"fast mode\" that doesn't rely on Trick Room, like Venusaur (usually paired with Torkoal) or offensive Thundurus.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Calyrex-S is easily one of the most centralizing Restricted Pokemon in the current metagame thanks to a combination of immense Special Attack and Speed, Astral Barrage, and As One allowing it to snowball with each KO it takes. Astral Barrage is the main point of any Calyrex-S set, allowing it to potentially boost its Special Attack twice in a turn by KOing both foes on the field. Calyrex-S generally takes a Psychic-type STAB move as its second offensive move; Expanding Force is great when paired with a Psychic Terrain setter such as Tapu Lele or Indeedee-F, whereas Psyshock is an alternative option for teams without a Terrain setter. Shadow Ball allows Calyrex-S to ignore Wide Guard from the likes of Aegislash, Mienshao, and Stakataka while still doing great damage. Leaf Storm is a potential option that can be considered, but it is usually only recommended when the extra coverage is needed for Grass-weak Pokemon such as Kyogre and Groudon or when paired with Rillaboom. Substitute allows Calyrex-S to take advantage of turns where the opposing Pokemon are more passive into it, such as those where the foe uses Protect or switches. Encore allows Calyrex-S to discourage moves such as Zacian-C's Substitute and Incineroar's Fake Out, otherwise locking them into moves that render them effectively useless. Life Orb is a great item for Calyrex-S, as it boosts its damage further, giving it more opportunities to KO foes and gain boosts via As One. Focus Sash offers Calyrex-S a touch of longevity, as its otherwise mediocre bulk can be a downside. A Timid nature is mandatory on Calyrex-S, allowing it to outspeed Jolly Zacian-C.</p> <p>Calyrex-S pairs very effectively with Psychic Terrain setters such as Tapu Lele and Indeedee-F, increasing its damage output with Expanding Force as well as protecting it from otherwise lethal priority attacks like Urshifu-S's Sucker Punch and Aegislash's Shadow Sneak. For this reason, Tsareena can also be a good partner. Wide Guard users such as Mienshao and Stakataka are also great alongside Calyrex-S, as they are capable of blocking opposing Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and Incineroar's Snarl. Calyrex-S's main drawback is its quadruple weakness to common Dark-types such as Incineroar and Urshifu-S, making a partner such as Mienshao or Urshifu-R mandatory to beat them.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Item",
        "description": "<p>Calyrex-S is a great Choice item user thanks to its already great Special Attack and Speed and ability to output a high amount of spread damage via Astral Barrage. Calyrex-S also likes to carry a Psychic-type STAB move in order to take down Amoonguss and Porygon2 with more ease. Expanding Force allows Calyrex-S totake advantage of Psychic Terrain set by Tapu Lele or Indeedee-F, whereas Psyshock is a great alternative that doesn't rely on having Psychic Terrain while also hitting specially defensive Pokemon such as Volcarona and +2 Xerneas for more damage. Shadow Ball allows Calyrex-S to pressure common Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Mienshao with a Ghost-type STAB move. Mud Shot lets Calyrex-S fight its way through Incineroar, which would otherwise be unscathed by its other moves; Trick is an option to lock opposing Pokemon into moves they would rather not be locked into, such as Incineroar and Mienshao with Fake Out and Landorus with Substitute. Leaf Storm is an option that plays well into the likes of Groudon and Kyogre, as well as having a boosted move in Grassy Terrain with Rillaboom being so ubiquitous. Choice Specs is the best Choice item for Calyrex-S, as it typically does not need the extra Speed but very much appreciates additional damage giving it the chance to obtain more As One boosts. Choice Scarf allows Calyrex-S to act as solid cleaner while not having to worry about Speed tying opposing Calyrex-S.</p> <p>Calyrex-S loves being paired with Psychic Terrain setters such as Tapu Lele and Indeedee-F, allowing it to take advantage of Expanding Force, notably OHKOing Amoonguss and heavily pressuring Eternatus, while being protected from dangerous priority attacks such as Aegislash's Shadow Sneak. Without any means of surviving against opposing Calyrex-S Astral Barrage, Wide Guard users such as Mienshao and Stakataka make great partners for Calyrex-S. Calyrex-S also needs Pokemon that will help it through Dark-types such as Incineroar and Urshifu-S that would otherwise cause trouble for it when locked into a move it cannot hit them with, so partners such as Urshifu-R and Mienshao are advised. With Choice Specs giving such a hefty damage increase, a Tailwind user such as Whimsicott, Tornadus, or Talonflame can come in handy in order to guarantee that Calyrex-S will always get to fire off Astral Barrage first.</p> "
