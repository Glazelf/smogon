Grass Knot takes advantage of the heavy weight of the restricted Pokemon of the format, reaching maximum Base Power against Groudon, Kyogre, and Xerneas. Leaf Storm is not reliant on weight for its power, having a chance to OHKO Landorus with a Life Orb and a Modest nature. Sludge Bomb hits Xerneas and Tapu Lele as well as hitting Tapu Fini hard, which does not take much damage from Grass Knot due to its light weight. Sleep Powder disrupts the opposition and lets Venusaur disable Pokemon in unfavorable matchups. Earth Power is important to hit many Ground-weak-Pokemon such as Stakataka and Nihilego as well as other metagame staples such as Incineroar and Zacian-C for decent damage. Alternatively, sun-boosted Weather Ball threatens to deal much more damage to Zacian-C while also hitting Amoonguss hard. Life Orb enables Venusaur to OHKO Nihilego with Modest Earth Power, 2HKO Zacian-C with Earth Power, and OHKO Kyogre with Modest Grass Knot. Alternatively, Focus Sash gives up power for survivability, avoiding an OHKO from the likes of Incineroar, Zacian-C, and Volcarona. A Timid Venusaur outspeeds Regieleki in sun, but it fails to outspeed any other notable targets and gives up much appreciated power.</p> <p>Venusaur must be paired with a Drought setter, Torkoal or preferably Groudon, in order to activate Chlorophyll. Groudon greatly appreciates Venusaur's ability to threaten opposing Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Tsareena while it handles Fire types such as Incineroar for Venusaur. Venusaur is not a very good Kyogre check on its own, so be sure to add secondary Grass- or Electric-type checks such as Assault Vest Rillaboom, Tsareena, and Regieleki to your team. Nihilego and Incineroar are great teammates for Venusaur for their ability to check opposing Fire-types like Volcarona and Incineroar; in exchange, Venusaur can pick off many Ground-types-such as opposing Groudon for them.</p> "

Water Spout is the primary reason to Kyogre, being able to OHKO just about everything weak to it and still doing significant damage to some Pokemon that resist, notably still 2HKOing Miracle Seed Rillaboom. Hydro Pump, Scald, and Origin Pulse are Water-type STAB options that don't rely on Kyogre's HP to deal good damage. Hydro Pump is absolutely necessary for Timid Kyogre, as it is the only possible way to OHKO Calyrex-S outside of Tailwind. Both Hydro Pump and Scald notably bypass Wide Guard from the likes of Araquanid, Stakataka,and Mienshao with the latter also having a chance to burn, whereas Origin Pulse is a higher-Base Power alternative that allows Kyogre to continue hitting both targets at the cost of a significant amount of accuracy. Ice Beam is the primary coverage move for Kyogre, allowing it to do significant damage to Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Tsareena. Thunder is an option for opposing Kyogre; however, it is less advised due to its reliance on rain. A Timid nature allows Kyogre to naturally outspeed the likes of maximum Speed Rillaboom as well as Calyrex-S and Zacian-C at +1.</p> <p>Kyogre really appreciates Tailwind as speed control, as its base 90 Speed is less than ideal, underspeeding several common Pokemon such as Calyrex-S, Regieleki, Zacian-C, and Xerneas. As such, Tornadus is a must-have partner alongside Kyogre, as it can also fire off 100% accurate Hurricanes into the aforementioned Grass-types. Tsareena is also a great partner for Kyogre, as it is capable of blocking Fake Outs that would otherwise disrupt Kyogre, as well as protecting it from Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Regieleki works well with Kyogre, as its Thunder can't miss in rain and helps deal with opposing Kyogre and Tapu Fini. Like most Pokemon, Kyogre enjoys the presence of Fake Out users such as Incineroar that allow it to pin down KOs. Shedinja is a niche idea that works well with Kyogre, with its Ally Switch and Wonder Guard punishing foes at a moment's notice and Will-O-Wisp shutting down physical attackers such as Rillaboom, Urshifu-R, and Zacian-C.</p> "

Scald allows Kyogre to ignore Wide Guard from the likes of Araquanid, Stakataka, and Mienshao while still hitting hard with a Water-type STAB move. Origin Pulse is an alternative that allows Kyogre to deal spread damage while locked into a move at the cost of a bit of accuracy. Ice Beam gives Kyogre the necessary coverage to stand up to the likes of Tsareena and Rillaboom, notably 2HKOing both of them. Thunder is a potential option that Kyogre can use to duel opposing Kyogre, Tapu Fini, and Araquanid, with its perfect accuracy  in rain being a huge boon when locked into the move. Choice Scarf means Kyogre has less reliance on speed control to still do a good amount of damage, whereas Choice Specs will let it deal damage capable of OHKOing most unrestricted hits. The main drawback to a Choice item is that Kyogre cannot run Protect, leaving it susceptible to pins from Fake Out users such as Incineroar and Mienshao and Grassy Glide from Rillaboom.</p> <p>Tsareena is absolutely vital as a partner to a Choice-locked Kyogre, as without Protect it becomes extremely susceptible to Fake Out, Thudurus's Eerie Impulse, and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Tornadus is an invaluable partner to Kyogre, as its Tailwind allows Kyogre to fire off maximum power Water Spouts, often taking KOs before the foes can even move. Tornadus also benefits from Kyogre's Drizzle letting its Hurricane always hit in rain. Regieleki is a great partner that benefits from rain, with its Transistor-boosted Thunder capable of taking down opposing Kyogre and Tapu Fini with ease.</p> "

Drought strengthens Groudon's Heat Crash and weakens Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Kyogre and Urshifu-R, which can completely turn Groudon's matchup against these Pokemon around. Precipice Blades is very strong, capable of OHKOing Incineroar, Entei, and Tapu Lele while 2HKOing most other neutral targets. Heat Crash takes advantage of Groudon's massive weight to beat Grass-types such as Rillaboom, Tsareena, and Amoonguss. Swords Dance can offset Intimidate from the likes of Landorus-T and Incineroar and boost Groudon's Attack to insane levels, for example OHKOing Xerneas with +2 Precipice Blades. Substitute is an option over Swords Dance making it more difficult for Pokemon like Rillaboom to threaten Groudon. Life Orb gives Groudon a much appreciated power boost, allowing it to OHKO Zacian-C with Precipice Blades, Amoonguss, and Calyrex-S.</p> <p>Groudon's relatively average base 90 Speed often leaves it reliant on speed control such as Trick Room from Porygon2 and Stakataka, Electroweb from Regieleki, or Tailwind from Talonflame and Whimsicott. As Groudon is vulnerable to Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Venusaur, Fire-types like Incineroar and Volcarona pair well with it, and they also advantage of sun with their Fire-type attacks. Even in sun, Kyogre threatens Groudon for massive damage, so be sure to add Grass- and Electric-type teammates such as Assault Vest Rillaboom, Regieleki, and Venusaur to help check it. Venusaur is especially notable, as Drought enables its Chlorophyll, letting it outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and threaten Sleep Powder, as well as giving it access to a Fire-type Weather Ball. Tsareena is another solid teammate, keeping Groudon safe from priority attacks like Fake Out and Grassy Glide while threatening opposing Grass-types with Triple Axel.</p> "

Amoonguss will always carry Rage Powder, redirecting powerful attacks such as Zacian's Behemoth Blade and Regieleki's Thunder away from its common allies like Xerneas and Kyogre. Spore is used to disrupt the enemy team with sleep while also breaking Trick Room setups. Other options are Pollen Puff to heal your own Pokemon and Grass Knot to hit Groudon and Kyogre hard. Amoonguss will usually carry a Mental Herb to shake off Taunt from threats such as Whimsicott, Tornadus, and Incineroar, but it can also run an Occa Berry to survive Groudon's Heat Crash, Volcarona's Overheat, and Incineroar's Flare Blitz and put them to sleep in return. Regenerator provides Amoonguss longevity, while its EV spread makes it survive a +1 Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C and a Hurricane from Tornadus, although it can never survive a Calyrex-S Expanding Force. Unfortunately, Amoonguss's low offensive presence makes it rely heavily on its partners to deal significant damage. This makes Volcarona and Rillaboom often preferred over it.</p> <p>Amoonguss is a great partner for Zacian-C and Xerneas, since both Pokemon appreciate its redirection and support for setting up or preserving their health. Kyogre is another good option, since its rain weakens Fire-type moves. Fire-types such as Entei and Incineroar are also appreciated, since they can power through opposing Grass-types like Rillaboom and Tsareena easily, which can disrupt Amoonguss because they're immune to Rage Powder and Spore.

Close Combat does good damage, taking on the likes of Incineroar and Stakataka, and Mienshao isn't particularly affected by the defensive drops due to its already low defensive stats. Fake Out allows Mienshao to pin down opposing Pokemon for common partners such as Calyrex-S and Nihilego to attack them more freely, with Mienshao notably being able to use it before other common Fake Out users such as Incineroar and Rillaboom. Wide Guard is a must-have utility option that blocks some of the most threatening moves in the game like Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, Kyogre's Water Spout and Groudon's Precipice Blades. Feint breaking all forms of protection is particularly helpful alongside Calyrex-S, allowing it to click Astral Barrage against most Wide Guard users. Taunt allows Mienshao to disrupt other utility Pokemon such as Volcarona, Amoonguss, and Whimsicott. Knock Off applies heavy pressure to Dark-weak Pokemon such as Aegislash and Calyrex-S. Focus Sash makes up for Mienshao's lack of bulk being the only item viable as a result.

The HP investment allows Xerneas to always survive a Water Spout from Modest Choice Scarf Kyogre, while the Special Attack investment guarantees an OHKO on unboosted 4 HP Xerneas. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is crucial for outspeeding the plethora of Pokemon in or around the base 90 Speed tier, such as Groudon, Kyogre, Urshifu-R, and Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Xerneas needs a safe turn to set up Geomancy, and, as such, appreciates Pokemon like Incineroar, Rillaboom, and Volcarona that can support it with Fake Out or redirection. Additionally, the aforementioned Fire-types help it pressure two of its most common checks, Amoonguss and Zacian-C. Thundurus can cripple Xerneas with Eerie Impulse and Scary Face, so having a priority blocker like Tsareena, Indeedee-F, or Tapu Lele is helpful to allow Xerneas to set up safely. Landorus is also an excellent Xerneas partner, as it cleanly OHKOes common Xerneas checks such as Entei, Stakataka, Incineroar, and Zacian-C with Earth Power.</p> "

Focus Sash is the preferred item on Urshifu-S due to its poor Special Defense and weaknesses, which would let Pokemon like Xerneas, Urshifu-R, and Zacian-C OHKO it otherwise. Life Orb gives Urshifu-S significantly more power, letting it OHKO Tornadus and physically defensive Incineroar. Choice Scarf lets it outpace Mienshao, Calyrex-S, and Nihilego, and Choice Band gives it the power to OHKO Landorus and specially defensive Incineroar after Intimidate. Choice item sets have the awful drawback of not being able to use Detect, making them significantly easier to play around.</p> <p>Urshifu-S appreciates Tailwind support from common users such as Tornadus and Whimsicott to outspeed threats to itself such as Mienshao, Regieleki, and Nihilego. Zacian-C is good alongside Urshifu-S for its ability to thwart Yveltal, Xerneas, and Tapu Fini, while Urshifu-S can hit Incineroar and Landorus-T for Zacian-C. Regieleki can help keep Urshifu-R and Mienshao in check for Urshifu-S as well giving it speed control with Electroweb. Fake Out users such as Rillaboom, Incineroar, and Gothitelle are fearsome alongside Urshifu-S due to Fake Out pinning down threats such as Xerneas, Landorus, and Zacian-C, allowing Urshifu-S to target the opposition more freely with its Protect-ignoring attacks.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Urshifu-R is a very solid offensive threat thanks to high base 130 Attack stat ability to ignore Protect with Unseen Fist. Surging Strikes is Urshifu-R's best attack, with its guaranteed critical hits ignoring Attack drops from common Intimidate users such as Incineroar and Landorus-T while also heavily pressuring both of them. Close Combat is the strongest Fighting-type STAB move that Urshifu-R has, allowing it to pressure a large part of the metagame and take on Pokemon that could survive Surging Strikes, such as Stakataka. Aqua Jet offers Urshifu-R a priority option to pressure and deal non-negligible damage to powerful and faster threats like Regieleki and Landorus. Focus Sash is Urshifu-R's primary item, somewhat negating it's otherwise lackluster Special Defense. An alternative spread of 140 HP / 236 SpD / 132 Spe with Adamant nature and Mystic Water allows Urshifu-R to hit even harder with Surging Strikes while also taking strong attacks such as Assault Vest Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, unboosted Xerneas's Dazzling Gleam, and Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. Urshifu-R makes a great common partner to restricted Pokemon such as Xerneas and Zacian by pressuring and taking down their common checks such as Volcarona, Incineroar, Stakataka. Furthermore partners such as Regieleki, Incineroar, and Rillaboom create an offensive core with good type coverage that universally fits on many teams and is capable to handling most Pokemon in the metagame; Fire-types like Incineroar, Volcarona, and Entei pair especially well to take care of the Grass-type Pokemon that cause a lot of problems to Urshifu-R such as Amoonguss, Tsareena, and Rillaboom.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Regieleki's astounding Speed and powerful Electric-type moves fueled by Transistor, along with it providing speed control with Electroweb, make it an excellent speedy attacker. Transistor allows Regieleki to hit deceptively hard and greatly threaten Pokemon like Kyogre and Tornadus. Thunderbolt 2HKOes Zacian-C and Urshifu-S, along with OHKOing any Urshifu-R without Focus Sash. Volt Switch is weaker than Thunderbolt, but it allows Regieleki to quickly switch out of disadvantageous situations and take advantage of opposing switches while still dealing damage, and it synergizes well with other pivoting Pokemon like Rillaboom and Incineroar. Electroweb is especially useful when considering Regieleki's great Speed, which allows it to lower the Speed of Pokemon like Calyrex-S before they can even move. Focus Sash circumvents Regieleki's poor bulk, and Protect allows it to preserve that Focus Sash. Regieleki is useless against Ground-types such as Landorus, so Pokemon that can handle them relatively well like Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, and Kyogre make great partners for it. Pokemon that appreciate it's speed control like Groudon are also good teammates, especially because Regieleki handles Kyogre for Groudon quite well. Regieleki's great Speed and offensive utility make it beneficial to almost any team archetype in the metagame.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Calyrex-S is easily one of the most centralizing Restricted Pokemon in the current metagame thanks to a combination of immense Special Attack and Speed, Astral Barrage, and As One allowing it to snowball with each KO it takes. Astral Barrage is the main point of any Calyrex-S set, allowing it to potentially boost its Special Attack twice in a turn by KOing both foes on the field. Calyrex-S generally takes a Psychic-type STAB move as its second offensive move; Expanding Force is great when paired with a Psychic Terrain setter such as Tapu Lele or Indeedee-F, whereas Psyshock is an alternative option for teams without a Terrain setter. Shadow Ball allows Calyrex-S to ignore Wide Guard from the likes of Aegislash, Mienshao, and Stakataka while still doing great damage. Leaf Storm is a potential option that can be considered, but it is usually only recommended when the extra coverage is needed for Grass-weak Pokemon such as Kyogre and Groudon or when paired with Rillaboom. Substitute allows Calyrex-S to take advantage of turns where the opposing Pokemon are more passive into it, such as those where the foe uses Protect or switches. Encore allows Calyrex-S to discourage moves such as Zacian-C's Substitute and Incineroar's Fake Out, otherwise locking them into moves that render them effectively useless. Life Orb is a great item for Calyrex-S, as it boosts its damage further, giving it more opportunities to KO foes and gain boosts via As One. Focus Sash offers Calyrex-S a touch of longevity, as its otherwise mediocre bulk can be a downside. A Timid nature is mandatory on Calyrex-S, allowing it to outspeed Jolly Zacian-C.</p> <p>Calyrex-S pairs very effectively with Psychic Terrain setters such as Tapu Lele and Indeedee-F, increasing its damage output with Expanding Force as well as protecting it from otherwise lethal priority attacks like Urshifu-S's Sucker Punch and Aegislash's Shadow Sneak. For this reason, Tsareena can also be a good partner. Wide Guard users such as Mienshao and Stakataka are also great alongside Calyrex-S, as they are capable of blocking opposing Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and Incineroar's Snarl. Calyrex-S's main drawback is its quadruple weakness to common Dark-types such as Incineroar and Urshifu-S, making a partner such as Mienshao or Urshifu-R mandatory to beat them.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Calyrex-S is a great Choice item user thanks to its already great Special Attack and Speed and ability to output a high amount of spread damage via Astral Barrage. Calyrex-S also likes to carry a Psychic-type STAB move in order to take down Amoonguss and Porygon2 with more ease. Expanding Force allows Calyrex-S totake advantage of Psychic Terrain set by Tapu Lele or Indeedee-F, whereas Psyshock is a great alternative that doesn't rely on having Psychic Terrain while also hitting specially defensive Pokemon such as Volcarona and +2 Xerneas for more damage. Shadow Ball allows Calyrex-S to pressure common Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Mienshao with a Ghost-type STAB move. Mud Shot lets Calyrex-S fight its way through Incineroar, which would otherwise be unscathed by its other moves; Trick is an option to lock opposing Pokemon into moves they would rather not be locked into, such as Incineroar and Mienshao with Fake Out and Landorus with Substitute. Leaf Storm is an option that plays well into the likes of Groudon and Kyogre, as well as having a boosted move in Grassy Terrain with Rillaboom being so ubiquitous. Choice Specs is the best Choice item for Calyrex-S, as it typically does not need the extra Speed but very much appreciates additional damage giving it the chance to obtain more As One boosts. Choice Scarf allows Calyrex-S to act as solid cleaner while not having to worry about Speed tying opposing Calyrex-S.</p> <p>Calyrex-S loves being paired with Psychic Terrain setters such as Tapu Lele and Indeedee-F, allowing it to take advantage of Expanding Force, notably OHKOing Amoonguss and heavily pressuring Eternatus, while being protected from dangerous priority attacks such as Aegislash's Shadow Sneak. Without any means of surviving against opposing Calyrex-S Astral Barrage, Wide Guard users such as Mienshao and Stakataka make great partners for Calyrex-S. Calyrex-S also needs Pokemon that will help it through Dark-types such as Incineroar and Urshifu-S that would otherwise cause trouble for it when locked into a move it cannot hit them with, so partners such as Urshifu-R and Mienshao are advised. With Choice Specs giving such a hefty damage increase, a Tailwind user such as Whimsicott, Tornadus, or Talonflame can come in handy in order to guarantee that Calyrex-S will always get to fire off Astral Barrage first.</p> "
