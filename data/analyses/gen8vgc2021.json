        "description": "<p>Kyogre is one of the most threatening Restricted Pokemon in the metagame thanks to Water Spout's high Base Power, Kyogre's amazing base 150 Special Attack, and rain from Drizzle boosting Water Spout's damage even further. Water Spout is the primary reason to Kyogre, being able to OHKO just about everything weak to it and still doing significant damage to some Pokemon that resist, notably still 2HKOing Miracle Seed Rillaboom. Hydro Pump, Scald, and Origin Pulse are Water-type STAB options that don't rely on Kyogre's HP to deal good damage. Hydro Pump is absolutely necessary for Timid Kyogre, as it is the only possible way to OHKO Calyrex-S outside of Tailwind. Both Hydro Pump and Scald notably bypass Wide Guard from the likes of Araquanid, Stakataka,and Mienshao with the latter also having a chance to burn, whereas Origin Pulse is a higher-Base Power alternative that allows Kyogre to continue hitting both targets at the cost of a significant amount of accuracy. Ice Beam is the primary coverage move for Kyogre, allowing it to do significant damage to Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Tsareena. Thunder is an option for opposing Kyogre; however, it is less advised due to its reliance on rain. A Timid nature allows Kyogre to naturally outspeed the likes of maximum Speed Rillaboom as well as Calyrex-S and Zacian-C at +1.</p> <p>Kyogre really appreciates Tailwind as speed control, as its base 90 Speed is less than ideal, underspeeding several common Pokemon such as Calyrex-S, Regieleki, Zacian-C, and Xerneas. As such, Tornadus is a must-have partner alongside Kyogre, as it can also fire off 100% accurate Hurricanes into the aforementioned Grass-types. Tsareena is also a great partner for Kyogre, as it is capable of blocking Fake Outs that would otherwise disrupt Kyogre, as well as protecting it from Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Regieleki works well with Kyogre, as its Thunder can't miss in rain and helps deal with opposing Kyogre and Tapu Fini. Like most Pokemon, Kyogre enjoys the presence of Fake Out users such as Incineroar that allow it to pin down KOs. Shedinja is a niche idea that works well with Kyogre, with its Ally Switch and Wonder Guard punishing foes at a moment's notice and Will-O-Wisp shutting down physical attackers such as Rillaboom, Urshifu-R, and Zacian-C.</p> "

Water Spout hits immensely hard, notably extinguishing the likes of Incineroar, Landorus, and Jolly Zacian-C, at the expense of its Base Power being reliant on Kyogre staying healthy. Scald allows Kyogre to ignore Wide Guard from the likes of Araquanid, Stakataka, and Mienshao while still hitting hard with a Water-type STAB move. Origin Pulse is an alternative that allows Kyogre to deal spread damage while locked into a move at the cost of a bit of accuracy. Ice Beam gives Kyogre the necessary coverage to stand up to the likes of Tsareena and Rillaboom, notably 2HKOing both of them. Thunder is a potential option that Kyogre can use to duel opposing Kyogre, Tapu Fini, and Araquanid, with its perfect accuracy  in rain being a huge boon when locked into the move. Choice Scarf means Kyogre has less reliance on speed control to still do a good amount of damage, whereas Choice Specs will let it deal damage capable of OHKOing most unrestricted hits. The main drawback to a Choice item is that Kyogre cannot run Protect, leaving it susceptible to pins from Fake Out users such as Incineroar and Mienshao and Grassy Glide from Rillaboom.</p> <p>Tsareena is absolutely vital as a partner to a Choice-locked Kyogre, as without Protect it becomes extremely susceptible to Fake Out, Thudurus's Eerie Impulse, and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Tornadus is an invaluable partner to Kyogre, as its Tailwind allows Kyogre to fire off maximum power Water Spouts, often taking KOs before the foes can even move. Tornadus also benefits from Kyogre's Drizzle letting its Hurricane always hit in rain. Regieleki is a great partner that benefits from rain, with its Transistor-boosted Thunder capable of taking down opposing Kyogre and Tapu Fini with ease.</p> "

Drought strengthens Groudon's Heat Crash and weakens Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Kyogre and Urshifu-R, which can completely turn Groudon's matchup against these Pokemon around. Precipice Blades is very strong, capable of OHKOing Incineroar, Entei, and Tapu Lele while 2HKOing most other neutral targets. Heat Crash takes advantage of Groudon's massive weight to beat Grass-types such as Rillaboom, Tsareena, and Amoonguss. Swords Dance can offset Intimidate from the likes of Landorus-T and Incineroar and boost Groudon's Attack to insane levels, for example OHKOing Xerneas with +2 Precipice Blades. Substitute is an option over Swords Dance making it more difficult for Pokemon like Rillaboom to threaten Groudon. Life Orb gives Groudon a much appreciated power boost, allowing it to OHKO Zacian-C with Precipice Blades, Amoonguss, and Calyrex-S.</p> <p>Groudon's relatively average base 90 Speed often leaves it reliant on speed control such as Trick Room from Porygon2 and Stakataka, Electroweb from Regieleki, or Tailwind from Talonflame and Whimsicott. As Groudon is vulnerable to Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Venusaur, Fire-types like Incineroar and Volcarona pair well with it, and they also advantage of sun with their Fire-type attacks. Even in sun, Kyogre threatens Groudon for massive damage, so be sure to add Grass- and Electric-type teammates such as Assault Vest Rillaboom, Regieleki, and Venusaur to help check it. Venusaur is especially notable, as Drought enables its Chlorophyll, letting it outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and threaten Sleep Powder, as well as giving it access to a Fire-type Weather Ball. Tsareena is another solid teammate, keeping Groudon safe from priority attacks like Fake Out and Grassy Glide while threatening opposing Grass-types with Triple Axel.</p> "

Clear Smog resets the boosts of Geomancy Xerneas and Cosmic Power Eternatus. Amoonguss will always carry Rage Powder, redirecting powerful attacks such as Zacian's Behemoth Blade and Regieleki's Thunder away from its common allies like Xerneas and Kyogre. Spore is used to disrupt the enemy team with sleep while also breaking Trick Room setups. Other options are Pollen Puff to heal your own Pokemon and Grass Knot to hit Groudon and Kyogre hard. Amoonguss will usually carry a Mental Herb to shake off Taunt from threats such as Whimsicott, Tornadus, and Incineroar, but it can also run an Occa Berry to survive Groudon's Heat Crash, Volcarona's Overheat, and Incineroar's Flare Blitz and put them to sleep in return. Regenerator provides Amoonguss longevity, while its EV spread makes it survive a +1 Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C and a Hurricane from Tornadus, although it can never survive a Calyrex-S Expanding Force. Unfortunately, Amoonguss's low offensive presence makes it rely heavily on its partners to deal significant damage. This makes Volcarona and Rillaboom often preferred over it.</p> <p>Amoonguss is a great partner for Zacian-C and Xerneas, since both Pokemon appreciate its redirection and support for setting up or preserving their health. Kyogre is another good option, since its rain weakens Fire-type moves. Fire-types such as Entei and Incineroar are also appreciated, since they can power through opposing Grass-types like Rillaboom and Tsareena easily, which can disrupt Amoonguss because they're immune to Rage Powder and Spore. Landorus, Palkia, and Urshifu-R are other good allies to KO opposing Fire-type Pokemon such as Incineroar and Volcarona.</p> "

Close Combat does good damage, taking on the likes of Incineroar and Stakataka, and Mienshao isn't particularly affected by the defensive drops due to its already low defensive stats. Fake Out allows Mienshao to pin down opposing Pokemon for common partners such as Calyrex-S and Nihilego to attack them more freely, with Mienshao notably being able to use it before other common Fake Out users such as Incineroar and Rillaboom. Wide Guard is a must-have utility option that blocks some of the most threatening moves in the game like Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, Kyogre's Water Spout and Groudon's Precipice Blades. Feint breaking all forms of protection is particularly helpful alongside Calyrex-S, allowing it to click Astral Barrage against most Wide Guard users. Taunt allows Mienshao to disrupt other utility Pokemon such as Volcarona, Amoonguss, and Whimsicott. Knock Off applies heavy pressure to Dark-weak Pokemon such as Aegislash and Calyrex-S. Focus Sash makes up for Mienshao's lack of bulk being the only item viable as a result. Helping Hand is a potential option to boost Mienshao's teammate in situations where its own damage is going to be limited; however this typically means giving up a more valuable utility move.</p> <p>Mienshao's utility can fit onto a wide array of teams, but it is mostly used alongside Calyrex-S. Mienshao's Close Combat is able to pressure two of Calyrex-S's best checks in Incineroar and Urshifu-S, and it also provides Wide Guard for opposing Calyrex-S alongside Feint. Nihilego also appreciates Mienshao, as Fake Out and Feint offer it the best chance to land a Meteor Beam for a crucial Special Attack boost, and it enjoys being protected from Kyogre's Water Spout, Landorus-T's Earthquake, and Groudon's Precipice Blades, which would all otherwise OHKO it. Whimsicott is another Pokemon that appreciates Mienshao's fast Fake Out support, being able to typically safely set up Tailwind as a result.</p> "

Tailwind also allows Tsareena, another common teammate, to outspeed Landorus and Kyogre. Taunt prevents Trick Room from users such as Stakataka while also shutting down Spore from Amoonguss and Geomancy from Xerneas. Tornadus can run Icy Wind or Rain Dance over Protect; however, it loses its ability to avoid Fake Out and can easily be OHKOed by Pokemon such as Regieleki. Icy Wind provides coverage and speed control, comfortably 2HKOing Pokemon such as Landorus and letting Tornadus control the game's pace if hit by taunt. Rain Dance is useful when playing against Groudon and Torkoal, resetting the weather for Kyogre and weakening Groudon's Heat Crash and Torkoal's Eruption. Focus Sash allows Tornadus to survive Regieleki's Thunderbolt and Volt Switch as well as powerful moves such as Kyogre's Water Spout.

Some Stakataka choose to use an offensively oriented EV spread with 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD, especially if holding Life Orb.</p> <p>Stakataka loves Fake Out users to help it set up Trick Room, so Incineroar and Rillaboom work magnificently —Rillaboom more so, as they cover each other's weaknesses very well. Stakataka also appreciates redirection to help with setting up Trick Room, so Indeedee-F, Volcarona, and Amoonguss are great with it as well. Stakataka also pairs well with Groudon and Palkia, as Stakataka covers Xerneas and Yveltal for them and uses Wide Guard to block threatening spread moves. Groudon covers Stakataka's Water weakness with Drought, while Palkia covers Stakataka's Ground weakness with STAB Water-type attacks to threaten Groudon, Landorus, and Landorus-T.</p> "

Grassy Glide allows Rillaboom to immediately check faster threats such as Regieleki and Urshifu-R while being its primary STAB move. Wood Hammer can OHKO Nihilego, bulky Kyogre, and Groudon while avoiding Tsareena's Queenly Majesty. Knock Off is an alternative move to get rid of items such as Xerneas's Power Herb and Incineroar's Figy Berry while also threatening Calyrex-S and Shedinja. Fake Out is a great tool for regaining momentum, stopping opposing setup such as Tornadus's Tailwind while leaving their users open for attacks from Rillaboom's allies. U-turn lets Rillaboom pivot in and out while recycling its Fake Out and Grassy Terrain. This EV spread, together with the Assault Vest, allows Rillaboom to live +2 Xerneas's Moonblast and comfortably take Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage.</p> <p>Rillaboom can partner with everything and do well due to its pressure and damage, but notable Restricted partners are Zacian-C and Xerneas, since they appreciate Fake Out pressure to set up Substitute or Geomancy, respectively. Groudon also appreciates Rillaboom, since it keeps Kyogre in check. As for non-Restricted partners, Fire-types such as Incineroar and Entei are appreciated to break through Grass-types that could wall Rillaboom, such as Tsareena and Amoonguss. Urshifu-R and Landorus are also good partners, since they can easily deal with Incineroar and Volcarona.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Zacian-C's monstrous stats, solid defensive typing, and immediately threatening power due to Intrepid Sword make it one of the best Restricted Pokemon in the Series 10 metagame. Behemoth Blade is a consistent STAB move that makes swift work of the likes of Xerneas and Tapu Lele while even threatening OHKOs on neutral targets such as Calyrex-S and Landorus. Sacred Sword and Close Combat let Zacian-C dent Pokemon that resist its Behemoth Blade such as Incineroar, Regieleki, and Entei. Sacred Sword is noticeably weaker than Close Combat; however, the lack of defense dropping can be crucial for Zacian-C's longevity. On the other hand, Close Combat is useful for OHKOing Stakataka and physically defensive Incineroar at +1 Attack. Substitute is an excellent move for Zacian-C, keeping it safe from Intimidate, Fake Out, and status, and it capitalizes well on opponents looking to play around it defensively. Play Rough as a third attack notably hits the likes of Thundurus, Urshifu-R, and Zapdos, which don't particularly mind taking a Behemoth Blade or Fighting-type coverage move. Swords Dance is a fringe option that gives Zacian-C another way to counteract Intimidate, and it typically gives the user an excuse to invest more in its bulk. The given EV spread simply allows Zacian-C to make four Substitutes, with the Attack investment still allowing it to always OHKO 4 HP Calyrex-S with Behemoth Blade.</p> <p>Zacian-C works best when it can be brought into battle safely, and, as such, it appreciates being paired with pivots like Incineroar, Rillaboom, and Regieleki. These pivots can also provide it with various means of offensive support such as Fake Out, Electroweb, Dark-type coverage for Calyrex-S, and Grass- and Electric-type coverage for Kyogre. Landorus, Urshifu-R, and Landorus-T all pressure Incineroar, which is great for keeping Zacian-C's Attack as high as possible while in battle. It is worth noting, however, that Zacian-C is a fairly low-maintenance Pokemon and can work with almost any viable Pokemon as a partner.</p> "

Wicked Blow ignoring Intimidate lets Urshifu-S click an attack unfazed by the likes of Incineroar and Landorus-T, and it also nails Calyrex-S, Lunala, and Indeedee-F. Sucker Punch is strong priority that threatens an OHKO on Calyrex-S and a 2HKO on Regieleki. Detect is used over Protect to deal with Imprison users that run Protect such as Zacian-C and Calyrex-S. Focus Sash is the preferred item on Urshifu-S due to its poor Special Defense and weaknesses, which would let Pokemon like Xerneas, Urshifu-R, and Zacian-C OHKO it otherwise. Life Orb gives Urshifu-S significantly more power, letting it OHKO Tornadus and physically defensive Incineroar. Choice Scarf lets it outpace Mienshao, Calyrex-S, and Nihilego, and Choice Band gives it the power to OHKO Landorus and specially defensive Incineroar after Intimidate. Choice item sets have the awful drawback of not being able to use Detect, making them significantly easier to play around.</p> <p>Urshifu-S appreciates Tailwind support from common users such as Tornadus and Whimsicott to outspeed threats to itself such as Mienshao, Regieleki, and Nihilego. Zacian-C is good alongside Urshifu-S for its ability to thwart Yveltal, Xerneas, and Tapu Fini, while Urshifu-S can hit Incineroar and Landorus-T for Zacian-C. Regieleki can help keep Urshifu-R and Mienshao in check for Urshifu-S as well giving it speed control with Electroweb. Fake Out users such as Rillaboom, Incineroar, and Gothitelle are fearsome alongside Urshifu-S due to Fake Out pinning down threats such as Xerneas, Landorus, and Zacian-C, allowing Urshifu-S to target the opposition more freely with its Protect-ignoring attacks.</p> "

Transistor allows Regieleki to hit deceptively hard and greatly threaten Pokemon like Kyogre and Tornadus. Thunderbolt 2HKOes Zacian-C and Urshifu-S, along with OHKOing any Urshifu-R without Focus Sash. Volt Switch is weaker than Thunderbolt, but it allows Regieleki to quickly switch out of disadvantageous situations and take advantage of opposing switches while still dealing damage, and it synergizes well with other pivoting Pokemon like Rillaboom and Incineroar. Electroweb is especially useful when considering Regieleki's great Speed, which allows it to lower the Speed of Pokemon like Calyrex-S before they can even move. Focus Sash circumvents Regieleki's poor bulk, and Protect allows it to preserve that Focus Sash. Regieleki is useless against Ground-types such as Landorus, so Pokemon that can handle them relatively well like Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, and Kyogre make great partners for it. Pokemon that appreciate it's speed control like Groudon are also good teammates, especially because Regieleki handles Kyogre for Groudon quite well.

Astral Barrage is the main point of any Calyrex-S set, allowing it to potentially boost its Special Attack twice in a turn by KOing both foes on the field. Calyrex-S generally takes a Psychic-type STAB move as its second offensive move; Expanding Force is great when paired with a Psychic Terrain setter such as Tapu Lele or Indeedee-F, whereas Psyshock is an alternative option for teams without a Terrain setter. Shadow Ball allows Calyrex-S to ignore Wide Guard from the likes of Aegislash, Mienshao, and Stakataka while still doing great damage. Leaf Storm is a potential option that can be considered, but it is usually only recommended when the extra coverage is needed for Grass-weak Pokemon such as Kyogre and Groudon or when paired with Rillaboom. Substitute allows Calyrex-S to take advantage of turns where the opposing Pokemon are more passive into it, such as those where the foe uses Protect or switches. Encore allows Calyrex-S to discourage moves such as Zacian-C's Substitute and Incineroar's Fake Out, otherwise locking them into moves that render them effectively useless. Life Orb is a great item for Calyrex-S, as it boosts its damage further, giving it more opportunities to KO foes and gain boosts via As One. Focus Sash offers Calyrex-S a touch of longevity, as its otherwise mediocre bulk can be a downside. A Timid nature is mandatory on Calyrex-S, allowing it to outspeed Jolly Zacian-C.</p> <p>Calyrex-S pairs very effectively with Psychic Terrain setters such as Tapu Lele and Indeedee-F, increasing its damage output with Expanding Force as well as protecting it from otherwise lethal priority attacks like Urshifu-S's Sucker Punch and Aegislash's Shadow Sneak. For this reason, Tsareena can also be a good partner. Wide Guard users such as Mienshao and Stakataka are also great alongside Calyrex-S, as they are capable of blocking opposing Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and Incineroar's Snarl. Calyrex-S's main drawback is its quadruple weakness to common Dark-types such as Incineroar and Urshifu-S, making a partner such as Mienshao or Urshifu-R mandatory to beat them.</p> "

Calyrex-S also likes to carry a Psychic-type STAB move in order to take down Amoonguss and Porygon2 with more ease. Expanding Force allows Calyrex-S totake advantage of Psychic Terrain set by Tapu Lele or Indeedee-F, whereas Psyshock is a great alternative that doesn't rely on having Psychic Terrain while also hitting specially defensive Pokemon such as Volcarona and +2 Xerneas for more damage. Shadow Ball allows Calyrex-S to pressure common Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Mienshao with a Ghost-type STAB move. Mud Shot lets Calyrex-S fight its way through Incineroar, which would otherwise be unscathed by its other moves; Trick is an option to lock opposing Pokemon into moves they would rather not be locked into, such as Incineroar and Mienshao with Fake Out and Landorus with Substitute. Leaf Storm is an option that plays well into the likes of Groudon and Kyogre, as well as having a boosted move in Grassy Terrain with Rillaboom being so ubiquitous. Choice Specs is the best Choice item for Calyrex-S, as it typically does not need the extra Speed but very much appreciates additional damage giving it the chance to obtain more As One boosts. Choice Scarf allows Calyrex-S to act as solid cleaner while not having to worry about Speed tying opposing Calyrex-S.</p> <p>Calyrex-S loves being paired with Psychic Terrain setters such as Tapu Lele and Indeedee-F, allowing it to take advantage of Expanding Force, notably OHKOing Amoonguss and heavily pressuring Eternatus, while being protected from dangerous priority attacks such as Aegislash's Shadow Sneak. Without any means of surviving against opposing Calyrex-S Astral Barrage, Wide Guard users such as Mienshao and Stakataka make great partners for Calyrex-S. Calyrex-S also needs Pokemon that will help it through Dark-types such as Incineroar and Urshifu-S that would otherwise cause trouble for it when locked into a move it cannot hit them with, so partners such as Urshifu-R and Mienshao are advised. With Choice Specs giving such a hefty damage increase, a Tailwind user such as Whimsicott, Tornadus, or Talonflame can come in handy in order to guarantee that Calyrex-S will always get to fire off Astral Barrage first.</p> "
