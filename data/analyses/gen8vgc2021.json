        "description": "<p>Groudon threatens nearly the whole metagame with its Ground- and Fire-type coverage from its base 150 Attack stat; additionally, its solid natural bulk makes it difficult to remove quickly. Drought strengthens Groudon's Heat Crash and weakens Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Kyogre and Urshifu-R, which can completely turn Groudon's matchup against these Pokemon around. Precipice Blades is very strong, capable of OHKOing Incineroar, Entei, and Tapu Lele while 2HKOing most other neutral targets. Heat Crash takes advantage of Groudon's massive weight to beat Grass-types such as Rillaboom, Tsareena, and Amoonguss. Swords Dance can offset Intimidate from the likes of Landorus-T and Incineroar and boost Groudon's Attack to insane levels, for example OHKOing Xerneas with +2 Precipice Blades. Substitute is an option over Swords Dance making it more difficult for Pokemon like Rillaboom to threaten Groudon. Life Orb gives Groudon a much appreciated power boost, allowing it to OHKO Zacian-C with Precipice Blades, Amoonguss, and Calyrex-S.</p> <p>Groudon's relatively average base 90 Speed often leaves it reliant on speed control such as Trick Room from Porygon2 and Stakataka, Electroweb from Regieleki, or Tailwind from Talonflame and Whimsicott. As Groudon is vulnerable to Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Venusaur, Fire-types like Incineroar and Volcarona pair well with it, and they also advantage of sun with their Fire-type attacks. Even in sun, Kyogre threatens Groudon for massive damage, so be sure to add Grass- and Electric-type teammates such as Assault Vest Rillaboom, Regieleki, and Venusaur to help check it. Venusaur is especially notable, as Drought enables its Chlorophyll, letting it outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and threaten Sleep Powder, as well as giving it access to a Fire-type Weather Ball. Tsareena is another solid teammate, keeping Groudon safe from priority attacks like Fake Out and Grassy Glide while threatening opposing Grass-types with Triple Axel.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Rillaboom's good matchup against restricted Pokemon such as Kyogre and Xerneas, and its Grassy Terrain-boosted Grassy Glide, makes it a great Pokemon in the format. Grassy Glide allows Rillaboom to immediately check faster threats such as Regieleki and Urshifu-R while being its primary STAB move. Wood Hammer can OHKO Nihilego, bulky Kyogre, and Groudon while avoiding Tsareena's Queenly Majesty. Knock Off is an alternative move to get rid of items such as Xerneas's Power Herb and Incineroar's Figy Berry while also threatening Calyrex-S and Shedinja. Fake Out is a great tool for regaining momentum, stopping opposing setup such as Tornadus's Tailwind while leaving their users open for attacks from Rillaboom's allies. U-turn lets Rillaboom pivot in and out while recycling its Fake Out and Grassy Terrain. This EV spread, together with the Assault Vest, allows Rillaboom to live +2 Xerneas's Moonblast and comfortably take Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage.</p> <p>Rillaboom can partner with everything and do well due to its pressure and damage, but notable Restricted partners are Zacian-C and Xerneas, since they appreciate Fake Out pressure to set up Substitute or Geomancy, respectively. Groudon also appreciates Rillaboom, since it keeps Kyogre in check. As for non-Restricted partners, Fire-types such as Incineroar and Entei are appreciated to break through Grass-types that could wall Rillaboom, such as Tsareena and Amoonguss. Urshifu-R and Landorus are also good partners, since they can easily deal with Incineroar and Volcarona.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Zacian-C's monstrous stats, solid defensive typing, and immediately threatening power due to Intrepid Sword make it one of the best Restricted Pokemon in the Series 10 metagame. Behemoth Blade is a consistent STAB move that makes swift work of the likes of Xerneas and Tapu Lele while even threatening OHKOs on neutral targets such as Calyrex-S and Landorus. Sacred Sword and Close Combat let Zacian-C dent Pokemon that resist its Behemoth Blade such as Incineroar, Regieleki, and Entei. Sacred Sword is noticeably weaker than Close Combat; however, the lack of defense dropping can be crucial for Zacian-C's longevity. On the other hand, Close Combat is useful for OHKOing Stakataka and physically defensive Incineroar at +1 Attack. Substitute is an excellent move for Zacian-C, keeping it safe from Intimidate, Fake Out, and status, and it capitalizes well on opponents looking to play around it defensively. Play Rough as a third attack notably hits the likes of Thundurus, Urshifu-R, and Zapdos, which don't particularly mind taking a Behemoth Blade or Fighting-type coverage move. Swords Dance is a fringe option that gives Zacian-C another way to counteract Intimidate, and it typically gives the user an excuse to invest more in its bulk. The given EV spread simply allows Zacian-C to make four Substitutes, with the Attack investment still allowing it to always OHKO 4 HP Calyrex-S with Behemoth Blade.</p> <p>Zacian-C works best when it can be brought into battle safely, and, as such, it appreciates being paired with pivots like Incineroar, Rillaboom, and Regieleki. These pivots can also provide it with various means of offensive support such as Fake Out, Electroweb, Dark-type coverage for Calyrex-S, and Grass- and Electric-type coverage for Kyogre. Landorus, Urshifu-R, and Landorus-T all pressure Incineroar, which is great for keeping Zacian-C's Attack as high as possible while in battle. It is worth noting, however, that Zacian-C is a fairly low-maintenance Pokemon and can work with almost any viable Pokemon as a partner.</p> "
