    "overview": "<p>Venusaur is an excellent Grass-type attacker when paired with sun setters like Torkoal. With a Chlorophyll boost, it can outspeed some of the metagame's fastest threats like Regieleki, Pheromosa, and Dragapult. Venusaur has an incredible offensive and supportive presence, as it can either wear down foes over the course of a game with G-Max Vine Lash and immobilize threats with a fast Sleep Powder. It also has access to both Max Quake and Max Ooze to boost its Special Defense and Special Attack in addition to its already great natural bulk. It's this wide array of options that can make Venusaur very hard to predict against. However, Venusaur is far less effective if sun is not active, meaning it can struggle against Pokemon with ways to change the weather like Pokemon with access to Max Rockfall or Max Hailstorm. Additionally, Sleep Powder's poor accuracy means that misses will occur somewhat often, putting Venusaur on the backfoot quickly. Its Grass typing also makes it a prime target for common Max Airstream users such as Zapdos and Galarian Moltres.</p> ",

If given a Special Attack boost from Download, its offensive capabilities are also quite respectable, especially if it chooses to Dynamax. Unfortunately, due to the high damage output in a format with threats such as Regieleki and Urshifu-S, Porygon2 may sometimes be overwhelmed by strong foes before it can set Trick Room.

    "overview": "<p>Urshifu-S is blessed with an amazing combination of STAB moves, a great Attack stat, and a good Speed tier that outspeeds many important Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, and Rotom-W. Additionally, its Dark typing and access to Sucker Punch allow it to answer Dragapult and Spectrier effectively. Unseen Fist makes Urshifu very hard to check defensively by allowing it to hit through Protect, forcing the opponent to deal with it offensively. This allows it to thrive late-game when the opponent has already used up their Dynamax. However, Urshifu-S is held back by its low Special Defense and weaknesses to Flying- and Fairy-type attacks from the likes of Tapu Fini and Zapdos. It also suffers from a lack of flexibility, making it quite predictable; notably, it generally does not want to Dynamax, as it loses out on Wicked Blow's critical hits and Close Combat's Base Power.</p> ",

However, it fails to hit Tapu Fini and, as mentioned above, Urshifu usually does not want to Dynamax anyway. A Choice Scarf allows Urshifu to outspeed faster Pokemon such as Dragapult and +1 Speed Landorus-T, but this set is weak and very susceptible to being KOed quickly. Black Glasses is an option for boosting the power of Wicked Blow without the restrictions of Choice Band.
