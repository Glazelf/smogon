  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>While Alakazam was widely regarded as a nonthreatening Pokemon due to its lack of bulk, Magic Guard has completely reversed this. With what is widely regarded as one of the best abilities in the game now, Alakazam can sweep without worrying about Stealth Rock, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes hampering it. Additionally, moves such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp only aid Alakazam, as they allow it to act as a status absorber throughout a match. With a base 135 Special Attack and base 120 Speed, Alakazam can be a top-tier threat for those that lack preparation. Sadly, it is hard to find people that are unprepared for Alakazam considering the ubiquity of Genesect and Excadrill. Those that can outpace Alakazam will usually beat it, though Alakazam can definitely hold its own when given the proper support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Alakazam has a large movepool, the metagame that surrounds it is not very supportive of it. A set with three attacks and Calm Mind is viable, though Alakazam rarely gets a chance to keep all of its boosts due to the fast pace of the Dream World metagame. Charge Beam is an adequate replacement for Calm Mind due to its ability to pick off weakened foes and sweep with a Special Attack boost, but it's generally a gimmicky move in most cases, and with the many Ground-types that roam the tier, such as Excadrill and Garchomp, it's not always reliable. Energy Ball can always be used, as it beats down Pokemon that normally only take neutral damage from Alakazam such as Gastrodon. However, its usage generally is limited to Water / Ground types, and Swampert, Gastrodon, and Quagsire are not used in the metagame. Alakazam has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, but considering its frailty, Pokemon such as Latias and Latios make better users of dual screens. Alakazam also has access to Recover, though with meager defenses, it's hard to imagine Alakazam nabbing recovery in such a fast-paced and offensive metagame.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Alakazam's great base Speed and high Special Attack make it a great special attacker, and with Psyshock, it has few true counters. Still, specially defensive Jirachi stands out as perhaps the best Alakazam counter, as it resists its STAB and takes only neutral damage from other coverage moves. While one might be tempted to use Blissey or Chansey to counter Alakazam, a combination of Life Orb and Psyshock on Alakazam can actually wear them down rather easily. Passive damage is no way to counter Alakazam, as Magic Guard prevents Toxic's and Will-O-Wisp's effects. Generally, countering Alakazam is out of the option considering its diversity; however, checking the mustache-equipped magician works much better.</p> <p>Using priority moves is a good way to beat down Alakazam before it can touch your Pokemon. Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Azumarill's Aqua Jet, and Scizor's Bullet Punch are good ways of putting down Alakazam before it can wreak havoc. Of course, if it carries a Focus Sash, it can still dish out major damage, but these Pokemon are all able to tank at least one hit before going down. Faster threats such as Jolteon can also come in as a revenge killer and dole massive damage to Alakazam, though considering Jolteon's frailty, it cannot switch in. Thundurus's priority Thunder Wave can really cripple Alakazam for offensive teams, and while Alakazam outspeeds, Prankster ensures Alakazam is at least paralyzed. While it seems counter-intuitive, one should never switch Alakazam into Breloom unless it holds a Focus Sash, as Breloom will OHKO with a +2 Mach Punch.</p> <p>Pokemon equipped with a Choice Scarf generally demolish Alakazam, such as Choice Scarf Genesect, Chandelure, Landorus, Jirachi, Latios, Salamence, Rotom-W, and Politoed. While they do need to ensure that Alakazam has prior damage if it carries a Focus Sash, they all work marvelously as revenge killers for offensively oriented teams. Pokemon that can tank a hit and KO back are useful, though not many exist in the Dream World metagame.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>The most viable set in Dream World for Alakazam is its special attacker set. Like every Alakazam set, Psychic is the primary move, as it gets STAB; however, one can always opt for Psyshock in order to hit specially defensive threats such as Blissey and Chansey harder. Focus Blast and Shadow Ball serve as great coverage moves—together, they have perfect coverage, and they allow Alakazam to hit many threats such as Latios and Tyranitar hard. Just like any other offensive Pokemon with Substitute, the point of this set is to shield the user from crippling status and revenge killing attempts, should it carry Substitute. Therefore, because Alakazam forces so many switches, it makes a great user of Substitute. However, one can opt for a fourth move instead of Substitute, as Alakazam is not hindered by any status other than sleep or paralysis. Hidden Power Ice works well because it allows Alakazam to hit Dragon-types, notably Dragonite and Garchomp, for super effective damage.</p> <p>As far as EVs are concerned, one should always run maximum Speed and Special Attack. Alakazam's main draw is its ability to outspeed a majority of the threats in the metagame without a Choice Scarf due to its high base Speed, so a Timid nature is mandatory. While Alakazam is able to use 4 EVs in HP because it does not take entry hazards damage, it can only set up Substitute three times instead of four with the extra HP investment. The item of choice depends on preference; many people choose to run Focus Sash for its added utility in giving Alakazam a guaranteed turn to switch in and avoid a potential OHKO, though Life Orb adds extra power to all of Alakazam's attacks and allows it to plow through teams without recoil, via Magic Guard. One should not choose Focus Sash on a set with Substitute, as it defeats the purpose of even using the move Substitute.</p> <p>Alakazam is suited for offensive teams that benefit from its high Speed and great Special Attack. Unlike most offensive Pokemon, Alakazam does not need any Rapid Spin support because of Magic Guard—this can be a godsend for teams that cannot fit in a Rapid Spin user. Alakazam works well in any weather because it doesn't take damage from sand or hail, and rain and sun doesn't affect its performance. One should always pack a means of defeating Blissey or Chansey if Alakazam does not run Psyshock or a Life Orb, as both of these are necessary if one wants to take down the pink blobs. Terrakion works well for this purpose, as it tears down these two, and its uses do not stop there. Air Balloon Terrakion works incredibly for KOing the likes of Excadrill that threaten to KO Alakazam. Typically, one should carry a sponge for Genesect, as after Alakazam KOes a Pokemon, Genesect tends to smack its metaphorical lips at the prospect of gaining a free U-turn. For this reason, Heatran is always appreciated, as Genesect cannot touch it.</p> "

  "Feraligatr": {
    "overview": "<p>Feraligatr has always lived in the shadow of mighty and majestic Gyarados. Because Gyarados sports Intimidate or Moxie, as well as higher Attack and Speed stats, one would wonder what qualities Feraligatr has over the Atrocious Pokemon. While Feraligatr used to be inferior, it has picked up a gift from the heavens in the form of its Dream World ability, Sheer Force. That, along with its superior movepool and lack of weakness to Stealth Rock, allows Feraligatr to stand out from its fellow physical Water-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>In terms of other moves, Earthquake, Return, and Dragon Claw are available, but do not add to the coverage that the suggested moves already give. Feraligatr can run a Substitute + Dragon Dance set, but Gyarados largely does this better due its better bulk and two move coverage. Feraligatr's main attraction is its its access to multiple coverage moves and this should always be taken advantage of. A Choice Band set is also feasible, although Crawdaunt is generally better if you want to hit hard straight off the bat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to its power and coverage, Feraligatr is difficult to \"counter\" in the strictest sense. However, as long as your team has something reasonably fast that can hit it super effectively, Feraligatr is not very threatening. Jellicent and Slowbro wall the Dragon Dance set if it lacks Crunch, while Ferrothorn stops it if it lacks Superpower. Rotom-W can take an attack from unboosted Feraligatr and destroy it with its Electric STAB of choice. Faster Pokemon with a Choice Scarf and strong Special attacks can also easily revenge kill it, such as Genesect, the aforementioned Rotom-W, Chandelure, Latios, and Hydreigon. The Swords Dance set is even harder to counter, as it is very difficult to wall. However, due to its low Speed, any Electric or Grass-type, as long as they themselves are not slow, can revenge-kill it. These include Zapdos, Celebi, Virizion, Breloom that invest in Speed, Thundurus, Raikou, and Serperior. The Choice Scarf set is relatively easy to take on due to its lack of power, anything that resists its move can switch in and take it out.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>Like Gyarados, Feraligatr has access to Dragon Dance to increase its Attack and Speed stats. Its decent bulk and short list of weaknesses allows it to set up fairly easily. With Sheer Force, Feraligatr becomes immensely powerful. It also removes Life Orb recoil for moves it affects, which allows Feraligatr to last longer. In the rain, Waterfall tops at a huge 234 Power, easily allowing Feraligatr to sweep even slightly weakened teams. Ice Punch is also boosted to a respectable 97.5 Power thanks to Sheer Force, which allows Feraligatr to deal with Grass-types such as Celebi, Serperior, and Virizion a lot more easily. However, the real draw to using Feraligatr is the final slot. Unlike Gyarados, Feraligatr has absolutely no problem with the ubiquitous Ferrothorn, easily OHKOing it with Superpower after one round of Spikes damage. If Ferrothorn is not a major concern, Crunch can be used to swat aside Jellicent, as well as heavily damage Slowbro.</p> <p>The EVs presented allow Feraligatr to outspeed Pokemon with base 120 Speed after a Dragon Dance. An Adamant nature provides maximum power, while a Jolly nature allows Feraligatr to outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Chandelure and Rotom-W. Be advised, however, that Feraligatr will lose some OHKOs with a Jolly nature, particularly on Ferrothorn. Maximum Attack makes Feraligatr as strong as possible, while the rest go into HP for bulk. Aqua Jet could be used in the last slot to pick off Choice Scarf Chandelure if running an Adamant nature, as well as weakened Genesect. A Lum Berry can be an option to avoid status, but Feraligatr really likes the free Life Orb boost.</p> <p>As with all Water-type sweepers, Feraligatr highly appreciates rain support from Politoed. If Feraligatr lacks Crunch, then it is hard-countered by Slowbro and Jellicent, while if it lacks Superpower, it will be hard-pressed to get past Ferrothorn. If Feraligatr is not running a Jolly nature, Jolteon can outspeed and OHKO with Thunder, while Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-W, Chandelure, and Genesect will always outspeed and OHKO with their their respective super effective move. Deoxys-S also outspeeds Adamant Feraligatr even when it's at +2, and can revenge kill with Psycho Boost or Thunderbolt. Because of this, Feraligatr appreciates teammates who can dispose of such threats. Even in the rain, Choice Specs Chandelure is still a great teammate to Feraligatr, as it can easily trap and remove Slowbro, Jellicent and Ferrothorn. Wobbuffet is also an excellent teammate to run alongside Feraligatr to trap and remove Choice Scarf users locked into the wrong move. Dugtrio is also good at removing Choice-locked Electric-types, as well as Ninetales and Tyranitar, helping to win any weather wars. Scizor is a good check to offensive Deoxys-S, and easily traps it with Pursuit.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>While the Dragon Dance set focuses on sweeping, Swords Dance Feraligatr is an unstoppable wallbreaker. There is almost no wall on a rain stall team that can stop Feraligatr from busting up the team's core. After a Swords Dance, Feraligatr is so powerful that it can OHKO defensive Dragonite with Waterfall after Stealth Rock. With Crunch, it obliterates Slowbro and Jellicent, while Low Kick easily OHKOes Ferrothorn. A rain stall team's only real chance to defeat Feraligatr is to poison it with Politoed, and then play around with resistances until it succumbs to poison damage, which by then Feraligatr will most likely have created craters in the opposing team's core.</p> <p>To demonstrate Feraligatr's power, here are some damage calculations against typical walls on rain stall teams:</p> <ul> <li>+0 Waterfall vs 252 HP / 252 Def Relaxed Quagsire: 63.45% - 74.87% <li>+2 Waterfall vs 252 HP / 232 Def Impish Skarmory: 107.78% - 126.95%</li> <li>+2 Waterfall vs 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Politoed: 58.59% - 68.75%</li> <li>+2 Waterfall vs 252 HP / 0 Def Dragonite: 84.72% - 99.48%</li> <li>+2 Crunch vs 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Slowbro: 95.43% - 112.69%</li> <li>+2 Low Kick vs 252 HP / 88 Def Relaxed Ferrothorn: 101.70% - 119.89%</li> </ul> <p>20 Speed EVs allow Feraligatr to outspeed minimum Speed Dragonite, allowing you to outspeed and OHKO it before it hits you with Thunder. Max Attack and an Adamant nature provide maximum destructive power. 232 HP EVs give Feraligatr a Life Orb number, just in the rare circumstance that it loses Sheer Force, reducing the recoil damage from use of Aqua Jet and Superpower. More Speed can be used if desired. As for moveset choices, Aqua Jet can be used in place of Crunch if you want Feraligatr to be a sweeper as well, although it loses coverage against Slowbro and Jellicent. If Aqua Jet is used, Superpower is to be used in the last slot since the combination of all three of Low Kick, Aqua Jet, and Sheer Force is illegal on the same set. +2 Superpower also has the benefit of OHKOing Gastrodon.</p> <p>Again, Politoed is a key teammate to Feraligatr for eternal rain. The boost that rain provides is even more noticeable on this set. Unlike Dragon Dance Feraligatr, anything with a reasonable Speed stat that uses STAB Grass- and Electric-type attacks will take down Feraligatr easily. This is why Grass-types and Dragon-types are great teammates for Feraligatr. These include Celebi, Virizion, Serperior, Latias, and Dragonite. Lightningrod Zapdos is also a great teammate for this reason. In return, Feraligatr can easily switch into weaker Ice-type attacks aimed at them, as well as Fire-type attacks aimed at Grass-types.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Feraligatr's access to Sheer Force, reasonably high Attack stat, and usable Speed easily makes it fit as a Choice Scarf user. Reaching a Speed of 420 with a Choice Scarf, Feraligatr can revenge kill many threats. Waterfall is Feraligatr's STAB move of choice, allowing it to revenge-kill many frail threats, as well as clean up late-game. Ice Punch severely damages Dragonite and Grass-types. Rock Slide may seem redundant with Ice Punch around, but it allows Feraligatr to revenge-kill Gyarados. Crunch allows Feraligatr to revenge kill Starmie, while Superpower makes sure that Feraligatr is not walled by Ferrothorn. Beware of Chandelure when using Superpower.</p> <p>Max Speed and a Jolly nature allow Feraligatr to outspeed Choice Scarf Heatran by 3 points. It is generally not adviced to run an Adamant nature, since Feraligatr would then find itself outsped by things that really shouldn't outspeed it, such as Jolteon.</p> <p>As always, Feraligatr appreciates Politoed to power up Waterfall. Unlike the other sets, Choice Scarf Feraligatr is reasonably independent, since it is more of a supporter. Since Feraligatr has weaknesses to Grass- and Electric-types, Grass- and Dragon-types are good teammates to Feraligatr. Celebi, Breloom, Serperior, Latias, and Dragonite, as well as Zapdos, fit the bill nicely.</p> "

  "Blaziken": {
    "overview": "<p>Blaziken was one of the Pokemon that was released from Ubers to reign free in the Dream World OU tier. With its Dream World ability, Speed Boost, Blaziken can remedy its low Speed and become an immensely powerful sweeper. While Blaziken can still sweep outside of sun, its effectiveness is somewhat reduced. Rain, however, is very detrimental to Blaziken's success as a sweeper, as it cuts the power of Blaziken's Flare Blitz. Additionally, low defenses leave Blaziken susceptible to priority, though it should be noted that no priority user in the tier can safely switch in. Despite all these difficulties, amazing offensive typing and high offensive stats keep Blaziken a top-tier Pokemon. All these advantages and disadvantages combine to make a downright amazing Pokemon that can sweep nearly any team under the right conditions.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Blaziken has access to Stone Edge, which the Swords Dance sweeper can use over Protect. Blaze Kick and Sky Uppercut can replace Flare Blitz and High Jump Kick respectively on any set, but the reduced damage output is very noticeable. In particular, Shadow Claw is an option to hit Ghost-types that generally trouble Blaziken. Though unorthodox, Choice Band Blaziken would make for a neat late-game cleaner, and only requires a free switchin on anything slower than it. However, as with any Pokemon, it hates being locked into one move. Blaziken is best used abusing its dual STABs, and particularly High Jump Kick is the worst move to be locked in on in the metagame, due to the presensce of Shadow Tag Chandelure.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Blaziken's main problem is not a specific Pokemon, but a field condition: rain. In rain, Flare Blitz becomes pitifully weak, leaving Blaziken open to all Ghost-types. As such, Politoed is a great weapon to have on your side when attempting to counter Blaziken. Additionally, Politoed itself can take one unboosted hit and KO back. Ghost-types also greatly trouble Blaziken because they are immune to High Jump Kick, with Jellicent and Chandelure also able to take its Flare Blitz and OHKO. Aside from Jellicent, Slowbro gives Blaziken nightmares as well. Thanks to their typing and access to STAB Scald, both these threats can switch in with impunity and force Blaziken out. While Slowbro is 2HKOed by +2 High Jump Kick and Stealth Rock damage, it can switch in immediately with no issues. Thanks to Leftovers, Quagsire just barely avoids the 2HKO, and can OHKO in return with either STAB move. The popular Multiscale Dragonite also exists to give Blaziken trouble, but is easily 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Gyarados can take one hit and go for Waterfall or Bounce; Thundurus can also sacrifice itself to hinder Blaziken with Thunder Wave. Lastly, Ditto threatens all sets, especially the Baton Pass one. By stealing Blaziken's Attack and Speed Boosts, along with its powerful STAB attacks, it can possibly sweep Blaziken's own team in the process.</p> <p>The Swords Dance set has no true counters due to its sheer power, but it can certainly be played around. Breloom can revenge kill it with Technician Mach Punch and Azumarill with Aqua Jet; the latter can also switch in on Flare Blitz, which can be baited by Ferrothorn or Chandelure. In fact, running both forms of priority makes for a great failsafe, and is perhaps the best way to check Blaziken. The mixed set is very dangerous courtesy of its amazing coverage. However, Slowbro and Vaporeon can take anything it can dish out, and if it lacks Protect, Jellicent counters it. The Baton Pass set is a little trickier to handle, but if the opponent predicts well and, for instance, gets Skarmory to use Whirlwind, Blaziken's plans will be temporarily scuppered. Do watch out, though, as the Baton Pass set is the only set with no counters, besides possibly Azumarill and Breloom. If not packing such priority, Blaziken will almost always get off a pass, often causing the end of the game.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>With a Speed Boost every turn, as well as the ability to raise its Attack via Swords Dance, Blaziken has the potential to become quite a frightening sweeper. With an Attack boost, Blaziken hits a maximum Attack stat of 734, and can easily OHKO or 2HKO most of the tier. High Jump Kick and Flare Blitz are excellent dual STABs; a +2 sun-boosted Flare Blitz in particular can even OHKO Jellicent after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. High Jump Kick has amazing neutral coverage with Flare Blitz, but is inferior to Flare Blitz in sun, even when Flare Blitz is resisted compared to a neutral hit. However, when using it, watch out for Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Jellicent, who can switch in for free and KO Blaziken back—though the former fears getting OHKOed by a sun-boosted Flare Blitz. Protect is extremely important on this set, as it grants Blaziken one desperately needed boost to its Speed. Substitute is an option if Blaziken can come in on something that it outspeeds, and solves any problems Blaziken has with priority and status, particularly against sacrificial priority attempts from Thundurus and foes aiming to weaken Blaziken with Intimidate.</p> <p>Blaziken's bulk is so poor that even with investment, it will still not be taking very many hits. For this reason, its Attack and Speed are maximized. A Jolly nature allows Blaziken to outspeed Adamant Excadrill in the sandstorm after two Speed boosts, as well as all Choice Scarf users below base 80 Speed after one boost, most notably Politoed and Heatran. However, it should be noted that the rare Jolly Excadrill will still outrun Blaziken. An Adamant nature is an option if these threats aren't particular issues, pushing Blaziken's Attack even higher than it already is, and securing the KO on Slowbro with a +2 Attack, but Jolly is normally preferred as these foes could otherwise prevent a successful sweep. Life Orb is the best item to use, because Blaziken needs to hit as hard as it can as soon as possible. Leftovers is also a viable option, particularly if Blaziken is used on a sandstorm team, because recoil from Life Orb and Flare Blitz, as well as residual damage from sandstorm, can easily end Blaziken's sweep prematurely. However, Life Orb is almost always the best item choice as Leftovers variants will sorely miss the initial power, and consequently be unable to get a lot of major 2HKOs after a Swords Dance, including on Dragonite and Jellicent. Air Balloon can be used to avoid Ground-type attacks from the likes of Gliscor, Landorus, Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Excadrill, and potentially gain a free setup turn.</p> <p>Ninetales should almost always be run alongside Blaziken, mainly due to the fact that sandstorm piles recoil damage on Blaziken, and rain weakens Flare Blitz. Blaziken can deal with Tyranitar, but a teammate that can remove Tyranitar and Politoed before Blaziken hits the field is most desirable. Scizor and Breloom completely annihilate Tyranitar and don't mind the sun as it stands no chance against Fire-type attacks anyway. As Rotom-W fares poorly in sun, Thundurus and Serperior are useful partners to remove Politoed. Despite Speed Boost, Thundurus's priority Thunder Wave can also be annoying, since it neuters Blaziken's Speed: at +6 Blaziken will max out at a stat of 284 if it is using a Jolly nature. Finally, Wish passers, including Blissey and Chansey, help Blaziken stay healthy and pose more of a threat.</p> <p>Blaziken has a few counters, but all of these have some flaws. Jellicent is immune to High Jump Kick and if rain is up, takes negligible damage from even +2 Flare Blitz. For this reason, ThunderPunch or Shadow Claw can be considered over Protect to hit Jellicent super effectively. However, neither of these moves OHKO, and the utility of Protect is too good to forgo. Of the two moves, Shadow Claw is the better option because it hits all Ghost-types super effectively, making Blaziken less dependent on weather. Thundurus and Serperior are once again great partners to deal with Jellicent. Lastly, note that in sun and at +2, Blaziken will always OHKO Jellicent with Flare Blitz after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Blaziken's few other counters are also dependent on sandstorm or rain, as they are all 2HKOed in sun. The first is bulky Dragon Dance Dragonite, who can come in on either of Blaziken's STABs, escaping the 2HKO, and OHKO back with any attack. Intimidate Gyarados also narrowly escapes the 2HKO and easily OHKOes back with either Bounce or Waterfall. Slowbro functions similarly and can retaliate with Scald. Quagsire can make use of Unaware to ignore Blaziken's stat boots. However, do note that Quagsire is easily 2HKOed by High Jump Kick after at least one layer of Spikes. Rotom-W and Thundurus carrying Hidden Power Ice and Thunderbolt can deal with Gyarados, Dragonite, Slowbro, and Jellicent, while Breloom can deal with Quagsire.</p> <p>Stealth Rock edges many of the aforementioned Pokemon into a boosted Blaziken's KO range, including defensive Gliscor, offensive Dragonite, and Intimidate Gyarados, and possibly even bulky Dragonite and Salamence as well. Spikes, too, ease the need for a high damage roll and leaves these counters in the dust. For this reason, reliable users of Stealth Rock and Spikes, such as Tyranitar and Deoxys-S respectively, make great teammates. Removing opposing Rapid Spin users, most notably Forretress, Starmie, and Excadrill, is helpful to a Blaziken sweep, making the likes of Chandelure, Tyranitar, and Gliscor fine teammates.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Due to egg move restrictions, standard Blaziken cannot run Baton Pass in conjunction with Speed Boost. In Dream World OU, however, these movepool limitations are not in effect, and Blaziken is therefore free to pass its accumulated boosts. In addition to raising Blaziken's Attack, Swords Dance boosts can be passed to a teammate. Protect gives Blaziken a vital free Speed boost, enabling it to pose more of a threat, as well as Baton Pass more easily. High Jump Kick and Flare Blitz are powerful STAB moves, the former letting Blaziken threaten bulky Water-types and the latter most Steel-types. Finally, Baton Pass allows Blaziken to utilize Speed Boost to its full potential and lead the team to a sweep.</p> <p>All-out offensive investment is used as Blaziken is frail even with defensive investment, so there is no use in running any. A Jolly nature is used to make Blaziken as fast as possible, as this Blaziken should not be attempting a sweep of its own. Leftovers is the main option because Focus Sash may be broken by entry hazards, unless of course Blaziken is in the lead slot. As an alternative, Focus Sash allows Blaziken to nab one free turn, and is particularly useful for getting up both a Swords Dance and a Speed boost.</p> <p>This Blaziken has no true counters other than a switch in from a Taunt user such as Thundurus or a phazer such as Vaporeon, the former of which can be dealt with by Flare Blitz. However, the latter can switch in without fear of a +2 or Life Orb boosted High Jump Kick, proceeding to OHKO Blaziken with Scald or phaze out the Pokemon Blaziken passes to. Thundurus, Serperior, and Rotom-W are great problems to deal with this. One of its only issues is Breloom, who can bypass Blaziken's Speed boosts and OHKO with Mach Punch; Azumarill too can be similarly problematic. A Pokemon such as Celebi is a good way to deal with Breloom, while Thundurus and Serperior handle Azumarill well. More important teammates are ones that can make good use of the passed Attack and Speed boosts. Garchomp and Landorus become incredibly powerful after these boosts, while other good receivers include Infernape, Breloom, and Dragonite. Garchomp and Landorus stand out from the rest as they already boast high stats in these areas, but Breloom and Dragonite are great too because they resist Water-type attacks directed at Blaziken. Blaziken is also great with Calm Mind passers such as Espeon, as Blaziken does not possess the ability to pass off Special Attack boosts, which can be problematic to mixed receivers.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With a great base 110 Special Attack stat, Blaziken can be an effective mixed wallbreaker. Fire Blast is a much better attack than Flare Blitz as it doesn't inflict recoil. High Jump Kick is Blaziken's other STAB, and while it is less reliable in that it fears missing more than Fire Blast, it hits incredibly hard and provides Blaziken with great neutral coverage. Hidden Power Ice is Blaziken's coverage move of choice, as it destroys Dragonite and Garchomp, two huge threats to Blaziken otherwise. The last slot is a toss-up. Protect grants Blaziken a free Speed boost, but deprives it of extra coverage. Shadow Claw hits Jellicent and Chandelure, who wall Blaziken's other moves, and should be used if Blaziken's other teammates cannot easily deal with them.</p> <p>The Special Attack EVs boost the power of Fire Blast and Hidden Power Ice. A Rash nature is preferred because it allows Blaziken to hit harder, and 228 Speed EVs enables it to outspeed Deoxys-S and Choice Scarf Garchomp at +2.

Life Orb is the preferred item for the power boost, but Expert Belt is worth considering if Blaziken is used in sandstorm, as it has excellent super effective coverage, and residual damage would otherwise add up quickly.</p> <p>Either Hidden Power Electric or Hidden Power Grass can be used in place of Hidden Power Ice for a super effective hit on bulky Water-types, most notably Vaporeon, Quagsire, and Slowbro, but bulky Water-types are somewhat less common in the DW metagame, and the lack of Hidden Power Ice leaves Blaziken open to Dragonite, Garchomp, and Latios, who are far more common threats.</p> <p>This set has trouble with bulky Water-types, particularly Jellicent, as it is not 2HKOed by a sun-boosted Flare Blitz without Swords Dance to contend with. To remedy this, Thundurus and Serperior are once again amazing partners. Both pack super effective STAB moves against bulky Water-types, and Thundurus can also use priority Taunt to cripple Jellicent. This set once again loves sun support, making Ninetales a recommended partner, but as previously mentioned, Blaziken can be used in sandstorm with Expert Belt. Stealth Rock support deals with Multiscale Dragonite effectively, as well as helping against Latios.</p> "

  "Empoleon": {
    "overview": "<p>Sporting one of the best defensive typings in the game, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Empoleon is generally seen as a defensive threat. However, its typing, stats, and movepool actually provide it the perfect pairing of tools to become a menacing offensive threat. With Drizzle support, its unique SubPetaya set can sweep any unprepared team, and when building a rain offense team, Empoleon should always be considered.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A specially defensive set can make use of Empoleon's excellent defensive typing and stats, but is generally outdone by Jellicent as it lacks reliable recovery and has little in the way of supporting the team outside of Scald and Roar. Empoleon can run a Choice Specs rather effectively with Hidden Power Fire or Flash Cannon in the last slot, but it has little use over the Agility set, which can change moves and has Agility to attempt a sweep. Keldeo also usually does a better job as a Choice Specs user, as it is more powerful, faster, and has STAB Secret Sword to take down Blissey and Ferrothorn. Empoleon can also attempt to sweep with a Swords Dance set and STAB priority Aqua Jet, but base 86 Attack isn't exactly impressive, and it is easily walled by common Pokemon such as Dragonite, Rotom-W, and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to its sheer power, Empoleon can be hard to counter. Chansey is one of the best options due to its great special bulk with Eviolite and can take down Empoleon with Seismic Toss. Vaporeon is another Pokemon that can take Empoleon's attacks rather easily, as it is immune to Surf thanks to Water Absorb, and due to its low weight Grass Knot only has a paltry 60 Base Power and fails to 2HKO. Vaporeon can then take down Empoleon at 25% with a rain-boosted Surf.</p> <p>Other than those two Pokemon, few Pokemon you'll commonly encounter can take all of Empoleon's attacks. However, Empoleon has to choose between Grass Knot and Ice Beam, and, depending on its pick, there will always be something that can wall it. Gastrodon and Jellicent are both immune to Surf thanks to their ability and take poor damage from Ice Beam, so any Empoleon lacking Grass Knot won't be able to get past them. On the other hand, any Empoleon lacking Ice Beam will find itself walled by bulky Grass-types such as Celebi, as well as Dragonite that has been able to keep its Multiscale intact. Toxicroak is also immune to Surf and Hydro Pump thanks to its Dry Skin ability, resists Grass Knot, and can KO Empoleon with STAB Cross Chop or Drain Punch in return.</p> <p>If you lack a Pokemon that can take Empoleon's attacks, there's always the option of revenge killing it. While Agility boosts its Speed by two stages, there are still several Choice Scarf users that can outspeed Empoleon and take it down. Landorus, Terrakion, Genesect with Thunderbolt, and Rotom-W are the most prominent ones. Empoleon is also weak to Mach Punch, and as such, Pokemon with that move can take it down before it can make a move. Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Infernape are the three best options for the job. However, every other priority move bar Vacuum Wave is resisted by Empoleon and won't be able to take it down even at 25%, so don't think you can get away with relying on Scizor or Lucario.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Empoleon's signature set aims to sweep late-game with a combination of boosts from Petaya Berry, Torrent, and Drizzle. This makes Empoleon's STAB move incredibly powerful, with Hydro Pump being almost twice as powerful as Latios's legendary Choice Specs Draco Meteor. Agility, meanwhile, doubles Empoleon's Speed, making it very hard to outspeed other than with fast Choice Scarf users. When setting up, Empoleon should use Agility first. Then, Empoleon can use Substitute continuously until Petaya Berry and Torrent activate, at which point Empoleon is ready to sweep.</p> <p>The choice between Surf and Hydro Pump depends on the classic power versus accuracy argument. Surf provides more reliability, but Hydro Pump scores some useful KOs, such as on Keldeo without any prior damage and Blissey after Stealth Rock and two layers of Spikes. Grass Knot is usually the best option in the last slot, as it hits otherwise troublesome Pokemon such as Jellicent and Gastrodon. Ice Beam is an alternate option over Grass Knot, as it hits Dragonite hard even with Multiscale intact, as well as Latias and defensive Celebi.</p> <p>The Speed EVs let Empoleon outspeed up to Choice Scarf Gyarados with a Modest nature. More Speed EVs can be invested, but doing so is quite useless as nothing else of importance is outsped. Special Attack is maximized for maximum power, giving Empoleon an easier time sweeping. 12 HP EVs are invested to make sure the Petaya Berry is activated after three Substitutes instead of four, so Empoleon is at 25% when attempting a sweep and thus isn't stopped by Scizor's Bullet Punch or Lucario's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Empoleon can only carry one of Grass Knot and Ice Beam. As such, depending on your choice of move, you have to be able to deal with the Pokemon that can take on Empoleon. When using Grass Knot, Scizor makes for an excellent teammate, threatening Latias and Celebi by Pursuiting them, while Dragonite's Multiscale can be broken with a priority Bullet Punch. Variants with Ice Beam benefit from something that can take down bulky Water-types, such as Breloom. Breloom can also remove Chansey, who walls Empoleon either way.</p> <p>While Empoleon resists some of the most common priority moves, namely Bullet Punch and Extreme Speed, Mach Punch from Breloom and Conkeldurr can still take it down. A Pokemon that can switch in on Mach Punch and threaten these Pokemon, namely Dragonite, is a good teammate for this reason. Fast Choice Scarf users such as Genesect and Landorus can also outspeed Empoleon even after an Agility, so a teammate that can deal with them is recommended. Bronzong is a good option, and can also set up Stealth Rock for Empoleon. Speaking of Stealth Rock, Empoleon really appreciates entry hazard support, as it weakens several Pokemon into KO range. Stealth Rock is the more prominent one, but Spikes also help. Toxic Spikes can also be useful, as by continuously using Substitute with Toxic Spikes up, Pokemon such as Chansey can easily be stalled into Surf or Hydro Pump KO range. Toxic Spikes especially come in handy when using Ice Beam, as without Grass Knot, Empoleon has problems with bulky Water-types who also despise Toxic Spikes, namely Jellicent and Suicune.</p> "

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>Togekiss has been best known for being one of the two \"hax\" Pokemon, with the other being Jirachi. The combination of Serene Grace, a paralysis move, access to Roost, and a STAB move with a 30% flinch chance leaves the opponent with only a 30% chance to attack, which makes Togekiss almost impossible to take out. All in all, it is one of the most infuriating Pokemon in the game. That is not all, though; Togekiss can also run an effective Nasty Plot set, as it is one of the few Pokemon with access to the move. Combine that with a very respectable base 120 Special Attack stat, and you get a Pokemon that can lay down the hurt on unprepared teams. Unfortunately, Togekiss isn't without its flaws. Its weakness to Stealth Rock is a crippling one, as it means Togekiss will lose a quarter of its health every time it switches in. While Togekiss does have access to Roost, the fast-paced nature of the DW metagame makes it hard for it to use Roost often. Additionally, its below-average base 80 Speed stat also leaves Togekiss easily revenge killed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Togekiss can run a rather effective Choice Scarf set, as Air Slash takes down most opponents in a few hits, and Trick cripples walls such as Blissey and Jirachi switching in. However, Thunder Wave is usually a better way of remedying Togekiss's below-average Speed, as several Pokemon outspeed even Choice Scarf Togekiss. Togekiss can also run an effective Baton Pass set as it is one of the few Pokemon that can pass Nasty Plot boosts, but it is generally outclassed by Mew in such a role.</p> <p>Hustle Togekiss is somewhat viable; while it has a rather pathetic base 50 Attack, STAB Extreme Speed is definitely nothing to scoff at when combined with Hustle. Work Up can help boost its Attack even more and let it KO several offensively inclined Pokemon, such as Thundurus and Breloom. However, anything that resists it can revenge kill Togekiss quite easily, and Excadrill, Genesect, and Chandelure all do. It also lacks power, and will not be able to take down bulkier Pokemon such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Scizor. Finally, Grass Knot can be used on the Nasty Plot set to hit Gastrodon and Unaware Quagsire, but it has little use otherwise, so it's almost always an inferior option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Zapdos is likely the best Togekiss counter out there, as it resists both Air Slash and Aura Sphere, is immune to Thunder Wave thanks to Lightning Rod, and can threaten Togekiss with a powerful STAB Thunderbolt. Raikou works similarly, but doesn't resist Aura Sphere. Jirachi also resists Air Slash and is neutral to Aura Sphere; it can take out Togekiss with its own paraflinching strategy thanks to its higher base Speed. Blissey and Chansey can take on Togekiss that lack Heal Bell—if they manage to Toxic it, they can simply Soft-Boiled until Togekiss faints.</p> <p>If all else fails, revenge killing Togekiss is always possible. Powerful physical attackers that outspeed Togekiss, such as Terrakion, Haxorus, and Salamence, can take it out. However, they need to be careful while switching in, as they are crippled by Thunder Wave. Garchomp and Mamoswine can both switch in on Thunder Wave freely thanks to their Ground typing, and threaten to KO Togekiss with a powerful STAB move.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set aims to make the most of Serene Grace. The combination of paralysis and a 60% flinch chance leaves the opponent with only a 30% chance to actually do something. Togekiss can usually take out several Pokemon all by itself if luck is on your side, as it can be hard to KO especially due to Roost and its good bulk.</p> <p>Thunder Wave provides a reliable way of spreading paralysis, unlike Body Slam, which only paralyzes 60% of the time. Body Slam also doesn't hit Ghost-types, but has the advantage of hitting Ground-types such as Excadrill and Landorus, and is not shut down by Taunt. Air Slash is Togekiss's main STAB move, as it has a high flinch rate as well as good power. Aura Sphere is the best option in the third slot, as it provides great coverage alongside Air Slash, and hits Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Heatran for super effective damage. However, Flamethrower hits several notable Steel-types, such as Jirachi, Genesect, and Skarmory, for greater damage. Roost is in the last slot to enhance Togekiss's longevity, especially when combined with the fact that the opponent will rarely be able to attack every turn.</p> <p>The EVs are geared towards maximizing Togekiss's excellent special bulk; in conjunction with its typing, this lets Togekiss take on DW behemoths such as Genesect and Chandelure. The Defense EVs ensure that +2 Jolly Air Balloon Excadrill will not KO Togekiss with Rock Slide, which can be useful if your team has some problems with it. However, you can drop the Defense EVs and instead go with a simple 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD EV spread. If you feel that mono-Flying coverage is enough for Togekiss to take down most Pokemon, Nasty Plot is an option over the coverage move. Togekiss can often find a free turn to set up, and this lets it take down opposing Pokemon with Air Slash a lot more easily.</p> <p>While this set doesn't have that many counters considering most Pokemon can usually be taken out by a couple of flinches, there are some threats that do give this set a lot of trouble. Zapdos takes little damage from both Air Slash and Aura Sphere and can threaten Togekiss with a powerful Thunderbolt. Jirachi isn't bothered by anything but Flamethrower and can take down Togekiss with its own paraflinching combination thanks to its higher Speed. Specially defensive Heatran makes for a good partner, as it can take both Zapdos's and Jirachi's assaults quite easily and threaten them with Toxic and Lava Plume, respectively. Jirachi is another good partner for Togekiss, not because it is able to deal with the aforementioned problem Pokemon, but because it makes for a good \"hax\" core with it—both Pokemon are able to paralyze opponents and flinch them to death.</p> "

        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<p>This set doesn't focus as much on Serene Grace, but instead aims to set up and pull off a sweep. Nasty Plot doubles Togekiss's Special Attack in one use, letting it quickly get very threatening. With its excellent bulk, it can often find an opportunity to set up. There are two ways to go with this set: defensive and offensive. The defensive variant focuses on Togekiss's excellent bulk to find an opportunity to set up a Nasty Plot or even two, while the offensive variant focuses on Togekiss's great base 120 Special Attack along with its excellent coverage.</p> <p>Air Slash is a given on both variants, as it's Togekiss best STAB move, and further packs a 60% flinch chance. Aura Sphere is the best option in the third slot, as it provides great coverage and hits notable Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Heatran, hard. Defensive variants can also consider Heal Bell in this slot, as the ability to cure itself of status lets Togekiss set up on Blissey. Roost is a mandatory last move for the defensive variant, but offensive sets can use Fire Blast for more coverage, as KOing Jirachi among others can be very useful.</p> <p>The choice of item and EV spread depends on the variant. The defensive variant is better off using Leftovers, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe, and a Modest nature for good bulk and power. The offensive variant, on the other hand, should use a Life Orb to boost the power of its attacks, along with a 112 HP / 4 Def / 156 SpA / 236 Spe EV spread and a Timid nature. Those EVs let Togekiss outspeed Adamant Lucario and always KO Gliscor at +2, while also providing it with a Life Orb number.</p> <p>While this set is rather powerful, certain Pokemon are still able to wall it reliably. Chansey and Blissey can take on Togekiss without Heal Bell thanks to their incredible special bulk and Toxic. Specially defensive Dragonite can take a hit, especially if Multiscale is intact, and use Dragon Tail to phaze out Togekiss and rack up entry hazard damage. Mamoswine makes for a good teammate as it is able to take down both of these threats thanks to its high base Attack and powerful STAB moves.</p> "

One would think, then, that a metagame infested by Shadow Tag Chandelure makes it incredibly difficult to do its job. However, this is not the case. Sure, Chandelure obliterates Ferrothorn with any Fire-type attack bar a rain-soaked Flamethrower, but with the proper precautions, such as the vital item Shed Shell, Ferrothorn can work around Chandelure to perform its regular duties, from laying down hazards to dealing nasty status to your opponents. Ferrothorn is just one of those Pokemon that can fit into just about any team style, since the support it supplies is universally important.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ferrothorn has a colorful array of support moves, but it has little room for them on its sets. Swords Dance and Curse are great options to give Ferrothorn some fire power, the latter boosting its defense simultaneously. Toxic provides further status and can provide further residual damage for your opponent alongside Leech Seed, but Ferrothorn is strapped for move slots as it is and Thunder Wave is typically the more valuable status move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Shadow Tag Chandelure is, bar none, the best check to Ferrothorn. Shed Shell only provides Ferrothorn an escape route, while Chandelure can easily set up a Substitute, boost with Calm Mind, or just blast away with any move it thinks will cover your switch-in. If Ferrothorn is running Leftovers, Chandelure can do the same things at its leisure, although it's usually better off attacking because Ferrothorn's attacks will always break its Substitutes. Powerful Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Conkeldurr, Breloom, and Infernape can take on Ferrothorn with little effort, the latter roasting Ferrothorn with any Fire-type move, but all of these must take the residual damage from Iron Barbs into account. Ninetales can come in to set up sun almost for free, since it is not threatened by neither Gyro Ball nor Power Whip and can force Ferrothorn out, threatening it with its mere presence, not to mention a nuclear Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p> ",

Stealth Rock is perhaps the most important support move, breaking Dragonite's Multiscale, hindering Flying-types in general, and dealing harsh damage to common Fire-types on sun teams, such as Volcarona. Leech Seed provides vital recovery for Ferrothorn in lieu of Leftovers, while chipping away at your opponent's health. However, Spikes further perpetuates the entry hazard damage, making it very hard for your opponent to switch in hastily and repeatedly. Protect is as cowardly as ever, helping Ferrothorn scout for your opponent's attacks and gaining it a free turn of recovery from Leech Seed. However, Thunder Wave can be used to cripple common switch-ins, such as the deadly Chandelure. Finally, Ferrothorn has access to two powerful STAB moves that prevent it from becoming total Taunt bait; Gyro Ball is a great choice, as it takes advantage of Ferrothorn's dirt slow Speed to attain a massive 150 Base Power against most opponents. However, Power Whip is the preferred option if you are running Thunder Wave support, as your opponent's Pokemon will be much slower, neutering Gyro Ball's power.</p> <p>First of all, the most important thing to note is the use of Shed Shell over Leftovers. This allows Ferrothorn to escape the clutches of Chandelure, which also makes it a makeshift Chandelure lure. Instead of making a risky double switch, you can stay in, lay your hazard, and if Chandelure comes in, you can switch to the appropriate counter. The given EVs and a Relaxed nature are not too difficult to understand, investing completely in Ferrothorn's fantastic bulk while reducing its Speed, allowing for the strongest possible Gyro Ball. If you run Thunder Wave, you should instead run the full 31 IVs and an Impish nature. This allows Ferrothorn to outspeed paralyzed max Speed positive-natured Rotom-A and slower, which also includes Gyarados, Dragonite, Toxicroak, Heatran, and Chandelure, which is useful if you need Ferrothorn to lay one last hazard or Leech Seed before sacrificing itself.</p> <p>Anything that can take a massive hit from Chandelure makes a great partner for Ferrothorn, since that is most likely what is switching in. In rain, Politoed and Tentacruel giggle at Chandelure's Fire-type attacks; neither are even 5HKOed by Choice Specs Overheat in the rain—in other words, Chandelure is switching out immediately before getting drenchedwith a rain-boosted Water attack. However, if your opponent is wise to your Ferrothorn's Shed Shell, it may choose to fire off an Energy Ball or Shadow Ball to hit either Pokemon hard. Hydreigon is the best switch-in, resisting all of Chandelure's attacks aside from its Hidden Power of choice and threatening to OHKO Chandelure with Dark Pulse. Outside of rain, a Chandelure of your own partners well with Ferrothorn, with paralysis support and entry hazards paving the way for Chandelure to eliminate Pokemon that threaten the rest of your team.</p> "

  "Dugtrio": {
    "overview": "<p>Dugtrio is the epitome of living life in the fast lane. With an outstanding base 120 Speed stat, usable Attack, and access to one of the most lethal abilities in the game in Arena Trap, Dugtrio holds the title of one of the metagame's best revenge killers. However, the Dream World has introduced Shadow Tag Chandelure, a Pokemon that gives Dugtrio quite the literal run for its money when it comes to trapping and revenge killing. Though Chandelure is naturally slower than Dugtrio, its attacking prowess is much higher, allowing it to rip through its trapped foes more easily. Dugtrio, however, retains an important role in a metagame that continues to be dominated by weather—that of a strong weather counter and exceptional ally to rain teams. Dugtrio is able to outpace and destroy opposing Ninetales, Tyranitar, and Abomasnow, allowing rain teams to easily control the weather of a match. With its role as the game's best revenge killer in jeopardy, Dugtrio must rely on its ability to check key threats to retain its usefulness in the Dream World tier.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aerial Ace is a possibility in the fourth slot of the Reversal set in order to deal with Pokemon such as Virizion and Heracross, but it is relatively useless outside of those threats. Additionally, Dugtrio can no longer effectively check Breloom in the Dream World metagame as Technician Bullet Seed will break Dugtrio's Focus Sash and always KO in only two hits. Rock Slide might seem tempting over Stone Edge due to the latter's accuracy issues, but the low Base Power in conjunction with Dugtrio's fairly unimpressive Attack stat makes it a rather poor choice. In fact, a resisted Earthquake and a neutral Rock Slide have the same Base Power due to STAB, making Stone Edge the obvious choice. If Reversal Dugtrio isn't running a Focus Sash, Endure is a decent option that, along with a Fighting Gem, makes sure that Dugtrio wins against Chople Berry Tyranitar. Beat Up is gimmicky due to its reliance on Dugtrio's teammates, but it can catch an opponent off-guard and deal heavy damage at the beginning of a match.</p> <p>Dugtrio can only boost its Attack through Hone Claws, which might seem appealing as the accuracy boost also makes Stone Edge much more reliable. Dugtrio's ability to trap opponents means that it can come in on an opponent Choice-locked into an Electric-type move, such as Jolteon or Genesect, and boost up for a sweep. However, situations such as these are likely to be rare, and Dugtrio's terrible bulk will give it very few other chances to set up. Additionally, Dugtrio is largely outclassed as a Ground-type boosting sweeper by the likes of Landorus. Using a Choice Scarf with an Adamant nature might seem appealing, but the boosting nature will still not make Dugtrio powerful enough to break through many common Pokemon and also prevents Dugtrio from outspeeding other common Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Terrakion, Mienshao, and Starmie.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Thanks to Dugtrio's awful base HP stat and poor defenses, it will easily fall to most hits. Of course, its ability and incredible Speed stat make it hard to counter effectively, but many Pokemon that can survive an attack from Dugtrio will be able to demolish it in return. Priority users such as Scizor are incredibly bothersome for Dugtrio, as they force it to rely on Sucker Punch to damage them before it gets KOed. With the boost in ExtremeSpeed's priority, Dragonite makes an excellent counter to Dugtrio because it cannot be checked by Sucker Punch; furthermore, if Multiscale is active, Stone Edge will not KO it either. Though it does not commonly do so, Dragonite can also elect to run Aqua Jet, which in rain which will utterly annihilate Dugtrio. Breloom is another excellent counter to Dugtrio as its Bullet Seed breaks Dugtrio's Substitutes and Focus Sash; it is also not KOed by any of Dugtrio's attacks.</p> <p>Flying-types and Pokemon with the Levitate ability all avoid the trapping effect of Arena Trap, making them fairly useful for disrupting Dugtrio's most important role. However, the former Pokemon must be wary of Stone Edge, which will quickly dispose of them. Skarmory is practically untouchable, however, and doesn't even have to run Shed Shell to escape from Dugtrio after it finishes laying Spikes with absolute impunity. Latios has access to Levitate and often runs Surf, which will quickly dispose of Dugtrio, but it must be extremely cautious around Sucker Punch variants. One of the best possible ways to counter Dugtrio is to determine what set it has, which can be quite easy as they are very different from each other. Though one will often have to sacrifice a Pokemon to the Choice Band variant to get a favorable match-up, after that, it's quite easy to bring in a resist and set up. The Reversal set is a bit harder to counter due to the incredible power that Reversal packs once Dugtrio has been brought down to 1 HP, but these variants of Dugtrio often lack Sucker Punch, making priority an easy way to dispose of them.</p> ",

        "name": "Reversal",
        "description": "<p>While Dugtrio serves its role as a weather counter quite well, it is often let down by its inability to guarantee an OHKO on Tyranitar, which can dispatch Dugtrio easily in return. This set looks to remedy this problem by using Reversal in tandem with a Focus Sash, allowing Dugtrio to defeat any Tyranitar lacking a Chople Berry and even some that do carry it. Reversal is also Dugtrio's best option for countering Chansey and Blissey, which will be backed into a tight corner thanks to Dugtrio's massive Speed and immunity to Thunder Wave. Earthquake is necessary not only for STAB, but also because it allows Dugtrio to retain its role as a revenge killer without having to lower its health. Even without an item boost, many weakened enemies can still be picked off by the move. For example, if Dugtrio switches in safely on Chandelure, it can OHKO with Earthquake. Even if Chandelure holds a Choice Scarf, Dugtrio's Focus Sash will prevent it from losing to the opposing trapper. Stealth Rock is somewhat situational, but it's the best move in the the third slot. If Dugtrio finds itself at full health against a Tyranitar, Stealth Rock allows Dugtrio to support its team while it waits for Tyranitar to break its Focus Sash and bring it down to optimal Reversal range.</p> <p>Dugtrio's fourth move should depend on what your team needs it to handle. Stone Edge gives Dugtrio fantastic type coverage, allowing it to serve as both a revenge killer and a Tyranitar counter, and also deal massive damage to Flying-types that are immune to Arena Trap. Sucker Punch, however, is useful for damaging Pokemon with priority moves, which can otherwise wreck Dugtrio after it has been brought down to 1 HP. Substitute is the final option; as it grants Dugtrio immunity to status, it lets Dugtrio handle Chansey and Blissey much more easily. Additionally, it lowers Dugtrio's health into Reversal range if the opponent is hesitant to attack.</p> <p>When it comes to items, Focus Sash stands out as a fantastic option that allows Dugtrio to survive fatal hits—in other words, most hits—and strike back with a maximum-power Reversal. However, if you're confident that Dugtrio can reach minimum HP on its own via Substitute, then a Fighting Gem is a fantastic supplement. With the Fighting Gem attached, maximum-power Reversal is a guaranteed OHKO on even Chople Berry Tyranitar, as well as the only way that Dugtrio can hope to OHKO Chansey and Blissey. An Expert Belt is another viable option, as an unboosted Earthquake will sometimes fail to OHKO Ninetales, which can be a huge pain for rain teams. With regard to other moves, if another Pokemon can provide Stealth Rock support, Substitute and Hone Claws can fill the last two moveslots, allowing Dugtrio to boost up against any enemies that are Choice-locked into Electric-type moves, such as Jolteon.</p> <p>The EV spread for this set is quite standard for a revenge killer: maximum investment in Attack and Speed, along with a Jolly nature, ensures that Dugtrio outspeeds everything it possibly can while crumpling weakened foes underneath its attacks. This set is not necessarily set in stone, however: 8 EVs can be removed from either Attack or Speed and placed into HP, allowing Dugtrio to switch into Stealth Rock, take two Seismic Tosses, and survive with 1 HP. If Stealth Rock is not a concern thanks to Rapid Spin support, Dugtrio can use 0 HP EVs and a 21 HP IV to take two Seismic Tosses and survive with 1 HP. Additionally, an Adamant nature can be considered on this set so that Dugtrio can make up for the lack of a power-boosting item, but it will lose the ability to outrun maximum Speed base 115s, such as Espeon and Raikou.</p> <p>Though this set is perfect for removing Tyranitar, the additional ability to remove the bulky special walls Chansey and Blissey makes this Dugtrio extremely applicable outside of its niche in weather teams. When it comes to teammates, Pokemon that appreciate the removal of the three aforementioned threats make excellent options. Calm Mind Espeon can take advantage of Dugtrio's ability to eliminate Chansey for it, while Dugtrio can also use Reversal to remove other Dark-types that threaten Espeon. Magic Bounce can also be extremely useful for setting Stealth Rock up if Dugtrio doesn't get the opportunity. Volcarona is another powerful special sweeper that appreciates the removal of Chansey and Blissey. Additionally, Volcarona can come in on the Ice- and Grass-type moves that Dugtrio draws, while Dugtrio can save Volcarona from potentially deadly Rock-type attacks, though both are weak to Water-type attacks. Espeon works well alongside Volcarona too, as Magic Bounce can keep Stealth Rock off the field. Choice Specs Latios appreciates the removal of Tyranitar, and can Trick its item onto Blissey to remove its Shed Shell, preventing it from escaping from Dugtrio.</p> <p>While this Dugtrio has the capability to set up Stealth Rock, it nonetheless appreciates other entry hazards. Ferrothorn has excellent defensive synergy with Dugtrio, as it resists Water- and Grass-type attacks, can set up Spikes, and can provide Thunder Wave support for Dugtrio. The additional hazard damage allows Dugtrio to potentially run an Adamant nature or place extra EVs in Defense to avoid getting OHKOed by Pursuit or priority attacks. Rapid Spin support is also mandatory for this set, as its Focus Sash will be useless otherwise. Tentacruel makes for a great partner thanks to its resistance to Water-type attacks and ability to immediately remove Toxic Spikes. This Dugtrio, though specifically a Tyranitar counter rather than a weather counter in general, can still break through Ninetales and Abomasnow, making it a strong contender for a place on a rain team. With Drizzle and a resistance to Water-type attacks, Politoed would work well in tandem with Dugtrio and a rain Volcarona.</p> "

        "description": "<p>The combination of blistering Speed, moderate attacking prowess, and Arena Trap makes Dugtrio a deadly threat to unprepared teams, which will often be forced to sacrifice a Pokemon to Dugtrio's wrath. Earthquake is the most powerful move on this set thanks to STAB, allowing Dugtrio to forcibly strike the Pokemon it has trapped for heavy damage, often resulting in a casualty if the opponent has taken prior damage. Stone Edge is an excellent move for this set, granting great coverage alongside Earthquake. Stone Edge is also incredibly powerful, especially against the Flying-type Pokemon that are immune to Arena Trap. Levitate users, unfortunately, also manage to avoid Arena Trap. Thankfully, many of them are weak to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, making Sucker Punch and Shadow Claw excellent options for the last two slots. Sucker Punch is also incredibly useful for damaging Pokemon that outspeed Dugtrio, such as Choice Scarf Chandelure, which will always be OHKOed after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Choice Band is the preferred item on Dugtrio to maximize its damage output. As Dugtrio will often be switching in and out anyway thanks to its terrible bulk and inability to survive even weak attacks, it doesn't mind being locked into one move. A Life Orb, however, can be used instead so that Dugtrio doesn't have to switch immediately after a revenge kill; this can also quite possibly surprise opponents expecting to use Dugtrio as setup bait. If using a Life Orb, Substitute can be used over Shadow Claw to let Dugtrio set up against threats locked into Electric-type moves, such as Choice Scarf Genesect locked into Thunderbolt. The EVs are quite simple: maximum investment in Attack allows Dugtrio to net as many KOs as possible, while a Jolly nature and 224 Speed EVs allow Dugtrio to outspeed all base 115 Speed foes, including Starmie and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. The remaining 32 EVs are put in Defense so that Dugtrio can avoid getting KOed by priority attacks or weaker Pursuits.</p> <p>In a metagame so strongly influenced by weather, Dugtrio makes an excellent addition to any weather-based team that wishes to swing the forces of nature in its own favor. In particular, it shines especially brightly on a rain team, because Choice Band Dugtrio OHKOes Ninetales with Earthquake and Abomasnow with Stone Edge, and possibly Tyranitar too after one round of Stealth Rock damage. This ability to trap and defeat opposing weather inducers is absolutely incredible for any rain team. Dugtrio's inability to deal with opposing Politoed doesn't hamper its usefulness either, as rain will be up regardless. A Politoed of your own is necessary on a rain team. Politoed's resistance to Water- and Ice-type attacks means it synergizes well with Dugtrio, which in return is immune to Electric-type attacks that will fry Politoed. Tentacruel is another great partner that provides Rapid Spin support for the team, which is quite useful due to Dugtrio's terrible HP stat. Additionally, Tentacruel's Water / Poison typing gives it a neutrality to the Grass-type attacks that harm both Dugtrio and Politoed, while it benefits hugely from Drizzle thanks to Rain Dish. Tentacruel also has the fantastic ability to set up Toxic Spikes, which allows Dugtrio to defeat Chansey and Blissey that lack Aromatherapy.</p> <p>Entry hazards are incredibly useful for this revenge killer; in particular, Stealth Rock enables Dugtrio to OHKO some variants of Tyranitar, as well as all variants of Chandelure. Flying-types that are immune to Arena Trap will also be more hesitant to face Dugtrio if Stealth Rock is on the field, as they will take massive damage when they switch in. Ferrothorn's excellent typing provides it with resistances to Water-, Grass-, and Electric-type moves, with the latter two being especially important to rain teams. The weakening of Fire-type moves under rain also improves Ferrothorn's chances of surviving a stray Flamethrower or Hidden Power Fire. Most importantly, Ferrothorn's ability to deal indirect damage to the opponent via Stealth Rock, Spikes, Leech Seed, and Iron Barbs, as well as its ability to provide paralysis support with Thunder Wave, allows Dugtrio to net more KOs with its powerful moves.</p> <p>Dugtrio is a rather good counter to Rapid Spin users as well: Cloyster loses to Stone Edge, Tentacruel falls to Earthquake, and Starmie is OHKOed by Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Forretress's mighty Gyro Ball and Earthquake pose problems for Dugtrio, but variants with only Volt Switch are absolutely helpless against it. Dugtrio does have many problems dealing with Donphan, however, as its massive Defense stat means that it isn't as easily taken out as the other spinners are. Additionally, Donphan's access to Toxic and Roar practically force Dugtrio to flee for its life. Conversely, though, Donphan will struggle against the other members of a rain team, including Politoed itself, as well as Rotom-W. Lastly, Dugtrio struggles to defeat Pokemon that utilize Shed Shell, such as Blissey, making Trick users such as Choice Specs Latios ideal teammates.</p> "

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar is one of only two famed OU veterans that have been OU for all five generations. It owes this to its excellent Special Attack and Speed stats, immunities to Ground-, Normal-, and Fighting-type attacks and to the poison status, as well as a concise movepool that grew with each passing generation. This generation, the only thing it gained was a 100% accurate Disable, as well as Dream World-exclusive competition from Chandelure. Gengar is now perhaps best known for its SubDisable set, with which it can dismantle many Fighting-types, be they the old favorites Lucario and Infernape, or new introductions such as Terrakion and Conkeldurr. In Dream World, however, Gengar's Pursuit weakness is compounded by its ability to be trapped and OHKOed by Choice Scarf Chandelure if it isn't wielding a Choice Scarf itself. Both these threats cripple Gengar, but it is still very useful in the Dream World metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gengar's competitive movepool isn't very large, and most of its usable options are already listed. It gets Hypnosis and Will-O-Wisp to inflict status, but neither move is very accurate, and both are better left to bulkier Pokemon that can afford to miss. Focus Punch was an option on Gengar sets in past generations as a way to defeat Blissey and Chansey, but now that Explosion has been nerfed, running a physical move on Gengar is not recommended at all due to its awful Attack stat. Taunt can be used on the SubDisable set over Focus Blast or Pain Split to stop Gengar from being setup bait against Pokemon it cannot touch, such as Scrafty. Energy Ball hits Water / Ground types where Thunderbolt can't, but hits virtually all other Water-types for less damage. A lead set with Focus Sash and Destiny Bond is almost guaranteed a KO, but is useless if it is not in the lead spot and enemy hazards go up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gengar boasts excellent coverage and a very short list of counters, but as it is weak to Pursuit and can be annihilated by Choice Scarf Chandelure, it can still find it hard to stick around. Scizor is the Pursuit user that bothers Gengar the most, as it plays a deadly mindgame with Gengar that the latter can rarely win: Bullet Punch OHKOes Gengar if it stays in, and Pursuit OHKOes if it switches out. Only if Gengar is carrying Hidden Power Fire and is gutsy enough to use it on a predicted Pursuit can it bring down Scizor. Tyranitar, on the other hand, fears Focus Blast, but as long as it is running enough Special Defense or the move misses, it can OHKO with Pursuit regardless of whether Gengar stays in or not. Choice Scarf Chandelure, of course, can trap and pick off any variant not carrying a Choice Scarf of its own. In a pinch, Latios can survive one non-Life Orb Shadow Ball and banish Gengar from existence with either Draco Meteor or Psyshock. Choice Scarf users in general give Gengar issues, as it is too frail to take a hit from Pokemon such as Terrakion, Garchomp, and other powerful Pokemon it would normally outspeed.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "SubDisable",
        "description": "<p>This set is one of the most common for Gengar in BW, and for good reason. It can put a stop to many slower Pokemon, including almost every Fighting-type in the game; the one notable exception is Scrafty, who commonly has both Crunch and Ice Punch to hit Gengar with. Substitute blocks status and acts as a pseudo-Protect against slower opponents, allowing you to scout their move and then Disable it. It also blocks Leech Seed and Thunder Wave, and eases prediction if the opponent should switch out. Disable is the crux of the set, neutering anything that has only one move capable of hitting Gengar and forcing Choice-locked Pokemon to switch. With hazards on the field, the immense amount of switching this set causes quickly whittles down the opponent's team.</p> <p>Shadow Ball is required to prevent Gengar from becoming Taunt bait, against opponents such as Jellicent and Deoxys-S. The last slot has two main options: Focus Blast puts a more offensive spin on the set, by preventing Steel-types—who are immune to Toxic Spikes—from walling Gengar. Alternatively, Pain Split gives Gengar some more longevity. Neither option can defeat Chansey, but as Chansey can do literally nothing to Gengar when the latter is hiding behind a Substitute, this is mitigated somewhat.</p> <p>Depending on what secondary option you choose in the fourth slot, Gengar will have issues with certain Pokemon. Tyranitar can destroy Gengar if it lacks Focus Blast and doesn't have a Substitute up; it doesn't particularly mind Disable either, as it has two powerful STAB moves to hit Gengar with. Pain Split doesn't work very well against anything with a low HP stat, such as Rotom-W. It also can't do lethal damage, meaning the Normal-types that are immune to Shadow Ball cannot be KOed by Gengar at all. Either way, anything with more than one move to use against Gengar and a resistance to Shadow Ball can easily take it on. In addition, Roar and Whirlwind ignore Substitute and can't be Disabled unless the move was used the turn before and dragged Gengar into the battle. Fighting-types make excellent partners to take out Steel- and Dark-types, with Terrakion being a good example. Terrakion hates other Fighting-types, as well as Psychic- and Ghost-types, which Gengar can defeat with ease. In return, Terrakion can set up with Swords Dance or Rock Polish and sweep. Rotom-W also makes a good teammate as it can either fry or drown common phazers such as Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Heatran with the appropriate STAB move.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Gengar's excellent offensive stats also allow it to successfully run a Choice Scarf set, with the Speed boost of Choice Scarf allowing it to dash past everything up to and including +2 Adamant Dragon Dance Dragonite. Shadow Ball is the obvious STAB move of choice, as it allows Gengar to surprise the dreaded Chandelure and OHKO it before it can even move. Focus Blast is the next most important move, granting Gengar perfect neutral coverage and the ability to hit Tyranitar, Chansey, and Excadrill for super effective damage. Unfortunately, Gengar doesn't even come close to scoring a 2HKO on Chansey or Blissey with Focus Blast, and also misses the OHKO on specially defensive variants of Tyranitar, so a strong physical Fighting-type, such as Terrakion, is an excellent partner.</p> <p>Trick is an excellent move in Gengar's arsenal and is its only true weapon against Chansey and other powerful special walls. By handing them an unwanted Choice Scarf, they are crippled for the rest of the match and become easy setup bait for the correct Pokemon. The final slot is a toss-up since Gengar already boasts perfect coverage with its first two attacks. Hidden Power Fire seems redundant with Focus Blast in Gengar's repertoire, but Gengar can use it to ambush and destroy Choice Scarf Genesect, while achieving a slightly more powerful and much more accurate hit on Ferrothorn. Hidden Power Ice can OHKO Dragonite if Multiscale is broken, and also hits Garchomp and Salamence for 4x super effective damage. Finally, Thunderbolt allows Gengar to strike Water-type foes for more damage than Shadow Ball. While this comes in especially handy against rain teams, it is usually a lesser option compared to Gengar's other moves.</p> <p>Chandelure seems like it would outclass Gengar in the role of a Choice Scarf user, especially since it boasts a higher Special Attack set, a much better offensive dual STAB combo, and the Shadow Tag ability. It is also far easier to put on a team than Gengar as it doesn't have to worry about predicting switches. However, Gengar is far from outclassed as it has a much higher Speed stat, and its Special Attack stat isn't that much worse than Chandelure's. In addition, Choice Scarf Gengar can surprise and eliminate enemy Chandelure without fail, as long as it is not trapped while locked into a move besides Shadow Ball. It is also far less bothered by hazards, being neutral to Stealth Rock and entirely immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Furthermore, Gengar has Focus Blast and Trick, two moves that turn Chandelure green with envy. However, Gengar cannot guarantee that the opponent will not switch out to a counter, so your choice between the two depends on which better fits your team: Gengar's better Speed and offensive movepool versus Chandelure's trapping ability and weakness to entry hazards.</p> <p>Destiny Bond is an interesting move, as Gengar's massive Speed stat allows it to practically guarantee a kill, but it requires that Gengar forgo a coverage move. Use it only if you feel Shadow Ball and Focus Blast provide enough coverage.</p> <p>Gengar highly appreciates strong physical Fighting-types as partners due to its weakness to Pursuit and inability to muscle past some dedicated special walls. Terrakion is one of the best choices, as it gains an Attack boost from Dark-type moves—besides Pursuit—that are aimed at Gengar, while Gengar can switch in on Ground- and Fighting-type moves that Terrakion hates. They share a weakness to Psychic-type moves, however, and Scizor can OHKO both with Bullet Punch, so a Steel-type such as defensive Heatran will help. By eliminating Genesect and Chandelure, as well as physical walls such as Gliscor and Skarmory, Choice Scarf Gengar can open up holes for Swords Dance Garchomp to sweep, as the former two can commonly outspeed it and OHKO it with Ice-type moves, while the latter Pokemon can take its hits with relative ease. Choice Scarf Gengar blows away Jellicent, as well as Latios and Latias after some residual damage, allowing Calm Mind Keldeo to rip apart the opposing team. Keldeo also doesn't mind Gengar's inability to deal with Chansey, as Keldeo has Secret Sword to destroy it.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Life Orb Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This set focuses less on team support and hit-and-run tactics, and instead tries to clean up on its own. Life Orb Gengar is a fantastic late-game sweeper, especially after priority users such as Scizor are removed. Shadow Ball is on the set as it is Gengar's best STAB option, while Focus Blast gives it all-important perfect offensive coverage in two moves, and helps it to get past most Steel-types that resist Shadow Ball, such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, who are both 2HKOed with Stealth Rock. With the Life Orb boost, Latios is now always OHKOed by Shadow Ball even before Stealth Rock, while 252/252+ Tyranitar has an excellent chance to be OHKOed by Focus Blast with Stealth Rock.</p> <p>The last two slots largely consist of filler options, which can be changed to suit your team's needs. Thunderbolt is excellent for achieving the OHKO on Skarmory with Stealth Rock, as well as hitting Water-types not named Jellicent or Slowbro harder than Shadow Ball. For example, the standard 248/8 Vaporeon is never 2HKOed by Shadow Ball, but Thunderbolt always KOes it even without hazards. Hidden Power Fire knocks out Scizor, Forretress, and Genesect in one hit, and Ferrothron in two. It does, however, lower Gengar's Speed IV by one point, causing it to always be outsped by dangerous threats such as Latios and opposing Gengar. Hidden Power Ice stops Dragon-types cold, OHKOing even 252/252+ Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage 100% of the time. Pain Split allows Gengar to heal off some of the Life Orb damage it has accrued if you feel the first three slots provide enough coverage.</p> <p>Sucker Punch users, Scizor, and Azumarill can all OHKO Gengar before it can move; the same applies to Choice Scarf users such as Latios and Chandelure. Tyranitar can Pursuit these latter threats to death, but the sandstorm it summons reduces Gengar's already short lifespan even further. A bulky Water-type such as Vaporeon resists both Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet, and takes no damage from Sucker Punch as it switches in. Vaporeon can also pass Wishes to Gengar, and burn Scizor and Azumarill with Scald. This Gengar variant performs best as a late-game sweeper, but it can remove threats such as Mew and Reuniclus after residual damage mid-game to allow Fighting-type sweepers an easier time at ending the game.</p> <p>Thunder can replace any move on the set if you have rain support. Its 30% paralysis chance and immense power are both very welcome—in fact, it hits just as hard as Gengar's STAB Shadow Ball on an opponent neutral to both. Sludge Bomb is a secondary STAB option that can annihilate Breloom and Serperior, but its poor coverage makes it a niche move that should only be given the nod if either of those two Grass-types trouble you. Substitute and Destiny Bond are both usable over some of Gengar's less important coverage moves, with Substitute easing prediction and Destiny Bond giving Gengar a way to destroy any Pokemon at the cost of its own life.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>With Raikou's Dream World ability, Volt Absorb, it can serve as one the best Thundurus checks in the metagame. While Jolteon might give Raikou competition, Raikou's superior bulk and access to Calm Mind allow Raikou to differentiate itself from it. With base 115 Special Attack and Speed, as well as a workable movepool, it's hard to go terribly wrong with Raikou. Take advantage of Raikou's strengths and it will not disappoint.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Raikou's movepool is pretty barren. Aura Sphere is probably the elephant in the room in terms of other moves that Raikou can run; with a Rash nature and a Calm Mind boost, it will deal huge amounts of damage to Tyranitar. However, Raikou will not be able to make full use of its excellent Speed. Extreme Speed is another event move that Raikou was given, but it is better off doing other things, although the chance to pick off weakened Dugtrio that try to revenge kill Raikou is interesting. Raikou can use Charge Beam to finish off a weakened Pokemon and gain a Special Attack boost at the same time, but Calm Mind is superior the vast majority of the time. Raikou can also run other Hidden Power types, although Hidden Power Ice is superior in most situations. Hidden Power Grass allows Raikou to destroy Gastrodon, Swampert, and Quagsire, Hidden Power Water destroys Excadrill in the rain, and Hidden Power Fire gives Raikou a weapon to use against Ferrothorn. Furthermore, Raikou can run a Calm Mind + RestTalk set, but it is way too easy to wall. It also has other support moves such as dual screens as well as Roar, but again, Raikou's niche is generally not one that should focus on supporting.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Sand inducers, namely Tyranitar and Hippowdon, and sand sweepers, such as Excadrill and Sandslash, are Raikou's biggest enemies. Tyranitar's massive Special Defense allows it to tank anything Raikou throws at it—apart from boosted Aura Spheres—and retaliate with Crunch or Stone Edge. Hippowdon can take a hit and OHKO with Earthquake, while Excadrill and Sandslash outspeed and OHKO with their own Earthquake. Excadrill is especially threatening because it takes a pittance from Hidden Power Ice. Choice Scarf variants of Garchomp and Landorus can also outspeed and revenge kill Raikou. Blissey and Chansey grow bored with Raikou's attempts to get past them, as they can simply Seismic Toss the saber-toothed tiger to oblivion while recovering off any damage with Soft-Boiled. Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Swampert also wall Raikou if it lacks Hidden Power Grass. If Raikou is not holding an Air Balloon, Dugtrio can easily trap and OHKO it with Earthquake. Toxic Spikes are also annoying for Raikou, as they severely undermine its good bulk; Tentacruel, Roserade, and Forretress are the main users of Toxic Spikes to watch out for.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>The old standard from ADV returns for another round in DW OU. With Raikou's superior Speed and good special bulk, it is arguably the best Thundurus check in the metagame. Raikou is completely immune to Thundurus's Electric-type STAB moves as well as Thunder Wave. Unlike Jolteon, however, Raikou can shrug off a Focus Blast from the thunder genie a lot more easily while immediately threatening to deal a large amount of damage with its own Electric-type STAB or simply to set up Calm Minds.</p> <p>The idea behind the set is to switch into something Raikou can force out, such as Lightning Rod Zapdos or bulky Water-types, set up a Substitute, and proceed to gather Calm Mind boosts. The other option is to set up Calm Mind boosts on relatively weak special attackers as they become increasingly unable to break Raikou's Substitutes. Thunderbolt is Raikou's main STAB option, although Thunder can easily replace it you're using Raikou on a rain team for the extra power and paralysis chance. Hidden Power Ice boasts the widest coverage alongside Raikou's STAB, as well as the ability to KO dangerous threats such as Garchomp, Salamence, Landorus, and Dragonite.</p> <p>The EV spread presented takes advantage of Raikou's special bulk. With the given EVs in HP and Special Defense, uninvested Politoed's Scald will never break +1 Raikou's Substitutes in the rain, while a neutral unboosted Hidden Power from Zapdos and Thundurus fails to break unboosted Raikou's Substitute. The HP EVs also prevent Tyranitar's unboosted Pursuit from breaking Raikou's Substitute. Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Raikou to take advantage of its Speed stat while Speed tying with Starmie and Azelf. The remaining EVs go into Special Attack to power up Raikou's attacks. Raikou can use Hidden Power Grass in the final slot if Gastrodon is a huge problem, or Hidden Power Fire to dent Ferrothorn. However, both options are generally inferior to Hidden Power Ice as they do not offer the same coverage against more dangerous threats.</p> <p>Sand teams are Raikou's biggest enemies. Not only does Tyranitar hard counter Raikou, but the most prominent sand sweeper, Excadrill, takes little damage from Hidden Power Ice, outspeeds Raikou, and OHKOes it with Earthquake. Bulky Ground-types such as Gastrodon and specially defensive Quagsire, as well as Blissey and Chansey, also wall Raikou easily. Therefore, Swords Dance Breloom is one of Raikou's best friends. It can easily revenge kill Excadrill with Mach Punch, set up on the aforementioned bulky Ground-types, and take them out with Bullet Seed. Skarmory can use its amazing physical bulk to wall Excadrill and can set up Spikes on the defensive Pokemon. Air Balloon Terrakion can check Excadrill once, set up Rock Polish, and sweep quite easily. Dugtrio is excellent to run alongside Raikou as well, as it can trap and KO Tyranitar, thus winning the weather war and removing one of Raikou's counters. Toxic Spikes support can help cripple some of Raikou's counters, such as Gastrodon, Chansey, and Blissey. Tentacruel offers good synergy with Raikou, as Raikou can switch into Electric-type attacks aimed at it. Forretress is another good teammate that easily sets up on Choice Scarf Garchomp, which could potentially revenge kill Raikou.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set takes full advantage of Raikou's excellent offensive stats. Its base 115 Special Attack and Speed stats, as well as access to Calm Mind and good coverage, simply beg for an offensive sweeper set. Calm Mind allows Raikou to boost its Special Attack to high levels. A boosted Thunder will dent virtually everything that doesn't resist it, while Hidden Power Ice maximizes coverage. Thunderbolt can be used instead of Thunder if not using rain, while Hidden Power Fighting is usable as it is Raikou's best weapon against Tyranitar. Keep in mind, however, that Hidden Power Fighting requires Raikou to use an imperfect Speed IV, which means it must forfeit the Speed-tie with Starmie. Extrasensory is used in the last slot because Raikou's movepool doesn't contain much else, though it can be helpful to OHKO Toxicroak, which gives rain teams a lot of problems. Alternatively, Shadow Ball hits Latias and Latios harder, and should be used alongside Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p>You might wonder why Raikou is not running any of its DPP event moves, namely Aura Sphere and Weather Ball. The reason is simple: event Raikou must use a Rash nature. While the event moves give much better coverage than the listed options, Raikou needs a Timid nature to be successful. Without it, Raikou gets outsped by Thundurus, Latias, Latios, Landorus, and Keldeo, which it cannot afford. The event moves are also incompatible with the Volt Absorb ability, which takes away Raikou's excellent ability to check Thundurus.</p> <p>Life Orb is the preferred held item, as it powers up Raikou's moves for sweeping. Air Balloon is also good, however, as it allows Raikou to avoid Ground-type moves for a turn. In particular, this prevents it from being revenge killed by Excadrill and other fast Ground-types.</p> <p>Offensive Calm Mind Raikou detests sand teams. Dugtrio can trap and remove Tyranitar, while Breloom takes out many of Raikou's counters, such as Excadrill, Gastrodon, Blissey, and Chansey. Double Dance Terrakion also gives many sand teams trouble. Additionally, without the protection of a Substitute, Choice Scarf revenge killers, such as Landorus and Garchomp, can easily OHKO Raikou as long as they do not switch into Hidden Power Ice; for a similar reason, Dugtrio is a major thorn in Raikou's side too. Therefore, Pokemon that can set up on Ground-type moves are good teammates. Again, Breloom does this job admirably, but so do Virizion and Serperior. Rock Polish Landorus can also set up on Choice-locked Ground-type attacks.</p> "

With Choice Specs, Raikou will severely hurt anything that doesn't resist its STAB moves, while with a Choice Scarf, it becomes an excellent revenge killer, reaching 541 Speed. While Jolteon might seem better at this role, Raikou's bulk once again saves the day; the ability to switch into any of Thundurus's attacks is a major advantage for Raikou. Raikou is also more powerful than Jolteon and has access to better coverage moves. Thunder and Thunderbolt are Raikou's main STAB attacks, while Volt Switch allows it to keep momentum for the team. Shadow Ball enables Raikou to hit Latias, Latios, and Celebi for super effective damage. If outspeeding Thundurus and other Pokemon between base 101 and base 113 Speed is not important, Weather Ball is an incredible move in both rain and sun that greatly improves Raikou's coverage.</p> <p>Especially if using Choice Specs, the recommended combination is a Timid nature with the Volt Absorb ability and Shadow Ball in the last moveslot, as outspeeding Thundurus is extremely important. However, if your team is well-equipped to deal with the threats in the base 101 to 113 Speed range, then a Rash nature with Weather Ball and Pressure gives much better coverage. The loss of the positive Speed nature is not as important with a Choice Scarf, as Rash Raikou can still outspeed base 100s.</p> <p>Bulky Ground-types are a thorn in Raikou's side as always, especially when it's spamming Volt Switch in the early-game. Breloom is a great partner to Raikou as it easily sets up on defensive Ground-types, Serperior can spam Leaf Storm without fear, and Virizion and Celebi are also great Grass-types. Pokemon that can make VoltTurn combinations with Raikou are also good teammates, as they allow you to keep offensive momentum. Genesect is the premier U-turn user in Dream World; Scizor and Landorus are very potent as well. Such a strategy also appreciates the use of entry hazards, which Deoxys-S can effortlessly lay down. Obviously, if you're running Weather Ball, Raikou appreciates weather support from either Politoed or Ninetales, particularly the former as it allows Raikou to spam 100% accurate Thunders.</p> "

  "Ninetales": {
    "overview": "<p>From the dawn of competitive Pokemon until the BW generation, Ninetales was always an inferior Pokemon. Its decent Speed and Special Defense were hardly enough to make up for its disappointingly low offenses, especially given its movepool. When abilities rolled around, even Flash Fire couldn't save it from  mediocrity. Seemingly out of nowhere, though, things changed. Permanent sun finally became an option below Ubers when Ninetales obtained Drought, making Chlorophyll sweepers viable. Its decent special movepool, including powerful sun-boosted STAB Fire Blast and an instantaneous Solar Beam, allows for excellent coverage.  Powerful Fire-types such as Chandelure, Volcarona, and the Dream World-legal Speed Boost Blaziken, as well as Chlorophyll sweepers such as  Growth Venusaur, are devastating forces in today's Dream World metagame. However, not all fares well for Ninetales. Its general frailty, weakness to Stealth Rock, and the inability to set up immediate sun as a lead thanks to it outspeeding all other weather starters make Ninetales a liability in some cases. It is also outsped by many powerful physical attackers, such as Terrakion, making Ninetales an easy target. Don't let these flaws stop you from using Ninetales, as its vital team support and surprisingly powerful Nasty Plot set allow you to rip through teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ninetales does have the option to run a  specially defensive set  with utility moves such as Will-O-Wisp and  Hypnosis, with Chesto Berry  and Rest for one time instant recovery.  Toxic can be used on the Sunny  Day set, as it hampers both Politoed and  Tyranitar. Choice Specs is a  possibility, granting an immediate boost  to its powerful Fire Blast,  but locking Ninetales into the wrong attack  can seal its fate if it  needs to switch in again due to its  vulnerability to all entry hazards  and low bulk. For its offensive  sets, Ninetales has very little room for  attacks. Hidden Power Ice is  almost pointless, as Fire Blast does  massive damage to any Dragon-type  that's not Dragonite behind  Multiscale. It also leaves Ninetales  completely walled by Heatran. If you are  tempted to use Psyshock, do  the math and you will change your mind. Not  only does it have no  business on the Nasty Plot set, but Fire Blast hits  Chansey and Blissey  significantly harder in the sun, and its ability to  2HKO them outright  is a testament to Ninetales's Power. In fact, in  almost any case where  Psyshock outdamages Fire Blast, both will 2HKO  anyway! The only  relevant exception to this is Tentacruel, who indeed  does have a chance  to be OHKOed by Psyshock.</p> <h1>Why Not to Lead with Ninetales</h1> <p>A common mistake for new players is to use  Ninetales as a lead  to bring in the sunshine immediately. It must be  stressed, however, that  no Ninetales set functions as a lead unless the  other team lacks an  instant weather starter. The reason for this is  that Ninetales outspeeds  Tyranitar, Politoed, and Hippowdon, who will  always get their weather  up, as opposed to sun, when used one-on-one.  You might think of reducing Ninetales's Speed to nearly guarantee  instant sun in the lead position.  However, it is nearly impossible to  underspeed Hippowdon without the  extremely gimmicky Iron Ball, and  Ninetales's high 100 base Speed is  almost as vital to its success as  Drought! Obviously, Ninetales will be  forced to switch out, fearing a  super effective attack from Tyranitar or  Politoed, giving instant  momentum to your opponent. Use your first turn  to set up entry hazards  instead of losing your weather setter so early  in the match.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Without perpetual sun, Ninetales is at  serious risk of being  manhandled. Its primary rival weather starters,  Tyranitar and Politoed,  are able to switch in on any set bar Sunny Day  and force out Ninetales as  both hit it super effectively with their  STAB moves. However, they must  be careful not to switch into Hypnosis  or Will-O-Wisp (especially in  Tyranitar's case), allowing Ninetales to  switch out and reset its weather  later. It is also a good idea to scout  for which Hidden Power Ninetales  carries. If it carries Hidden Power  Ground, only Air Balloon Heatran can  switch in, but this gives  Dragonite the perfect opportunity to switch  in and start boosting with  Dragon Dance. Still, both Pokemon fear status  from Hypnosis or  Will-O-Wisp, as Dragonite is outsped and Salamence has  a chance to lose  the Speed tie, so tread carefully. Blissey and Chansey  can easily  switch in, threaten Ninetales with status from Thunder Wave  or Toxic,  and wall it to hell and back. Terrakion outspeeds Ninetales  and OHKOes  with either of its STAB moves, but it must be careful not to  switch  into Solar Beam or Will-O-Wisp. All  entry hazards inflict massive pain on  Ninetales, with Stealth Rock and  Spikes taking at least 25% of its  health every time it switches in, and  Toxic Spikes limiting its sweeping  time. Latios and Latias resist all  of Ninetales's attacks and can take  it out with a well placed Draco  Meteor, but a predicted Fire Blast will  deal respectable damage to  them. Finally, Dugtrio is a surefire way to  remove Ninetales,  outspeeding and hitting it hard with its moderately  powerful super  effective Earthquake.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Sunny Day",
        "description": "<p>Sunny Day seems like an inferior move on Ninetales, given the fact that it sets up permanent sun upon switching in, but Ninetales is easy prey for Tyranitar and Politoed, who typically have no problem switching into Ninetales's unboosted Fire Blast. The goal here is to use Sunny Day while your opponent switches, allowing it to outspeed all weather starters and abusers without a Choice Scarf and pull off an instant Solar Beam. Both Politoed and Tyranitar lose their weather effects, eliminating the usual risks involved with Solar Beam and 2HKOing non-bulky variants should they decide to stay in. Hypnosis is a great option in case your opponent decides not to switch in their weather starter, buying you an extra turn to either stay in and use Sunny Day while they actually do sent out their weather starter or to switch out and trap your opponent with Chandelure or Dugtrio.</p> <p>The EVs seem strange, but they serve several purposes: maximize Special Attack, outspeed Adamant Excadrill and all slower weather abusers who lack a Choice Scarf, and survive a Politoed's Modest Choice Specs Hydro Pump and 2HKO with Solar Beam. An alternate spread of 252 SpA / 96 SpD / 160 Spe can be used if you are afraid of Jolly Excadrill, but Hydro Pump is almost guaranteed to OHKO Ninetales with previous damage. This situation is not exactly commonplace, but this goes to show how effective its special bulk is. Any Pokemon with the ability to trap, namely Dugtrio and Chandelure, make great partners to Sunny Day Ninetales. Dugtrio is an excellent choice to whittle away at your opponent's weather starter, but Politoed has an easy time handling Dugtrio. Chandelure can be used alongside  Dugtrio, trapping various Pokemon that Dugtrio can't and hitting them hard with a powerful sun-boosted Fire Blast. Volcarona, Blaziken, and Venusaur are all fantastic partners; the former two boost their stats to unbelievable heights and the latter gains +2 in both of its attacking stats with Growth while outspeeding and running through teams with its excellent mixed offensive movepool. Hidden Power Ice can be used in the last slot, allowing Ninetales to actually hit Dragonite hard through Multiscale as well as harming Salamence and Garchomp on the switch. Air Balloon can be used  to switch in on Excadrill and force a switch or burn it to a crisp then and there and to escape any Dugtrio that tries to trap it. Hidden Power Ground is another option to hit Heatran, but it eats away a slot that can be filled by a status move.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<p>With Nasty Plot and a Life Orb, Ninetales  becomes an unorthodox  and deceptively powerful special attacker.  Infinite sun boosts Fire  Blast to incredible levels and allows  Ninetales to use a risk-free  Solar Beam, offering fantastic coverage  with the Hidden Power of your  choice. As with any boosting set, send in  Ninetales against a support  Pokemon who cannot do much to it, boost  with Nasty Plot, and terrorize  your opponent. To give you an idea of  Ninetales's power after one Nasty  Plot boost, Fire Blast 2HKOes all but  the bulkiest of Dragonite through  Multiscale and also has a guaranteed  2HKO on physically defensive Chansey  and Blissey. In fact, no Pokemon  in the game bar Dragonite itself can  afford to set up on Ninetales.  Gyarados? Bulky Dragon Dance has about a  1% chance of surviving Fire  Blast after Stealth Rock damage. Salamence  faces a similar fate. All  jokes aside, Fire Blast is so  powerful that Solar Beam and Hidden Power  Ground are merely accessories.  Remember that a resisted Fire Blast is  more powerful than a neutral  Solar Beam, so only use Solar Beam against  those who resist Fire Blast or  are weak to Solar Beam. Hidden Power Ground is literally only for  Heatran; Fire Blast already 2HKOes  Tentacruel.</p> <p>As usual, Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast thanks to   100% accuracy, but the power drop is quite noticeable. Energy Ball is a   safe alternative to Solar Beam in case Tyranitar or Politoed decide  to  switch in, but that's just what it is: safe. Solar Beam's 120 Base  Power  is just too good to pass up, and once any opposing weather  starters  are out of the match, you will be glad you have that power on  your  side. Hidden Power Fighting hits specially defensive Tyranitar  lacking a  Chople Berry for 69.3 - 82.17% damage in sand and outright  OHKOes  offensive variants after entry hazards, assuming Ninetales used  Nasty  Plot during the switch. Use your best judgment in this situation;  make  sure that Tyranitar has taken enough prior damage, particularly  from  entry hazards. Hidden Power Fighting still hits Heatran for decent   damage and ignores its Air Balloon, but fails to OHKO specially  defensive  variants. Leftovers and Air Balloon can be considered over  Life Orb.  The former grants much needed recovery to offset entry hazard  damage;  the latter allows you to switch in on an opposing Excadrill's  Earthquake  and then set up Nasty Plot if it has a Choice Band, or  simply attack it  so it doesn't hit you with Rock Slide. More so than  ever, Nasty Plot  Ninetales absolutely must have trap support from  Dugtrio to get rid of  Heatran and Tyranitar, who otherwise don't have  much trouble handling  this set.</p> "

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel is the epitome of the word ''utility,'' as it can lay down Toxic Spikes, absorb them, use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, and more. Tentacruel also has Rain Dish, an amazing ability that gradually heals Tentacruel in the rain, making it a perfect candidate for rain stall teams. In addition, Tentacruel is surprisingly fast for a defensive Pokemon—with a base 100 Speed stat, it can outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Breloom. As if that wasn't enough, Tentacruel has little to fear from the dreaded Chandelure (except for the occasional Hidden Power Ground), unlike most other walls. That being said, though, Tentacruel easily falls prey to hard-hitting physical attackers. Tentacruel is also not immune to powerful special attackers, particularly Latios and Manaphy, both of which are major threats to rain teams. If you can keep these threats at bay, though, Tentacruel will serve your team well.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tentacruel has a lot of other interesting support moves to use, such as Haze, Magic Coat, Knock Off, and Confuse Ray. Unfortunately, all moves listed on the sets are crucial, so it will rarely have an opportunity to use them. Tentacruel could also use Pain Split as a form of pseudo-recovery, although it will be difficult finding a free moveslot to use it. Tentacruel has access to powerful moves such as Hydro Pump, Sludge Wave, and Giga Drain. It can use these moves to form an offensive Rapid Spin set; Tentacruel is surprisingly fast, and your opponent, mistaking Tentacruel as a defensive Pokemon, will be caught totally off-guard. Speaking of powerful moves, replacing Scald with Surf is not a bad idea if you are worried about burn overlapping with Toxic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While rain is a great boon to Tentacruel, it is also ironically its downfall. With rain, Manaphy can laugh off Tentacruel's attempt to poison or burn it with Hydration and pound it with Energy Ball until it faints. Thundurus and Zapdos are two other terrors brought by the rain. These two are immune to Toxic Spikes and can quickly fry Tentacruel with Thunder. Toxicroak is a rare rain sweeper, but it is a great Tentacruel check because it is immune to Toxic Spikes and Scald. However, Toxicroak cannot do a lot of damage to Tentacruel unless it sets up. Vaporeon is another monster from the deep that can check Tentacruel, as it also has Hydration to remove status in the rain.</p> <p>Removing the rain also makes Tentacruel easier to take down. Tyranitar, for example, can neutralize Leftovers recovery with sandstorm and easily pummel Tentacruel with Earthquake or Stone Edge. Speaking of Earthquake, it is the deadliest move to use against Tentacruel; Pokemon such as Garchomp and Excadrill easily outspeed the jellyfish and can use Earthquake to destroy it. Grass- and Dragon-types have little trouble with any Tentacruel that does not carry Ice Beam. Even if it does, though, remember that Tentacruel has a shabby base Special Attack, so any Pokemon with decent special bulk, such as Venusaur, Latios, and Dragonite, can shrug off its attacks. As a bonus, Venusaur can even remove Toxic Spikes. If all else fails, try using a powerful physical attacker to take down Tentacruel. With a pitiful base HP and Defense, it will not last long.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<p>Tentacruel can perform a wide variety of functions; this set prioritizes setting up Toxic Spikes and removing entry hazards from your side of the field. Toxic Spikes keeps many walls that would otherwise quickly set up on it at bay. As it is a grounded Poison-type, Tentacruel can also remove Toxic Spikes from your side of the field. For other entry hazards, it can use Rapid Spin. Scald is listed in the third moveslot due to its nifty burn rate, which helps remedy Tentacruel's pitiful Defense. In the last moveslot, Ice Beam is useful for nailing Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon that would otherwise laugh at Scald and proceed to set up. However, with Tentacruel's average base Special Attack, Pokemon such as Latios and Latias can shrug off Ice Beam, which makes Protect an alternative choice. Protect is also great at scouting the foe's set, and it allows Tentacruel to recover health without worry.</p> <p>Tentacruel is pretty damn fast for a defensive Pokemon, which is why 16 EVs are invested in Speed. These EVs allow the jellyfish to outspeed Adamant Breloom, which can be rather annoying due to Spore. Tentacruel's Defense stat is also a bit lacking, which is why the rest of the EVs go to it and HP. An alternative EV spread would be 252 HP / 240 SpD / 16 Spe with a Calm nature. The trade-off is that Tentacruel can wall special attacks better while becoming more vulnerable to physical ones. Another interesting spread is 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spe, which allows Tentacruel to outspeed Adamant Dragonite and Mamoswine, Modest Chandelure, and other neutral-natured Pokemon with base 80 Speed. If you use this spread, you can also replace Scald with Surf, which will OHKO the latter two under the rain (Spikes or Stealth Rock is required to get an OHKO with Scald). As for abilities, Rain Dish should be your primary choice if you use Tentacruel on a rain team, which you probably should anyway; Rain Dish also allows Tentacruel to check opposing rain teams.</p> <p>Speaking of rain, Politoed is a must-have teammate. Unfortunately, these Pokemon share a common weakness to Electric-type attacks, which is why Pokemon such as Zapdos and Raikou help tremendously. SubRoost Zapdos and SubCM Raikou are amazing sets to use with Tentacruel; Zapdos can chill out behind a Substitute as the foe succumbs to Toxic damage, and Raikou appreciates having Chansey and Blissey destroyed by Toxic Spikes. These two Pokemon also benefit greatly from the rain, so not having them on your team should be a felony. Other good teammates are Grass-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn; not only can Ferrothron sponge physical attacks aimed at Tentacruel, it can also lay down Spikes. Setup sweepers also work nicely with Tentacruel. Manaphy and Serperior, for example, enjoy Toxic Spikes support and Tentacruel's bulk. Serperior can also shred enemy Manaphy to pieces with Leaf Storm, provided that the water pixie did not set up with Calm Mind. Finally, you might want to consider having spinblockers; after all, nothing is more frustrating than having your Toxic Spikes spun away over and over again. Jellicent is one of the best defensive spinblockers in the DW metagame; however, your team can have some serious problems with Electric-type attacks if you decide to use it on a rain team, so you might want to use another Pokemon, such as Dusclops or even Gengar.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Tentacruel's greatest problems are Jellicient and Ferrothorn; these two Pokemon take little or no damage from its attacks, and the latter is immune to Toxic Spikes. However, by using a clever combination of Substitute and Toxic, Tentacruel can easily defeat them and other would-be counters, such as Togekiss. Substitute blocks Ferrothorn's Leech Seed, Jellicent's Will-O-Wisp, and other status moves. The loss of HP will not bother Tentacruel because, with Leftovers and Rain Dish, it can regain the lost health in two turns under the rain. Meanwhile, as its counters try in vain to cripple it, Tentacruel can dish out some deliciously ironic revenge by crippling them with either Toxic or Scald. As a huge bonus, Toxic can also hit any Pokemon that has a Flying typing or the Levitate ability, such as Togekiss, Dragonite, and Rotom-W. The last moveslot is a toss-up between Rapid Spin and Toxic Spikes. Rapid Spin is an important move because entry hazards are ridiculously prevalent in DW. Toxic Spikes, though, is greatly appreciated by rain stall teams.</p> <p>The 108 EVs in Speed allow Tentacruel to outspeed Jolly Breloom and quickly create a Substitute before it can use Spore. The rest of the EVs are placed in HP and Defense to buff up Tentacruel defensively, although feel free to move some EVs to Special Defense. Rain Dish is the preferred ability here, as it helps Tentacruel regain health faster. If your team has problems with Conkeldurr, Venusaur, or Ferrothorn, then you can opt to use Liquid Ooze. Remember, though, that without the extra HP recovery from Rain Dish, Tentacruel will have a tough time against foes. Tentacruel can run Protect in the fourth moveslot to prolong Toxic damage, as well as scout the foe and recover health.</p> <p>Politoed is a given partner, as it is vital that rain stays in play for as long as possible. However, Tyranitar can easily waltz in and change the weather, which will seriously hamper Tentacruel. Politoed can actually defeat Tyranitar with a Choice Specs Focus Blast; otherwise, you should have Pokemon such as Scizor, Breloom, or Dugtrio that can check it. Two other counters that this set cannot beat are Vaporeon and Manaphy, as both of them can use Hydration to purge themselves of Toxic and burn. Vaporeon is stopped cold by Ferrothorn and is easily obliterated by Zapdos, Thundurus, and Rotom-W. These four Pokemon also have excellent synergy with Tentacruel and, in addition, benefit immensely from the rain. Manaphy is a lot tougher to take down; the best you can do is to send in a powerful Pokemon that can obliterate it with a super effective move before it sets up with Calm Mind.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>There is more to this shady clam than what meets the eye. Cloyster's stat spread might scream \"physical wall,\" but that's hardly the case, for it gets access to arguably the best boosting move in the game: Shell Smash. After just a turn of setup, Cloyster turns into a wrecking ball that can mow through entire teams with ease. With Skill Link, Cloyster possesses a powerful STAB Icicle Spear, which has an enormous 187 BP after STAB, as well as a great coverage move in Rock Blast; this ensures that even Substitute users cannot stop Cloyster's rampage. A massive base 180 Defense makes Cloyster all the more difficult to revenge kill, as it can comfortably survive powerful priority moves such as Mach Punch from the likes of Breloom and Conkeldurr even after a Shell Smash. Unfortunately, Cloyster's horrendous Special Defense means it simply can't take a special attack to save its life, and a weakness to Stealth Rock makes switching in even more difficult. It also finds it difficult to get past bulky Water-types such as Jellicent, which can take Cloyster's boosted attacks with ease and burn it, rendering it useless. Underestimating Cloyster on the basis of these shortcomings will be suicidal, though; it can run through your team like a hot knife through butter.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Shard can be used on the Shell Smash set to beat priority users such as Breloom to the punch; it also deals heavy damage to the few threats which outspeed Cloyster, such as Choice Scarf Latios. Toxic is an option on the utility set to cripple bulky Water-types such as Jellicent. Spike Cannon could be used to give Cloyster Water / Normal coverage, but Rock Blast provides better coverage overall. King's Rock, while it appears gimmicky, actually gives Icicle Spear and Rock Blast a 41% flinch chance, meaning Cloyster can get past bulky checks such as Jellicent with a lucky flinch.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Few threats outspeed Cloyster after a Shell Smash, meaning priority is one of the best answers to it. If Cloyster takes Stealth Rock damage, Breloom and Conkeldurr can OHKO it with Mach Punch, and Choice Band Scizor can 2HKO with Bullet Punch while surviving a boosted Hydro Pump at full health. Having Stealth Rock on the field is thus a basic step to keeping Cloyster in check. Alternatively, Vacuum Wave users such as Infernape and Lucario make great checks to Cloyster as they target its weak Special Defense. A fast Choice Scarf user such as Latios can outspeed Cloyster even after a Shell Smash and OHKO it. Imposter Ditto in particular can switch in after Cloyster sets up and use the Shell Smash boosts to its advantage, pulling off a sweep of its own.</p> <p>There also exist several Pokemon which can sponge Cloyster's boosted attacks and OHKO in reuturn. Jellicent is only 2HKOed by a boosted Rock Blast and can cripple Cloyster with Will-O-Wisp. In the same vein, Vaporeon and Slowbro don't take much damage from a boosted Rock Blast and can KO back with the appropriate move. Jirachi is barely 2HKOed by a boosted Icicle Spear, and can paralyze Cloyster or OHKO with Thunderbolt. Ferrothorn can take a boosted Icicle Spear from sets lacking Life Orb or Icicle Plate, and can deal heavy damage with Power Whip or cripple Cloyster with Thunder Wave. Skarmory, while it can't do much damage with Brave Bird, can Whirlwind Cloyster out and end its sweep. Lastly, Unaware Quagsire ignores Cloyster's Shell Smash boosts and can set up with Curse, taking out Cloyster after a few Curse boosts while healing off any damage taken with Recover; however, it needs to be careful while switching in as Icicle Spear can 2HKO with a high damage roll.</p> ",

With its immense physical bulk, Cloyster can easily set up a Shell Smash on physical attackers such as Dugtrio, doubling its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed in one fell swoop; after a Shell Smash, Cloyster will sit at a frightening 578 Attack, 412 Special Attack, and 524 Speed with the given EV spread. It can then go to town with its powerful STAB Icicle Spear, which has an enormous 187 Base Power with STAB and Skill Link. Additionally, this ensures that Cloyster will be able to KO most threats through Substitute and Multiscale. Rock Blast is Cloyster's main coverage option, dealing heavy damage to the Fire- and Water-types that resist Icicle Spear.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is the preferred option in the last moveslot, as it destroys bulky Steel-types such as Skarmory, Scizor, and Forretress looking to soak up a boosted Icicle Spear. However, Razor Shell can be used to OHKO Tyranitar and Heatran, which can survive a boosted Hydro Pump with a specially defensive EV spread and OHKO in return. The choice between the two depends on the support which Cloyster's teammates can provide: if these two latter Pokemon are handled easily by your team, then running Hydro Pump is better.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Cloyster's Attack and Speed, with a Speed-boosting nature used to ensure that Cloyster outspeeds common Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion after a Shell Smash. A Naive nature is used if you use Hydro Pump in the last moveslot so as not to lower Cloyster's great Defense stat; Jolly is the way to go with Razor Shell. White Herb is the preferred item option on this set, as it ensures that powerful priority users such as Breloom and Dragonite won't bring a premature end to Cloyster's sweep. You can run Life Orb to ensure the OHKO on Ferrothorn with Icicle Spear after a boost, but Cloyster will easily be revenge killed with a Defense drop and Life Orb recoil, so White Herb is almost always the better option. However, Cloyster has some other item options. Focus Sash can be used to guarantee Cloyster's setup, but the prevalence of priority and sandstorm makes this a poor choice. Lastly, Icicle Plate can be used to maintain the OHKO on Ferrothorn without Life Orb recoil.</p> <p>Cloyster is best used on offensive rain teams, as it can destroy opposing weather starters such as Tyranitar and Ninetales with the appropriate move after a Shell Smash while having its STAB Hydro Pump boosted to massive levels by the rain. Alternatively, you can also run Cloyster on a sun team; in this case, Hidden Power Fire should replace Cloyster's Water-type STAB to deal heavy damage to Steel-types such as Skarmory and Forretress.</p> <p>Cloyster doesn't need much in the way of team support for pulling off a sweep, as few threats can stand up to the might of its boosted attacks. However, entry hazard support can come in handy, as Cloyster will always OHKO physically defensive Politoed with Rock Blast after Stealth Rock. Forretress and Ferrothorn are good options; the former can also provide valuable Rapid Spin support, making it a particularly effective partner. While not strictly necessary, dual screens also make it much easier for Cloyster to set up. Espeon thus makes an excellent teammate, as it can set up dual screens easily thanks to its high Speed while also stopping entry hazards from being set up with Magic Bounce. Lastly, Choice Scarf Chandelure is also a great partner for Cloyster on non-rain teams as it can trap and eliminate Steel-types such as Jirachi that act as a roadblock to Cloyster's sweep; alternatively, it can even run Choice Specs with a Modest nature to OHKO Jellicent.</p> "

This set works best as a bulky attacker on offensive teams needing a solid answer to the aforementioned threats, but it fits equally well on stall teams which can provide Cloyster with the support to take powerful special attacks. Cloyster can also set up entry hazards and provide Rapid Spin support to its teammates; its function is thus similar to that of Forretress, the difference being its greater offensive presence.</p> <p>Icicle Spear allows Cloyster to act as a solid check to Dragon-types such as Dragonite; it also ensures that Substitute users such as Gliscor and Mienshao will not be able to set up on it.

Hydro Pump is the preferred option for the fourth moveslot, providing coverage on the Fire- and Steel-types which resist Icicle Spear; it OHKOes Excadrill and Chandelure and deals heavy damage to physical tanks such as Skarmory.</p> <p>The following damage calculations highlight how Cloyster can soak up powerful physical attacks from some of the top threats in the metagame with its excellent physical bulk:</p> <ul> <li>+1 Adamant Dragonite Outrage: 52.8-62.7% <li>+2 Adamant Life Orb Excadrill Earthquake: 77.22 - 91.08%</li> <li>+2 Jolly Life Orb Garchomp Outrage: 82.17 - 97.02%</li> <li>Adamant Life Orb Breloom Mach Punch: 69.7 - 82.98%</li> <li>Adamant Choice Band Scizor Superpower: 69.96 - 82.5%</li> <li>Ferrothorn Power Whip: 39.6 - 47.52%</li> </ul> <p>The EV spread is somewhat complex. First, 84 EVs are invested in Attack so that Cloyster obtains the OHKO on Gengar switch-ins with Icicle Spear; this also ensures a 3HKO on standard Ferrothorn. 248 EVs are invested in HP to ensure that Cloyster can switch into Stealth Rock 4 times without fainting, and the remaining EVs are dumped into Defense to provide optimum physical bulk. A Relaxed nature is used to further bolster Cloyster's Defense, and the Speed drop will not hinder it much since most offensive threats are faster anyway. Leftovers is the preferred item option to heal off entry hazard damage, though if you feel Chandelure poses a major threat, you can always run Shed Shell. If you feel Spikes will not be particularly useful, then Rock Blast is an option in the third moveslot to deal heavy damage to threats such as Gyarados. Hidden Power Fire is also usable on sun teams, as it deals heavy damage to Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor.</p> <p>It is important to understand the fact that Cloyster does not function as a physical wall. Instead, its aim is to counter specific physical attackers that threaten its teammates, setting up entry hazards and Rapid Spinning when it gets a free turn or two. Cloyster simply cannot take powerful special attacks, so pairing it with a specially bulky Pokemon is a great idea. Latias is a great option, as it has excellent defensive synergy with Cloyster and can also provide Wish support. Blissey, while it compounds Cloyster's Fighting-type weakness, passes larger Wishes and sponges special attacks much more easily with its colossal HP and Special Defense. Packing a spinblocker will also be of help; Jellicent and Gengar are both good options.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Ever since GSC, Chansey has been outclassed by its evolution, Blissey. Things have changed in BW, however; with an Eviolite equipped, Chansey is actually much bulkier than its evolution, with its defensive stats rise to monstrous levels. Unlike Blissey, Chansey can take non-super effective physical hits with relative ease, something Blissey can not boast to do. Unfortunately, it's not all good news for Chansey. Although Eviolite boosts Chansey's defenses, its Defense stat is still rather low. Finally, Chansey falls to every commonly seen Fighting-type in the DW tier, most notably Breloom and Conkeldurr. Without Toxic Spikes support, Substiute + Calm Mind Chandelure can easily set up all over Chansey and proceed to destroy the blob and its teammates. Don't let these weaknesses deter you from using Chansey, though, as it can prove to be an excellent member of your team.</p> ",

It has access to Aromatherapy and Heal Bell, which are useful for stall teams who want to avoid status, or sweepers who are afraid of paralysis. Chansey also has access to a number of special moves such as Flamethrower, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt. However, it's generally better to use Blissey if you want to use a special attack, because it has a higher Special Attack stat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Anything with a STAB Fighting-type attack will destroy Chansey; Pokemon such as Terrakion, Breloom, Conkeldurr, and any other Fighting-type easily defeat it. Keldeo is one of the only special attackers that can beat Chansey, because its signature move, Secret Sword, targets Chansey's pitiful Defense stat. Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure can set up all over Chansey, as Chandelure can use Substitute as Chansey uses Toxic or Thunder Wave, and proceed to get to +6 Special Attack and Special Defense while Chansey wastes its PP. Other Substitute + Calm Mind users with 101 HP Substitute, such as Jirachi, also make for great checks to Chansey, as it will take two Seismic Tosses to break the Substitute. Toxic Spikes is one of the best checks to Chansey, as it prevents Chansey from staying on the battle field for too long. Trick and Knock Off users are a pain for it as well, as Chansey is reliant on Eviolite to maintain their bulk.</p> ",

Wish allows Chansey to keep themself healthy, while being able to fully heal the HP of most of its teammates, due to Chansey's high HP stat. Protect is useful for scouting for Trick, Fighting-type STAB moves, and guaranteeing that you regain HP with Wish. Alternatively, Soft-Boiled can be used to make Chansey regain health immediately, instead of waiting a turn; Chansey should run Soft-Boiled if you want to make ensure that Chansey's primary goal is to wall threats and its secondary objective is to heal teammates. Toxic allows Chansey to stall out many Pokemon, and is Chansey's main way of taking down Pokemon. Seismic Toss prevents Chansey from being completely neutralized by Taunt, and lets Chansey have a consistent way of dealing damage.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Chansey's HP stat and Chansey's Defense stat; with Eviolite, Chansey becomes bulky enough to take some neutral STAB physical attacks. An alternative EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD can be used, and is quite viable. However, the one problem with this EV spread is that you will not be giving your teammates more HP with Wish, but if your team isn't too reliant on Wish passing, this spread works excellently. Chansey makes for an excellent Stealth Rock user, as it can easily set them up with their excellent bulk in conjunction with Eviolite. Rain support can prove to be excellent for Chansey, as it gives them a chance to PP stall Chandelure with Fire Blast. Since Chansey has a decent Defense stat in conjunction with Eviolite, a Counter set is viable as it can surprise physical attackers attempting to 2HKO Chansey. Thunder Wave can be run on Chansey for hitting things such as Genesect who may switch in expecting Toxic.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes support is Chansey's best bet when dealing with Chandelure. It takes numerous turns for Chandelure to be able to break through Chansey's Special Defense, and Toxic Spikes punishes every turn that Chandelure stays in. Physical walls such as Gliscor and Skarmory can take physical hits for Chansey, while the blob takes all special hits aimed at the aforementioned Pokemon.</p> "

  "Starmie": {
    "overview": "<p>Starmie's role hasn't altered much in the transition to BW. In fact, it is largely the same. Starmie's stat spread may not seem to be the best, nor the most powerful, but its incredible coverage and access to excellent support options are not to be overlooked. Starmie is one of the best offensive spinners out there, competing with Excadrill for that title, and can fulfill many roles on a team. Starmie's access to Natural Cure makes it a great status absorber and can be used with Recover to highly increase its longevity. In addition, Starmie's excellent typing resists both of Keldeo's STAB moves and its Speed lets it outrun many dangerous threats such as Thundurus, Terrakion, and Gengar. This, combined with a Life Orb, gives Starmie great sweeping capabilities to augment its support capabilities.</p> <p>Not all is well for Starmie in the Dream World metagame though. Threats like Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Chansey all wall Starmie and Ghosts, such as Gengar and Jellicent, can spinblock against non-Life Orb variants. To further complicate matters, Starmie's weaknesses to common Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Chandelure, Choice Scarf Genesect, and Latias enable those Pokemon to threaten it with a sweep. Starmie's weaknesses do not help either, as U-turn, Pursuit, and Volt Switch are all common moves. Even though Starmie faces many challenges, it can be used to great effect on a team to serve multiple roles.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>In addition to the aforementioned sets, Starmie can also run an effective dual screens set. Although this may appear effective thanks to Starmie's blistering Speed, its lackluster bulk makes it undesirable for such a role. A set utilizing Gravity can be used with Blizzard, Hydro Pump, and Thunder, each of which gain perfect accuracy while the condition is in effect. The main problem with this, though, is its lack of general utility outside of setting up Gravity. Shed Shell is viable on any Starmie set in order to escape Choice Scarf Chandelure, but the HP recovery or power boost granted by other items will be sorely missed. Hidden Power Fire is a good move on any set if Starmie is used on a sun team, as it roasts many common counters such as Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Although Starmie possesses amazing tools that are available to few other Pokemon, its list of checks and counters is long. VoltTurn teams tend to rip Starmie apart; as Starmie is weak to both moves and only hits Rotom-W for neutral damage, it is a lot less useful in matches against these teams. Starmie also has a rough time against sun teams, as they reduce the power of Starmie's main attack greatly. In addition, Chlorophyll sweepers such as Venusaur and Victreebel can come in on Starmie and threaten it out with their Grass-type STAB moves.</p> <p>In addition to certain playstyles, several Pokemon wall Starmie. Gastrodon, although rare, is immune to both Hydro Pump and Thunderbolt and takes very little from Ice Beam. Ferrothorn resists both of Starmie's STAB attacks and Thunderbolt, and takes little damage from Ice Beam. Ferrothorn can also retaliate with a super effective STAB Power Whip. Choice Scarf Chandelure is able to trap Starmie and hit it with a super effective STAB Shadow Ball, which effectively eliminates it from the game. Chandelure must be careful not to switch into a Hydro Pump, though. Both Chansey and Blissey take little damage from any move in Starmie's arsenal, bar Psyshock. They can spam Starmie with repeated Seismic Tosses in return to wear down the Life Orb set. Rotom-W can severely dent, if not OHKO, Starmie with its STAB Electric-type attacks, such as Volt Switch, Thunderbolt, and Thunder. The most Starmie can do to Rotom-W is use Thunderbolt, and this will never OHKO Rotom-W. Jellicent and Dusclops can stop Starmie's spinning attempts, but Dusclops must be wary of a strong Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump and Jellicent cannot take too many Thunderbolts in a row. Choice Scarf Genesect also gives Starmie problems, as a super effective STAB Bug Buzz or U-turn will always OHKO Starmie, regardless of which stat Download boosts. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is also an excellent check to Starmie, being able to come in after a KO and trap it with Pursuit or KO it with Crunch. Lastly, faster threats that can OHKO Starmie, such as Weavile, can come in and easily OHKO Starmie with super effective moves, although they must beware of switching into one of Starmie's more powerful attacks.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This set's main goal is to attack and score revenge kills, then use Rapid Spin or Recover when necessary. One might think Starmie cannot pull this off effectively due to its average base 100 Special Attack stat, but what makes this so effective is its Speed. Starmie can easily outspeed other Pokemon such as Thundurus and Garchomp and KO them with its coverage moves.</p> <p>The set's main STAB move should be either Hydro Pump or Surf. This choice brings back the old accuracy-for-power debate, and it is a purely preferential decision upon what to use. Both choices provide a consistent, powerful move to help Starmie blast through walls. However, it should be noted that a Life Orb-boosted Surf cannot OHKO Gengar without Stealth Rock, so choose Hydro Pump if Gengar is especially problematic for your team. The next two moves on the set are essential as they provide the crucial coverage that makes Starmie so effective. Ice Beam is extremely useful for taking out Dragon-types such as Salamence, Dragonite, and Garchomp, and also hits Thundurus and Breloom quite hard. Thunderbolt completes the infamous, near unresisted BoltBeam combo that nets KOs on Pokemon such as Gyarados and provides coverage against Water-types, such as Jellicent and Keldeo. The final move is up to you as both are useful. Rapid Spin should be used if you can't fit it in another teammate's moveset, but will severely shorten Starmie's lifespan as it won't be able to heal residual damage. Recover is recommended if your team already has a Rapid Spin user, as it will greatly help Starmie in the long run.</p> <p>This set's EVs are quite straightforward. Max Speed and Special Attack allow Starmie to hit as hard and fast as possible, and the extra four EVs are put in Special Defense to minimize Stealth Rock damage and prevent Download users from getting a Special Attack boost. Natural Cure is the ability of choice because it makes Starmie a great switch-in to status inducing moves, and its other abilities are practically useless. If you feel the extra coverage provided by Thunderbolt and Ice Beam are unnecessary, Starmie has a few other viable moves to replace its coverage options. Psyshock provides Starmie with a strong secondary STAB, and hits specially defensive walls, such as Chansey, harder. Hidden Power Fire is for breaking through Ferrothorn but will always fail to OHKO, so it is a bit lackluster. The problem with replacing a move on Starmie's set is that it must give up either a helpful supporting move or a coverage move. As both of these are very valuable, it is best to drop a move that helps against a Pokemon that your team already covers. Another change that can be made is the item. While Life Orb provides a great power boost, Leftovers can be used to increase Starmie's longevity and to allow it to spam Rapid Spin, but the power drop will be severe. Expert Belt can also be used to bluff a choice set and power up Starmie's moves without recoil. To prevent a Choice Scarf Chandelure coming in and ruining Starmie's day, a Shed Shell is viable.</p> <p>As this particular Starmie set focuses on attacking, it may have trouble breaking down walls with unboosted, non-STAB attacks. For this reason, a mixed Salamence set makes an excellent partner as it is able to break through walls easily. Starmie also helps Salamence--it resists its Ice-type weakness and can spin Stealth Rock away to enable it to switch in for free. Another excellent teammate is Technician Breloom. Blissey, Chansey, and Ferrothorn all stop Starmie in its tracks, but Breloom's strong Fighting-type attacks will easily break down such walls. Breloom's Mach Punch also helps against threats that can outspeed Starmie, such as Excadrill in sand or certain Choice Scarf users. This set also works extremely well with rain support from Politoed. The rain not only powers up Starmie's already dangerous STAB Hydro Pump, but enables it to use the vicious Thunder as a coverage move. Other good teammates include Pokemon that can take U-turns and Volt Switches, such as Gastrodon, Terrakion, and Magnezone. When using this set one must be wary of Pokemon that can take an unboosted move from Starmie, such as Latios and Latias. Even though it is weak to Thunderbolt, specially defensive Jellicent can also take repeated attacks from Starmie and retaliate with a STAB Shadow Ball.</p> "

        "name": "Rapid Spin",
        "description": "<p>This set attempts to use both Rapid Spin and Recover to become a reliable spinner, while still maintaining an offensive presence. Rapid Spin clears entry hazards for sweepers such as Volcarona, Chandelure, Thundurus, and Dragonite, and enables a sweep with greater ease. Starmie uses Recover in combination with Rapid Spin to allow it to spin many times throughout a match. This Starmie tends to use Surf or Scald instead of Hydro Pump because of its more defensive nature. Scald gives Starmie a good STAB move as well as a chance to cripple a physically inclined sweeper with a burn for the rest of a match. The final moveslot is dedicated to a coverage move for Starmie to cripple certain threats with. Thunderbolt is preferred due to the greater neutral coverage it provides, but Thunder Wave is also a good option for spreading status. Leftovers is the item of choice on this set because the set focuses mainly on Starmie's supporting abilities, rather than its power. Shed Shell is also a useful item solely for escaping from Chandelure, a threat to Starmie, no matter what set it runs. Natural Cure is a great ability for Starmie, not only because it lacks viable alternatives, but because it lets Starmie heal itself from crippling status conditions, such as poison or paralysis.</p> <p>Maximizing Starmie's HP stat lets it take hits much better, but still retains its high Speed. This set has the ability to use several other supporting options in place of the final coverage move. Hidden Power Fire, Psychic, and Psyshock are all viable moves thanks to the coverage they provide. In addition to these moves Starmie can use Toxic and weather moves to aid its team. Toxic, in addition to Recover, can stall out walls that would normally give Starmie trouble, such as Chansey and Blissey. Weather inducing moves are an excellent defense to weather abusing teams. Starmie can utilize either Rain Dance or Hail to induce a different weather and potentially ruin an opponent's weather-based strategy.</p> <p>Great teammates for this set are one's that can truly take advantage of Starmie's spinning abilities. Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes are all great partners that love the team support that Starmie provides. Defensively, Starmie enjoys Pokemon that can handle its weaknesses to Volt Switch and U-turn, such as Landorus, Thundurus, and other Pokemon bulky enough to take the hit such as Ferrothorn. This set also makes for a wonderful Keldeo check because it can endure repeated blows from its dual STABs. Starmie can also hit back with either Psychic or Thunder Wave, thus crippling Keldeo for the match. Unfortunately, this Starmie set also has its problems. Bulky spinblockers, such as Jellicent and Dusclops, can take advantage of Starmie's low damage output and constantly block Starmie's Rapid Spin. Also, due to its lower power, Pokemon such as Gengar and Tyranitar can take a hit and retaliate with their powerful super effective STAB moves.</p> "

        "name": "Choice",
        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice item, Starmie becomes either a great revenge killer or a powerful attacker. Choice Scarf is a great item for Starmie thanks to its rare and high Speed tier, which enables it to outspeed crucial threats such as Scarf Terrakion, Scarf Garchomp, +1 Dragonite, Deoxys-S, Modest Venusaur in sun, and +1 Salamence. On the other hand, Choice Specs gives Starmie a huge boost in power, as not much can stand up to a rain-boosted Choice Specs Hydro Pump. Hydro Pump is the move of choice for both items because of its sheer power, which compensates for the Choice Scarf set's average Special Attack and ensures maximum power for the Choice Specs set. Surf can be used as it is more reliable, but it is significantly less powerful. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt are special attacking staples, and give great coverage alongside Starmie's STAB Water-type attacks. Trick can be used for getting rid of one's own Choice item while messing with the opponent's walls, although there are other options that can be used in place of it. Hidden Power Fire is a viable choice for the Choice Specs set as it has a chance to OHKO Ferrothorn with entry hazards support. Rapid Spin can be used with Choice Scarf for a quick removal of hazards, which allows Pokemon like Dragonite and Volcarona to set up.</p> <p>The EVs on this set maximize Starmie's offensive presence and take advantage of its unique speed tier. Taking any EVs away from either offensive stat is not recommended, but the last 4 EVs can be used at one's leisure to determine which of Genesect's stats becomes boosted should it switch in. Psychic and Psyshock both have their merits as a secondary STAB; each hits different threats to Starmie, although Psyshock is noted for its ability to 2HKO Blissey with hazard support and ability to hit Keldeo much harder. Thunder or Blizzard can be used over Thunderbolt or Ice Beam, respectively, with the appropriate weather support. The best possible teammates for this set are ones that can take Volt Switches and U-turns, both of which it is extremely vulnerable to. Pokemon that synergize well with Starmie include Gastrodon, Garchomp, Dragonite, and any other Pokemon that are bulky enough to take the appropriate switching move. Another good choice is Magnezone; it resists both Volt Switch and U-turn and can trap Ferrothorn, a primary wall to Starmie.</p> "

These issues compounded problems Gyarados already faced, such as its Stealth Rock weakness, preventing it from being a top offensive contender in the DW metagame. This does not mean Gyarados, who had always been a fine sweeper in the OU metagame, is a bad Pokemon by any means. However, with new threats emerging in the DW tier such as Chandelure, Keldeo, and Technician Breloom, Gyarados's excellent defensive typing and stats will be tested like never before. Gyarados's offensive capabilities should never be overlooked though.

Gyarados can function as a wallbreaker when equipped with a Choice Band, but is easily forced out without a way to boost its Speed, meaning its Stealth Rock weakness can really hurt it. Finally, Gyarados can utilize Wacan Berry to survive an Electric-type attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gyarados runs into a lot of trouble against Rotom-W as it can switch into both of Gyarados's STAB attacks and threaten a 4x super effective Volt Switch.

Ferrothorn in particular does a great job at stopping Gyarados, as it takes neutral damage from Bounce. Moreover, Ferrothorn doesn't mind being paralyzed by Bounce, and can paralyze Gyarados in return, while Earthquake is Gyarados's only neutral attack against Ferrothorn that doesn't cause Iron Barbs recoil. Skarmory and physically defensive Cloyster wall Gyarados excellently thanks to their immense Defense stats. Skarmory can even take hits from a +2 Gyarados and phaze it out, while Cloyster effectively checks even Substitute Gyarados thanks to Rock Blast and its resistance to Water-type attacks.

        "description": "<p>This set aims to obtain multiple Dragon Dances behind a Substitute to attempt a sweep. Substitute is incredibly useful on Gyarados, as it grants Gyarados protection from status, Taunt, Volt Switches from Pokemon such as Rotom-W, revenge killers such as Terrakion and Landorus, and priority moves, in addition to the ability to set up on bulky Water-types without worrying about Scald burns. Substitute also provides protection while Gyarados is airborne after using Bounce, allowing it to rack up even more Leftovers recovery, which somewhat compensates for its weakness to Stealth Rock. Waterfall serves as powerful, reliable STAB, and its flinch rate coupled with Bounce's paralysis rate form a paraflinch combination. All of this means there are very few Pokemon in DW who can handle this set one-on-one.</p> <p>The EVs for this set enable Gyarados to outspeed all base 115s such as Starmie after one Dragon Dance, and also prevent a burned Ferrothorn from breaking its Substitutes with an uninvested Power Whip. However, note that both Bounce and Waterfall make Gyarados take damage from Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, so Gyarados should look to obtain as many boosts as possible to minimize Iron Barbs damage.

Moxie allows Gyarados to quickly become more of a threat offensively, while Intimidate gives Gyarados more opportunities to switch in or set up.</p> <p>Politoed makes an excellent partner to Gyarados as it makes Gyarados more of an offensive threat initially, while also eliminating residual damage from sand or hail. Gyarados could make use of Rapid Spin support for more switch-in opportunities: Starmie makes a good Rapin Spin user for this set as it can break down physical walls such as Skarmory, Cloyster, and Quagsire. Gyarados loves paralysis support when behind a Substitute; this can be provided by Ferrothorn and Jirachi. The former is also able to lay hazards, while the latter can supply Gyarados with Wishes.

While Gyarados's defensive stats aren't the best in DW, it has tools that make it an excellent defensive Pokemon. Thunder Wave is useful for stopping setup sweepers, and it works great in tandem with Waterfall's flinch rate, making it tough for the opponent to even land a hit. When Gyarados isn't crippling foes with Thunder Wave, it can phaze them out, which is bolstered by the switches Gyarados tends to generate due to its offensive potential. Dragon Tail is the main choice of phazing move as it isn't affected by Taunt, and with Gyarados's naturally high Attack stat, few sweepers will be able to keep their Substitute up against it. Roar is an option for its reliable accuracy, and is a significantly better option against Substitute + Bulk Up users such as Toxicroak, as well as Substitute Jirachi. Taunt rounds out the set, prevent phazing attempts, status, or attempts at setting up hazards. Even uninvested, Gyarados's base 80 Speed lets it outrun a large portion of the utility Pokemon in DW, allowing it to shut them down with Taunt.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Gyarados's ability to take physical hits, while 248 HP EVs allow for five switches into Stealth Rock as opposed to four. The presence of Stealth Rock greatly hampers Gyarados's ability to switch into attacks, so Forretress can be used a Rapid Spin partner; it can also provide hazards to wear opponents down after Gyarados phazes them out. Ferrothorn is an excellent partner to Gyarados as it can provide hazards as well and heal Gyarados through Leech Seed. Furthermore, Ferrothorn can check one of Gyarados's greatest nemeses: Rotom-W. Jirachi forms an incredibly tough defensive core alongside Gyarados as the two share great type synergy. Jirachi can also provide Gyarados with Wish support, and as Jirachi is capable of spreading paralysis, Gyarados can forgo Thunder Wave for another move, such as Protect, which is useful for scouting VoltTurn cores and more recovery. Rest is another option over Thunder Wave. In this case, a cleric such as Blissey or Chansey could prove useful. Thanks to its Drizzle ability, Politoed is a very useful partner, as in addition to boosting Gyarados's Water STAB, it eliminates residual damage caused by hail or sandstorm.</p> "

Waterfall is Gyarados's main weapon and hits extremely hard after a Dragon Dance, thanks to boosts from Life Orb and possibly rain. Waterfall's flinch rate make it even more of a threat; it allows Gyarados to possibly break down bulkier Pokemon such as Skarmory. Stone Edge provides excellent neutral coverage alongside Waterfall, hitting Pokemon such as Dragonite, Serperior, and Celebi. One can opt for Bounce for strong secondary STAB, but it as not as safe of an option on this set; Gyarados lacks protection from Substitute, so it is susceptible to attacks when landing. Earthquake is Gyarados's best option against Empoleon and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Adamant is preferred for generally more power, but a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed positive-natured base 130s, such as Jolteon and Aerodactyl, after a Dragon Dance. Moxie is the preferred ability as it makes Gyarados an extremely dangerous late-game cleaner; if the opponent sacrifices a Pokemon, Gyarados will become even more threatening. However, Intimidate can be used to ease switching in. Life Orb grants more power, but Lum Berry is an option to shield Gyarados from status, making it easier to set up. Additionally, the Life Orb boost isn't even always necessary if Gyarados can rack up Moxie boosts. Ice Fang can be used over Stone Edge or Bounce to deal with Grass-types while maintaining coverage against Flying- and Dragon-types, but it sometimes doesn't hit hard enough. Taunt can be used over Earthquake to prevent phazing attempts from Pokemon such as Skarmory, status, or opposing Taunts, but this leaves Gyarados walled by Ferrothorn, a prominent defensive threat in the metagame.</p> <p>This set doesn't typically switch around a lot as it is best used as a late-game sweeper, but Rapid Spin support is useful to extend a sweep. Forretress is a good candidate for Rapid Spinning, as it can also lay hazards, which makes Gyarados incredibly hard to switch into. As this set runs into trouble against bulky Water-types, such as Slowbro, Alomomola, and Cloyster, a strong special sweeper, such as Thundurus, can be used as an offensive partner, eliminating each other's checks. Gyarados and Thundurus are furthermore both excellent rain sweepers. If Gyarados is using Life Orb, then status, such as burn and paralysis, will really hamper its ability to sweep. Therefore, a cleric would prove useful. Jolteon can be used as an offensive cleric while also playing a similar role to Thundurus in eliminating Gyarados's checks.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Thanks to Moxie, Gyarados makes a terrific Choice Scarf user. In addition to being able to revenge kill a large portion of set-up sweepers in DW, Gyarados can also function as a late-game cleaner, as it receives an Attack boost from Moxie after simply revenge killing something. Therefore, Gyarados will essentially have a Dragon Dance boost while locked into a move. It is imperative that this set be used in rain, as the boosted Waterfall will greatly help Gyarados obtain the first Moxie KO, at which point very few Pokemon in DW will be able to take a hit from it. This will let it rack up more Moxie boosts for an increasingly unstoppable sweep. Waterfall is Gyarados's primary attack, and lets it revenge kill +1 Volcarona and Choice Scarf Chandelure. Earthquake takes out Empoleon and Ferrothorn, while Ice Fang comes in handy for revenge killing Dragon Dance Dragons, such as Salamence and Dragonite. While Stone Edge is mainly filler, it is Gyarados's strongest option against opposing Gyarados.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is required to outspeed +1 Haxorus, Dragonite, and every unboosted Pokemon in DW save for Deoxys-S. Jolly also allows Gyarados to both revenge kill Timid Jolteon and prevent Jolteon from revenge killing it.</p> <p>Drizzle Politoed is the best method of supplying Gyarados with rain; the Choice Specs variant is preferred as it can soften walls for Gyarados with its powerful rain-boosted Hydro Pumps. A Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon with a Choice item usually appreciates Rapid Spin support, and Gyarados is no exception. Forretress makes a good spinner, as it can lay hazards and switch into Choice Scarf Terrakion and Landorus, who both outspeed Gyarados. Gyarados will like to fire off its strong Waterfalls, so a teammate that can combat opposing Water resists is a good idea. In addition to spinning away Stealth Rock for Gyarados, Starmie can eliminate Water-types with Thunderbolt, and Grass- and Dragon-types with Ice Beam.</p> "

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>While Ditto spent the last four generations of Pokemon shunned in the corner of Bill's PC Box, only brought out to breed with other Pokemon, Dream World granted it a new lease on life. With Imposter, Ditto copies any stat boosts, moves, abilities, and even the species of the opposing Pokemon itself! Ditto works as a fantastic revenge killer thanks to its ability to both annihilate threats with the immense Speed granted by a Choice Scarf and take advantage of the opponent's boosts. This also makes the opponent wary of setting up early in a match, as the opponent does not want to get demolished by his own sweeper. However, Ditto is not without flaws. Its checks and counters completely depend upon what it changes into, limiting Ditto's staying power. Our little pink blob should never be underestimated, though, as one wrong move can spell impending doom.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With a one move movepool, it is hard to imagine that Ditto has very many other options! In all seriousness, the only change to the set above that can be made regards the IVs. Ditto can manipulate its IVs to gain the Hidden Power of its choice, so running a set with 30 Attack and 30 Defense IVs can provide Hidden Power Ice, running a set with 30 Attack, 30 Special Attack, and 30 Speed can provide Hidden Power Fire, and so on.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While most of Ditto's checks and counters are entirely subjective to the Pokemon Ditto transforms into, there are Pokemon that can stump our little pink friend. Users of the move Substitute can prevent Ditto from transforming into them, rendering it useless. Additionally, there are Pokemon that Ditto will not appreciate transforming into. While Choice Scarf Blissey may seem like a game-changer, one should note that locking Ditto into Soft-Boiled and attempting to stall out special attackers is really not as entertaining as it seems. ​ In any case, Ditto has to live in fear of walls that can wall what it transforms into. For example, should Ditto transform into Breloom, Xatu or Dragonite make for wonderful switch-ins. Additionally, should Ditto transform into Chandelure, a specially oriented tank such as Tyranitar and Snorlax can make short work of it.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is Ditto's best, and only, set in the Dream World metagame. With Imposter, Ditto automatically transforms into the opponent upon being sent into battle. Ditto has a bit of a four-moveslot syndrome, so choosing the correct move is imperative... Well, not really. If anything, Ditto has a one-moveslot syndrome. In fact, the only reason Ditto has a move is because without it, one would not be able to use Ditto. Still, Transform adds nothing to Ditto's utility, as Imposter accomplishes what Ditto would already do with Transform, though Transform does not copy stat boosts and wastes a turn.</p> <p>Ditto should only be sent out against Pokemon that one wants to revenge kill, as that is Ditto's most effective role. This holds especially true against setup sweepers that have already acquired multiple boosts, as it simply makes Ditto more deadly. If Ditto can manage to come out against Technician Breloom, Excadrill lacking Air Balloon, Swords Dance Garchomp, or Calm Mind Latios, it can use the opponent's momentum against them and sweep with impunity. However, as always, one should never send Ditto out against an opponent that has a Substitute up, as Ditto cannot transform into a Pokemon behind a Substitute and will simply become dead weight.</p> <p>Ditto's EVs are nearly useless in all situations except the very rare case where one's opponent sends Ditto out on the same turn that one's own Ditto is sent out. In this case, neither Ditto will transform, and a stall war will ensue. Thus, one wants to have the slower Ditto, as it will use Struggle after the opponent receives recoil damage, giving it an advantage. However, Ditto copies the stats of any other Pokemon that it transforms into, so the EVs serve no further purpose. Ditto does not, however, copy the opponent's IVs, so one should make sure that Ditto's IVs are set for the Hidden Power of choice. Using 30 Attack and 30 Defense IVs gives Ditto Hidden Power Ice, a good move for all-around coverage. ​ Ditto is a unique Pokemon, so it is only natural that it should be used differently than other Pokemon. Ditto should absolutely never be used as a lead or sent out to sponge a hit; these simply ruin its purpose. Instead, Ditto can be used to take on setup sweepers after they nab a KO, or simply revenge kill opposing threats. This puts Ditto users in a dilemma: what move should be used? As a general rule of thumb, Ditto should use a move that will allow it to stay in and do as much damage as possible. However, should Ditto be presented with an immediate threat that must be taken out, using the appropriate move and switching out will usually suffice.</p> <p>Ditto is also useful for scouting opponents' movesets, as it copies every move. For example, sending Ditto out against Deoxys-S seems like a bad idea for the most part, but this actually allows you to learn whether or not Deoxys-S is an offensive variant or not. Similarly, one can scout setup sweepers in order to react appropriately and wall them, or to scout versatile Pokemon to learn how to stop them.</p> "

  "Jolteon": {
    "overview": "<p>Jolteon's fate is a sad one. At first, Jolteon's respectable base 110 Special Attack and base 130 Speed appear to make it a deadly powerhouse that all teams should prepare for. However, Jolteon is overshadowed by Raikou, which is stronger, bulkier, and boasts superb coverage. In addition, Jolteon is a favorite target for Ground-type Pokemon, as well as priority users and Choice Scarf revenge killers. Luckily, Jolteon's saving grace is Baton Pass. With access to boosting moves such as Work Up and Charge Beam, Jolteon can easily beef up a teammate and win back momentum. In addition, Jolteon's Speed makes it one of the fastest Baton Passers in existence, and despite being outshined by Raikou, it can still deliver lethal damage. While Jolteon's role in Dream World is vastly different from its niche in OU, it is still a stellar Pokemon to use.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Jolteon's shallow movepool means that it does not have a lot of other options. One thing Jolteon can do is to run a special attacker set with Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Ice, Volt Switch, and Shadow Ball with either Life Orb or Choice Specs. This set's advantage over Raikou, Jolteon's biggest rival, is that Jolteon's base 130 Speed allows it to outspeed threats that Raikou cannot, such as Starmie, Weavile, and Modest Choice Scarf Chandelure. If you prefer the Baton Pass set more, one additional move Jolteon can pass is Agility; this allows Jolteon to help out powerful but slow teammates. The problem is that your opponent will rarely give you enough time to Baton Pass both Agility and Work Up / Charge Beam simultaneously. Fake Tears is an interesting option as it allows Jolteon to electrocute special walls more easily. Fake Tears can also be used to phaze, which gives Jolteon an easier time to set up. Yawn is another great phazing move, particularly against faster, offensive Pokemon that do not mind Fake Tears's Special Defense drop.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In order to shut down Jolteon, you need to either KO it or force it out before it Baton Passes a boosting move. Ground-type Pokemon are fantastic at scaring non-Air Balloon Jolteon; Gliscor, Landorus, Garchomp, and Excadrill can safely switch into a Thunderbolt and threaten it with Earthquake. However, Hidden Power Ice can OHKO the former three, so switch smartly. On the defensive side, Gastodon's special bulk allows it to sponge anything Jolteon throws at it. Gastrodon's cousin Quagsire might not be as bulky, but its Unaware ability renders Jolteon's boosts useless. In addition to Ground-types, special walls such as Blissey and specially defensive Tyranitar can soak up anything Jolteon throws at them; Tyranitar can then KO Jolteon with Crunch. Pokemon with the Lightning Rod or Volt Absorb abilities, particularly Zapdos and Raikou, can switch safely into Thunderbolt and fry Jolteon's Baton Pass recipient. Finally, you can try priority attacks, such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed or Breloom's Mach Punch. These attacks bypass Jolteon's speed and can quickly knock it out before it uses Baton Pass. Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion can also outspeed Jolteon and KO it.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Baton Pass",
        "description": "<p>The purpose of this set is to switch Jolteon into a Pokemon it can threaten, such as Politoed. Once the foe switches out, Jolteon can use a boosting move and then quickly Baton Pass before the switch-in can attack. The two boosting moves in question are Work Up and Charge Beam. Work Up is the recommended choice because it boosts both Attack and Special Attack; unlike moves that boost only a single offensive stat, Work Up allows you to choose your receivers with more freedom. Charge Beam only boosts Special Attack, which restricts which Pokemon it can pass the boost to. However, it does deal a modest amount of damage, which can be just enough to finish off a weakened Pokemon. Using Charge Beam can also trick opponents into thinking that Jolteon is running an offensive set, which allows it to use Baton Pass when they least expect it. Jolteon can also opt to stay in and use its boosts, as it boasts excellent coverage and power with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice off its base 110 Special Attack stat. If you want to trade power for longevity, consider using Substitute over Hidden Power Ice. This gives Jolteon and its receiver a cushion against status effects, as well as more leeway for mistakes. However, using Substitute has a nasty drawback: Jolteon becomes a sitting duck against Ground-types and other Pokemon immune to Electric-type attacks.</p> <p>The EV spread for this set is simple: 252 EVs in Special Attack give Jolteon maximum power, and 252 EVs in Speed along with a Timid nature allow it to outspeed almost every single non-boosted Pokemon. Life Orb complements Jolteon's power by giving it a nice boost; however, Air Balloon is useful for evading Earthquake, which usually OHKOes Jolteon. As for alternative attacks, Jolteon can use Hidden Power Grass to nail Quagsire and Gastrodon. Even though these two Pokemon are a bit uncommon in Dream World, they are still a pain for Jolteon to handle. The downside to using Hidden Power Grass, though, is that Jolteon loses a great deal of coverage. Because of this, Jolteon appreciates having powerful Grass-type teammates to pass to such as Breloom or Venusaur; these two appreciate not having to set up and waste a turn, and do a fine job at scaring Quagsire and Gastrodon.</p> <p>One particular strategy that works well with Jolteon is rain. Jolteon is an excellent addition to a rain team because it can soak up Electric-type attacks with Volt Absorb and fire off a perfectly accurate Thunder. In addition, Jolteon can pass boosts to rain sweepers such as Rotom-W and Keldeo, which then become even more devastating. Aside from Politoed, which is a must-have, two great teammates that also benefit from Drizzle are Vaporeon and Ferrothorn. Vaporeon can heal Jolteon with Wish and attract Electric-type attacks for Jolteon to switch into, while Ferrothorn can provide support with Spikes and Stealth Rock. Although a bit unorthodox, Vaporeon can also continue the Baton Pass chain with Acid Armor.</p> <p>Although Jolteon can use Baton Pass to escape from trouble, Choice Scarf-wielding Pokemon can outspeed and KO it. Two particular examples are Choice Scarf Landorus and Garchomp; these two can come in on Thunderbolt or a boosting move and threaten to OHKO Jolteon if it uses Life Orb. Landorus falls quickly to a powerful Ice- or Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Starmie and Gyarados, which have excellent synergy with Jolteon as they attract Electric-type attacks. Garchomp is trickier to handle; try using priority attacks such as Mamoswine's Ice Shard or your own Choice Scarf revenge killer. Jolteon is also troubled by specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Latias. Latias is especially threatening as it can also use Roar to phaze Jolteon and destroy the Baton Pass chain. Powerful physical attackers can deal with these threats. Scizor is a good example; it destroys Blissey and Ferrothorn with Superpower, traps Latias with Pursuit,and also can learn Baton Pass to continue the chain if necessary.</p> "

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>While Dragonite's presence in OU has often been harmed by faster, sleeker Dragon-types such Salamence, Dream World brought it one of the most game changing abilities: Multiscale. With Multiscale, Dragonite gained the ability to set up on nearly every threat in the metagame due to Multiscale halving damage from attacks when at full health. Additionally, Dragonite's large movepool and great offensive stats make it one of the scariest sweepers in the metagame. While Dragonite's Speed may seem underwhelming, its bulk and versatility compensates, and it is thus one of the most fearsome Pokemon in the Dream World metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragonite is undeniably one of the most diverse Pokemon in the game, with only Pokemon like Mew giving competition. Not only does it have a large attacking movepool, but it can utilize support options such as Thunder Wave, Tailwind, Heal Bell, and Haze to support teams. However, one must always take into account the illegalities associated with each supporting move, as Heal Bell and Multiscale are not compatible. Another option is Agility, though it is fairly redundant with Dragon Dance boosting both Attack and Speed already. Dragonite also has access to Dragon Tail, allowing it to phaze Espeon and thus break Baton Pass chains, and it can be used on more defensive sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Dragonite's sheer versatility makes it impossible for one set of concrete checks and counters, so the easiest way to be prepared for all threats is by utilizing a revenge killer that can take down Dragonite. Choice Scarf Terrakion, Genesect, Landorus, Latios, and Rotom-W can all come in and threaten an OHKO after Stealth Rock has broken Multiscale, while Timid Choice Scarf Chandelure can Speed tie with +1 Dragonite. However, one must note that these checks will fail should Multiscale be active. In addition, should Dragonite be at +2, it will outspeed said checks and KO them with the appropriate move, so limiting Dragonite's opportunities to set up is heavily advised.</p> <p>Physical sets such as Dragon Dance and Choice Band have more defined counters than the others; walls such as Skarmory and Slowbro can take a hit or two and retaliate back by either phazing or straight up KOing Dragonite. Should Dragonite be locked into Outrage, any bulky Steel-type will be able to come in and hurt Dragonite; Heatran, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn can all deal heavy damage to Dragonite or set up entry hazards. However, Dragonite can pack the appropriate move to KO all of these Pokemon, so one must be wary when switching in a Steel-type, as losing a solid counter to Dragonite early on in a match is certainly inadvisable. Other solid defensive presences that do well against Dragonite are Cloyster and Porygon2; both can sponge a hit and KO back with an Ice-type attack. Cloyster can also break through Multiscale due to Icicile Spear hitting multiple times. To add insult to injury, Porygon2 will even Trace Dragonite's ability, Multiscale, making it even harder to take down. Mew and Tangrowth are other solid counters, though Tangrowth can get 2HKOed by a +1 Fire Punch. Other noteworthy Pokemon that can be problematic are Choice Scarf Haxorus and Salamence; Haxorus can simply OHKO Dragonite through Multiscale with Outrage thanks to Mold Breaker, while Salamence is safe as long as Multiscale is broken. However, these two Pokemon have trouble surviving boosted Extreme Speed, so it is advised to carry another check or counter to Dragonite.</p> <p>Possibly the most reliable way of taking down Dragonite is Stealth Rock support. With Stealth Rock, Multiscale will always be broken when Dragonite switches in, making it easier to take down. Residual damage from sandstorm is also very helpful in taking down Dragonite, as it cancels out Leftovers recovery that can be vital. This makes Dragonite prone to revenge killing, unless of course it carries Extreme Speed. Finally, status, particularly burn and paralysis, will cripple Dragonite for the rest of the match unless it packs a Lum Berry.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>With Multiscale, Dragonite can essentially nab a free Dragon Dance even if the opponent sports an Ice-type move because the power of attacks is halved, and its bulk allows it to live through most moves. With just one boost, Dragonite can begin its rampage against the many frail Pokemon in DW OU, though with two boosts it will outspeed Pokemon that can cause problems, such as Choice Scarf Genesect. Outrage will do massive damage to any Pokemon that isn't a dedicated physical wall or a Steel-type. Note that Outrage should not be used until all of these Pokemon are removed from the battle by other members of the team.</p> <p>Fire Punch demolishes Ferrothorn, Scizor, Skarmory, and Genesect switching into a predicted Outrage. Extreme Speed is preferred in the last slot because it makes Dragonite a pseudo-revenge killer, but Earthquake can also be used because Dragonite would be walled by Heatran otherwise. When choosing between Extreme Speed and Earthquake, it is often best to see what your team needs more; Earthquake is a reliable answer to Heatran, while Extreme Speed is best used if you need a strong priority user.</p> <p>The EV spread strengthens Dragonite's offensive potential by maximizing Attack and Speed for a quick sweep. With an Adamant nature, Dragonite's main checks—particularly Heatran—won't even be able to switch in without fearing a swift 2HKO if it has obtained at least two boosts. The item choice is based entirely upon preference. Those who wish to avoid getting KOed quickly by errant Ice Beams or Ice Shards can opt for a Yache Berry, though this is not as useful as Leftovers or even Lum Berry. Since one of the most common ways of dealing with Dragonite is through status, Lum Berry will often be of good use; however, Leftovers offers reliable recovery and can often help out when sweeping. Keep in mind that Lum Berry also has the ability to remove confusion after Outrage has confused Dragonite.</p> <p>While Heatran will be troublesome without Earthquake, Dragonite is often able to plow through it given enough Dragon Dance boosts. However, this is not always the best alternative, so if one chooses to forgo Earthquake for a priority move in Extreme Speed, packing a means of defeating Heatran will be wise: Water-, Ground-, or Fighting-type moves should suffice. Additionally, Dragonite loves the presence of status absorbers such as Gliscor or Starmie, so their support is often appreciated. On another note, Rapid Spin support is important if one wants to be able to sweep at any given point in a match, as it preserves Multiscale and ensures that Dragonite will not be revenge killed easily. Sun support works very well because it gives Fire Punch an additional buff. One should always pack a Pokemon that can adequately deal with Skarmory because without insurance against Skarmory, Dragonite can lose the boosts that it worked hard to gain by Skarmory's Whirlwind.</p> <p>While Waterfall can be used on rain teams, it lacks the coverage presented by Fire Punch, and Dragonite would be forced to run Earthquake to prevent being walled by Ferrothorn. Brick Break is another move that works well on this set, as it provides perfect coverage with Outrage. However, it's a weak move, so you are generally better off running Earthquake, Extreme Speed, or Fire Punch in its place. Another option for the set is Fire Blast, which can be used instead of Fire Punch to potentially 2HKO Skarmory without any boosts. However, Dragonite prefers not to use a nature that lowers its great defenses, and with an Adamant or Jolly nature, it does not appreciate the cut in Special Attack either. In the rain, one can choose to use Aqua Jet instead of Extreme Speed as a priority move because it removes fast Choice Scarf users such as Landorus and Chandelure.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Dragonite's high base Attack and decent base Speed allow it to successfully pull off a Choice Band set. While many key threats do outspeed Dragonite, it can make up for this with its massive power and access to priority moves. Outrage is Dragonite's main STAB attack, and does a giant chunk of damage to Pokemon that do not resist it; it even has the chance to 2HKO Heatran after Stealth Rock damage. Another asset available to Dragonite is Earthquake, which hits the aforementioned Heatran for super effective damage. However, Earthquake must be used with caution, as Dragonite will not be able to switch moves and might get set up on by Pokemon such as Latios. Extreme Speed is one of Dragonite's more reliable moves, as it makes Dragonite a potent revenge killer that can take out weakened faster foes such as Gyarados and Thundurus. The choice of move for the fourth moveslot really depends on the necessities of your team; Fire Punch is a reliable move to take down defensive behemoths such as Ferrothorn and landing an OHKO on Genesect. However, one must keep in mind that most Genesect run Ice Beam, meaning they can get past Dragonite easily if Multiscale is broken. Waterfall is also a decent option, and it is also powered up by the ubiquitous rain. However, if one fears that getting locked into Outrage is unfavorable, Dragon Claw can be used as a reliable, albeit less powerful STAB.</p> <p>The EVs are standard for a Choice Band user; maximum Attack and Speed for maximum power is a good motto to follow. With an Adamant nature, Dragonite has over 600 Attack with a Choice Band. While Dragonite is by no means fast, it outspeeds what it needs to, such as Breloom, Heatran, and Tyranitar, and it can tank most hits and KO Pokemon back with the appropriate move. though Dragonite does not have to necessarily invest fully in Speed to do so. However, there is usually no better place to put the EVs, and investing in Speed allows Dragonite to Speed tie with opposing Adamant Dragonite and Gyarados.</p> <p>One thing that every user should note is to ensure that Chandelure is not on the opposing team before using Extreme Speed. If one uses Extreme Speed and the opponent brings out Chandelure, Dragonite will be a sitting duck for it to take it out or set up with Substitute and Calm Mind until Extreme Speed's PP expires. Another problem with the set is that every time Dragonite switches in, it will lose 25% of its health if Stealth Rock is up, so Rapid Spin support is obviously very helpful. Choice Band Dragonite also heavily appreciates Wish support because it has no reliable way of healing itself; Blissey, Chansey, and Jirachi thus make great partners for this set.</p> <p>While there are other noteworthy options available to Dragonite such as Superpower, these can possibly limit Dragonite to using its inferior ability, Inner Focus. This is often unfavorable, and the given moves provide Dragonite with all the necessary coverage. Another option is Brick Break, and while it is inferior to Superpower in every aspect other than the drops in Attack and Defense, it can be used alongside Multiscale, making it viable. However, Earthquake is generally a better move because it provides Dragonite with similar coverage.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While the conventional offensive Dragon Dance set relies on using Multiscale to obtain a Dragon Dance boost, this set utilizes Dragonite's great bulk to sponge hits with ease and attempt a sweep. On average, bulky Dragonite is able to nab more Dragon Dance boosts than the offensive variant, though it won't be able to sweep as quickly. Since this set focuses more on consistency and bulk, Dragon Claw is the preferred option for Dragonite's primary STAB move; it allows Dragonite to use another move instead of getting locked into one and preventing it from healing. However, one can use Outrage if the power drop is too large to handle. Fire Punch and Earthquake both provide Dragonite with great coverage, though choosing between the two can be difficult. With Fire Punch, Heatran completely walls Dragonite, but with Earthquake, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Bronzong all have their way with it. Roost is key to this set's success because it provides reliable recovery, as well as a neutrality to Ice-type moves and a chance to regain Multiscale.</p> <p>The EVs give Dragonite a decent amount of Attack to boost from while also allowing it to outspeed Starmie after just one Dragon Dance. Maximum HP EVs are invested because this Dragonite does not mind taking hits; in fact, it sets up thanks to its ability to sponge hits with its bulk. A spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used, but it usually leaves Dragonite too weak to do any major damage until it gets 3 or 4 boosts. Dragonite's item choice depends upon the team's needs; if the team packs a cleric such as Chansey or a status absorber such as Starmie, one can run Leftovers without a second thought. However, a Lum Berry is also a good option because one of the most common and popular ways of dealing with Dragonite is through status. Using a Lum Berry can also give Dragonite an extra turn of setup, which can be deadly in the long run.</p> <p>While Dragonite can use Waterfall or Brick Break to take down Terrakion, Heatran, and Tyranitar, the two moves are fairly weak, and with only 44 Attack EVs, they will not be able to provide the good attacking power that one would hope for, even though Dragon / Fighting coverage is unresisted. Partners for this set include those that can use Rapid Spin to ease Dragonite's setup. Starmie is remarkable in this regard because it can take down troublesome Skarmory and clear the field of entry hazards.</p> "

        "name": "Rain Attacker",
        "description": "<p>While Dragonite most often runs Dragon Dance or Choice Band sets, it works very well as a rain attacker too. With rain support, Dragonite can effectively lure out its counters and wreak havoc with its amazing movepool. Hurricane's accuracy is perfect under rain, and with STAB and a large Base Power, it can destroy unprepared teams. It also KOes Breloom and Virizion handily, putting a stop to any sweep that was planned. Both Surf and Aqua Tail work very well under rain, as their Base Powers are effectively raised to 135; they also do heavy damage to Tyranitar and Heatran that try to switch in and wall Dragonite. Extreme Speed makes Dragonite a pseudo revenge killer that can check frailer threats that have lost HP due to prior damage. However, both Thunder and Draco Meteor are options for their damage output. Thunder also dissuades Skarmory from switching in on Dragonite, while Draco Meteor does heavy damage to any physical walls. Roost provides the ability to regain health, which works well for defensive players. It also mitigates the Life Orb damage that Dragonite takes. However, for those who worry about Chansey and Blissey walling this set, Superpower is another viable option, although it requires using Inner Focus, which is undesirable.</p> <p>While running a Life Orb on a set with Multiscale may seem counterintuitive, it's actually very useful to nab extra KOs. Furthermore, Dragonite can simply Roost away any damage if worse comes to worst. Despite this, Dragonite also has the ability to run Leftovers on the set, but the drop in power is quite noticeable. If running a physical move such as Aqua Tail or Extreme Speed, Dragonite can also run an offensive EV spread of 252 Atk / 252 SpA / 4 Spe at the cost of some bulk.</p> <p>Most people expect Dragonite to be the common Dragon Dance or Choice Band set, but with moves such as Hurricane and Aqua Tail, Dragonite will not be able to feign a Dragon Dance set for very long. While counters to this set include Pokemon that can take rain-boosted Aqua Tail and STAB Hurricanes, because the set is mixed and powered by a Life Orb, even dedicated walls will fall. However, Chansey and Blissey present a tough challenge unless Dragonite carries Superpower, so one should prepare accordingly. Terrakion works very well as a teammate to beat down the pink blobs, as does Breloom, as they appreciate the opportunity to switch in safely and set up.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>While Espeon is certainly nothing to laugh at with its Magic Bounce ability, the Dream World metagame provides many threats, such as Genesect and Excadrill, that give it a hard time. However, that is not to say that the Sun Pokemon is unusable. In fact, given the correct support, Espeon can really <em>shine, and it has the potential to sweep whole teams. Espeon can also be used as a decent supporter thanks to its large supporting movepool and high base Speed. While the big guns of the Dream World might harass it, Espeon should never be underestimated unless one wants to get swept.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Due to its poor movepool, Espeon has a slim set of other viable options. While it can run a Calm Mind set that capitalizes on its boosts and attempts to sweep, Tyranitar, Genesect, Thundurus, and Excadrill are all so common that this is never a truly viable option unless given major support. In the sun, Espeon can run Morning Sun to heal more than half of its HP back, but with the ubiquity of Tyranitar and Politoed, Morning Sun will often be a waste of a moveslot. Judging by Espeon's stats alone, it would seem to be an excellent Choice Scarf or Choice Specs user, but because its coverage is severely limited, Espeon is usually best running simple sweeping or supporting sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While Espeon cannot be phazed out like most sweepers that try to garner boosts, its downfall stems from its low Defense stat. Threats such as Tyranitar and Scizor can both put Espeon in a checkmate position, the former due to STAB Pursuit and the latter because of both Bullet Punch and Pursuit. While Espeon can pack the correct Hidden Power to take on each of these threats, it cannot take repeated hits from either, and will be worn away quickly by passive damage from entry hazards. Genesect makes a fine check to Espeon because it can come in on a Calm Mind or Psychic-type STAB attack and grab an Attack boost from Download. It should be noted that even with minimal investment in Attack, Genesect will always OHKO Espeon with U-turn.</p> <p>Garchomp can switch in on most of Espeon's attacks due to its great bulk and do massive damage with either of its STAB attacks. Excadrill also does well because it outspeeds and OHKOes Espeon with Earthquake when used in sand. However, one should be wary of Hidden Power Fighting or Hidden Power Fire, because losing HP to an attack on the switch-in is unfavorable. Shadow Tag Chandelure presents Espeon with a unique threat, especially if Chandelure is equipped with a Choice Scarf. If it manages to come in unscathed, Chandelure can simply use Shadow Ball to OHKO unboosted Espeon or even revenge kill Espeon if weakened sufficiently. While Espeon cannot be phazed by normal means such as Roar and Whirlwind, one can use Circle Throw and Dragon Tail to limit Espeon's fun. However, one must be wary of a miss from the aforementioned moves, as it can spell doom.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Espeon's Magic Bounce ability makes it a great supporter by letting it bounce back Spore, Stealth Rock, and Thunder Wave from the likes of common Pokemon such as Breloom, Ferrothorn, and Thundurus, respectively. Additionally, with its high Speed, Espeon can set up dual screens with ease. This can aid sweepers such as Landorus, Breloom, and Excadrill immensely, as it gives them an opportunity to boost their stats to sky-high levels. Espeon's third move depends on preference, as Psychic and Psyshock will do minor damage to Blissey and Chansey regardless. However, one should note that Psychic will hit Gliscor much harder than Psyshock. Hidden Power Fire gives Espeon coverage against some common threats in the metagame, namely Genesect, Ferrothorn, and Scizor. Baton Pass carries utility, though, as it allows Espeon to escape common Pursuit users such as Tyranitar, who have the ability to ruin Espeon's day.</p> <p>Espeon's EVs are straightforward for a supporter of its nature. With maximum investment in Speed along with a Timid nature, Espeon can take advantage of its excellent base 110 Speed and set up screens with ease. Maximum investment in HP allows Espeon to take hits and find setup opportunities later in a battle. While Leftovers might seem like a good idea for reliable recovery, Light Clay is usually valued more because it allows the screens to stay up longer, giving sweepers the freedom to set up more easily. While Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Pokemon such as Heatran and Chandelure hard, Hidden Power Fire puts the hurt on Genesect, Ferrothorn, and Scizor, some of the most common threats in the metagame. An alternate EV spread with maximum Special Attack as opposed to HP can be used to buff Espeon's offenses, but Espeon's niche is setting up dual screens, so this is usually not the best choice. Nonetheless, with 60 Special Attack EVs, Espeon can 2HKO 252/252+ Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>The best partners for Espeon are those that can take full advantage of the screens it sets up. Setup sweepers in general largely benefit from dual screens, and they make great partners for Espeon. Garchomp—an already bulky Pokemon—does very well behind dual screens, as it can simply take most hits and retaliate with a Swords Dance-boosted Outrage or Earthquake. Dragon Dance Dragonite, Calm Mind Chandelure, Swords Dance Breloom, and Calm Mind Keldeo also do very well as recipients of the rise in defenses offered, and they can all be very deadly if given the chance to set up properly. Terrakion also makes a great partner because Espeon can Baton Pass against a Tyranitar that attempts to use Pursuit, only to have Terrakion receive an Attack boost courtesy of Justified. One always needs to watch out for opposing Choice Scarf Chandelure when playing with Espeon, since if Light Screen is not set up, Chandelure will simply OHKO Espeon with Shadow Ball. Genesect also poses a large threat, especially variants with both Bug Buzz and U-turn. While Espeon can buffer itself against one of Genesect's Bug-type STAB moves, the other simply OHKOes it.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Espeon's access to Baton Pass and its high base Speed give it the ability to run a good Baton Pass set. While one might question what Espeon has over any other user of Baton Pass, the answer is simple: Magic Bounce. Magic Bounce allows Espeon to avoid being phazed by Roar and Whirlwind, bounce back status moves such as Spore, and prevent fast Taunts. Calm Mind works very well here, as Espeon can use the boosts to sweep when given the chance. However, more often than not, Espeon will simply pass the boosts on to another sweeper that will then take care of business. Psychic is a solid STAB move, though Stored Power is also an option because Espeon might be able to rack up multiple boosts. If one uses Espeon on a dedicated Baton Pass team, Hidden Power Fire is the superior option because it allows Espeon to possibly OHKO Genesect if Espeon is at +1 Speed. However, Hidden Power Fighting allows Espeon to hit the ubiquitous Tyranitar and other Dark-types that would otherwise wall this set, so it's crucial to Espeon's success.</p> <p>The EVs are standard for a Pokemon of Espeon's supporting nature: maximizing HP allows Espeon to take hits, and maximizing Speed allows Espeon to be a better user of Baton Pass. A Timid nature is necessary to ensure that Espeon outpaces key threats such as Keldeo and Terrakion, and it also allows Espeon to Speed tie with Latios and Latias. While Espeon's attacking options on this set are severely limited, one can choose to run Hidden Power Fire to deal with Genesect more easily. However, most Genesect are equipped with a Choice Scarf, so Espeon cannot guarantee to beat it even with Hidden Power Fire; one simply has to rely on prediction skills to win. Hidden Power Ice allows Espeon to hit Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Salamence harder, but aside from this use, it does not offer much more. If one's team is already packed with stat-boosting Pokemon, one can use Substitute instead of Calm Mind to achieve an easier sweep.</p> <p>Any specially based sweeper will immensely appreciate the support that Espeon brings. Keldeo can capitalize on Espeon's Calm Mind boosts and forgo Calm Mind on its own set for Substitute, making it deadlier. In addition, Keldeo is one of the few specially based sweepers that is not walled by the likes of Chansey and Blissey, so it works wonders when coupled with Espeon. Furthermore, Rock Polish Genesect can pair up well with Espeon because it can use Rock Polish while forcing switches and simply wreak havoc. Outside of supporting sweepers, this Espeon set does not have much more use due to its poor Defense, so one should only use it on offensively oriented teams. Vaporeon works well as a partner because it can pass Defense boosts and heal Espeon with Wish.</p> "

Don't let these faults deter you from using Forretress, though; with the correct team support, it will prove to be an excellent member of your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Earthquake and Gyro Ball are good attacking moves, but Hidden Power Ice is much more useful as it enables Forretress to check Dragon-types and Gliscor. Toxic cripples bulky Water-types that switch into Forretress, such as Politoed and Jellicent, but Forretress often can't spare a moveslot. Forretress can viably run a dual screens set, but hazards are often more useful, and there are many other faster Pokemon who can run a dual screens set much better than Forretress. A ChestoRest set might let Forretress live a little longer than usual, but it will miss the passive recovery from Leftovers and the moveslot it had to sacrifice to Rest.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As Forretress doesn't have much of an offensive presence, it's rather easy to check. Genesect and Heatran can scorch Forretress with Flamethrower, and offensive Deoxys-S the same with Hidden Power Fire. Chandelure can trap all Forretress lacking Shed Shell and OHKO with Overheat or Fire Blast before Forretress can escape with Volt Switch. Bulky Water-types such as Politoed can threaten Forretress with Scald; a burn also significantly reduces Forretress's longevity. Jellicent can Taunt Forretress as well, which prevents it from setting up entry hazards. Manaphy can set up Tail Glow without fear, then proceed to destroy Forretress and potentially your whole team with a boosted Surf.</p> <p>Forretress has trouble defeating set-up sweepers that don't take significant damage from Hidden Power Ice. Excadrill can set up Swords Dance on Forretress and proceed to 2HKO with Earthquake, as it fears none of Forretress's moves.

        "description": "<p>Forretress's excellent typing and good stats let it check a plethora of commonly used Pokemon in DW, such as Garchomp and Gliscor. A specially defensive spread allows Forretress to more easily switch into weak special attacks, such as Scald, and is therefore recommended. Rapid Spin is what sets Forretress apart from Ferrothorn, its largest defensive competitor, as spin support is vital on many teams. Volt Switch is another move that Forretress has over Ferrothorn; with Volt Switch, Forretress can fill a niche of an excellent defensive pivot that can take a hit, set up entry hazards, and maintain momentum. Additionally, Volt Switch enables Forretress to lure in spinblockers, most notably Chandelure and Jellicent, and switch out to Tyranitar, trapping them with Pursuit. Hidden Power Ice, although seemingly silly on a Pokemon with such a low Special Attack stat, is surprisingly useful. With the given EV spread, Hidden Power Ice nets a 2HKO on Garchomp, Gliscor, and Dragonite, all of whom are popular Pokemon in DW. The fourth moveslot should be tailored to your team's needs; Forretress can set up Stealth Rock with ease, but if another member of your team can set it up, Spikes and Toxic Spikes are both viable alternatives.</p> <p>The choice between Leftovers and Shed Shell is a significant one. Leftovers is preferred because Forretress doesn't have access to a reliable recovery move outside of Rest, so the extra HP gained from Leftovers is invaluable. On the other hand, Shed Shell prevents Forretress from being destroyed by Chandelure, one of the most threatening Pokemon in DW. Keep in mind that Volt Switch allows Forretress to escape the wrath of Chandelure either on the switch or if your opponent gets greedy and goes for Substitute. Another entry hazard could be used over Hidden Power Ice, but this would allow some of the most threatening sweepers in DW, such as Garchomp and Gliscor, to set up on Forretress with impunity.</p> <p>Terrakion relies on Stealth Rock support to wear down its checks and counters, such as Skarmory and Gliscor. Additionally, Forretress and Dragonite have decent defensive synergy. Jellicent also has good defensive synergy with Forretress and can spinblock, which prevents Forretress's hard work from going to waste. Heatran can switch into the Fire-type attacks that give Forretress trouble, and can utilize Stealth Rock to free up a moveslot for Forretress to lay a more uncommon hazard. Politoed is a cool partner as it sets up rain, which lessens the damage Forretress takes from Fire-type moves.</p> "

Rapid Spin is arguably the most important move in the set, as it benefits just about all teams. Furthermore, Forretress can switch into most Tyranitar, Bronzong, and Ferrothorn without fear. Volt Switch is what sets Forretress apart from other defensive Steel-types; it gives Forretress the ability to not only tank hits, but to maintain momentum for your team too. Volt Switch is also excellent for luring in Ghost-types, most commonly Jellicent and Chandelure; you can then switch to a Pursuit trapper to get rid of them. Hidden Power Ice might seem like a strange pick considering Forretress's low Special Attack stat, but the move is surprisingly useful. For instance, it lets Forretress 2HKO Gliscor, as well as Garchomp and Dragonite, after Stealth Rock. Additionally, Forretress's other offensive moves, such as Gyro Ball and Earthquake, are rather mediocre. Finally, the last moveslot depends on what your team needs; run Stealth Rock if your team has no other user of the move, and Spikes or Toxic Spikes if your team already has a Stealth Rock user.</p> <p>The choice between Leftovers and Shed Shell is very important. Leftovers is the primary option because Forretress doesn't have access to a reliable recovery move, and thus appreciates that recovery that Leftovers provides. However, Shed Shell is useful for switching out from Chandelure, who can otherwise set up on, and easily eliminate, it. Remember, though, that Forretress can always use Volt Switch to escape Chandelure.</p> <p>This set deals with physical attackers such as Garchomp and Dragonite much more comfortably than the specially defensive variant does. Jellicent appreciates the entry hazards that Forretress provides as it can force switches with Taunt; Jellicent also likes having powerful Dragon-types removed and can block Rapid Spin, ensuring that you have the hazard advantage. Tyranitar also likes having Dragon-types eliminated as they can demolish it, can set up Stealth Rock to let Forretress lay another hazard, and checks special attackers that Forretress hates, such as Heatran and Ninetails. Politoed is a good partner as it summons rain, which reduces the damage Forretress takes from Fire-type moves.</p> "

It can wall threats that Ferrothorn could never dream of handling while supporting its team, and it can even disrupt other walls if need be. It's a fantastic wall and easily one of the biggest hurdles for sand teams to overcome, walling menacing Dragon-types and threats such as Excadrill and Garchomp. To put it bluntly, Skarmory is probably the best Steel-type wall in Dream World.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Skarmory can opt to run a specially defensive EV spread and nature, but compared to Ferrothorn it is a rather poor special wall, especially when considering how difficult it is to kill with a physically defensive spread. If Brave Bird's recoil is unappealing, then Drill Peck is an alternative, though the drop in power is noticeable. For example, Skarmory loses the ability to break Garchomp's Substitute. Sky Drop, Toxic, and Torment can all be used to disrupt the opponent, but the use of any of these moves forces Skarmory to give up critically important moveslot. Brave Bird is the most replaceable of Skarmory's staple moves, if any of these options are appealing. Skarmory has access to a rather gimmicky Swords Dance set that takes advantage of Weak Armor for Speed boosts, but it is very weak and Skarmory can have difficulty setting up due to its special frailty.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Chandelure and Magnezone are the biggest threats to Skarmory when it is not holding a Shed Shell, as they can trap it and OHKO with their respective STAB moves. Special attackers in general, especially those who can capitalize on forcing Skarmory out, such as Genesect and Rotom-W, give Skarmory severe trouble. Fast Pokemon with Taunt, such as Deoxys-S and Gyarados, can shut down Skarmory completely. Skarmory also hates sun, as it allows normally-survivable unSTABed special Fire-type attacks to OHKO it. Dragon-type Pokemon, like Salamence, are especially threatening because of this, as Skarmory's team can no longer rely on Skarmory to take Dragon-type attacks. Rapid Spin, though not directly dangerous to Skarmory, undoes all of its work, so a Ghost-type teammate, such as Choice Scarf Chandelure is handy for preventing entry hazards from being blown away.</p> ",

Spikes are Skarmory's primary form of team support and by far the preferred of its two entry hazards. However, if Skarmory's team desperately needs a Stealth Rock user it can fill that role. Roost and Whirlwind make breaking through Skarmory a challenge, with the latter preventing setup and racking up entry hazard damage quite quickly. Brave Bird is Skarmory's STAB move of choice, allowing it to threaten offensive Pokemon who are weak to it, such as Breloom or Serperior. Additionally, if Skarmory is at full health, Sturdy ensures that Skarmory can use Brave Bird to trade its life for that of a rampaging Blaziken or Volcarona. Taunt is also a viable option, shutting down other entry hazard users such as Ferrothorn; however, the lack of a reliable STAB move can be detrimental against Pokemon such as Magic Bounce Espeon.</p> <p>Shed Shell is Skarmory's item of choice, and for very good reason. Without it, Skarmory becomes a sitting duck against Shadow Tag Chandelure, and as such becomes a fairly subpar wall. Shed Shell allows Skarmory to escape Chandelure's shadowy clutches, and Skarmory doesn't mind losing Leftovers recovery too much because of its fantastic bulk and reliable recovery. Bolder users of Skarmory can use Leftovers, as the extra recovery can be useful, but they have to accept that they will eventually lose Skarmory to a Chandelure because of the lack of Shed Shell. In terms of EV spread and nature, both are geared toward maximizing Skarmory's physical bulk. If Taunt is being used, then some EVs can be shifted from Defense to Speed to get the jump on walls and other Skarmory.</p> <p>Skarmory absolutely needs a teammate who can deal with Chandelure, regardless of whether or not Skarmory is using a Shed Shell. Tyranitar is the absolute best option available if Skarmory is not already being used on a different type of weather team. Tyranitar's Sand Stream ability provides extra passive damage, it can always OHKO a fleeing Chandelure with Pursuit, and can set up Stealth Rock, giving Skarmory's Whirlwind a bit of a bite. Skarmory has issues with Volt Switch, which when boosted by STAB can generally OHKO Skarmory if Sturdy is broken. Because of this fact, Skarmory is forced out and its team loses momentum. Ground-type Pokemon, such as Garchomp and Gastrodon, alleviate this issue. Special attackers generally give Skarmory trouble, so a stall team can use Pokemon such as Blissey and Amoonguss to handle them. In return, Skarmory can handle the physical Pokemon who give its teammates trouble. Skarmory is also helpless against last-pokemon Excadrill since Skarmory cannot phaze it out, so a teammate who can deal with it, such as Technician Breloom or Choice Scarf Politoed, is recommended.</p> "

Donphan is a good candidate for a Choice Band set as it has strong EdgeQuake coverage in addition to priority in the form of Ice Shard, but Landorus and Excadrill generally outclass it in this role, and Donphan should almost always be utilizing one of its best traits: Rapid Spin. Counter is an interesting option on Donphan as Sturdy essentially gives it a free Focus Sash, but this set has trouble using Rapid Spin or setting up hazards as it is usually at 1 HP. Superpower can be used to stop Air Balloon users such as Excadrill, Heatran, and Terrakion from setting up on Donphan, but the stat drops make Donphan prime setup bait. Assurance can be used to hit Ghost-types trying to block Rapid Spin, but its power is inconsistent, meaning that Jellicent and Gengar can easily shrug off an Assurance at 50 Base Power. Donphan has access to some other attacks such as Seed Bomb, Thunder Fang, and Ice Fang, but Earthquake and Stone Edge usually provide it with enough coverage and power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Defensive Donphan despises Ghost-types as they block Rapid Spin; Jellicent is only 3HKOed by Earthquake while Gengar is immune to it, and both can KO Donphan with their respective STAB attacks.

Knock Off can strip Jellicent of its Leftovers, making it easier to wear down.

Ice Shard is an effective priority move that is helpful in taking down Thundurus and Dragonite.

Additionally, if Donphan uses Rapid Spin and Chandelure switches in, Donphan is done for, seeing as Chandelure traps, outspeeds Donphan, and can OHKO it with Fire Blast.

Head Smash provides the same coverage, but it OHKOes Gengar at the cost of recoil, which hurts considering Donphan's lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p>The EVs allows Donphan to take hits, while hitting hard at the same time. Donphan shouldn't sacrifice too much of its tanking capabilities for Speed, but using 56 Speed EVs is an option to outspeed Sassy Tyranitar, who will try to KO Donphan with Ice Beam. Using 124 Speed EVs allows Donphan to outspeed standard Jellicent. Leftovers is the preferred item so Donphan remains durable enough to Rapid Spin throughout a battle, however you can opt to boost Donphan's attacking power with Life Orb or Expert Belt, provided your team has a way of healing Donphan, such as with Wish support. If you can't fit it on your team, you can use Stealth Rock on Donphan over Ice Shard.</p> <p>A lot of Donphan's usage comes from the fact that it fits easily onto sun teams. Donphan spins sways hazards for sun Pokemon that are weak to them such as Ninetales and Volcarona, while bringing a much needed resistance to Rock-type attacks to the table and eliminating troublesome Dragon-types and Landorus with Ice Shard. Donphan also benefits from the sunlight as it neutralizes its weakness to Water-type attacks, in addition to boosting its Fire Fang to the point where it's strong enough to 2HKO Gengar. Sun teams can also carry Venusaur to absorb Toxic Spikes for Donphan, which it hates. Even though this set can get past most spinblockers with the right attack, a Pursuit user such as Scizor can still prove useful to ease prediction. This Donphan will quickly fall to strong special attacks, so Blissey can be used as a partner to sponge special attacks while providing Donphan with enormous Wishes. Blissey can also cure Donphan of troublesome status ailments with Aromatherapy.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Blissey has been the premier special wall since her release in GSC. It's not difficult to see why: Blissey has an absurd amount of Special Defense, the highest HP stat in the game, and an incredible support movepool. But it's not all good news for Blissey; her Defense stat is pitiful, and her offensive stats are mediocre to say the least. To make matters worse, Eviolite makes Blissey's pre-evolution, Chansey, much bulkier than she is. However, Blissey does have some advantages over Chansey, namely a usable Special Attack stat and the ability to choose between Shed Shell and Leftovers. Unfortunately, Blissey is setup bait for many competent DW threats, such as Excadrill, Keldeo, and Chandelure. Don't let these faults deter you from using Blissey, though, as she can wall many of the threats in the DW metagame.</p> ",

Thunder Wave can replace Toxic if you want to cripple fast sweepers that switch into Blissey such as Lucario. Blissey has access to Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, but they are generally outclassed by Flamethrower because of its ability to hit the common Steel-types in DW. If using Blissey on a rain team, Thunder is a good offensive option, though. A Calm Mind set can allow Blissey to make better use of Serene Grace but would leave her outclassed by nearly every other Calm Mind user. Blissey can use Psych Up to laugh at Substitute + Calm Mind users such as Jirachi, which generally can set up all over her.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Anything with a Fighting-type STAB move, such as Breloom, Conkeldurr, or Terrakion, will hit Blissey so hard that an RBY Chansey in the Safari Zone will whimper. Swords Dance Scizor and Excadrill can set up on Blissey, as they only fear the uncommon Flamethrower. Toxic Spikes are an excellent indirect check to Blissey, as they limit her ability to stay on the battlefield for a long period of time; these can be easily set up by Roserade and Tentacruel. Trick users, such as Latios, can cripple Blissey, as she is incredibly reliant on Shed Shell to avoid the wrath of Chandelure or Leftovers to give her consistent recovery. Keldeo stands out as one of the only special attackers that can beat Blissey, as Secret Sword targets Blissey's pitiful Defense stat. Other special attackers that can overcome Blissey's defenses include Reuniclus, Growth Venusaur in the sun, and Wish + Calm Mind Jirachi. Finally, Forretress and Ferrothorn can set up hazards all over Blissey, as they only fear the rare Flamethrower.</p> ",

However, Blissey can use Soft-Boiled instead to increase her walling capabilities. Toxic is Blissey's main method of dealing damage to foes, as her offensive stats are mediocre.

Despite the addition of some formidable threats found within the Dream World metagame, Breloom proves that it is able to hang with the best thanks to its typing and ability to make full use of its superb Attack stat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Breloom doesn't have a plethora of other options available. One could potentially utilize Force Palm for its handy 30% paralysis rate, but it's almost always safer for the Choice Band set to go with Low Sweep to guarantee 2HKOs. Breloom also has access to Bulk Up and Drain Punch for some more bulky offense-oriented sets, but note that Breloom typically performs better using its excellent physical offense to devastate opponents; it often will not find time to set up. Breloom can also use its Poison Heal ability with sets such as SubPunch and Bulk Up, but those are heavily outclassed by the pure power that Technician grants. Fighting Gem is an option for some surprise OHKOs, but it is rather gimmicky and requires perfect prediction; Breloom is almost always better off with the consistent power boost of Life Orb or Choice Band.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>One of the best counters to Breloom is Xatu; it resists both of Breloom's STAB moves, and with Magic Bounce, it is immune to Spore as well. Any other checks and counters must be wary of Spore, and one might have to sacrifice a Pokemon to the sleep move before countering Breloom. Similarly, fast Psychic-types, such as Espeon, Starmie, Deoxys-S, Latios, and Latias, can serve as a check in a pinch. However, they don't have a chance of switching in to Breloom's powerful attacks; even resisted hits can leave a dent. As long as Stealth Rock is off the field, Dragonite can switch into any of Breloom's attacks except for Spore without worry; Lum Berry variants can even take one Spore. Salamence can also switch into anything but Spore and proceed to OHKO with Outrage or a Fire attack. Volcarona occasionally carries a Chesto Berry or Substitute, both of which lets it wall Breloom completely.</p> <p>The best check in the game to Breloom is Chandelure, as it traps and KOes Breloom without fear, thanks to its immunity to Mach Punch. However, it has trouble switching in if Stealth Rock is up, as four hits of Bullet Seed will leave it KOed. Zapdos can OHKO with Hidden Power Ice and resists Breloom's STAB attacks, but has the same problem as Chandelure with regard to switching in. Gengar can Disable Breloom's Bullet Seed to render it powerless.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Standard",
        "description": "<p>Breloom fortunately has all of the tools it needs in four moveslots to become one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the metagame. This Breloom has two main purposes. Firstly, it can put an opponent's Pokemon to sleep with Spore mid-game, allowing itself or a teammate to set up for a sweep. Secondly, Breloom can come in late-game and pick off weakened Pokemon with a powered-up Mach Punch. Thanks to Technician, Bullet Seed's Base Power per hit becomes a boosted 37.5; it will, on average, hit for 118.75 Base Power, making it Breloom's most powerful STAB Grass-type attack. Swords Dance gives Breloom the boost it needs to OHKO the majority of the tier after just one use.</p> <p>There are two great options for Breloom when it comes to picking an item. The first option is a Life Orb, which boosts Breloom's already fearsome Attack to even greater levels. With the 30% boost from Life Orb, Breloom gets the guaranteed OHKO on Excadrill with Mach Punch and 2HKO on threats like Genesect. Breloom is so powerful that it does not mind the recoil, as it is able to take out a good portion of the opponent's team in ten turns or less. The other option is Shed Shell, which allows Breloom to evade Chandelure, one of the greatest checks to Breloom in the tier. The lack of Life Orb recoil also keeps Breloom a bit less prone to residual damage in the DW metagame, where both entry hazards and sandstorm are prevalent.</p> <p>The EVs for Breloom are pretty simple; it always wants as much Attack as possible to maximize its sweeping capabilities. Maximum Speed allows Breloom to outrun most walls and hit them with Spore to begin setting up. A Jolly nature is a secondary option, letting Breloom outpace base 70 Speed Pokemon, such as Politoed, Cloyster, and other Breloom. With regard to other moves, Breloom can utilize Stone Edge over Swords Dance to gain more coverage, as it hits a good portion of Breloom's counters, such as Chandelure, Salamence, and Dragonite, for super effective damage. However, it is a risky option as most of these Pokemon are faster, so Breloom must predict and hit them on the switch-in.</p> <p>As Chandelure checks Breloom with relative ease, a good partner is Tyranitar, who can Pursuit Chandelure for the KO. Breloom has no problem dealing with bulky Water-types; as such, it makes a great partner to sweepers such as Excadrill and Garchomp, who have trouble getting past these Pokemon. Breloom has trouble with Dragon-, Flying-, and Psychic-types, most notably Dragonite, Garchomp, Xatu, and Salamence, meaning Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon, in particular Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Tyranitar, are solid partners defensively. Politoed can be a decent partner as well, because the rain it summons negates Breloom's weakness to Fire-type attacks from the likes of Gengar and Genesect. Stealth Rock is a great asset to Breloom as Dragonite, Salamence, Volcarona, Zapdos, Chandelure, and many others take 25% or more from hazard damage upon switching in, which limits their effectiveness as counters to Breloom; good choices to set this up include Deoxys-S and Forretress.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>This set sacrifices the luxury of switching attacks for the sheer power of a Choice Band. Right out of the gate, Breloom has access to a raw base Attack stat of 591. This, combined with the extra boost from Technician, makes Breloom a frightening force. Every move on this set is essential for coverage purposes. Mach Punch allows Breloom to bypass its lackluster Speed stat and attack first with a STAB Fighting attack that gains a Technician boost. Notably, it lets Breloom OHKO even bulky Excadrill. However, be wary of getting locked into a Fighting-type move, as this can allow an opposing Chandelure to set up and sweep your team.</p> <p>Bullet Seed is another fantastic option that has the added bonus of being able to break through an opponent's Substitute; its power after Technician is such that it allows Breloom to KO even the likes of Gengar, Thundurus, and Chandelure after Stealth Rock damage. Low Sweep is another very important move in Breloom's arsenal; it lowers the Speed of the opponent by one stage, allowing Breloom to 2HKO many switch-ins, such as Latios after a little prior damage, and Salamence after Stealth Rock damage and Intimidate. Finally, Stone Edge grants Breloom coverage against the likes of Dragonite, and to a lesser degree, Salamence.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is required on this set for maximum power; while Jolly lets Breloom outspeed base 130 Speed Pokemon that switch in on Low Sweep, the extra power is almost always preferable. The EVs listed are standard; maximum Attack and Speed serve this set perfectly. In terms of teammates for this set, Pokemon that can deal with Chandelure, such as Garchomp and bulky Water-types, make for excellent partners. Breloom also greatly appreciates hazard support, which assist it in its sweep; Deoxys-S is naturally the best option for this role.</p> "

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<p>To put it simply, Salamence is an offensive powerhouse. Boasting the second highest Attack stat of any Dragon-type in OU at base 135, Salamence can easily take out the opponent with its massively powerful STAB Outrage, both before and after a boost. Salamence is made even more threatening by the addition of Moxie, allowing its damage output to snowball to uncontrollable levels. Intimidate is another nice ability that enables Salamence to tank physical hits just a bit better, and complements its decent defensive typing and stats. Furthermore, Salamence can separate itself from its Dragon-type brethren quite easily when using Dragon Dance, thanks to a higher Speed stat, as well as the ability to go mixed, taking out Steel-types outside of rain thanks to Fire Blast backed by a base 110 Special Attack stat.</p> <p>Salamence does have a few key weaknesses, however. The most apparent of these is its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, which cripples even sets with Roost. Salamence's Speed could also just be a smidge faster; many Pokemon that outspeed it can hit it super effectively with Ice- or Dragon-type attacks. Garchomp in particular is a huge threat to Salamence, as Choice Scarf variants of Garchomp outspeed Salamence even if it has acquired a Dragon Dance boost and smash it with either Outrage or Stone Edge. Steel-types can also come in on Salamence if it's locked into Outrage and do whatever they please. However, don't let these drawbacks prevent you from using Salamence; there was a reason it was banned from DPP OU!</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There are a number of sets that Salamence can run effectively, but they are often better done by other Pokemon. A Choice Band set is workable, as it poses a massive threat to defensive teams if it acquires boosts from Moxie. However, it faces direct competition from Dragonite and Garchomp, as the former has Multiscale while the latter has a higher base Speed. Choice Specs is an interesting option for Salamence thanks to its access to powerful special attacks, especially Hydro Pump, but again, Choice Specs Latios and Hydreigon are usually better in that role. Lastly, Salamence can attempt a defensive set thanks to access to Intimidate, phazing in the form of Dragon Tail or Roar, as well as Wish, but it suffers from too many common weaknesses to work effectively. Hydro Pump is a choice on any set that requires a special attack; it can work especially well over Fire Blast if one is using rain. However, Hydro Pump can only be used with one of Moxie or Outrage if you choose to use either, which greatly limits its viability. Fire Blast is also more reliable against Steel-types such as Ferrothorn. Dragon Pulse is an option over Draco Meteor, but the drop in power is painful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Salamence's sheer versatility and power makes countering every set a difficult feat to accomplish. Intimidate variants of Salamence can all be handled nicely by Porygon2, whose Trace ability lowers Salamence's Attack by one stage. With all of Salamence's physical attacks weakened, Porygon2 can destroy it with Ice Beam. Skarmory and Bronzong can both switch in on any of Salamence's attacks except for Fire Blast; Skarmory can set up Spikes on Salamence if it's locked into Outrage, while Bronzong can nail Salamence with a super effective Hidden Power Ice. Other Steel-types make great checks as well. Metagross can come in and deal heavy damage with Bullet Punch, while Jirachi can take an Outrage and either heal back up with Wish or hit Salamence with STAB Iron Head. If rain is up, any Salamence not carrying Hydro Pump is hard-countered by Skarmory and Bronzong.</p> <p>Offensive checks are much easier to come by, as there are many Pokemon that can outspeed Salamence and KO it. Choice Scarf Ditto will beat most Salamence sets by outspeeding and KOing with a Dragon-type attack. Choice Scarf Chandelure can also come in on MixMence and KO with Shadow Ball if Salamence is sufficiently weakened. Heatran can take on any Salamence without Earthquake and KO with Hidden Power Ice. Users of Ice Shard get a special note thanks to Ice Shard's priority. Mamoswine and Weavile are the first users that come to mind, though Donphan can use Ice Shard as well, albeit a much weaker one. Finally, Choice Scarf users that have more than base 100 Speed, such as Latios and Garchomp, are great revenge killers, as they outspeed even a boosted Salamence and can KO it with their respective STAB moves.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Salamence is still the fastest relevant user of Dragon Dance in OU, and it can make use of the boosting move quite effectively thanks to STAB Outrage or Dragon Claw coming off its base 135 Attack. Earthquake is its main coverage move, hitting most Steel-types at least neutrally, bar Skarmory. Fire Blast hits all Steel-types except for Heatran, who is handled by Earthquake, and is Salamence's best way of getting past some of the most prominent Steel-types in the tier, namely Ferrothorn and Genesect. Roost, however, is also an option if you seek some sort of reliable recovery on Salamence.</p> <p>Life Orb boosts Salamence's power even further, ensuring KOs on many Pokemon that would otherwise be unobtainable, such as an OHKO on Ferrothorn with Fire Blast outside of rain, as well as an OHKO on Jirachi with Earthquake. Lum Berry, however, is an option to prevent Salamence from being crippled by status. A Naive nature is preferred to at least Speed tie with opposing base 100s; if you are using Roost over Fire Blast, use Jolly instead. Naughty and Adamant natures are options to boost Salamence's Attack even further; run Naughty with Fire Blast, and Adamant with Roost. However, Speed is often more important than power, as a neutral natured Salamence will be outsped after a Dragon Dance by Choice Scarf Genesect, then KOed with Ice Beam or Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Teammates that can weaken the opponent before Salamence comes onto the field, such as Keldeo and Latios, are recommended. Entry hazards also weaken the opponent, so teammates such as Deoxys-S are a big help as well. Pokemon who can take care of faster opponents are also great for removing troublesome opponents beforehand; Choice Scarf Garchomp and Life Orb Deoxys-S are both excellent examples. An important thing to note is that Salamence can only use Outrage and Dragon Dance on the same set if its ability is Intimidate as DW OU exits in BW1 only. Thus, if you would like to use Moxie and Dragon Dance, Dragon Claw is the most powerful physical Dragon-type move you can use.</p> <p>Yache Berry and Leftovers are both interesting items to try out on Salamence. Yache Berry lets it sponge one Ice-type attack and deal with the threat accordingly. Leftovers, however, gradually restores Salamence's HP, canceling out sandstorm damage. In terms of other moves to try on this set, Brick Break and Draco Meteor are both options in the final slot. Brick Break allows Salamence to break through Chansey and Blissey without resorting to Outrage, while Draco Meteor gives Salamence a special STAB move with which to surprise physical walls such as Gliscor and Slowbro, often allowing it to get a free Moxie boost as well.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With Moxie, Salamence can effectively spam Outrage thanks to the Attack boosts it brings after every KO, which can let Salamence sweep the opponent easily once Steel-types have been eliminated or significantly weakened. While it might be tempting to go ahead and select Outrage as soon as Salamence is out, this is rarely the best course of action. Dragon Claw has a decent amount of power after the STAB boost, while Fire Blast will easily take out most Steel-types looking to come in on Outrage; Heatran, the only Steel-type immune to Fire Blast, is easily dispatched by Earthquake. Brick Break will still hit Heatran and other Steel-types, while smashing into other Pokemon, namely Blissey and Terrakion.</p> <p>Choice Scarf allows Salamence to outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame, as well as many slower users of Choice Scarf, notably Genesect, who is roasted by Fire Blast. A Naive nature further boosts Salamence's Speed, allowing it to tie with opposing base 100s; Jolly can be used if forgoing Fire Blast, or if one doesn't mind the power drop to Fire Blast that a Jolly nature provides. Intimidate has the merit of allowing Salamence to come in on many more physical attacks, but Moxie is what makes this set so dangerous. Draco Meteor is an option over one of the other moves, giving physical walls expecting Outrage quite a surprise. For example, Salamence 2HKOes Gliscor with Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock damage, allowing it to come in later and wreck the opposing team once they lack a physical wall to contain Salamence.</p> <p>Salamence has a hard time getting through teams by itself, so powerful wallbreakers are very useful in this regard. Keldeo stands out as an excellent partner, being able to smash through the opposition with a powerful Hydro Pump under rain. Secret Sword lets Keldeo obliterate opposing Steel-types as well, allowing Salamence to spam Outrage much more easily. On that note, Pokemon that can trap Steel-types and generally bulky foes also make great teammates. Magnezone is great for removing Steel-types, while Chandelure can be used to trap more Pokemon, such as Latios and Breloom, if your team needs that support.</p> "

Fire Blast is an interesting move in the second slot, as it allows Salamence to take care of Steel-types before using Draco Meteor. In the third slot, Earthquake provides coverage on Heatran and Chandelure while Brick Break hits all Steel-types and does super effective damage to Chansey and Blissey, who otherwise wall Salamence. In the final slot, Outrage gives Salamence an effective STAB move to use once Draco Meteor is spent; it is still incredibly powerful even without full investment. Roost is also an option that allows Salamence to recover health lost to Life Orb recoil, increasing its longevity.</p> <p>The given EV spread gives Salamence fairly even attacking power between its offenses, while 176 Speed EVs let it outspeed neutral base 90s with Speed investment. A Rash nature is preferred to give Salamence a boost to Draco Meteor while keeping its physical attacks powerful. A Naive nature can also be considered, but the drop in power is discouraging. On that note, one can also fully invest in Speed to beat Life Orb Genesect. However, as Choice Scarf variants are far more common, full Speed investment will be in vain quite a bit of the time. Regarding items, Life Orb is the preferred choice to further increase Salamence's power. Both Intimidate and Moxie can be used on this set; Intimidate allows Salamence to come in on physical attackers such as Breloom, while Moxie enables Salamence to go to town with Outrage after it KOes one opponent. However, Intimidate is more reliable in most situations.</p> <p>Recommended teammates are ones that can take advantage of the gaping holes Salamence can create. Swords Dance Breloom, for example, appreciates the removal of Gliscor and other physical walls, such as Skarmory. Rapid Spin support is also essential to this set, especially if it lacks Roost, as Stealth Rock damage and Life Orb recoil will quickly pile up otherwise. Forretress in particular can provide both Rapid Spin and entry hazard support; Stealth Rock and Spikes greatly help Salamence break through the opposition.</p> "

In the DW metagame, it retains its lethal status, but due to the presence of common threats such as Choice Scarf Genesect and Choice Scarf Shadow Tag Chandelure, Latios finds itself hard-pressed to compete with its Dragon-type brethren, most notably Garchomp and Dragonite. However, Latios does have some perks over its brethren. Although its secondary Psychic typing might seem like a thorn in Latios's side due to its susceptibility to Pursuit as well as its weaknesses to Bug- and Ghost-type moves, it lets Latios easily revenge kill one of the most common and dangerous threats in the DW metagame: Keldeo. In addition, Latios has the highest Special Attack of any Dragon-type in the metagame, which allows it to pose a significant threat to common walls, such as Forretress and Skarmory. Psyshock allows it to break through not only Keldeo, but also Blissey and Chansey, something that other special attackers have difficulty doing. Despite Latios's more obvious flaws in the DW metagame, it is still a potent threat that many teams can be unprepared for.</p> ",

Expert Belt is an option to feign a Choice item, although the power output is rather mediocre unless the move hits the target super effectively. Although Latios is usually better off running an offensive set of some sort, it does have access to Light Screen and Reflect, as well as a fast Memento, which makes Latios a formidable and reliable dual screener. Otherwise, there aren't any \"viable\" options, as Dragon Dance is somewhat pointless on a special attacker with only a base 90 Attack stat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Latios is most susceptible to Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Scizor and to Shadow Tag Chandelure. Its Defense is average at best, and pounding it repeatedly with powerful physical attacks can wear it down quickly, especially if they are super effective. Latios is one of the fastest Dragon-types in the metagame, tying only with its sister, Latias, meaning that other Dragon-types are forced to equip a Choice Scarf if they want any hope of beating Latios. Excadrill in the sand can outspeed and OHKO with a +2 Return or X-Scissor, but it cannot switch into Surf or Hidden Power Fire and cannot OHKO without a Swords Dance boost. Choice Scarf Genesect is a decent check, as it can outspeed Latios unless it carries a Choice Scarf of its own and easily OHKO with a Download-boosted U-turn. Ferrothorn can easily take any attack that Latios can throw at it bar a Hidden Power Fire and either paralyze it with Thunder Wave or wear it down with Gyro Ball and Leech Seed.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is Latios's best set; it hits hard yet still has the ability to switch moves. Draco Meteor is insanely powerful, obliterating anything that doesn't resist it with the exception of Blissey and Chansey. Even some Steel-types can be 2HKOed. If the Special Attack-lowering side effect is a turnoff, Latios can use Dragon Pulse over Draco Meteor, although the drop in power is quite noticeable. Surf is an excellent complementary move to Dragon Pulse or Draco Meteor, as it provides great coverage and hits threats such as Tyranitar for super effective damage. Latios can also take advantage of rain to pound the opponent with a boosted Surf. In the third moveslot, either Psyshock or Hidden Power Fire is a viable option. Psyshock is the preferred move, given the ubiquity of Keldeo in the DW metagame, as it allows Latios to OHKO Keldeo regardless of how many Calm Mind boosts it has obtained. Hidden Power Fire allows Latios to OHKO Genesect, Ferrothorn, and Forretress, though it doesn't really do much else and lowers Latios's Speed IV. Recover is used in the last slot in order to stave off some of the recoil damage from Life Orb, and it is a very useful move in general.</p> <p>The given EV spread, along with a Timid nature, allows Latios to hit hard and outspeed as much as possible. Equipping Latios with a Life Orb grants it a much-appreciated power boost that still allows it to switch moves. Latios can easily switch into rain-boosted Water-type moves and heal off the damage, which makes Recover one of the most important moves on this set. Although the listed moves are the most efficient in terms of power and coverage, Latios can easily run Thunderbolt (or Thunder if on a rain team) in order to deal with bulky Water-types or Hidden Power Fighting to reliably 2HKO Tyranitar.</p> <p>Politoed is a great teammate to bring permanent rain to the table, as it boosts the power of Surf with Drizzle and can easily tank any Ice-type attacks aimed at Latios. In return, Latios is a near-perfect check to Technician Breloom once Sleep Clause is active, as it outspeeds and resists both of its STAB moves. If you choose to utilize Hidden Power Fire, then sun support from Ninetales can prove useful. In this case, replacing Surf with Hidden Power Fire is recommended so that Latios can still deal with Keldeo by using Psyshock. Latios needs to have faster threats such as Choice Scarf Genesect removed before it can attempt to tear through the opponent's team; however, once they are eliminated, Latios has free reign to raze through the opponent like a field of grain.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Latios is an extremely potent threat. It can use either Choice Specs or a Choice Scarf very effectively; with the former, it can smash most of the metagame to pieces with its STAB, Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor, and with the latter, it outspeeds virtually every other common Choice Scarf user, including Garchomp and Genesect. Draco Meteor is Latios's most powerful move, decimating anything that doesn't resist it and even 2HKOing some Pokemon that do. Surf is a great secondary move, as it provides useful coverage. Hidden Power Fire completes that coverage by conveniently roasting Genesect and Ferrothorn should they try to come in and wall Draco Meteor, although it does come with a lowered Speed IV. If Genesect and Ferrothorn are not a problem, then Dragon Pulse can be used in place of Hidden Power Fire for a reliable STAB move that doesn't lower Latios's Special Attack. The last move is simply dependent on what your team needs covered. If your team has trouble with Keldeo, then Psyshock is the way to go, as it OHKOes even through Calm Mind boosts. However, Trick is a great move to cripple Pokemon such as Chansey and Ferrothorn that think they can switch in for free.</p> <p>Latios needs the Speed and Special Attack investment in order to outspeed as many Pokemon and deal as much damage as possible. Choice Scarf Latios makes for a very effective lure, as it can outspeed common Choice Scarf users such as Chandelure and Genesect and OHKO them with the appropriate move. The choice between equipping a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs depends on the role you want Latios to play. A Choice Scarf allows Latios to outspeed even Deoxys-S and further allows it to revenge kill with ease. Choice Specs, on the other hand, transforms Latios into an immensely powerful wallbreaker, as almost nothing can stand up to its STAB Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Because Choice variants of Latios are so susceptible to Pursuit-trapping, it is recommended to remove trappers such as Tyranitar before bringing Latios into play. Keldeo is a fantastic teammate that can easily deal with Tyranitar, as its STAB Fighting- and Water-type attacks will destroy Tyranitar before it has a chance to do anything. Keldeo also resists Bug- and Ice-type attacks, giving it decent synergy with Latios; in return, Latios resists the Psychic-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks aimed at Keldeo. Together the pair resists the VoltTurn strategy. Genesect can also threaten Tyranitar with its STAB U-turn, forcing it out and wearing it down with entry hazard support.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Latios has access to a great boosting move in Calm Mind. Although this set is rarely seen and somewhat less effective in the DW metagame, it can be devastating if allowed to set up. After one Calm Mind, Latios has 538 Special Attack, and with its excellent type coverage in just two or three moves, it can easily sweep mid- to late-game. Dragon Pulse is the STAB move of choice; it is reliable, decently powerful, and has great neutral coverage. Surf complements Dragon Pulse nicely and hits threats such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and several others for super effective damage. The last moveslot can vary depending on your team's needs. Psyshock is a foolproof way of dealing with any variant of Keldeo, Hidden Power Fire deals with pesky Genesect and Ferrothorn, while Recover allows Latios to heal off any damage taken, including Life Orb recoil, and gives it a much easier time setting up and more staying power. However, it is important to note that Hidden Power Fire lowers Latios's Speed IV, making it impossible to Speed tie with other base 110s, such as Gengar, Latias, and opposing Latios.</p> <p>Because Latios is primarily an offensively oriented Pokemon, maximum Speed and Special Attack investment is standard. The listed attacks provide the best coverage, but Substitute can work over one of the coverage moves to block problematic status such as paralysis and poison, as well as provide a buffer against priority and Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar. Latios can use Draco Meteor over Dragon Pulse for more immediate power, but the consequent Special Attack drop is rather unwanted. Grass Knot, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Fighting are also decent coverage moves that Latios has access to, but they don't necessarily provide \"better\" coverage, just specific super effective coverage on certain threats such as Gastrodon, Tyranitar, and Politoed. It is generally quite difficult to sweep with Calm Mind Latios early-game due to the sheer amount of threats that can easily take it down, such as Choice Scarf Genesect, Tyranitar, and Choice Scarf Chandelure. For this reason, it is best to use Latios mid- to late-game, when most, if not all, of Latios's major checks are removed. Teammates such as Keldeo that can rid Latios of its checks are very useful and can pave the way for a Latios sweep. A paired Chandelure can also be used to dispose of opposing Choice Scarf users such as Genesect.</p> "

With base 95 offensive stats, base 90 defensive stats, and an expansive movepool including Stealth Rock, Spikes, and every good special move, there isn't much else you could ask for in a (more) twisted DNA entity. Except maybe the gene for five moveslots.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Deoxys-S has a veritable plethora of moves, and many combinations are viable (though this can stretch Deoxys-S's full potential thin). Moves on each set are interchangeable: an attacking hazards set or dual screen attacker are both viable, for example. One notable variant is a set of Psycho Boost / Superpower / Fire Punch / Stealth Rock with 216 Atk / 40 SpA / 252 Spe, a Naive nature, and Life Orb, allowing Deoxys-S to take down Genesect, Tyranitar, and Chandelure (after Stealth Rock) and setting up your own Stealth Rock in a free moment. Deoxys-S can also pull off Choice sets, particularly Choice Scarf for its ability to outspeed Excadrill in sand, but locking Deoxys-S into one move squanders its full capability (though Trick mitigates this slightly). In terms of movepool, Deoxys-S has access to Shadow Ball for hitting other Deoxys-S, Thunderbolt for an accurate hit on Pokemon such as Keldeo, and Extreme Speed as a form of priority.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Deoxys-S is hard to catch, and hence hard to check. Luckily, its offenses are not too deadly, and figuring out its moveset eases its elimination. An attacking variant can be walled by a Pokemon that can hide in the gap of Deoxys-S's movepool, and can be played around until Deoxys-S's stats are depleted from Superpower and Psycho Boost. The hazard set can't really KO many Pokemon, so you can counter it by throwing strong hits at it. Ditto is an interesting check because the opponent can immediately determine Deoxys-S's movepool and react appropriately. Furthermore, as Ditto generally carries Choice Scarf, it will normally be faster. Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed deals heavy damage, and Choice Scarf users faster than Garchomp, such as Terrakion, can hurt Deoxys-S as well.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With decent bulk and blazing Speed, Deoxys-S is a great Pokemon to set entry hazards. It can layer Spikes immediately, using the HP investment to survive weak attacks. Stealth Rock is another great move, providing residual damage on all opponents. Taunt is the best move in the third slot, since with Deoxys-S's Speed, it can stop other leading Pokemon from setting up their hazards or throwing status around. It also prevents opposing sweepers from setting up on Deoxys-S while it sets up hazards. The last slot is reserved for an attacking move. Superpower has a chance at OHKOing 252 HP Tyranitar. However, Fire Punch is a viable option to maim Genesect, though 160 Attack EVs are required to always OHKO. Lastly, you can consider Psycho Boost, which hits Pokemon such as Chandelure and Rotom-W hard on the initial hit.</p> <p>The EVs are to attain the greatest overall bulk. Speed is maximized so Deoxys-S can set up before all but Prankster Taunt users. The rest is dumped into HP, allowing Deoxys-S to survive a U-turn from Genesect amongst other weaker, super effective jabs. A Jolly or Timid nature depends on the attacking move used. Life Orb is an option over Focus Sash, since with the former Deoxys-S can OHKO Tyranitar and Genesect with only 12 Attack EVs. However, this decreases Deoxys-S's survivability and doesn't ensure at least one layer of hazards. Magic Coat is an option on this set, with or in place of Taunt. It is useful for reflecting opposing hazards or status, sometimes forcing a switch. However, it is prediction heavy, which causes a lot of pressure during the early turns of the match.</p> <p>Virtually every Dream World team benefits from hazards due to the offensive nature of the metagame. For example, +2 Breloom can 2HKO Dragonite after Stealth Rock, and has a small chance at OHKOing Thundurus! Genesect is a good partner to this set as well, capitalizing on the switches forced by U-turn. Offensive rain and sun teams also appreciate Deoxys-S for not only hazards but also the possible KO on Tyranitar.</p> "

        "name": "Attacker",
        "description": "<p>While 95 base offenses may not seem like much, Deoxys-S has all it needs to be one of the most annoying attackers around. Psycho Boost is its powerful STAB move, OHKOing Pokemon such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Chandelure. Superpower provides good coverage alongside Deoxys-S's Psychic STAB, isn't affected by the Special Attack drop, and OHKOes 252 HP Tyranitar, all while denting other threats such as Heatran. Ice Beam is the best option for the third slot, OHKOing Breloom without forcing the Special Attack drop of Psycho Boost. It also OHKOes Garchomp, Gliscor, and Dragonite with its Multiscale broken. Hidden Power Fire is the best option in the final slot, OHKOing Choice Scarf Genesect before it can U-turn. Luckily, the loss of a Speed IV for Hidden Power Fire is not a big deal, since all the Choice Scarf users Deoxys-S is able to outspeed sit at 500 or below.</p> <p>Shadow Ball is an option if you're worried about Psychic-types, particularly opposing Deoxys-S. Thunderbolt helps against Water-types such as Gyarados and Politoed, but note that a neutral Psycho Boost is stronger than a 2x effective Thunderbolt. The EVs serve a special purpose. With a Life Orb and 12 Attack EVs, Superpower will always OHKO 252 HP Tyranitar. Deoxys-S also does not lose any KOes with the slightly lower Special Attack stat, so the little investment is worth it. A Naive nature ensures Deoxys-S's special and physical attacks hit as hard as possible and give it a maximum of 504 Speed, outpacing positive-natured Choice Scarf Garchomp and all slower Pokemon. Naive is chosen over Hasty because, in general, more physical attacks are directed at Deoxys-S; an example is Chople Berry Tyranitar's Crunch. ​ Deoxys-S can fit well on any offensive team, surprising a few of the most common Pokemon early in the match or cleaning a weakened team later in the match. Entry hazards obviously ease this process, and although this variant is an attacker, it can force switches. Thus, Spikes or Stealth Rock can find itself on the moveset, replacing an unnecessary coverage move. Deoxys-S's main problem is that its two main moves lower its stats; therefore, walls such as Chansey and Blissey have the potential to stall it out. Strong physical attackers such as Breloom are a good choice to take these blobs out. Wallbreakers in general are good partners as well, since Deoxys-S only has base 95 offenses to work with.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Deoxys-S doesn't have self-eliminating moves such as Memento, its great Speed makes it an excellent dual screen user. As such, Reflect and Light Screen are the main moves. When leading, a discerning player can choose Reflect or Light Screen depending on the predicted attack and survive more hits. From there, Deoxys-S can set up the other screen and even Stealth Rock or a few layers of Spikes. In the case that the opponent tries to set up, Deoxys-S can use Taunt to stop it cold. However, Magic Coat is an option to bounce back an opponent's entry hazard or the rare Prankster Taunt. The last slot is a toss up between Stealth Rock and Spikes. The former is a great universal form of entry hazards, its ubiquity limiting the potential of many threats such as Dragonite and Chandelure. However, Deoxys-S can take advantage of the stackability of Spikes and put pressure on the opponent when considering switching.</p> <p>Because this variant generally doesn't attack, maximum HP is the best choice, allowing Deoxys-S to survive even more hits after putting up screens. To prolong the protection for the team, Light Clay is the optimal item. However, Leftovers extends the survivability of Deoxys-S itself, possibly giving it the chance to come back later in the match. ​ Offensive teams benefit the most from Deoxys-S's support. Baton Pass chains, and SmashPass in particular, relish the increased bulk. Gorebyss, with its already decent defenses, can pass to deadly receivers such as Garchomp (which itself is bulky) with relative safety. Other offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo and Breloom, which are rather prone to revenge killing, can survive an attack and eliminate the offender. Prankster Taunt, albeit rare, is still an issue, so leading with an attacker is the best bet for ensuring Deoxys-S's success.</p> "

  "Ambipom": {
    "overview": "<p>While most priority users do outclass it, Ambipom has a few tricks that make it perfectly viable in DW, namely its Technician ability and its huge movepool. Technician is a godsend for Ambipom, whose array of weak moves receive a power boost. Fake Out, one of Ambipom's most commonly used moves, now has an enormous 90 Base Power instead of 40 after taking into account the STAB and Technician boosts. Fake Out also has +3 priority, making it one of the fastest moves. Furthermore, Ambipom has an adequate base 100 Attack stat and a superb base 115 Speed. Despite its lackluster Normal typing, Ambipom also gets access to uncommon and useful moves in U-turn, Pursuit, Low Kick, and Low Sweep.</p> <p>On the other hand, Ambipom's stats, typing, and overall utility is disappointing. Its excellent Attack and Speed stats are let down by its base 60 Special Attack stat, which makes going mixed unfeasible. Ambipom also has horrible 75 / 66 / 66 defenses, making tanking most any attack difficult. In addition, Ambipom's bland Normal typing gives it a lack of resistances and STAB coverage that leaves much to be desired. As a priority user, Ambipom is greatly outclassed by the likes of Scizor, Dragonite, Lucario, and Breloom, all of whom have better priority moves, typing, or stats. On top of that, Ambipom has few viable options, making it extremely predictable. All in all, while Ambipom is outclassed by many Pokemon, its unique qualities do give it a niche.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ambipom has an enormous movepool, so there are several other options one could use. A set comprising of only Fake Out and Last Resort is a strategy worth mentioning, but Ghost-types laugh at it, and bulky Rock- and Steel-types also wall it easily. Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and ThunderPunch can be used to hit key targets such as Ferrothorn, Gliscor, and Gyarados respectively. Knock Off is a useful move for figuring out an opponent's moveset, but it is too weak to be used effectively. Seed Bomb is an option to hit Gastrodon and Quagsire super effectively, but as they aren't very common, it is often a waste of a vital moveslot. Additionally, Ambipom can always U-turn to an appropriate counter to deal with them. Ambipom could run a decent SubPunch set, but it would be immensely outclassed by the likes of Conkledurr and Toxicroak in such a role, as it lacks the bulk to use it well. A specially attacking set with Nasty Plot, Swift, Thunderbolt, and Water Pulse is possible, but Thundurus and Togekiss are more effective at utilizing this. Ambipom can Baton Pass Nasty Plot and Agility boosts, but again, it is hopelessly outclassed by SmashPass Smeargle and Gorebyss. Finally, Ambipom has access to Switcheroo, which makes a Choice Band or Choice Scarf set viable, but TrickScarf Cresselia and other Psychic-types are usually better suited for such a role.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ghost-types present Ambipom with its biggest struggles. Gengar, Jellicent, and Chandelure are all immune to Fake Out, Return, Low Kick, and Low Sweep, and resist U-turn. Although Ambipom is immune to Ghost-type moves, due to its frailty, it is threatened by all their coverage moves. These Ghost-types do have to be wary of Pursuit though, as Ambipom outspeeds them all if they don't carry a Choice Scarf. Skarmory is an excellent counter as well, as Ambipom doesn't have a single super effective attack on Skarmory. In general, Steel-types that are neutral to Fighting, such as Bronzong, Jirachi, and Metagross, are decent counters because Ambipom lacks the sheer power to get around them.</p> <p>Blaziken cannot be revenge killed by Ambipom, as it can use Protect to block Fake Out, and after a Speed boost, it outruns Ambipom and easily KOes it. Pokemon that are faster than Ambipom and resist Fake Out are also problematic; examples include Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, Chandelure, Jirachi, Magnezone, among others. In fact, Ambipom is extremely frail, so any faster Pokemon checks it well. Alakazam, Jolteon, Dugtrio, and Excadrill in sand all outspeed Ambipom and can KO it with their powerful STAB attacks. Priority users also rain on Ambipom's parade, making Pokemon such as Scizor, Breloom, Dragonite, and Lucario useful in countering Ambipom.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is Ambipom's most commonly used set, and for good reason. Ambipom has the perfect qualities for a physical attacker, specifically its great movepool, its adequate Attack stat, and its Technician ability. STAB Fake Out is an incredible move, which does massive damage if unresisted, and due to its flinch rate, is essentially free damage for Ambipom. Fake Out is great for revenge killing weakened sweepers, and if it doesn't KO them, the flinch will allow Ambipom to safely use U-turn or just switch to use Fake Out again later. Also, Ambipom does 48.6% - 57.8% to uninvested Breloom. U-turn is a fantastic move in general as it allows Ambipom to scout and switch out of the battle without losing momentum, letting it use Fake Out many times throughout a match. However, Return can be used if one desires a good STAB move.</p> <p>The choice between Low Kick and Low Sweep depends on whether one wants to hit heavier Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Snorlax harder, or if one wants consistent power and the ability to lower the foe's Speed. It should be noted that Low Kick has 10 more Base Power against Ferrothorn, which makes all the difference between a 3HKO and a possible 2HKO. Other than that, though, Low Kick and Low Sweep hit Chansey and Blissey for the same amount of damage, while Pokemon such as Terrakion and Hydreigon will be 2HKOed by either move. In addition to being Ambipom's strongest option against Ghost-types, Pursuit allows Ambipom to trap fleeing Ghost-types who might switch in to absorb Fake Out, while also acting as Ambipom's best move against them. It also gets a Technician boost if the opponent doesn't switch. In particular, Pursuit lets Ambipom trap Choice Scarf or Choice Specs Chandelure locked into Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p>Ambipom could run a few other items instead of Life Orb, but the power Life Orb offers brings is usually preferred. Silk Scarf is an option to boost Fake Out and Return without any loss of HP, but the inability to boost all of Ambipom's moves is a huge drawback, as without Life Orb, Ambipom loses the ability to OHKO Gengar after Stealth Rock. In terms of alternative moves, Double Hit can always be used over Return if power and the ability to break through Substitute is more important than accuracy. Payback is an option over Pursuit if one wants more power, but the ability to trap the likes of Gengar and Chandelure is usually more important. Ambipom can also use Aerial Ace to hit Bug- and Grass-type Pokemon, as it gets a Technician boost, but the lack of coverage it provides is unappealing. Taunt is useable, as it completely shuts down Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and other walls, but Ambipom already has four-moveslot syndrome anyway.</p> <p>Ambipom appreciates entry hazard and Rapid Spin support, as it will constantly force switches as well as switching in and out itself. Entry hazards also help it nab KOs on Pokemon such as Heatran, Terrakion, and Hydreigon. Forretress is a great partner, as it provides Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes to put pressure on the opponent, as well as Rapid Spin so that Ambipom can switch in more easily. Starmie is a good partner too because of its access to Rapid Spin and good Special Attack, with which it can break through Skarmory and Forretress, common physical walls that Ambipom struggles with. Tentacruel is another Pokemon who can supply both hazards and Rapid Spin support. It also resists Fighting-type moves, Ambipom's only weakness.</p> "

Earthquake is useful to hit Excadrill, while Hidden Power Ice eliminates Dragon-types, Breloom, and Gliscor.

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>Garchomp is arguably the best Dragon-type available in Dream World OU; its only drawbacks are a lack of Dragon Dance and ability to go mixed. Its STAB coverage is absolutely superb: not only does it get neutral coverage on all but a handful of Pokemon, but Garchomp also has powerful STAB moves and a high Attack stat to back it up. All of Garchomp's stats, sans Special Attack, are great. Its Speed tier isn't the highest, but it's still quite good, and allows Garchomp to occupy a relatively high Speed tier amongst Choice Scarf users when it dons said item. Garchomp's bulk, Speed, offenses, and neutrality to Stealth Rock all make it a terrifying sweeper to face. It is especially threatening when used on sand teams, as sand allows Garchomp to utilize its trademark ability: Sand Veil. Garchomp does have its issues, such as being outsped by a good portion of the offensive metagame and having a 4x weakness to Ice-type moves, but Garchomp is still a superb Pokemon, and it isn't difficult to see why it was banned from OU in DPP.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Garchomp can use Stealth Rock efficiently, and can provide an Electric-type immunity in its supporting role. It faces competition from Mamoswine, however. Garchomp's Special Attack is lackluster, but it can take advantage of this fact by using moves such as Draco Meteor with Special Attack investment for the element of surprise, possibly maiming physical walls such as Gliscor and Skarmory. Dragon Tail can be used to phaze out opponents and rack up entry hazard damage, but the negative priority does Garchomp a bit of a disservice considering its good Speed. A Haban Berry can be used to mitigate Garchomp's weakness to less powerful Dragon-type attacks, but it won't help against strong attacks such as Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage or Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor. Garchomp also makes for a fine Shell Smash receiver, as it can dismantles teams with the combination of boosts. In this case a Lum Berry or White Herb make for decent item choices.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Skarmory is the number one counter to Garchomp, as it takes little from most of Garchomp's attacks, can lay down Spikes, Roost off the damage, and then Whirlwind Garchomp away. Similarly, Bronzong isn't bothered by most of Garchomp's attacks, and can smack it around with Gyro Ball or Hidden Power Ice. Gliscor can handle less offensive versions of Garchomp, but needs to be wary of powerful Outrages. Choice Scarf Chandelure can revenge kill non-Choice Scarf Garchomp who don't have Yache Berry with Hidden Power Ice; Garchomp is unable to escape due to Shadow Tag and is thus dependent on teammates such as Tyranitar to dispose of Chandelure beforehand.</p> <p>Powerful Ice-type attacks can take Garchomp down, as can a decently powerful Ice Shard from the likes of Mamoswine and Weavile. Cloyster is also very good at handling Garchomp, and is even able to break its Substitute and proceed to OHKO Garchomp with Icicle Spear. Generally, Pokemon that can outspeed Garchomp and smack it with a powerful move can get the job done; examples include Latios with Draco Meteor, Choice Scarf Salamence with Outrage, and Thundurus with Hidden Power Ice. Priority also helps in this regard; Mach Punch Breloom, Bullet Punch Scizor, and Extreme Speed Dragonite can all pick off a weakened Garchomp, though they must be wary of a partnered Chandelure.</p> ",

        "name": "Substitute + Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Garchomp's bulk allows it to perform the role of an offensive tank quite well. After a Swords Dance Garchomp becomes quite dangerous. Substitute blocks status, and, if sand is up, can be utilized to fish for a miss from Sand Veil against slower foes. Earthquake is Garchomp's primary STAB move, and a powerful one at that, while Dragon Claw provides coverage on Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate. Dragon Tail is another option, allowing Garchomp to prevent most phazers from forcing it out, but the move is far more reliant on entry hazard damage than Dragon Claw is.</p> <p>Maximum HP investment increases Garchomp's bulk, and as a bonus makes Garchomp's Substitutes unbreakable by Night Shade or Seismic Toss. A Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment are necessary to outspeed threats in the base 100 Speed range such as Manaphy. The Speed investment also allows Garchomp to set up a Substitute first against a larger group of opponents, allowing it to fish for a Sand Veil miss if necessary. Leftovers provide Garchomp with some staying power, and grants Garchomp an extra Substitute after four turns of recovery, which just might give it the Sand Veil miss it needs. Outrage is another possible Dragon-type STAB move due to its power, but comes at the cost of locking Garchomp into the move, which can prove hazardous, and the confusion can interfere with Garchomp's attempts to stick around. Garchomp can also opt to use a more offensive spread and a Salac Berry, which makes it a dangerous lategame sweeper.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes set by the opponent give Garchomp some issues, so Pokemon who can Rapid Spin them away, such as Forretress, or absorb them, such as Toxicroak, are appreciated. Garchomp itself appreciates Toxic Spikes, so once again Forretress is valuable as a teammate, as is Tentacruel. Tyranitar is also a valuable teammate, as it summons sand and can Pursuit-trap Choice Scarf Chandelure, who can otherwise revenge kill Garchomp with Hidden Power Ice, provided it doesn't miss. Chandelure itself can also be a helpful teammates, trapping and elminating walls such as Skarmory, Bronzong, and Gliscor. However, the likes of Skarmory often run Shed Shell to escape Chandelure's grip, and might therefore need to be caught off guard and weakened or KOed by a teammate. Mixed Dragon-types, such as Salamence, are useful in this regard.</p> "

        "name": "Choice",
        "description": "<p>Garchomp is quite suited to the roles of both a revenge killer and a hit-and-run juggernaut. Its high Speed allows it to outpace most other Choice Scarf users, and its STAB moves are both powerful and provide excellent coverage, making cleaning up weakened teams quite easy. Meanwhile, with a Choice Band equipped, Garchomp becomes a powerful wallbreaker, OHKOing many offensive Pokemon with its STAB moves and 2HKOing a good portion of walls and bulky Pokemon. Due to its resistance to Stealth Rock, Garchomp is quite capable of switching in multiple times to throw out devastating attacks.</p> <p>Both Choice variants rely on Outrage and Earthquake for their exceptional power and coverage. Choice Scarf Garchomp will often wish to use Fire Blast, as it nabs a 2HKO on physically defensive Skarmory, guaranteed with sun support. Choice Band Garchomp, on the other hand, prefers Fire Fang due to Choice Band's Attack boost. Fire Blast is still a viable option for Choice Band Garchomp, however. Garchomp can also opt to run Aqua Tail with rain support, allowing it to smash pesky Gliscor, as well as Air Balloon Excadrill and Air Balloon Heatran. Dual Chop helps against Substitute users and Pokemon with Focus Sash, and does not have Outrage's locking effect, making it a useful auxiliary STAB move. Dragon Claw is also viable for this reason, and, unlike Dual Chop, has perfect accuracy.</p> <p>The choice between Choice items (get it?) depends on Garchomp's intended role. A team searching for a fast Choice Scarf user, whether as a revenge killer or a cleaner, is of course better suited to Choice Scarf Garchomp, but a team looking for a wallbreaker will prefer Choice Band Garchomp. There are, of course, pros and cons to each item. Choice Band Garchomp is vulnerable to Choice Scarf Chandelure, who can easily OHKO it with Hidden Power Ice. This is rarely an issue for Choice Scarf Garchomp, who outspeeds Chandelure and threatens it with its STAB moves, only fearing being caught while locked into a non-STAB move. On the other hand, Choice Scarf Garchomp does not have the raw power Choice Band Garchomp has, and is therefore very dependent on entry hazard support, which is something that Choice Band Garchomp can make do without if necessary.</p> <p>Stone Edge is worth consideration for the last moveslot for Choice Scarf Garchomp, as it allows it to have a better shot at revenge killing Thundurus, Tornadus, and Volcarona. As far as teammate support goes, Tyranitar is one of the best options, providing the sand necessary for Sand Veil to activate. Tyranitar can additionally provide Stealth Rock and trap Chandelure with Pursuit; it can otherwise be problematic for Choice Band Garchomp. Ninetales is also helpful as a supporting Pokemon, as some of the few Pokemon who aren't overly troubled by Garchomp's STAB combination, namely Skarmory and Bronzong, do not at all enjoy taking sun-boosted Fire-type attacks. Similarly, rain support from Politoed allows Aqua Tail Garchomp to pose far more of a threat to Gliscor. Both variants, but especially Choice Scarf Garchomp, struggle to break Skarmory, so mixed attacking Dragon-types, such as Salamence, can help to put pressure on it. Excadrill is also a good offensive partner for Choice Band Garchomp, as Garchomp can soften up some of the Pokemon who can wall Excadrill, making it easier for Excadrill to sweep.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Offensive Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>It is very easy to overlook Garchomp's raw damage output potential due to its utility, bulk, and typing, but it is capable of being an incredibly threatening wallbreaker. After a Swords Dance boost there is very little that can safely take a hit from Garchomp. As an example, a +2 Life Orb-boosted Outrage from Garchomp is nearly a guaranteed OHKO on 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Gliscor after Stealth Rock. Earthquake is almost as powerful, and does not have the drawback of locking Garchomp into a move, and can OHKO many offensive Pokemon at +2 Attack. Fire Fang and Aqua Tail provide coverage against Steel-types who are immune to Earthquake, such as Skarmory, Bronzong, and Air Balloon Excadrill. Aqua Tail is best used on rain teams, while Fire Fang works even more effectively with sun support.</p> <p>A slightly less offensive approach can be taken with this set. A Yache Berry ensures that Garchomp can survive an Ice Beam or Hidden Power Ice in most situations, while a Lum Berry blocks troublesome status, most notably poison from Toxic Spikes. It also negate the confusion induced at the end of an Outrage. Dragon Claw is considerable as a Dragon-type STAB move if Garchomp is not holding a Life Orb, though part of the appeal of Lum Berry is its ability to block Outrage confusion. Dual Chop is an option for breaking Focus Sash and Substitute, but the lack of power and the imperfect accuracy are unfortunate.</p> <p>Sand Veil can be a devastating ability, so Tyranitar is one of the first Pokemon to consider as a teammate. In terms of weather inducers, Ninetales is also helpful for its ability to pump up Fire Fang, while Politoed is preferable if Aqua Tail is being used. Faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users trouble this set considerably, so Wobbuffet and Choice Scarf Chandelure can be used to eliminate them and make life much easier for Garchomp. Choice Scarf Ditto in particular is a serious threat, stealing Garchomp's boosts and potentially going to town on the rest of the team. Having an answer to this scenario, such as Mamoswine or Skarmory, is vital. Mixed Dragon-types are extremely beneficial, as they put pressure on the opponent's Steel-types, potentially setting up a Garchomp sweep. Excadrill loves having Gliscor out of commission, and has Rapid Spin to prevent Toxic Spikes from hindering Garchomp. Wish support helps Garchomp stay alive and kicking for as long as possible, so consider teammates such as Blissey and Jirachi.</p> "

  "Weavile": {
    "overview": "<p>Weavile has two valuable attacks in Pursuit and Ice Shard, which allow it to fulfill specific roles on a team. Weavile is also blisteringly fast and has a decent level of power, but is let down by its frailty, weak STAB moves, and weakness to entry hazards. While Weavile is flawed, it fits into its niche in Dream World almost perfectly. With STAB Ice Shard Weavile can revenge kill dangerous Dragon-type sweepers such as Dragonite, Salamence, and Choice Scarf Garchomp. STAB Pursuit also allows Weavile to pick off dangerous Pokemon who are vulnerable to the move; most prominently Choice Scarf Chandelure locked into any non-Fire-type move, as well as Latios and Starmie. Weavile struggles to do much outside of this role due to the lack of a powerful STAB move, but its unique combination of niches allows it to compensate for this.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Weavile can boost its strength with Swords Dance, but it has difficulty setting up and is often not strong enough to muscle through physical walls. Substitute can be used to take advantage of forced switches, but exacerbates Weavile's issues with passive damage. It does have merit in conjunction with Focus Punch, however. Taunt, Torment, and Snatch can all be used to disrupt walls, sometimes forcing them to flee; a situation Weavile can take advantage of with Pursuit. Knock Off robs the opponent of their item. A Focus Sash can be used with Counter in order to gain a surprise OHKO on some physical sweepers who would otherwise not be overly bothered by Weavile, such as Infernape. Assurance becomes quite powerful with Stealth Rock support, but is situational. Punishment deals heavy damage to stat boosters, but it is limited in use and generally does not have targets worth using it on. Lastly, Beat Up is usable early-game when Weavile's teammates are all healthy to deal serious damage to Pokemon with low base Defense, but is otherwise a waste of a moveslot and incredibly situational.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Genesect is easily the biggest threat to Weavile, resisting both of its STAB moves, outpacing it, and OHKOing with STAB U-turn. Skarmory takes a pittance from Weavile's attacks and can lay down Spikes before healing off the damage with Roost and phazing Weavile with Whirlwind. Excadrill also fears little from Weavile while sand is up, outspeeding and annihilating it with X-Scissor or STAB Earthquake. Jirachi can take anything Weavile can throw at it and crush Weavile with Iron Head. Keldeo resists both STAB moves and can obliterate Weavile with Secret Sword. Forretress takes little damage from Weavile and can set up entry hazards on it before going for the kill with Gyro Ball. Fast sweepers who resist Ice Shard, such as Choice Scarf Infernape, are also extremely threatening. Other priority users can also be an issue, such as Mach Punch Conkeldurr and Bullet Punch Scizor.</p> ",

        "name": "Revenge Killer",
        "description": "<p>This set takes full advantage of Weavile's unique combination of niches, allowing it to act as a potent revenge killer in multiple scenarios. Ice Shard is a very useful STAB move, allowing Weavile to revenge kill Garchomp, Dragonite, and Salamence with ease. Weavile can even revenge kill Breloom with a small amount of prior damage, beating Breloom to the literal punch with priority of its own. Pursuit is also an incredibly important asset, allowing Weavile to eliminate dangerous threats such as Latios, Starmie, and Choice Scarf Chandelure, assuming Chandelure is not locked into a Fire-type move. Pursuit can also be used to deal damage to Dragon-types attempting to switch out in order to avoid Ice Shard. Low Kick provides needed coverage against Steel-types, and also deals heavy amounts of damage to Tyranitar. Weavile's last move is its choice of an offensive STAB move. Night Slash is preferred, as it allows Weavile to pose a serious threats to walls such as Slowbro and Jellicent, who, so long as they didn't switch out, would not be overly bothered by Pursuit and could simply burn Weavile with Will-O-Wisp and Scald, respectively, before healing off the damage. However, Ice Punch is marginally stronger than Night Slash and provides useful coverage, so it is a considerable option.</p> <p>One of Weavile's biggest draws is its versatility, and as such Life Orb is an excellent item for it. However, Weavile can be a bit lacking in terms of offensive presence, which a Choice Band helps to mitigate. It restricts Weavile's utility a bit though, and makes it more likely that the opponent will find an opportunity to set up on Weavile. An Expert Belt is another option to consider, allowing Weavile to bluff a Choice Band while still providing a power boost, without the drawback of Life Orb's recoil. Brick Break is nearly as strong as Low Kick in some situations, and can break the dual screens of a Deoxys-S or Latios. Fake Out can assist in revenge killing threatening sweepers resistant to Ice Shard, such as Keldeo or Volcarona.</p> <p>Weavile wants entry hazard support badly, but also hates having to deal with the opponent's. Deoxys-S can provide Stealth Rock and Spikes while also blocking the opponent's entry hazards with Taunt or Magic Coat. Forretress performs similarly, setting down any entry hazard and spinning the opponent's away with Rapid Spin. Weavile also dislikes passive damage from weather, so Politoed and Abomasnow can be considered for partners. Politoed removes Weavile's Fire-type weakness, and Weavile can dispose of threats such as Dragonite, Latios, and Starmie, who would otherwise trouble Politoed. Abomasnow provides passive damage to soften up Weavile's opponents in the form of hail, and greatly benefits from having Chandelure removed. Similarly, Pokemon such as Breloom and Serperior are more threatening after an opposing Chandelure is disposed of. These two also greatly benefit from having the opponent's Dragon-types dispatched. Weavile's weakness to U-turn is a concern, so Pokemon who can switch into the move with little issue, such as Skarmory and Keldeo, are necessary. Weavile is also generally unable to get past Steel-types, so partners such as Chandelure and Excadrill are all appreciated.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine is one of the very few Ice-types that stand tall in the DW metagame due to both its typing, which grants it a neutrality to Stealth Rock as well as an immunity to both hail and sandstorm, and its fantastic offensive coverage, which allows Mamoswine to solely rely on its STAB moves in order to crush the opponent. Our shaggy friend also has a mammoth (excuse the pun) base 130 Attack, which basically translates as \"whatever doesn't resist its moves will get pulverized.\" Its Dream World ability, Thick Fat, grants it a neutrality to Fire and a resistance to Ice, making Mamoswine one of the few Pokemon that resists the famous BoltBeam combination.</p> <p>It's not all good news for Mamoswine though. It has a slew of weaknesses to common types including Fighting, Water, Grass and Steel. Furthermore, base 80 Speed often just isn't enough for the fast-paced Dream World metagame, and a weakness to common priority moves such as Mach Punch and Bullet Punch is unfortunate. However, don't let this put you off from using Mamoswine because it's a very powerful Pokemon and an excellent answer to fast and dangerous threats such as Garchomp, Dragonite and Thundurus that lurk the tier.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mamoswine has a fairly good movepool; however, it generally only has to rely on its STAB moves in order to defeat the opponent. Substitute springs to mind, as it effectively gives Mamoswine a safety blanket in order to unleash its attacks, and it is worth noting that Mamoswine can easily make 101 HP Substitutes by investing 160 EVs into HP. Curse is the only way Mamoswine can boost its Attack, and the Speed drop can be circumvented with Ice Shard. Rock Slide is a less powerful Rock-type move that Mamoswine has access to, but it has better accuracy than Stone Edge and a chance to flinch the opponent. Mamoswine also has a good special movepool, consisting of moves such as Ice Beam, Earth Power, and Hidden Power; however, Mamoswine's base 70 Special Attack leaves much to be desired. Instead, Mamoswine can opt to go mixed on a hail team by using Blizzard, which gives Mamoswine the ability to 2HKO Skarmory. Should Mamoswine be used on a hail team, then Snow Cloak is a fine choice for an ability, raising Mamoswine's evasion and possibly letting it fire off another attack. Thick Fat is generally preferred though, as it gives Mamoswine an extra resistance and a neutrality.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best way to beat Mamoswine is by using physically defensive Pokemon that aren't weak to its attacks. Steel-types with Levitate or a secondary typing that grants them a neutrality or an immunity to Ground, such as Scizor, Skarmory and Bronzong, can switch into Mamoswine and bring it down with Bullet Punch or Gyro Ball, or simply set up on it. Bulky Water-types such as Gyarados, Manaphy, and Keldeo can smash through Mamoswine with their powerful STAB moves. The former can cut Mamoswine's Attack with Intimidate and proceed to set up Dragon Dances, and the latter two can immediately target Mamoswine's weaker Special Defense and knock it out with Surf or Hydro Pump. Chandelure can come in on Mamoswine's Ice-type moves and trap it, but it must beware unless it is a Choice Scarf or Air Balloon variant, as it shares the same base Speed as Mamosine and runs the risk of losing the Speed tie.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This is the most straightforward and immediately threatening set that Mamoswine can run. Ice Shard is the main move on this set due to its sheer utility. A massive number of common Pokemon in the Dream World metagame are weak to it, including Garchomp, Dragonite, Salamence, Landorus, Thundurus, and Latios. Mamoswine can pick all of these Pokemon off at leisure, making it an excellent addition to teams that struggle with these fast and powerful offensive juggernauts. Icicle Crash is Mamoswine's secondary Ice-type move and is an excellent move to use against predicted switch-ins or Pokemon slower than Mamoswine or that can tank an Ice Shard such as Gliscor. Earthquake is Mamoswine's most powerful move, and it can comfortably 2HKO common switch ins such as Ferrothorn and Politoed. Stone Edge is the preferred move in the last slot, as it hits Pokemon such as Gyarados much harder than any of its other moves. Superpower is an alternative move that can work, hitting Blissey, Rotom-W, and Bronzong harder than any of Mamoswine's other moves, but it is sadly illegal with Thick Fat, meaning that one would have to resort to Snow Cloak, a far less useful ability.</p> <p>The EVs are very simple: maximized Attack and Speed let Mamoswine hit as hard and as fast as possible, while the remaining 4 EVs are dumped into HP. An Adamant nature is chosen in order to achieve a stronger Ice Shard, Mamoswine's main move, but Jolly can be used to Speed tie with other positive natured base 80s and neutral base 90s, such as Lucario. It also allows Mamoswine to always outspeed Heatran. Life Orb is the recommended item, giving Mamoswine the freedom to switch moves. Choice Band gives more power, but being locked into Earthquake is generally a bad idea due to the sheer amount of Pokemon immune to it and the introduction of Air Balloon.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is an alternative move choice for the last slot because Mamoswine can often rely solely on its STAB moves in order to achieve victory, and Stealth Rock provides great team support for offensive teams. However, Mamosine is neither particularly sturdy nor fast, meaning that it will often have to sacrifice itself in order to lay down the entry hazard. Icicle Spear is also a perfectly viable option as a secondary STAB Ice-type move, because it allows Mamoswine to break through Substitute and neutralize Dragonite's Multiscale while also having a potentially higher base power than Icicle Crash and perfect accuracy. Icicle Crash's reliable power is generally preferred however, since unless Icicle Spear hits four or more times in a row, it will end up doing less damage than Icicle Crash. Despite its power, Mamoswine has trouble breaking through tough physical walls such as Skarmory and Bronzong. Therefore, trappers such as Chandelure and Magnezone make excellent teammates for Mamoswine. Pokemon that can benefit from Mamoswine's ability to crush Dragon-types and bring down Pokemon such as Scarfed Landorus are also highly efficient partners. Volcarona is a prime example of this, as it also benefits from Mamoswine's ability to break through Blissey. Gyarados can come in on many things that give Mamoswine trouble, and vice versa. Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar, are also very useful teammates due to the fact that they can remove opposing Chandelure from the game. Chandelure can be extremely irritating to Mamoswine if it comes in on an Ice Shard, since it can then trap Mamoswine and proceed to nuke it with Fire Blast or Energy Ball.</p> "

Thanks to its typing, Mamoswine's Focus Sash will not be broken by neither sandstorm nor hail, meaning that Mamoswine is practically guaranteed to both set up Stealth Rock and bring down an opponent slower than itself with the combination of Ice Shard and Endeavour. Stealth Rock is an excellent entry hazard that helps keep threatening Pokemon such as Chandelure, Dragonite, and Volcarona in check. Endeavor should be used against slower opponents that attack Mamoswine on the turn that it sets up Stealth Rock, bringing Mamoswine down to 1 HP, should its Focus Sash be activated. Ice Shard can then knock the opponent out before it can attack Mamoswine again, and Earthquake is an excellent STAB move to use if Mamoswine survives the first few turns of the battle.</p> <p>The EVs are once again very simple. Mamoswine only needs to maximize its Attack and its Speed, and the remaining 4 EVs are placed into HP. A Jolly nature is recommended so that Mamoswine can sometimes squeeze off an extra attack against a slower opponent. An Adamant nature is, however, still an option, since its attacks are noticeably weaker without an item to boost them. Focus Sash guarantees that Mamoswine will be able to set up Stealth Rock should it not be Taunted, meaning that Mamoswine will be able to bring its opponent down to 1 HP as well with Endeavor. One of the most efficient ways to prevent Mamoswine from setting up Stealth Rock is to use Fake Out and then hit it with a powerful super effective move, so Ghost-types such as Chandelure make excellent partners, preventing Pokemon such as Mienshao and Ambipom from ruining Mamoswine's day. They also spinblock, ensuring that Mamoswine's Stealth Rock stays up for the duration of the match.</p> "

Rotom-W also makes an excellent Choice Scarf user as it is able to check some of the most dangerous threats in the tier, such as +1 Dragonite, Garchomp, and Thundurus.

Rest + Chesto Berry is an option, but Rotom-W can stay healthy with Pain Spit, as walls with high HP commonly switch into it. Furthermore, status isn't usually a problem because of Volt Switch. Rotom-W can revisit its staple Substitute + Charge Beam set from DPP, but this set is still walled by typical Rotom-W counters, namely Gastrodon and Celebi, while Volt Switch has much more utility. Rotom-W can function as an effective dual screens lead as opponents usually won't Taunt it, expecting an offensive variant. However, barring the surprise factor, Deoxys-S is a better option due to its superior Speed.</p> <p>Rotom-W can utilize Rain Dance to boost its own Water-type STAB while improving Thunder to 100% accuracy. In the same vein, it can also use Sunny Day to boost Hidden Power Fire in order to beat Ferrothorn. Sunny Day Rotom-W is a great fit on sun teams, as it provides backup sun and scares off Tyranitar and Politoed with its STAB moves. Shadow Ball hits Celebi and Latias harder than a super effective Hidden Power, but it won't OHKO them, and certain Hidden Power types are more useful as they enable Rotom-W to get past some of its greatest obstacles. Finally, Rindo Berry is a option to cover up Rotom-W's only weakness, but Rotom-W can't do much to Grass-types in return.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As Rotom-W is primarily a special attacker, Chansey and Blissey will naturally give it problems. The pink blobs can even check the SubSplit set if they pack Seismic Toss. Rotom-W struggles most with bulky Grass-types, such as Celebi, Ferrothorn, Breloom, and Venusaur, as they resist both of Rotom-W's STAB attacks while striking back with STAB super effective Grass-type attacks. A Pokemon commonly paired up with Venusaur, Ninetales, can also switch into Rotom-W, neutralize its Water-type attacks, and hit it with a super effective Solar Beam. Latias and Latios are excellent checks to Rotom-W, as the former shrugs off super effective Hidden Powers and Shadow Ball after one Calm Mind, while the latter is able to KO Rotom-W with a powerful Draco Meteor. Gastrodon is one of the few Pokemon immune to both of Rotom-W's STAB attacks, but the worst it can do to Rotom-W is Toxic.

        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Rotom-W can outrun and KO dangerous threats in the DW metagame, such as Thundurus, +1 Dragonite, and Garchomp. Volt Switch enables Rotom-W to function as a scout; Rotom-W is a particularly effective user of the move due to its immunity to both forms of Spikes. Hydro Pump serves as a secondary STAB move that hits hard when boosted by rain, KOing Ground-type foes hoping to switch into Rotom-W's Electric-type attacks. Hidden Power Fire is specifically for Ferrothorn, which resists both of Rotom-W's STABs. Hidden Power Ice, on the other hand, offers a reliable method of revenge killing +1 Dragonite and Salamence. Trick rounds out the set, allowing Rotom-W to cripple common switch-ins such as Ferrothorn, Gastrodon, and Blissey, while possibly obtaining Leftovers to capitalize on Rotom-W's great bulk. However, Thunderbolt is a viable alternative due to its superior power and ability to consistently break Substitutes of Pokemon such as Chandelure and Gyarados.</p> <p>A Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs enable Rotom-W to outrun +2 Gorebyss and Modest Choice Scarf Genesect. Two moves to consider in the third slot are Signal Beam and Hidden Power Grass, as the former OHKOes Celebi while the latter disposes of Gastrodon, but the overall coverage these two attacks provide is outclassed by Hidden Power Fire or Ice. Finally, Rotom-W can use Thunder over Thunderbolt if it has rain support.</p> <p>Scizor makes an excellent partner to Rotom-W, forming a VoltTurn chain that can deal with the majority of each other's counters. Genesect can perform a similar role as Scizor, but Chansey walls both it and Rotom-W. Rotom-W appreciates Rapid Spin support, as Stealth Rock can limit the number of times Rotom-W can use Volt Switch. Rapid Spin Excadrill pairs up well with Rotom-W, as Rotom-W can counter Gliscor and Skarmory, two of Excadrill's biggest obstacles. Excadrill can also OHKO a large portion of special walls for Rotom-W. Choice Scarf Rotom-W loves rain support to compensate for its lack of boosting item or move. Drizzle Politoed is the best way to supply Rotom-W with rain; a Choice variant in particular can break down walls for Rotom-W.</p> <p>Rotom-W thrives with entry hazard support, as it secures more KOs while putting the opponent under pressure with Volt Switch. Stealth Rock also breaks Dragonite's Multiscale, allowing Rotom-W to OHKO Dragon Dance Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice. Stealth Rock also puts Thundurus in range where Rotom-W can OHKO with Rotom-W's Volt Switch. Forretress can provide Rotom-W with both hazard and Rapid Spin support, while Rotom-W can switch into Fire-type attacks aimed at Forretress. Finally, Wish support can preserve Rotom-W's excellent bulk and let it repeatedly switch into threats. Rotom-W shares greats synergy with Jirachi, which can provide Wishes large enough to heal Rotom-W.</p> "

        "name": "Tank",
        "description": "<p>This set aims to deal damage to the opponent's team over a long period of time while having enough bulk to serve as a defensive pivot, essentially combining Rotom-W's offensive, defensive, and support capabilities. Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to scout for counters, and as this is a slower set, teammates can switch in safely after Rotom-W uses it. Thunderbolt is an option as it makes this set a hard counter to Substitute + Dragon Dance Gyarados. Hydro Pump serves as a secondary STAB move that disposes of the Ground-types Rotom-W can easily switch into, such as Landorus and Excadrill. Rotom-W can generally handle Hydro Pump's imperfect accuracy due to its great bulk.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire is notable for KOing Ferrothorn outright, while Hidden Power Ice is handy for hitting Dragonite, Salamence, and Garchomp. Hidden Power Ice is also useful for hitting Landorus and Gliscor more reliably than Hydro Pump. Pain Split provides a reliable source of recovery, as Pokemon with huge HP stats, such as Blissey, commonly switch into Rotom-W. Will-O-Wisp is another option, as it enables Rotom-W to cripple Tyranitar and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize Rotom-W's physical bulk so that it can comfortably take on Excadrill and Landorus. Rotom-W can use an alternate EV spread of 40 HP / 252 SpA / 216 Spe, which maximizes its attacking power and enables it to outspeed neutral-natured Gyarados, Mamoswine, Dragonite, and uninvested Latias, with the remaining EVs put into HP for added bulk. This set is a lot more flexible in terms of move selection as it isn't locked into one move like the Choice Scarf set. Expert Belt allows Rotom-W to feign a Choice item while using Volt Switch, but Rotom-W will miss the recovery. Hidden Power Grass hits Gastrodon, which is immune to both of Rotom-W's STABs. Thunder Wave can be used in the third slot; reminiscent to Tinkerbell Celebi, it makes Rotom-W a more self-sufficient sweeper as it can outspeed most paralyzed threats and hit them with a powerful attack. Rotom-W can use Toxic over Will-O-Wish, but the latter is generally more useful, crippling Pokemon such Tyranitar and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Politoed is a good partner as it boosts Rotom-W's Water-type attacks and has the ability to burn foes with Scald, letting Rotom-W forgo Will-O-Wisp for another move. Metagross forms an excellent defensive core alongside Rotom-W, as they cover all of each other's weaknesses, while Metagross can Pursuit trap Celebi, Latias, and Latios so that Rotom-W is free to fire off its powerful STAB attacks. The likes of Calm Mind Latias and Keldeo can also capitalize on Rotom-W's ability to spread burns. Forretress can provide Rotom-W with hazard and Rapid Spin support so that it secures more KOs and is free to Volt Switch to its heart's desire. With Stealth Rock down, Rotom-W can OHKO 4/0 Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice (Dragonite might have Lum Berry, so Will-O-Wisp isn't always the best option), and with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, Rotom-W can OHKO standard Magnezone with Hydro Pump. Rotom-W can also KO Jellicent, letting Forretress safely use Rapid Spin. Excadrill is also a good candidate to provide Rapid Spin, as Rotom-W can beat a large portion of Excadrill's switch-ins.</p> "

      {
        "name": "SubSplit",
        "description": "<p>Unlike its other sets, SubSpit Rotom-W plays the role of an all-out sweeper and aims to beat some of Rotom-W's conventional counters through the use of Substitute and Pain Split. Rotom-W makes an exceptional user of the SubSplit combination with its excellent typing and low base HP, meaning it gains huge amounts of health back when it uses Pain Split against walls such as Blissey. The key to this Rotom-W beating Blissey and Gastrodon is Toxic Spikes support, though Gastrodon can also simply be Toxiced as it lacks Natural Cure. With Toxic Spikes down, Blissey and Gastrodon will be put on a timer by Toxic and Rotom-W's arsenal of Pain Split and strong attacks. Rotom-W's great typing and defensive stats mean its Substitutes are relatively difficult to break. Hydro Pump and Thunderbolt hit incredibly hard as they receive boosts from STAB, Life Orb, and possibly even rain.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Rotom-W's potency as a sweeper, while the HP EVs help Rotom-W maintain its Substitute against rain-boosted Scalds from Gastrodon and other bulky Water-types. Rotom-W prefers a Modest nature for more power; Timid can be used, but Rotom-W outspeeds nothing significant with it barring opposing Rotom-W. Life Orb is the primary item for more power; however, Leftovers is a viable option if you're worried about the omnipresent sand wearing Rotom-W down too quickly. If Rotom-W has rain support, it can use Thunder over Thunderbolt for more power and a 30% paralysis rate.</p> <p>As previously stated, this set is much more effective with Toxic Spikes and rain support; Tentacruel can provide Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin support, and is generally a good fit on rain teams. Politoed is an obligatory partner; a variant with Toxic is preferred to hit Gastrodon, but Choice Specs Politoed is also a good option as Rotom-W can take out Blissey and Gastrodon with proper support. Politoed also eliminates residual damage from sand or hail, which Rotom-W always appreciates. This variant of Rotom-W still has trouble with Latias and Celebi, so Scizor makes a good partner to eliminate them with Pursuit or its Bug-type attacks. If you can't fit Toxic Spikes on your team, Breloom can dispose of Blissey and Gastrodon with its STAB attacks. Breloom and Rotom-W also share good type synergy, covering up a majority of each other's weaknesses. Finally, hazards can prove useful for securing more KOs. For instance, with Stealth Rock down, Rotom-W can OHKO 252/252+ Politoed with a Life Orb-boosted Thunder, preventing Politoed from using Perish Song to ruin Rotom-W's sweep. Skarmory can lay down Spikes or Stealth Rock while covering Rotom-W's Grass-type weakness; furthermore, Rotom-W covers Skarmory's Fire-type weakness.</p> "

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill has had a wild ride since its inception in BW. Its Sand Rush ability made Excadrill the first true offensive sand sweeper, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, and nearly any Pokemon with a single boost! A STAB Earthquake coming off of an amazing 135 base Attack stat and the ability to boost it further while facing hopeless walls with Swords Dance made Excadrill a terrifying sweeper. It could even use Rapid Spin with impunity, because no Ghost-type would ever dare switching in. As such, it was eventually banished to the Uber tier, where much more dangerous threats lurked. However, Excadrill is back with a vengeance in the Dream World metagame, and is still as effective as ever.</p> <p>Excadrill is not without its flaws, however. Without sand support, Excadrill lies at a rather upsetting base 88 Speed tier, outsped by opposing weather starters such as Choice Scarf Politoed and most variants of Ninetales. Excadrill's thin defenses force it to remain cautious if it plans to set up Swords Dance. Priority from Pokemon such as Breloom and Conkeldurr put a quick stop to Excadrill's sweeping fun. Sturdy walls such as Skarmory and Hippowdon can either phaze it or, in the latter's case, hit it with a powerful STAB Earthquake of its own. Still, these flaws are avoidable with the proper support, allowing Excadrill to remain the premier sand sweeper in the Dream World metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Band set with Earthquake, Rock Slide, Return, and X-Scissor for maximum coverage is viable, working to punch holes in your opponent's team, but the main draw of Sand Rush is that it allows Excadrill to sweep almost unhindered, and having the ability to switch moves is highly important. With Excadrill's excellent HP stat, it has the potential to be more specially bulky than Skarmory and Forretress; a spread of 52 HP / 252 SpD / 204 Spe allows Excadrill to switch into Latios's Choice Specs Draco Meteor, never being 2HKOed, thus allowing it to set up a Swords Dance. Chople Berry can be used on a Swords Dance set, letting Excadrill boost its Attack, survive the incoming Mach Punch from the likes of Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Infernape, and OHKO back with Return. Excadrill's movepool is very precise and leaves it with very few alternatives to the standard sets. Mold Breaker is Excadrill's third ability and allows it to hit the Rotom formes for maximum damage, but Excadrill sits at such an unfortunate Speed tier without Sand Rush or even Choice Scarf, making it an inferior option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Although Excadrill is indeed very dangerous, there are a few Pokemon who can stop its sweep cold. The most dangerous of these is Breloom, who can actually switch in on a Swords Dance or something as powerful as Adamant Choice Band-boosted Return, and proceed to OHKO with Mach Punch. Skarmory can switch in on any of its moves and phaze with Whirlwind, although it can be flinched to death by Rock Slide. Gliscor can also switch into any Excadrill lacking Air Balloon and KO with Earthquake, although it faces the same risk as Skarmory in regards to flinching. Bronzong only takes neutral damage from X-Scissor, is immune to Earthquake, and Excadrill will be hard-pressed to flinch it to death with a resisted Rock Slide before Bronzong hits it back with Earthquake. Choice Scarf Politoed can either switch into Swords Dance or revenge kill Excadrill, with Politoed's self-induced rain negating Sand Rush.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>This is Excadrill's most dangerous set, and what causes your opponent to tremble in fear. The idea is to come in on a wall that can do very little to Excadrill, set up a Swords Dance, and start wreaking havoc. The easiest possible wall on whom to switch in is Chansey, as Excadrill is immune to Toxic and Thunder Wave, and can only be whittled down by Seismic Toss. Any Forretress without Earthquake will run and hide out of fear of being 2HKOed by Excadrill at +2. Don't even think about setting up on Ferrothorn, though, because uninvested Power Whip is a clean 2HKO. After a Swords Dance and holding a Life Orb, only Air Balloon holders are safe, as Excadrill can even 2HKO Skarmory lacking Leftovers after Stealth Rock damage. Additionally, at +4, Excadrill can OHKO Gliscor with Return, which is no small feat.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the EVs are tailored to maximize Excadrill's Speed and Attack. Adamant is preferred to gain the previously mentioned 2HKO on Skarmory. When running Air Balloon, Jolly is a great option, as it can switch into Ground-type attacks, safely set up Swords Dance, and outspeed opposing Adamant Excadrill. The fourth moveslot comes down to preference. Return grants Excadrill excellent neutral coverage, as most Pokemon who resist Earthquake also resist Rock Slide. X-Scissor makes quick work of Latias and Latios after a Swords Dance, with a near guaranteed chance to OHKO the former (assuming it isn't running 252 / 252 with a Defense-boosting nature) and assuring an OHKO on the latter. Since Excadrill often forces switches, and none of them to Ghost-types, it is free to use Rapid Spin to get rid of entry hazards that may quickly wear down your team.</p> <p>When using Excadrill, there are a few precautions you must take before you can destroy your opponent. First, you absolutely must be free of your opponent's Breloom or Conkeldurr. Breloom is a game of prediction, and one misplay can result in some Pokemon being crippled with sleep status. Chandelure can only switch in on Mach Punch, but a combination of Spore and Bullet Seed puts a complete stop to Chandelure's life. If you somehow manage to bring in Chandelure safely, however, it can OHKO Breloom even in the rain with Fire Blast. Conkeldurr is less common and can be taken care of by sturdy special attackers such as Latios, or simply phazed by walls such as Skarmory. Opposing weather starters, mainly Politoed and Ninetales, must be out of the picture or Excadrill loses its niche. Bulky variants of Politoed are somewhat difficult to take care of, and they must be at low health if you plan on taking the risk of sending in Chandelure and KOing it with Energy Ball. Specially defensive Tyranitar switches in on Ninetales with no problem and can hit it with Pursuit on the inevitable switch. If entry hazards are up, Ninetales will not survive the next switch in and will fail to bring back the sun.</p> "

  "Darmanitan": {
    "overview": "<p>Darmanitan is one of the most overlooked threats in the 5th generation. It has a great HP stat, decent Speed, and an absolutely massive base 140 Attack. Its ability, Sheer Force, boosts its strongest STAB move, Flare Blitz, to such unbelievable heights that when aided by sun, it can 2HKO nearly everything in the metagame. Why, then, has Darmanitan seen such little use in the Dream World metagame? First of all, its Fire typing, while indispensable offensively, hampers it so much defensively. It loses at least 25% of health just by switching in, assuming Stealth Rock is down. Although its HP stat is great, its only purpose is to help Darmanitan take more recoil damage from Flare Blitz, as its 55 / 55 defenses make switching in safely almost impossible. Its base 95 Speed stat, while decent, is just below the benchmark set bythe numerous offensive powerhouses present in the metagame (namely Haxorus, Salamence, Keldeo, Garchomp, and Terrakion), requiring Darmanitan to use a Choice Scarf to bypass these threats. Don't let these flaws discourage you from using Darmanitan, however, as with Drought support, Darmanitan can rip through entire teams, leaving the bloody entrails of even those who resist its Flare Blitz in its wake.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With its massive Attack stat and excellent coverage, Darmanitan is capable of running an all-out attacking set with a Life Orb or even a Choice Band. However, base 95 Speed is surprisingly low in the Dream World metagame, with common threats such as the very Pokemon that Choice Scarf lets Darmanitan outspeed being able to handle Darmanitan with ease. Choice Scarf really is Darmanitan's saving grace and should be the primary consideration when using it. Finally, don't even let the words \"Zen Mode\" enter your mind, as the lack of Sheer Force and appreciable Speed make life extremely difficult, especially when it must be at 50% health to function.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>On the flip-side of Darmanitan's amazing firepower comes its overall frailty. Any Pokemon who can outspeed Darmanitan is almost guaranteed to defeat it. Powerful Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion can easily outspeed it and OHKO with whatever attack it pleases. Due to Darmanitan's Fire typing, Stealth Rock really impedes its ability to switch in over and over. Tyranitar is great for this role, simultaneously bringing in sand and covering up the sun that Darmanitan desperately needs to sweep. Furthermore, Excadrill outspeeds Darmanitan in the sand and has no trouble OHKOing it with Earthquake. Rain is not a pretty environment for Darmanitan either, neutering its most powerful attack. Bulky Politoed has little problem switching into Darmanitan's attacks and forcing it to switch out. Making Darmanitan's Speed a non-issue is also a sure-fire way to stop it. Priority Thunder Wave from Thundurus goes a long way, but it has trouble switching into Darmanitan and may not be worth the sacrifice.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>This is Darmanitan's most effective set, packing enough Speed to outpace the most important threats of the unboosted metagame. Flare Blitz is the most important move in Darmanitan's repertoire, annihilating threats that don't resist it (and even some that do!), making it nearly impossible to switch into. The other moves on this set serve only to make way for Darmanitan to sweep with Flare Blitz unhindered. Earthquake dismantles Flash Fire Pokemon, most importantly Heatran. U-turn is important to scout for said Pokemon, in case they are holding an Air Balloon. It is also great for breaking Sturdy users and holders of Focus Sash, allowing you to switch in a counter and take them out. Rock Slide punches through +1 Dragonite's Multiscale, forcing it to use ExtremeSpeed if it hopes to stop Darmanitan. Superpower is mainly filler, but it can take care of Air Balloon Heatran, who could otherwise switch in on Darmanitan with impunity.</p> <p>The given EVs and nature listed are self-explanatory: maximize Darmanitan's Attack with an Adamant nature and bolster its Speed with full EV investment. To give you an idea of the strength offered by Adamant, Flare Blitz has a chance to OHKO Latios and Salamence, and 2HKOes Jellicent in the sun; Superpower OHKOes Heatran, and Earthquake 2HKOes Politoed with damage from Stealth Rock. Jolly can be used to outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Rotom-W, whom Darmanitan has a fair chance of defeating after prior damage in the sun, but that is about the only relevant threat it outspeeds.</p> <p>Darmanitan's artificially high Speed and raw power almost make it self-sufficient, but it does need some support in order to sweep. First, Drought support from Ninetales is absolutely necessary to gain crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs with Flare Blitz. Secondly, Flash Fire users, namely Heatran, should be dispatched before Darmanitan attempts to go on a Flare Blitz rampage. Darmanitan itself can take care of Heatran with Earthquake as long as it doesn't carry Air Balloon, but as always, a Choice-locked Earthquake is extremely risky. If you fear a Heatran switch-in, U-turn is a better choice to pop the Air Balloon it may be carrying, and a quick switch to Dugtrio will end Heatran's fun. Entry hazards, most importantly Stealth Rock, are also required to break through Multiscale, Sturdy, and Focus Sash, which may otherwise ruin Darmanitan's sweep. Finally, if you plan on running Superpower, make sure you have a way of taking out Chandelure, or else Darmanitan becomes pure setup bait.</p> "

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>If there's one thing that defines Reuniclus, it's Magic Guard. Magic Guard is an amazing ability, making Reuniclus completely immune to any form of passive damage. This allows it to take on defensive teams quite easily, as they rely on passive damage such as Spikes and Toxic to take down the opposing team, while Reuniclus can set up with Calm Mind and Recover. Fast offensive teams, on the other hand, have trouble with a Trick Room set that can use its low speed to \"outspeed\" nearly everything under Trick Room. Unfortunately, Dream World isn't very kind to Reuniclus, as it adds two major threats to it: Chandelure and Genesect. However, with the right support, Reuniclus is definitely a dangerous sweeper that shouldn't be underestimated.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Reuniclus can run a Trick set with Flame Orb, as burn really cripples Scizor and Tyranitar who commonly switch into Reuniclus. However, the Trick Room set with Hidden Power Fire does a better job at beating Scizor and Tyranitar, as it can simply KO them and even attempt a sweep afterwards. Using Acid Armor and Calm Mind means Reuniclus will be very hard to take out, but seeing as Recover is a must on this set, Reuniclus will only have space for one attack and as such will be easily walled; such a set is also very vulnerable to critical hits. Reuniclus can use Regenerator as an alternate ability to gain health while switching, but the main reason for using Reuniclus in the first place is Magic Guard; besides, Recover is usually enough of a recovering option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Switching into Reuniclus can be quite difficult, its two most common sets have pretty different counters. However, there are several Pokemon who can switch into both sets reliably. Jirachi is your best bet as it can take almost any hit easily thanks to its typing and bulk, heal off damage with Wish, and take down Reuniclus with a combination of Thunder Wave and Iron Head. Scizor also has an easy time against any Reuniclus lacking Hidden Power Fire, and can fire off a powerful U-turn or set up a Swords Dance and OHKO with Bug Bite. Sableye is rather rare, but it is immune to every attacking move on the Calm Mind set, and with enough Special Defense investment, isn't 2HKOed by Shadow Ball from the Trick Room set, so it can take down Reuniclus with the combination of Taunt, Night Shade, and Recover. Spiritomb is also immune to both Psychic and Focus Blast and can actually hit Reuniclus with one of its STAB moves. Calm Mind Latias with Roar is another good counter to Reuniclus, particularly the Calm Mind set, as it resists both Psychic and Focus Blast; it can set up its own Calm Minds and Roar out Reuniclus to prevent it from setting up itself. However, Latias must watch out for Psyshock, and also has a harder time if Reuniclus is the last Pokemon, making Roar useless. Blissey and Chansey also wall the Trick Room set cold if Reuniclus lacks Psyshock; they can thus stall out the Trick Room turns with Wish and Protect while wearing down Reuniclus with Seismic Toss.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>This is Reuniclus's bread-and-butter set, and is great at taking on defensive teams. Thanks to Magic Guard, defensive Pokemon are forced to attack Reuniclus to damage it. With this EV spread, Reuniclus is very bulky on the physical side, while Calm Mind will boost its Special Defense, making Reuniclus hard to take down. Recover adds to this, as Reuniclus can just heal off damage taken whenever it gets low on health. Because of this, Reuniclus can set up on almost anything commonly found on stall teams, and without a proper counter, it will easily take them down single-handedly.</p> <p>Psychic is Reuniclus's best STAB move, as after several boosts, it hits anything that doesn't resist it very hard. Psyshock is a decent option to use instead of Psychic, as it lets it beat Calm Mind Latias, as well as other Reuniclus, but Psychic is usually the better choice as Reuniclus beats Blissey and Chansey even with Psychic. Focus Blast is the best option in the last slot as it provides good coverage with Psychic.</p> <p>The choice of item depends on your preference. Leftovers is the main choice as it provides more longevity, and most importantly allows Reuniclus to avoid the 2HKO from support Tyranitar. Life Orb is also a good option as it provides a recoil-free boost to Reuniclus's attacks thanks to Magic Guard. 32 EVs are invested in Special Attack, as this lets Reuniclus KO Chandelure after one Calm Mind as well as Stealth Rock damage. This means that if Chandelure tries to trap Reuniclus, it will cost it its life since even a Choice Specs-boosted Shadow Ball won't KO Reuniclus after one Calm Mind. The rest of the EVs are used to maximize Reuniclus's physical bulk so that it can take hits from the likes of Ferrothorn and Gliscor.</p> <p>Choice Band Scizor is a major threat to this set, as it can take a boosted Focus Blast and deal heavy damage with U-turn, allowing a faster teammate to take Reuniclus out with ease. In the same vein, specially defensive Jirachi can sponge Reuniclus's boosted attacks easily, paralyze it, and wear it down with Iron Head. Chandelure is thus an excellent Pokemon to pair with Reuniclus, as it can trap and take out Steel- and Psychic-types who trouble Reuniclus with its STAB attacks. However, Chandelure and Reuniclus do share a weakness to Ghost- and Dark-type attacks, so it is recommended you use something that resists those types, such as Tyranitar or Heatran.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Trick Room",
        "description": "<p>This set exchanges the ability to beat defensive teams easily for a way of threatening fast offensive teams. Reuniclus has incredibly low Speed and high Special Attack, which makes Trick Room an excellent option. In Trick Room, Reuniclus is \"outsped\" only by Ferrothorn, and as such, offensive teams that rely on Speed to function will have problems with this set. This set is meant to come in on something that doesn't threaten it, such as Conkeldurr or Espeon, and set up Trick Room. Reuniclus can then fire off powerful Life Orb-boosted attacks without taking any recoil.</p> <p>Psychic is Reuniclus's obligatory powerful STAB attack, hitting almost anything hard that doesn't resist it. Psyshock is also a decent option though, as it lets Reuniclus 2HKO Blissey, but it doesn't have much use other than that and Psychic hits almost everything for more damage. Focus Blast provides coverage, hitting Dark- and Steel-types such as Tyranitar and Excadrill super effectively. The choice of move in the last slot can be a tough one. Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Genesect and Scizor, who otherwise force Reuniclus out by threatening it with a powerful U-turn. Shadow Ball, on the other hand, hits opposing Psychic-types such as Latios and Alakazam, as well as bulky Ghost-types such as Jellicent. If you use Hidden Power Fire, it is advised that you use Tyranitar or Scizor to trap those Psychic- and Ghost-types.</p> <p>This set does have trouble with Chansey and Blissey, as well as Jirachi; they are able to stall out Trick Room turns with Wish and Protect while not being 2HKOed by any of Reuniclus's moves (though Blissey must watch out for Psyshock), and can take down Reuniclus slowly with Seismic Toss or Iron Head. Scizor and Genesect can be tough to handle if Reuniclus doesn't have Hidden Power Fire, as they can take a Focus Blast at full health and KO with U-turn or Bug Buzz, respectively. When using Reuniclus on a dedicated Trick Room team, Jellicent makes for a good partner who can also set up Trick Room, as it isn't threatened by any of the moves Scizor, Genesect, or Jirachi commonly carry, and can also fire off a powerful STAB Water Spout under Trick Room. Conkeldurr is another good partner as it can beat Blissey and Chansey easily, while also covering the Dark-type weakness Reuniclus and Jellicent share.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>With its fantastic Water / Ghost typing, 100 / 70 / 105 defensive stats, and access to a host of useful support moves such as Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and Toxic, Jellicent is certainly more useful than the average can of Pringles. What truly sets it apart from other bulky Water-types, however, is its secondary Ghost typing, which allows it to function as an effective spinblocker. Jellicent also has a reliable recovery move in Recover, which prolongs its longevity by leaps and bounds. It can even put its decent base 85 Special Attack to good use by surprising potential counters with moves such as Shadow Ball and Ice Beam. Unfortunately, Jellicent's average base 70 Defense allows powerful physical attacks from the likes of Excadrill to break through it, and weaknesses to Pursuit and common Electric-type attacks don't help either. Don't write off Jellicent on the basis of these flaws though, as it can lead dangerous threats such as Mienshao to their watery graves.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Jellicent's wide movepool grants it a few alternative options to consider. It has access to Energy Ball to catch Water-types off-guard, but forgoing Taunt for this is not a good idea. Hydro Pump is a more powerful option over Scald or Surf, but its low accuracy and PP can be issues. Hex can be used to deal heavy damage to statused opponents, especially with Toxic Spikes support. A Choice Specs set with Water Spout can work as a bulky wallbreaker with Trick Room support. Speaking of Trick Room, Jellicent can also set up the field effect itself. Pain Split can be used as a recovery option, but Recover is much more reliable. Safeguard can be used to guard against status; this prevents Prankster users such as Thundurus from ruining a teammate's sweep. Lastly, Night Shade can be used over Scald to dish out more consistent damage, especially to threats which resist Water-type attacks, but Scald's burn chance generally makes it the superior option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Exploiting Jellicent's poor Defense and weaknesses to common attacks is the way to go as far as checking it is concerned. Breloom comes to mind immediately, as it can OHKO Jellicent with Bullet Seed or force a switch and set up Swords Dance, fearing only a burn from Will-O-Wisp or Scald as it switches in. Ferrothorn can also score an OHKO using Power Whip, but its low Speed forces it to be wary of burn. Physical sweepers such as Garchomp and Excadrill can muscle through Jellicent with their STAB attacks after a boost; the former is especially dangerous as it can block Will-O-Wisp with Substitute. Electric-types such as Thundurus, Rotom-W, and Raikou all destroy Jellicent with their STAB moves and don't mind a burn either. Manaphy can OHKO Jellicent after a Tail Glow with Energy Ball; it isn't bothered by status in the rain thanks to Hydration. Genesect can 2HKO with Thunderbolt, and with its decent bulk, it isn't even 2HKOed by Scald. Fast Taunt users such as Thundurus shut down Jellicent as they don't take much damage from its weak Scalds. Toxic Spikes ruin Jellicent as well, putting it on a timer each time it switches in. Sun teams also screw up Jellicent badly, as sweepers such as Volcarona can muscle through Jellicent with their STAB moves after a boost while not being OHKOed by Scald. Choice Scarf Chandelure in particular can trap and take out Jellicent with Shadow Ball; Scald fails to OHKO it in the sun.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility Counter",
        "description": "<p>Jellicent might not have the imposing defensive stats of Ferrothorn, but it does have highly useful immunities to Fighting-, Water-, and Normal-type attacks, as well as resistances to Fire-, Ice-, and Bug-type ones. 100 / 70 / 105 defenses afford Jellicent enough special bulk to take on threats such as Latios, and while its base 70 Defense might seem subpar, Jellicent has access to Will-O-Wisp to make up for this. Scald is preferred over Surf for its burn chance, particularly if you are running Toxic, but Surf can be used instead for the guaranteed OHKO on Chandelure after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>The choice between Will-O-Wisp and Toxic is heavily influenced by the threats that you want Jellicent to check. Will-O-Wisp is preferred as it enables Jellicent to shut down Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and cripple physical attackers in general. However, with Toxic, Jellicent can cripple bulky threats such as Latias and Politoed, as well as opposing Jellicent. Recover gives Jellicent valuable recovery, enabling it to stall out anything which cannot 2HKO it in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic. Taunt shuts down walls such as Chansey and Skarmory, preventing them from healing and protecting Jellicent from crippling status such as Toxic. As an added plus, Jellicent is immune to Seismic Toss and can heal off the little damage these walls inflict with Recover, allowing it to stall them out with ease.</p> <p>The EVs are mainly put into HP and Defense to give Jellicent optimum physical bulk, with a Bold nature further boosting Jellicent's Defense; this ensures that Genesect will not get a Special Attack boost upon switching in. The rest of the EVs are simply dumped in Special Defense. Water Absorb is the ability of choice for an additional Water-type immunity; Cursed Body is too situational and unreliable for it to merit use. A specially defensive EV spread can be used to better tank special attacks if you seek to use Jellicent solely as a special tank. Shadow Ball can be used as the STAB option to deal heavy damage to Starmie, but Water-type attacks have better neutral coverage, not to mention the fact that Jellicent will be unable to wear down walls such as Skarmory and Chansey. Ice Beam is also an option to deal heavy damage to Dragon-types such as Dragonite, but Jellicent cannot stay in and attack unless it burns them on the switch with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>While Jellicent serves as a utility counter to specific threats that its team has trouble dealing with, it needs some support itself to be effective. Pairing it with Ferrothorn to create the famed FerroCent defensive core is a great idea, as the two have excellent synergy; Jellicent can spinblock and switch in on Fire- and Fighting-type attacks all day long, while Ferrothorn can set up entry hazards and sponge Electric- and Grass-type attacks. Skarmory makes a good teammate as well, as it can set up Spikes and easily check physical threats that trouble Jellicent, such as Excadrill and Dragonite. A special wall such as Chansey can help Jellicent immensely by soaking up Electric- and Grass-type special attacks that give it a lot of trouble, luring Fighting-type attacks for it to switch into, and providing Aromatherapy support to keep it free of status. Providing Jellicent with Toxic Spikes support is also a good idea, as this allows it to run Will-O-Wisp while maintaining the ability to stall out bulky Water-types such as Politoed. Good offensive partners for Jellicent are those that can switch into and take out the Pokemon which threaten it. Lum Berry Dragonite walls Breloom cold and can OHKO it with Fire Punch. A strong Pursuit user such as Tyranitar checks Chandelure, which can trap and eliminate Jellicent. Raikou and Zapdos make fine checks to Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus, as they can switch into Electric-type attacks and deal heavy damage with a STAB Thunderbolt of their own. A bulky Ground-type such as Mamoswine is also recommended to switch into stray Volt Switches.</p> "

  "Mienshao": {
    "overview": "<p>Mienshao's base 125 Attack and 105 Speed might make it appear to be yet another run-of-the-mill Fighting-type physical attacker, but it sports a usable base 95 Special Attack stat that allows it to get past would-be counters such as Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice. That's not all: access to a powerful STAB High Jump Kick, a fantastic ability in Regenerator, and U-turn make Mienshao a potent hit-and-run attacker that can tear gaping holes in the opponent's team. It even receives Reckless from the Dream World, jacking up the power of High Jump Kick to obscene levels. However, the presence of Shadow Tag Chandelure means that Mienshao must exercise extreme caution when using High Jump Kick, particularly on a Choice set. Mienshao's poor defensive stats also allow most neutral STAB moves to deal heavy damage if not OHKO. Still, don't let that deter you from using Mienshao; with the proper support, it can run away with games easily.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Though Mienshao's wide movepool gives it access to to several other moves, most of them are unusable or inferior to the given options in some way. It can run an Endure + Reversal set with a Salac Berry, but Mienshao is very frail, and the ubiquity of sandstorm and priority moves obviously makes this exceedingly difficult to pull off. Acrobatics + Flying Gem is another combination which might appear to be effective, but giving up Life Orb and a coverage move is not a good idea. Drain Punch can be used as a substitute for a STAB move that also provides recovery, but High Jump Kick's power is too good to pass up, and besides, Mienshao already has Regenerator for recovery. Mienshao also has access to other physical options such as Payback and Poison Jab, but they are weak and provide redundant coverage. Expert Belt is an option on most sets to bluff a Choice item, but without Life Orb, Mienshao will miss out on the crucial 2HKO on physically defensive Skarmory.</p> <p>As far as boosting options are concerned, Mienshao has access to Swords Dance, Bulk Up, Calm Mind, and Work Up, which the latter two can be put to use with special attacks such as Aura Sphere, Grass Knot, and Hidden Power on a special or mixed set. Bulk Up can be used to boost Mienshao's Defense along with its Attack, but powerful physical attacks from the likes of Terrakion will OHKO Mienshao even after a Bulk Up. All of these options can also be paired with Baton Pass to great effect. However, for the most part, Mienshao is too frail to make use of any of these options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Though solidly countering Mienshao can sometimes be difficult due to its access to U-turn and Baton Pass, there are several Pokemon that easily keep it in check. Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Jellicent come to mind immediately as they can switch in on High Jump Kick and cause Mienshao to lose 50% of its health, but the former must be wary of Stone Edge. Still, Choice Scarf Chandelure can trap and eliminate Mienshao as long as it switches in safely; Gengar, while it can't trap Mienshao, outspeeds and OHKOes with Shadow Ball too. Though rare, Golurk walls any Mienshao set without Hidden Power Ice cold, and can set up a Rock Polish as Mienshao switches out. Mienshao's poor defenses also make faster threats great checks as long as it isn't behind a Substitute; these include Latios, Thundurus, Terrakion, and Keldeo. Mienshao can OHKO or 2HKO a large portion of the metagame with its powerful attacks, but bulky attackers such as Latias can take any of its attacks and KO back with a STAB move. Gliscor walls any set without Hidden Power Ice cold and can also take boosted Stone Edge comfortably with its excellent physical bulk, 2HKOing in return with Earthquake. Finally, status such as paralysis or burn will also cripple Mienshao for the rest of the match, making bulky status inducers such as Jellicent and Jirachi great checks.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<p>Mienshao makes for a fantastic scout, momentum grabber, and offensive pivot that can also check some of the top threats in the metagame. Though dedicated leads are rarely used because of Team Preview, Mienshao functions very well as a lead in particular, giving you valuable early-game momentum. This set can be a great addition to dedicated VoltTurn teams, but it also functions as a good team glue in general. What really sets Mienshao apart from other U-turn users such as Scizor, however, is its access to Regenerator, as it can repeatedly come in, Fake Out for some residual damage, scout the opponent's next move with U-turn, and bring in the appropriate counter, healing off Life Orb recoil and other residual damage with Regenerator.</p> <p>Mienshao is one of the few fast threats with access to both Fake Out and U-turn, and the combination of these two moves is a potent scouting tool. Fake Out allows Mienshao to inflict free damage on most threats and pick off weakened faster opponents, also revealing the presence (or absence) of Leftovers recovery. This eases prediction immensely, as you can now judge whether or not Mienshao should switch out or stay in and fire off a powerful High Jump Kick. U-turn shifts the momentum in your favor, allowing you to scout the opponent's move and switch to a counter. It also deals heavy damage to Psychic-types such as Starmie and Latias switching in to soak up High Jump Kick. High Jump Kick is Mienshao's most powerful STAB move: it has an incredible 195 Base Power after STAB, and can 2HKO most neutral foes easily. However, Mienshao will lose 50% of its health if the opponent uses Protect or switches in a Ghost-type, meaning prediction is key when using High Jump Kick. This is compounded by the presence of Shadow Tag Chandelure in the metagame, which can trap, outspeed, and OHKO Mienshao if it is running a Choice Scarf. Running Stone Edge in the last moveslot rectifies this issue, as this allows Mienshao to KO Chandelure as it switches in while also destroying threats such as Volcarona. However, if Gliscor is a more problematic foe to your team, you can run Hidden Power Ice instead of Stone Edge to OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage; Mienshao can still escape from Chandelure with U-turn, allowing a teammate such as Tyranitar to trap it with Pursuit.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Mienshao's Attack and Speed, with the 4 remaining EVs invested in Special Defense to ensure that Genesect doesn't obtain a Special Attack boost upon switching in. A Speed-boosting nature is used so that Mienshao gets the jump on threats such as Garchomp, Jirachi, and Genesect while tying with other positive-natured Mienshao. Naive is preferred if Hidden Power Ice is used as Mienshao can still take U-turn and some of the weaker physical priority moves, like Ice Shard; Jolly is used otherwise. Substitute might appear to be a good option for easing prediction, but Mienshao will then have to give up either a coverage move or Fake Out, which will detract from the effectiveness of this set.</p> <p>Mienshao badly needs bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types out of the way so that it can sweep unhindered with High Jump Kick. A strong Pursuit user can help trap and eliminate these checks; Tyranitar comes to mind immediately, as it can trap Chandelure and Jellicent while also dealing with Psychic-types such as Latias. Mienshao isn't bothered by the sand which Tyranitar sets up either, as it has Regenerator to heal off the residual damage. Scizor, while ineffective against Chandelure, destroys Gengar and also packs a powerful STAB U-turn for maintaining offensive pressure and dealing heavy damage to bulky Psychic-types. A fast Choice Scarf user such as Latios or Terrakion can help deal with threats such as Thundurus that outspeed and KO Mienshao; such teammates can also clean up late-game once Mienshao has sufficiently weakened the opposition. Finally, entry hazard users such as Forretress and Ferrothorn also make good teammates, as they can set up entry hazards to ease up several OHKOs and 2HKOs for Mienshao while sponging most powerful attacks from potential counters with their good bulk.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf, Mienshao functions as a check to powerful boosting sweepers such as Volcarona, Thundurus, and Salamence as well as slower Choice Scarf users such as Genesect while retaining the ability to scout and pile up offensive pressure on the opponent. Unlike other Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, the presence of entry hazards does not particularly impede Mienshao, as it can repeatedly switch in and scout the opponent with U-turn, healing off any damage taken with Regenerator upon switching out. This gives Mienshao valued longevity and thus allows it to function as a offensive pivot for the majority of the game, although it must be careful when switching in as it takes heavy damage at the very least from most neutral STAB moves. Running a Choice Band is also an option, as Mienshao can then function as a wallbreaker that muscles through physical walls such as Skarmory while retaining a high Speed stat thanks to its good base 105 Speed.</p> <p>High Jump Kick is this set's main attraction, and for good reason. Once bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types have been removed, Mienshao can sweep unhindered with High Jump Kick, or at the very least, weaken the opposition to a point where its teammates can clean up the remains. U-turn is, as always, a highly useful move to have on a Choice set, gaining momentum and allowing Mienshao to deal heavy damage to Psychic-types switching in to take High Jump Kick. Stone Edge OHKOes common Chandelure switch-ins while also allowing Mienshao to take out sweepers such as Dragonite (after Stealth Rock) and Volcarona. Hidden Power Ice is purely for taking out Gliscor as it switches in, allowing Mienshao to sweep with High Jump Kick later. It goes without saying that caution should be exercised when using Hidden Power Ice, as Chandelure can still come in after a KO and use Mienshao as setup bait.</p> <p>Once again, the EV spread maximizes Mienshao's Attack and Speed, with a Naive nature being used so that Hidden Power Ice is not weakened. While it might be tempting to use an Adamant nature, particularly with Choice Band, this is not advised as Mienshao will then be revenge killed easily by Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp. Reckless is an option over Regenerator if you run a Choice Scarf to achieve the OHKO on Keldeo after Spikes damage, but the loss of Regenerator will drastically reduce Mienshao's longevity.</p> <p>This set's inability to switch moves makes Ghost-types such as Chandelure potent counters, particularly with High Jump Kick's deadly side effect. Thus, team support is all the more crucial to Mienshao's success. Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Scizor are once again great partners, as they can trap and eliminate the Ghost- and Psychic-types which act as roadblocks to Mienshao's sweep. Additionally, Tyranitar can set up Stealth Rock, enabling Mienshao to net the OHKO on Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice. Bulky physical walls such as Skarmory can also take a High Jump Kick and stall for a miss with Roost, meaning wallbreakers such as Salamence pair well with Mienshao. Dragon-types in general make good partners for this set, as they can take advantage of having the opponent's Steel-types removed and sweep with Outrage. Finally, entry hazard support is also highly useful, as it limits switching and weakens walls into Mienshao's KO range. Good candidates for this role include Forretress and Ferrothorn, who can take hits well with their excellent bulk, as well as Deoxys-S, if you are using Mienshao on an offensive team.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Terrakion's unique typing is formidable offensively, allowing it to break through many defensive walls. STAB Close Combat and Stone Edge are always very threatening, as they provide near-perfect coverage, hit monstrously hard, and can be used continuously without any loss of power. Terrakion can also hold its own defensively, and its resistance to Stealth Rock further adds to its practicality. Terrakion has many viable sets in the Dream World metagame, making it a versatile sweeper, even though it isn't used as much in Dream World as it is in BW OU, due to the legality of Shadow Tag Chandelure. Because of this threat, the Choice sets lose some viability, despite their ability to take out Chandelure with Stone Edge.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Work Up can allow Terrakion to hit Gliscor with a boosted Hidden Power Ice, but the use of Work Up itself gives away the surprise. Going mixed would also necessitate that Terrakion split its offensive EVs and reduce its defenses, which is off-putting as well. Taunt is another option that lets Terrakion set up against attempts to status it, but Substitute is far better as it also protects Terrakion from being revenge killed. Lum Berry lets it dodge status, which is always useful, while Chople Berry lets Terrakion take Fighting-type attacks from opposing Infernapes more easily (Terrakion is 2HKO'd by Close Combat with the Chople Berry), and Babiri Berry buffers Steel-type hits, such as Bullet Punches. The latter can be especially useful, as Terrakion is often prone to being revenge-killed by Bullet Punch. Double Kick gets STAB and hits  twice in a row, allowing Terrakion to break Substitutes and damage the opponent, but it is very situational. Reflect could help Terrakion set up more easily, while Safeguard lets your whole team dodge status, which is handy. Roar is an option to phaze away setup sweepers such as Chandelure. ChestoRest could work for one-time instant recovery.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gliscor and Slowbro are often pinpointed as the best counters to Terrakion. They can both come in on Close Combat, which won't damage them too much, and retaliate with a super effective STAB Earthquake and Scald respectively. However, +2 Rock Gem Stone Edge has a chance to OHKO Gliscor after Stealth Rock. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus can come in on a Close Combat or X-Scissor and take down Terrakion with Earthquake. As Terrakion outspeeds most of the Dream World metagame, priority is very useful to beat it; Scizor, Azumarill, and Breloom are the best picks here. Latios outspeeds unboosted Terrakion and can take  it out with a Psyshock; in addition, it can switch into a Close Combat, since it resists it. Bulky Psychic-types such as Reuniclus also do well, although they need to watch out for Choice Band X-Scissor. Jellicent is immune to Close Combat and can ruin Terrakion with Will-O-Wisp. SubDisable Gengar can also beat Choice Band Terrakion, but cannot switch into Stone Edge. Excadrill outspeeds unboosted Terrakion in sand, and can KO it with STAB Earthquake, although it can't switch into Close Combat. Terrakion also fears being trapped and revenge killed by Dugtrio, who outspeeds all variants bar Choice Scarf.</p> ",

Its amazing Speed, coupled with access to powerful moves, allows it to revenge kill several boosted  threats in the Dream World, such as the popular Choice Scarf Chandelure, +2 Dragonite, +1 Volcarona, as well as +1 Salamence. Close Combat is its main STAB move, while Stone Edge is used to hit Flying-types such as Tornadus super effectively. X-Scissor allows Terrakion to hit the Psychic-types that resist Close Combat, Terrakion's main move, hard. Terrakion's last move is based on preference; Earthquake can hit Jirachi, Tentacruel and Toxicroak for super effective damage; however, Sacred Sword is useful in situations where one does not want Terrakion's defenses lowered by Close Combat, if you're trying to land a 2HKO on a Pokemon who could hit you hard after the first hit. The drop in defenses could cause Terrakion to faint, so Sacred Sword would be the preferred option in similar situations.</p> <p>The EV spread lets Terrakion hit as hard and fast as possible, which is mandatory for a set whose purpose is to revenge kill at high speed. A Jolly nature is necessary, as it lets Terrakion outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus. An Adamant nature isn't recommended, as this Terrakion's main purpose is to revenge kill, not to sweep; moreover, running it means that it will also be outsped by Choice Scarf Landorus. Quick Attack can also be used, but without an item boost, it won't be damaging much at all.</p> <p>Breloom is a big threat to this set, as its Technician-boosted Mach Punch takes Terrakion down in one hit. As Chandelure can trap and take out Breloom due its immunity to Mach Punch and resistance to Bullet Seed, it is therefore a good teammate. Scizor threatens this set in a similar fashion, making Magnezone a good partner. It can come in easily on a Choice Band Scizor locked into Bullet Punch, and Substitute + Charge Beam variants can often KO another opponent after it dispatches Scizor.</p> <p>Opposing Chandelure are deadly to this Terrakion as well. As Terrakion cannot hurt Chandelure if it is locked into Close Combat, and cannot switch out on top of that, Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure can freely set up to +6 and rip your team apart. Tyranitar is a great teammate, as it can use Pursuit to trap and take out Chandelure as well as bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro, who would otherwise stand in Terrakion's way. In addition, it summons a sandstorm that boosts Terrakion's Special Defense, and can provide Stealth Rock support, which helps Terrakion take down Multiscale Dragonite in particular.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Terrakion is a Pokemon that will always be prone to being revenge killed by Breloom's Mach Punch and Scizor's Bullet Punch; it is also vulnerable to and crippled by all forms of status. For these reasons, it makes an effective Substitute user. As it poses a massive offensive threat, Terrakion can often easily switch into and scare out foes such as Tyranitar, and safely put up a Substitute. Substitute not only allows Terrakion to dodge status effects, but also grants Terrakion a free turn to either get a Swords Dance boost or take down an opponent. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, the Substitute lets Terrakion take a hit from faster opponents and then take them out. For example, Starmie, Alakazam, Breloom, and Scizor can break Terrakion's Substitute, but they would then be forced to take a strong, often fatal, hit in return.</p> <p>The moveset is fairly straightforward; Substitute and Swords Dance both help Terrakion sweep with its two best STAB moves, Close Combat and Stone Edge. The combination of Rock and Fighting provides near-perfect coverage in the Dream World metagame, meaning that Terrakion doesn't even need any other moves. Close Combat enables it to muscle through defensive walls such as Ferrothorn, while Stone Edge lets it beat Chandelure, Dragonite, Salamence, and Volcarona. The boost provided by Swords Dance elevates Terrakion's Attack stat to an impressive 714, which lets it threaten even the standard Gliscor with an OHKO.</p> <p>Terrakion's Attack and Speed are maximized as they are the only stats worth investing in. A Jolly nature is used so that Terrakion outspeeds Landorus, Keldeo, Infernape, and Virizion. Besides, Swords Dance already skyrockets Terrakion's Attack stat to ridiculous heights, so the extra Attack is generally unneeded. Rock Gem lets +2 Terrakion OHKO the standard Gliscor after Stealth Rock. The lack of Life Orb recoil can also let Terrakion bluff a Choice Band or Choice Scarf, which can possibly allow it to lure in and take out Chandelure. Alternatively, Leftovers provides recovery to mitigate the HP loss from Substitute. Life Orb is a final option to let Terrakion consistently hit harder, instead of doing massive damage just once with a Rock Gem.</p> <p>Wish support is very helpful, as Terrakion will be taking damage from Substitute and possibly Life Orb recoil very frequently. Chansey and Blissey should be the main candidates for this role, as they can also sponge specially based Psychic-type attacks directed towards Terrakion. Chandelure can trap and eliminate Breloom, while Magnezone can do the same to Scizor. The sandstorm Tyranitar summons gives Terrakion a Special Defense boost, letting its Substitute withstand Jellicent's Scald. However, note that the latter two Pokemon compound Terrakion's Fighting weakness. On that note, Latias is a good partner for its amazing synergy with Terrakion.</p> "

Access to both Swords Dance and Rock Polish gives Terrakion the option to double either its Attack or Speed, letting it flourish in a wide variety of situations. For example, Rock Polish lets Terrakion sweep a team of fast, frail Pokemon, while Swords Dance ramps up its power considerably and allows it to leave many dents in even teams of relatively slower and bulkier Pokemon. In fact, if Terrakion manages to nab both boosts and opposing priority users are KOed, it's pretty much game over. All in all, if used correctly, Double Dance Terrakion is easily one of the deadliest sweepers in the metagame.</p> <p>This Terrakion can utilize a variety of items. Air Balloon grants it a temporary immunity to Ground-type moves, possibly letting it set up against Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus; it is also incredibly useful against the likes of Gliscor, as the additional Swords Dance boost will let Terrakion take it down. Furthermore, the Air Balloon allows Terrakion to beat Excadrill in a one-on-one situation under sandstorm. While it breaks Terrakion's Balloon and fails to OHKO, Terrakion can use Rock Polish to boost its Speed, then take Excadrill out with Close Combat. Life Orb isn't a bad choice either, as it allows Terrakion an extra boost in power, which can come in handy if it doesn't manage to nab an Attack boost.</p> <p>The nature choice is also a difficult one to make. An Adamant nature is helpful in cases where you'd want to boost your own Speed with Rock Polish. A Jolly nature, though, gives you a more consistent Speed stat throughout the match, when you don't have any boosts up, especially as an Adamant one leaves you open to be outsped by the likes of Keldeo, Infernape and Virizion. Again, it's based on preference and suiting your team's needs. If your team can deal with the above threats, you can run an Adamant nature without any problems.</p> <p>With regards to partners, Tyranitar stands out as Terrakion appreciates the 50% Special Defense boost sandstorm grants it. Tyranitar can also bring Stealth Rock support to the table, allowing Terrakion to deal with Volcarona and Dragonite more easily. The latter's Multiscale gets broken by sandstorm as well, which can prove very helpful. Landorus is also a great fellow sandstorm sweeper thanks to Sheer Force. Furthermore, Hidden Power Ice variants can lure in and take out Gliscor, opening Terrakion to an easier sweep. Bulky variants of Gyarados help against Scizor, Metagross, and Breloom, as Intimidate lowers their Attack, leaving them unable to do much in return; Gyarados can also tank Fighting-type hits.</p> "

Choice Band boosts Terrakion's power to incredible heights, allowing it to muscle through anything that does not resist it. Even Skarmory, the standard for physical walling, will hate switching into a STAB Close Combat. Stone Edge, Terrakion's secondary STAB move, takes care of Dragonite and Volcarona, two huge threats in the Dream World metagame. X-Scissor eliminates pesky Psychic-types such as Latias, Latios, Reuniclus, and Slowbro, all of whom might switch in hoping to sponge a Close Combat. Sacred Sword is an inferior Close Combat because the power difference is considerable. Quick Attack is interesting: although it is weak, it does decent damage with a Choice Band, and it lets Terrakion eliminate weakened Choice Scarf revenge killers and boosted sweepers.</p> <p>Earthquake can be used over either move slashed in the last  slot, as it hits Jirachi, Toxicroak, and Tentacruel super effectively.  However, Close Combat provides more than enough coverage, and as such  isn't really necessary. The EV spread is straightforward, as its main  purpose is to sweep. While a Jolly nature is recommended as it lets  Terrakion outspeed Jolly Landorus, an Adamant nature isn't completely  worthless, as it enables Terrakion to 2HKO walls such as Gliscor with Stone Edge.</p> <p>The main problem this set faces is being locked into a single move. If it's locked into Close Combat, SubDisable Gengar can force it to switch and get a free Substitute in the process. As specially defensive Jirachi lets you beat the aforementioned Gengar, it makes a good teammate. Chandelure can also come in on Terrakion locked into Close Combat, set up a Substitute, boost up with Calm Mind, and proceed to demolish your team. It is recommended you get rid of Chandelure before sending out Terrakion for a sweep, making Pursuit users such as Tyranitar excellent partners. Dragonite is also an ideal partner as it can not only take Fighting-type attacks but also wall Chandelure and eliminate it with Earthquake. Breloom can revenge kill this Terrakion with Mach Punch, but it can be taken out by Choice Scarf Chandelure. Chandelure can also trap and get rid of both Scizor and Gengar.</p> "

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus is enjoying free reign as one of the Pokemon brought down from Ubers to participate in the DW OU metagame. Top-notch mixed offenses and a fantastic base 111 Speed, along with a movepool that contains everything it needs, will keep Thundurus a top contender for a long time. While a weakness to Stealth Rock does no favors for Thundurus, it is mitigated by the fact that Thundurus is immune to Ground-type attacks, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. Prankster was a gift bestowed upon Thundurus, giving it priority Taunt and Thunder Wave. Low bulk and weakness to Stealth Rock are the major problems Thundurus has, but with proper team support, Thundurus can shine.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swift Swim teams should consider using Thundurus as a Rain Dance setter; Thundurus can even take advantage of the rain itself with Thunder. Torment is an option to mess with and annoy the opponent, especially in combination with Substitute, as Pokemon such as Excadrill and Jirachi have only one attack capable of breaking Thundurus's Substitutes. Once again, though, it is often a waste of a moveslot in comparison to Thundurus's other options. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types more reliably than Focus Blast, but it requires forgoing the coverage Hidden Power Ice provides, and is weakened by rain. Dark Pulse is an option to hit Latios, but is generally a waste.</p> <p>Agility can remedy Thundurus's problems with Choice Scarf users, but Thundurus's attacks will lack the punch that Nasty Plot provide. A double boosting set on the other hand requires too many turns to set up, and also suffers from the loss of coverage moves. Bulk Up can be used for a physical set, with Brick Break and Wild Charge as attacks. However, Thundurus has a higher Special Attack stat, and is outclassed by most physical attackers; furthermore, Wild Charge has hindering recoil. Choice Specs can turn Thundurus into a hard-hitting special attacker, and Choice Band makes it a strong physical attacker. Choice Scarf might seem tempting, but it is outclassed in this role by other Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Terrakion, which have better movepools for the role, along with better coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gastrodon, Blissey, and Chansey are Thundurus's main counters, as they can sponge all of Thundurus's common attacks, can recover off the damage, and deal with Thundurus either directly or with status moves. Quagsire ignores the Nasty Plot set's boosts and so can deal with it. As with most other Choice Scarf users, Rotom-W can switch in on the Nasty Plot and KO it with a rain-boosted Hydro Pump. Excadrill causes huge problems to Thundurus, switching in for free on Thunderbolt and outspeeding in sand to OHKO with Rock Slide; Choice Scarf Garchomp and Landorus can similarly switch in and KO with Stone Edge. Choice Scarf Tyranitar can surprise Thundurus by bluffing a standard set, only to outspeed and Stone Edge for the KO. Raikou can also function as a decent check, as it is immune to Thundurus's Electric-type moves and outspeeds, forcing Thundurus to rely on a 70% accurate Focus Blast.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<p>This set is Thundurus's bread and butter, the reason it was banned from OU. The idea is to stack hazards, take out the opponent's Choice Scarf user, beat the opponent's special wall, set up Nasty Plot, and sweep. High Special Attack and Speed stats make Thundurus an ideal candidate for the job. Switching in on a support Pokemon or something Thundurus forces out, such as Breloom or Jellicent, is ideal, allowing Thundurus to grab a Nasty Plot on the switch. After a Nasty Plot, Thundurus hits a sky-high 698 Special Attack stat, which, alongside its excellent coverage, lets it plow through the entire metagame.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is of course the primary option if you are not running rain support, and still hits insanely hard. Hidden Power Ice complements Thunderbolt with coverage on the common Grass- and Ground-types in the tier, such as Serperior and Gliscor, and Focus Blast grants Thundurus super effective coverage on Ferrothorn and Tyranitar. Substitute is an option with Leftovers for a deadly Substitute + Nasty Plot set. It prevents status, specifically Thunder Wave and Toxic, and Substitute can be used in lieu of Protect, scouting out the opponent's next move. Taunt can also be used in a similar vein to Taunt + Dragon Dance Haxorus. It helps Thundurus set up on Jirachi and Ferrothorn, who otherwise pose a major pain thanks to Thunder Wave. Body Slam is still an issue with Jirachi, however, so it is best to determine if it has Body Slam or Thunder Wave before attempting to use Taunt. Taunt also prevents Breloom from setting up on Thundurus, which can be very helpful if Breloom lacks Stone Edge.</p> <p>Thunder is the best choice if you can provide rain support, as it will just about OHKO everything that does not resist it, bar Tyranitar, Blissey, and Chansey. Grass Knot is an option to hit Gastrodon and Quagsire, who are not troubled by Thundurus's other moves. Life Orb offers a power boost while Leftovers grants extra survivability. Leftovers is the recommended item for Thundurus on a sand team. Lum Berry can also be used to prevent paralysis, Toxic, and Spore, giving Thundurus more opportunities to set up.</p> <p>The one thing that most hinders Thundurus from sweeping is Stealth Rock. When factoring in Life Orb recoil and possible sandstorm damage, Stealth Rock ruins Thundurus's day and drastically shortens its sweep. Because of this, a Rapid Spin user is very helpful to Thundurus. The best choice is Starmie, who provides excellent complementary offense with Thundurus as well. Chandelure is great for trapping common Choice Scarf users, particularly Terrakion locked into Close Combat, and generally troublesome Pokemon that like to ruin Thundurus's day, such as Quagsire, Tyranitar, and Lucario.</p> <p>As Thundurus resists common priority attacks, they are not an issue, but Choice Scarf users definitely are. When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Terrakion, Chandelure, Tyranitar, and Genesect can all take advantage of Thundurus's relative frailty and pick it off. Dual screens are amazing in helping Thundurus set up; Deoxys-S and Espeon come to mind as the best ones. Paralysis support is another option to deal with Choice Scarf users, and is generously provided by Ferrothorn, who also happens to be able to set up hazards to help Thundurus's sweep. Politoed support is great for providing the rain that allows Thundurus to run Thunder.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Thundurus also has a good 115 Attack, with which it can take down its common checks, namely Blissey and Tyranitar. With mixed attacking stats, Thundurus can function as an excellent wallbreaker, weakening opposing teams for its teammates to sweep. Thundurus can be a great powerhouse with this set, and its effectiveness can sometimes eclipse even the powerful Nasty Plot set.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is Thundurus's main STAB move for its power and reliability. Hammer Arm allows Thundurus to OHKO non-Chople Berry Tyranitar and 2HKO Blissey, as well as severely dent Terrakion. Hidden Power Ice is the best coverage move available to Thundurus, complementing its other moves very well by hitting the Dragon-types that resist its other moves. The last slot is a bit of a toss-up. Volt Switch is a great option particularly for VoltTurn offense teams, and also allows Thundurus to maintain offensive pressure if faced with a counter. U-turn functions similarly, with the advantage of hitting Ground-types such as Garchomp and Excadrill, who are common switch-ins to Thundurus. Taunt can be used to screw over walls attempting to paralyze or set up hazards on Thundurus, and also stops Dragon Dance boosters in their tracks. It also cripples Deoxys-S, but backfires if Deoxys-S uses Magic Coat.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is always an option for quick paralysis, which could potentially save your team from a rampaging Blaziken. Grass Knot can be used to lure and remove Gastrodon and Quagsire. The item choice depends on Thundurus's role on the team: Life Orb should be used for maximum power, with the added bonus of OHKOing Tyranitar; Expert Belt is also a great item since Thundurus has excellent super effective coverage. In general, Life Orb lets it be the best possible wallbreaker, while Expert Belt grants better longevity. Leftovers can always be used for recovery, as can Substitute to block attacks and status.</p> <p>This set lacks the sweeping potential of Nasty Plot, so its teammates need to pick up the slack. Entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock and Spikes, are also needed to make this set work, as they enable Thundurus to nab crucial kills, such as on Jellicent and Vaporeon; this makes Excadrill and Garchomp good partners. Chansey defeats this set, being able to Softboiled off the damage from Hammer Arm and stall out Thundurus with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Gastrodon and Quagsire still do a great job with beating Thundurus. Breloom deals with all three of them, KOing them or forcing them out with its dual STABs and fearing nothing except for a Scald burn or Ice Beam from Gastrodon. Politoed can provide rain support so that Thundurus can run Thunder.</p> "

        "name": "Prankster",
        "description": "<p>With its Prankster ability, Thundurus's non-attacking moves gain priority. This makes Thundurus a quick check to a Dragon Dance sweeper or something continually stalling with Substitutes or status moves. The ability to go first, outspeeding even most other Prankster users, gives Thundurus the advantage over bulkier alternatives. In general, this set's main purpose is to be a last-ditch stop to threatening sweepers, and maybe get some attacks off if it finds the time.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is the crux of the set, and the reason why Prankster Thundurus is so good. It can be a game-saving clutch against a DragonDancer or Choice Scarf user that your team cannot overcome because of its high Speed; it can also cause paralysis hax, giving Thundurus more opportunities to attack. Thunderbolt is a reliable STAB move. Hidden Power Ice is Thundurus's best possible coverage move, while as on all Thundurus sets, the last slot is a toss-up. Taunt is the primary option to shut down status spreaders such as Jirachi and Jellicent, and prevent boosting Pokemon from setting up further. Volt Switch or U-turn can make Thundurus an effective scout, while Hammer Arm can be used for coverage on Tyranitar and Blissey—of course, be sure to use a Naive nature and 4 Attack EVs if using Hammer Arm or U-turn.</p> <p>If you have rain support, run Thunder. This set will often die in one hit as a sacrifice to get off that one Thunder Wave or Taunt, but its special attacking capabilities should not be forgotten, and abused to their full potential. In fact, it should still be played offensively in general, but cautiously if Team Preview reveals a threat it may need to deal with.</p> <p>This set is countered by Blissey and Chansey, as well as Gastrodon and Quagsire, who are immune to Thunder Wave and take basically nothing from its attacks. A Focus Sash can be used to allow a full health Thundurus to live an otherwise fatal attack, but is not recommended because it requires that entry hazards be kept off the field at all times. Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi is an amazing partner to this set, as it enjoys setting up on and sweeping paralyzed opponents. Adamant Choice Band Terrakion is perhaps the Pokemon that benefits most from the support this Thundurus provides, abusing the paralyzed opposition to alleviate its Speed issues, and OHKOing most opponents. Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure also benefits from paralyzed opponents due to its low Speed stat. Politoed are great for rain support. Choice Scarf Politoed in particular is useful because it can come in and revenge kill Excadrill, who is immune to the main point of this set—paralysis—and can KO Thundurus with Rock Slide. Choice Scarf Garchomp poses a similar problem, so Bronzong and Skarmory are great teammates.</p> "

  "Landorus": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus is an underrated but deadly threat in the DW metagame. Its main selling points are its excellent abilities, Sand Force and Sheer Force. Sand Force boosts Earthquake's and Stone Edge's power to insane levels in the sand, making Landorus a fearsome sand sweeper, while Sheer Force boosts many of Landorus's special moves and prevents Life Orb recoil when using them. This makes it a diverse threat that can be used effectively outside of sandstorm as well. Landorus also has impressive offensive stats and a good movepool to utilize its great abilities with: base 125 Attack, base 115 Special Attack, base 101 Speed, and access to fantastic boosting moves such as Swords Dance and Rock Polish, as well as a powerful STAB Earthquake.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Landorus finds itself struggling to keep up with Garchomp and Excadrill, both of whom have better typing and stats, as well as ability in Excadrill's case. Its weaknesses to common Water- and Ice-type attacks also allow threats such as Genesect to take it down with ease. Don't be afraid to give Landorus a try though; if played to its strengths, the land genie can rip through teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Landorus actually has a pretty diverse movepool, and as such, it has plenty of other options. Smack Down is one of the better ones, as it actually allows Landorus to defeat its worst enemies: Skarmory and Bronzong. However, that's its only use, so whether it's worth a moveslot is questionable. Explosion is also a decent option to go down with a bang, but the nerf it received this generation limits its effectiveness. Landorus also gets Bulk Up, but the Defense boost isn't that helpful, as it already resists common physical attacks; besides, Swords Dance provides a greater boost to Attack. Landorus also has access to Grass Knot, which can be used to take down bulky Water-types such as Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Slowbro. However, it has no other use, so finding a slot for it is difficult. Another possible set would be a Double Dance set with Swords Dance and Rock Polish, but Terrakion generally outclasses Landorus in this role. Lastly, Expert Belt can be used to fake a Choice item and surprise Gliscor, but the loss of power can cause Landorus to miss out on key KOs.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Landorus's best checks are Skarmory and Bronzong, which can take any attack and retaliate with Hidden Power Ice and Brave Bird. However, they need to be wary of the rare Smack Down as they switch in, as Landorus can then KO with Earthquake. Hippowdon also makes a decent check, as it is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and can strike back with Ice Fang. Aside from these three, Landorus's counters depend on what set it is running. Gliscor can beat any Landorus without Hidden Power Ice, especially if it has Ice Fang. Choice Scarf Genesect can take down any Landorus without a Speed boost. Blissey and Chansey can take on the special variant, but need to watch out for Hammer Arm. Intimidate Gyarados is also a decent counter, as a Sand Force-boosted Stone Edge can only do 91% max after Intimidate, whereas an unboosted Waterfall KOs most of the time after Stealth Rock. Finally, the many threats that can outspeed Landorus, such as Keldeo, Garchomp, and offensive Deoxys-S, can beat non-Choice Scarf variants or ones without a Rock Polish boost.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Physical Sweeper",
        "description": "<p>This is one of Landorus's deadliest sets, and for good reason. With access to Rock Polish and Swords Dance, Landorus becomes an unpredictable sweeper that only needs a turn of setup to pull off a sweep. Rock Polish is the preferred option, as Landorus already has plenty of power and the extra Speed can help it outspeed many common threats, such as Genesect, Deoxys-S, Excadrill, Garchomp, Keldeo, and Thundurus, all of whom could revenge kill Landorus otherwise. However, Swords Dance can be used to tear through defensive teams with Landorus's raw power. Earthquake and Stone Edge are obvious choices as they receive a boost from Sand Force and have phenomenal coverage together. The last move is a toss-up between Substitute and Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Ice is the preferred option, as it can be used to OHKO Gliscor with Life Orb. Substitute is also viable, as it shields Landorus from status such as burn or poison that could halt its sweep. It also allows Landorus to scout the opponent and safely KO faster threats such as Genesect after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Sand Force is the preferred ability, boosting the Base Power of both Earthquake and Stone Edge in the sand. However, if you're not running Landorus on a sand team, Sheer Force is a fine alternative, as the prospect of not receiving Life Orb recoil is certainly nice. If you run Sheer Force, using Rock Slide over Stone Edge is an option, as Rock Slide has only 20 less Base Power with Sheer Force and 10% more accuracy, making it more reliable. Life Orb is the item of choice here, as the extra power is highly appreciated. Leftovers is a viable option though for more longevity, especially if you use Substitute. A Jolly (or Hasty if you're using Hidden Power) nature is used to prevent Pokemon around the base 100 Speed threshold from outspeeding Landorus. The given EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed, allowing you to make the most of Landorus's niche 101 Speed. However, if Rock Polish is used, a spread of 104 HP / 252 Atk / 152 Spe is acceptable if you want more bulk; Landorus can still outspeed Adamant Excadrill in the sand after a Rock Polish with an Attack-boosting nature, or even Jolly Excadrill if Landorus uses Jolly or Naive. Be careful with this spread though, as without the Rock Polish boost you will be outsped by many common threats, like Genesect. Hammer Arm is a decent option for hitting Air Balloon users such as Heatran; however, Fighting / Ground coverage is redundant, and it will thus not have any other use. In the same vein, Brick Break is an option instead of Hammer Arm on the Swords Dance set to avoid the Speed drop.</p> <p>Landorus loves to be in a sandstorm to use its Sand Force ability, so a Sand Stream user makes a good partner for Landorus. Tyranitar is the best choice, as it can take out Skarmory and Bronzong, two of the biggest counters to Landorus, while also setting up Stealth Rock to ease Landorus's sweep. Should you opt not to run Fire Blast on Tyranitar or use Tyranitar at all, Chandelure makes an excellent partner, as it can eliminate Skarmory and Bronzong with ease. Landorus also hates that 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks, so a teammate that can absorb those attacks is great. Vaporeon can be of aid here, as it can not only take those attacks, but also provide Wish support, greatly increasing Landorus's longevity. Chansey and Blissey are also good partners if you choose Swords Dance, as they can provide Thunder Wave support, slowing down dangerous threats such as Latios and Choice Scarf Genesect who would otherwise destroy him. They can also provide Wish support and take Ice- and Water-type attacks.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Special Sweeper",
        "description": "<p>Although Landorus is usually viewed as a physical sweeper, one must not forget that it actually has a usable base 115 Special Attack. Add Sheer Force and the special movepool to use it, and you have a dangerous, albeit underrated, threat. Rock Polish is the preferred boosting move, as Landorus has plenty of power thanks to Sheer Force and thus appreciates a Speed boost more. Calm Mind is an option for more power (and less importantly, Special Defense), but the added power isn't all that useful. It does nab the KO on defensive variants of Dragonite and Tyranitar, as well as OHKOing Hippowdon, but leaves Landorus outsped by a slew of threats. You also lose the surprise value, as the moment you use Calm Mind, the opponent will know you're running a special set. STAB, Sheer Force-boosted Earth Power deals heavy damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Psychic hits the plethora of Fighting-types in the metagame hard, particularly Breloom, who resists Earth Power; it too gets a Sheer Force boost. Hidden Power Ice is the best choice for the last slot, OHKOing Gliscor and even Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage. Don't forget though that a neutral Earth Power is actually more powerful than a 2x effective Hidden Power Ice. Finally, if Blissey, Chansey, and Air Balloon users worry you more, Hammer Arm is an acceptable option in the fourth moveslot to handle them.</p> <p>Life Orb should always be run on this set, as an extra 30% boost on Earth Power and Psychic with no recoil is just too good to pass up. A Timid (or Hasty nature with Hammer Arm) should always be used to best utilize Landorus's base 101 Speed. As for the EV spread, there are quite a few options. The above spread is the best, as it maximizes power while allowing Landorus to outspeed common base 100s without a boost. However, a spread of 104 HP / 252 SpA / 152 Spe gives a little more bulk while allowing Landorus to outspeed Excadrill in the sand after a boost. If using Hammer Arm, you will need to run 200 Attack EVs to 2HKO Chansey with it 100% of the time. However, a spread of 104 Atk / 252 SpA / 152 Spe still does 46.59 - 54.82% to it, which in most scenarios is usually good enough.</p> <p>Landorus actually has a few more options to run on this set. Focus Blast is an option, as with the Sheer Force boost, it becomes insanely powerful. However, Fighting- and Ground-type attacks are fairly redundant coverage-wise, and Hammer Arm has more utility, making Focus Blast inferior. Oddly enough, Landorus also gets Sludge Wave, which can be used to hit Celebi. Unfortunately, its power just isn't worth the terrible coverage it provides.</p> <p>Unlike Landorus's other sets, this one doesn't require sandstorm support to be effective. In fact, this even makes a good sandstorm counter. The best sandstorm sweeper, Excadrill, fails to KO even after a Swords Dance, whereas Landorus can easily KO in return with Earth Power. Other common Pokemon found on sand teams, like Garchomp, Terrakion, Sandslash, and Chandelure, are all OHKOed by either Earth Power or Hidden Power Ice. Even Tyranitar and Hippowdon are 2HKOed by Earth Power. Also, Landorus can take out Blissey and Chansey if it runs Hammer Arm, making special sweepers that appreciate them removed, like Manaphy and Volcarona, good choices to pair with Landorus. As for supporting Landorus itself, Vaporeon makes a great partner, as it can take Ice- and Water-type hits and provide handy Wish support. Another good partner is Chandelure; it can eliminate Steel-types like Bronzong, whereas Landorus can take down those sand sweepers that threaten Chandelure's existence. Landorus also makes a great lure, as most people expect a physical set. Rock Polish helps the illusion even more, as most Landorus that run Rock Polish will be physical. As such, pairing Landorus with powerful physical sweepers works well. Excadrill and Garchomp work especially well, as they will be run in sandstorm, further convincing the opponent that Landorus is running the physical set.</p> "

However, Landorus does have one thing over those two, and that is U-turn. U-turn turns Landorus into an excellent scout, allowing it to scout for counters and eliminate them. When not U-turning, Earthquake will be Landorus's primary attack, as it's reliable, powerful, and receives STAB and Sand Force boosts. Stone Edge is another powerful option that forms the \"EdgeQuake\" combo, giving Landorus great coverage. Hidden Power Ice is for taking out Gliscor and Dragonite, whereas Hammer Arm beats Air Balloon users such as Heatran.</p> <p>The biggest decision with this set is whether to use a Choice Scarf or Choice Band. Choice Scarf is generally the better option, as it allows Landorus to serve as an excellent scout. Sand Force also boosts Earthquake and Stone Edge, meaning it can sweep late-game if needed. Choice Band can be used for the great power it offers and the surprise factor, as most opponents will expect Landorus to run a Choice Scarf; however, Landorus will no longer be able to function as a speedy scout, which is one of its main niches.</p> <p>Sand Stream support is highly appreciated, as it gives Landorus a much needed Sand Force boost. Tyranitar is the best option, as it can set up Stealth Rock and fry Skarmory and Bronzong with Fire Blast. Rotom-W makes a great partner for this set, as it not only absorbs Ice- and Water-type attacks, but also forms a VoltTurn core and beats Skarmory. Rapid Spin support is appreciated for this set, as it will be switching frequently. Starmie makes a great choice, taking hits Landorus can't take as well as frying Skarmory with Thunderbolt. Forretress works too, as it can provide hazard support to punish the switches the opponent will be making.</p> "

Its high base 120 Special Attack and Attack stats, coupled with access to Download and a plethora of powerful offensive options such as Flamethrower, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Bug Buzz, and U-turn, make it a fearsome offensive threat that can run a variety of sets, ranging from Choice Scarf to even Rock Polish. Genesect's Bug / Steel typing gives it a whopping nine resistances and one immunity to go with its decent 71 / 95 / 95 defenses, meaning it gets many opportunities to switch in and wreak havoc. Unfortunately, Game Freak gave Genesect a rage-inducing base 99 Speed, leaving it narrowly outsped by common threats such as Garchomp, Manaphy, and Jirachi. Genesect is also vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards save for Toxic Spikes, and a 4x weakness to Fire-type attacks doesn't help either. Don't let these flaws deter you from using Genesect, however, as this powerful mecha bug can be a great asset to almost any team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With Genesect's enormous movepool, it should hardly come as a surprise that it has a large number of other options to consider. A Choice Specs set can dish out heavy damage, particularly with a Special Attack boost from Download, but it is walled easily and forced out by faster threats such as Latios and Thundurus. Hidden Power Ground is usable on any set to net a surprise KO on common Heatran switch-ins, but it does little else. Explosion might seem like a good option to deal heavy damage to Blissey, but its nerf makes it a bad option, and U-turn already hurts the pink blob significantly. Quick Attack is Genesect's only form of priority and can be used as a last-ditch attempt to finish off a weakened, faster opponent. Genesect also has access to special attacks such as Shadow Ball, Tri Attack, Psychic, and Energy Ball, but they provide redundant coverage with the moves listed on the above sets. Techno Blast is Genesect's signature move, but if you think it is viable and wish to run it along with a Douse Drive, then a visit to the psychiatrist is certainly in order; Water-type Techno Blast is weaker than by Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Water.</p> <p>Genesect has several other boosting moves up its sleeve, but these are mostly unusable: Flame Charge is completely outclassed by Rock Polish, Charge Beam is weak and unreliable, while running a physical or even a mixed Hone Claws set is a sheer waste of Genesect's special attacking prowess. Finally, Genesect has access to Thunder Wave to cripple fast threats as they switch in, but it is better off just attacking.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>With Genesect's fantastic coverage and access to U-turn, keeping it in check rather than trying to flat-out counter it will generally yield better results. Choice Scarf Chandelure can trap and eliminate non-Choice sets, but it must be careful while switching in as it will take heavy damage from +1 Thunderbolt. Quite a few special tanks can also take all of Genesect's attacks with ease and force it out. Chansey, and to a lesser extent Blissey, comes to mind immediately, as it can sponge pretty much any special attack with its titanic special bulk while still soaking up a +1 U-turn comfortably; in return, it can cripple Genesect with Thunder Wave or wear it down with Seismic Toss. Specially defensive Heatran, while destroyed by Hidden Power Ground, isn't OHKOed by even a +1 Life Orb-boosted Thunderbolt, and can incinerate Genesect with its STAB Fire-type attacks. Tyranitar takes heavy damage from U-turn, but it can sponge all of Genesect's other attacks and destroy it with Fire Blast.</p> <p>Exploiting Genesect's base 99 Speed is another great way of checking it. While it does have decent defensive stats, Genesect will still fold to any powerful neutral STAB attack after some residual damage, and it is also vulnerable to both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Having entry hazards on the field will thus put the mecha bug between a rock and a hard place, especially if you also pack a fast, powerful Choice Scarf user such as Terrakion or Hidden Power Fire Latios to force Genesect out. Offensive Deoxys-S can revenge kill Genesect as well, as it outspeeds even the Choice Scarf set and OHKOes with Fire Punch or Hidden Power Fire. Lastly, Choice Scarf Magnezone with Hidden Power Fire works in a similar manner to Chandelure, but Choice Scarf Genesect can still outspeed and OHKO with Flamethrower.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>While Genesect falls agonizingly short of the magic base 100 Speed tier, it can still put a Choice Scarf set to great use with its base 99 Speed, outspeeding threats such as Dragonite, Haxorus, and Gyarados after a Dragon Dance. What makes this set so dangerous is Genesect's access to Download, a slew of coverage moves, and STAB U-turn, making it hard to counter. Thanks to its numerous resistances, Genesect can repeatedly switch in safely, obtain a Download boost, and scout the opponent's move with U-turn or fire off a powerful attack. Unlike Scizor, Genesect can deal heavy damage to bulky threats such as Skarmory and Jellicent which are common switch-ins to U-turn, while still outspeeding a major portion of the metagame. Once faster checks have been eliminated, Genesect can also sweep a weakened team late-game if it obtains a Special Attack boost.</p> <p>U-turn makes Genesect a powerful momentum grabber that can break down walls with ease; with STAB and an Attack boost from Download, it can deal heavy damage to a wide range of threats, even those that resist it. It also eases prediction early-game, as Genesect can hit the switch-in hard and go to a counter. Ice Beam takes out Dragon-type threats such as Dragonite and Garchomp, while Flamethrower roasts Steel-types such as Skarmory looking to sponge U-turn. Finally, Thunderbolt takes out Water-types such as Keldeo and Jellicent which can take Genesect's other moves, gets a hard hit on Chandelure, and gives Genesect BoltBeam coverage. However, Bug Buzz can be used over either of Thunderbolt or Flamethrower for a strong special STAB with which to clean up late-game.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Genesect's Special Attack and Speed, with a Speed-boosting nature being used to make the most of Genesect's unique Speed tier. A Hasty nature is preferred to soak up resisted Dragon-type moves such as Latios's Draco Meteor, but Naive is also an option to better take powerful physical priority attacks such as Mach Punch. It should also be noted that, depending on your team, some EVs can be shifted from Special Attack to Attack to obtain the OHKO on certain threats with U-turn: 68 EVs (with an Attack boost) for Serperior, 104 EVs for Deoxys-S, and 112 EVs (with an Attack boost) for Latios. If you don't wish to lower Genesect's defenses, running a Timid nature is also an option, though this will significantly lower U-turn's power.</p> <p>Genesect loves having entry hazards on the opponent's field, as this wears down its counters and makes it hard for them to repeatedly soak up its attacks. Forretress and Ferrothorn are great choices for this role; they compound Genesect's Fire-type weakness though, so Deoxys-S is also an option. Rapid Spin support is recommended as Genesect needs to switch in multiple times and is vulnerable to entry hazards. Heatran is a huge pain for this set to deal with, meaning powerful attackers that can take it out, such as Terrakion and Garchomp, make great teammates. Dugtrio in particular is an excellent partner, as Genesect can U-turn out of a Heatran switch-in and pop its Air Balloon, allowing Dugtrio to trap and OHKO Heatran with Earthquake. Volt Switch users such as Rotom-W and Raikou are also great offensive partners, especially if you are using Genesect on a VoltTurn team. Genesect can also be used as a part of a VoltTurn core on a rain team, since the rain somewhat mitigates its Fire-type weakness and allows it to run Thunder over Thunderbolt, making Politoed a good teammate; do note though that Bug Buzz should be used over Flamethrower.</p> "

        "name": "Rock Polish",
        "description": "<p>Genesect can run a very dangerous Rock Polish set, sweeping late-game once its counters have been weakened. It sits at a frightening 606 Speed after a Rock Polish, outspeeding even Jolly Excadrill in the sand; this ensures that fast Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Latios will not be able to rain on Genesect's parade. Obtaining a Rock Polish boost is not too difficult, either, when you consider the number of switches that Genesect forces; it can easily switch into a physical wall such as Skarmory, snag a Special Attack boost thanks to Download, and set up Rock Polish as the opponent switches. As an added plus, Genesect resists priority moves such as Ice Shard and Extreme Speed, and even Mach Punch from the likes of Breloom and Conkeldurr will not OHKO it.</p> <p>Flamethrower, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt are Genesect's primary attacking options, covering a wide range of common threats in the metagame and giving it perfect neutral coverage. However, Bug Buzz can be used over Thunderbolt in the last moveslot as Genesect loves having a powerful STAB option to sweep weakened teams with.</p> <p>As Genesect is not running any physical attacks, simply maximizing its Special Attack and Speed and using a Timid nature is the way to go. The remaining 4 EVs are invested in Special Defense to ensure that opposing Genesect only get an Attack boost in the rare case that they switch in. Don't even consider using Leftovers on this set; the power boost offered by Life Orb to all of Genesect's attacks is too good to pass up. If you are running Genesect on a rain team, Thunder and Bug Buzz should be used instead of Thunderbolt and Flamethrower, respectively.</p> <p>Since this set is to be used only as a late-game sweeper, it needs quite some support from its teammates in order to be effective. First, a powerful physical attacker such as Choice Band Terrakion makes a fantastic offensive partner, as it can easily take out special tanks such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Blissey that put a stop to Genesect's fun. Chandelure gives this set a lot of trouble, as it can take a hit at full health and KO back, meaning a strong Pursuit user such as Tyranitar is a good teammate. Focus Sash Dugtrio can help here as well, as it can trap and take out the aforementioned threats that can stop Genesect's sweep. Entry hazard support also helps Genesect immensely, ensuring that the aforementioned threats cannot keep sponging its attacks and thus paving the way for a sweep. Providing Genesect with Wish support can give it a second chance to pull off a sweep; good options for this role include Blissey, Vaporeon, and Latias. Lastly, while not absolutely necessary, Rapid Spin support too can allow Genesect to attempt a sweep several times, especially if you can't afford to spare a teamslot just for Wish support.</p> "

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>This set capitalizes on Genesect's excellent coverage and access to Download to function as a powerful mid-game attacker, tearing gaping holes in the opponent's team. The ability to switch moves eases prediction immensely, as Genesect can simply fire off powerful attacks and U-turn to a teammate when met with a counter, wearing down the opponent's defensive core for a teammate to muscle through and sweep later. Walls such as Ferrothorn, Jellicent, and Skarmory are all destroyed by the appropriate move, and even Blissey takes upwards of 50% damage from +1 U-turn. Though Genesect is narrowly outsped by Garchomp and the numerous threats with base 100 Speed, it can still get past these checks with U-turn and some prediction, dealing heavy damage to them as they switch in and going to a teammate that can take them out.</p> <p>Special Attack and Speed are maximized, with a Naive or a Hasty nature used depending on the attacks you wish Genesect to take: Hasty for special Dragon-type attacks such as Draco Meteor, and Naive for powerful physical priority like Breloom's Mach Punch. Some EVs can be shifted from Special Attack to Attack for nabbing the OHKO on threats such as Deoxys-S with U-turn. Life Orb is the preferred item for the power boost which it offers to all of Genesect's attacks, but Expert Belt is also a great option to bluff a Choice set and nab a surprise KO or two. Shed Shell can be used to escape from Chandelure while bluffing a Choice set.</p> <p>If using Expert Belt or Shed Shell, you could opt to replace U-turn with Substitute in the fourth moveslot, run a Timid nature, and move the 4 Attack EVs into Special Defense to fool the opponent into believing that Genesect is running a Choice Scarf. This allows it to easily set up a Substitute and nab a surprise KO or two, which can be game-changing. If you are using Genesect on a rain team, use Thunder instead of Thunderbolt; Hidden Power Water is also an option over Flamethrower to deal heavy damage to Heatran in the rain. Bug Buzz might seem usable over one of Genesect's coverage options, but as mentioned earlier, this set relies heavily on Genesect's fantastic coverage, and U-turn already deals heavy damage to threats such as Tyranitar. Finally, Hidden Power Ground can be used to nab a surprise KO on Heatran, but its surprise factor can be ruined by the use of Protect.</p> <p>As this set functions primarily as a wallbreaker, its best teammates are powerful sweepers which can sweep a weakened team with ease. However, randomly slapping on a few sweepers will rarely prove to be effective. While Genesect is highly efficient at breaking through defensive cores and can take the odd hit or two with its decent defenses, it is easily taken out by pretty much any faster attacker with a super effective Fire-type attack, meaning bulky Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Garchomp make great teammates; they can take advantage of Genesect eliminating Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory to set up and sweep or just spam Outrage. Alternatively, a fast Choice Scarf user such as Terrakion or Latios can sweep a weakened team with ease. Entry hazard support too is, as always, of great help to Genesect and its teammates, since it makes wallbreaking a much easier task.</p> "
