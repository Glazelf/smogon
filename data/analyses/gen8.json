After a Growth and Stealth Rock damage, Solar Beam has a 93% chance to OHKO Eviolite Electabuzz, OHKOes a plethora of offensive Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Galarian Mr. Mime, and 2HKOes every single Pokemon that does not resist Grass. While weaker, Giga Drain lets Ivysaur retain its bulk while sweeping, making it less likely to be revenge killed by Ice Shard Piloswine. Giga Drain is also able to be used after sun turns are over. Weather Ball gives Ivysaur a coverage move to hit Ferroseed and Klang, as well as other Steel-types for super effective damage, while also hitting Golbat for significant damage. Sludge Bomb lets Iyvsaur do substantial amounts of damage outside of sun. Sleep Powder helps Iyvsaur set up on troublesome switch-ins like Golbat, Galarian Corsola, and Rufflet, while Synthesis heals Iyvsaur, increasing its longevity without resorting to Giga Drain. The EV spread gives Iyvsaur enough speed to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame along with Choice Scarf Lampent under sun.</p> <p>Vulpix is Ivysaur's most important teammate, as it automatically sets up sun whenever it switches in. Additional sun sweepers are helpful, whether it's other Chlorophyll Pokemon such as Tangela or Fire-types like Magmar, Charmeleon, and Raboot. Ivysaur is especially vulnerable to Steel-types outside of sun, so the aforementioned Fire-types are useful for breaking past these threats. Some form of entry hazard removal is also recommended, as Ivysaur can be worn down by entry hazards rather quickly, so Hattrem or Wartortle is a good partner. Particularly, specially defensive Wartortle is a good partner, as it helps check Fire-types such as Lampent and Magmar while being able to pivot with Flip Turn. Shell Smash Wartortle with Weather Ball is a more offensive teammate option as well. Pikachu and Golbat can be troublesome to sun teams, so teammates such as Piloswine and Gabite can be useful in threatening them and providing entry hazards of their own.</p> "

Venusaur's defensive typing lets it set up on many common Pokemon like Tangrowth, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W, allowing it to clean teams with its Growth boots. With moves like Giga Drain for reliable recovery, a powerful 100-Base Power and sun-boosted Weather Ball, and Sludge Bomb or Earth Power, Venusaur is able to punch holes in many teams, as with a boost it 2HKOes nearly every Pokemon in the tier, barring Bulletproof Kommo-o and Chansey. With a Modest nature, it outspeeds every relevant Pokemon in the tier under sun except +2 Galarian Moltres. However, Venusaur is severely limited if sun is no longer active, being outsped and KOed by plenty of Pokemon like Salamence, Azelf, and Thundurus-T or used as setup bait for Pokemon like Galarian Moltres, Kommo-o, and Necrozma. Without a boost, Venusaur can sometimes be too weak to sweep, as common Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres are able to survive an unboosted hit and OHKO it back.

Rotom-H and Moltres are other Pokemon that can take an unboosted Sludge Bomb from Venusaur and KO it back with their Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Kommo-o: Kommo-o resists Giga Drain and is immune to Sludge Bomb and Weather Ball thanks to Bulletproof, so it can switch in and set up Stealth Rock, KO Venusaur outright, or use it as setup fodder if it's an offensive variant.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Special walls such as Chansey and Umbreon can take any of Venusaur's hits and stall out sun turns, with the former using Soft-Boiled and wearing it down with Seismic Toss and the latter being able to keep itself healthy with Wish + Protect and hit Venusaur hard with Foul Play due to Growth's attack boosts. Both Assault Vest Reuniclus and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro can take a +2 hit and KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Zygarde-10%, Lycanroc-D, and Mamoswine can revenge kill Venusaur using their priority moves if Venusaur is worn down, which can happen due to Venusaur sometimes having to take a hit to set up Growth while also dealing with Life Orb recoil.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weathers: Venusaur's sweeping capabilities can be halted by weather setters such as Alolan Ninetales and Pelipper cancelling Chlorophyll. This forces Venusaur out and Torkoal back in to reactivate sun, which can be taken advantage of by the opponent. Torkoal is also severely weakened by Stealth Rock if it has to come in multiple times during a game, and if it faints, Venusaur becomes dead weight.</p> ",

It can set up on popular Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Quagsire, and Tapu Bulu due to its typing, and then sweep through opposing teams. Giga Drain hits Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Primarina, Krookodile, and Rhyperior super effectively. Weather Ball is Venusaur's main attacking move under sun, as its Base Power becomes 100 and is boosted by the sun, KOing Steel-types that resist Giga Drain like Celesteela, Aegislash, and Jirachi. Sludge Bomb hits Pokemon that resist Giga Drain and Weather Ball like Salamence and Rotom-H while also hitting Fairy-types like Hatterene super effectively, though it will need a boost to OHKO the former two. Earth Power is an alternative option to hit Bulletproof Kommo-o, which resists or is immune to all of Venusaur's attacks, and has the added benefit of hitting Tentacruel, Chandelure, and Nihilego harder, but this leaves Venusaur susceptible to Salamence, as Giga Drain and Weather Ball are mandatory moves. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed ensures Venusaur is as strong and fast as possible. A Modest nature is typically used to maximize damage output while still nearly outspeeding everything under the sun, but a Timid nature can be used to outspeed +2 Galarian Moltres if needed. Life Orb is used to boost Venusaur's damage output, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Salamence, and Nidoqueen after a boost, while a boost to Giga Drain gives Venusaur insane damage output and reliable recovery, making it an unstoppable force.</p> <p>Venusaur only fits on sun teams, so Torkoal is a mandatory partner, as it is the most reliable sun setter in the tier. It provides the team with entry hazard support and entry hazard control with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, respectively. Other Pokemon that take advantage of sun like Chandelure and Charizard break holes in enemy teams thanks to their powerful wallbreaking capabilities amplified by sun, allowing Venusaur to sweep much more easily. Venusaur also appreciates momentum such as Teleport from Chansey to help it get in safely as well as give it more opportunities to set up; for example Chansey can bring Venusaur in on physical attackers like Krookodile and Azumarill, which are forced out by it under sun. Hatterene can be run as a Kommo-o check and discourages entry hazards from being set so Torkoal can come in more, allowing Venusaur to sweep more easily. Lastly, an offensive Kommo-o of your own can help the team deal with Pokemon like Chandelure while also giving it an easier matchup against Chansey.</p> "

Defog allows Charizard to clear all entry hazards and is the preferred option due to Charizard's ability to force out common entry hazard setters like Palossand and Weezing. Toxic cripples switch-ins such as Lanturn and Gigalith; it also allows Charizard to pressure Jellicent and Aromatisse more effectively. Lastly, Focus Blast immediately pressures Rock-types like Regirock. Fighting-types like Passimian and Bulk Up Scrafty appreciate Charizard pressuring their switch-ins such as Ribombee. In exchange, they can take on Charizard's answers like Gigalith and Lanturn. Pokemon like Sandaconda and Jellicent make for good partners thanks to their ability to take on attackers that force Charizard out like Lycanroc and Basculin, respectively. On sun teams, Solar Power is an option, as it makes Charizard significantly harder to switch into. On such teams, it should forego Hurricane for Solar Beam and run Weather Ball in the fourth moveslot, and Choice Specs is an option over Heavy-Duty Boots. Charizard should also be paired with other Pokemon that take advantage of sun such as Shiftry.</p> "

Defog is an option, as Mega Charizard Y has a good matchup against common entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Heatran, but its extreme vulnerability to Stealth Rock along with it losing to hazard setters like Garchomp makes it an unreliable Defogger. It also dislikes giving up an important moveslot for it.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p>On more offensive teams that do not require Mega Charizard X's longevity and defensive utility, you can remove Roost and use both Dragon Claw and Earthquake.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Mega Charizard Y</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock halves Mega Charizard Y's health, severely limiting its ability to switch in and wallbreak. To add insult to injury, some Stealth Rock setters can even set the hazard up in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Blissey and Chansey are near impossible for Mega Charizard Y to break through due to their massive special bulk, and they can then proceed to either status it or pivot out to a dangerous teammate.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types like Mega Latios, Mega Latias, Hydreigon, and Garchomp are tough for Mega Charizard Y to deal with due to their resistance to Fire and Grass. The former two are particularly difficult to deal with due to their good bulk and access to recovery.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar are huge threats to Mega Charizard Y, as they can switch in and override sun with sand to weaken its STAB move and force Solar Beam to charge, and they then proceed to either KO it with their Rock-type moves or damage it as it tries to switch out with Pursuit. However, they must watch out for Scorching Sands burns and the rare Focus Blast. Pelipper is similarly dangerous, as it can switch in on Mega Charizard Y, override sun with rain, and proceed to either KO it with its Water-type moves or pivot out to a dangerous teammate.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex: Toxapex resists Fire while not being weak to Solar Beam, letting it check Mega Charizard Y well although Scorching Sands and Future Sight support threaten it to a degree.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Garchomp can revenge kill Mega Charizard Y; however, they, with the exception of Garchomp, cannot switch in on it at all.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Physically bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini can take Mega Charizard X's STAB moves with ease and pressure it with their own STAB moves, but they must watch out for the rare Thunder Punch and, in Toxapex's case, Earthquake. Toxapex can also be 2HKOed by +1 Dragon Claw into Earthquake, while Tapu Fini is 2HKOed by +1 Flare Blitz after some chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T can weaken Mega Charizard X with Intimidate and threaten it with Earthquake, forcing it to switch. Hippowdon can switch in and force Mega Charizard X out with Earthquake or phaze it, removing its boosts. However, offensive variants of Landorus-T can be OHKOed by Flare Blitz after Stealth Rock, while defensive variants can be easily worn down due to their lack of recovery. Gliscor can also tank one boosted Flare Blitz if it is at full health and KO back with Earthquake in combination with recoil damage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Tyranitar and Mega Diancie can switch in and KO Mega Charizard X with their Rock-type STAB moves, but they have to be careful about Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Charizard's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving makes it difficult to switch in, and, after Mega Evolving, it gets crippled by all entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazard damage and Toxic from the likes of Toxapex and Heatran reduce Mega Charizard X's longevity, making it more susceptible to being revenge killed.

          "description": "<p>Mega Charizard Y is a ferocious wallbreaker in National Dex because of its sky high Special Attack stat, great ability in Drought, and passable Speed tier that lets it threaten much of the metagame. Drought sets Mega Charizard Y apart by boosting its Fire-type moves, weakening Water-type moves, ands also letting it use Solar Beam effectively, which makes it a Fire-type that is able to threaten out bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Slowking. Mega Charizard Y's typing and access to Roost let it check Pokemon like Rillaboom and Mega Scizor reliably throughout a game . Flamethrower has perfect accuracy and high PP, but Fire Blast has explosive power, easily OHKOing Landorus-T and possibly Zapdos as well as 2HKOing offensive Garchomp. Solar Beam complements Mega Charizard Y's STAB move well, severely denting bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Slowbro that may try to switch in on Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Scorching Sands rounds off its coverage by OHKOing offensive Heatran while also 2HKOing physically defensive Toxapex after Stealth Rock, and its burn chance can ruin Tyranitar. Focus Blast is an option to replace Scorching Sands, notably hitting Tyranitar extremely hard while retaining the ability to smack Heatran. However, it has terrible accuracy and it also leaves Mega Charizard Y completely helpless against Toxapex without Future Sight support, so it is generally not advised. Roost lets Mega Charizard Y heal off residual damage and check Pokemon like Rillaboom throughout the game. A Timid nature is chosen to outspeed Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Hydreigon, and Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Mega Charizard Y absolutely hates Stealth Rock, as its health is halved by it, so good Defoggers like Corviknight, Zapdos, and Synthesis Kartana are absolutely mandatory partners for it. Blissey and Chansey are also huge thorns in Mega Charizard Y's side, as it cannot 2HKO them due to their massive special bulk, so Pokemon like Swords Dance Gliscor and Kartana that can take advantage of them are good partners. Heatran is also a good choice to trap and remove them. Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar, Weavile, and Aegislash can greatly pressure Mega Latias, which can potentially use Mega Charizard Y as setup fodder, and also force damage onto Blissey. Mega Charizard Y struggles with Toxapex, especially if running Focus Blast, so Slowbro and Slowking can pressure it with Future Sight and Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Heatran can beat it directly. Due to Mega Charizard Y's only passable Speed tier, it is prone to getting revenge killed by faster threats like Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny, so pivots like the aforementioned Slowbro and Blissey can both switch in on these Pokemon and give it free switches via slow pivoting. Similarly, faster pivots like Tapu Koko can lure in bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn that give Mega Charizard Y free turns while also helping wear down their shared checks, like Blissey. Due to how prolific Mega Charizard Y is as a wallbreaker, late-game cleaners Kartana make good partners for it, as it can break through their checks like Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Entry hazard support from the likes of Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Garchomp helps force damage onto Mega Charizard Y's checks, mainly Toxapex, as it can 2HKO it with Scorching Sands after Stealth Rock.</p> "

At +1, Mega Charizard X outspeeds Choice Scarf users below base 100 Speed such as Landorus-T and Tapu Lele. Its typing lets it switch in on and force out common Steel- and Grass-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Rillaboom, granting it setup opportunities. Flare Blitz deals serious damage to common Ground-types such as Gliscor and Landorus-T. Dragon Claw is preferable in the second moveslot to not be walled by other Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Mega Latias. However, this leaves it walled by Heatran and more easily checked by Mega Diancie and Tyranitar. Earthquake provides a way to hit Toxapex, and Steel-types weak to it such as Excadrill and Magnezone without taking recoil from Flare Blitz, while also OHKOing Heatran and Mega Diancie after a Dragon Dance and 2HKOing Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. Thunder Punch could be used to hit bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Pelipper more effectively, but it gives worse neutral coverage. Roost recovers HP lost from Flare Blitz recoil and residual damage, letting Mega Charizard X check Grass-types like Rillaboom more easily. A Jolly nature is better to outspeed Pokemon below base 100 Speed like Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, Hydreigon and Kyurem.</p> <p>Mega Charizard X functions as a early- or mid-game wallbreaker that can take advantage of Steel- and Grass-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn, which benefits Pokemon like Rillaboom, Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Tapu Koko. In return, they can pressure some of its checks like Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Toxapex, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie. Due to Charizard's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving, entry hazard removers such as Zapdos, Corviknight, and Tapu Fini are mandatory partners. Tapu Fini can also protect Mega Charizard X from status through Misty Terrain, giving it more opportunities to setup Dragon Dance. Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp, Clefable, and Gliscor chip some of boosted Mega Charizard X's answers; offensive Landorus-T turns from a decent check to a likely OHKO, Toxapex becomes a likely 2HKO, and Tapu Fini becomes a guaranteed 2HKO. Garchomp can also break through Landorus-T and Gliscor with its Z-Move to help Mega Charizard X sweep. Due to its Ground weakness after Mega Evolving, checks to Ground-types like Rillaboom, Tangrowth, and Corviknight make good teammates, with the latter also providing Defog support and Rillaboom pressuring common checks like Tapu Fini, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Slowbro. It's important to note that Rillaboom's and Tapu Fini's terrains make Earthquake and Dragon Claw too weak to use, respectively.</p> "

It's able to outspeed big threats such as Choice Scarf Excadrill, Choice Scarf Indeedee, and Dragapult and threaten them with its powerful attacks. Solar Power gives Charizard a 1.5x Special Attack boost under sun that makes it an incredibly strong wallbreaker capable of sweeping entire teams like Psychic and Fairy and allows it to OHKO threats such as Dragapult with Dragon Pulse after Stealth Rock. Flamethrower is used in situations where Charizard can't afford missing such as against Choice Scarf Excadrill, which can sweep Fire pretty easily without Charizard to revenge kill it. Fire Blast is the more powerful option, best suited when Charizard wants to deal as much damage as possible against the opposing team. Dragon Pulse hits threatening Dragon-types such as the aforementioned Dragapult and is overall amazing in the Dragon matchup, as Charizard is able to clean late-game. Focus Blast hits bulky Pokemon that resist its Fire STAB such as Tyranitar, Rhyperior, and Thick Fat Snorlax. Charizard should avoid switching in when Stealth Rock are up because its 4x weakness and the substantial Solar Power recoil adds up very quickly, and its teammates should find opportunities to remove them so Charizard has more freedom. Due to how powerful its Fire attacks are under sun, it should either break holes in the opposing team early so its teammates can clean up or be preserved for a late-game sweep. Charizard is also a great revenge killer that can deal with threats such as Dracozolt and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Torkoal is an amazing teammate because it sets up sun for Charizard with its Drought, can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, and can set its own Stealth Rock to chip Pokemon like Dragapult to support Charizard's wallbreaking. Cinderace can also get rid of hazards if they're not up on both sides with Court Change and can pivot with U-turn to give Charizard safe switches in. Cinderace also has High Jump Kick to hit threats such as Tyranitar and Snorlax. Ninetales is another sun setter that supports Charizard's Solar Power wallbreaking that can break holes in teams using its own sun-boosted Fire attacks, Solar Beam to hit Water- and Rock-types, and Nasty Plot to weaken the opposing team for Charizard. Rotom-H is a good teammate because it threatens Water-types with its Electric-type attacks and provides a second option for Ground immunity for Fire-type teams barring Mold Breaker users such as Excadrill. Arcanine is a strong physical wallbreaker with nice coverage in Wild Charge and Close Combat, as well as Extreme Speed to pick off weakened foes or put them in range for Charizard to revenge kill. Chandelure can be used as a second Choice Scarf user to threaten Dragapult and cripple annoying Pokemon such as Toxapex and Appletun by using Trick. Salazzle can use its Corrosion Toxic to spread poison and wear down Pokemon such as Toxapex that Charizard can't handle.</p> "

Instead of Toxic on defensive sets, Wartortle can opt for Yawn or Haze to either pair well with the slow Flip Turn, or check some setup sweepers like Combusken and Duosion.

Shell Smash bolsters Wartortle's mediocre Special Attack to wallbreaking levels, with the Speed investment allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier in addition to a positive natured Combusken and Lampent at +1 Speed. Hydro Pump helps Wartortle clean up teams, albeit with shaky accuracy; after a Shell Smash, it also secures important 2HKOs on Pokemon like physically defensive Galarian Corsola and physically defensive Mareanie. Surf is a safer STAB option that, while not as strong, won't miss at a crucial moment. Ice Beam rounds out Wartortle's coverage, allowing it to hit Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Roselia and Fraxure. The last slot is adaptable to what a team needs. Substitute allows Wartortle to set up easily against passive Pokemon like Slowpoke and can put Wartortle in range of Torrent, providing it with access to a much stronger STAB move. Alternatively, Rapid Spin provides Wartortle with a form of entry hazard removal if the team needs it.</p> <p>Wartortle should be used mid- to late-game to sweep vulnerable teams. To this end, Pokemon that commonly counter Wartortle such as Ferroseed and Mareanie should be put in range of a KO before attempting to set up Shell Smash, lest they threaten Wartortle out with Bullet Seed or Haze respectively. Knock Off users such as Tangela and Gurdurr make for excellent partners, as they can often force the aforementioned Pokemon onto the field and remove their Eviolite with Knock Off. Similarly, Electric-types like Electabuzz and Pikachu pair nicely with Wartortle, as they can damage shared counters like Ferroseed and Roselia, and Wartortle in return pressures the Ground-types like Marshtomp that they might otherwise struggle to deal with. Wartortle is pressured by priority users, notably Pikachu and Thwackey, so Pokemon that can limit their switchin opportunities like Spikes Ferroseed and Toxic Spikes Koffing pair well with Wartortle. Golbat can repeatedly switch into Thwackey and use U-turn to give Wartortle free setup opportunities on Pokemon like Slowpoke, and is especially notable for being able to use Super Fang to put Electabuzz in range of a boosted Surf. Lastly, it can often be difficult to set up Shell Smash multiple times throughout a battle, so Wish and Healing Wish support from Pokemon like Clefairy and Hattrem greatly benefit Wartortle in this regard.</p> "

It has enough natural bulk to secure setup opportunities on passive Pokemon like Sylveon and Vaporeon, and its Speed is crucially high enough to prevent Choice Scarf users like Passimian and Rotom-C from revenge killing it after setting up. Its defensive counterplay is limited, as Toxic users like Bronzong and Vaporeon are unable to deter Substitute variants, and tanks like Stealth Rock Copperajah and Dragalge are only able to KO it with chip damage; they may even inadvertently buff Blastoise by weakening it into Torrent range. Nonetheless, Blastoise is likely to sustain noteworthy damage when setting up, which in turn makes it easier for the aforementioned walls and priority users like Decidueye and Sirfetch'd to deal with it. Some bulky Pokemon like Assault Vest Copperajah, Haze Mantine, and specially defensive Dhelmise check Blastoise even without prior chip damage. Blastoise will also struggle to set up against offensive teams that pressure it with faster wallbreakers and sweepers as well as against teams with ample entry hazard and Knock Off support to make Blastoise much more vulnerable to revenge killers like Goodra and Choice Scarf Heliolisk.</p> ",

Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Alolan Raichu to outspeed Keldeo, Alolan Ninetales, and Landorus outside of Electric Terrain. A Modest nature can be used instead to increase damage output while still being very fast under Electric Terrain. Life Orb is used to increase Alolan Raichu's otherwise underwhelming damage output so it can sweep better. Alolan Raichu is very frail, so it should generally avoid switching in recklessly after Electric Terrain has been set up and instead come in safely from teammates' pivoting.</p> <p>Tapu Koko is needed in order to set Electric Terrain for Alolan Raichu so it can clean teams or weaken foes. It also provides an immunity against Dragon-type moves from foes like Garchomp, Latios, and Mega Altaria, and it can beat problematic Dark-types like Bisharp thanks to its STAB Dazzling Gleam. Zeraora can deal with specially defensive walls such as Blissey and Celebi that Alolan Raichu struggles with. Alolan Golem and Magnezone can trap problematic Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Scizor with Magnet Pull and KO them. Alolan Golem is also able to set up Stealth Rock to chip foes for Alolan Raichu. Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Regieleki are able to pivot into Alolan Raichu with Volt Switch and weaken foes, giving it more opportunities to sweep. Bulky partners such as Zapdos and Rotom-W are able to take powerful attacks or priority moves for Alolan Raichu, provide support with Defog, and switch in on Ground-type attacks. However, Rotom-W has to be wary of Mold Breaker Excadrill. Additionally, Zapdos is able to check Tapu Bulu, which disrupts Electric Terrain and checks Alolan Raichu freely due to its typing.</p> "

Its solid defensive typing also lets it check Pokemon such as Nihilego and discourage common Electric-types such as Rotom-H from using Volt Switch. However, Nidoqueen can struggle to pivot into Electric-types like Raikou and Thundurus-T that commonly carry super-effective coverage to break through it. Unfortunately, Nidoqueen's overreliance on its Life Orb leaves it susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would pivot into like Nihilego. A low Speed stat gives Nidoqueen an undesirable matchup versus faster-paced teams, and although Nidoqueen sports a quality defensive typing, it is still weak to common Pokemon in the tier such as Mamoswine and Keldeo. These struggles sting a bit more because Nidoqueen has no form of reliable recovery, meaning it is worn down pretty quickly throughout a match. Lastly, Nidoqueen faces severe competition from her counterpart Nidoking, who sports better offenses and a higher speed tier, making it preferred on most teams. Still, Nidoqueen's better bulk and role compression as an entry hazard setter gives it a role on certain teams.</p> ",

Earth Power and Sludge Wave are mandatory, powerful STAB moves that OHKO bulkier Pokemon such as Aegislash, Hatterene, and Tangrowth. Fire Blast is an excellent coverage move and the best pick for the last slot, as it almost OHKOes Amoonguss and cleanly 2HKOes Celesteela. Modest is the preferred nature because it grants Nidoqueen exceptional power and still lets it outspeed most of its primary targets, although a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Buzzwole, Timid Volcanion, and Timid Toxtricity.

      "overview": "<p>Nidoking is equipped with an incredible STAB combination that is amplified by its ability Sheer Force and a Life Orb, allowing it to operate as a powerful special wallbreaker despite its mediocre base Special Attack. In addition, it boasts phenomenal coverage options such as Thunderbolt, Flamethrower, and Ice Beam that allow it to reliably pressure switch-ins to its STAB attacks such as Slowking, Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T. Nidoking's defensive typing is solid as well, letting it take advantage of Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Clefable for wallbreaking opportunities as well as providing it with a handy Toxic and Thunder Wave immunity. However, its bulk and Speed tier leave much to be desired. It is very prone to being revenge killed by faster threats like offensive Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Tapu Lele and struggles to find natural wallbreaking opportunities due to its frailty, relying on pivoting allies that can switch it in safely. Despite its good defensive typing, Nidoking's fragility also makes it difficult to utilize consistently, especially if it sustains prior chip damage. On top of this, Nidoking is reliant on its item to do damage due to its mediocre Special Attack, making it susceptible to Knock Off. This can be particularly troublesome against Clefable, which Nidoking can otherwise take advantage of. Special walls such as Blissey and Slowking are problematic as well, having no qualms switching into most of its attacks and gaining momentum on its escape with Teleport.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt allows Nidoking to exploit its small subset of switch-ins by incapacitating most forms of progress, such as Teleport and entry hazard removal, or hazard setup. Taunt mainly punishes Blissey, greatly limiting its utility and providing the Nidoking user with an opportunity to capitalize on it. However, Taunt is a move that needs to be used aggressively to get value, which can conflict with Nidoking's role as a wallbreaker. Alternatively, Focus Punch can be used for the luring and dispatching of Blissey, putting it in range of a subsequent STAB move. This can open Nidoking for more wallbreaking opportunities against teams that are overreliant on Blissey as their special backbone; however, Focus Punch is extremely matchup reliant and has little to no utility against other Pokemon. Lastly, Stealth Rock can be used on teams lacking a Stealth Rock setter, enabling Nidoking to set the hazard on forced switches. Though, using the move limits Nidoking's wallbreaking potential greatly.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Nidoking is extremely susceptible to revenge killing from a wide range of offensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Rillaboom, Dragapult, and Urshifu-R that can take advantage of its mediocre bulk and Speed tier to force it out and create progress with options such as Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T and Garchomp can scare out Nidoking with their greater Speed and super effective STAB attacks. Landorus-T, particularly, is not bothered by Nidoking's STAB attacks but can easily be overwhelmed by its coverage if utilized recklessly. Gastrodon and Swampert, additionally, are willing to take on Nidoking and scare it out with their respective STAB moves; the latter, however, can also be overwhelmed due to its lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Blissey is a counter to most Nidoking variants that can reliably switch into any one of its special attacks, being only somewhat deterred by Taunt and the situational Focus Punch. Galarian Slowking, Slowking, and Tyranitar are also capable of taking its hits if healthy.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal: Nidoking is reliant on its Life Orb for its damage output; for this reason, Nidoking losing its Life Orb to Knock Off or Trick greatly mitigates the threat of its power. Additionally, given Knock Off's prevalence, Nidoking's susceptibility to the move allows Knock Off users to safely force progress using it against the Nidoking user's team.</p> ",

Thunder is an alternative that applies much more pressure to Slowking and OHKOes Tornadus-T as they switch in at the cost of a lower accuracy; however, a Modest nature is necessary if Thunder is used to create a more favorable roll to KO Slowking with a subsequent Sludge Wave. Flamethrower is another coverage option that reliably OHKOes Ferrothorn and Scizor and can apply pressure to Landorus-T switch-ins. Alternatively, Ice Beam targets Landorus-T and Garchomp but gives Nidoking a more difficult time in pressuring Ferrothorn, which can take advantage of it by using Knock Off, Leech Seed, or Spikes. Substitute is another option that lets Nidoking fully capitalize on a forced switch and safely force damage on a target of its choice without the threat of being knocked out beforehand, which greatly eases the need for prediction, but forces Nidoking to drop an additional coverage option. A Modest nature provides the Nidoking user with a more fruitful damage output and a much more favorable roll to 2HKO Slowking with Thunderbolt. However, Timid allows Nidoking to outspeed Tapu Bulu, Modest Tapu Lele, and Zapdos.</p> <p>Nidoking's inability to find many natural wallbreaking opportunities makes it a phenomenal partner with offensive pivots such as Tapu Koko and Dragapult that can provide it with opportunities to switch in safely. The former is able to apply great pressure to checks like Corviknight and Slowking while pivoting against bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn; its Electric Terrain, additionally, boosts Nidoking's Thunderbolt, which is prominent against Slowking. The latter pivots against bulky Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Clefable while applying pressure to Slowking with its Ghost-type STAB attacks. Additionally, it is capable of utilizing Thunder Wave to slow down Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, turning them into wallbreaking fodder for Nidoking. Nidoking also pairs well with defensive pivots like Corviknight and Rotom-W, which give Nidoking a safe wallbreaking opportunity against Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Grass-types like Tangrowth. They, additionally, can give Nidoking a good escape option against potential revenge killers like Tapu Lele for Corviknight and Landorus-T in Rotom-W's case. Slowking can also find good pivoting opportunities against Tapu Koko and Tangrowth while giving Nidoking the ability to exploit Toxapex for a wallbreaking opportunity. In addition, entry hazards and Knock Off are valuable tools that can greatly aid Nidoking's wallbreaking abilities by forcing checks like Slowking and Landorus-T to fold to its coverage. Ferrothorn, for example, boasts access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Knock Off to remove Slowking's Heavy-Duty Boots and more effectively pressure it. Landorus-T is also capable of using Stealth Rock and Knock Off, as well as pivoting against opposing Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Fini with U-turn and providing Nidoking with a wallbreaking opportunity. Clefable is also a solid Stealth Rock setter that has access to Knock Off.</p> "

Nidoking also helps against types like Fairy, Flying, Steel, and Grass, as they lack sturdy defensive switch-ins to it. Its part-Poison typing provides useful defensive utility by letting it switch in on Fairy-type attacks and remove Toxic Spikes. It is additionally the only way for Ground teams to set Toxic Spikes themselves. However, while Nidoking can pressure many physically defensive walls, its Speed tier leaves it outsped and KOed by a plethora of offensive Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele, Excadrill, and Hydreigon, to name a few. Nidoking's mediocre bulk also makes it difficult to come in on Pokemon that it can deal with but can wear it down, such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Bulu. This frailty also makes it vulnerable even to revenge killers lacking super effective moves such as Spectrier.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p>Nidoking is one of the best wallbreakers that Poison has to offer thanks to its powerful combination of Life Orb and Sheer Force. Its role as a wallbreaker is very important in the Steel matchup, as Earth Power + Flamethrower demolishes Steel teams after Heatran's Air Balloon has been popped. Nidoking also offers Poison an Electric immunity to prevent Volt Switch spam from Electric-types like Regieleki and Tapu Koko. Its access to BoltBeam coverage allows Nidoking to apply more pressure on Flying teams, which is nice, since Stealth Rock cannot pressure Flying much because of how often it uses Heavy-Duty Boots. Nidoking is, however, slower than many faster threats like Excadrill, Cinderace, and Keldeo and weak to Water-, Ice-, and Ground-type moves like Scald, Ice Beam, and Earthquake.

Fire Blast over Flamethrower notably 2HKOes specially defensive Celesteela, but it is less reliable.

Nidoking must also be wary of super effective attacks from slower foes such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Swampert, as it fails to OHKO them.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p><strong>Knock Off: Nidoking does not appreciate its item being removed and it being weakened by Knock Off users like Clefable and Tornadus-T.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Priority moves like Aqua Jet and Ice Shard from Pokemon like Crawdaunt, Azumarill, and Mamoswine can KO Nidoking if their users are running a damage-boosting item like Choice Band or Life Orb, or after some prior chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: Fast Ground-type Pokemon like Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp threaten Nidoking out with Earthquake. They also fear switching into Nidoking, though, since they are at risk of being hit by Ice Beam. Water-types like Keldeo, Urshifu-R, and Barraskewda can KO Nidoking with their Water-type STAB moves but do not always appreciate switching in risking a Thunderbolt. Ice-types like Kyurem, Weavile, and Mamoswine can KO Nidoking with Ice-type moves bar Ice Shard, which requires prior chip damage. However, yet again, they fear switching in, this time due to Earth Power or Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Specially bulky Pokemon like Piloswine, Blissey, and Snorlax can sponge all of Nidoking's attacks. Piloswine can KO Nidoking with Earthquake and set Stealth Rock for chip damage, while Blissey and Snorlax can recover from and switch into its moves whenever due to their high bulk. Blissey can set up Stealth Rock and generate momentum with Teleport, while Snorlax can set up Curse and recover off damage with Rest. Slowking can also generate momentum with Teleport or deal chip damage with Scald, while Mandibuzz can remove Nidoking's Life Orb with Knock Off and recover with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Naturally faster threats like both Urshifu formes, Tapu Lele, and Excadrill, and Choice Scarf users like Galarian Darmanitan and Heracross have no problem KOing Nidoking.</p> </section>",

Flamethrower provides great coverage against Steel- and Grass-types such as Skarmory, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Bulu, hitting them for massive damage. Ice Beam nails Flying- and Dragon-types such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Garchomp, as well as potential switch-ins like Landorus-T, Latias, and Hydreigon. It also deals with Cradily better than Earth Power. Thunderbolt hits additional Flying-types that are neutral to Ice Beam such as Mantine, Pelipper, and Celesteela super effectively. Toxic Spikes can be used over Earth Power to support the team and quickly wear down grounded foes such as Porygon2. However, Nidoking's poor bulk gives it limited opportunities to set Toxic Spikes, and Earth Power is needed to break through Heatran. Sheer Force works well in tandem with Life Orb, preventing Nidoking from being worn down by Life Orb recoil and stacking damage boosts. A Timid nature allows Nidoking to outspeed the likes of Tapu Bulu and Heatran.</p> <p>Teammates such as Mamoswine, Landorus-T, and Excadrill appreciate Nidoking's ability to deal with threats like Skarmory and Celesteela. Hippowdon is a good partner, as its Sand Stream and Stealth Rock support wears down foes quickly for Nidoking. Additionally, its good bulk lets it come in on physical attackers such as Choice Scarf Excadrill, Garchomp, and Galarian Zapdos. Excadrill breaks through troublesome specially defensive walls such as Blissey and Slowking for Nidoking, beats Psychic- and Ice-types that it struggles against such as Tapu Lele, Alolan Ninetales, and Kyurem, and provides Rapid Spin support. Under Hippowdon's sand, Excadrill can also outspeed a handful of other offensive threats for Nidoking such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon, Dragapult, and Spectrier. Gastrodon and Seismitoad both provide a Water immunity for Nidoking; Gastrodon's Recover makes it more reliable against threats like Barraskewda, Keldeo, and Tapu Fini, and Seismitoad can check the highly dangerous Azumarill. Mamoswine is a powerful wallbreaker that can revenge kill some faster threats that give Nidoking trouble such as Latias, Dragapult, and Thundurus-T with Ice Shard. Choice Scarf Landorus-T is able to revenge kill additional fast foes such as Spectrier, Tapu Lele, and Volcarona while providing entry hazard removal with Defog. Its Ground immunity is also useful to handle threats such as Excadrill and Garchomp. Bulk Up + Gravity Landorus-T is another option to make Nidoking's Earth Power more spammable while helping in matchups like Poison. Choice Scarf Krookodile can act as a dangerous revenge killer against Ghost- and Psychic-types like Spectrier, Victini, and Latios. Krookodile also provides an immunity against Psychic-type attacks directed at Nidoking.</p> "

Both Earth Power and Flamethrower are needed to deal with Steel's defensive cores members: Aegislash, Heatran, and Celesteela, but, Thunderbolt or Ice Beam is needed to pop Heatran's Air Balloon. Thunderbolt is useful for hitting Water- and Flying-types like Mantine and Slowbro, whereas Ice Beam helps with Ground-, Grass-, and Flying-types like Hippowdon, Appletun, and defensive Zapdos. Stealth Rock allows Nidoking to compress the role of entry hazard setter, but the presence of Heavy-Duty Boots reduces the need for hazards. Maximized Speed EVs allow Nidoking to Speed tie an opposing Nidoking and outpace Diggersby and Togekiss.</p> <p>Nidoking offers the entire team its Electric immunity, but Toxapex appreciates it more than other teammates due to its weakness to Electric. Toxapex's bulk and Scald allow it to switch into physical attackers that threaten Nidoking like Barraskewda and Cinderace while also shutting down setup sweepers like Weavile and Cloyster with Haze. Galarian Weezing provides a Dragon immunity, which is important to switch into a Draco Meteor or Dragon Darts that could KO Nidoking, while also having utilities like Defog to get rid of entry hazards, Will-O-Wisp and Toxic Spikes to spread status, and Pain Split for longevity. Nidoking is weak to Psychic, so adding a Psychic-immune teammate like Skuntank or Drapion helps with Pokemon like Latias, Alakazam, and Tapu Lele. The former has Defog and Sucker Punch to revenge kill Psychic- and Ghost-types like Blacephalon and Alolan Raichu, while the latter has useful utilities like Knock Off, which removes Heavy-Duty Boots and makes Stealth Rock more effective and Whirlwind to phaze setup sweepers like Jirachi and Spectrier. Amoonguss is the best check to Ground-type Pokemon, notably Mold Breaker Excadrill, which threatens Nidoking and most of its teammates with Earthquake. Amoonguss also helps break Steel teams, as it has Spore to give Nidoking opportunities to come in while also forming a Regenerator core with Toxapex; together, they help Nidoking deal with Ground-, Rock-, and Water-type Pokemon like Excadrill, Rhyperior, Terrakion, and Urshifu-R. Nihilego runs Choice Scarf to revenge kill Pokemon like Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Victini and appreciates Nidoking's ability to threaten Steel-types it cannot properly deal with, like Ferrothorn and Aegislash. It has nice coverage moves like Thunderbolt, Dazzling Gleam, Power Gem, and Grass Knot, which improve quite a few matchups like Flying, Dragon, Fire, and Ground. Gengar is an option over Nihilego and supports Drapion or Skuntank in dealing with Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Slowbro with Shadow Ball, and it also deals with bulky Pokemon like Toxapex and Aegislash. Galarian Slowking's ability to sponge Psychic-type attacks that KO Nidoking from Pokemon like Alolan Raichu and Latias is appreciated, and it forms a triple Regenerator core with Toxapex and Amoonguss, making Poison teams harder to break.</p> "

Thunderbolt in tandem with Ice Beam also gives Nidoking the renowned BoltBeam coverage, hitting every Flying-type Pokemon for super effective damage, thus making Nidoking a great asset in the Flying matchup, while also dealing at least neutral damage to every other Pokemon. Flamethrower rounds off the set and synergizes extremely well with Earth Power in the Steel matchup by dealing with threats like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Stealth Rock may be opted for in lieu of Flamethrower on teams that appreciate Stealth Rock support; however, Flamethrower is generally preferred. Sheer Force powers up all of Nidoking's moves while also removing any Life Orb recoil damage. Maximum Speed investment along with a Timid nature allows Nidoking to be as fast as possible, outspeeding key threats such as Heatran.</p> <p>Nidoking appreciates Mega Venusaur and Toxapex as teammates, as the two form the defensive backbone of Poison-type teams, together being able to switch in against almost any attack. Mega Venusaur provides Nidoking a switch in against Water-type Pokemon such as Keldeo and Tapu Fini. It also comfortably deals with a majority of Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Toxapex, on the other hand, provides Nidoking with an Ice- and Water-type switch-in while also providing Toxic Spikes support, while Nidoking in return provides an Electric immunity. Alolan Muk and Drapion provide the team with much needed Psychic-type immunity thanks to their secondary Dark typing. They can also Pursuit trap threats like Latios, Latias, and Alolan Raichu. Drapion can also provide Toxic Spikes support, and Alolan Muk is able to take advantage of Nidoking's wallbreaking to sweep late-game with its Curse set. Galarian Weezing synergizes well on Poison-type teams, as it provides reliable entry hazard control thanks to Defog and acts as a good defensive pivot immune to Ground thanks to Levitate. Its secondary Fairy typing provides a Dragon immunity, allowing it to comfortably deal with threats like Dragonite. Crobat is another great option as a Defog user with access to Taunt, U-turn, and a great Speed tier, which allows it to deal with threats like Mega Gallade and Galarian Zapdos. Choice Scarf Nihilego handles fast threats and provides Stealth Rock support, and helps greatly in the Ice and Fire matchups by dealing with threats like Alolan Ninetales and Volcarona with ease. Gengar can be a reliable wallbreaker teammate with Choice Specs or Nasty Plot, helping greatly against Psychic- and Ghost-types like Mew and Galarian Corsola. Last but not least, Galarian Slowking acts as a great specially defensive switch-in against common threats to Nidoking, like Choice Specs Kyurem, while also providing the team with a secondary switch-in against Psychic-type attacks.</p> "

A specially defensive set can be used to let Clefable take on the likes of Hydreigon and Dragapult better, but this set can't take on physical attackers like Garchomp and Landorus-T as effectively and is inferior in most cases. Unaware can be used so that Clefable can take on setup sweepers like Swords Dance Garchomp and Landorus-T.

A set with Choice Scarf and Trick can be used to cripple Pokemon like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Blissey, making it easier for Clefable's teammates to take them on. However, this set has limited utility, as Trick is often useless after being used once, and Clefable only has one other moveslot to choose between Stealth Rock, Calm Mind, and a coverage move. Similarly, a set with Sticky Barb and Trick can be used to wear down Pokemon that switch into Clefable, but it also has limited utility for the same reason.

None of these Pokemon enjoy switching into Flamethrower, however.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Heatran, Astrolotl, and Volcarona all can come in on Clefable's Moonblast and force it out. Heatran can trap, taunt, and KO Clefable before it gets the chance to setup; Astrolotl can spam Fire Lash until Clefable is forced to switch and is very difficult to wear down; and Volcarona can setup alongside Clefable and beat it one-on-one. However, all of these Pokemon must beware Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Urshifu-R, Swords Dance Garchomp, Tapu Lele, and Rillaboom can overwhelm Clefable and not allow it to switch in due to their immense offensive strength. Rillaboom in particular is a threat, forcing Clefable out with a roll to OHKO with Wood Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Poison-types such as Toxapex, Chromera, and Galarian Slowking take little from any of Clefable's options and can force it out. It should be noted that Galarian Slowking must be wary of Knock Off, and cannot beat Calm Mind Clefable in a one-on-one. Furthermore, Toxapex must be careful of getting hit by Thunder from Calm Mind sets.</p> ",

Clefable is a great user of Stealth Rock, as it can take advantage of free turns versus passive Pokemon like Blissey, Toxapex, and Tomohawk. If Stealth Rock is covered somewhere else on Clefable's team, Wish can be run to support teammates that are vulnerable to getting chipped by hazards such as Heatran and Melmetal, while Thunder Wave can spread paralysis and cripple offensive switch-ins like Melmetal, Rillaboom, and Heatran. Knock Off is the best option for the final slot, as it can cripple common Moonblast switch-ins such as Equilibra and Heatran. The given EV spread allows Clefable to survive two uses of Freeze-Dry from Choice Specs Kyurem with Leftovers recovery and two uses of Hex from Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult without its Leftovers, with the rest invested in Defense to better answer threats like Dragonite and Landorus-T.

Heatran deserves special mention for being able to trap and KO Toxapex, which otherwise can Haze stall Clefable if it lacks Thunder. Furthermore, Heatran pairs well with Knock Off Clefable, as it will be able to remove Toxapex's Shed Shell. Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Tornadus-T help Clefable sweep by weakening Galarian Slowking and Heatran with Knock Off. Finally, Clefable should be paired with a special wall like Galarian Slowking or Colossoil to take on special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Nidoking that threaten it before it sets up.</p> "

There is an appeal to doubling up on Fire-type attackers with the support of Drought for dedicated wallbreakers, though a shallow movepool leaves Vulpix unable to do much to overcome its own checks and counters. Vulpix is consigned to being a one dimensional wallbreaker, but very few Pokemon can tank hits from the Fire- and Grass-type coverage that it brings to a team.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flame Charge is a nice option on non-Choice item sets for boosting Vulpix's Speed to outspeed the unboosted tier. Eject Pack allows Vulpix to use Overheat and immediately switch out to bring in Diglett to trap the likely Fire-resistant Pokemon on the field. Heat Rock gives additional turns of Sun, turning Vulpix into a niche support Pokemon for unorthodox picks such as Solar Blade Ponyta and Choice Scarf Charmander. This is not generally recommended, though, as these teams end up with large defensive gaps and heavily rely on being able to win with these fast Fire-types. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Vulpix to avoid taking entry hazard damage, but the benefits of Heat Rock often outweigh the advantages of it. Memento can be used in conjunction with a setup sweeper, such as Woobat or Shellder.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: As Water-types with Recover, Staryu, Mareanie, Shellos, and Frillish are all rather sturdy answers to Vulpix's sun-boosted attacks. Mareanie is particularly resilient owing to its ability Regenerator. Staryu does need to beware Choice Scarf Vulpix hitting it with Energy Ball on the switch, but this is not too troublesome.</p> <p><strong>Ponyta: As the main other Fire-resistant Pokemon in the tier with recovery, Ponyta is a major issue for Vulpix. Drought powers up Ponyta, making it more difficult to switch into while also causing Morning Sun to heal Ponyta for another quarter of its health. Ponyta may run Flash Fire to absorb Fire-type attacks and completely wall Vulpix, though Ponyta is still a sufficient check without it.</p> <p><strong>Priority and Entry Hazards</strong>: Vulpix is frail enough that taking a quarter of its health upon switching in greatly limits its potential. Onix is a common Stealth Rock setter and is able to switch into Vulpix's Fire-type attacks somewhat well.

          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Weather Ball is Vulpix's strongest accurate STAB move when sun is up, but it requires sun to actually be useful. Overheat is incredibly strong and can be used to break through several Pokemon, such as scoring the OHKO on Vullaby. Energy Ball is chiefly for Onix and Staryu and the only coverage option worth running. Hypnosis allows for Vulpix to try to put a Pokemon to sleep on a forced switch, which can be valuable when facing teams with Mareanie or Ponyta. Fire Blast is a powerful attack, but it should be used in situations where you do not want to be locked into Overheat or Weather Ball, such as sun disappearing or having the need to switch out. That being said, running three Fire-type attacks can be cumbersome.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread simply makes Vulpix as fast and powerful as possible. With a Timid nature, Vulpix reaches 17 Speed, outspeeding Vullaby and Speed tying with Mienfoo. The remaining EVs go into HP in order to give Vulpix one more switch into Stealth Rock. With Choice Scarf, Vulpix becomes one of the better revenge killers in the tier, outspeeding Dragon Dance Scraggy and Choice Scarf Pawniard. Choice Scarf also allows Vulpix to assume the role of a late-game cleaner. Choice Specs instead doubles down on Vulpix's threatening Fire-type attacks in order to make it a ferocious wallbreaker.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Vulpix is too frail to switchin on any neutral attack and is weak to entry hazards, which consequently means that getting it into play is a challenge. Intelligent double switches or pivoting moves such as U-turn are key components to getting Vulpix in. From there, it is often as straightforward as using the appropriate Fire-type attack while occasionally using Energy Ball to catch Staryu or Onix on the switch. Vulpix can also catch common switch-ins, such as Ponyta and Mareanie, and cripple them severely with Hypnosis. Do be mindful of Drought turns, as Vulpix without sun in play is no threat at all. Vulpix is easily threatened by all faster Pokemon and priority attacks and therefore should usually be switching out of these matchups.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Vulpix's success is determinant on coming in safely, making bulky Mienfoo one of the best partners for it available in the tier, as it can cripple Mareanie with Knock Off and force Onix out. Due to its ability to trap and remove all of the hard stops to Vulpix available in the tier, such as Ponyta and Mareanie, Diglett is often a very important teammate. Hazard removal is absolutely necessary, leading Vullaby and Staryu to be highly recommended teammates. As Vulpix will struggle with opposing Water-types and make great use of Stealth Rock, Ferroseed is highly recommended. Pawniard assists with Stealth Rock and Knock Off support as a more offensive option. Ponyta and Choice Scarf Charmander pair with Vulpix well, as they both are capable attackers with sun support. Choice Specs Vulpix specifically does well with Thunder Wave support, making Slowpoke and Porygon worthy teammates as well.</p> "

However, it is weak when unboosted and faces competition from Chandelure, Toxtricity, and Volcanion. Solar Beam grants Ninetales a strong coverage option to muscle past bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune. Toxic cripples incoming walls such as Incineroar and Snorlax, and also Noivern. Scorching Sands hits Dragalge, Chandelure, and Incineroar. Choice Specs is a good alternative item, but Choice Specs Ninetales gets worn down by entry hazards quickly and is very prediction-reliant.</p> <p>Despite Ninetales's great power, it has trouble bypassing Snorlax, as it can tank any hit Ninetales dishes out, so Fighting-types such as Cobalion, Mienshao, and Heracross are good teammates. Ninetales in return can help deal with Doublade and bulky Fairy-types such as Galarian Weezing. Ninetales has trouble breaking Dragon-types such as Noivern and Dragalge; Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Sylveon, and Gardevoir deal with Noivern, while bulky Steel-types like Registeel and Metagross can handle both. Choice Scarf Gardevoir is notably an excellent teammate, as it also provides Healing Wish support late-game, whereas Ninetales can blow through bulky Steel-types such as Registeel and Doublade. Knock Off users such as Mienshao and Seismitoad can remove annoying items such as Assault Vest on Reuniclus, Heavy-Duty Boots on Noivern, and Leftovers on Snorlax. Entry hazard setters such as Registeel, Metagross, and Golisopod are great, as they help in wearing down walls. Golisopod is an exceptional partner, as it provides both Knock Off and Spikes support, and it switches into Ground-type moves. Seismitoad sets Stealth Rock and also uses Knock Off. Ninetales can form a semi-sun core with Shiftry, which has good offensive synergy with Ninetales and can provide Knock Off support, although the lack of sun turns can limit the pair's effectiveness.</p> "

Sadly, Ice / Fairy is not a great defensive typing, as Alolan Ninetales will drop easily to both offensive and defensive variants of Steel-types like Aegislash, Jirachi, and Celesteela, making it difficult to consistently get Aurora Veil up against some teams. Additionally, a lot of common leads can give Alolan Ninetales a hard time, such as Lycanroc-D, and Choice Scarf Jirachi KO it before it can set up Aurora Veil. Furthermore, the presence of rain in the metagame can hinder Alolan Ninetales's ability to set up Aurora Veil at times.</p> ",

Freeze-Dry is the only offensive move Alolan Ninetales needs, as it hits a substantial number of UU Pokemon such as Salamence, Gyarados, and Amoonguss for super effective damage. Moonblast allows Alolan Ninetales to OHKO Crawdaunt, Buzzwole, and Kommo-o. Hypnosis can be used to put Pokemon to sleep that threaten to remove Aurora Veil with Defog or after Aurora Veil is up to allow you to safely switch in one of your sweepers. It also can be used to cripple Steel-types like Aegislash that threaten to KO Alolan Ninetales, but at 60% accuracy, this is very risky. Hail is an option as well, although it is useful only against opposing weather teams like rain that try to cancel the Snow Warning hail. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Alolan Ninetales to ignore entry hazards and come in as much as possible to set Aurora Veil.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales fits exclusively on hyper offense teams, as only these teams can maximize the utility offered from Aurora Veil. Azumarill is typically a great partner, since it can help check Lycanroc-D with Aqua Jet. Azumarill can also use Belly Drum more easily under Aurora Veil and proceed to clean out most of the enemy team, as it no longer has to rely exclusively on Aqua Jet while Aurora Veil is up. Alolan Ninetales struggles against all Steel-type Pokemon, including slower ones like Celesteela, which can OHKO it through Aurora Veil. A partner like Krookodile or Nasty Plot Thundurus-T can help ease the pressure from these foes, the former also being able to support its teammates with Stealth Rock. Other good teammates include offensive Steel-types like Autotomize Celesteela and Swords Dance Aegislash, which can set up very easily under Aurora Veil to begin a sweep. Aegislash especially appreciates this as it can potentially activate a Weakness Policy more easily. Clangorous Soul Kommo-o and Dragon Dance Gyarados can also attempt to boost more than once under Aurora Veil. They both help pressure Fire-types like Moltres and Rotom-H, which would otherwise threaten Alolan Ninetales and remove Aurora Veil with Defog.</p> "

Another option is Moonblast, which punishes the physical Fighting- and Dark-types Gloom can wall like Gurdurr, Flame Orb Machoke, and Defensive Vullaby.

It checks strong, speedy offensive threats like Ponyta and Abra as well as defensive cornerstones like Onix, Pawniard, and Mareanie. In spite of its somewhat low stats and limited movepool, Diglett is quite versatile and can be tailored in response to what foes its team needs trapped. However, Diglett is only moderately powerful, and it can sometimes struggle to make an impact against the staples of bulky teams like Ferroseed, Foongus, and Timburr. It is also extremely frail and has limited opportunities to reach the battlefield intact, requiring clever pivoting and switching to reach its full potential.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Diglett is an option that can revenge kill extremely fast threats like Choice Scarf users, Speed-boosted Ponyta and Staryu, and opposing Diglett. Air Balloon is a niche item to beat Sticky Web teams and opposing Arena Trap users while having some utility against Onix as well. Focus Sash is an option to make Diglett a dedicated lead on hyper offense teams and set Stealth Rock, but it is unreliable because of the variability of lead matchups and the prevalence of entry hazards. Protect is an option to block Mienfoo's Fake Out and High Jump Kick, and it is especially useful on Air Balloon sets seeking to preserve their item.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Arena Trap Users: Opposing Diglett and Trapinch are often the most effective counters to Diglett, as they each trap and KO it. Trapinch can either pick off a weakened Diglett with First Impression or survive most hits and OHKO even Eviolite Diglett with Earthquake, while opposing Choice Scarf and Air Balloon Diglett can revenge kill Diglett without worrying about losing a Speed tie and being KOed by Earthquake. Trace Porygon is an unorthodox Arena Trap user that can tank hits from Diglett with its great bulk and KO it in return.

Final Gambit allows you to effectively trade Diglett for an opposing threat like Staryu or Nasty Plot Vullaby or get major chip damage on a defensive anchor like Ferroseed. Beat Up reliably KOes Focus Sash Abra with five hits and also hits Natu and Galarian Ponyta hard. Earth Power allows Diglett to bypass Onix's Weak Armor to safely 2HKO it and function while Grookey's Grassy Terrain is up. Earth Power also lets Diglett safely 2HKO Mareanie without fearing a Scald burn. Sucker Punch is fairly weak but can be run on teams that need priority. Stealth Rock is an option on hyper offense teams that cannot afford to run a traditional entry hazard setter. Rock Tomb is a niche option that can prevent Scraggy from setting up effectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given HP investment allows Diglett to OHKO offensive Staryu from full health with Final Gambit. Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature allow Diglett to hit 20 Speed and outpace the entire unboosted metagame. The remaining EVs are placed in Attack to boost Diglett's damage output. Eviolite bolsters Diglett's meager bulk enough to survive one hit from certain Pokemon it likes to trap such as Onix and Mareanie, allowing it to safely 2HKO them or switch into them while at full health and revenge kill them. Eviolite also allows Diglett to switch into and survive Focus Sash Abra's Psychic and to almost always survive Analytic Magnemite's Flash Cannon after Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Diglett should be used to trap and KO key Pokemon for its teammates. Eviolite Diglett is most useful when its health is tactically preserved so that it remains able to deal with its main targets, as it lacks the power to OHKO many of them. Due to its modest bulk, it can afford to switch into a Mareanie or Onix that has had its Eviolite removed with Knock Off and then KO it. Final Gambit should be used to heavily damage bulky Pokemon lacking reliable recovery like Ferroseed when Diglett no longer has targets to trap, and it can also be deployed to weaken Nasty Plot Vullaby, which may try to set up on Diglett. Be wary of KOing a foe with Diglett when you still need it, especially if your opponent has a Trapinch or Diglett of their own, as each can trap and revenge kill Diglett before its role is fulfilled.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Eviolite Diglett works best on teams that need it to deal with Mareanie or need its combination of high Speed and the ability to trap Weak Armor Onix. Mienfoo is an exceptional partner because it can lure in Mareanie and pivot into Diglett with U-turn. Timburr and Ponyta also appreciate Diglett trapping Mareanie, while Vullaby and Ponyta benefit from it trapping Onix. Nasty Plot Vullaby especially appreciates Diglett's ability to deter and trap would-be checks like Onix and Magnemite. Abra and Galarian Ponyta enjoy Diglett trapping Pawniard.

Beat Up is the most reliable option to trap Abra, KOing Focus Sash variants with four hits, and it also deals heavy damage to Galarian Ponyta. Rock Slide threatens Vullaby, often OHKOing it after Stealth Rock. Sucker Punch can be useful for revenge killing Choice Scarf users like Vulpix and Porygon while providing the team with a moderately strong priority move.

Life Orb Diglett is extremely frail and must be deployed carefully to eliminate its required targets before being KOed. Diglett benefits from pivoting that lets it switch into targets unscathed. Additionally, it rewards aggressive double switches and predictions made after its targets are brought in to deal with other threats, which generates major offensive pressure. You should be careful not to leave Diglett exposed to being trapped by Trapinch or opposing Diglett before it has removed its main target.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Life Orb Diglett works best on teams that need its offensive presence and ability to trap and OHKO its frequent targets. Diglett has excellent synergy with pivots that can bait in targets like Onix, Pawniard, and Mareanie and give it a free switch, like Mienfoo and Vullaby. Vullaby in turn appreciates Diglett trapping and KOing Flying-resistant Pokemon like Pawniard and Onix, and Mienfoo appreciates it removing Mareanie. Other Fighting-types like Timburr and Fire-types like Ponyta similarly take advantage of Mareanie's removal. Mareanie can take hits from priority users that try to revenge kill Diglett like Timburr and Corphish while benefiting from Diglett's ability to trap Abra and Magnemite.

Reversal hits extremely hard when Focus Sash is consumed, allowing Dugtrio to do significant damage to Normal- and Ice-type Pokemon such as Obstagoon and Mamoswine. Sucker Punch allows Dugtrio to hit common Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Darmanitan and Dracovish, and common priority users such as Mamoswine. Screech can be used as an alternative to further complement its physical presence, allowing Dugtrio to trap foes more consistently by reducing their Defense. Focus Sash complements its ability Arena Trap, as it guarantees at least one Pokemon trapped from full HP. Dugtrio should seek trapping opportunities to pick off weakened foes or slower Pokemon that it can reliably beat.</p> <p>Dugtrio needs to keep its Focus Sash intact in order to trap fast threats such as Weavile effectively, so Excadrill makes an excellent teammate for Dugtrio, as it can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards for Dugtrio. It can also handle Fairy-types such as Grimmsnarl and Ribombee that either use Dugtrio as setup fodder or simply easily KO it without fear of Reversal. Hippowdon makes another decent teammate for Dugtrio with its access to Sand Stream and Stealth Rock; the cumulated passive chip damage allows Dugtrio to trap more consistently throughout the match. With its great bulk, Hippowdon can also pivot for Dugtrio after it traps and removes a threat and a revenge killer is sent out by the opponent. Mamoswine is a good offensive teammate with nearly unresisted coverage that allows it to punch many holes in opposing teams; this allows Mamoswine and Dugtrio to complement each other excellently. Dugtrio can trap and eliminate Pokemon that were weakened by Mamoswine, while it also can be used to trap fast Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Dracovish to grant Mamoswine freedom. Seismitoad is a good defensive partner with access to Toxic, which can generate chip damage for Dugtrio for consistent trapping. With its ability in Water Absorb, it can also check Dracovish. Rhyperior makes a good teammate for Dugtrio, as it can handle the Flying-types that Dugtrio cannot trap and struggles against, most notably Corviknight.</p> "

Fake Out can also be used to pick off heavily weakened targets that have boosted their Speed, like Fraxure, in a pinch. Knock Off removes items from bulky switch-ins that otherwise disregard anything Persian can do to them, such as Mawile, Dusclops, and Hippopotas, and provides coverage for Ghost-types like Drakloak. U-turn lets Persian keep up momentum for its team, saving it from floundering against bulky foes like Stonjourner, Mawile, and Dusclops. Hypnosis can be used over Knock Off to better cripple switch-ins like Mawile but is unreliable due to its poor accuracy and leaves Persian unable to damage Ghost-types outside of U-turn. Silk Scarf is preferred in order to boost Persian's most important attacks without further cutting into its already limited longevity. Technician is vital in order to let Fake Out deal significant damage.</p> <p>Persian is a good fit for bulky offense teams utilizing Spikes, which help it gradually overwhelm its switch-ins with Spikes damage, Fake Out, and U-turn. Offensive Roselia is an effective Spiker that Persian can bring in on switchins such as Mareanie, Gourgeist, and Dubwool via U-turn to set up Spikes. Roselia can also utilize Sleep Powder to put shared checks like Mawile and Pawniard to sleep. Offensive entry hazard setters like Crustle and Pawniard help weaken foes early-game, and their hazards greatly aid Persian in its role as a revenge killer. Persian can form an effective VoltTurn core with teammates like Manectric, Raichu, and Raboot, all of which can cover Pokemon that can safely switch in on Persian such as Mawile, Stonjourner, and Pawniard. Silvally-Psychic can put offensive pressure on Fighting-types Persian struggles with, such as Throh, Falinks, and Hitmontop, while also threatening to set up and breaking down targets like Mawile to help Persian clean late-game. Mr. Rime can't switch in easily but can pressure Throh and Hitmontop, and its access to hazard control helps keep Persian from being overwhelmed by residual damage. Stacking other priority users like Pawniard and Falinks with Persian can form a powerful anti-setup core that takes pressure off Persian. Both examples also deter Defog with Defiant, making them good choices for teams utilizing Spikes.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Arcanine's typing and ability in Intimidate allow it to effectively check Copperajah as well as other foes like Escavalier, Tauros, and Dhelmise. It then functions as a defensive pivot with Teleport, allowing it to gain momentum against its switch-ins like Salazzle and Starmie. Arcanine's Teleport is also vital for teams with frail wallbreakers like Tyrantrum and Exploud, as it allows them to safely get in against Mantine and Sylveon without the risk of status and chip damage. However, Arcanine risks compromising its longevity when using Teleport on walls and is easily worn down by Toxic and Knock Off. Additionally, it fails in the face of common physical attackers like Tyrantrum, Golurk, and Diancie. Arcanine relies heavily on Teleport and supportive teammates to punish its checks, and if it loses this support late-game, its passivity becomes a glaring issue against foes like Dragalge and Blastoise.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Arcanine has a vast offensive movepool and mixed offensive stats to make it less passive, so attacks like Extreme Speed, Wild Charge, and Scorching Sands work as alternatives to Flamethrower or Toxic. Offensive sets enjoy this coverage as well but are inefficient due to being easy to wall and wear down.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: By resisting Flamethrower and being immune to Toxic, Dragalge can safely switch in against Arcanine and punish it with all of its usual coverage. Arcanine should also be wary of Dragalge, Tyrantrum, and Goodra, but Teleport at least allows it to bring in faster wallbreakers if it still has valid support.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Offensive Water-types like Starmie and Blastoise are the hardest for Arcanine to deal with, and while defensive examples like Mantine and Vaporeon are checks as well, they are more manageable with Toxic and Teleport.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Arcanine fails to switch into and wall Golurk and Mudsdale, although it may have a better chance if it opts for Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Switching into attacks and following up with Teleport will wear Arcanine down, and it will lose momentum anytime it is forced to recover. Moreover, Arcanine's effectiveness is limited by Knock Off, Corrosive Gas, and Toxic from walls like Escavalier, Vileplume, and Bronzong.</p> ",

Arcanine also helps special attackers like Goodra, Rotom-C, and Dragalge for the same reason, and the latter two are additional pivots that chain momentum with Arcanine. Wallbreakers like Golurk, Tyrantrum, and Exploud all find safe opportunities to switch into walls via Teleport support, and when they find themselves threatened by revenge killers such as Tauros and Decidueye, Arcanine again is a good defensive answer. Vileplume and Mudsdale cover Knock Off users that Arcanine is vulnerable to like Sirfetch'd and Guzzlord. For specially offensive threats, Mantine and Vaporeon will help, and so will Decidueye and Choice Scarf Heliolisk to offensively pressure Blastoise and Starmie. Ground-type checks like Bronzong, Rotom-C, and Xatu are valuable so Arcanine won't have to take an Earthquake.</p> "

Wild Charge lets Arcanine deal with Water-type Pokemon such as Toxapex, Pelipper, Mantine, and Gyarados. Close Combat allows Arcanine to beat Thick Fat Snorlax and threaten Normal-type teams and is also good against common Rock-types like Tyranitar that can switch into its Flare Blitz. Extreme Speed lets Arcanine beat faster Pokemon like Hydreigon, Keldeo, and Alolan Raichu after they have been weakened.

Torkoal and Ninetales provide essential sun support for Arcanine to boost its Flare Blitz, even further letting it wallbreak easily without much prediction. They can also put opposing Pokemon to sleep with moves like Yawn and Hypnosis respectively, giving Arcanine more opportunities to switch in during the battle. Additionally, Torkoal can keep hazards away with Rapid Spin, while Ninetales can beat Ground- and Water-type Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Rotom-W with Solar Beam. Cinderace can also keep Stealth Rock off the field with Court Change and provide U-turn support as well as form a priority spam core with Arcanine thanks to Sucker Punch. Arcanine also appreciates Cinderace beating faster Pokemon like Hydreigon and Dragapult for it. Salazzle can put defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Seismitoad on a timer with Toxic, making it easier for Arcanine to beat them. It can absorb Toxic Spikes for the team, too.</p> "

Altarianite adds a secondary Fairy typing to Arcanine's Fire typing and allows it to fire off Fairy-type STAB Pixilate Extreme Speed, allowing Arcanine to outpace and deal with a large range of the offensive threats in Mix and Mega. Flare Blitz is Arcanine's secondary STAB option and gives it the ability to blow past Steel-types that resist Extreme Speed, such as Corviknight and Solgaleo. Morning Sun gives provides Arcanine with defensive utility and longevity throughout the game and works well with Arcanine's pre-Mega ability Intimidate to act as an emergency check to other Altarianite users like Dragonite. Teleport allows Arcanine to slow pivot out, which gives it a solid niche over other Extreme Speed users less able to make use of the switches they force.</p> <p>Arcanine struggles the most against some of the premier physical walls like Toxapex, Lunala, and Slowbro, so partners that can exploit these Pokemon like Lucarionite Zygarde, Spectrier, and Pheromosa are all good partners. Pheromosa is particularly useful here, as its access to U-turn allows it to keep up the momentum Arcanine wins with Teleport against most teams. In turn, Arcanine is one of the best offensive checks to other Altarianite users like Dragonite, and can bring these relatively fragile Pokemon in safely. Zeraora and Lucarionite Terrakion allow Arcanine to wear down and overwhelm shared physical checks like Slowbro and Lunala, who often prove incapable of staying healthy enough to answer all of them throughout the match. Ampharosite Blissey also pairs extremely well with Arcanine, as it can reliably set Stealth Rock to punish the switches Arcanine forces and can set Toxic on most of Arcanine's defensive checks. In turn, Arcanine serves as reliable speed control on the builds where Blissey fits best and is capable of stopping the threats that seek to exploit Blissey's added Dragon-typing.</p> "

Flare Blitz is Arcanine's STAB move of choice, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Excadrill. Close Combat can help with handling and OHKOing Normal-, Rock-, and Dark-types such as Choice Specs Porygon-Z, Tyranitar, and non-Choice Specs Hydreigon, while Play Rough lets you OHKO Urshifu-S while still being able to OHKO non-Choice Specs Hydreigon.

Intimidate combined with Arcanine's defensive utility in Will-O-Wisp and Burn Up lets it take physical hits from the likes of Galarian Darmanitan, non-Swords Dance Haxorus, and Choice Band Crustle. Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple physical attackers such as Diggersby as well as Sawk and Avalugg while also breaking their Sturdy. Arcanine uses Morning Sun to deal with Pokemon that may otherwise overwhelm it, like Choice Band Haxorus and Golisopod. Burn Up KOes Pokemon like Galarian Darmanitan and offensive Rillaboom and also removes Arcanine's Fire typing so that it is no longer weak to Rock-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks, which proves to be useful in matchups against non-Lum Berry Crustle, non-Swords Dance Rhyperior, and Adamant Choice Band Dracovish. Snarl is used to lower the Special Attack of Pokemon like Magnezone, Galarian Weezing, and Chandelure. Flamethrower deals consistent damage against threats Arcanine needs to hit more than once such as defensive Rillaboom, Taunt Zeraora, and Corviknight. Sitrus Berry gives Arcanine a source of immediate recovery to aid it in dealing with Choice Band Mold Breaker Haxorus and Assault Vest Kyurem so that it doesn't get knocked out after the first hit. Maximum Defense investment alongside 72 HP EVs with a Bold nature allows Arcanine to survive a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake from Jolly Galarian Darmanitan. 136 Speed EVs ensure that Arcanine is faster than Modest base 80 Speed Pokemon and below, such as Choice Specs Chandelure, offensive Venusaur, and Adamant Choice Band Dracovish and Diggersby. The leftover 48 EVs are invested into Special Attack to maximize the damage of Burn Up and Snarl. When using Flamethrower over Snarl, a spread of 244 HP / 136 Def / 8 SpA / 120 Spe should be used, which ensures Arcanine will always survive a Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Beam from Modest Magnezone while still surviving an Earthquake from Jolly Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, though it comes at the expense of no longer outspeeding fully invested base 80 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>Generally, Arcanine will find itself using Will-O-Wisp against physical attackers, although there are some matchups where this isn't ideal. Against non-Lum Berry Crustle, Choice Band Dracovish, and Choice Band Diggersby, Arcanine should use Burn Up to rid itself of its Fire typing followed by Will-O-Wisp and Morning Sun; this is because Burn Up is 100% accurate and achieves the same effect of halving damage as using Will-O-Wisp would, so you don't run the risk of losing on account of a miss. Certain defensive Primarina variants, like Assault Vest, can also be beaten by Arcanine through the use of Burn Up, Snarl, and Will-O-Wisp, but because Primarina can often run numerous varying techs, Arcanine shouldn't be relied on as a Primarina answer. Will-O-Wisp is also useful against special attackers like Magnezone, since it breaks its Sturdy so that Burn Up can then KO it. Will-O-Wisp also chips down Aegislash so that Burn Up can KO it after six turns of burn damage without risking the activation of its Weakness Policy. Against Choice Specs Magnezone, Arcanine should use Snarl to both break Sturdy and ensure that Arcanine will survive any hit. Pokemon like Sylveon, Primarina, and Choice Band Snorlax appreciate Arcanine's ability to handle hyper offensive threats like Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Adamant Choice Band Dracovish, and Rillaboom. In turn, these Pokemon help cover Arcanine's weakness to specially offensive threats like opposing Primarina, Hydreigon, and Kyurem.

Pivots like Raboot, Thwackey, and Electabuzz bring Kadabra in against their checks, and they in turn rely on Kadabra for breaking bulky Pokemon like Mareanie, Golbat, and Roselia. Teleport Clefairy also pairs well with Kadabra, since it brings Kadabra in safely in order to preserve its Focus Sash throughout the course of the game.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its ability Magic Guard combined with its stellar Speed stat and a Focus Sash, Alakazam performs the role of a revenge killer for Psychic-type teams. It also has a high Special Attack stat, which lets it hit hard against Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn with its coverage moves. Counter in combination with Focus Sash and Magic Guard helps Alakazam beat threatening physical attackers like Sharpedo, Cinderace, and Excadrill. Expanding Force is its STAB move of choice and is boosted to crazy levels in Psychic Terrain, letting Alakazam OHKO Pokemon like Azumarill after minor chip damage. It can also 2HKO Pokemon like Scizor and Araquanid if they switch in against it. Dazzling Gleam can be used to beat Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Crawdaunt and Hydreigon. Shadow Ball lets Alakazam do good damage to Pokemon weak to it like Aegislash and Alolan Raichu. Focus Blast, on the other hand, lets Alakazam threaten Ferrothorn and Tyranitar, which can stomach its other moves easily. Alakazam should not take any unnecessary damage that may result from directly switching it into opposing Pokemon, as they may leave it unable to retain its Focus Sash. Also, it should be preserved in matchups against Bug- and Dark-type teams where it is needed to take on threats like Scolipede and Sharpedo. Maximum Special Attack investment optimizes Alakazam's overall damage output. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets it outspeed comparably fast Pokemon such as Cinderace and Salazzle.</p> <p>Alakazam's teammates appreciate its role as a revenge killer being able to take on problematic Pokemon. Teammates like Choice Specs Indeedee-M and Nasty Plot Mew can wallbreak opposing foes, making Alakazam's job easier as a revenge killer late-game. Indeedee-M is a notable teammate, as it provides it with Ghost-type immunity and Psychic Terrain support, making the team immune to threatening priority moves like Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak from Pokemon like Bisharp, Aegislash, and Mimikyu, allowing Alakazam to deal with such threats much better. Nasty Plot Mew, meanwhile, can take care of the Steel-type matchup by taking on Pokemon like Corviknight and Ferrothorn that may be an obstacle for Alakazam late-game. Support teammates like Orbeetle and Celebi provide Sticky Web and Stealth Rock support, enabling Alakazam to outspeed faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Gengar and score easier KO with Expanding Force against Azumarill under Psychic Terrain. Pokemon like Slowbro can spread paralysis and bring Alakazam onto the field safely with Teleport, acting as a defensive pivot for the team. Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Jirachi are good teammates, as the former can deal with weather sweepers like Kingdra, Barraskewda, and Excadrill, while the latter does a good job against Fairy- and Ice-type teams, beating Pokemon like Cloyster, which can otherwise beat Alakazam with its multi-hit moves especially after Shell Smash boost. Hatterene and Alakazam form a great core against offensive types like Dark, Dragon, and Electric where Hatterene can break teams with its defensive Calm Mind set, letting Alakazam clean up late-game.</p> "

Paired with Tapu Lele, Alakazam is threatening in Psychic Terrain with Expanding Force and Focus Blast as well as immunity to Extreme Speed. However, Psychic Terrain-based teams require a lot of support to perform well. Alakazam can use Recover over Taunt or Encore to shake off any damage taken, but it is generally too frail to see much benefit from reliable recovery. Other team support options for the last move include Knock Off, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Teleport is another option that allows Alakazam to pivot as its checks switch in, but Alakazam lacks the bulk to be a reliable pivot. Focus Sash sets can run Counter as the last move in order to revenge kill setup sweepers and faster threats like Haxorus and Rillaboom, but it is prediction reliant and misses out on Ghost-type attackers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Foes: Alakazam is quite frail and can be KOed by faster offensive threats like Dragapult, Pheromosa, Spectrier, and Naganadel. Focus Sash sets can beat these foes one-on-one, though, if Alakazam is still at full health.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks: While Alakazam is immune to Extreme Speed, users of other priority moves like Rillaboom, Scizor, and Lycanroc-D can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Poison / Dark Walls: Ghost / Fairy sets can struggle to break past specially defensive Poison / Dark types like Unaware Clefable, Toxapex, and RegenVest Tornadus-T. Clefable and Toxapex are vulnerable to Taunt, which prevents recovery moves and Haze, but they can use Knock Off to remove Alakazam's Life Orb to reduce its damage output.</p> <p><strong>Blissey: Blissey's massive special bulk and common typings like Normal / Ghost and Normal / Fairy allow it to check Alakazam fairly well, although Normal / Fairy variants can be 2HKOed by +2 Focus Blast, and Blissey is generally vulnerable to Taunt.</p> ",

Shadow Ball is great for Alakazam, as it hits a lot of the metagame neutrally and makes it immune to revenge killing from Extreme Speed users. Focus Blast complements Shadow Ball well, allowing Alakazam to 2HKO Dark / Poison Clefable and hit other Dark-types like Lycanroc-D and Hippowdon, although Alakazam has to watch out for Sucker Punch from the former. While Focus Blast provides a strong yet inaccurate secondary STAB move, Dazzling Gleam has less power but lets Alakazam hit Normal / Ghost types like Blissey and more reliably hit threats like Normal / Dark Arcanine and Heracross. Nasty Plot allows Alakazam to 2HKO specially defensive checks like RegenVest Galarian Slowking and Tornadus-T with Focus Blast. Taunt prevents checks like Blissey and Clefable from healing or using status moves, which can allow Alakazam to break past them with boosted attacks. Encore is a less reliable option that locks foes into recovery or status moves, which gives Alakazam an opportunity to set up with Nasty Plot. Life Orb benefits from Magic Guard nullifying its recoil damage. Focus Sash is another option on more offensive teams, as it gives Alakazam an opportunity to revenge kill setup sweepers or use Nasty Plot.</p> <p>Other special setup sweepers like Latias, Galarian Slowking, and Volcarona appreciate Focus Blast Alakazam's ability to break past Unaware Clefable and certain RegenVest users like Slowking and Galarian Slowking, as this gives them opportunities to set up and sweep as well. These teammates also benefit from Alakazam's ability to absorb Toxic, which would otherwise put them on a timer. Alakazam is outsped by threats like Tornadus-T, Naganadel, and Pheromosa, so defensive teammates like Clefable, Mew, and Salamence can help check these threats while controlling entry hazards to support the team. Alakazam is prone to revenge killing from priority users like Rillaboom, Scizor, and Sucker Punch Lycanroc-D; Mew and Salamence can also help check these threats. Bulletproof Kommo-o counters Ghost / Fighting Alakazam and can check Dazzling Gleam variants with its typing, but Clefable, Mew, and Salamence can check it.</p> "

Rest gives Machoke better longevity and reliability in checking physical wallbreakers like Raboot, Thwackey, and Piloswine. Sleep Talk notably provides extra Dynamic Punch PP.

Machoke should only be brought in against physical threats it can take multiple hits from, like Raboot, Thwackey, Galarian Linoone, and Combusken, as being quickly forced to use Rest and Sleep Talk gives foes chances to set up. Because Machoke has trouble staying in on special attacks, walls like Klang, Mareanie, and Clefairy make for good teammates. Special attackers like Duosion, Gastly, and Galarian Mr. Mime greatly benefit from Machoke's Knock Off support and ability to deal with Steel-types in Klang and Ferroseed.

Bullet Punch picks off faster threats like Kadabra and Galarian Mr. Mime once they get worn down. Earthquake offers coverage for Mareanie and Neutralizing Gas Koffing, while Heavy Slam can hit physically defensive Fairy-types like Clefairy and Togetic that would otherwise wall this set. 44 Speed EVs allow Machoke to be faster than uninvested Piloswine, and the remaining HP and Attack investment solidifies Machoke's role as a bulky attacker.</p> <p>Machoke can work as an early-game lead, as it can threaten every Pokemon with its coverage while being hard to take down itself. However, Machoke is relatively slow, and wallbreakers like Choice Specs Magmar threaten it; try having fast revenge killers like Raboot and Drakloak as teammates for support. While Machoke takes physical hits well on its own, it can be worn down easily from residual damage, so pairing it with Tangela, Vullaby, and Mareanie can help alleviate pressure on it to check physical attackers.

Flame Charge can be run over High Horsepower or Will-O-Wisp to avoid being trapped by Diglett after a KOing a Pokemon. Alternatively, Wild Charge gives Ponyta a way to hit Water-types such as Wingull, Staryu, and Mareanie. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Pawniard, Trapinch, Mienfoo, and Onix. Morning Sun allows Ponyta to keep itself healthy and outlast a burned Trapinch's Earthquake.

Flame Body gives Ponyta a chance to burn physical attackers such as Mienfoo and Vullaby when they use contact moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Be wary about leaving Ponyta in or double switching to it if the opponent has a Diglett, because it can trap Ponyta and take care of it. Use Ponyta early-game to status Pokemon and cripple physical foes like Mienfoo and Trapinch with Will-O-Wisp. However, be wary about using Will-O-Wisp on Timburr, as Guts variants can use the Attack boost to KO Ponyta. Switch Ponyta into contact moves like Pawniard's Iron Head and Mienfoo's Fake Out to try to get a burn from Flame Body. Ponyta can also switch into predicted attacks from Spritzee, Ferroseed, and Foongus, as their attacks do not do much to it, and it can use the opportunity to do major damage to these with Flare Blitz or predict a switch and use High Horsepower or Will-O-Wisp. Make sure that entry hazards are not on the field before Ponyta tries to switch in, as they will cripple it. Use High Horsepower on a predicted switch to Onix or Mareanie. If running Flame Charge, use it on a predicted switch or on a weakened Pokemon to avoid Diglett coming in, trapping Ponyta, and taking care of it with Earthquake.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grass-types such as Foongus, Grookey, and Ferroseed are good to pair with Ponyta because they check Ground- and Water-types like Onix, Mudbray, and Staryu. Foongus can also use Spore to force switches and sponges attacks from Mienfoo, while Grookey provides passive recovery with Grassy Terrain. Ferroseed can use Thunder Wave to cripple Vullaby and opposing Ponyta that switch into Ponyta or use Knock Off to make it easier for Ponyta to KO them. Stealth Rock and Spikes setters like Onix and Ferroseed help Ponyta sweep late-game. Onix's Rock / Ground typing is especially useful to check Vullaby and opposing Ponyta; Ferroseed is able to come in on Water-type attacks from Staryu. Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Timburr, Vullaby, and Staryu remove Stealth Rock, which greatly hinders Ponyta from freely switching in; Vullaby and Timburr can also use Knock Off to soften Pokemon like Mareanie and Mienfoo, and Vullaby can also threaten Timburr and Mienfoo with its Flying STAB moves.

Switch Ponyta into predicted attacks from Ferroseed and Spritzee, as it takes their attacks well. Use Flame Charge on forced switches to allow Ponyta to outpace all of the unboosted metagame and most Choice Scarf users; this also stops Diglett from trapping it. Use Flare Blitz to do decent damage to most Pokemon, especially when Pokemon that resist it are KOed or have low HP. Use High Horsepower on predicted switches to Onix and Mareanie, and, if running Wild Charge, use it to OHKO Wingull and do major damage to Staryu. Be wary about switching into Knock Off users such as Vullaby and Pawniard, as Ponyta will lose its only way to recover HP, becoming easier to take care of. Ponyta can be kept until late-game to clean up weakened teams once trappers such as Trapinch and Diglett and Water-types like Wingull and Staryu are gone.

Only switch Ponyta into Stealth Rock when it is in range of Berry Juice to restore itself.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Counter-trappers like Trace Porygon and trappers like Trapinch are good to pair with Ponyta to get rid of Diglett. Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo go well with Ponyta because they can use Knock Off to get rid of items and make it easier to sweep. Dewpider is great to get down Sticky Web to let Ponyta outpace Pokemon like Abra, Staryu, and Diglett without needing to use Flame Charge. Defog and Rapid Spin users like Vullaby, Timburr, and Staryu are needed in order to prevent Ponyta from taking extra damage or being slowed down from Sticky Web. Timburr can also help against Onix, while Staryu can help with Ground-types like Mudbray and Drilbur. Onix, Mudbray, and Ferroseed help Ponyta sweep by setting entry hazards to wear down opposing Pokemon. Onix is also a great switch-in to Knock Off from Vullaby to keep Ponyta from losing its Berry Juice. Ferroseed can also help with Water-types like Staryu, while Mudbray can come in on opposing Onix's attacks.

Dazzling Gleam enables Galarian Ponyta to hit its checks such as Vullaby super effectively. Morning Sun allows Galarian Ponyta to keep itself healthy while setting up with Calm Mind. Protect is mainly used to avoid getting OHKOed by Trapinch's First Impression, but it can also serve as a way to play mind games with Sucker Punch users such as Pawniard. Psychic allows Galarian Ponyta to do major damage to Mareanie and Galarian Farfetch'd. Mystical Fire makes Galarian Ponyta able to OHKO Steel-types such as Ferroseed as well as 2HKO Pawniard, though it will raise Pawniard's Attack stat if it survives the attack.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Pastel Veil is used to avoid getting poisoned by Toxic Spikes and Sludge Bomb from Oddish and Mareanie. Running 196 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allows Galarian Ponyta to Speed tie with Wingull and outspeed Pokemon such as Onix and Galarian Farfetch'd. Life Orb can be used over Eviolite to net OHKOs on Vullaby and Trapinch after Stealth Rock damage; however, Eviolite is the preferred item so Galarian Ponyta can set up with Calm Mind more easily and take an attack from Wingull, which it could not do with Life Orb.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Make sure that Diglett and Trapinch are KOed before trying to sweep, as these two can trap Galarian Ponyta and OHKO it with Earthquake or, in the latter's case, First Impression if Galarian Ponyta is not running Protect. Use Protect to avoid being OHKOed by Trapinch's First Impression and play mind games with Pawniard's Sucker Punch. Galarian Ponyta should try to set up mid- to late-game to sweep once threats such as Pawniard, Frillish, and Vullaby are gone. It can also set up on Pokemon that do not threaten it like Mareanie and Oddish. Be careful around priority users such as Pawniard and Corphish, as these will either heavily chip or OHKO Galarian Ponyta. Avoid taking physical attacks from Pokemon such as Onix due to Galarian Ponyta's poor Defense stat.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Galarian Ponyta struggles with Munchlax, which is able to tank its attacks while taking care of it with Double-Edge, so Fighting-types like Timburr and Galarian Farfetch'd are good partners. Stealth Rock and Spikes setters like Onix and Ferroseed can set down entry hazards for Galarian Ponyta to make it easier to sweep late-game. Galarian Ponyta also appreciates having Stealth Rock up to help wear down Vullaby. Mudbray can also be used for its ability to take care of Pawniard and Onix while also setting up Stealth Rock. Galarian Ponyta struggles against Pawniard and Vullaby, so Pokemon such as Trapinch and Spritzee make great partners, as Trapinch can take care of Pawniard, while Spritzee can take care of Vullaby. Galarian Ponyta also struggles against Frillish, so having a Dark-type such as Pawniard is great to take care of it. Finally, Galarian Ponyta loves Sticky Web support from Dewpider to make it easier to set up and outpace Pokemon that it usually cannot such as Diglett.</p> "

These include Teleport, which synergizes well with Regenerator and allows a teammate to be brought in safely, and Slack Off, which gives it reliable healing, as well as Scald, Thunder Wave, and Fire Blast. However, Slowpoke is very slow, and its typing leaves it with weaknesses to STAB attacks from common presences such as Vullaby, Pawniard, Grookey, and Magnemite as well as common coverage from Pokemon Slowpoke tends to soft check throughout a match, such as Staryu's Thunderbolt, Timburr's and Mienfoo's Knock Off, and U-turn from a number of threats.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave can be used to cripple opposing Pokemon, which a slower teammate can take advantage of. Fire Blast threatens Ferroseed and Pawniard, and it eases prediction against teams carrying both Foongus and Pawniard. Zap Cannon super effectively hits the likes of Flying- and Water-types, but its inconsistent accuracy often makes it a poor choice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Knock Off and U-turn: Knock Off and U-turn are widespread moves that hit Slowpoke super effectively. Knock Off hinders Slowpoke in the long run and can be used quite easily on Slowpoke, since it is slow. Pokemon Slowpoke soft checks such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Mareanie can pack Knock Off. U-turn makes gaining momentum against Slowpoke by forcing it out a breeze, which can prove detrimental to teams needing the momentum Slowpoke could offer.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Vullaby, Pawniard, and Scraggy are immune to Slowpoke's Psychic-type moves and can take advantage of it being on the field. Pawniard can freely set Stealth Rock, and Nasty Plot Vullaby and Scraggy can set up on Slowpoke. Furthermore, Dark-types tend to pack a dreaded STAB Knock Off, threatening Slowpoke with an OHKO, and Vullaby can pack U-turn. However, these Dark-types dislike Scald burns and Thunder Wave, and Pawniard must beware of Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Ferroseed can take the free turns Slowpoke gives it to stack entry hazards, remove items with Knock Off, or spread paralysis. Grookey threatens Slowpoke with Grassy Glide and Wood Hammer, and it can set a Swords Dance up upon forcing Slowpoke out, which makes it an even bigger threat. Foongus can 2HKO Slowpoke with Giga Drain, but it struggles against Slowpoke's Psychic.

          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald threatens common switch-ins such as Pawniard, Vullaby, and Ferroseed with a burn. Future Sight is Slowpoke's main way of applying offensive pressure to foes, taking advantage of Slowpoke forcing Pokemon such as Foongus, Koffing, Mareanie, and Ponyta out and Psychic-resistant Pokemon in, which can be taken advantage of by teammates. Psychic is an alternative to Future Sight that allows it to hit foes directly. Teleport synergizes with Future Sight and Regenerator and can allow a threatening teammate to get on the field safely.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Regenerator allows Slowpoke to repeatedly switch into the likes of Abra, Vulpix, and Ponyta and check them throughout the game. 116 HP EVs give Slowpoke 27 HP, which means it will recover 9 HP with Regenerator. Both defenses reach even numbers to get the most out of Eviolite's boosts. The maximized Special Defense patches up Slowpoke's low natural special bulk. The EVs dumped into Special Attack ensure it can 2HKO Foongus with Psychic or deal decent damage to most targets with Future Sight. A spread more focused on physical bulk of 116 HP / 236 Def / 116 SpA / 36 SpD can be used, which allows Slowpoke to check Mudbray and Onix better at the cost of compromising special bulk. Slowpoke's Eviolite is very important to maintain its bulk in order to check threats throughout the game.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Slowpoke should be switched in against Pokemon it checks or soft checks when it is healthy. It should focus on finding room to launch Future Sight if running this attack and making good use of Teleport, taking advantage of forced switches to bring in threatening Pokemon safely. When its health is low, Slowpoke should be switched out to recover HP thanks to Regenerator. It can also use Slack Off when up against Pokemon it checks to keep itself healthy. Slowpoke should be wary of Knock Off, since it can reduce its effectiveness for the remainder of the game. As such, switching it in on Pokemon that oftentimes carry Knock Off such as Timburr and Mienfoo isn't a wise decision, even if Slowpoke resists their STAB moves and could otherwise freely switch in to be eligible for Regenerator. Scald should be used to threaten its usual switch-ins in Pawniard, Vullaby, and Ferroseed and when firing off a Future Sight isn't needed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Slowpoke is very weak to Knock Off, Knock Off absorbers such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Spritzee are great teammates. They like Slowpoke's ability to handle Psychic-, Fire-, and Poison-types and can handle the Dark-types Slowpoke tends to invite in. Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr also provide Knock Off support and can handle the Steel-types that Slowpoke often invites in well. Mienfoo and Slowpoke form a fairly good Regenerator core due to their pivoting moves, whereas Timburr can provide hazard removal to a team. Poison-types such as Foongus and Koffing handle Grookey and can remove Toxic Spikes from the field, which Slowpoke greatly appreciates. In turn, Slowpoke can handle threatening Psychic- and Fire-types for them. Ponyta can also check Grookey for Slowpoke and likes Slowpoke soft checking Water-types. Pokemon such as Grookey, Magnemite, and Vullaby form a VoltTurn core with Slowpoke and can cover some of its weaknesses. Strong attackers such as Choice item Mienfoo and Vulpix like Teleport support and Future Sight preventing common checks from stomaching an attack. Lastly, trappers such as Diglett and Trapinch can remove troublesome foes for Slowpoke, such as Magnemite and Pawniard, and like Teleport support.</p> "

Yawn helps Slowpoke gain momentum with Teleport, forcing the foe to either switch out or be put to sleep.

Future Sight allows Slowbro to create near-guaranteed advantageous situations for its team by providing a powerful delayed hit. This enables wallbreaking teammates to make more progress due to Future Sight by either discouraging their checks from switching in or letting them break through their checks anyway if these checks do switch in. Ice Beam can be run over Scald, allowing Slowbro to force out Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T while also threatening Pokemon not too bothered by Scald such as Zapdos and Tangrowth. Teleport allows Slowbro to use Pokemon that don't threaten it much, such as Mega Latias and Gliscor, for momentum, letting it bring in a check or a revenge killer for those Pokemon. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item, as it strengthens Slowbro's niche as a pivot and maximizes the effectiveness of Regenerator by negating entry hazard damage. Rocky Helmet is an alternative option to punish U-turn users such as Mega Lopunny and Victini. Slowbronite can be used for significantly improved physical bulk and Special Attack; however, be mindful of Slowbro losing Regenerator after Mega Evolving, which makes it a less effective defensive pivot.</p> <p>Slowbro mainly fits on bulky offense and balance teams, on which it can act as an amazing defensive pivot for teams that are weak to threats like Mega Lopunny, Gliscor, and Garchomp. On bulky offense teams, Blissey has great defensive synergy with Slowbro, covering up Slowbro's weaker Special Defense stat by checking some of the most dangerous special attackers in Calm Mind Clefable, Ash-Greninja, and Kyurem. Moreover, with access to Teleport, Blissey also forms a strong pivoting core with Slowbro. On more balanced teams, other specially defensive Pokemon such as Heatran, Clefable, and Ferrothorn can provide similar support. Wallbreakers highly benefit from Slowbro's presence, as they appreciate the momentum it can bring to teams with Teleport. Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Kyurem are great examples of Pokemon that benefit from Slowbro's support. If running Future Sight, Pokemon that appreciate the likes of Toxapex, Tangrowth, Zapdos, and Clefable being pressured are great teammates as well. Examples of such Pokemon include Weavile, Mega Lopunny, Kartana, and Mega Charizard Y. The former three are also capable of providing speed control against various Pokemon Slowbro might pivot out of, such as Calm Mind Mega Latias and Clefable.</p> "

Colorful coverage options allow for Slowbro to have several usable typings, but Ghost / Fighting and Water / Fighting typings offer it the most defensive utility. Shadow Ball Slowbro gains two great immunities to Fighting-type attacks like Close Combat and strong Normal-type moves like Extreme Speed, Facade, and Boomburst, allowing it to switch into attacks from threats like Entei, Heracross, and Kommo-o to scout and heal with Regenerator. Scald offers no immunities but gives Slowbro a number of useful resistances to Fire, Ice, and Water, which allow it to check physical threats such as Triple Axel Pheromosa, Fire-type Entei, and Aqua Tail Garchomp. Body Press takes advantage of Slowbro's naturally high defense and makes for a powerful attack that requires no offensive investment. Slack Off lets Slowbro recover without needing to switch out, which comes in handy against passive Pokemon like Blissey. Rocky Helmet lets Slowbro punish physical attackers by chipping away at their health, after which Slowbro just heals as it switches out. Leftovers is another option, but it is not as useful as Rocky Helmet because Slowbro already has two methods of healing. Heavy-Duty Boots is a third item option that allows Slowbro to pivot while Spikes and Toxic Spikes are on the field and reduces chip damage. A Relaxed nature with full defensive investment maximizes Slowbro's physical bulk and increases the power of Body Press, while minimum Speed lets Slowbro deal with Trick Room attackers and have the slowest possible Teleport for momentum.</p> <p>Slowbro appreciates specially defensive teammates such as Dark / Poison Unaware Clefable and Toxapex to handle the special attackers that force it out. These teammates also cover Slowbro's weaknesses to Ghost- and Psychic-type attacks and vulnerability to being poisoned and can help it gain momentum with Stealth Rock or Teleport from Clefable and Regenerator from Toxapex. Opposing Dark / Poison Clefable and Toxapex can also cripple Slowbro with Toxic and Knock Off, so physical wallbreakers like Garchomp and Melmetal make great offensive teammates that can pressure them. These wallbreakers also appreciate Slowbro's Teleport allowing them to safely switch into battle.</p> "

Its ability Oblivious helps it function as an effective PP staller, blocking Taunt from Pokemon like Corviknight, Haxorus, and Whimsicott. Iron Defense allows Slowbro to deal with physical powerhouses in the tier such as Galarian Darmanitan, Crustle, and Dracovish. Calm Mind covers Slowbro's mediocre Special Defense, which is useful against Pokemon such as Primarina and Salazzle, while also boosting the damage of Stored Power to defeat opposing stall Pokemon like Snorlax and Galarian Corsola. Slack Off allows Slowbro to heal damage taken while boosting its defensive stats. Rest is another recovery option that allows Slowbro to defeat Pokemon that use Toxic such as Chansey, but Slack Off is generally preferred to make it far less passive. Stored Power provides Slowbro with offensive capabilities that benefit from its defensive boosts, dealing with Pokemon such as Urshifu-R, Arcanine, and Kommo-o. The given EV spread with a Bold nature and the help of a Sitrus Berry is optimal for dealing with physical attackers like Haxorus and Galarian Darmanitan.</p> <p>Slowbro's main gameplan is to tank hits while setting up to improve its defensive capabilities. As such, Slowbro's passiveness leaves it vulnerable to Encore and Trick users like Primarina, Aromatisse, and Gardevoir. Against stall Rotom-W, use Calm Mind turn one, as Thunderbolt will deal less than 75% HP, activating Slowbro's Sitrus Berry. Afterwards, use Slack Off until it is around 80% health, then keep using Calm Mind and healing until Slowbro is at +3 and OHKO with Stored Power. Against any Zeraora variant, use Iron Defense immediately followed by Slack Off. From there, alternate between Slack Off and Iron Defense until Slowbro can 2HKO with Stored Power without getting 2HKOed itself. In terms of team options, Scyther is a fantastic partner to cover counters like Porygon-Z, Dragapult, Gardevoir, and Rillaboom. In return, Slowbro defeats Galarian Darmanitan and Crustle while also being extremely consistent against Zeraora. Fake Tears Sylveon is also a fantastic partner for Slowbro, due to its ability to take care of specially offensive threats like Primarina and Kyurem as well as Dark-types like Urshifu-S and Hydreigon. In return, Sylveon appreciates Slowbro handling Choice Band Crustle and Dracovish. Furthermore, Slowbro is quite slow, leaving it vulnerable to faster Pokemon like Choice Specs Porygon-Z and Rotom-H. Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Goodra are good options to alleviate that weakness.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Thanks to its amazing ability and typing, Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro can act as a great late-game cleaner. Its resistances let it stomach hits from the likes of Nihilego and Amoonguss, and its Poison STAB allows it to threaten Pokemon such as Primarina and Tangrowth. Galarian Slowbro's decent bulk and Regenerator let it come in multiple times to spam Sludge Bomb or Scald, wearing checks like Jirachi and Gastrodon down through potential poison and burns. It can similarly cripple offensive checks like Krookodile, Zarude, and Keldeo, which it can take a hit from and then switch out. Regenerator lets Galarian Slowbro easily set up even if it's been weakened or forced out early-game, and it's very difficult to take out once it gets going with Calm Mind. Its immunity to Toxic also contributes to its longevity. Being capable of using Colbur or Shuca Berry forces Pokemon like Zarude and Mamoswine to scout for its specific Berry. However, its very low Speed for a sweeper lets Pokemon like Krookodile, Diggersby, and Azumarill revenge kill it. Its special bulk is not good before setting up, leaving it weak to special attackers such as Primarina and Galarian Moltres. Galarian Slowbro can easily become setup fodder for Pokemon like Calm Mind Reuniclus and Suicune. Furthermore, it faces competition with Reuniclus as a Calm Mind sweeper because of its Magic Guard and ability to beat Pokemon like Celesteela more easily. Reuniclus is also not weak to Ground, easing matchups against Pokemon like Gastrodon and Nidoqueen.</p> ",

There exist Nasty Plot sets with Sludge Wave, Fire Blast, and either Psyshock or Grass Knot, with the former hitting Chansey and Chandelure and the latter hitting Krookodile harder. They use Quick Draw + Quick Claw to let Galarian Slowbro bypass its Speed sometimes, but this makes it lose a lot of bulk and become extremely vulnerable to Chandelure, Mamoswine, and Krookodile.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Choice Band Krookodile, Crawdaunt, and Galarian Moltres scare Galarian Slowbro with their Dark-type attacks. The former two do huge amounts of damage to Shuca Berry Galarian Slowbro, and even after consuming its Colbur Berry, Knock Off still does a good chunk. Galarian Moltres takes advantage of Galarian Slowbro's bad Special Defense before it sets up. They all have to be wary of poison and burns from its attacks, though.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Unaware Quagsire doesn't care about Galarian Slowbro's boosts. Rhyperior, Mamoswine, and Krookodile can remove Galarian Slowbro with their powerful Earthquakes, but they have to be wary of Scald and potential burns.

Psyshock has great synergy with Flamethrower, the former hitting Nihilego and Chansey while the latter targets Steel-types like Aegislash. Sludge Bomb is an option to cripple Pokemon like Galarian Moltres and Crawdaunt, while also doing more damage to Primarina and Hatterene. Scald is aimed at Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Krookodile, and it can burn physically offensive threats like Kommo-o. However, it will have a harder time dealing with Aegislash. Slack Off helps Galarian Slowbro pose a constant threat and set up on Pokemon like Celesteela. Shuca Berry does the same against Ground-types like Nidoking and Mamoswine. Kasib Berry lets you take a Shadow Ball from Aegislash and retaliate back with a boosted Flamethrower. Colbur Berry lets it take an attack like Zarude's Darkest Lariat and KO back. Safety Goggles is an option that lets Galarian Slowbro beat Amoonguss and stay in against Spore. A Bold nature and the given EV spread help against physical attackers such as Azumarill and Scizor. An EV spread of 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 SpD with a Bold nature avoids the 2HKO from Choice Specs Primarina's Moonblast, lets +1 Galarian Slowbro always take Choice Specs Chandelure's Shadow Ball, and improves its odds at beating Aegislash.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu is an exceptional teammate for its Grassy Terrain, which allows Galarian Slowbro to face Ground-types like Mamoswine and Rhyperior more easily. Tapu Bulu also takes on dangerous threats like Crawdaunt, while Galarian Slowbro removes Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth can remove Krookodile and Rhyperior, some the largest Ground-type threats to Galarian Slowbro. Due to Galarian Slowbro's low Speed, pivots that can get it in safely against setup fodder are ideal teammates. Jirachi and Zarude can use U-turn in front of Pokemon like Celesteela and Buzzwole. Raikou and Rotom-W can use Volt Switch on Grass-types and offensively check Chandelure. Galarian Slowbro appreciates Mienshao and Buzzwole checking Dark-types such as Krookodile and Crawdaunt. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Salamence and Rotom-W is needed. Strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Krookodile and Buzzwole can remove Calm Mind sweepers that beat Galarian Slowbro one-on-one like Suicune and Reuniclus.</p> "

Magneton can effectively take advantage of this thanks to its access to Volt Switch, putting opponents on the back foot while also generating momentum for its teammates. With the combination of Sturdy and Heavy-Duty Boots, Magneton can also act as a decent revenge killer, taking pressure off of its team against threats like Charizard and Lycanroc. However, the prevalence of Pokemon such as Lanturn, Lightning Rod Togedemaru, and Galarian Stunfisk makes walling Magneton easier for a lot of teams. Magneton's average Speed also leaves it outsped by common offensive threats like Gallade and Magmortar.

Other pivots such as Passimian and Tsareena pair well with Magneton, since they create a momentum core and help to exert increased pressure on opposing teams. These examples also threaten nuisances like Galarian Stunfisk and offer Knock Off support, while Magneton threatens physically bulky Pokemon like Weezing.

The former also offers Magneton vital Wish support, while the latter two can wear its switch-ins down with entry hazards, status, and, in Gigalith's case, sand. Pokemon like Sandaconda and Ribombee provide Magneton with speed control in Glare and Stun Spore, respectively, which gives it more opportunities to wallbreak by making it harder to immediately threaten out.

It also has impressive coverage options in Knock Off and Poison Jab; the former allows it to remove items, and the latter allows it to effectively pressure Spritzee. Its Speed tier also allows it to outspeed a good portion of the unboosted metagame and act as an effective Choice Scarf user, as it's able to most notably outspeed Choice Scarf Vullaby and +1 Corphish. However, Galarian Farfetch'd is greatly threatened by Pokemon that naturally outspeed it such as Ponyta, Galarian Ponyta, and Wingull, which can all either dish out heavy damage to it or cripple it with burns from Will-O-Wisp or Scald. Furthermore, Galarian Farfetch'd faces competition from Timburr, which offers better role compression and a semi-reliable recovery with Drain Punch, while Galarian Farfetch'd boasts access to Swords Dance and a better Speed tier.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Galarian Farfetch'd tends to have few other viable options available due to the brilliant coverage that the combination of Close Combat, Brave Bird, and Knock Off offers. A set running Life Orb and Substitute can be run, typically on Sticky Web offense teams to fully utilize Galarian Farfetch'd's Speed tier and allow it to always get a free attack in thanks to Substitute. Berry Juice can be used in place of Eviolite, giving Galarian Farfetch'd a form of passive recovery in exchange for extra bulk. An all-out attacking set can be used, forgoing Swords Dance for Poison Jab or Quick Attack, making Farfetch'd more of a standard wallbreaker rather than a sweeper. Quick Attack is a viable option on the Swords Dance set, allowing it to pick off faster, weakened foes; especially at +2; such as Ponyta, Galarian Ponyta, and Diglett. Defog could be used in place of Swords Dance or in place of Poison Jab on the Choice Scarf set if the role compression requires it. However, Timburr heavily outclasses Galarian Farfetch'd as a Fighting-type Defogger due to it having better bulk and recovery in Drain Punch. Eject Pack can be used as a way to use Close Combat on Mareanie or Spritzee and then trap them with Diglett or Trapinch.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Spritzee: Spritzee takes minimal damage from an unboosted Brave Bird and can recover it off with Wish and Protect while dishing out heavy damage with Moonblast. It does, however, have to be wary of Knock Off and Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: While it doesn't enjoy switching in on Knock Off, Galarian Ponyta naturally outspeeds Galarian Farfetch'd. Life Orb sets are able to OHKO Galarian Farfetch'd with Psychic, while Eviolite sets do a minimum of 81%. Wingull also KOes Galarian Farfetch'd with Hurricane or can cripple it with burns from Scald. None of them appreciate switching into Knock Off, though.</p> <p><strong>Vullaby: Vullaby is able to survive any unboosted attack, gain a +2 Speed boost thanks to Weak Armor, and OHKO Galarian Farfetch'd in return with Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Mareanie</strong>: Mareanie can shrug off any attack from Galarian Farfetch'd and recover off the damage. While it doesn't appreciate a boosted Brave Bird, it can set up with Iron Defense, leaving it unfazed by the boosts, as well as potentially burn it with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Koffing</strong>: Koffing has enough natural bulk to take little damage from Brave Bird and is able to cripple Galarian Farfetch'd with Will-O-Wisp.</p> ",

Close Combat is Galarian Farfetch'd's main attacking move, dishing out heavy damage to neutral targets, while Brave Bird hits common Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Oddish as well as Fighting-types like Timburr and opposing Galarian Farfetch'd for super effective damage. Knock Off is used to remove items from opposing Pokemon, making it easier to break through them.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature ensure that that Galarian Farfetch'd Speed ties threats such as Vullaby and Pawniard and hits them as hard as possible. The remaining EVs are placed in HP alongside an Eviolite to provide Galarian Farfetch'd with extra bulk and give it more opportunities to use Swords Dance. Scrappy enables Galarian Farfetch'd to hit Ghosts-types such as Frillish with Close Combat, allowing it to use the move with little drawback.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>While there are a large number of foes that Galarian Farfetch'd is able to beat one-on-one, it doesn't really appreciate switching in on most of the foes that beat it, as they can remove its Eviolite with Knock Off or cripple it with status from Body Slam or Thunder Wave. Bringing it in after a teammate has been KOed, through U-turn from Vullaby, or on a well-predicted double switch is recommended to avoid having Galarian Farfetch'd be in undesirable situations. Galarian Farfetch'd is better off attacking foes early-game, as using a single attack to break through teams can also bluff Choice Scarf sets. Early-game, Knock Off should be used to remove items from opposing Pokemon to make it easier for Galarian Farfetch'd to sweep. Once everything is in range of Galarian Farfetch'd's boosted attacks, it should try to look for an opportunity to set up on a Pokemon that matches up poorly against it, such as Munchlax, Ferroseed, or Pawniard, and proceed to sweep through the opposing team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance Farfetch'd does well on a variety of teams due to most of its checks and counters generally having a difficult time actively switching into it. Sticky Web support from Dewpider is fantastic for Galarian Farfetch'd, as it allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier, making it incredibly difficult to switch into. Ferroseed is an especially useful partner, as it's able to potentially offer Spikes support while also being one of the most consistent checks to Spritzee and potentially immobilizing faster threats such as Ponyta and Galarian Ponyta with Thunder Wave. Pawniard's and Onix's resistance to Flying-type attacks is also incredibly appreciated by Galarian Farfetch'd, as they provide the team with a much-needed switch-in to Vullaby. VoltTurn support from Chinchou and Vullaby is very useful to make it easier for Galarian Farfetch'd to enter the battlefield. Trapping support from Diglett is also greatly appreciated by Galarian Farfetch'd, as they can both assist each other in removing Mareanie, and Diglett is also able to utilize its Speed tier to trap and remove faster threats such as Ponyta and Galarian Ponyta, making Galarian Farfetch'd harder to revenge kill.</p> "

It's especially important to consider what moves Choice Scarf Galarian Farfetch'd is locking itself into, as Close Combat has low PP, and Galarian Farfetch'd is quite vulnerable to being KOed in return if it fails to land a KO with Close Combat due to the drops in Defense and Special Defense, while the recoil damage from Brave Bird can result in Galarian Farfetch'd being worn down rather quickly. Poison Jab should only really be used against Spritzee, as being locked into the move can result in Galarian Farfetch'd giving away free opportunities for Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Pawniard to set entry hazards while also providing Pawniard with the opportunity to set up with Swords Dance freely.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Vullaby and Chinchou are useful partners for Galarian Farfetch'd, as their VoltTurn support makes it easier for it to switch into the battlefield, while both partners can appreciate Galarian Farfetch'd's ability to remove Ferroseed and Pawniard as well as Onix after some chip damage. Vullaby is an especially noteworthy partner, as its Knock Off makes Galarian Farfetch'd's job easier by removing additional bulk from Mareanie, Koffing, and Spritzee. Ferroseed is especially useful as well, as it's able to potentially offer Spikes support while also being one of the most consistent checks to Spritzee. Furthermore, it provides the team with a more reliable answer to Oddish and additional Knock Off support, which makes it easier for Galarian Farfetch'd to break through teams. Wallbreakers such as Corphish and Timburr are valuable partners, as they provide teams with more offensive presence while also having access to priority moves, assisting Galarian Farfetch'd with revenge killing faster foes, which can be especially useful for dealing with Dragon Dance Onix, which outspeeds Galarian Farfetch'd at +1 and is able to KO it with Earthquake.</p> "

Icicle Spear and Rock Blast are both multi-hit moves, which are quite unique in LC because each hit is deceptively strong on its own due to the lower level of Pokemon, and the fact that each hit has its own damage roll means there is a greater chance that one of those hits will be a high damage roll. This causes the multi-hit moves to do more damage than Shellder's STAB Liquidation against most threats. Icicle Spear is the go-to move against most Pokemon, as it has perfect accuracy, taking care of Vullaby, Onix, and Trapinch with ease and OHKOing neutral targets like Wingull and Galarian Farfetch'd after Shell Smash. Rock Blast is used to target foes that resist Ice such as Thick Fat Munchlax, Ponyta, and Water-types like Corphish and Mareanie. For the last slot, STAB Liquidation rounds out Shellder's coverage, as it is the best way to hit Pawniard and Mudbray and is the most reliable way to not activate Berry Juice on users such as Munchlax. Ice Shard is useful to avoid being revenge killed by fast Choice Scarf users like Diglett and to set up against and beat both Onix and Vullaby after a Weak Armor boost. Protect is also an option to primarily block First Impression from Trapinch as well as Fake Out from Meowth and can be used to stall out the sun or poisoned Pokemon if necessary.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Eviolite gives Shellder extra bulk, so it has an easier time setting up. The EV spread maximizes Shellder's offenses stats, allowing it to outspeed +1 Speed Onix and Drilbur after Shell Smash, with the remaining EVs going into HP and Defense for more survivability. With a Jolly nature, Shellder can outspeed Adamant Corphish before Shell Smash, and after a Shell Smash, Shellder can outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under Sticky Web and up to 19 Speed Choice Scarf users normally. An Impish nature makes it easier to set up on physical Pokemon like Onix and to tank priority moves after setting up such as Mach Punch from Timburr or Sucker Punch from Diglett. Lastly, an Adamant nature is an option that gives Shellder an easier time to get past Berry Juice Onix and 15 Defense Eviolite users like Timburr.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When attempting a sweep, it is best to remove or weaken any Pokemon Shellder has a hard time beating, such as Ferroseed and Mareanie, and also to remove threatening Pokemon such as Chinchou. Pokemon with access to priority moves like Timburr and Pawniard should also be removed as to not risk ending a sweep prematurely. If it is necessary to set up before these checks are removed, be mindful of the damage you take, as every extra bit of damage taken means Shellder will have a harder time setting up or tanking priority moves. Although it should not switch into them directly, physically inclined Pokemon, most notably Onix and Vullaby, are prime setup fodder for Shellder, as its high Defense stat allows it to tank their hits well. It also helps if the Pokemon Shellder sets up on is initially faster as to not take extra damage due to Shell Smash dropping defenses. Shellder could also be sent in early- or mid-game if it wants to weaken any checks, as they still take a great deal from its multi-hit moves; however, it should try to avoid any damage, as that can give it difficulties setting up later on.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with Knock Off make for great teammates, as they can soften up walls like Mareanie, Spritzee, and Ferroseed by removing their Eviolite and Berry Juice. Vullaby is a great teammate because it has Knock Off, can lure in threats like Onix that Shellder can set up on and pivot it in safely thanks to U-turn, and can remove troublesome entry hazards with Defog. Galarian Farfetch'd and Timburr too carry Knock Off and Defog, and they can deal with Ferroseed and Munchlax easily while functioning as good wallbreakers. Entry hazard support from Onix, Ferroseed, and Pawniard is great at chipping away the opponent's Pokemon, which can aid Shellder tremendously with achieving KOs it would otherwise narrowly miss out on, with Ferroseed and Pawniard also able to carry Knock Off. Trappers like Trapinch and Diglett can remove troublesome Pokemon like Mareanie, Pawniard, and Chinchou, with Diglett being able to provide Memento support to greatly help Shellder upon setting up. Since Shellder is vulnerable to all entry hazards, Pokemon that can remove them such as the aforementioned Vullaby and Galarian Farfetch'd as well as Drilbur are well appreciated to give Shellder more longevity when attempting to sweep.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Shell Smash Cloyster's ability to potentially break past its checks through flinches make it a threatening setup sweeper. It also takes advantage of teams relying on Seismitoad and Gastrodon as their bulky Water-type, as neither is a suitable Cloyster check. Rock Blast hits Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune neutrally, helping Cloyster beat them with flinches. It also hits Volcanion and can be used against other Fire-types like Incineroar and Chandelure. Hydro Pump is the preferred last move due to its greater damage against Steel-types such as Metagross, Cobalion, and Steelix. Liquidation can be used instead to OHKO Diancie and potentially 2HKO Registeel after Spikes damage while also giving Cloyster a more reliable Water-type STAB move. However, it makes Cloyster more reliant on breaking past the aforementioned Steel-types with flinches. King's Rock gives Cloyster's Icicle Spear and Rock Blast an effective 41% flinch chance. A Naive or Jolly nature should be used, as they allow +2 Cloyster to outrun Choice Scarf Mienshao. Explosion can be used to take down Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune for a teammate. Focus Sash can be used to almost guarantee setup, but this requires solid entry hazard removal, and Cloyster loses out on the ability to break past its checks with flinches. Life Orb is another item option that allows Cloyster to KO notable threats such as Cobalion, Galarian Weezing, Metagross, and Doublade at +2 without prior residual damage. Spikes allows Cloyster, which beats most Defoggers, to give value to its team in a matchup where it doesn't do much else. However, Spikes also forces Cloyster to ditch its Water-type STAB moves, which worsens its matchup against Steel-types significantly.</p> <p>Cloyster's natural physical bulk is impressive even without investment and gives it some notable setup opportunities against Pokemon such as Darmanitan, Crobat lacking Taunt, and Mimikyu. Cloyster is potentially capable of breaking past its defensive answers with flinches, but this requires a fair bit of luck. Bulky Water- and Steel-types can halt Cloyster barring an ill-timed flinch, so efforts should be put into wearing these Pokemon down. Most of the tier's bulky Steel-types will get worn down by Spikes; offensive Metagross, Cobalion, and Doublade will be in KO range of +2 Hydro Pump after switching in with three layers of Spikes, while Liquidation variants will be able to reliably 2HKO Registeel after two layers. Therefore, Spikes setters like Klefki and Roserade are good teammates. Cloyster's ability to take advantage of Spikes and cause its targets to flinch makes it a great choice for hyper offense teams, as it can be a devastating wincon or a supportive wallbreaker for another sweeping teammate such as Necrozma, Mimikyu, or Polteageist. Cloyster is also capable of sweeping on standard offensive and bulky offensive teams. Teams utilizing Cloyster in this regard should attempt to wear down bulky Water- and Steel-types. Knock Off from the likes of Incineroar, Reuniclus, and Obstagoon can remove Leftovers from Pokemon like Registeel and Suicune, making it easier for Cloyster to break through them. Pivoting teammates, such as Mienshao, Incineroar, and Crobat, can get Cloyster into battle safely. Toxic from Diancie and Salazzle can help wear down Water-types to let Cloyster go wild late-game.</p> "

Shell Smash combined with Focus Sash, Skill Link, and STAB Icicle Spear lets it reliably set up and OHKO leads like Excadrill and Slurpuff through their Focus Sashes. Its access to Rapid Spin is also valuable, compacting the role of entry hazard remover. Knock Off users such as Yveltal especially like Spikes because they can remove Heavy-Duty Boots, which helps them sweep later on. However, Cloyster is held back by its low Speed, making it susceptible to Taunt; also, its poor typing and defensive stats mean that it will be on the field only once most of the time. Finally, it faces severe competition with other leads, with Froslass and Aerodactyl having great Speed and Taunt for more consistent hazard setting, Shuckle having Sturdy + Mental Herb, and Galvantula and Ribombee having great Speed alongside paralysis.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Explosion can be used to inflict surprise high damage to any Pokemon that would like to Defog, in addition to preventing it from being used. Liquidation punishes Pokemon that resist Icicle Spear, but the average Attack of Cloyster means that any Pokemon not weak to Water will not take a lot of damage from it, even after Shell Smash. Toxic Spikes can be chosen as a better option against offensive teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: With Necrozma-DM's astonishing bulk and Steel typing, Cloyster will do little to no damage to it, even when boosted. Moreover, it can set Stealth Rock easily, and its use of Rocky Helmet can spinblock Cloyster effectively.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Leads like Grimmsnarl and Froslass can use Taunt before Cloyster can do anything, preventing it from setting up Spikes. Froslass is also immune to Rapid Spin and can set several layers of Spikes for its team before being taken down by Icicle Spear.</p> <p><strong>Fast Pivots: Pivots like Regieleki and Pheromosa can break Cloyster's Focus Sash with Volt Switch or U-turn and come back later in the game to use Rapid Spin. Their common use of Heavy-Duty Boots also means that they won't be damaged by Cloyster's Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Pokemon like Kyogre and Calyrex-S can limit Cloyster to a single layer of Spikes before KOing it or forcing it to switch. Calyrex-S also spinblocks Cloyster, and Choice Scarf sets can cripple it with Trick and outspeed it even after Shell Smash. Kyogre's Thunder can additionally paralyze Cloyster, but it's afraid of taking a boosted Explosion.</p> ",

It is also able to sweep opposing Ice teams, thus aiding in the mirror matchups.

Mamoswine, Piloswine, and Froslass provide entry hazard support with Stealth Rock and Spikes to wear down foes, allowing Cloyster to sweep more easily. In addition, Froslass has access to Taunt to deny entry hazards from the opposing team, making sure that Cloyster's Focus Sash is intact. Galarian Mr. Mime and Avalugg are good teammates that provide Rapid Spin support to ensure that Cloyster's Focus Sash remains intact. In particular, Galarian Mr. Mime fits better on the offensive teams that leverage Cloyster thanks to its high Speed and can also cripple Pokemon with Trick, potentially giving Cloyster a free setup opportunity.</p> "

Gengar has great coverage in the form of Focus Blast to hit Pokemon that resist its STAB like Tyranitar, and Dazzling Gleam for Dragon-types like Kommo-o and Hydreigon that tend to be difficult for Poison-types to take down.</p> <p>Gengar is a frail Pokemon, so Toxapex is an incredible teammate, as it absorbs hits for it. It is particularly useful against threats with priority like Mimikyu and Bisharp. Drapion is able to switch into the super effective Psychic-, Dark-, and Ghost-type attacks that are used against Gengar. Roserade helps it handle Ground-type Pokemon while also setting Spikes, which makes Gengar's late-game cleaning easier. Toxtricity can bring Gengar in with Volt Switch and beat Pokemon like Corviknight and Toxapex that would otherwise come in and wall Gengar. Toxicroak breaks the special walls, like Snorlax, that would otherwise hinder Gengar's sweep. Galarian Weezing provides a Ground immunity and can remove entry hazards with Defog, allowing Gengar to come in more freely during the game. Moreover, it serves as another Dark-resistant teammate to support Gengar. Vileplume helps Gengar by checking Excadrill, which greatly threatens Poison-type teams. Salazzle also aids Gengar by threatening Steel-type teams and withering down other types with a Substitute + Toxic set.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Mega Gengar is a very potent pick in AG due to its ability to trap every Pokemon slower than it with careful predictions and force the opponent into using Dynamax in order to escape its clutches. Therefore, it is able to simultaneously fill the roles of offensive support, wallbreaker, stallbreaker, and revenge killer. Shadow Ball is its most consistent STAB move, having few resistances and allowing it to dispose of Pokemon it has successfully trapped. Encore is its main tool in order to put foes in a checkmate position, as Mega Gengar can utilize it to force Pokemon into using a non-damaging and non-phazing move such as Toxic, Defog, Stealth Rock, or Recover, thus creating free turns for itself that it can use to gradually damage and take out the trapped Pokemon. Encore's sheer presence also discourages the opponent from using status moves, in general, after Gengar has Mega Evolved, which Mega Gengar's team can take advantage of. However, keep in mind that Dynamax and Z-Moves bypass Encore. Substitute is mandatory in order to safely Mega Evolve against slower threats, escape Pursuit from Tyranitar, provide insurance against faster threats attempting to revenge kill Mega Gengar such as Zacian-C and Ditto, and most importantly, to secure itself against Max Moves should its target attempt to catch it off guard with Dynamax. Focus Blast along with Substitute drastically improves the matchup against Tyranitar, allowing Mega Gengar to discourage Tyranitar from switching in as well as trap it if it is slightly weakened. Sludge Wave may be run if trapping Tyranitar is not necessary, as it provides Mega Gengar with a more reliable move in order to take care of trapped Normal-types such as Smeargle, Chansey, and Arceus. It also enables Mega Gengar to trap Xerneas with a careful double switch. Nasty Plot is another option that turns Mega Gengar into a potent wincon and pairs nicely with the abundance of free turns it is able to provide itself with Encore. It also allows Mega Gengar to overwhelm targets trapped into a recovery move in a more reliable fashion than relying on Shadow Ball drops.</p> <p>Mega Gengar fits best on balance and bulky offensive teams that benefit from its trapping prowess and provide it with a sturdy defensive backbone. In a worst-case scenario, Mega Gengar always forces the opponent into sacrificing their Pokemon or using Dynamax, provided it has Mega Evolved and is brought in on a status move. Therefore, Pokemon that appreciate the opponent’s Dynamax gone, such as Xerneas, Yveltal, and Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, are extremely potent partners. Moreover, Mega Gengar can also remove their checks in Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, Tyranitar, and support Arceus formes. Mega Gengar cannot deal with faster Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Pokemon that have boosted their Speed such as Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza and Ultra Necrozma. Therefore, Pokemon that can check these threats, such as Ditto, Necrozma-DM, and Primal Groudon for the former and defensive Zygarde-C and Lunala for the latter two, are very useful teammates. Mega Gengar also has an abysmal matchup against Yveltal. Thus, Tyranitar and specially defensive Ho-Oh are great teammates. Tyranitar is also capable of Pursuit trapping a transformed Ditto as well as Lunala, which Mega Gengar cannot trap. Furthermore, Mega Gengar heavily discourages entry hazard removal. Thus, harnessing this ability with an entry hazard-stacking core consisting of Ferrothorn and Necrozma-DM is a sensible choice.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Mega Gengar is also capable of running a utility set in order to trap Pokemon in a more secure fashion. Perish Song always allows Mega Gengar to remove its targets after three turns. This is particularly useful for trapping Normal-types such as Chansey and Arceus, sleeping Tyranitar, Primal Groudon, and Zygarde-C, and Pokemon forced into using their recovery move. Alternatively, Shadow Ball may be run in order to eliminate targets by means of direct damage instead. Destiny Bond is an option that always allows Mega Gengar to force a trade with slower foes, which is very useful if it isn’t needed anymore or direly needs remove a Pokemon for a teammate. It also works very well with Encore, as Pokemon that may attempt to escape Destiny Bond by using status moves are locked into them by Encore regardless. However, Dynamax ignores the effects of Destiny Bond, and phazing moves from the likes of Ho-Oh also shut down this strategy. Disable is another option that, in tandem with Substitute, allows Mega Gengar to more securely trap Pokemon that only have one way of harming it, such as Ferrothorn and certain Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and support Arceus variants. In combination with Encore, it also lets Mega Gengar force the target into using Struggle. However, Pokemon with more than one attack, such as defensive Dragon Tail Zygarde-C and Brave Bird Ho-Oh, can simply alternate between them in order to avoid the effects of Disable. Moreover, Disable's effects are ignored by Dynamax and Z-Moves, and it also cannot prevent Mega Gengar from being phazed. The given EV spread optimizes Mega Gengar's Speed in order to quickly use Encore on as many targets as possible while improving its general bulk. A 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe EV spread is to be run with Shadow Ball in order to maximize damage output.</p> <p>This Mega Gengar set also fits best on balance and bulky offensive teams that benefit from its ability to trap key Pokemon and provide it with a defensive backbone it can fall back on. Generally, it's safer to use Substitute first with this set after switching into a status move in order to scout for the target Dynamaxing immediately, should it predict Encore. Thanks to Destiny Bond or Disable, the opportunity to trap it won't be lost if it simply attacks without Dynamaxing instead. However, if running Disable over Destiny Bond, Mega Gengar should be more aggressive with using Encore first whenever it comes in on a status move from Pokemon with more than one attack, as otherwise, the opportunity to trap its target will be lost. This set always forces the opponent into sacrificing their Pokemon or using Dynamax at worst if Mega Gengar has Mega Evolved and is brought in on a status move. Thus, Pokemon that appreciate the opponent’s Dynamax gone, such as Xerneas, Yveltal, and Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, remain ideal partners. Mega Gengar still cannot deal with faster threats such as Zacian-C and Pokemon that have boosted their Speed such as Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza and Ultra Necrozma. Therefore, Pokemon that can check these threats, such as Ditto, Necrozma-DM, and Primal Groudon for the former and defensive Zygarde-C and Lunala for the latter two, remain very useful teammates. Mega Gengar also has an abysmal matchup against Yveltal, which does not fear even Destiny Bond due to Dynamax blocking it. Thus, Tyranitar and specially defensive Ho-Oh continue to be great teammates. If running Perish Song, this set has a much easier time trapping defensive Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Zygarde-C, and Primal Groudon while they are asleep, as it can be hard switched into them on the turn after they use Rest and proceed to use Perish Song. Therefore, it is better tailored to status inducers such as Ho-Oh, defensive Necrozma-DM, and defensive Primal Kyogre, which often tend to force Rest on Mega Gengar's aforementioned targets.</p> "

Its part Rock typing and high natural Speed and Defense make it a solid check to major threats like Vullaby and Ponyta. Its suite of abilities lets it wear many hats; with Weak Armor, it can be a potent revenge killer and force fast threats like Ponyta out, and with Rock Head alongside Dragon Dance, it can harness the power of Head Smash and become a devastating sweeper. Additionally, Sturdy and Berry Juice can make Onix a blanket check to threats in the metagame due to its durability. Despite these many great qualities, though, the metagame is rife with Onix checks, and Onix must beware the ever-present Arena Trap users, Trapinch and Diglett, as well as common Fighting-, Water-, Grass-, and Ground-types. Onix can also be a difficult team fit as an entry hazard setter that does not deal well with the tier's special attackers while struggling with the ubiquitous Mienfoo.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stone Edge is an option on Weak Armor and Sturdy Onix to more reliably OHKO standard Vullaby, though it falls short against Eviolite variants. Life Orb allows Rock Head Onix to hit hard enough to surprise and overwhelm would-be checks, though it greatly sacrifices durability.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Mienfoo's exceptional physical bulk and Regenerator allow it to come into Onix repeatedly and threaten it out with High Jump Kick or make progress with Knock Off or U-turn. Timburr resists Rock Blast and Head Smash, can KO Onix with Drain Punch while keeping itself healthy, and can remove Stealth Rock with Defog. Mach Punch also threatens weakened Dragon Dance and Weak Armor Onix. Timburr can be worn down by repeatedly switching into Earthquake, though, and Onix can both KO a weakened Timburr and deny Defog with Explosion. Scraggy can set up on Onix with Dragon Dance, though it must be wary of Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Arena Trap Users: Diglett and especially Trapinch can trap and KO Onix. Onix must beware switching into Vullaby's U-turn if either Arena Trap user is on the opposing team, although Weak Armor can prevent Diglett from KOing Onix. Trapinch switches into any attack from Onix with relative ease and can both keep itself healthy and KO Onix with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Grookey: Grookey weaks Onix's Earthquake with Grassy Terrain while threatening a OHKO with Grassy Glide.

          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Onix's most reliable move, threatening common Ground-weak Pokemon like Pawniard, Ponyta, and Mareanie while dealing decent damage to neutral foes. High Horsepower should be run on teams with Grookey as its damage is not reduced by Grassy Terrain, though it is slightly less reliable. Rock Blast is the best Rock-type move thanks to the way the damage of multi-hit moves is calculated in LC, and it deals heavy damage to Vullaby and breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy on Pokemon like Abra and Dwebble. Stealth Rock provides crucial entry hazard support. Explosion doles out a massive hit and maintains offensive momentum in situations after Stealth Rock has been set when Onix is likely to be KOed, such as against Eviolite Diglett and Trapinch. Taunt is a niche option that can prevent sweepers like Scraggy and Nasty Plot Vullaby from setting up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Weak Armor paired with Eviolite allows Onix to take a physical hit and threaten back with its boosted Speed. This Speed boost even allows it to beat some Choice Scarf and Shell Smash users, outspeed Ponyta after switching into a hit, and prevent Diglett trapping Onix following an opposing Vullaby's U-turn. Maximum Speed and Attack investment with a Jolly nature bolsters Onix's otherwise lackluster offensive presence while allowing it to always outspeed Vullaby and Pawniard and Speed tie with 17 Speed Pokemon like Mienfoo, Grookey, and Natu.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Weak Armor Onix should be used to set Stealth Rock while being strategically deployed to check faster physical threats with Weak Armor boosts. This set is among the most effective offensive checks to Ponyta and physically offensive Vullaby, as it outspeeds Ponyta after taking an attack and Diglett after an opposing Vullaby U-turn; however, beware Ponyta's Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Weak Armor Onix fits well on many teams thanks to its ability to reliably check threats like Vullaby and Ponyta while providing revenge killing utility and entry hazard support. It partners well with Foongus and Ferroseed, as they switch into Water- and Ground-types well while Onix checks Vullaby and Ponyta for them. Mareanie, Koffing, and Spritzee check Fighting-types like Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy. Finally, Vullaby can switch into bulky Ground-types like Mudbray and Grass-types like Foongus.

High Horsepower is the alternative STAB of choice for teams with Grookey. Rock Blast takes advantage of the power of multi-hit moves in LC, hits Vullaby hard, and breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy on Pokemon like Abra and Dwebble. Stealth Rock supports offensive teams by pressuring and wearing down the opposing team's switch-ins. Explosion allows Onix to generate momentum after its Berry Juice has been used and heavily damages checks like Trapinch and Timburr while preventing them from healing. Against Mienfoo, Onix can use Explosion to prevent it from pivoting with U-turn and facilitate a Diglett trap. Dragon Dance is an option in tandem with Sturdy, as the ability makes Onix difficult to KO while it sets up, though it is limited by need to run Rock Blast over Head Smash. Endure is an option that lets Onix survive a hit and consume its Berry Juice, bringing it back to full health and reactivating Sturdy, which can be useful for revenge killing sweepers and stalling out sun turns. Taunt is an option to prevent foes from setting entry hazards or setting up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The combination of Sturdy and Berry Juice grants Onix multiple guaranteed turns of survivability to set Stealth Rock and potentially check offensive threats late-game. Maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Onix to hit as hard as possible and outpace Vullaby and Pawniard, and the remaining investment in HP allows Onix to heal the maximum amount from Berry Juice.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Sturdy Onix should be deployed early-game when opposing entry hazards are not set to best maintain its durability. This set can set guaranteed Stealth Rock against most opposing leads apart from hazard removers and should do so early and aggressively. Strong entry hazard control of your own can be used to preserve Onix as a check against opposing sweepers that may struggle to break though the combination of Berry Juice and Sturdy while Onix wears them down with its own attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Sturdy Onix fits best on team archetypes that need guaranteed Stealth Rock support such as offensive Sticky Web, sun, dual screens. Due to its weakness to Knock Off, Onix appreciates teammates like Foongus and Mareanie that can switch into common Knock Off users like Mienfoo and Timburr. Staryu removes opposing hazards and allows Onix to preserve its Sturdy while also leaving your own entry hazards up. This set is especially vulnerable to Vullaby's U-turn paired with an Arena Trap user, so it pairs well with another Flying-resistant Pokemon like Pawniard, although a second Fighting-weak Pokemon may strain your defensive core.</p> "

Mienfoo can remove items from bulky Pokemon like Foongus and Spritzee that Onix otherwise struggles to break through. Foongus and Ferroseed switch well into Ground-types, Staryu, and Grookey, which threaten Onix.

Unfortunately, Alolan Marowak struggles to find wallbreaking opportunities, and it is also revenge killed easily due to its low Speed stat, vulnerability to Stealth Rock, weaknesses to common types, and mediocre bulk. Swords Dance lets Alolan Marowak break through every wall in RU after one boost. Alternatively, Flame Charge alongside a Jolly nature can be used to prevent it from being outsped and revenge killed by Pokemon such as Guts Heracross, Chandelure, and Choice Band Tyrantrum after one boost. However, even after one boost, it is still slower than many common threats like Obstagoon, Mienshao, and Noivern. Earthquake 2HKOes Incineroar after Intimidate and provides a stronger hit against Volcanion and Diancie. However, Low Kick gets an OHKO on Obstagoon, hits Snorlax much harder, and deals more damage than Fire Punch to some bulky Steel-types, such as Registeel and Steelix.</p> <p>An entry hazard remover like Noivern, Crobat, or Togekiss is crucial to pair with Alolan Marowak, as every entry hazard, especially Stealth Rock, limits its ability to switch into the mentioned threats. Offensive pivots like Noivern, Xurkitree, and Raikou support Alolan Marowak with free switches into defensive Pokemon it defeats easily, such as Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Cresselia. Roserade checks Water-types, Golisopod checks Ground-types like Flygon, and both provide Spikes support. In general, Alolan Marowak appreciates bulky teammates like Togekiss, Seismitoad, and Steelix, since it's easily revenge killed by many Pokemon due to its low base Speed and common weaknesses. Wish support from Togekiss and Sylveon helps Alolan Marowak to stay healthy. Powerful late-game cleaners like Choice Scarf Heracross and Choice Scarf Xurkitree appreciate Alolan Marowak's wallbreaking capabilities.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Koffing is a naturally bulky defensive Pokemon that checks common Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Grookey, and Foongus. In fact, many physical attackers have a difficult time switching into Koffing, as opponents may be wary of a potential Will-O-Wisp. Neutralizing Gas prevents Koffing from being trapped by Arena Trap users such as Diglett and Trapinch and also negates Regenerator from Pokemon like Mienfoo and Foongus, making it an even better defensive Pokemon. On the offensive side, Koffing has useful coverage moves in Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, and Sludge Bomb that let it threaten common bulky cores like Spritzee, Mareanie, and Ferroseed.</p> <p>However, Koffing's poor base Special Defense makes it very susceptible to special attackers and means it often gets OHKOed by a STAB Psychic-type attack from the likes of Abra. This weakness is exacerbated by its lackluster Speed tier. Koffing also doesn't have a consistent way to recover HP, which limits its role as a defensive check.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Koffing can run a plethora of other moves. Thief can be used to steal back an item, since Koffing is a common Knock Off target. This can be used in tandem with Berry Juice, which is a great way to heal but opens Koffing up to a stronger Knock Off. Koffing can also use Pain Split as a form of recovery, but it isn't very consistent. Clear Smog is a good way to check setup sweepers, while Toxic Spikes can wear down bulky walls such as Spritzee and Shellos. Levitate can be used so Earthquake from Onix, Trapinch, and Diglett doesn't OHKO Koffing, preventing Arena Trap, and being unaffected by Spikes and Sticky Web. However, it makes it a far less effective Mienfoo check, as it will lose the long term game without recovery. Finally, Koffing can run a purely defensive set with a spread of 36 HP / 236 Def / 236 SpD so it can take even more hits from strong physical attackers such as Corphish, but the set completely takes out Koffing's offensive capabilities, making it a very passive Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types / Psychic-type coverage: Psychic-types such as Galarian Ponyta and Abra have a really easy time KOing Koffing with their super effective STAB special attacks. Even non-STAB Psychic from the likes of Spritzee can deal more than 50% damage. However, even though neither Galarian Ponyta nor Natu is scared of being poisoned, they wouldn't like taking a Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Ponyta: Even though Ponyta doesn't like switching into a Sludge Bomb, it can switch into a Fire Blast or a Will-O-Wisp and get a Flash Fire boost, which makes Flare Blitz even more powerful.</p> <p><strong>Mudbray and Onix</strong>: Even though these two Pokemon are checked by Koffing, Koffing doesn't have any coverage moves to deal significant damage to them.

Fire Blast complements Sludge Bomb, hitting targets that tank the latter such as Pawniard, Foongus, and Ferroseed. Will-O-Wisp neuters physical attackers such as Timburr and wears down Pokemon such as Mudbray and Onix that Koffing doesn't have coverage moves against. Thunderbolt pressures Flying and Water-types such as Wingull and Mareanie and prevents Koffing from being setup fodder to the likes of Nasty Plot Vullaby.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Koffing to outspeed and apply greater pressure to Pokemon such as slow Mienfoo, Dewpider, Timburr, and most Mudbray. Maximum Special Attack EVs are invested to get comfortable 2HKOs on Pokemon such as Pawniard, Mareanie, and Spritzee. Finally, the HP EVs enable Koffing to take advantage of its solid bulk and avoid being 2HKOed by a Flare Blitz from Ponyta. Eviolite allows Koffing to be even more tanky and helps absorbs Knock Offs from the likes of Mienfoo and Pawniard. Neutralizing Gas significantly lowers Mienfoo's longevity and prevents Koffing from being trapped by Diglett, Trapinch, or Wynaut.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Koffing can easily switch in to many common unboosted attackers such as Pawniard, Foongus, and Timburr and can cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Koffing should stay away from counters like Galarian Ponyta and Onix, and they should be removed from the game as soon as possible. Koffing's amazing coverage moves allows it to deal serious damage to very common walls in the tier such as Ferroseed, Spritzee, and Mareanie.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Koffing is best used as a soft answer to many Pokemon and is valuable on a team that needs to check many Pokemon with one slot. Its coverage also works a lot better with Knock Off support from teammates. Teammates such as Vullaby and Pawniard appreciates Koffing because it checks Fighting-type Pokemon, Spritzee, and Grookey, and can burn Onix on the switch; Vullaby and Pawniard also deal with Psychic-type threats for Koffing. On the offensive side, Koffing's amazing coverage moves are able to put pressure on checks to common wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Corphish and Shellder. Furthermore, Koffing appreciates an entry hazard setter as a single layer of Spikes will let Koffing OHKO Pawniard and Ferroseed. That being said, as opposing hazards also deal a ton of damage to Koffing especially with the constant switching that it has to do and its lack of a consistent form of recovery, having hazard removal is also appreciated.</p> "

Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and walls like Piloswine, Ferroseed, and Mareanie, preventing these Pokemon from effectively wearing down Koffing. Koffing can alternatively run Thief or Corrosive Gas to remove Eviolites, with the former allowing Koffing to regain Eviolite, primarily targeting Knock Off users such as Thwackey and Gurdurr, and the latter targeting other crucial items such as Pikachu's Light Ball and Morgrem's Light Clay. Neutralizing Gas provides a huge amount of utility for Koffing and makes it far more reliable as a Toxic Spikes setter, negating Hattrem's Magic Bounce. It also makes it far easier to wear down Regenerator and Magic Guard users like Tangela and Clefairy, respectively. Additionally, because it can nullify Guts, Neutralizing Gas Koffing is one of the very few Pokemon that can switch into Flame Orb variants of Gurdurr and Machoke.</p> <p>Koffing should be paired with teammates that can take full advantage of Toxic Spikes support. Pokemon with Protect or Substitute, like Substitute + Calm Mind Lampent and Wish + Protect Clefairy, become far more dangerous once their foes are poisoned.

Pivots like Electabuzz, Thwackey, and the aforementioned Pikachu benefit from Koffing's ability to pressure Tangela thanks to Neutralizing Gas cancelling out Regenerator and can keep it low by pivoting into Koffing. Koffing's greatest enemies are grounded Poison-types like Roselia and Mareanie, which can absorb its Toxic Spikes. Hattrem can prevent these Pokemon from setting up hazards and force them out, or Scorching Sands Magmar could be used to lure in and knock out Mareanie. Good defensive partners for Koffing are special walls like Ferroseed and Klang, as they can defeat common special attackers like Kadabra and Electabuzz that force Koffing out.</p> "

Neutralizing Gas allows it to hinder Pokemon that rely on their abilities to function well, nullifying Crawdaunt's Adaptability, Jirachi's Serene Grace to reduce its flinch chance, and even Hatterene's Magic Bounce to set up Toxic Spikes. Additionally, its ability nullifies Levitate, making Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Hydreigon vulnerable to its Toxic Spikes. Finally, Neutralizing Gas also allows Galarian Weezing to prevent Regenerator users such as Amoonguss and Toxapex from healing by switching out, allowing Fairy teams to make significant progress against Poison teams. Sludge Bomb allows it to target Pokemon such as Azumarill as well as poison walls such as Mantine and Mandibuzz. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Diggersby and Zeraora. Toxic Spikes cripples foes such as Dragapult and Urshifu-R, allowing its teammates like Azumarill, Mimikyu, and Togekiss to sweep easily. Pain Split allows Galarian Weezing to regain health throughout the match and wear down the foe. Black Sludge is especially useful due to Pain Split not always being reliable. Maximum HP and Defense EVs alongside a Bold nature make Galarian Weezing as physically bulky as possible, allowing it to take on Pokemon such as Zeraora and Diggersby.</p> <p>All of Galarian Weezing's offensive teammates appreciate its ability to set up Toxic Spikes, which allows them to break through Pokemon such as Swampert and Porygon2. Galarian Weezing can also help teammates set up more easily by crippling physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Its secondary Poison typing also allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes for its teammates. Tapu Lele can take on Poison-type Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss with Psychic for Galarian Weezing. Additionally, it can threaten a majority of Defog users with Thunderbolt and Moonblast, like Mantine and Mandibuzz. Tapu Bulu can take on and pressure Ground- and Water-type Pokemon like Garchomp, Swampert, and Urshifu-R. Tapu Koko can deal with Flying-type Pokemon such as Celesteela. Additionally, Tapu Koko can provide Taunt utility to prevent Defog users such as Zapdos from removing Galarian Weezing's Toxic Spikes. Mimikyu can take on Psychic-type Pokemon that threaten Galarian Weezing like Tapu Lele and Alakazam with its Ghost-type STAB moves. Azumarill sets up with Belly Drum to break past bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Chansey. Azumarill can also threaten Ground-type Pokemon such as Excadrill for Galarian Weezing. Choice Scarf Alolan Ninetales can take on Ground- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T with Blizzard. Klefki can form a hazard-stacking core with Galarian Weezing by setting Spikes and can set dual screens to allow Galarian Weezing to tank attacks more easily.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Galarian Weezing plays an important role on Poison teams because of its access to Defog along with its good ability and typing. Having a Defog user is especially important for Poison as a balance type because it prevents teams from being overwhelmed by Spikes. Galarian Weezing also helps against opposing Terrain, allowing teammates like Skuntank to use priority without Psychic Terrain and helping other revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gengar and Choice Scarf Drapion to beat Alolan Raichu by overriding its Electric Terrain. Seeing as Poison teams are typically weak to Ground-type Pokemon such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Choice Band Mamoswine, and Diggersby, Levitate is extremely crucial. Furthermore, Galarian Weezing's Fairy typing allows it to switch into Dark- and Dragon-type attacks from Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Dragapult and beat them in return with Strange Steam. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Mimikyu and Tyranitar. A physically defensive spread is used to more easily check a massive threat in Dragon Dance Kyurem-B. Clear Smog or Flamethrower can be used over Defog if the team has Skuntank to fill the Defog role. The former prevents setup sweepers from setting up on Galarian Weezing for free, and the latter hits Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Seeing as it relies on Pain Split for recovery, Galarian Weezing should be carefully preserved throughout a match in order to switch into Ground-type attacks as well as Defog away hazards. This means it should avoid switching into strong attacks such as Pelipper's Hurricane and Heliolisk's Thunderbolt.</p> <p>The entire Poison team appreciates Galarian Weezing's Ground immunity. Salazzle is one of the best partners for Galarian Weezing, as it can beat Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and Corviknight. Toxapex, Vileplume, and Drapion form a good defensive core with Galarian Weezing. Toxapex can switch into a myriad of attacks such as Bisharp's Iron Head and Aegislash's Flash Cannon, as well as neuter setup sweepers with Haze and scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Galarian Darmanitan. Vileplume can switch into Mold Breaker Excadrill's Earthquake and remove pressure by checking Ground-type Pokemon with its defensive typing, Giga Drain, and Strength Sap. Skuntank provides a crucial Psychic immunity, meaning it can switch into and pick off Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Alolan Raichu, and Indeedee with Sucker Punch. Skuntank can also run Defog, freeing up Galarian Weezing to run Clear Smog or Flamethrower. Other offensive Pokemon such as Toxitricity and Gengar are able to beat faster threats such as Pelipper, Corviknight, and Obstagoon that Galarian Weezing struggles against.</p> "

Chansey is also hard to wear down, since it has Soft-Boiled for HP recovery and Natural Cure to remove status ailments.

Chansey's typing provides few useful resistances, and Chansey by itself must rely on its bulk to keep threats in check. Since it is unable to use Heavy-Duty Boots, Chansey is vulnerable to every entry hazard, meaning it gets overwhelmed by them quickly.

Since Chansey has little to fear from many special attackers, it can force switches and get many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Chansey can use Heal Bell to support its teammates. Thunder Wave can be used instead of Toxic to support slow teammates, but it makes Chansey weaker against bulky Pokemon and has less use overall.

One of these forms of utility is its access to Stealth Rock, which can allow it to assist its teammates by chipping down opposing threats, making it easier to revenge kill them. Seismic Toss allows Chansey to not be completely passive, which lets it wear down opposing special attackers very quickly and break most Substitutes. These two moves paired with the amazing recovery of Soft-Boiled allow Chansey to wear down types that rely on their special attackers, namely Electric, Poison, and Psychic.

Rocky Helmet Tangrowth can give Gyarados problems if it does not have Bounce, as +1 Ice Fang does not 2HKO. Chansey can also withstand several boosted hits and cripple Gyarados with Toxic and Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users: Gyarados is slow, and many Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Zarude will outspeed it at +1 and deal heavy damage with STAB or coverage moves.

However, Gyarados requires multiple boosts to reliably KO bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss with it. Bounce can be used over Ice Fang, as it can more reliably KO a chipped Amoonguss with just one boost and is Gyarados's best means of breaking through Buzzwole. While Bounce can be used without Power Herb, not running Power Herb makes Bounce easy to exploit with Protect, Substitute, or switching. Power Whip offers essential coverage against bulky Water-types like Seismitoad and Rotom-W. It also allows Gyarados to break through the Unaware Pokemon Quagsire and Pyukumuku. Moxie is the preferred ability, as it enables Gyarados to snowball through a team after one or two boosts. Intimidate can be used on a more balance-oriented team to set up more freely against physical foes, but it notably lessens Gyarados's sweeping potential. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Stealth Rock damage, allowing Gyarados to switch in more frequently. Lum Berry can also be used to freely set up twice against foes like Amoonguss and Chansey. An Adamant nature can be used for additional wallbreaking power, as it guarantees OHKOing Azumarill with unboosted Power Whip as well as Thundurus with +1 Ice Fang. Jolly can be used to outspeed Pokemon like Chandelure and Togekiss unboosted.</p> <p>Gyarados is best used on hyper offense and bulky offense teams due to the offensive pressure it offers. Gyarados is primarily used as a late-game cleaner, but it struggles against defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Amoonguss. A teammate that offers entry hazard support like Krookodile and Kommo-o helps wear these foes down enough for Gyarados to break through them. Krookodile also absorbs Electric-type attacks and, with a Chople Berry, can lure in and remove Lycanroc-D, a foe Gyarados is in danger of being revenge killed by. Klefki can provide Spikes support to help wear down foes like Buzzwole and Amoonguss. Diggersby forces a lot of damage onto Celesteela, Buzzwole, and Chansey, allowing Gyarados to clean these typically bulky threats up more easily. Sticky Web setters like Shuckle and Slurpuff can make up for Gyarados's mediocre Speed tier and prevent Choice Scarf users like Krookodile revenge killing it.</p> "

After a Dragon Dance, Gyarados OHKOes almost every Water-type with Power Whip and can beat Toxapex one-on-one. Because Water teams are typically good at setting Stealth Rock against Flying, it is important to give Gyarados Heavy-Duty Boots in order to make sure it is as healthy as possible when attempting to sweep. While often used to handle Water, Gyarados is effective in other matchups too; for example, Ground teams have no defensive answer to the perfect Water + Grass coverage that Gyarados uses. While Gyarados is very powerful against Fire teams, keep in mind that sun halves Waterfall's damage output, it will find much more success if Torkoal is either removed or weakened before attempting to sweep. Intimidate is preferred in order to give Gyarados more opportunities to set up, as the matchups it is most effective in only require a single Attack boost, but Moxie is another option to make sweeping slightly easier if Gyarados can find a KO.</p> <p>Gyarados is fairly self-sufficient in its particular matchups and doesn't rely on its teammates for too much. However, Xatu's dual screens make it much easier to set up. Gyarados fits best on teams that use one or two Pokemon to cover each matchup, so Pokemon like Corviknight that are extremely effective against types, such as Steel, that it struggles with are especially useful. While Gyarados does not require Defog support, Mandibuzz can still act as a support Pokemon with its slow U-turn to bring it in safely on setup fodder. Because Gyarados is almost entirely walled by Grass-types, it is essential to have a very solid answer that can counter them, such as Charizard or Togekiss.</p> "

In return, it greatly appreciates Lapras's ability to check most Kyogre reliably.

Unless it has Substitute, Zacian-C is especially vulnerable to Ditto, as a +2 Ditto can break through Zacian-C's common check in Necrozma-DM with Close Combat. Similarly, Calyrex-S fears Ditto, as it punishes Calyrex-S heavily for coming in by threatening a reverse sweep in conjunction with As One. Ditto is an amazing user of Dynamax; after copying a boosted sweeper like Calyrex-S, Groudon, or Xerneas, it can Dynamax to break the Choice lock, usually allowing it to break through a check that switches into Ditto. However, this is only recommended when Dynamax is necessary to KO a foe, when checks are weakened enough to wrap up the game, or if Ditto needs to survive a predicted priority move. It is possible for Ditto to face an opposing Ditto one-on-one, and the EVs and IVs have been chosen with this in mind. 248 HP EVs ensure that Ditto will be able to use Struggle four times before fainting, and 252 Defense EVs minimize Struggle damage from an opposing Ditto. The minimum possible Speed allows Imposter to not activate first and therefore allow Ditto to have more Transform PP.</p> <p>Ditto works best on balance and stall teams that appreciate its ability to deter opposing setup attempts. Necrozma-DM and Tyranitar work well with Ditto, as they can weaken a boosted Xerneas and Life Orb Yveltal respectively before Ditto comes in and revenge kills. Xerneas and Yveltal have noticeably higher bulk than a Ditto transformed into either, so it is important for the aforementioned two checks to pressure them to Dynamax, removing their ability to reliably win against a Ditto that can Dynamax one-on-one. Moreover, Tyranitar also doubles as a mandatory check to Calyrex-S. Checks to the ever-dangerous Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, such as Lunala, and Calm Mind Kyogre, such as Blissey, Eternatus, and Ferrothorn, are essential, as Ditto is incapable of revenge killing them. Gothitelle is a rather niche option that helps to deal with passive Pokemon lacking Shed Shell, particularly non-Teleport Blissey and Eternatus. Ditto enjoys being at full or near full HP so it can survive potential priority moves and take on a healthy Xerneas, so Defoggers such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Giratina are invaluable teammates for it.</p> "

Choice Scarf gives Ditto the ability to outspeed any Pokemon that isn't running a Choice Scarf itself, or Pokemon like Hawlucha once Unburden has been activated. Ditto is able to duplicate the opposing Pokemon's base stats bar HP; hence, 252 HP is required in order to maximize Ditto's bulk. Against stall teams, Ditto should switch into Knock Off to get its Choice Scarf removed so it can switch moves and have effectively infinite PP as it switches out. This is especially useful against passive Pokemon with recovery like Toxapex, Mandibuzz, and Quagsire, as it can increase its longevity throughout the game.</p> <p>Ditto functions best under bulky teams like stall that require support against offensive setup and opposing stall teams. Blissey appreciates Ditto's ability to break through setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Hydreigon and Venusaur, making it a great partner. In return, Blissey can pivot out slowly with Teleport to provide free switch-in opportunities. Corviknight is a fantastic partner for its ability to remove entry hazards to keep Ditto healthy throughout the game and pivot out with U-turn to bring it in safely. Trick Clefable can help cripple entry hazard removers like Excadrill and Corviknight and other Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Toxapex is useful for dealing with defensive Calm Mind Pokemon like Clefable, which Ditto struggles against due to its Choice Scarf. If you opt to run Toxapex, having a Regenerator core from Pokemon like Reuniclus, Amoonguss, or Tangrowth can prove useful, allowing Ditto to better PP stall defensive Pokemon. Having wallbreakers to support Ditto against stall can benefit it greatly; Pokemon like Safeguard Volcarona, Substitute Kyurem, and Block + Transform Mew can prove useful, with the latter trapping Toxapex, which Ditto struggles to remove.</p> "

It's a fairly straightforward Pokemon to use, as it transforms into any Pokemon you send it out against, bar a few situations, most commonly if the opposing Pokemon has a Substitute up. Due to its ability to check so many top-tier threats, Ditto can fit on all kinds of teams from offense to stall, but most commonly it finds its place on bulkier balance teams. Ditto doesn't need much support due to its nature, but it does appreciate U-turn and Volt Switch users like Corviknight, Urshifu, and Rotom-H to safely pivot it into frightening threats that it can't directly switch into otherwise, such as Keldeo and Excadrill. Ditto's ability to capitalize on setup Pokemon greatly discourages opposing teams from using setup, which gives teams with Ditto a huge advantage. Ditto is key in gaining momentum against fast and frail Pokemon without Choice Scarf, as it can force them out easily. This works for most strong wallbreakers provided you have a way to safely bring Ditto in. Additionally, Ditto can scout for coverage from opposing Pokemon such as Zeraora, Sylveon, and Rotom-H, which can be important in checking these threats.</p> <p>Ditto has a few moveset options, and though it rarely gets to utilize these tools, they can be useful in a pinch.

Whirlwind is an especially useful tool for Ditto that can phaze Substitute users. Recover gives Ditto increased longevity in lengthy battles. Heal Bell is solid utility that can heal your team of status conditions in a pinch, while Super Fang is the best offensive option Ditto has. Perish Song, Encore, or Wish have marginal utility, but each have their own merits for teams to use. 252 Defense EVs and 0 Speed IVs with a Relaxed nature minimize damage taken from an opposing Ditto's Struggle and lower Ditto's Speed so it hopefully moves after opposing Ditto to avoid being the first to KO itself with Struggle damage.</p> "

By causing it to copy all of the opponent's stats except HP, it is able to beat most sweepers such as Zacian-C, Mega Rayquaza, and non-Dynamaxed Xerneas by always hitting them first with boosted moves thanks to its Choice Scarf. A Relaxed nature, 0 Speed IVs, and maximum Defense investment are used in case Ditto is the last remaining Pokemon against another Ditto: it reduces the damage taken from Struggle and makes it as slow as possible, so that it uses Struggle last due to not copying the opposing Ditto first and therefore having more Transform PP. 248 HP EVs ensure it does not faint after four Struggles. The IV spread is optimal to have Hidden Power Fire when copying Xerneas, allowing it to potentially countersweep the opposing team with Dynamax, while maximizing the damage output of Struggle.</p> <p>Ditto is one of the the best revenge killers in AG. It can make great use of Dynamax, which lets it snowball on the opposing team after having copied a boosted sweeper like Xerneas, Necrozma-DM, or Mewtwo. It is ideally sent out on the field after a teammate has fainted: Ditto can then revenge kill the foe or, if the opportunity allows it to, Dynamax to break its Choice lock and blow through the opponent's team thanks to augmented moves and doubled HP. Once its Dynamax is over, it can potentially continue to sweep with its Choice Scarf. It can also immediately copy Zacian-C and get an extra boost from Intrepid Sword that lets it break past traditional counterplay to Zacian-C such as defensive Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon with Close Combat. Ditto is self-sufficient and fits on every playstyle, but it is typically of great value on balance teams that would otherwise be overwhelmed by the myriad of sweepers that can resort to Dynamax to bypass defensive and offensive counterplay alike. Since several Pokemon are self-Imposter-proof at varying levels, counterplay to those is highly recommended. Yveltal cannot be beaten with Ditto during any of the three Dynamax turns because it has a higher HP stat and a Life Orb, and even afterwards, Ditto can't revenge kill it without Dynamax unless Yveltal is seriously worn down, so having Tyranitar, Protect Ho-Oh, or Xerneas as a partner helps Ditto a lot. Xerneas also needs to be seriously weakened or unable to Dynamax before attempting to revenge kill it with Ditto; thus, Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM make for good partners by forcing Xerneas to Dynamax and wasting two turns of it without much trouble. Entry hazard removal is also recommended because Ditto likes to be healthy to repeatedly check threats, so pairing it with Ho-Oh is a good idea. Ditto can struggle against defensive teams with Pokemon like Zygarde-C, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh that it can do little to, so it pairs well with Pokemon like Mega Gengar and Eternatus. They provide a way to remove passive foes, while Ditto is able to check offensive threats such as Zacian-C for them.</p> "

Be sure to not leave Porygon in against Knock Off users such as Pawniard, Vullaby, and Ferroseed, as losing its Eviolite makes it less bulky and unable to tank attacks from Spritzee, Ponyta, and Grookey.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Porygon appreciates entry hazard support from Onix, Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Mareanie because it makes it easier for Porygon to sweep; it especially goes well with Ferroseed for its Spikes support to wear down Pokemon like opposing Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Mienfoo. Pawniard also threatens Abra, which could otherwise hinder Porygon, with Sucker Punch. Pokemon that can get rid of entry hazards such as Staryu and Vullaby are great to avoid Porygon being poisoned from Toxic Spikes and worn down from Stealth Rock and Spikes. Vullaby can also tank priority attacks from Mienfoo and Grookey. Mienfoo, Diglett, and Ponyta are also good to pair with Porygon in order to help with taking down Steel-types like Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Magnemite that resist Porygon's attacks. Pokemon like Mienfoo, Pawniard, and Ferroseed can soften up Pokemon with Knock Off to make it easier for Porygon to sweep. Mareanie and Foongus are great to pair with Porygon due to them being able to switch into Fighting-type attacks from Mienfoo and Timburr.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Tri Attack is a good STAB move to use against any Pokemon that does not resist it, such as Staryu and Spritzee, with the added benefit of a small chance to inflict status. Ice Beam is used to OHKO Diglett and 2HKO Onix, Mudbray, and Vullaby. Psychic can be used for Mareanie and on a predicted switch to Mienfoo or Timburr. Recover allows Porygon to keep itself healthy throughout the game. Thunder Wave is used to hinder switch-ins like Mienfoo, Pawniard, and Vullaby. Teleport can be used over Thunder Wave to keep momentum for the team and be less passive than Mareanie, Spritzee, and Foongus, as Porygon can lure its checks such as Mienfoo, Onix, and Ferroseed and pivot into a Pokemon that can take care of them.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Running 236 HP EVs with 76 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature allows Porygon to take hits from special attackers like Spritzee, Wingull, and Focus Sash Abra. Using 236 HP EVs with 196 Defense EVs allows Porygon to tank physical attacks from Onix and Diglett. Trace allows Porygon to copy Regenerator from Foongus and Mienfoo, the rare Flash Fire from Ponyta, and Volt Absorb from Chinchou to block Volt Switch, as well as to counter trappers like Trapinch and Diglett.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Porygon can be used early-game to use Thunder Wave against Pokemon like Mienfoo or Teleport on predicted switches into checks like Pawniard and Mienfoo to safely get in a teammate to take care of them. Teleport can also be used to allow Porygon to take an attack and bring in frail Pokemon like Abra and Carvanha safely. However, Porygon should be careful about staying in against Knock Off users like Ferroseed, Vullaby, and Mienfoo, as losing Eviolite will make it unable to withstand attacks from Ponyta, Staryu, and Abra. It should switch in on a passive attack from Mareanie or Spritzee, a predicted switch, or an attack from Ponyta or Onix. It should use Tri Attack early-game to get off decent damage against most Pokemon that do not resist it with a small chance of statusing Pokemon like Pawniard and Mienfoo that will try to switch into Porygon's attacks. Ice Beam should be used on predicted switches into Vullaby and Onix, as it will deal major damage to them; additionally, if Porygon is running Psychic, try to use it on predicted switches into Mienfoo and Mareanie, as it will do a lot of damage to them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock setters such as Pawniard and Onix are great to pair with Porygon; Pawniard is able to come in on Knock Off from Ferroseed, while Onix can safely switch into Vullaby to take Knock Off and threaten it to switch out. Bulky Pokemon like Mareanie and Foongus can come in on Fighting-type attacks from Mienfoo and Timburr. Offensive Pokemon like Abra and Wingull are also good to pair with Porygon to check the aforementioned Fighting-types. Defog and Rapid Spin users like Vullaby and Staryu are good to get rid of entry hazards that allow Pokemon like Abra, Wingull, and Grookey to beat Porygon before it can use Recover. Vullaby and Staryu are also helpful by checking Fighting-types that threaten Porygon such as Timburr and Mienfoo, and Staryu is especially helpful against Corphish and Onix. Spritzee is another great Fighting-type check that can pass Wish to Porygon to keep it healthy and also absorb Knock Off from Pokemon like Vullaby, Timburr, and Mienfoo. Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr can force out Steel-types like Pawniard and Ferroseed; in return, Porygon can wall special attackers such as Wingull, Abra, and Mareanie. Setup sweepers and wallbreakers such as Tyrunt, Scraggy, and Grookey appreciate Porygon's Teleport getting them in safely.</p> "

Tri Attack is Porygon's most spammable attack, used against threats like Piloswine, Hattrem, and Clefairy while having a good chance of inflicting them with status. Ice Beam enables Porygon to hit Grass- and Flying-types like Roselia, Vullaby, and Togetic, while Thunderbolt can hit Water-types like Wartortle and Brionne. Psychic allows Porygon to hit Fighting- and Poison-types like Machoke, Hakamo-o, and Mareanie and force them out. Trick can also be used to cripple walls like Galarian Corsola, Klang, and Ferroseed and gain an Eviolite in return. Shadow Ball is another option as the last move to hit Ghost-types like Galarian Corsola and Lampent. Download allows Porygon to boost its Special Attack further, while Analytic can be used to punish switch-ins and increase your chances of scoring 2HKOs against many Pokemon. A Choice Scarf can be used to outspeed threats like Choice Band Piloswine and offensive Roselia, but you do lose out on notable 2HKOs against the likes of Mareanie and Piloswine.</p> <p>While Porygon has a great offensive presence, its biggest downside is its speed. Pairing Porygon with a Sticky Web setter like Charjabug is therefore encouraged to outspeed threats like Fraxure, Hakamo-o, and Adamant Raboot. Entry hazard setters like Roselia, Galarian Corsola, and Piloswine are also good partners, as their entry hazards can wear down switch-ins like Klang and Ferroseed. Porygon also appreciates slow pivots like Slowpoke and Clefairy that can safely switch it in and bait in Pokemon like Vullaby and Koffing. Clefairy can also be used as a Wish passer to prevent Porygon from being worn down. Wallbreakers that use Knock Off like Galarian Linoone, Machoke, and Thwackey are also good partners, as they can remove Eviolites from Clefairy, Mareanie, and Klang, which could otherwise stand up to Porygon. As a Normal-type, Porygon doesn't have any resistances and is vulnerable to Fighting-types like Machoke and Mienfoo, therefore physically defensive walls like Tangela and Galarian Corsola should be used to prevent these threats from KOing Porygon.</p> "

Trace allows Porygon to wall threats like Lampent as well as profit from other abilities like Regenerator and Magic Guard from Slowpoke and Clefairy.</p> <p>Poygon provides support to its team by being able to wall special attackers like Lampent and Seadra, therefore making it a great partner to Pokemon that are weak to these threats like Raboot, Roselia, and Hattrem. Teleport should be used to gain momentum when expecting opposing special attackers like Lampent to switch out. As a defensive Pokemon, Porygon relies a lot on its Eviolite to function, so it needs to be wary of Knock Off users like Vullaby, Tangela, and Mareanie. Furthermore, Porygon can easily get pressured out by Fighting-types and physical wallbreakers like Machoke and Thwackey, so having physically defensive Pokemon to compensate for that weakness like Galarian Corsola and Tangela is encouraged. Porygon is also heavily worn down by status when Trace doesn't catch Magic Guard or Regenerator, so having a cleric like Clefairy or Lickitung can be found helpful. Frailer Pokemon like Morgrem and Kadabra can take advantage of the safe switches that Porygon's Teleport provides.</p> "

Ice- and Rock-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Weavile, Nihilego, and Terrakion also threaten Mega Aerodactyl, so teammates like Corviknight, Celesteela, and Skarmory can handle them; in return, Mega Aerodactyl can deal with problematic Fire-type Pokemon like Victini and Mega Charizard Y. Corviknight can act as a great wincon with its Bulk Up set after Mega Aerodactyl has weakened the team, while Skarmory can also take on physical threats like Mega Scizor, Mega Sharpedo, and Excadrill.

Diggersby acts as a powerful wallbreaker that can utilize its good coverage options to break past Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight, which can use Snorlax as setup fodder, as well as set Spikes to wear down teams for Snorlax to sweep more easily. Choice Scarf Braviary provides a Ground immunity to help check Pokemon such as Obstagoon and Keldeo and can Defog away entry hazards that can wear down Snorlax over the course of a match. Heliolisk acts as a check to Corviknight, as well as an offensive check to Water- and Flying-types, helping Snorlax deal with Pokemon such as Keldeo, Togekiss, and Toxapex more easily. Bewear acts as a check to physically offensive Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Crawdaunt that can easily beat Snorlax while appreciating Snorlax's ability to switch into Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Chandelure thanks to Thick Fat.</p> "

          "description": "<p>This Snorlax set serves as a semi-stall Pokemon that beats many of the offensive threats in the 1v1 metagame, such as Galarian Darmanitan, Primarina, and non-Fling Choice item Haxorus. Counter deals with prominent physical attackers like offensive Rillaboom, non-Swords Dance Rhyperior, and Life Orb + three attacks Zeraora as well as Choice Band users such as Crustle and Azumarill. Amnesia utilizes Snorlax's fantastic Special Defense, which allows it to wall common Choice Specs users such as Magnezone, Sylveon, and Kyurem as well as miscellaneous specially oriented threats such as Salazzle and Volcarona. Snorlax also has access to many different coverage options that are interchangeable based on what its teammates are. Rock Tomb prevents Snorlax from being bait for Encore and Taunt users such as Primarina and Mandibuzz while also providing utility against Fire-types such as Choice item Rotom-H, Chandelure, and Volcarona. Defense Curl allows Snorlax to maximize its PP and fully commit to being a hard stall Pokemon, which helps secure the matchups against stall Kyurem and opposing non-Defense Curl Snorlax. Tackle allows it to maximize its PP while still being able to defeat other stall Pokemon such as Type: Null and Amnesia Slowbro. Double-Edge allows Snorlax to both beat certain Trick users such as Choice item Rotom-A and Choice Scarf Gardevoir while also inflicting recoil damage, which allows it to use Rest to maximize PP preservation. 252 HP and 252 Defense EVs along with an Impish nature allow Snorlax to have the best chance at taking a Choice Band-boosted Fishious Rend from Dracovish, and the extra 4 EVs are dumped into Special Defense. A Chople Berry allows Snorlax to take Fighting-type hits that would normally beat it such as a Superpower from Galarian Darmanitan or a Choice Band-boosted Close Combat from Conkeldurr.</p> <p>Overall, Snorlax is a straightforward Pokemon to use. However, there are a couple interesting matchups where setting up or clicking Counter immediately isn't optimal. Primarina is a good example of where you shouldn't immediately use Amnesia turn one. For Rock Tomb variants in matchups against Primarina and other known Encore or Taunt users, it is best to click Rock Tomb until Snorlax outspeeds the foe to prevent the opponent from locking Snorlax into Amnesia with Encore or disabling its setup moves with Taunt. Snorlax often struggles with setup Pokemon like Swords Dance Haxorus, Iron Defense Kommo-o, and Belly Drum Alolan Marowak as well as non-Choice item Fighting-types or ones that have a way to survive Counter like Reversal Hawlucha and Sturdy Sawk. Because of this, it often pairs well with Fairy-types such as Aqua Jet Primarina and bulky Quick Attack Sylveon. They are also able to take care of a lot of the counters like Urshifu-R and Sawk that normally beat Snorlax. Other good partners for Snorlax would include stallbreakers like Hex Dragapult and Choice item Rotom-A, both of which are able to deal with Pokemon that can outstall Snorlax such as Corviknight and Spite Galarian Corsola.</p> "

Giga Impact OHKOes neutral targets such as non-Stall Rotom-A. Its coverage options in Heavy Slam and Superpower hit Pokemon such as Sylveon, Porygon-Z, Hydreigon, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Counter lets Snorlax beat Choice item physical threats like Rillaboom, Choice Scarf Dracovish and Dracozolt, and Zeraora. Earthquake can be run in order to beat Alolan Marowak and Bulk Up Zeraora.

Lastly, a spread of 88 HP / 168 Atk / 252 SpD with an Adamant nature could be run to survive Choice Specs Porygon-Z and always OHKO even defensive Trick variants with Superpower, but will fail against physical attackers like Choice Band Rillaboom.</p> <p>Although Snorlax is a great physical attacker, it does lose to common physical threats such as Sawk, Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, and Conkeldurr.

Furthermore, Pokemon like Silvally-Ground and Miltank often carry Rock-type coverage, preventing Articuno from switching into them.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal: Retaining Heavy-Duty Boots is key to maintaining Articuno's defensive capabilities, and it should avoid switching into Knock Off and Trick users like Shiftry, Gurdurr, Thwackey, and Rotom. However, if Articuno is the team's entry hazard remover and is able to consistently use Defog against the opposing Stealth Rock setter, it can afford to lose its item.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Ninetales and Rapidash force out Articuno with their super effective STAB move. However, they take great damage from Articuno's Flying-type STAB moves, and they dislike being crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Morpeko, Manectric, and Rotom formes threaten Articuno with their super effective STAB moves and generate momentum with Volt Switch. However, weaker Electric-types like Choice Scarf Rotom and defensive Rotom-S can't break through specially defensive Articuno.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Perrserker, Mawile, and Klinklang are immune to Toxic, resist Articuno's STAB moves, and take on Articuno with their super effective STAB moves.

Unfortunately , Zapdos is incredibly prone to having its item removed by Knock Off from Pokemon it's supposed to check, like Rillaboom and Kartana, making it a much less reliable check after being chipped by Stealth Rock. Because Knock Off hampers its ability to check these Pokemon long-term, it often relies on Static to cripple offensive threats. Zapdos is also rather weak to Toxic, which is why some Pokemon like Excadrill and Melmetal opt to run it.

Its option to run a more defensive Substitute + Toxic set gives it certain versatility too, dealing with conventional checks like Rhyperior, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H way better due to Toxic and PP stalling. However, Moltres's weakness to common offensive typings like Water and Electric hinders it defensively. Its crippling 4x weakness to Rock also leaves it extremely vulnerable to tier staples like Nihilego and Rhyperior, and foes like Krookodile and Zarude can circumvent their vulnerability to Moltres with Rock-type coverage. It also overly relies on its Heavy-Duty Boots and entry hazard removal to not be extremely crippled by Stealth Rock and Knock Off from foes like Mienshao and Krookodile, and its Speed tier, while good, falls short of others like Krookodile and Thundurus-T.</p> ",

      "overview": "<p>Galarian Moltres is both an offensive and defensive threat in UU. Its fantastic bulk and defensive typing allow Galarian Moltres to fill a defensive role by using a RestTalk set that is one of the few Pokemon capable of defeating all variations of Aegislash. Such sets can almost singlehandedly defeat stall teams and perform as a great status absorber to the omnipresent Amoonguss and Chansey. Galarian Moltres can also run a more offensive set on hyper offense with Nasty Plot and Agility. Coupled with STAB attacks that provide near-perfect coverage, Galarian Moltres can be remarkably hard to stop after it sets up. However, having only base 100 Special Attack can prevent Galarian Moltres from breaking through specially bulky Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Nihilego, even when boosted. Galarian Moltres also requires two turns to set up if a Weakness Policy is not used or activated, which leaves it vulnerable to Taunt and status afflictions. Using RestTalk can make Galarian Moltres too passive when first entering a battle, so the set can be challenging to fit onto teams due to how often it invites wallbreakers such as Azumarill and Kommo-o to come in. Lastly, despite an overall good defensive typing, Galarian Moltres is weak to common priority moves such as Lycanroc-D's Accelerock and Mamoswine's Ice Shard.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt is a passable option on either set, but it has a huge opportunity cost over any of the listed moves. Forgoing a STAB or boosting move for Substitute is an option on the Double Dance set to give Galarian Moltres a better matchup against offensive teams, and it can even function decently alongside Salac Berry or Petaya Berry depending on which boosting move is being used, but overall is less reliable. A pivot set with Heavy-Duty Boots and U-turn can check many Pokemon as well as grab momentum for your team, but it leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Lycanroc-D and Rhyperior pose a huge threat to Galarian Moltres; Lycanroc-D can halt a sweep with priority Accelerock, and Rhyperior can tank a hit and wear Moltres down with Rock Blast or Toxic. Nihilego and Diancie also serve as great checks, as the former can take any boosted attack and retaliate with a Rock-type STAB attack, while the latter flat out counters Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Azumarill and Primarina are capable of OHKOing either Galarian Moltres set. Bulkier variants of Primarina can take boosted Hurricane to boot. Diancie can hit Moltres hard with Diamond Storm and shrug off any attack Galarian Moltres tries to hit it with.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: If Galarian Moltres has Taunt used on it, it will be unable to set up with its offensive set or recover and attack with Sleep Talk on its bulky set. Krookodile is a common Taunt user that can outspeed Galarian Moltres and prevent it from using setup or recovery moves. Most Taunt users can usually only proactively halt Galarian Moltres from making progress, however, as either set can do a lot of damage to them when boosted.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Raikou, Thundurus-T, and Thundurus OHKO or heavily dent Galarian Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Powerful priority moves, with the exception of Sucker Punch, are some of the quickest ways to halt a Galarian Moltres's sweep.

Weakness Policy is the optimal item for this set, as the most effective way to take down Galarian Moltres is a super effective attack, meaning it activates a decent amount of the time and gives Galarian Moltres exceptional power when coupled with Nasty Plot.

Physical sweepers that fit well on hyper offense teams and can break through or soften up specially bulky Pokemon able to halt a Galarian Moltres sweep—such as Chansey and Nihilego—are appreciated as partners. Belly Drum Azumarill can fill this role; in return, Galarian Moltres has a great matchup against Grass-types that trouble Azumarill. Gyarados and Swords Dance Aegislash are also decent picks on hyper offense teams that can break through special tanks. Alolan Ninetales can provide Aurora Veil support to give Galarian Moltres an easier time setting up as it becomes exceptionally difficult to take down behind screens.</p> "

The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack for maximum damage output, as Galarian Moltres does not get much benefit from extra Speed due to Custap Berry.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Pokemon that cannot threaten to KO Galarian Moltres back, such as Assault Vest Urshifu-S, Necrozma, and Rillaboom, you should just attack Turn 1. One notable exception to this is against Sitrus Berry Celesteela, where Galarian Moltres must Nasty Plot twice. Against a foe that threatens to OHKO Galarian Moltres, such as Galarian Darmanitan, Endure allows it to take the hit and OHKO back. Sometimes, against Pokemon that have the option of OHKOing Galarian Moltres or not, like Choice Specs Porygon-Z with Trick, Galarian Moltres has two options: use Endure against a move that would otherwise OHKO,  or use an attacking move to save Endure for the next turn, predicting that the foe will play around it. This leads to many of Galarian Moltres's matchups being coinflips, such as Volcarona. Despite the type advantage, Galarian Moltres's matchup against Volcarona is highly variant, relying on predicting when  Volcarona will use Quiver Dance to set up with Nasty Plot, predicting Substitutes with Fiery Wrath, and hitting Hurricane.</p> "

      "overview": "<h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Dragonite is a powerful wallbreaker and setup sweeper thanks to its high Attack stat and access to Dragon Dance. Its Multiscale ability paired with Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to check many Pokemon, since it can withstand nearly any attack from full HP. It has solid coverage options in Earthquake and Fire Punch to hit Pokemon such as Heatran and Celesteela, respectively, and access to a strong priority move in Extreme Speed to pick off weakened foes. However, Extreme Speed can't fully compensate for Dragonite's mediocre Speed even after setting up. At +1, it is left outsped by fast Pokemon such as Zeraora and Dragapult if running an Adamant nature, and many Choice Scarf users even with Jolly. Once it has revealed its moveset, it becomes easier to check, as, if it's lacking Earthquake, it gets walled by Heatran and neutered by Haze Toxapex, whereas without Fire Punch it can't touch Pokemon such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Dragonite may also struggle to find safe opportunities to switch in because it risks getting its Multiscale broken.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Multiscale allows Dragonite to tank most unboosted hits from full health, and Heavy-Duty Boots keeps it from getting chipped by Stealth Rock; this endurance makes Dragonite a fearsome setup sweeper. Extreme Speed allows it to revenge kill faster offensive threats to Flying-type teams, such as Alolan Raichu and Kingdra. Flying-type teams also appreciate its part-Dragon typing, which gives it many notable resistances, including Water and Fire against Pokemon such as Urshifu-R, Volcarona, and Victini. It also gives a neutrality to Electric. However, Dragonite has very limited opportunities to safely switch into the field due to the risk of breaking Multiscale. It is susceptible to status conditions such as burn and poison, which easily break Multiscale. Dragonite also struggles with breaking through walls such as Slowbro, Galarian Weezing, and Galarian Corsola, as they can threaten to burn it.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Dragonite can use a Choice Band set for immediate power and a fourth coverage move; however, without Heavy-Duty Boots, Dragonite can't preserve its Multiscale if Stealth Rock is up and, as a result, loses a lot of utility.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Choice Band is an alternative set that gives immediate power; however, this leaves Dragonite and Multiscale susceptible to Stealth Rock. Roost over Extreme Speed or a coverage move is another plausible set, but the trade results in less damage output and potency overall. An Adamant nature can be opted for on sets that utilize Fire Punch over Earthquake, as outspeeding Tapu Koko after a Dragon Dance boost is no longer necessary.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p><strong>Ice-types: Due to Dragonite's 4x weakness to Ice, Pokemon that carry Ice-type coverage pose huge threats to it, and STAB Ice-type attacks can sometimes even OHKO it through Multiscale.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Dragonite doesn't run any coverage for Fairy-types, so naturally it has a hard time dealing with Pokemon such as Galarian Weezing and Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Status: Dragonite hates getting inflicted with any status because it severely hinders its sweeping capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Dragonite may struggle getting past many physical walls such as Hippowdon, Galarian Corsola, and Mandibuzz because they're bulky enough to take a boosted attack and threaten it in various ways.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p><strong>Status: Dragonite is susceptible to being burned or poisoned, since the former halves its Attack and both break its Multiscale, making it harder to set up. Paralysis also harms it greatly, leaving it unable to outspeed many threats after a boost and more easily revenge killed.</p> <p><strong>Sand and Hail</strong>: Both sand and hail immediately and automatically break Multiscale.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Dragonite has a hard time breaking through physically defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Weezing and Galarian Corsola, even after Dragon Dance boosts.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: As Dragonite heavily relies on Heavy-Duty Boots to ameliorate its weakness to Stealth Rock, Knock Off heavily cripples it.</p> </section>",

          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance gives Dragonite the necessary power to break through opposing teams. It should be used late-game once the opposing team has been weakened. Outrage is its strongest STAB attack, dealing massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it. It should be used carefully, as it locks Dragonite in for a few turns. Extreme Speed allows Dragonite to pick off weakened Pokemon without taking damage and deal with fast threats such as Weavile and Tapu Koko. Earthquake hits Steel-types that resist its other moves such as Heatran, Aegislash, and Melmetal. Alternatively, Fire Punch can be used to hit Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Heavy-Duty Boots relieves Dragonite of worrying about Stealth Rock so it can keep its Multiscale. An Adamant nature can be used for maximum power, whereas Jolly can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as Zeraora and Dragapult at +1 Speed.</p> <p>As a setup sweeper, Dragonite appreciates teammates that help weaken the opposing team as much as possible before going for the win. Garchomp's Stealth Rock aids in this goal, as it makes it easier for Dragonite to get KOs. Hydreigon is able to threaten Steel-type teams with its coverage, giving Dragonite an easier time due to its exploitable moveset. Dragalge switches in well on most Fairy-type attacks that threaten Dragonite thanks to its Poison typing and good Special Defense. It can also set up Toxic Spikes to whittle down the opposing team for Dragonite. Kyurem is a strong breaker and does well in matchups where Dragonite struggles such as Poison, Ground, and Water. Latias provides Healing Wish support, which is extremely valuable for a setup sweeper such as Dragonite. Dragapult can spread status in the form of Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave and punch holes in teams with its attacks to open up for Dragonite to clean.</p> "

Outrage is the best Dragon-type STAB move available to Dragonite, and it can comfortably 2HKO walls such as Slowbro and Hippowdon after a Dragon Dance boost. Extreme Speed gives Dragonite the only priority available on Flying teams, and it can be used to clean up chipped or frail threats such as Alolan Raichu. Earthquake is primarily used to hit Electric-types, such as Tapu Koko and Zeraora, and Pokemon that resist or are immune to Dragon such as Heatran, Jirachi, and Azumarill, as well as hitting targets like Tyranitar and Toxapex super effectively. Fire Punch can be used in lieu of Earthquake to deal with Ferrothorn and Celesteela, since they otherwise completely wall Dragonite. Heavy-Duty Boots makes Dragonite immune to Stealth Rock, allowing it to preserve Multiscale reliably. Thanks to its Jolly nature, it outspeeds several threats such as Tapu Koko, Spectrier, Zeraora, and Dragapult after just one Dragon Dance boost.</p> <p>Celesteela, Corviknight, and Skarmory can sponge super effective Ice-, Dragon-, Rock-, and Fairy-type attacks for Dragonite with ease. Celesteela notably takes on threatening Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Clefable, and Mimikyu. Corviknight and Skarmory take on Ice-types such as Kyurem and Weavile, respectively. Corviknight is also able to safely bring in Dragonite with U-turn, while Skarmory can provide Spikes support. Landorus-T helps greatly in the Electric matchup, is able to set Stealth Rock, and can provide Knock Off support. Tornadus-T can use Knock Off too, and it can also use Taunt and then pivot into Dragonite. Thundurus-T is a complementary setup sweeper to Dragonite, since it can deal with foes such as Tapu Fini, but it can also act as a reliable revenge killer and great offensive pivot when equipped with a Choice Scarf. Zapdos can Pressure stall and reliably pivot to eventually put bulkier foes such as Slowking in a weakened position. Choice Specs Zapdos and Dragonite deal with each other's threats well. Galarian Moltres aids greatly in matchups like Psychic, Ghost, and Steel, while Galarian Zapdos helps immensely in matchups such as Steel, Dark, and Ice.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Mega Mewtwo Y is a powerful non-Dynamax sweeper capable of ripping through bulkier teams with ease owing to its extensive movepool and phenomenal offensive presence. Furthermore, a blistering Speed tier allows Mega Mewtwo Y to naturally outpace offensive staples such as Adamant Zacian-C, Jolly Ultra Necrozma and Arceus forms, and regular Mewtwo. Another advantage of using Mega Mewtwo Y is that it is Imposter-proof by default. Ditto is incapable of OHKOing Mega Mewtwo Y, while it has a good chance to OHKO Ditto. Additonally, because Mega Mewtwo Y is a Mega Evolution, Ditto transformed into it are incapable of Dynamaxing to break the Choice lock, and, as such, are fairly easy to check. Psystrike is Mega Mewtwo Y's STAB option, allowing it to break through common special walls such as Chansey and Ho-Oh. Ice Beam allows Mega Mewtwo Y to OHKO Zygarde-C without boosts and deal heavy damage to Yveltal. Fire Blast lets Mega Mewtwo Y OHKO Necrozma-DM after a boost and break through Ferrothorn without a boost. Fire Blast also lets Mega Mewtwo Y revenge kill Adamant Zacian-C after minimal chip damage and OHKO it after one boost. Focus Blast is an option to OHKO Tyranitar after a boost, but can be a costly choice against Yveltal. Unnerve is the preferred ability to situationally ignore Occa Berry users such as Necrozma-DM and Magearna as well as Chople Berry Tyranitar if running Focus Blast. The given EV spread allows Mega Mewtwo Y to outspeed Adamant Zacian-C and survive Precipice Blades from defensive Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Mega Mewtwo Y fits best on balance teams that can provide it with defensive and offensive support to either break holes early-game or clean up late-game. Mega Mewtwo Y is a nuclear wallbreaker and so oftentimes forces the opponent's Dynamax. Therefore, Dynamax sweepers that can run through the opponent once they have expended Dynamax, such as Xerneas, Yveltal, and Zygarde-C, make good teammates. Mega Mewtwo Y can struggle to find setup opportunities against more offensively oriented teams, limiting it to revenge killing In particular, it is forced out by priority users such as Mega Rayquaza and Arceus forms. Teammates that can check these threats, such as defensive Zygarde-C and Lunala, are particularly important. Additionally, due to its weakness to Ditto once it has taken chip damage, ideal teammates for Mega Mewtwo Y are Pokemon that can easily beat a Ditto that has transformed into it, such as Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, Lunala, and Tyranitar. Tyranitar in particular is a key partner, as it checks Yveltal and can Pursuit trap a Ditto transformed into Mega Mewtwo Y while eliminating Lunala, one of the best counters to Mega Mewtwo Y. Owing to Mega Mewtwo Y’s inability to break through Tyranitar, teammates that can effectively take advantage of Tyranitar, such as Zygarde-C and Necrozma-DM, are also effective. Other good teammates for Mega Mewtwo Y are those that can take advantage of its ability to heavily pressure special walls, like Yveltal, Choice Scarf Kyogre, and Xerneas.</p> "

          "name": "Nasty Plot (Dynamax Sweeper)",
          "description": "<p>Mewtwo distinguishes itself from other specially-oriented Dynamax users such as Yveltal and Xerneas with a great initial Speed tier that allows it to outspeed or Speed tie with almost the entire unboosted metagame barring Zacian-C as well as access to both a setup move and a damage-boosting item, which makes it extremely hard to stop at +2. Psystrike serves as the obligatory STAB move, becoming Max Mindstorm under Dynamax and setting Psychic Terrain with the first use, which boosts the move's power even further while also preventing priority from the likes of Mega Rayquaza, Yveltal, and Marshadow. Psystrike also hits specially defensive Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and the occasional Chansey on their lower Defense, allowing Mewtwo to easily break through them without having to Dynamax. Fire Blast provides the best possible coverage alongside Psystrike, hitting almost the entire metagame for at least neutral damage in conjunction with it, and at +2, Fire Blast OHKOes almost all Pokemon that would take a Psystrike, including Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Zacian-C. +2 Max Flare notably OHKOes specially defensive Necrozma-DM as well as Yveltal and, in the sun, even Ultra Necrozma from full health and Dynamaxed Yveltal after Stealth Rock damage. Hurricane, while almost completely useless outside of Dynamax, lets Mewtwo boost its Speed via Max Airstream in order to outspeed Zacian-C as well as every relevant Choice Scarf user in the metagame barring Ditto, reducing Mewtwo's reliance on team support to overcome such threats at the cost of forcing Mewtwo into an awkward two-turn setup situation to sweep if they are still present. Taunt trades the flexibility bestowed by Max Airstream in order to allow Mewtwo to act as a much more reliable stallbreaker, while also increasing the general reliability of its setup by blocking harmful status moves and stopping Defog, notably letting it shut down Pokemon such as defensive Zygarde-C and Lugia. Shadow Ball is Mewtwo's only option to OHKO Lunala through Shadow Shield at +2, and it reliably OHKOes Ultra Necrozma regardless of forme and 2HKOes Multiscale Lugia, but it also causes Mewtwo to instantly lose to Ditto. Focus Blast can allow Mewtwo to bypass Tyranitar, which otherwise counters Mewtwo. Life Orb in conjunction with 252 Special Attack EVs gives Mewtwo the maximum power possible behind its attacks, giving it a good chance to OHKO Ho-Oh and specially defensive Necrozma-DM at +2. A Timid nature paired with full Speed investment lets Mewtwo outspeed important threats in Mega Rayquaza and Arceus formes and also lets Mewtwo Speed tie with Mega Gengar and Eternatus. Unnerve can be sometimes useful in rare matchups involving Pokemon that may run weakness-reducing berries, such as Chople Berry Tyranitar if running Focus Blast.</p> <p>In contrast to its main competition in Yveltal and Xerneas, Mewtwo has noticeably lacking bulk and does not possess an even remotely useful defensive typing. This significantly hinders its setup opportunities, especially against teams running Zacian-C, to the point where setting up Nasty Plot can involve serious mind games; if Zacian-C switches into Mewtwo as it sets up Nasty Plot, it can simply outspeed Mewtwo and OHKO it with Behemoth Blade, and Mewtwo's only defense against this is that Fire Blast OHKOes Zacian-C on the switch. Forgoing the Special Attack boost to immediately boost with Max Airstream is very often infeasible unless the opposing team is already worn down, and Yveltal can sweep in this manner a lot more effectively than Mewtwo. That being said, Mewtwo is a great pick for Sticky Web teams; the entry hazard allows Mewtwo to naturally outspeed Zacian-C and avoid Speed ties with other base 130 Speed Pokemon such as Eternatus and Mega Gengar without being forced to run Hurricane, giving it significantly more flexibility in its fourth moveslot. Smeargle is thus a reasonable partner, offering support with Sticky Web and potential status on foes. However, Mewtwo can still work on balance-oriented teams, as it appreciates such teams' ability to deal with Mewtwo's various stops. On these teams, Tyranitar is a great partner, checking Yveltal, potentially Pursuit trapping Lunala and Lugia to break Shadow Shield or Multiscale, and offering countermeasures against Ditto and Yveltal. Because Mewtwo appreciates Stealth Rock on the field to hit certain critical KO benchmarks, setters such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and the aforementioned Tyranitar pair well. Primal Groudon, in particular, can help against Tyranitar and Necrozma-DM. Ferrothorn can also offer Spikes support and take advantage of these Pokemon. Zacian-C with Crunch can do away with Lunala and pressure Necrozma-DM for Mewtwo. Ditto is a great partner that can handle Zacian-C and boosted threats that outspeed Mewtwo.</p> "

Indeedee is a strong wallbreaker that can set Psychic Terrain for Mew, protecting it from priority and boosting its Psychic, while Hatterene can keep entry hazards off the field with Magic Bounce, Gardevoir can revenge kill faster threats, and both of these Pokemon are able to take on Dark-type Pokemon for Mew. In return, these offensive Pokemon appreciate Mew's ability to set up and deal with Steel-type Pokemon like Corviknight and Aegislash reliably with Fire Blast.</p> "

Nasty Plot Mew can run various moves in its second slot to fit team needs, like Earth Power, Flamethrower, Scald, and many more. Outside of Earth Power variants, these sets also are dependent on Heavy-Duty Boots for more reliable longevity. Steel-type Mew can run an alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Careful nature to maximize its specially defensive capabilities, which allows it to check Cresselia, Tapu Lele, and Ghost / Fairy Alakazam. While maximum Special Defense investment does help it check those threats more properly, Mew fits the role of a physical wall better. Teleport is an option over U-turn for slower pivoting, though U-turn is generally preferred because it can damage foes and still works if under Taunt. Dazzling Gleam can be used as a secondary STAB option to provide Mew with a Steel / Fairy defensive typing, allowing it to check threats such as Heracross and Rillaboom. This option has some major drawbacks however; it requires Mew to run Roost in another slot and reduces its support options while gaining a weakness to Ground-type attacks. Either Scald or Flip Turn can be used for a Water / Steel typing, which grants Mew alternatives to Will-O-Wisp and U-turn, respectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Clefable: Unaware Clefable ignores Nasty Plot Mew's boosts and can cripple it with Knock Off and Toxic while gaining momentum with moves like Stealth Rock and Teleport. Offensive Thunderbolt Clefable resists Mew's STAB moves and can set up with Calm Mind to force Mew out.</p> <p><strong>Rillaboom</strong>: Rillaboom's Terrain-boosted Grass-type STAB moves heavily threaten bulky Water-type Mew, even Water / Flying set variants, as a Life Orb-boosted Wood Hammer cleanly 2HKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Latios</strong>: Electric-type variants of Latios such as Electric / Water and Electric / Dragon can easily switch into both Water-type and Nasty Plot Mew, resisting all of its STAB moves bar Dazzling Gleam and threatening it out with Draco Meteor, Surf, and Thunderbolt. These variants can also use Mew as setup fodder to accumulate Calm Mind boosts while healing off any chip with Recover.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: With Mew investing in physical bulk, strong special attackers like Latios, Porygon-Z, and Spectrier all threaten it with strong boosted attacks and can also cripple Mew with moves like Trick and Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Victini: Fire / Electric Victini is undoubtedly the best counter to Mew, as it threatens to OHKO with both of its STAB attacks while Mew's Iron Head does minimal damage against it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Offensive Fire-types such as Entei, Arcanine, and Heatran make for solid checks to Mew because they threaten it with their Fire-type attacks while being resistant to Steel. Fire-types can be vulnerable to Mew's entry hazards unless running Heavy-Duty Boots, so it is important to keep them healthy against it. Additionally, these threats are immune to Mew's Will-O-Wisp, so it cannot hinder them throughout the battle.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Latios, Clefable, Naganadel, and Magearna can threaten Mew with their STAB attacks; Clefable in particular is a solid check to Mew due to its immunity to entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Setup sweepers like Latias, Hydreigon, Volcarona, and Tornadus-T are able to take advantage of Mew's passive nature to set up and heavily threaten it and its teammates. Mew is able to pivot with U-turn into checks to these threats, but it runs the risk of being greatly weakened by their attacks in the process.</p> ",

Mew gets its Water typing from Flip Turn, which is a fairly weak move but allows it to be an effective pivot. Scald is another option that makes Mew less passive and can threaten foes with burns. In order to take on threats like Victini, Mew can run Earth Power for a Water / Ground typing to gain Electric-type immunity. This typing lets Mew resist Stealth Rock, which helps it stay healthy and check more offensive threats. Mew can opt for Dazzling Gleam so that it can take on certain Dragon-types like Garchomp and Salamence, as well as Dark / Fighting Lycanroc-D and Urshifu-S, but this opens it up to an Electric-type weakness, meaning it can't check Victini. Roost is a third option, granting Mew a Water / Flying typing to check Ground-types like Excadrill, Haxorus, and Landorus-T while still having a useful typing to resist Fighting. Mew has a plethora of support moves to choose from, and the best options are Spikes and Stealth Rock to chip the opposing team or Defog if the team needs entry hazard removal. Flying-type Mew can opt for Will-O-Wisp for its last move if not running Scald, or Volt Switch if not running Flip Turn. Leftovers are best for the Ground- and Fairy-type sets for passive recovery, while the Flying-type set needs Heavy-Duty Boots in order to come in on Stealth Rock reliably.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Latias, Lycanroc-D, and Spectrier appreciate entry hazard support from Mew, as it allows them to break past threats more easily. Mew can also bring them in safely when pivoting with Flip Turn. Special wallbreakers like Dragapult and Spectrier appreciate Earth Power Mew's ability to pressure their checks like Unaware Clefable and Dark / Poison RegenVest Tornadus-T. Water-type Mew is highly threatened by Rillaboom's Grass-type STAB moves, so teammates like Poison / Fairy Cresselia and Steel / Flying Salamence help by easily switching into its attacks.

Iron Head is Mew's primary STAB attack and allows it to hit Calm Mind users such as Cresselia for consistent damage. Roost provides Mew with its Flying typing and complements this solid defensive typing by providing Mew with recovery. Mew is able to utilize U-turn to pivot on switch-ins such as Victini and Hydreigon and bring in a check. Will-O-Wisp is an alternative that allows Mew to check Swords Dance users such as Lycanroc-D, Scizor, and Excadrill properly. Whirlwind can be used to phaze setup sweepers and pairs nicely with Mew's entry hazard options. For the last slot, Mew has quite a few team support options to choose from, but Spikes is the most coveted and useful option that it can utilize well to complement its solid defensive presence. Defog is another support option that can be used to remove entry hazards and dual screens. Mew can utilize Stealth Rock as an entry hazard option that can hit Levitate and Flying-type Pokemon. Leftovers increases Mew's longevity by providing passive recovery, though Rocky Helmet can be used to weaken physical attackers such as Rillaboom, Landorus-T, and Heracross.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Latias, Lycanroc-D, and Spectrier appreciate entry hazard support from Mew, as it allows them to break past threats more easily.

Mew struggles with offensive Electric-types such as Latias, Clefable, and Naganadel, so it appreciates Ground-type teammates such as Hydreigon, Garchomp, and Slowking. Fire-resistant or Fire-immune partners are a must for Mew; Heatran, Garchomp, and Salamence fill this role the best.

Nasty Plot makes Mew extremely threatening even to specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey and RegenVest Slowking, as Mew can easily set up in front of them while healing away any damage it takes with Soft-Boiled.

Togetic is still bulky enough on the special side to check threats including Choice Scarf Magmar and Drakloak.</p> <p>As bulky as Togetic may be, it is also fairly passive and therefore works better on defensive builds like balance and bulky offense. Since Togetic's strongest asset is Defog, Pokemon who are weak to entry hazards like Nasty Plot Golbat and Galarian Mr. Mime amongst many benefit heavily from it. Togetic can easily be taken advantage of by set up sweepers like Klang, Wartortle, and Lampent, so having other defensive Pokemon like Machoke, Ferroseed, or and Mareanie respectively is heavily encouraged. Teammates like Gurdurr, Hattrem, and Ferroseed pair up well with Togetic due to their ability to threaten Ice- and Poison-types like Piloswine, Galarian Mr. Mime, and Roselia. Ferroseed can also serve as an entry hazard setter, while Hattrem can heal Togetic through Healing Wish.</p> "

Roost can also be used to recover lost health from entry hazards like Stealth Rock or chip damage from opposing threats. A Modest nature enables Togetic to really put a dent through the opponent's team, while maximum Speed investment allows it to outspeed all of the aforementioned walls as well as other threats like bulky Gurdurr and Hattrem.</p> <p>Togetic functions best on offensive archetypes, especially Sticky Webs teams, as Sticky Web enables it to outspeed threats like Thwackey, Krokorok, and Gabite. Therefore, Charjabug makes for an ideal partner for Togetic, as it is the metagame's premier Sticky Web setter it also compensates by allowing Togetic a free switch-ins through Volt Switch. Knock Off users such as Machoke, Galarian Linoone, and Thwackey are also helpful, as they can remove Eviolites and enable Togetic to easily put in dents through the opponent's team. Other common Sticky Web abusers like Lampent, Choice Band Piloswine, and Raboot are also good wallbreaking partners. As a Flying-type, Togetic is heavily pressured by Stealth Rock and therefore likes partners that can prevent or remove them, such as Hattrem and Wartortle. Furthermore, Hattrem can also heal back Togetic's lost health or remove its potential status ailment through Healing Wish.</p> "

Defog is the primary reason to use Togetic; with its decent coverage, Togetic pressures our Defiant users, Falinks and Pawniard, pretty efficiently while still defeating Stealth Rock setters like Palpitoad and Carkol. Togetic’s passive nature is mitigated by the use of Thunder Wave, as offensive Pokemon that try to take advantage of it like Mr. Rime, Glaceon, Silvally-Rock, or Stonjourner do not appreciate being slowed down. Flamethrower, with an alternative spread of 248 HP / 176 Def / 84 Spe, can be used to outspeed non-invested Mawile; paired with Serene Grace, Flamethrower has higher odds of burning the foe. Heal Bell is an option that gives your team a cleric, and an option to more freely use Defog on and defeat Stealth Rock users that run Toxic, like Palpitoad.</p> <p>Togetic is passive in nature, so use it on balance or semi-stall teams, specifically which have a solid defensive backbone that can handle Ice-types like Mr. Rime, Glaceon, and Lapras, Rock-types such as Crustle and Stonjourner, and Electric-types like Raichu and Manectric. Palpitoad and Hippopotas are spectacular paired with Togetic, as they can defeat most Electric- and Rock-types that scare out Togetic. Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard removal are nice partners, especially those that can check Ice-types and appreciate the Fighting resistance and Heal Bell support that Togetic offers like Lapras and Glaceon, which pressure Pokemon that wall Togetic, like Mareanie and Roselia, respectively. Musharna and Beheeyem can weaken or KO Poison-types, giving Togetic a much easier time clicking Defog, while Togetic's Fairy typing is useful for Dark-types like Thievul, making these Pokemon have natural synergy and a strong defensive core against Fighting-types. Because Togetic despises losing its Eviolite, Knock Off absorbers are perfect teammates; these include Silvally formes, Throh, Mawile, Colbur Berry Musharna, and Dubwool. Dubwool in particular is a good partner for Togetic; it counters Pawniard trying to exploit Defog and acts as a Rock check for Togetic. Klang and Type: Null are also notable, as Klang and Type: Null can act as wincons that can check Ice-types that threaten Togetic, while Togetic handles the Fighting-types and Dubwool that Klang and Type: Null do not like dealing with.</p> "

Additionally, with Teleport, Xatu can guarantee safe entry for both potent wallbreakers and setup sweepers, which has made it the staple dual screens setter on hyper offense teams and sets it apart from other dual screens setters like Espeon. Where Xatu comes short, though, is in its passivity. Despite Teleport helping it keep up momentum, its low offensive prowess still causes it to cede turns to potent wallbreakers like Starmie, Tyrantrum, and Guzzlord. Additionally, its poor defensive stats make it less effective at directly switching into coverage attacks from the likes of Sirfetch'd and Machamp and force it to use Roost very frequently to stay healthy. Xatu also struggles heavily to prevent Diancie from setting Stealth Rock, making it much less useful in certain matchups if it lacks Defog.</p> ",

Xatu can attempt boosting sets with Calm Mind and Stored Power, but because of relatively low initial damage output, they take a few turns to ramp up. On utility sets, Defog is an option if Xatu is your sole entry hazard remover; however, Magic Bounce + Heavy-Duty Boots Xatu is typically serviceable enough as a sole hazard remover.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Guzzlord, Drapion, and Zoroark all fear very little from Xatu and threaten heavy damage in return. The most Xatu can do is bring in a teammate to deal with them through Teleport or fire off a Night Shade.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Pokemon like Decidueye, Golurk, and Silvally-Ghost can all easily OHKO Xatu with their STAB attacks; however, Golurk and Decidueye must be mindful of using Poltergeist against Xatu, since it may not be holding an item.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Diancie is the hardest Stealth Rock setter to deal with for Xatu, since Diamond Storm and Moonblast do heavy damage to it. Other Rock-types like Tyrantrum and Aerodactyl are problematic too, since they easily take Xatu out.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Xatu's bulk, even when invested in, isn't very great, so strong attackers like Machamp, Tauros, and Toxicroak can still get past it.</p> ",

Similarly, teammates like itemless Ninjask, Focus Sash Salazzle, and Substitute Braviary that appreciate extra security against entry hazards are prime teammates for Xatu.

          "description": "<p>By virtue of its stellar Water / Fairy typing and good mixed bulk, Azumarill carves a niche as an offensive tank capable of dealing with top-tier threats like Choice item Porygon-Z, non-Roseli Berry Urshifu-R, and Haxorus. STAB Play Rough and Liquidation enable it to defeat Dragon- and Fire-types such as Haxorus, Kommo-o, and Volcarona. Aqua Jet gives Azumarill a way to pick off weakened foes like Choice item Rotom-H, Sawk, and Gardevoir. Superpower is an extremely important move in order to deal with Choice item Porygon-Z. The given EV spread ensures Azumarill will survive a Hyper Beam from Modest Choice Specs Porygon-Z and tank a Poison Jab from Jolly Choice Band Haxorus and Adamant Choice Band Urshifu-S. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack to maximize damage output. Alternatively, 132 HP / 124 Atk / 252 Def EVs with an Adamant nature let Azumarill survive a Choice Band Rock Wrecker from Crustle, but you lose the special bulk necessary to handle Choice Specs Porygon-Z. Since this alternative spread only defeats Choice Scarf Porygon-Z sets, Superpower becomes less of a necessity, meaning it can be replaced with Knock Off or Bulldoze instead, allowing Azumarill to defeat Substitute + Disable Dragapult or Magnezone.</p> <p>While Porygon-Z looks manageable at first glance with the help of Assault Vest, it sometimes runs a defensive Chople Berry set, utilizing Superpower's Attack drop to freely Recover and use Nasty Plot to reach +4 and OHKO Azumarill. Against Choice Band Sawk, it is best to use Aqua Jet turn one and then Play Rough, as it is likely that it is running Counter and will KO you if you use Play Rough, but there is the possibility of it using Poison Jab. Situations with the same guidelines include facing Alolan Marowak and Choice Band Crustle, if using the alternative spread. Despite being bolstered by Assault Vest, there are still special threats that Azumarill should try to avoid, like Choice Specs Primarina, Magnezone, and Porygon2. Azumarill enjoys having Kyurem as a partner, luring in threats such as Haxorus, Volcarona, and Urshifu-S, while Kyurem can deal with stall users like Slowbro, Mandibuzz, and Skarmory. Choice Specs Rotom-H also has great synergy with Azumarill, combating the likes of Chansey, Celebi, and Aegislash. In return, Azumarill can handle Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Kommo-o. Pokemon that can deal with physical wallbreakers pair well with Azumarill. Salazzle and Hawlucha are valued because of this, handling wallbreakers like Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Rillaboom, and Durant. In return, Azumarill can deal with Trick users like Choice item Rotom-H and Gardevoir. Due to Azumarill's mediocre Speed, it is often overwhelmed by faster Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Choice Band Diggersby. Therefore, faster Pokemon like Porygon-Z and Rillaboom pair well with it. In return, Azumarill can deal with bulky Dragon-types like Goodra, Unnerve Haxorus, and Assault Vest Kyurem.</p> "

However, Normalium Z is the more reliable way to ensure it successfully uses Belly Drum. Azumarill can also chose to run Brick Break in lieu of Play Rough, as it better deals with Steel-type Pokemon, namely Melmetal, which otherwise withstands any of Azumarill's attacks even after Belly Drum. Substitute may be used over Play Rough in order to let Azumarill set up on Pokemon that rely on status moves to deal with it, like Torkoal and Mega Sableye, but Play Rough is generally preferred due to it hitting useful targets. Return along with a Jolly nature can be used to better deal with Galarian Weezing and Mega Venusaur, significantly improving the Poison-type matchup.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p><strong>Water-resistant Pokemon: Pokemon that resist Azumarill's Aqua Jet such as Latios and Serperior can withstand Aqua Jet even after Belly Drum and KO Azumarill with their STAB moves or super effective coverage options. Even many walls that resist Water, like Mega Venusaur, Celebi, and Rotom-W, can outspeed Azumarill and KO it with super effective STAB moves before Azumarill can use Knock Off or Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Haze Users and Phazers: Mantine can outspeed Azumarill and remove its boosts with Haze, while Azumarill fails to reliably set up Belly Drum against Toxapex, as it removes the move's boosts with Haze and proceeds to easily deal with unboosted Azumarill. In the same vein, Azumarill fails to reliably set up against phazers like Hippowdon and Skarmory.</p> <p><strong>Status: All status conditions significantly hinder Azumarill's ability to act as a reliable offensive threat. Burn makes it significantly weaker, paralysis prevents it from outspeeding threats like Porygon2 it otherwise would, and poison puts it on a timer, wearing it down quickly in conjunction with Belly Drum's health drop.</p> <p><strong>Psychic Terrain: Due to Azumarill's below average Speed stat, it heavily relies on Aqua Jet.

Aqua Jet allows it to deal with faster threats like Volcarona and Mamoswine, making up for its subpar Speed stat. Knock Off hits Psychic- and Ghost-types like Jirachi and Aegislash for super effective damage, and it's able to OHKO Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela and bulky walls like Toxapex with minor or no chip damage after Belly Drum. Play Rough is a stronger STAB option that deals with Dragon- and Dark-types such as Kommo-o and Mandibuzz. Maximum Speed EVs make Azumarill as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Dragalge and Melmetal. Normalium Z is Azumarill's preferred item, as it nullifies chip damage taken prior to using Belly Drum while also preventing Azumarill from being crippled by Knock Off, as opposed to Sitrus Berry. The added perk of Normalium Z is that Azumarill can use Belly Drum without it to use Z-Belly Drum later, either recovering its HP back to full if it didn't switch out.</p> <p>Klefki pairs up exceptionally well with Azumarill. Klefki acts as a much needed Poison immunity and provides dual screens support and Spikes support, the former allowing Azumarill to set up more easily and the latter chipping down foes for it. Tapu Koko helps greatly in the Flying- and Water-type matchups, while Mega Diancie is able to bounce off entry hazards as well as status moves directed at Azumarill. Mega Diancie can also provide Stealth Rock support, which helps it further improve the Fire- and Flying-type matchups, and aid in matchups like Poison, Steel, and Electric thanks to a wide range of coverage options in Psychic, Mystical Fire, and Earth Power. Tapu Bulu is a great asset in the Water-, Electric- and Ground-type matchups. Tapu Lele is not only a great wallbreaker when equipped with a Choice Specs, but also a great help against Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur and Galarian Weezing that threaten Azumarill. Mimikyu helps greatly in the Ghost- and Psychic-type matchups, dealing with Pokemon like Aegislash and Tapu Lele. Lastly, Togekiss synergizes well with Azumarill, as it deals with Grass-types troublesome to Azumarill, like Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, while Azumarill in return deals with Rock-type threats to Togekiss.</p> "

However, outside of setting rain, Politoed is a generally underwhelming Pokemon that can’t provide much help to rain teams itself and often becomes a momentum sink due to its passiveness. Encore allows it to deal with bulkier threats that would wall it otherwise and discourage Pokemon from setting up on it. Toxic can break down walls in tandem with Encore, particularly bulky Water-types that pose a threat to rain teams like Seismitoad. Hypnosis trades some effectiveness against passive builds for the potential to shut down common roadblocks to rain teams like Gastrodon and Milotic, and maintain utility against more offensive teams looking to take advantage of Politoed’s passivity. Ice Beam chips Grass-types like Celebi, 3HKOes Dragalge, and OHKOes Noivern with the Special Attack investment. Perish Song forces bulky setup sweepers out, allowing Politoed to check Pokemon like Suicune, Snorlax, and Reuniclus. Finally, Rest allows Politoed to continue setting rain when severely weakened and in long matches against passive teams. Non-Ice Beam variants can invest the 76 Special Attack EVs into Defense, as they do nothing significant with Scald. 56 Speed EVs let Politoed outrun Alolan Marowak, but 92 Speed EVs can be ran for Milotic, which Encore + Toxic variants can beat.</p> <p>Politoed’s only niche is setting rain, so Pokemon that take advantage of it are necessary. Swift Swim Pokemon like Kingdra, Omastar, and Kabutops can offensively pressure the opponent and sweep once they are weakened. Seismitoad can also provide an Electric immunity and Stealth Rock. Electric-types of your own like Raikou and Heliolisk are able to run Thunder and Weather Ball as coverage and check Electric- or Water-types. Tornadus also enjoys fully accurate Hurricane and Weather Ball coverage. Toxicroak appreciates the Dry Skin recovery and can switch into Milotic with impunity. Steel-types like Metagross and Steelix can provide good defensive utility for rain teams. Finally, entry hazard setters such as Klefki and Roserade can help pressure bulkier cores that threaten rain such as Suicune + Assault Vest Reuniclus, as well as synergizing with the surprising amount of switches Politoed can force from defensive Pokemon.</p> "

Regenerator allows Slowking to keep itself healthy, which helps it switch into threats more easily and gives it more opportunities to use Future Sight. With its great bulk and defensive typing, Slowking is able to check threatening specially offensive Pokemon such as Heatran, Nidoking, Tapu Lele, and Latios and use them as Future Sight fodders. However, Slowking is very vulnerable to physical wallbreakers like Landorus-T and Garchomp, as its physical bulk is mediocre and doesn't allow it to tank strong hits from them. Slowking's typing and mediocre physical bulk also leave it very vulnerable to Knock Off and U-turn. This is an issue, as these moves are very frequently run and often safe to use, further limiting Slowking's utility as a defensive pivot. In addition, Toxic is worrisome, as it forces Slowking to use Slack Off more often and limits its potential to consistently switch into dangerous Pokemon such as the aforementioned Heatran, Nidoking, and Tapu Lele.</p> ",

Slack Off lets Slowking stay healthy to reliably check special wallbreakers without having to rely on Teleport or switches. Teleport is not only a solid pivoting option, but it works well in tandem with Future Sight, as Slowking can bring in a more offensive teammate safely to capitalize on the Future Sight.

A lot of offensive Pokemon appreciate the additional pressure of Future Sight as well as Slowking's ability to bring them in safely with Teleport. Garchomp likes having its defensive answers like Tangrowth and Landorus-T pressured by Future Sight, providing it with easier wallbreaking opportunities. Slowking is weak to strong physical attackers such as Rillaboom and Kartana, so switch-ins like Tangrowth and Mandibuzz make great partners; in return, Slowking checks problematic Pokemon such as Heatran for them. Dark- and Ghost-types such as Dragapult and Hydreigon can threaten Slowking, making Mandibuzz and Clefable effective partners. In return, Slowking can check Heatran, Tapu Lele, and Nidoking for them. Additionally, Clefable can capitalize on Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Mandibuzz that Slowking pivots against. Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Zeraora are threatening, making defensive Landorus-T and Grass-types like Ferrothorn and the aforementioned Tangrowth good partners that can help keep them at bay. When pivoted into battle via Teleport, both Landorus-T and Ferrothorn can force progress with their own Knock Off or set their respective entry hazards. Furthermore, Slowking checks Tapu Lele, Heatran, and Nidoking for them in return.</p> "

Qwilfish also takes heavy damage from common Ground-type coverage from wallbreakers like Rapidash and Sawk; the latter is noteworthy due to Inner Focus ignoring Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Wallbreakers: Even with Intimidate, Qwilfish's bulk isn't amazing and, without any reliable recovery moves, it is quickly put in range of powerful wallbreakers like Kangaskhan, Choice Band Cinccino, and Swords Dance Silvally formes.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Qwilfish is a premier physical wall that is able to set Spikes or Toxic Spikes and counter powerful physical attackers such as Basculin and Sawk. Its typing also lets it absorb Toxic Spikes from opposing Qwilfish and Cofagrigus. Thanks to Taunt, Qwilfish can prevent slower Pokémon such as Cofagrigus, Pyukumuku, and Ferroseed from setting up, recovering HP, and setting entry hazards. Thunder Wave cripples faster attackers such as Skuntank, specially offensive Basculin, and Articuno, which can otherwise freely switch into Qwilfish. Liquidation is the preferred STAB move for its ability to OHKO Rapidash and Ninetales after minimal residual damage. Scald is another option that, while significantly weaker, can cripple switch-ins with a burn. Pain Split improves Qwilfish's longevity versus bulkier teams. Rocky Helmet lets Qwilfish wear down physical attackers, punishing resisted moves like Gurdurr's Mach Punch, Alolan Sandslash's Triple Axel, and Basculin's Flip Turn. Alternatively, Black Sludge makes Qwilfish less reliant on Pain Split. The given EV spread lets Qwilfish outspeed Adamant Alolan Sandslash and maximize its physical bulk.</p> <p>Qwilfish fits well on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its defensive utility and ability to set entry hazards. Special walls like Articuno, Audino, and Ferroseed make for great partners, as they are able to handle special attackers like Frosmoth, Rotom, and Frosmoth; in return, Qwilfish handles physical attackers such as Sawk and Rapidash. Ground-immune and -resistant Pokemon such as Rotom-S, Uxie, and Tangela cover Qwilfish's Ground weakness. VoltTurn cores pair well with Spikes, as they force a lot of switches. Therefore, Pokemon such as Rotom, Silvally-Ground, and Cinccino make for great partners. Spikes are appreciated by wallbreakers like Rapidash and Sawk; Kangaskhan is a noteworthy example, as it can force switches thanks to Fake Out. Knock Off users such as Shiftry, Thwackey, and Gurdurr can remove opposing Heavy-Duty Boots, bolstering the effectiveness of Qwilfish's entry hazards.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Thanks to its decent bulk, its access to Swords Dance, and the many resistances given by its Steel typing, Scizor can act as a threatening setup sweeper for Bug-type teams. Swords Dance allows Scizor to boost its Attack to high levels and become a dangerous setup sweeper in many matchups such as Fairy and Poison. Bullet Punch is a great priority STAB move boosted by Technician that lets Scizor pressure faster threats like Terrakion and allows it to clean late-game; in addition, Bullet Punch helps greatly in the Fairy matchup, as Scizor can take care of Pokemon like Togekiss, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Galarian Weezing, especially after a Swords Dance boost. Dual Wingbeat is a strong move boosted by Technician that greatly helps against defensive Poison-types like Toxapex and Amoonguss. Knock Off is a utility move used to punish switch-ins like Galarian Corsola and Toxapex or common defensive Normal-types like Chansey and Porygon2. Alternatively, Superpower can be used to hit Steel- and Normal-types like Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Duraludon, and Porygon2 hard, which can otherwise be hard for Bug teams to handle. Scizor should seek opportunities to set up against passive Pokemon that do not threaten it such as Bronzong, and it should be used mid- or late-game once its checks and counters like Skarmory are taken out or weakened enough. Maximum Attack investment in combination with an Adamant nature and Life Orb allows Scizor to maximize its damage output. 252 EVs in Speed allow it to outspeed faster threats like Indeedee-M and Urshifu-S when Sticky Web is up.</p> <p>All of Scizor's teammates appreciate its ability to threaten weakened Pokemon with Bullet Punch. Galvantula and Araquanid are able to set Sticky Web, allowing Scizor to threaten faster Pokemon like Urshifu-S, Indeedee-M, and Drapion that are less vulnerable to Bullet Punch. Galvantula can also be used to improve the matchup against Flying- and Water-type teams and threaten most Defoggers such as Mandibuzz and Mantine. On the other hand, Araquanid can switch into Fire-type moves directed at Scizor thanks to its Water typing in combination with its ability Water Bubble; it can also use Magic Coat to bounce back very annoying Spikes against Steel, Grass, and Fairy teams. Volcarona forms a great offensive core with Scizor, as the former can cover a variety of matchups, including Electric, for Scizor and can also take care of Steel-types that check Scizor like Skarmory and Corviknight. In return, Scizor can deal with Rock- and Normal-types such as Tyranitar, Chansey, and Snorlax that Volcarona struggles against. Choice Scarf Heracross is a good partner to handle faster Fire-types like opposing Volcarona and Cinderace, and it helps Scizor against Steel and Rock teams with Close Combat. Heracross also appreciates Scizor's ability to weaken opposing teams so that it can act as a deadly sweeper late-game. Finally, Scolipede is also a good teammate, as it helps in the Fairy-type matchup and can use its coverage moves like Earthquake and Rock Slide to hit Steel- and Fire-types like Cobalion and Salazzle.</p> "

Scizor can run U-turn for a pivoting option. This option can either provide Scizor with a Steel / Bug typing, or it can maintain its Steel / Flying typing with Roost in the second moveslot at the cost of not benefiting from Technician. Defog is an option on more defensively oriented sets over Swords Dance as a Defogger with priority, though these sets are outclassed by other defensive Steel / Flying types like Mew and Salamence. Superpower can be used as a coverage option to hit Steel-type switch-ins like Magnezone and Garchomp. Another niche option is Knock Off to hit Ghost-types such as Heracross, Reuniclus, and Latias and remove opposing items. A Choice Band can provide more immediate power to Scizor's Bullet Punch and allows it to pressure its usual checks with U-turn and Knock Off at the cost of Swords Dance and Roost.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Victini, Mew, and Latias resist both of Scizor's STAB moves and are able to OHKO it. Victini and Latias in particular are especially strong checks, as they take minimal damage from Bullet Punch. Electric / Fairy Clefable is still able to OHKO Scizor, though it is more prone to its Bullet Punch. Magnezone is another particularly threatening Electric-type check, as it can trap and OHKO Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Fire-types: Offensive Fire-types like Heatran, Hydreigon, Volcarona, and Tornadus-T are solid offensive checks, as they outspeed Scizor and resist its Bullet Punch. However, they usually cannot switch into Scizor without the risk of taking massive damage from its Dual Wingbeat.</p> <p><strong>Mew: Mew is a great defensive check to Scizor with both its bulky Water- and Steel-type sets. Water-type Mew is able to check Scizor more effectively than other bulky Water-types, as it is faster than Scizor and can more properly threaten it with Scald or Will-O-Wisp.

Scizor is able to complement Ground-types by being a solid offensive check to Rillaboom, though it cannot switch in safely to Superpower variants. While Scizor is able to break past bulky Water-types, they are often able to threaten it out with Scald or coverage options; specially attacking Dragon-type partners like Latias, Latios, and Dragapult are able to switch into these threats without being hindered by Scald burns.</p> "

Sticky Web is useful for slowing down grounded offensive foes such as Calyrex-S, Choice Scarf Kyogre, and Zacian-C for teammates. Stealth Rock also aids teammates by chipping down foes and can target certain Pokemon unaffected by Sticky Web such as Life Orb Yveltal. Encore is useful for preventing setup sweepers such as Xerneas, Nasty Plot Calyrex-S, Zekrom, and Groudon from using Shuckle as complete setup fodder, forcing them to switch out or Dynamax, while also enabling teammates to switch in freely. Final Gambit generates momentum for Shuckle's teammates by KOing itself once entry hazards have potentially been set up. Alternatively, Infestation traps and slowly damages foes like Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and defensive Xerneas during the match, forcing chip damage on them as well as working with Encore to give Shuckle's teammates free switch-ins. Toxic can also be used to put a timer on Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Sturdy allows Shuckle to survive attacks from powerful attackers like Kyogre, enabling it to use Mental Herb for Taunt users such as Yveltal and Grimmsnarl, guaranteeing it gets to set an entry hazard. Alternatively, Red Card forces out an abundance of threats like Zacian-C and Kyogre as well as boosted Zygarde-C and Zekrom.</p> <p>Shuckle should only be used on hyper offense teams that can make full use of Sticky Web.

Ghost-types such as Calyrex-S and Marshadow can effectively spinblock against opposing Excadrill, preventing Shuckle's Sticky Web and Stealth Rock from being removed. Due to the importance of Sticky Web and Stealth Rock, Shuckle should generally be led with in order to immediately slow down offensive grounded threats with Sticky Web and weaken foes with Stealth Rock.</p> "

A Fighting-type Heracross with Close Combat as its main STAB move is an option, with a Fighting / Dark typing being used the most. Dark / Fighting Heracross has less breaking capability than Heracross's main sets, as it doesn't have the powerful STAB Facade at its disposal. Normal / Fighting Heracross is an option as well for Fighting-type Heracross, though this set is starkly worse against Ghost-types. Spikes is a strong option on any Heracross set over Swords Dance to offer team support and chip potential switch-ins, though losing Swords Dance limits its breaking capability.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Salamence</strong>: Defensive Steel / Flying Salamence is a reliable check to Heracross's sets since it resists Facade, can tank any of Heracross' coverage moves comfortably, and generally runs Rocky Helmet to further chip Heracross. Additionally, Salamence is able to remove hazards that either Heracross or its teammates set with Defog, which can make it even more difficult for Heracross to make progress.</p> <p><strong>Buzzwole</strong>: Similarly to Salamence, a bulky Steel / Flying Buzzwole is able to wall Heracross, and Buzzwole is able to more reliably check Swords Dance sets compared to Salamence by virtue of Bulk Up.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Ghost-type Pokemon such as Ghost / Fairy Cresselia and Ghost / Fighting Slowbro are some of the best checks to some of Heracross's sets, though both of these Pokemon lose to Normal / Ghost Heracross.</p> <p><strong>Tornadus-T: Tornadus-T is a huge offensive threat to Heracross and any of its sets are able to stop Heracross from sweeping, though it cannot reliably switch into any of Heracross's moves. Even if Heracross has Sticky Web support, Flying-type Tornadus-T sets are solid offensive checks to Heracross.</p> <p><strong>Latios</strong>: Latios is another great offensive check to Heracross by virtue of its Speed tier and immunity to Sticky Web via Levitate. Every variant of Latios is able to cleanly OHKO Heracross, and Ghost-type variants of Latios are also able to switch into Heracross's Facade, though this is risky given Latios is OHKOed by the rest of Heracross's coverage.</p> <p><strong>Dragapult</strong>: Dragapult an offensive check to Heracross that fits onto many teams. It has multiple options to OHKO Heracross and gains momentum on switch-ins by pivoting out.

Knock Off is the main coverage choice for Ghost-type Heracross, as it hits opposing Normal / Ghost Pokemon and offers great support by removing items.

Additionally, Sticky Web support from Araquanid is a highly effective strategy to weaken Heracross's offensive checks considerably. For the few defensive Pokemon that give Heracross a hard time, strong special attackers such as Electric / Fairy Clefable and Fighting / Flying Tornadus-T are able to break past them. They also provide support with Stealth Rock and pivoting, respectively, both of which increase Heracross' breaking capabilities.

Wallbreakers such as Charizard and Archeops are ideal for this role.

Strength Sap doubles as both a recovery move and an Attack-lowering move, used to beat Pokemon like Dracovish, Choice item Excadrill, and Galarian Darmanitan. It should be used constantly against non-Trick Choice item Pokemon in order to heal off damage and fish for Cursed Body activations or stall until they can no longer deal significant damage. Night Shade is useful against Trick users, notably Rotom-H without much HP investment, which can be 3HKOed. It also is used to end a battle quickly, in order to avoid potential critical hits or secondary effects that stall often falls prey to. Will-O-Wisp can be used to shut down setup Pokemon like Crustle. Spite can be run in order to PP stall opposing PP stall Pokemon, like Meowstic and opposing non-Spite Galarian Corsola. The Defense investment and a Bold nature let Galarian Corsola take a Choice Band-boosted Fishious Rend from Adamant Dracovish, allowing Galarian Corsola to heal back up with Strength Sap. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense, which helps with rolls against Pokemon like Weakness Policy Aegislash. Galarian Corsola has many other benchmarks for its bulk: maximum HP and Defense maximizes Galarian Corsola's chance to beat Adamant Choice Band Dracozolt and rare four attacks Alolan Marowak. 252 HP and 148 Defense with a Bold nature can be run for Jolly Choice Band Dracozolt, while improving the Aegislash matchup further. 252 HP and 124 Special Defense is exactly what is needed to beat Aegislash, while 252 HP and 104 Special Defense with a Calm nature guarantees Galarian Corsola beats Dragapult. Generally, Galarian Corsola should set up with the respective defensive stat, heal off damage with Strength Sap or Rest, and then use Night Shade or Will-O-Wisp until the foe falls.</p> <p>Galarian Corsola struggles against Taunt users with significant damage output, like Life Orb Zeraora, and Taunt users with recovery, like Corviknight and Mandibuzz. Therefore, Taunt users like Whimsicott and Chople Berry Terrakion that can beat them serve as great partners. In return, Galarian Corsola can handle hyper offensive threats such as Galarian Darmanitan, Sawk, and Choice Item Excadrill. Dark-types, particularly Bisharp, non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Incineroar, and Mandibuzz are also particularly threatening against Galarian Corsola, as they can hit it super effectively and often carry Knock Off, Taunt, or setup options. To aid against then, Pokemon like Choice Band Crustle, Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, and Primarina can all be used to beat the metagame's relevant Dark-types. Galarian Corsola can beat back threats like Arcanine and opposing Primarina in return. Lastly, certain Trick users like Gardevoir, Malamar, and heavily HP-invested Rotom-W can present a problem for Galarian Corsola, so Pokemon that do not mind being Tricked and can avoid the move altogether, like Excadrill and Whimsicott, can be good partners. In return, Galarian Corsola can handle Pokemon like Steelix, Galarian Darmanitan, and Choice item Haxorus for them.</p> "

SubToxic Aegislash can be used instead to provide a way to deal with special attackers like Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Choice Specs Latios. Choice Specs Gengar is a great wallbreaker that breaks apart opposing walls such as Toxapex, Heatran, and Mega Venusaur while absorbing Toxic Spikes for Galarian Corsola. Choice Scarf Blacephalon is a useful revenge killer that forces out threatening Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor while outspeeding major threats to Galarian Corsola such as Zarude and Tapu Koko.</p> "

Roost helps Skarmory to stay healthy throughout the match against foes such as Urshifu-R, Excadrill, and Tyranitar. Whirlwind is used to prevent setup from Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragapult while also generating passive chip damage if Spikes were set beforehand.

Furthermore, Skarmory can make up for Ferrothorn's weakness to Fighting, while Ferrothorn takes care of Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Rotom-W for Skarmory and provides a resistance to Water. Heatran provides the much-needed Fire immunity against Pokemon like Blacephalon and Hydreigon, while Skarmory can take on Ground-type attacks such as Earthquake from Garchomp and Excadrill. Furthermore, Heatran's common moves in Toxic and Magma Storm can deal immense chip damage when combined with Skarmory's Spikes. Excadrill takes care of Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Zeraora if it is holding a Choice Scarf and can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin to preserve Skarmory's Sturdy.

This is especially important against Choice-locked foes such as Urshifu-R, which will have to avoid being heavily punished by Skarmory's Rocky Helmet. Furthermore, Aegislash helps greatly against Psychic-types such as Hatterene and Tapu Lele, which Skarmory generally struggle against. Bisharp's ability in Defiant also deters Defog from Pokemon such as Mantine and Zapdos, and its typing allows it to shine against Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Galarian Slowking, Slowking, Galarian Corsola, and Spectrier.</p> "

Heliolisk blocks Water-type moves from the aforementioned Pokemon and threatens them with Thunder, making it an especially good Kingdra partner. In a similar vein, Tornadus benefits from Kingdra's Flip Turn to come in safely and break down bulky Water-type Pokemon.</p> "

The amount of Pokemon in NU that can contend with Kingdra's Water + Dragon coverage is low, and the amount that can meaningfully threaten Kingdra in return is even lower. Kingdra suffers, though, from taking multiple turns to fully set up, which gives the opponent a bit of time to prevent it from taking the game over. Additionally, many of the Pokemon it'd like to set up against, namely Vaporeon, Talonflame, and Arcanine, commonly run Toxic, which severely compromises its ability to clean late-game. Lastly, despite being one of the few offensive checks to Blastoise, Kingdra offers very little defensively compared to other Water- and Dragon-types like Vaporeon, Dragalge, and Guzzlord, meaning it requires a good amount of defensive teambuilding support.</p> ",

Even offensive variants can easily survive an attack from Kingdra and OHKO in return.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Despite being setup fodder for Kingdra, Vaporeon and Mantine can cripple it with Toxic and stall out turns and Draco Meteors by spamming their recovery moves.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure: Kingdra isn't very strong nor fast before it boosts, and its bulk isn't very great; therefore, Pokemon like Rotom-C, Decidueye, and Silvally-Ghost can give it issues because Kingdra can't OHKO them without a critical hit, is slower than them without an Agility boost, and takes significant damage from their attacks, making it hard to safely set up when faced with such foes. Additionally, priority users like Sirfetch'd, Choice Band Flygon, and Toxicroak can revenge kill Kingdra regardless of if it uses Agility.</p> <p><strong>Critical Hit-immune Foes: Shell Armor Escavalier counters Kingdra because of its bulk and can remove Kingdra's Scope Lens with Knock Off.

Alongside Agility, this severely limits overall counterplay to Kingdra once it sets up. Alternatively, Kingdra can use Substitute to avoid Toxics from Vaporeon, guaranteeing that Kingdra wins one-on-one. A Modest nature is used to guarantee an OHKO on Drapion after Stealth Rock and because Timid isn't necessary thanks to Agility.</p> <p>Because Kingdra has very few answers after boosting, much of the support it requires is related to easing setup. Dual screens from Xatu is one way to do this, making it harder for powerful attackers like Toxicroak and Heliolisk to take Kingdra out. Similarly, pivots like Talonflame and Arcanine that draw in Water-types help provide Kingdra with good setup opportunities. Sylveon is one of the few foes that Kingdra can't OHKO even with a critical hit; teammates like Sirfetch'd and Passimian that can force damage onto it and push it into OHKO range are helpful as a result. Entry hazard support also works to force chip damage onto Pokemon that can stomach a hit, with Pokemon like Diancie, Copperajah, and Garbodor being good hazard setters.</p> "

It utilizes Swift Swim to double its Speed under rain to outspeed threats like Galvantula, Choice Scarf Gengar, Choice Scarf Virizion, and Kyurem. Choice Specs strengthens Kingdra's subpar Special Attack to allow it to act as an amazing sweeper and wallbreaker. Under rain, Surf is Kingdra's go-to move, as it is capable of OHKOing certain Pokemon like Zeraora and Urshifu-S. Dragon Pulse is used in situations where Kingdra has to deal safe and reliable damage to Pokemon like Kyurem, Toxapex, and Mantine that may resist or be immune to its Water-type moves. Draco Meteor acts as a nuke towards Pokemon like Keldeo and Amoonguss that would normally eat up whatever Kingdra has to throw at it. Hydro Pump can be used in order to break through Pokemon like Porygon2 and even has a chance to OHKO stallbreaker Mew and Aegislash under rain. Hurricane is also an option over Hydro Pump, as Hurricane is reliable under rain and can potentially OHKO opposing Grass-types such as Virizion, Whimsicott, and Celebi, to name a few. Maximum Special Attack investment along with a Modest nature and maximum Speed investment allow Kingdra to hit as hard as possible while being able take advantage of Swift Swim to outspeed threats to the team.</p> <p>Rain is required in order to maximize Kingdra's wallbreaking and sweeping abilities, hence why Pelipper is a perfect teammate for it. Pelipper may opt to run a defensive set with Heavy-Duty Boots if Kingdra runs Hurricane, as Pelipper can safely switch out via U-turn in order to provide rain to Kingdra. Pelipper can also run a Choice Specs set to help Kingdra break through Grass-types if Kingdra does not have Hurricane in its moveset. Eject Button Toxapex can also serve as a pivot that is able to support Kingdra by weakening bulkier Pokemon like Porygon2 and Chansey through Toxic Spikes or Toxic support. Pokemon like Tentacruel, Pelipper, and Rotom-W are Pokemon that can be used for entry hazard control and help Kingdra stay healthy throughout the game. Slowking can also be included in the team, as it can pivot Kingdra or other teammates in safely while acting as a special wall at the same time. Seismitoad can also be paired up with Kingdra, as it can set up Stealth Rock to weaken checks to Kingdra like Porygon2 and Chansey while providing an Electric immunity to the team. Late-game sweepers like Choice Band Azumarill, Choice Scarf Dracovish, Keldeo, and Shell Smash Cloyster also appreciate Kingdra's wallbreaking abilities, while they deal with Pokemon like Chansey, Ferrothorn, Jellicent, and Toxapex, which are otherwise hard for Kingdra to deal with.</p> "

Teleport allows Porygon2 to reliably get in powerful wallbreakers while sparing them from taking direct damage. Ice Beam is generally the preferred attacking move because it OHKOes Noivern and Flygon, while also 2HKOing Roserade and Golurk. Tri Attack is a decent alternative that does more to the likes of Xurkitree, Raikou, and Toxtricity. Toxic cripples the likes of Milotic, Volcanion, and Raikou, mitigating their long-term impact against Porygon2's teammates. Foul Play is an attacking option to hit Metagross and Alolan Marowak, while also letting Porygon2 check Polteageist much easier. A specially defensive spread allows Eviolite Porygon2 to blanket check many dangerous special attackers, such as Xurkitree, Toxtricity, and Roserade. Some Defense investment can be used to make Porygon2 a better pivot into the likes of Dhelmise and Flygon should its team need it. Trace allows Porygon2 to copy great abilities, like Regenerator from Reuniclus and Punk Rock from Toxtricity.</p> <p>Porygon2 pairs very well with most offensive Pokemon, as it's able to absorb damage and switch them in safely with Teleport. Toxtricity, Darmanitan, Mienshao, and Heracross are powerful wallbreakers that enjoy having Porygon2 to fall back on when they're forced out by certain special attackers, such as Noivern. A pivoting core can also be powerful, especially with the likes of Mienshao, Incineroar, and Raikou, as it can keep Porygon2 in favorable situations. Incineroar deserves special mention because Intimidate helps it to stomach physical attacks for Porygon2, though it doesn't appreciate Knock Off removing its Heavy-Duty Boots. Togekiss and Galarian Weezing are great checks to Fighting-types while Porygon2 can easily handle most Toxtricity variants and other Electric types. Togekiss can even provide Defog and Heal Bell support, while Galarian Weezing can handle most Knock Off users. Powerful physical attackers such as Heracross, Darmanitan, Alolan Marowak, and Swords Dance Cobalion can take advantage of Porygon2's inability to generally threaten them. The aforementioned Togekiss and Galarian Weezing fare well against Heracross, while Suicune and Milotic can take on Darmanitan and Alolan Marowak. Healthy Noivern can switch directly into Cobalion and any Noivern can outspeed Heracross and Alolan-Marowak should Porygon2 predict their switch in with Teleport.</p> "

Recover provides Porygon2 with a reliable form of healing for it to continually switch into attacks from Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Excadrill and Mimikyu. Foul Play acts both as a countermeasure for Pokemon like Scizor and Azumarill that would otherwise use Porygon2 as setup bait and as an attacking move to hit other powerful physical threats like Alolan Marowak and Excadrill. Ice Beam gives Porygon2 good coverage to deal with Dragon threats like Hydreigon and Noivern more easily as well as certain other offensive threats like Diggersby and Hawlucha. Toxic allows Porygon2 to wear down defensive Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Gastrodon that may otherwise attempt to switch in. Teleport is another option to be considered, as it allows Porygon2 to bring in frail offensive Normal-type threats like Diggersby, Heliolisk, and Indeedee-M safely and create momentum. Discharge can be an option to run over Toxic as good coverage for hitting Flying- and Water-type threats like Corviknight and Pelipper with a sizable chance to paralyze notable threats for Normal teams such as Calm Mind Keldeo and Bulk Up Urshifu-R, which would otherwise use Porygon2 as setup fodder. Trace is generally the preferred ability due to the potential of copying abilities like Natural Cure from Chansey, Regenerator from Toxapex and Amoonguss, and Intimidate from Krookodile, all of which increase Porygon2's survivability. Maximum investment in HP and Defense with a Bold nature is used to have Porygon2 perform its best as a physical wall against threats like Excadrill and Scizor.</p> <p>Most if not all Pokemon on Normal appreciate Porygon2's ability to deal with physical threats. Blissey in particular forms an excellent defensive core with Porygon2 due to being especially weak to offensive physical threats. Porygon2 in return appreciates Blissey's role as a special wall to help deal with strong special threats that itself cannot hold off like Kingdra in rain and Volcarona. If Porygon2 is running Teleport, frail offensive threats like Diggersby and Indeedee-M appreciate its ability to bring them in safely without leaving them open to attacks and status moves. Braviary helps Porygon2 deal with hard-hitting threats that have Fighting-type coverage like Heracross and Rillaboom. Porygon2 is especially susceptible to all forms of entry hazards, particularly Toxic Spikes, due to their ability to quickly wear down Porygon2 and reduce its ability of switching into attacks reliably. As a result, Porygon2 along with the entire Normal team appreciates Braviary's ability of keeping hazards off through the use of Defog. Ditto makes for a good partner due to its ability to punish offensive setup sweepers that may use Porygon2 as setup fodder like Belly Drum Azumarill, Swords Dance Excadrill, and Bulk Up Urshifu-S. Ditto and Porygon2 also work well together due to their ability to PP stall Poison and Water teams by copying Regenerator from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. Heliolisk provides Porygon2 with an easier time against Water due to its great ability in Dry Skin for absorbing powerful Water-type attacks from wallbreakers like Dracovish. Bewear appreciates Porygon2's ability to mitigate its low Speed by paralyzing faster Pokemon like Hydreigon and Kyurem with Discharge. Porygon2 in return gains a partner to help deal with Steel- types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn that it would otherwise have a hard time dealing with.</p> "

Max HP and Defense investments in tandem with a Bold nature and Eviolite bolster Porygon2's physical bulk, permitting it to shrug assaults from the likes of Mega Sharpedo and Choice Band Excadrill. Eviolite in particular also lets Porygon2 take special attacks from Pokemon like Nidoking and Hydreigon with relative ease, despite the lack of EVs in Special Defense.</p> <p>Together, Blissey and Porygon2 form a stellar defensive core for Normal teams that can stop most attackers in their tracks. Blissey can comfortably stomach attacks from special wallbreakers like Landorus and Mega Charizard Y that easily bypass Porygon2 and absorb status aliments for it by virtue of Natural Cure. In return, Porygon2 takes on powerful physical attackers like Dragonite and Mega Sharpedo for Blissey, and the pair can form an extremely effective pivoting backbone should Porygon2 be running Teleport. Ditto is an excellent teammate as well, as it can easily revenge kill sweepers that may use Porygon2 as setup fodder such as Swords Dance Excadrill and Z-Belly Drum Azumarill. It also switches into walls that beat Porygon2 one-on-one like Mega Sableye and Blissey by copying themselves and, thus, their status move immunities. Wallbreakers like Mega Lopunny and Diggersby greatly appreciate Porygon2's bulk to shrug off priority moves and its Teleport for them to come into the field safely. In return, they can beat threats to Porygon2 like Heatran, Mega Sableye, and Tyranitar. Mega Lopunny can also absorb Knock Offs for Porygon2. Defog users like defensive Staraptor and Mega Pidgeot remove entry hazards, allowing Porygon2 to better perform its walling and support duties by coming into the field unscathed. The former also takes hits from dangerous Fighting-types like Infernape and Heracross for Porygon2 and brings it safely into the field with U-turn, while the latter revenge kills Fighting-types and threatens Steel-types like Bisharp and Ferrothorn. Lastly, Porygon-Z's wide array of possible coverage moves allows it to threaten Psychic-types and certain Steel-types Porygon2 struggles dealing with.</p> "

An alternate EV spread of 52 Def / 252 SpA / 204 Spe with a Modest nature can also be used, which improves Blissey's odds versus bulky Pokemon like Yawn Sylveon and Togekiss while hitting the same defensive benchmarks. However, the reduced Speed makes it prone to losing to Speed-invested Modest Goodra, as well as a few uncommon sets such as fast Calm Mind + Encore Primarina or fast Body Press Magnezone.</p> <p>A few special attackers are capable of defeating Blissey and therefore deserve particular note. Porygon-Z can set up with Nasty Plot and use Eerie Impulse to minimize Blissey's damage. Choice Scarf Gardevoir utilizes Trick and Disable, only losing to an inconsistent Shadow Ball Special Defense drop or critical hit. Togekiss has positive chances to win thanks to its combination of Thunder Wave and Air Slash, while Choice Specs variants can simply spam Air Slash, which is also favorable to the opponent due to flinches. Additionally, Assault Vest Goodra can easily tank Blissey's moves and whittle it down using Acid Spray. While in most matchups Blissey can safely set up with Calm Mind turn one, against faster Pokemon with Encore or Trick, like Togekiss and Chandelure, Blissey should attack to prevent the possibility of getting locked into a non-damaging move. Taunt Whimsicott requires multiple successful 50/50s on Whimsicott's end, in order to simultaneously prevent Calm Mind boosting Hyper Voice and being hit from Flamethrower too often. Blissey also finds itself susceptible to many prominent physical attackers like Galarian Darmanitan, Urshifu-R, and Haxorus. As such, Blissey appreciates the support from Pokemon that are able to deal with these threats such as Crustle, defensive Arcanine, and Primarina. Despite Blissey's stallbreaking capabilities, it struggles to break past certain stall threats such as non-Defense Curl Snorlax and Chansey, which team options such as Curse Dragapult and Urshifu-R are able to manage.</p> "

Magic Guard users like Clefable, Reuniclus, and Alakazam are only afraid of Thunder Wave and use Toxic variants of Blissey as setup fodder. Heatran can employ sets utilizing Magma Storm, Taunt, and Toxic to trap and remove Blissey from the match completely. Gengar can set up Substitutes on Blissey that it is unable to break, therefore giving Gengar free setup. Calm Mind variants of Tapu Fini can set up for free on Blissey thanks to Taunt.

Mega Mawile, Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Aegislash take especially good advantage of this, while Corviknight and Skarmory are capable of directly pivoting into Toxic variants as well.

          "description": "<p>Blissey's enormous special bulk allows it to effectively take on most of the tier's many special attackers, with threats such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Charizard Y all failing to break Blissey. Teleport allows it to safely pivot in teammates like Ash-Greninja, Mega Medicham, and Mega Mawile and take advantage of the many switches that it forces; Blissey's ability to viably hold Heavy-Duty Boots also makes it hard to wear down via entry hazards, unlike its pre-evolution Chansey. Toxic allows Blissey to chip away at threats such as Mega Latias, Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Zapdos. Targeting Mega Latias is especially important, as Blissey is one of the few Pokemon that can reliably come in on it and cripple it in the long term with Toxic. It must be noted, however, that Toxic forces Blissey to use Teleport more often, as it invites Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Corviknight, Aegislash, and Kartana to easily pivot in. Thunder Wave is another good choice for the last move, as it allows Blissey to effectively cripple offensive Pokemon like Mega Mawile and Kartana. It also gives Blissey a weapon against a couple of the select few special attackers that otherwise handily beat Blissey, such as Alakazam, Reuniclus, a reckless Gengar on the switch, and Calm Mind Clefable. Stealth Rock can be run over a status move if your team can't fit a Stealth Rock setter elsewhere, but Blissey is even more passive than normal without Toxic or Thunder Wave and can easily be taken advantage of by threats such as Mega Latias, Corviknight, and Aegislash.</p> <p>Blissey finds its home on balanced and bulky offensive teams. There it should be used to pivot into threats such as Heatran and Ash-Greninja and regain momentum with Teleport while also spreading status. Blissey really hates powerful physical attackers like Garchomp, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham. A physically bulky partner is therefore appreciated. Slowbro and its Mega Evolution are very solid switch-ins to Fighting-type attacks, are capable of checking many of the tier's physical attackers, and can also form a very strong double Teleport core with Blissey. Corviknight effectively rounds out the Slowbro + Blissey core, taking on the likes of Kartana, Mega Scizor, Rillaboom, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar, as well as offering Defog support and additional pivoting support with U-turn. Zapdos is another option that meets the previously mentioned positives bar checking Weavile and Mega Tyranitar, and it can also provide pivoting support with Volt Switch if desired. Toxapex can also handle Mega Lopunny and can beat other powerful physical attackers that Blissey dislikes like Mega Scizor and Mega Mawile. Blissey's Teleport makes it a very solid pivot, which is appreciated by Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Greninja, and Weavile. The latter two are also capable of revenge killing Gengar, a special attacker that completely shuts down Blissey, with Weavile in particular heavily limiting additional threats such as Mega Medicham with Pursuit. Physical walls, such as Landorus-T and Toxapex, appreciate Blissey taking on special attackers they can't handle, such as Ash-Greninja, Heatran, and Tapu Koko. Thunder Wave variants of Blissey can also be paired with slower wallbreakers that appreciate the paralysis support, such as Mega Mawile, Garchomp, Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Heracross. Toxic variants of Blissey dislike Steel-types, with Landorus-T, Victini, and Garchomp helping out in that category.</p> "

Teleport turns Blissey into an incredibly good defensive pivot as well, taking advantage of its ability to switch into special attackers it walls, like Greninja and Nidoking, to maintain momentum for the team by bringing attackers in safely. Soft-Boiled increases Blissey's longevity, allowing it to support its team throughout the match. Seismic Toss deals consistent damage, enabling Blissey to weaken most of the threats it walls while making it not fully stopped by Taunt. Lastly, Stealth Rock weakens opposing teams gradually, which helps offensive Pokemon like Diggersby and Mega Lopunny net crucial KOs. However, Toxic can be used to further diminish Blissey's passiveness by heavily crippling defensive and offensive threats alike, such as Zapdos and Hydreigon. Maximum HP and Defense investments with a Bold nature are needed to patch Blissey's physical frailty, ensuring it can comfortably shrug weaker physical hits from the likes of Choice Scarf Excadrill and Mega Diancie. Natural Cure lets Blissey absorb status aliments for the team. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents entry hazard damage, which gives Blissey better Teleport pivoting that sets it apart from the bulkier Chansey.</p> <p>All of Blissey's teammates appreciate its supportive and slow pivoting capabilities. Porygon2 stands out as Blissey's best partner because it can easily soak physical hits Blissey is unable to, including from threats like Mega Sharpedo and Mega Scizor, while also being able to pivot out with Teleport. In return, Blissey absorbs status for Porygon2 and takes on special threats that bypass it such as Landorus and Volcarona, making the pair a formidable defensive backbone for Normal teams. Defensive Staraptor is also a good teammate given it switches in on physical Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Infernape for Blissey. It also has access to U-turn to keep momentum in tandem with Blissey's Teleport. Ditto patches Blissey's general vulnerability to setup sweepers like Dragonite and Cloyster by KOing them after it gets brought into the field via Teleport. It also helps Blissey massively against walls that beat it one-on-one like Celesteela and Toxic Toxapex. Mega Lopunny can threaten Ghost-types like Mega Sableye with its access to Scrappy, and Mega Pidgeot beats most Fighting-types that threaten Blissey such as Mega Gallade. Both Mega Pokemon can also form a pivoting core with Blissey due to their fast U-turns and moves to threaten Steel-types like Ferrothorn. Wallbreakers like Diggersby and Heliolisk all appreciate Blissey bringing them safely into the field with Teleport and weakening their targets with its Stealth Rock or Toxic support. In the same vein, Porygon-Z can more easily pull off a sweep with Blissey's aforementioned perks.</p> "

Its typing and movepool also make it a good offensive check to most Flying- and Water-types as well as some Electric-types, including Togekiss, Suicune, Milotic, and Xurkitree. Raikou has to compete with other Electric-type Pokemon such as Xurkitree and Toxtricity as both a pivot and a wallbreaker, however. It has no moves to hit Seismitoad and Gastrodon, and it has a hard time breaking through some Electric-resistant Pokemon such as Roserade and Dragalge.

As a result, a strong Grass-type or Electric-type like Dhelmise, Roserade, Toxtricity, or Xurkitree is extremely important as a teammate. These four examples are also able to threaten or wear down bulky Rock-types like Diancie and Gigalith, which are huge threats to Entei too, especially if Entei lacks Stomping Tantrum. In return, Entei can threaten their counters such as Registeel for Roserade's case or Crobat for Dhelmise. A Fighting-type such as Cobalion or Mienshao can help Entei with bulky Rock-types as well as Curse Snorlax. These two can also bring Entei safely on the field via U-Turn or Volt Switch. In general, Entei appreciates VoltTurn support a lot. Entei is easily revenge killed by other Pokemon once it's locked into a move, so a defensive backbone provided by bulky Pokémon like Seismitoad, Stakataka, and Assault Vest Reuniclus is helpful. An entry hazard remover like Noivern, Crobat, and Starmie is crucial due to Entei's weakness to Stealth Rock. Speaking of hazards, Entei appreciates Spikes or Toxic Spikes setters such as Roserade, Golisopod, Galarian Weezing and Dragalge alongside the usual Stealth Rock, because they support Entei in wearing down its counters as well as general wallbreaking. Lastly, although Entei is a decent late-game cleaner due to its strong Extreme Speed, a more reliable one like Choice Scarf Heracross, Calm Mind Raikou, or Shift Gear Toxtricity is a solid partner too.</p> "

Double-Edge can be used for immediate power, although the recoil is a downside that reduces Entei's already poor longevity. Stomping Tantrum is an option, either as a coverage move or a STAB attack to provide a Normal / Ground typing, that allows Entei to hit checks with Flash Fire such as Heatran, although this option is significantly weaker than Sacred Fire. Facade is a stronger option than Double-Edge if Entei is statused, but it otherwise lacks immediate power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Mew, Galarian Slowking, and Toxapex are the most widespread check to Entei, as they resist Entei's strongest STAB attack, comfortably tank Extreme Speed, and threaten to KO back.</p> <p><strong>Salamence: Despite Entei's Intimidate immunity, Salamence is still a solid check to it with Dragon / Ghost and Water / Ground typings; however, Entei's Howl sets can be problematic for Dragon / Ghost Salamence.</p> <p><strong>Hippowdon</strong>: Rock-type Hippowdon is one of the most reliable switch-ins to Entei in the metagame, although it doesn't appreciate being inflicted with status through Sacred Fire and especially Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Flash Fire Steel-types</strong>: Flash Fire users such as Heatran and Coalossal are solid check to Entei thanks to their resistance to Normal and immunity to Fire-type attacks.

Sacred Fire is Entei's secondary STAB attack and allows it to hit Steel-types such as Mew, Reuniclus, and Magearna.

Crunch helps against Fire-resistant Ghost-types such as Slowbro, Galarian Slowking, and Salamence. Stone Edge is useful coverage that hits Fire-types like Latias, Arcanine, and Volcarona, although its low accuracy can be a hindrance. Alternatively, Toxic can be used as the last slot on Choice Band sets, as it allows Entei to inflict poison on foes such as Slowbro, Mew, and Salamence. Choice Band is prefered for immediate power, although Entei can also run Heavy-Duty Boots in conjunction with Howl to act as a setup sweeper. Inner Focus grants Entei an immunity to Intimidate, allowing it to deal normal damage to Landorus-T and Salamence.</p> <p>Latios, Tornadus-T, and Hydreigon appreciate Entei's ability to pressure specially defensive walls like Unaware Clefable and Blissey; in return, they are able to pressure physical walls such as Mew and Toxapex.

Rillaboom, Volcarona, and Zarude can utilize their Grass typing to break past bulky Water-types that threaten Entei, particularly Mew, Galarian Slowking, and Salamence. Entei is vulnerable to Stealth Rock, so it is important to have some form of entry hazard control; offensive Defoggers such as Tornadus-T and Landorus-T are some of the best options to fill this role.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Subtitute + Calm Mind Suicune relies on Pressure to wage a war of attrition on a number of Pokemon that can wall it such as Seismitoad, Gastrodon, and Mantine. Calm Mind makes it very hard for special attackers to break Suicune's Substitute and makes Scald much harder to switch into. Substitute provides Suicune with a way to protect itself from status effects, which will cripple sets lacking Rest, and is especially effective for PP stalling Pokemon unable to break its substitute in one hit. Note that Suicune must still be cautious not to switch into status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave from the likes of Registeel, Togekiss, and Klefki. Protect enables Suicune to scout Choice item users, stall out low PP moves, and gain additional Leftovers recovery. Ice Beam can be used to hit the likes of Zarude and Seismitoad after boosting, which are otherwise major threats. Roar is another option that allows Suicune to phaze out other setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage. The EV spread allows Suicune to outpace base 80 Speed Pokemon like Chandelure and Togekiss, while giving it an 81% chance that Seismitoad's Earthquake will not break its Substitute. An alternative spread with maximum Speed will allow Suicune to Speed tie with Heracross, but lowers its chances of its Substitute surviving Seismitoad's Earthquake to about 56%. This set lacks recovery other than Leftovers, so Suicune must be careful not to take Knock Off from Pokemon like Incineroar and Obstagoon without a Substitute up. Suicune must also be careful not to get hit by Trick from the likes of Darmanitan and Gardevoir, as it completely cripples this set.</p> <p>Suicune's natural bulk and typing make it a great choice for teams looking to check threats like Darmanitan, Alolan Marowak, and Metagross. Suicune's best check is Zarude, which can use Jungle Healing to remove any Scald burns and threaten Suicune with Power Whip. Therefore, it pairs well with Zarude checks like Cobalion, Galarian Weezing, and Togekiss. Cobalion has the added bonus of being an excellent Knock Off absorber thanks to Justified, while Galarian Weezing and Togekiss check other threats to Suicune like certain Guts Fighting-types such as Machamp and Heracross. The aforementioned Guts users, along with Obstagoon, pose a notable threat to Suicune because they are powerful enough to threaten Suicune and unafraid of burns from Scald. Sylveon or Togekiss notably can provide Heal Bell support to remedy this set's weakness to status effects. Suicune is also threatened by Electric-types like Xurkitree, Toxtricity, and Raikou, so it should be used alongside Electric-type checks such as Roserade, Assault Vest Reuniclus, Zarude, and Vileplume. Finally, Suicune lacking Roar is unable to beat certain Calm Mind sweepers with Psyshock like Reuniclus and Sigilyph, so it is wise to pair it with checks to them like Obstagoon and Chandelure.</p> "

Roar can be used over Sleep Talk in order to more reliably defeat other Calm Mind sweepers like Reuniclus and rack up entry hazard damage. This set runs enough Speed EVs to outpace Adamant Golurk and Jolly Alolan Marowak, then invests the rest in Defense and HP to be as hard to break through as possible. This, along with reliable recovery in Rest, makes it a much better answer to the likes of Darmanitan, Sharpedo, Cobalion, and Stakataka.</p> <p>Rest renders this set much less vulnerable to status effects and Knock Off, but it still has one major nemesis in the meta: Zarude. Zarude can use Jungle Healing to easily remove Scald burns, and this set lacks the safety net of Substitute to allow moves like Ice Beam to be effective. Checks to Zarude include Pokemon like Cobalion, Incineroar, Crobat, Noivern, and Togekiss. This set has difficulty setting up Calm Mind against offensive Electric-types like Xurkitree, Raikou, Heliolisk, and Toxtricity, so checks like Roserade, Zarude, Celebi, and Porgyon2 work well with it. Heliolisk has the added danger of Dry Skin causing Water-type moves to heal it, so Suicune must be played particularly carefully against it. If running Roar, Suicune can phaze foes into Spikes provided by Roserade, making it a particularly notable partner.</p> "

However, Suicune is held back by the prevalence of Water-resistant Pokemon in the tier such as Keldeo, Mantine, and especially Zarude; Keldeo can simply ignore Suicune's Special Defense boosts with Secret Sword, Suicune struggles to make headway against Gastrodon and Mantine, and Zarude especially can use Jungle Healing to cure itself of burns and Power Whip to deal significant damage. In addition, Suicune lacks reliable recovery, forcing it to rely on Leftovers and Rest in order to regain HP. This makes Suicune susceptible to Knock Off, as losing Leftovers would require Suicune to use Rest more often. In addition, its overreliance on Sleep Talk isn't great either, as you rely on RNG to choose the ideal move.

In addition, it is unable to sponge hits from foes like Rhyperior and Mamoswine, effectively taking up the teamslot of a Water-type without offering very much defensive utility. Toxic can be used to subdue Water-immune Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Mantine, and Seismitoad. However, Suicune often doesn't have room to run Toxic due to it suffering from four-moveslot syndrome. If you were to run Toxic, it would likely replace Sleep Talk on CroCune. A set with Calm Mind / Roar / Scald / Rest allows Suicune to be used as a dedicated phazer and stop foes like Calm Mind + Psyshock Galarian Slowbro from setting up; however, this would waste Suicune's sweeping capabilities and requires entry hazard support to be effective.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Pokemon such as Raikou and Thundurus-T can easily severely damage Suicune with Thunderbolt, even after a Calm Mind boost.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Zarude pose an immense threat to Suicune with Horn Leech and Power Whip due to Suicune's lackluster Defense and poor Speed.

      "overview": "<p>Tyranitar's unique defensive typing and solid bulk under sand allow it to check prominent special attackers in the tier like Dragapult, Heatran, Tornadus-T, and Volcarona. Alternatively, Tyranitar can use its great Attack stat, amazing offensive typing, strong coverage options, and Choice Band to become a fearsome wallbreaker. Sand Stream allows Tyranitar to support sand sweepers like Excadrill, Dracozolt, and Sand Veil Garchomp. However, Tyranitar's typing leaves it vulnerable to common Pokemon in the metagame such as Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and Tapu Lele. Tyranitar's lack of reliable recovery makes it easy to wear down and hurts its ability to check Pokemon repeatedly throughout the game. Additionally, Tyranitar's low Speed leaves it susceptible to faster foes like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Rillaboom. Finally, many Pokemon that Tyranitar is supposed to check like Tornadus-T and Kyurem run super effective coverage moves to overwhelm it.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The specially defensive set can run Ice Beam to serve as a lure to Landorus-T and Garchomp, dealing a ton of damage on the switch, but it has limited uses outside of that, and running Thunder Wave is more useful to permanently cripple Pokemon like Corviknight and Clefable. Chople Berry allows Tyranitar to survive Fighting-type moves from the likes of Tornadus-T and Kyurem and KO them back with its Rock-type STAB move or cripple them with status conditions; however, it is a single-use item and Tyranitar prefers the longevity provided by Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots. A Dragon Dance set with Weakness Policy alongside dual screens support could be used on hyper offense teams, as dual screens allow Tyranitar to survive strong super effective moves like Garchomp's Earthquake and Tapu Lele's Moonblast while setting up. However, it has a mediocre Speed tier even after a boost, and it is outsped by threats like Zeraora, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Kartana, which can revenge kill it easily after some chip damage. The Choice Band set can use an EV spread of 40 HP / 252 Atk / 48 SpD / 168 Spe to withstand a Moonblast from Choice Specs Tapu Lele while still outspeeding Azumarill and Skarmory. Choice Band Tyranitar can also use Superpower to almost OHKO Ferrothorn if rain weakens Fire Punch while also OHKOing Heatran. Nevertheless, Tyranitar doesn't have enough room for it in this set, and it is also forced out by the stat drop, which can give free turns to dangerous threats.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Offensive Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill threaten to KO Tyranitar with their strong STAB Earthquakes. They can set up Stealth Rock or boost with Swords Dance as Tyranitar is scared out. However, they are worn down quickly if they switch into Choice Band Tyranitar's attacks. Albeit uncommon, physically defensive Hippowdon can take on any Tyranitar set lacking Toxic and set up Stealth Rock or hit it with its STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana can OHKO Tyranitar with their Grass-type STAB moves. However, they dislike being paralyzed by Thunder Wave, and they don't take hits from Choice Band Tyranitar very well. Tangrowth's great bulk coupled with Regenerator allows it to switch into Tyranitar with relative ease. However, it can be crippled by Thunder Wave or Toxic from the specially defensive set. Ferrothorn can switch into the specially defensive set almost unharmed, and it can set Spikes or cripple Tyranitar with Leech Seed. However, it must be wary of Fire Punch from the Choice Band set.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Urshifu-R and Barraskewda threaten Tyranitar with their STAB attacks. Also, they can gain momentum with U-turn or Flip Turn. However, they hate being hit with Thunder Wave or Toxic. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Swampert can tank a hit and threaten it with a Scald burn or just pivot out.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage: Though they must be wary of Thunder Wave, strong Fighting-types like Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos force out Tyranitar with their STAB moves, and they can gain momentum with U-turn as Tyranitar switches out. Pokemon that Tyranitar is supposed to check such as Tornadus-T, Kyurem, and Reuniclus usually run Fighting-type coverage to break past it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Fini can take on the specially defensive set fairly well, and they can chip at Tyranitar's health with their STAB moves. Nevertheless, they can't switch into Choice Band Tyranitar reliably. Offensive Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko can threaten Tyranitar with their STAB moves. None of them can switch into Choice Band attacks though, as they lack the bulk to do so.</p> ",

Rock Blast is the STAB move of choice, as it has higher PP and accuracy than Stone Edge. Also, it helps against Substitute users like Kyurem. Earthquake OHKOes Heatran while dealing good damage to Toxapex, Bisharp, and opposing Tyranitar. Thunder Wave cripples defensive switch-ins like Corviknight and Clefable, while Toxic can be used to put Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon on a timer. Leftovers provide passive recovery, increasing Tyranitar's longevity; on the other hand, Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to prevent Tyranitar from being worn down by entry hazards.</p> <p>Flying-types like Corviknight and Skarmory can deal with Grass- and Ground-types like Rillaboom, Kartana, Landorus-T, and Garchomp for Tyranitar, and both of them enjoy Tyranitar checking Heatran and Volcarona. Corviknight provides Defog support to prevent Tyranitar from being worn down by entry hazards, while Skarmory can set Spikes to form a hazard-stacking core with great defensive synergy. Nasty Plot Tornadus-T is noteworthy, as it can lure in Zapdos and smack it with a Rock-type Weather Ball under sand, which helps Tyranitar to keep Stealth Rock on the field. Slowbro can deal with Ground-, Water-, and Fighting-types that plague Tyranitar, such as Landorus-T, Barraskewda, and Urshifu-R, and it can bring Tyranitar in safely via Teleport. Similarly, Slowking can check some threats that Tyranitar can't such as Tapu Lele and Clefable while providing a secondary check to Heatran. Both Slowbro and Slowking enjoy Tyranitar's ability to check Dragapult and Volcarona. Moreover, they can bring in sand wallbreakers like Excadrill and especially Dracozolt safely with Teleport, and also both of them can use Future Sight, which is great to wear down opposing Pokemon for said wallbreakers. Tangrowth checks Ground-, Grass-, and Water-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Rillaboom, and Barraskewda, and it lures in Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos, which Tyranitar can set Stealth Rock on or cripple with status effects. Sand sweepers like Excadrill, Dracozolt, and Sand Veil Garchomp appreciate Tyranitar's sand and Stealth Rock support to wear down their checks for a late-game sweep. Excadrill also provides Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards and boost its own Speed simultaneously.</p> "

Additionally, its fantastic special bulk under sand gives it defensive utility and allows it to check certain Pokemon like Heatran and Volcarona. Fire Punch allows Tyranitar to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Kartana and Scizor, threatening them with an OHKO, while also providing another option to 2HKO Corviknight and Skarmory if Stone Edge PPs or its accuracy is a concern. Ice Punch nails Landorus-T and Garchomp on the switch while hitting Hippowdon for decent damage. Heavy Slam can be used to OHKO Clefable.</p> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar pairs well with pivots like Slowbro, Slowking, Tornadus-T, and Corviknight that can give it free switches to attack. Slowbro checks Ground- and Water-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Urshifu-R, while Slowking can check Tapu Lele and Clefable. Both of them offer Teleport to bring in Tyranitar safely and also provide Future Sight support, which makes Tyranitar far harder to switch into. Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Corviknight can deal with Grass- and Ground-types such as Rillaboom, Kartana, and Landorus-T, and they can bring Tyranitar in safely with U-turn against their own checks such as Zapdos and Heatran. Bulk Up Corviknight is a great teammate, as it appreciates Tyranitar's ability to deal with its checks such as Zapdos, Heatran, and Volcarona for a late-game sweep. Sand sweepers like Excadrill, Dracozolt, and Sand Veil Garchomp enjoy Tyranitar's sand and ability to weaken their checks such as Landorus-T and Corviknight, allowing them to clean late-game. Outside of sand teams, Pokemon such as Zeraora, Swords Dance Scizor, and Swords Dance Landorus-T benefit from Tyranitar weakening opposing Landorus-T and Corviknight, which gives them more opportunities to set up and break through opposing defensive cores or clean late-game.</p> "

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Roar is a decent option in place of Foul Play or Thunder Wave, as it wears down foes due to Stealth Rock and sand while providing amazing support against Baton Pass Calyrex-S teams, a strategy with very limited counterplay. Not having a Dark-type STAB move or Thunder Wave does, however, let Zacian-C, Choice Scarf Kyogre, and other wallbreakers switch in far more freely. Crunch can also be used over Foul Play to pressure Eternatus with more damage and potential Defense drops, but it doesn't have the same utility as many other options Tyranitar has access to.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective STAB Attacks: Tyranitar's typing leaves it with multiple weaknesses, so STAB attacks from multiple common Pokemon such as Marshadow, Necrozma-DM, and Xerneas can easily break through its bulk, and they don't take much damage from Tyranitar's attacks back.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Groudon and Zygarde's high natural Defense, Rock resistance, and immunity to Thunder Wave make them stone walls for Tyranitar. Groudon can switch in multiple times and use it to set up Stealth Rock or a more dangerous Swords Dance, and Zygarde-C can likewise freely set up with Dragon Dance or Coil, although Foul Play deters Swords Dance and Dragon Dance.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: All the major Water-types in the metagame can threaten Tyranitar, as none of them are largely bothered by the attacks it can throw out. Kyogre changes the weather and threatens an OHKO with its offensive sets, and defensive sets can set up on it with Calm Mind and use Rest to negate Thunder Wave, the only potentially troubling attack to Kyogre. Palkia and Dracovish hit it for massive damage if not an OHKO, and Tyranitar has no meaningful way to threaten Gastrodon or Quagsire. Offensive Kyogre, Palkia, and Dracovish must, however, switch in safely due to Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Zacian-C: Zacian-C has multiple ways to OHKO Tyranitar, and it easily takes advantage of the turns spent clicking Rest or Stealth Rock by forcing Tyranitar out and potentially getting setup turns. It doesn't appreciate being worn down by Foul Play or being paralyzed by Thunder Wave, however, limiting its switch-in opportunities.</p> ",

Rock Blast is chosen over other Rock-type STAB moves to beat SubSeed Calyrex-S while still forcing Yveltal out. Foul Play deters some physical attackers such as Zacian-C, Marshadow, and Groudon from switching in or setting up on Tyranitar. Thunder Wave is similarly useful, but it trades the ability to deter Zygarde or Groudon from setting up for the ability to cripple Kyogre and Xerneas. Tyranitar lacks reliable recovery, so it has to use Rest to heal from the continuous attacks it will likely be taking, but this does let it absorb status from the likes of Toxic Ho-Oh, Toxic Eternatus, and Giratina. Leftovers makes Tyranitar need to use Rest less often, but Heavy-Duty Boots is another solid option to increase its longevity. Maximum Special Defense and HP investment gives it the best chances of beating Calyrex-S over a longer game, which is generally its most important role, and is overall helpful for most special attackers that can't immediately threaten it such as Eternatus and specially offensive Yveltal.</p> <p>Tyranitar's best fit is on balance teams that appreciate its ability to check Calyrex-S, Yveltal, and Eternatus while also providing Stealth Rock support. This Stealth Rock support also gives teammates the moveset freedom to exert more pressure, like Necrozma-DM running more offensive Dragon Dance sets. Tyranitar can be overwhelmed by a number of offensive Pokemon in the metagame such as Zacian-C, Kyogre, Xerneas, and Groudon. Teammates that can deal with these threats such as Necrozma-DM, Eternatus, Ferrothorn, and Lunala, respectively, are all useful. Eternatus can additionally outspeed threats like Marshadow and Zygarde-C and deal with them with Dynamax Cannon while limiting opposing Necrozma-DM due to its good bulk and Pressure. Ferrothorn also switches into Kyogre reliably. Zacian-C can pressure Xerneas and revenge kill offensive Pokemon like weakened Groudon. It also appreciates sand weakening Necrozma-DM's recovery and Stealth Rock powering up Assurance, which makes Necrozma-DM lacking Heavy-Duty Boots struggles to switch into Zacian-C. Quagsire is a more reliable of way of dealing with Zacian-C than Necrozma-DM when paired with Tyranitar, as its recovery is not hindered by sand, but it can only find a place on bulky balance and stall teams. Offensive Excadrill requires Tyranitar as a teammate to work reliably, although Tyranitar does not require it.</p> "

Drapion and Bisharp are able to help against problematic Fairy-types like Primarina, Grimmsnarl, Galarian Weezing, and Mimikyu so Tyranitar can forego Heavy Slam.

          "description": "<p>Tyranitar's great bulk and unique defensive typing let it check a bunch of scary threats such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, Mega Gengar, Eternatus, and Mewtwo. Pursuit allows Tyranitar to trap Pokemon that it forces out, such as Mega Gengar, Mewtwo, and Choice item variants of Mega Rayquaza, as well as break Lunala's Shadow Shield if it tries to switch out. A Rock-type move is recommended in order to check Yveltal properly and to force out Ho-Oh; Rock Tomb is chosen for its Speed-lowering effect, which neutralizes Max Airstream users like Yveltal, Mewtwo, and Thundurus-T and preserves momentum against faster threats like Zacian-C and Eternatus. Foul Play deals major damage to Zacian-C and offensive Primal Kyogre, deterring them from switching in freely, as well as threats Tyranitar is supposed to check like Mega Gengar, Mewtwo, and, if running Shuca Berry, Mega Rayquaza and Ultra Necrozma. Alternatively, Stealth Rock is a decent option due to Tyranitar's good matchup against common Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Lunala. Rest gives Tyranitar a source of recovery and lets it shrug off status ailments like Toxic poison from Ho-Oh, Eternatus, and Lunala. Roar allows Tyranitar to phaze non-Dynamaxed setup sweepers like Vivillon, prevents Geomancy Xerneas from setting up on it, and racks up entry hazard damage. Leftovers reduces the need for Tyranitar to use Rest by giving it passive recovery, which is helpful because it's very prone to chip damage from entry hazards and status ailments. Alternatively, Tyranitarite is a decent option if none of Tyranitar's teammates are using a Mega Stone, as it gives Tyranitar significantly more bulk and power at the cost of being unable to Dynamax. Chople Berry reduces the damage taken from Fighting-type attacks such as Focus Blast from Mega Gengar and Yveltal. Shuca Berry allows Tyranitar to survive a boosted hit from physical attackers such as Mega Rayquaza, Ultra Necrozma, and Extreme Killer Arceus; this item should be used alongside Foul Play. The EV spread maximizes special bulk for threats such as Yveltal, Mega Gengar, and Eternatus. Shuca Berry can optionally be used with a physically defensive spread to take on the aforementioned physical attackers better.</p> <p>Tyranitar is a good fit on balanced teams that can accommodate its many weaknesses. Defensive Necrozma-DM is an excellent partner, as it is able to handle Zacian-C and check Xerneas, and it appreciates Tyranitar's ability to deal with Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Eternatus in return. Note that sand limits Morning Sun's recovery, however. Arceus-Ground is able to check Primal Groudon and Zygarde-C well, while Tyranitar can deal with Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Ferrothorn and Primal Groudon are able to check Primal Kyogre; Ferrothorn in particular provides Spikes support, allowing Tyranitar to rack up more damage on the opposing team with Roar, and can use Knock Off on Ho-Oh, letting Tyranitar pressure said foe with Stealth Rock. Primal Groudon can run Stealth Rock, freeing up a moveslot on Tyranitar. Ditto is a great partner that makes up for Tyranitar's lackluster matchup versus offense, while wallbreakers such as Xerneas, Yveltal, Zacian-C, and Primal Kyogre can help to pressure bulky teams that Tyranitar struggles to dent.</p> "

Rock Slide lets it take care of many threats to Dark teams such as Volcarona, Tornadus-T, and Mega Charizard Y. Heavy Slam gives Tyranitar the ability to take on Tapu Lele and Hatterene, while Fire Blast hits most Steel-type physical walls such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor that would otherwise wall Tyranitar. Tyranitar can cripple faster foes that don't get OHKOed by Rock Slide with Thunder Wave such as Latios and Dragonite. Leftovers gives Tyranitar some passive recovery that increases its longevity.

Hydreigon especially helps in the Poison and Steel matchups as a Substitute + Nasty Plot sweeper or a faster teammate for an edge in the Dragon matchup. Mega Sableye is a great choice as a Mega Evolution and can act in tandem with Tyranitar, since it is immune to Fighting and can keep entry hazards off your side of the field while spreading burns with Will-O-Wisp. Greninja can be geared to help in any matchup and runs a variety of different sets including Choice Specs, Choice Scarf, Grassium-Z, Icium-Z or Expert Belt. Choice Specs is particularly helpful in the Dragon and Flying matchups, while Grassium-Z is great in the Water and Ground matchups. Icium-Z helps break defensive Celesteela after an Ice Beam, and Extrasensory with Expert Belt can break through Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, which give Tyranitar a lot of trouble. Choice Scarf Greninja can revenge kill opposing Choice Scarf users such as Latios, Latias, and Landorus-T as well as Mega Aerodactyl. Toxic Spikes can be fitted into any of these sets to support entry hazard stacking. Mandibuzz can help check physical setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Mega Scizor, and is also able to clear entry hazards with Defog. Alolan Muk is extremely helpful with taking on pesky Fairy-types and can take advantage of Fairy teams' passive Pokemon such as Klefki to set up with Curse. Zarude is another great teammate that gives an edge in the Water and Ground matchups since it becomes very dangerous after one or two Bulk Ups, and Weavile could be helpful versus Flying with its hard hitting STAB Ice-type attacks. Bisharp is a strong physical attacker that can set up with Swords Dance and provides great priority in Sucker Punch.</p> "

Its access to reliable recovery, a great Speed tier, and an extensive support movepool ensures that it can keep itself healthy with relative ease and effectively check various threats such as Zygarde, Groudon, and Rayquaza. Its walling capabilities, however, are entirely dependent on Multiscale, which makes Lugia very hard to utilize considering it must be kept at full health or else risk being taken down by the multitude of fast and strong wallbreakers in the metagame. Lugia also despises all status ailments and must avoid them at all costs, making cleric support with Lugia important and making it a natural fit on stall teams. While Heavy-Duty Boots is a godsend to rid Lugia of its weakness to Stealth Rock, it also means it lacks passive recovery and can't switch in on certain Pokemon it would otherwise beat, such as Landorus, in fear of Knock Off. Lugia's defensive typing also leaves much to be desired, giving it weaknesses to the extremely common Ghost- and Dark-type attacks. It also cannot deal with the best offensive and defensive threats in the metagame, being completely outclassed by Necrozma-DM and Lunala, both of which share Lugia's Psychic-type but have a much better secondary typing in Steel and Ghost, respectively. On more dedicated stall builds, Giratina is bulkier and can provide more for its team.</p> ",

Whirlwind allows Lugia to phaze out foes like Zygarde that are trying to set up. Ice Beam hits Ground- and Dragon-type foes for a considerable amount of damage, OHKOing Rayquaza after Stealth Rock and 3HKOing Zygarde-C while Lugia shrugs off their attacks. Toxic is Lugia's main way of dealing with the majority of the metagame; it should be used liberally against foes that are not Steel- or Poison-type to whittle them down and stall them out with Lugia's fantastic bulk. Thunder Wave is an option to incapacitate wallbreakers that try to switch in on Lugia, such as Calyrex-S and Urshifu-S, or the aforementioned Steel- and Poison-types, like Necrozma-DM and Eternatus. 96 Speed EVs are utilized so that Lugia can outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured base 90s like Kyogre and Groudon, as well as maximum Speed Necrozma-DM.</p> <p>Lugia requires heavy team support, as it is extremely passive and is only seen on more stall-oriented builds.

Ghost-types in general are a problem for Lugia, especially Calyrex-S. As such, Yveltal acts as a good answer to them. Lugia struggles against the premier Steel-types of the metagame in Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn, so teammates that can beat them are appreciated. Physically defensive Eternatus can use Flamethrower to beat them both, shrugging off their hits and PP stalling them with Pressure. Ho-Oh can threaten them with Sacred Fire and can also remove entry hazards for Lugia with Defog if Lugia's Heavy-Duty Boots are removed. It also serves as a switch-in to Calyrex-S and Marshadow, scouting their sets. In return, Lugia can deal with Zygarde and Rayquaza, both of which give Ho-Oh trouble. Cleric support is necessary in case Lugia gets statused, so Blissey and Chansey make perfect teammates, removing status and acting as emergency switch-ins to Ghost-type attacks.

          "description": "<p>Owing to Lugia's high natural bulk, decent defensive typing, and invaluable ability in Multiscale, it serves as a potent blanket check and emergency switchin to some of AG's most potent threats, including Mega Rayquaza, Zacian-C, and Ultra Necrozma. Access to valuable support moves such as Whirlwind and Toxic and Thunder Wave allows it to accrue chip damage or cripple the aforementioned threats, allowing them to be more easily handled. Roost is chosen over Recover in order to have a better matchup against Swords Dance Primal Groudon and a paralyzed Zacian-C by negating super effective damage from their coverage moves and Wild Charge. Whirlwind is vital in shutting down setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Primal Groudon, Mega Rayquaza, Zacian-C, Xerneas, and Swords Dance Arceus formes, which may take advantage of Lugia's relative passiveness, while also allowing Lugia to rack up chip damage alongside entry hazards. However, it cannot be relied on to phaze some threats such as Dragon Tail Zygarde-C and Dynamax users. Thunder Wave allows Lugia to outspeed offensive threats and freely use Roost on them in order to have Multiscale up versus their attacks, making them much easier to deal with. In particular, it punishes Zacian-C, Mega Rayquaza, and Eternatus. Toxic allows Lugia to cripple switch-ins such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal while chipping away at offensive Pokemon such as Mega Rayquaza and Primal Groudon. Psychic, and Ice Beam to a lesser extent, are options in order to prevent Lugia from being trapped and removed by Mega Gengar; Ice Beam can also deter Dragon Tail Zygarde-C from setting up and damage Mega Rayquaza and Yveltal, although it is relatively weak. Multiscale is what enables Lugia to switch-in reliably to threats such as Mega Rayquaza, and so keeping it intact by preventing Lugia from being statused and keeping it at full HP is vital. Hence, a variant of this set with Leftovers and with Substitute over Thunder Wave can be run, which notably allows Lugia to defeat Dragon Tail Zygarde-C. Opting for this variant, however, mandates a great deal of entry hazard removal for Multiscale to function, and this set is also more prone to being trapped by Mega Gengar.</p> <p>Lugia is very passive and so fits mainly on fatter balance teams and stall teams. Dragon Tail Zygarde-C can heavily take advantage of non-Substitute Lugia, as it is faster than Lugia. Therefore, strong Zygarde-C checks such as Ice Beam or Perish Song support Arceus forms work well with it. Yveltal also massively threatens Lugia and can only be statused in return. Strong Yveltal switch-ins such as Diancie, Chansey, Tyranitar or Ho-Oh to an extent can help mitigate this. Tyranitar also provides Pursuit support in order to combat Mega Gengar and Lunala, which dispose of non-Psychic sets, but Tyranitar must be used carefully, as its ability can break Multiscale. Additionally, Lugia cannot handle being statused and so is forced out by bulky status users such as Ho-Oh, Eternatus and Necrozma-DM, making status absorbers such as Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh and Rest users such as Zygarde-C, Giratina, and Primal Groudon are good partners. Clerics such as Chansey, Diancie, and Xerneas significantly assist Lugia in this regard as well, in the case it does get statused. Stealth Rock is useful in order to rack up chip damage with Whirlwind; often a key way for stall teams to damage the opposing team's wallbreakers; and so the aforementioned Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and support Arceus forms pair well with it as well as Spikes Ferrothorn. If a Leftovers + Substitute set is opted for, reliable Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and support Arceus forms as well as Magic Bounce users such as Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye are recommended. Gothitelle is a major vulnerability for Lugia and the stall style builds it features on, and it is not possible to patch up this weakness.</p> "

Stealth Rock heavily limits Choice Band Ho-Oh.</p> <p><strong>Toxic: While the threat of Toxic is lowered thanks to Regenerator, its damage can add up, especially in late-game scenarios.

However, you should be careful about using it, as its PP is low—and even lower against Eternatus switch-ins. Ho-Oh is a great user of Defog, as it is able to repeatedly come into Necrozma-DM. Toxic is a good option to stall out Pokemon that don’t particularly mind burns or are immune to them, such as Yveltal and opposing Ho-Oh. Thunder Wave is a great option for Eternatus, which is a very common switch-in that is immune to Toxic and not bothered by burns. Whirlwind is to phaze Xerneas, although it also has its uses for other setup sweepers such as Zygarde-C, Cosmic Power Eternatus, and Calyrex-S. However, you need to watch out for Ingrain Xerneas. Brave Bird is a strong secondary STAB option that hits Fire-resistant Pokemon like Eternatus and Kyogre much harder, and it helps with Sacred Fire's low PP. The given EV spread allows Ho-Oh to always survive a +2 Xerneas's Thunder, with the leftover EVs put into Defense to better deal with physical attackers such as Marshadow. If you run Thunder Wave, a spread of 248 HP / 192 Def / 52 SpD / 16 Spe should be used to let Ho-Oh outspeed Choice Specs Calyrex-S after paralysis.</p> <p>Smart switching is the key to using this set, both in terms of Regenerator recovery and scouting for status or Rock-type coverage moves. Marshadow, Xerneas, and Calyrex-S are too threatening to leave Ho-Oh as your only check to them. Choice Band Marshadow can 2HKO with Poltergeist or Spectral Thief, while Xerneas can threaten to KO Ho-Oh with a boosted Thunder if Ho-Oh has taken damage, or use Ingrain to prevent Ho-Oh from phazing it. Choice Specs Calyrex-S will 2HKO Ho-Oh outright. As such, Pokemon such as Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, Zarude, Buzzwole, Lunala, and Tangrowth make good defensive partners. Necrozma-DM can provide a solid defense against Ice-Types, Offensive Eternatus, and Xerneas, as well as give Stealth Rock and status support, while Yveltal will keep Calyrex-S at bay. Lunala, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth also offer good defense against Groudon, Zekrom, and Zygarde-C, while the latter two offer a good pivot against Marshadow. Eternatus and Blissey are excellent teammates for their ability to switch into Kyogre. All of the aforementioned Pokemon appreciate Ho-Oh's ability to serve as a backup check to the tier's biggest sweepers, as well as Defog. Zarude in particular likes Ho-Oh’s ability to Defog, as Zarude often replaces Yveltal on teams, and in return, Zarude can role compress a Calyrex-S check and Ground-type check into one. Ho-Oh can consistently switch into entry hazard setters such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn and force them out, even if they hit it with Knock Off. However, if Ho-Oh hard switches into these Pokemon every time, it can becomd predictable and be taken advantage of by double switches. Ho-Oh must be wary of alternative setters of Stealth Rock, such as Groudon and Tyranitar. Having a secondary Defog user, such as Yveltal, can be useful for providing more security against such Pokemon, as well as against Sticky Web and other offensive playstyles, depending on your team structure. Alternatively, Ho-Oh can be used to free up moveslots on Pokemon such as Yveltal and Necrozma-DM, who now don’t need to run Defog or check Xerneas, respectively.</p> "

Whirlwind is generally preferred, as it gives Ho-Oh more defensive utility in phazing opposing Ho-Oh and Zygarde-C in a pinch. Flare Blitz does massive damage and is stronger than Sacred Fire; it also makes up for Sacred Fire’s low PP. Defog can be used in emergency situations to clear away Stealth Rock.

Flare Blitz is an alternative strong Fire-type STAB move with more PP than Sacred Fire, but it sacrifices Sacred Fire's high burn chance and reduces Ho-Oh's longevity through recoil.

          "description": "<p>Ho-Oh is one of the most consistent pivots in AG thanks to its solid natural bulk coupled with an expansive utility movepool, strong defensive typing, and amazing ability. Ho-Oh can switch into a plethora of common threats, including Yveltal, Zacian-C, and Eternatus, allowing for movepool scouting and wasting Dynamax turns from threats such as Yveltal and Zygarde-C. Sacred Fire is Ho-Oh's primary means of damage output, notably allowing it to deal heavy damage to opposing Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C while threatening to burn potential switch-ins such as Eternatus and Zekrom, which could otherwise take advantage of it. Great care must be taken, however, to ensure that one's Sacred Fire PP does not get wasted over the course of a battle, especially if the opponent has a Pressure user such as Eternatus, Palkia, or Giratina. Toxic allows Ho-Oh to reliably cripple a significant portion of the metagame, notably putting Yveltal, Palkia lacking Rest, Calyrex-S, and numerous other threats on timers, while also helping to deter potential switch-ins, particularly preventing Kyogre from switching in freely on Ho-Oh. Defog lets Ho-Oh provide invaluable utility to its team, helping to keep the field clear of Spikes and Stealth Rock. It also notably protects Necrozma-DM from Assurance Zacian-C, which is particularly beneficial, as Ho-Oh has a good matchup versus common entry hazard users such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn. Whirlwind is chosen to enable Ho-Oh to deter Pokemon like Xerneas and Dragon Dance Zygarde-C from setting up while also enabling it to be a last-ditch defense against potential runaway sweepers like +1 Calyrex-S. Alternatively, Protect can be used to allow Ho-Oh to more reliably check Yveltal, waste multiple turns of Yveltal's or Xerneas's Dynamax, and scout what move Choice-item users lock into. Brave Bird can also be used to let Ho-Oh chip Eternatus and to potentially boost its Speed under Dynamax. Regenerator gives Ho-Oh a source of reliable recovery throughout the match, allowing it to pivot into attacks from a wide variety of potentially threatening attackers with ease. The given EVs with an Impish nature allow Ho-Oh to survive a +2 Thunder from Geomancy Xerneas from full health while also maximizing physical bulk and minimizing Stealth Rock damage if Heavy-Duty Boots is Knocked Off.</p> <p>Ho-Oh can fit on all manner of balance, bulky offense, and stall teams thanks to its ability to pivot into a significant portion of the metagame's attackers, enabling teammates safer switches. Ho-Oh can also provide invaluable utility as a status absorber, protecting its teammates from potentially crippling status. An especially good teammate for Ho-Oh is the nigh mandatory Necrozma-DM, which greatly appreciates the presence of a secondary Xerneas and Zacian-C check. Ho-Oh should be used with caution around opposing Knock Off Ferrothorn and Necrozma-DM, since the loss of Heavy-Duty Boots severely reduces Ho-Oh's survivability. Additionally, teammates such as Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Eternatus can all pair well with Ho-Oh, since they reliably check Kyogre, which would otherwise threaten Ho-Oh. Notably, Ferrothorn and Eternatus can provide hazard support, which pairs well with Ho-Oh's ability to force switches through Whirlwind. Ho-Oh should not be a team's only check to Yveltal, so teammates such as specially defensive Eternatus and Tyranitar can be useful to have.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots, Ho-Oh has established itself as a staple of the AG metagame. An immunity to Stealth Rock granted by this item allows it to make full use of its fantastic ability, Regenerator, to switch into a large portion of the metagame. Ho-Oh is very effective at assisting its teammates when coupled with its solid array of support moves. Sacred Fire is an excellent STAB move due to having a high chance of inflicting a burn. Along with Toxic, this prevents a large part of the metagame from using Ho-Oh's presence as an opportunity to switch in. However, this excludes status absorbers like Eternatus, Rest variants of Tyranitar, Zygarde-C, Primal Kyogre, and Refresh Arceus formes. Defog is an excellent choice on Ho-Oh due to its ability to indefinitely switch in and out with no fear of entry hazards, provided its item has not been removed. Ho-Oh also naturally forces out premier entry hazard setters in Ferrothorn and, to a lesser extent, Necrozma-DM, although it should watch out for Knock Off from both of them. Whirlwind racks up entry hazard damage and phazes Pokemon that would otherwise take advantage of Ho-Oh's reliance on spreading status to beat foes. Such Pokemon include Eternatus, Calm Mind Arceus formes, non-Dynamaxed Xerneas, non-Dragon Tail Zygarde-C, and sleep inducers like Smeargle and Vivillon. Protect facilitates stalling out the Dynamax turns of Pokemon like Yveltal and Xerneas, Toxic damage, and low PP moves such as Stone Edge and Dynamax Cannon. It also allows Ho-Oh to scout Choice item users. Brave Bird can be used as a spammable STAB move that hits Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Mega Rayquaza, and Primal Kyogre for immediate damage. 52 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Ho-Oh is never OHKOed by +2 Thunder from non-Dynamaxed Xerneas. The remaining EVs are used to maximize Ho-Oh's physical bulk, ensuring that it lives one hit from Zacian-C and any Mega Rayquaza variant at full HP and can punish these foes if they try to set up on it. The bulk can also be useful for pivoting into physical attackers like Choice item Mega Rayquaza and a Ditto that has copied Zacian-C; notably, Ho-Oh narrowly avoids the 2HKO from +2 Behemoth Blade. If Ho-Oh is running Brave Bird, 16 Speed EVs should be run to outspeed Adamant Mega Rayquaza after using Max Airstream once and Jolly Zacian-C after using it twice. A specially defensive EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Careful nature can be run alongside Protect to pivot into Yveltal and Xerneas and stall out their Dynamax turns more effectively. However, both of these Pokemon can still OHKO Ho-Oh with Rock Slide or +2 Max Lightning, respectively, and it will have a much worse matchup against the aforementioned physical attackers.</p> <p>Ho-Oh fits best on balance teams in need of a pivot, entry hazard remover, and phazer. Use it as a universal pivot, since it is able to switch into almost every Pokemon that can't hit it super effectively. However, make sure to replenish its health through constant pivoting after tanking a powerful hit, such as Life Orb Mega Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent or Dynamaxed Yveltal's Max Darkness. Ho-Oh must also be wary of powerful Rock-type coverage moves, such as Stone Edge from Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ultra Necrozma and Rock Slide from Yveltal. Getting hit by Knock Off severely limits Ho-Oh's effectiveness if the opponent's Stealth Rock setter beats Ho-Oh, so don't recklessly switch it into Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn that may carry this move. Also, try not to let Ho-Oh get poisoned unless it gives you an opportunity to reciprocate by burning or poisoning the foe. Common scenarios include two Ho-Oh trading Toxic and Necrozma-DM using Toxic against a Ho-Oh using Sacred Fire. Ho-Oh also offers some help with wasting the opponent's Dynamax turns by switching into powerful Dynamaxed moves, using Protect, and then pivoting out into a teammate. Ho-Oh should be paired with sturdy physical walls in order to take on physical attackers like Primal Groudon, Mega Rayquaza, and Zacian-C that threaten it. Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, and defensive Zygarde-C are good checks to the former two, whereas defensive Necrozma-DM can switch into the latter two. Primal Kyogre also greatly threatens Ho-Oh and can even switch in for free if it's running Rest and Ho-Oh lacks Brave Bird. Thus, Primal Groudon, Ferrothorn, and defensive Eternatus make for good teammates. Wallbreakers such as Yveltal, Xerneas, Zacian-C, and Eternatus can threaten defensive teams that Ho-Oh struggles with, and the latter two appreciate Ho-Oh covering their weaknesses. Pairing Ho-Oh with Primal Groudon or defensive Necrozma-DM is an excellent way to Imposter-proof your team if you are using Zacian-C. This is because Ho-Oh can only be taken out by Ditto's Wild Charge from full HP, whereas the other two only fear Ditto's Close Combat, and Assurance if entry hazards are up, if healthy.</p> "

Additionally, Celebi is quite adept at managing bulky Water- and Ground-types like Vaporeon, Mantine, and Mudsdale thanks to Natural Cure and its typing, taking away the worry of a Toxic poison preventing it from sweeping late-game and letting it easily set up against them. However, Celebi's horrible defensive typing leaves it vulnerable to several common revenge killers such as Talonflame, Salazzle, Sucker Punch Toxicroak, and First Impression Sirfetch'd, which offsets its ability to somewhat easily find setup opportunities, and while it has good coverage, foes like Copperajah, Drapion, and Guzzlord can still pose problems for it. Celebi also faces competition from Decidueye and Rotom-C as a Grass-type setup sweeper; they both possess more defensive utility, Decidueye has priority to pick off potential revenge killers, and Rotom-C has Volt Switch to ease prediction early- and mid-game.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Celebi can provide a team with an immense amount of support, with moves like U-turn, Healing Wish, and Trick all being great options on it. This set can run into issues picking which utility moves to run, though—give careful thought to which ones your team needs the most. Specially defensive sets are similar in that they can utilize an array of coverage moves—U-turn, Thunder Wave, and Stealth Rock are notable ones—and are reasonable checks to offensive Water-types like Starmie, Blastoise, and Kingdra. Celebi's awful defensive typing, however, limits their ability to succeed. On hyper offense teams, Celebi can run an offensive Stealth Rock set with Healing Wish to give setup sweepers like Blastoise, Swords Dance Sirfetch'd, and Salazzle more early- and mid-game leeway, but these teams typically prefer other leads like Aerodactyl that can set Stealth Rock and then KO themselves, thus preserving momentum.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Even with coverage moves, Celebi can struggle against Copperajah. Escavalier and Levitate Bronzong can contend with any coverage move from Celebi, although the latter has a good chance to be 2HKOed by Aura Sphere and can only threaten back with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Specially defensive Dhelmise has the power and bulk to dispatch Celebi after minimal chip damage with Poltergeist. Other Ghost-types like Decidueye and Silvally-Ghost can handle Celebi if it's unboosted, but they're KOed by +2 Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Celebi is very vulnerable to common revenge killers like Talonflame, Salazzle, and Choice Scarf Passimian as well as First Impression from Sirfetch'd.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Although Celebi can bypass them after a Nasty Plot, Dark-types such as Guzzlord and Drapion can deal with it when unboosted and easily take it out.

Celebi also pairs great with status-weak Pokemon like Mudsdale, non-Heal Bell Vaporeon, and Mantine that commonly get hit by Toxic. Vaporeon in particular is a good teammate because it checks Talonflame for Celebi. Dark- and Ghost-types like Guzzlord, Decidueye, and Dhelmise can give Celebi issues depending on how healthy they are and whether Celebi has boosted; teammates like Diancie and Drapion help cover these threats. Fire-types like Talonflame and Arcanine are great to have because they deal with Decidueye and Dhelmise. In return, Celebi can handle Mudsdale and Diancie.</p> "

Ferroseed can freely set up Spikes against Marshtomp.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users: Hattrem prevents Marshtomp from setting up Stealth Rock, reflects its status moves, and often carries Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Rufflet and Duosion can use Marshtomp as setup fodder. The former has Substitute to avoid Marshtomp's status moves, while Duosion is immune to Toxic but must be wary of Yawn.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Marshtomp is vulnerable to chip damage from entry hazards and status moves due to its lack of reliable recovery, which limits its ability to check offensive threats.</p> ",

It also punishes Ferroseed and Duosion, which are both immune to Toxic, from switching in. Marshtomp can also opt for a mixed spread of 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 SpD and an Impish nature to better handle Piloswine and Pikachu, while still avoiding a 2HKO from Life Orb Kadabra and a 3HKO from Electabuzz and Magmar.</p> <p>Marshtomp should aim to use its typing to force switches and set up Stealth Rock early-game and then focus on walling special attackers. Physical walls such as Koffing, Tangela, and Gurdurr benefit from Marshtomp checking special wallbreakers such as Kadabra and Magmar; in return, they handle physical wallbreakers such as Thwackey and Gurdurr. Pokemon that provide entry hazard control like Gurdurr, Galarian Mr. Mime, and Vullaby keep Marshtomp from being quickly worn down by residual damage. As a wall that lacks reliable recovery, Marshtomp greatly appreciates support from Wish and Healing Wish users such as Clefairy and Hattrem. Pokemon that can check Grass-types such as Golbat, Magmar, and Koffing are solid partners, as they cover for Marshtomp's glaring 4x weakness.</p> "

Stealth Rock is another option, as Mega Swampert threatens the most common entry hazard removers such as Zapdos, Corviknight, and Excadrill when in rain. Bulk Up, while appealing, wastes valuable turns of rain while simply not being better than any other available option. Liquidation's slightly higher Base Power than Waterfall might also look appealing, but it doesn't improve any notable damage rolls, and Waterfall's chance to flinch is more useful overall.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Physically bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Alomomola threaten out Mega Swampert due to the risk of a Scald burn. Rotom-W also forces out Mega Swampert with Will-O-Wisp while being immune or resistant to all of its STAB attacks. Toxapex cannot switch into Earthquake, but it can stomach an Earthquake from full health and threaten a Scald burn in return. However, Mega Swampert can use Flip Turn to bring in a teammate such as Manaphy or Zapdos to take advantage of these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Rocky Helmet Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur take minimal damage from Mega Swampert's attacks and threaten it back with an OHKO from Giga Drain. Ferrothorn also threatens Mega Swampert with Power Whip, but it is exploitable due to how easily Mega Swampert and its teammates can wear it down, and it fears Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority: Priority moves bypass Mega Swampert's excellent Speed in rain. Rillaboom threatens to OHKO Mega Swampert with Grassy Glide, resists both of its STAB attacks, and is passively kept healthy due to Grassy Terrain, making it a very effective check. However, Rillaboom does have to beware catching an Ice Punch if it switches into Mega Swampert. Ash-Greninja can't switch in to Mega Swampert but threatens it with rain-boosted Water Shuriken. Other priority moves, such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham's Fake Out and Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch, can wear Mega Swampert down quickly.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon Outside of Rain: Mega Swampert's dependence on rain to outspeed the entire metagame can be exploited by Pokemon such as Kyurem, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Medicham when rain is not active.

Flip Turn allows Mega Swampert to act as an offensive pivot against threatening Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Slowbro for teammates such as Zapdos and Manaphy to take advantage of them.

Zapdos is an especially fantastic partner, as not only does it threaten Slowbro, Mega Venusaur, and Tangrowth for Mega Swampert, but it can also defensively handle Rillaboom. Mega Swampert also helps the aforementioned teammates punch through Gastrodon and Ferrothorn while being immune to the Electric-type attacks that they are commonly weak to. Finally, Ferrothorn is an especially nice partner, as it provides entry hazards to weaken Mega Swampert's checks while defensively answering Ash-Greninja and Kyurem.</p> "

Earthquake is used to prevent Swampert from being strictly passive, allowing it to hit Electric- and Poison-types like Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Toxapex. Roar not only takes advantage of the aforementioned Stealth Rock, but it allows Swampert to phaze setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Dragonite, preventing it from becoming setup fodder. Flip Turn takes advantage of Swampert's little Speed investment to allow the player to gain momentum by having switch advantage. Swampert's EVs allow it to survive a Grass Knot from Choice Specs Tapu Koko and KO it back with Earthquake.</p> <p>Almost all Water-type Pokemon benefit from the presence of Swampert on the team, as it is able to shield the rest of the team from Electric-type moves such as Rising Voltage and Thunderbolt, as well as set Stealth Rock. Notable mentions of Pokemon that benefit from Swampert being on a team are Pelipper and Mantine, as they both have a 4x weakness to Electric-type moves. Pelipper and Mantine can also switch into Ground-type moves to prevent Swampert from taking unnecessary damage. Pelipper can set rain for Swift Swim teammates that Swampert can pivot in via Flip Turn, and Mantine can use Defog for its teammates. Due to the aforementioned immunity, Swampert and Toxapex form a defensive backbone together, with Toxapex being able to take on physical attackers for Swampert such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Dragonite. Toxapex can also absorb Toxic Spikes and Toxic for Swampert. Swampert assists wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Barraskewda. These wallbreakers are able to take care of walls such as Blissey, Porygon2, and Skarmory, which Swampert struggles against due to its passive nature. Choice Specs Keldeo especially is an amazing teammate for Swampert, as Flip Turn can bring it in to obtain KOs on both physical and special walls such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela. Choice Scarf Urshifu-R heavily benefits from the presence of Swampert, as it not only provides an aforementioned immunity to Electric but a special wall to take the special hits that Urshifu-R cannot. In turn, Urshifu-R can handle Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Ferrothorn for Swampert, as well as being able to revenge kill threats such as Tapu Koko and Zeraora. Tapu Fini prevents Swampert from being statused and can help Swampert avoid entry hazard damage with Defog. Tapu Fini also deals with Dragon-types that can wall Swampert such as Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Latios. Slowking also appreciates the aforementioned immunity as well, and Swampert appreciates a switch-in for certain special attackers such as Tapu Lele. Suicune is an excellent partner for Swampert due to its ability to stall out many bulkier Pokemon that Swampert would otherwise be unable to hit such as Celesteela. Slowking can form a pivoting core with Swampert, bringing in teammates like Barraskewda safely and then having them wreak havoc.</p> "

Manaphy can break past physical walls and checks to Mega Swampert such as Skarmory, Dragonite, and Mega Venusaur thanks to its wallbreaking potential with Tail Glow and great coverage moves. Additionally, thanks to its ability Hydration, it can absorb status for Mega Swampert then use Rest, effectively allowing it to act as a stallbreaker. One of Slowking and Toxapex are typically present on rain teams due to their ability Regenerator, allowing them to act as tanks while being able to pivot out with Teleport or Eject Button, respectively, safely bringing in Mega Swampert.

Speed is less important on Zigzagoon than on most sweepers due to Extreme Speed's priority, so the remaining EVs maximize Zigzagoon's defenses to assist in setting up. 132 HP EVs give Zigzagoon an even 22 HP, which allows it to trigger Berry Juice after using Belly Drum at full health. Quick Feet can be useful if Zigzagoon gets inflicted by status, as it allows Zigzagoon to outspeed Onix and hit it with Seed Bomb. Pickup can also be used to take a foe's consumed Berry Juice, although such situations are rare.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Zigzagoon is best used to clean up weakened teams after its counters have been weakened or eliminated. Focus on pressuring Rock- and Steel- types like Onix and Pawniard; Arena Trap users like Diglett and Trapinch can be especially useful in this role. Knock Off support allows Zigzagoon to OHKO bulkier foes like Spritzee and Timburr and can chip frailer Pokemon that resist Extreme Speed like Pawniard into range. Once a sweep is possible, finding a successful Belly Drum is the next challenge. Support from Memento or dual screens allows Zigzagoon to set up on a wider array of Pokemon. Otherwise, try to find a turn to use Belly Drum against a passive foe like Spritzee or Mareanie that can't OHKO Zigzagoon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Diglett and Trapinch are fantastic partners for Zigzagoon; Diglett has the bonus of providing Memento support, while Trapinch can more reliably remove Pawniard and Onix due to its superior bulk and access to Giga Drain. Vullaby can help as well by luring in Rock- and Steel-types and pivoting to a trapper via U-turn. Like most sweepers, Zigzagoon benefits from entry hazard support from the likes of Dwebble and Pawniard; for example, Stealth Rock guarantees an OHKO on standard bulky Mienfoo and Mareanie. Sticky Web support, primarily provided by Dewpider, can neutralize Onix by allowing Zigzagoon to outspeed and hit it with Seed Bomb. Dual screens support provide an alternative to Memento, but few good users exist; Natu and Amaura are passable options.</p> "

Seed Bomb hits bulky Water-type Pokemon like Seismitoad, Milotic, and Suicune for greater damage than Extreme Speed, and also 2HKOes Quagsire, which can otherwise wall Linoone easily by ignoring its boosts with Unaware. Alternatively, Throat Chop hits Pokemon like Dhelmise, Cresselia, and Reuniclus while potentially letting Linoone set up on Sylveon and Toxitricity.

Cloyster is another good partner that wears down Cobalion, and it can potentially lure and heavily damage it with Hydro Pump. Steelix and Cobalion are also worn down by Spikes support from Klefki and Golisopod. Finally, Linoone appreciates Memento support from teammates like Gardevoir and Zoroark.</p> "

  "Wingull": {
    "lc": {
      "overview": "<p>Wingull is one of the fastest Pokemon in LC, and its STAB combination of Water and Flying has almost perfect coverage. It is able to weaken bulky Pokemon in the beginning of the game with U-turn, Knock Off, and Scald and can use its excellent Speed tier and powerful attacks to tear through weakened teams later in the game. Defensive Pokemon such as Mareanie, Ferroseed, and Spritzee cannot comfortably switch into Wingull's attacks, especially if they have lost their Eviolite to Knock Off from Wingull or a teammate. U-turn lets Wingull pivot into a trapper like Trapinch or Diglett to eliminate Ground-weak checks like Chinchou and Mareanie or build momentum. Wingull has some glaring flaws, however. Its awful bulk makes it crippled if it switches into any non-Ground-type attack, and it is quickly weakened by Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock. Additionally, its primary attack, Hurricane, has only 70% accuracy, meaning Wingull will often fail to get important KOs.</p> ",
      "sets": [
        {
          "name": "Life Orb",
          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hurricane is Wingull's most powerful attack. Despite its shaky accuracy, the extra power is essential for important KOs like OHKOing Eviolite Oddish. Scald complements Hurricane as Wingull's other STAB attack; many Pokemon that resist Hurricane, like Onix and Pawniard, are KOed or severely damaged by Scald and do not appreciate its 30% chance to burn. Substitute lets Wingull take advantage of the many switches it forces; if Wingull uses Substitute as the opponent sends in a weakened Pokemon as KO fodder, it cannot easily be revenge killed, giving it the chance to freely launch attacks and decimate the opponent's team. Substitute also lets Wingull evade Pawniard's Sucker Punch. Air Slash gives Wingull a more reliable Flying-type STAB attack to consistently KO weakened Pokemon such as Mareanie and Corphish. This is particularly helpful due to Wingull's fragility; if Wingull misses Hurricane, the opposing Pokemon can typically KO Wingull back. Alternatively, U-turn lets Wingull build momentum. After weakening opposing Pokemon with its powerful STAB attacks, it can switch out to a teammate to trap or otherwise take advantage of its switch-ins. Knock Off is an additional option that can cripple walls; after they lose their Berry Juice or Eviolite, they become much worse at switching into Wingull and its teammates. However, Knock Off's low damage output means that if the foe stays in on Knock Off, they will lose their item but almost always withstand it to KO Wingull back. Knock Off can be effective if Wingull forces a switch, but the other moves are generally more consistent. Life Orb significantly boosts Wingull's power, letting it use its good STAB combination and Speed tier to tear through the opponent's team every time it comes in. However, Berry Juice can be used to give Wingull more opportunities to switch in.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature and 236 Speed EVs let Wingull reach 19 Speed, which lets it Speed tie with Jolly Ponyta and Timid Galarian Ponyta and leaves Diglett as the only unboosted Pokemon faster than it. Although Wingull may use some physical attacks, those attacks are used for their utility rather than their power, so a Timid nature is used to avoid reducing Wingull's bulk. The remaining 36 EVs are invested in Defense to help Wingull better survive physical priority attacks such as Timburr's Mach Punch and Pawniard's Sucker Punch. 0 HP IVs drop Wingull's HP to 19, which increases its longevity by making it only lose 1HP from Life Orb recoil. If using Berry Juice, however, Wingull should run the usual 31 HP IVs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to Wingull's poor bulk, it should avoid switching into attacks directly. It is better to bring it in once a teammate has been KOed or through U-turn support from teammates such as Vullaby. Wingull also does not like to take Stealth Rock damage, so keeping entry hazards off the field is very helpful for Wingull. If the opponent does not have any good switch-ins to Wingull, Wingull can use its powerful STAB attacks right away. If there are specially bulky Pokemon that are able to switch into Wingull, however, Wingull should spend the beginning of the game using Knock Off to remove their items or U-turn to gain momentum or pivot into a teammate to trap them. Mid- to late-game, once its switch-ins have been weakened, Wingull should be brought in safely and then spam its powerful STAB attacks to KO anything that switches in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to Wingull's fragility and Life Orb recoil, entry hazard removal is necessary for Wingull to safely switch in multiple times during a match. Thus, Wingull appreciates the hazard control provided by Rapid Spin Drilbur or a Defog user such as Vullaby or Timburr. Wingull's U-turn works excellently alongside trappers such as Diglett and Trapinch, since Wingull can lure in defensive Pokemon such as Chinchou and Mareanie and pivot to a trapper to eliminate them. Wingull also appreciates teammates such as Vullaby, which can use U-turn to help Wingull switch in without taking damage. Since Wingull is often revenge killed by Choice Scarf users, it benefits from bulky teammates that are able to switch into their attacks, such as Onix and Spritzee. Other Water-types, such as Corphish and Krabby, appreciate Wingull's ability to weaken Water-type switch-ins such as Ferroseed, Oddish, and Mareanie with Hurricane and Knock Off.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rain Dance guarantees that Wingull's Hurricane will hit and powers up its Water-type attacks. Wingull would typically prefer to spend a turn attacking than setting up Rain Dance, but the additional power and accuracy can be very useful. Protect lets Wingull scout Choice item users and avoid being revenge killed by Trapinch's First Impression, although Substitute is typically more effective at dealing with these tactics. Roost gives Wingull a solution to its durability problem; however, Wingull already struggles to choose its four moves and would rather spend a turn attacking than healing, so Berry Juice is more effective at keeping it healthy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Wingull is extremely susceptible to chip damage. The combination of Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil can prevent Wingull from being effective beyond KOing one Pokemon, as a weakened Wingull loses to any form of priority. Even resisted attacks such as Timburr's Mach Punch deal 30%, which may KO if Wingull has switched into Stealth Rock and attacked twice.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Although bulky Pokemon such as Mareanie, Spritzee, and Ferroseed take a significant amount of damage from Life Orb Hurricane and do not appreciate having their Eviolite removed, they are able to take any one attack from Wingull even without Eviolite and do enough damage to KO Wingull or prevent it from switching in again.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Vullaby and Galarian Farfetch'd are able to outspeed and OHKO Wingull, although they cannot switch in to Knock Off or Wingull's STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Wingull's Speed advantage is neutralized by priority attacks such as Pawniard's Sucker Punch, which can KO it before it can attack. Wingull can often be revenge killed by weak priority attacks because it is easily worn down.</p> <p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Chinchou is the only Pokemon in LC with a typing that resists both of Wingull's STAB attacks, and its typing and impressive bulk let it reliably switch into Wingull multiple times in a match. Wingull can cripple Chinchou with Knock Off or pivot to a teammate to trap it, but it is unable to defeat Chinchou by itself.</p> "

Trick allows Gardevoir to cripple defensive Steel-types such as Registeel, Steelix, and Stakataka. Healing Wish can be especially useful when paired with a strong, frail wallbreaker or a defensive teammate that lacks a consistent form of recovery. Memento can also be useful to give a teammate such as Barbaracle, Cloyster, or Linoone a setup opportunity. Teleport is also very good when paired with a wallbreaker that threatens Steel-types, as Gardevoir has a tendency to lure them in. Gardevoir can also use Mystical Fire over a utility move in order to hit Metagross, Steelix, and Doublade, but these utility moves give Choice Scarf Gardevoir its niche.

Healing Wish can heal these Pokemon back to full; many teams are not equipped to deal with these dangerous Pokemon getting what is essentially an extra life. These wallbreakers, as well as others such as Heracross and Bewear, all threaten the Steel-types that might prevent Gardevoir from cleaning late-game. Gardevoir can further help these Pokemon out by revenge killing threats to them, such as Zarude, Obstagoon, and Toxtricity. Pivots such as Noivern, Mienshao, Darmanitan, and Zarude can help Gardevoir to get into battle safely. Gardevoir is rather slow for a Choice Scarf user, so it can't revenge kill most other Choice Scarf users in the tier. Having defensive answers to Choice Scarf users such as Heracross, Xurkitree, and Darmanitan is therefore useful. Heracross can be hindered with Flying-types such as Togekiss and Crobat, Xurkitree can be pressured via Ground-types like Steelix and Seismitoad or Electric-types such as Raikou, and Darmanitan is annoyed by Water-types like Suicune, Milotic, Volcanion, and Seismitoad.

Shadow Sneak allows Shedinja to pick off Pokemon like weakened Calyrex-S and other foes that have been heavily chipped, including Zacian-C and Xerneas. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item for Shedinja, since entry hazards are very common, but Safety Goggles protects Shedinja from opposing Tyranitar and lingering sand or hail from Max Moves, allowing Shedinja to be used with Tyranitar on the same team. Shedinja's EVs maximize its Shadow Sneak damage while also outspeeding Chansey and Tyranitar, letting Shedinja pivot into a teammate that can take advantage of them, as well as outspeeding Necrozma-DM if Jolly.</p> <p>Shedinja fits best on bulky and balance teams that appreciate its ability to reliably wall most Xerneas, Zygarde, and Kyogre while potentially luring in and crippling defensive Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, Eternatus, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar. Offensive Pokemon like Groudon, Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, Zekrom, and Kyogre are good teammates, since they appreciate safe entry onto the field from Baton Pass and heavily pressure the aforementioned defensive Pokemon. Groudon and Kyogre can prove especially useful because they remove Tyranitar's sand, allowing Shedinja to switch back in safely. Shedinja also makes Imposter-proofing teams with setup sweepers like Swords Dance Zacian-C and Xerneas a lot more manageable. If Safely Goggles is run, very reliable entry hazard removal from multiple Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Giratina is nigh mandatory given Shedinja's extreme susceptibility to entry hazards, limiting Safety Goggles variants to stall teams.</p> "

These Pokemon include Manaphy, Tapu Lele, Kyurem, non-Flamethrower Calm Mind Clefable, Kartana lacking Knock Off, and Thundurus-T. Toxic and Will-O-Wisp allow Shedinja to capitalize on the switches that it forces by crippling the incoming Pokemon. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical threats immune to Toxic such as Kartana and Mega Scizor. Hex synergizes well with Toxic and Will-O-Wisp; however, Shedinja has a paltry Special Attack stat, so even a boosted Hex will not be dealing too much damage. Protect can be used to scout for super effective coverage, such as Flamethrower on Clefable or Hidden Power Fire on Tapu Lele, as well as prolonging passive damage from Toxic poison and Will-O-Wisp burns. Heavy-Duty Boots stops entry hazards from KOing Shedinja. Minimum bulk investment is so Ditto copying Shedinja has as little bulk as possible, as Shedinja can only take one hit regardless.</p> <p>Due to its relative passivity, Shedinja is restricted to stall teams. It appreciates the entry hazard support from Chansey and Skarmory to wear down its foes faster in conjunction with its own status conditions. Pokemon such as Mega Sableye, Toxapex, Chansey, Clefable, and Alomomola all appreciate Shedinja's ability to switch into and ward off the threatening Manaphy, Tapu Lele, Reuniclus, and Kyurem. Also, since Shedinja is very vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped, its teams must play around opposing Weavile and Tyranitar via double switching. Skarmory, Melmetal, and Alomomola are teammates that can double switch into the aforementioned Pursuit trappers. Tyranitar in particular poses a huge threat, as Shedinja cannot come in while its summoned sand is active. Pokemon that absorb status such as burn and poison are vital, as these conditions will KO Shedinja. Chansey and Gliscor are exampes of solid status absorbers to pair with it. Gliscor is particularly helpful, as it can switch into the dangerous Heatran, which otherwise can switch into Shedinja freely. Gastrodon can help alleviate pressure from Heatran as well.</p> "

Baton Pass allows Shedinja to take advantage of its ability to force switches by slow pivoting out, giving a free switch in to a teammate with a favorable matchup and escaping potential Tyranitar switch-ins that would instantly KO Shedinja with sand damage. Toxic enables Shedinja to cripple most switch-ins such as Yveltal and Primal Groudon. Due to its high PP, Shadow Sneak lets Shedinja whittle down and PP stall Pokemon that choose to stay in against it, such as Substitute Zygarde-C and Xerneas. In addition, Shadow Sneak lets Shedinja pick off weakened Pokemon that could possibly have a tool to OHKO it. Will-O-Wisp allows Shedinja to heavily punish physical switch-ins like Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C. Alternatively, Protect may be run over Will-O-Wisp to scout for potentially harmful moves on Pokemon that Shedinja would otherwise counter, such as Crunch or Assurance on Zacian-C and Toxic on Primal Kyogre. Heavy-Duty Boots allow Shedinja to safely come in on threats throughout the battle regardless of entry hazards. Safety Goggles can also be run, forgoing immunity to hazards for an immunity to sand, which is required if Tyranitar is being used alongside Shedinja. This dramatically reduces Shedinja’s opportunities to come in, however, and necessitates that it is paired with multiple extremely reliable Defoggers, such as Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes with Defog. Shedinja has no other places to usefully invest its EVs, but maximizing its Attack allows it to chip Zygarde-C’s Substitute as much as possible in order to prevent it from PP stalling Shedinja.</p> <p>Shedinja's primary utility is in countering Substitute + Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, which is otherwise extremely difficult to stop owing to its immunity to phazing. Another important feat is stopping Calm Mind + Water Spout Primal Kyogre. Those two capabilities, coupled with its passivity, mean that Shedinja fits best on stall teams, where it can slow pivot away from threatening Pokemon to keep its teammates from having to switch into dangerous attacks. As such, good teammates for Shedinja are stall staples such as Ho-Oh for its ability to spread status, use Defog if Shedinja is running Safety Goggles, and reliably pivot into and scout a vast majority of the metagame for moves that could OHKO Shedinja. Other good stall teammates include Chansey, which consistently checks threatening special attackers such as Xerneas and Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, which reliably stops even Crunch Zacian-C, and defensive Arceus-Ground, which blanket checks dangerous physical attackers such as Primal Groudon and Photon Geyser Necrozma-DM. More niche stall picks can also fit alongside Shedinja, such as Giratina, a phenomenal Defogger if needed, Gliscor, which can trap and remove common defensive Pokemon Shedinja cannot switch into and serve as another Defogger, and Lugia, another check to the metagame's physical attackers that fits well on certain stall teams. Shedinja should be used conservatively, only switching into Pokemon that you have already scouted the sets of and ensured are unable to damage it.</p> "

Therefore, Mega Sableye compromises many common passive Pokemon, such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, Hippowdon, and Mew. Mega Sableye also lends itself as a consistent check and is able to deny Stealth Rock from Magma Storm + Taunt Heatran, which otherwise threatens stall, and is also a Knock Off absorber against the likes of Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Additionally, Mega Sableye's typing and natural bulk allow it to check Mega Medicham, an otherwise major threat to stall teams. Mega Sableye is also very efficient in winning the crucial entry hazard game for its team; common entry hazard setters, apart from Clefable, Mold Breaker Excadrill, and Skill Swap Mew, are unable to freely set entry hazards on teams with Mega Sableye, thanks to the fear of Magic Bounce reflecting the entry hazards back. Protect allows Mega Sableye to safely Mega Evolve in order to immediately gain access to Magic Bounce and accumulate chip damage on the opposing team through status ailments. Protect comes with the added benefit of scouting attacks from common Choice-locked Pokemon, such as Kartana and Tapu Lele. Knock Off provides Mega Sableye with more utility as a means of removing important items, such as Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots, from the opposing team, as well as scouting for potential holders of the Z-Crystal. Will-O-Wisp and Toxic give Mega Sableye additional utility in crippling opposing Pokemon and discouraging switch-ins. Will-O-Wisp comes with the added benefit of crippling dangerous physical attackers, like Garchomp, Kartana, and Bisharp. Toxic allows Mega Sableye to punish defensive Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Hippowdon more harshly and gradually wear down setup sweepers that have recovery, like Mega Latias. The given EV spread allows Mega Sableye to wall Mega Medicham as securely as possible. In addition, it makes Mega Sableye more of a deterrent to Stealth Rock + Swords Dance Garchomp and Landorus-T. A 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD spread with a Careful nature may be used instead in order to check Heatran more reliably.</p> <p>Given its largely passive role, Mega Sableye's use is mostly relegated to stall teams. Chansey is a great teammate for Mega Sableye, as it can deal with strong special wallbreakers that would otherwise threaten stall, like Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Charizard Y. Mega Sableye is unable to manage strong physical wallbreakers, such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Charizard X. Alomomola is able to handle most of these threats, thanks to its physical bulk and favorable defensive typing. Unaware Clefable and Quagsire are excellent counters for the setup sweepers that would give Mega Sableye issues, such as Garchomp, Kisspower Magearna, Tapu Fini, and Gliscor. Chansey and Clefable are also both able to fill the cleric role, which is imperative for stall teams. Zapdos is a capable Defogger teammate and can also handle Kartana and Mega Scizor, both of which give Mega Sableye and its typical teammates trouble. Furthermore, Manaphy is a ginormous threat to unprepared stall teams. As such, the likes of Pyukumuku, Mantine, Gastrodon, and Shedinja can prove to be useful teammates. Mega Sableye also struggles with Fairy-types such as Mega Mawile, Clefable, Magearna, and Tapu Lele. The aforementioned Fairy-types are particularly threatening to stall teams: Mega Mawile's immense innate power makes it a fearsome stallbreaker against every unprepared stall team, Clefable is capable of setting up Stealth Rock against Mega Sableye, and keeping them up against Zapdos if running Calm Mind, Magearna can greatly threaten stall teams with Calm Mind and Pain Split, and Tapu Lele threatens Chansey, the catch-all check to special attackers on stall teams, with Psyshock. As such, strong checks to these threats are very important; examples include Melmetal, Volcarona for the former three threats, and Iron Defense Skarmory for Mega Mawile.</p> "

These factors make it easy for Mega Sableye to be forced out by common offensive Pokemon like Zacian-C and Xerneas, both of which can be stopped by Necrozma-DM, which pairs well with Mega Sableye. Mega Sableye is also easily taken advantage of by support Arceus formes that run Refresh, since Mega Sableye struggles to chip them down. As such, ideal teammates for Mega Sableye are other common stall Pokemon, notably Giratina, for its ability to keep entry hazards off the field against Primal Groudon, which Mega Sableye cannot do, and PP stall Defog from Ho-Oh, giving teams a high level of control over entry hazards. Ho-Oh is also an ideal teammate, providing Defog support and setup-deterring abilities with Whirlwind.

Additionally, Mega Sableye pairs well with Tyranitar and appreciates its ability to deter some support Arceus formes and reliably check Yveltal lacking Focus Blast and Steel Wing. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that Mega Sableye is not chipped too heavily by Tyranitar’s sand. Lugia can also be a good teammate for Mega Sableye thanks to its ability to force out or cripple Mega Rayquaza and Zacian-C.

Mandibuzz and Tyranitar form a powerful defensive core with Mega Sableye. Mandibuzz provides a Ground immunity and Defog support, and it help Mega Sableye check physical setup sweepers with Foul Play. It also walls threats such as Mega Lopunny for Mega Sableye. Tyranitar, on the other hand, is the specially defensive part of the core that also sets Stealth Rock and can cripple threats such as Landorus with Toxic. Its great special bulk lets it take on threats such as Volcarona. Greninja can take on a very wide variety of foes with its powerful coverage and set Toxic Spikes, helping Mega Sableye wear down foes with that much more ease. Zarude can take on Water-type Pokemon that threaten Mega Sableye such as Keldeo and Urshifu-R with a Chople Berry and other threats such as Tapu Fini and Azumarill. Hydreigon can act as a revenge killer with Choice Scarf and take on omni-boosted Kommo-o with Draco Meteor or break through walls such as Mega Venusaur with Choice Specs Draco Meteor.</p> "

Although rare, this can prevent weakened Steelix from getting Stealth Rock up against Torkoal before fainting to Lava Plume.</p> <p>Powerful sun threats are the best partners to take advantage of the support Torkoal provides. Shiftry is a prominent Chlorophyll sweeper that can mow down opposing teams with its boosted Speed and high-powered attacks. Charizard and Darmanitan are powerful Fire-types that become even more challenging to switch into when their STAB moves are backed by sun. Xatu and Klefki are worthwhile support options to ensure entry hazards are not a problem for Torkoal. Both can also manually set sun via Sunny Day in order to relieve some pressure on Torkoal. Heliolisk is a unique sun attacker by virtue of its type and can utilize the sun to slot in Weather Ball to reliably crush Steel-types like Registeel and Steelix. Although rare, Politoed is a rather troublesome opposing weather setter that Torkoal can only threaten with Toxic or repeated use of Body Press. Noivern enjoys having its Flamethrowers boosted by Torkoal's sun, can use Defog to keep the field clear of entry hazards, and reliably check Politoed throughout a game.</p> "

However, due to its slow Speed, Trapinch fears Scald burns and Iron Head flinches far more than Diglett does. First Impression gives Trapinch some extra utility against many faster Pokemon, though many of the move's targets often run Protect for this specific reason. Trapinch will often be at low HP after it has trapped its target, and due to its low Speed, it will likely only attack again with a priority move.</p> ",

An alternative EV spread of 156 HP / 36 Atk / 76 Def / 196 Spe with a Jolly nature is useful, albeit only on Sticky Web teams. The additional Speed alongside Sticky Web enables Trapinch to trap several more Pokemon such as Mareanie and some variants of Chinchou. Rock Slide can threaten Flying-types and prevent Trapinch from giving free turns to some of the more threatening Pokemon in the tier.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>It should be noted that Trapinch cannot be countered directly, as its ability Arena Trap prevents switching out if the Pokemon is grounded. With the ability to pick its matchups, Trapinch often needs to be dealt with after it has picked up a KO. Fortunately, Trapinch will frequently take significant damage in the process, which can leave it vulnerable to almost any strong attacker in the tier.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Staryu and Wingull can punish Trapinch with relatively few downsides.

Giga Drain is primarily for Onix, though it also allows Trapinch to remain healthy enough to potentially trap another Pokemon if needed. First Impression offers some marginal utility to Trapinch once its primary targets have been KOed; it is potentially useful against a foe like Galarian Ponyta or a low health Vullaby after a Defense drop from Weak Armor. Superpower allows Trapinch to greatly damage Ferroseed and OHKO Pawniard. Feint can be used instead for substantially weaker priority that is nonetheless useful for picking off a low health Pokemon; it can be particularly useful against Abra, which will often use Protect to avoid First Impression.

The remaining EVs are tailored to trap and remove Onix as efficiently as possible, with Eviolite bolstering Trapinch's ability to handle Dragon Dance Onix and other powerful physical attackers. A Careful nature is desirable to give Trapinch a better chance to survive a Scald from Mareanie in a pinch, and it will not drop Trapinch's Special Attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is most important to prioritize Trapinch's targets in any given game, and such targets will vary depending on your team's structure regardless of team archetype, with the biggest priorities tending to be Onix and Diglett. Trapinch is a support Pokemon and thus will seek to trap the counters of its teammates. Typically, Trapinch is able to switch directly into what it is meant to remove and can use the appropriate move without issue. In some cases, preserving Trapinch to nail a revenge killer like Abra or Grookey with First Impression later in the game can be particularly useful.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Vullaby and Ponyta love Trapinch's ability to switch into and remove two of their best checks in Pawniard and Onix, and Ponyta also appreciates Trapinch counter trapping Diglett. Spritzee forms a great defensive pairing with Trapinch, as the two can take care of each other's checks. Ferroseed also shares good type synergy with Trapinch, as it acts as a solid answer to Staryu and Grass-types, which prove to be troublesome for teams built around Trapinch.

It also forces damage onto threats that handle Flygon's attacks well, such as Seismitoad, Porygon2, and Dhelmise.

It is also notable for having a decent matchup against spinners such as Hitmontop and Galarian Mr. Mime depending on its coverage. However, Solrock suffers from competition with other Stealth Rock setters such as Mawile and Palpitoad, both of which have a better typing and are easier to fit on teams. Mawile has access to Intimidate and plenty of really good resistances such as Ice, Grass, and Flying while Palpitoad has two great immunities in Electric and Water. Rock Slide gives Solrock a better matchup against common entry hazard removers like Mr. Rime, whereas Zen Headbutt is another option that helps against Fighting-types such as Throh and Falinks. Toxic can be an option over Will-O-Wisp to wear down bulkier Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL and Beheeyem, but in a lot of cases, Solrock needs the opposing Pokemon burned to check it easily. Colbur Berry can be used to check Throh, which it can't cripple with Will-O-Wisp, more easily.

Falinks can offensively check Swords Dance Silvally-Psychic and Ludicolo variants thanks to First Impression. Offensive Grass- and Water-types such as Silvally-Grass and Basculin can easily pressure Solrock, so bulky Grass-types such as Gourgeist and Roselia are recommended teammates for it. Solrock can also switch into Fire- and Flying-types such as Raboot and Vespiquen for Roselia and Gourgeist. Although Solrock has good Defense, its Special Defense is bad, so special walls such as Dusclops and Type: Null work well as teammates, since both of them can switch fairly well into wallbreakers that pressure Solrock like Ludicolo and Glaceon.</p> "

Swords Dance-boosted Aqua Jet lets Corphish net KOs on faster Pokemon like Vullaby after Stealth Rock damage. Knock Off is great for getting rid of Eviolite on switch-ins such as Spritzee and Ferroseed. Swords Dance lets Corphish become a fearsome wallbreaker to take care of walls such as Mareanie and Spritzee. Alternatively, Dragon Dance allows it to outpace Pokemon it could not unboosted, such as Galarian Ponyta, Galarian Farfetch'd, and Vullaby. Superpower can be used over Knock Off in order to OHKO Ferroseed after a Swords Dance.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Adaptability boosts Corphish's STAB attacks, which makes it a powerful attacker right off the bat. An Adamant nature with maximum Attack EVs further helps its wallbreaking abilities. 236 Speed EVs allow it to outpace Pokemon such as Timburr and Frillish.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Corphish can force out Onix and Vullaby, so use Knock Off on incoming foes to remove their items. Use Swords Dance or Dragon Dance on Pokemon it can force out such as Ponyta and Drilbur. Use Corphish mid-game once its checks are weakened to use Swords Dance or Dragon Dance to sweep. Corphish can also be used early-game to remove items with Knock Off from the opposing team, assisting it and its teammates throughout the game. Be careful around special attackers such as Spritzee, Mareanie, and Galarian Ponyta, as Corphish cannot take their attacks well, and Will-O-Wisp users like Frillish and Ponyta, because Corphish cannot OHKO these without setting up with Swords Dance or Dragon Dance and can be crippled for the rest of the game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Onix and Mudbray are able to support Corphish with Stealth Rock to chip Pokemon on the switch and take care of Mareanie and Croagunk. Spikes users such as Ferroseed are great to use to wear down Pokemon and threaten Chinchou. Dewpider is useful for setting up Sticky Web, allowing Corphish to outpace Pokemon it could not before, and also greatly chip down Pokemon like Timburr with a Water Bubble-boosted Scald. Krabby goes well with Corphish to form a wallbreaking duo, as both can help take care of each other's threats. Timburr and Galarian Farfetch'd are great teammates due to their ability to take on Ferroseed and take Knock Off from Pawniard and Ferroseed well. Galarian Farfetch'd appreciates Corphish for being able to check Dragon Dance Onix and cripple Oddish and Mareanie with Knock Off, making it easier for Galarian Farfetch'd to take care of them. Ponyta is a great partner for Corphish, as it is able to take down Grass-types such as Oddish and Ferroseed. Corphish also appreciates Ponyta due to Will-O-Wisp crippling physical attackers such as Galarian Farfetch'd and Vullaby. Vullaby is a great partner to take care of Grass-types that Corphish struggles with such as Oddish and Ferroseed. Diglett is helpful for trapping and OHKOing Chinchou and Croagunk with Earthquake. Pawniard helps Corphish by pressuring Pokemon such as Spritzee as well as Shellder and Galarian Ponyta with Sucker Punch. Spritzee can deal with troubling Fighting-types that threaten an unboosted Corphish such as Timburr and Galarian Farfetch'd, making it easier for Corphish to set up.</p> "

Crabhammer is the strongest Water-type STAB move backed by Adaptability, cleanly OHKOing the likes of physically defensive Hippowdon and 2HKOing physically defensive Mandibuzz and defensive Corviknight. Aqua Jet makes up for Crawdaunt's low Speed and additionally allows it to pick off weakened or frail Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu, Gardevoir, Galarian Darmanitan, and Zeraora.

Waterium Z is the preferred item, as it gives Crawdaunt a one-time nuke on many of its usual switch-ins and almost always KOes a neutral target, while Life Orb is a secondary option to pull off ridiculous feats such as OHKOing physically defensive Tangrowth and Toxapex after a boost.</p> <p>Crawdaunt fits on bulky offense teams that can safely bring it in multiple times throughout the match; it therefore appreciates slow pivoting from the likes of Corviknight, Slowbro, and Slowking. Reliable speed control such as Mega Lopunny complement this further by helping to deal with faster teams, while Crawdaunt shreds through bulkier teams for them.

It has access to Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, making it a solid choice for either a Stealth Rock setter or a defensive spinner, although it cannot threaten most Ghost-types. Its typing and Levitate give it important resistances to Fighting-, Psychic-, and Rock-type moves, letting it pivot into these moves from Pokemon such as Passimian, Mesprit, and Aggron, as well as two important immunities to Electric and Ground; these make it a stop to Volt Switch pivots and Pokemon locked into Earthquake in a pinch, as it fares badly against most of them otherwise. However, Claydol is very passive, heavily relying on Toxic to maintain a presence. It is forced to choose between two STAB moves that are exploitable, meaning it can struggle against foes such as Golbat and Togedemaru depending on the move it chooses. Its typing is also a double-edged sword, with weaknesses to Grass, Dark, Water, and Bug, making it easy to exploit by Pokemon such as Tsareena and Absol, and many of the Pokemon it would like to check can run these moves. Claydol also lacks recovery if it forgoes Leftovers, meaning it can be hard to check what it wants to over a long match.</p> ",

Scorching Sands can be chosen as its STAB move due to its ability to spread burns and hit Dark-types, but it loses to Pokemon such as Golbat and Weezing. Teleport allows Claydol to gain momentum against Pokemon it forces out such as Choice-locked Togedemaru. Alternatively, Protect and Leftovers give Claydol more recovery, increase Toxic damage, and scout opposing Choice-locked Pokemon. However, this gives it a worse matchup against Knock Off users such as Absol and Passimian due to the lack of Colbur Berry. The Speed investment is to guarantee outspeeding fully invested base 80s after a Rapid Spin, such as Gallade and Mesprit, crippling them with a Toxic before they can respond. Claydol likes to have defensive support from Pokemon that can handle special attackers like Rotom, Charizard, and Basculin. Lanturn can take hits from all of them and cripple them with Toxic, and Assault Vest Lanturn specifically can soak up general special hits for Claydol. Ferroseed is another option, functioning as a Toxic sponge that can also check Grass- and Water-types. In return, Claydol can reduce the chip damage Lanturn takes with Rapid Spin and deal with Ground-types such as Sandaconda for both of them. Claydol often best fits on more defensive teams due to its lack of recovery, supportive capabilities, and lacking offensive presence; as such, it appreciates the cleric and Wish support Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Audino can give it.</p> "

It forms a great defensive core with Amoonguss and Ferrothorn, with all covering each others' weaknesses fairly well. However, Cradily's typing leaves it susceptible to threats like Fighting-, Steel-, and Ice-types like Terrakion, Scizor, Galarian Darmanitan, and Glastrier.

Kyurem, in particular, can stall out other Rock-type STAB moves due to Pressure. Toxic allows Cradily to cripple potential switch-ins, bulkier Pokemon like Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, and Porygon2 that can recover off damage from Rock Blast, and setup sweepers like Hydreigon that may try using it as setup bait. Cradily can reliably stall foes with Toxic thanks to Recover. Storm Drain allows Cradily to pivot into Water-type attacks and prevents Scald burns from Pokemon like Toxapex. Maximum Special Defense and HP investment along with a Careful nature gives Cradily the best matchup against special attackers like Volcarona and Kyurem.</p> <p>All of Cradily's teammates appreciate its ability to set up Stealth Rock, which allows sweepers like Rillaboom and Zarude to secure KOs mid- or late-game and hampers threatening Fire- and Flying-types. Rillaboom and Zarude can take care of Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp with their Fighting-type attacks, while Cradily can get rid of threats like Volcarona and Togekiss with Rock Blast. Choice Band Rillaboom can break past defensive cores that threaten Cradily such as Toxapex + Pelipper and Galarian Slowking + Slowbro. Rillaboom also sets Grassy Terrain for Cradily, giving it passive recovery, and is able to get rid of Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Zapdos and Mantine with Knock Off, resulting in Stealth Rock wearing down teams more effectively. Bulk Up Zarude can pressure defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Blissey, which easily wall Cradily or threaten it with Toxic, and KO Psychic- and Ghost-types like Victini and Dragapult. Ferrothorn forms a defensive core with Cradily, setting Spikes and dealing with Ice- and Fairy-types like Alolan Ninetales, Cloyster, and Tapu Lele with Gyro Ball. Its part-Steel typing gives a neutrality against Bug-type attacks and allows it to pivot into Toxic. Ferrothorn also deals with physical attackers like Excadrill for Cradily, while Cradily deals with special attackers like Nidoking in return. Amoonguss absorbs Toxic Spikes that could hinder Cradily's recovery, spreads status ailments with Spore, Stun Spore, and poison from Sludge Bomb, and switches into Fighting-type attacks from Terrakion and Keldeo that could OHKO Cradily. Celebi and Whimsicott can also deal with Fighting-types that threaten Cradily with Psychic and Moonblast, respectively. Whimsicott also helps in the Dark- and Dragon-type matchups, as it can KO Pokemon like Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Dragapult with Moonblast and provides an immunity to Dragon. Rotom-C can get rid of Flying-types like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Taunt Mandibuzz with Thunderbolt, which Cradily fails to do much against, and break through defensive cores that overpower Cradily with Nasty Plot. Choice Scarf Rotom-C can also revenge kill faster Pokemon like Garchomp and Alolan Ninetales and bring Cradily safely into the field with Volt Switch.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Milotic is a solid all-purpose bulky Water-type in the RU tier. This is thanks to a great combination of mixed defenses, good movepool, decent Speed as a defensive Pokemon, and an ability that actually gives it a benefit from being hit by status moves. Flip Turn even allows Milotic to be used on faster-paced teams, as it becomes a bulky Pokemon that can actually build or maintain momentum. Milotic's ability to check powerful threats like Darmanitan, Rhyperior, Noivern, and Metagross is very welcome on many teams. However, Milotic finds itself in a tier where Electric- and Grass-types, such as Raikou, Toxtricity, Zarude, and Roserade, are incredibly potent. While Milotic's ability to take hits of all kinds is relatively uncommon for defensive Pokemon, it does mean that extremely powerful wallbreakers, such as Indeedee and Heracross, can use their powerful STAB moves to brute force their way past Milotic.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Competitive set can be a Defog deterrent on Spikes stacking teams, as the common Defoggers do not generally fare well against a Milotic with boosted Ice Beam. Marvel Scale might make Flame Orb strategies look appealing, but the constant chip damage forces Milotic to use Recover way too often.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: RU is not short on Electric-types, and all of them can simply push past Milotic's defenses with powerful STAB moves. Raikou and Xurkitree aren't scared of Scald nor hindered too badly by a potential Toxic, as they rarely stay in long. Toxtricity is more vulnerable to Flip Turns as it switches in due to its much lower Speed, but similarly threatens out Milotic if it safely switches in and is immune to Toxic. Heliolisk, though much less common than the others, is perhaps the worst enemy of Milotic thanks to Dry Skin even cutting off Milotic's ability to pivot out with Flip Turn as Heliolisk switches in.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Zarude and Roserade might be the only common Grass-types, but they easily handle Milotic. Zarude's Jungle Healing can make Toxic and Scald burns a non-factor for it, while Roserade's Natural Cure and secondary Poison typing work similarly. Both can utilize their powerful Grass-type STAB moves to eliminate Milotic. To make matters worse, Zarude can maintain momentum with U-turn on a forced switch out, while Roserade can litter the field with Spikes to undermine Milotic's bulk later on.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Milotic's good but not spectacular mixed bulk means that very powerful wallbreakers can push past it. Choice Specs Indeedee, Guts Heracross, Obstagoon, and Nasty Plot Togekiss are all strong enough to overcome Milotic with powerful neutral STAB moves, though Milotic can outspeed Dragalge and chip it with Flip Turn on the way out.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Milotic's great typing and mixed defenses allow it to take both physical and special hits quite well. Flip Turn generally is preferred to generate and maintain momentum as a defensive Pokemon, something that is generally uncommon. This is especially helpful on faster-paced teams that would rather have Milotic stay a step ahead of threats like Raikou and Zarude. Ice Beam prevents Grass-types from switching into Milotic as freely, outdamaging Jungle Healing on Zarude and discouraging Roserade from using Spikes. It also OHKOs Noivern. Toxic is able to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Seismitoad, which can help Milotic's more offensive teammates push past them. It also is great for chipping away at common switch-ins like Raikou and Xurkitree. Haze is a great alternative that allows Milotic to stall out Substitute + Protect variants of Suicune lacking Toxic as well as prevent Calm Mind Reuniclus from taking advantage of Milotic's low damage output. On more defensive teams, Haze is a solid option over Flip Turn or Ice Beam, as these teams generally don't care as much about momentum as they do about covering as many offensive threats as possible. Milotic's 48 Speed EVs enable it to outpace Adamant Golurk.</p> <p>As Milotic is a defensive Pokemon that can maintain momentum, it can work on faster-paced teams that appreciate having it as a defensive backbone when they're forced out by certain Pokemon. Durant is a powerful wallbreaker that appreciates Milotic's slow Flip Turn allotting them more opportunities to switch in. Durant enjoys feasting on the likes of Zarude and Roserade. Toxtricity and Raikou are powerful Electric-types that can threaten the majority of the tier and appreciate Milotic being able to bring them in safely. VoltTurn cores with the likes of Cobalion, Zarude, Mienshao, and Raikou are also powerful on more offensive teams that aim to maintain momentum. Roserade is a great check to most Electric-types, can spare Milotic from Toxic from the likes of Porygon2 and bulky Water-types, and litter the field with Spikes to amplify the effects of Flip Turn. In return, Milotic is able to check offensive Steel-types and multiple Fire-types. Porygon2 is another great slow pivot move user on balance teams that can also run Toxic to allow Milotic to more easily use Haze for the likes of Snorlax and Suicune. Registeel, Togekiss, and Galarian Weezing are great options on slower teams. Registeel is able to set up Stealth Rock, check Indeedee and most Electric- and Grass-types, and appreciates Milotic being able to switch into most Fire- and Ground-types looking to take on Registeel. Galarian Weezing and Togekiss are able to take on the likes of Obstagoon, Zarude, and Heracross for Milotic. Galarian Weezing can even set Toxic Spikes so Milotic doesn't have to waste a turn using Toxic, while Togekiss can use Defog to clear the field of entry hazards, which sometimes force Milotic to use Recover more often than it would like.</p> "

Destiny Bond gives Wynaut one last opportunity to KO an unsuspecting revenge killer or pivot.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>76 HP EVs, along with 52 Defense and 52 Special Defense EVs, help Wynaut reach 27 HP / 12 Def / 12 SpD, helping it tank both physical and special hits. 252 EVs in Speed with a Jolly nature allow Wynaut to reach 13 Speed, outspeeding defensive trapping targets such as Shellos, Timburr, Ferroseed, and Foongus. Berry Juice is the preferred item, as it provides Wynaut with a source of recovery to help it better absorb damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Wynaut to trap certain defensive targets, it should not be sent into strong attacking moves, especially Knock Off, to preserve Berry Juice. Instead, Wynaut should enter the battle after a switch from an offensive pivot or as a revenge killer against slow, passive, and bulky walls. It is able to switch in on resisted attacks like Timburr's Drain Punch or on weak offensive moves like Shellos's Scald and use Encore for a more reliable KO with Counter or Mirror Coat. Wynaut can also utilize Encore to lock foes into a setup or non-damaging move in order to safely bring in a check or counter. Likewise, Wynaut can freely revenge kill Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Farfetch'd when they are locked into resisted attacks such as Close Combat.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wynaut appreciates the removal of Pawniard and Vullaby, as both Dark-types threaten Wynaut's effectiveness and ability to switch in. Timburr, Ponyta, and Onix serve as key checks to them. Wynaut is able to complement these checks by removing bulky Water-types like Shellos and Mareanie. Entry hazard setters such as Pawniard, Onix, and Ferroseed benefit from Wynaut's ability to trap Timburr. Setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Vullaby, Agility Porygon, and Shellder relish an opportunity to boost and sweep after the removal of certain walls or by exploiting an Encore-locked foe. Lastly, offensive pivots such as Vullaby and Mienfoo assist Wynaut by providing more scenarios for it to come into play and trap foes.</p> "

Dragon Tail offers good utility and keeps Salamence from being set up on.

It makes for a reliable Stealth Rock setter that doesn't let up on offensive pressure, making it a great pick for more offensive teams. Its resistances and natural bulk let it serve as a very powerful Choice Band user and its Speed is just high enough to make it an effective Choice Scarf user on certain teams. Metagross's lack of reliable recovery means that its good bulk and resistances can only take it so far when it comes to taking hits. Its average Speed leaves it vulnerable to a myriad of offensive Pokemon, including faster wallbreakers like Obstagoon, Heracross, and Darmanitan, once it has picked up a KO.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Agility can allow Metagross to sweep late-game, but such a set can't really be utilized effectively early- or mid-game to capitalize on its bulk and typing to generate pressure. Protect can scout for potential Choice-locked attackers like Darmanitan as well as stall for Toxic damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Outside of Choice Band Zen Headbutt, Seismitoad can handle any attack Metagross uses and retaliate with Knock Off or STAB Earthquake. Milotic and Suicune have ways to stay healthy in order to switch in multiple times. Volcanion 4x resists Steel and can OHKO Metagross with its Fire-type STAB moves, though Earthquake threatens it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Metagross hits incredibly hard, but its base 70 Speed leaves it outpaced by many offensive Pokemon, which not only force it out after it gets a KO but also make it hard for Metagross to get on the field to begin with. Darmanitan, Toxtricity, Chandelure, and Flygon are all faster Pokemon that can threaten with powerful or super effective STAB moves, although none can really switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Steelix has to worry about boosted Earthquake some, but its high Defense lets it take a couple when necessary, and it easily handle Meteor Mash. Flygon and the rare Mudsdale are shakier answers because they don't deal with Meteor Mash as well, but they have much higher Attack stats with which to threaten Metagross with their STAB Earthquake.</p> ",

Earthquake reliably 2HKOes the likes of Incineroar, Registeel, and Stakataka. Toxic is a fantastic last move that allows it to outlast its counters in Milotic, Porygon2, and Umbreon. Grass Knot is a great lure move for Seismitoad should a teammate benefit from its weakening or outright removal. Bullet Punch can pick off weakened foes in a pinch but doesn't offer much else. The EVs are designed to outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Alolan Marowak, with enough Special Defense to avoid being 2HKOed by Togekiss's Flamethrower after Leftovers recovery. 136 Special Defense EVs can be used should your team be particularly weak to Nasty Plot Togekiss. While Leftovers is generally preferred, Shuca Berry allows Metagross to much more easily take on Flygon and Stakataka.</p> <p>Metagross isn't able to effectively threaten bulky Water-types beyond Toxic, so it's very helpful to have teammates that can pressure or remove them. Roserade handles these bulky Water-types as well as Raikou and Xurkitree while forming a powerful entry hazard setting duo with Metagross, as it too doesn't give up offensive pressure to set up Spikes. Toxtricity, Mienshao, Raikou, and Xurkitree are powerful offensive threats that can force out bulky Water-types while bringing Metagross into better matchups through U-turn or Volt Switch. Togekiss can provide Defog or Wish support to let Metagross take hits more freely. Late-game cleaners and powerful wallbreakers that appreciate Metagross's ability to reliably spread Toxic are great options as well. Mienshao and Flygon are useful Choice Scarf users that appreciate Metagross's ability to comfortably take on their Fairy- and Poison-type checks like Togekiss and Crobat.

Zen Headbutt is the preferred last move to 2HKO all bulky Water-types hoping to take one of Metagross's other attacks. Explosion is a fine alternative that allows Metagross to take a huge chunk out of some foe while providing a safe switch in for a frail, offensive teammate once Metagross has no more use.

Sharpedo and Nasty Plot Salazzle are good sweeping options that appreciate Metagross reliably pressuring or outright removing bulky Water-types from the game. Roserade provides Spikes support to aid in wearing down the likes of Steelix and Suicune while also checking Xurkitree and Raikou, which can revenge kill a slightly weakened Metagross once it has KOed some foe. Porygon2 is able to switch into various faster special attackers attempting to revenge kill Metagross, such as Chandelure, Toxtricity, and Xurkitree, and is able to safely bring Metagross into battle with Teleport.

Wish support from Togekiss can be helpful, as Metagross's average Speed will often mean it has to take a hit in order to strike back with a KO.

Ice Punch crucially OHKOes Noivern while being an accurate move to hit Zarude and Roserade with. Rock Slide is an alternative to cover Fire- and Flying-types in one moveslot to ease prediction. Trick cripples walls, such as Suicune, Seismitoad, and Steelix, and can also limit the effectiveness of item-reliant Pokemon like Magnezone and Necrozma.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Metagross should be played as more of a fast wallbreaker rather than a late-game cleaner like other Choice Scarf users, although the boosted Speed can allow it to clean up late-game if the opportunity arises.

Zarude is another option to handle these Pokemon for Metagross, needing prediction to switch into them but helping more with revenge killing. Powerful wallbreakers such as Heracross, Obstagoon, and Toxtricity can wear down or remove most defensive Pokemon and appreciate Metagross's increased Speed to handle naturally faster Pokemon that trouble them, such as Raikou and Noivern. Metagross is slower than other Choice Scarf users, so teammates that can reliably check them can be very helpful. Togekiss and Galarian Weezing can comfortably check Mienshao while using Defog to remove entry hazards that chip away at Metagross. Milotic and Seismitoad can handle Darmanitan, with Milotic helping Metagross switch in with Flip Turn and Seismitoad being able to set up Stealth Rock and spread Toxic to wear down defensive cores. Naturally fast Pokemon, such as Raikou and Noivern as well as the aforementioned Zarude, can also provide extra insurance against Pokemon that Metagross generally doesn't appreciate, such as Cobalion. Should Metagross successfully cripple a wall with Trick, setup sweepers like Shell Smash Cloyster and Swords Dance Mimikyu can capitalize and sweep.</p> "

This is supplemented by its great natural bulk, which allows it to also take powerful neutral hits from the likes of Xurkitree and Toxtricity. Registeel also has Stealth Rock, and its ability to annoy common Defoggers like Togekiss and Crobat makes it a good user of the move. Registeel is unfortunately reliant on its Leftovers to stay healthy, which makes Knock Off incredibly threatening to it. Registeel is also rather passive compared to other Steel-types, as it is much more reliant on the likes of Toxic to make progress than its Steel-type competition of Steelix and Metagross. Annoying weaknesses to Fire-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves leaves Registeel open to common Pokemon such as Chandelure, Darmanitan, and Heracross.</p> ",

Seismic Toss allows Registeel to dole out consistent damage to everything that isn't a Ghost-type, making it less passive overall. Body Press can be used instead, however, as it puts more damage onto certain threats such as Zarude, Cobalion, and Stakataka. Heavy Slam is the preferred last move, as it gives Registeel a decently strong STAB move that hits threats such as Togekiss, Sylveon, and Mimikyu. Protect can be used instead to get more Leftovers recovery and scout Choice-locked moves from the likes of Toxtricity and Darmanitan. Earthquake is a viable option to OHKO Toxtricity and surprise certain Fire-types such as Chandelure and Salazzle.</p> <p>Registeel is a great fit for balance teams, as it provides them with the ever important Stealth Rock while also checking threatening Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Togekiss, Toxtricity, and Choice Specs Sylveon. Fighting-resistant Pokemon are important for Registeel, so adding a partner like Togekiss, Noivern, or Galarian Weezing is recommended. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic can help Registeel check Ground- and Fire-types, while Rock-types such as Rhyperior can also aid in checking Fire-types. Pokemon such as Zarude, Mienshao, and Golisopod appreciate Registeel checking Flying-types such as Togekiss, Noivern, and Crobat. Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Gastrodon appreciate Registeel switching into Zarude and Roserade, and they in return can prevent Registeel from getting worn down by Volt Switch from Toxtricity and Xurkitree. Knock Off absorbers are very important for the Leftovers-reliant Registeel. Options such as Galarian Weezing and Vileplume can switch into Mienshao and Heracross, while Gastrodon can deal with Incineroar and Golisopod. Registeel is also setup bait for bulky Calm Mind users such as Reuniclus and Suicune. Reuniclus can be dealt with via powerful Ghost-types such as Alolan Marowak and Chandelure, while Suicune can collapse under constant pressure from Grass-types like Zarude and Electric-types like Raikou and Toxtricity. Registeel can be supported via Wish users like Sylveon and Umbreon if you are not comfortable with it just relying on Leftovers to stay healthy. Sylveon can also take on the Fighting-types that Registeel dislikes, while Umbreon can aid Registeel against Toxtricity and Chandelure.</p> "

Despite the downside of the Special Attack drop, forcing Latias to switch out more often than not, Draco Meteor acts as Latias's strongest STAB move, allowing it to revenge kill major threats to Psychic-type teams such as Mega Sharpedo and Blacephalon while also aiding greatly in the Dragon-type matchup. Psychic acts as Latias's secondary STAB option, preventing it from being completely shut down by Fairy-types, while also dealing with common Poison- and Fighting-types such as Nidoking, Toxapex, and Terrakion.

Latias in return can revenge kill threats to them such as Mega Lopunny, Tapu Koko, and Blacephalon and also provide Healing Wish support. Victini also appreciates Latias playing the role of Choice Scarf user, which allows Victini to utilize other sets such as Heavy-Duty Boots, Z-Celebrate, and Choice Band.

Slowbro provides a good defensive pivot that sponges physical attacks from Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp directed at Latias, and it can safely bring Latias into the game thanks to Teleport. Slowbro also provides an Ice resistance against opposing Pokemon such as Cloyster and Galarian Darmanitan. Steel-type teammates like Metagross and Jirachi resist common Dragon-, Ice-, and Fairy-type moves directed at Latias while also providing Stealth Rock support, which allows Latias to secure crucial OHKOs, against Pokemon such as Terrakion, Blacephalon, and Mega Sharpedo.

Roar enables Kyogre to take advantage of any entry hazards that may be on the opponent's field while foiling any opposing Calm Mind Kyogre and Geomancy Xerneas that may try set up adjacently. Block lets Kyogre lure in and trap Eternatus, allowing Kyogre to use it as setup bait. A Modest nature can be used on Choice Specs Kyogre to have a better chance of KOing foes, notably offensive Eternatus and Kyurem-W after some chip damage, but is generally worse than Timid because it keeps Kyogre from outspeeding foes like unboosted Xerneas and Rash or Modest Yveltal. Even on Sticky Web teams, Timid Kyogre can always outspeed Jolly Zacian-C and non-Choice Scarf Calyrex-S. Sheer Cold is an option to pressure switch-ins such as Eternatus and Palkia, but it is generally not worthwhile due to its very low accuracy and it being hard to justify forgoing a coverage move for.

Kyurem-W lacking Dragon Tail can still damage Kyogre heavily with Freeze-Dry or even threaten to OHKO Kyogre after accumulating multiple Calm Mind boosts with Sheer Cold.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey's monstrous special bulk paired with a Utility Umbrella allows it to threaten Kyogre. It can wear Kyogre down with Seismic Toss, cripple it with Toxic, weaken it with Confide, or slow pivot out to a teammate with Teleport.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Despite Kyogre's high bulk, revenge killers such as Calyrex-S, Marshadow, Sucker Punch Yveltal, and Zacian-C can all outspeed Kyogre due to its average Speed stat. However, Sticky Web support from Shuckle allows Choice Specs Kyogre to outspeed most of these threats. Ditto can also revenge kill Choice Specs or Choice Scarf Kyogre by using Thunder, but Kyogre's teammates are able to take advantage of Ditto being locked into a single non-STAB move, especially if Ditto's team has already used its Dynamax. Kyogre can also circumvent the aforementioned revenge killers easily through Dynamax's HP boost. Offensive lead variants are able to OHKO Kyogre, while utility ones can also set dual screens to make Kyogre's revenge killing more difficult.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dragon-types: Bulky Dragon-types such as Eternatus, Palkia, and Kyurem-W can reliably check Kyogre due to their bulk and useful typing against it. Offensive Dragon-types such as Life Orb Eternatus, Rayquaza, Palkia, and Kyurem-W can outspeed and force out or KO Kyogre with their STAB moves.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Calm Mind Kyogre's great typing and relatively high natural bulk enable it to freely set up on a wide variety of defensive Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Zygarde-C, Ho-Oh, Lunala, and notably Kyurem-W and Eternatus lacking Dragon Tail, which otherwise check non-Calm Mind Kyogre sets. Scald is preferred as the main attack due to its higher PP and accuracy, and it notably can punish Ferrothorn and Eternatus with a burn. However, Origin Pulse has much higher initial power—OHKOing defensive Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh after a single Calm Mind, helping Kyogre to avoid status. Ice Beam enables Kyogre to cleanly KO Eternatus once set up while also allowing it to serve as a reliable Zygarde-C check. Otherwise, Substitute can be chosen in order to set up on Ferrothorn lacking a Grass-type attack, avoid being phazed by Dragon Tail Eternatus and Kyurem-W, negate status, stall out Sheer Cold from Kyurem-W lacking Freeze-Dry and opposing Kyogre, and be less easily revenge killed by Zacian-C and Zekrom. If using Substitute, Scald is more strongly preferred over Origin Pulse as, after a burn and factoring in miss chances, Ferrothorn's Power Whip only has a 53% chance of breaking Kyogre's Substitute, while Bullet Seed variants fail to do so. Rest enables Kyogre to easily recover from status, making it unable to be harmed easily by common defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Eternatus, while Leftovers reduces its reliance on Rest. The given EV spread maximizes physical bulk, helping shrug off hits from Groudon and Zygarde-C, while enabling Kyogre to outspeed paralyzed Calyrex-S. Under Dynamax, Kyogre becomes incredibly hard to revenge kill, as its bulk reaches colossal levels—easily withstanding a Max Lightning from Zekrom.</p> <p>Calm Mind Kyogre fits on a variety of balance teams, as it absorbs status and checks Zygarde-C, and it threatens to easily sweep teams without Dragon Tail Eternatus, Blissey, Kyurem-W, or Ferrothorn. As such, teammates that are able to punish these foes, such as Zacian-C and Groudon, are appreciated. In return, Kyogre summons rain, weakening Necrozma-DM's recovery so Zacian-C can break through it far more easily, while easily punishing Zygarde-C for Groudon. Dracovish is another powerful teammate, easily capable of overwhelming shared checks, especially if Kyogre runs Thunder Wave in the third moveslot. Additionally, Ferrothorn and Yveltal can use Knock Off to cripple Eternatus and opposing Ferrothorn, making opposing Ferrothorn far easier for Kyogre to defeat when coupled with Scald burns. Yveltal can also switch into Calyrex-S in order to absorb Trick. Gothitelle is a valuable partner, capable of trapping and removing Ferrothorn, Blissey, and non-Dragon Tail Eternatus. Thunder Wave Ho-Oh lures in and cripples Eternatus while preventing opposing Ferrothorn from placing entry hazards. While Kyogre isn't easily revenge killed, once Dynamax has ended, it can be severely damaged by opposing Zekrom and Zacian-C, and so counterplay such as Groudon, Lunala, and Necrozma-DM or revenge killers such as Calyrex-S and Ditto are appreciated. Kyurem-W is capable of sponging Sheer Cold from opposing Kyurem-W and Kyogre.</p> "

Water Spout is Kyogre's most spammable move at full health and can even 2HKO otherwise-reliable checks such as Ferrothorn, Giratina, and Chansey. However, Kyogre should only attempt to 2HKO Ferrothorn on a switch, since it will risk being worn down by Leech Seed or getting heavily damaged by Power Whip. Origin Pulse is run for when Kyogre is weakened but still hits very hard, although it misses out on the aforementioned 2HKOs. Ice Beam hits Giratina, Zekrom, and Rayquaza and OHKOes offensive Eternatus after Stealth Rock damage on the switch. Thunder nails opposing Kyogre, 2HKOes Lapras and offensive Palkia, and forces Ditto to lock into it, while also being consistent under Kyogre's rain. A Timid nature with maximum Speed investment allows Kyogre to outspeed unboosted Xerneas and Rash or Modest Yveltal, outspeed Calyrex-S and Jolly Zacian-C with Sticky Web support, and Speed tie with offensive Groudon. Kyogre is best used as an early-game wallbreaker due to its ability to force out foes like Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, Tyranitar, and Zygarde-C while weakening traditional checks like Blissey and Ferrothorn for its teammates. It's often vital to keep Kyogre as healthy as possible so it can maximize Water Spout's power and spam it against the opposing team.</p> <p>Kyogre's best fit is on hyper offense teams, but it can also find a spot on bulky offense teams. On hyper offense teams, Kyogre greatly appreciates Sticky Web from Shuckle, which allows it to outspeed more threats such as Calyrex-S and Zacian-C. It also likes Excadrill setting Stealth Rock as well as clearing entry hazards with Rapid Spin so Kyogre can stay as healthy as possible. Teammates that can deal with Water-resistant Pokemon like Eternatus, Palkia, Ferrothorn, and Giratina, such as Zacian-C, Xerneas, and Eternatus, are appreciated. Zacian-C and Xerneas benefit from Kyogre's rain, as it weakens Necrozma-DM's Morning Sun, making it a less effective check against the two. Pokemon like Life Orb Yveltal, Calyrex-S, and Groudon appreciate Kyogre pressuring their checks like Tyranitar, Yveltal, and Zygarde-C, respectively. In return, they are able to defeat the aforementioned checks to Kyogre. On bulky offense teams without Sticky Web, Kyogre's teammates must be able to check fast threats. For example, Yveltal can check Calyrex-S, and Necrozma-DM can check Zacian-C. Kyogre also greatly appreciates paralysis support from teammates like Thunder Wave Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Glare Zygarde-C allowing it to outspeed more threats.</p> "

In particular, it OHKOes Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, Zygarde-C, and Arceus-Ground. Most importantly, during Dynamax, its Calm Mind-boosted attacks allow it to overpower conventional Kyogre checks such as Ferrothorn, Primal Groudon, non-Calm Mind Arceus-Water, and Chansey while being extremely difficult to revenge kill, making stopping it once it's set up an arduous task. As a result, bulky builds are immensely pressured by this set. Origin Pulse provides a powerful STAB move capable of OHKOing Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, Tyranitar and Arceus-Ground as well as heavily damaging most potential switch-ins. Under Dynamax, it allows Kyogre to reset rain and overpower common checks in Chansey and Ferrothorn. Ice Beam targets everything that resists Origin Pulse, notably OHKOing Zygarde-C and OHKOing Mega Rayquaza and Eternatus under Dynamax as well as Primal Groudon and Giratina after a Calm Mind. However, it removes rain, making defeating Chansey and Ferrothorn more troublesome, so it should be used carefully. Calm Mind enables Kyogre to 2HKO a large portion of the metagame while making it even harder to revenge kill with special attacks and enables it to break through non Calm Mind Arceus-Water. Hidden Power Flying enables Kyogre to function as a sweeper, as the Speed boosts it gains under Dynamax allow it to outspeed revenge killers such as Mega Rayquaza and Zacian-C. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground allows Kyogre to function as an even more adept wallbreaker, OHKOing specially defensive Primal Groudon. Modest is the preferred nature, enabling Kyogre to break Ferrothorn, Primal Groudon, and Chansey more easily, but Timid allows Kyogre to outspeed Modest Yveltal and Xerneas unboosted and Jolly Zacian-C after one Speed boost. The given EVs maximize Kyogre's Special Attack and Speed.</p> <p>Kyogre is a fantastic wallbreaker when utilizing Dynamax, so it fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, which appreciate its wallbreaking prowess while leaving the ability to Dynamax free for it. It also appreciates Sticky Web support. Calm Mind Arceus-Water is the most ubiquitous defensive Pokemon Kyogre cannot break through. As a result, pairing it with Perish trapping Arceus formes, Chansey, or Ferrothorn as well as Primal Groudon can be beneficial. Ferrothorn, Chansey, and Primal Groudon notably Imposter-proof Kyogre as well to some extent. This Kyogre set lures and breaks through common Kyogre switch-ins such as Primal Groudon, Chansey and Ferrothorn, so teammates that appreciate them being gone such as Calm Mind Arceus-Water and Eternatus are useful. Defensive checks to revenge killers such as Zacian-C, Mega Rayquaza, and Primal Groudon that may defeat Kyogre once its Dynamax has ended, such as Lugia, Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, and Necrozma-DM, are appreciated. While Dynamax should be conserved for Kyogre, there may be instances that it has already been used, in which case Kyogre will be unable to break through its common counters; as a result, teammates such as Zacian-C and Mega Rayquaza that force out Ferrothorn and Chansey while having the ability to wear down or KO a shared counter in Primal Groudon are appreciated. This support can allow Kyogre to make progress even without Dynamax. In return, Kyogre forces out Zygarde-C, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM for Zacian-C while notably reducing Necrozma-DM's recovery due to rain, and it also relatively easily switches into the support Arceus formes that may threaten Mega Rayquaza.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Primal Kyogre is a premier wallbreaker in AG due to a phenomenal Special Attack stat, access to strong STAB moves and colorful coverage, a great ability, and sufficient Speed. Said characteristics give Primal Kyogre a terrifyingly positive matchup against the defensive metagame, allowing it to easily threaten an OHKO on defensive metagame staples such as Necrozma-DM, Zygarde-C, and Ho-Oh. To compound on this, good natural bulk and a great defensive typing also allow it to aggressively switch into common defensive Pokemon such as Arceus-Ground, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh. Origin Pulse provides Primal Kyogre with a strong STAB move to pressure common defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Tyranitar. Ice Beam is mandatory in order to chip down and pressure Primal Groudon in the long run. It is also Primal Kyogre’s best option against Dragon-types such as Eternatus and Mega Rayquaza and another check in Amoonguss. At full health, Water Spout is Primal Kyogre's strongest and most reliable STAB move, providing a guaranteed OHKO on common Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, specially defensive Ho-Oh, Xerneas, and Yveltal, while also heavily pressuring a common Primal Kyogre check in Ferrothorn. Alternatively, Substitute lets Primal Kyogre reliably beat Ferrothorn lacking a Grass-type move, scout for status moves from Pokemon like Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and defensive Primal Kyogre, take advantage of forced switches, and shield itself from revenge killers. In conjunction with Water Spout, Calm Mind allows Primal Kyogre to play a lethal mind game with Ferrothorn, severely punishing it if it tries to regain some health with Protect. Furthermore, Calm Mind also overpowers some of Primal Kyogre's other checks such as Amoonguss and Chansey. Thunder may be run if immediately denting Ditto, Arceus-Water, and opposing Primal Kyogre is desired. However, forgoing Calm Mind leaves Primal Kyogre unable to deal with most of its checks, and the aforementioned Water-types are overwhelmed after a Calm Mind boost regardless. A Timid nature ensures that Primal Kyogre outspeeds neutral-natured Xerneas and Yveltal. Alternatively, a Modest nature may be run in order to overwhelm Ferrothorn and Chansey more reliably.</p> <p>Primal Kyogre fits best on balance and bulky offensive teams, as it prefers being at full health and is quite prone to revenge killers, thus needing proper defensive support. Primal Groudon is the single biggest roadblock to Primal Kyogre's attempts at making progress. Thus, Pokemon that can switch into it and beat it such as defensive Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground, as well as Pokemon that can overwhelm it in the long run such as Zacian-C and Zekrom, are good teammates. Primal Kyogre is heavily threatened by fast physical attackers such as Zacian-C and Mega Rayquaza. Therefore, Pokemon that can reliably combat these such as Necrozma-DM and Zygarde-C are nigh mandatory partners. Zygarde-C can also provide Glare support, allowing Primal Kyogre to outspeed and threaten an increased amount of the metagame. Furthermore, as Primal Kyogre prefers to stay at full health to preserve Water Spout's power and is repeatedly forced out by offensive checks, entry hazard removal from Ho-Oh is recommended. Since Primal Kyogre possesses over immense wallbreaking prowess, late-game cleaners that benefit from this, such as Yveltal, Zacian-C, and Xerneas, are sensible teammates as well. Moreover, these Pokemon innately improve the offense matchup too, which Primal Kyogre struggles against. Entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Necrozma-DM is also recommended, as it severely restricts the amount of times Primal Groudon and opposing Ferrothorn can afford to switch into Primal Kyogre. In return, Primal Kyogre severely threatens Ho-Oh to ensure these entry hazards stay up.</p> "

Water Spout notably always 2HKOes Ferrothorn, even if it uses Protect once. Even if opposing Pokemon resist Water Spout, unless they are Primal Groudon, they will still likely take massive damage. Due to this, many teams are reliant on prediction to minimize losses to this set; with correct prediction, it will break through almost any team. Origin Pulse is for when Kyogre has taken sufficient damage to make it do more damage than Water Spout, but is still very powerful in general, OHKOing non-resistant support Arceus formes after Stealth Rock. This set is capable of breaking through several of the usual Kyogre checks, such as Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Chansey. Choice Specs also enables it to deal heavy damage to Primal Groudon with Ice Beam, making it incapable of switching in with Stealth Rock up. Ice Beam also allows Kyogre to severely damage or outright OHKO common Dragon-types, such as Eternatus, Mega Rayquaza, and Zygarde-C. Thunder enables Kyogre to deal heavy damage to opposing Kyogre and Arceus-Water, although it can usually break through them with Water Spout anyway. A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed Modest Yveltal and Xerneas before they can retaliate or, in Xerneas's case, use Geomancy and Speed tie with opposing Kyogre; however, a Modest nature can be used for the extra firepower, which is situationally helpful to break past Primal Groudon and Chansey more easily. Kyogre is able to utilize Dynamax to break through switch-ins, even if you mispredict and select the wrong coverage move. For example, Kyogre can use Max Hailstorm to break or heavily chip Primal Groudon that switches in on a Water-type move or Max Geyser to break Zacian-C that switches into Ice Beam, although Dynamaxing does remove a significant amount of Kyogre's firepower. Importantly, it also gives Kyogre the bulk to tank their attacks. Dynamaxing should often be used early-game in order to break the opponent's Primal Groudon if it necessary to do so.</p> <p>Ideal teammates for Choice Specs Kyogre are Pokemon such as Arceus-Ground and defensive Zygarde-C that can easily deal with Primal Groudon and help deal with Mega Rayquaza. Zygarde-C in particular is useful for its ability to spread paralysis with Glare, making opposing teams easier prey for Kyogre. Zacian-C is also useful because it can wear down opposing Primal Groudon, which is a shared check between Zacian-C and Kyogre, while also forcing out Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn is also an effective teammate owing to its ability to stack Spikes, making it increasingly difficult for Primal Groudon to switch in. Ferrothorn also has the ability to Imposter proof Kyogre, even if Ditto Dynamaxes.</p> "

Owing to its weaker power, it is less likely to get key KOs, notably missing the OHKO on Zacian-C, but it is still potent.

As this Primal Kyogre set is designed for longer games, Scald is the preferred STAB move of choice, as it has perfect accuracy and more PP than Origin Pulse. It also has a considerable chance to cripple the likes of Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Mega Rayquaza with a burn. Rest provides Primal Kyogre with a source of recovery while also curing status ailments from support Arceus forms, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM, which turns it into an effective status absorber. Sleep Talk is recommended in order to prevent Primal Kyogre being a momentum drain when asleep and to avoid being safe setup fodder for dangerous Pokemon such as Xerneas and Dragon Dance Zygarde-C. As a side note, this is also useful against sleep inducers such as Smeargle and Vivillon. Alternatively, Ice Beam gradually damages Primal Groudon throughout a battle. It also provides a strong hit against Zygarde-C, Mega Rayquaza, and Eternatus. Toxic is recommended in order to put the likes of Xerneas, Yveltal, and Mega Rayquaza on a timer, while greatly pressuring non-Rest Primal Groudon. Alternatively, Calm Mind allows Primal Kyogre to combat Eternatus, Amoonguss, and most Calm Mind Arceus formes in a 1v1 scenario, while also turning it into a potent wincon and making it progressively more difficult to break with special attackers. As Primal Kyogre is a naturally specially bulky Pokemon, a Bold nature in conjunction with fully physically defensive investment greatly improves Primal Kyogre's overall bulk, notably allowing it to take a Choice Band-boosted Dragon Ascent from Mega Rayquaza and two Precipice Blades from uninvested Primal Groudon and more comfortably switch into Brave Bird from Ho-Oh and Thousand Arrows from Zygarde-C.</p> <p>Primal Kyogre fits best on balance and bulky offensive teams seeking a status absorber as well as a way to shut down a majority of the defensive metagame. Primal Groudon, especially with Rest, is the most annoying obstacle for Primal Kyogre, as it can switch into its attacks with impunity and force it out with a strong Precipice Blades. Thus, Pokemon that can check it, such as Arceus-Ground and Zygarde-C, as well as wallbreakers that can overwhelm or take advantage of it, such as Zacian-C, Yveltal, and Mega Rayquaza, are prudent teammates. Primal Kyogre is prone to strong physical attackers such as Mega Rayquaza and Zacian-C. Therefore, physical walls such as Zygarde-C and Necrozma-DM are recommended teammates. Moreover, Necrozma-DM can also check Xerneas, which can otherwise use Primal Kyogre as setup fodder if it lacks Toxic or gets an unfavorable Sleep Talk roll. Setup sweepers, in general, are an annoyance due to the potential free turns they may get against a sleeping Primal Kyogre, so strong anti-setup measures such as Ditto and Haze Zygarde-C fit well. Ferrothorn is especially troublesome to this set, as it can use this Primal Kyogre variant as an opportunity to lay multiple layers of Spikes. For this reason, strong entry hazard control from the likes of Ho-Oh and Mega Diancie, as well as strong means of pressuring Ferrothorn with the likes of Primal Groudon and Eternatus, are good choices as well. Chansey and the aforementioned Mega Diancie are valuable partners that can provide cleric support and deal with dangerous threats like Xerneas and Yveltal, respectively, that may try to take advantage of a sleeping Kyogre.</p> "

Groudon can force out common entry hazard setters such as Necrozma-DM, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn, which is valuable because Shuckle cannot remove opposing entry hazards and Excadrill's Rapid Spin can be blocked by Ghost-types such as Marshadow and Calyrex-S. Zacian-C in particular is a good wallbreaker that can lure in Necrozma-DM and weaken Zygarde-C, and Yveltal can pressure Ghost-types like Lunala, Calyrex-S, and Giratina for Groudon and Excadrill. Teammates like Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM can Imposter-proof Groudon, stalling out Ditto's Dynamax turns to somewhat reliably check it. Ferrothorn can check Choice Scarf Kyogre and provide Spikes support for Groudon on bulky offense teams. Other setup sweepers such as Xerneas, Nasty Plot Calyrex-S, and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM appreciate Groudon KOing walls such as Necrozma-DM, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn for them. In return, they can pressure walls such as Zygarde-C and full health Lunala that Groudon struggles with. To maximize Groudon's sweeping potential, the foe's Dynamax should be wasted by powerful teammates such as Xerneas, Zacian-C, and Kyogre. Groudon should generally be used mid- or late-game once its biggest checks in Zygarde-C and Lunala have been weakened from teammates' offensive pressure.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Primal Groudon is one of the most fearsome offensive threats in AG thanks to its impressive offensive movepool and ability to hit foes incredibly hard both physically and specially while being accompanied by its solid natural bulk, which makes it difficult to revenge kill. Eruption provides Primal Groudon with the ability to break through physically defensive support Arceus formes, notably Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Dark, that would otherwise wall it. Fire Blast can also be used over Eruption for its consistency. This consistency allows Primal Groudon to soft check Zacian-C and Primal Kyogre without having to compromise its wallbreaking prowess. Precipice Blades gives Primal Groudon a tool to do good damage even if it's been chipped enough to reduce Eruption’s power meaningfully, as well as letting it break through specially bulky Pokemon like Chansey, which would otherwise wall it. In addition, Precipice Blades also gives Primal Groudon a way to damage Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Eternatus. Stone Edge is chosen to hit Flying types, such as Ho-Oh and Mega Rayquaza, that would otherwise switch into Primal Groudon with near impunity. Alternatively, Rock Tomb can be used, trading some power for the ability to cripple switch-ins, notably affecting Zacian-C and Mega Rayquaza that attempt to switch into a predicted Stone Edge or Precipice Blades, respectively. Swords Dance allows Primal Groudon to boost past many Pokemon that would otherwise check it, such as Giratina, Zygarde-C, and Arceus-Water, all of which would otherwise be able to whittle down Primal Groudon's health while recovering off its hits. Swords Dance further strengthens Primal Groudon's offensive presence if it's been chipped too much for Eruption to be useful. Hidden Power Ice can alternatively be used for the ability to KO Zygarde after it switches into one of Primal Groudon's other moves and OHKO Rayquaza as it switches in. Either Stealth Rock or Rest can also be used over Swords Dance. Stealth Rock enables Primal Groudon to take advantage of the many switches that it is capable of forcing, while Rest allows it to recover from chip damage and status in order to replenish Eruption's power. A Hasty nature does not lower Primal Groudon's Special Defense, giving it at least some capability to deal with Primal Kyogre and support Arceus formes while still maximizing its speed and power.</p> <p>Primal Groudon fits well on all manner of balanced and offensive teams thanks to its incredible breaking power, defensive utility, and natural bulk. Because it can struggle to break through defensive Pokemon like Arceus-Water, Zygarde-C, and Giratina, Primal Groudon appreciates teammates that are capable of taking advantage of them, such as Xerneas, Eternatus, and Yveltal. Similarly, Pokemon such as Mega Rayquaza, Eternatus, and Zacian-C that can pressure Primal Groudon's checks are good teammates as well. All of them hugely appreciate Primal Groudon's wallbreaking prowess, which facilitates their late-game cleaning. Gothitelle is another good teammate, as it can trap both Arceus-Water and Zygarde-C lacking Dragon Tail. If Rest is used over Swords Dance, Primal Groudon should be used on a bulkier team, preferably one with either Chansey or Diancie to provide cleric support to complement Rest. On more offensive teams, Primal Groudon's relatively slow Speed can become a hindrance, so it fits best with Sticky Web support. If it's used on offense without Sticky Web support, Primal Groudon should opt for Rock Tomb over Stone Edge in order to punish switches by ensuring that it can get another hit off against potential faster switch-ins. Those teams, in return, appreciate Primal Groudon's ability to heavily pressure most common Defoggers, including Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes. Primal Groudon should be used with caution throughout the match, ideally brought in on free turns or predicted switches in order to minimize chip damage and maximize Eruption's power. Owing to Primal Groudon's weakness to chip damage, it pairs well with reliable Defoggers on balance teams, such as Ho-Oh, Giratina, and support Arceus formes. On offense, however, pressure from Primal Groudon's teammates can prevent the foe from setting Stealth Rock at all. Most of the tier's common Stealth Rock users, including Necrozma-DM, Tyranitar, and opposing defensive Primal Groudon, can't switch into Primal Groudon itself, further reducing opportunities for foes to set Stealth Rock.</p> "

          "description": "<p>With a specially defensive set, Primal Groudon notably acts as a great switch-in to Primal Kyogre and a reliable way of wasting Dynamax turns from Xerneas. Stealth Rock is a great move on Primal Groudon, since its bulk and typing give it numerous switch-in opportunities against common Pokemon such as Zacian-C, defensive Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh. Although uninvested, Precipice Blades is a powerful STAB move that 2HKOes Primal Kyogre and non-Dynamaxed Xerneas. Stone Edge is mainly run in order to force Ho-Oh, the best Defogger, out immediately. Overheat severely punishes Yveltal if it tries to switch into Primal Groudon, OHKOing it after little prior chip damage. It also lets Primal Groudon OHKO Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn and force recovery from Arceus-Ground. Rest allows Primal Groudon to wall Ho-Oh, defensive Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Water throughout the entire game by curing it from Toxic poison. It also makes up for Primal Groudon's lack of reliable recovery so it can repeatedly check Primal Kyogre even during longer matches. Toxic is a niche option to cripple offensive checks such as Mega Rayquaza, Yveltal, and Primal Kyogre if they attempt to switch in on an attack or use of Stealth Rock. Roar racks up entry hazard damage and prevents Primal Groudon from being used as setup fodder by Zygarde-C, Mega Rayquaza, Smeargle, Vivillon, and an overly confident Xerneas, but it is hard to justify over other moves. Sleep Talk alongside Rest deters Pokemon like Primal Kyogre, Xerneas, and Mega Gengar from switching in and taking advantage of Primal Groudon while it is asleep, but such a set is completely walled by Flying-types and struggles to set Stealth Rock against Ho-Oh without proper team support. 252 HP and 36 Defense EVs guarantee that Primal Groudon is never 2HKOed by Zacian-C's Close Combat when healthy. The remaining EVs with a Sassy nature are used to maximize its Special Defense without compromising its damage output. If not running Overheat, Primal Groudon should use a Careful nature. A fully physically defensive EV spread with an Impish nature can be used to make Primal Groudon much better against Zacian-C, but this job is done better by Necrozma-DM, since the latter has reliable recovery and Close Combat is still a 3HKO on physically defensive Primal Groudon.</p> <p>Primal Groudon fits best on balance and bulky offense teams in need of a Primal Kyogre check, Stealth Rock setter, and way of wasting Xerneas's Dynamax turns. It is also a good Zacian-C check, since it is able to switch in on all of said foe's moves except Close Combat and Assurance if entry hazards are in effect. Early-game, play aggressively with Primal Groudon since only defensive Zygarde-C and Refresh Arceus formes truly counter it. Use Stealth Rock if there's a good opportunity to, but don't hesitate to use an attack or Toxic instead if you expect your opponent to send out a powerful wallbreaker like Yveltal, Mega Rayquaza, or Primal Kyogre. Even though Primal Groudon resists most of Zacian-C's moves, Close Combat is too powerful for it to handle, so having a teammate like defensive Necrozma-DM or Zygarde-C is a good idea. Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon form a potent defensive core compressing Stealth Rock and Defog that also works well at wasting Dynamax turns from the likes of Xerneas and Yveltal. Furthermore, Primal Groudon can switch into Water- and Electric-type attacks from Pokemon like Primal Kyogre and Zacian-C, while Ho-Oh can switch into support Arceus-Ground. Having your own Primal Groudon check is important too, so take a look at team options such as Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground, both of which also improve the matchup against Mega Rayquaza, one of the most dangerous threats to Primal Groudon. Finally, Ditto can come in after Primal Groudon has been defeated by Zacian-C, Xerneas, or Mega Rayquaza and proceed to reverse sweep. It is a recommended teammate, especially if Primal Groudon is running Rest, because Primal Groudon leaves its team dangerously vulnerable to sweepers when asleep.</p> "

          "description": "<p>This set turns Primal Groudon into both a good Stealth Rock setter and a wallbreaker. Primal Groudon can easily find opportunities to set Stealth Rock up or use Swords Dance against foes it forces out such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM. Swords Dance turns Primal Groudon into a powerful wallbreaker that can surprise and decimate bulkier teams lacking Arceus-Ground. It is especially useful for breaking past defensive Zygarde with some prior chip damage, and it also allows Primal Groudon to beat Defoggers such as Lunala and Arceus-Water. Precipice Blades is its strongest STAB attack and achieves nearly perfect coverage with Rock Tomb or Stone Edge, which targets Flying-types such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal. The EV spread guarantees that Primal Groudon is never 2HKOed by Primal Kyogre's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage and that Zacian-C never 2HKOes Primal Groudon with Close Combat. The Speed investment makes it faster than positive-natured Arceus formes after one use of Rock Tomb, allowing it to set Stealth Rock versus them reliably. Crucially, it also allows Primal Groudon to outspeed defensive Zygarde and Lunala and potentially break past them. The remaining EVs go in Attack with an Adamant nature to increase its wallbreaking capability. An EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature also works very nicely as a surprise factor, since it notably lets Primal Groudon outspeed Yveltal and support Arceus-Ground and Speed tie with Timid Primal Kyogre.</p> <p>Usually, it is best to set Stealth Rock up as soon as possible against offensive teams. Against balance teams that rely on defensive Zygarde-C to check Primal Groudon, weaken it first while taking care not to activate Power Construct, then use Swords Dance to break through it the next time Primal Groudon comes in. Having teammates that can handle Mega Rayquaza is important because it doesn't fear much from Primal Groudon; Zacian-C and Eternatus can check it offensively, while defensive Zygarde-C can paralyze it with Glare or phaze it with Dragon Tail as long as Mega Rayquaza doesn't carry a Dragon-type move. Zygarde-C also helps a lot against opposing Primal Groudon. Having solid counterplay to Arceus-Ground such as Ho-Oh and Ferrothorn is required, too. Since this set fits best on offensive teams that can use Primal Groudon as a Stealth Rock setter and wallbreaker that facilitates sweepers' task, sweepers such as Zacian-C, Xerneas, Yveltal, and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM make for good partners. The former two can also help with checking opposing Yveltal, which can easily use Primal Groudon as an opportunity to switch in and Dynamax. Zacian-C, in particular, greatly appreciates Rock Tomb support, since it prevents Speed-boosting sweepers such as Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza and Ultra Necrozma from becoming faster than Zacian-C while inflicting enough damage to put them in KO range of Behemoth Blade.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Groudon is a threatening setup sweeper in AG thanks to its solid Attack stat and decent natural physical bulk, which can allow it to set up on forced switches against the likes of Necrozma-DM, defensive Primal Groudon, Tyranitar, and Ho-Oh. Precipice Blades is chosen over Earthquake to have a chance to OHKO Arceus-Water and defensive Zygarde after a Swords Dance boost while also breaking Giratina under Dynamax. Stone Edge gives Groudon a vital coverage move, enabling it to OHKO Ho-Oh and Mild Yveltal without a boost and also hit Mega Rayquaza. Notably, after a Swords Dance boost, Stone Edge OHKOes Mild Dynamaxed Yveltal from full, and Max Rockfall OHKOes any Dynamaxed Yveltal. Aerial Ace rounds out the set, as it gives Groudon a way to boost its Speed under Dynamax, allowing it to outspeed almost the entire unboosted metagame after one Max Airstream with a Jolly nature. Life Orb is chosen for its significant damage boost, which allows Groudon to land critical OHKOs on the aforementioned threats after a Swords Dance boost. An Adamant nature ensures these OHKOs, but it is worth noting that a +1 Speed Adamant Groudon cannot outspeed a Jolly Zacian-C. To overcome this issue, a Jolly nature can be used, which allows Groudon to outspeed Xerneas, Yveltal, and Modest Kyogre and Primal Kyogre while still being fairly powerful.</p> <p>Groudon fits best on hyper offense teams, especially those that can provide Sticky Web support to make up for Groudon's average Speed. These teams greatly appreciate Groudon's ability to break through just about every Defogger in the tier, and on them, Groudon often forces the opponent's Dynamax without even needing to Dynamax itself. Groudon greatly appreciates Stealth Rock support, which ensures the OHKO on Arceus-Water and a near-guaranteed one on defensive Zygarde with +2 Precipice Blades, as well as on Yveltal and Primal Kyogre with Stone Edge and Precipice Blades, respectively. Groudon can also fit on balance teams, although its average Speed means that it appreciates paralysis support from Pokemon like defensive Glare Zygarde-C and Thunder Wave Necrozma-DM, both of which can generate more setup turns for Groudon. Wallbreakers that can pressure defensive Zygarde-C and Giratina are important teammates to have on both Sticky Web and balanced teams. Good examples include Swords Dance Arceus formes and Ultra Necrozma on Sticky Web teams, Zacian-C on balance, and Mega Rayquaza on both. Teammates that can outright exploit Zygarde-C and Giratina, such as Yveltal and Xerneas, are equally effective options. If Groudon is used on balance, Perish Song + Whirlpool Arceus-Dark pairs especially well, since it's capable of removing Zygarde-C. Moreover, Arceus-Dark also takes great advantage of Giratina and Lunala, which avoid the OHKO from +2 Precipice Blades and can cripple Groudon with Will-O-Wisp. Since Groudon is weak to Ditto, Zygarde-C can help to Imposter-proof it on balance, while the likes of Mega Rayquaza and Yveltal can provide a Ground immunity on Sticky Web teams. Late-game cleaners that benefit from Groudon's immense wallbreaking capabilities are wise teammates on balance as well, with Zacian-C, Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza, and Calm Mind Arceus formes being good examples.</p> "

Heavy-Duty Boots negates Rayquaza's weakness to Stealth Rock, which puts less pressure on teammates like Excadrill to remove entry hazards for it. The loss of damage output with Life Orb is noticeable, however, as it struggles to OHKO Ho-Oh and defensive Kyogre from full health after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: Bulky walls such as Lunala can take any unboosted hit from Rayquaza thanks to Shadow Shield and retaliate with Ice Beam or cripple it with status. Healthy Zygarde-C can tank almost any hit from Rayquaza and either paralyze it with Glare or phaze it out with Dragon Tail. Outrage can OHKO Zygarde if it's not Dynamaxed, but Rayquaza still must be careful of its immense bulk once Power Construct has been activated. Giratina can weaken Rayquaza with Will-O-Wisp and stall out its low PP moves with Pressure, but it must be wary of Outrage breaking through it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Rayquaza's unimpressive Speed stat leaves it outsped by dedicated revenge killers like Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, Ditto, and Marshadow, which can take it out if it gets weakened. However, Ditto's reliance on Extreme Speed make it vulnerable to potential teammates such as Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, Marshadow, and Calyrex-S.

However, Rayquaza's mediocre bulk and defensive typing give it little setup opportunities, making it generally outclassed by other Dynamax sweepers like Groudon and Xerneas. Swords Dance turns Rayquaza into a deadly wallbreaker capable of OHKOing Ho-Oh, Eternatus, and defensive Xerneas after Stealth Rock damage as well as defensive Kyogre. Dragon Dance can be used instead to be consistently faster without using Max Airstream, especially if another teammate has already used Dynamax. Dragon Ascent turns into Max Airstream during Dynamax, making Rayquaza difficult to revenge kill by raising its Speed by one stage each turn, tearing apart offensive teams. V-Create deals heavy damage to Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Necrozma-DM, and Zacian-C. Extreme Speed is useful for revenge killing weakened threats such as boosted Xerneas, Sucker Punch Yveltal, and opposing Rayquaza. Alternatively, Outrage nails Zygarde-C; being able to outspeed key faster threats is invaluable, though. Life Orb allows Rayquaza to OHKO Ho-Oh and defensive Kyogre from full health after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>Rayquaza fits excellently on hyper offensive teams because entry hazard leads such as Excadrill and Shuckle are able to provide Stealth Rock and Sticky Web, respectively. Other setup sweepers such as Calyrex-S, Zacian-C, and Xerneas are able to overwhelm walls such as Tyranitar and Lunala, giving Rayquaza a safer route to sweep. Rayquaza has a hindering weakness to Stealth Rock, so Rapid Spin Excadrill plays a big role in removing it, while Yveltal deals with most spinblockers. Ghost-types like Marshadow and Calyrex-S are immune to Extreme Speed, which helps against non-Dynamaxed Ditto if it has copied Rayquaza. Rayquaza should usually be used mid- to late-game once all of its checks are removed. It's also recommended to waste the opponent's Dynamax with dangerous wallbreakers like Zacian-C and Calyrex-S before attempting to sweep, since it becomes much harder for foes to take hits from Rayquaza.</p> "

Moreover, its access to potent boosting options in Dragon Dance and Swords Dance further strengthens its wallbreaking prowess. Mega Rayquaza also boasts a solid Speed tier, notably outspeeding huge threats in Yveltal, Xerneas, and Primal Kyogre, which helps it in finding setup opportunities by forcing switches. Dragon Dance turns Mega Rayquaza into a potent wallbreaker as well as a late-game cleaner. Swords Dance may be opted for instead in order to turn Mega Rayquaza into a destructive wallbreaker, allowing it to OHKO the bulkiest of threats such as defensive Zygarde and every support Arceus form, but unlike the Dragon Dance set, it is easily revenge killed by Zacian-C, Eternatus, and other faster threats. Extreme Speed is mandatory, as it allows Mega Rayquaza to finish off a weakened Zacian-C and Eternatus, revenge kill several weakened boosted threats such as Xerneas, Yveltal, and opposing Mega Rayquaza, and ease the matchup against Ditto, since it will be forced to lock into the exploitable Extreme Speed if it wants to revenge kill Mega Rayquaza. V-create allows Mega Rayquaza to always OHKO Necrozma-DM after a boost from either Swords Dance or Dragon Dance, and even KO a Dynamaxed variant after minimal chip with a boost from Swords Dance. Earthquake may be used instead, as after a Swords Dance boost, it KOes Necrozma-DM after minimal chip, OHKOes Tyranitar and Zekrom, and hits Primal Groudon harder without lowering Mega Rayquaza's defenses and Speed. It also allows Mega Rayquaza to defeat Necrozma-DM without inviting Zacian-C in to revenge kill it after a Dragon Dance boost. An Adamant nature in combination with a Life Orb is preferred in order to get crucial OHKOes on the likes of defensive Zygarde and support Arceus formes after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Mega Rayquaza fits best on balanced, bulky offensive, and hyper offensive teams as a dreaded wallbreaker capable of easily blowing up gaping holes or forcing the opponent's Dynamax for a teammate such as Xerneas or Zacian-C to clean up. In balance and bulky offense, Mega Rayquaza appreciates the support from defensive Pokemon that can take its revenge killers on, whereas in hyper offensive builds, it hugely benefits from teammates pressuring shared checks as well as having potential Sticky Web support. When Mega Rayquaza opts to run Dragon Dance, extra wallbreakers to pressure defensive Zygarde-C in particular are recommended in both builds in order to enable Mega Rayquaza's late-game cleanup. In bulky builds, this may include the likes of Play Rough Zacian-C and Swords Dance Primal Groudon, whereas in offensive builds, the likes of Ultra Necrozma and Swords Dance Arceus formes make for good teammates. When running Swords Dance, Mega Rayquaza is a very self-sufficient wallbreaker that doesn't necessarily require wallbreaking support. However, Swords Dance does leave it more prone to revenge killers such as Eternatus, Ultra Necrozma, and its biggest nemesis in Zacian-C, which notably resists Extreme Speed. Thus, Sticky Web support from Smeargle in offensive builds, and Pokemon that can check Zacian-C, Eternatus, and Ultra Necrozma in bulkier builds, such as Necrozma-DM, Tyranitar, and defensive Zygarde-C, respectively, are all sensible choices to pair with Mega Rayquaza. Ho-Oh is a great option that can mitigate Mega Rayquaza's weakness to Stealth Rock by providing Defog support. Both Swords Dance and Dragon Dance variants are prone to getting revenge killed by Ditto. As a result, Pokemon that can reliably pivot into Dragon Ascent in balanced and bulky offensive teams, such as Necrozma-DM and defensive Zygarde-C, are prudent teammates to have. In hyper offensive teams, Pokemon that can directly take advantage of a Ditto locked into Extreme Speed, such as Arceus-Ghost, Ultra Necrozma in either of its base formes, and Zacian-C, are good solutions for Ditto as well. Lastly, as Mega Rayquaza has a tendency to consistently force the opponent's Dynamax, late-game cleaners that benefit from this such as Yveltal, Xerneas, Swords Dance Zacian-C, and Calm Mind Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Water are great options as well.</p> "

Furthermore, this Mega Rayquaza variant is slightly more durable than most other variants due to the lack of Life Orb recoil. A strong Dragon Ascent right off the bat is a major draw of this set, severely limiting usual switch-ins such as support Arceus formes and defensive Lunala by handily 2HKOing them. Extreme Speed provides Mega Rayquaza with a strong priority move that can easily take out weakened threats such as Xerneas, Yveltal, Eternatus, opposing Mega Rayquaza, and Ultra Necrozma. V-create OHKOes Necrozma-DM, a major deterrent in spamming Dragon Ascent. It also boasts the same power as Dragon Ascent, slightly easing prediction against cores such as Necrozma-DM and a support Arceus forme. Earthquake rounds out the set by OHKOing specially defensive Tyranitar while still hitting Necrozma-DM for major damage, easing prediction against this particular core. Outrage may be used instead in order to lure and OHKO defensive Zygarde, while still hitting Tyranitar and support Arceus formes very hard. However, it leaves Mega Rayquaza wide open to Fairy-types such as Zacian-C and Xerneas. Draco Meteor is another option that still OHKOes defensive Zygarde while making Mega Rayquaza less prone to Fairy-types. However, it is relatively weak overall and is therefore an exploitable option to lock into. An Adamant nature is preferred for maximal wallbreaking potential. A Jolly nature may be used instead if outpacing neutral-natured Arceus formes is deemed necessary.</p> <p>Mega Rayquaza fits best as a wallbreaker in balance and bulky offense that can also provide valuable revenge killing utility in Extreme Speed. If forgoing a Dragon-type STAB move, defensive Zygarde-C is a nuisance to Mega Rayquaza, as it can soak up at least a couple of hits throughout a game, thereby limiting Mega Rayquaza's attempts at making progress. Thus, fellow wallbreakers that can pressure or exploit Zygarde-C, such as Yveltal, Play Rough Zacian-C, Primal Kyogre, and Swords Dance Primal Groudon make good teammates. Furthermore, Mega Rayquaza is prone to faster threats such as Zacian-C, Eternatus, and Mega Mewtwo Y. Pokemon that can take these threats on, such as Necrozma-DM, Tyranitar, and Lunala are therefore good teammates. Moreover, Tyranitar can Pursuit trap Mega Gengar, which can otherwise easily trap and dispose of Mega Rayquaza. Ho-Oh is another good teammate for its ability to provide Defog support and pivot into Zacian-C. Late-game cleaners that benefit from Mega Rayquaza's great wallbreaking prowess, such as Zacian-C, Yveltal, and Xerneas, can easily finish off a weakened team once Mega Rayquaza has concluded its wallbreaking. Xerneas and Assurance Zacian-C in particular can weaken or finish Necrozma-DM off in order to allow Mega Rayquaza to spam Dragon Ascent more freely. They also appreciate Mega Rayquaza's tendency to force the opponent's Dynamax, which greatly amplifies their cleaning prowess.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Because of its good Speed and access to U-turn, Jirachi is a good Choice Scarf user on Psychic teams that is able to outspeed and beat Pokemon such as +1 Kyurem-B and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, as well as pivot with U-turn and quickly use Healing Wish to support its teammates. Jirachi's Steel typing is also largely beneficial, allowing it to take resisted attacks like Gardevoir's Moonblast, Cloyster's Icicle Spear and Kyurem-B's Ice Beam rather comfortably. Iron Head is Jirachi's main STAB attack and is useful for hitting Ice-, Rock-, and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Tyranitar, and Mimikyu for super effective damage. On the other hand, while it is not particularly strong, it is able to take down Pokemon Jirachi is not able to OHKO like Avalugg, Tyranitar, Choice Specs Dragapult, Drapion, and Hydreigon with Serene Grace flinches. As a result, Jirachi's Iron Head is very good against weakened teams, being able to take advantage of types like Normal and Dark once its checks and counters are worn down. U-turn allows Jirachi to serve as a pivot, being able to gain momentum for the team by bringing in teammates against Pokemon it struggles to beat such as Ferrothorn, Hippowdon, and Mandibuzz. Trick cripples defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Galarian Corsola by locking them into one move. Healing Wish supports Jirachi's teammates if they ever get worn down, allowing Pokemon such as Mew and Gardevoir to take on matchups such as against Steel and Dark more reliably.</p> <p>Pokemon like Mew, Gardevoir, and Hatterene appreciate Jirachi's Healing Wish to ease tough matchups such as against Steel and Dark. In return, Mew can break down bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Galarian Corsola for Jirachi using its combination of Knock Off, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp. It can also beat Steel-type Pokemon like Bisharp, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn with Nasty Plot in conjunction with Fire Blast. Gardevoir, Indeedee-F, and Celebi are other Healing Wish users that can support Jirachi if it ever gets worn down, so that it can take on matchups such as against Ice and Fairy with more reliability. Using Trace, Choice Scarf Gardevoir can also revenge kill threats such as Seismitoad under rain, Alolan Raichu under Electric Terrain, Excadrill under sand, and Venusaur under sun, which Jirachi cannot. Celebi can beat Ground-type Pokemon like Seismitoad and Hippowdon with Giga Drain, as well as switching into attacks like Excadrill's Earthquake, Keldeo's Scald, and Alolan Raichu's Thunderbolt with its Grass typing. Indeedee-M and Indeedee-F are great partners for Jirachi because of their Ghost immunity as well as their access to Psychic Surge. The latter is especially important, as it stops Mimikyu from using Shadow Sneak against Jirachi, therefore allowing Jirachi to beat it with Iron Head flinches. Both Indeedee forms can also break Pokemon like Toxapex, Aegislash and Hippowdon for Jirachi using its Choice Specs-boosted attacks.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Jirachi has an extensive selection of coverage moves such as Psychic, Thunderbolt, and Moonblast that improves a variety of matchups for Steel such as Fighting, Dark, and Water; this, paired with Calm Mind, allows it to become an effective wallbreaker against teams like Flying, Poison, and Water. Calm Mind is Jirachi's main setup move, which allows it to break through defensive Pokemon such as Mantine, Toxapex, and Corviknight thanks to Jirachi's vast array of coverage moves. Psychic is Jirachi's Psychic-type STAB and is important for Poison- and Fighting-type Pokemon like Toxapex and Conkeldurr, which can be hard for Steel-type teams to handle otherwise. Thunderbolt is useful for damaging Water- and Flying-types such as Mantine and Corviknight with super effective damage. Moonblast damages Dark-type threats such as Hydreigon, Urshifu-S, and Sableye along with Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Kommo-o. Alternatively, Substitute can be used over Moonblast to protect Jirachi from Leech Seed and Scald burns, which allows it to set up in front of more defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex. Energy Ball is also an option to damage Ground-type Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Rhyperior more effectively. The combination of Energy Ball and Thunderbolt can be really threatening to Water teams because it hits Gastrodon, Toxapex, Slowking, Mantine, and Rotom-W super effectively. Maximum Speed investment along with a Timid nature allows Jirachi to outspeed Hydreigon and Kyurem, while maximum Special Attack investment improves its wallbreaking capabilities.</p> <p>Ferrothorn resists Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Kingdra, Seismitoad, and Dracovish, it can also set up entry hazards to damage the opposing team and help Jirachi clean more efficiently. Ferrothorn also has access to Power Whip, which helps beat threats to Jirachi such as Seismitoad and Rhyperior if Jirachi is not running Energy Ball. Furthermore, Leech Seed support from Ferrothorn aids Jirachi in setting up with Calm Mind and extends its longevity. Corviknight and Skarmory can switch into Ground-type attacks from Excadrill and Hippowdon and gain recovery with Roost. Excadrill is nice for beating Pokemon like Skuntank and Drapion with Earthquake, which allows Jirachi to threaten the rest of the team with Psychic. Excadrill is useful for getting rid of entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Aegislash provides Fighting immunity and can utilize a broad array of sets. Swords Dance Aegislash and Bisharp help Jirachi beat Pokemon like Chansey and Ferrothorn, as well as revenge killing threats such as Dragapult, Gengar, and Alolan Raichu with Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, respectively. Choice Scarf Cobalion takes care of Fire-type Pokemon like Volcarona and Charizard with Stone Edge and can spread status with Thunder Wave or use Close Combat, which is nice for Normal- and Dark-type Pokemon like Heliolisk, Diggersby, and Urshifu-S. Lucario is also nice for beating Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon like Zarude and Bisharp with Nasty Plot and Vacuum Wave.</p> "

A specially defensive set with Iron Head / U-turn and two of Stealth Rock / Wish / Protect lets Jirachi act as a solid pivot that can provide Wish and Stealth Rock support while fulfilling an important defensive niche in checking Psychic- and Fairy-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Heatran, Mega Scizor, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn take very little damage from Jirachi’s Iron Head and U-turn. Mega Scizor, Firium Z Heatran, and Ghostium Z Aegislash are particularly dangerous, as they’re immune to Trick, while Ferrothorn can wear down Jirachi with Iron Barbs. However, specially defensive Heatran and Ferrothorn must be wary of Trick, as losing their Leftovers and being Choice-locked does them no favors.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Toxapex and Slowbro don’t mind Iron Head and don’t even need to risk a flinch while healing thanks to Regenerator. In the meantime, both can burn Jirachi, Toxapex can remove its Choice Scarf with Knock Off, and Slowbro can set up Future Sight or Teleport out. Jirachi is able to Trick them, though.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Volcarona, Heatran and Mega Charizard Y easily stomach all of Jirachi’s attacks and hit back with their powerful STAB moves. All three can also avoid Trick provided the former two run a Z-Crystal.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Garchomp, defensive Landorus-T, and Gliscor are capable of switching into Jirachi and eliminating it with STAB Earthquake. The former two can wear down Jirachi with Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet, respectively, while Gliscor easily switches in thanks to Poison Heal and it not caring about Trick after its Toxic Orb has activated. Garchomp and Landorus-T need to be wary of Trick, however.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Most Electric-types easily switch into Jirachi thanks to their Steel resistance, and hit it hard with their STAB moves. Zapdos is especially troubling, as it has the potential to paralyze Jirachi with its ability, ruining its Speed. Magnezone can trap Jirachi locked into Iron Head and remove it with Thunderbolt. Rotom-W despises Trick, but it easily takes Iron Head and cripples Jirachi with Will-O-Wisp.</p> ",

On top of that, Jirachi boasts a good defensive typing and great utility in U-turn, Trick, and Healing Wish. Iron Head is Jirachi’s main tool to revenge kill numerous Pokemon in Tapu Lele, Weavile, and Mega Diancie. In conjunction with Serene Grace, Iron Head can situationally defeat a wide range of additional threats as well, including Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko. As Jirachi’s damage output is mediocre outside of Iron Head, the remaining three moves are dedicated to utility in order to make the best out of Jirachi’s solid defensive typing. U-turn allows Jirachi to capitalize on switch-ins and preserve momentum while letting its offensive teammates in for free. Healing Wish lets Jirachi completely heal a weakened teammate at the cost of sacrificing itself, offering offensive partners a second chance to break open or clean up the opponent’s team. Trick can allow Jirachi to cripple nearly every switch-in to it, as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos don’t like being locked into a move. Serene Grace gives Iron Head a 60% flinch chance, making it quite spammable against Pokemon that don’t resist Steel.</p> <p>Jirachi’s ability to fully heal a teammate is incredible for a number of offensive teammates, such as Mega Mawile, Garchomp, and Swords Dance Kartana. Its ability to cripple Pokemon like Toxapex, Heatran, and Slowbro with Trick and pivot out of them with U-turn is also fantastic for the aforementioned partners. Jirachi can act as a solid check to Fairy- and Psychic-types such as Clefable, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Lele, so Pokemon that may struggle with these threats like Mega Latias, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny make good teammates. As Jirachi lacks the necessary longevity to continuously withstand these Fairy- and Psychic-types, additional soft checks such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight are advisable teammates. Jirachi cannot reliably revenge kill Pokemon like Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Ash-Greninja, so counterplay to these threats like bulky Landorus-T, Corviknight, and Blissey is essential. In addition, all of these Pokemon can form a pivoting core with Jirachi. Jirachi baits in Pokemon that aren’t bothered by its moves and can take advantage of it, like Heatran, Zapdos, and Mega Scizor. Jirachi’s best way of making progress against these Pokemon is either crippling them with Trick or pivoting out of them with U-turn into teammates that can exploit such as Garchomp, Greninja, and Tapu Koko.</p> "

Its Spikes support is greatly appreciated by wallbreakers and setup sweepers, as it helps to wear down their conventional checks. Additionally, Natural Cure Roserade is one of the best switch-ins to bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune, being able to negate Scald burns. However, Roserade's low Defense and average Speed are easily exploited by physical attackers such as Barraskewda, Choice Scarf Mienshao, and Choice Scarf Heracross. While Roserade's main opportunities to switch in are against Pokemon such as Raikou, Xurkitree, and Milotic, these Pokemon can easily pivot out with Volt Switch or Flip Turn. Roserade is also pressured by common Flying-types such as Crobat and Noivern, which KO it with their STAB moves immediately or after a bit of prior damage.</p> ",

Grass Knot is an alternative Grass-type STAB move that provides consistent damage against Pokemon such as Stakataka, Suicune, and Raikou. However, it does not provide recovery like Giga Drain and does not have as much damage potential as Leaf Storm. Shadow Ball hits some of Roserade's conventional checks in Chandelure, Doublade, and Metagross, while Extrasensory hits Poison-types such as Crobat, Dragalge, Salazzle, and Toxtricity. However, they require Roserade to give up an important utility move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Assault Vest Reuniclus: Assault Vest Reuniclus is able to switch into Roserade's attacks with impunity.

Synthesis allows Roserade to more reliably check Raikou and Xurkitree. On the other hand, Sleep Powder is able to net free turns for teammate wallbreakers or setup sweepers. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps entry hazards from pressuring Roserade into repeatedly using Synthesis.

Late-game sweepers such as Sharpedo and Tyrantrum also appreciate Roserade's Spikes support weakening their checks.

Rock- and Steel-types such as Diancie, Stakataka, and Registeel check Flying-types, which threaten to easily KO Roserade and remove Spikes with Defog. Fire-types such as Darmanitan and Entei are a huge nuisance to Roserade, so bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad complement it nicely. Gastrodon's and Seismitoad's ability to check Electric-types alleviates pressure from Roserade and prevents it from getting too worn down throughout the course of the game, especially if it chooses to run Sleep Powder over Synthesis.</p> "

Spikes is a great move to wear down teams to make it easier to clean up late-game for itself or its teammates. Toxic Spikes makes it easier to pressure teams that lack a way to get rid of them like Normal-, Fairy-, and Psychic-type teams. Having Spikes allows Ferrothorn to run Stealth Rock. Roserade should set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes against Pokemon that it can threaten such as Mamoswine, Grimmsnarl, and Togekiss. Maximum Speed EVs with a Choice Scarf and a Timid nature allow Roserade to outpace common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Dracovish and Gardevoir.

Roost gives Vespiquen a reliable recovery option, and allows for more chances to stall moves like Silvally-Psychic's  Multi-Attack with Pressure. Defog and Pressure pair nicely together, as this means you can PP stall Toxic Spikes and Spikes from Mareanie and Roselia for the entirety of the game. Alternatively, Toxic Spikes cripples foes, while Aromatherapy lets Vespiquen function as a cleric. Vespiquen’s Speed alongside U-turn is excellent for slow pivoting, giving you ample opportunities to bring in wallbreakers.

Palpitoad is very notable as a partner; it resists Rock, checks Pawniard, and handles Fire- and Electric-types like Raboot and Manectric, while Vespiquen checks Grass-types in return.

Strong wallbreakers that can break Rock- and Ice-types, like Falinks, Silvally formes, and Stonjourner, appreciate the safety from slow U-turn pivoting; Vespiquen benefits from the removal of such Pokemon, since it makes it much easier for it to use Defog.

It can sometimes function as a wincon, owing to the rarity of strong Grass- and Electric-type moves and its ability to outlast most foes. However, Shellos is also relatively passive and can be smothered by a prepared team, especially ones that spread poison or carry Taunt, and it struggles mightily against the common bulky Grass-types, Foongus and Ferroseed. Shellos's lack of resistances can also lead to it being worn down by the tier's most powerful breakers, like Grookey, Abra, and Reckless Mienfoo. Nonetheless, it is a sturdy Pokemon that can find a home in many defensive cores.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Beam is an option over Clear Smog or Toxic to hit Foongus, but dropping either move sacrifices some defensive capability. Earth Power is an option to hit Mareanie. Mirror Coat lets Shellos surprise and KO special attackers like Porygon, and Counter does the same to physical attackers like Timburr, both owing to Shellos's tremendous bulk and HP and the difficulty of OHKOing it. Shellos can run a variety of boosting moves to more directly serve as a wincon, including a set of Curse, Amnesia, Facade, and Rest; this set needs extensive team support, though, and is unable to beat Taunt users and Ghost-types. An investment of 68 HP / 132 Def / 20 SpD / 244 Spe with a Bold nature can be run with Amnesia and Acid Armor as a wincon that sets up on physical attackers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grookey can break Shellos with its extremely powerful Grassy Glide and Wood Hammer. Foongus can outlast Shellos by healing while hitting it with Giga Drain, in addition to resisting Scald and being immune to Toxic. Foongus also can generate momentum by using Spore. Ferroseed walls Shellos while threatening it with Giga Drain or Bullet Seed, but must be wary of Shellos stalling out Giga Drain PP with Recover. Foongus must be wary of the rare Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Magnemite can KO Shellos with its powerful Thunderbolt or pivot with Volt Switch, though it cannot switch into Scald well.</p> <p><strong>Poison: Poison, especially Toxic, can invalidate Shellos's ability to wall threats. Running Toxic on unusual Pokemon that Shellos likes to come in against, such as Ponyta, Timburr, and Diglett, can surprise and inhibit it.

Recover keeps Shellos healthy enough to deal with multiple foes or outstall Pokemon that cannot break it like physical Vullaby. Clear Smog helps to check Pokemon that would otherwise try to set up on Shellos, like Nasty Plot Vullaby, and can prevent a sweep in motion if Shellos is healthy enough to survive a hit. Toxic lets Shellos outlast most foes and threaten bulky walls like Spritzee and Porygon, spreading chip damage so that a bulkier team can win a longer game.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Eviolite, in tandem with Sticky Hold, makes Shellos incredibly bulky and one of the few Pokemon not threatened by Knock Off. A Bold nature and the given defensive investment give Shellos even Defense and Special Defense to take advantage of Eviolite. Maximum HP investment gives Shellos a sky-high 27 HP and reduces the threat from Final Gambit users like Diglett. The remaining investment in Speed lets Shellos Speed tie with standard Timburr and outspeed standard Spritzee.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Shellos functions as a wet blanket to smother offensive momentum and checks potent threats like Ponyta, Timburr, physical Vullaby, and Dragon Dance Onix. You should prioritize using Recover and keeping Shellos's health high so that it can repeatedly take heavy hits. Against setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Vullaby, maintaining enough health to survive a hit and then use Clear Smog is crucial. Shellos should generally not stay in against Pokemon that can poison it, such as Mareanie. Beware Mold Breaker Pancham, which is the only Pokemon able to remove Shellos's Eviolite with Knock Off.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Shellos fits well on teams that need a blanket answer to physical attackers, especially Ponyta and Ground-types like Onix and Mudbray.

      "overview": "<p>Gastrodon has won its title as one of RU's best blanket checks by solidly handling Raikou, Steel-types, Barraskewda, some other Water-types, and certain Fire-types like Darmanitan and Salazzle as well as by checking various weaker attackers like Noivern in a pinch. Recover gives it a major advantage over fellow Water / Ground type Seismitoad, and Clear Smog can be used to hold off bulky setup sweepers like Reuniclus, which has pretty few surefire answers. Its solid coverage in Earth Power alongside Ice Beam or Scald keeps it from a being particularly easy wall for offensive teams to switch into. However, many of the Pokemon it can switch into run Toxic or Knock Off, so it will often be under pressure from passive damage, especially when used as a blanket check on more offensive teams. It's forced out by the powerful and common Grass-types Celebi and Roserade, which can make progress as Gastrodon switches out by using U-turn or Spikes. Offensive teams looking to end the game sooner rather than later might still prefer Seismitoad as a Water / Ground type, as it checks many of the same Pokemon, is better at pressuring the opponent on its own thanks to Stealth Rock and Knock Off, and does not give foes free turns by using Recover.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Using Sticky Hold as Gastrodon's ability is feasible if you don't expect to face Water-types, or if your team's counterplay to them is very solid overall; it makes Gastrodon a solid Knock Off absorber against weaker users like Incineroar and Salazzle. Protect is difficult to fit but eliminates guessing games against Choice-locked Xurkitree and Toxtricity trying to force Gastrodon out. Curse lets Gastrodon beat Psyshock + Calm Mind Reuniclus and present a late-game threat, but it's vulnerable to faster special attackers, status ailments, and critical hits.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon and Coverage: Grass is naturally the best way to immediately threaten a Water / Ground type like Gastrodon. Roserade, Vileplume, Celebi, Dhelmise, and Virizion are RU's main Grass-types and make various forms of progress as Gastrodon is forced out, though none like switching into Ice Beam and some fear Scald burns. Grass-type coverage on other Pokemon, including Energy Ball Xurkitree and Chandelure, easily takes Gastrodon out.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage and Offensive Pressure: Gastrodon's solid typing and bulk make it difficult for most Pokemon to quickly and safely defeat, but many of the Pokemon it checks can hit it with Toxic on the switch, particularly Raikou. Toxic poison limits how long Gastrodon can stay in, forces it to spend more turns using Recover, and makes it easier for Pokemon to 2HKO with neutral attacks. Using Leftovers or losing Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off causes entry hazard damage to similarly accumulate.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon with Recovery: Toxic Gastrodon is setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus and most Suicune, while Clear Smog Gastrodon cannot pressure other walls like Milotic and Togekiss.

Gastrodon, however, carries a quadruple weakness to Grass, leaving it taken advantage of by Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Zarude in particular is very problematic as Jungle Healing prevents it from being crippled by Toxic or a Scald burn. Gastrodon is also vulnerable to coverage from threats such as Nihilego with Grass Knot and Gyarados with Power Whip. Gastrodon is also rather passive due to its mediocre attacking stats, it relies heavily on status to make progress in games against bulkier teams, and struggles to stop setup sweepers such as Kommo-o and Gyarados.

Ice Beam pressures Salamence while catching Grass-types off guard, but due to Gastrodon's relatively weak attacking power, it is unable to 3HKO Amoonguss or Zarude. Dropping Scald also gives Gastrodon no way to punish Rotom-H. Toxic allows Gastrodon to passively chip bulkier targets such as Rotom-W and Salamence which otherwise don't care too much for Gastrodon's STAB attacks. Clear Smog is useful for stopping setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro, but it makes Gastrodon painfully passive. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Gastrodon to repeatedly switch in without being worn down by hazards, as they remove a large part of Gastrodon's functionality as a defensive Pokemon.

Scrappy gives Mega Lopunny perfect neutral coverage by letting it hit Ghost-types with its STAB moves and lets it ignore Intimidate from Staraptor and Landorus-T.</p> <p>All of Mega Lopunny's teammates benefit from its capability to take on Steel-, Ghost-, and Rock-type Pokemon that are problematic for Normal teams. Blissey is a great partner, as it can absorb status for Mega Lopunny with its Natural Cure, supply Stealth Rock support, and bring it safely onto the field via Teleport. In return, Mega Lopunny shreds the likes of Mega Sableye and Ferrothorn and is able to comfortably switch into undesired Knock Offs for it. Diggersby forms an exceptional offensive core with Mega Lopunny; with its extreme power, it can defeat certain defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Mega Venusaur that stop Mega Lopunny cold. Conversely, Mega Lopunny revenge kills threats faster than Diggersby such as Nidoking and Greninja and can bring it safely onto the field with U-turn. Choice Scarf Ditto is able to outspeed and either beat or force out threats to Mega Lopunny like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Altaria. Defensive Staraptor shrugs off physical Fighting-type attacks directed at Mega Lopunny such as Choice Scarf Terrakion's Close Combat, blows away entry hazards with Defog, and has U-turn to form a pivoting core with it. Similarly, Porygon2's sheer bulk enables it to comfortably tank attacks from revenge killers like Choice Scarf Excadrill and safely Teleport out, getting Mega Lopunny into battle unscathed as a result. With its Ghost-type Z-Conversion set, Porygon-Z can eliminate Psychic-types like Celebi and physical walls like Skarmory for Mega Lopunny.</p> "

Power-Up Punch boosts Mega Lopunny's already high Attack stat to astronomical levels while not being stopped by Taunt. Encore is a very useful tool to lock slower Pokemon like Jirachi and Mantine into support or recovery moves, giving Mega Lopunny free setup opportunities with Power-Up Punch or valuable momentum for the team. Return is Mega Lopunny's most reliable STAB move and its main way to dish out damage; after a boost, it can 2HKO most physical walls that don't resist it, such as Zapdos and Clefable, as well as OHKO frailer Pokemon like Nidoking and Volcarona. Close Combat complements Mega Lopunny's perfect coverage, nailing bulky Steel- and Rock-types that resist Return, such as Aegislash and Cradily, as well as Dark-types like Hydreigon. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature make Mega Lopunny as powerful and fast as possible. Limber is Lopunny's pre-Mega ability, which grants it a useful paralysis immunity before it Mega Evolves. Scrappy gives Mega Lopunny perfect STAB neutral coverage while also enabling it to break through Intimidate Pokemon like Staraptor and Landorus-T by ignoring its effect.</p> <p>Balanced Normal teams greatly appreciate the role compression this Mega Lopunny set provides by being a very effective hole puncher and revenge killer in one slot. Because of this, Z-Conversion Porygon-Z stands out as its best offensive partner, as they form an offensive core capable of covering most matchups. Porygon-Z fondly benefits from Mega Lopunny removing Dark-types and specially defensive Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Gastrodon. In return, Porygon-Z defeats bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types like Jirachi and Galarian Corsola as well as physical walls such as Celesteela and Mega Venusaur. Blissey is a great partner as well, since it can absorb troublesome status conditions with its Natural Cure, set up Stealth Rock so Mega Lopunny can score crucial KOs, and safely bring it onto the field with Teleport. Ditto is able to pick off faster Pokemon that threaten to revenge kill Mega Lopunny, such as Excadrill under sand and Zeraora. Defensive Staraptor switches into physical Fighting-types like Choice Scarf Buzzwole and Infernape, keeps entry hazards off the field with Defog, and can safely get Mega Lopunny in with its U-turn, allowing Mega Lopunny to enter the battlefield unscathed. Porygon2's insane bulk makes it a great switch-in to priority moves such as Mamoswine's Ice Shard and Dragonite's Extreme Speed and opposing revenge killers like Choice Scarf Greninja that can pick off a weakened Mega Lopunny. It can shrug off these assaults and Teleport out, reliably bringing Mega Lopunny back in.</p> "

Poison Jab does a fantastic job of handling Grass-types such as Appletun and the aforementioned Psychic-types. Sucker Punch is used to punish Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Dragapult, Jirachi, and Alolan Raichu. However, it must be used with caution in the Psychic matchup, as Jirachi's common teammate Indeedee-M blocks Skuntank from using Sucker Punch with Psychic Terrain. Defog gets rid of entry hazards while freeing Galarian Weezing from running it and removing Electric Terrain and Psychic Terrain. Protect is used to scout for moves from Choice-locked Pokemon such as Jirachi and Excadrill while also providing an additional turn of Black Sludge recovery. Aftermath is picked to punish foes that heavily depend on contact moves, such as Dracovish, Bisharp, Jirachi, and Weavile, and common U-turn users such as Dragapult and Celebi.</p> <p>Galarian Weezing is a good partner with its ability Levitate, allowing it to be immune to Ground-type attacks from foes such as non-Mold Breaker Excadrill, Seismitoad, and Hippowdon. Galarian Weezing also provides Will-O-Wisp support, which can be used to cripple physically offensive Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Weavile. In return, Skuntank frees Galarian Weezing from running Defog, which creates space for coverage options such as Flamethrower and Fire Blast. Vileplume forms a solid defensive core with Skuntank with its physical bulk and Strength Sap. Moreover, with its Ground neutrality, Vileplume provides a switch-in to Mold Breaker Excadrill by always taking two unboosted attacks, and with Skuntank's Defog, Vileplume switches into Excadrill even more safely. Toxapex is a fantastic defensive pivot for many offensive Pokemon such as non-Taunt Keldeo, Dracovish, and Mimikyu. Between Toxic, Baneful Bunker, and Toxic Spikes, Toxapex comes with great potential to spread poison, which can be further exploited with Skuntank's Protect. Salazzle benefits well from Skuntank, as Skuntank can Defog entry hazards for Salazzle. This allows Salazzle to use the combination of Substitute + Toxic relatively safely and to threaten Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Aegislash with its Flamethrower. Furthermore, Salazzle can take out Choice Scarf Excadrill if it's behind Substitute. In return, Salazzle takes advantage of defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Mandibuzz, which Skuntank struggles against. Skuntank also helps with Toxic damage accumulation with its Protect. With its good coverage, Gengar takes out Pokemon that have the potential to exploit Skuntank, such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. In return, Skuntank can switch into Ghost-type attacks for Gengar. Drapion can be used as a fast teammate to take out other Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Gardevoir. Furthermore, its Knock Off can remove items from foes such as Galarian Corsola, Corviknight, and Toxapex.</p> "

It also makes a solid check to common metagame threats like Sylveon, Rotom-C, and Dragalge. Thanks to Bronzong being immune to Spikes and poison, it is also very difficult to wear down with passive damage over the course of a game. Unfortunately, Bronzong's additional weaknesses to Dark and Ghost sometimes make it hard to justify over Copperajah, another Steel-type Stealth Rock user with a stronger offensive presence. Because of these weaknesses and Bronzong's passivity, it often invites in threats that quickly force it out such as Golurk. It also lacks any form of reliable recovery and therefore is very susceptible to item removal from the likes of Corrosive Gas Vileplume and Trick Celebi.</p> ",

Bronzong can also use an itemless set to better check Poltergeist users like Decidueye, Dhelmise, and Golurk, but the lack of Leftovers recovery will be very noticeable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types and Ghost-types: Drapion, Zoroark, and Guzzlord all heavily threaten Bronzong if they can get in on it without being hit by Body Press with their STAB Dark-type attacks.

Although Psychic is usually run to hit Poison-types like Salazzle, Dragalge, and Vileplume, Protect synergizes amazingly with Toxic and Leftovers. Bronzong uses maximum physical defense to boost Body Press and stand up to physical threats better, as it already walls the majority of special attackers in the metagame. Bronzong can also consider a Steel-type move to better deal with Fairy-types like Diancie and Sylveon and Earthquake to retain coverage for Copperajah while hitting Salazzle and Heatproof Bronzong harder. Levitate is usually used so Bronzong can switch into foes like Mudsdale more safely, but Heatproof is great on teams that already have multiple other Ground-immune Pokemon and lets Bronzong better handle Fire-types like Salazzle and Talonflame as well as Pokemon with Fire-type coverage like Copperajah and Exploud.</p> <p>Any Ground-weak Pokemon, such as Arcanine, Salazzle, and Dragalge, will appreciate Bronzong's natural Ground immunity, particularly keeping them safe from Rhydon and Mudsdale.

Sylveon is an excellent partner for Bronzong, being able to switch into strong Dark-type attacks and provide Wish support to keep Bronzong healthy. Vileplume is another great defensive partner, being able to switch into certain physical attackers Bronzong struggles to deal with, such as Guzzlord, and threaten them back with Strength Sap or Corrosive Gas. Of course, Bronzong also appreciates being paired with strong wallbreakers such as Sirfetch'd and Tyrantrum to make up for its minimal offensive presence.

          "description": "<p>Tank Garchomp is one of the best Stealth Rock setters in the tier because of its ability to keep entry hazards up and pressure conventional Defoggers like Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Tornadus-T with Toxic. It can take advantage of its typing and the combination of Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin to punish users of contact moves like U-turn and many physical attackers like Melmetal, Kartana, and Hawlucha. Rest gives added longevity and removes status caused by Pokemon Garchomp switches into, including Heatran and Zapdos. Protect is useful to scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Band Rillaboom, and it is especially useful on Leftovers sets for better recovery every other turn. Flamethrower is an option to pressure Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which would otherwise be free to set up their own entry hazards or remove Garchomp's Stealth Rock. It can also help Garchomp check offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana that take little damage from Earthquake. 120 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature let Garchomp outspeed maximum Speed Nidoking, most defensive Landorus-T, and maximum Speed Heatran.</p> <p>Physically defensive Garchomp provides entry hazard support that Pokemon like Kartana and Rillaboom benefit from. They can use Knock Off to help Garchomp pressure Flying-type Defoggers such as Zapdos and Mandibuzz that check them and appreciate Garchomp's pressure on other checks like Tangrowth. However, Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain weakening Earthquake usually warrants a replacement STAB move in either Stomping Tantrum or Scorching Sands. Garchomp's strain on Defoggers can help other dedicated entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Tapu Koko is also a good partner due to its pressure on Flying-types—especially Corviknight and Skarmory—that can free up Garchomp's fourth moveslot, and it benefits from Garchomp's pressure on Tangrowth, Landorus-T, and Galarian Slowking through Toxic and Earthquake. Garchomp's immense pressure on Heatran and Galarian Slowking, specifically, can also make special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Calm Mind Clefable ideal teammates.</p> "

Due to its stellar bulk and good defensive ability in Rough Skin, Garchomp can also run a defensive Stealth Rock set with a Rocky Helmet in tandem with Rough Skin to rack up chip damage against opposing physical attackers, However, this set is outclassed in this role by Rocky Helmet Landorus-T and is unsuitable for checking anything in the long run. Garchomp can also run a mixed Life Orb set with Draco Meteor or Fire Blast to bait in and punish physical walls that would usually give Garchomp problems, though Garchomp’s poor Special Attack makes the set difficult to pull off consistently, and this set is also outclassed by its Mega Evolution.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Pokemon that have good physical bulk and don't take super effective damage from any of Garchomps common moves like Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Hippowdon can survive any unboosted hit from Garchomp and force it out with status or super effective coverage moves. Pokemon with Unaware such as Clefable and Quagsire can also completely stop Garchomp from wallbreaking.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Naturally fast Pokemon or Choice Scarf users like Greninja, Tapu Koko, Landorus-T, Weavile, and Ice Beam Latias can revenge kill Garchomp. Priority users like Rillaboom, Mega Medicham, and Mega Scizor can also knock out a weakened Garchomp but they don't enjoy the chip from Rough Skin.</p> <p><strong>Status: Garchomp absolutely hates status conditions, as all of them severely cripple its wallbreaking capabilities and defensive utility. Scald burns from Slowbro, Slowking or Gastrodonseriously limit its wallbreaking potential, while Toxic poisoning from Clefable, Blissey, or Gliscor will seriously dent its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory and Corviknight: Garchomp cannot reliably break either Skarmory or Corviknight without Continental Crush.

It also has some solid defensive utility with its typing, letting it provide an Electric immunity and check common Pokemon like Heatran and non-Hidden Power Zapdos. Swords Dance allows Garchomp to beat a lot of common Defoggers like Zapdos, Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, allowing it to easily keep Stealth Rock up. Rockium Z with Stone Edge gives Garchomp a strong Rock-type move to beat Defoggers like Zapdos and Corviknight. Alternatively, Dragonium Z with Outrage allows Garchomp to deliver a harder hit on physically defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and Slowbro, and it can also catch a Mega Latias expecting a Stone Edge off guard. However, having a much worse matchup against Corviknight and Skarmory and the lack of a spammable STAB move once Devastating Drake has been used, make Dragonium Z an inferior option overall. Rough Skin is the preferred ability on most sets, as it punishes physical attackers like Mega Scizor, Rillaboom, Mega Medicham, and Hawlucha.</p> <p>Due to its role as both a wallbreaker and Stealth Rock setter, Garchomp fits best on offensive teams, where it can be paired up with teammates that enjoy its ability to break down or threaten out bulkier Pokemon like Toxapex, Zapdos, and Blissey. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, Mega Lopunny, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham make for stellar teammates, as they benefit from its ability to break down defensive foes like Zapdos, Slowbro, and Corviknight. The former three can also bring Garchomp in safely on defensive Pokemon, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock or use Swords Dance easily. Garchomp is very easily forced out by faster offensive Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja, Weavile, Kartana, and Tapu Koko, so Pokemon that can deal with them, like Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Gastrodon make for solid teammates. Tapu Fini is an especially good partner for non-Outrage sets, as Misty Terrain can let Garchomp freely switch into bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Slowking without fearing a Scald burn. Due to it beating many of the common Defoggers in the tier, Garchomp pairs well with Spikes users like Ash-Greninja and Ferrothorn, as it can threaten opposing Defoggers and keep Spikes on the field. It also has some very good defensive utility, being able to check Pokemon like Heatran, Zapdos, Volcarona, and Victini.</p> "

Meteor Mash is to help net KOs against slower Fairy-type Pokemon such as Togekiss and Clefable. Extreme Speed is used to be able to hit Pokemon like Salazzle and Dracovish. Lucario should try to set up on a predicted switch, on a passive Pokemon, or on a Pokemon it threatens out. Running an Adamant nature allows Lucario to take care of most Fairy-types after one Swords Dance, while running a Jolly nature with maximum Speed EVs allows Lucario to outpace Togekiss and Kommo-o.</p> <p>All Fighting-type Pokemon love Lucario for its Steel typing allowing it to threaten Fairy-types like Gardevoir and Togekiss. Cobalion is a much needed teammate to set down Stealth Rock, cripple Pokemon like Choice Scarf Gardevoir with Thunder Wave, and Taunt opposing leads such as Galarian Corsola. Terrakion is a great Choice Scarf user due to it outpacing Choice Scarf Excadrill and Gardevoir and being able to take on Fire-types like Charizard and Chandelure. Keldeo is also very helpful for Lucario due to it taking down Ground- and Fire-type Pokemon like Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Charizard while also stopping Toxapex using Recover, Haze or Toxic Spikes thanks to Taunt. Scrafty is needed, as it provides a useful Psychic immunity to the team, uses its ability Shed Skin to soak status for its teammates, which helps Lucario with not being burned, and takes on Ghost-type Pokemon such as Aegislash and Sableye for the team. Kommo-o is a great teammate for Lucario due to its Dragon typing, allowing it to threaten Dragon-types such as Dracozolt. Toxicroak forms a core with Lucario that can break through Fairy-types help greatly in the matchup thanks to its Poison typing.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Hippowdon's great bulk, solid defensive typing, and reliable recovery allow it to check prominent offensive threats such as Dragapult, Heatran, and Excadrill. Hippowdon is one of the defining components of sand balance teams due to Sand Stream and provides further support by setting up Stealth Rock and checking key threats like Dragapult and Tapu Koko. However, Hippowdon's susceptibility to being pivoted against by these Pokemon makes it easy to wear down and forces it to switch out. It also faces stiff competition as a defensive Ground-type from Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Swampert, and Gastrodon; however, Hippowdon manages to offset this due to reliable recovery in Slack Off and access to Stealth Rock. Additionally, as Hippowdon is a passive Stealth Rock setter, it is difficult to keep its entry hazards on the field against common entry hazard removers such as Corviknight, since it can only use Whirlwind or Toxic to dissuade them. Hippowdon is also vulnerable to entry hazards and status, which make it much harder to remain healthy while checking offensive threats.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sand Force can be run instead of Sand Stream to prevent sand damage from being detrimental to Hippowdon's teammates and ensure they gain recovery from Leftovers. A physically defensive set can be used instead of the specially defensive variant to check prominent physical threats such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Melmetal. This physical set can often run Rocky Helmet to chip physical attackers and pivots such as Melmetal and Tapu Koko, although Hippowdon should be wary of Toxic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Corviknight and Skarmory: Hippowdon hates facing Corviknight and Skarmory due to its inability to do anything against them, especially if Hippowdon is not carrying Whirlwind. Skarmory can then use Hippowdon to set up Spikes, while Corviknight can remove entry hazards with Defog. At best, Hippowdon can use Whirlwind against them or Earthquake as they heal with Roost, but it fails to sufficiently weaken them.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Hippowdon is easily worn down by status and entry hazards, which prevent it from checking Pokemon as effectively as it would like.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Kyurem and Weavile threaten Hippowdon with their powerful Ice-type STAB moves, although they cannot come in on a potential Earthquake or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, and Kartana wall Hippowdon and force it out, as they easily tank Earthquake and shrug off its coverage moves. Ferrothorn can take advantage of Hippowdon to set up Spikes, while Rillaboom and Kartana can pressure Hippowdon with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Slowking threaten Hippowdon with Scald and apply pressure with Future Sight, while Tapu Fini does not fear Earthquake, prevents status with Misty Terrain, and can remove Stealth Rock if it chooses to run Defog.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Hippowdon functions as a sturdy check to special attackers such as Dragapult, Tapu Koko, and Volcarona and provides helpful utility with Toxic and Stealth Rock to support its teammates. Toxic allows Hippowdon to punish non-Poison-immune Flying-types that attempt to remove its entry hazards, such as Zapdos and Mandibuzz, and other vulnerable walls such as Tangrowth, Slowking, and Swampert. Whirlwind is also a viable option, allowing Hippowdon to phaze foes it cannot do much against, such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. Whirlwind can also be used to prevent Hippowdon from being used as setup fodder by setup sweepers like Clefable and Volcarona. Leftovers provides Hippowdon with passive recovery and helps alleviate pressure from offensive threats by letting it waste less turns healing with Slack Off. 8 Attack EVs ensure Hippowdon OHKOes Excadrill with Earthquake. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents residual damage from Spikes and Toxic Spikes, although the passive recovery from Leftovers is in most cases too good to pass up.</p> <p>Hippowdon's Electric immunity and access to reliable recovery give it defensive synergy with partners on more defensive teams and pivots such as Toxapex and Clefable; it helps the team from being overwhelmed by Electric-types such as Zeraora and Tapu Koko. Pressure users such as Corviknight and Moltres are great partners alongside Hippowdon, as they can wear down the PP of Defog and make it much easier for Hippowdon’s Stealth Rock to stay up long-term - they can also provide entry hazard removal so that Hippowdon doesn’t get worn down by entry hazards. Sand Rush Excadrill can utilize Hippowdon's sand to clean late-game after a Swords Dance while also providing entry hazard removal. Knock Off and status absorbers like Clefable and Reuniclus are useful if Hippowdon is being utilized on defensive teams, as they provide the team with much more longevity in the long term. Bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Tapu Fini are greatly appreciated; Toxapex can handle Weavile and Toxic Melmetal, while Tapu Fini can prevent status from crippling Hippowdon, although this also prevents Hippowdon from using Toxic against grounded Pokemon.</p> "

Knock Off is able to cripple usual switch-ins and deals more damage against Doublade and Dragalge, but does sacrifice a potentially useful tool against offense in Sucker Punch, which prevents Pokemon like Salazzle and Starmie from revenge killing Toxicroak.</p> <p>Toxicroak's ability to threaten certain cores and prevent Milotic and Suicune from making any progress is a great asset, but against more offensive teams, it struggles to find matchups where it can reliably threaten the opposition. Teammates like Noivern and Xurkitree can help against threats like Salazzle and Crobat, and they can also bait in Pokemon Toxicroak does well against, like Sylveon and Roserade. Alolan Marowak prevents Raikou and Xurkitree from freely using Volt Switch against Toxicroak and appreciates Toxicroak dealing with Milotic and Suicune. Both can also weaken Gastrodon and Seismitoad for each other. Toxicroak's dislike for early-game matchups against bulky Pokemon like Seismitoad, Metagross, and Steelix can be shored up with wallbreakers like Necrozma and Toxic Volcanion. While Toxicroak does well against Zarude and Roserade, it's advisable to carry additional checks like Crobat and Durant, as Toxicroak is liable to being overwhelmed by itself from repeated hits and Life Orb recoil.</p> "

Foul Play does far more damage to boosted threats such as Gyarados, Mimikyu, and Drednaw allowing Weavile to revenge kill them.

Grimmsnarl also benefits from Weavile being able to get rid of Bisharp and Aegislash for it, which would otherwise impede a sweep. Hydreigon appreciates Choice Scarf Weavile's presence, as it can get rid of the faster Dragon-type Pokemon such as Dragapult and Noivern that can OHKO Hydreigon.

Additionally, Alolan Ninetales deals with Fighting- and Dark-type Pokemon like Keldeo and Grimmsnarl with Moonblast. Galarian Darmanitan deals with Steel-type Pokemon like Corviknight due to its Flare Blitz, and it also forms a great revenge killing core with Weavile that is hard for offensive teams to deal with. Using a Choice Specs set, Kyurem can break apart bulky defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, Gastrodon, and Corviknight for Weavile. Stealth Rock users like Piloswine and Mamoswine also pair well with Weavile, allowing it to score easier KOs against Pokemon like Darmanitan and Salazzle.

Weavile is also one of the few Pursuit trappers in the National Dex tier, and it sets itself apart from Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar due to its heightened Speed, allowing Weavile to fit on teams that are much more offensive than the bulky offense teams that Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar are found on. Triple Axel threatens to OHKO common offensive Pokemon like Kartana, Mega Latias, and Mega Charizard Y. Knock Off helps Weavile cripple its defensive answers such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Tapu Fini while hitting offensive Pokemon like Mega Medicham and Aegislash rather hard. Additionally, Pursuit allows Weavile to trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon like Mega Latias, Reuniclus, and Gengar. Offensive Pokemon that Weavile forces out are also good Pursuit targets, such as Mega Medicham, Serperior, and Mega Charizard Y.

Pokemon that can pivot into these threats like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clefable fit well alongside Weavile. Also, Weavile's susceptibility to Stealth Rock necessitates Defog support from the likes of Corviknight and Zapdos. Corviknight is especially noteworthy because it invites in Garchomp and offensive Landorus-T in order to pivot out with U-turn into Weavile. Additionally, Mega Scizor and Toxapex counter Weavile, so Pokemon that threaten them such as Taunt Heatran and Mega Medicham make for excellent partners. Heatran and Toxapex are especially good partners because they appreciate Weavile's ability to Pursuit trap Mega Latios and Mega Latias and threaten Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T with Triple Axel.</p> "

This support greatly enables many of the strongest sweepers and wallbreakers in the tier, such as Garchomp and Rillaboom. Its coverage is limited but effective, with different options to trap additional foes. However, Magnezone is held back offensively due to its low base Speed, leaving it revenge killed by the many faster Pokemon with super effective coverage. Its lack of longevity is also fairly limiting, denying it a defensive niche despite its great defensive typing. Further, Magnezone can't trap all relevant Steel-types with one set, forcing it to pick certain targets to trap.</p> ",

Its reliance on Electric Terrain makes it somewhat inconsistent, but the reward is worthwhile. Rising Voltage's power also lets Magnezone run Choice Scarf over Choice Specs, but Choice Scarf sets still lose a lot of wallbreaking power overall and can't outspeed Pokemon such as Dragapult, Zeraora, and Tornadus-T. Choice Specs Magnezone can potentially run Analytic as its ability for extreme power, but sacrificing Magnet Pull and Magnezone's primary niche is not recommended. Teleport is another option on the Choice Specs set to pivot on Pokemon immune to Volt Switch. This comes at the cost of a key coverage move, though, and Flash Cannon already heavily dents some Ground-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Magnezone's 4x weakness to Ground and lack of coverage, especially on the Body Press set, make it very hard to break past and avoid revenge killing from Ground-types. Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill all greatly threaten Magnezone with their STAB moves, but they don't appreciate switching into Choice Specs Magnezone's Flash Cannon, which lessens their pressure a little bit. Swampert and Gastrodon resist both of its STAB types, making them some of the hardest Ground-types to break immediately.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: With such a low base Speed, middling special bulk, and weaknesses to common attacking types, Magnezone is fairly easy to revenge kill with Pokemon such as Dragapult, Volcarona, and Kartana, or any super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Galarian Slowking is one of the best walls to Magnezone, as its high Special Defense, resistance to Body Press, and strong Fire-type coverage allow it to pivot into and take on most Magnezone sets. Blissey and Ferrothorn wall the Choice Specs set but fear the Iron Defense set, meaning they have to scout it first.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu are very sturdy walls against the Iron Defense set and deal decent damage back, but they are extremely vulnerable to a Choice Specs-boosted Flash Cannon. Ferrothorn, on the other hand, is great against the Choice Specs set but falls easily to the Iron Defense set.</p> ",

Iron Defense Magnezone will typically have a hard time breaking through Pokemon that aren't Steel-types due to the lack of offensive investment, meaning it needs strong defensive pivots to help when it gets in a bad position. Teammates like Rotom-W and Slowking can pivot into strong Fire-type attacks from Pokemon like Heatran and Galarian Slowking, while Ground-type answers such as Corviknight and Landorus-T can cover Magnezone against attackers like Garchomp and opposing Landorus-T.

Its decently powerful STAB moves combined with Choice Specs and a Modest nature make it very hard to wall, as Electric-type answers without reliable recovery such as Landorus-T and Garchomp cannot switch into Flash Cannon reliably. Volt Switch is an incredible tool for Magnezone, allowing it to pivot around special walls such as Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Ferrothorn to bring in stronger wallbreakers against them and chip them for itself later. Its Volt Switch is also very spammable because Flash Cannon deters Ground-types from switching in. Toxic is an unfavorable move to be locked into but is a great midground option against potential switch-ins like specially defensive Hippowdon and Swampert. Body Press lets Magnezone pick off Ferrothorn and Blissey after they've been chipped, and Steel Beam is a very high-risk, high-reward option that can even take down tanks such as Blissey and Galarian Slowking after they've been chipped. Magnezone is fine sacrificing itself with recoil after doing its trapping job.

Metal Sound helps beat stall Pokemon like Type: Null and defensive Rotom-W, whilst Mirror Coat is an option to beat some special attackers Magnezone would otherwise be unable to deal with, such as opposing Choice Specs Magnezone. Magnezone's defensive investment allows it to live two Outrages from Choice Band Unnerve Haxorus and Surging Strikes from Choice Band Adamant Urshifu-R, and its Speed investment allows it to outspeed Wacan Berry Urshifu-R and Choice Band Urshifu-S after an Electroweb, alongside Speed tying other base 60 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>While Magnezone beats most Water-types, Primarina can live a Thunderbolt and beat Magnezone with Torrent-boosted Sparkling Aria into Aqua Jet. So, Magnezone should use Electroweb on Turn 1 to avoid putting Primarina into Torrent range, and only then use Thunderbolt on Turn 2 for the KO. Assault Vest variants will unfortunately be able to beat Magnezone, so avoid this matchup. Against Urshifu-R, use Electroweb Turn 1, in order to beat both the common Choice Band variant and the viable Wacan Berry set, followed up by Thunderbolt. Be aware that the rare Choice Scarf Urshifu-R will require a Turn 1 Thunderbolt and will beat Magnezone if it uses Electroweb instead. While the Choice Band Rillaboom matchup seems cut and dry, Rillaboom can usually beat Magnezone without activating Weakness Policy by simply using Wood Hammer. Your opponent will have to misplay and assume a Choice Specs set. To prepare for this, always use Electroweb on the off chance that they do mispredict and use Superpower or High Horsepower. Magnezone struggles against Dragon-types such as Curse Dragapult, Mold Breaker Haxorus, Choice Scarf Dracovish, and Kommo-o. Because of this, Fairy-type partners such as Primarina and Sylveon are appreciated. They in turn enjoy Magnezone's support to deal with physical breakers such as Galarian Darmanitan and Crustle.

The Choice Scarf also lets Magnezone be played more offensively and act as a revenge killer against foes that would normally outspeed it, such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Manaphy. However, due to Magnezone's poor Speed, Choice Scarf Magnezone cannot be a team's general answer to fast threats, still only being as fast as Serperior. Also, Choice Scarf Magnezone lacks the power to wallbreak effectively, most notably being stalled out by Leech Seed + Protect Ferrothorn if Magnezone is hit by Leech Seed on the switch. Though the removal of Kartana can be very valuable to some teams, Kartana's middling speed is much easier to exploit with more conventional fast threats such as Mega Lopunny and Ash-Greninja. Steel Beam can also be run over Flash Cannon on the Choice Specs set in order to nuke Ground-types that would otherwise switch into Flash Cannon more than once. However, the lack of a spammable Steel-type STAB move hurts against Calm Mind Clefable, and the recoil of Steel Beam is also undesirable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type coverage: The likes of Heatran and Mega Charizard Y are offensive Pokemon that can both OHKO Magnezone or use it to set up and threaten teammates. Heatran is also a defensive answer to Magnezone that can easily tank any attack from it. However, Heatran dislikes being forced to take a Gigavolt Havoc from Electrium Z Magnezone. Also, Mega Charizard Y cannot switch in, as it fears Magnezone's Electric-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-type Pokemon such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Gastrodon are immune to Thunderbolt and Volt Switch. Not being able to pivot out with Volt Switch can drain the momentum of your team rather quickly as well. Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill are all able to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Magnezone and OHKO it with Earthquake. However, most Ground-types, with the exception of Gastrodon and Excadrill, cannot reliably stomach a Corkscrew Crash and are generally poor switch-ins to Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type coverage: Fighting-types that can outspeed and OHKO Magnezone such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, and Mega Heracross pose a major threat. Strong Fighting-type coverage can deal sizable damage to Magnezone as well, such as Sacred Sword from Kartana. It should be noted, however, that these Fighting-types are usually revenge killing Magnezone, as none of them want to stomach a hit from it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey: Chansey and Blissey take minimal damage from any of Magnezone's attacks due to their incredible special bulk, easily using it to set up Stealth Rock or regain momentum via Teleport.</p> ",

Volt Switch maintains momentum versus Pokemon Magnezone matches up poorly against, such as Blissey, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss. It also allows Magnezone to keep momentum as it finishes off some targets, such as Corviknight. Volt Switch should also be used to exploit Toxapex and Clefable for momentum, as they are heavily threatened by Magnezone's STAB moves and often switch out.

These Pokemon also take advantage of Heatran, which Magnezone cannot beat. Gliscor is a particularly excellent partner, as it baits in Corviknight for Magnezone to trap. Also, it has a good matchup against defensive Ground-types, such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Slowbro and Toxapex not only address Magnezone's high vulnerability to fast, strong offensive Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham, but also benefit from it trapping Ferrothorn. Magnezone is also vulnerable to Ground-type Pokemon when locked into Thunderbolt or Volt Switch, so sturdy Ground-resistant or immune teammates such as Tangrowth, Gliscor, and Landorus-T are good to have.

Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current SS RU metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Togekiss's typing, reliable recovery, and infamous ability to flinch through checks with Serene Grace Air Slash let it thrive as a wallbreaker. Its bulk and typing allow it to comfortably check threats like Noivern throughout a game, and its recovery helps it outlast its offensive checks, most commonly Electric-types. Various move choices give Togekiss answers to some of its usual counterplay, such as Flamethrower for Steel-types. However, common Electric-types like Raikou, Xurkitree, and Toxtricity mean that most teams will have a way to handle Togekiss's Air Slash. Reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots means that Togekiss greatly dislikes taking Knock Off, making matchups against Seismitoad, Incineroar, and Golisopod less favorable than they would appear. This susceptibility to Knock Off contributes to Togekiss not being a sufficient Fighting-type check, as even Mienshao and Choice Scarf Heracross carry Knock Off and Rock-type moves.</p> ",

Air Slash in tandem with Serene Grace is useful for breaking foes such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight with flinches, especially after they are crippled with Thunder Wave. Nasty Plot lets Togekiss muscle past bulkier Pokemon and status inducers such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Seismitoad more easily. Togekiss should generally look for safe situations where it can spread paralysis, weaken the opposing team, and set up without much drawback. Despite being bulky, it should look out for certain wallbreakers such as Choice Band Weavile and Choice Scarf Dracovish that threaten to OHKO it without letting it get a chance to cripple them.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Charizard is a good partner for Togekiss, as it can break Steel-type Pokemon such as Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight Togekiss may have trouble with.

Xatu provides Light Screen and Reflect to make setting up easy as well as the ability to keep Stealth Rock off of the field with Magic Bounce, which makes it an ideal teammate for Togekiss. Having Reflect and Light Screen up helps Togekiss especially against the aforementioned wallbreakers, which now struggle to beat it.

Nasty Plot is the primary tool for that purpose, allowing Togekiss to handle slow defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Galarian Corsola, and Mandibuzz much more consistently and easily. Air Slash is Togekiss's only way of attacking, allowing Togekiss to potentially beat the aforementioned defensive Pokemon. Roost helps Togekiss remain healthy through the match, allowing it to sustain Stealth Rock damage and attacks from specially offensive Pokemon such as Hatterene and Dragapult. Substitute allows Togekiss to safely setup Nasty Plot on defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, that can otherwise status it with Toxic. Thunder Wave allows Togekiss to cripple Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Duraludon, Drapion, Gengar, and Jirachi on the switch, as well as other fast Pokemon such as Dragapult, Charizard, and Hydreigon. Serene Grace complements Air Slash as it doubles the flinch chance, making Togekiss much more dangerous to face in conjunction with Nasty Plot and Thunder Wave. Togekiss should seek setup opportunities against defensive Pokemon that can't ditch out significant amounts of damage, such as Toxapex, Galarian Corsola, Clefable, and Mandibuzz. Togekiss should be wary of status effects such as poison and paralysis from foes such as Toxapex, defensive Seismitoad, and Celebi, though Togekiss can comfortably take on these Pokemon after one Nasty Plot.</p> <p>Ribombee is one of Togekiss's best teammates, as it can provide Sticky Web support. Thanks to it, Togekiss's good Speed tier is enhanced even further, allowing Togekiss to outspeed foes such as Mimikyu and Salazzle. Furthermore, Ribombee's Stun Spore allows it to paralyze fast Ground-types such as Excadrill on the switch, which greatly helps Togekiss. Mimikyu is another decent partner that forms a solid offensive core with Togekiss, taking out problematic Ghost-types that pose a threat to Togekiss, such as Aegislash and Gengar, thanks to its Ghost typing and ability in Disguise. In return, Togekiss beats bulky Pokemon that Mimikyu struggles against, such as Snorlax, Toxapex, and Avalugg. Clefable provides Stealth Rock for Togekiss, thus allowing Togekiss to break types such as Ice and Fire more consistently. Clefable can opt for utility options such as Thunder Wave and Knock Off, which can be used to cripple foes even further. Furthermore, offensive Clefable variants form offensive cores with Togekiss, and Clefable's access to Flamethrower lets it handle certain Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. Hatterene can be used to take out Poison-types that pose a threat to Togekiss, most notably Salazzle. Furthermore, the combination of Trick Room and Mystical Fire allows Hatterene to handle Steel-types, most notably Excadrill, and take out Choice Scarf Duraludon. Its access to Magic Bounce allows Hatterene to bounce back Stealth Rock for Togekiss as well as status conditions such as Toxic and Thunder Wave. Gardevoir is another good offensive partner that can take out the aforementioned Poison-types. Furthermore, Gardevoir can chip down Steel-type foes with Focus Blast and heal Togekiss with Healing Wish if necessary. With Trace, Gardevoir also acts as a solid wincon against teams that rely on weather sweepers by copying their ability, such as rain Water and sun Grass.

Maranga Berry allows it to more reliably wall many special attackers such as Primarina, Necrozma, and Sylveon. Thunder Wave is useful for speed control in addition to making immobilizing foes more reliable. Roost paired with paralysis allows Togekiss to fish for paralysis turns while recovering, which increases reliability even more. Encore is useful for locking stall Pokemon such as Stored Power Necrozma and stall Clefable into their setup moves, as well as bulky offensive setup Pokemon like Galarian Moltres, Primarina, and Fake Tears Sylveon by locking them into their status moves.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>The EVs allow Togekiss to survive Choice Specs Necrozma's Prismatic Laser and outspeed base 60 Speed foes such as Primarina and Sylveon. 72 Defense EVs maximize reliability against Assault Vest Arcanine.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Most matchups with Maranga Berry Togekiss begin with Togekiss using Thunder Wave Turn 1. However, against certain Trick users such as Cresselia and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, it is safest to use Encore Turn 1. This locks you into Encore again but nets you a free move Turn 3 to use Air Slash, which locks you into Air Slash for the final turn of Encore on Turn 4, resetting the cycle. If the foe uses an attacking move Turn 1 and deals less than half of Togekiss's health, it is generally safe to spam Roost and fish for paralysis turns before going for flinches with Air Slash. This keeps Togekiss from dropping to a stray critical hit as well as not risking being caught by priority or some other gimmick such as a surprise Custap Berry user. If the foe uses a setup or status move such as Calm Mind, Swords Dance, or Substitute, Togekiss should usually use Encore to lock them into their move so they can safely break them down without needing to deal with flinch and paralysis chances as long as Togekiss outspeeds. Where Togekiss shouldn't use Encore is against Pokemon like Aromatisse.

          "description": "<p>Choice Specs Glaceon is one of PU's scariest wallbreakers, capable of putting immense pressure on even some of the tier's best special walls in Throh and Type: Null as a result of its sheer power. Freeze-Dry allows Glaceon to threaten Ice-resistant Water-types like Pyukumuku and Corsola, and it's also Glaceon's best option against Lapras. Shadow Ball allows Glaceon to OHKO Galarian Mr. Mime and threaten specially defensive Mr. Rime. It also hits Klang and opposing Glaceon harder than any other move Glaceon can viably run. Water Pulse targets Carkol, though it doesn't have much use outside of that. Frost Breath can allow Glaceon to get past bulky Calm Mind and Cosmic Power users like Musharna and Gothitelle in a pinch, but the move is virtually useless outside of this one purpose and cuts into Glaceon's already limited coverage. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Falinks and Choice Band Fraxure as well as Speed tie with offensive Roselia. Glaceon could opt to use Choice Scarf to act as a revenge killer rather than a wallbreaker. Although this allows Glaceon to take care of +1 Adamant Fraxure and circumvent typical offensive checks like Silvally-Grass and Raichu, such a set severely reduces Glaceon's power and faces serious competition from Mr. Rime and Galarian Mr. Mime due to their higher Speed tiers, better coverage, and access to Healing Wish.</p> <p>Glaceon's low Speed and poor defensive typing make it very easy to offensively pressure, so it appreciates having bulky teammates to fall back on in the face of faster Fire-, Fighting-, and Rock-types. Vibrava gives Glaceon an easier time switching in by removing entry hazards with Defog and generating momentum with U-turn. It's worth noting that a lot of Pokemon that Vibrava baits in and pivots out against, like Gloom and Togetic, find themselves easily exploited by Glaceon. Mareanie absorbs Toxic Spikes upon switching in, can wear teams down with its own Toxic Spikes, and also softens up bulky foes that depend on their item, like Type: Null and Lapras, with Knock Off. Although Glaceon is strong, it lacks the coverage to bypass dedicated Ice-type answers such as Munchlax and Klang. Wallbreakers like Mawile, Hitmontop, and Flame Orb Throh help to remedy this issue, and they appreciate Glaceon taking on physical walls like Mareanie, Shiinotic, and Gourgeist-XL. Mawile also provides Stealth Rock support to put further pressure on teams, while Hitmontop removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Glaceon has an easier time breaking through teams with Spikes support, essentially 2HKOing Type: Null after Stealth Rock and three layers of Spikes. Roselia is a great Spikes setter, capable of incapacitating foes like Klang with Sleep Powder and making them easier for Glaceon to overwhelm. Pivots like Manectric and Silvally-Bug can give Glaceon more opportunities to switch in, with both examples doubling as late-game sweepers that can exploit the holes that Glaceon leaves in teams earlier on. These pivots can annoy Pokemon like Lapras and Pawniard, while Glaceon can threaten Palpitoad and Carkol.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Because of its decent bulk and near-unique access to both Wish and Heal Bell, Glaceon can serve as a cleric for balance teams. Freeze-Dry is used instead of Ice Beam to hit foes like Lapras and Seaking harder. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Glaceon from being worn down by entry hazards, which allows it to more easily switch around and better preserve the health of it and its teammates. This immunity to entry hazards, alongside Glaceon's higher Special Attack and natural defenses, helps to separate it from Togetic, another cleric that similarly has access to Wish and Heal Bell. Although Glaceon has higher Defense than Special Defense, its poor defensive typing is easily exploited by many of the tier's physical attackers, including Mawile, Falinks, and Silvally-Rock. There are fewer specially offensive Pokemon that can do the same, and opting for a specially defensive set provides defensive teams with a secondary check to threats like Ludicolo and opposing Glaceon.</p> <p>Stunfisk and physically defensive Mawile appreciate having their lack of reliable recovery mitigated by Wish support, and in return, they can absorb Knock Off and check threats that Glaceon is vulnerable to, such as Pawniard and Stonjourner. Pyukumuku can also absorb Knock Off as well as wall setup sweepers like Falinks and Crustle that threaten Glaceon thanks to Unaware. In return, Glaceon can relieve Pyukumuku of any potential status conditions, which is especially useful for Rest variants. Stronger special attackers like Beheeyem and Raichu are capable of overwhelming Glaceon, meaning that it should never be the only special wall on balance teams. Other specially bulky Pokemon such as Type: Null, Dusclops, Vibrava, and Munchlax make for great partners because of this, with Rest allowing all three examples to soak up status conditions for Glaceon as well. Glaceon allows these examples to rely less on Rest by providing them with Wish support. Checks to Fighting-types are useful partners, since they can often switch into Glaceon with ease. Mareanie is a notable example, since it can consistently check Fighting-types thanks to both Recover and Regenerator, further wears teams down through Scald and either Toxic or Toxic Spikes, takes pressure off of Glaceon's team by absorbing Toxic Spikes, and stops setup sweepers like Falinks in their tracks with Haze.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Mamoswine is a good wallbreaker in UU due to its offensive typing that allows it to muscle through common walls like Tangrowth and Chansey. Ice Shard also gives it a priority option to threaten many faster threats like Thundurus, Salamence, and Galarian Moltres. Knock Off provides great utility to punish common switch-ins such as Rotom-H and Rotom-W. Unfortunately, Mamoswine has low defenses and a bad defensive typing, making it easy prey for common threats like Keldeo and Lycanroc-D. Without Thick Fat, it has virtually no defensive utility outside of switching into Electric-type attacks, and even then it cannot always check certain Electric-type threats, like Raikou, which KOes Mamoswine with Scald after minimal chip damage. Other Ground-type wallbreakers offer better defensive utility, like Krookodile. Mamoswine is also quite slow, having no chance to outspeed common threats like Starmie and Lycanroc-D. It is also weak to common priority attacks from Pokemon like Azumarill and Crawdaunt.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mamoswine can be used as a Stealth Rock setter but removing any of Mamoswine's four main moves severely limits its wallbreaking potential. Freeze-Dry is an option to OHKO Quagsire and nearly OHKO Gastrodon with Life Orb as well as better pressure Rotom-W. The utility offered by Knock Off is generally better, though, as it does nearly the same amount of damage as Freeze-Dry to Rotom-W, and Mamoswine can already nearly 2HKO Gastrodon and Quagsire with Earthquake. A Choice Scarf set allows Mamoswine to outspeed its typical fast checks like Raikou and Lycanroc-D, but this set faces a lot of competition from Diggersby, which also has access to U-turn to pivot out of unfavourable matchups.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Buzzwole: Mamoswine struggles to break through bulkier variants of Buzzwole that can stomach multiple Icicle Crashes and recover any lost health with Roost. Buzzwole also threatens to OHKO back with Close Combat or Drain Punch. Offensive variants of Buzzwole do need to be careful though, as Mamoswine could potentially KO it with two Icicle Crashes after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-H and Rotom-W</strong>: Both Rotom-W and Rotom-H are immune to Earthquake and resist Ice, making it difficult for Mamoswine to break through them. Additionally, both of these Pokemon can typically force Mamoswine out with STAB attacks or status moves, though they need to be wary of Knock Off on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users</strong>: UU has many threats like Keldeo, Gyarados, and Lycanroc-D that are faster than Mamoswine and threaten to KO it with super effective attacks. Mamoswine is also weak to multiple priority attacks, allowing Azumarill and Conkeldurr to KO it after minimal chip.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Since Mamoswine typically needs Life Orb to be effective, it will get worn down quickly, especially if it has to switch into Stealth Rock or Spikes.</p> ",

Knock Off is used to punish and cripple a switch-in such as Rotom-H or Rotom-W, allowing Mamoswine or another teammate to break past it more easily later. Thick Fat offers better protection against Rotom-H and ensures it can take a Fire Blast from Moltres. Stone Edge can be used alongside Thick Fat to nail the aforementioned Pokemon harder. Oblivious is also an option, as it blocks Intimidate to allow Mamoswine to retain its wallbreaking potential against Pokemon like Salamence and Incineroar. Life Orb is preferred, as it allows Mamoswine to safely 2HKO almost anything in the tier, including Celesteela and Chansey. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed unboosted Galarian Moltres and Timid Volcanion, but the loss in power significantly limits Mamoswine's breaking potential.</p> <p>After Mamoswine breaks down the enemy team early-game, a cleaner like Gyarados or Nihilego can finish it off for a late-game sweep. A pivot like Thundurus or Rotom-W can lure in Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Amoonguss and then pivot to Mamoswine for a more favorable matchup. Teaming Mamoswine up with a special wallbreaker like Thundurus-T, Keldeo, or Salamence will help the team break past Pokemon like Buzzwole, Rotom-H, and Rotom-W, all of which Mamoswine struggles against. Mamoswine is vulnerable to priority moves from Conkeldurr, Crawdaunt, and Azumarill; Amoonguss and Buzzwole can switch into most of these. Since Mamoswine is slow, it will need a teammate like Thundurus or Starmie to help deal with fast threats like Keldeo and Lycanroc-D.</p> "

          "description": "<p>This Porygon-Z set functions as a menacing wallbreaker due to Nasty Plot and a terrifying Adaptability-boosted STAB move in Hyper Beam. Nasty Plot boosts Porygon-Z's Special Attack to astronomical levels, letting it power through walls like Arcanine, Chansey, Corviknight, and Slowbro. Hyper Beam is Porygon-Z's strongest STAB move and can OHKO certain Pokemon without a boost, such as non-Unnerve Haxorus and Rillaboom. Eerie Impulse, when used with Recover, allows Porygon-Z to break through Primarina and Choice Specs Magnezone. 132 EVs in HP and 252 EVs in Defense alongside Chople Berry allow Porygon-Z to survive a Close Combat from Choice Band Urshifu-R, with Bold beating Adamant variants and Modest only beating Jolly variants, as well as an Outrage from Choice Band Mold Breaker Haxorus. 72 EVs in Speed are run to outspeed non-Jolly Corviknight as well as Pokemon like Choice Specs Modest Magnezone and bulky Rillaboom. The rest is put into Special Attack to maximize damage output. Alternatively, Porygon-Z can run Electroweb instead of Eerie Impulse and a spread of 92 HP / 252 Def / 28 SpA / 136 Spe to beat Choice Band Sawk and Avalugg while outspeeding Choice Band Adamant Dracovish. Another spread it can use is 184 HP / 248 Def / 32 SpA / 44 Spe with Speed Swap and Uproar replacing Eerie Impulse and Recover to reliably defeat Zeraora, stall Rotom-A, and Substitute users like Whimsicott.</p> <p>You want to think carefully when using this Porygon-Z set, as it has many matchups requiring specific play. Against Primarina, Porygon-Z should always use Eerie Impulse immediately to survive the possible Choice Specs Hydro Cannon. If it is an Assault Vest or Chilan Berry variant, Porygon-Z only needs to use Eerie Impulse until it's at -4, heal off damage taken shortly afterwards, Nasty Plot till at least +4, and OHKO with Hyper Beam. To figure out whether the Primarina is Choice Specs or not, if -2 Hydro Cannon deals 58% of damage or more against the standard EV spread, that indicates that it is using Choice Specs, so you can end the battle after one use of Nasty Plot instead of two. Against Choice Specs Magnezone, the same process comes into play; however, you do not need to set up with Nasty Plot, as Hyper Beam 2HKOes. Against stall Arcanine, use Nasty Plot once, as +1 Hyper Beam OHKOes even if they use Snarl. Usually, you will use Hyper Beam first against particular Pokemon that aren't naturally specially defensive, such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and non-Unnerve Choice Band Haxorus. Porygon-Z appreciates Chilan Berry Primarina as a partner, which handles wallbreakers like opposing Choice item Porygon-Z, Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, and Shell Smash Crustle. In return, Porygon-Z can deal with specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Slowbro, and Goodra. Porygon-Z is relatively frail even with this set's bulkier spread and cannot take many hits; thus, bulkier partners such as Magnezone and Arcanine are appreciated. Having partners that can take on Ghost-types like Dragapult, Galarian Corsola, and Gengar is imperative, as Porygon-Z has no moves capable of hitting them. Dark-types like Mandibuzz and Taunt Incineroar help alleviate this weakness. In return, Porygon-Z can handle one of their biggest issues: Urshifu-R.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Porygon-Z is an extremely strong special attacker due to its high Special Attack and Adaptability, and when paired with Choice Specs, this makes it one of the biggest offensive threats in the metagame. Hyper Beam OHKOes threats like Togekiss, Sylveon, and Arcanine. Trick is mainly used against typical stall-oriented Pokemon such as Torment Skarmory, Chansey, and Galarian Corsola to lock them into one move, allowing Porygon-Z to set up with Nasty Plot and KO them once boosted, barring Galarian Corsola which will be PP stalled because Porygon-Z cannot touch it without Dark Pulse. Dark Pulse is able to defeat Alolan Marowak and non-Focus Blast Choice Scarf Gengar, Dark Pulse can also hit Ghost-types, which Hyper Beam can't touch, in specific Galarian Corsola and Alolan Marowak. Uproar can be used over Dark Pulse on lower Special Attack set's to 2HKO non-Mirror Coat Magnezone and Whimsicott. The given EVs allow Porygon-Z to survive Grassy Glide from Choice Band Rillaboom and outspeed non-Choice Scarf Dracozolt and Dracovish, as well as OHKO Alolan-Marowak. An alternative EV spread of 144 HP / 60 Def / 72 SpA / 232 Spe with a Modest nature can be run in order to survive Choice Scarf Chandelure and Modest Scarf Draco Meteor from Hydreigon. However, the drop in Special Attacker makes the Alolan-Marowak match up unreliable, and can hurt with rolls against particularly bulky threats, like uninvested Snorlax. Another EV spread of 4 HP / 200 Def / 72 SpA / 232 Spe can be used to beat Life Orb Rillaboom. Lastly, Porygon-Z can use a spread of 144 HP / 60 Def / 96 SpA / 208 Spe or 148 Def / 152 SpA / 208 Spe with the nature Timid to out speed Adamant Haxorus and Urshifu, alongside doing all that you did before, depending on which one you use. Choice Specs Porygon-Z in general can sacrifice investment in either bulk, power, or speed to beat or get close to beating specific threats, like Excadrill, or fully invest in Speed to speed tie other non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Generally, due to the power Choice Specs gives to Porygon-Z, it has a lot more room to invest in either overwhelming offense or bulk.</p> <p>Trick should be used immediately against Pokemon such as Skarmory, Chansey, Galarian Corsola, and Crustle. Against Skarmory, simply rotate between Hyper Beam and Recover if they're running a damaging move; if you lock them into a status move, simply click Hyper Beam twice. Against Chansey, use Trick followed by Nasty Plot twice to get to +4 and then OHKO with Hyper Beam. Against Galarian Corsola, simply Trick and PP stall it, as it won't have any moves that can deal damage to Porygon-Z. Similarly to Galarian Corsola, Porygon-Z needs to PP stall Crustle. Regardless of what item you receive back, spam Recover until the foe runs out of PP. Due to the multi-hit nature of Rock Blast, the matchup is more favorable for Crustle but is not guaranteed If Crustle goes for Shell Smash on your Trick, simply click Hyper Beam twice, as they will be Choice-locked and unable to attack. Porygon-Z struggles against Fighting-type Pokemon and Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage such as Urshifu-R, Sawk, Hawlucha, and Haxorus. Fairy-type Pokemon, specifically Primarina and Sylveon, go well with Porygon-Z, since they can cover the Fighting-type weakness whilst simultaneously appreciating Porygon-Z's ability to deal with their threats such as Chansey, Rillaboom, Rotom-H as well as Poison-types such as Toxtricity and Venusaur. Porygon-Z needs to be wary of common Chilan Berry and Assault Vest users, mainly Primarina, so consider teammates such as Zeraora and Rillaboom.</p> "

Furthermore, it should be noted that Froslass struggles against leads on Sticky Web teams such as Slurpuff and Mental Herb Shuckle. Thus, pairing Froslass with a fast Rapid Spin user like Pheromosa or Regieleki would greatly benefit the removal of entry hazards and facilitate a potential sweep from one of Froslass's teammates.</p> "

The Speed EVs allow for Rotom-H to outpace maximum Speed neutral natured Aegislash, while maintaining as much special bulk as possible. The rest of the EVs maximize Rotom-H's special bulk to better check Sylveon. Lava Plume is Rotom-H's main STAB attack, and the 30% chance to burn targets can come in handy; Blue Flare can be used for extra damage output, but generally Lava Plume’s extra PP and higher chance to burn is more desirable. Volt Switch is an important tool for Rotom-H that allows it to pivot and scout for switches. Roost is Rotom-H's main recovery move and increases its longevity immensely. Toxic allows Rotom-H to beat defensive Sylveon properly and allows for it to hinder other switch-ins as well. Defog is a great tool to remove entry hazards and dual screens, while Freeze-Dry's increased coverage is great for would-be switch-ins such as Seismitoad and Rotom-Wash.  Will-O-Wisp, Nuzzle, and Aromatherapy are all worth considering as support options, as well as many other niche options.

In particular, Obstagoon can use Rotom-H’s pivoting to activate its Guts with Flame Orb safely, while Rotom-H can solidly check some of Obstagoon's checks in Corviknight Ferrothorn, Magearna, and Hippowdon. Kyurem is a good partner, as Rotom-H is one of the best switch-ins in the metagame to one of Kyurem's most prevalent checks, Sylveon, given Rotom-H has Toxic. Sylveon can possibly hinder Rotom-H as well if it has Toxic as well, however, so be careful. Some of Rotom-H's most common switchins are Water-type Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Rotom-W if it is not running Freeze-Dry, so a partner such as Seismitoad or Ferrothorn that can switch into Water-type Pokemon relatively safely is great, and both of the aforementioned partners can form a core that compresses both entry hazard roles with Rotom-H. Some of the strongest checks in the metagame to Rotom-H are Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o and Hydreigon, which take minimal damage from Freeze-Dry and do a ton of damage back.

Overheat hits Steel- and Grass-types such as Aegislash, Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Celebi. Thunderbolt hits Flying- and Water-types, such as Mandibuzz, Primarina, Milotic, and Toxapex. Trick is used to Choice-lock stall Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Type: Null into setup moves so that they can't touch Rotom-H. Rest is used to recover HP against Pokemon that got Choice-locked into attacks like Galarian Corsola with Night Shade. The EVs allow Rotom-H to outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured base 60s, like Incineroar, survive three Night Shades or Seismic Tosses from Galarian Corsola or Chansey, and stall it out with Rest after crippling it with Trick, and 2HKO Incineroar and Arcanine. Alternatively, a spread of 240 HP / 80 Def / 140 SpA / 48 Spe with a Bold Nature can be run, in order to always beat Urshifu-S, while still outspeeding base 60s. This will make the Primarina matchup much less reliable, however.</p> <p>Due to Rotom-H being a slow Fire-type, it is easily taken out by Rock-types and fast Water-types, such as Rhyperior, Tyranitar, Crustle, Keldeo, and Blastoise. Bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Pyukumuku can deal with this weakness. Rotom-H helps these Pokemon in return by being able to OHKO Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Venusaur, Rotom-C, and Celebi. Due to Rotom-H's attacks being Fire- and Electric-type, Dragon-types such as Haxorus, Hydreigon, and Dracovish can tank Rotom-H's attacks and KO it in return. Fighting-types such as Choice Specs Keldeo and bulky Choice Band Sawk can deal with these Dragon-types. In return, Rotom-H provides a check to both Flying- and Grass-types and also resists Electric-type attacks from Zeraora, Rotom-C, and Togedemaru.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Rotom-W's typing and Levitate allow it to be an effective pivot that comes in against notable threats such as Mamoswine, Moltres, Pelipper, and Celesteela. Rotom-W can act as an effective entry hazard remover due to its great matchup against common entry hazard setters like Rhyperior and Krookodile. Other utility options like Pain Split and Will-O-Wisp allow it to make progress even when the opponent switches to its checks and counters. Sadly, Rotom-W's poor HP stat in conjunction with its reliance on Leftovers and Pain Split for recovery holds back its ability to act as a reliable pivot and exacerbates its vulnerability to poison, burn, and Stealth Rock damage. While Rotom-W does have some useful resistances, it needs to be healthy or used with prediction to pivot against foes that can potentially dent it greatly, such as Ground-types that have a strong secondary STAB move like Nidoking and Diggersby.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet has the benefit of punishing the likes of Jirachi for spamming U-turn or contact moves, though losing the passive recovery from Leftovers is not ideal. Maximum Defense investment with a Bold nature makes Rotom-W a more effective pivot against Keldeo and Mamoswine, but the loss in Speed hampers it against foes like Nidoking and Chandelure. Choice Scarf is an option to revenge kill Keldeo and Lycanroc-D, with the set being able to run Trick to cripple the likes of Gastrodon, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth. However, Choice Scarf Rotom-W can no longer act as a switch-in to Mamoswine and Krookodile, fearing Knock Off, and being Choice-locked lets Ground-types punish Volt Switch much more strongly. Nasty Plot + Pain Split turns Rotom-W into a wallbreaker, but it still has immense problems with Grass-types. This set also sacrifices Volt Switch in favor of Thunderbolt or Discharge, which makes the matchup against Grass-types even worse. Rindo Berry can be used if the team is too weak to Dragon Dance Gyarados, as it can prevent an OHKO from +2 Adamant Power Whip and provide a safety net against Tapu Bulu if Will-O-Wisp misses.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage: Rotom-W cannot deal any significant damage to the likes of Tangrowth and Amoonguss aside from burning them. Though Tapu Bulu dislikes Will-O-Wisp, it can still threaten Rotom-W with Horn Leech to restore health. Zarude can use Jungle Healing to disregard status completely. However, all of them lose momentum to Volt Switch as they switch in. Rotom-W also must watch out for Grass-type coverage on Pokemon like Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Kommo-o only dislikes status from Rotom-W and is able to freely set up with Clangorous Soul. Zygarde-10%'s Thousand Arrows ignores Levitate, meaning it heavily punishes teams that solely rely on Rotom-W to deal with Ground-types.</p> <p><strong>Seismitoad and Gastrodon Seismitoad and Gastrodon shut down Rotom-W nearly completely if it is not carrying Toxic. Seismitoad can cripple Rotom-W with Toxic and is the only Stealth Rock setter that is immune to both Hydro Pump and Volt Switch, and Gastrodon does not care much about Will-O-Wisp.</p> ",

It also has unique defensive utility in checking, most notably, Heatran and Tornadus-T, but also Ground-types like Excadrill and Landorus-T. However, Rotom-W lacks reliable recovery, and it is dependent on Pain Split and Leftovers to consistently pivot and check offensive threats throughout a game, letting it be easily overwhelmed by repeated hits from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Heatran. This problem worsens after a Knock Off from one of the Pokemon it most commonly checks, like Landorus-T or Tornadus-T, or when it is statused by Heatran or Excadrill. Rotom-W faces competition from Slowking as a defensive pivot because of Slowking's reliable recovery with Slack Off and Regenerator, useful guaranteed slow pivoting with Teleport, and access to Future Sight, an invaluable tool for offensive teammates.

The Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outpace Jolly Choice Band Cinderace after a V-create, and Rotom-W can either OHKO back with Scald, while the rest of the spread maximizes physical bulk. Scald is the primary STAB attack of choice, allowing Rotom-W to burn the foe while also damaging it, and Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to act as a pivot and scout for switches, which Rotom-W does very effectively thanks to its ability to force out most Ground-types due to its Water typing. Roost is Rotom-W's primary form of recovery, and is a reliable way of keeping Rotom-W healthy. Strength Sap is another option that greatly improves Rotom-W's matchup versus physical threats, as it lowers the foe's Attack stat by one stage; however, it can fail to be effective against many special attackers and Substitute users such as all Rotom formes, Sylveon, and Kyurem.</p> <p>Pokemon that benefit from Rotom-W's pivoting make for good partners. Cinderace appreciates the free switch ins, as it can nuke many of Rotom-W's would-be answers such as Ferrothorn and non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon with super effective Fire- and Fighting-type moves, respectively. Obstagoon also appreciates Rotom-W's pivoting ability, as it can allow Obstagoon to activate its Guts with Flame Orb safely, and Rotom-W can check Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Corviknight for Obstagoon. Rotom-W's last moveslot is versatile and can be a plethora of moves depending on your team's structure and playstyle. Rotom-W heavily pressures defensive cores thanks to its extremely large movepool, making it an effective lure for many Pokemon. Examples of this includes running Blue Flare to OHKO Ferrothorn to support Gyarados and running Freeze-Dry to hit Seismitoad and Gastrodon alongside Dragon- and occasional Grass-types such as Kommo-o and Rillaboom to support various Water-type teammates such as Keldeo. Apple Acid can be used as well to hit Gastrodon and Seismitoad while simultaneously forcing switches through Special Defense drops, but it loses the Grass- and Dragon-type targets that Freeze-Dry hits. Aromatherapy, Nuzzle, and Will-O-Wisp are all worth considering as support options, alongside many other niche options too numerous to list here.</p> "

Eerie Impulse is used to drastically weaken special attackers such as Goodra and Primarina, while Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Dracovish, Galarian Darmanitan, and non-Lum Berry Crustle. Rotom-W can use Rest after crippling the foe enough to avoid getting KOed before waking up. Thunderbolt is Rotom-W's only non-status attack and is mainly used to inflict chip damage. Alternatively, Rotom-W can use Hydro Pump to deal damage to Pokemon that aren't affected by Will-O-Wisp such as Arcanine and Incineroar, and it allows Rotom-W to damage Zerarora. This EV set alongside Thunderbolt allows Rotom-W to outstall Seismic Toss users, outspeed base 60 Speed Pokemon, OHKO uninvested Urshifu-R, and take a Choice Band-boosted Superpower from Ushifu-R and both Mold Breaker and Unnerve Choice Scarf Haxorus. When running Hydro Pump, the EV spread should be 240 HP / 220 Def / 48 Spe instead, which maintains Speed and maximizes defensive presence. This EV set is mainly to boost the percentage to survive certain highly-invested attacks such as Giga Impact from Galarian Darmanitan.</p> <p>This Rotom-W set is used as a stall set. The main idea is to cripple the foe with Will-O-Wisp or Eerie Impulse to the point where their attacks are unable to 2HKO Rotom-W so it can safely recover with Rest. After sufficiently crippling the foe, Rotom-W can use Will-O-Wisp's chip damage and its attacking move of choice to KO the foe. In certain cases, Rotom-W can use Thunderbolt or Hydro Pump without crippling the foe if it outright wins due to the matchup; it can use Thunderbolt to OHKO Gyarados or Hydro Pump to OHKO defensive Arcanine. There are some Pokemon that are able to KO Rotom-W before it sets up, such as Choice Band Haxorus and Sylveon. Thus, teammates such as Rillaboom, Galarian Darmanitan, and Magnezone work well with Rotom-W. Rotom-W is also very susceptible to Taunt users such as Incineroar and Trick users such as Porygon-Z, so Pokemon that are immune or aren't affected by these status moves such as Galarian Darmanitan work very well with Rotom-W. Rotom-W should be careful of Mold Breaker Pokemon such as Excadrill and Choice Band Haxorus that can use Earthquake while ignoring Levitate and Unnerve Haxorus, which can prevent Kee Berry from activating.</p> "

Thunderbolt targets bulkier threats that Hydro Pump cannot break through such as Primarina and Urshifu-R. Trick can stop certain stall Pokemon such as Galarian Corsola and Type: Null by locking them into either a setup move or an attacking move that can't 3HKO, with Rotom-W using Rest at intervals in order to avoid getting KOed. The HP investment means Rotom-W will always survive three Night Shades from Galarian Corsola, and the Defense investment ensures survival against Choice Band Urshifu-S's Close Combat. The Speed investment with a Choice Scarf allows Rotom-W to outspeed +2 Adamant Crustle, while the remaining EVs are invested into Special Attack for maximum damage output.</p> <p>While Trick allows Rotom-W to beat most stall Pokemon, Whimsicott can use Substitute before Rotom-W can use Trick thanks to Prankster. Aromatisse can also easily take hits from Rotom-W or lock it into Trick with Encore if Rotom-W uses Trick to stop Aromatisse's Substitute + Disable strategy. Rotom-W struggles with specially defensive attackers, such as Sylveon and Snorlax, so it appreciates help from physical wallbreakers such as Rillaboom and Galarian Darmanitan. In return, Rotom-W checks the Fire-types that beat both Rillaboom and Galarian Darmanitan along with other threats such as Choice Band Skarmory and Sap Sipper Azumarill. Due to its lack of coverage, Rotom-W is walled by most Dragon- and Grass-types, so Fairy-types such as Primarina and Sylveon are appreciated to help with the former.

A Choice Scarf set can also be run with Trick, which has a lot of surprise factor, but losing Leftovers hurts and Rotom-W is a subpar Choice Scarf user.

Serperior can always come in on it, only fearing the rare Thunder Wave, and set up a Substitute and wreak havoc.

Defog is another option over Pain Split for role compression, as it also has a good matchup against two of the best Stealth Rock setters in the tier, Heatran and Landorus-T.

Unfortunately, Rotom-C's Speed is lacking in comparison to other offensive Pokemon like Salazzle and Starmie, and, even with a Choice Scarf, it's too slow to revenge kill Shell Smash Blastoise and +1 Flygon. Although Rotom-C possesses valuable resistances, it cannot switch in against many of NU's most common Pokemon: even against many Steel-types, including the likes of Copperajah and Escavalier, due to their coverage.</p> ",

Nasty Plot allows Rotom-C to serve as a setup sweeper by beating Pokemon such as Hatterene, Bisharp, and Excadrill after a boost, while Subsitute also allows it to set up on status users such as Seismitoad, Pokemon that are unable to deal significant damage to Rotom-C such as Toxapex, and forced switches, as well as helping against Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Thunderbolt is valuable coverage that hits Pokemon such as Corviknight and Toxapex for super effective damage, as well as Pokemon like Aegislash, Bisharp, Jirachi, Salazzle, and Galarian Weezing neutrally. Leaf Storm is Rotom-C's stronger STAB attack that hits the aforementioned Ground-type Pokemon and can beat bulkier Pokemon, such as Mew, Hatterene, and Gardevoir, with a Nasty Plot boost. Although its bulk is not the best, Rotom-C can serve as an answer to certain offensive Pokemon using its typing, such as Barraskewda and Seismitoad under rain, but shouldn't set up on other hard-hitting offensive Pokemon such as Indeedee and Dragapult that threaten to OHKO or heavily dent it.</p> <p>The entirety of Electric appreciates Rotom-C's ability to serve as a reliable answer to Ground-type Pokemon, seeing as Electric teams struggle immensely against them otherwise.

Choice Band Zeraora is a fantastic wallbreaker that can take on faster Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Cinderace, and Dragapult and forms an offensive core with Rotom-C. Zeraora's ability to wallbreak early-game and beat Dragon- and Steel-type Pokemon with Play Rough, Plasma Fists, and Close Combat is fantastic for Rotom-C to sweep weakened teams or vice versa. Toxtricity is another special attacker that can beat Grass-type Pokemon such as Whimsicott, Vileplume, and Roserade for Rotom-C. Alolan Raichu is a powerful wallbreaker that can outspeed and beat threats such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Choice Scarf Gengar, and Choice Scarf Excadrill for Rotom-C under Electric Terrain.

Mesprit's best qualities are its good speed for a Stealth Rock setter and favorable matchup against several entry hazard removers such as Golbat and Hitmontop.

Furthermore, chip damage can be detrimental, as it reduces the Base Power of Eruption.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Slowking, Tapu Fini, and Rotom-W can switch into Magma Storm and threaten to KO Heatran. Swampert and Gastrodon can threaten to OHKO Heatran and force it out, with Swampert also being able to pivot using Flip Turn; however, both Pokemon struggle to consistently switch in due to the threat of Toxic. Offensive Water-types like Urshifu-R and Barraskewda also threaten to KO it with their strong STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types like defensive Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Dragonite are good checks to Heatran, as they resist Magma Storm and threaten to OHKO it. They can also shrug off any chip damage from Magma Storm using their recovery, but they should be wary of being crippled by Toxic. Dragonite is a notable check, as it can use Heal Bell to get rid of any status that Heatran dishes out. Kyurem can use Heatran as setup fodder with Substitute, and it is capable of OHKOing Heatran with a Choice Specs-boosted coverage option.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon and Coverage: Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Excadrill, and Nidoking can threaten to OHKO Heatran. Moreover, Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking and Tyranitar can take Heatran's hits quite well and threaten to possibly KO it with Earthquake; however, Galarian Slowking with Earthquake is rather uncommon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Heatran's lack of reliable recovery leaves it weak to residual damage from entry hazards, Leech Seed from Ferrothorn, and Sticky Barb from Trick Clefable, and it makes it vulnerable to repeated strong hits from the likes of Tornadus-T and Dragapult. Knock Off can make this worse, as it removes Heatran's only form of recovery in Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage: Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Kartana, and Tapu Lele run Fighting-type coverage moves to deal with Heatran and Steel-types and can threaten a KO on it and force it out. Fighting-types like Hawlucha, Urshifu-R, and Galarian Zapdos can also threaten it with an OHKO.</p> ",

Magma Storm enables Heatran to trap Pokemon like Toxapex and Blissey and chip down checks such as Garchomp and Swampert. Taunt allows Heatran to overwhelm Clefable, Toxapex, Slowking, and Blissey. Toxic wears down Heatran's defensive switch-ins such as Hydreigon, Slowking, and Tyranitar and also helps to break through Blissey.

However, it is really passive: it allows Eternatus to come in and use Toxic freely and allows Pokemon like Calyrex-S, Yveltal, and Xerneas to come in, threaten Giratina out, and set up. Giratina's passivity also makes it fairly susceptible to Toxic Spikes, which is exacerbated by its reliance on Rest for recovery. Defog can also work well with Pressure, effectively stalling entry hazards out of PP in more drawn-out games. Toxic is used to put Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal on a timer while also limiting potential switch-ins like Calyrex-S and Xerneas. Will-O-Wisp is used to hinder physical attackers such as Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, Groudon, and switch-ins like Zekrom. It also deters strong physical attackers from using Giratina as setup fodder. Rest allows Giratina to stay healthy throughout the match; however, it needs time using Rest because this will make it free setup bait for Calyrex-S, Xerneas, Zacian-C, Zygarde-C, and Zekrom. Using 40 Special Defense EVs avoids the 2HKO from Modest Choice Scarf Kyogre's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs with a Relaxed nature allow it to tank attacks from Zacian-C and Excadrill, as well as +1 Dragon Ascent from Rayquaza, and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. 0 Speed IVs allow Giratina to use Defog after Necrozma-DM uses Stealth Rock, avoiding Stealth Rock going up in a situation where Giratina is badly poisoned and is better off being sacked.</p> <p>Giratina best fits on bulky balance or stall teams. It appreciates Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Necrozma-DM due to them taking care of Xerneas, and Necrozma-DM can come in on Zacian-C's attacks and wear it down. Giratina struggles with Ghost- and Dark-types such as Lunala, Yveltal, and Calyrex-S, so Tyranitar and bulky Yveltal make good partners to come in on their attacks and potentially threaten them. Lunala is a crucial teammate, taking care of various Substitute sweepers such as Zekrom and Zygarde-C, which otherwise use Giratina as setup fodder. Lunala is also the best check available to Groudon, a threat Giratina loses to with the slightest chip damage. Eternatus, Kyurem-W, and Blissey can take pressure off of Giratina by checking Kyogre. Moreover, Eternatus can act as a check to Marshadow and a valuable status and Toxic Spikes absorber, Kyurem-W provides bulky teams with a powerful wincon by virtue of Sheer Cold, and Blissey can use Aromatherapy to get rid of Giratina's sleep from using Rest. Quagsire is an excellent check to Zacian-C and Zygarde-C, as it can use Haze to get rid of boosts and tank boosted attacks because of Unaware. However, using Quagsire means forgoing Necrozma-DM, and thus forgoing a key component of checking Xerneas. If using Quagsire, Chansey is a nigh mandatory teammate to patch this up. Lastly, Ditto can be a great asset on any stall or bulky balance team, acting as a clutch revenge killer against a myriad of threats in Calyrex-S, Xerneas, Zacian-C, chipped Groudon, and Marshadow.</p> "

Defog in tandem with Pressure enables Giratina to reliably remove hazards throughout the game. Toxic allows Giratina to cripple switch-ins such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal and Xerneas while chipping away at offensive threats such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. Will-O-Wisp allows Giratina to punish offensive Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Ultra Necrozma, Mega Rayquaza, and Zacian-C that may attempt to aggressively switch in or set up while allowing Giratina to chip Ferrothorn. Rest provides Giratina with a form of recovery while curing it of status. Roar is an option over Will-O-Wisp in order to rack up hazard damage and to fully prevent Giratina from being set up on by Pokemon such as Calm Mind + Refresh Arceus formes and Substitute Zacian-C, but it is generally not recommended, as it only provides a temporary check to physical wallbreakers, allowing them to freely attack Giratina. The given EV spread maximizes physical bulk while ensuring Giratina avoids the 2HKO from Primal Kyogre's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage.

In return, it offers powerful entry hazard control and status absorption. Yveltal is a huge threat to Giratina, so switch-ins such as Chansey, Tyranitar, Diancie and Ho-Oh to an extent are invaluable. In particular, Chansey and Diancie also offer cleric support to mitigate the effects of Rest, making them especially good partners. Substitute + Dragon Tail Zygarde-C sets up for free on Giratina, so strong checks such as Ice Beam or Perish Song Arceus formes are recommended. Refresh + Calm Mind Arceus formes also set up on Giratina for free, therefore checks such as Chansey or Whirlwind users such as Ho-Oh and Lugia are appreciated. Xerneas is also a huge threat to Giratina, and teammates such as Necrozma-DM and the aforementioned Chansey can check it. Switch-ins to Eternatus such as Tyranitar and Chansey are appreciated too. Play Rough Zacian-C and Draco Meteor Mega Rayquaza are common threats that Giratina cannot handle easily, so Lugia, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Ground are good partners for it.</p> "

Psyshock gives Cresselia a better matchup against Calm Mind Raikou and hits Roserade and Dragalge harder. Moonblast hits Dark- and Dragon-types like Obstagoon, Flygon, and Tyrantrum. Moonlight keeps Cresselia healthy throughout the battle. Toxic is used to wear down bulky Pokemon like Seismitoad, Milotic, and Incineroar. Thunder Wave, on the other hand, provides Speed control by slowing down fast threats for Cresselia's teammates. 176 Speed EVs allow Cresselia to outspeed Modest Toxtricity. However, Cresselia can run less Speed to better take hits from Pokemon like Mienshao, Flygon, and Darmanitan: 144 Speed EVs allow Cresselia to be faster than Adamant Tyrantrum and Jolly Bewear, while 56 Speed EVs let it outsped Adamant Bewear and Modest Sylveon.

Moonblast covers Dark-types like Incineroar, Obstagoon, and Umbreon. Substitute blocks Trick and, more importantly, protects Cresselia from status ailments, allowing it to set up against bulky Pokemon such as Diancie, Milotic, and Registeel at the cost of reliable recovery. On the other hand, Moonlight allows Cresselia to more easily sustain itself in the long run and better handle threatening special attackers such as Toxtricity, Sylveon, and Starmie. This also gives Cresselia more setup opportunities, though it becomes vulnerable to status conditions such as poison. 176 Speed EVs let Cresselia outspeed Modest Toxtricity so Cresselia can use Calm Mind first to better take its Boomburst. 92 HP EVs give Cresselia a 101 HP Substitute, meaning that a single Seismic Toss from Registeel cannot break it.

Galarian Weezing in particular also checks threats to Cresselia like Mimikyu, Heracross, and Zarude. Strong wallbreakers such as Toxtricity, Darmanitan, and Obstagoon, on the other hand, can weaken or even defeat these defensive Pokemon so that they are no longer able to stop Cresselia from a Calm Mind sweep. Knock Off support from Reuniclus and Salazzle is helpful to get rid of Incineroar's Heavy-Duty Boots so they can be worn down by entry hazards. Cobalion and Galarian Weezing check Dark-types and switch into Knock Off for Cresselia. If Cresselia is not running Moonlight, Wish support from the likes of Sylveon or Umbreon is useful to keep Cresselia healthy.

Cresselia can also forego Calm Mind and use Trick instead to cripple opposing defensive Pokemon with its Black Sludge and provide counterplay to opposing Trick users. However, this is inconsistent, since many defensive threats hold Black Sludge as well, and an incorrect timing of the move could result in Cresselia holding undesirable items like a Choice Scarf.

Its Poison typing from Toxic pairs nicely with Levitate, making it immune to both the poison status and Ground-type attacks while leaving it with only two weaknesses. Toxic puts offensive threats like Fire / Grass Volcarona and Hydreigon on a timer to prevent them from using setup moves effectively. Moonblast is a spammable attack that grants Cresselia a Fairy typing, which gives it an immunity and stacks useful resistances with its Poison typing. Moonlight is Cresselia's reliable recovery and keeps it healthy. Calm Mind keeps Cresselia from being overly passive and allows it to set up on other passive Pokemon like Blissey and Slowbro, or boost alongside opposing Calm Mind users like Electric / Dragon Latios, wearing all the aforementioned Pokemon down with Toxic as it sets up. Thunder Wave is another option that punishes offensive threats that Toxic can't, like Poison-type Garchomp, Latias, and Naganadel. It provides a great defensive typing with only one weakness thanks to Levitate and useful resistances to Flying- and Electric-type attacks that Toxic variants take neutral damage from. Shadow Ball gives Cresselia another unique typing with multiple immunities, mainly to high-powered Normal-type attacks like Extreme Speed, Facade, and Boomburst. It also allows Cresselia to have more coverage when it sets up with Calm Mind, but it makes Cresselia vulnerable to Ghost-type STAB moves like Shadow Claw and Shadow Ball, which are commonly seen on Facade and Boomburst users like Heracross and Noivern. Black Sludge is the item of choice for Poison-type Cresselia, as it increases Cresselia's longevity and punishes Trick users, while other Cresselia sets opt for Leftovers. A Bold nature with full investment in HP and Defense allows Cresselia to take on numerous physical attackers like Landorus-T, Lycanroc-D without Iron Head, and most unboosted Extreme Speed users outside of Zygarde-10% with Thousand Arrows.</p> <p>While Cresselia is bulky, it is still vulnerable to high-powered neutral attacks like Guts-boosted Facade from Heracross and Triple Axel from Choice Band Pheromosa. Each of these attacks can 2HKO Cresselia with prior damage, so it is important to pair Cresselia with teammates that can stomach these hits like defensive Water / Poison Slowbro and Normal-resistant Pokemon such as Steel-type Buzzwole. These teammates also help cover Cresselia's few remaining weaknesses to types like Poison, Psychic, or Steel, depending on Cresselia's typing. Magnezone can pair with Cresselia to trap and eliminate Steel-types like Buzzwole and Scizor. While Cresselia can use Calm Mind to combat certain opposing setup threats, others like Psychic Volcarona and Taunt Spectrier can quickly overwhelm it. Defensive Dark / Poison Pokemon such as Unaware Clefable and Toxapex make great partners for Cresselia to handle the setup threats that can break past it.</p> "

Encore can also be used to take advantage of Pokemon like Clefable, Toxapex, and Landorus-T, locking them into a passive recovery move or entry hazard move and giving Victini a free turn to attack.

Bulkier offense archetypes enjoy Victini's defensive utility, as its ability to pivot in on huge threats like Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham is often a godsend for them. Victini likes to get in unharmed so it can take advantage of its bulk as best as possible, so pivots like Corviknight, Blissey, and Slowbro make good teammates. Similarly, Defoggers like Zapdos and the aforementioned Corviknight make excellent partners because they can remove Stealth Rock, which often hinders Victini's defensive utility. Pokemon that appreciate Victini crippling or KOing Pokemon like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Slowbro, such as Mega Mawile, Tapu Koko, and Gliscor, make fantastic partners. Victini can struggle with sturdy Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T that can tank its V-creates decently while wearing it down with Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin, so Pokemon like Weavile, Kyurem, and Ash-Greninja are good choices to deal with them. These three also appreciate Victini's ability to bait in these Ground-types and U-turn on them.</p> "

          "name": "Offensive Rapid Spin",
          "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Rapid Spin allows Drilbur to remove entry hazards and gives it a +1 Speed boost, allowing it to outpace threats that would outspeed or Speed tie with Drilbur otherwise, such as Abra, Mienfoo, and Staryu. Earthquake is Drilbur's best STAB move, allowing it to deal decent damage to every Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Rock Slide gives Drilbur perfect neutral coverage, hitting Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake such as Vullaby and Wingull. Swords Dance can be used to increase Drilbur's Attack and pairs well with Rapid Spin, making Drilbur a threatening setup sweeper. Alternatively, Stealth Rock allows Drilbur to deal chip damage to opposing Pokemon switching in.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment in addition to a Jolly nature makes Drilbur as fast as possible, allowing it to outspeed Pawniard and Vullaby. 76 EVs in Attack allow Drilbur to 2HKO most Vullaby sets after Stealth Rock. The rest of the EVs are placed into Defense and Special Defense to allow Drilbur to take hits from Diglett, Vullaby, and Mudbray. Berry Juice is the preferred item in order for Drilbur to have access to recovery, but Eviolite allows Drilbur to tank hits non-Eviolite sets would not be able to take, such as +2 Dark Pulse from Vullaby, High Jump Kick from Mienfoo, and Psychic from Abra. Mold Breaker is used to help surpass abilities like Sturdy from Onix and Levitate from Koffing.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Drilbur's access to a powerful Earthquake can force Pokemon such as Pawniard and Onix to switch out. This gives Drilbur the opportunity to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, set Stealth Rock to support its teammates, or boost its Attack with Swords Dance. Pokemon that are faster or capable of revenge killing Drilbur, such as Staryu, Wingull, and Grookey, should be removed from the game early to help Drilbur either get a Rapid Spin off for other Pokemon to sweep or act as a late-game sweeper itself. When you know a Flying-type is going to potentially switch into Earthquake, use Rock Slide to catch them off guard.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Flying-types such as Vullaby and Wingull make for good partners for Drilbur, since they can threaten Grass-types like Foongus and Grookey as well as Fighting-types like Timburr and Mienfoo. Vulpix and Ponyta in particular make for good teammates because they can break through Ferroseed, and in return, Drilbur can remove entry hazards and weaken Mareanie. Finally, checks to Water-types are appreciated by Drilbur, making Grass-types like Ferroseed, Foongus, and Grookey good partners.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sand Rush is an alternative over Mold Breaker to outspeed foes in sand, but it requires additional support from Hippopotas and Drilbur will lose out on Mold Breaker being able to bypass Levitate. Life Orb can be used over Berry Juice to hit bulky Pokemon like Spritzee and Ferroseed harder, but it is not worth getting rid of the recovery Berry Juice provides. A set with Stealth Rock, Swords Dance, Rapid Spin, and Earthquake can be used, but keep in mind that this will omit Drilbur's ability to cover Flying-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Offensive Water-types such as Staryu and Wingull can outspeed and easily OHKO Drilbur with their STAB moves. Bulky Water-types like Frillish and Shellos render Drilbur useless and force it out, with Frillish also functioning as a spinblocker.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grookey can OHKO Drilbur with Grassy Glide. Ferroseed and Foongus shrug off Drilbur's attacks pretty easily and can dish a lot of damage with Giga Drain and Bullet Seed.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Both Timburr and offensive Mienfoo can tank an Earthquake from Drilbur. Timburr can then beat Drilbur with a combination of Drain Punch and Mach Punch, while Mienfoo can OHKO it with High Jump Kick.</p> "

Unfortunately, Excadrill is very frail, and its Speed is mediocre if not boosted by Sand Rush or Rapid Spin, making it easily revenge killed by strong priority moves from Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Urshifu-R as well as by faster Pokemon like Garchomp and Kartana. It is easily walled by common physically defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Corviknight, and Skarmory, leaving offensive sets heavily reliant on support from teammates to successfully sweep.

Excadrill can use some alternative items to Leftovers. For example, Heavy-Duty Boots allows Excadrill to switch in without taking damage from entry hazards, which can be helpful if using Rapid Spin. However, Excadrill is already immune to Toxic Spikes and resistant to Stealth Rock, meaning that the chip damage is not usually significant. An Air Balloon is another item that can be used on Sand Rush variants to allow Excadrill to set up against some Ground-types like Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Landorus-T that would usually force it out, but it isn't useful otherwise, and Excadrill will be unable to take advantage of its defensive typing if it wants to keep its item intact. Additionally, Excadrill is worn down more quickly without the passive recovery of Leftovers. High Horsepower can be used over Earthquake on either set to avoid having Excadrill's strongest STAB move weakened by Grassy Terrain, although in other situations its reduced power and imperfect accuracy can be undesirable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Corviknight and Skarmory are the best counters to Excadrill, resisting its STAB moves and being immune to Toxic. Zapdos also resists Excadrill's STAB moves but must watch out for Rock Slide and Toxic.

All of them can be worn down if Excadrill hits them with Toxic, though, and if Excadrill carries an Air Balloon, it can potentially set up on the Ground-types.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Rillaboom easily revenge kills Excadrill with its priority Grassy Glide, and it is of particular annoyance because Grassy Terrain weakens Earthquake. Urshifu-R and Weavile can also revenge kill it with Aqua Jet and Ice Shard, respectively, and many other Pokemon faster than Excadrill outside of sand can OHKO it, such as Volcarona and offensive Garchomp.

Clefable and Toxapex are solid checks to Fighting-types like Hawlucha and Urshifu-R. They also benefit from Excadrill's ability to check Pokemon like Tapu Koko and prevent strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele from freely using their strongest moves.

Having Iron Head helps take care of Ice- and Fairy-types such as Galarian Darmanitan and Grimmsnarl. Rapid Spin clears hazards, which is especially useful for Spikes and Sticky Web that all Ground teams dislike, and also boosts Speed, making Excadrill harder to revenge kill, such as with Choice Scarf Trace Gardevoir, while also giving it the ability to sweep outside of sand. Life Orb is a good option for power, while Leftovers is another option that helps Excadrill set up and does not wear it down. Be careful about switching Excadrill into attacks because its mediocre bulk and damage from Life Orb make it easy for Pokemon with priority to take care of it. Maximum Speed investments along with a Jolly nature ensures it outspeeds a huge threat in Choice Scarf Weavile under sand.</p> <p>Excadrill needs Hippowdon in order to more easily make use of its ability Sand Rush; Hippowdon also can set Stealth Rock for Excadrill, which makes it easier to get KOs. Mamoswine is also a good teammate for Excadrill because it can use Ice Shard to pick off the Pokemon that Excadrill weakens. Excadrill struggles against Water-types, so Seismitoad is needed to switch into Water-type attacks for Excadrill. Dugtrio also makes a good teammate because it can trap threats to Excadrill such as Choice Scarf Trace Gardevoir.</p> "

Mold Breaker allows Excadrill to hit Levitate users such as Rotom-W, Hydreigon, and Bronzong with Earthquake, and it can also bypass Mimikyu's Disguise. Excadrill's main roles are being a revenge killer and a hazard remover. It has good HP but poor defenses, so it shouldn't be switched in on powerful attacks repeatedly.

Aegislash is another good partner because it's immune to Fighting-type attacks that threaten Excadrill. Heatproof Bronzong can take Fire-type attacks for Excadrill, and it can also set up Stealth Rock to chip away at the opposing team. Ferrothorn resists Water-type attacks and can set up Spikes to damage the opposing team even more for Excadrill to clean.

Air Balloon reverses the matchup against Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. However, these matchups aren't worth being stonewalled by Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Zapdos. A suicide lead set consisting of Stealth Rock / Earthquake / Rapid Spin / Toxic or Steel Beam can be used on hyper offensive teams to guarantee Stealth Rock, thanks to Mold Breaker, and to keep hazards off its side of the field. However, such a set is generally outclassed by Landorus-T, which brings a nuclear Explosion to the table, and Mew, which brings Spikes and Taunt. A specially defensive set can be used to check a myriad of Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele while providing Rapid Spin, but it is easy to wear down and overwhelm.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Corviknight, Zapdos, and Mega Charizard Y are immune to Excadrill's Earthquake and take its Iron Head decently well, while they can all retaliate with super effective coverage. Mega Charizard Y can also remove potential sand, causing Excadrill to be slower than it. However, the former must be wary of Substitute variants if it lacks Body Press, and the latter two are shattered by +2 Normalium Z.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: When unboosted by sand or Rapid Spin, Excadrill sits are at a poor Speed tier. As a result, faster Pokemon like Garchomp, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Lopunny are capable of revenge killing it. Ash-Greninja in particular has a powerful Water Shuriken to dispatch of Excadrill even when its boosted. However, none of these Pokemon can switch into Excadrill directly and cannot beat it if its Speed is boosted.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Physically defensive Tangrowth is incredibly difficult for Excadrill to break if it has used its Z-Move, and Tangrowth can wear Excadrill down with Rocky Helmet and Giga Drain or neutralize it with Sleep Powder. However, Tangrowth can be crippled by Toxic long-term. Rillaboom, while unable to switch in directly, deals heavy damage to Excadrill with a priority Grassy Glide.

Additionally, its solid bulk and fantastic defensive typing give it many opportunities to set up against the likes of Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko. Swords Dance alongside a Z-Move lets Excadrill clean up weakened defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Fini. Giga Impact gives it access to Breakneck Blitz, allowing Excadrill to break through common Pokemon like Zapdos as well as chipped Slowbro and Tangrowth after a boost. Rapid Spin can be used if Excadrill's team can't fit Defog elsewhere and gives Excadrill the ability to limit Stealth Rock Clefable, patch up its Speed without the need for sand, and remove entry hazards for Pokemon weak to them like Mega Charizard Y. Toxic can be used in the fourth slot to wear down Slowbro, Tangrowth, Landorus-T, and Zapdos, especially alongside sand damage. Substitute is an option to use non-Body Press Corviknight as setup fodder. Leftovers allows for Excadrill to take advantage of its solid defensive typing, giving it easier setup on Pokemon like Clefable and Tapu Koko. However, forgoing Normalium Z can be detrimental against teams carrying Slowbro, Zapdos, and Tangrowth. Jolly is the preferred nature to Speed tie with opposing Excadrill, but if adequate Excadrill counterplay is on your team, Adamant can be used for its higher power, which is notable for dispatching Slowbro and Tangrowth a bit easier.</p> <p>Excadrill necessitates sand to function properly, so either Tyranitar or Mega Tyranitar are mandatory alongside it. Mega Tyranitar is also a great Stealth Rock setter, chipping Excadrill's answers into the range of its attacks. Both Tyranitar formes are also notable for being able to beat Zapdos one-on-one for Excadrill and having Pursuit to cripple Mega Latias. Corviknight effortlessly walls Excadrill, so teammates that can deal with it, such as Zapdos and Magnezone, make excellent teammates. Both are also notable for tearing open physically defensive Tangrowth, which would otherwise halt Excadrill's sweep. Swords Dance and Choice Band Kartana sets are also capable of forcing damage onto Corviknight and Zapdos, causing them to falter at checking Excadrill. Faster Pokemon like Ash-Greninja and Mega Lopunny can exploit Excadrill's mediocre Speed outside of sand, with Ash-Greninja revenge killing it even under sand with Water Shuriken, so partners such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Corviknight are needed to help remedy this issue. Ferrothorn and Ash-Greninja are notable partners for their ability to set Spikes, allowing Excadrill to pressure Pokemon that would otherwise check it like Tangrowth. Calm Mind Clefable and Reuniclus are solid partners for Excadrill, as they appreciate Excadrill dismantling Steel-types that can halt their sweep. They also provide a solid defensive backbone which Excadrill can fall back on once sand has run out.</p> "

Rock Tomb lowers the Speed of opposing lead Pokemon that Excadrill or its teammates would otherwise be slower than, and it also prevents sweepers like Dynamaxed Yveltal, Mega Rayquaza, and Xerneas from KOing Excadrill with Speed boosts under their belt. A high Attack stat and Earthquake ensure that Excadrill isn't passive setup bait, letting it threaten common entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn as well as potentially OHKO Zacian-C; this forces them to KO Excadrill, which allows its teammates to safely enter the field and take advantage of the Stealth Rock that it has laid. Toxic is also a viable option over Earthquake to pressure Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, support Arceus formes without Refresh, and other Pokemon that try to set up on Excadrill. Rapid Spin removes entry hazards set by other lead Pokemon such as Deoxys-S, Primal Groudon, and Smeargle and provides Excadrill with a Speed boost to outspeed and threaten faster Pokemon. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed Smeargle, support Arceus formes, Modest Yveltal and Xerneas, and, after one Speed boost from Rapid Spin, Jolly Zacian-C. Focus Sash is the chosen item, as it guarantees that Excadrill will survive any one non-multi-hit move from faster Pokemon, which improves the chance of it getting Stealth Rock up.</p> <p>Excadrill fits best on hyper offense teams due to the fact that other playstyles generally do not appreciate a dedicated suicide lead. Beating lead Substitute Zacian-C is essential for offense, as otherwise, said foe will most likely outspeed and KO or severely damage the rest of Excadrill's team, preventing safe setup in most cases. Entry hazard-sensitive Pokemon such as Mega Rayquaza, Lunala, and Yveltal really appreciate Excadrill's ability to get rid of entry hazards. Other sweepers such as Zacian-C, Xerneas, and Dragon Dance Zygarde-C are also great teammates for Excadrill. Pokemon that can block Excadrill's Rapid Spin like Ferrothorn and Ghost-types like Lunala can be problematic, so teammates that can take advantage of them such as Zacian-C and Yveltal are also appreciated.</p> "

Additionally, its Steel typing is crucial, as it gives Ground teams a way to deal with Ice-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types such as Alolan Ninetales, Tapu Lele, Latios, and Tapu Bulu, which are otherwise very tricky to handle. Iron Head is needed in order to hit the aforementioned foes, as well as hitting other Pokemon that can easily switch in on Earthquake such as Latias, Mega Aerodactyl, and Hydreigon. X-Scissor nails Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Celebi while OHKOing Zarude. Rock Slide provides good coverage against Flying-types that can take both of Excadrill's STAB moves with ease such as Mantine, Mega Charizard Y, and Zapdos. Rapid Spin may be used over Rock Slide instead to remove entry hazards; however, this causes Excadrill to lose momentum, as being locked into Rapid Spin forces it to switch out afterwards. Choice Band gives Excadrill the power to handle foes such as Swampert, Mega Sableye, and Slowbro while letting it sweep weakened teams more easily. A Jolly nature is preferred on this set, allowing Excadrill to outspeed Choice Scarf Greninja and Choice Scarf Weavile in sand and foes like Nidoking, Mamoswine, and Kommo-o outside of it. An Adamant nature can be used instead to have a better chance at 2HKOing Ferrothorn and Slowbro and guarantee an OHKO against physically defensive Toxapex. Excadrill is best used as a late-game sweeper once physically defensive walls that check it like Skarmory and Porygon2 are extremely weakened or removed from a match. It can also act as an early-game wallbreaker against types that lack sturdy checks to Excadrill, such as Psychic and Dragon.</p> <p>Hippowdon is needed in order to set sand for Excadrill to outspeed the previously mentioned offensive threats due to Sand Rush. It can also set Stealth Rock and switch into threatening physical attackers such as Mega Gallade, Cinderace, and Zeraora. Landorus forms an excellent wallbreaking core with Excadrill; it can weaken physically defensive foes like Porygon2 and Ferrothorn, while Excadrill can take on specially defensive foes like Blissey and Slowking. Landorus also provides Gravity support, which enables Excadrill to OHKO its traditional Ground-immune checks like Celesteela, Skarmory, and Rotom-W with Earthquake. Gastrodon and Seismitoad provide an essential immunity to Water-type attacks for Excadrill, which allows them to switch in on threats like Rotom-W, Mega Swampert, and Mantine. Gastrodon's high bulk and access to Recover also lets it shrug off most of their other attacks, while Seismitoad's better Speed tier, superior offenses, and potent coverage allows it to offensively check them. Seismitoad can also check Azumarill, which is otherwise a huge threat to Ground teams. Mega Garchomp is a ferocious wallbreaker that can lure in and weaken Skarmory and Celesteela with Fire Blast, pressure Flying-types like Mantine and Zapdos with Stone Edge, and break through physically defensive walls like Mega Venusaur and Galarian Corsola with its Swords Dance-boosted attacks for Excadrill. Mamoswine is another good offensive partner that can beat Flying-types like Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Mantine for Excadrill with its STAB Ice-type moves, relieving the need for it to use Rock Slide.</p> "

Additionally, it wears down foes with Stealth Rock and sand while switching into threatening physical attackers such as Terrakion, Mega Scizor, and opposing Excadrill. Landorus deals with physically defensive foes like Porygon2 and Slowbro for Excadrill, while Excadrill can take on specially defensive foes like Blissey for Landorus. Landorus also provides Gravity support, which enables Excadrill to threaten checks like Celesteela, Skarmory, and Rotom-W with Earthquake. Gastrodon and Seismitoad both provide a switch-in against threatening Water-type attacks from the likes of Rotom-W, Mega Swampert, and Mantine due to their immunity-granting abilities. Gastrodon's higher bulk and access to Recover also make it a consistent check to these Water-types, while Seismitoad's better offensive stats and Grass-type coverage allows it to pressure them offensively. Mamoswine helps against Flying-types that Excadrill struggles against, such as Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, forcing them out with Icicle Crash or Ice Shard. Similarly, Mega Garchomp is a fierce wallbreaker that can threaten Flying-type teams by luring in and beating Skarmory, Celesteela, and Mantine with Fire Blast and Stone Edge. Its Swords Dance sets are also able to beat physically defensive walls like Hippowdon and Mega Venusaur, allowing Excadrill to preserve its Z-Move.</p> "

Audino can easily take advantage of more passive walls like Miltank, Uxie, and Cramorant to pass a huge Wish while recovering with Regenerator. Protect pairs well with Wish, letting Audino safely take the Wish for itself, and it also lets Audino scout Choice-locked attackers such as Sawk, Cinccino, and Thwackey. Knock Off cripples Audino's checks such as Golbat and Skuntank. Thanks to its excellent longevity, Audino can work very well as a cleric with Heal Bell. Toxic is an alternative on teams that don't need Heal Bell or already have a cleric and lets Audino put its checks such as Calm Mind Alcremie, Gurdurr, and Alolan Persian on a timer. Heavy-Duty Boots makes Audino more effective at pivoting repeatedly, allowing it to scout more often and pass Wish more frequently. However, Leftovers lets it avoid the 2HKO from threatening attackers like Choice Specs Basculin, and it is the preferred item on teams with very sturdy entry hazard control.</p> <p>Audino appreciates being paired with physical walls such as Pyukumuku and Tangela. The former walls setup sweepers like Silvally formes that exploit Audino's passivity, while the latter can form a Regenerator core with Audino. Walls lacking recovery such as Uxie, Qwilfish, and Galarian Stunfisk and bulky attackers such as Silvally formes and Rhydon enjoy Wish support from Audino drastically improving their longevity. In particular, Silvally-Ground works well with Audino on balance teams, as it can block Volt Switch and prevent Trick and Switcheroo from foes such as Rotom and Manectric, keeping momentum versus them. Pokemon such as Altaria, Uxie, and Cofagrigus check Fighting-types that threaten Audino, while it handles special attackers such as Cryogonal and Rotom formes for them. Pokemon that can take advantage of Taunt users like Alolan Persian and Qwilfish such as Alcremie and Rotom, respectively, make for great partners.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Timburr's strong offensive typing, high Attack stat, and decent bulk make it a terrific glue Pokemon on a variety of team styles. It has an excellent movepool, including a strong STAB priority move in Mach Punch, semi-reliable recovery with Drain Punch, and a variety of coverage options including Knock Off, Fire Punch, Thunder Punch and Poison Jab. Furthermore, Defog makes Timburr one of the best entry hazard removers in the tier, especially since it resists Stealth Rock and can check common hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Onix. Timburr has two excellent abilities, allowing it to perform different roles on a team. Iron Fist increases immediate wallbreaking potential, while Guts allows Timburr to act as a status absorber. However, its typing leaves it weak to the common Flying-types in the tier, notably Vullaby and Wingull, and it is commonly walled by Poison- and Fairy-types such as Oddish and Spritzee. It is also limited by a mediocre Speed stat and has to run significant investment to attempt to outspeed its checks at the cost of offensive power or bulk.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Poison Jab is an alternative coverage move that allows Timburr to hit Spritzee hard, but the lack of coverage elsewhere means it should only be used on teams that struggle with Spritzee. Timburr can run multiple elemental punch moves to act as a lure for checks. Toxic is an option to reduce the longevity of bulky foes with reliable recovery such as Shellos, Spritzee, and Roost Vullaby.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Spritzee and Cottonee switch into Timburr and can KO it with their STAB Fairy-type attacks. Nasty Plot Spritzee is particularly threatening, as it can start setting up on Timburr. Both should be wary of Poison Jab, however.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Oddish, Mareanie, Croagunk, and Koffing are all able to switch into Timburr. Oddish can recover its health with Strength Sap, but it should be wary of switching into Ice Punch. Mareanie can set up Iron Defense against Timburr if it lacks Thunder Punch. Koffing completely walls Timburr regardless of coverage, while Croagunk can set up Nasty Plot against it. However, most of these Pokemon struggle to do significant damage to Timburr.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Vullaby and Wingull threaten Timburr with their strong STAB attacks, although they should be wary when switching in, since Timburr threatens them with Thunder Punch. Additionally, Vullaby is hit hard by Drain Punch, and Wingull is heavily damaged by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types such as Galarian Ponyta are particularly threatening because they can switch into Timburr and threaten to KO it with their STAB attacks. However, they should be wary of switching into Knock Off.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Drain Punch's recovery is important for keeping Timburr healthy and allowing it to face foes such as Onix and Ferroseed one-on-one. Mach Punch revenge kills faster threats such as Vullaby, Dragon Dance Scraggy, and Dragon Dance Onix. Knock Off allows Timburr to weaken all foes by removing their items while also hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types super effectively. Defog is used to remove all entry hazards on the field, helping teammates to switch in more easily. Thunder Punch hits Mareanie, Vullaby, and Dewpider which can otherwise switch into Timburr. Fire Punch hits Oddish and Croagunk hard and is more powerful in sun. Ice Punch can also be run to hit Oddish, Vullaby, and Mudbray super effectively.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread gives Timburr the ability to 2HKO key threats such as Mareanie and Oddish with the appropriate coverage move while maintaining significant bulk. Alternative EV spreads can be run to customize which foes Timburr will perform better against. For example, a spread of 76 HP / 196 Atk / 236 Def with an Adamant nature can be used so that Timburr isn't OHKOed by Adamant Vullaby's Brave Bird; this spread is also the best against opposing Timburr and other physical attackers such as Onix. It is worth noting that Timburr's Speed is also somewhat customizable. Running 156 Speed EVs allows it to outspeed anything up to 17 Speed after Sticky Web, and 76 Speed EVs outspeed standard defensive Oddish sets. Iron Fist is typically used on this set to improve the damage output of Drain Punch, Mach Punch, and coverage punches. Guts is an alternative option that allows Timburr to fare better against potential burns from Ponyta, Koffing, and other status users.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Timburr is an excellent switch-in to Ferroseed, Onix, and Pawniard and can generate offensive momentum by forcing them to switch out. It is good to keep the opponent guessing Timburr's moveset, since a Knock Off into a suitable coverage move can help make huge progress in a game. Early-game, Timburr should attempt to punish expected switches by using Knock Off. This can soften the opponent's team up for teammates to take advantage of late-game. Alternatively, it should use Defog on expected switches to remove entry hazards, particularly Sticky Web. Timburr can be used to counter common physical setup sweepers such as Onix and Shellder. If the team is weak to such sweepers, Timburr should be preserved to prevent a late-game sweep and should avoid having its item removed by Knock Off. If Guts is being used, Timburr can switch into expected Will-O-Wisp from Ponyta or Frillish to gain an Attack boost.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Flying-types such as Vullaby appreciate Timburr's ability to remove Stealth Rock and switch into Steel- and Rock-types such as Pawniard and Onix. Other Fighting-types, particularly Galarian Farfetch'd, can work with Timburr to break through their shared checks. This works particularly well because Timburr and Galarian Farfetch'd can distribute coverage moves between them, allowing them to break through any Fighting-type check. Setup sweepers such as Shellder and Dragon Dance Onix benefit greatly from Timburr wearing down their checks with Knock Off and chip damage. Fairy-types are a threat to Timburr, so Poison-types such as Mareanie and Oddish help it. The prevalence of Flying-types means that Timburr appreciates switch-ins such as Onix and Pawniard. Pawniard is a particularly good teammate because it can threaten Fairy-, Flying-, and Psychic-types such as Spritzee, Vullaby, and Galarian-Ponyta.</p> "

          "name": "Bulk Up",
          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bulk Up turns Timburr into a powerful sweeper that many teams will struggle to deal with. Drain Punch is the primary attack for this set, recovering health and boosting longevity. Mach Punch provides revenge killing utility, regardless of whether Timburr is boosted or not. Knock Off allows Timburr to weaken all foes by removing their items while also hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types super effectively. It also hits Poison-types like Mareanie and Koffing neutrally, making them more susceptible to Drain Punch. Thunder Punch can be used to hit Mareanie and Vullaby very hard, with Mareanie being particularly threatening because it can set up with Iron Defense. Fire Punch and Poison Jab are alternative coverage options in case the team has trouble with Oddish and Spritzee, respectively, but forgoing Thunder Punch will leave Timburr walled by Mareanie.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>236 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature and Eviolite prevent Timburr from being easily worn down by special attackers. For example, it significantly reduces the damage from Modest Vullaby's Air Slash, allowing Timburr to take the hit and recover most of the damage with Drain Punch. Guts is the preferred ability, since the boost from burns allows Timburr to take Mareanie one-on-one if it lacks Iron Defense. The EV spread can be customized to help Timburr set up on different foes. For example, it can forgo Special Defense investment in favor of Attack or Speed investment if the team otherwise handles special attackers very well.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is best used as a late-game sweeper when its checks have been sufficiently weakened. Try to weaken and pressure Timburr's checks, primarily Spritzee and Oddish, by removing their items and keeping them at low health. Timburr can use Knock Off early-game to make a late-game sweep easier. It can also still act as a check to Rock- and Steel-types, primarily Onix and Pawniard. However, it should be used sparingly against them so that it can retain its item and stay close to full health to help a late-game sweep. It is worth noting that Timburr cannot 2HKO Eviolite Onix with Drain Punch or OHKO Pawniard with Mach Punch, but it can use them as setup opportunities. It is best to use Bulk Up on expected switches and foes that struggle to deal significant damage to Timburr, such as Ferroseed. The uncommonness of the Bulk Up set means that Timburr can bluff a standard bulky attacker set and catch the opponent off guard by setting up later in the game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Flying-types like Vullaby can help by switching into and threatening Oddish, which walls Timburr with Strength Sap. Knock Off users such as Vullaby and Pawniard can help weaken Timburr's checks to make a late-game sweep easier. Timburr in turn helps Vullaby by switching into Rock-types like Onix, and Timburr can work with Pawniard to break through defensive cores. Pawniard is a particularly good partner because it punishes Oddish's Strength Sap with Defiant and puts Spritzee under pressure with Knock Off and Iron Head. Switch-ins to Fairy-types such as Ferroseed and Mareanie also help, since they can help pressure Spritzee. Mareanie is particularly useful, as it can remove Toxic Spikes and set Toxic Spikes itself to help wear down Spritzee. Flying-type checks such as Onix and Pawniard are able to switch into threats such as Vullaby. Entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed, Dwebble, and Onix help Timburr by damaging its checks, potentially putting them in KO range. Hazard removal from the likes of Drilbur and Vullaby is also appreciated, since Spikes and Toxic Spikes in particular wear Timburr down.</p> "

STAB Mach Punch is also a great tool, functioning as a strong priority attack that can threaten faster Pokemon like Mamoswine and Lycanroc-D. Conkeldurr is a bit weighed down by its proneness to being worn down from Flame Orb, however. This is made a larger problem by its poor Speed, which allows the tier's many faster threats to overwhelm it, as well as its iffy defensive typing, which doesn't give it many notable resistances and leaves it open to Pokemon like Moltres, Primarina, and Salamence. Conkeldurr also faces competition from Fighting-types like Buzzwole and Keldeo, which provide solid secondary typings and better Speed tiers. Conkeldurr struggles to break through physically defensive Buzzwole, as it can shrug off multiple Facade's.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Bulk Up set with investment in Special Defense can function as a solid bulky sweeper, though it can struggle to make consistent progress with the tier's many strong Fairy- and Psychic-types. Conkeldurr could hold Assault Vest to more easily switch into Scald from Pokemon like Tentacruel and Quagsire while also checking special attackers such as Nihilego. However, this often prevents it from being able to maximize its offensive potential, and it is still quite prone to being worn down. Poison Jab is a coverage option that hits Fairy-types super effectively, but Conkeldurr can usually muscle through them with Facade.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Buzzwole: Physically defensive Buzzwole can comfortably wall Conkeldurr and beat it through the combination of Drain Punch and Roost. Even offensive variants can afford to stomach a Facade and retaliate back with a powerful Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Conkeldurr's low Speed and Flame Orb use leave it quite vulnerable to being overwhelmed by faster Pokemon. Azelf, Nidoking, and Azumarill outspeed Conkeldurr, resist Mach Punch, and can pressure it with powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types: Reuniclus and Galarian Slowbro can take Knock Off from full HP while severely damaging Conkeldurr with STAB Psychic-type attacks.

Togekiss can also be a solid check, 4x resisting Conkeldurr's STAB moves and revenge killing it with Air Slash. Moltres resists Mach Punch and can power through Conkeldurr with Hurricane.

Many matchups may require or benefit from Mach Punch, such as Sawk, Crustle, and Galarian Darmanitan.

It can set up Stealth Rock early-game and threaten other entry hazard users like Piloswine and Koffing with its STAB attacks. Earth Power can nail common physical attackers like Klang and Raboot that Palpitoad has no problem switching into. Scald has a chance to burn physical attackers like Golbat and Fraxure that may switch in on Palpitoad and can also wear down defensive Pokemon that lack recovery like Hattrem and Charjabug. On the other hand, Sludge Bomb nails Grass-types like Tangela and Thwackey; the latter otherwise could Substitute safely on Palpitoad. Toxic is great for crippling walls that shrug off Palpitoad's attacks like Galarian Corsola and Togetic.</p> <p>Palpitoad is a good check to some physical attackers, but its lack of recovery and immediate firepower makes it vulnerable to multiple foes. Palpitoad should avoid setting up Stealth Rock if Magic Bounce users are on the opposing team, as Hattrem especially can shrug off Palpitoad's attacks and threatens back with Giga Drain. Try pairing it with Dark- and Steel-types like Galarian Linoone and Klang to help with these situations. Palpitoad also struggles against other entry hazard setters like Ferroseed and Roselia, so having anti-entry hazard Pokemon like Hattrem and Vullaby is worthwhile. Additionally, being 4x weak to Grass-type attacks is dangerous, which walls like Ferroseed, Golbat, and Charjabug can all help patch; in return, Palpitoad functions as a Fire-type switch-in for these three. As Palpitoad worries about strong special wallbreakers like Kadabra, special walls like Galarian Corsola and Klang can help make a defensive backbone for the rest of the team. Palpitoad is also susceptible to being worn down from status, Knock Off, and multiple physical attacks. Try to either have other physical walls with reliable recovery and support with Wish and Heal Bell from users like Clefairy.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Seismitoad is an important defensive Pokemon in RU due to its excellent typing, ability, and utility movepool. Its typing and Water Absorb allow it to deal with threats such as Raikou, Metagross, Darmanitan, and Entei. Seismitoad can also act as a Stealth Rock setter, and it has access to important utility moves in Knock Off and Toxic, allowing it to take advantage of all the free turns it gets. Seismitoad is an incredibly reliable user of Knock Off, and it is able to remove important items from checks such as Togekiss and Zarude. The latter is an important part of VoltTurn teams, allowing Seismitoad to pressure such teams by removing Heavy-Duty Boots. Seismitoad's decent offensive movepool and Swift Swim also make it a key addition to rain teams, where it provides them with an Electric immunity and Stealth Rock while being a threatening sweeper in its own right. However, Seismitoad's quadruple weakness to Grass can lead to problems for it, as the Grass-type Zarude is one of the tier's most ubiquitous Pokemon and doesn't mind most of Seismitoad's attacks, and others such as Roserade and Vileplume can also give it problems. Most viable RU teams carry Grass-types due to their defensive and offensive utility, so this is a major issue. This weakness also prevents Seismitoad from properly using its Electric-immunity in many cases, as Xurkitree carries Grass-type coverage, and another threatening Electric-type in Toxtricity doesn't care much about Seismitoad, as Boomburst does way too much damage for Seismitoad to consider switching into it directly and OHKOes it after just a bit of chip damage. Therefore, Seismitoad is not suitable as a team's only form of counterplay to the tier's Electric-types, necessitating other checks. Seismitoad also lacks reliable recovery outside of Leftovers, meaning that it can get worn down over the course of a match. This is compounded by the fact that Pokemon it otherwise checks often carry pivoting moves or Toxic, such as Darmanitan, Volcanion, and Diancie.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Protect can be used on the defensive set to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Toxtricity and Mienshao while also letting Seismitoad safely get more out of its Leftovers, but it is rather hard to fit onto the moveset. Sludge Wave is viable on the rain sweeper set, as it hits Celebi while still pushing damage onto Zarude, but it does significantly less damage to Zarude than Focus Blast. Choice Band variants can be used outside of rain, but such sets tend to be very prediction-reliant and do not effectively utilize Seismitoad's defensive presence.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type coverage: Seismitoad is greatly threatened by the Grass-types of the tier, including Zarude, Roserade, Vileplume, and Celebi. Grass-type coverage is also rather common on Pokemon that Seismitoad would otherwise check, such as Xurkitree.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers: Seismitoad's tendency to invest heavily in physical bulk leaves it open to powerful special attackers such as Toxtricity, Gardevoir, Reuniclus, and Chandelure.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Seismitoad's reliance on Leftovers for recovery leaves it open to getting chipped down over the course of a match. This is compounded should Seismitoad take Knock Off, and Pokemon that Seismitoad would otherwise be able to handle, such as Volcanion, often run Toxic, leaving Seismitoad even more vulnerable to being worn down.</p> ",

Seismitoad is not an adequate check to most Electric-types on its own due to their penchant to run Grass-type coverage. Bulky Grass-types such as Zarude, Vileplume, Roserade, and Celebi can help out against Xurkitree, while bulky special walls, such as Diancie and Porygon2, can work against Toxtricity. Seismitoad also needs good Grass answers to cover its only weakness. This can take the form of options such as Togekiss, Cobalion, and Crobat. The former two in particular are solid checks to Zarude, the most common Grass-type in the tier. Seismitoad's ability to cripple and wear down the opposition is appreciated by a myriad of offensive teammates. Late-game cleaners and sweepers, in particular, appreciate Seismitoad spreading status and removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers.

Scald gives Seismitoad a chance to burn switch-ins such as Kommo-o and Tapu Bulu. It also provides long-term chip damage on Amoonguss so it does not get the most out of Regenerator. Earthquake gives Seismitoad a better matchup against Calm Mind users like Keldeo and Galarian Slowbro at the cost of reducing Scald's damage output. Earth Power is usable to hit targets like Kommo-o harder but is generally not worth it, as Seismitoad now becomes setup fodder for the aforementioned Keldeo and Galarian Slowbro, and Earth Power fails to OHKO Nihilego. Toxic makes Seismitoad less passive against the likes of Tangrowth and Gastrodon switching in. It also helps Seismitoad outlast other Defoggers such as Salamence and Rotom-W.

Knock Off targets Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Rotom, Gourgeist-S, and Uxie while also crippling common switch-ins such as Cofagrigus, Clefairy, and Tangela. Earthquake hits Poison-types such as Silvally-Poison, Qwilfish, and Skuntank. Stone Edge lets Sawk deal with Flying-types such as Rotom-S, Altaria, and Golbat. Mold Breaker allows Sawk to hit Levitate users such as Uxie and Rotom with Earthquake. Alternatively, Inner Focus allows Sawk to beat Qwilfish with Earthquake, as Inner Focus nullifies its Intimidate, and not flinch from Kangaskhan's Fake Out. However, don't expect to get free turns from Kangaskhan trying to flinch you, as the opponent should notice the absent Mold Breaker activation message.</p> <p>While Sawk has super effective coverage for Pokemon that resist or are immune to Close Combat, it still needs physical walls such as Cofagrigus, Tangela, and Altaria to be weakened in order to KO them and successfully clean. Therefore, special attackers such as Skuntank, Rotom, and Basculin that can deal with them make for great partners. Entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed, Piloswine, and Qwilfish help to wear down Sawk's common switch-ins, as most do not have access to reliable recovery. Pivots such as Uxie, Rotom-S, and Wishiwashi circumvent Sawk's mediocre bulk by safely bringing it onto the field, with the former also having access to Future Sight, which dissuades Poison-types from switching in.</p> "

It should also be noted that Gardevoir is an outlier, as it is a Choice item Trick user that is able to defeat Whimsicott due to Trace, which allows for a Prankster Trick. Whimsicott primarily struggles with Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed, so Fire-types such as Arcanine and Incineroar make great partners. Whimsicott, in return, helps with their weak matchups against Water-types such as Primarina and Dracovish. Whimsicott also struggles with Ice-types and Dark-types not weak to Moonblast such as Avalugg, Galarian Darmanitan, and Incineroar, making Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and Sawk great partners. Whimsicott, in return, helps them against Fairy-types such as Primarina.</p> "

Knock Off has the benefit of removing items from bulky threats such as Porygon2, Mandibuzz, and Blissey, making them easier to deal with.

Earthquake is also useful for SubToxic Aegislash, as it doesn't activate King's Shield, unlike Flare Blitz. U-turn safely brings in a teammate to deal with a check to Galarian Darmanitan like Rotom-W or Galarian Corsola. Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature allows Galarian Darmanitan to outspeed foes like Mega Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Excadrill. Galarian Darmanitan should be used to clean weakened teams late-game once bulky walls such as Porygon2 and Swampert are severely weakened or removed. Due to its poor bulk and vulnerability to entry hazards, notably Stealth Rock, it should avoid switching in excessively.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales is useful in order to deal with bulky Water-types that pressure Galarian Darmanitan such as Tapu Fini, Rotom-W, and Mega Slowbro with Freeze-Dry, as well as Fighting-types like Keldeo. Additionally, it provides valuable support with Aurora Veil. Avalugg is an extremely useful defensive teammate to deal with physical threats that outspeed Galarian Darmanitan such as Choice Scarf Weavile, Mega Swampert in rain, and Barraskewda in rain. It also removes entry hazards for it with Rapid Spin. Defensive Cloyster can also remove entry hazards and provides Spikes and Toxic Spikes support. Choice Specs Kyurem deals with physically defensive walls such as Porygon2, Galarian Corsola, and Swampert for Galarian Darmanitan due to its power and amazing coverage. Mamoswine is a good offensive partner with Galarian Darmanitan, crippling its usual checks like Galarian Corsola and Porygon2 with Knock Off while acting as a secondary way to deal with Steel teams. It also appreciates Galarian Darmanitan forcing out Steel-types like Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory, which Mamoswine needs chip damage on to successfully KO. Piloswine can be used instead as a great wall to deal with Fire-types like Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Volcarona thanks to the combination of Thick Fat and Eviolite. It also provides Stealth Rock support for Galarian Darmanitan while dealing with other special attackers like Tapu Koko, Nihilego, and Alolan Raichu. Choice Scarf Weavile can greatly help in the Ghost and Psychic matchups, dealing with faster Choice Scarf users like Latias, Jirachi, and Blacephalon.</p> "

    "lc": {
      "overview": "<p>With access to Stealth Rock and Spikes, along with the ability to beat the tier's most common Defogger, Dwebble is one of the leading entry hazard stackers in the tier. Shell Smash coupled with a decent Attack stat also allows it to become a dangerous sweeper; these two sets require significantly different counterplay, which can trip an unprepared opponent up. Sturdy gives Dwebble opportunities to set entry hazards or use Shell Smash. However, its mediocre defensive typing gives it very few resistances, and its reliance on its item leaves it susceptible to Knock Off. Additionally, it faces competition from Ferroseed, which can also set the same entry hazards while offering more defensive utility, although it lacks the offensive presence that Dwebble's Shell Smash set provides. It also faces competition from Onix, which is faster and has a better offensive typing. Onix can run Sturdy sets too, though it tends not to, leaving Dwebble as the tier's best Sturdy user.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Weak Armor set can be run with a spread of 36 HP / 156 Atk / 76 Def / 236 Spe alongside a Jolly nature and Eviolite. This functions similarly to the suicide lead set, but it finds it easier to set hazards against Knock Off users while being able to check Vullaby. Dwebble can choose to run a Bug-type STAB move; this offers no meaningful coverage, however. The Shell Smash set can run Aerial Ace to hit Timburr and Mienfoo, but this still doesn't KO them at +2 and generally isn’t worthwhile.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: While Timburr and Mienfoo don't like getting hit by Knock Off, they can counter all Dwebble sets - Eviolite sets survive any move from Dwebble even at +2. Timburr is particularly threatening, as it can heal back up with Drain Punch, remove entry hazards with Defog, and KO Dwebble with priority Mach Punch. Mienfoo can break its Sturdy with Fake Out and then KO Dwebble with High Jump Kick.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Staryu is able to remove Dwebble's entry hazards with Rapid Spin, gaining a Speed boost while doing so, while taking any hit from the Shell Smash set and OHKO it in return. Corphish has access to Knock Off and Aqua Jet, allowing it to easily beat Dwebble one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit moves: Multi-hit moves hinder all Dwebble sets, as they can break through Sturdy and potentially OHKO it. Onix with Rock Blast is particularly threatening, as it outspeeds Dwebble and hits it super effectively.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types are threatening, since Dwebble lacks the coverage to hit them super effectively. Mudbray is particularly threatening because it gains Defense boosts from each hit.</p> <p><strong>Ferroseed: Ferroseed can take any hit from the Shell Smash set, even at +2, and use Knock Off and Thunder Wave to hinder both Dwebble sets.</p> <p><strong>Grookey</strong>: While it is unable to switch directly into Dwebble, Grookey can revenge kill Dwebble with Grassy Glide.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock damages and wears down every Pokemon in the metagame. Spikes is useful to damage all grounded foes. Knock Off allows Dwebble to remove the foe's item to help its teammates. Counter can be used to OHKO a physical foe such as Timburr if it chooses to attack. Rock Blast is a terrifying multi-hit STAB attack, threatening to OHKO foes like Berry Juice Vullaby and frail threats like Abra and Dewpider that have a Focus Sash. Alternatively, Earthquake can be used to deal more damage to Rock-resistant foes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum EVs and a Speed-boosting nature are used to get out as many entry hazards as possible before being KOed. Maximum Attack is used because Dwebble relies on Sturdy and Berry Juice for longevity, meaning it has no need for defensive investment. There are enough remaining EVs to increase its HP stat, but this is avoided so that Berry Juice is guaranteed to fully restore its health and reactivate Sturdy. Sturdy guarantees that Dwebble can take a hit from full HP, giving it an extra turn to set entry hazards. Another option is to run a Hasty nature with 0 Defense IVs, which allows Dwebble to OHKO Timburr and offensive Mienfoo with Counter if they use Knock Off.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As the name of this set indicates, Dwebble is used as a lead. The main objective of this set is to put up multiple entry hazards before being KOed. However, preserving Dwebble can be advantageous in some situations where it can be sacrificed later in the game to provide offensive momentum. Typically, Dwebble will rarely be using its offensive moves, since the utility of stacking entry hazards is preferable to the utility of Knock Off or other offensive moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Offensive teams benefit most from Dwebble, as they can pressure the opponent and make it difficult for them to find an opportunity to remove entry hazards. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Scraggy and Nasty Plot Vullaby appreciate entry hazards breaking Sturdy on their foes and wearing down their checks. Pawniard can punish Defog with Defiant and therefore makes for a good partner. Frillish is immune to Rapid Spin and is able to switch in against the most prominent user of the move, Staryu, making it a good pick on entry hazard-stacking teams. Having a Rapid Spin user on the team is useful for removing entry hazards from your side of the field. Offensive threats such as Grookey, Abra, and Choice Scarf Mienfoo appreciate hazard support, as it helps to put their checks in range of an OHKO.</p> "

          "name": "Shell Smash Sweeper",
          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shell Smash raises Dwebble's Attack and Speed by 2 stages, drastically increasing its power and allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Rock Blast is generally the preferred STAB move, as it is the most accurate Rock-type move with good power and will often hit at least as hard as Rock Slide due to Little Cup's low HP totals. It also breaks through Focus Sash and Sturdy users. Alternatively, Stone Edge can be chosen for more consistent damage, if it hits, and to bypass Berry Juice on foes like Weak Armor Vullaby. Earthquake is Dwebble's best coverage move, hitting the Rock-resistant Pawniard and Onix super effectively, and it gets a neutral hit against other foes like Timburr and Mudbray. Knock Off provides good neutral coverage, with the utility of removing the foe's Eviolite and weakening them. Counter and Stealth Rock are niche alternative moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack EVs and an Attack-boosting nature are used to optimize Dwebble's sweeping power. Maximum Speed EVs allow Dwebble to outspeed the entire metagame after a Shell Smash boost, only tying with the rare Choice Scarf Diglett. There is no HP investment to ensure that Berry Juice reactivates Sturdy. Sturdy guarantees that Dwebbles survives one hit when at full health, allowing it to take a hit while setting up. Berry Juice restores its HP to full, which reduces Dwebble’s susceptibility to being picked off by weak priority moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to avoid switching Dwebble into entry hazards at all costs, since this will stop Sturdy from activating and will prevent a safe setup with Shell Smash. Avoid being hit by Knock Off as well, since Dwebble's item is important to give it setup opportunities. Dwebble should be used as a late-game sweeper, setting up when its checks are sufficiently weakened. Try to bring Dwebble in on a free switch, such as after a Pokemon has fainted or via a slow U-turn, so it doesn't lose its Berry Juice early by switching into an attack. Weaken or remove bulky Pokemon like Mudbray, Spritzee, and Timburr before attempting to sweep with Dwebble, because they can take even a boosted hit and retaliate for lots of damage. Try to remove priority move users, as they can easily pick off Dwebble after its defenses are lowered by Shell Smash. With Sturdy intact, Dwebble can also act as a countermeasure for opposing sweepers that don't have multi-hit moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazards from Pokemon like Ferroseed and Pawniard wear down opposing Pokemon, allowing Dwebble to KO more foes. A teammate that provides entry hazard removal such as Staryu, Defog Timburr, or Vullaby, is essential for helping to preserve Dwebble's Sturdy. Pokemon that can bring Dwebble in safely like U-turn Mienfoo and Vullaby are good partners. Pokemon like Giga Drain Ferroseed and Staryu that deal with bulky Ground-types are helpful. Mareanie and Spritzee are good team choices as well because they can deal with Timburr. Trappers such as Diglett and Wynaut help Dwebble by removing or weakening its defensive checks. Knock Off support from Pokemon like Timburr and Mareanie is appreciated, since very few Pokemon will be able to take Dwebble's boosted moves without an Eviolite.</p> "

Weak Armor with Focus Sash provides more Speed so that Dwebble has a better matchup against some leads like Raboot and Fake Out Pikachu, but the lack of an Eviolite combined with the Defense drop makes Dwebble less reliable for setting entry hazards against Pokemon like Clefairy and Piloswine.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gurdurr: By resisting both of Dwebble's attacks, using Defog to clear entry hazards, and stopping Shell Smash sweeps with Mach Punch, Gurdurr is a consistent counter to Dwebble. Dwebble's best bet is to be paired with sweepers that require Gurdurr's Eviolite removed to sweep, or else it will be squandered versus it.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Dwebble's special bulk is unsalvageable, and practically any offensive special attacker can 2HKO it. However, thanks to Sturdy, frailer attackers like Galarian Mr. Mime and Magmar fear Shell Smash and Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Wartortle stomachs Dwebble's attacks while hitting back hard, and after Sturdy activates, it uses Rapid Spin to remove any entry hazards. Mareanie and Marshtomp threaten with Scald, but they may lose their Eviolite in the process.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Leads: Bulkier Pokemon like Tangela and Gabite are able to take on Dwebble, although they could be annoyed by Knock Off and are unable to prevent Dwebble's first entry hazard attempt.

Shell Smash gives Dwebble an opportunity to put a large dent into the opposing team while outspeeding faster special attackers like Electabuzz and Gastly.</p> <p>Use Dwebble as a lead to set entry hazards immediately or boost with Shell Smash for early momentum.

Spinblockers like Drakloak and Lampent are good teammates for Dwebble, since they can prevent its entry hazards from being removed, while Pokemon like Electabuzz and Taunt Golbat pressure Defog users. Setup sweepers like Klang and Fraxure appreciate the chip damage to wear down their checks.

Crustle's access to the offensively strong Rock typing, alongside a powerful move in Rock Wrecker and utility options in Rock Blast and Shell Smash, gives it the potential to be one of the most powerful setup attackers in the metagame, utterly destroying nearly anything that does not resist Rock Wrecker, like Hydreigon, Aromatisse, and Snorlax, after a Shell Smash. Counter is incredibly useful for some physical attackers as well; Choice Scarf Dracovish and Dracozolt will beat Crustle if it uses Shell Smash, but will fall after being hit by Counter, as Crustle will always survive their attacks. Golisopod can also sometimes survive a Rock Wrecker from Crustle and is unsafe to set up against, but Crustle will still win by using Counter turn one by either KOing Golisopod or putting it in range of a Rock Wrecker. Crustle runs 128 HP and 20 Defense EVs in order to survive a Choice Band Iron Tail from Haxorus, as well as maximizing HP in order to get Choice Band Snorlax into Rock Wrecker range after a Counter. 164 Speed is run in order to outspeed Rock Tomb Dracovish after a Shell Smash. Lum Berry can be used to threaten Yawn Sylveon and Stall Rotom-A, whereas Mental Herb is very helpful against Taunt users like Haxorus and Whimsicott, both ensuring Crustle can set up with Shell Smash and threaten offensively.</p> <p>Crustle works well with frailer threats that need Sturdy support in order to beat the Pokemon they cannot threaten offensively. Pokemon like Dracovish, Dragapult, Galarian Darmanitan, and Dracozolt all appreciate Crustle's ability to tank hits from offensive threats like Choice Scarf Haxorus, non-Quick Attack Sylveon, and all of their ditto matchups. In return, these offensive powerhouses generally have a good matchup against the bulky stall Pokemon that can beat Crustle, like Corviknight and Arcanine. Crustle appreciates Pokemon that can also beat Steel-type Pokemon, that can generally survive any one attack Crustle can go for, even after a Shell Smash—Pokemon like Aegislash, Duraladon, Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp can usually handle Crustle, although the physical Steel-types need to watch out for Counter. Therefore, Fire- and Fighting-types like Arcanine, Sawk, and Conkeldurr will be great partners for Crustle, as they can generally handle these Steel-type threats.</p> "

Rock Blast, though relying on rolls for some of its matchups, will always take down Volcarona and FEAR Togedemaru, and can potentially take down opposing Shell Smash Crustle. Earthquake helps Crustle against non-Air Balloon Aegislash and Choice Band Steelix. Counter allows Crustle to take down Choice item threats like Urshifu-S, Dracovish, and Conkeldurr that would normally 2HKO Crustle and take one of its hits. Heavy Slam alternatively helps Crustle beat non-Babiri Berry Sylveon and Whimsicott more reliably. The given spread allows for Crustle to always survive the rare Choice Band-boosted Iron Tail from Mold Breaker Haxorus and KO them back with Rock Wrecker. 29 Speed IVs and a Brave nature allow Crustle to underspeed Aegislash and OHKO non-Air Balloon Blade forme variants.

Life Orb Salazzle is another exception due to it being able to bypass Sturdy with Fake Out and then almost always OHKO Crustle with Overheat. Pixie Plate Sylveon is an exceptional partner for Crustle due to it being able to break through a lot of Pokemon that Crustle normally can't beat, like stall and Sturdy users, while also generally beating a lot of Pokemon that resist Crustle's attacks. Pokemon that Sylveon can cover for Crustle include Dragapult, Urshifu-R, stall Azumarill, Rotom-W, Galarian Corsola, and Sawk, among other threats. Assault Vest Primarina is another Fairy-type that can be used as a teammate, able to take out threats such as Arcanine, Salazzle, and Skarmory, though it is more prone to stall Pokemon.

Its unique typing gives it access to STAB on strong moves such as High Jump Kick, Knock Off, and Drain Punch. Its access to Knock Off also allows it to support other teammates by removing items from opposing Pokemon and helps it sweep with powerful moves such as High Jump Kick, while coverage moves help it break through its checks. Its solid bulk gives it opportunities to set up with Dragon Dance and be a potent sweeper. Scraggy also has the option of two abilities to help it sweep: Moxie allows it to become stronger every time it KOes a foe, while Shed Skin allows it to set up on status inducers. Unfortunately, Scraggy's typing leaves it very weak to Fairy-types and common Flying- and Fighting-types. Additionally, Scraggy must pick between its potential coverage moves, leaving it walled by one of its checks. Lastly, Scraggy lacks immediate power and needs support to break through its checks despite its coverage options.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be run with Moxie to form a potent sweeper, but it struggles to break through its checks due to its lack of immediate damage. Poison Jab can be used to hit Morelull and Cottonee harder, but the flinches from Iron Head are generally more useful. An Intimidate support set can be run to set up on physical attackers, particularly Onix, but it misses out on the sweeping potential that Scraggy has. Alternatively, Bulk Up can be run in tandem with Dragon Dance and Drain Punch to form a bulky sweeper with decent recovery.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Spritzee resists both of Scraggy's STAB moves and OHKOes it in return. Nasty Plot Spritzee sets can be broken through more easily, however. It should also be wary of Iron Head and Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Oddish and Mareanie resist Scraggy's Fighting STAB attacks and do not take much damage from Knock Off.

High Jump Kick is a powerful STAB attack used for breaking through neutral targets. For example, +1 High Jump Kick OHKOes most Berry Juice Vullaby sets after Stealth Rock damage. However, Drain Punch can be used for its recovery and to avoid taking damage from misses. Knock Off hits Ghost- and Psychic-types that resist Scraggy's Fighting STAB attack, with the extra utility of removing the target's item. Iron Head is used for hitting Fairy-types like Spritzee, while Zen Headbutt is an option for hitting Fighting- and Poison-types such as Croagunk, Oddish, and Mareanie.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This set has Speed and Attack maximized to help its sweeping ability, with an Adamant ability to improve the damage rolls on defensive foes such as Eviolite Spritzee. Berry Juice helps Scraggy set up on defensive Pokemon that lack the ability to OHKO it, such as Mareanie and Ferroseed. Alternatively, Eviolite can be used so that Scraggy can set up on more offensive foes such as Pawniard and Onix. If you're running Berry Juice, the remaining EVs should be invested in HP for extra mixed bulk; they should be invested in Defense or Special Defense if using Eviolite so that the benefit of Eviolite can be maximized. Moxie is preferred as the ability for its greater sweeping potential, with the drawback being that it gives Scraggy a harder time setting up compared to Shed Skin. Alternatively, Shed Skin allows Scraggy to absorb status ailments, most notably burns, giving it a good chance of shaking the status off while setting up on Pokemon such as Mareanie and Ponyta.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Scraggy is best used as a late-game sweeper and should set up when its checks are suitably weakened. It should try to set up on Dark-types such as Pawniard, Rock-types such as Onix, or Steel-types such as Ferroseed. These are all threatened by Scraggy's Fighting STAB moves and struggle to OHKO it even without Eviolite. If Shed Skin is being used, set up on status users such as Mareanie and Ferroseed. Try to use Knock Off early- and mid-game on Scraggy's checks to make a late-game sweep easier to achieve. Avoid letting Scraggy accrue too much damage prior to setting up so that it is less vulnerable to priority moves. Scraggy will struggle to sweep if its checks are insufficiently worn down. Spritzee and Timburr are particularly threatening, since Scraggy struggles to break through the former even with Iron Head, while the latter threatens it with Mach Punch.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Knock Off users such as Vullaby make good partners by making opposing Pokemon easier for Scraggy to break when set up. Dual screens users like Natu can give Scraggy multiple setup opportunities in the same match and also leave it less susceptible to priority moves. Scraggy can be used in a core stacking Fighting-types with Timburr or Galarian Farfetch'd, since they have access to Knock Off and useful coverage moves for wearing down their shared checks. Pivots such as Vullaby and Chinchou provide good support by safely bringing Scraggy in, either by slow pivoting or by using their pivot move on a predicted switch. Entry hazard removers such as Timburr and Vullaby are useful, since Scraggy struggles to sweep with Sticky Web present, and removing layers of Spikes helps keep Scraggy out of range of priority attacks. Diglett can use Memento to give Scraggy a good setup opportunity while also being able to trap key threats. Pokemon that can pressure Spritzee and Timburr, such as Mareanie and Oddish, also make great teammates.</p> "

Scrafty's typing also has its ups and downs offensively, as it is able to hit most of the tier neutrally, but Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Silvally-Fairy completely wall it if it is not running coverage. While Scrafty's defenses are good, its Attack is underwhelming without boosts and its Speed is very mediocre, with it still being outsped even at +1 by Pokemon such as Ribombee and Whimsicott.</p> ",

This is furthered by its combination of Rest and Shed Skin, which makes Scrafty harder to wear down and cripple with status conditions, although Shed Skin can be unreliable at times. Drain Punch also helps keep Scrafty healthy, while Knock Off does decent damage while crippling Pokemon that may depend on their items such as Ribombee and Choice Scarf Passimian. Scrafty prefers to start setting up after threats to it such as Passimian and Aromatisse have been taken out, so Pokemon that can help against those such as Uxie, Togedemaru, and Rotom make for good teammates.</p> "},

Iron Head hits Fairy-types like Silvally-Fairy and Aromatisse. Lum Berry gives Scrafty one-time protection from status conditions that would otherwise make it much harder to sweep, but Chople Berry can instead be used to take moves such as Close Combat from Choice Scarf Passimian, which still outspeeds +1 Scrafty, and Hitmontop's Mach Punch. Shed Skin can be run if using a Chople Berry so Scrafty can still set up against status inflicting Pokemon like Jellicent. Good teammates are Pokemon that can help against faster threats such as Ribombee and the previously mentioned Choice Scarf Passimian. Both Silvally-Fairy and Silvally-Steel make for good teammates, as they can check these threats and bring Scrafty onto the field with Parting Shot. Wallbreakers like Magmortar and Vikavolt can weaken bulky Pokemon such as Weezing and Aromatisse, making it easier for Scrafty to clean up the match.</p> "

Calm Mind allows Sigilyph to leverage its offensive presence and break through bulkier opposition. Defog, on the other hand, can be utilized on teams that have sufficient wallbreaking power but are weak to entry hazards, leveraging its good matchup versus common hazard setters in the tier such as Steelix and Roserade. Air Slash is an alternative that can be considered over Psychic to hit Incineroar, which walls this entire set otherwise. However, this would miss out on hitting key targets such as Diancie, Raikou, and Toxtricity. If running Calm Mind, Psyshock can be used over Psychic to have the edge in Calm Mind wars against Suicune.

Despite Chesto Berry usually being run to give Cofagrigus a one-time instant recovery option alongside Rest, running no item makes it harder to pressure with Poltergeist and Knock Off users such as Froslass, Gourgeist-S, and Passimian. The Speed investment lets it outspeed Galarian Stunfisk, and the remaining EVs combined with a Bold nature bolster Cofagrigus's physical bulk, which improves its durability and the damage output of Body Press. Alternatively, a specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 240 SpD / 20 Spe with a Calm nature allows it to take special hits better at the cost of its physical bulk and attacking power. Cofagrigus should be paired with Pokemon that can cover for it against special attackers; these include blanket special walls such as Gigalith and Lanturn.

Archeops fits best on offensive teams, and it should primarily be brought in via safe switches in to wallbreak or revenge kill threats such as Galarian Articuno and Magmortar, as its lack of defensive utility prevents it from getting many free turns otherwise. For this reason, partners with pivoting moves like Ribombee and Whimsicott work well with Archeops, and they form a pivot core if Archeops is using U-turn. Lanturn is another partner that can bring Archeops in safely, and it can absorb both Water- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Archeops as well as provide an additional check to Togedemaru. Froslass can help pressure many of Archeops's checks, like Palossand and Rhydon thanks to its access to Spikes, notably bringing walls like Jellicent into 2HKO range of Stone Edge.

Similarly, physical attackers that commonly carry Earthquake like Aerodactyl, Drapion, and Toxicroak can easily bypass Garbodor too.</p> <p><strong>Xatu: Garbodor's damage output isn't significant enough to threaten Xatu unless it poisons Xatu with Gunk Shot.

This is an especially viable option, since most opponents will go for super effective moves against Gothitelle given its bulk.</p> <p>Gothitelle fits best on bulkier builds, since its defensive nature and relatively low Speed would cost more offensive teams too much momentum. Dark-types like Pawniard and Galarian Linoone completely wall Gothitelle if its only attacking move is Stored Power. Fighting-types like Hitmontop and Throh are important teammates to have because of this, with the former also removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin and the latter wearing teams down through the combination of Circle Throw and Knock Off. Strong attackers like Silvally-Bug, Choice Specs Glaceon, and Nasty Plot Raichu can overwhelm Gothitelle faster than it can boost, meaning that teammates to pressure these wallbreakers, like Lapras and Roselia, are appreciated. Roselia can also pressure opposing teams with Spikes and Toxic Spikes, making it easier for Gothitelle to sweep. Silvally formes like Silvally-Bug and Silvally-Electric can also be useful partners, providing support through blocking Trick and Switcheroo from Mr. Mime and Manectric, breaking through foes like Mawile, and potentially removing entry hazards with Defog. In return, Gothitelle can absorb status conditions and set up on potential revenge killers like Manectric locked into Overheat. Pairing Gothitelle with Dark-types, notably Taunt Pawniard, can prevent a potential stalemate against opposing bulky Stored Power users like Musharna and Duosion.</p> "

This allows it to provide invaluable support to offensive teammates such as Zacian-C, Zygarde-C, and Xerneas that may otherwise struggle to sweep. It also potentially removes the opponent's control in the hazard game by trapping and removing entry hazard setters and Defoggers. Rest is mandatory in order for Gothitelle to avoid status while also wasting more of the opponent's PP. Shadow Tag prevents the foe from switching out and take taking advantage of the passiveness of a sleeping Gothitelle. Taunt is invaluable, as it denies phazing from Ho-Oh and Lugia and can help prevent foes from setting up or removing hazards. It also limits the moves the opponent can choose from, conserving Gothitelle's PP. Charm weakens trapped foes such as Necrozma-DM, Zygarde-C, and Ho-Oh, preventing them from harming Gothitelle at all outside of critical hits. Cosmic Power further boosts Gothitelle's bulk and allows it to safely trap special attacking threats such as support Arceus formes. The chosen spread maximizes Gothitelle's physical bulk while letting it outspeed Necrozma-DM. Leftovers is generally the preferred item for passive recovery, though Fairium Z can be used in tandem with Charm and a faster spread of 248 HP / 56 Def / 204 Spe in order to trap support Primal Groudon. However, this is not recommended, as it traps no additional Pokemon in comparison to the original set, and Primal Groudon often runs mixed coverage or faster sets anyway. A more specially defensive set of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature can be run in order to more reliably trap Arceus formes and Eternatus but misses out on trapping Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM.</p> <p>Gothitelle forces its own matchups and so doesn't require much support from its team in terms of its defensive weaknesses. As Gothitelle is capable of trapping a majority of the defensive metagame, it pairs well with a plethora of offensive threats. Xerneas and Swords Dance Zacian-C are notable teammates, as they can easily clean up teams once Gothitelle has trapped the likes of Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Chansey for the former and Lugia, Necrozma-DM, and Quagsire for the latter. Dragon Dance Zygarde-C heavily enjoys support Arceus formes being out of the picture and thus is a great teammate as well. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn and Necrozma-DM appreciate Gothitelle's ability to eliminate common Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes. Furthermore, several other miscellaneous offensive threats, such as Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, Ultra Necrozma, and Zekrom benefit from Gothitelle, as it can trap and remove a majority of their checks in support Arceus formes, as well as defensive Zygarde-C for the former two.</p> "

Escavalier also benefits from physically defensive teammates such as Sylveon and Mudsdale to take on powerful physical attackers. Cleric support from teammates like Sylveon and Vaporeon is helpful so Escavalier doesn't have to worry as much about burns; these two can also supply Wish support for it, greatly boosting its longevity.</p> "

It is one of the few Pokemon in LC with access to Spore, making it one of the best status users in the tier. However, its typing leaves it weak to common Flying-types such as Vullaby, as well as Fire- and Psychic-types like Ponyta and Abra. It also struggles to make progress in games against Ferroseed and has difficulty with Pawniard if another foe has been put to sleep.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>It is worth noting that outside of the four moves listed above, Foongus's movepool is very limited. Therefore, alternative moves should only be used in specific matchups. Stun Spore can be used to paralyze multiple foes. Clear Smog can be used to prevent setup sweepers from setting up. An alternative EV spread of 124 HP / 236 Def / 76 SpD with a Bold nature can be used to make Foongus a better Fighting-type check at the cost of not being able to check special attackers like Staryu.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Pawniard resist both of Foongus's STAB attacks. While Pawniard does not appreciate Spore, Ferroseed is particularly problematic because it can switch into Foongus and safely set entry hazards, while Foongus can barely do anything to it.</p> <p><strong>Vullaby: Vullaby is able to switch into any of Foongus's attacks and has Overcoat, which gives it an immunity to Spore. Furthermore, it can then threaten Foongus with Brave Bird or set up with Nasty Plot. It is worth noting that less bulky variants take significant damage from Sludge Bomb and do not appreciate being poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Wingull and Woobat are able to threaten Foongus offensively. They can switch in on the turn Foongus uses Synthesis, but they should be wary of Spore.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types such as Abra and Galarian Ponyta are able to threaten Foongus offensively with their STAB attacks. Galarian Ponyta is particularly threatening, as the Eviolite set can switch into Foongus's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Vulpix and Ponyta threaten Foongus offensively with their powerful STAB attacks.

          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spore temporarily disables a foe, potentially creating a 6v5 scenario. Giga Drain is a STAB attack that increases Foongus's longevity. Sludge Bomb is a more powerful STAB attack that allows Foongus to hit Grass-resistant foes that switch into it and potentially poison them. Synthesis gives Foongus recovery and increases its longevity.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread gives Foongus good mixed bulk. With Eviolite, It hits 25 HP and 21 in Defense and Special Defense. This allows it to avoid the 2HKO from Reckless non-Choice Band Mienfoo's High Jump Kick, take on Eviolite Staryu in a one-on-one situation, and even survive a Psychic from Focus Sash Abra at full HP. Regenerator allows it to switch in and out freely, recovering a significant amount of health each time it does so.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Foongus can be brought in on common Fighting- and Water-types such as Mienfoo and Mareanie, as well as against the less common Grass- and Fairy-types such as Grookey and Spritzee. Try to keep its health high with Regenerator and Synthesis so that it can continue to pivot in on offensive threats throughout the match. Be careful when using Spore, since certain foes may be switched in to absorb it once their role in the match has been fulfilled. Foongus's ability to shut down opposing threats decreases greatly when a foe has been put to sleep. Aggressive plays are recommended if the foe has a healthy Ferroseed, such as double switching into a Fighting- or Fire-type teammate.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Onix and Foongus have good synergy because Foongus can check Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-types that threaten Onix, while Onix can check Flying- and Fire-types that threaten Foongus. Pawniard appreciates Foongus being able to check Fighting-types, while Pawniard helps by switching into Abra and Flying-types that threaten Foongus. Mienfoo and Mareanie can form a Regenerator core with Foongus that can be difficult to deal with if their checks have been removed. Grounded teammates appreciate Foongus's ability to switch into and remove Toxic Spikes. Fire-types such as Ponyta and Vulpix can pressure Steel-types that can wall Foongus. Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo make good teammates, as they can switch into and threaten Ferroseed and Pawniard.</p> "

Its Poison typing additionally gives it an edge over other common Grass-types, as it is able to threaten Tangrowth and Zarude with Sludge Bomb, which also prevents them from switching in to absorb Spore. However, despite Amoonguss's good defensive typing, it struggles against metagame staples like Salamence and Kommo-o. It can also be overwhelmed by Pokemon it is supposed to check due to their access to coverage, such as Ice Punch from Azumarill, Psychic from Primarina, and Air Slash from Keldeo. After using Spore, Amoonguss is easy to take advantage of by setup sweepers that take little from its other moves such as Galarian Slowbro and Thundurus-T.

Heavy-Duty Boots can also be run to help it pivot in against Spikes stacking teams, but the chip damage or passive recovery is too valuable.

Stun Spore can be considered to paralyze threatening switch-ins such as Chandelure after Spore has been used. Seed Bomb does more damage to Calm Mind Primarina, particularly Substitute sets that can boost enough to stop Sludge Bomb breaking the Substitute.

Giga Drain heavily damages Lycanroc-D and Keldeo, which Amoonguss naturally checks by virtue of its typing and bulk. It also enables Amoonguss to regain some HP, reducing the need for it to continually pivot for Regenerator recovery. Sludge Bomb threatens Primarina, Zarude, and Azumarill. It is also useful for the chance to poison switch-ins such as Salamence. Foul Play dents physical attackers such as Gyarados and prevents them from setting up on Amoonguss, and it is also Amoonguss's best way to damage other Steel-types such as Aegislash and Jirachi. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers Amoonguss switches into such as Azumarill and Zarude.

Teammates like Azumarill and Thundurus can capitalize on these forced switches. Checks to Moltres and Salamence, such as Primarina and Rhyperior, are useful partners that can switch into them and force it out. Dark-types such as Krookodile and Galarian Moltres can check Psychic-types like Galarian Slowbro and Azelf. Amoonguss is heavily threatened by Fire-types such as Entei and Rotom-H, so checks to these such as Kommo-o and Rhyperior make good partners. Amoonguss is vulnerable to Stealth Rock and Spikes chip damage, so Defog support from partners such as Salamence enables it to switch in more often and prevents entry hazards from cancelling out its Regenerator recovery. Chansey can take on special attackers like Nidoking, Moltres, and Kingdra that can overwhelm Amoonguss.</p> "

Giga Drain allows Amoonguss to target Ground- and Water-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Krookodile, Seismitoad, and Keldeo.

It is bulky enough to live most attacks, and the added survivability from Regenerator allows it to perform its role repeatedly throughout a match. Additionally, Pollen Puff ensures Amoonguss's teammates can also remain healthy. Setup Pokemon, such as Dragon Dance Zygarde or Kyurem-B and Calm Mind Tapu Fini, benefit the most from Amoonguss's support and can make up for its minimal damage output. Due to its low Speed and Spore, Amoonguss also works well both with and against Trick Room teams, as it can then send most Pokemon to sleep before they move. Trick Room users such as Porygon2 and Diancie also appreciate the redirection support while setting it. Despite being able to stomach most hits, Amoonguss must be wary of Fire-types such as Heatran and Incineroar as well as Psychic-types such as Tapu Lele and Necrozma, requiring teammates to deal with them such as Urshifu-R and Heatran, respectively. The presence of Misty Terrain hampers Amoonguss's Spore, so terrain setters such as Tapu Lele and Indeedee-F, or Metagross with Steel Roller, are essential to remove it. Opposing Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana, or Pokemon holding Safety Goggles, can also be troublesome, as immunity to powder moves lets them mostly ignore Amoonguss and attack its partner.

Psychic can be used to OHKO Croagunk, which can otherwise switch freely into Scald. Ice Beam is a useful coverage option for Grass-type switch-ins such as Oddish. Energy Ball or Giga Drain can be used to hit other Water-types for more damage, such as other Frillish and Corphish. Strength Sap is an alternative recovery move that also cripples the target but reduces Frillish's longevity against the common Pawniard. Water Absorb can be used over Cursed Body, but it is considered worse because Frillish takes little damage from Water-type attacks anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Vullaby and Scraggy are able to set up on Frillish and threaten it with Knock Off. Vullaby is particularly threatening because its Nasty Plot set isn't affected by Will-O-Wisp burns, which other Dark-types tend to fear.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Chinchou and Magnemite can be threatening with their strong STAB attacks.

However, they are all forced out if Giga Drain is disabled by Cursed Body. Bulbasaur is particularly threatening, as it can set up Growth against Frillish.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions: Poisoning Frillish through Toxic Spikes or Toxic massively reduce its longevity.

          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hex is used to deal significant damage to a target with a status condition. Will-O-Wisp burns the target, reducing damage from physical attacks while boosting the power of Hex. Recover is used for reliable recovery, increasing Frillish's longevity. Scald allows Frillish to reliably check important threats such as Ponyta and Onix and also has the chance to power up Hex if a Pokemon that resists Water gets burned. It can also help to chip and potentially burn common switch-ins to Frillish, such as Vullaby and Pawniard. Taunt can be used to prevent recovery on defensive Pokemon such as Shellos and Mareanie or prevent slow Pokemon such as Dewpider and Ferroseed from setting up entry hazards.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP and Defense investment enables Frillish to take two Earthquakes from Drilbur and Onix. The Speed investment allows it to outspeed Zigzagoon, Adamant Corphish, defensive Mudbray, and other physical threats. It can also take the opportunity to burn opposing Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp before taking damage. Eviolite is used as the item to further increase bulk, allowing Frillish to reach 21 Defense and 22 Special Defense. Cursed Body is the preferred ability and can potentially disable a super effective attack. Although it's unreliable due to its activation chance, most foes only run one super effective move against Frillish, meaning it can keep using Recover until Cursed Body activates in tight situations. An alternative spread of 236 HP / 116 Def / 76 SpA / 36 Spe with a Bold nature can be run for increased bulk while outspeeding bulky Timburr.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Frillish should be brought in on weak defensive Pokemon and special attackers such as Mareanie and Shellos. It is able to counter Normal-, Water-, Fire-, and Ground-types, notably Ponyta and Onix. Frillish can come in on such Pokemon, take minimal damage, and deal heavy damage back with its STAB attacks. Be careful when facing Pokemon with access to Knock Off, such as Timburr and Vullaby, as Frillish should try to keep its item. However, most offensive threats rely on a single move such as Knock Off to hit Frillish, allowing Frillish to keep using Recover until Cursed Body activates. Be wary of Guts Timburr, since burning it with Will-O-Wisp or Scald will give it a free Attack boost. It is important to balance spreading burns with keeping Frillish healthy so that it can continue to switch into Pokemon throughout the game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ferroseed and Oddish make good teammates because they counter both Electric- and Grass-types well. Oddish makes a particularly good partner by removing Toxic Spikes when switching in, as do other Poison-types such as Mareanie. A good Knock Off absorber such as Spritzee makes a good partner for Frillish because of Frillish's susceptibility to the move. Timburr and Spritzee make good teammates because they are able to check Dark-types. Entry hazard setters such as Dewpider, Dwebble and Ferroseed benefit from Frillish's ability to spinblock effectively. Toxic Spikes users such as Mareanie enable Frillish to do more damage with Hex when opposing Pokemon are poisoned. Ponyta can check Dark-types by burning them and is able to force out Grass-types. Entry hazard removers such as Timburr and Vullaby are appreciated because Frillish struggles to avoid a lot of 2HKOs if Stealth Rock is present.</p> "

Because of this, Jellicent is an effective switch-in to Fighting-types like Choice Scarf Passimian as well as an excellent defensive check to various physical attackers such as Kabutops and Silvally-Steel. Jellicent also provides teams additional utility by punishing Water-types or Choice-locked attackers depending on if it's running Water Absorb or Cursed Body. However, Jellicent can be rather passive due to its low offensive capabilities and reliance on status as the typical way of dealing damage.

Hex is preferred as the sole attacking move on this set because it pairs well with its status moves versus bulkier defensive answers such as Lanturn. Colbur Berry is the optimal item in order to weaken Knock Off from the likes of Passimian or Gallade, but Heavy-Duty Boots can be used in order to be immune to entry hazards. Jellicent can also opt to not use an item, allowing it to switch into Choice Band Froslass, at the cost of some defensive utility against other threats. Gigalith makes a fantastic partner for Jellicent, as not only is it a good check to special attackers like Haunter, but with Sand Stream and hazard support, the residual damage Jellicent can spread with Will-O-Wisp and Toxic can severely cripple offensive answers like Whimsicott and Vikavolt. Conversely, Gigalith appreciates Jellicent's ability to reliably provide a Fighting immunity versus Choice-locked attackers like Passimian. Silvally-Fairy is also a fine partner, since it acts as a Knock Off absorber if Jellicent isn't running Colbur Berry and handles Dark-types such as Absol. Whimsicott makes a great offensive partner for Jellicent thanks to its ability to offensively check Sandaconda, Scrafty, and Absol, whereas Jellicent can check Charizard decently well. 32 Speed EVs allow Jellicent to outspeed Carracosta and Taunt it, preventing it from setting up with Shell Smash.</p> "

Opting for Life Orb does make up for this, particularly if Galvantula runs Thunder, but doing so means forgoing Heavy-Duty Boots and limiting its staying power.

Heavy-Duty Boots negates the effects of entry hazards, giving Galvantula an easier time switching around and annoying offensive teams. Alternatively, Life Orb can be used to bolster Galvantula's offensive presence, giving it a high chance to OHKO Pokemon like defensive Mesprit with Bug Buzz after Stealth Rock. However, losing immunity to entry hazards and taking Life Orb recoil both decrease its overall longevity. Slower wallbreakers and setup sweepers like Haunter and Nasty Plot Rotom-F very much appreciate Galvantula both slowing down potential revenge killers, like Choice Scarf Passimian, with Sticky Web and generating momentum for them with Volt Switch. Both of these Pokemon also benefit from Galvantula's ability to force damage onto shared checks like Gigalith and Lanturn, and can break through bulkier walls like Galarian Stunfisk and Palossand in return. Rapid Spin users like Tsareena and Kabutops can give Galvantula's teammates easier entry without removing Sticky Web, maintain momentum with their respective pivoting moves, and offensively check Pokemon such as Palossand and Charizard.

Having Sticky Web set up is important for Electric-type teams because it helps against threatening Choice Scarf users such as Weavile, Gengar, and Gardevoir and hinders setup sweepers like Cloyster and Barbaracle. Galvantula is also a good attacker because it can land Thunder consistently thanks to Compound Eyes. Thunder is able to 2HKO common Defoggers such as Galarian Weezing and Rotom-W while also threatening anti-hazard leads such as Xatu. Bug Buzz is used for Pokemon that can tank Thunder such as Hydreigon, Mew, Rotom-C, and Alolan Raichu. String Shot slows opposing Pokemon, which makes it easier for Galvantula's teammates to outspeed and check threatening sweepers, such as Excadrill. Energy Ball can be used instead of String Shot to offer Galvantula coverage against Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad. Galvantula should be wary of Magic Bounce users such as Hatterene and Defiant users such as Bisharp, as they can take advantage of Sticky Web. A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment allow Galvantula to outspeed Pokemon such as Mew and Speed tie Cobalion.

Iron Barbs makes Ferroseed able to wear down physical attackers.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Ferroseed early-game to set down Stealth Rock or Spikes or soften up its checks by getting rid of Eviolite with Knock Off. It can also use Thunder Wave on a predicted switch to help slow down threats such as Ponyta, Mienfoo, and Vullaby. Switch Ferroseed in on Spritzee, Mareanie, and Foongus, as these Pokemon cannot do much to it. Use Knock Off or set entry hazards when Ferroseed switches into these to help its soften up Pokemon for its teammates to take care of. Try to scout Vullaby, Abra, and Galarian Ponyta before trying to use a move because they can potentially bypass Ferroseed with Fire-type coverage. Ferroseed should be preserved to check setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Onix and Agility Porygon or threats like Foongus, Mudbray, and Staryu if the team lacks a way to deal with them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Spritzee and Mareanie are great partners for Ferroseed because their typing allows them to come in on Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo. Spritzee also is good for absorbing Knock Off for Ferroseed and keeping it healthy with Wish, while Mareanie can put down Toxic Spikes to cripple switch-ins and in return likes Ferroseed's ability to put up entry hazards, take care of Ground-types such as Onix if it's lacking Iron Defense, and come in on Foongus. Stealth Rock setters like Onix and Mudbray are great to pair with Ferroseed if it is running Spikes to form an entry hazard stacking duo and make it easier to pressure switch-ins and wear down Pokemon. Onix is useful to take care of Vullaby, while Mudbray is more useful in taking down Timburr and threatening Fire-types such as Ponyta and Vulpix. Trappers like Diglett and Trapinch are good to pair with Ferroseed to trap Ponyta and Pawniard and take care of them. Staryu is a great Water-type partner because of it checking Fire-types like Ponyta and Vulpix and appreciating Ferroseed's ability to switch in on Foongus's attacks. Staryu can also use Thunderbolt to take care of Wingull and dent Vullaby while also using Rapid Spin to get rid of hazards that wear Ferroseed down. Setup sweepers such as Onix, Shellder, and Nasty Plot Vullaby can sweep mid- to late-game thanks to Ferroseed's ability to soften up threats with Knock Off and cripple faster Pokemon like Mienfoo, Galarian Ponyta, Wingull, and Ponyta with Thunder Wave.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn excels as a Spikes setter thanks to the combination of its solid Grass / Steel defensive typing, great defensive stats, and wide utility movepool, which lets it pressure common forms of entry hazard control such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T with Knock Off. Ferrothorn's typing also lets it deter attackers such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Melmetal. Spikes is Ferrothorn's main attribute, slowly chipping down checks as well as offensive threats such as Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko with the support of Knock Off. Additionally, Iron Barbs is useful to punish pivots that try to generate momentum such as Landorus-T and Rillaboom. However, Ferrothorn has a glaring 4x weakness to Fire, which means that it is immediately forced out by Fire-types and Pokemon carrying Fire-type coverage such as Dragapult and Nidoking. It also struggles against Pokemon carrying Fighting-type coverage moves such as Tornadus-T and Tapu Lele, which it would otherwise be able to check comfortably. Ferrothorn is almost completely useless against Regenerator cores such as Toxapex + Tangrowth and Toxapex + Tornadus-T, as they can easily shrug off Ferrothorn's chip damage and PP stall it. Furthermore, Ferrothorn is very easily worn down due to its reliance on Leech Seed and Leftovers to make up for its lack of reliable recovery, which makes it susceptible to wallbreakers such as Kartana and Rillaboom and Knock Off users such as Toxapex and Clefable that can threaten it over time.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A more physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 88 Def / 168 SpD with an Impish nature can be run to check offensive variants of Landorus-T and Kartana. Thunder Wave can be run to disrupt pivots and wallbreakers such as Tornadus-T and Kartana. Body Press is an option that lets Ferrothorn dish out super effective damage to Pokemon such as Heatran, Hydreigon, and opposing Ferrothorn, although forgoing Power Whip makes Ferrothorn a significantly worse check to Pokemon like Slowking and Tapu Fini. Gyro Ball is another alternative to Power Whip that lets Ferrothorn deal more damage to faster foes such as Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Latios. Protect can be used to stall turns and gain extra recovery while scouting Choice-locked Pokemon such as Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Latios.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon and Coverage: Heatran and Volcarona are extremely threatening to Ferrothorn, as they OHKO it with their STAB moves; however, they cannot safely switch in because of a potential Knock Off or Thunder Wave. Thanks to the prevalence of Ferrothorn, there are plenty of Pokemon that choose to run Fire-type coverage for it such as Calm Mind Clefable, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Nidoking.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage: Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and Buzzwole can easily pressure Ferrothorn with their STAB moves, but the former struggles to switch into it. Pokemon like Rillaboom, Tapu Lele, and Zeraora often run Fighting-type coverage to pressure Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Swords Dance Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Kyurem threaten Ferrothorn with their STAB moves, although they must be wary of being worn down by Knock Off; the former two also need to set up in order to pressure it. Ferrothorn can also be overwhelmed by the Pokemon it is meant to check such as Tapu Lele and Melmetal.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal: Ferrothorn is reliant on Leftovers, as it is one of its main sources of recovery. It often must avoid Pokemon that carry Knock Off or can remove its item such as Landorus-T, Clefable, and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini to maintain its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Ferrothorn is prone to being vulnerable by Pokemon it checks such as Toxapex and Slowking, as it makes Ferrothorn much more passive and removes its ability to recover health, which prevents it from reliably checking its intended targets.</p> ",

Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used over Spikes if your team lacks a Stealth Rock setter; however, Ferrothorn will have a harder time breaking through defensive cores. Leech Seed is Ferrothorn's main source of recovery and is particularly helpful because it makes Ferrothorn, which is usually a passive Pokemon, much harder to switch into. Maximum HP and Special Defense investment allows Ferrothorn to check Tapu Lele and other special attackers.</p> <p>Ferrothorn fits on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate the defensive utility it provides as a Spikes setter. Wallbreakers such as Dragapult, Kyurem, and Nidoking appreciate the entry hazards Ferrothorn sets up and can pressure revenge killers such as Zeraora and Weavile. Clefable and Heatran both have great defensive synergy with Ferrothorn, as they can wear down common checks such as Corviknight. They, alongside other Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T, can also help Ferrothorn by allowing it to run Spikes. It's incredibly important to provide checks to Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran and Volcarona, as Ferrothorn is extremely vulnerable to them. Therefore, Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Garchomp are fantastic partners for it. Fast pivots such as Tornadus-T and Tapu Koko provide VoltTurn support and retain momentum against Pokemon like Corviknight and Mandibuzz, which only fear Knock Off from Ferrothorn, while benefiting from it setting up Spikes to further pressure their defensive switch-ins like Heatran and Galarian Slowking. They can also give Ferrothorn opportunities to set up entry hazards and utilize Knock Off more reliably after pivoting against its checks such as Corviknight and Zapdos. Rain teams also deserve a special mention, as they have formidable synergy with Ferrothorn; Ferrothorn provides Spikes support to wear down the opposing team for rain wallbreakers like Kingdra, Seismitoad, and Barraskewda, it acts as a great check to many Pokemon that threaten rain teams such as Tapu Koko and Rillaboom, while rain reduces its weakness to Fire.</p> "

However, dropping Protect, Knock Off, or Toxic can make Ferrothorn less reliable as a check to Xerneas or even more passive, respectively. Gyro Ball is another option in the last slot that has no accuracy drawback, allowing Ferrothorn to deal with Xerneas more reliably; it serves little to no use outside of that, however. Bullet Seed can be used over Power Whip to prevent Ferrothorn from being trapped by Gothitelle due to the move's high PP, although it's generally inferior to Power Whip due to the unreliability of it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh can consistently switch into Ferrothorn due to Regenerator, force it out with the threat of a powerful Sacred Fire, and remove its Spikes with Defog. However, Ho-Oh fears losing its Heavy-Duty Boots to a Knock Off, since it will become much easier to wear down if Stealth Rock is on the opponent's side of the field. Ho-Oh doesn't appreciate Toxic either; being badly poisoned takes away from its ability to come out on top against Stealth Rock Necrozma-DM.</p> <p><strong>Eternatus: A well-played Eternatus is the second largest obstacle for Ferrothorn. Not only does Eternatus force Ferrothorn out with Flamethrower or Mystical Fire, it's also capable of gradually PP stalling Ferrothorn out of Spikes and Leech Seed in more drawn-out games, not being bothered by anything Ferrothorn can dish out other than Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Foes like Zacian-C, Palkia, and Marshadow easily force Ferrothorn out, as they often carry super effective coverage to break Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Ferrothorn's bulk is nothing to brag about in the context of the metagame. As a result, generally strong wallbreakers such as Calyrex-S and Groudon are more than capable of heavily damaging Ferrothorn or forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users: Ferrothorn's passivity makes it setup fodder against foes under a Substitute such as Zekrom, Reshiram, and Zygarde-C.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle: Ferrothorn is unable to switch out against Gothitelle due to Shadow Tag, making it entirely susceptible to Taunt while being weakened by Charm. Gothitelle can also heal off Ferrothorn's weak attacks with Rest. However, Ferrothorn will still be able to greatly annoy Gothitelle in the process by removing Leftovers and chipping away at its health with Leech Seed.

Leech Seed is Ferrothorn's most reliable form of recovery and a great tool of disruption against switch-ins such as Zacian-C. Power Whip deals immediate damage to Kyogre, notably forcing out bulky Calm Mind variants, and Xerneas. Protect is useful to scout for the foe's moves, gain Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery, and stall out Dynamax turns from the likes of Xerneas, Groudon, and Kyogre. Knock Off is an alternative to cripple foes like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Eternatus. Toxic is another good option, crippling all of the metagame's Defoggers in Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Lunala. A specially defensive spread with a Careful nature is required in order for Ferrothorn to check Kyogre and Xerneas reliably. Ferrothorn should preserve its health with Leech Seed so it can stay healthy throughout the game while whittling down foes.</p> <p>Ferrothorn fits on all sorts of balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate having a check to Kyogre and Xerneas as well as Spikes support. Teammates like Zygarde-C, Zekrom, and Kyogre are notable for pressuring Ho-Oh, which is a huge threat to Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn significantly struggles against threats like Marshadow, Dragon Dance Zygarde-C and Zekrom, Groudon, Zacian-C, Eternatus, and Calyrex-S due to their super effective or powerful moves against it and their tendency to use Ferrothorn as setup bait. Therefore, good partners that can check these threats such as Zacian-C, Lunala, Necrozma-DM, Calyrex-S, and Yveltal are useful. Zygarde-C really appreciates Spikes support from Ferrothorn, as it synergizes fantastically with its Dragon Tail, while Ferrothorn is able to check Xerneas and disrupt Lunala for Zygarde-C. Groudon pairs excellently with Ferrothorn; Groudon is able to force out Ho-Oh and set up with Swords Dance while forcing it out, and it heavily benefits from Ferrothorn's Spikes chipping its checks and Ferrothorn's ability to check Kyogre. The likes of Zacian-C, Xerneas, Kyogre, and Marshadow are some other good teammates, benefitting hugely from Spikes wearing down their main checks in Necrozma-DM and Eternatus.</p> "

Its Steel typing grants it Ice, Bug, and Flying neutralities as well as a Poison immunity, four types Grass teams are typically weak to, as well as a plethora of resistances, allowing it to check many Pokemon across the board while staying healthy with Leech Seed and setting hazards. Protect should be used in order to scout against Choice-locked Pokemon such as Dragapult and Galarian Darmanitan; additionally, it helps with gaining more Leftovers recovery and racking up damage and healing with Leech Seed if used together. Spikes can be dropped if the team includes another Spikes setter such as Roserade, though it is not recommended, as Grass teams appreciate the hazard stack. Generally, Ferrothorn should look for opportunities to come in using its good typing and bulk and start stacking hazards or using Leech Seed to wear the opposing team down. Iron Head can be used over Gyro Ball to hit Hatterene, and if it is used, it should be used with an Impish nature. Maximum investments in HP and Defense along with a Relaxed nature ensure that Ferrothorn takes on Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan, Excadrill, and Weavile better, with a Relaxed nature also increasing the power of Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Appletun is an amazing partner for Ferrothorn because of its Dragon typing along with Thick Fat, allowing it to serve as a Fire-resistant Pokemon and covering one of Ferrothorn's key weaknesses. Together, the core can scout and beat common Choice-locked Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan, Indeedee, and Dragapult by using Protect to play around them. Leech Seed users such as the aforementioned Appletun, Whimsicott, and Ludicolo take advantage of Ferrothorn's hazards in order to force switches and rack up damage and can support Ferrothorn if it is not running Leech Seed. Whimsicott can also beat Fighting-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o and Hawlucha that threaten Ferrothorn with Moonblast. Offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Rillaboom and Rotom-C make good partners for Ferrothorn, as they can outspeed Pokemon that threaten Ferrothorn such as Dragapult and Togekiss and use pivoting moves such as U-turn and Volt Switch respectively to bring Ferrothorn in. Rotom-C is generally good for threatening Flying-type Pokemon such as Corviknight and Choice Specs Pelipper that Ferrothorn dislikes dealing with.

Aegislash is a good partner because its Ghost typing gives it an immunity to Fighting-type attacks that threaten Ferrothorn and allows it to block Rapid Spin. Aegislash also benefits from Ferrothorn's entry hazards because it can use Shadow Sneak to pick off weakened foes. Bisharp is another good partner that punishes entry hazard removal because of its Defiant ability, which gives it a +2 Attack boost if the foe uses Defog. Corviknight forms a great defensive core with Ferrothorn and provides a Ground immunity. Excadrill is a great revenge killer and is an offensive check to Fire-types that threaten Ferrothorn and Steel-type teams in general. Duraludon can set up Stealth Rock, allowing Ferrothorn to run Spikes.

In addition, Knock Off also makes Ferrothorn less prone to being trapped by Mega Gengar while greatly reducing the longevity Pokemon that rely on Leftovers like Necrozma-DM. Knock Off works well with the constant chip damage Ferrothorn does to the opposing team through Leech Seed and Spikes, forcing Pokemon like Necrozma-DM to waste its Morning Sun PP to stay healthy. Protect allows Ferrothorn to scout moves from Choice-locked attackers, such as Mega Rayquaza, Kyogre, and Lunala; stall Dynamax turns from Pokemon such as Yveltal and Xerneas; and stall for a little extra Leftovers recovery and potential Leech Seed recovery, which is especially vital versus Water Spout Primal Kyogre. Leftovers is chosen to enable Ferrothorn to semi-reliably switch into Primal Kyogre. Alternatively, Ferrothorn can run Gyro Ball, Power Whip, or Bullet Seed over Knock Off to be able to punish switch-ins such as Zacian-C and Mega Diancie or deal more damage to Primal Kyogre and Substitute Arceus-Water, although Knock Off is generally preferable, as otherwise, Ho-Oh removes freely removes Spikes.</p> <p>Ferrothorn fits best on hazard stacking balance or bulky offense teams that can patch up its weaknesses. Ferrothorn is vulnerable to strong physical attacks from Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Mega Rayquaza, and Zacian-C, meaning that it appreciates support from defensive Pokemon like, defensive Zygarde-C, and Arceus-Ground. As Ferrothorn fits best on hazard-stacking teams, it works especially well with defensive Stealth Rock setters like Tyranitar and Necrozma-DM. Although Ferrothorn can punish switches through various ways, it is also fairly passive, so it has a tendency to invite dangerous Pokemon into battle, such as Zacian-C, Yveltal, and Eternatus. Thus, pairing it with a strong defensive backbone consisting of the aforementioned Necrozma-DM, as well as the likes of specially defensive Ho-Oh and Tyranitar, is recommended. Ferrothorn struggles to break Substitute from Pokemon like Zygarde-C and Zekrom, so it appreciates teammates capable of handling those, such as Arceus-Ground. Dragon Dance Zygarde-C frequently forces switches through Dragon Tail, allowing it to rack up significant hazard damage on the opposing as a Ferrothorn partner. Zacian-C and Eternatus also enjoy Ferrothorn's support, as their checks often need to be at or close to full health to switch in safely. Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Mega Rayquaza and Yveltal can immediately threaten Defog Arceus formes and can force many switches to rack up Spikes damage, so they are also good teammates.</p> "

Sweepers like Cobalion, Keldeo, and Lycanroc-D appreciate Chandelure's ability to weaken bulky foes like Rhyperior and Primarina throughout a match with Toxic, allowing them to clean up more easily late-game. Chandelure appreciates them compensating for its slightly paltry Speed. Chandelure also enjoys pivots as teammates, as it doesn't often enjoy directly switching into play. In addition to providing pivoting support, Choice Scarf Jirachi can pressure faster Pokemon like Lycanroc-D and Nihilego, while Electric-types like Thundurus and Rotom-W can lure in Pokemon for Chandelure to take advantage of, like Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Rotom-W can also pivot in on various Ground-types, like Rhyperior and Krookodile. Other status spreaders can work well as teammates, alleviating Chandelure's need for prediction regarding Hex. Galarian Slowbro is particularly good at spreading status due to its tendency to run both Scald and Sludge Bomb.

Additionally, using Pokemon that can prevent hazards from being set like Hattrem is also encouraged, as Fraxure needs to be kept healthy to function properly. Hattrem can also heal Fraxure to full with Healing Wish to give it a second chance at sweeping. When running Swords Dance, Fraxure benefits from Sticky Web setters like Charjabug that can help lower the Speed of Choice Scarf users that may threaten Fraxure such as Krokorok and Lampent.

      "overview": "<p>Mienfoo is one of LC's defining presences and the tier's most versatile Fighting-type, capable of serving as a reliable defensive pivot or a devastating offensive threat. Regenerator lets it take hits, force Pokemon out, and generate momentum with U-turn. Its other great ability, Reckless, boosts High Jump Kick's power to extreme levels and makes it one of the best wallbreakers in the tier. It provides great utility through moves like Knock Off, U-turn, and Fake Out, which can wear down defensive cores, generate momentum, and revenge kill sweepers. Mienfoo's Fighting typing is indispensable in Little Cup, as almost every team requires a reliable switch-in to Onix and Pawniard and a way to break through Ferroseed. While Mienfoo has many great qualities, it can be exploited. Mienfoo's prevalence means that almost every team will carry a dedicated check for Fighting-types like Koffing, Foongus, or Mareanie. High Jump Kick is somewhat unreliable, leading to Mienfoo often taking major recoil damage, and Protect on unexpected foes can spell its demise. Mienfoo's propensity for taking chip damage and switching into Knock Off can lead to it being trapped by Diglett, and Mienfoo is generally not that bulky after having its Eviolite removed. Its lack of reliable priority can be exploited by fast threats like Abra and Galarian Ponyta.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Band is an option over Choice Scarf to make Mienfoo absurdly powerful and unexpectedly OHKO opposing Vullaby and Mienfoo, although the set's relative slowness and frailty necessitate more cautious use and team support. Mienfoo can run a Swords Dance set with Berry Juice and Acrobatics on Sticky Web offense teams to serve as a powerful sweeper, but Scraggy generally outclasses it. Acrobatics is an option on non-Berry Juice sets to hit Foongus, but it will typically be useless unless Mienfoo takes Knock Off. Feint is an option to help beat Focus Sash Abra but lacks Fake Out's benefit of free damage against other foes. Swords Dance is an option on pivot sets to boost and OHKO Vullaby that attempt to switch in. Regenerator can be run on Choice Scarf sets to give Mienfoo added durability against priority moves, but the major decrease in power makes this inadvisable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Koffing: Koffing's hefty physical bulk and Poison typing allow it to reliably pivot into Mienfoo and threaten it out with a burn or its powerful Sludge Bomb. Koffing's Neutralizing Gas also can harm Mienfoo's staying power by preventing recovery from Regenerator. However, Koffing lacks reliable recovery and is vulnerable to entry hazards, meaning it can only switch into Mienfoo a few times.</p> <p><strong>Mareanie</strong>: Thanks to its resistance to Fighting and Regenerator, Mareanie is the one of the sturdiest Mienfoo checks in the tier. Mareanie must be wary of switching into U-turn, though, as Mienfoo may pivot to Diglett or a powerful special attacker. Mareanie also takes significant damage from Choice Band High Jump Kick without its Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Foongus: Foongus resists High Jump Kick, can stay healthy with Regenerator and reliable recovery, and punish Mienfoo with Spore. Foongus struggles mightily when Mienfoo is paired with Ferroseed, as Ferroseed fears none of Foongus's options and U-turn prevents Foongus from double switching to punish Ferroseed. Foongus without its Eviolite also cannot reliably switch into Reckless Mienfoo, as it is 2HKOed by High Jump Kick after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Spritzee: Spritzee fears Mienfoo little and cannot reliably be trapped by Diglett, and it threatens back with Moonblast. Spritzee can take advantage of Mienfoo to pass Wish and heal teammates like Ferroseed. Protect prevents Mienfoo from powering through with High Jump Kick. However, Spritzee often struggles to make progress against Mienfoo thanks to Mienfoo pivoting with U-turn to bulky Pokemon like Mareanie and Ferroseed.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Mienfoo without Choice Scarf can be threatened by speedy threats like Abra and Galarian Ponyta. Abra often runs Protect to preserve its Focus Sash against Fake Out and can punish Mienfoo with Psychic. However, Mienfoo can survive non-Life Orb Abra's Psychic with maximum Special Defense investment and Eviolite.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>High Jump Kick is an extremely powerful STAB move, even without Attack investment, although its misses can be costly and it can be punished with Protect. Knock Off lets Mienfoo make progress against its switch-ins like Mareanie, Foongus, and Koffing. U-turn works in excellent tandem with Regenerator, allowing Mienfoo to pivot away while healing itself. Fake Out wears down faster offensive threats such as Speed-boosted Nasty Plot Vullaby and Choice Scarf users, and it can stall out turns of sun, dual screens, and Grassy Terrain. Beware that some fast threats, especially Abra, run Protect to avoid Fake Out. Taunt is a niche option that helps against Foongus, especially when you do not have your own Foongus or Ferroseed to absorb Spore, and prevents Foongus and Mareanie from recovering HP, letting Mienfoo break through them sometimes. Taunt can also prevent slower sweepers like Nasty Plot Vullaby from setting up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Pivot Mienfoo's versatility is defined by its ability to run multiple EV spreads to fit different roles. The given EV spread balances Mienfoo's ability to threaten much of the tier with its Speed while also providing ample physical bulk. Hitting 17 Speed Speed ties with Onix, Natu, and opposing Mienfoo and lets it always outspeed Pawniard and non-Choice Scarf Vullaby. The given EV investment also hits 14 Defense and provides Mienfoo with enough bulk to comfortably switch into Pawniard, Onix, and other Fighting-types. An alternate spread of 76 HP / 196 Def / 196 SpD with an Impish nature gives Mienfoo impressive bulk at the expense of Speed, letting it always survive Download Porygon's Psychic and almost always survive non-Life Orb Abra's Psychic from full HP. This spread also lets Mienfoo defeat Weak Armor Vullaby with Fake Out. You can forgo defensive investment almost entirely and run a spread of 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe to surprise opponents with its offensive presence, almost always OHKOing standard Vullaby after Stealth Rock. Eviolite provides Mienfoo the bulk to survive most attacks from full health. Regenerator keeps Mienfoo healthy and enables it to continually pivot into threats.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mienfoo is one of the most consistent lead options in the tier thanks to Fake Out, Knock Off, and U-turn. This set is a great sponge for chip damage thanks to its bulk and ability to heal when switching out. Mienfoo should use its bulk and resistances to come in on Pokemon like Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Onix and make progress with Knock Off and U-turn. U-turn should be used aggressively, and Mienfoo generally should be preserved often, as multiple switches can restore its HP. Mienfoo can often force Fighting-resistant foes to switch in and pivot into frail offensive threats like Diglett and Abra to exploit them. While its chip damage and priority can be valuable, Fake Out should be used strategically, as it can also allow free switches from Weak Armor Vullaby and checks to Mienfoo.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mienfoo pairs excellently with Diglett, as it can weaken foes with Knock Off and get Diglett free switches with U-turn; in return, Diglett can trap and KO Mareanie and Abra. Mienfoo supports Vullaby well by switching into Pawniard and Onix and forcing them out or KOing them, and the two can pivot between each other with U-turn and create offensive pressure. Vullaby can also deter Abra from using Psychic. Pawniard supports Mienfoo by switching into dangerous special attackers like Abra and Galarian Ponyta as well as Vullaby's Brave Bird, but it can easily be worn down in this role. Ferroseed is an even more reliable answer to Abra, and Mienfoo's U-turn gets it free turns against Foongus.</p> "

Mienfoo can strategically use Knock Off early-game to soften Fighting-resistant switch-ins, as High Jump Kick severely threatens most of them without Eviolite. This set relies on the gradual chipping down of these Fighting-resistant foes to serve as a wincon late-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Timburr supports this set well, as it can function as a defensive Fighting-type and overwhelm Fighting-resistant foes, especially Foongus and Koffing, with Knock Off and Ice Punch. Knock Off support from other users like Vullaby, Pawniard, and Mareanie is also invaluable for whittling down bulky foes that might otherwise survive High Jump Kick. Ferroseed switches well into Fighting-resistant foes that force out Mienfoo and can set Spikes to facillitate a sweep. Diglett can capitalize on U-turn to trap and KO Mareanie and Focus Sash Abra.</p> "

Regenerator makes Mienshao significantly more difficult to wear down than most other Choice Scarf users, and most of the tier's best Fighting-resistant Pokemon, such Togekiss, Crobat, and Noivern, dislike Knock Off greatly. In addition, Fairy- and Flying-types such as Sylveon, Gardevoir, and Noivern can't take its potential coverage moves of Poison Jab and Stone Edge. Its ability to force out common Pokemon such as Zarude, Stakataka, and Cobalion allows it to easily keep momentum with U-turn. The Choice Scarf set's utility is therefore valuable to the vast majority of balance and offensive playstyles. Mienshao's great Speed and offensive utility can also make it a dangerous wallbreaker that is capable of 2HKOing a large majority of the tier. However, Mienshao is quite frail; it can't comfortably take hits from powerful attackers like Zarude and Metagross. Mienshao also has annoying weaknesses to Flying-, Fairy-, and Psychic-type moves. Mienshao is capable of threatening most users of said moves with Knock Off or U-turn, but they can become an issue should Mienshao lock into Close Combat. Locking into Close Combat can also give opportunities to dangerous Pokemon such as Necrozma, Alolan Marowak, and Calm Mind Reuniclus.

It also hinders generally bulky Pokemon that might look to take a hit, such as Seismitoad, Milotic, Suicune, and Galarian Weezing. Stone Edge is the preferred last move to hit Flying-types such as Togekiss, Crobat, and Noivern. Poison Jab can be used instead to hit Fairy-types like Sylveon and Gardevoir while still hitting Togekiss, but it is a very bad move to be locked into and Mienshao would prefer to bring in an adequate response to said Fairy-types through U-turn most of the time.

Steel-types such as Steelix, Registeel, Metagross, and Klefki are capable checks to these threats and are also able to set Stealth Rock or Spikes, therefore making Mienshao more difficult to switch into. Hard-hitting wallbreakers appreciate Mienshao bringing them in safely via U-turn. Alolan Marowak and Toxtricity appreciate being brought into battle with less risk, and they are capable of threatening some of Mienshao's more common checks, such as Golisopod, Togekiss, and Galarian Weezing.

          "description": "<p>Golurk is one of the tier's most powerful wallbreakers thanks to its great coverage and STAB combination. Its useful immunities allow it to block Volt Switch and prevent Toxtricity from freely spamming its most powerful moves. However, its poor Speed, mediocre bulk, and competition from other powerful wallbreakers such as Rhyperior, Chandelure, and Alolan Marowak make it a bit more of a niche pick overall. Close Combat is the preferred Fighting-type move due to its higher power. Dynamic Punch spreads confusion and doesn't drop Golurk's defenses, but it fails to OHKO Zarude. Trick can be used to cripple annoying defensive Pokemon like Suicune, Snorlax, and Tangela. It's also a decent way to punish teams that look to handle Golurk by pivoting around its STAB moves, such as those utilizing Ground-type immune Pokemon like Togekiss and Noivern. Shadow Punch with Iron Fist can be used instead of Trick for a Ghost-type move against foes that have had their items removed. No Guard is better if Shadow Punch is not being run, as it prevents Poltergeist and Dynamic Punch from missing.</p> <p>Golurk is a rather poor switch-in to the tier's Electric-types overall, as Xurkitree and Toxtricity have coverage moves that have a chance to OHKO, and Raikou's Scald 2HKOes. Grass- and Dragon-types such as Zarude, Roserade, and Dragalge can take on Raikou and Xurkitree while also checking Water-types like Sharpedo, Suicune, and Milotic. Dragalge can also provide Golurk free switches with Flip Turn. A faster pivot such as Mienshao, Xurkitree, or Noivern can help it out by pivoting it in safely. Togekiss, Noivern, and Gardevoir enjoy Golurk threatening Steel-types. The incredibly common Zarude is one of the only Pokemon that can confidently switch into Golurk's STAB combination. Strategies to chip down Zarude are recommended so Golurk doesn't have to worry about predicting to hit it; this can take the form of Rocky Helmet Cobalion or Galarian Weezing. Otherwise, (comma) very solid Zarude checks such as Togekiss and Incineroar can help Golurk out against Zarude.</p> "

Having access to a strong Knock Off is valued, as it removes items for its teammates and can help break through bulky threats. Its fantastic offensive typing allows it to check a multitude of Pokemon such as Vullaby, Spritzee, Shellder, and Oddish. Sucker Punch allows Pawniard to threaten offensive teams and revenge kill faster threats. A downside to Pawniard is that it is heavily threatened and forced out by common threats such as Timburr, Galarian Farfetch'd, Onix, and Mudbray and can also find itself getting trapped by Trapinch and Diglett.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thief in conjunction with Berry Juice allows Pawniard to steal the opposing Pokemon's item after it consumed its Berry Juice. This option, however, is inferior to the utility and power Knock Off provides. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple any potential switch-ins to Pawniard. Choice Scarf Pawniard can catch opponents off guard and therefore outpace and OHKO Pokemon such as Wingull, and Diglett.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Timburr: Timburr is the biggest threat to Pawniard, as it is able to switch into Pawniard fairly easily and OHKO it. Timburr is also able to use Defog on Pawniard very easily despite Defiant.</p> <p><strong>Other Fighting-types</strong>: Other Fighting-types such as Galarian Farfetch'd and Croagunk all resist Pawniard's Dark-type attacks and can OHKO it in return. Croagunk also has access to STAB priority in Vacuum Wave, which can OHKO Pawniard.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Diglett, Trapinch, Onix, Mudbray, and Drilbur are all able to OHKO Pawniard with Ground-type moves. Trapinch and Diglett specifically are able to trap and KO Pawniard with Earthquake after a free switch from Vullaby's U-turn. Mudbray can constantly switch into Pawniard's moves due to its high bulk backed by its ability in Stamina and threaten it out with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Status: Status problems, especially burns from Ponyta's, Koffing's, and Frillish's Will-O-Wisp, can cripple Pawniard and should be avoided at all costs. Pawniard should also be wary of switching into potential Scald burns from Mareanie, Shellos, and Wingull.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is Pawniard's strongest and most useful STAB move and provides it utility in item removal, which is invaluable team support. Iron Head allows Pawniard to threaten Fairy-types such as Spritzee. Sucker Punch allows Pawniard to pick off weakened threats and revenge kill faster foes such as Galarian Ponyta and Wingull. Sucker Punch can also force a mind game when Diglett traps Pawniard. Pawniard is also a great Stealth Rock user, as it matches up well with the tier's most common Defogger in Vullaby. If a Stealth Rock user is already on the team, Pawniard can opt for Swords Dance to turn itself into a threatening wallbreaker. Brick Break can also be used if the team is particularly weak to opposing Pawniard and Ferroseed.</p> <h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature allows Pawniard to reach a benchmark of 16 Speed, allowing it to Speed tie with Vullaby that are not holding a Choice Scarf as well as outpace Mareanie and Mudbray. 36 Defense and 156 Special Defense EVs allow Pawniard to maximize its bulk in conjunction with Eviolite to better take attacks. This EV distribution also allows Pawniard to avoid the 2HKO from non-Modest Spritzee's Moonblast. The rest of the EVs are invested in Attack to maximize Pawniard's damage output. Defiant is Pawniard's most useful ability, allowing it to pressure Defoggers such as Vullaby and making it a threat versus Sticky Web teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Pawniard should be utilizing Knock Off often throughout the match, punishing switch-ins such as Timburr, Mudbray, Mareanie, and Ferroseed by removing their Eviolite. Pawniard also should be used early- to mid-game to set up Stealth Rock and can do so on a multitude of occasions when switching in on Pokemon such as Oddish, Vullaby, and Ferroseed. Pawniard can also set up Stealth Rock on Pokemon that it forces out, such as Spritzee. Sucker Punch should be used to revenge kill faster and weakened threats. Pawniard should be preserved as a check to Flying-types against teams with Vullaby and can even punish Vullaby for Defogging. Pawniard's HP should also be preserved if the opponent possesses late-game setup sweepers such as Shellder and Zigzagoon. When running Swords Dance, Pawniard can be opted for a late-game sweep when checks and counters such as Timburr are weakened or eliminated.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fighting-type checks such as Spritzee, Koffing, Oddish, and Vullaby are fantastic partners for Pawniard. Pokemon such as Corphish and Nasty Plot Vullaby are able to punish Diglett and Trapinch for revenge killing Pawniard by setting up. Trappers such as Trapinch and Diglett can successfully remove Pokemon such as Onix, Mareanie, and Ponyta. Water-types such as Corphish, Wingull, and Frillish can also threaten Ground-types. Sticky Web setters are great for Pawniard, as they allow Pawniard to outspeed and 2HKO common switch-ins, such as Drilbur, Onix and Ponyta. In addition, Sticky Web is also challenging to remove due to Pawniard's Defiant. Fighting-types such as Timburr and Galarian Farfetch'd appreciate Pawniard's ability to check Fairy-types such as Spritzee. Timburr also appreciates Pawniard switching in easily to Flying-type Pokemon such as Ruflett and Vullaby as well punishing Oddish for using Strength Sap. Setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Vullaby appreciate Eviolite being removed from their checks via Knock Off. Dual screens and Memento users such as Diglett allow Swords Dance Pawniard to set up more easily.</p> "

Defiant allows Bisharp to punish Corviknight and Zapdos's Defog attempts, though Bisharp should watch out for Body Press and Heat Wave, respectively. This dissuades the opposing team from using Defog altogether, which lends Bisharp a very useful niche seeing as keeping entry hazards up is integral to enabling dangerous teammates on hyper offense. Defiant also makes Bisharp a physical attacker that Landorus-T cannot check, as Intimidate will raise Bisharp's Attack instead of lowering it. Fellow Defiant user Galarian Zapdos can fulfill a similar role, but it is held back by its inability to deal with Zapdos. However, Bisharp is both frail and weak to common attacking types, meaning that it cannot reliably switch into much. Additionally, Bisharp heavily relies on Sucker Punch against faster foes, which can be played around. A Jolly nature is preferred to Adamant, as it allows Bisharp to outspeed Heatran, Gliscor, and Zapdos, although the former is not a problem with Sticky Web support. Life Orb notably lets Bisharp OHKO Landorus-T on the switch and OHKO Weavile with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Entry hazard support from a teammate like Landorus-T, Mew, or Shuckle is integral to making the most of Bisharp, as the threat of giving Bisharp a Defiant boost with Defog will often prevent your opponent from using it outright until Bisharp has been dealt with.

An EV spread of 248 HP / 212 SpD / 48 Spe can be used to outpace uninvested base 65 Speed Pokemon like Roselia and Hakamo-o.

Its STAB coverage hits every relevant Pokemon in the tier other than Pawniard for neutral damage, making Vullaby quite difficult to switch into, especially with the added threat of item removal from Knock Off. Defog allows Vullaby to serve as one of the tier's two most reliable hazard removers, owing to its immunity to Sticky Web, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. Vullaby also brings two valuable abilities to the table in Weak Armor and Overcoat; the former allows it to punish teams for hitting it by enabling it to outrun the entire metagame, while the latter protects it from Foongus's Spore. However, despite Vullaby's overall versatility, it is often a jack of all trades and a master of none and can find itself overwhelmed by strong, fast threats.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Vullaby can use a Choice Scarf to serve as a revenge killer and outspeed most of the metagame, although such a set sacrifices its ability to wallbreak with Knock Off followed by Brave Bird, and it is worn down quickly by a lack of healing. Vullaby can run a bulkier set with Overcoat and Eviolite to more reliably Defog and check Pokemon like Abra, Mienfoo, and Timburr, but it loses the advantages it gets from Weak Armor and is forced to play much more passively due to its reduced damage output and its frequent need to Roost. Vullaby can also take an alternative approach to a Nasty Plot sweep by running Overcoat together with Iron Defense and Roost, letting tank hits from Pokemon like Pawniard, Ponyta, and opposing Vullaby rather than outspeed them. However, this set requires more team support to sweep due to having difficulty breaking through Pokemon that resist Air Slash like Onix. Tailwind and Endure are niche options for Berry Juice Vullaby; the former provides team support by boosting its Speed, and the latter lets Vullaby survive a physical hit from Pokemon like boosted Scraggy and proceed to revenge kill them after a Weak Armor Speed boost.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Onix: Onix takes little damage from any of Vullaby's moves other than boosted Dark Pulse and can KO it in return with Rock Blast or Head Smash; moreover, Weak Armor Onix variants can even outspeed Weak Armor-boosted Vullaby after taking a hit. Onix is an extremely sturdy Vullaby switch-in and often gains a free opportunity to set Stealth Rock or setup with Dragon Dance when forcing it out. It must be wary, however, of the threat of switching into a U-turn and being trapped by Trapinch or Diglett; Onix is also worn down by repeated switch-ins and Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Pawniard: Pawniard is not threatened by any of Vullaby's STAB moves and can punish it for using Defog through a Defiant boost. Pawniard must beware, however, of Heat Wave in general and Nasty Plot variants in particular, as they can use it as setup fodder. Pawniard is also threatened by U-turn when Vullaby is paired with a trapper, and Knock Off can compromise Pawniard's ability to check other threats like Porygon and Abra.</p> <p><strong>Spritzee: Spritzee's Fairy-type and tremendous bulk allows it to take any of Vullaby's moves with ease and KO it in return with Moonblast; however, it must be wary of flinches from a boosted Air Slash and becoming overwhelmed by taking too many hits, especially after its Eviolite has been removed due to Knock Off, as Brave Bird can then 2HKO it. Nasty Plot variants of Spritzee are frailer and accordingly less reliable as checks but can use Vullaby as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Fast Attackers</strong>: Vullaby's above-average bulk is often not enough to take attacks from the tier's heavy hitters, especially after Stealth Rock, and its average Speed means it risks being overwhelmed by offensive pressure. Abra, Choice Scarf Porygon, and offensive Mienfoo are particularly threatening.</p> ",

          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Brave Bird deals hefty damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, including bulky defenders like Mienfoo, Timburr, and Foongus. Knock Off allows Vullaby to provide tremendous utility for its team, softening opposing teams by removing Eviolites and Berry Juices from its foes while also being a powerful STAB move. U-turn lets Vullaby take advantage of forced switches by allowing it to generate momentum while wearing down checks like Pawniard. Defog provides invaluable entry hazard removal. Heat Wave is an option that threatens Ferroseed and Pawniard and can force an opponent to make difficult decisions when switching into Vullaby.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Vullaby's EV spread and nature can be altered to fill a highly diverse set of roles, depending its team's needs. A Jolly nature allows Vullaby to Speed tie with opposing positive-natured Vullaby and Pawniard; this Speed is invaluable for teams without Onix. The given EV spread maximizes Vullaby's damage output and, with an Adamant nature, gives it a high chance of OHKOing standard Mienfoo. Other viable investments include 116 HP / 156 Def, which allows Vullaby to survive Timburr's Ice Punch or offensive Regenrator Mienfoo's High Jump Kick after Stealth Rock damage as well as Adamant Vullaby's Brave Bird after a Weak Armor Defense drop and Berry Juice recovery. If you're running Heat Wave, a spread of 156 Atk / 76 Def / 76 SpA / 196 Spe with a Serious nature is optimal; the same spread can alternatively be run with a Jolly nature at the expense of being able to 2HKO Pawniard without relying on Stealth Rock damage. A spread with 116 HP / 156 SpD allows Vullaby to almost always survive Focus Sash Abra's Dazzling Gleam after Stealth Rock. Weak Armor and Berry Juice have tremendous synergy, allowing Vullaby to boost its Speed and proceed to outspeed the majority of the metagame while simultaneously recovering damage taken from certain physical hits like Timburr's Mach Punch or Grookey's Grassy Glide. Weak Armor can occasionally present a hindrance, though, by making it easier for these strong priority to revenge kill Vullaby. Overcoat is an option for teams that need a switch-in to Foongus's Spore at the expense of Weak Armor's broader utility. Berry Juice aids Vullaby by passively healing off Stealth Rock damage, thereby helping it remove entry hazards repeatedly.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Vullaby's EV spread of choice determines the role it fills best on a team; more offensive variants function better as attackers and wallbreakers, while bulkier variants switch into attacks and remove entry hazards more reliably. The momentum generated by U-turn can be leveraged to restrict how foes switch around, especially when Vullaby is paired with a trapper; common Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Pawniard and Onix are often doomed if they switch into a U-turn and and proceed to get trapped by Trapinch and Diglett. Weak Armor can help Vullaby keep faster foes in check on teams that lack Choice Scarf users or lack Speed otherwise. Knock Off should be used to pressure bulkier teams, softening walls like Mareanie, Ferroseed, and Pawniard for other threats to later break through. Defog should be used to remove hazards, especially Sticky Web, whenever possible in order to reduce opposing offensive pressure.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Vullaby's ability to run a variety of different EV spreads and natures to accomplish different goals make an extremely versatile Pokemon that can be molded to support different types of teams. Vullaby pairs well with trappers like Diglett and Trapinch that can remove Onix and Pawniard, two Flying-resistant Pokemon that Vullaby can U-turn out of. Cleaners like offensive Porygon and Galarian Ponyta appreciate Vullaby's tendency to wear down Pawniard. Ponyta appreciates the removal of entry hazards that would slow it down or limit its ability to switch in. Timburr works well with Vullaby, as it can switch into Pawniard and Onix. Defensive Staryu can switch into Onix and provide hazard removal for non-Defog variants.</p> "

Heat Wave is Vullaby's best coverage move, KOing Ferroseed and heavily damaging Pawniard. Dark Pulse lets Vullaby threaten Onix and Frillish, which it otherwise struggles against, as well as Frillish. Roost is an option over Dark Pulse, especially paired with Eviolite, to prevent weaker Pokemon like Mareanie from averting a sweep simply by wearing Vullaby down. Endure is an option, especially for Berry Juice sets, which allows Vullaby to better handle opposing Vullaby, survive hits to activate Berry Juice or Weak Armor, and survive Fake Out from 1 HP.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Eviolite provides Vullaby with opportunities to set up on harder hits such as Vullaby's Brave Bird after a Knock Off and lets it better take hits from Knock Off in general. Alternatively, Berry Juice gives Vullaby more staying power against would-be priority revenge killers like Timburr and Grookey by allowing it to heal while taking hits and setting up. A Modest nature and maximum Special Attack investment are necessary due to Vullaby's middling power, maximum Speed investment lets Vullaby outspeed nearly the entire metagame after boosting with Weak Armor, and the remainder of EVs are placed in Defense to help Vullaby better take physical hits. A Timid nature serves the niche purpose of helping Vullaby better take on opposing Nasty Plot Vullaby.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set sacrifices Vullaby's role compression for late-game sweeping potential. Few Pokemon in the tier can OHKO Vullaby with a physical move, meaning that it is invaluable to keep its health high and force your opponent to hit it with physical moves that will trigger Weak Armor, especially with the likes of Pawniard. Vullaby is typically only afforded one chance to sweep, and unless it carries Knock Off for general team support, it should never be deployed early so long as its checks are healthy and especially if it is the only wincon on its team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Vullaby appreciates Knock Off support from Pokemon like Pawniard and Timburr to soften opposing teams, since it cannot OHKO many bulky Pokemon, such as Eviolite Onix and Mareanie, even when at +2. Trapinch and Diglett can trap and remove Onix, which can switch into unboosted Vullaby and OHKO it with Head Smash. Dewpider can provide Sticky Web support, which prevents Onix and Abra from forcing Vullaby out before a Weak Armor boost. Ponyta and Koffing can spread status to physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, turning them into ideal setup fodder for Vullaby. Staryu can check Onix, provides hazard removal to keep Vullaby healthy, and is indispensable on Nasty Plot Vullaby teams.</p> "

Knock Off may be used instead to punish Ho-Oh and Eternatus while still chasing out Ghost-type Pokemon, but is generally worse. U-turn allows it to gain momentum versus Pokemon like Dragonite that can use Mandibuzz as setup bait. To gain momentum, it is sometimes worth sacrificing a portion of Mandibuzz's health and U-turn against threats to it like Terrakion, Rhyperior, Zacian, and Zeraora. Defog provides entry hazard control. Alternatively, Toxic is an effective punish to several of Mandibuzz's common switch-ins, such as Ampharosite Blissey, Entei, and Zapdos.</p> <p>Mandibuzz has a few issues: a vulnerability to Stealth Rocks impacts its overall effectiveness. If it's inflicted with the poison or burn status, Mandibuzz will be severely crippled.

Mandibuzz also struggles to keep Stealth Rock off the field against threats like Rhyperior, Terrakion, and the ever present Ampharosite Blissey. Since Mandibuzz is faster than Sablenite Corviknight, it will fail to gain momentum when facing it. Finally, the prevalence of Altarianite Entei, Regieleki, and Dragonite is unfavorable to Mandibuzz. To alleviate these matchups, the following are adequate partners: Venusaurite Corviknight, a good defensive blanket check that allows Mandibuzz the freedom to not need defog; Tyranitarite Rhyperior, bringing a key Electric immunity, Stealth Rock, and Entei check; Banettite Toxapex, absorbing status moves and Fairy-type attacks and effectively countering the likes of Ho-Oh.

Foul Play lets Mandibuzz greatly damage physical attackers like Mega Gallade, Dragonite, and Victini while also punishing setup sweepers like Mega Scizor, Mega Charizard X, and Excadrill. Roost allows Mandibuzz to keep itself healthy, giving it longevity and thus allowing it to be an effective defensive pivot throughout the game. Defog is a good utility move that is greatly appreciated by teammates of Mandibuzz, as it keeps them safe from entry hazards like Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes that may plague the entire team. Lastly, U-turn lets Mandibuzz gain momentum on a predicted switch-in against it and bring in an appropriate teammate in the battle safely. 16 Speed EVs let it outspeed Adamant Belly Drum Azumarill and check it with Foul Play. The rest of the EVs are invested into HP and Defense to optimize its overall bulk. Heavy-Duty Boots is used as an item so that Mandibuzz can freely switch in without getting chipped down by Stealth Rock, making it harder for the opposing team to wear it down. Overcoat makes Mandibuzz immune to Spore from Breloom and Amoonguss while also keeping it safe from sand and hail damage.</p> <p>Teammates like Weavile and Greninja like Mandibuzz switching in against physical attacks aimed at them from Pokemon like Excadrill and it creating momentum with U-turn to bring them in safely as well as clearing entry hazards away and allowing them to wallbreak foes much more effectively. Specially defensive Tyranitar can form a defensive core with Mandibuzz, since it can take on special attacks aimed at Mandibuzz while also providing Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave support. Mega Sableye takes the pressure off of Mandibuzz and can check threats like Mega Gallade that can otherwise break apart Dark-type teams, additionally bouncing back any status move aimed at Mandibuzz from Pokemon like Gastrodon and Swampert. It also does great against opposing entry hazard setters like Tyranitar, Blissey, and Ferrothorn. Hydreigon can take care of walls like Toxapex and Hippowdon that Mandibuzz can struggle against. Alolan Muk and Bisharp can cover Fairy-types like Clefable. The former can also absorb special attacks aimed at Mandibuzz well and act as a good wincon when running Curse, while the latter is a good setup sweeper and wallbreaker against defensive types like Poison. Zarude can cover Water-type teams and beat threatening Pokemon like Urshifu-R.</p> "

First Impression is brutally powerful priority that allows Durant to wipe out the likes of Xurkitree and Raikou before they have a chance to attack, while also dealing hefty damage to Seismitoad and Suicune looking to switch into Durant. Iron Head removes bulky Fairy-types like Togekiss, Sylveon, and Galarian Weezing. Superpower crushes Steel-types such as Registeel, Steelix, and Stakataka. Stomping Tantrum hits Poison- and Fire-types such as Toxtricity, Darmanitan, and Volcanion for super effective damage. Crunch is an alternative option that can still hit these Poison- and Fire-types for neutral damage while pummeling Reuniclus beyond the first turn, preventing it from stalling with recovery moves until Durant misses. Both Stomping Tantrum and Crunch hit Metagross, Chandelure, and Doublade. Choice Band can turn Durant into more of a hit-and-run attacker with a little more longevity, but the inability to switch moves can not only make Durant easier to play around, but also make it riskier to revenge kill offensive threats with First Impression.</p> <p>Durant appreciates teammates that can handle Fire-types and faster special attackers. Water-type teammates like Volcanion, Milotic, and Seismitoad are very helpful to take on Fire-types. Volcanion keeps up offensive pressure and can spread Toxic to bulky Water-types trying to handle Durant, while Milotic is capable of bringing Durant in via Flip Turn. Seismitoad can reliably set up Stealth Rock while checking Raikou, a common faster special attacker that is capable of revenge killing Durant easily. Noivern assists with revenge killing against offense, can get Durant in on Fairy-types with U-turn, and is able to check Fire-types. Late-game cleaners, such as Choice Scarf Zarude, Mienshao, and Darmanitan, can capitalize on the holes Durant will usually punch in the opposing team and all can bring Durant into battle via U-turn. Durant can revenge kill many offensive threats, but it's advisable to have additional answers to faster Pokemon capable of taking First Impression at least once like Mienshao, Noivern, and Darmanitan. Noivern can be easily held in check by the likes of Nasty Plot Togekiss and Diancie, with Diancie being particularly notable for setting Stealth Rock and checking Fire-types for Durant. Choice Scarf Mienshao can be handled by Fairy-types like the aforementioned Togekiss, as well as Sylveon and Galarian Weezing. Roserade using Synthesis can handle Raikou effectively while setting Spikes to chip down threats, such as Steelix and Cobalion, into Durant's KO range. While Durant is more at home on offensive teams, Porygon2 is a notable defensive partner for its ability to check faster special attackers, like Choice Scarf Xurkitree and Noivern, and use Teleport to keep up momentum and help Durant get into battle easily.</p> "

Superpower lets Durant hit Steel-types such as Excadrill and Ferrothorn, while Rock Slide targets Flying- and Fire-types such as Mandibuzz and Centiskorch, preventing these Pokemon from reliably switching in and checking Durant. Iron Head gives Durant a reliable attack that does not lower its stats, while Crunch can be used to threaten Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Jellicent.</p> <p>Durant should generally avoid switching into strong attackers directly due to its poor bulk, instead utilizing predicted double switches or switching in after a teammate is KOed. Durant should try to inflict as much damage as possible once switched in, using First Impression to hit faster threats for high damage and using Superpower or Rock Slide to deal with potential defensive switch-ins, such as Lucario and Charizard. Durant's ability to dispose of fast threats is greatly appreciated by defensive teammates such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. Ferrothorn's Grass typing and access to Leech Seed allow it to check Water-types such as Seismitoad and Gyarados that Durant can struggle with and it can also use Stealth Rock or Spikes to weaken Pokemon such as Dracovish so that Durant can KO them with First Impression. Corviknight provides a Ground immunity and can take advantage of Durant's checks such as Toxapex and Aegislash with Taunt. Melmetal is a monstrously powerful wallbreaker that can use its wide movepool to break past Pokemon such as Toxapex and Corviknight that can easily switch into Durant. Aegislash is a bulky attacker that can utilize Toxic or Choice Specs to wear down or break through teams for Durant to clean late-game, while also pressuring Ghost-types that resist First Impression, such as Gengar, with Shadow Ball. In exchange, Durant can threaten Dark-types such as Bisharp and Hydreigon that can try to take advantage of Aegislash. Choice Scarf Duraludon can alleviate pressure from Durant in checking fast threats and can Draco Meteor and Thunderbolt to KO Pokemon such as Dragapult and Pelipper for Durant. Bisharp can utilize Swords Dance and Knock Off to break past bulky Pokemon such as Toxapex and Sableye, allowing Durant to pose a larger threat to teams late-game, as well as Sucker Punch to threaten faster offensive teams in conjunction with Durant.</p> "

Iron Head and X-Scissor are Durant's STAB moves, and they allow it to hit Dark-, Ice-, and Fairy-type Pokemon such as the Hydreigon, Galarian Darmanitan, and Sylveon.

This is further complemented by its decent Speed allowing it to outpace common offensive Pokemon such as offensive Landorus-T, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele. On top of all this, Hydreigon's defensive typing, ability, and Roost let it check Heatran extremely effectively and come in on slower defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Slowking with ease. However, although Hydreigon has passable Speed, it is still outpaced and OHKOed by common Pokemon such as Dragapult, Weavile, and Tapu Koko. It will also often be checked by some Pokemon such as Fairy-types, which it struggles to break through without Flash Cannon, and Blissey, which it can't do much to without Nasty Plot boosts.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydreigon's movepool has options to cover certain defensive Pokemon at the cost of the neutral coverage its listed options provide; for instance, Superpower lets Hydreigon lure in Blissey and 2HKO it. Choice Scarf Hydreigon is a decent offensive pivot with U-turn and can also function as a revenge killer, but it oftentimes doesn't want to be locked into any of its attacks. Substitute improves Hydreigon's matchup versus offensive teams, as it eases prediction when forcing switches, as well as scouting Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T. Substitute also allows Hydreigon to shield itself from status effects from Pokemon such as Toxapex. A bulkier set with Defog is a viable option to check Heatran even better, as well as other Pokemon such as Blacephalon, but it is passive and overall very niche.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Hydreigon's 4x weakness to Fairy makes Pokemon of this type solid checks to it. Clefable and Tapu Fini can survive any attack from full health and OHKO or heavily damage Hydreigon in return; however, Clefable is OHKOed by +2 Flash Cannon, and Tapu Fini can become too worn down to be able to pivot into Hydreigon's attacks. Rarer Unaware Clefable sets tend to check it better. Tapu Koko easily outspeeds Hydreigon and OHKOes it, although it can't pivot into Earth Power. The rarer Choice Scarf Tapu Fini also outpaces Hydreigon and OHKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Blissey: Blissey can tank just about any attack Hydreigon uses, up to a +4 Life Orb Draco Meteor, and cripple it with status or use Teleport to gain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Kartana and Tornadus-T can easily outpace Hydreigon and pick it off if it is chipped a little bit. Weavile can outpace and OHKO Hydreigon, while Zeraora can also pick off a chipped Hydreigon. Common Dragon-types such as Dragapult, Sand Rush-boosted Dracozolt, and Garchomp all outpace Hydreigon. The former two can easily OHKO with Draco Meteor, while Garchomp can potentially OHKO it with Life Orb-boosted Scale Shot.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage: Hydreigon is prone to being worn down by status effects from Pokemon it commonly pivots against, such as Toxapex and Slowbro. This is also compounded by how often in can pivot into Heatran's Magma Storm. Because of this damage, Hydreigon can be pressured into using Roost too often.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R, Hawlucha, and Galarian Zapdos can all pivot into Hydreigon's attacks due to the rarity of Draco Meteor and OHKO it. Pokemon that run Fighting-type coverage, such as Rillaboom and Aegislash, which Hydreigon should be otherwise able to pivot into, threaten it as well.</p> ",

Earth Power OHKOes Heatran, hits Toxapex and Melmetal for super effective damage, and hits most Dark-resistant Pokemon neutrally. Flash Cannon provides coverage for Clefable while still hitting Tyranitar for super effective damage. Roost is mandatory to consistently pivot into Pokemon such as the aforementioned Heatran, Toxapex, and Slowking. Draco Meteor can be used over Flash Cannon or Earth Power to heavily dent most Pokemon, better pressure Mandibuzz as well as defensive Dragonite, and OHKO Urshifu-R, although the Special Attack drop usually forces Hydreigon to switch out after. Flamethrower can also be used over either coverage move to better pressure Corviknight. Life Orb is the best item for this set, as it allows Hydreigon to OHKO Heatran as well as 2HKO Clefable and Slowking. However, if your team needs Hydreigon's defensive capabilities, Leftovers lets it stay around longer, pivot into Heatran's Magma Storm more consistently, and negate burn damage from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Slowbro.</p> <p>Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana put both Ferrothorn and Corviknight in 2HKO range of Dark Pulse by using Knock Off as they switch in; in return, Hydreigon offers a consistent switch-in to Heatran, which can be especially helpful if either one of them is Choice locked into a Grass-type move. Zeraora and Dragapult, when paired with Hydreigon, can overwhelm shared checks such as Clefable and Ferrothorn. Steel-types such as Corviknight, Scizor, and Heatran can check Fairy-types and appreciate Hydreigon checking Heatran; Scizor also has the added benefit of checking Kyurem, while Heatran can help overwhelm Tyranitar and Hippowdon. Pivots that can bring Hydreigon safely are solid teammates as well; Tapu Koko can lure in Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon and use U-turn to bring Hydreigon in. Corviknight is another U-turn pivot that can lure in Rotom-W and Toxapex for Hydreigon. Slowking and Blissey can also pivot with Teleport, and Slowking can help overwhelm foes with Future Sight in combination with Hydreigon's attacks; the two also have decent defensive synergy with Hydreigon. Toxapex has good defensive synergy with Hydreigon and appreciates it stopping Heatran from trapping it. Clefable appreciates Hydreigon checking Heatran and can even heal status effects from it, like Toxic poison from Heatran and Toxapex, with Aromatherapy.</p> "

Earth Power is a coverage option that immediately threatens Heatran and lets Hydreigon break through Tyranitar after a Nasty Plot boost, although Flash Cannon can potentially OHKO Clefable after a Nasty Plot boost and still hit Tyranitar super effectively. Roost is crucial to help Hydreigon better function as a stallbreaker as well as pivot into Heatran, Toxapex, and Slowbro consistently. Life Orb gives Hydreigon a noticeable boost to its power, allowing it to OHKO Corviknight and Clefable with one boost. However, Leftovers is a viable choice to improve its longevity, as Hydreigon still has decent power after a boost and may appreciate pivoting better and possibly setting up on the aforementioned Heatran and Slowbro. Hydreigon can opt for a Modest nature for more power, hitting benchmarks such as a guaranteed OHKO on Clefable with +2 Flash Cannon, although it loses out on the ability to outpace many notable Pokemon such as Kyurem. Draco Meteor is an option over Earth Power or Flash Cannon, as it has absurd power after a Nasty Plot boost, although its Special Attack drops and lack of coverage hinder it as an option.

Galarian Slowking can also use Future Sight to punish Steel-type switch-ins such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Ironically, Corviknight and Skarmory make for decent teammates, as they can check Garchomp and Kartana; Corviknight, once again, can lure in Pokemon such as Zapdos and bring in Hydreigon with U-turn, while Skarmory can provide Spikes to wear down Hydreigon's checks such as Tapu Fini.

          "description": "<p>Nasty Plot makes Hydreigon one of the premiere special breakers in the tier, given its already strong STAB combination of Draco Meteor and Dark Pulse. Draco Meteor is for taking down Dragon-types such as Dracovish, Dracozolt, Kommo-o, and opposing non-Haban Berry Hydreigon. Dark Pulse is for hitting Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Chandelure and non-Dazzling Gleam Celebi. Nasty Plot allows for Hydreigon to boost its Special Attack, letting it break through bulkier Pokemon such as Type: Null, Aegislash, Galarian Corsola, and Silvally. Taunt allows for Hydreigon to break down bulkier Pokemon that rely on setting up, namely stall Snorlax and Gastrodon, whereas Fire Blast is coverage for Steel-types such as Bisharp, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn. Focus Blast can be run in order to OHKO Choice Band Diggersby, alongside most of the Steel-types mentioned, but is generally less reliable. Haban Berry is to tank other Dragon-type attacks such as Draco Meteor from Dragapult and Outrage from both Choice Scarf Dracovish and Dracozolt. The EVs are for tanking Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Dragapult and Low Kick from Adamant Dracozolt. 212 Speed EVs allow Hydreigon to outspeed Braviary. If you are running Fire Blast, you have to use the EV spread of 72 HP / 12 Def / 172 SpA / 252 Spe so you can outspeed and OHKO Adamant Galarian Darmanitan with Fire Blast. Alternatively, you can run 80 HP / 104 Def / 72 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature, which lets Hydreigon live Low Kick from Dracozolt. Another EV set of 88 HP / 96 SpA / 72 SpD / 252 Spe could be used with a Timid nature, which lets you tank Modest Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor if you run Fire Blast. All of these spreads outspeed Choice Band Haxorus, non-Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and Modest Choice Specs Gengar.</p> <p>Hydreigon's Dark / Dragon typing makes it susceptible to Fairy-types such as Primarina, Sylveon, Aromatisse, and Gardevoir. Because of this, Steel- and Poison-types such as Ferrothorn, Durant, and Silvally-Poison work really well with Hydreigon. Hydreigon, in return, is able to take out stall Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Mandibuzz and offensive Pokemon like Excadrill and Adamant Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan. Hydreigon is also troubled by physical attackers such as Conkeldurr, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Unnerve Choice Band, or Haban Berry Haxorus, and Avalugg. Fairy-types such as Primarina, Sylveon, and Aromatisse all pair well with Hydreigon, as they are able to cover Hydreigon's physical weaknesses, while Hydreigon can take on Poison-type threats such as Toxtricity and Silvally-Poison. Hydreigon is able to deal with these Pokemon by setting upon them and OHKOing or inflicting them with Taunt to prevent them from setting up.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Volcarona is a devastating setup sweeper on Bug teams that easily cleans through weakened teams thanks to Quiver Dance and its overall solid natural special bulk. Quiver Dance allows Volcarona to become a dangerous setup sweeper, increasing its Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed all by one stage, making it harder to revenge kill for special attackers such as Hydreigon and Hatterene. Flamethrower is a reliable Fire-type STAB move for Volcarona that allows it to take on Pokemon such as Corviknight and Alolan Ninetales. Psychic allows Volcarona to hit Pokemon such as Toxapex, which resist its Fire-type attacks and would otherwise wall it. Heavy-Duty Boots and Roost increase Volcarona's longevity by allowing it to ignore its weakness to entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, and recover its health throughout the match, giving itself more opportunities to use Quiver Dance. Giga Drain is an option over Roost, as it also provides a form of recovery; while not as reliable, it can target Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Keldeo, Seismitoad, and Hippowdon. Flame Body can burn physical attackers, allowing Volcarona to take them on more easily. Volcarona should try to set up with Quiver Dance against Pokemon that do not threaten it, allowing it to safely sweep. The given EVs and a Timid nature allow Volcarona to move as fast and hit as powerful as it can to maximize its role as a sweeper.</p> <p>Shuckle is the designated entry hazard lead for Bug teams and supports Volcarona by setting Stealth Rock and Sticky Web, allowing it to be faster than threats such as Salazzle and take on defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex. Scizor can take on Fairy- and Rock-type Pokemon such as Azumarill and Terrakion for Volcarona and beat Keldeo with Dual Wingbeat. Scizor also can remove items from other Pokemon such as Porygon2's Eviolite with Knock Off. Galvantula can help Volcarona in the Water and Flying matchup by spamming Thunder, greatly threatening everything on both types, as well as hitting Seismitoad and Gastrodon with Energy Ball. Moreover, Agility allows Volcarona to take on rain-based Water teams with more ease. In return, Volcarona can take on Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Aegislash for it. Vikavolt is a bulkier option over Galvantula with more power, although it is less preferred due to its terrible Speed. Heracross acts as a revenge killer, being able to outpace Pokemon such as Zeraora and Terrakion for Volcarona and damage them with Close Combat. Scolipede is great in the mirror matchup, as it can act as a check to opposing Volcarona thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots and Protect, allowing it to then revenge kill +1 Volcarona with Rock Slide as well as Choice Scarf Charizard. Scolipede can also punish Pokemon such as Azumarill with Poison Jab for Volcarona. Ribombee is mainly used for the Dragon matchup, being able to clean easily through the type after a single Quiver Dance; in return, Volcarona can weaken Dragalge for it. Araquanid is great for soaking up Fire-type attacks for Volcarona and can dish out powerful Water-type STAB attacks in return.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Volcarona performs the role of a threatening setup sweeper for Fire-type teams. It has the coveted Quiver Dance, good Special Attack, and passable Speed stat, which allow it to threaten a plethora of teams, given the chance to set up. Quiver Dance is the most important move on the set, as it lets Volcarona be an offensive juggernaut, allowing it to outspeed and beat threat like Choice Scarf Dracovish after minor chip damage. Fire Blast is its strongest STAB move and should be used to break through Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Hatterene, Corviknight, and Galarian Weezing after a Quiver Dance boost. Psychic is used to threaten Poison- and Fighting-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Dragalge, and Keldeo. Roost allows Volcarona to keep itself healthy and set up easily against types like Electric, Ghost, Dragon, and Psychic without getting worn out. Bug Buzz allows Volcarona to threaten Psychic- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Slowbro and Tyranitar, which can shrug off other attacks from it. It also has the added benefit of hitting Pokemon behind Substitute like Heliolisk and Seismitoad. Volcarona should seek opportunities to set up against Pokemon that do not threaten it like Mew and Galarian Weezing. It should be used mid- or late-game once its checks and counters like Incineroar, Snorlax, and specially defensive Toxapex are taken out or weakened enough. Maximum Special Attack EVs optimize its overall damage output, while maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Volcarona to Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon and outspeed slower Pokemon like Excadrill, Indeedee-M, and Hydreigon. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures that Volcarona is not susceptible to any form of entry hazard, which can otherwise undermine its ability as a setup sweeper.</p> <p>Physical attackers like Cinderace, Darmanitan, and Alolan Marowak appreciate Volcarona taking on physical walls like Slowbro and Seismitoad. In return, they threaten special walls like Tyranitar if Volcarona is not running Bug Buzz and take on Dark teams as a whole. Torkoal is the premier support Pokemon and a great partner, as it provides Volcarona with important Drought support; this not only allows it to hit much harder with sun-boosted Fire Blast, but it also reduces the damage from Water-type moves, giving it the opportunity to set up against Pokemon like Rotom-W. Yawn support from Torkoal lets Volcarona set up more easily against an asleep foe. Incineroar with its Knock Off and Taunt utility can weaken defensive cores of Normal- and Poison-type teams, letting Volcarona wreak havoc after a Quiver Dance boost. Charizard can wallbreak in sun thanks to its ability Solar Power and take on Pokemon like Choice Scarf Dracovish, which Volcarona cannot handle without setting up. Additionally, they form a good core against Dragon-type teams. Rotom-H can provide Volcarona with dual screen support, which lets Volcarona set up much more easily, or it can use a Nasty Plot set to weaken shared checks like Toxapex and Mantine. Salazzle can cripple troublesome Pokemon like Mantine, Jellicent, and specially defensive Toxapex, which can prove to be a pain otherwise for Volcarona.</p> "

Hidden Power Ground bypasses Heatran after its Air Balloon has been popped, which can otherwise wall it. Giga Drain can be used instead to nail bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Gastrodon, Slowking, and Hippowdon while also granting a bit of recovery. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Volcarona to switch in throughout the game despite its huge Stealth Rock weakness. Volcarona should try setting up against a passive Pokemon like Toxapex or Mandibuzz once its checks such as Mantine are weakened or KOed, allowing it to pull off a clean sweep. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Volcarona to outspeed Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mimikyu unboosted while outspeeding Choice Scarf users such as Excadrill and Landorus-T after a Quiver Dance boost.</p> <p>Choice Scarf users like Buzzwole and Heracross are great partners to revenge kill faster threats such as Garchomp and Mega Lopunny.

Fire Blast hits neutral targets such as Zapdos for good damage while nailing Grass- and Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Aegislash.

Volcarona should avoid switching in when Stealth Rock is up or getting poisoned or paralyzed, as both greatly harm its sweeping potential.

The one area Cobalion is truly lacking in is Special Defense, though; faster special attackers like Salazzle and Raikou can force it out, and it cannot consistently answer special attackers like Dragalge and Gardevoir unlike most other Steel-type Pokemon in the tier. Cobalion should always be paired with teammates that can cover that weakness.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Calm Mind Cobalion sets can be used, but they lack the immediate power of Swords Dance and require Cobalion to use the inaccurate Focus Blast as its primary Fighting-type STAB move. Life Orb seems appealing on Swords Dance sets, but Cobalion wants to be able to take advantage of its bulk throughout the game. A defensive EV spread could be considered for slower teams, though other Steel-type Pokemon like Registeel and Stakataka typically perform that role better.

Toxic can be used instead to punish Pokemon that block Volt Switch like Seismitoad, though it leaves Cobalion unable to generate momentum efficiently. Stone Edge can also be considered to punish Flying-type switch-ins like Noivern, Crobat, and Talonflame. Thunder Wave accomplishes this as well and is generally useful for crippling the opposing team. Maximum Speed is necessary to outpace Pokemon like Zarude and Mienshao. Attack EV investment is preferred over HP investment because Cobalion's natural bulk is typically sufficient. Justified in tandem with Cobalion's solid bulk allows Cobalion to switch into Knock Off from Pokemon like Obstagoon and Choice-locked Heracross very well. Rocky Helmet is the item of choice for Cobalion because it wears down many of the physical attackers Cobalion is sent into and punishes U-turn spam from Zarude. Chople Berry is another option that serves as a safety net against Close Combat from Zarude, Obstagoon, and Glastrier.

Roserade can check Raikou, Xurkitree, and Gastrodon while also setting up Spikes and switching into Scald for Cobalion. Togekiss, Crobat, and Noivern check other Fighting-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Mienshao and Heracross. Crobat and Noivern have the added bonus of forming a VoltTurn core with Cobalion, augmenting its ability to generate momentum and wear down the opposing team. Cobalion is a Steel-type that does not resist Fairy and Psychic, so it needs teammates that can help it handle Pokemon of those types.

Assault Vest Reuniclus can also check these Electric-type Pokemon while providing Future Sight support to help break through the likes of Seismitoad and Volcanion.

Iron Head hits Fairy-types that are threatening for Fighting teams, such as Clefable and Hatterene, for super effective damage. Cobalion can also use Thunder Wave to cripple Pokemon such as Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir and Dragapult, making them less of a threat. Alternatively, Cobalion can be used as a pivot with Volt Switch to gain momentum for the team.

Cobalion appreciates Terrakion removing Fire-type Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Charizard and Choice Scarf Darmanitan, both of which threaten Cobalion. Thunder Wave can also cripple faster threats such as Gengar, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir, which can allow Swords Dance Terrakion and Calm Mind Keldeo to sweep teams more easily. Teammates also appreciate Cobalion's Volt Switch, allowing them to safely come into the battle. Faster Taunt users such as Froslass can prevent Cobalion from setting up Stealth Rock, and faster hazard setters such as Ribombee can freely set up Sticky Web before Cobalion is able to use Taunt on them.</p> "

Close Combat is its most reliable STAB move and should be used most of the time, as it hits hard with no real drawbacks. It is also used to hit Ground- and Steel-type Pokemon like Hippowdon and Ferrothorn. Stone Edge takes care of troublesome Flying-type Pokemon such as Togekiss and Pelipper.

Other setup sweepers like Hawlucha, and Lucario are great teammates, as they all weaken each other's checks and counters while taking care of Grass- and Fairy-type threats like Vileplume and Gardevoir, respectively. Lucario with Dark Pulse can be used to deal with Aegislash if Terrakion has Rock Polish over Earthquake. Urshifu-S can wallbreak with a Choice Band or Bulk Up set to take care of Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon like Dragapult and Indeedee, while Heracross appreciates Terrakion's wallbreaking capabilities to clean teams late-game with a Choice Scarf and Moxie . Keldeo forms a great wallbreaking core with Terrakion, as it can take care of bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon and stop defensive Pokemon with Taunt. Kommo-o can be a mixed sweeper to open up holes mid- or late-game; it also deals with Scizor and Aegislash with Flamethrower for the team. Cobalion can utilize a Choice Scarf set to cover faster Pokemon that Terrakion cannot handle without Rock Polish like Alolan Ninetales. Alternatively, Cobalion can utilize a support set providing Terrakion with Stealth Rock, Taunt, and Thunder Wave support. Conkeldurr can provide Terrakion with Defog support, as it is susceptible to all forms of entry hazards, especially Sticky Web, undermining its potential to wallbreak or clean late-game.</p> "

Focus Blast lets Tornadus-T hit Tyranitar and Steel-type switch-ins such as Heatran super effectively. Knock Off is used as a consistent means of punishing defensive switch-ins like Zapdos, Heatran, and Blissey by removing their item to force progress and make them more vulnerable to other threats in the long run.

Its ability grants it the longevity to spam Knock Off against defensive Pokemon using Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots and pivot with little risk with U-turn on forced switches, clearing the way for teammates to break through walls.

U-turn allows Tornadus-T to switch out of unfavorable matchups, such as the myriad of Electric-types that it invites in, and gain momentum after threatening something with Hurricane.

Iron Tail has unreliable accuracy but gives Tornadus-T a great defensive type in Steel. U-turn in the first two slots gives it slightly more power as a pivot, but a Bug typing is generally less useful than a Flying typing.

Its absurdly high 145 base Special Attack lets it 2HKO Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Hatterene, even when unboosted, and its unique base 101 Speed lets it outspeed base 100s like Jirachi and Salamence. It also has the necessary coverage to get past every one of its checks, boasting powerful moves like Focus Blast, Sludge Wave, and Psychic. Volt Absorb also allows Thundurus-T to block Volt Switch attempts from Raikou and Rotom-W. Despite its amazing Special Attack, Thundurus-T will be walled by at least some of its checks, since it can't fit all of its coverage moves at the same time. It is also frail and slower than Pokemon like Nihilego and Keldeo, making it prone to being revenge killed by them and other faster threats. It also can't take priority moves like Accelerock and Ice Shard from Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine. Thundurus-T's weakness to Stealth Rock almost mandates the use of Heavy-Duty Boots, which limits its wallbreaking capabilities by removing items such as Life Orb and Choice Specs. Finally, Thundurus-T faces competition with its own Incarnate form, as it can run mixed sets more reliably and is way faster, improving its matchup against Pokemon like Keldeo, Zarude, and Nihilego.</p> ",

However, by giving up one of its coverage moves, it will be forced to switch out against some of its other checks. A pivoting set with Volt Switch / Thunderbolt / Psychic / Focus Blast is an option, but Thundurus-T is generally outclassed in this role by its Incarnate form, which has better Speed.

Dragon Dance can be used against Pokemon it forces out such as Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Necrozma-DM. Flare Blitz and Outrage offer nearly unresisted coverage, with Flare Blitz scaring out staples such as Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Zacian-C, and Outrage taking care of the likes of Zygarde-C, Eternatus, Kyogre, and Ho-Oh. Both moves heavily benefit from Dynamax removing their drawbacks, especially Outrage. On top of that, Max Flare summons sun, powering Reshiram up considerably, and Max Wyrmwind dropping the foe's Attack allows Reshiram to come out on top against Groudon. Roost offsets damage inflicted by entry hazards, Life Orb, and Flare Blitz recoil.

Xerneas is also a great partner, as it can take care of Pokemon that can be troublesome for unboosted Reshiram, like Palkia and Zekrom, and can serve as a check for Ditto, since Ditto copying Reshiram needs to either Dynamax and risk the Speed tie or become setup fodder for Xerneas by locking itself into Outrage. Xerneas also appreciates Reshiram's ability to pressure Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Zacian-C, and Necrozma-DM. Zacian-C is a good partner for Reshiram, as it can take care of faster Dragon-types such as Palkia and other faster attackers like Marshadow.

Necrozma-DM is great for checking Zacian-C, as unboosted Reshiram has problems with it. Lunala can help Reshiram by checking defensive Zygarde-C and other setup sweepers, like Zekrom and Groudon, that can take care of a unboosted Reshiram.</p> "

Yveltal, as well as Calyrex-S, can also massively threaten Zekrom's best check in Lunala. On bulkier teams, Lunala can also help with Zygarde-C and Groudon. Moreover, Lunala fully Imposter-proofs Zekrom against Ditto. Specially defensive Yveltal is an important partner for Zekrom, as it can come in on Calyrex-S for it and use Defog to get rid of entry hazards. Necrozma-DM can come in on Fairy-type attacks from Zacian-C and Xerneas while also providing Thunder Wave support to slow the opposing team down. Zacian-C can help Zekrom whittle down their shared checks in Groudon, Lunala, and Zygarde-C while also luring in Necrozma-DM, enabling Zekrom to easily set up. Both Zacian-C and Xerneas can also hard switch into Ditto looking to lock itself into Dragon Claw or Outrage.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Zekrom is a major threat to balance and stall teams in Anything Goes, as it's able to take advantage of common defensive Pokemon and lacks consistent defensive counterplay outside of Arceus-Ground and Lunala. Substitute allows Zekrom to safely set up on Pokemon that cannot break it in a single hit, including Ferrothorn, Ho-Oh, and Stealth Rock Necrozma-DM. It also prevents Choice Scarf users like Ditto and Mega Rayquaza from revenge killing it, eases prediction if the opponent tries to pivot around Zekrom's STAB moves, and stalls out foes' Dynamax turns. Outrage is needed for its high damage output, allowing Zekrom to OHKO base forme Zygarde at +1, although it has the detrimental side effect of locking Zekrom into the move if it doesn't Dynamax. Dragon Claw gives Zekrom a safer Dragon-type STAB move to use, but it's extremely weak and doesn't OHKO base forme Zygarde at +1 even when boosted by Life Orb; it also makes Ditto more dangerous, since it can Dynamax to break its Choice lock after it revenge kills Zekrom. A Jolly nature allows Zekrom to outspeed Zacian-C at +1 and Modest Xerneas and Yveltal unboosted. Leftovers increases the number of times Zekrom is able to use Substitute, helping it to break through foes like Ferrothorn more easily. Haban Berry is an option that lets Zekrom survive a boosted Outrage from Ditto while Dynamaxed, as well as Draco Meteor from Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza and Dynamax Cannon from Eternatus, in order to KO these threats back; however, Leftovers is hard to give up, and a Ditto that's locked into Outrage is already easy to exploit with partners like Xerneas. Life Orb is another option that gives a nice boost to Zekrom's damage output, but it can severely hurt its longevity in tandem with Substitute. Teravolt notably allows Zekrom to bypass abilities like Multiscale, Sturdy, Unaware, and Wonder Guard, although it doesn't ignore Lunala's Shadow Shield.</p> <p>Zekrom has great Dynamaxing potential. Under Dynamax, Bolt Strike turns into Max Lightning, powering up Zekrom's Electric-type moves even further by setting Electric Terrain; Zekrom can potentially break past defensive Lunala with two boosted Max Lightnings if it manages to play around Will-O-Wisp correctly. Max Wyrmwind allows Zekrom to break through Ground-types without being forced to lock into a move; it 2HKOes Arceus-Ground and defensive Primal Groudon at +1. It also helpfully lowers Primal Groudon's Attack stat, rendering said foe unable to deal much damage to Zekrom when also accounting for the extra bulk from Dynamax. However, it's important to note that Dynamaxing will cause Zekrom to lose its Substitute, leaving it susceptible to revenge killing from the likes of Ditto. Also, Zekrom cannot Dynamax or change moves while it's locked into Outrage, so in the meantime, it can be taken advantage of by foes like Geomancy Xerneas.</p> <p>Zekrom fits best on bulky offense teams that can make up for the momentum loss it creates when it uses Outrage. Defensive Necrozma-DM is a strongly recommended partner, as it's able to handle Xerneas and Zacian-C if they try to take advantage of Zekrom while it's locked into the move. Ditto can also revenge kill these threats, but it needs prior chip damage on Xerneas to KO it, especially if Xerneas can still Dynamax. Ho-Oh is a fantastic teammate that shuts down Zekrom's most reliable checks in support Arceus-Ground and Lunala, while Zekrom can pressure teams with Zygarde-C for Ho-Oh. Similarly, Arceus-Ground checks Primal Groudon for Zekrom, while Zekrom can pressure teams with Ho-Oh for Arceus-Ground. Xerneas and Zacian-C are helpful partners to revenge kill opposing Ditto; if Ditto has locked into Outrage, it won't be able to Dynamax to break its Choice lock. Zacian-C can also weaken shared checks like Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Lunala for Zekrom. Yveltal is a strong offensive partner that can switch into Ground-type attacks and clean late-game once Zekrom has weakened the opposition.</p> "

Moreover, its coverage can threaten almost every Pokemon in the metagame. Landorus's Speed sets it apart from other wallbreakers, the majority of which have a base Speed between 90 and 100. However, common threats like Marshadow and Calyrex-S outspeed and threaten it. While Landorus's Ground / Flying typing gives it two useful immunities that allow it to switch in on Pokemon like Groudon, its lack of bulk doesn't allow it to switch in often. Overall, Landorus has a unique role in the Ubers metagame, even though it competes with other special attackers like Eternatus and Calyrex-S.</p> ",

Rock Slide lets Landorus hit Flying-types such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal while giving almost perfect neutral coverage alongside Earth Power. Knock Off's main utility is to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon, making it extremely useful to apply pressure with entry hazards. Sludge Wave is an option to prevent Xerneas from using Geomancy in front of Landorus, leaving Xerneas vulnerable to priority or even OHKOing it if Stealth Rock is up. Thanks to the pressure Landorus applies on the opposite team, it can also easily set up Stealth Rock. As far as Superpower is concerned, it allows Landorus to hit special walls like Blissey and Ferrothorn hard. Explosion is a useful option on hyper offense teams with Sticky Web, preventing the foe from using Defog or Rapid Spin. Sheer Force negates Life Orb recoil when using Earth Power, Rock Slide, or Sludge Wave. A Naive nature along with maximum investment in Speed allows Landorus to outspeed common base 90 and 100 Speed Pokemon, while maximizing its damage from Rock Slide and Superpower.</p> <p>Landorus appreciates entry hazards being up on the opponent's field to help it wallbreak; therefore, Spikes support from Ferrothorn greatly helps it. Necrozma-DM is a good teammate too if Landorus doesn't have Stealth Rock. Also, Pokemon like Ho-Oh work well with Landorus, since they can switch in on Pokemon that threaten Landorus while also being able to use Defog. Pivots such as Yveltal and Blissey allow Landorus to switch safely onto the field, since it's relatively frail. Paralysis spreaders like Ho-Oh and Xerneas remedy one of the main weaknesses of Landorus: its Speed. Offensive partners such as Marshadow and Calyrex-S appreciate Landorus's ability to remove their checks or their checks' items; in return, they can eliminate faster threats, which Landorus can't handle.</p> "

Sludge Wave threatens the Grass-types that resist Earth Power, such as Tapu Bulu and Celebi, while OHKOing Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Hatterene. Focus Blast nails Dark-, Ice-, and Normal-types, like Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Porygon2, while hitting Skarmory without relying on Gravity and targeting Ferrothorn. Gravity removes Ground immunities from foes that would otherwise check Landorus such as Celesteela, Rotom-W, and Zapdos, making Landorus's Earth Power and its teammates' Ground-type STAB moves much more spammable. It also ensures Focus Blast always lands, heightening Landorus's reliability in the Normal, Dark, and Steel matchups. Life Orb works well in tandem with Sheer Force, which negates Life Orb's recoil and adds to its damage boost. A Timid nature is needed in order for Landorus to outspeed common foes like Victini, Tapu Lele, and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Excadrill pairs extremely well with Landorus, as it can deal with specially defensive walls that Landorus struggles with, such as Blissey and Slowking, while outspeeding fast threats to Landorus like Choice Scarf Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Mega Lopunny when under sand.

Hippowdon provides a switch-in against certain foes that can outspeed and threaten Landorus such as Mega Gallade, Cinderace, and Garchomp. It also wears down most foes with Stealth Rock and Sand Stream, which Landorus generally appreciates. Gastrodon and Seismitoad both switch completely freely into Water-type attacks from the likes of Mega Swampert, Keldeo, and Mantine for Landorus. Gastrodon is also able to reliably take and heal off most other moves from Water-types thanks to its high bulk and Recover, while Seismitoad is one of the best ways for Ground teams to offensively deal with them. Mamoswine deals with troublesome Dragon-types such as Latias, Mega Latios, and Dragonite as well as Flying-types that Landorus relies on Gravity in order to beat, like Zapdos and Dragonite. Garchomp and Mega Garchomp are fearsome wallbreakers that pressure specially defensive walls like Blissey and Slowking while providing a Water neutrality.

Furthermore, it can be a great wallbreaker or Choice Scarf user thanks to its high Attack and access to EdgeQuake coverage. However, its lack of reliable recovery hurts its ability to check certain Pokemon consistently, as it can get pressured and overwhelmed throughout the game.

Defensive sets can utilize Defog, as Landorus-T has a favorable matchup against Stealth Rock setters such as Heatran and Tyranitar. However, it's rather inconsistent, especially against entry hazard setters that carry Toxic like Garchomp and opposing Landorus-T. Rocky Helmet can be used on defensive sets to punish contact moves, especially U-turn from Rillaboom, Tapu Koko, and opposing Landorus-T, at the cost of not having a way to maintain health. Soft Sand can be used on Swords Dance sets for more offensive pressure, making it even harder for Pokemon like Slowbro and Hippowdon to keep Landorus-T in check, although this leaves it without passive recovery. Protect can be used on defensive sets to gain extra Leftovers recovery, making Landorus-T harder to wear down. It can also waste Defog PPs from Corviknight, which can otherwise use Pressure to stall out Stealth Rock. Additionally, it can scout Choice-locked attackers like Choice Specs Dragapult and Kyurem, making them easier to play around; however, Landorus-T struggles to fit it over any other moves. A Double Dance set with Rock Polish and Swords Dance can make Landorus-T much harder to check. Although, finding a chance to use both setup moves is difficult, often forcing it to choose between the two. Other Swords Dance sets with moves such as Fly to hit Grass-types like Tangrowth or Gravity to hit Ground-immune targets can be used, but they're rather inconsistent. A Choice Band set can be used to take advantage of Landorus-T's high Attack and strong coverage, although it requires a lot more prediction to pull off.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Slowbro is a great defensive answer to Landorus-T by virtue of its high Defense, which means it can take hits well and retaliate with Scald or Ice Beam, although it dislikes taking a Toxic.

Offensive Water-types like Urshifu-R, Barraskewda, and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini can easily revenge kill Landorus-T. Urshifu-R is notably good at taking down Substitute variants thanks to Surging Strikes.</p> <p><strong>Corviknight and Skarmory: Thanks to their typing and excellent defensive stats, both of these Pokemon take very little from Landorus-T's attacks and are immune to Toxic. Corviknight can clear Stealth Rock with Defog, use Brave Bird to chip away at Landorus-T, or use U-turn to pivot out into a teammate. Skarmory can set up its own entry hazards, threaten Landorus-T with Toxic, or use Iron Defense to make tanking hits easier and be one of the best counters to Swords Dance sets.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tangrowth can easily wall Landorus-T due to its typing and good Defense; Ferrothorn can also take a hit from Landorus-T, although it struggles against Swords Dance variants.

Rillaboom can revenge kill offensive Landorus-T with Grassy Glide and also summon Grassy Terrain to lower Earthquake's damage, but it dislikes switching into U-turn or Toxic from other sets.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Landorus-T's mediocre special bulk means it can easily be KOed by special attackers such as Tapu Lele, Dragapult, and Latios.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon and Coverage: Ice-types such as Kyurem and Weavile can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T and easily OHKO it.

Because of this, Landorus-T also makes for an excellent Dynamax user, dishing out powerful Max Moves such as Max Airstream and Max Quake. Intimidate is a vital tool in as it allows the team to mitigate damage from strong physical threats such as Rillaboom and Kartana. However, Landorus-T packs a few significant downsides, including a 4x weakness to Ice, so it falls very quickly to Porygon2 and Glastrier.

Substitute variants can annoy and PP stall common answers like Clefable, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn for easier wallbreaking, while Choice Specs Kyurem is a near-unwallable, prediction-reliant wallbreaker that can easily bust through common defensive cores. Although its defensive typing doesn't help it much, it can pivot into some walls like Mandibuzz, Slowking, and Swampert and pressure teams by PP stalling with its near-perfect coverage behind a Substitute. Choice Specs Kyurem can also pivot into these walls. However, Kyurem's average Speed tier makes it susceptible to revenge killers such as Dragapult, which uses Infiltrator to hit it even behind a Substitute, and Tapu Koko, which has STAB super effective Dazzling Gleam. Kyurem also faces competition as a special wallbreaker from Tornadus-T, with its higher Speed tier, access to Nasty Plot, and more flexible coverage, and Tapu Lele, which can break through special walls like Blissey and Galarian Slowking more easily.</p> ",

Specially defensive Clefable is also a common option to deal with Substitute sets, although it has trouble switching into Choice Specs Kyurem reliably. Kyurem can break through them more easily, however, after slight chip damage from attacks or Knock Off alongside entry hazard support.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Specially defensive Steel-types, particularly Scizor, Aegislash, and Jirachi, are hard to break through because they resist Kyurem's STAB moves and can force it to switch.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster Pokemon like Dragapult, Tapu Koko, and Kartana can threaten Kyurem with strong super effective moves, forcing it out.

The aim of this set is to stall out common checks' moves, such as Clefable's Moonblast, Blissey's Seismic Toss, and Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball or Body Press, to then outlast or overwhelm them. Substitute also blocks status from walls like Blissey, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn, and it can make Kyurem harder to revenge kill and pivot around for offensive teams once it forces a switch. Freeze-Dry hits Water-types like Slowbro, Slowking, Tapu Fini, and Swampert that would otherwise be able to sit in on Kyurem. Earth Power is the most common secondary attack to hit Steel-types like Heatran and Magnezone. While Heavy-Duty Boots is often Kyurem's best item choice to avoid entry hazard damage, from Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes primarily, other items can work alongside solid hazard control. Metronome stacks extra damage against specially defensive walls like Blissey, Clefable, and Toxapex to pressure them further alongside the PP stall, while Leftovers gives added longevity and extra synergy with Substitute—it also negates sandstorm damage against a common Kyurem check, Tyranitar. 56 HP EVs allow for 101 HP Substitutes, which are necessary to take and PP stall Blissey's Seismic Toss.</p> <p>As a defensive set, Substitute Kyurem usually resides on balance or semistall teams alongside support to give it as many PP-stalling opportunities as possible. It appreciates Spikes or Toxic Spikes, usually from Ferrothorn or Toxapex, to chip down its grounded checks like opposing Ferrothorn and Tyranitar. Knock Off Tornadus-T can lure in and cripple Blissey, Tyranitar, and any Steel-types, removing Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots to augment Kyurem's pressure and stalling capabilities. Heatran is a great partner to check this set's common Steel-type checks, like Scizor and Ferrothorn, and trap other answers like Galarian Slowking and Blissey. Because it must continue stalling for long periods of time, Kyurem hates status conditions like Toxic and paralysis. Clerics such as Clefable and Blissey make good defensive partners for this reason.</p> "

Freeze-Dry allows it to OHKO or 2HKO Water-types such as Pelipper and Toxapex. Draco Meteor is a general nuke that can be used against many Pokemon like Bewear, Torkoal, and Rotom-H. Ice Beam allows it to take care of Hippowdon, Galarian Weezing, and Roserade, while Earth Power grants Kyurem a way to do major damage to Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks such as Excadrill, Bisharp, and Aegislash. Kyurem can be used to help clean up mid- to late-game when its checks are worn down and in range of being KOed like Incineroar, Ferrothorn, and Indeedee-M, but it can also be used early-game and help weaken threats and make them easier for one of its teammates to take care of. Kyurem should try to come in on passive attacks from Toxapex and Hippowdon or on a predicted switch. A Timid nature with maximum Speed EVs allows it to outpace Pokemon such as Lucario and Speed tie with Indeedee-M and Drapion.</p> <p>Avalugg is a vital teammate to have, as it can use Rapid Spin to keep Stealth Rock off the field, which would otherwise majorly wear down Kyurem. It can also come in on physical attacks Kyurem cannot take well from Mimikyu and pressure Steel-types that Kyurem has trouble with such as Excadrill with Body Press. Alolan Ninetales is great for its ability to help Kyurem take less damage from attacks with Aurora Veil and to threaten Dark- and Fighting-types such as Hydreigon, Grimmsnarl, Keldeo, and Kommo-o with its Fairy typing. Galarian Darmanitan provides a great Choice Scarf user that it is also able to take care of all Steel-types, especially ones that Ice-type teams struggle with like Ferrothorn and Choice Scarf Excadrill, and bring Kyurem in safely with U-turn. Similarly, Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan is helpful to take care of Pokemon that Kyurem has trouble with such as Ferrothorn and Bronzong and pivot Kyurem in with its fast U-turn. Mamoswine or Piloswine is important to set up Stealth Rock to help Kyurem wallbreak further and sweep mid- to late-game. Both can also use their Ground typing to help with troubling Fire-and Poison-types like Chandelure, Drapion, Skuntank, and Toxtricity. Piloswine can especially be useful for being able to come in on Fire-type attacks from Hydreigon and Dragapult and take care of these. Choice Scarf Weavile is another great option to take care of Choice Scarf Jirachi and Gengar in the Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups. It can also use Knock Off to remove items like Galarian Corsola's Eviolite, Choice Scarf users from Duraludon and Leftovers from bulky Pokemon like Snorlax.

Freeze-Dry has high PP and super effectively hit Water-types like Slowbro, Slowking, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini that'd resist its other Ice-type STAB options, and Earth Power covers the Steel- and Fire-types that resist Freeze-Dry like Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Victini. 56 HP EVs give Kyurem 101 HP Substitutes so that Seismic Toss from Blissey and Chansey can't break it in one hit.</p> <p>Fast pivots with U-turn like Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Jirachi, and Greninja make excellent teammates to Kyurem by baiting in bulky passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Tangrowth, and Chansey and giving Kyurem a free switch to set up Substitute.

As a result, Kyurem greatly appreciates having teammates like Magnezone and Heatran that can deal with the Steel- and Fairy-types that can threaten it. Magnezone is notable due to its ability to completely trap and remove Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn with Magnet Pull. Because of Kyurem's lack of immediate power, it's also very much setup fodder for Pokemon like Calm Mind Mega Latias, Clefable, and Reuniclus, so Pokemon that can stop these setup sweepers make for good teammates.

As a stallbreaker, Keldeo punishes walls like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and defensive Seismitoad by stopping their dangerous passive moves like Toxic, Haze, Recover, and entry hazards with Taunt. With Calm Mind, it can set up to beat these walls while also letting Keldeo KO Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Corviknight. These boosts with Calm Mind also allow it to break Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Mew, and Aegislash with Hydro Pump. Scald can be used as an alternative to Hydro Pump due to its more reliable accuracy and chance to burn opposing Pokemon; however, the caveat to using this move is that it is significantly weaker than Hydro Pump without Calm Mind boosts. Keldeo's STAB move in Focus Blast allows it to break Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-types like Ferrothorn, Bisharp, Hydreigon, Indeedee, and Snorlax that Water teams would otherwise have a tough time getting through. Keldeo runs maximum EVs in both Speed and Special Attack so that it can maximize its offensive presence and outspeed key Pokemon like Hydreigon and Indeedee. This offensive presence is supported by Leftovers, which allows Keldeo to become more threatening when it sets up and also recovers health.</p> <p>Keldeo forms a very strong offensive core with Pokemon like Primarina and Crawdaunt. Primarina appreciates Keldeo's ability to stallbreak and allows it to clean late-game with its Calm Mind set. Crawdaunt can also switch into Psychic-type attacks from the likes of Reuniclus and use its powerful Knock Off and Liquidation to break teams down. While Keldeo's ability to be an oppressive offensive threat is incredibly valuable, it still needs support from a lot of other Pokemon to achieve this goal. Defensive Pokemon in Seismitoad and Toxapex provide the team with an Electric immunity and a Grass neutrality, respectively. Seismitoad also provides Stealth Rock support while Toxapex offers support through Toxic, Toxic Spikes, spreading Scald burns, and wearing down opposing Pokemon to make it easier for Keldeo to break through them. Rotom-W is also a great partner, as it is able to switch into Flying-type attacks from the likes of Corviknight and Togekiss and can answer back with its own STAB Electric-type moves. It also provides Defog support to prevent Keldeo from being worn down by Sticky Web, Toxic Spikes, and other entry hazards. Pelipper can assist Keldeo by getting rid of key Grass-type Pokemon like Vileplume and Virizion with its STAB Hurricane, as well as support Keldeo with Drizzle, bolstering the power of Keldeo's Hydro Pump. Cloyster is another teammate that helps deal with Grass-types as well as Dragon- and Flying-types for Keldeo and appreciates its ability to keep Stealth Rock and other hazards off the field with Taunt. Lastly, Araquanid is a great support Pokemon, as it can not only threaten Psychic-types like Gardevoir, but also use Sticky Web to allow Keldeo to threaten more Pokemon, namely Heliolisk and Choice Scarf Indeedee.</p> "

With STAB Hydro Pump, Keldeo is able to burst through walls like Mandibuzz and Corviknight thanks to its raw power. This along with its STAB Aura Sphere eviscerating most Normal- and Steel-types like Indeedee, Bewear, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp makes it extremely hard to switch into. Secret Sword is a good alternative to Aura Sphere if the little extra power and the ability to hit the Defense stat as opposed to the Special Defense stat is preferred, which is key in dealing with Pokemon like Snorlax. Keldeo also uses Icy Wind to hit some would-be threats on the switch such as Noivern, Vileplume, and Dragapult, and Scald to have a more reliable Water-type STAB move when needed. In order for it to maximize its offensive presence, Keldeo runs full EV investment in both Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature. This boost in Speed allows it to outspeed key Pokemon like Mimikyu, Modest Alolan Raichu, and non-Choice Scarf Jirachi naturally.</p> <p>Keldeo's offensive presence and ability to break open holes in the opposing team make it great as a partner for setup sweepers like Gyarados and Cloyster. Keldeo also helps get rid of prominent Grass-types like Appletun and Vileplume with Icy Wind. Crawdaunt and Primarina are offensive partners that can help out Keldeo by getting rid of annoying Psychic- and Dragon-types, respectively, while switching into their respective types. Crawdaunt in particular, while able to greatly improve the Steel matchup alongside Keldeo, also helps check Jellicent which completely walls Keldeo. Rotom-W is also a very invaluable teammate for Keldeo, as it can take Flying-type attacks from the likes of Corviknight and Togekiss and threaten them out with its own Electric-type STAB move and pivot using Volt Switch. It can also use a Substitute + Nasty Plot set that can break Pokemon like Jellicent and Toxapex, as well as provide support through Defog, which prevents Keldeo from getting worn down from hazards. Seismitoad allows Keldeo to have Stealth Rock support as well as providing it a switch-in to Electric-type attacks. Toxapex also helps take Grass-type attacks for Keldeo as a defensive pivot while using Toxic or Toxic Spikes to help wear down the opposing team. Pelipper sets rain, which gives Keldeo ludicrous amounts of power with its Hydro Pump and allows partners like Dracovish to help clean teams that were weakened by Keldeo's wallbreaking power. Araquanid is also very helpful in assisting Keldeo with Sticky Web to slow down faster threats like Heliolisk and Choice Scarf Indeedee.</p> "

Flame Body is the preferred ability because Talonflame is good at fishing for burns by switching into moves like Passimian's U-turn and Copperajah's Heavy Slam. The EV spread with a Jolly nature maximizes Talonflame's bulk while being able to outspeed Inteleon and Salazzle.</p> <p>Teammates like Copperajah and Guzzlord, which Fighting-types feast on, can retreat into Talonflame and serve as Flame Body lures. Water-types that run amuck like Vaporeon, Blastoise, and Mantine all switch into Talonflame with little-to-no issue, save for Toxic. Therefore, teammates like Vileplume, Dragalge, and Rotom-C are appreciated to take pressure off of Talonflame. These Pokemon also check Electric-types like Heliolisk and Choice Scarf Rotom-C. Similarly, Rock-types like Aerodactyl and Diancie either outspeed Talonflame or don't mind coming in on any of its moves. Mudsdale can eat up any hit they throw at them and can also switch in on Choice Scarf users like Tyrantrum and Passimian, since Head Smash and Rock Slide, respectively, take out Talonflame with ease.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Talonflame's niche comes from its Fire resistance, Steel resistance, access to Will-O-Wisp, and ability in Flame Body. Talonflame faces strict competition from Crobat and Noivern as fast Flying-type Pokemon, with Crobat having more useful defensive utility and Noivern being better offensively. However, Talonflame is able to check certain Steel-types such as Metagross, Durant, and Steelix well unlike its Flying-type competition. Talonflame is also able to stave off Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Heracross. Will-O-Wisp allows Talonflame to cripple common Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Diancie and Stakataka, Steel-types like Cobalion and Steelix, and setup sweepers like Swords Dance Doublade and Swords Dance Mimikyu. U-turn is helpful to keep momentum and bring in frailer wallbreakers and other teammates. Flare Blitz and Toxic can be run over Brave Bird and Will-O-Wisp to make Talonflame more immediately threatening to Steel-types and Electric-types; Toxic also makes it harder for Water-types to handle it. However, this leaves it without a move to hit Chandelure and is less threatening to Stakataka. Talonflame has the option to run a Swords Dance set with maximum Attack investment as well as Flare Blitz and Swords Dance over U-turn and Will-O-Wisp, which threatens common Flying-resistant Pokemon like Raikou and Steelix. Swords Dance Talonflame still struggles to break past most bulky Water- and Rock-types and loses immense utility by not having U-turn or Will-O-Wisp, however. 240 Speed EVs let Talonflame outspeed Ribombee. While an offensive EV spread is preferred, Talonflame can alternatively run a physically defensive EV spread of 16 HP / 252 Def / 240 Spe to more reliably check Mienshao, Durant, and Metagross, but it gives up the ability to guarantee a 2HKO on Chandelure.</p> <p>Talonflame cannot do much to the many Rock- and Water-type Pokemon like Diancie, Milotic, and Gastrodon in the tier, so Celebi, Milotic, and Vileplume make good teammates that are able to switch in and threaten these Pokemon. Vileplume and Celebi are especially notable, as they also handle Electric-types that threaten Talonflame like Raikou and Xurkitree. Talonflame's ability to lure in Rock- and Water-types such as Stakataka, Diancie, and Milotic can give free switches to teammates like Golurk, Decidueye, and Virizion thanks to U-turn. Talonflame appreciates cleric support from Diancie, Vileplume, and Sylveon to reliably handle Toxic users such as Metagross and defensive Stakataka. Talonflame isn't a reliable Fighting-type check on its own, so Vileplume and Sylveon make good teammates for it that are able to reliably handle Mienshao. Knock Off can ruin Talonflame by removing its Heavy-Duty Boots, making it vulnerable to Stealth Rock; Knock Off absorbers like Cobalion, Vileplume, and Gastrodon can take Knock Off for Talonflame. Frailer wallbreakers like Life Orb Mienshao and Choice Band Golurk appreciate Talonflame's ability to easily bring them in with U-turn.</p> "

Unfortunately, it faces heavy competition from other wallbreakers and Fighting-types, such as Obstagoon, Heracross, and Cobalion, which are either faster, harder to play around thanks to being less prediction reliant, or able to provide more defensive utility. Iron Head allows Pangoro to OHKO Diancie as well as 2HKO defensive Sylveon, bulky Togekiss, and Galarian Weezing. Drain Punch is a more reliable secondary Fighting-type move. However, Bullet Punch gives Pangoro a way to revenge kill weakened faster threats. Scrappy makes Pangoro less prediction reliant, as it prevents Ghost-types from switching into its Fighting-type moves and Incineroar's Intimidate from lowering its Attack stat. Life Orb can be used instead of Choice Band to make Pangoro less prediction reliant. However, it loses some breaking power and misses safe OHKOs on bulky Metagross and Klefki as well as a 2HKO on Galarian Weezing. Additionally, once the opponent is able to switch thanks to correct prediction or a free switch, Pangoro is forced to switch out anyway.</p> <p>VoltTurn support is crucial, since Pangoro is unable to switch directly onto the battlefield due to its mediocre bulk. Electric-types such as Raikou, Toxtricity, and Xurkitree support Pangoro with Volt Switch and check Flying-types like Togekiss and Crobat. Flying-types like Crobat, Noivern, and Talonflame, on the other hand, get Pangoro in safely against Steel- and Rock-types like Steelix, Registeel, and Stakataka through U-turn and check Fighting-types like Mienshao and Heracross. Entry hazard support is helpful because Pangoro can remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and often forces switches due to its raw power. Stakataka and Diancie can both set Stealth Rock and beat the most common Defog users like Noivern and Togekiss. Steel-types, such as Metagross, Steelix, and Klefki, also set hazards and check Fairy- and Flying-types. Late-game cleaners like Xurkitree, Stakataka, and Calm Mind Raikou benefit from Pangoro breaking through sturdy walls. Defensive Pokemon, such as Seismitoad, Milotic, and Doublade, can switch into revenge killers that would check Pangoro.</p> "

STAB Shadow Ball is great, since only two types resist or are immune to it, making it very difficult to switch into, and it's able to 2HKO bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex. Flash Cannon is Aegislash's secondary STAB attack and is primarily used against Pokemon weak to Steel or against Pokemon that resist or are immune to Shadow Ball such as Indeedee and Grimmsnarl. Steel Beam is Aegislash's most powerful attack at the cost of cutting half of its HP, which is why it should only be used when Aegislash needs to OHKO a threat such as omni-boosted Kommo-o or Mandibuzz. Aegislash has high Attack despite having a Modest nature, which allows it to effectively run Shadow Sneak so it can revenge kill weakened threats such as Keldeo, Chandelure, and Alolan Raichu. Stance Change is part of the reason why Aegislash is such a great wallbreaker, because it can take a hit before changing to Blade forme and use a powerful attack. Maximum investment in HP allows Aegislash to take attacks such as Choice Specs Shadow Ball from Dragapult in Shield forme due to its amazing bulk. Alternatively, maximum Speed can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Crawdaunt and Corviknight. Aegislash should be used to wallbreak early- to mid-game and clear the way for its teammates to win.</p> <p>Corviknight is a great partner, as it covers Aegislash's Ground weakness and makes a great pivot to attacks that threaten Aegislash such as Indeedee's Mystical Fire and Gengar's Shadow Ball. Ferrothorn gets up entry hazards to weaken the opposing team and put them in range of Aegislash's attacks. It also works well with Aegislash in dealing with Choice Specs Keldeo, as Ferrothorn resists Water-type attacks and can scout with Protect, while Aegislash is immune to Fighting-type attacks. Ferrothorn can also support Aegislash with its Leech Seed and let it recover back some HP. Melmetal forms a very powerful offensive core with Choice Specs Aegislash, being able to break through the majority of the metagame. Choice Scarf Excadrill is a good revenge killer capable of dealing with threats such as Chandelure and Rotom-H. Bisharp works well with Aegislash in overwhelming Psychic- and Ghost-type teams and is also valuable in other matchups thanks to its ability to revenge kill threats such as Alolan Raichu, Dragapult, Venusaur in sun, and Seismitoad in rain with Sucker Punch. Choice Scarf Duraludon can revenge kill Dragon-types that Aegislash has trouble with such as Hydreigon and Dragapult. Jirachi can check Keldeo with Psychic, provide Healing Wish support for Aegislash, and run Trick Room to allow Aegislash to take advantage of its mediocre Speed.

King's Shield is used to punish foes if they try to use a contact move on Aegislash, which helps secure the matchup against physical threats like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Dracovish, and physical Arcanine. Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon are powerful STAB moves that are used to hit opposing Psychic-, Fairy-, and Ice-types, such as Gardevoir, Sylveon, and Galarian Darmanitan, alongside Choice-locked Dragapult. Shadow Sneak allows Aegislash to finish off faster Pokemon that have been whittled down by Aegislash's other moves.

Porygon-Z sometimes only runs Normal-type coverage, in which case Aegislash autowins, but Aegislash will fall to a combo of Trick into Shadow Ball or Dark Pulse. King's Shield is unfortunately only marginally effective at beating threatening contact Pokemon. Both Urshifu-S and Urshifu-R have the ability Unseen Fist, which ignores King's Shield, and physical Fire-types like Darmanitan, Incineroar, Centiskorch, and Alolan Marowak can avoid bypass King's Shield with their moves or abilities. King's Shield will also prove ineffective against monstrous physical powerhouses, like Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Dracovish, and Dracozolt, though the former can be beaten if Aegislash uses King's Shield twice. Despite being super effective against Ghost Pokemon, Aegislash will lose against all Ghost-type Pokemon except Choice item Dragapult. If Aegislash is undersped by a Pokemon, it will be helpless defensively, and will often lose even against Pokemon it can hit super effectively, like Choice Band Avalugg and Crustle, Snorlax, Steelix, and Rhyperior. Among Rock- and Ice-types, only Shell Smash Crustle, Terrakion, Eiscue, Alolan Ninetales, and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan are relevant targets - the others, like Tyranitar and Kyurem, can win with their specific attributes. Aegislash has absolutely no stallbreaking ability, and thus all stall Pokemon should be avoided, outside of Slowbro, which can be KOed. Chilan Berry Primarina or Azumarill can be used to beat Fire- and Ground-type threats, alongside relevant Rock- and Ice-type Pokemon, and troublesome Dragons like Substitute + Disable Dragapult and non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room and Nasty Plot work together to allow Spritzee to become a powerful sweeper, as Trick Room reverses Spritzee's poor Speed and lets it be a countermeasure to Sticky Web. Moonblast does a good amount of damage to neutral foes, even when unboosted. Psychic is Spritzee's coverage move for Poison-types such as Mareanie, Foongus, and Koffing that check it, and it also neutrally hits Ponyta.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP, Defense, and Special Defense EV investment is to ensure that Spritzee is bulky enough to take an attack or two so it can use Nasty Plot. Offensively, the maximum Special Attack investment and Modest nature make Spritzee hit as hard as possible. Berry Juice is used to heal Spritzee up if it gets hit a couple times, though Eviolite can be used so it can take more hits. Aroma Veil is the ability of choice to ensure Taunt and Encore users don't prevent Spritzee from setting up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Spritzee's goal is to set up Nasty Plot and have Trick Room active so it can sweep, so switch Spritzee in on a Pokemon that can't do much damage to it like Timburr or Mienfoo. Avoid Knock Off, as Spritzee's item is very important to its ability to set up. Also, be careful of setting up Trick Room if the foe is slower than Spritzee. In that case, simply setting up with Nasty Plot and attacking is better. If you have two or more free turns, make sure to set up Nasty Plot first, as you want Trick Room to last as long as possible. Late-game, if the opposing Pokemon are weakened, Spritzee can sweep just by setting up Trick Room without Nasty Plot. Finally, you can try bluffing a defensive set by constantly switching in and out to soak up resisted attacks from the likes of Timburr and Mienfoo, and, when late-game comes, you can start setting up and surprise your opponent.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Spritzee appreciates entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Pawniard so it can sweep more effectively. Furthermore, it appreciates Knock Off support from the likes of Mienfoo and Vullaby, which is necessary so that it can reliably KO Pokemon such as Foongus and Mareanie. Unfortunately, Spritzee cannot do much damage to Ferroseed, so teammates like Ponyta, Mienfoo, and Timburr are appreciated. Diglett is also a great option, as it can wear Ferroseed down or use Final Gambit against it. And, although Mudbray isn't the best Spritzee check, Spritzee still appreciates teammates such as Staryu and Wingull to deal with it.</p> "

Wish, one of the moves that gives defensive Spritzee its niche, provides Spritzee and its teammates recovery. Protect complements Wish, ensuring that Spritzee gets healed. Furthermore, Protect lets Spritzee scout for moves on Choice-locked Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mienfoo. Covet is a good utility move in the Knock Off-heavy LC tier. It allows Spritzee to steal the foe's item, typically Berry Juice or Eviolite, and can be useful to maintain its bulk after taking Knock Off while weakening a foe. Spritzee can use it against the likes of Ferroseed, Mareanie, and Foongus. Psychic can be used instead of Covet to deal good damage to Poison-types such as Foonguss, Mareanie, and Koffing.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Eviolite, Bold nature, HP EVs, and Defense EVs allow Spritzee to switch into as many physical attackers, such as Onix, Mienfoo, Timburr, and Vullaby, as it can. The HP EVs also maximize Wish recovery for both itself and its teammates. The leftover EVs are used to increase Spritzee's other stats. Aroma Veil is the preferred ability so Spritzee can ignore Encore and Taunt, letting it employ its many utility moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Spritzee is very bulky, so it can switch into common physical attackers in the tier and isn't afraid to take a Knock Off, especially as it can regain an item by using Covet. Since Spritzee is a cleric, make sure it survives for as long as possible to ensure your entire team, especially walls like Ferroseed, stays healthy through Wish passing. To not lose momentum and get good matchups against Poison- and Steel-types that check Spritzee, switch in Spritzee strategically and then double switch to a teammate. Be careful of letting foes take advantage of Spritzee's lackluster offensive capabilities to set up or set entry hazards on it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ferroseed appreciates Spritzee because it checks common threats such as Timburr, Vullaby, and Mienfoo, and Ferroseed checks Mareanie and Foongus for it. Ferroseed also appreciates Wish as a way to counteract opposing teams chipping it down. On the flip side, Spritzee appreciates teammates such as Timburr, Mienfoo, and Ponyta, which can KO its checks such as Pawniard and Ferroseed. Galarian Ponyta, Abra, and Diglett can KO Spritzee's counters. Also, since Spritzee is constantly switching in and out to ensure the best matchups, entry hazards can wear it down; therefore, Defog users such as Vullaby and Timburr and Rapid Spin users such as Staryu are appreciated. Finally, Spritzee appreciates entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed, Onix, and Pawniard, as it can often force Pokemon such as Timburr to switch out.</p> "

Moonblast hits many metagame-prevalent Pokemon like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan. Aromatisse's remaining three moves are used to set up a combination that forces the foe to damage itself with Struggle. Trick Room allows Aromatisse to outspeed a Pokemon that would normally be faster than it like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and force it to struggle by using Encore and Disable, or just Disable if the foe is holding a Choice item. When predicting that a potential Choice item holder like Rotom-H or Togekiss will use Trick, use Encore to give Aromatisse two free turns of Moonblast, which will often secure the win.</p> <p>Against certain stall Pokemon such as Milotic and Dubwool, using Encore turn one followed by a sequence of Moonblast, Trick Room, Disable, and Encore allows you to lock the opposing Pokemon into Struggle for two turns to deal maximum damage. Against some stall Pokemon with Special Defense-boosting moves that do not resist Moonblast like Rotom-W, Snorlax, and Type: Null, Aromatisse can permanently lock them into a boosting move by using Encore turn one. After that, use Trick Room turn two and repeat each of the status moves whenever it expires until the opposing Pokemon breaks out of Encore before the last turn of Trick Room. Once you are at that turn, use Encore followed by Moonblast and Trick Room and repeat. Doing so in this order will allow you to refresh Trick Room and Encore continuously without giving the opposing Pokemon a chance to switch moves. If they instead attack, use Disable on the attacking move and then KO it with consecutive Moonblasts. Porygon-Z will involve mindgames, either predicting them to attack, in which case you use Trick Room, or Trick, in which case you Encore. Pokemon with a positive matchup against Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-type Pokemon that Aromatisse struggles with, such as Salazzle, Haxorus, Chansey, Urshifu-R, and Dragapult can be useful partners in order to assist Aromatisse.</p> "

Magic Coat allows it to force 50/50s against opposing leads that might threaten Taunt, such as Yveltal and Grimmsnarl, while also deterring Stealth Rock setters and leads like Necrozma-DM and Landorus-T. Misty Explosion is extremely useful, enabling Slurpuff to block Defog or Rapid Spin attempts from slower Pokemon like Yveltal and Excadrill after its Focus Sash has been activated, as well as potentially bringing a teammate in safely. Yawn prevents Pokemon like Necrozma-DM and Calyrex-S from setting up freely on Slurpuff, and it can give teammates free setup turns if a foe KOes Slurpuff while drowsy. Endeavor can also be used to deter setup attempts and generally cripple opposing leads, working together with Focus Sash and Unburden to allow Slurpuff to threaten Pokemon like Necrozma-DM and Xerneas, which could otherwise cleanly 2HKO it. Focus Sash is vital to set Sticky Web against faster Pokemon while also synergizing nicely with Unburden to let Slurpuff outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, allowing for a Yawn or Endeavor before it's KOed. The given EVs and IVs with a Naive nature minimize Slurpuff's bulk to help it activate Focus Sash, notably ensuring that Life Orb Yveltal's Oblivion Wing does so.</p> <p>Slurpuff fits only on hyper offense teams where its Sticky Web support can enable threatening wallbreakers and sweepers. Teammates that work especially well alongside Slurpuff include Choice Specs Kyogre and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, which greatly appreciate outspeeding Eternatus and outspeeding Calyrex-S after a boost, respectively. Calyrex-S can also be a solid teammate thanks to its ability to block Rapid Spin from Excadrill. Since Slurpuff can't set Stealth Rock outside of using Magic Coat, a secondary lead like Landorus-T often works great alongside it, with Landorus-T additionally being able to block entry hazard removal through Explosion, gaining considerable momentum. Teammates that can use Taunt to block opposing Defog attempts later in the game are also tremendously useful, with Yveltal being the best example. Similarly, it's important to have teammates that can reliably pressure Defoggers, such as Zekrom, Xerneas, and Zacian-C, all of which can threaten Yveltal and Ho-Oh. Slurpuff should almost always be used as the lead, unless the opponent has a counter like Excadrill or a multi-hit attacker like Pheromosa.</p> "

Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Zarude, Mienshao, and Cobalion form a good VoltTurn core with Dragalge and also bait Fairy- and Fire-types such as Togekiss, Galarian Weezing, Incineroar, and Chandelure onto the battlefield, of which Dragalge takes advantage. Bulky Steel-types like Steelix and Metagross are good teammates to take on Dragon-, Psychic-, and Ice-types like Noivern, Indeedee, and Cloyster. Zarude, Golisopod, and Celebi check troublesome Ground-types like Seismitoad and Rhyperior. Golisopod and Celebi also form a good hazard stacking core with Dragalge. Pokemon such as Substitute + Calm Mind Raikou, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Suicune benefit from Dragalge's Toxic Spikes wearing down their typical checks and counters. An entry hazard remover like Noivern, Togekiss, or Starmie is helpful if Dragalge is not running Heavy-Duty Boots, since entry hazards limit its pivoting. Sylveon and Umbreon provide Wish support, increasing Dragalge's longevity.</p> "

Its Poison typing also allows Dragalge to take Fairy-type attacks from foes like Gardevoir and Hatterene and remove the opposing Toxic Spikes from foes like Toxapex. Sludge Wave is Dragalge's way of dealing damage while having a way to nail the aforementioned Fairy-types. Dragalge's mediocre Speed allows it to put Flip Turn to excellent use, bringing in teammates such as Kyurem and Hydreigon safely against Pokemon it underspeeds, such as Toxapex, that like to spread status. Protect is used for scouting Choice-locked Pokemon such as Diggersby, Indeedee-M, Jirachi, and Gardevoir, providing an extra turn of Black Sludge recovery as well as accumulating Toxic Spikes damage. Adaptability bolsters the power of Sludge Wave greatly and allows Dragalge to beat Hatterene after one Calm Mind. 20 Special Attack EVs ensure that Dragalge always OHKOes Gardevoir after one turn of poison damage or after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of EVs are dumped to HP and Special Defense to benefit best from Dragalge's natural bulk. 24 Speed IVs along with a Sassy nature allow Dragalge to underspeed Toxapex, thus acting as a sponge to status inflicting moves such as Scald and Toxic.</p> <p>Substitute users such as Kyurem and Hydreigon appreciate Toxic Spikes, greatly as it helps them to break types like Normal, Fairy, Psychic, and Ground more consistently throughout the game. Furthermore, Dragalge can act as a slow pivot for the two with Flip Turn. In return, Kyurem can take advantage of Water-types that are not afraid of facing Dragalge such as Seismitoad and Toxapex with Freeze Dry, while Hydreigon can switch into Psychic-type attacks from Choice-locked foes such as Indeedee-M and beats Steel-types such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Dragapult is another Substitute user that is a fantastic partner for Dragalge, as it can lend itself to a plethora of roles; thanks to Hex, it can punish most Psychic-types besides Jirachi and Indeedee-M with the help of Toxic Spikes, its U-turn allows it to be one of fastest pivots in the game, and with a Choice Scarf set, it can be an excellent revenge killer against foes like Kingdra under Swift Swim with its almost unresisted STAB combination. Furthermore, its Ghost typing allows Dragapult to act as a spinblocker against foes like Excadrill and Torkoal. Duraludon is another good partner for Dragalge, as the duo forms a good defensive backbone thanks to Duralodon's good physical bulk. Thanks to its Steel typing, Duraludon can switch into Choice Scarf Jirachi's Iron Head and threaten it with Thunder Wave and handle other Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Mimikyu, and Klefki. Noivern can help Dragalge in many ways between its sets; a standard stallbreaker set prevents common Defog users such as opposing Noivern and Braviary from removing Toxic Spikes with Taunt, and its access to U-turn lets the duo perform as a pivot core with Dragalge's access to Flip Turn. Furthermore, its Flying typing lets Noivern switch into Ground-type attacks from foes like Choice Scarf Excadrill and Seismitoad.</p> "

Volt Switch is particularly easy for Heliolisk to use effectively as it is able to threaten the likes of Seismitoad and Roserade, which typically attempt to sponge or outright block Volt Switch. Hyper Voice is a great secondary STAB move that hits Grass-types, such as Celebi and Roserade, for solid damage, and prevents Electric-types from easily switching in. Grass Knot OHKOes Seismitoad after Stealth Rock and does respectable damage to Steelix. Surf can be used instead if hitting Alolan Marowak and Steelix is necessary for your team, but it will do less to Golurk while completely missing out on Seismitoad and Gastrodon. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Heliolisk to come in on bulky Water-types while staying healthy to threaten slower offensive Pokemon, such as Cobalion and Volcanion, when necessary. Choice Specs and Choice Scarf are options to either give Heliolisk a power boost or much higher Speed, but this can inhibit its ability to switch in freely against Water-types. Solar Power should be chosen if Heliolisk is being used on full sun teams for its immense power boost, but such teams are niche and uncommon.</p> <p>Heliolisk should be used with Pokemon that have major problems dealing with bulky Water-types. Stealth Rock setters like Steelix, Stakataka, Cobalion, and Diancie are some examples that work well at helping Heliolisk exert more pressure with Volt Switch while generally checking faster Pokemon, such as Noivern, Choice Scarf Darmanitan, and Aerodactyl. A Darmanitan of your own can form a powerful VoltTurn core with Heliolisk, which threatens Water-types for it. Choice Band Metagross is a slower wallbreaker that loves not having to worry much about bulky Water-types, and it can severely pressure the likes of Dragalge, Porygon2, and Registeel with its powerful attacks should Heliolisk use Volt Switch as these Pokemon switch in. Diancie and Registeel are special walls that can sponge Heliolisk's attacks reliably and keep Heliolisk from getting rid of the likes of Seismitoad and Gastrodon. Volcanion and Ground-types, such as Golurk, can pummel these special walls with their powerful STAB attacks. Volcanion can utilize Toxic to cripple Porygon2 as well, while Golurk simply uses these special walls as an oppourtunity to severely dent the opposition to help Heliolisk finish off a match with its good natural Speed. Incineroar can check Assault Vest Reuniclus and Darmanitan, appreciates Heliolisk ability to pressure bulky Water-types, and can act as a slow pivot to get Heliolisk in safely. Spikes support from Klefki, Roserade, and Golisopod can really help Heliolisk apply Volt Switch pressure to special walls and sponges like Registeel, Umbreon, Dragalge, and Porygon2.</p> "

Its above average Speed lets it outspeed common Pokemon like Indeedee and pivot out on them with Volt Switch to a suitable teammate if it cannot deal with them, allowing it to maintain momentum for the team. Grass Knot lets it pressure Ground-type teams and in combination with its STAB Electric-type move, it becomes a headache for Water-type teams to deal with, making such matchups relatively easier for Normal-type teams to handle. Focus Blast lets it beat Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Excadrill that normally can switch into Heliolisk. Its ability Dry Skin is quite handy too, as it lets it pivot on defensive Pokemon like Toxapex. Maximum Speed investment makes Heliolisk as fast as possible, and maximum Special Attack investment with a Choice Specs bolsters its damage output. Expert Belt can be used to bluff a Choice item and boost super effective damage, as it synergizes well with its coverage.</p> <p>Snorlax and Braviary are good teammates for Heliolisk, as they both appreciate it dealing with troublesome Steel-type Pokemon such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill. In return, Thick Fat Snorlax checks Fire-type Pokemon for Heliolisk, and Choice Scarf Braviary can beat Fighting-type Pokemon like Gallade for it. Choice Scarf Braviary and Heliolisk form a threatening VoltTurn core, too. Choice Band Diggersby appreciates Volt Switch support from Heliolisk, giving it more chances to wallbreak and deal with Pokemon like Ferrothorn with Fire Punch, relieving the pressure from Heliolisk. Indeedee can wallbreak for Heliolisk and provide it with Psychic Terrain, allowing Heliolisk to revenge kill Pokemon like Lucario for the team.

Glare allows it to paralyze faster threats such as Kingdra under rain and Choice Scarf Cobalion when Heliolisk is behind a Substitute. Glare mainly allows it to spread status well due to only Electric-type Pokemon being immune to it. Thunderbolt permits it to threaten Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Toxapex, Mantine, and Corviknight. Grass Knot grants Heliolisk the ability to target Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Gastrodon, Mamoswine, and Rhyperior. The combination of Thunderbolt and Grass Knot allows Heliolisk to threaten every Water-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Substitute allows Heliolisk to take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Mantine, Toxapex, and specially defensive Aegislash. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Heliolisk to ignore entry hazards that will hinder it such as Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes. However, Leftovers can be used to passively regain health, giving it more opportunities to set up a Substitute. Dry Skin grants Heliolisk an immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to switch into attacks such as Dracovish's Fishious Rend and Azumarill's Aqua Jet, which can otherwise devastate Normal teams. Maximum EVs in Special Attack and Speed ensure it is as powerful as possible and faster than Pokemon such as Keldeo. Heliolisk should try to set up a Substitute against Water teams, especially on passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mantine or Pokemon Choice-locked into a Water-type attack such as Choice Scarf Rotom-W's Hydro Pump. Substitute then allows it to severely threaten Water teams. Outside of the Water and Flying matchups, Heliolisk's main job is to be spreading paralysis with Glare, which can be done more easily if it's behind a Substitute.</p> <p>Heliolisk supports its offensive teammates with Glare, allowing them to outspeed threats such as Hydreigon. Blissey is a fantastic partner, as it can switch into a plethora of attacks for it such as Rotom-H's Overheat and Indeedee's Expanding Force. In addition, Blissey can set Stealth Rock for Heliolisk, allowing it to break past Pokemon such as Keldeo and Togekiss more easily. Finally, it can also pivot with Teleport to bring in Heliolisk safely. Ditto is a great way to check faster Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Cinderace. Braviary is an important teammate when Heliolisk is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can clear hazards off the field, which is crucial for Heliolisk due to its weakness to Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web. This is especially important against Water teams. Diggersby, Bewear, and Obstagoon can break through special walls for Heliolisk such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Tyranitar. Diggersby can also take on Fire- and Poison-type Pokemon such as Torkoal, Incineroar, and Salazzle. Obstagoon can help Heliolisk in the Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups by taking on Pokemon such as Mew and Alolan Marowak. Bewear is the best check to threats such as Urshifu-S, as Fluffy alongside a Chople Berry can make that matchup manageable. In return, Heliolisk can slow down faster Pokemon such as Hydreigon with Glare for them.</p> "

Tyrantrum's main drawback offensively lies in its reliance on Head Smash, making Tyrantrum predictable for teams to switch into with a defensive Steel- or Ground-type. On top of that, Head Smash has low accuracy, making Tyrantrum unreliable at throwing out huge damage.

On dual screens teams, Life Orb is preferred, giving it an immediate power boost that can pick up the KO versus certain Pokemon such as Sylveon, Vaporeon, and Diancie when at +1 Attack. Weakness Policy is another viable option for dual screens teams, taking advantage of the weakened super effective attacks sent its way and boosting up to astronomical heights. Hone Claws is a solid secondary option over Dragon Dance to boost accuracy for Head Smash and Scale Shot, but Dragon Dance is usually preferred because of its higher sweeping potential. A Jolly nature is prefered specifically for speeding past Talonflame, Inteleon, and Aerodactyl at +1 Speed.</p> <p>Getting rid of or chipping Ground-types is necessary to letting Tyrantrum sweep. Grass-type partners such as Rotom-C, itemless Vileplume, and Decidueye do a great job switching into and punishing Ground types such as Mudsdale, Golurk, and Flygon. Spikes support from Garbodor or Qwilfish also helps chip down Pokemon such as Diancie, Sylveon, and Vaporeon into Head Smash range. Dragon Dance Tyrantrum also fits wonderfully with dual screens support, taking advantage of the added cushioning screens provide from Pokemon like Xatu, Espeon, and Inteleon to quickly boost up and win.

Offensive pivots like Zarude and Xurkitree can also be helpful, since they can bring in Sylveon on some favorable matchups and chip Pokemon enough so that Sylveon can get KOs. Entry hazard removers like Noivern and Crobat can be helpful to allow Sylveon to switch freely without getting chipped. Finally, Pokemon that can pressure and deal with Steel-types such as Steelix and Klefki, like Volcanion and Golurk, can be good so that Sylveon can spam Hyper Voice instead of being forced into making predictions.</p> "

When it is in range of being KOed, Sylveon should use Endure to activate Custap Berry next turn.

However, Hawlucha is frail, even with the Defense boost provided by its Terrain Seed, so it can only set up on Pokemon that it can force out or take a hit from, like Kartana. It also has problems with breaking through some common walls like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Skarmory, even after a Swords Dance boost, and it can get heavily crippled by status or chip damage. Lastly, Hawlucha heavily relies on its teammates and their survival to accomplish its role, meaning it will be dead weight until late-game.</p> ",

Toxapex can reset its boosts with Haze and burn or poison it, Slowbro can eliminate it with Future Sight and Scald, Skarmory can win one-on-one, and Zapdos can paralyze it with Static and OHKO with its STAB moves, only fearing a boosted Stone Edge.

Hawlucha's item is interchangeable depending on its teammates; on hyper offense teams, Hawlucha should run Grassy Seed, while on dual screens teams Electric Seed should be the choice. The Defense boost also allows it to set up more freely against threats like Kartana and Garchomp.

However, Tapu Koko acts as an offensive pivot that can set up screens and deal with walls like Toxapex and Slowbro, as well as bringing in Hawlucha against would-be setup fodders like Ferrothorn with U-turn. As Hawlucha only has one opportunity to clean, it appreciates having all of its checks removed or chipped into KO range; this makes Knock Off support from Kartana and Weavile very valuable, as they can remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from its checks like Toxapex and Zapdos.

They can also pressure some of Hawlucha's checks, like Slowbro and Hippowdon, with their STAB moves. Finally, Dragapult and Hawlucha can form an offensive core that can be hard to manage. Dragapult pressures key targets like Zapdos or Toxapex and forces damage on them with its powerful STAB moves; it can also offer setup opportunities with U-turn, as it gets forced out by Pokemon that Hawlucha wants to use as setup fodder, like Blissey and Tyranitar.</p> "

With White Herb, it can set up Unburden in front of any Pokemon that isn't a Ghost-type with Close Combat, and use either Acrobatics or Brave Bird to hit most of the tier very hard. Brave Bird is especially useful in matchups like Ghost, where activating White Herb is impossible due to everything being immune to Close Combat. Swords Dance is used to further boost its power in front of walls such as Ferrothorn on Steel. Taunt facilitates this by preventing walls like Toxapex or Hippowdon from healing and using Haze or phazing moves, as well as preventing entry hazards and other status moves. One should also be wary of Pokemon that are faster than Hawlucha after Unburden, such as Barraskewda in rain. Maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Hawlucha to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding most key threats outside of Unburden such as Gengar and Keldeo.</p> <p>Hawlucha can't outright sweep teams from the beginning of the match, which is why it needs teammates like Bewear and Lucario to break holes in the opposing team so it can find an opportunity to set up and clean.

These Pokemon in return appreciate Hawlucha's ability to prevent hazards from being on the field thanks to Taunt, as well as making it easier to switch into walls like Hippowdon or Ferrothorn.

Spikes, in combination with Prankster, turns Klefki into a solid entry hazard setter that can easily get them up on the first turn of a match or when it is given a free switch in. It also helps to wear down bulky Pokemon that Klefki has trouble checking, such as Rhyperior and Chansey. Thunder Wave slows down opposing Pokemon such as Keldeo and Nihilego, which gives its slower teammates more opportunities to wallbreak. It also provides Klefki with a safety net against Speed-boosting setup sweepers, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Swords Dance + Scale Shot Kommo-o. Foul Play is used to deal with powerful physical attackers, like Gyarados. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to cripple Electric-types like Rotom-W and Rotom-H, which completely wall Klefki otherwise, as well as defensive Pokemon like Assault Vest Tangrowth. Leftovers provides Klefki with recovery, which it lacks otherwise. A specially defensive EV spread allows Klefki to check Pokemon like Salamence, Nihilego, and Galarian Moltres better. 16 Speed EVs allow Klefki to outspeed extremely fast Pokemon, such as Noivern, after paralyzing them.</p> <p>Klefki is best used on offensive teams that appreciate the early-game support that its status moves provide. Klefki gives Nidoking free opportunities to wallbreak so partners like Assault Vest Reuniclus and Rotom-W are appreciated to pressure it. Stealth Rock setters like Rhyperior and Nidoking form a solid entry hazard-stacking core with Klefki while also being able to deal with Rotom-H, a Pokemon that Klefki greatly struggles with. Pokemon that can pressure the Rotom formes are immensely important for Klefki, as they are some of its biggest counters if lacking Toxic. Kommo-o and Nihilego can deal with Rotom-H, while Zarude can take care of Rotom-W. Wallbreakers like Mamoswine and Primarina appreciate Thunder Wave slowing Pokemon that would otherwise take them out, like Gyarados and Mienshao, and Spikes weakening Buzzwole and putting Assault Vest Tangrowth within 2HKO range of Primarina's Moonblast. Water-types such as Keldeo and Azumarill are especially appreciated to take out Pokemon like Krookodile, Rhyperior, and Chandelure that force out Klefki easily. In turn, these Water-types appreciate Klefki's Spikes wearing down Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Late-game cleaners, like Gyarados and Nihilego, greatly appreciate Klefki's support wearing down bulky Pokemon like Buzzwole and Jirachi that often could wall them earlier in the game. Pokemon that can take care of Spikes blockers and removers, such as Tentacruel, Hatterene, and Starmie, are greatly valued to help Klefki keep its Spikes up for longer. Kommo-o and Salamence can take care of Tentacruel, Aegislash can take care of Hatterene, and Tangrowth and Zarude can take care of Starmie.</p> "

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Super Fang can be used to weaken bulky walls like Chansey and Celesteela and make it easier for its teammates to revenge kill them while also pairing nicely with Taunt, but it's not very useful otherwise. Boomburst is another option for an attacking move, having an incredibly high Base Power without the drawbacks of Draco Meteor or Hurricane, but it is weaker and does not hit anything super effectively. Defog is a solid option, as Noivern is the fastest Defogger in the metagame and also checks common entry hazard setters like Jirachi and Kommo-o. However, Noivern struggles to fit Defog into its moveset, and if you want to run a Dragon / Flying Defogger, Salamence is a better option. Choice Specs is an option to make Noivern hit harder, but the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots makes Noivern incredibly susceptible to Stealth Rock, and thus it remains a very fringe option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Chansey brushes off all of Noivern's moves and forces it to switch out, though it does have to worry about Taunt. Rhyperior can also easily sponge Noivern's attacks except for Draco Meteor.

Flamethrower prevents Noivern from being completely walled by Steel-types, such as Aegislash, Jirachi, and Celesteela. U-turn is an option over either STAB move that allows Noivern to pivot out of would-be checks and bring in teammates more safely. Noivern does prefer to run both STAB moves, however. Roost is necessary for longevity. Infiltrator is used to bypass Substitute, which is crucial for allowing Noivern to take out Pokemon that rely on it, like Keldeo and Aegislash.</p> <p>Noivern is best used on teams that otherwise lack naturally fast Pokemon or Choice Scarf users. Electric-types like Raikou and Rotom-W are particularly good partners for Noivern, forming a fast VoltTurn core. Raikou can lure in Rhyperior and weaken it with Toxic or Scald, as well as pressure Pokemon like Primarina and Azumarill for Noivern. Rotom-W can check Mamoswine and deals with Ground-types like Krookodile and Rhyperior better than Noivern can. Grass-types, such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss, are able to come in on Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Lycanroc-D that threaten Noivern. Wallbreakers such as Lycanroc-D, Mamoswine, and Crawdaunt help make up for Noivern's lackluster offensive presence. These Pokemon can also remove special walls that Noivern otherwise struggles with, such as Chansey, Primarina, and Milotic.

Xerneas has fairly high natural bulk with a good typing, letting it also potentially wall many dangerous wallbreakers such as Zekrom, Zygarde, and Marshadow. Most of Xerneas's offensive power comes from Geomancy, though, meaning that if it is phazed or otherwise forced out, its effectiveness offensively is severely hurt, and defensive sets without it struggle to break through most walls in general.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Psyshock works as an option on Geomancy variants, letting Xerneas reliably break through Blissey and Amoonguss. This comes with Xerneas losing one of its utility options, all of which are very good, giving it a heavy opportunity cost. Focus Blast is similarly a usable coverage option, but it only hits a few targets like Ferrothorn. Defensive Xerneas can run Heavy-Duty Boots as the item, benefitting from it long term against entry hazard chip damage. The lack of recovery is quite noticeable, though, as Xerneas really likes recovering without having to use Rest. Xerneas can also opt to run a Choice Scarf set with Moonblast, Aromatherapy, Thunder Wave, and Defog, making it a fast revenge killer and support Pokemon with cleric and hazard control abilities. This set doesn't have the power backing of Geomancy or the bulk of defensive sets, though, making it harder to fit on teams overall.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM: Necrozma-DM is the premier Steel-type in the tier, and one of the best Xerneas checks. Specially defensive sets are able to beat even boosted Xerneas, and physically defensive and offensive sets can live a boosted hit and use Sunsteel Strike for massive damage if not an OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey, Assault Vest Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn are all very strong checks to Xerneas given its standard moveset lacking coverage for them, chipping it down and removing Geomancy boosts with Blissey's Confide or Amoonguss's Clear Smog. Defensive Xerneas also is completely unable to break through these Pokemon, allowing them to easily take advantage of it.</p> <p><strong>Phazing</strong>: With offensive Xerneas's reliance on Geomancy for breaking many common defensive Pokemon, phazing effectively neutralizes it as a threat.

Substitute blocks potentially deadly status and lets Xerneas take any hit that could normally KO it, Ingrain prevents phazing and gives slight passive recovery—which can be crucial in the Ho-Oh matchup, and Aromatherapy clears status for Xerneas and its team, which is always beneficial with those being very common on Pokemon such as Eternatus and Necrozma-DM. 88 Speed EVs outrun Adamant Necrozma-DM with maximum Speed investment, as well as Jolly Marshadow if Xerneas switched into Sticky Web before using Geomancy.

Moonblast is a highly spammable STAB move, capable of blasting through almost the entire defensive metagame barring Steel-types and Ho-Oh after Geomancy. Thunder is the only coverage move Xerneas needs, OHKOing Ho-Oh from full under Dynamax, removing Zacian-C after some chip damage, and heavily damaging Necrozma-DM with a chance to 2HKO even if Necrozma-DM has Dynamaxed. Additionally, Thunder allows Xerneas to fish for paralysis on Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Ho-Oh on the switch. Substitute allows Xerneas to scout, potentially waste the opponent's Dynamax if they Dynamax Necrozma-DM too early in reaction to Xerneas' Dynamax, and potentially use non-Power Whip Ferrothorn as setup fodder.

Geomancy turns Xerneas into an extremely powerful, fast, and bulky setup sweeper at the cost of its item slot. After Geomancy and the boost from Fairy Aura, Moonblast OHKOes everything that does not resist it apart from Dynamaxed Pokemon and extremely bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Lunala with its Shadow Shield intact. Under Dynamax, Moonblast turns into Max Starfall, which breaks through otherwise very solid checks such as bulky Primal Groudon, while also granting Xerneas an immunity to status effects from the likes of Ho-Oh and Lugia. Thunder grants Xerneas access to Max Lightning, allowing it to always OHKO Ho-Oh. Notably, it also sets Electric Terrain, which allows Xerneas to OHKO Ho-Oh even after Dynamax ends. Substitute is the most versatile option for Xerneas, allowing it to set up on Knock Off Ferrothorn, defensive Zygarde and support Arceus formes once boosted. Most importantly, it allows Xerneas to waste Necrozma-DM's Dynamax turns, allowing Xerneas to overwhelm it once Necrozma-DM's Dynamax ends. Hidden Power Fire is another option, turning into Max Flare under Dynamax, which allows Xerneas to overpower Necrozma-DM and OHKO Zacian-C and Ferrothorn. Max Flare also sets up harsh sunlight, which notably allows Xerneas to 2HKO most Dynamaxed Necrozma-DM variants; however, be careful, as it also lowers Thunder's accuracy. Power Herb turns Geomancy into a one-turn setup move. The given spread allows Xerneas to hit as hard and fast as possible, notably allowing it to Speed tie with opposing Xerneas and Yveltal and outspeed +1 Ultra Necrozma and Choice Scarf Marshadow after using Geomancy. Alternatively, a 108 HP / 252 SpA / 148 Spe EV spread still lets Xerneas outspeed Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza after using Geomancy, while also allowing it to live Yveltal's Max Airstream after Stealth Rock damage and slightly improving the matchup against Ditto.</p> <p>Xerneas fits best on balance, bulky offensive, and hyper offensive teams capable of providing it the support it needs to properly put itself into a winning position. On balance and bulky offense, Mega Gengar and Gothitelle are potent teammates, as they are able to trap the likes of Necrozma-DM, Chansey, Ho-Oh, and Ditto with careful prediction, facilitating Xerneas's sweep like no other partners can. Moreover, Xerneas and Mega Gengar can both force the opponent into using Dynamax prematurely for each other, which can facilitate either one of them in cleaning up. Zacian-C, Eternatus, Primal Groudon, and Primal Kyogre are also very notable for their ability to pressure Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM, allowing Xerneas to clean up late-game. Strong wallbreakers that do not rely on Dynamax, such as Zacian-C, Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza, and Mega Mewtwo Y, are good teammates, as they tend to force the opponent into using Dynamax in the endeavor to check them, which allows Xerneas to clean up without having to worry about it. Ditto can prove to be a nuisance against Xerneas. Therefore, Pokemon that can take its hits after it has transformed into Xerneas, such as Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon, as well as Pokemon that can beat it, such as Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ghost, are useful teammates. Defensive Zygarde-C is also notable for its ability to check the likes of Zacian-C lacking Play Rough, Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon, while also acting as a status absorber. On hyper offensive teams, leads such as Deoxys-S, Smeargle, and Grimmsnarl can provide entry hazard or dual screens support, helping Xerneas to pick up more KOs and easing its setup even further. All of them appreciate Xerneas's ability to pressure Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes; Xerneas also has a good matchup against Yveltal and Mega Rayquaza, two notable threats to Sticky Web teams.</p> "

However, Yveltal has to sacrifice its second or third moveslot for it. Sucker Punch can be used on a three attacks set with U-turn in order to potentially KO boosted Calyrex-S, which would otherwise overwhelm Yveltal with Max Starfall, as well as pick off or weaken foes like Marshadow and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM. However, it can be scouted with Substitute Calyrex-S and is easily exploitable once the opponent is aware of it. Toxic can cripple opposing specially defensive Yveltal and Ho-Oh better but is not recommended due to it possibly making Yveltal too passive. Knock Off is an option in the last moveslot of Life Orb Yveltal to severely damage Blissey and remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Ho-Oh, making it a much less consistent check to Yveltal. However, Dynamax Sucker Punch can already pressure Blissey, while Max Darkness overwhelms Ho-Oh. Rock Slide can be used to OHKO Ho-Oh as Max Rockfall; however, Yveltal's other coverage options are generally more useful and Rock Slide weakens Ditto matchups. A Hasty nature can be used over Mild to outspeed the likes of Kyogre, Groudon, and unboosted Xerneas, but Yveltal loses damage output and can already outspeed these threats with Max Airstream, making it fairly unnecessary.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Tyranitar is an outstanding check to Yveltal due to its sand-boosted bulk and resistance to Dark and Flying. It can force Yveltal out using Rock Tomb, Stone Edge, or Thunder Wave. However, Tyranitar can be defeated by the uncommon Focus Blast and relies on Rest in order to recover, which Yveltal's team can take advantage of. Specially defensive Eternatus can avoid being 2HKOed by Dark Pulse, proceeding to wear it down with Dynamax Cannon while PP stalling it with Pressure and Recover. Eternatus must be wary if Yveltal is Dynamaxed, though, as Max Darkness can easily weaken it or force it out. Ho-Oh is a great way to deal with offensive Yveltal, as it can tank its Dark Pulse, cripple it with Sacred Fire or Toxic, and eliminate any chip damage with Regenerator. Additionally, Protect Ho-Oh is a very useful way to stall out Yveltal's Dynamax turns. However, it must be careful of Yveltal's Max Darkness forcing it out. Specially defensive Yveltal can stall out Yveltal's Dynamax, remove its Life Orb with Knock Off, or disrupt it using Snarl, but is quite passive and can be shut down by Taunt as a result.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Xerneas can also capitalize on specially defensive Yveltal passivity with Geomancy and pose a large sweeping threat. Xerneas should be careful switching into its Knock Off, though, as it will risk losing Power Herb. Zacian-C poses a fearsome threat to Yveltal, as it resists Dark Pulse and Oblivion Wing, OHKOing it regardless of Dynamax with Behemoth Blade. However, Zacian-C can easily drop to Heat Wave Yveltal. It can't directly switch into Yveltal lacking Heat Wave, either, as it gets KOed by Max Airstream followed by Max Darkness. Choice Scarf Zacian can outspeed Yveltal even after a few Max Airstream boosts and threaten it with Play Rough; however, Zacian is easily overwhelmed by Max Airstream, while Play Rough fails to OHKO a healthy Dynamaxed Yveltal.</p> <p><strong>Ditto: Ditto is a useful revenge killer against Yveltal, as it can deal large amounts of damage and, if it has Dynamaxed, easily 2HKO Yveltal by using Max Airstream. However, a healthy Dynamaxed Yveltal can easily beat Ditto by withstanding Oblivion Wing or Max Airstream and retaliating with its more powerful Max Airstream.</p> <p><strong>Physically Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically offensive Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Groudon, setup Zygarde-C, and Zekrom force Yveltal out and can potentially use non-Foul Play variants as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Yveltal has to watch out for Knock Off from opposing Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn, as it becomes a lot easier to wear down with Stealth Rock , which is amplified by it very often being the only Defogger on teams. Losing Heavy-Duty Boots also makes it significantly more susceptible to Calyrex-S and entry hazard stacking cores.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Walls such as Ho-Oh, Eternatus, Zygarde-C, and Toxic Ferrothorn can pressure Yveltal with the status moves they carry. Ho-Oh in particular can still cripple Taunt Yveltal with Sacred Fire, while Ferrothorn can stack up entry hazards, compelling Yveltal to come in more often and get worn down more quickly. However, both must be wary of getting their items removed by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Kyogre and Eternatus can heavily damage Yveltal and force it to switch out. Choice Specs Kyogre and Meteor Beam Eternatus have the potential to greatly harm or OHKO Yveltal, while bulky Calm Mind Kyogre can set up on it and Life Orb Eternatus can force it to repeatedly use Roost while fishing for poison with Sludge Bomb.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Specially defensive Yveltal is one of the most useful Pokemon in the metagame due to it checking Calyrex-S, one of the biggest threats in the tier, like no other. Foul Play deals heavy damage to physically offensive Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Marshadow, and Groudon, while Knock Off cripples Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Ferrothorn, and Eternatus. U-turn allows Yveltal to maintain momentum, providing opportunities for teammates to come in safely. Snarl allows it to counter SubSeed Calyrex-S and check specially offensive Pokemon such as Eternatus and Life Orb Yveltal. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Yveltal from getting worn down by Stealth Rock. Maximum Special Defense investment and 248 HP EVs with a Careful nature ensure that it can tank attacks from Life Orb Calyrex-S and specially offensive Yveltal as well as possible, while 8 Defense EVs allow Yveltal to survive Close Combat from +1 Jolly Life Orb Marshadow. Alternatively, 32 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature ensure that Yveltal breaks Calyrex-S's Substitute with U-turn. A fast spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 60 SpD / 192 Spe along with a Jolly Nature allows Yveltal to switch into Life Orb Groudon and Landorus-T as they use Swords Dance and use Foul Play before they can attack, threatening to OHKO them unless they Dynamax.</p> <p>Yveltal best fits on balance teams, and its defensive presence is appreciated by Pokemon vulnerable to Calyrex-S such as Necrozma-DM and Eternatus. Necrozma-DM, in return, checks Zacian-C and Xerneas, which are common threats to Yveltal, while Eternatus is able to check Kyogre and relieve some pressure on checking special Yveltal. Blissey is able to check threats to Yveltal such as Kyogre, Meteor Beam Eternatus, and Xerneas. Ferrothorn also limits Kyogre and Xerneas, while Yveltal can support Ferrothorn's entry hazards by removing Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and preventing Defog if carrying Taunt. Physically defensive walls such as Lunala and Zygarde-C can check physically offensive Pokemon such as Groudon and Zekrom, which pose a huge threat to non-Foul Play Yveltal. Ho-Oh can be useful to pressure opposing Ferrothorn and Yveltal, pivot into Zacian-C, and absorb status, and it has the option to use a more offensive set with Yveltal fulfilling the Defogger role. Wallbreakers such as Calyrex-S, Zacian-C, Choice Specs Kyogre, and Marshadow take advantage of Yveltal's U-turn. Calyrex-S in particular appreciates Yveltal Imposter-proofing its team and pressuring opposing Yveltal with Knock Off or Taunt. In return, Calyrex-S forces out Zacian-C and Eternatus, can use Aromatherapy, and checks many boosted threats with its Choice Scarf set.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Specially offensive Yveltal is one of the dominant offensive threats in AG due to its solid Special Attack stat, great STAB move combination boosted by Dynamax, Dark Aura, Life Orb, and coverage options letting it break through just about any of its checks. Its typing also allows it to soft check Calyrex-S, which can otherwise tear apart teams easily. Dark Pulse can be difficult to withstand due to Dark Aura, while Max Darkness overwhelms walls such as Eternatus and Ho-Oh by lowering their Special Defense. Oblivion Wing turns into Max Airstream, letting Yveltal outspeed much of the metagame while hitting foes that resist Dark Pulse such as Xerneas and offensive Yveltal for massive damage. Oblivion Wing also gives Yveltal a useful source of recovery, which lets it outlast Calyrex-S and offset Stealth Rock damage. Sucker Punch is used to play mind games with Calyrex-S, KO weakened threats like Marshadow and Groudon, and wreck Blissey as physical Max Darkness. Taunt shuts down specially defensive Yveltal, Blissey, and entry hazard leads such as Shuckle. In addition, it's useful on hyper offense teams to prevent Defog from the likes of Ho-Oh and specially defensive Yveltal, and it can provide safe setup opportunities for teammates by stopping status moves. Roost is an alternative to keep Yveltal consistently healthy in the face of Life Orb and Stealth Rock damage, preventing it from being in KO range of Calyrex-S. Heat Wave is another viable option to KO Zacian-C as Max Flare or after summoning sun with it. Focus Blast is a noteworthy option to severely damage Tyranitar, which is an otherwise excellent answer to Yveltal. Life Orb enhances Dynamax Yveltal's power to unbearable levels, while a Mild nature bolsters its STAB moves without compromising any power on Sucker Punch against Calyrex-S. A 188 SpA / 68 SpD / 252 Spe EV spread should be run with Roost in order to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage.</p> <p>Specially offensive Yveltal fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams as a threatening Dynamax sweeper and soft check to Calyrex-S, which is otherwise extremely difficult to handle. Yveltal is most notably checked by bulky Eternatus, Ho-Oh, specially defensive Yveltal, and Tyranitar. Teammates that can limit these threats such as Calyrex-S, Kyogre, Zacian-C, and Groudon, respectively, are beneficial. In return, Yveltal can shut down most of their checks such as bulky Yveltal, bulky Eternatus, Necrozma-DM, and Lunala, respectively. Calyrex-S is notable for its potential to pass Nasty Plot boosts to Yveltal, helping it break through checks such as specially defensive Eternatus and Ho-Oh. Necrozma-DM is a useful partner to deal with Xerneas and Zacian-C, which is a good answer to Yveltal if it isn't running Heat Wave. Yveltal is crippled by Stealth Rock, so teammates that can get rid of it such as Ho-Oh on bulky offense teams, which is integral due to this set replacing bulky Yveltal, and Excadrill and Regieleki on hyper offense teams are appreciated. Ho-Oh is an especially important partner on bulky offense teams as a second line of defense against Calyrex-S. Shuckle provides Sticky Web support, which lets Yveltal outspeed threats like Zacian-C, Marshadow, Calyrex-S, and Groudon without relying on Max Airstream. Yveltal can struggle against Ditto once it has Dynamaxed, so countermeasures to it such as Regieleki, Ho-Oh, and Zacian-C if Yveltal decides to forego Heat Wave are required.</p> "

Dark Pulse becomes Max Darkness under Dynamax, which lowers foes' Special Defense and 2HKOes almost everything that doesn't resist it. Oblivion Wing gives Yveltal a recovery option and boosts its Speed while it's Dynamaxed, allowing it to sweep weakened teams. Heat Wave targets Zacian-C, OHKOing said foe after some chip damage or if sun has been set by Max Flare, and also OHKOes Ferrothorn. Yveltal can utilize many options for its last move depending on the needs of its team. Rock Slide allows Yveltal to OHKO Ho-Oh, a common switch-in, with Max Rockfall or break through said foe without Dynamaxing after it switches into Dark Pulse. However, it does worsen Yveltal's matchup against Ditto. Knock Off provides great utility by removing key defensive items such as Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers, while hitting Chansey and Ho-Oh hard on their weaker Defense stats. Focus Blast removes Tyranitar, which otherwise walls Yveltal. Hidden Power Poison becomes Max Ooze under Dynamax, which boosts Yveltal's Special Attack and makes it even more difficult to defensively handle; however, Special Attack boosts make Yveltal more susceptible to revenge killing by Ditto. Taunt shuts down Pokemon like Chansey, Ho-Oh, and support Arceus formes after Yveltal has finished Dynamaxing, preventing them from using status options like Toxic, Defog, and recovery moves; however, the former two are already crippled by Knock Off. Sucker Punch can be useful to revenge kill boosted threats such as Ultra Necrozma, Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, and Mewtwo, but the move rarely needs to be used after Yveltal uses Max Airstream. Life Orb gives Yveltal tremendous damage output under Dynamax, letting it break past even very bulky foes such as Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes with its STAB moves. A Rash nature should be used with Rock Slide or Knock Off to preserve their damage output while taking less damage from priority users and faster physical attackers like Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza; otherwise, a Modest nature should be used.</p> <p>Yveltal fits on balance and hyper offense teams due to the support both archetypes can provide for it. Balance is able to deal with Yveltal's relatively few checks, while hyper offense allows Yveltal to clean up weakened opposing teams. Necrozma-DM is a great partner that can check Xerneas and Zacian-C along with support from the likes of Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon. Furthermore, Ho-Oh can provide Defog support, while Primal Groudon can check other dangerous threats such as Primal Kyogre and take advantage of Tyranitar. Zacian-C has fantastic offensive synergy with Yveltal, as the former can pressure special walls like Ho-Oh, Tyranitar, and Chansey, while the latter can easily take advantage of Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Ditto is also an option to consider, as it's able to revenge kill Pokemon like Zacian-C and weakened Geomancy Xerneas.</p> "

          "description": "<p>This Yveltal set is a non-Dynamax-reliant wallbreaker that aims to lure in and cripple usual checks to Yveltal. Knock Off is very spammable thanks to its high damage output, 2HKOing Ho-Oh and OHKOing Chansey, and offers great utility by removing key defensive items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. U-turn deals hefty damage to Tyranitar, a usual switch-in to Yveltal, and allows it to pivot out of unfavorable matchups against Pokemon such as support Arceus formes and Zygarde-C. Sucker Punch gives Yveltal utility in revenge killing faster boosted threats such as Ultra Necrozma, Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, and Mewtwo. Foul Play deals heavy damage to Zacian-C, preventing it from being a safe switch-in to this set; it also deals more damage to Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and most Pokemon that have already had their items removed. An Adamant nature is preferred for maximum wallbreaking potential, but a Jolly nature can be used instead to always outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Zekrom.</p> <p>Choice Band Yveltal doesn't benefit that much from Dynamax; in fact, it can even lower Yveltal's damage output, so try not to use it unless you desperately need the bulk increase. It's a good idea to pair this set with a teammate that can really take advantage of Dynamax. For example, Xerneas benefits from this set pressuring Necrozma-DM and Chansey, while Mewtwo appreciates Yveltal pressuring Lunala and weakening Tyranitar so it can sweep. Because this set doesn't have a way to boost its Speed, it's more important to pair it with a solid defensive core that can check Zacian-C, consisting of the likes of Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, Ditto, and Ho-Oh. This set is walled by support Arceus formes and defensive Zygarde-C, so special wallbreakers like Primal Kyogre and Xerneas are good teammates because they can pressure these foes and get in safely with the assistance of U-turn. Pairing this set with a Stealth Rock setter that beats Ho-Oh, such as Stone Edge Primal Groudon, is a great way to pressure it, allowing teammates such as Dragon Dance + Morning Sun Necrozma-DM to potentially sweep once Ho-Oh's Heavy-Duty Boots has been removed and Stealth Rock is up on the opponent's side.</p> "

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic is usable in the defensive set's last moveslot in order to cripple Zygarde-C's checks like Lunala and the uncommon Lugia and Shedinja. The Dragon Dance set can run Rest instead of Substitute in order to remove status, but it is not recommended due to it leaving Zygarde-C vulnerable. However, running Rest with Thousand Waves over Dragon Tail or Toxic lets Zygarde-C lure Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn into a false sense of security after revealing the lack of Substitute. After trapping these targets, Zygarde-C can proceed to boost up all the way to +6 and clean up. However, this strategy is not very reliable on the whole. Outrage or Stone Edge instead of Dragon Tail or Toxic makes Dragon Dance Zygarde-C more directly threatening, but both options are inferior in more drawn-out games, which Zygarde-C thrives in, and locking into Outrage makes it more vulnerable to Xerneas and Zacian-C.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Pokemon that carry super effective moves against Zygarde-C such as Xerneas, Play Rough Zacian-C, Kyogre, and Ice Punch Marshadow all threaten it. Dragon-types like Eternatus, Zekrom, and Kyurem-W can also revenge kill Zygarde-C with their threatening STAB moves. Eternatus can particularly threaten Zygarde-C by ignoring the effects of Dynamax with Dynamax Cannon. However, they must be careful of Dragon Tail or Max Wyrmwind dealing heavy damage to them. Dragon Dance Zygarde-C can also outspeed and threaten them after a few Dragon Dance boosts.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: Physically defensive walls such as Lunala and bulky Kyogre can pose as huge threats to Zygarde-C. Lunala can nail it with Ice Beam and force it to use Rest with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, while Calm Mind Kyogre can set up on it and wear it down with Scald. However, Toxic wears down Lunala and forces bulky Kyogre to use Rest. Defensive Zygarde-C is very threatening to Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, as it can use Haze to remove its stat boosts and Rest to regain health.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: While Zygarde-C's bulk is impressive, its special bulk its noticeably lower than its physical bulk; this leaves it vulnerable to generally powerful special wallbreakers like Calyrex-S and Life Orb Yveltal, which can wear it down or outright KO it with their STAB moves, especially before Power Construct activates.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Defensive Zygarde-C is one of AG's premier physically defensive walls due to its decent typing, great utility moves, and gigantic bulk letting it check a ton of offensive and defensive Pokemon such as Groudon, Marshadow lacking Ice Punch, Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C lacking Play Rough, and Ho-Oh. Thousand Arrows ignores Ground immunities from Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Yveltal, offering nearly unresisted coverage. Rest is Zygarde-C's only recovery move and circumvents Toxic and Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Lunala, Ho-Oh, Giratina, and Necrozma-DM, allowing it to serve as a reliable status absorber. Coil turns Zygarde-C into a threatening bulky sweeper, letting it take advantage of defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM and go toe to toe with offensive Pokemon like Groudon, Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, and Swords Dance Zacian-C. Alternatively, Haze can be run over Coil to remove boosts from threatening setup sweepers like offensive Groudon, Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, Swords Dance Zacian-C, and Bulk Up Marshadow, although it makes Zygarde-C almost entirely passive. Glare provides amazing support, paralyzing faster foes like Calyrex-S, Xerneas, and Marshadow for Zygarde-C and its teammates. Dragon Tail is also an option over Glare to phaze bulky walls that can handle Zygarde-C like Lunala and Gothitelle, which is otherwise able to trap and PP stall it, and counteract Ho-Oh's Whirlwind. It also becomes Max Wyrmwind under Dynamax, letting Zygarde-C check Groudon better. Scale Shot is a noteworthy mention, as it enables Zygarde-C to outspeed foes like bulky Eternatus, offensive Yveltal, and unboosted Zekrom, making it an even more threatening bulky sweeper paired with Coil. Thousand Waves alongside Scale Shot gives Zygarde-C plenty of room to boost up to nigh-invincible levels after trapping a passive foe such as Ferrothorn or Necrozma-DM. However, Glare and Dragon Tail are generally more useful because they offer better utility to teams, and the Defense drop from Scale Shot disrupts Coil's Defense increases, making it useless without Thousand Waves. 56 Speed EVs let Zygarde-C outspeed some Gothitelle spreads, paralyzed Zacian-C, and paralyzed Calyrex-S, while the remaining EVs and the Impish nature make Zygarde-C more effective against physical attackers such as Groudon, Zacian-C, and Marshadow. If forgoing Glare, Zygarde-C can run an alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD.</p> <p>Zygarde-C fits best on balance teams, since it can check threats like Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh while providing invaluable support with Glare. However, it can be exploited by a bunch of top-tier threats in AG such as Xerneas, Eternatus, Calyrex-S, and Kyogre. Teammates that check these threats such as Necrozma-DM, Calyrex-S, Yveltal, and Eternatus or Kyurem-W, respectively, are thus useful. Necrozma-DM can also deal with Play Rough Zacian-C, which is particularly threatening to Zygarde-C, while also providing Stealth Rock support, which Zygarde-C can take advantage of using Dragon Tail. Partners that can deal with Lunala like Yveltal, Marshadow, and Calyrex-S are also appreciated. Ferrothorn synergizes fantastically with Zygarde-C, as it provides Spikes support, which lets Zygarde-C chip down grounded foes using Dragon Tail, while also checking Xerneas and Kyogre for it. In return, Zygarde-C checks Pokemon that threaten Ferrothorn like Ho-Oh, Groudon, and Marshadow lacking Ice Punch. Offensive teammates like Zacian-C and Marshadow benefit a lot from Zygarde-C's Glare support, as it enables them to outspeed fast foes like Calyrex-S and Zacian-C, respectively. Despite Zygarde-C checking Groudon and Marshadow, Zygarde can be OHKOed by Precipice Blades after a Swords Dance boost before Power Construct activates, and Marshadow can carry Ice Punch to beat Zygarde-C. As a result, revenge killers or secondary checks to them like Ditto, Xerneas, and Eternatus are useful.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Zygarde-C is a threatening setup sweeper, wincon, and Dynamax user in AG because it uses passive Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Ho-Oh as setup bait, giving it a good matchup against defensive teams. Substitute protects Zygarde-C against moves such as Toxic, Knock Off, Leech Seed, and Sacred Fire from Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Ho-Oh while giving it safe opportunities to set Dragon Dance up to take on faster foes. Thousand Arrows heavily damages prominent Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Eternatus, and Necrozma-DM after a boost while hitting the vast majority of the metagame for at least neutral damage. Dragon Tail allows Zygarde-C to get rid of threats such as Ho-Oh and Lugia before they phaze it with Whirlwind. Alternatively, Toxic may be used to severely cripple both Lunala and Lugia and defeat the niche Shedinja. Under Dynamax, Thousand Arrows turns into Max Quake, which boosts Zygarde-C's Special Defense, allowing it to tank even super effective attacks such as Ice Beam from Lunala and Moonblast from Xerneas. Dragon Tail turns into Max Wyrmwind under Dynamax, allowing Zygarde-C to hit Flying- and Dragon-types such as Yveltal and opposing Zygarde-C without negative priority. 16 HP EVs increase Zygarde-C's Leftovers recovery, and, with an Impish nature and 36 Defense EVs, prevent moves such as Ferrothorn's Power Whip, defensive Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike, and Ho-Oh's Brave Bird from breaking its Substitute in its Complete forme. 232 EVs invested in Speed allow Zygarde-C to outspeed everything up to Adamant Zacian-C and Eternatus at +1 Speed. The remaining EVs are allocated into Attack in order to maximize firepower. An alternative 16 HP / 100 Atk / 148 Def / 244 Spe EV spread with a Jolly nature may be run instead in order to outspeed Calyrex-S at +1 without losing bulk. It comes at the cost of some power, however.</p> <p>Zygarde-C best fits on balance teams. A way to pressure Lunala and Lugia is crucial if Zygarde-C forgoes Toxic, as both can easily check it for a long period of time. The likes of Tyranitar, Calyrex-S, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal can work well in this regard, but the latter three must be wary of either Moongeist Beam or Meteor Beam from Power Herb Lunala. Ferrothorn and bulky Eternatus can check Zygarde-C's next largest roadblock in Kyogre, which threatens Zygarde-C with Ice Beam, while setting up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, respectively, making Dragon Tail more threatening for the opponent. Teammates such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM can check another common threat to Zygarde-C in Xerneas. Necrozma-DM can check Play Rough Zacian-C, which can OHKO an unboosted Zygarde-C. Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Zacian-C can pressure Haze Zygarde-C variants, which may trouble Dragon Dance Zygarde-C by preventing it from setting up. On top of that, Zygarde-C hugely benefits from Xerneas and Zacian-C's ability to lure in Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh, which creates setup opportunities for Zygarde-C.</p> "

Substitute protects Zygarde-C from status moves such as Toxic and Leech Seed, letting it set up on most foes that can't break its Substitute and scouting for the foe prematurely Dynamaxing in an attempt to stop its sweep. Dragon Tail allows Zygarde-C to bypass usual means of counterplay to setup sweepers such as phazing and Defense-boosting moves from Pokemon like Ho-Oh and opposing Zygarde-C. Under Dynamax, Max Quake gives Zygarde-C Special Defense boosts and allows it to comfortably tank even super effective hits like Ice Beam from support Arceus formes. Max Wyrmwind allows Zygarde-C to hit Flying-types when it's Dynamaxed and severely damage or OHKO opposing Zygarde-C, Ditto, and Mega Rayquaza after boosts. 16 HP EVs are used to maximize Leftovers recovery, while 232 Speed EVs allow Zygarde-C to outspeed foes like Eternatus, Mega Gengar, and Adamant Zacian-C at +1. 36 Defense EVs with an Impish nature prevent Zygarde-C's Substitute from being broken by attacks like Ho-Oh's Brave Bird, defensive Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike, and Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball in a single hit. The remaining EVs are put into Attack and greatly improve Zygarde-C's offensive presence, letting it 2HKO support Arceus formes with +2 Max Quake and usually OHKO Zacian-C with +1 Thousand Arrows. This set's EV spread is fairly customizable, and more EVs can be put into Attack, Defense, or Speed if desired at the cost of the other two stats.</p> <p>Ferrothorn is a great partner for this set, as it can check Primal Kyogre and support Arceus formes that threaten Zygarde-C, and it makes Dragon Tail more threatening thanks to the support it provides through Spikes and Knock Off. Necrozma-DM is also appreciated for its ability to handle Xerneas and Zacian-C, while Ho-Oh is able to handle support Arceus formes. This set shouldn't be used as a switch-in to Ho-Oh or defensive Necrozma-DM, as the lack of Rest means it won't appreciate status from Toxic or Sacred Fire or having its Leftovers removed by Knock Off. Instead, a partner that can absorb status and Knock Off from these foes such as Refresh Arceus-Water, Rest Primal Kyogre, or even defensive Zygarde-C is recommended. Mega Gengar and Gothitelle are good partners, as they can trap and remove Zygarde-C's checks such as support Arceus formes and opposing Zygarde-C with Haze; Mega Gengar can also force checkmate situations in which the opponent is forced to use their Dynamax, letting Zygarde-C sweep more easily after it Dynamaxes itself. Zacian-C and Eternatus are non-Dynamax-reliant wallbreakers that have good offensive synergy with Zygarde-C, as they can pressure support Arceus formes, while Zygarde-C can take advantage of foes like Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Tyranitar for them.</p> "

Rest is important to keep Zygarde-C healthy and remove status ailments such as Toxic poison from Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, and Necrozma-DM. An anti-setup move is mandatory in order to check sweepers like Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM properly. Haze lets Zygarde-C check opposing Zygarde-C with Dragon Tail, avoid being setup fodder for special attackers like Geomancy Xerneas, and deal with Baton Pass strategies. Alternatively, Coil makes Zygarde-C more threatening offensively thanks to the Attack boosts it provides, but it makes this set setup fodder for opposing Dragon Dance Zygarde-C. Glare is a good option to cripple sweepers like Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM and annoy offensive checks like Xerneas and Primal Kyogre, preventing them from switching in freely. Dragon Tail in tandem with Coil allows Zygarde-C to set up on Ho-Oh and opposing Zygarde-C if they're slower or lack phazing moves and rack up entry hazard damage. However, it is not acceptable as the only move to deal with setup sweepers because Dynamax blocks phazing. Toxic is another option that pressures bulky foes like Ho-Oh more harshly than Glare, but makes it harder to force out Pokemon like defensive Necrozma-DM. Zygarde-C has good Dynamax potential; Max Quake lets it comfortably take even super effective special attacks such as Ice Beam from support Arceus formes and Moonblast from Xerneas. If running Dragon Tail, Max Wyrmwind lets Zygarde-C hit Flying-types while it's Dynamaxed and also OHKOes or severely dents Mega Rayquaza and opposing Zygarde-C after Coil boosts. 48 Speed EVs allow Zygarde-C to outspeed Zacian-C after paralysis from Glare or, if Dragon Tail is run, uninvested Ho-Oh so that Dragon Tail phazes Ho-Oh before it can phaze Zygarde-C with Whirlwind. Leftovers gives Zygarde-C passive recovery so that it does not need to use Rest as often. Safety Goggles can be used with Haze to safely switch into and remove stat boosts from sleep inducers such as Smeargle and Vivillon.</p> <p>Zygarde-C fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its defensive utility as a status absorber and blanket check to physical attackers. The biggest threats to it are support Arceus formes with Ice Beam and strong special attackers such as Xerneas, Yveltal, and Primal Kyogre; therefore, checks to them like defensive Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Ferrothorn make for excellent teammates. Ferrothorn can also provide Spikes support to increase the effectiveness of Dragon Tail sets. Zacian-C with Play Rough is a notable physical attacker that Zygarde-C cannot handle, so teammates like defensive Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Ditto are great for their ability to check or revenge kill it. Mega Gengar and Gothitelle are good partners thanks to their ability to dispose of common checks to Zygarde-C like support Arceus formes and Ho-Oh. Because Zygarde-C is rather passive, wallbreakers like Zacian-C, Xerneas, Yveltal, and Primal Kyogre are good partners to pressure bulky teams. The former two can take advantage of Pokemon that must lock into Outrage to break past Zygarde-C, such as Mega Rayquaza, Ultra Necrozma, and Zekrom; Primal Kyogre appreciates paralysis support from Glare and Zygarde-C's ability to switch into the physical attackers that threaten it.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Zygarde-10% is a unique wallbreaker and late-game cleaner in UU due to its exceptional Speed tier allowing it to outspeed Pokemon like Keldeo, Thundurus, and Lycanroc-D and giving it a great matchup against fast-paced teams. Thousand Arrows sets it apart from other Ground-types, as it can OHKO Pokemon that other Ground-types like Mamoswine struggle to break through like Rotom-W and Rotom-H. Thousand Arrows is also spammable in Grassy Terrain and against Flying-types, and the only UU Pokemon that resist it are Tapu Bulu, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth. Zygarde-10% is one of the only viable Extreme Speed users, allowing it to revenge kill weakened setup sweepers such as Gyarados. Zygarde-10% unfortunately has paper-thin defenses, meaning it cannot switch into virtually anything without taking big damage or being OHKOed. It even takes substantial damage from resisted attacks like Nihilego's Meteor Beam. Zygarde-10% also needs chip damage to OHKO many common threats like Primarina, and failing to OHKO them causes it to get slammed back. While Thousand Arrows provides great overall coverage, Zygarde-10% lacks reliable moves to overcome Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu, which can regain lost HP via Regenerator or Grassy Terrain, although Tapu Bulu must be wary of the possible Iron Tail.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Skitter Smack can be run to potentially OHKO Zarude as it pivots in on Thousand Arrows. Scale Shot is an option on the Choice Band set over Outrage so that Zygarde-10% is not locked into a Dragon-type move for 2-3 turns. However, it is less reliable, as it can miss and can potentially hit only two times for much lower damage. Dragon Dance can be used with Life Orb to allow Zygarde-10% to sweep. However, Zygarde-10% will rarely get an opportunity to set up and will still struggle against Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu. Gyarados typically outclasses this set, as it is bulkier, deals more damage, has better coverage, and can snowball with Moxie. Zygarde-10% is fast enough to run a Coil set to bolster its offensive presence and allow it to hit just as hard as Choice Band, but without locking it into one move. This will also raise its Defense to allow it to withstand an extra hit and increase its accuracy to more reliably use moves like Iron Tail. Zygarde-10% will only realistically get an opportunity to set up against something it forces out, and it will still struggle against Tangrowth even after multiple boosts.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tangrowth totally walls Zygarde-10%, which can only use Toxic against it. Tapu Bulu has to be wary of Iron Tail but takes minimal damage from Thousand Arrows, is immune to Outrage, and can OHKO Zygarde-10%. Amoonguss is immune to Toxic and takes little damage from Thousand Arrows, forcing Zygarde-10% to lock itself into Outrage to 2HKO it, which leaves Zygarde-10% open to Spore or a switch to any Dragon-resistant Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-type Pokemon like Azumarill, Primarina, and Hatterene can freely switch in while Zygarde-10% is locked into a Dragon-type move and KO it. Additionally, while they do not handle Thousand Arrows well, they will not be KOed by it, and Primarina and Hatterene can recover lost HP with Draining Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users: Noivern can OHKO Zygarde-10% with Draco Meteor, though it doesn't switch into Thousand Arrows well. Choice Scarf users like Zarude and Krookodile can do major damage or OHKO Zygarde-10% with their strong STAB attacks. Mamoswine can OHKO Zygarde-10% with Ice Shard, and other priority users like Conkeldurr and Crawdaunt significantly reduce Zygarde-10%'s ability to stay in play.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Quagsire can shrug off Thousand Arrows and inflict Toxic back. Zygarde-10%'s only chance of breaking through them is to hit them with two Outrage attacks, which leaves Zygarde-10% vulnerable to a Fairy-type switch-in. Buzzwole is also problematic for Zygarde-10% with defensive sets being able to shrug off any attack.</p> ",

It also smacks down Celesteela to KO it on the following turn. Extreme Speed is essential for revenge killing faster foes like Dragon Dance Salamence as well as Choice Scarf users like Mienshao. Outrage will OHKO major threats like Salamence and Kommo-o. Toxic can be used to punish Zygarde-10%'s most reliable switch-ins, such as bulky Grass-type Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth, as well as physicially defensive Pokemon like Buzzwole. Iron Tail is also an option to OHKO Tapu Bulu after minimal chip damage as well as 2HKO Hatterene. Toxic is generally more reliable, as it is more accurate and can be used against more foes. Jolly is the required nature, as Adamant will render Zygarde-10% slower than many major threats like Keldeo and Lycanroc-D.</p> <p>Zygarde-10% fits best on offensive or balanced teams. Since Zygarde-10% is too frail to ever reliably switch in, it can only realistically be used as an initial wallbreaker, revenge killer, or late-game cleaner. Slow, bulky pivots like Chansey and Milotic can help get Zygarde-10% in safely to revenge kill Pokemon like Lycanroc-D and Rotom-W attempting to switch in.Tangrowth, Buzzwole, and Tapu Bulu give Zygarde-10% the most problems, so it will need a teammate that can comfortably switch into them like Amoonguss. Chandelure and Moltres can help remove these Pokemon, with the latter bringing Zygarde-10% in against the Rotom formes with U-turn. Nihilego is also an option to handle Grass-types, and it can set up Stealth Rock as well. Entry hazard setters like the aformentioned Nihilego and Krookodile can help wear down the enemy team to enable a Thousand Arrows or Outrage sweep. Rotom-H can help check Mamoswine, one of Zygarde-10%'s biggest threats, pressure the likes of Tangrowth and Buzzwole, and use Volt Switch to bring in Zygarde-10% safely. Since Zygarde-10% pressures Nidoking, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H significantly, Pokemon that struggle with them like Celesteela and Azumarill are good teammates.</p> "

Additionally, its good Speed tier allows it to outpace threats such as non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Urshifu-R, Keldeo, and Tapu Lele, and it has good offensive utility in Extreme Speed. Unfortunately, Zygarde-10% is very frail, limiting its ability to stay in on attacks like Celesteela's Heavy Slam, Skarmory's Body Press, and Rotom-W's Hydro Pump without taking heavy damage before KOing them with Thousand Arrows. While Zygarde-10%'s Dragon / Ground typing is menacing for an offensive Pokemon, it struggles to break through generally bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Slowbro due to its only average Attack stat.</p> ",

Outrage dents Pokemon like Pelipper, Appletun, Araquanid, and Celebi that are neutral or resistant to Thousand Arrows while providing valuable STAB coverage and helping greatly in the Dragon matchup. However, being locked into Outrage makes Zygarde-10% even more vulnerable to powerful attackers like Dragapult and bulky walls like Amoonguss, since it becomes unable to switch out for a few turns. Extreme Speed allows Zygarde-10% to revenge kill faster weakened threats such as Alolan Raichu and Barraskewda. It can use Toxic to lure in and cripple bulky Pokemon such as Slowbro, Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, and Galarian Corsola attempting to wall it in the long run. Maximum Speed investment allows it to outspeed Hydreigon, Urshifu-R, Keldeo, and Choice Specs Latios, while Choice Band is recommended to maximize its damage output and power.

In return, Excadrill can KO Fairy- and Ice-types such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Alolan Ninetales, and Galarian Darmanitan, especially under Hippowdon's sand. Excadrill can also remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin to increase Zygarde-10%'s longevity and use Sand Rush to handle faster threats Zygarde-10% cannot take care of. Mamoswine is also useful for defeating problematic foes such as Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu, outspeeding and picking off faster foes like Dragapult with Ice Shard and removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Eviolite from prominent Pokemon such as Blissey, Mandibuzz, Porygon2, and Galarian Corsola with Knock Off. Hippowdon can deal chip damage on foes by setting Stealth Rock and sand, and it can preserve Zygarde-10%'s poor bulk by switching into most powerful attackers such as Dragonite, Terrakion, and Bisharp. Gastrodon and Seismitoad both provide a valuable Water immunity against Urshifu-R and Barraskewda. Nidoking is good for absorbing Toxic Spikes, setting its own, and using Flamethrower to KO Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu. The pair takes on Steel teams well because Nidoking has excellent coverage in Earth Power and Flamethrower, while Zygarde-10% can force switches with Thousand Arrows.</p> "

This makes Volcanion a decent partner to late-game sweepers and cleaners such as Xurkitree, Necrozma, and Choice Scarf Mienshao. Volcanion's unique resistances and immunity, which include Fire, Fairy, Ice, and Water, also make it an ideal partner to Pokemon such as Zarude, Cobalion, Heracross, and Rhyperior. Zarude and Rhyperior, in addition to other Grass-, Electric-, and Ground-types, can also aid Volcanion by covering its nasty weakness to Electric.

Flamethrower is used over Fire Blast due to its reliability and higher PP, making it better should Volcanion have to do its job multiple times. Toxic is the preferred last move, as it catches the Water-types that wall Volcanion, such as Milotic and Gastrodon. It also cripples Seismitoad, which is one of the few Stealth Rock setters that does not care about Volcanion's STAB moves at all. Haze, on the other hand, shuts down Calm Mind Suicune and potentially erases the boosts of other boosted Pokemon. Heavy-Duty Boots is absolutely mandatory, as it lets Volcanion switch into the Stealth Rock it aims to remove without taking any damage. A Timid nature allows Volcanion to be as fast as possible, notably outrunning all but the fastest Metagross.</p> <p>Defog Volcanion is a nice fit for balance teams that need solid entry hazard removal on their side. While this Volcanion is capable of dishing out significant damage should it need to, it should be played with caution and as a more utility-focused Pokemon, as its main role becomes keeping the field clear for teammates. Volcanion is a rather reliable Defogger, so it gives teams utilizing it the flexibility to run entry hazard-weak Pokemon. Options such as Darmanitan, Alolan Marowak, Heracross, and Obstagoon become much easier to wield effectively without hazards chipping them as they switch in. Electric-types present a problem for Volcanion, so solid switch-ins to them are required. Bulky Grass- and Ground-types, such as Zarude, Steelix, and Rhyperior are good options in this regard. Volcanion's ability to eat up Water-type moves in particular is appreciated by teammates such as Alolan Marowak, Chandelure, and Steelix. Other teammates that can make use of Volcanion's defensive profile include Zarude, Celebi, Cobalion, Heracross, and Vileplume.</p> "

Cinderace can also take on Dark-type Pokemon for Incineroar with High Jump Kick, such as Hydreigon and Tyranitar. Arcanine additionally can revenge kill Pokemon that get out of hand for Incineroar, such as Cloyster, thanks to Choice Band-boosted Extreme Speed.</p> "

However, Incineroar faces competition from other Fire-types such as Volcanion and Heatran, and it has rough matchups against common Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Zygarde. It is also easily worn down pivoting in and out, especially since it rarely can fit Protect or a recovery item in its repertoire.</p> ",

Safety Goggles lets it act as a more reliable check to Amoonguss, but it makes Incineroar very vulnerable to entry hazards and leaves it with no healing.

The unique supportive options provided by Incineroar make it an easy inclusion for most teams.

On the other hand, Burning Jealousy is a nice spread option for Incineroar, but it requires the foe to boost a stat in order to burn. Close Combat hits Dark-types like opposing Incineroar and Rock-types like Nihilego and Stakataka much harder than Flare Blitz. Incineroar's respectable base 115 Attack makes it a potential Dynamax candidate and, if running Close Combat, offers coveted Max Knuckle boosts.

Psychic covers the only answers to its STAB combination in Amoonguss and Tentacruel, and Calm Mind allows it to more easily get past common checks such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Unfortunately, Primarina has very low Speed, often forcing it to take a hit from Pokemon it's supposed to answer, such as Keldeo, before KOing them back. Its similarly low Defense stat makes it 2HKOed by even resisted hits such as Choice Specs Keldeo's Secret Sword after Stealth Rock damage and Crawdaunt's Crabhammer, so it can't check them well despite having the type advantage. Primarina faces some competition from Azumarill as a Water- and Fairy-type wallbreaker, as Azumarill acts a physical wallbreaker, can pressure walls with Knock Off, and has priority in Aqua Jet to make up for the lack of Speed, letting it check Pokemon like Nihilego and Lycanroc-D a lot more comfortably.</p> ",

Even with maximum Defense investment, Primarina is still 2HKOed by Pokemon like Mamoswine and Azumarill. Sparkling Aria is stronger than Scald and bypasses Substitute, but Scald's burn chance is a big help against checks like Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and Tapu Bulu. A Calm Mind + 3 attacks set can be used to boost Primarina's special attack to bypass answers like Tangrowth and Amoonguss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Primarina's best counter is Chansey, as it can stomach even a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump with ease. Chansey also easily beats Substitute Primarina, as it can break the Substitute with Seismic Toss and scare Primarina away with Toxic. Primarina gives Chansey free turns to set up Stealth Rock, heal itself with Soft-Boiled, and bring in teammates with Teleport. Chansey does have to be wary of Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump, though, as it 2HKOes after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth can cripple Primarina with Giga Drain, Sludge Bomb, and their sleep-inducing moves. Both can take on Primarina's STAB moves, but they have to scout for Choice Specs sets, as Psychic 2HKOes Amoonguss, while Moonblast 2HKOes Assault Vest Tangrowth after Stealth Rock damage. Tapu Bulu outspeeds Primarina and can OHKO it with Horn Leech, but it doesn't like switching directly into Moonblast or risking Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Rotom-W can pivot into Primarina's Water-type moves and threaten it with Volt Switch in order to bring in a teammate like Tangrowth, but it is scared of Moonblast. Tentacruel eats any hit Primarina throws at it except Psychic. It also outspeeds Primarina and can pressure it with Sludge Bomb and Knock Off. Volcanion is only bothered by Psychic and can 2HKO Primarina with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Physical Attackers: Faster physical attackers such as Mamoswine, Lycanroc-D, and Zarude threaten Primarina with their powerful STAB moves.

Scald allows Primarina to get a burn on switch-ins like Amoonguss, Celesteela, and Tentacruel, negating the recovery from Leftovers and Black Sludge. 124 Special Defense EVs and Leftovers allow Primarina avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Chandelure's Shadow Ball and 3HKO from Salamence's Hurricane from full HP without Stealth Rock, with the rest put into Defense to take on Dragon Dance Salamence and Keldeo's Secret Sword better.

Necrozma is an excellent partner, as it can threaten Amoonguss and Tentacruel, that would otherwise counter Primarina. Zarude checks Rotom-W and Chansey while appreciating Primarina checking Keldeo and Kommo-o.

Substitute also eases prediction when forcing switches from Pokemon like Salamence and Kommo-o. Draining Kiss aids Primarina in recovering HP, allowing it to take more hits and use Substitute if needed. However, Draining Kiss is a very weak move and will only pose a threat to many Pokemon if Primarina has accumulated enough boosts. Moonblast, on the other hand, is powerful from the start and lets Primarina not rely too much on Calm Mind boosts to threaten Water-resistant Pokemon like Tangrowth and Rotom-W. Scald is a reliable Water-type move, capable of burning Pokemon trying to check it, like Tentacruel, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Leftovers compensates the 25% loss in HP from Substitute. With the given EV spread Primarina is able to beat Amoonguss one-on-one, as it ensures Amoonguss can't break Primarina's Substitute after a Calm Mind. A faster spread with 136 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Conkeldurr but it will require two Calm Mind's for Amoonguss to not break its Substitute, leading to Spore mindgames.</p> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind Primarina fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, as its ability to come in on moves like Draco Meteor from Salamence is greatly appreciated by other teammates. By switching on these moves, Primarina can either get a Substitute up or set up with Calm Mind if its checks have been eliminated or weakened. Strong wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Nidoking, and Aegislash can get past bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Electric-types such as Raikou and Thundurus force Primarina out of the field if it doesn't have a Substitute up, so Pokemon like Rhyperior and Seismitoad take care of them. They can also set Stealth Rock to aid Primarina in its sweep. Amoonguss and Buzzwole can take on strong physical attackers such as Diggersby and Mamoswine for Primarina. Chansey is extremely annoying, as it can take boosted hits with ease and threaten Primarina back with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Conkeldurr, Lycanroc-D, and Swords Dance Diggersby are powerful wallbreakers that can muscle through Chansey and remove it for Primarina.</p> "

Energy Ball is a coverage move for Primarina which allows it to take on opposing Water-types for Primarina, such as non-Choice Specs Primarina, non-Thunderbolt stall Rotom-W, and Gastrodon. 248 HP and 148 Defense EVs allow Primarina to take an Poison Jab from Choice Band Haxorus and Choice Band Urshifu, while the 64 Special Defense combined with the aforementioned HP gives Primarina the bulk to take a Hyper Beam from Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Alternatively, running 96 HP and 196 Special Defense alongside 156 Special Attack with a Modest Nature allows Choice Specs Primarina to beat Porygon-Z, even if their Choice Specs is removed through Trick. A spread of 252 HP / 232 Def / 20 SpA / 4 SpD with a Bold Nature can be run in order to survive a Rock Wrecker from Choice Band Crustle.</p> <p>Bulky Pokemon with Mirror Coat like Milotic and Avalugg take out Primarina with ease, so teammates that can counteract those Pokemon like Sylveon and Taunt Whimsicott make good partners for Primarina. In return for these teammates, Primarina can take down Steel-types that these are weak to like Corviknight and Excadrill. Primarina is also stopped in its tracks by Grass-types like Celebi, Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, Venusaur, and Whimsicott, so Fire-types like Arcanine and Salazzle can make good partners for Primarina, also allowing there to be a potential Fire / Water / Grass core. In return, Primarina can take out Water-types with its Energy Ball, such as Blastoise, non-Choice Specs Primarina, and Gastrodon. Primarina also loses Electric-types like Zeraora, Dracozolt, and Toxtricity, so Ground-types like Rhyperior and Choice Scarf Diggersby and Pokemon with Ground-type coverage like Conkeldurr and Choice Scarf Haxorus make good teammates for Primarina. In return, Primarina can take on Pokemon for the Ground-types like Blastoise, non-Choice Specs Primarina, Gastrodon, and Galarian Darmanitan. Stall Pokemon that can take advantage of Primarina like Galarian Corsola and Type: Null pose a threat to it, so wallbreakers like Taunt Corviknight and Incineroar are good teammates for Primarina. In return, Primarina can take down Choice Band Dracovish, Choice Scarf Rotom-H, and Keldeo for these teammates.</p> "

It's also blessed with a solid Defense stat and a resistance to Fighting, which lets it switch into Gurdurr and Machoke with relative ease. Skitter Smack is Charjabug's primary attack due to its ability to cripple special attackers that may switch in such as Magmar and Hattrem while also being powerful enough to 2HKO Choice Specs variants of the latter. Volt Switch lets Charjabug generate momentum and safely switch out of setup sweepers such as Combusken, Klang, and Fraxure, which all would otherwise use it as setup fodder. Lastly, Toxic allows Charjabug to cripple Defog users like Vullaby and Gurdurr in addition to opposing hazard setters like Galarian Corsola and Piloswine. Alternatively, Thunder Wave allows Charjabug to cripple Golbat, and can lower the Speed of Pokemon that are unaffected by Sticky Web such as Drakloak and Klang.</p> <p>Charjabug should aim to set up Sticky Web as early in the game as possible, although it should be wary of Magic Bounce if Hattrem is present on the opponent's team. After Sticky Web has been set, Charjabug can freely spread status and use Volt Switch to pivot into strong breakers to take advantage. Wallbreakers like Machoke, Rufflet, and Gastly make great use of the speed control that Charjabug provides and benefit greatly from its ability to bring them in safely with a slow Volt Switch, the latter also being an offensive spinblocker. Charjabug has no reliable recovery and is very prone to being worn down, so pairing it with Wish users like Clefairy and Togetic can increase its longevity; the aforementioned Fairy-types also function as great physically defensive walls and can alleviate some pressure from Charjabug. Charjabug's weakness to entry hazards limits the number of times it is able to switch in, so Rapid Spin users like Wartortle and Galarian Mr. Mime can be beneficial. Spikes users such as Carkol, Roselia, and Ferroseed not only form solid entry hazard-stacking cores but can act as specially defensive walls covering Charjabug's mediocre special bulk.</p> "

Drill Run is another coverage option that allows Lycanroc-D to hit defensive Steel- and Fire-types, but it is not as useful in a metagame where Flying-types and Levitate are common. A Rock-type Lycanroc-D with Accelerock provides alternate Tough Claws-boosted priority that can hit foes more reliably than Sucker Punch, but its power is much weaker and it leaves Lycanroc-D running Stone Edge, which isn't boosted by its ability and has shaky accuracy. Psychic Fangs allows Lycanroc-D to hit Poison-type walls like Cresselia and Latias reliably, but the prevalence of Dark-types in the metagame makes using this move harder to justify.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Poison-types: Bulky Poison-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Latias, and Cresselia each have methods of checking and stalling Lycanroc-D thanks to their access to recovery, useful abilities, and status-inflicting moves like Scald from Toxapex and Toxic from each.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage: With Life Orb being its best item, Lycanroc-D is constantly chipping its own health. Outside of Steel-type variants, Lycanroc-D is open to chip damage from every entry hazard, and running contact moves to take advantage of Tough Claws means Rocky Helmet effectively punishes it. Too much chip damage over a battle can severely limit Lycanroc-D's opportunities to cause damage.</p> <p><strong>Extreme Speed</strong>: Although Steel-type Lycanroc-D resists Extreme Speed, all other variants take neutral damage from it and are easily 2HKOed by unboosted hits. +1 or Choice Band-boosted Extreme Speed from Adamant Entei or Lucario can OHKO Lycanroc-D with a favorable roll or after minor chip damage.</p> ",

Combine this with its nice Speed, a plethora of strong physical contact moves, and access to priority, setup, and Stealth Rock, and it becomes one of the scariest wallbreakers in the metagame. Crunch grants Lycanroc-D a Dark typing and STAB on Sucker Punch. Iron Head notably covers the Fairy-types aiming to wall Dark-type moves while Play Rough covers the Dark- and Fighting-types hoping to check Dark-type attacks. Close Combat is a third option for the secondary STAB move that provides a much higher Base Power and hits Normal- and Steel-types even harder, but it leaves Lycanroc-D unable to hit Pokemon with Fairy and Poison typings, like Cresselia, as easily. Sucker Punch provides Lycanroc-D with powerful priority to take on faster offensive threats like Dragapult, Tornadus-T, and Naganadel. Lycanroc-D is a great Stealth Rock setter thanks to its breaking potential forcing the opponent to switch often. Swords Dance is another option that quickly makes Lycanroc-D even more threatening and can potentially lead to sweeps with a stronger Sucker Punch. Life Orb provides Lycanroc-D with the most immediate power, but it wears it down over longer battles and can put it in range of even resisted hits like Extreme Speed due to its poor bulk. Focus Sash is an option, particularly if you're running Lycanroc-D as a lead, to allow it to use Stealth Rock or Swords Dance safely. A Jolly nature is needed to outspeed threats like Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Terrakion and Speed tie with Latios and Latias.</p> <p>While Lycanroc-D has various methods of breaking through walls, team support is very important to optimize its damage output and opportunities to come in. Lycanroc-D's most common typings are able to hit most defensive typings at least neutrally, but they can struggle to break past certain combinations like Water / Poison, Dark / Poison, and certain Fairy and Flying typings. Strong special attackers like Dragon / Electric Latios and Ground / Steel Hydreigon can help Lycanroc-D pressure threats like Toxapex, Latias, and Cresselia. Lycanroc-D is able to target certain faster threats with Sucker Punch, but it is unable to take on most Extreme Speed users, since its defenses are frail. Bulky Normal-type checks like Ghost / Dragon Salamence and Ghost / Fighting Slowbro can take on Extreme Speeds aimed at Lycanroc-D and chip their users with Rocky Helmet. Lycanroc-D also appreciates teammates like Tornadus-T and Dark-type Heracross that can remove opposing Rocky Helmets and, in Tornadus-T's case, remove entry hazards with Defog to cut down on the residual damage Lycanroc-D takes.</p> "

Unaware serves as a way to prevent setup sweepers with priority from killing Toxapex before it can Haze, but is more susceptible to Taunt users. Knock Off can be used over Scald as a strong option that enables Toxapex to maintain utility against Desolate Land users, but loses the threat of Scald burns versus physical attackers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water Absorb Pokemon: Generally Water Absorb pokemon such as Excadrill and Palossand are able to switch into Toxapex and threaten it with strong attacks, making it difficult for Toxapex to spread Scald Burns; however, this can be risky if Toxapex is yet to reveal that it isn't running Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Desolate Land Pokemon: Offensive Desolate Land Pokemon such as Victini and Heatran are able to switch into Toxapex fairly easily if it doesn't have Knock Off, and they often threaten super effective coverage to force it out.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Water-resistant special attackers such as Kyurem and Hydreigon are able to switch into Toxapex fairly easily because they aren't threatened by Scald and can do large amounts of damage with their STAB options.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Due to its passive nature, Toxapex is highly susceptible to Taunt from setup sweepers such as Zapdos-Galar and Gengar.

Priority Recover is also very notable; Toxapex can freely use Scald or Gastro Acid without needing to stay excessively healthy to check another Pokemon, since it can Recover first anyway. Toxapex's typing also allows it to switch in on various other Pokemon, including Fire-types such as Victini. Scald discourages physical attackers like Tapu Bulu from switching in on Toxapex. A Bold nature alongside 252 HP and 252 Defense EVs maximizes Toxapex's physical bulk to check Terrakion better. Depending on team needs, other abilities can be considered over Prankster, like Levitate for taking on Ground-types, but Prankster is still a better option overall.</p> <p>Toxapex fits best on balanced and defensive teams that appreciate its defensive utility. Corviknight, especially Intimidate and Unaware variants, is an exceptional teammate; it checks Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus-T that threaten Toxapex while providing Defog support to prevent its team from being weakened by entry hazards. It also can check Noivern, which can easily beat Toxapex. However, as Corviknight can be sometimes overwhelmed by Noivern, more specific checks like Assault Vest Silvally-Electric and Jirachi can be considered instead. In return, Toxapex can notably take on Terrakion for Corviknight. Since Toxapex doesn't like taking Shadow Ball from Ghost-types like Gengar and Blacephalon, Pokemon such as Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Blissey can provide a switch-in to these Pokemon. Snorlax is a notable teammate because, thanks to Poison Heal, it can absorb status and Knock Off for Toxapex, enabling its longevity. Other Pokemon such as Poison Heal Clefable and Magic Bounce Hippowdon can be also considered for this role, as they offer similar support.</p> "

While Hydreigon generally runs Ground-type, it sets itself apart from other Ground-type attackers, as its Water / Dragon set breaks Toxapex as well. Ground / Steel Hydreigon in particular is able to threaten Toxapex without fear of being poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Attackers</strong>: Electric-type attackers such as Tapu Koko, Latios, and Clefable are all able to threaten Toxapex in some way, though they can struggle to break past Dark / Poison Toxapex in some cases.

Regenerator and Recover give it multiple tools to increase its longevity. Knock Off gives Toxapex its Dark typing while providing valuable team support.

Said qualities allow it to wall a wide range of dangerous threats such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Charizard Y. In addition, its access to both Recover and Regenerator allows it to securely pivot into many additional threats, such as Mega Mawile, Aegislash, and Kartana, in order to scout their moves. Haze is useful in order to deter setup attempts from a vast array of threats, consisting of Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Kartana, Aegislash, and Mega Mawile lacking Thunder Punch. Baneful Bunker is the preferred move in the fourth slot, as it allows Toxapex to punish the heavily threatening Mega Medicham, check Ash-Greninja more comfortably, scout for Z-Moves from the likes of Kartana and punish U-turn users such as Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T. Toxic may be run instead, as it allows Toxapex to directly cripple Pokemon such as Mega Latias, Gastrodon, Mega Tyranitar, and Slowbro. It also enables it to punish Defoggers such as Zapdos and Tapu Fini. Knock Off can be run over Scald or in the fourth slot as well, giving Toxapex a way to punish offensive and defensive Pokemon alike, such as Tapu Lele, Clefable, and Tapu Fini. Toxic Spikes can be run in the fourth slot too, as Toxapex's bulk gives it an ample amount of opportunities to set it up while also providing it with a good way of punishing switches. However, with the prominence of Toxic Spikes-immune Pokemon such as Clefable, Heatran, Gliscor, Zapdos, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Slowbro and Blissey, the output is often not very notable. The given EV spread in tandem with a Bold nature and Black Sludge recovery allows Toxapex to check strong physical attackers such as, Mega Lopunny, Swords Dance Aegislash, and Bisharp as reliably as possible. Rocky Helmet may be used instead in order to punish various physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny and Kartana.</p> <p>Toxapex fits best on balance teams that benefit from its ability to check and disrupt a wide range of threats. Landorus-T and Ice Beam variants of Clefable and Mega Latias have great synergy alongside Toxapex, as they are able to pivot into and threaten out Ground-types such as Garchomp, Gliscor, opposing Landorus-T, and Excadrill. Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Aegislash, can check specific dangerous Psychic-types such as Calm Mind Mega Latias and Tapu Lele and take advantage of Clefable, which fears nothing Toxapex can throw at it bar Knock Off.

If running Toxic Spikes, Pokemon that benefit from it such as Gliscor, Heatran, and Mega Lopunny, have a much easier time breaking through their checks. Reuniclus is another notable mention, as Toxic Spikes allows it to outlast grounded Dark-types such as Mega Tyranitar, Ash-Greninja, and Weavile. In return, it can use Pokemon drawn in by Toxapex, such as Clefable and Gliscor, as setup fodder and, very notably, counter Mega Medicham.</p> "

It also has one of the best Attack stats in the tier and good coverage moves such as Heavy Slam, Close Combat, and Rock Slide. However, even with its good bulk and Attack, it lacks Speed and resistances. Mudbray's lacking defensive role compression means there are better Stealth Rock setters, such as Onix and Pawniard, and it is often taken advantage of by common Water- and Grass-types such as Staryu and Foongus.</p> ",

Substitute can also soak up status from moves such as Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Koffing.

On the other hand, Rock Slide can be used over Heavy Slam to hit Vullaby harder and OHKO Wingull, but this would require more prediction. Close Combat is for Ferroseed and Porygon and can 2HKO both.

Heavy Slam hits harder than Rock Slide against neutral targets and does a good amount of damage to Flying-types that switch in.

Alternatively, Protect helps Mudsdale accumulate poison damage, gain extra health from Leftovers, and scout Choice item attackers like Rotom-C and Choice Specs Decidueye.

Furthermore, it is able to punish opposing Defoggers such as Timburr and Vullaby when they switch in by severely damaging them with a powerful Water Bubble-boosted Surf or, in the case of Vullaby, hitting it with Icy Wind.

Since Flying-types like Vullaby and Wingull ignore Sticky Web and can OHKO Dewpider, checks to them like Onix, Magnemite, and Chinchou are helpful, although Chinchou is mediocre outside of this role.

Klefki is also notable for providing Spikes support and Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats like Noivern. Spikes support is appreciated to punish attempts to pivot around Bewear's choice-locked attacks. Spikers such as Roserade, Golisopod, and Dragalge also provide great support in Sleep Powder, Knock Off, or Flip Turn. Roserade and Dragalge also check Electric-types trying to revenge kill Bewear such as Raikou and Xurkitree.

In particular, its higher Speed stat is what differentiates it from Dhelmise and lets it outspeed the whole unboosted metagame except Jolly Barraskewda after a Rapid Spin. Tsareena's vulnerability to Toxic and difficulty to fit Synthesis make it unable to naturally switch into Electric- and Water-types like Raikou, Xurkitree, and Gastrodon unlike other Grass-types such as Roserade, Vileplume, and Celebi. Knock Off removes crucial items like Heavy-Duty Boots from switch-ins such as Incineroar while not giving away any free switches to Chandelure and Metagross. Triple Axel catches Flying- and Grass-types such as Togekiss, Noivern, and Vileplume on the switch. High Jump Kick, U-turn, and Synthesis are all great options, but without either Knock Off or Triple Axel, Tsareena is left completely vulnerable to common threats like Chandelure and Togekiss. With Heavy-Duty Boots, Tsareena can repeatedly switch into entry hazards to remove them with Rapid Spin. Queenly Majesty protects Tsareena from priority moves like Golisopod's First Impression, which lets it win the matchup and keep entry hazards off the field.</p> <p>Cobalion is the biggest thorn in Tsareena's side, as it switches into any attack with impunity, can raise its Attack through Justified, either sets Stealth Rock or Swords Dance for free, and can punish Tsareena for spinning with Rocky Helmet. Therefore, any Tsareena without High Jump Kick should be paired with a solid Cobalion answer such as Gastrodon, Seismitoad, or Reuniclus. On its own, Tsareena isn't a very reliable switch-in to Electric- and Water-types like Raikou and Milotic, but more reliable checks such as Gastrodon and Dragalge can pick up the slack. While Flying-types such as Togekiss, Crobat, and Tornadus need to watch out for Triple Axel, they all outspeed and threaten Tsareena with their STAB moves. Metagross, Raikou, and Diancie can check said Flying-types for Tsareena. Poison-types such as Roserade, Salazzle, and Galarian Weezing can either threaten or wall Tsareena. Roserade is especially a nuisance, as it's a Spikes setter that Tsareena loses to. Pokemon such as Crobat can check Roserade while Seismitoad and Gastrodon help with the latter two.

Answers to Dragon Dance Necrozma, such as Umbreon and Tangela, are crucial because Pyukumuku fails to wall Necrozma due to Photon Geyser invalidating Unaware. Teammates like Bronzong and Assault Vest Reuniclus help wall strong Grass-types like Celebi and Roserade, which Pyukumuku fails to pressure with Toxic. Electric-type answers like Vileplume and Gastrodon are helpful teammates for Xurkitree and Raikou. Reuniclus and Tangela aid Pyukumuku by pressuring Steel-types such as Metagross and Cobalion, which Pyukumuku fails to do when it's not running Spite. Due to Pyukumuku's susceptibility to hazards, hazard control from the likes of Xatu, Crobat, and Galarian Weezing is needed.</p> "

Frailer or slower threats appreciate Type: Null bringing them in safely against Pokemon like Dusknoir, Klinklang, and Stunfisk via U-turn. Choice Band Morpeko, Flame Orb Throh, and Choice Specs Golduck are prime examples, with the former being able to deal with Substitute Calm Mind Drifblim. Lastly, clerics such as Vespiquen and Togetic are appreciated, as Type: Null's reliance on Rest means it can be taken advantage of as well as overwhelmed. They also check Fighting-types like Hitmonchan and appreciate Type: Null dealing with Ice-types like Glaceon.</p> "

Toxic can be used to cripple physical walls such as Cofagrigus and Pyukumuku, but Silvally-Ground has trouble fitting the move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Tangela and Gourgeist-S are able to comfortably take hits from Silvally-Ground and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Poliwrath, Wishiwashi, and Pyukumuku can pressure Silvally-Ground with their STAB moves or status.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Ice-types such as Choice Scarf Arctovish and Alolan Sandslash in hail outspeed Silvally-Ground and can threaten it with their STAB options. Piloswine is able to take a +2 Multi-Attack and retaliate with Icicle Crash; it can also threaten to revenge kill a weakened Silvally-Ground with Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Due to its lack of recovery, Silvally-Ground can be worn down by residual damage like Iron Barbs from Ferroseed, Aftermath from Skuntank, and Rocky Helmet. It can also be crippled by status, limiting its effectiveness late-game.</p> ",

This strategy can beat Pokemon such as Dracovish, Diggersby, and Sawk. This set's main purpose is psychological warfare; its presence instills fear into the opponent at Team Preview, making the user's own picking easier. The EVs are irrelevant due to the nature of being Level 1. Endeavor is crucial in order to bring the foe to 1 HP for Togedemaru to finish it off with Toxic or Spiky Shield. Toxic is Togedemaru's main way to finish off the foe. Note that if the foe uses Counter, Toxic should be used first before Endeavor. Spiky Shield is used to finish off the foe if they rely on contact moves, such as Sawk, Durant, and Conkeldurr. This is useful because unlike Toxic, Spiky Shield cannot miss, and it protects Togedemaru from moves like Knock Off, which removes Shell Bell, and Iron Head, which can cause Togedemaru to flinch. Additionally, Spiky Shield is also used to scout for Trick or Switcheroo from common Choice-item Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Malamar. If Trick or Switcheroo is used, Encore can then be used to lock the foe into the move, allowing Togedemaru to freely use Endeavor and Toxic. Encore also allows Togedemaru to turn its matchup against Will-O-Wisp users like Arcanine into a coinflip. Berry Juice is another option over Shell Bell, allowing Togedemaru to consistently beat Counter users like Chansey while sacrificing matchups against some Sitrus Berry users like Arcanine. Alternatively, Disarming Voice can be used for its flawless accuracy and ability to hit Steel-types like non-Rock Blast Choice Band Steelix and Choice Specs Magnezone. However, Disarming Voice must be used with Shell Bell in order to bring the enemy to 1 HP. Togedemaru is completely helpless against anything that is immune to Endeavor, such as Dragapult, Galarian Corsola, and Zeraora after it uses Plasma Fists. Pokemon like Fake Tears Sylveon can help remedy this, along with beating Rest users like Type: Null and stall Rotom-W, while Togedemaru takes care of threats to Sylveon such as Dracovish and Diggersby. The FEAR strategy also gets ruined by Substitute, Encore, and Yawn users such as Volcarona, Aromatisse, and Sylveon. Choice Band Dracovish can take care of these threats as well as help with Taunt users like Corviknight and Mandibuzz that Togedemaru cannot break. In return, Togedemaru can defeat Pokemon like Sawk and non-Substitute Kyurem. Togedemaru is also weak to Pokemon that use Mold Breaker, such as Haxorus and Excadrill, so teammates like bulky Primarina can cover for them. Togedemaru in return beats Pokemon like Diggersby and Milotic for Primarina.</p> "

Additionally, Disguise lets Mimikyu act as a potent revenge killer as well, giving it an opportunity to handle extremely threatening foes such as Hydreigon, Weavile, and boosted Kommo-o while blanket checking most other Pokemon. Swords Dance boosts Mimikyu's underwhelming damage output to high levels, and it can be used on Pokemon that it forces out such as Mega Sableye, Tyranitar, and Mandibuzz. Drain Punch hits Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Magnezone super effectively while providing Mimikyu with passive recovery. Shadow Claw can be used instead to deal much more damage to walls like Galarian Corsola, Aegislash, and Slowbro. After a Swords Dance boost, Shadow Sneak OHKOes faster threats like Blacephalon, Gengar, and Alolan Raichu while KOing weakened foes such as Barraskewda, Tapu Koko, and Victini. However, be cautious of using Shadow Sneak against Victini if Psychic Terrain is up. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is used to outspeed Pokemon like Kyurem, Nidoking, and Tapu Lele.

Swords Dance boosts Mimikyu's average Attack stat and, in conjunction with Disguise, allows it to act as a potent late-game wincon. Play Rough is Mimikyu's strongest attack and allows it to deal with dangerous Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-type threats such as Hydreigon, Greninja, and Terrakion. Shadow Claw allows Mimikyu to deal with opposing Ghost-types and Psychic-types such as Blacephalon, Gengar, Tapu Lele, and Victini. Shadow Sneak further enhances Mimikyu as a formidable late-game sweeper, being able to deal with weakened threats and OHKO threats like Gengar, Blacephalon, and Latios after a Swords Dance boost, making Mimikyu a key wincon in the Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups. Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature allows Mimikyu to outspeed key threats in Tapu Lele, Nidoking and Excadrill. Life Orb helps ameliorate Mimikyu's subpar Attack stat while also ensuring Shadow Sneak does considerable damage.</p> <p>Klefki pairs exceptionally well with Mimikyu, as it provides dual screens support, Spikes support, and a Poison-type immunity. Spikes helps weaken foes, allowing Mimikyu to sweep late-game without much trouble, while dual screens make Mimikyu an even more reliable setup sweeper. Klefki can also provide Thunder Wave support, crippling threats that outspeed Mimikyu like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Lopunny. Mega Diancie helps greatly in the Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-type matchups while also providing Stealth Rock support to chip down foes. Mega Diancie's Magic Bounce also blocks entry hazards such as Spike and Toxic Spikes that could easily cripple Mimikyu. Tapu Koko teams up well with Mimikyu, mostly because it deals with walls such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Toxapex that can deal with Mimikyu without much trouble while also helping greatly in the Flying- and Water-type matchups. Tapu Bulu is able to break through Mimikyu's walls such as Hippowdon and defensive Water-types such as Toxapex and Swampert. Tapu Lele has useful wallbreaking capabilities with Choice Specs, dealing with Mimikyu's defensive checks such as Toxapex, while also aiding in the Poison matchup. Belly Drum Azumarill pairs well with Mimikyu as a secondary sweeper, mainly helping in the Steel matchup, which Mimikyu struggles in greatly.

Sadly, Dhelmise is extremely prone to being statused by foes like Rotom-C and Vaporeon, severely cutting into its longevity and forcing it to waste turns recovering health more frequently. Additionally, Dhelmise is at times a shaky answer to the Pokemon it wants to check because of their access to super effective coverage for it, meaning it must remain at or near maximum health to be a safe switch-in, which is difficult because of its vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards. Dhelmise's poor Copperajah matchup is also notable, making it a worse hazards remover against such teams.</p> ",

It can take advantage of these Pokemon to set up with Dragon Dance, which helps compensate for its middling Speed and Attack stats and allows it to sweep late-game. Substitute provides Hakamo-o with even more opportunities to set up, as it can set up a Substitute in front of Pokemon like Tangela, Shadow Ball Galarian Corsola, and Ferroseed to boost up without fear of getting statused or having its Eviolite removed by Knock Off. Dual Chop can be used in place of Dragon Claw to KO Focus Sash Kadabra after a Dragon Dance and damage foes like Lampent through a Substitute, but the imperfect accuracy and increased chance of triggering Galarian Corsola's Cursed Body make it a risky option. Drain Punch helps to compensate for the HP lost when setting up Substitute and makes it very difficult for Hakamo-o to be worn down low enough to be knocked out by a priority move. Alternatively, Iron Head can be used to KO weakened Fairy-types after a boost, especially if their Eviolite has been removed.

A Steel-type like Klang can check the aforementioned Fairy-types as well as Psychic-types like Galarian Mr. Mime and Kadabra, which force Hakamo-o out. Choice Band Thwackey partners nicely with Hakamo-o, as it can bring it in safely via U-turn against Tangela, Koffing, and Ferroseed, which Hakamo-o can set up against, or wear them down shared checks like Golbat with Knock Off. The passive recovery from Grassy Terrain that Thwackey provides allows Hakamo-o to stay healthy as it cuts its HP for Substitute.

However, Kommo-o cannot do much against Fairy-types, so partners like Mold Breaker Haxorus and Duraludon are needed to help take care of Mimikyu and Grimmsnarl. Hydreigon is also a good partner for Kommo-o due to it being able to take care of Psychic-types such as Reuniclus.</p> "

These two moves allow Kommo-o to wall and takedown threats like Crustle, Rotom-W, and Snorlax. Clanging Scales is a STAB move for hitting Dragon-types such as Dracovish, Timid Choice item Dragapult, and Dracozolt. The fourth slot can either be Counter, used to beat Choice Band Urshifu-S and Urshifu-R, Taunt, which is used for shutting down stall Pokemon like Corviknight and Gastrodon, or Substitute, which is for walling most Sylveon variants, In this case, Soundproof grants Kommo-o immunity to Hyper Voice, although there are risks involved for variants that carry both Quick Attack and Hyper Beam. Haban Berry is used to tank other Dragon-type attacks, namely Draco Meteor from Dragapult and Outrage from Choice Band Dracovish and Choice Band Dracozolt. The HP investment is for tanking a Draco Meteor from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult, while the Special Attack investment is to ensure that Clanging Scales OHKOes non-Haban Berry Dracovish. The Speed investment is to outspeed Adamant Choice Band Diggersby and the rest is dumped into Defense with a Bold nature to maximize defensive and offensive capabilities. An alternative EV spread of 200 HP / 84 Def / 224 SpD with a Bold nature can be run in order to survive a Choice Scarf Hyper Beam from Porygon-Z, with the leftover EVs invested into Defense to maximize Body Press' power.</p> <p>Kommo-o's typing makes it extremely weak to Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Primarina, and Aromatisse. Steel- and Poison-types such as Durant, Togedemaru, and Silvally-Poison are good teammates since they can deal with these threats. Kommo-o is a good partner for Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight, as it covers their weakness to Fire- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Incineroar and Conkeldurr. Kommo-o struggles to deal with Ghost-types that can't be OHKOed by Clanging Scales, Pokemon that can 2HKO it such as Aegislash, Gengar and Chandelure, as well as Psychic-types that OHKO it such as Celebi and Gardevoir. As such, Pokemon with naturally high Special Defense like Choice Band Snorlax and Choice Specs Rotom-H make for generally good partners, since they can often take a hit and then OHKO back. Kommo-o is also weak to Ice-type moves from Pokemon such as Avalugg, Galarian Darmanitan, and offensive Kyurem, so Fire- and Rock-types such as Arcanine and Crustle are good partners for Kommo-o.</p> "

Clanging Scales is needed to use Kommonium Z, and it is also useful to hit Pokemon behind a Substitute such as Zapdos and Suicune. Drain Punch allows Kommo-o to take care of troubling Normal-, Steel-, Ice-, and Dark-types such as Blissey, Heatran, Mamoswine, and Tyranitar while giving it some passive recovery. Flamethrower goes well with its Fighting typing, as it enables Kommo-o to take care of other Steel- and Ice-types such as Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Avalugg. Taunt is used to avoid phazing from Whirlwind users like Skarmory and Hippowdon and Toxapex's Haze, along with blocking Toxic from Pokemon like Aegislash and Blissey. Clangorous Soul is an option over Taunt to boost Kommo-o's stats even further, but it makes Kommo-o prone to being phazed by Mantine and a healthy Skarmory and has a huge drawback of costing a third of its HP. Soundproof is used to make Ditto and opposing Kommo-o unable to revenge kill Kommo-o with Clanging Scales. A Naive nature with 252 Speed EVs allows it to outpace Pokemon like Mamoswine, speed tie with Nidoking, and outspeed Mega Lopunny and Zeraora after using Kommonium Z.</p> <p>Garchomp is great to pair with Kommo-o, as it can set up Stealth Rock and take care of Pokemon like Jirachi for it. Kyurem is great to help beat Water-types that can hinder Kommo-o like Tapu Fini and Greninja with Freeze-Dry. Dragalge can provide Toxic Spikes to make it easier for Kommo-o to sweep in Normal- and Dark-type matchups and can use Flip Turn to safely bring in Kommo-o. Dragalge's Poison typing also allows it to come into special Fairy-type attacks from Tapu Koko and Tapu Fini and take care of them with Sludge Wave. Dragalge can also absorb Toxic Spikes to protect Kommo-o from being poisoned. Mega Altaria pairs well with Kommo-o, forming a Dark-type breaking core with Mega Altaria taking care of Mega Sableye and Mandibuzz while Kommo-o takes care of Bisharp. Latias is great speed control for Dragon teams, as it can take care of Keldeo, Mega Swampert, and Cloyster after it uses Shell Smash. It is also useful to get rid of entry hazards with Defog and bring back Kommo-o to full health with Healing Wish. Mega Latias is a great teammate for Kommo-o, as it can help greatly in the Flying-type matchup by taking care of Tornadus-T and Zapdos thanks to its BoltBeam coverage. Hydreigon helps greatly in the Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups taking care of threats like Blacephalon and Celebi. Hydreigon can also bring Kommo-o in with U-turn.</p> "

However, Tapu Koko has rather underwhelming offensive stats and limited coverage options, meaning that bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking can be very problematic. Furthermore, Tapu Koko doesn't have especially good bulk, which means that it'll take a lot of damage from any decently strong attack.

Heatran also takes advantage of Grass-types that Tapu Koko forces in, can set Stealth Rock to wear down the opposing team, and use Toxic to cripple Pokemon like Hippowdon and Swampert that wall Tapu Koko. Additionally, it can trap and remove Blissey with the combination of Magma Storm and Taunt. Offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana appreciate that Tapu Koko can switch in and take advantage of their defensive checks like Corviknight and Mandibuzz while also being a good answer to Tornadus-T.

Landorus-T can set Stealth Rock and use U-turn to bring Tapu Koko in against Pokemon like Corviknight and Slowbro while also being a good check to some opposing Ground-types. Slowbro and Slowking can both use Future Sight and Teleport to help Tapu Koko put pressure on the opposing team, especially against Ground-types that might try to switch into it.

Volt Switch allows it to pivot out of checks such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar, rack chip damage on foes, and bring in a teammate to deal with these checks. Dazzling Gleam breaks through Dragon- and Dark-types such as Latias, Latios, Hydreigon, Zarude, and Urshifu-S.

Tapu Koko’s moveslots can be flexible, and some teams may require Tapu Koko to drop Taunt for Iron Defense, beating more physical threats such as Rillaboom and Avalugg.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>The Speed EVs on this set are for neutral-natured Choice Scarf Dracozolt and Dracovish. The HP investment ensures overall bulk, and the rest of the EVs are put in Special Defense, increasing the chances of Tapu Koko surviving against Choice Specs Porygon-Z and other special attackers after an Eerie Impulse.</p> <p>The Speed and Special Defense investments are customizable depending on what matchups Tapu Koko needs to cover. One such alternate option is a spread of 248 HP / 8 SpA / 156 SpD / 96 Spe with a Timid nature, which outspeeds Pokemon with base 110 Speed, such as Latios and Archeops, and survives Choice Specs Porygon-Z’s Hyper Beam after an Eerie Impulse, with the rest of the EVs put in Special Attack to maximize the chance for Thunderbolt to 2HKO Porygon-Z.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Playing with Tapu Koko can require some informed guesses about what moves and items the foe is running. Many Pokemon, like Jirachi and Togekiss, have Choice Scarf variants that run Trick, which could lock Tapu Koko into a status move. To prevent this, you should use Thunderbolt against potential Trick Pokemon on turn 1. One major exception to this rule is the Cresselia matchup, where Tapu Koko should use Taunt first because Choice Scarf Cresselia does not usually run enough Speed EVs to be faster than Tapu Koko. Using Taunt on Cresselia also prevents non-Choice item variants from using Calm Mind. Outside of these matchups, blocking setup Pokemon such as Volcorona or Zapdos with Taunt or using Eerie Impulse or Iron Defense to live attacks from Volcanion and Rillaboom is the best first course of action.</p> "

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Fire is a very niche option that covers both Ferrothorn and Excadrill. However, it sacrifices Hidden Power Ice, drastically worsening the matchup against Gliscor. On hyper offense teams, Tapu Koko could run a dual screens set with Light Clay and Taunt that can also enable Hawlucha, but the superior dual screens setter in Grimmsnarl can do the same in conjunction with Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain support.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Opposing teams having a Ground-type can really deter Tapu Koko's progress-making by forcing a lot of mind games between Hidden Power Ice and Volt Switch. Some of the more common Ground-types in the tier like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor must be wary of being OHKOed by Hidden Power Ice, but the Ground-types that aren't weak to Ice, like Gastrodon and Excadrill, completely wall Tapu Koko.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Defensive Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and the rare Assault Vest Tangrowth resist Tapu Koko's main STAB type and are bulky enough to stomach Dazzling Gleam and Hidden Power Ice relatively easily as well. Amoonguss and Tangrowth are particularly pesky, capable of neutralizing Tapu Koko's progress with Volt Switch due to Regenerator. Although not able to switch in safely, Rillaboom can check Tapu Koko in a pinch as well, owing to its resistance to Electric-type attacks and access to strong priority. However, barring Amoonguss and Tangrowth, none of these Grass-types can maintain a positive or even neutral momentum trade against Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Walls: Blissey and Chansey sport tremendous special bulk, which allows them to hold Tapu Koko off for a while. However, they can be overwhelmed with Volt Switch in the long run quite easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon While Tapu Koko is very fast, there are still Pokemon that outspeed it, such as Mega Lopunny and Ash-Greninja. Additionally Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T, Victini, and Jirachi all outspeed it and can threaten it out with STAB moves. Priority moves from the likes of Mega Medicham, Weaville, and Ash-Greninja can threaten to knock out a previously weakened Tapu Koko as well.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Because of its stellar Speed, good offensive prowess, and access to a strong Volt Switch, Tapu Koko is one of the best offensive pivots in the tier. It has a relatively poor Special Attack stat, but its ability to summon Electric Terrain in tandem with the use of a Choice Specs makes up for that. Hidden Power Ice lets Tapu Koko hit the Ground-types that are immune to its Electric-type moves like Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon. This is incredibly important; a well-timed Hidden Power Ice will cleanly OHKO the former two Ground-types and force the latter two out, and the resulting mind games drastically improve Tapu Koko's ability to generate momentum with Volt Switch. Volt Switch lets Tapu Koko scout the opponent and gain free momentum once the opponent's Ground-type has been removed. Dazzling Gleam gives Tapu Koko a good neutral option against Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt but aren't very threatened by Hidden Power, like opposing Tapu Koko, Hydreigon, and Kyurem. Alternatively, it can run Roost to improve its longevity in more drawn-out games against Pokemon that it forces out, such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Slowbro. However, Roost forces Tapu Koko to switch out, thereby losing momentum. Grass Knot is another option that lends Tapu Koko the ability to pressure Gastrodon and Mega Swampert much harder, but it is inferior to Dazzling Gleam otherwise.</p> <p>Due to its role as a fast pivot that can generally keep up momentum well, Tapu Koko fits very well on more offensive teams, but it's a fine fit on balanced teams as well. Tapu Koko pairs particularly well with teammates that can bait in Water- and Flying-types such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Corviknight, and Zapdos. Such teammates include the likes of Heatran, Ash-Greninja, Greninja, Mega Lopunny, Rillaboom, and Mega Scizor. Moreover, all of these partners bar Heatran are capable of creating pivoting cores with Tapu Koko courtesy of their access to U-turn, with Greninja and Ash-Greninja amplifying progress made through pivoting with Spikes as well. Water-, Grass-, and Ice-types such as Ash-Greninja, Kartana, Rillaboom, and Kyurem can easily pressure most of the metagame's Ground-types, including the ones that are particularly annoying for Tapu Koko such as Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Excadrill. On the other hand, Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran take advantage of Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss, which can otherwise keep Tapu Koko at bay for extended amounts of time. Due to Tapu Koko's tendency to force plenty of switches and rack up damage with Volt Switch, good entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and the aforementioned Heatran, Greninja, and Ash-Greninja make for good teammates that can greatly speed up the rate at which Tapu Koko can break teams down. Tapu Koko also likes having strong physical wallbreakers on its side to deal with the more specially defensive Pokemon that check it such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Gastrodon. Pokemon like Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Hawlucha make for great teammates to pressure these special walls, with the latter two also having great synergy with Electric Terrain. Lastly, as Tapu Koko is quite frail and prone to revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and Ash-Greninja as a result, it appreciates a defensive backbone that can sponge up hits from these threats. On bulky offense teams, Pokemon such as bulky Landorus-T, Slowbro, Corviknight, and Blissey can provide said backbone while also maintaining momentum with their pivoting moves. On balanced teams, the likes of Toxapex, Clefable, and Corviknight can fulfill the same objective.</p> "

Thunderbolt is amplified thanks to Electric Terrain. Dazzling Gleam helps deal with troublesome Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-type Pokemon such as unboosted Mega Altaria, Mega Gallade, and Zarude. Hidden Power Ice deals with troublesome Ground-types like Landorus and Gliscor, which freely switch in against Electric-type attacks. Volt Switch allows Tapu Koko to act as a great offensive pivot to maintain offensive pressure while to bring teammates safely into the field. Grass Knot can be used to better deal with Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert, which otherwise freely switch in against Tapu Koko. 4 Defense EVs ensure Tapu Koko always survives an Earthquake from Gliscor at full HP. Maximum Special Attack investment along with Choice Specs makes Tapu Koko a reliable wallbreaker, while maximum Speed along with a Timid nature ensures it outspeeds Pokemon like Weavile and Cinderace.</p> <p>Zapdos is a great teammate for Tapu Koko, as it provides a much needed Ground immunity and Defog support while also dealing with physical threats like Mega Scizor, Rillaboom, and Tapu Bulu. Defog helps Tapu Koko pivot freely, but Choice Specs Zapdos can also be a great teammate, as it comfortably deals with bulky Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Cradily. Rotom-W provides a secondary Ground immunity with Levitate, can deal with Ground-types like Hippowdon and Mamoswine thanks to Hydro Pump, provides a switch-in against Fire- and Water-types like Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Mega Swampert, and cripples physical attackers like Mega Swampert thanks to Will-O-Wisp. Alolan Raichu easily benefits the most from Electric Terrain set up by Tapu Koko while also using it to revenge kill faster threats like Sand Rush Excadrill, Choice Scarf Greninja, and Mega Aerodactyl, which Tapu Koko fails to deal with. Alolan Raichu's Psychic can beat troublesome Poison-types like Mega Venusaur, while Focus Blast can get rid of troublesome walls like Ferrothorn, for Tapu Koko and Grass Knot can cover for Tapu Koko not running a move. Tapu Koko in return deals with troublesome Dark- and Dragon-types like Krookodile and Mega Latias. Zeraora is the best available physical attacker for Electric-type teams and can help greatly in the Normal-, Ghost-, and Dragon-type matchups thanks to Close Combat, Knock Off, and Play Rough, respectively, while also dealing with walls in Blissey and Ferrothorn that Tapu Koko falls short against. Choice Specs Regieleki pairs well as a monstrous wallbreaker with Rising Voltage when paired with Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain, being able to 2HKO major threats to Tapu Koko such as Mega Venusaur and Blissey and providing a secondary hazard control thanks to Rapid Spin. Magnezone is able to trap and deal with Steel-types that Tapu Koko fails to do anything significant against, such as Excadrill and Ferrothorn, and act as a reliable switch-in to Poison-type attacks directed at Tapu Koko. Similar to Magnezone, Alolan Golem is capable of trapping and dealing with the aforementioned troublesome Steel-types while also being able to provide Stealth Rock support.</p> "

Psychic Terrain boosts the power of Psychic-type STAB moves, especially teammates' Expanding Force, while invalidating priority moves like Sucker Punch, Shadow Sneak, and Aqua Jet from users such as Bisharp, Aegislash, Mimikyu, and Azumarill. This greatly benefits Tapu Lele's faster teammates and lets it beat Azumarill. Tapu Lele has a few great coverage options to deal with its typical checks, such as Thunderbolt for Celesteela and Corviknight, Focus Blast for Steel- and Dark-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Tyranitar, and Shadow Ball for Ghost-types like Aegislash. However, even with Psychic Terrain's protection, Tapu Lele's average Speed tier leaves it vulnerable to being revenge killed by numerous naturally faster Pokemon such as Zeraora, Volcarona, Gengar, and Nihilego that it would desire to outspeed. Tapu Lele's poor physical bulk also makes it difficult for it to consistently switch into attacks and set up Psychic Terrain for its teammates.</p> <h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Tapu Lele serves as a unique wallbreaker for Fairy teams thanks to its ability Psychic Surge, which strengthens its Psychic-type moves while also blocking priority moves from foes like Scizor, Weavile, and Dragonite.

Coverage options such as Focus Blast and Thunderbolt can help Tapu Lele against Pokemon that it cannot beat normally, such as Heatran, Celesteela, and Mantine. However, its Speed tier is middling; even with a Choice Scarf, Tapu Lele is slower than other common Choice Scarf users such as Gengar, Blacephalon, and Weavile. This Speed, combined with its bad defenses, means Tapu Lele cannot reliably switch into threats and is oftentimes limited to revenge killing or accepting heavy hits.

      "overview": "<p>Tapu Bulu is a decent wallbreaker that provides defensive utility to its team with passive recovery through its Grassy Surge. Tapu Bulu has a great movepool with coverage options like Close Combat, Zen Headbutt, and Stone Edge, which break through potential checks such as Celesteela, Amoonguss, and Moltres. Its decent defensive typing allows it to check threats like Krookodile and Keldeo, though it does have to be wary of the latter crippling it with a Scald burn and hitting it with Choice Specs-boosted Air Slash or Icy Wind. While Tapu Bulu's typing has many useful resistances, it comes at the cost of having a lot of weaknesses to common attacking types. Its 4x weakness to Poison notably prevents it from being a consistent switch-in to foes like Kommo-o and Buzzwole. Tapu Bulu has a rather mediocre Speed tier that leaves it outpaced by common threats such as Chandelure and Mamoswine. The tier has an abundance of defensive checks to Tapu Bulu, such as Salamence, Amoonguss, and Aegislash, which makes it difficult for Tapu Bulu to make much progress as a wallbreaker, especially when multiple of these checks are naturally found on the same team.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Synthesis is an option over Swords Dance to check Pokemon like Keldeo and Thundurus more reliably. Choice Band is an option that gives Tapu Bulu even more power; however, it requires a lot more prediction to break through its checks like Amoonguss, and Wood Hammer recoil can wear it down quickly. A Choice Scarf set can be used to revenge kill foes like Thundurus and Noivern; however, it primarily relies on surprise factor to do so. A specially defensive Tapu Bulu set with Horn Leech / Darkest Lariat / Synthesis and either Bulk Up or Swords Dance can be used as a better switch-in to foes like Keldeo and Thundurus-T. However, this set is a huge momentum drain against foes like Amoonguss, Kommo-o, and Celesteela. An Assault Vest set improves its matchup against the aforementioned foes while retaining an offensive presence; however, it can be easily overwhelmed by special attackers such as Primarina. Dazzling Gleam can be used to KO Kommo-o and possibly break past Salamence; however, it is extremely weak and only useful for these select few matchups.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Chandelure is a relatively safe switch-in to Tapu Bulu's most spammable moves and threatens to OHKO it. Rotom-H has to be wary of taking Close Combat; however, it can threaten to OHKO with Overheat and use Tapu Bulu as a free Volt Switch or Defog opportunity. Moltres has to be wary of Stone Edge but otherwise freely switches into Tapu Bulu and threatens to burn it with Flame Body or KO it with a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Many of UU's more common Steel-types like Celesteela and Jirachi only take neutral damage from Close Combat and threaten to KO Tapu Bulu. Aegislash can comfortably stomach any hit in Shield forme and OHKO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Amoonguss and Tangrowth threaten to OHKO Tapu Bulu with Sludge Bomb. They have to be wary of +2 Zen Headbutt and Megahorn, respectively, but otherwise cannot be OHKOed and heal damage with Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Salamence: Salamence is a huge issue for Tapu Bulu, as it resists the coverage it commonly carries and has Flying-type attacks, though it has to be wary of Stone Edge. Intimidate makes it much easier for Salamence to stomach any hit from Tapu Bulu.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>Horn Leech is the preferred STAB option thanks to its recovery and respectable damage. Stone Edge is crucial coverage to break past Pokemon like Chandelure, Moltres, and Salamence. Close Combat lets Tapu Bulu break through Cobalion and hit other Steel-types like Jirachi and Celesteela harder; however, dropping Stone Edge leaves it unable to punish the common Flying-types, particularly Moltres, which can fish for a burn with Flame Body. Zen Headbutt breaks through Amoonguss, Kommo-o, and Buzzwole. Megahorn can help against Tangrowth; however, its coverage isn't very useful otherwise. Darkest Lariat can be used to hit Pokemon like Jirachi, Aegislash, and Chandelure harder. Life Orb with an Adamant nature gives +2 Tapu Bulu the extra power needed to KO foes like Tangrowth and Celesteela. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Buzzwole and Timid Volcanion, though Adamant's power is generally valued more.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu fits best on offense and balance teams that appreciate its combination of utility and wallbreaking potential. Thundurus can bring Tapu Bulu in safely against foes such as Rhyperior and Seismitoad, giving it free opportunities to use Swords Dance. Thundurus can also remove foes like Moltres and wear down Kommo-o and Amoonguss into KO range of Tapu Bulu's attacks. Other wallbreakers like Conkeldurr and Nidoking can help break through defensive cores that Tapu Bulu struggles with. Keldeo appreciates Tapu Bulu being able to lure in and remove bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Tentacruel is appreciated as another Water-resistant Pokemon, as Tapu Bulu doesn't want to risk a burn from Keldeo's Scald, for example. Although Tapu Bulu is a Fairy-type, it struggles to consistently check a majority of Dragon-types, such as Salamence and Kommo-o, due to its lack of a good Fairy-type attack and its weakness to their common coverage. For this reason, partners like Celesteela and Aegislash are imperative.</p> "

Its strong defensive typing lets it check Landorus-T, Urshifu-R, and Zeraora. Grassy Terrain provides it with some form of longevity and mitigates Life Orb’s recoil; furthermore, many teammates appreciate the passive recovery and weakening of Earthquake. However, Tapu Bulu often struggles to compete with Rillaboom for a team slot, as it offers priority in Grassy Glide and can support its teammates with Knock Off and U-turn. Tapu Bulu's middling Speed tier also gives it issues when setting up against offensive teams and lets many faster threats force it out.</p> ",

It can run a bulky set with maximum HP investment, some defensive investment, and a moveset of Swords Dance / Horn Leech / Close Combat / Synthesis, which allows for a sturdy offensive check to the likes Urshifu-R, Garchomp, Zeraora, and Tapu Koko.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Though Corviknight, Skarmory, and Tangrowth don't like directly switching into Tapu Bulu, they are good checks even when Tapu Bulu is boosted. Corviknight can pressure Tapu Bulu with Brave Bird, while Skarmory can phaze it with Whirlwind. Tangrowth can weaken it with Knock Off and chip it down with Rocky Helmet. However, they can easily be overloaded due to Tapu Bulu’s high Base Power coverage and boosted strength. Buzzwole is a big roadblock for Tapu Bulu, able to take any hits after a boost and force it out with Ice Punch or recover with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats: Tapu Bulu's Speed tier leaves it vulnerable to faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Volcarona, Kartana, and Weavile, which can force it out.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Stealth Rock and Spikes constantly chip down Tapu Bulu, and its lack of reliable recovery outside of bulky sets makes it get worn down easily. U-turn from Pokemon it otherwise beats such as Landorus-T and Urshifu-R can cause further chip damage, leaving it prone to being overwhelmed in trying to check them.

          "description": "<p>Horn Leech is Tapu Bulu's most effective STAB move, as its recovery offsets Life Orb recoil and is very strong under Grassy Terrain. Close Combat allows Tapu Bulu to hit Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Stone Edge is great coverage to hit Pokemon that resist its other moves like Zapdos, defensive Dragonite, and Mandibuzz. Life Orb guarantees OHKOs at +2 on Mandibuzz and defensive Dragonite when Multiscale is inactive. Leftovers is an alternative over Life Orb, as it stacks with Grassy Terrain for better longevity, though the reduced damage is very noticeable. Jolly is the preferred nature to allow it to be faster than defensive Zapdos and neutral nature Rillaboom, but Adamant is also an option for more damage output. An EV spread of 32 HP / 252 Atk / 224 Spe can be used along with an Adamant nature, which makes Tapu Bulu faster than positive nature Aegislash and Magnezone, while the HP gives it an extra point of recovery while Grassy Terrain is up.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu best fits on offense and bulky offense teams in need of a strong wallbreaker that can offensively check the likes of Landorus-T, Zeraora, and Urshifu-R. Heatran takes on Volcarona and Corviknight while also setting Stealth Rock. In return, Tapu Bulu checks Water-types such as Urshifu-R and Slowking while providing Terrain support. Volcarona, Heatran, and Tornadus-T can threaten Tapu Bulu, so switch-ins for them such as Slowking and defensive Dragonite can cover for it while alleviating its pressure to check Urshifu-R. The former is also able to handle faster wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele and Tornadus-T, while the latter is able to provide Tapu Bulu Heal Bell support. Tapu Koko is able to lure in targets that Tapu Bulu takes advantage of like Ferrothorn and Hippowdon and bring it in with U-turn out while providing a great check to Tornadus-T. Magnezone can remove Corviknight and Skarmory so Tapu Bulu doesn't have to force its way past them, and it benefits from Grassy Terrain decreasing the damage of Earthquake. Kartana is a great partner alongside Tapu Bulu, overwhelming teams once Tapu Bulu removes Flying-types like Zapdos, defensive Dragonite, and Mandibuzz with its powerful coverage. Grassy Terrain also complements its Leaf Blade.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance allows Tapu Bulu to wallbreak efficiently. Protect allows Tapu Bulu to scout for Choice-locked foes such as Excadrill and Gengar, as well as granting it a turn of extra recovery. Substitute can be used as an alternative over Protect to take advantage of weak specially offensive Pokemon that cannot break it such as Slowbro, Toxapex, and Rotom-W. Horn Leech is Tapu Bulu's main STAB attack, and Grassy Terrain not only provides a boost to Horn Leech but also passive recovery, which, when combined with the recovery from Horn Leech, lets it stay healthy throughout the game. High Horsepower is a handy coverage option that hits Steel-types such as Aegislash, Heatran, and Jirachi, as well as Toxapex. Grassy Terrain provides passive recovery to teammates such as Azumarill, Klefki, and Galarian Weezing while also cutting Earthquake damage from foes like Garchomp and Swampert. 92 Speed EVs are used to be faster than Rotom-W without Speed investment, and the rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and Special Defense to make Tapu Bulu as bulky as possible in order to take on problematic threats for Fairy teams, most notably Regieleki and Tapu Koko with the help of the Terrain change. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Tapu Bulu healthy by preventing entry hazard chip damage and stops Sticky Web from worsening its already mediocre Speed.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu is used best as a wallbreaker to weaken the opposing team, especially defensive threats such as Toxapex, Blissey, Porygon2, and Rotom-W, for teammates like Tapu Lele and Azumarill to clean later on. In order to do that, it is essential for Tapu Bulu to seek setup opportunities with Swords Dance against foes that cannot dish out a big amount of damage such as Rotom-W, Swampert, Hippowdon, and Garchomp lacking Fire Blast. Azumarill can repay Tapu Bulu for wallbreaking by taking care of Fire- and Steel-types such as Volcarona, Cinderace, Heatran, and Aegislash, while Tapu Lele in return helps with Poison-types such as Toxapex and Tapu Bulu additionally takes care of Ground- and Water-types for both. Klefki is a premier teammate for Tapu Bulu; having access to Spikes allows Tapu Bulu to break more easily, Reflect and Light Screen provide safer setup opportunities and Thunder Wave can make up for Tapu Bulu's mediocre Speed. Furthermore, Klefki covers up Tapu Bulu's main weaknesses in Poison, Flying, and Ice. Clefable provides Stealth Rock to chip down foes with residual damage and allow Tapu Bulu to have an easier time while breaking. Moreover, Clefable can absorb status for Tapu Bulu through Magic Guard. Galarian Weezing provides utility in Will-O-Wisp and Toxic Spikes, which cripple foes to allow Tapu Bulu to set up even more safely. Moreover, Galarian Weezing is excellent in a mirror matchup and against Grass-type teams, and its ability Neutralizing Gas can be helpful against Regenerator users such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Galarian Slowking. In exchange, Tapu Bulu can take on Ground-type attacks for Galarian Weezing. Other wallbreakers such as Togekiss and Mimikyu reduce the workload of Tapu Bulu in several matchups that it cannot properly function in; the former is good against Grass-type Pokemon, while the latter is good against Psychic- and Ghost-types. Tapu Koko can be used to beat Flying-types that would otherwise take advantage of Tapu Bulu such as Corviknight, Celesteela, and Moltres.</p> "

Choice Scarf allows Tapu Fini to outspeed a vast majority of the metagame with the exception of Regieleki and to often perform a useful role for the team. This may include dealing a good amount of damage to faster, but weaker Pokemon such as Cinderace, using Trick to lock the opponents into a single move, or using Soak to support team members such as Zapdos and Rillaboom and often help them take a KO. Choice Specs is used on fully offensive Tapu Fini, and its damage can be devastating to unprepared teams. These both, however, come at the risk of locking Tapu Fini into a single move for extended periods of time unless it switches, which often detracts from the versatility it usually provides.</p> ",

Additionally, its typing and a phenomenal ability in Shadow Shield can allow it to be an emergency check to the likes of Dragon Dance Ultra Necrozma, Necrozma-DM, Mega Rayquaza, and Zygarde-C. Moongeist Beam has few resistances and therefore hits most Pokemon for a 2HKO, including most support Arceus formes. Focus Blast perfectly complements Moongeist Beam by severely crippling, if not outright OHKOing, Dark- and Normal-types such as Tyranitar, Arceus-Dark, and Arceus while also hitting Ferrothorn harder than Moongeist Beam. Ice Beam KOs Yveltal after Stealth Rock damage, OHKOs an untransformed Zygarde-C, and revenge kills a boosted Mega Rayquaza in a pinch after a Dragon Ascent Special Defense drop, if Shadow Shield is intact. Alternatively, Moonblast still hits the same benchmarks against Yveltal and Mega Rayquaza while also providing Lunala with a more reliable way to hit Dark-types than Focus Blast. Trick is the preferred option in the last moveslot, as it cripples Ho-Oh and Chansey beyond repair, one of which will often be the main Lunala counterplay on the foe's team. However, Trick is completely negated by common Pokemon such as Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Zacian-C, and Mega Evolutions bar Mega Rayquaza, so it should be used with care. Alternatively, Psyshock hits specially defensive Ho-Oh and Chansey harder than anything else. It also delivers a more reliable hit against Normal-types than Focus Blast and picks off a weakened boosted Xerneas, provided that Shadow Shield is intact. On the other hand, Thunder may be used in order to OHKO Yveltal on the switch in and hit physically defensive Ho-Oh, Arceus-Water, and Primal Kyogre harder than anything else. A Modest nature allows Lunala to always 2HKO support Arceus formes, 2HKO Ferrothorn with Moongeist Beam after Stealth Rock damage, and OHKO Yveltal with Thunder, Tyranitar with Focus Blast, and Necrozma-DM with Moongeist Beam after Stealth Rock. A Timid nature may be used in order to outspeed neutral-natured Yveltal and Xerneas, as well as Timid Kyogre. However, Timid Lunala misses out on the aforementioned benchmarks.</p> <p>Lunala fits best on bulky offense teams that enjoy its wallbreaking prowess as well as its ability to situationally revenge kill a plethora of setup sweepers in a pinch, such as Xerneas, Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza, Necrozma-DM, Ultra Necrozma, various Swords Dance Arceus forms, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Zekrom. However, it can only perform such revenge kills if its Shadow Shield is unbroken, which makes Defog support from Ho-Oh or a support Arceus forme mandatory. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon is handy as well, ensuring an OHKO on the likes of Yveltal and Mega Tyranitar and helping Timid Lunala hit important benchmarks that it would otherwise miss. As Lunala is a fairly prediction-reliant wallbreaker, it may situationally give dangerous Pokemon such as Yveltal, Zacian-C, and Primal Kyogre a free switch in, depending on the move it locks itself into. Thus, pairing it with a strong defensive backbone that can check these threats via the likes of Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Primal Groudon is a sensible choice. Sturdy checks to Yveltal such as Chansey, Tyranitar, Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Fairy, and Diancie are particularly important because Yveltal can come in rather freely on Lunala. However, be careful with Tyranitar, as its Sand Stream can waste Shadow Shield. Strong late-game cleaners that can take advantage of Lunala's wallbreaking prowess, such as Zacian-C, Yveltal, and Xerneas, are recommended teammates as well.</p> "

Moongeist Beam is Lunala's primary attacking move, hitting Necrozma-DM, Ultra Necrozma, and Mewtwo super effectively and having good overall neutral coverage. Hex is an alternative that has more PP and deals more damage to statused foes. Will-O-Wisp allows Lunala to cripple physical attackers like Zacian-C, Necrozma-DM, and Mega Rayquaza. Toxic allows Lunala to punish Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Primal Kyogre, which could otherwise switch into it freely. Alternatively, Defog is an option to remove entry hazards, given Lunala's passable matchup against common setters like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Roar allows Lunala to phaze setup sweepers like Xerneas in a pinch if they haven't Dynamaxed and potentially rack up damage from entry hazards. Roost is essential to maintain Lunala's longevity and reactivate Shadow Shield. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature gives Lunala the best chance of stalling Zacian-C out of Behemoth Blade PP by switching in and repeatedly using Roost, assuming said foe lacks Assurance and Crunch and is running a Jolly nature. Heavy-Duty Boots negates entry hazard damage, allowing Shadow Shield to stay intact without mandating additional Defog support from teammates.</p> <p>Lunala is very vulnerable to status from the likes of Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes, so status absorbers such as defensive Zygarde-C, Eternatus, and Refresh Arceus forms are good teammates. Yveltal is also very troublesome for Lunala, so Ho-Oh, Xerneas, Tyranitar, and Chansey are good partners, since they can pivot into it or Dynamax in order to revenge kill it; Chansey can also provide cleric support. Knock Off absorbers such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre and, if Lunala is running Defog, checks to Xerneas such as Necrozma-DM are also very helpful teammates. Pokemon that are vulnerable to Zacian-C such as Eternatus and Mega Rayquaza really appreciate Lunala's ability to soft check it. Backup checks to Zacian-C like Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Ditto are suggested, as it can potentially break past Lunala with Assurance, Crunch, an Adamant nature, or high damage rolls.</p> "

Meteor Beam boosts its Special Attack while dealing heavy damage to checks like Celesteela. Its unique Speed tier puts it ahead of Salamence, Thundurus-T, and Moltres, and after a Speed boost from Beast Boost, it only falls behind Choice Scarf Zarude and Choice Scarf Mienshao. It has important resistances like Flying, Fairy, and Fire; its Flying resistance and high Special Defense in particular are appreciated by teams that struggle with Flying-types like Thundurus-T and Galarian Moltres. Similarly, Nihilego is an amazing Stealth Rock setter, as its resistances give very good matchups against Defoggers such as Salamence, Moltres, and Rotom-H. Its Knock Off is useful for common switch-ins like Rhyperior, Aegislash, and Celesteela. However, its weaknesses and horrid Defense stat leave it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Nidoking, Jirachi, and Keldeo, and priority from the likes of Conkeldurr, Azumarill, and Crawdaunt easily shuts down its sweeps. It lacks room for coverage for Pokemon like Nidoking, and it just cannot get past checks like Jirachi and Aegislash.</p> ",

A Choice Scarf set with Power Gem / Sludge Wave / Thunderbolt / Grass Knot lets Nihilego clean through teams and revenge kill Pokemon like Keldeo and other Choice Scarf users like Krookodile, but Choice-locked Nihilego is vulnerable to Pokemon like Aegislash and Azumarill. Pain Split can be considered as a form of recovery on the utility set, but it is very unreliable due to Nihilego's high HP and can only be used against special attackers that can't hurt it much. Dazzling Gleam OHKOes Kommo-o and maintains coverage for Krookodile but has no use outside of that. Psychic hits Kommo-o, opposing Nihilego, and Nidoking, but just like Dazzling Gleam, it is not worth running most times. A Passho Berry lets Nihilego pivot into Choice Specs Primarina and Kingdra under rain once but has no use outside of that.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey is Nihilego's best answer, capable of wearing it down with Seismic Toss and healing itself with Soft-Boiled. As long as Chansey doesn't let it accumulate several boosts, it can always beat Nihilego. Chansey hates having its Eviolite removed, though.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Krookodile, Nidoking, Seismitoad, and Rhyperior don't care about Nihilego's STAB moves and can force it out of the field with their STAB Ground-type moves, but they have to be wary of Grass Knot and get crippled by Knock Off. Zygarde-10% outspeeds Nihilego and can OHKO it with Thousand Arrows.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Jirachi walls Nihilego easily and can scare it out with Iron Head and Thunder Wave.

Though somewhat inconsistent, Triple Axel gives Pheromosa a 120 Base Power STAB move that complements its secondary STAB attack in Close Combat. Triple Axel targets Flying and Ground typings on foes such as Mew, Salamence, and Tornadus-T, while Close Combat covers the Ice-resistant Pokemon like Heatran and Melmetal. U-turn allows Pheromosa to pivot out on physically bulky switch-ins like Water / Fairy Mew and Water / Ghost Slowbro and bring in a check. Poison Jab as coverage hits checks such as Water / Fairy Mew, Fire / Fairy Clefable, and others that resist its STAB moves, potentially poisoning them. Drill Run is another option that specifically hits Water / Poison types like Garchomp and Toxapex. Rapid Spin is a final option for entry hazard removal in a pinch, but Pheromosa is much too frail to be a reliable entry hazard remover. Life Orb gives Pheromosa a nice increase in power without a Choice lock, but it greatly reduces its longevity alongside potential damage from opposing Rocky Helmet users. Therefore, Protective Pads is an option to ignore Rocky Helmet damage from common users such as Steel / Flying Mew and Salamence or Water-type Slowbro hoping to heavily punish Triple Axel. Choice Band is a final item option to boost Pheromosa's power at the cost of risking momentum loss. A Jolly nature and maximum Speed EVs are needed to outspeed Dragapult.</p> <p>Pheromosa pairs well with bulky setup sweepers like Clefable and Magearna, as it can eliminate the Ground- and Steel-types that normally check them. In return, these setup sweepers can pressure the physically bulky foes hoping to check Pheromosa. Pheromosa is incredibly frail and prone to revenge killing via priority attacks, so teammates with Intimidate such as Landorus-T and Salamence can check Rillaboom and Extreme Speed users and wear them down with Rocky Helmet damage. Pheromosa is also outsped by Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T, Porygon-Z, and Victini, so priority options like Extreme Speed from Arcanine and Entei or Grassy Glide Rillaboom can keep pressure on them. Rillaboom also threatens Pheromosa's bulky Water-type checks like Mew, Slowbro, and Toxapex. Pivots with entry hazard control like Mew and Tornadus-T can help Pheromosa stay healthy by clearing the field of entry hazards and bringing it in safely. Rapid Spin Pheromosa fits well on offensive teams that stack Spikes from setters like Mew, as it clears entry hazards only on your side of the field.</p> "

    "ru": {
      "overview": "<p>Of RU's three best Electric-types, Xurkitree, Raikou, and Toxtricity, Xurkitree is commonly considered the most restrictive and consistently dangerous for one simple reason: Grass-type coverage. Its Heavy-Duty Boots set singlehandedly makes Seismitoad and Gastrodon, strong Raikou answers, insufficient for covering the metagame's Electric-types, and other Ground-types like Steelix and Flygon shaky at best. With Ground-types so hesitant to face Xurkitree, it's free to use Volt Switch on switch-ins like Grass-types and special walls, which are rife with weaknesses for teammates to exploit. It's at its strongest against bulkier cores, which often use slower, exploitable Pokemon like Togekiss and Water-types and which struggle to pressure it with passive damage thanks to its Heavy-Duty Boots. While its Speed and bulk aren't great against offensive teams, it can usually find at least one opportunity to threaten them as well, either by forcing a switch or taking a hit. Should its team call for it, it can use Choice Scarf for greater use against offense and potentially cleaning up with Beast Boost at the expense of threatening defensive cores. What generally holds Xurkitree back is its aforementioned bulk and Speed; it can't switch into many direct attacks, and it often has very little breathing room against offense, areas where Raikou beats it out. Its Choice Scarf set suffers from prediction reliance against Ground-types and failing to outspeed other Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Flygon as well as sweepers like Slush Rush Arctozolt, limiting its ability to revenge kill and clean up. If you're looking for raw attacking power, you might prefer Toxtricity, whose Boomburst is easier to spam and much stronger than any of Xurkitree's individual attacks.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Endure + Salac Berry has merit on Sticky Web teams, giving Xurkitree the simultaneous benefits of heightened Speed and attack freedom while blocking First Impression and outpacing Choice Scarf users not named Flygon. If you build around Indeedee-M, its Psychic Surge lets Xurkitree run Nature Power to OHKO Roserade and Vileplume.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Roserade, Celebi, Vileplume, and Dhelmise are popular alongside Ground-types to minimize the damage Xurkitree can do, given their Electric resistance and neutrality-at-worst to its coverage. They're vulnerable to Volt Switch, though, so Xurkitree's team will often stay at an advantage, and Vileplume's and Dhelmise's lower Speed means Xurkitree doesn't even need to predict them.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Bulky Pokemon like Diancie, Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, Porygon2, and Umbreon stand up well to Xurkitree's unboosted attacks but are total Volt Switch fodder. They need Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree statused or itemless to win a battle of attrition.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Steelix's Grass neutrality makes it the best Ground-type Xurkitree switch-in, though it quickly loses to repeated Grass Knot or Energy Ball. Flygon can take Dazzling Gleam once with the right EVs. Other Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad usually switch out when Xurkitree appears in fear of Grass-type moves but can punish overeager uses of Volt Switch. Any Ground-type is a serious problem for Choice Scarf Xurkitree, creating a cost for locking into Electric-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: With resistance to Electric and neutrality to Grass and Fairy, other Electric-types like Raikou, Toxtricity, and Xurkitree itself make for decent early-game switch-ins to Xurkitree. Only Toxtricity threatens much damage back, however, and none of them are eager to keep losing HP.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority: Offensive teams featuring a lot of fast Pokemon give Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree few easy entry points and seldom lose more than one Pokemon to it. Faster Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Heracross can revenge kill weakened Choice Scarf Xurkitree. The same goes for strong priority from the likes of Golisopod and Durant.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Marowak: Lighting Rod Alolan Marowak is unique in that it's immune to Electric and resistant to both Grass and Fairy, making it a major early-game obstacle to Xurkitree, but it's uncommon, very flawed, and fairly easy to wear down.</p> ",

Dazzling Gleam covers Virizion and Dragon-types, most notably Flygon.</p> <p>Pivot Xurkitree is pretty good at its job by default, so it usually gets put on a proactive team later in the building process to support others and pressure Togekiss. Steel-, Flying-, and Fire-types such as Metagross, Noivern, and Salazzle like having Xurkitree use Volt Switch as Grass-types like Roserade and Celebi switch in, and Fighting- and Ground-types like Mienshao and Flygon can take advantage of special walls such as Porygon2 and Registeel.

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Celesteela's typing and defensive stats are both fantastic, allowing it to check a considerable portion of UU's top threats, including Salamence, Jirachi, Nihilego, and Zarude. Thanks to its decent offensive stats, powerful STAB Heavy Slam, and access to Flamethrower to smack foes like Aegislash and Zarude, Celesteela can prevent itself from being too passive. Leech Seed is also an excellent tool, sustaining Celesteela's longevity and allowing it to significantly wear down its switch-ins, such as Rotom-H and Thundurus-T, potentially forcing them out. Autotomize sets are also a strong option, tapping into Celesteela's strong special coverage and the sweeping potential Beast Boost lends it. Despite its defensive potency, however, Celesteela suffers a bit from its lack of access to reliable recovery, which can prevent it from tanking strong neutral hits as consistently as it would like to and cause it to be overreliant on Leftovers. This can allow a few common Pokemon, such as Keldeo, Mienshao, and Mamoswine, to muscle past Celesteela after relatively minimal chip damage. Celesteela also struggles to bypass popular Fire- and Electric-types such as Moltres and Rotom-W on its own, as well as various defensive picks like Tentacruel and Gastrodon; Tentacruel can utilize Liquid Ooze to take advantage of Leech Seed, while Gastrodon doesn't take meaningful damage from any of Celesteela's attacks, can restore any damage it sustains with Recover, and can threaten to chip Celesteela down with burns from Scald.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Celesteela's physical movepool contains solid options like Earthquake and Stone Edge, which allow it to run a physically based Autotomize set, effectively luring checks like Tentacruel and Rotom-H. However, this generally isn't as effective due to Celesteela's middling immediate power and hardships breaking various Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Intimidate Krookodile. Earthquake is an option in the fourth slot of the defensive set to still hit Steel-types super effectively while also hitting the likes of Tentacruel and Raikou hard. However, Flamethrower is usually way more valuable for its ability to pressure Zarude while still hitting Steel-types. Toxic cripples some of Celesteela's switch-ins on the defensive set, but it generally isn't as useful as its other options, and, due to foregoing Flamethrower, it notably prevents Celesteela from doing anything to Steel-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types like Moltres, Volcanion, Rotom-H, and Chandelure can pivot in on both Heavy Slam and Flamethrower and hit Celesteela hard with super effective STAB moves. They can also blanket check Celesteela's Autotomize set if it opts for Flash Cannon, though Meteor Beam can power through them. Moltres is particularly annoying, often being able to restore any chip damage it sustains from Leech Seed with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Raikou can tank hits from either of Celesteela's sets and proceed to break past it with super effective STAB attacks, though they all take fair damage from Meteor Beam. Raikou can be particularly troublesome to the defensive set, whittling Celesteela's PP with Pressure and utilizing Substitute and Calm Mind to safely set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Chansey doesn't take major damage from Celesteela's attacks and can whittle it down with Seismic Toss or bring in a teammate with Teleport. Gastrodon can tank hits from any set and heal off chip damage from Leech Seed with Recover, additionally utilizing Scald to potentially burn Celesteela. Tentacruel's Liquid Ooze punishes Leech Seed attempts and it doesn't take major damage from any attack Celesteela commonly runs. If it is running Haze, it can also stint the Autotomize set's progress.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Celesteela's defensive set becomes far easier to wear down if Leftovers, its most reliable means of passive recovery, has been removed. Knock Off users like Mamoswine, Krookodile, and Nihilego can wear it down immensely as it tries potentially pivoting in on them. The Autotomize set is also often reliant on whichever item it is running to pose a significant offensive threat, which can prevent Celesteela from setting up on foes like Nihilego and Tangrowth as safely as it would like to at times.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Celesteela's lack of reliable recovery allows particularly powerful wallbreakers, including Primarina, Mamoswine, Choice Band Buzzwole, and Aegislash, to quickly overwhelm it.</p> ",

It also prevents Pokemon like Gyarados and Dragon Dance Salamence from reliably setting up on Celesteela, chipping them down. Protect works well alongside Leech Seed, offering Celesteela a guaranteed opportunity to restore health with both Leftovers and Leech Seed. It can also help to scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon, like Chandelure and Primarina. Flamethrower hits Steel-types like Aegislash and Jirachi, preventing them from reliably setting up on Celesteela, while also hitting Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Zarude, which are immune to Leech Seed.</p> <p>Celesteela is a solid fit on balance teams thanks to its ability to check several prominent threats, allowing offensive teammates to fall back on it upon losing momentum to foes like Salamence and Noivern. Bulky Water-types often share strong synergy with Celesteela, checking the Fire-types that power through it, while Celesteela can handle Pokemon like Zarude and Tapu Bulu in return. Seismitoad and Gastrodon check both Rotom-H and Rotom-W, two of Celesteela's more effective answers, while applying pressure to Moltres with STAB Scald. Rhyperior is another good teammate, pivoting in on Fire- and Electric-type attacks for Celesteela while appreciating its ability to switch into Grass- and Ground-type moves. Defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss can also make solid teammates. Tangrowth is capable of pivoting in on several Pokemon for Celesteela, including Keldeo and Azumarill, while also utilizing Knock Off to wear down switch-ins like Moltres that can burden Celesteela. Amoonguss also checks the former two Pokemon and can match up well against Tapu Bulu. Both Pokemon can also pivot into mixed Thundurus and Krookodile, absorbing Knock Off for Celesteela throughout the match. Psychic-types like Reuniclus and Starmie are decent partners, handling Tentacruel and easing Celesteela's matchup against foes like Kommo-o and Nidoqueen.</p> "

          "name": "Autotomize",
          "description": "<p>Autotomize allows Celesteela to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and more easily snowball. It can find setup opportunities against a solid amount of common Pokemon that its defensive set forces out, including Zarude, Hatterene, and Nihilego. Fire Blast provides important coverage against Steel-types like Aegislash and Jirachi. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for its greater accuracy. However, Celesteela wants all the power it can get due to this set's nature as a sweeper. Meteor Beam grants Celesteela an opportunity to bypass Fire-types like Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure. It also deals massive damage to foes like Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Salamence, and the Special Attack boost it supplies is often extremely useful in boosting Celesteela's sweeping capabilities. Due to taking two turns, however, it must be used with Power Herb, and Celesteela must watch out for the opponent predicting the attack and bringing in a foe that resists it due to often being restricted to a one-time use. Flash Cannon is also an option in the fourth slot, offering more overall consistency and giving Celesteela a strong secondary STAB attack that deals decent neutral damage and hits Pokemon like Hatterene and Rhyperior super effectively. It does prevent Celesteela from luring some of its checks, however. Giga Drain is an option to bypass Quagsire, Rhyperior, and Rotom-W, which can otherwise tank various hits, though it generally doesn't provide too valuable of coverage otherwise. Beast Boost lets Celesteela boost its Special Attack upon netting KOs, giving it great sweeping potential. If Meteor Beam is not being run, Celesteela has no need for Power Herb and can then run Weakness Policy. This allows it to use its solid bulk to tank super effective hits, such as Fire-type moves from Salamence or opposing Celesteela, to gain a +2 boost in power, which heavily increases its threat level. This is particularly potent when Celesteela is behind dual screens, as often the only way to break past it at that rate is with super effective moves.</p> <p>This set fits on offensive builds, acting as a late-game sweeper that cleans weakened teams. Hyper offense teams do particularly well supporting Celesteela, sometimes employing dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Alolan Ninetales to increase its odds of reliably setting up. Entry hazards let Celesteela muscle past foes more easily, making setters like Krookodile good options for teammates. On hyper offense teams, leads like Azelf and Froslass work well for their ability to quickly set Spikes and keep up momentum with moves like Explosion and Destiny Bond, respectively. Powerful wallbreakers like Mienshao and Obstagoon make strong teammates, weakening teams for Celesteela to sweep through late-game. Depending on the coverage it opts for, Celesteela will struggle to reliably break past various Pokemon. If it isn't running Meteor Beam, checks to Fire-types are important due to most being able to tank Air Slash and revenge kill Celesteela. Keldeo can outspeed and pressure Rotom-H and Moltres, while Rhyperior can pivot in on both. Without Flash Cannon, Celesteela can't hit Rock-types like Rhyperior and Nihilego super effectively. Pokemon like Keldeo and Zygarde-10% can pressure said Rock-types, making them solid partners. Electric-type checks are important due to Celesteela's iffy matchups against most in the tier. Zarude can pivot in on Rotom-W and make decent progress with its pivoting capabilities. Seismitoad can handle Raikou, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H while tanking hits from and crippling Thundurus. Additionally, it offers utility with Stealth Rock and Knock Off. Lastly, sweepers like Thundurus-T and Azumarill often fit well with offensive Celesteela variants, helping pressure the likes of Rotom-H and Milotic.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Kartana is one of the best and most threatening wallbreakers in OU because of its monstrous Attack stat, good coverage options, and exceptional Speed tier among wallbreakers, which makes it difficult to revenge kill. Swords Dance or Choice Band lets it bust through its most common checks in Corviknight, Skarmory, and Zapdos. It can also be a good revenge killer and late-game wincon when utilizing a Choice Scarf and its ability Beast Boost. This lets it outspeed almost everything in the metagame and subsequently snowball for extremely easy sweeps. Knock Off lets it cripple common Flying- and Fire-type switch-ins, like Zapdos and Volcarona, by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Kartana is extremely effective at wallbreaking for other Pokemon that it shares Flying- or Grass-type checks with, including Garchomp and Rillaboom. However, it can be hindered by contact-based abilities and items like Zapdos's Static, Volcarona's Flame Body, Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, and Corviknight's Rocky Helmet. Swords Dance and Choice Band sets are commonly revenge killed by faster threats such as Dragapult and Zeraora after they're switched in safely via a defensive pivot like Mandibuzz or Corviknight. Choice Scarf sets can be easily shut down by physically defensive walls like Tangrowth, Corviknight, and Skarmory without the power boost given by Swords Dance or Choice Band. Kartana faces competition from other wallbreakers and wincons like Garchomp, Bisharp, and Rillaboom because they are more difficult to revenge kill through their use of Speed boosting or priority. Garchomp and Bisharp can also use their good defensive typings when setting up, while Kartana is limited because of its frailty.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance Kartana occasionally runs Protective Pads to bypass contact effects from the likes of Zapdos, Ferrothorn, and Rocky Helmet users like Skarmory and Corviknight at the expense of a great portion of its power without Life Orb. Some other Swords Dance Kartana, especially on hyper offense teams, also opt to act as a wincon by using a Timid nature, 19 Attack IVs, and maximum HP EVs, letting Kartana boost its Speed after a KO instead of its Attack. This prevents Kartana from being revenge killed by typical faster threats like Zeraora, Dragapult, and Tornadus-T at the expense of a huge portion of its power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types like Corviknight, Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Skarmory are able to deal with the majority of Kartana's coverage. However, they are vulnerable to being worn down over time with Knock Off and entry hazard support, and they can even lose to Swords Dance sets on the spot if weakened.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Kartana has immense difficulty breaking through Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Buzzwole, which have enough Defense to check all of its sets. However, these checks can be heavily pressured by Choice Band Kartana assisted by Future Sight because of their mediocre Special Defense. In the process of KOing Kartana, they can also get weakened to the point where they are unable to check some of Kartana's cleaning teammates, like Garchomp and Rillaboom. Physically defensive Volcarona, especially on offensive teams, can threaten Kartana with Flame Body and use it as setup fodder, but it is crippled if it switches into a Knock Off and is unable to reliably take Swords Dance- or Choice Band-boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Contact Effects: Static from Zapdos, Flame Body from Volcarona, Iron Barbs from Ferrothorn, and Rocky Helmet on Corviknight and Skarmory can make it difficult for Kartana to make progress against these Pokemon, especially for the former two.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: For Swords Dance and Choice Band sets, an aggressive double switch on a predicted Swords Dance or a sacrifice of a teammate into a faster threat like Dragapult, Zeraora, or Tornadus-T can easily force Kartana to switch or get KOed.</p> ",

Its ability to steamroll its common Flying-type checks when boosted or slowly whittle them down with Knock Off and entry hazard support makes it nearly uncheckable. Knock Off targets Flying-type switch-ins like Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T, as well as hitting Galarian Slowking and Volcarona. By removing their items, Kartana ensures that it or one of its teammates has an easier time breaking through later. Sacred Sword lets it break through Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran more easily. Sacred Sword also lets Kartana beat Iron Defense Corviknight and Skarmory by bypassing their Defense boosts. Synthesis is an alternative to ensure Kartana defeats Corviknight while healing off Life Orb recoil. It is especially valuable on bulkier teams, where Kartana can be useful even after eliminating Corviknight. However, forgoing Sacred Sword results in harder matchups against other Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed and possibly revenge kill common offensive threats like Garchomp and Hydreigon. Life Orb is especially useful when trying to break through common defensive walls like Corviknight, Zapdos, and Tangrowth.</p> <p>Swords Dance Kartana is often used on offensive teams because of its unparalleled ability to break through Corviknight, Tangrowth, and Skarmory for other cleaners like Rillaboom and Garchomp. Magnezone supports it well because it can trap Corviknight and Skarmory, enabling an easy Kartana sweep. On bulky offense teams, Heatran can set Stealth Rock to help chip common checks, including Corviknight and Tangrowth, and easily pressure Grass- and Steel-types. Cleaners like Dragonite, Weavile, and Hawlucha, alongside the aforementioned ones, can benefit from Kartana's wallbreaking ability on hyper offense teams, often with dual screens support from Tapu Koko or Regieleki.</p> "

Kartana's ability to wallbreak and remove Steel- and Flying-type answers makes partners like Garchomp and Tornadus-T thrive.

Shed Shell can specifically be used for Gothitelle, which traps Necrozma-DM and PP stalls it with Charm, Taunt, and Rest. Toxic is also a solid option on defensive Necrozma-DM's third moveslot to cripple common switch-ins to it like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Dragon Dance Zygarde-C. Running Toxic does, however, make the matchup against Swords Dance Zacian-C particularly tricky to handle.

However, Ho-Oh doesn't appreciate taking a Knock Off from Necrozma-DM, since the removal of its Heavy-Duty Boots will significantly limit its ability to switch in and remove Stealth Rock.

Dragon Dance can be used if a team already has a Stealth Rock setter, allowing Necrozma-DM to potentially set up on foes like Zacian-C and opposing Necrozma-DM before devastating and outspeeding foes like defensive Eternatus and Marshadow after a couple of boosts. Sunsteel Strike gives Necrozma-DM the means to KO Xerneas while chipping down Zacian-C. Knock Off cripples switch-ins to Necrozma-DM such as Groudon, Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Eternatus for its teammates. Thunder Wave is an option over Knock Off to cripple fast foes like Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, and Eternatus, but it makes Necrozma-DM setup fodder against Groudon due to its immunity to Thunder Wave. Necrozma-DM can also opt to run Earthquake, consistently dealing good damage to Zekrom, opposing Necrozma-DM, and Zacian-C while 2HKOing offensive Eternatus. Earthquake is particularly good alongside Dragon Dance as well, as few resist both it and Sunsteel Strike, and it turns Necrozma-DM into an obnoxiously sturdy Dynamax user between Max Steelspike boosting Defense and Max Quake boosting Special Defense. Morning Sun is essential in order to keep Necrozma-DM healthy and check the likes of Zacian-C and Xerneas without being heavily chipped. However, use Morning Sun with caution, as it has very low PP. Rocky Helmet deals residual damage to foes like Zacian-C and Zekrom. Heavy-Duty Boots is an option over Rocky Helmet to reliably switch into Zacian-C's Assurance if Stealth Rock or Spikes is on the field. Weakness Policy pairs well with Dragon Dance, as Necrozma-DM can tank super effective hits like Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire, Eternatus's Mystical Fire, and Marshadow's Shadow Sneak due to its good bulk and Prism Armor while getting a +2 Attack boost. Maximum Defense investment with an Impish nature ensures Zacian-C's Close Combat won't 2HKO Necrozma-DM at full health. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 224 Def / 32 Spe enables Necrozma-DM to outspeed Adamant Zacian-C if it's paralyzed or if Necrozma-DM has used Dragon Dance twice.</p> <p>Necrozma-DM is a staple on all balance and bulky offense teams due to its ability to check Zacian-C and Xerneas while having fantastic utility moves like Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and Thunder Wave. Unfortunately, Necrozma-DM is easily forced out and set up on by many other top-tier wallbreakers in AG such as Calyrex-S, Life Orb Yveltal, Marshadow, and Groudon. Therefore, partners that can check these threats such as Yveltal, Eternatus, Zacian-C, and Lunala, respectively, are useful. Teammates that are especially weak to Zacian-C and Xerneas like Yveltal, Zygarde-C, and Eternatus appreciate Necrozma-DM checking the two. Ferrothorn is able to act as a secondary check to Xerneas, which is useful because Xerneas can 2HKO Necrozma-DM with Thunder at +2 and force it to Dynamax, and Ferrothorn also deals with Kyogre while providing Spikes support. Defoggers like Yveltal and Ho-Oh serve a unique purpose for Necrozma-DM, as they stop Stealth Rock and Spikes from strengthening Zacian-C's Assurance on the switch.</p> "

Sporting well-rounded bulk, great typing, and useful support moves, it can be used as a semi-reliable check to Zacian-C and Xerneas. Sunsteel Strike deals hefty damage to Zacian-C and hits Xerneas super effectively. Under Dynamax, it becomes Max Steelspike, which boosts Necrozma-DM's Defense by one stage, turning it into an impenetrable physical wall that laughs at otherwise dangerous attacks such as Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades, Mega Rayquaza's V-create, and Ultra Necrozma's Earthquake. Morning Sun allows Necrozma-DM to consistently heal itself and be a reliable wall throughout the match. Stealth Rock increases Necrozma-DM's splashability even further by letting it offer additional role compression. Knock Off is excellent at reducing the effectiveness of defensive threats, such as by removing Leftovers from opposing Necrozma-DM, Zygarde-C, and Ferrothorn so that they have a harder time checking wallbreakers. Most importantly, it removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Ho-Oh, so that it becomes vulnerable to Stealth Rock. Toxic is an option over Stealth Rock or Knock Off to cripple foes such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre that would otherwise fear nothing from Necrozma-DM. However, it fails to do anything meaningful to staples such as defensive Zygarde-C and Refresh support Arceus forms. Maximum Defense investment paired improves Necrozma-DM's chances of switching into Zacian-C multiple times throughout the match. Rocky Helmet is preferred in order to punish Zacian-C's Close Combat and deter Crunch variants, while preserving Morning Sun as Zacian-C will not be able to deal sustained attacks. Leftovers improves Necrozma-DM's chances of pivoting into non-Assurance Zacian-C multiple times throughout the match and reduces the number of times it must use Morning Sun. Heavy-Duty Boots is an option that grants Necrozma-DM the ability to consistently wall Assurance Zacian-C.</p> <p>Necrozma-DM is a fantastic Pokemon that fits very easily on balance and bulky offense teams. It is the best defensive Dynamax user: indeed, it can use its doubled HP to defeat powerful setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Zacian-C, Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza, and Dragon Dance Ultra Necrozma. After +2 Xerneas has wasted a Dynamax turn, Necrozma-DM is able to beat it by Dynamaxing itself and using Max Guard once so that it is hit by one Max Flare only. With Toxic in its moveset, Necrozma-DM can also stall out Ho-Oh, for it is bulky enough and has enough Morning Sun PP to survive eight Sacred Fires, but getting burned may be unwise if it is needed to check a threat such as Zacian-C or Xerneas. Good teammates for Necrozma-DM include reliable checks to Primal Kyogre and Yveltal, since these two can OHKO it with their powerful STAB moves; thus, Primal Groudon and Xerneas make for good partners. Ho-Oh provides Necrozma-DM with Defog support for Assurance Zacian-C, as well as a backup pivot to it. It also provides a solid check to support Arceus-Ground, and a way of wasting Xerneas's and Yveltal's Dynamax turns. Tyranitar is a good teammate that can carry Stealth Rock, thus freeing up a moveslot on Necrozma-DM, and check Eternatus, most Yveltal variants, and non-Focus Blast Mega Gengar, although be careful, as Sand Stream lowers Morning Sun recovery. Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground are noteworthy teammates that can reliably wall Primal Groudon for Necrozma-DM, and, in Zygarde-C's case, Assurance Zacian-C. Ditto can take advantage of sweepers that Necrozma-DM forces to set up in order to break past it, such as Swords Dance Zacian-C and Geomancy Xerneas. Finally, Zacian-C appreciates being paired with defensive Necrozma-DM, since the latter contributes to Imposter-proofing Zacian-C by walling all of +2 Ditto's moves except Close Combat and Crunch: thus, also having Ho-Oh or defensive Zygarde-C is an excellent way of fully protecting your team against Ditto.</p> "

          "name": "Dragon Dance (Dynamax Sweeper)",
          "description": "<p>This set is a great Dynamax sweeper that can set up on a wide array of Pokemon, such as defensive Necrozma-DM, Xerneas, and Eternatus, turning super effective hits to its advantage if it's holding Weakness Policy. Dragon Dance in tandem with a Jolly nature boosts Necrozma-DM's Speed to outpace every unboosted Pokemon up to and including Mega Mewtwo Y. Sunsteel Strike is a powerful STAB move that deals good damage to everything that doesn't resist it. Earthquake provides excellent coverage alongside Sunsteel Strike because it deals great damage to Steel-resistant Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, opposing Necrozma-DM, and Primal Kyogre. It also OHKOes Zacian-C after one Dragon Dance. At +1, Stone Edge OHKOes Ho-Oh, which otherwise walls Necrozma-DM, as well as Yveltal. Rock Blast is less powerful 50% of the time, but it is more accurate and more effective against Smeargle and Vivillon, and it has the same Max Move Base Power. Morning Sun enables Necrozma-DM to set up on passive foes like Ferrothorn, but it is most useful after Dynamaxing, since Necrozma-DM's doubled HP allows it to repeatedly select Dragon Dance and Morning Sun on weaker foes and eventually sweep the rest of the opposing team. On top of sharing excellent coverage type-wise, Sunsteel Strike and Earthquake turn into Max Steelspike and Max Quake during Dynamax, which boost Necrozma-DM's Defense and Special Defense by one stage, respectively, thus rendering it extremely bulky and powerful at the same time. This is why a Weakness Policy works wonders on this set, because the only way of KOing a healthy Necrozma-DM with boosted defenses is with super effective hits. Leftovers is an option to facilitate setting up, especially when paired with Morning Sun. Morning Sun sets can run a more defensive EV spread in order to consistently switch into threats like Zacian-C and Xerneas, allocating 36 EVs to Speed in order to outspeed Modest Yveltal at +1 and Mega Gengar at +2.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM is best used on very offensive teams that can forgo its defensive potential as a wall but still appreciate its ability to soft check Zacian-C and Xerneas and use them as setup opportunities. In worst-case scenarios where Necrozma-DM can't afford to set up, it can also simply Dynamax to OHKO Zacian-C after said foe has used Close Combat and Xerneas after being hit by Max Flare, which will trigger Weakness Policy. On one hand, Necrozma-DM will usually want to Dynamax to effectively sweep teams, so keep this in mind when building a team, since having too many Dynamax-reliant Pokemon can prove to be troublesome. On the other hand, Necrozma-DM can sometimes sweep without Dynamaxing, so pairing it with another Dynamax sweeper like Xerneas might give you more flexibility in difficult match-ups for Necrozma-DM, for example against defensive Zygarde-C. If using Dynamax, Necrozma-DM is better used early-game as a wallbreaker that is able to severely dent teams and open up opportunities to clean for teammates like Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza, and Zacian-C. If you decide not to Dynamax it, Necrozma-DM should be used late-game after another Dynamax user like Yveltal or Xerneas has wrecked havoc. Good teammates include Deoxys-S for Spikes support, Smeargle for Sticky Web support, and Grimmsnarl for dual screens support. Even though Necrozma-DM is quite Imposter-proof if healthy and under Dynamax, it is prone to being revenge killed by Ditto once Dynamax is over; thus, having a teammate to Imposter-proof it can be valuable. Zygarde-C is, therefore, a noteworthy teammate, as it is able to paralyze Ditto with Glare or phaze it with Dragon Tail, and can even set up on Ditto locked into Earthquake. It also covers Necrozma-DM's Fire-type weakness and can use Primal Groudon as a setup opportunity. Having a wallbreaker to pressure defensive Zygarde-C is important, since its stellar physical bulk and access to Coil and Haze allows it to wall Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM. Also, if Necrozma-DM isn't running a Rock-type move, having a wallbreaker that beats balance teams that typically use Ho-Oh is mandatory. Thus Xerneas, Yveltal, and Primal Kyogre make for good partners, as they are able to put immense pressure on the two aforementioned walls.</p> "

Photon Geyser is a powerful STAB move that is mandatory to activate Light That Burns the Sky, a nuke that OHKOes almost everything that doesn't resist it after a boost. This extremely powerful Z-Move also makes up for Ultra Necrozma's inability to Dynamax by dealing enough damage to KO weakened Dynamaxed foes. Earthquake is the main coverage option that makes great use of Neuroforce to hit foes like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM hard. Stone Edge is used to KO Yveltal, which is immune to the other two attacking moves, and Ho-Oh without wasting Ultra Necrozma's Z-Move. Alternatively, Rock Blast allows Ultra Necrozma to check Vivillon, deal more damage to Multiscale Lugia, and potentially KO Smeargle through Focus Sash. Outrage also hits Yveltal and Ho-Oh hard at the cost of locking Ultra Necrozma into the move for one or two more turns, potentially giving free setup to Xerneas. Outrage enables Ultra Necrozma to reliably beat Zygarde-C too. Another option is Knock Off, which massively damages Psychic-resistant Pokemon such as Lunala, Lugia, and Mewtwo; however, it leaves Ultra Necrozma more vulnerable to being revenge killed by Ditto. An Adamant nature lets Ultra Necrozma usually score the OHKO on defensive untransformed Zygarde with Light That Burns The Sky after one boost, as well as Primal Groudon with Earthquake after one boost and Stealth Rock damage. A Jolly nature makes Ultra Necrozma faster than Mega Rayquaza, Arceus formes, and Marshadow prior to boosting and Choice Scarf users like Mega Rayquaza and Marshadow at +1 Speed.</p> <p>Ultra Necrozma fits best onto hyper offensive teams as one of the best non-Dynamax sweepers. Its Necrozma-DM base forme is very useful to set up on foes like Zacian-C and opposing Necrozma-DM while bluffing the Dynamax variant. Ultra Necrozma is also easy to Imposter-proof, since Ditto can't Dynamax after copying Ultra Necrozma and needs it to be in KO range of Earthquake if it lacks Outrage, while a Ditto locked into Outrage is easily taken advantage of by Fairy-types like Zacian-C and Xerneas. Dynamax sweepers and wallbreakers are fantastic partners, since they appreciate Ultra Necrozma's ability to wallbreak and clean without using Dynamax. Mewtwo's Max Mindstorm-induced Psychic Terrain boosts Photon Geyser's power to sky-high levels, whereas Xerneas and Yveltal can be sent out after Ultra Necrozma has been revenge killed by Ditto; Xerneas can revenge kill Ditto or use Geomancy if Ditto is locked into Outrage, while Yveltal can switch in on a Ditto locked into Photon Geyser or Earthquake. Partners like Zacian-C and Eternatus that attract setup bait for Ultra Necrozma such as defensive Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C are good partners. Dual screens support from Grimmsnarl also helps hyper offensive teams, which like to run Ultra Necrozma. Do note that using this Necrozma forme leaves the team extremely weak to Xerneas, so Ultra Necrozma should generally not be used outside of hyper offense.</p> "

Powerful STAB moves in Poltergeist and Close Combat give Marshadow neutral coverage against the entire metagame. Shadow Sneak revenge kills various faster Pokemon and boosted threats that have been weakened such as Calyrex-S, Swords Dance Rayquaza, and even Zacian-C. Ice Punch is used to heavily damage Zygarde-C, which can otherwise comfortably switch into Marshadow. Alternatively, Bulk Up transforms Marshadow into a formidable sweeper; Bulk Up Marshadow significantly damages walls such as Ho-Oh and specially defensive Eternatus and sets up on forced switches or certain walls, such as Necrozma-DM. Rock Tomb can also be used to OHKO Ho-Oh and lowers the foe's Speed.</p> <p>This set is able to fit on a variety of teams, since it does not fear being locked into a move. Zacian-C and Xerneas pair well with each other and appreciate a teammate like Marshadow that can defeat Necrozma-DM. This set is worn down very quickly, so bringing it in carefully, especially with slow pivoting or double switches, is vital. Hazard support such as Stealth Rock or even Toxic Spikes allows Marshadow to meet benchmarks such as KOing untransformed defensive Zygarde at +2. Wallbreakers such as Calyrex-S and Groudon can weaken Marshadow's checks to help it sweep late-game. Bulk Up Marshadow can effectively utilize Dynamax to break through targets that it couldn't otherwise, such as Zygarde-C and Eternatus. As such, offensive partners that don't rely on Dynamax maximize the team's offensive potential. The aforementioned Zacian-C pairs well due to the ability to heavily pressure each other's checks. Eternatus also fits well, as it can remove Zygarde-C, which otherwise walls Marshadow.</p> "

Shadow Sneak, boosted by Technician, lets Marshadow revenge kill faster or boosted Pokemon such as Calyrex-S, Mewtwo, weakened Zacian-C, Xerneas, and Zekrom. Ice Punch allows Marshadow to heavily dent Zygarde-C, which would otherwise wall it, and also eases prediction by providing a coverage move that can hit both Yveltal and Eternatus. Alternatively, Spectral Thief can be used to check slower sweepers such as Calm Mind Kyogre and is more reliable than Poltergeist. Technician-boosted Rock Tomb can also be useful to OHKO Ho-Oh and does hefty damage to defensive Yveltal while also having utility in lowering the foe's Speed. A Jolly nature is preferred to outpace Modest Eternatus and Speed tie with opposing Marshadow but an Adamant nature can be used to increase damage output.</p> <p>This set can be paired with Pokemon that appreciate its ability to break through walls like Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Lunala and revenge kill Pokemon such as unboosted Calyrex-S, Yveltal, Kyogre, and Palkia. Zacian-C pairs very well with this set, as it can pivot into Eternatus, Sucker Punch Yveltal, and Xerneas, and Play Rough variants can lure defensive Zygarde-C for Marshadow lacking Ice Punch. In return, Marshadow can force out and take advantage of Calyrex-S and Necrozma-DM, two of Zacian-C's common checks, and Ice Punch variants can weaken defensive Zygarde-C for Zacian-C lacking Play Rough. Xerneas can also severely punish Dark-types seeking to switch into Marshadow's Ghost-type STAB moves, using them as setup bait and threatening to sweep with Geomancy. Meanwhile, Marshadow receives opportunities to wallbreak by double switching into common Xerneas answers like Necrozma-DM, Chansey, and Ferrothorn while potentially weakening or removing Ho-Oh for Xerneas. Marshadow is rather frail and should avoid switching directly into attacks such as Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike and Yveltal's or Tyranitar's Foul Play, so try to get it in via double switches and slow pivoting. Stealth Rock support allows Marshadow to achieve KOs on Kyogre and offensive Yveltal, although it has to be wary of Sucker Punch from the latter, while Defog prevents entry hazards from wearing down Marshadow as it repeatedly switches in and out over the course of a match. Imposter-proofing Marshadow is fairly straightforward and can be done with Ho-Oh, defensive Yveltal, Zygarde, Groudon, and defensive Xerneas.</p> "

It functions primarily as a Stealth Rock user for bulky offensive and balanced teams, but it also works as an offensive Trick Room setter that can set up against common Pokemon like Noivern and Togekiss. Stakataka's main advantage over its Stealth Rock-setting competition in Metagross, Registeel, and Cobalion is its typing. Its combination of Fire neutrality and Flying, Fairy, and Psychic resistances means it checks many common threats utilizing Fire-type coverage like Gardevoir, specially offensive Necrozma, and Noivern in addition to Salazzle and Chandelure. Its quadruple Normal resistance makes it one of the tier's better ways to take Toxtricity's Boomburst as well. Unfortunately, since Stakataka's the slowest Pokemon in the tier, it's usually getting hit first and worn down easily, and it is forced to make predictions even when other defensive Pokemon are switching in.

Pokemon that can cover Zeraora's disadvantageous matchup versus Ground-types such as Slowbro, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn while providing utility in Future Sight, slow pivoting, and Spikes respectively make for great teammates. Zeraora's ability to consistently take advantage of Pokemon such as Corviknight, Slowking, and Toxapex due to their fear of being OHKOed by its STAB move makes it a great partner for Pokemon like Rillaboom, Nidoking, and Tornadus-T that generally struggle with these foes. Pokemon that appreciate Zeraora's ability to provide offensive momentum against Grass-types via Volt Switch such as Kyurem and Tapu Lele are very useful teammates, as they can heavily threaten them out. Future Sight support from Slowking and Slowbro is very beneficial, as Ground-types will be more pressured and easily worn down.</p> "

Knock Off is important for hitting Dragapult super effectively. Close Combat is great for hitting targets such as Hydreigon, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Kyurem for super effective damage, as they would otherwise resist or take very little damage from both its aforementioned moves.</p> <p>Bulk Up Zeraora mainly fits on offensive teams, as the support offensive teams provide for Zeraora such as entry hazards and pivoting can give it more setup opportunities. Dual screens Tapu Koko is a great partner for it, as not only does the dual screens and pivoting support give Zeraora more setup opportunities, but the Electric Terrain increases the power of Plasma Fists, making it harder to wall. Suicide leads such as Landorus-T and Mew are very useful partners for Zeraora, as the entry hazards they provide can allow Zeraora to apply more pressure to the opposing team. Rillaboom is an excellent partner for Bulk Up Zeraora, as Grassy Terrain halves the power of Earthquake from the likes of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon; furthermore, Rillaboom can revenge kill Excadrill in sand, while Zeraora can heavily pressure Pokemon that Rillaboom may struggle with, such as Corviknight, Dragapult, and Skarmory.</p> "

Wood Hammer is Grookey's strongest move and allows it to break through bulky foes such as Mienfoo and Vullaby. Drain Punch provides Grookey with coverage against Steel-types like Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Magnemite. Knock Off is an option to weaken checks such as Koffing, Foongus, and Ferroseed.

It is capable of forcing foes like Staryu, Onix, and Wingull out to potentially set up with Swords Dance and sweep past the opposing team. Often, it is pivotal to preserve Grookey for as long as possible, since Grassy Glide is able to revenge kill boosted setup sweepers like Scraggy and Tyrunt and clean late-game. Grassy Terrain from Grookey can also be utilized as a support tool, aiding teammates like Scraggy and Tyrunt in setting up.

Utility options like Taunt or Leech Seed instead of Swords Dance could be considered to cripple Flying-types like Golbat, although the lack of boosting can result in underwhelming damage.

Status conditions plague Thwackey, so having support to remove Toxic Spikes, like Mareanie, Koffing, and Vullaby can be useful. Hattrem is also notable for its access to Healing Wish, combating status conditions and HP lost when Thwackey sets up.

Knock Off benefits from the risen power by securing a OHKO and 2HKO on Lampent and Roselia after Stealth Rock, respectively. Wood Hammer is a nuke when boosted by Grassy Terrain, denting slower targets like Hattrem, Gabite, and Clefairy.

Alternatively, if Thwackey is paired with additional physical attackers like Klang and Piloswine, Thwackey could use Knock Off when the aforementioned walls switch in to soften them up for the team. Fire-types like Lampent and Raboot target the Grass-types that wall Thwackey, and in return, it revenge kills Wartortle, Marshtomp, and Piloswine. Thwackey works in tandem with more pivoting support from Charjabug, Clefairy, and Galarian Linoone to generate momentum and find opportunities to get in on the walls it breaks; the former two act as slow pivots to bring Thwackey in safely for revenge killing attackers like Wartortle, Flame Orb Machoke, and Kadabra. Stealth Rock support from setters like Piloswine, Galarian Corsola, and Krokorok is essential for crucial damage output against opposing Lampent, Roselia, and Mareanie, while also punishing Flying-types like Golbat and Vullaby, which comfortably switch into Thwackey's attacks.</p> "

Knock Off provides nice coverage and a means to hit Ghost-types that resist Grass like Magearna, Reuniclus, and Salamence.

Bring Scorbunny in on Grass- and Steel-types and use the pressure of its super effective STAB moves due to Libero to use U-Turn to pivot out of the opponent's switch-in to control momentum and keep exerting pressure on the opponent. High Jump Kick gives Scorbunny the ability to hit incoming Rock-types, though it does not possess the raw power to OHKO them in most cases. As a result, it's generally better to hold off on using High Jump Kick until the foe takes enough chip damage via U-turn and hazard damage. Sucker Punch is also an option if your team already has sufficient Rock-type answers elsewhere to provide Scorbunny with a way of getting off some damage against faster Pokemon such as Diglett and Galarian Ponyta. Berry Juice is the preferred item for Scorbunny, as it provides greater longevity by allowing Scorbunny to combat being worn down by hazards as it pivots in and out of the fight.</p> <p>Pokemon who appreciate Scorbunny's ability to deal with Ferroseed and Spritzee, such as Shellder or Onix synergize quite well with Scorbunny. Additionally, Pokemon that can capitalize off of the free switch in opportunities that Scorbunny provides, such as Corphish or Mudbray, are quite appealing teammates. Trappers like Diglett and Trapinch are often able to easily remove common answers to Scorbunny, such as Mareanie. Other pivots like Vullaby and Chinchou are also great options to form a nice VoltTurn core. Chinchou, in particular, can pile the pressure on Frillish and other Water-type Scorbunny switch-ins that aren't opposing Chinchou. Ferroseed and other hazard setters are great teammates, as the chip damage provided via their hazards can be crucial in wearing down and ultimately busting through opposing teams. Lastly, hazard removal from the likes of Vullaby or Staryu, for example, will allow Scorbunny to not be worn down as easily and remain a threat, thus being able to apply pressure throughout a match.</p> "

Maximum HP and Defense EVs is an alternative, although it takes considerably more damage from special attacks. Body Press OHKOes Bisharp and Weavile while also dealing decent damage to incoming Steel-types such as Heatran and Magnezone. U-turn is what makes Corviknight a great pivot, allowing it to keep momentum against Pokemon that switch in to it. Brave Bird is an alternative that hits Rillaboom, Urshifu-R, and Volcarona for super effective damage and prevents it from being setup fodder for the latter. However, teams especially weak to physical setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Garchomp and Kartana can make use of Iron Defense to completely wall those Pokemon while also making Body Press stronger. Corviknight's ability to wall most hazard setters makes it an excellent Defog user. Leftovers helps check more Pokemon in the long run thanks to the passive recovery. Rocky Helmet deals chip damage to U-turn and Knock Off spam and dissuades Urshifu-R from using Surging Strikes. Corviknight is often switching in on Knock Off from Pokemon such as Weavile, Bisharp, Rillaboom, and Kartana, so its item rarely lasts the entire match.</p> <p>Many team archetypes appreciate Corviknight as a Defogger thanks to its strong defensive presence and pivoting ability. Defensive teams greatly appreciate its longevity and ability to take Knock Off, while more offensive teams take great advantage of its pivoting. Corviknight appreciates Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon switching into Electric-type attacks from Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Zapdos that threaten it. These Pokemon also threaten Heatran, one of the few Stealth Rock setters able to beat Corviknight. Slowking, Toxapex, and Heatran switch into Fire-types that threaten Corviknight such as Heatran for the former two and Volcarona for the latter two. Slowking and Blissey also sponge special attacks from Pokemon such as Nidoking that Corviknight has trouble repeatedly taking, and they can safely pivot into it with Teleport against strong physical attackers that threaten them like Kartana, Rillaboom, and Urshifu-R. Another great teammate is Clefable, as it appreciates Corviknight's ability to take on physical attackers that threaten it like Rillaboom, Bisharp, and Kartana, while Clefable takes on Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Dragapult, and Kyurem that threaten Corviknight. It also can heal status with Aromatherapy. Strong wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Urshifu-R, Bisharp, and Dragapult appreciate Corviknight's slow pivoting with U-turn getting them in safely.</p> "

Mirror Armor prevents Corviknight from having its stats lowered by common moves such as Aegislash's and Gengar's Shadow Ball and Hatterene's and Indeedee's Mystical Fire, as it will reflect back the stat drops instead. Taunt prevents passive Pokemon such as Galarian Corsola, Ferrothorn, and Hippowdon from statusing, setting up entry hazards, and phasing, respectively. Bulk Up allows Corviknight to boost its Attack and Defense, making it exceptionally hard to beat. Power Trip is used in conjunction with Bulk Up, which simultaneously boosts its Base Power to sky-high levels, to allow Corviknight to sweep teams, most notably Ghost, Steel, and Psychic teams. Roost provides Corviknight with reliable recovery throughout the match and Leftovers provides it with a source of passive recovery. As Bulk Up boosts Defense, maximum HP and Special Defense investment alongside a Careful nature allows Corviknight to take attacks from special attackers such as Indeedee, Hatterene, and Duraludon more easily.</p> <p>Corviknight is able to setup any time during the game as long as its checks and counters are removed. Xatu is able to set dual screens for Corviknight, allowing it to set up more easily on Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Dragapult that can otherwise KO it, as well as prevent Stealth Rock from going up on the field and cripple faster foes with Thunder Wave. Choice Scarf Charizard is able to threaten Steel and Ice teams, which are both popular and troublesome matchups for Flying teams otherwise by outspeeding and OHKOing Pokemon like Bisharp and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan that threaten Corviknight. Gyarados threatens Fire-types such as Cinderace, Charizard, and Salazzle and can sweep Water teams with Power Whip and Earthquake; in return, Corviknight can sweep Steel teams which Gyarados struggles to break. Mandibuzz is able to provide Defog support to keep Corviknight healthy, resistance to Ghost-type attacks, and momentum with U-turn to help set up a sweep. Nasty Plot Togekiss is another setup sweeper that can paralyze threats like Hydreigon and Indeedee, break Pokemon like Clefable and Mandibuzz, be used in conjunction with Corviknight to form a wallbreaking core. Choice Scarf Togekiss can cripple Pokemon with Trick, potentially giving Corviknight a free setup opportunity. Pelipper and Swift Swim Mantine can also take care of Fire-types, and Pelipper's Drizzle additionally allows Corviknight to survive Fire-type attacks more easily.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Corviknight is an amazing Defogger for Flying teams because of its excellent defensive typing, bulk, and ability in Pressure. Its Steel typing allows it to comfortably take Rock- and Ice-type moves, which would typically be problematic, such as Tyranitar's and Terrakion's Stone Edge, Cloyster's Icicle Spear,and Mamoswine's Icicle Crash; it also provides Corviknight with a variety of resistances, allowing it to switch in on other Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Excadrill. Its Steel typing also gives it a Toxic immunity, meaning Corviknight can take on defensive Stealth Rock setters such as Hippowdon, Shuckle, Piloswine, and Seismitoad that may carry the move. Pressure is particularly good on this set, as it means Corviknight can PP stall Stealth Rock users and keep entry hazards off the field more easily in conjunction with Defog. Body Press hits Pokemon such as Bisharp, Cloyster, Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Tyranitar for super effective damage, allowing Corviknight to check these Pokemon reliably. U-turn is important for Corviknight, as it can grab momentum against Pokemon it can't beat like Toxapex and Aegislash and bring in a teammate to more reliably take them on. Throughout the game, Corviknight should aim to find opportunities where it can comfortably use Defog or grab momentum using U-turn by switching in on Pokemon it walls. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Corviknight to check the aforementioned Pokemon in Mamoswine, Weavile, Cloyster, Excadrill, and Bisharp with more reliability while also boosting the power of Body Press to check these threats.</p> <p>Because Flying teams are typically weak to Stealth Rock, all of Corviknight's teammates appreciate its incredible reliability as a Defogger to keep entry hazards off the field. Choice Scarf Charizard is a great teammate for Corviknight, as it can outspeed and beat threats to Corviknight such as Choice Scarf Duraludon, Hydreigon, Aegislash, and Heliolisk; Charizard also appreciates Corviknight's Defog due to its 4x Stealth Rock weakness. Choice Scarf Noivern is another teammate that can outspeed and beat Dragon-type Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dracovish and Choice Specs Dragapult. Corviknight's U-turn is also good for bringing Charizard and Noivern in comfortably in matchups such as Steel and Dragon, respectively. Togekiss is a great setup sweeper that can break through Pokemon with Nasty Plot in conjunction with Thunder Wave and Air Slash, such as Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Dragapult, that Corviknight can't get past. Mantine can be used as a secondary Defogger, switching into a variety of strong special attacks with its good special bulk and defensive typing, such as Seismitoad's and Keldeo's Hydro Pump, Choice Scarf Dragapult's and Charizard's Fire Blast, and Choice Specs Aegislash's Shadow Ball, working together with Corviknight to form a good defensive core that can remove hazards for the rest of the team.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Corviknight's great bulk, amazing defensive typing, and access to Bulk Up make it a dangerous threat in the metagame that can be problematic to take down for unprepared teams. It's a staple for Steel teams because its typing gives it a very important Ground immunity that lets it check threats such as Excadrill as well as taking neutral damage from Fighting-type attacks. Special Defense investment is crucial because it allows Corviknight to comfortably switch into attacks such as Gengar's Shadow Ball and Flygon's Flamethrower. Mirror Armor is used to take on common Mystical Fire users, such as Hatterene, Indeedee, and Gardevoir, and lower their Special Attack. Mirror Armor can also help it avoid Special Defense drops from attacks like Shadow Ball. Bulk Up boosts Corviknight's already decent Defense, making it more difficult to take down, and increases its offensive pressure by boosting its Attack, allowing Brave Bird to break defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Hippowdon more easily. Brave Bird is its best STAB move and hits threatening Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Kommo-o that take very little from its other attacking options for super effective damage. Alternatively, it can use Power Trip, which becomes very strong after a couple of boosts, to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively at the cost of not being able to take on Fighting-types as effectively. Roost, paired with Leftovers, gives Corviknight a form of recovery to support its bulky setup and increase its longevity. Taunt prevents Toxapex from using Haze, Hippowdon from phazing Corviknight with Whirlwind, Ferrothorn from setting up entry hazards, and other Pokemon from recovering, setting up, or using their own Taunt. Due to its great bulk, Corviknight can afford to switch into threatening attacks, as its main role is to apply defensive pressure. It should find opportunities to use Bulk Up against passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and against Pokemon that don't threaten to 2HKO it such as Choice Scarf Terrakion.</p> <p>Ferrothorn forms a great defensive core with Corviknight and provides an important resistance to Water for Steel teams, as they're threatened by powerful attacks such as Seismitoad's Hydro Pump. Ferrothorn can also use Leech Seed and set up entry hazards to soften up the opposing team to make it easier for Corviknight to sweep. Excadrill covers Corviknight's weakness to Electric-type attacks, such as Zeraora's Plasma Fists, and can threaten Electric- and Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Charizard with its Mold Breaker Earthquake and Rock Slide, respectively, as well as revenge killing threats such as Hydreigon and SubToxic Salazzle. Choice Scarf Duraludon is another great partner that can revenge kill troublesome Pokemon such as Dragapult and Hydreigon and use Thunder Wave to spread paralysis on the opposing team to give Corviknight an easier time dealing with otherwise faster foes. Aegislash appreciates Corviknight's Ground immunity and in return can wallbreak the opposing team to weaken Corviknight's checks. Aegislash's Fighting immunity allows it to check threats such as Terrakion, and its good bulk also lets it survive some attacks that threaten Corviknight, such as Hydreigon and Dragapult's Fire Blast, whose users Aegislash can OHKO in return. Jirachi is a good option for breaking Water teams with its great coverage, notably being able to threaten Keldeo and Toxapex with its STAB-boosted Psychic. Melmetal is a very powerful and bulky wallbreaker that can soften up the opposing team to allow Corviknight to set up more easily and win. Lucario and Bisharp can also break holes in the opponent's team by setting up with Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, respectively, and they're great against Dark- and Psychic-type teams.</p> "

Additionally, Corviknight's access to status moves like Iron Defense and Roost lets it beat most physical threats that can't 2HKO it, such as Sawk, Golisopod, and Durant. 248 HP and 100 Defense EVs allow Corviknight to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Dracovish after Sitrus Berry and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan's Flare Blitz. 80 Special Defense, alongside the HP, lets Corviknight survive two Ice Beam from Choice Scarf Kyurem, letting Corviknight PP stall. The rest of the EVs are put into Speed, allowing Corviknight to outspeed non-Jolly Crustle and Gardevoir, if it receives a Choice Scarf through Trick. Generally, it's better to match Corviknight against physical threats that can't 2HKO it such as Crustle, Tyranitar, and Golisopod, as it can then use Iron Defense to bolster its Defense to the point where it can start to PP stall them via Pressure and use Roost to recover any incurred damage. Iron Head is Corviknight's main STAB move, and it allows Corviknight to hit Ice- and Fairy-types such as non-Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, Whimsicott, and Gardevoir. Corviknight can also run Body Press, which will allow it to KO Choice Scarf Dracovish without waiting for it to run out of PP. This is expressly for the purpose of avoiding potential critical hits, and outside of this is wholly inferior to Iron Head. Corviknight can also handle Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dragapult and Choice Scarf Hydreigon through using Pressure to PP stall Fire Blast and slowly recover health until the foe struggles. An alternative spread of 56 HP / 252 Def / 200 Spe can be run in order to outspeed Modest Sylveon, avoiding Yawn and Fake Tears shenanigans, while still almost always beating Choice Scarf Dracovish. Corviknight in general can run many different Speed benchmarks, depending on what it needs to get done, which can let it beat opposing Taunt users such as bulky Mandibuzz, bulky Kommo-o, or physical threats, like Choice Band Diggersby.</p> <p>Dragon-type Pokemon such as Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Haxorus appreciate Corviknight's ability to handle Ice- and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan, and Sylveon. In return, they take advantage of the Fire- and Electric-type Pokemon that Corviknight struggles against, including Chandelure, Dracozolt, and Rotom-H. Galarian Darmanitan, in particular, pairs well with Corviknight, as it is able to check some Electric- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Choice Specs Hydreigon, and Dracozolt. In return, Corviknight can handle Pokemon like Aegislash and Crustle and threaten the aforementioned Pokemon. Corviknight appreciates Electric-type Pokemon such as Dracozolt and Rotom-W, as they can handle Water-type Pokemon such as Dracovish and Inteleon, which Corviknight struggles to beat. On the other hand, the same Electric-types, benefit from Corviknight's typing and ability to defeat many Ground-types that would otherwise give them trouble, such as Rhyperior and Excadrill.</p> "

      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Iron Head is an option over Brave Bird or Body Press, allowing Corviknight to defeat Calm Mind Clefable while still hitting Mega Tyranitar and Kyurem decently hard. Iron Defense in tandem with Body Press can be used on stall teams to keep pace with Swords Dance Garchomp and Landorus-T, but this role is often better filled by Skarmory or Quagsire. Taunt can be used to shut down passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Hippowdon, and Clefable while also blocking any attempt to set up and blow past Corviknight. Unfortunately, Corviknight's other moves have much greater opportunity costs than Taunt has benefits. Shed Shell can be used to escape Magnezone, but losing Leftovers or Rocky Helmet is extremely detrimental, and having little use against teams without Magnezone makes it very matchup dependent.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon and Coverage: Magnezone, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora all use Corviknight as a free entry point thanks to their Flying resistance. The first in particular poses a huge threat to Corviknight, as it can trap it and remove it from the game. Similarly, Pokemon like Clefable and Mega Mawile often run Electric-type coverage that can beat down Corviknight.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran and Mega Charizard Y are easily capable of breaking past Corviknight with their STAB moves. The latter in particular can repeatedly come in if Stealth Rock is not on the field thanks to Roost. However, both must be wary of switching into too many Brave Birds or Body Presses, or of Corviknight using them to pivot into a wallbreaker like Mega Medicham or Tapu Koko.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Ground-types: Landorus-T and Excadrill are normally walled by Corviknight, but if they decide to run Substitute, they can use it as setup fodder. As Corviknight cannot touch them without the proper move and U-turn can't break their Substitutes, they can simply set up safely behind a Substitute and break past it. It should be noted that Bulk Up and Iron Defense sets can set up alongside these Pokemon, making them non-issues.</p> ",

Its good matchups against common entry hazard setters in Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mega Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn, alongside Pressure to deplete the PP of their entry hazards, make it a fantastic Defogger. Brave Bird is preferred to threaten Rillaboom, Garchomp, Mega Medicham, and Landorus-T, but Body Press can be used if one's team is weak to Pokemon like Excadrill and Kartana, or if one wants to secure the Mega Tyranitar matchup while discouraging Heatran from switching in. U-turn allows Corviknight to take advantage of the Pokemon it checks by granting free switch-in opportunities to teammates, preserve momentum against Pokemon that seek to take advantage of it such as Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, and escape Magnezone on the switch. Alternatively, Bulk Up can be used over U-turn to better deal with the setup sweepers Corviknight is tasked with handling, like Gliscor and offensive Landorus-T, while also letting it act as a potent wincon. However, U-turn's utility makes Bulk Up generally inferior.</p> <p>Pressure allows Corviknight to PP stall entry hazard moves of passive setters, such as Ferrothorn and Clefable lacking Calm Mind, as well as PP stall other Pokemon like Gliscor and Mega Tyranitar. 184 Defense EVs with an Impish nature allow Corviknight to not be OHKOed by +2 Continental Crush from Landorus-T, with the remaining EVs going to Special Defense to let it switch into Tapu Lele, Mega Latias, and Clefable better. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 44 Def / 212 SpD with an Impish nature allows Corviknight to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Hidden Power Fire while also letting it withstand +2 Garchomp's Continental Crush. If running U-turn, using 0 Speed IVs with a Relaxed nature is an option to grab as much momentum as possible against Pokemon like Clefable, although being slower than Blissey and Mega Mawile can be problematic. Leftovers prevents Corviknight from being worn down too quickly. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet can be used to punish U-turn from the likes of Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, and Mega Lopunny.</p> <p>Corviknight is heavily threatened by Fire-types like Heatran and Mega Charizard Y. Therefore, bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Toxapex can form strong defensive cores with it. Gastrodon can also deal with a major roadblock in Zapdos; Slowbro and Slowking can form a pivot core with Corviknight; and Toxapex enjoys Corviknight checking most Ground- and Psychic-types. Corviknight has a mediocre matchup against Electric-types and Pokemon with Electric-type coverage, such as Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Mega Mawile. Teammates that can take these threats on, such as the aforementioned Gastrodon in Tapu Koko's case and Heatran in the case of the latter two, pair well with it. Corviknight can form pivot cores with Pokemon like Landorus-T and Mega Lopunny, with both appreciating Corviknight's ability to lure in Steel-types that they can take advantage of such as Aegislash, Magnezone, and Heatran. Pokemon that appreciate Corviknight's ability to get them in unscathed, such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Weavile, make great partners. Weavile in particular is great at strengthening the matchup against Ground-types that Corviknight cannot properly force out, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor.</p> "

Sticky Web, on the other hand, slows down faster threats like Choice Scarf Weavile and Gengar, allowing teammates like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Jirachi to deal with such threats much more easily and to threaten opposing teams better. Orbeetle should be used early-game so that it can provide essential support to the team to have momentum going; however, when faced against teams with Magic Bounce users like Hatterene and Xatu, it's best not to set up Sticky Web recklessly, as it can backfire. U-turn should be used to switch into an appropriate teammate after Orbeetle has set screens or Sticky Web. Frisk allows Orbeetle to scout for items on the opposing teams.

Its high HP combined with its decent Special Defense allows it to comfortably tank special hits that aren't super effective such as Dragapult's Shadow Ball and Hydreigon's Dark Pulse. Investment in Special Defense is chosen because most Fire-type attacks are special and Appletun's most valuable trait is resisting Fire. Recover combined with Leech Seed, Protect, and Leftovers can be problematic to deal with, as it gives Appletun a lot of ways to recover HP and stall out the foe. Protect is also very important for scouting Choice users such as Dracozolt, Dragapult, and Hydreigon, allowing Grass teams to take advantage by making the right switch. Appletun's bulk allows it to pivot in on attacks that don't threaten to OHKO it such as Gengar's Focus Blast and gain momentum by using Leech Seed, followed up by Protect to scout the opponent's next move and gain more recovery from Leech Seed and Leftovers.</p> <p>Ferrothorn forms a great defensive core with Appletun, as they cover each other's weaknesses. Appletun resists Fire-type attacks that threaten Ferrothorn and the rest of the team, while Ferrothorn is immune to Poison, resists Dragon, and takes neutral damage from Ice-, Flying-, and Bug-type attacks. This comes into play against threats such as Galarian Darmanitan, Choice Specs Hydreigon, and Indeedee, which have the coverage to threaten both Appletun and Ferrothorn, but Protect allows them to scout which move they're going for and make the appropriate switch. Ferrothorn can also set up entry hazards, which Appletun can take advantage of by using Leech Seed to force switches and Protect to scout Choice users, resulting in the opposing team taking a lot of damage. Whimsicott also covers Appletun's Dragon weakness and threatens Dragon-type teams, which are hard for Grass to deal with. Whimsicott also appreciates Appletun's Leech Seed to get recovery when it switches in on a Dragon-type attack. In addition, Whimsicott can use Encore on Pokemon trying to setup or lock them into a recovery or status move. Rotom-C threatens Flying-types, most notably Corviknight and Togekiss, which pose huge threats to Grass. Rillaboom is a good partner and great Choice Scarf user that can threaten Ferrothorn with Superpower, which otherwise would be very hard for Grass teams to break. Choice Scarf Rillaboom can outspeed and threaten some problematic Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, and Dragapult.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Choice Specs Toxtricity is arguably RU's most threatening immediate attacker thanks to its Punk Rock-boosted Boomburst, which has very few consistent switch-ins. Pokemon with the typing or special bulk to take Boomburst, like Stakataka and Porygon2, are vulnerable to Toxtricity's coverage or lose momentum to Volt Switch. Though slow, Toxtricity poses a massive early-game threat to offensive teams, as staples like Noivern cannot immediately OHKO it and fear getting OHKOed in return. Its resistances let it even switch into and punish Cobalion, Roserade, and Raikou once or twice, especially if they go for utility moves. Once Toxtricity has taken some damage, however, it becomes much less of a threat, as its low Speed and bulk will make it easy for many Pokemon to pick off. Its vulnerability to Stealth Rock and Spikes worsens this issue, especially in a metagame full of pivots using Heavy-Duty Boots, which incentivizes conventional offensive teams to forgo entry hazard removal. It faces competition from RU's other top Electric-types, Raikou and Xurkitree; the former's naturally high Speed lets it remain a threat to offense all game long, while the latter can use Choice Scarf to similarly threaten offense or Heavy-Duty Boots to wallbreak like Toxtricity without fearing entry hazards. Both Electric-types are always faster than offensive Togekiss, which can overcome weakened Toxtricity with Air Slash flinches.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Shift Gear set using Boomburst, Overdrive, Drain Punch, and Life Orb or Throat Spray with maximum Special Attack and Speed investment and a Mild or Hasty nature can be a nasty surprise sweeper that beats and sets up on Porygon2. With so many other sweepers and Choice Scarf users available, including Sharpedo, Cloyster, Mimikyu, Xurkitree, and Heracross, dedicating Toxtricity to the role is usually unnecessary and a waste of its power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Entry Hazards and Offensive Pressure: Offensive teams often won't have a solid switch-in to Toxtricity beyond a one-time check like Steelix; they bank on trading damage with it or wearing it down with Stealth Rock and Spikes until it's in KO range of faster Pokemon. Toxtricity's unremarkable bulk means this won't take long. Most aggressive teams will also give Toxtricity very few opportunities to directly switch in.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: The presence of a Ghost-type forces Toxtricity to think twice about spamming Boomburst, limiting how much damage it can get out of its attack opportunities. Golurk and Lightning Rod Alolan Marowak are even immune to Electric, meaning Toxtricity has to risk using the generally mediocre Snarl or Sludge Bomb. Colbur Berry Dhelmise can take a hit from Toxtricity pretty well. Ghost-types generally work well with Ground-types by maximizing the number of predictions Toxtricity has to make.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2: Punk Rock halves damage taken from sound-based moves, making Trace Porygon2 a very reliable switch-in to Toxtricity, albeit one wide open to Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Snorlax and Registeel can stand up to Toxtricity's attacks for a while, though they lose momentum to Volt Switch and are easily pressured. Diancie and Stakataka can switch into Boomburst but hate Electric-type attacks. Steelix and Assault Vest Reuniclus can switch into Boomburst once and threaten to KO in return.</p> ",

Volt Switch lets Toxtricity bring a threatening teammate in against relatively consistent checks like Porygon2 and Registeel. Sludge Bomb can poison bulky switch-ins, 2HKOes Alolan Marowak, and OHKOes Trace Gardevoir. Snarl catches the occasional Golurk along with OHKOing Alolan Marowak. Toxtricity's Speed tier isn't crowded, so it can get away with a Modest nature. Running a Timid nature is advantageous against other Toxtricity, though it makes Pokemon harder to OHKO with Boomburst.</p> <p>Proactive teams using offensive pivots like Noivern and Volt Switch Cobalion are best at giving Toxtricity chances to freely attack and compensating for its poor Speed. Flygon and Mienshao are U-turn users that pivot on switch-ins like Togekiss and Galarian Weezing, which healthy Toxtricity is then free to exploit.

It can also aid Polteageist in beating Incineroar provided that Misty Terrain is active. Shadow Ball either OHKOes or 2HKOes most Pokemon that don't resist it. Giga Drain allows Polteageist to OHKO Water / Ground types such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad and hit bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune for super effective damage. Alternatively, Polteageist can run Stored Power over Giga Drain in order to hit neutral targets such as Crobat, Raikou, and Golisopod for more damage. White Herb reverses the stat drops from Shell Smash and enables Polteageist to take on Incineroar.

Shell Smash and powerful coverage options like Giga Drain and Stored Power make it a threatening setup sweeper that can easily OHKO much of the tier. However, Polteageist's frail defensive stats means it needs significant team support to truly be a consistent threat; while it's a powerful sweeper, it's still a predictable one due to having only one viable set, unlike other setup sweepers such as Necrozma and Kommo-o. Additionally, Polteageist struggles to break through Dark-types like Zarude and Galarian Moltres. The potential upside of using Polteageist is huge, but its weakness to entry hazards and priority alongside its inability to break through several common metagame threats can easily hamper its success. Polteageist works best with Psychic Terrain support to neutralize its weakness to priority, and while it can succeed with dual screens support, there are several other setup sweepers that require less support and are easier to justify.</p> ",

Additionally, Galarian Moltres can use Polteageist as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Without Psychic Terrain support, Polteageist is extremely vulnerable to priority. Defense drops from Weak Armor and Shell Smash combined with its poor defensive stats means that common priority users like Aegislash, Lycanroc-D, and Crawdaunt can easily OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Entry hazards break Polteageist's Focus Sash on entry, making it harder to set up, while Sticky Web prevents it from outspeeding common speed control Pokemon it otherwise would, like Choice Scarf Zarude, Barraskewda, and Choice Scarf Krookodile.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Polteageist can boost past Chansey and overwhelm it, but other special walls like Umbreon, Celesteela, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can easily check it.

Magic Bounce allows it to bounce back entry hazards from setters such as Hippowdon, Toxapex, and Galvantula while preventing it from being statused by moves such as Thunder Wave and Toxic. Its EVs and a Bold nature maximize its physical bulk, making Hatterene more potent and harder to revenge kill after a few Calm Mind boosts. A Relaxed nature should be used on Trick Room sets. Leftovers is another form of recovery for Hatterene alongside Draining Kiss that allows it to stay healthy through the match.</p> <p>All of its teammates appreciate its ability to keep the field clear of entry hazards, namely Toxic Spikes, especially those weak to Stealth Rock such as Alolan Ninetales and Togekiss. In return, Alolan Ninetales can set up Aurora Veil, clearing a path for Hatterene to set up with Calm Mind. Togekiss can help wear down Pokemon such as Incineroar and Snorlax with the combination of Nasty Plot and Air Slash for Hatterene. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can take on a handful of Pokemon for Hatterene outside of Trick Room such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Venusaur, and Dracovish, as well as giving it a second chance to sweep via Healing Wish. Gardevoir appreciates Hatterene's ability to take on Poison-type Pokemon, taking some pressure off it. Grimmsnarl and Mimikyu appreciate Hatterene's ability to take on physical walls such as Toxapex and Avalugg, and, in return, they can break past some of Hatterene's checks such as Jirachi and Gengar. Clefable can set up Stealth Rock for Hatterene, allowing it to better take on Charizard and Cloyster. Clefable can also run an offensive Stealth Rock set with Moonblast, Thunderbolt, and Flamethrower that allows it to take on Pokemon such as Mantine, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn. If Clefable does run Flamethrower, it can free up room for Hatterene to run Trick Room instead of Mystical Fire. Primarina can take on Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Cinderace and Excadrill. It can also form a potent Calm Mind core with Hatterene. Primarina can fish for Scald burns, allowing both of them to take on physical attackers with more ease and be more effective Calm Mind sweepers.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Due to Hatterene's very low Speed, Trick Room allows it to outspeed almost every Pokemon in the metagame. That, combined with its high Special Attack and great coverage, makes Hatterene a great wallbreaker for Psychic-type teams. Dazzling Gleam and Mystical Fire provide great coverage for Psychic-type teams because they hit Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon that resist or are immune to Psychic such as Hydreigon, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn. Magic Bounce allows Hatterene to bounce back entry hazards and status moves, which is very useful considering Psychic-type teams lack good hazard control. It also allows it to get free Trick Room opportunities against Pokemon such as Toxapex and Hippowdon, as it's not affected by Toxic or Whirlwind. Hatterene's main roles are to be a wallbreaker, be a late-game Trick Room sweeper, or switch in on hazards to bounce them back. If it has an important role in a battle, its health should be preserved, and it should avoid switching in on powerful attacks.</p> <p>Hatterene appreciates Stealth Rock support from Bronzong to chip away at the foe's team and break Focus Sashes to limit switch-ins to its powerful attacks. Bronzong can also set up screens to support Hatterene. Indeedee's a great partner because of its immunity to Ghost-type attacks, which threaten Hatterene. Another good Pokemon to pair up with Hatterene is Gallade, which can help break through special walls that might give it problems. Reuniclus can take advantage of Hatterene's Trick Room and use it to either set up with Calm Mind and Acid Armor or attack to soften up the opposing team. Gardevoir also works well as a partner because its Trace ability combined with Hatterene's Trick Room forms a strong core against weather teams.</p> "

Additionally, thanks to Magic Bounce, it can act as hazard control for Psychic teams, which otherwise have poor hazard control. Calm Mind allows Hatterene to become a dangerous special attacker that is able to take on Pokemon such as Zeraora, Hippowdon, and Charizard more easily while also allowing it to better withstand special attacks such as Hydreigon's Dark Pulse. Psychic is a strong STAB move that allows Hatterene to hit hard and take on Pokemon that resist Fairy-type such as Fire-type Pokemon like Volcarona and Charizard. Draining Kiss allows Hatterene to hit Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Weavile and Dragapult for super effective damage. Additionally, it provides Hatterene with a form of recovery, preventing it from being chipped down too quickly. Trick Room allows Hatterene to take advantage of its lower natural Speed. Calm Mind and Trick Room together allow Hatterene to very easily take on teams that are weak to its STAB attacks and can flip the matchups against Electric and Rain Water teams, which typically rely on their high speed. The EVs and a Relaxed nature maximize Hatterene's physical bulk, make it as slow as possible for Trick Room, and allowing it to withstand physical attacks while setting up Calm Mind. Leftovers provide Hatterene with a form of passive recovery, which is useful for helping set up Trick Room.</p> <p>All of Hatterene's teammates appreciate its ability to act as hazard control and act as a soft check to Dark-type Pokemon. Colbur Berry and Nasty Plot Mew can take on Steel-type Pokemon, such as Bisharp, for Hatterene with Fire Blast and Vacuum Wave. A bulky stallbreaker Mew set can cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, and remove Leftovers from bulkier Pokemon with Knock Off, allowing Hatterene to more easily break them. Indeedee is a great special wallbreaker that can set up Psychic Terrain, allowing it to act as a nuke with Expanding Force and block priority attacks such as Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Indeedee can also break Ghost- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Chandelure, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn with Shadow Ball and Mystical Fire, respectively. Slowbro is a fantastic defensive pivot that can provide Psychic teams with a proper Fire-type resist, allowing them to have a switch into Pokemon such as Charizard. Slowbro also generates momentum for the team through Teleport, allowing it to safely bring in a teammate while regaining health thanks to Regenerator. Alakazam can act as an emergency check to physical attackers such as Urshifu-S, Azumarill, Bisharp, and Scolipede thanks to Magic Guard and a Focus Sash. Alakazam can also act as a powerful setup Pokemon with Nasty Plot that can revenge kill threats such as Scizor with +2 Expanding Force. Choice Scarf Jirachi can take on Fairy- and Ice-type Pokemon that are capable of threatening Hatterene, such as opposing Hatterene and Galarian Darmanitan, with Iron Head. Jirachi can also provide Hatterene with a second chance through Healing Wish or pivot it in safely with U-turn. Gardevoir can alleviate Hatterene's pressure to act as the team's sole check to Dark-type Pokemon, as well as provide Hatterene with a Healing Wish. Choice Scarf Gardevoir is also capable of taking on weather users such as Swift Swim Kingdra, Chlorophyll Venusaur, and Sand Rush Excadrill due to its ability Trace. Celebi can set Stealth Rock for Psychic teams as well as act as a resistance to Water-, Ground-, and Electric-type Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Rhyperior, and Alolan Raichu. Celebi can also provide more utility for Hatterene by either spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave or supporting it with Healing Wish and U-turn.</p> "

Thunder Wave is Morgrem's best status move, allowing it to target faster attackers that can otherwise be a threat such as Kadabra, Raboot, and Shell Smash Wartortle. Morgrem can also use Taunt to shut down walls like Galarian Corsola and Ferroseed and prevent Golbat and Togetic from clearing dual screens with Defog. Dazzling Gleam is Morgrem's best damaging move that hits common wallbreakers like Gurdurr, Fraxure, and Galarian Linoone. 192 SpA allows for Morgrem to OHKO Flame Orb Machoke after Stealth Rock damage while 128 Speed EVs allow Morgrem to outspeed Flame Orb Machoke.</p> <p>Morgrem best functions early- to late-game as a support to offensive teams and usually is best paired with wallbreakers and set up sweepers, as the provided longevity allows them to tank opposing attacks better. Pokemon like Kadabra, Flame Orb Machoke, Choice Band Piloswine, Thwackey, and Wartortle are especially good under screen support. You should try to avoid bringing Morgrem in on Pokemon that commonly run Knock Off, as you want to have your dual screens last for longer; alternatively, if it can afford to, Morgrem's resistance to Knock Off helps it switch into Galarian Linoone and Gurdurr for teammates.

Its solid bulk, decent Speed, and access to STAB Knock Off make it a unique offensive threat. Obstagoon can outspeed many metagame staples such as Rotom-H, Rotom-W, Krookodile, and Galarian Moltres. It has an excellent matchup against slower bulkier teams because of its status immunity, ability to heal off chip damage with Rest, and high damage output with STAB Knock Off. Due to its poor defensive typing, Obstagoon can be pretty easy to revenge kill or pressure, and Fighting-types like Keldeo and Kommo-o can be especially problematic. Also, it tends to have poorer matchups against hyper offense, as teams pack more faster threats that give Obstagoon few opportunities to wallbreak, although it still can potentially pick up a KO or two.</p> ",

It can also run an Adamant nature to hit harder, allowing it to OHKO Nidoqueen and Azumarill, but this makes Obstagoon slower than other Pokemon it would normally outspeed such as Kommo-o, Krookodile, Rotom-H, and Rotom-W. Obstruct can stall a turn to activate Obstagoon's Flame Orb while also potentially halving the Defense of normal checks such as Scizor. Parting Shot allows it to pivot on switch-ins such as Buzzwole.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types Moves: Fighting-types such as Keldeo can outspeed Obstagoon and KO it with ease with their STAB moves. Conkeldurr can also KO it with Mach Punch. Faster Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage like Lycanroc-D can also threaten it out. All of these Pokemon struggle to pivot into Obstagoon.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Buzzwole and Diancie almost completely stonewall Obstagoon. Neutralizing Gas Galarian Weezing can even remove its Guts boost and force it to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Obstagoon puts itself on a timer as soon as it activates Flame Orb, so it can prematurely faint after a strong neutral hit.

It can also let Obstagoon completely wall SubToxic Aegislash and give Obstagoon longevity against bulkier teams. Sleep Talk lets Obstagoon be a potent wallbreaker while asleep thanks to Guts remaining active. Close Combat OHKOs the only Pokemon in the tier that resist Obstagoon's STAB combination, Cobalion, while also letting it hit foes like Krookodile harder. Switcheroo can be used alongside Close Combat to cripple some slower physical attackers like Azumarill, Crawdaunt, and Tapu Bulu.

Rotom-H can bring Obstagoon in safely and pressure Amoonguss, physically defensive Tangrowth, and Celesteela. Obstagoon can also fit well on Sticky Web teams with Araquanid and Shuckle to patch up its Speed a bit. It also appreciates entry hazard support in general so it can get the extra chip for easier OHKOs against Pokemon such as Nidoqueen. Stealth Rock support from Nidoqueen and Nihilego allows Obstagoon to OHKO Azumarill and Mamoswine and even gives it a chance to 2HKO Tangrowth.

In addition, Obstagoon is capable of OHKOing a plethora of offensive threats with its Sucker Punch after a Swords Dance boost. Close Combat can be used over Swords Dance in order to OHKO Tyranitar, Urshifu and Terrakion, but this compromises Obstagoon's ability to sweep.

Switch-ins to these Pokemon include Aegislash, Toxapex, and Hippowdon, although a lot of these are very shaky checks to Terrakion. Obstagoon can struggle to break bulkier Steel-types such as Magearna, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight, so Fire-types like Rotom-H, Marowak-Alola and Cinderace make good partners. Obstagoon also appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Hippowdon, and Toxapex.

Reversal is an 80-Base Power attack after Eiscue uses Substitute and Belly Drum, providing great neutral coverage alongside Eiscue's Ice STAB and letting it take down Steel-type Pokemon it otherwise couldn't, such as Mawile, Pawniard, and Klang, as well as Lapras. Zen Headbutt sacrifices hitting those target in order to cover Mareanie, which otherwise walls Eiscue. Liquidation is a niche option that deals more damage to the aforementioned targets before Eiscue is set up. Substitute provides Eiscue with protection from status and revenge killing, and lets it activate its Salac Berry after using Belly Drum, outspeeding most of the unboosted metagame even if Ice Face hasn't been activated and outrunning even the fastest boosted Pokemon, like Choice Scarf Manectric and Quick Feet Galarian Linoone, if it has been activated. Belly Drum brings Eiscue's otherwise mediocre Attack stat to ridiculous levels, making it vital to sweeping. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed investment is used to let Eiscue outspeed fast Pokemon like Leafeon and Silvally at +1 if Ice Face isn't activated.</p> <p>Eiscue fits best on offensive teams that can break through its defensive answers. If Eiscue isn't running Zen Headbutt, teammates that can take on Mareanie are absolutely vital. Good examples of these teammates include Electric-type Pokemon like Manectric and Raichu and Psychic-type Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Musharna, and Mr. Rime, the latter of which can also remove entry hazards. Roselia can use Spikes or Toxic Spikes to help wear down the opponent's defensive backbone, check Water-types, put opposing Pokemon to sleep to provide Eiscue with more setup opportunities, and removes Toxic Spikes, which would otherwise shut Eiscue down. If Eiscue isn't running Reversal, teammates that can take on Steel-types are important. Falinks and Hitmontop are good at pressuring foes like Mawile, Klang, and Pawniard offensively, with Falinks fitting very well on hyper offense and Hitmontop offering hazard removal and reliable priority. The aforementioned Psychic-types are also great options for wearing down Steel-types, as most teams rely on those Pokemon to take them on, with Mr. Rime, Mr. Mime, and Musharna giving Eiscue a safe switch and a second chance at setting up via Healing Wish. Pivots such as the aforementioned Electric-type Pokemon, Silvally formes, and Drakloak can be useful for getting Eiscue on the field safely against Pokemon that it threatens, like Roselia, or that can't bypass Ice Face, as is the case for most physical attackers lacking Knock Off. Stonjourner makes for a strong lead option on offense that can provide Stealth Rock support and threaten several of Eiscue's answers with Earthquake. Other setup sweepers, like Fraxure, Pawniard, and the previously mentioned Falinks and Raichu, are effective at softening the opponent's defensive backbone for Eiscue. Wallbreakers like Swords Dance Mawile, Throh, and Choice Band Fraxure are effective teammates for the same purpose, with the former two being able to use Knock Off on sturdy answers to Eiscue, like Mareanie and Klang, that rely on their Eviolite to function effectively.</p> "

This EV spread lets Cufant hit 18 Attack and maintain a good 24/14/12 bulk. Cufant's additional moves can provide extra coverage or set up entry hazards to support its teammates; Power Whip can hit Water-types and Onix, Play Rough hits Fighting-types, and so on. However, Cufant is very slow, so it should be used with Pokemon that can take care of its checks; for example, Vullaby and Wingull can beat Fighting-types, and Chinchou can beat Fire-types as well as provide a slow VoltTurn to pivot Cufant in. A Wish passer like Spritzee can keep Cufant's health up since it lacks reliable recovery itself. Pokemon that struggle with Fairy-types, like Scraggy and Galarian Farfetch'd, benefit from Cufant's presence on the team.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Copperajah is one of NU's best Pokemon because of its combination of offensive and defensive dominance. It possesses great coverage and a very high Attack stat, which leaves it with few consistent defensive answers, and the bulk and defensive typing to handle some of NU's strongest special attackers such as Dragalge, Goodra, and Choice Specs Sylveon. As a result, Copperajah is both an elite Stealth Rock setter and wallbreaker. Copperajah's only real flaws end up being its poor Speed, which makes it easy for faster attackers to deal with, and coverage issues, meaning it will run the risk of not being able to take advantage of its great attacking prowess in certain matchups. It also lacks reliable recovery and is somewhat vulnerable to status, which makes playing against common Defoggers like Mantine, Talonflame, and Rotom-C trickier than desired.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Copperajah can forgo Stealth Rock in favor of Protect, letting it scout Choice item revenge killers like Passimian and Sirfetch'd. Stealth Rock sets can run much more offensively inclined EV spreads to be better wallbreakers and outpace faster defensive Pokemon like Sylveon and Dragalge; however, doing this severely compromises Copperajah's bulk. Choice Band sets capitalize even further on Copperajah's offensive prowess but heavily cut into what it can do defensively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Arcanine is the best defensive answer to Copperajah available; despite Copperajah having super effective coverage for it, Arcanine's Intimidate and solid physical bulk offset that. Talonflame is a riskier switch-in because of Stone Edge but easily takes any other attack from Copperajah and can fish for burns with Flame Body. Salazzle is much less consistent answer to Copperajah because of its poor bulk but can revenge kill Copperajah with Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Guzzlord: Copperajah lacks a good coverage move to deal with Guzzlord, and because of the latter's immense weight, it takes little from Heavy Slam and threatens back with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mudsdale can take Power Whip well enough and threaten back with a strong Earthquake. Offensive Ground-types like Mudsdale and Golurk variants can easily KO Copperajah with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Despite being poor switch-ins to Copperajah, Fighting-types such as Passimian, Sirfetch'd, and Machamp easily OHKO it with Close Combat.</p> ",

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>In sand, Dracozolt is one of the tier's most threatening wallbreakers thanks to its great Speed and signature move Bolt Beak, which doubles in power when Dracozolt moves first. It easily beats both offensive and defensive staples like Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, Toxapex, and Corviknight. Whether it is by trapping and weakening Pokemon like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Garchomp with Fire Spin or simply running coverage, Dracozolt can overcome traditional checks to Electric-types. Unfortunately, Dracozolt is reliant on sand, as it is very slow and easy to offensively pressure outside it. It has mediocre bulk and can be worn down quickly by entry hazards, especially with Life Orb. Finally, Dracozolt is reliant on prediction to nail switch-ins to Bolt Beak and utilize limited sand turns, which sometimes makes it very underwhelming.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fire Blast can be used over Fire Spin on the Substitute set for more immediate damage against Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Melmetal. However, it requires a lot of prediction to be effective, and these Pokemon are still able to pivot around Dracozolt, making Fire Spin's ability to trap them preferred. Taunt can be used on the Life Orb set to force out passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, but Dracozolt dislikes having to give up a coverage move for it, and it should spend its sand turns attacking. High Horsepower can replace Earthquake on teams with Rillaboom so Dracozolt is not weakened by Grassy Terrain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Specially defensive Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert are some of the very few reliable checks to Dracozolt, tanking even Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteors and OHKOing back with Earthquake. However, Swampert is chipped down quite easily. Utility Excadrill is capable of walling Dracozolt if it does not carry Earthquake, while Sand Rush Excadrill outspeeds and revenge kills Dracozolt in sand. Defensive Landorus-T can switch into Dracozolt and force it out, but switching into Draco Meteor and Fire Spin wears it down over time. Other Ground-types like Garchomp and Nidoking can fall to Dracozolt's coverage moves, but they prevent it from freely using its strongest STAB move and revenge kill it outside of sand.</p> <p><strong>Losing Sand: Dracozolt is unable to accomplish much outside of sand due to its mediocre Speed, below almost every offensive Pokemon in the tier, so you can stall out its sand turns by switching around it or using Protect users like Heatran. However, Dracozolt can overcome these strategies if it predicts correctly. Pelipper, Torkoal, and Alolan Ninetales replace sand with their own weather as well, although they cannot directly switch into Dracozolt.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Priority moves like Weavile's Ice Shard, Bisharp's Sucker Punch, and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide can finish off Dracozolt even in sand if it is weakened, which is fairly likely thanks to Substitute damage or Life Orb recoil, though Dracozolt can get past them with a Substitute up. Substitute can particularly exploit Sucker Punch, and none of these Pokemon can directly switch into Dracozolt.</p> <p><strong>Status: Although Dracozolt theoretically possesses the typing to switch into some defensive Pokemon like Slowking, Toxapex, and Zapdos, it cannot do so safely, as they can cripple it with Scald burns or Toxic. Burns weaken it, and both leave Dracozolt worn down even more quickly than usual.</p> ",

Substitute allows Dracozolt to take advantage of the switches it forces, easing prediction, and avoid status moves from Pokemon it can trap with Fire Spin, such as Ferrothorn's Leech Seed and Tangrowth's Sleep Powder. If Dracozolt has a Substitute up, it can still safely attack one time outside of sand. Fire Spin allows Dracozolt to trap passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and especially Clefable, easing prediction, and wear down some of its checks that lack reliable recovery, like Landorus-T and Ferrothorn. 140 Special Attack EVs let Dracozolt beat defensive Landorus-T. To do this, it must hit Landorus-T on the switch with Draco Meteor, then switch out. Later in the match, the combination of Fire Spin and Draco Meteor will then be able to KO it. 184 Speed EVs allow Dracozolt to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T in sand. The remaining EVs are pooled into Attack to increase Bolt Beak's damage output. A Lonely nature guarantees that Dracozolt survives Clefable's Moonblast from full health and 2HKOes specially defensive Tyranitar with Bolt Beak, and it doesn't weaken Draco Meteor. Leftovers is the preferred item to heal off Substitute damage and weaker attacks.</p> <p>Dracozolt is used exclusively on sand cores. Consequently, Tyranitar or Hippowdon is a necessary teammate. Both of them can also set Stealth Rock for Dracozolt. Excadrill is also common on these sand cores; it can either sweep teams with Swords Dance once Dracozolt has weakened them or cripple shared checks like Tangrowth and Landorus-T with Toxic, making them even easier to trap and eliminate. Dracozolt's ability to trap Clefable and Ferrothorn is appreciated by Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Scizor, and they can give Dracozolt free turns against many of their checks like Corviknight by using U-turn. Skarmory can set Spikes, which is particularly useful for wearing down Dracozolt's checks like Hippowdon, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal as Dracozolt forces them in, and it also checks Excadrill. Dracozolt's poor bulk gives it few opportunities to switch in safely, making Teleport users like Slowbro and Slowking useful. Future Sight from either also stops many of Dracozolt's defensive checks, like Clefable and Landorus-T, from switching into it safely. Landorus-T and Corviknight are helpful teammates to check Pokemon like Excadrill for Dracozolt, and they draw in defensive Pokemon that it beats like Skarmory and bring it in safely with U-turn against them. Landorus-T also cripples Tangrowth and opposing Landorus-T with Toxic.</p> "

Pivots like Dragapult, defensive Landorus-T, and Slowking can draw in Pokemon that Dracozolt can beat, like Mandibuzz, Corviknight, and Blissey, and bring it in safely with U-turn or Teleport to start wallbreaking. Slowking is particularly notable, as Future Sight is useful for pressuring Dracozolt's checks like Landorus-T and Clefable. Corviknight and Skarmory are consistent checks to the majority of Ground-types and Rillaboom, which often trouble sand teams. The former can also use its slow U-turn to bring Dracozolt in safely, while the latter sets Spikes to wear down its checks.

Fishious Rend will actually do more damage than Outrage against slower opponents that resist it, so Outrage should only be used against potentially faster threats like Rotom-W and priority users like Golisopod. Psychic Fangs OHKOs Urshifu-R. Low Kick is only useful against Ferrothorn, doing marginally more damage than Fishious Rend, and Bisharp, which can avoid double damage with Sucker Punch. Dracovish runs 8 HP and 72 Defense EVs in order to survive a non-Adamant Choice Band Close Combat from Urshifu-R. 176 Speed investment is used to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, and specifically non-Jolly Sirfetch'd and max Speed Crawdaunt. Maximum Attack is run to OHKO Chansey. Special Defense can be invested into Dracovish in order to lure in and beat bulky non-Choice Specs Primarina. It will require heavy investment with a Careful nature, and matchups against certain Pokemon will have to be sacrificed to gain good odds against bulky Primarina. For example, one can run a spread of 176 Atk / 196 SpD / 136 with a Careful nature, which has the Attack investment needed to OHKO Snorlax, and the Speed necessary to outspeed Sylveon, or a spread of 148 Atk / 196 SpD / 164 Spe with a Careful nature, which outspeeds uninvested Arcanine and has the Attack investment for Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan. Be aware that Dracovish won't be able to beat the rarer, more offensive variants of Primarina.</p> <p>Fishious Rend is notable for being able to beat Aegislash, which can normally beat physical attackers with King's Shield, and Primarina, given the appropriate Special Defense investment. Despite being Fire-types, faster Arcanine variants and Substitute Volcarona beat Dracovish, either by losing its Fire typing through Burn Up, knocking Dracovish out with Outrage, or activating Swarm and Petaya Berry and OHKOing with Bug Buzz. Sturdy Pokemon are usually slower than Dracovish, but beat Dracovish anyway, since they avoid being OHKOed, and thus Crustle, Magnezone, and Sawk should be avoided. Galarian Corsola can beat Dracovish, despite being slower, since their access to Strength Sap and Cursed Body can heal off damage dealt until Dracovish's Fishious Rend is disabled. Bulky Steel-types like Aegislash and Magnezone are generally appreciated as partners for Dracovish, who can generally handle offensive Fairy- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Togekiss and Kyurem, as well as fast offensive nukes like Galarian Darmanitan and Porygon-Z, and Galarian Corsola. Aqua Jet Chilan Berry Primarina can also be used as a partner to shore up Dracovish's weakness against Sturdy Pokemon, as well Dragon-type Pokemon, Porygon-Z, and Galarian Darmanitan.</p> "

Hex in combination with these allows walls like Galarian Corsola and Mareanie to be broken down easily, and U-turn gives Drakloak the opportunity to pivot out of the field to generate momentum or when threats are not yet in range of its attacks. Fire Blast enables Drakloak to force out Steel-types like Ferroseed that may try to switch into Drakloak and take advantage of it by setting hazards up. Draco Meteor, on the other hand, can be used to output strong damage against the general metagame as well as to hit Pokemon that resist Hex or are immune to the status of choice like Galarian Linoone, Magmar, and Piloswine. Infiltrator enables Drakloak to bypass Substitute users like Lampent whilst also ignoring Light Screen and Aurora Veil.</p> <p>Holding the second highest Speed in the metagame, Drakloak enjoys being paired with other pivots like Thwackey, Electabuzz, and Raboot that value momentum and take advantage of statused threats. Slow Pokemon like Gurdurr and Piloswine really benefit from this, as the spread of paralysis allows them to outspeed the general metagame and impose a better offensive presence. Drakloak's biggest downfall is its low damage output, especially against threats that have not been inflicted with status yet, so having multiple Knock Off and Toxic users like Ferroseed, Thwackey, and Mareanie is beneficial to Drakloak, as they allow it to click Hex more liberally. Drakloak isn't particularly bulky either and lacks recovery, which endorses entry hazard damage as one of its downfalls. As such, having Wish passers like Clefairy or Healing Wish users like Hattrem is a good way to keep Drakloak's longevity intact, especially as Hattrem can prevent entry hazards from being set and has a good matchup against Stealth Rock setters like Piloswine that can easily beat Drakloak.

As a result, Drakloak will almost always be able to move first and thus can act as a revenge killer and wallbreaker at the same time. Choice Specs boosts its mediocre Special Attack to acceptable levels and turns Draco Meteor into a powerful attack able to take out weakened foes and punch holes through would-be switch-ins such as Piloswine, Galarian Linoone, and Machoke. Shadow Ball is a more spammable STAB move and targets notable threats including Galarian Corsola, Galarian Mr. Mime, and Hattrem. Fire Blast is Drakloak's best option against Ferroseed and Klang, which otherwise fear little from it. Finally, U-turn eases prediction and allows Drakloak to generate momentum by pivoting into the appropriate teammate depending on the opponent's play. Infiltrator and Clear Body are both useful abilities and the choice between them depends on your preference. The former offers security against Substitute users such as Lampent and screens-based offense teams, whereas the latter improves Drakloak's match up against Sticky Web teams and allows it to play aggressively by switching in against a predicted Mystical Fire or Parting Shot from Hattrem or Galarian Linoone, respectively.</p> <p>Use Drakloak as a revenge killer.

For that reason, Knock Off support from the likes of Gurdurr, Mareanie, and Ferroseed is very useful to get rid of Eviolites. Ferroseed can also set up Spikes, which improves Drakloak's ability to break down walls in tandem with U-turn. Conversely, Drakloak is signifigantly vulnerable to Knock Off itself, and should have partners like Machoke and Golbat that can switch into this attack. Since Drakloak's Special Attack is lackluster, having another wallbreaker is recommended; in this regard, Rufflet, Choice Specs Roselia, and Choice Band Raboot are excellent choices.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Dragapult is one of OU's premier wallbreakers, offensive pivots, and ways of keeping faster foes in check, boasting a near unresisted STAB combination, great coverage options, and a near-unparalleled Speed tier. The latter in particular is a versatile attribute that lets it get past a majority of offensive Pokemon in the tier and take full advantage of its dual STAB combination to sweep weakened teams, easily spread status, or safely pivot with U-turn. This, in addition to its access to Infiltrator, makes it a fantastic answer to more offensively inclined teams, including dual screens archetypes, as switching safely into its Ghost-type STAB attacks is incredibly difficult for them to do without a dedicated answer. Furthermore, its access to a fast U-turn in tandem with its powerful STAB combination lets Dragapult facilitate offensive teammates very well, letting it form incredible cores with a myriad of offensive Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Garchomp. More prominently, most of Dragapult's checks are highly exploitable with U-turn and can easily have progress forced against them, as they either lack reliable recovery or can be overwhelmed in the long run with entry hazard or Knock Off support. Dragapult also wields great coverage options such as Thunderbolt and Flamethrower that let it overwhelm would-be checks such as Mandibuzz, Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Ferrothorn more reliably. However, Dragapult's lack of longevity and only serviceable bulk in spite of its solid defensive typing means that damage it sustains is permanent, leaving it susceptible to long-term pressure from status effects, chip damage from resisted hits, and entry hazards in the case of non-Heavy-Duty Boots variants. Consequently, this can lead to it being picked off by healthy Pokemon, priority, or Choice Scarf users later in the game. For these reasons, it is also incapable of utilizing its Dragon typing to provide long-term defensive utility against prominent targets like Heatran, leading to it needing pivoting support or aggressive doubles to find good opportunities to do its job. Dragapult's Special Attack stat is also only slightly above average, meaning it needs Choice Specs or status to be immediately threatening with its primary STAB attacks or Hex, respectively. Even when boosted, its damage output can be middling, making it reliant on forced switches and prior chip damage to safely damage its targets without risking damage or status against itself.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragapult is able to run a mixed variant of its pivot set utilizing Dragon Darts, being capable of beating Volcarona and pressuring Blissey and Tyranitar while providing reliable damage output without a Special Attack drop. However, donning a mixed variant further divvies Dragapult's middling power by forcing Attack investment and leaves it without the immediate power of Draco Meteor. Most notably, Dragapult is incapable of OHKOing a healthy Garchomp with Dragon Darts. On the other hand, Dragapult is able to take advantage of its great Attack stat and access to Dragon Dance to pierce past weakened teams. However, such a set is difficult to get value with against common Pokemon like Toxapex, Melmetal, and Corviknight, which can outlive its onslaught and dispatch it accordingly, especially against two attack variants. Substitute + Hex variants are also extremely potent at taking advantage of forced switches by easing prediction while spreading status and damage more deliberately, but the loss of U-turn and Speed investment strips Dragapult of its ability to facilitate offensive teammates and keep faster foes in check.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Dragapult's damage output is greatly challenged by special walls like Blissey, Toxapex, Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Clefable. However, in spite of this, Dragapult is easily able to exploit these Pokemon with its access to U-turn, and the latter three can easily be overloaded due to their reliance on being healthy to check Dragapult; additionally, Hex variants can be troublesome to check in spite of this. Tapu Fini and Tyranitar are decent short-term checks but are not reliable in the long run due to a lack of longevity.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Clefable and Tapu Fini are immune to its Draco Meteor and possess the bulk to stomach a Shadow Ball; the latter is also impervious to status due to Misty Surge. However, they can be overwhelmed with the aid of Knock Off support, making it increasingly difficult for them to check Dragapult as the game progresses.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon and coverage</strong>: Bisharp, Mandibuzz, and Tyranitar are common Dark-type Pokemon that resist Dragapult's most spammable option in Shadow Ball. The former, uniquely, is able to resist both of Dragapult's STAB attacks but lacks the bulk to switch into it in the long run, forcing it to rely on pivoting support to reliably keep Dragapult at bay. Mandibuzz and Tyranitar are both very vulnerable to residual damage from Dragapult's U-turn and passive damage; Mandibuzz, particularly, is extremely vulnerable to Knock Off, which can make it an inconsistent check to Dragapult as the game progresses. Knock Off is also a very frequently utilized move that Dragapult is weak to, making it more vulnerable than other offensive Pokemon to stray uses of the move and making it further reliant on pivoting support.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Dragapult's lack of longevity leaves it susceptible to residual damage from entry hazards, status, and resisted hits, which can reduce the utility of its defensive typing and limit switch-in opportunities over the course of the game.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Dragapult is very vulnerable to being revenge killed, since it is reliant on weakened foes or forced switches in order to safely do its job without risk of chip damage or status. However, priority moves from Rillaboom, Bisharp, and Weavile and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Landorus-T are capable of picking off Dragapult without the need of a defensive answer. Zeraora, on the other hand, is simply able to revenge kill it with Knock Off, as it barely eclipses its Speed tier.</p> ",

          "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Specs, Dragapult becomes a menacing wallbreaker that can easily overwhelm a majority of the metagame with its STAB Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball. In particular, Shadow Ball is an incredibly spammable, powerful option that is incredibly hard to switch into without a dedicated answer that is able to handle Dragapult's other options in the long run, like specially defensive Clefable, Toxapex, or Blissey. U-turn allows Dragapult to exploit and safely chip away at its small pool of checks to generate momentum, allowing offensive teammates to either enforce progress or safely wallbreak. Flamethrower is a highly effective coverage option that lets it apply more immediate pressure against targets like Corviknight, Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Alternatively, Dragapult can use Thunderbolt or Thunder to instead pressure would-be checks such as Mandibuzz, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex. Thunder, notably, is capable of more reliably finishing off specially defensive Toxapex at the cost of accuracy and PP. Although a more niche option, Hydro Pump allows Dragapult to further pressure Heatran and beat Hippowdon. Hex is a similarly strong alternative that lets Dragapult overwhelm Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Clefable when they've been statused, but it leaves Dragapult extremely reliant on teammates that can spread status. Dragapult's access to Infiltrator alongside its fantastic Speed tier makes it a great answer to offense teams, wholly disregarding dual screens and Substitute from Pokemon such as Kyurem and Landorus-T, making it the ideal choice over the more situational Clear Body.</p> <p>Dragapult's ability to pivot around Clefable, Tyranitar, and Blissey lets it pair incredibly well with offensive Pokemon that are capable of helping it break past them and remove shared checks. Urshifu-R and Melmetal are incredible examples of great U-turn recipients. The former can use its powerful STAB combination to beat Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Blissey while helping it deal with Tapu Fini and Toxapex. Similarly, Melmetal also takes advantage of U-turn to come in against Clefable and Blissey, and its access to Toxic and Thunder Wave further reinforces Dragapult's wallbreaking potential with Hex. In return, Dragapult is capable of using its Ghost-type STAB and powerful Draco Meteor to hit or pivot against their checks like Slowbro, Tangrowth, Zapdos, and Corviknight. Additionally, Kyurem and Hydreigon can be fantastic in helping Dragapult overwhelm shared Fairy- and Steel-type checks in the form of Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal. They also appreciate Dragapult's ability to pivot against Pokemon like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon to find critical wallbreaking opportunities. Heatran is another U-turn recipient that is capable of trapping Toxapex, Clefable, and Blissey with Magma Storm or setting Stealth Rock. Dragapult also greatly appreciates Knock Off support in order to strip checks like Clefable and Tapu Fini of Leftovers recovery while leaving others like Mandibuzz and Blissey more vulnerable to entry hazards. Ferrothorn is a solid option that can target foes like Heatran with Knock Off to create progress for Dragapult and is also capable of setting entry hazards. Additionally, Kartana is an incredible, more offensively inclined Knock Off user that benefits from Dragapult's U-turn, easily ripping past Dragapult's checks like Gastrodon, Clefable, and Hippowdon with its high Attack, STAB attacks, and coverage. Landorus-T's access to Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Knock Off makes it capable of targeting and pressuring shared checks in the form of Mandibuzz and Tapu Fini while hitting Toxapex super effectively and providing Dragapult with both a Zeraora switch-in and pivoting support. Landorus-T also appreciates Dragapult's ability to provide it with a safe entry against Pokemon like Tyranitar and Blissey, which it can easily exploit to enforce progress with its utility.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Dragapult's access to status, U-turn, and STAB Hex makes it a potent disruptor and pivot capable of sweeping past chipped down teams. Additionally, its blistering Speed tier alongside U-turn lets it operate as a superb check to fast Pokemon on offensively inclined teams, being able to take advantage of forced switches with ease to generate momentum or force progress with status. Dragapult's choice of status condition is highly dependent on the needs of its team, as well as what it wishes to target. Thunder Wave typically is the preferred option, as it is capable of punishing and crippling most of Dragapult's checks, including Clefable and situationally Heatran while slowing down fast offensive Pokemon like Tornadus-T for its teammates. Will-O-Wisp, however, can be a great option that takes advantage of and ruins the value of physical attackers while negating Leftovers recovery of Hippowdon and Gastrodon and forcing passive damage on Mandibuzz. Dragapult's vulnerability to entry hazards as an offensive pivot makes it a great user of Heavy-Duty Boots, enabling it to more reliably generate momentum in the long term. Lastly, Infiltrator lets Dragapult wholly disregard dual screens and Substitute and more freely force damage and inflict status on hyper offense builds. Access to Infiltrator also allows Dragapult to disregard Safeguard Volcarona and reliably paralyze it.</p> <p>Dragapult's ability to check faster Pokemon and facilitate offensive teammates with its access to status, fast U-turn, and ability to invite in its exploitable checks makes it a phenomenal pick on balance teams. Likewise, it also appreciates offensive teammates that are able to help it handle its checks due to its relative lack of immediate power. For example, Urshifu-R is a superb teammate that highly appreciates Dragapult's ability to slow down or weaken fast, offensive threats such as Kartana and Tornadus-T while also being able to take heavy advantage of Dragapult checks like Tyranitar and Blissey for wallbreaking opportunities. Additionally, Urshifu-R is capable of pivoting against Pokemon like Slowbro and Tangrowth to give Dragapult more opportunities to spread status. Kartana, similarly, heavily appreciates Dragapult's ability to cripple potential checks while providing it with safe switch in against Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Blissey. Thunder Wave also allows Kartana to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon like Weavile, improving its cleaning potential in the long run. Access to Knock Off can also allow Kartana to enforce progress for Dragapult and leave its checks more vulnerable to entry hazards and chip damage. Garchomp is a great offensive partner that likes having checks in Corviknight and mixed Clefable dispatched by Thunder Wave, exploits Toxapex, and takes great advantage of Dragapult's pivoting abilities while helping it deal with Clefable, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon more effectively. Landorus-T is also a great partner that can utilize both Knock Off and Stealth Rock to enforce progress for Dragapult while providing a solid switch-in against Zeraora, which may attempt to revenge kill it otherwise if it has sustained any chip damage. Lastly, Dragapult's ability to compress roles with its Speed tier to offensive check fast Pokemon, status, and cleaning make it a good fit on more defensively inclined teams alongside the aforementioned Landorus-T and allies such as Clefable and Ferrothorn that are similarly able to spread item removal and set entry hazards.</p> "

          "description": "<p>With its blistering speed, solid offensive stats, and vast arsenal of moves to choose from, Dragapult serves as a powerful revenge killer and wallbreaker on Dragon teams. Few foes can withstand its Choice Specs-boosted STAB moves in Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball, and those that do are likely to feel threatened by its coverage moves in Thunderbolt and Fire Blast. Thunderbolt can take on foes such as Corviknight and Toxapex, while Fire Blast is great for checking Steel-types like Ferrothorn. Dragapult can also opt to use U-turn over Fire Blast as a means to pivot out of unfavorable matchups, such as against Grimmsnarl and Tyranitar. Infiltrator is often Dragapult's ability of choice in order to bypass Substitute users, though Clear Body also has its merits in preventing Sticky Web from dropping its Speed.</p> <p>Despite being a powerful pressure tool in the face of many Pokemon, Dragapult is rather frail and has a poor defensive typing. Against threatening attackers such as Grimmsnarl and Mimikyu, Duraludon partners well with Dragapult, as it threatens them with Flash Cannon. Conversely, teammates such as Hydreigon and Kommo-o can offensively threaten the various Dark-, Dragon-, Ghost-, and even some Ice-types that would otherwise take advantage of Dragapult's frail nature. Hydreigon especially has a unique dynamic with Dragapult, as the former resists priority that would normally threaten Dragapult such as Shadow Sneak from Aegislash and Sucker Punch from Bisharp, while the latter is immune to the priority that Hydreigon is threatened by, such as Extreme Speed or Vacuum Wave from Lucario. This synergy, when combined with their raw power can dominate Steel teams. Dracovish and Dracozolt use their insane physical prowess and incredible STAB moves to assist Dragapult in creating a terrifying wallbreaking core that is capable of 2HKOing the entire metagame. Noivern assists Dragapult through its ability to remove entry hazards.</p> "

Draco Meteor is its most powerful STAB move and allows it to revenge kill threats such as Choice Scarf Duraludon and Choice Scarf Charizard. Shadow Ball allows Dragapult to revenge kill Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gardevoir and Gengar. Fire Blast lets it hit Steel- and Ice-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Alolan Ninetales, and Galarian Darmanitan for super effective damage. U-turn allows Dragapult to pick up momentum when it forces a switch. Clear Body is the preferred ability, as it allows Dragapult to take on Sticky Web teams easier and lets it still revenge kill threats such as Zeraora and Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Alternatively, Infiltrator allows it to hit through Substitutes and screens, making matchups such as Ice easier. The 4 Defense EVs enable Dragapult to always take a +2 Ice Shard from Jolly Cloyster when at full HP.</p> <p>All of Dragapult's teammates appreciate its ability to act as a revenge killer, especially in matchups where Dragon teams can struggle such as against Fairy and Electric teams. Hydreigon can take on Steel-type Pokemon with Fire Blast that Dragapult struggles to break, such as Bisharp and Corviknight, taking some pressure off Dragapult and forming an anti Psychic- and Ghost-type core that deals with Pokemon like Aegislash. Choice Scarf Duraludon forms a speed control core with Dragapult, can set up Stealth Rock, and take on Fairy-type Pokemon such as Grimmsnarl and Togekiss that Dragapult struggles to break. Kommo-o can also set up Stealth Rock and check Tyranitar and Snorlax, Pokemon that would otherwise wall Dragapult's attacks. Defog Noivern can clear hazards for Infiltrator Dragapult. Kommo-o and Noivern can also use Taunt to prevent foes from recovering HP or setting hazards, which is especially useful in matchups against Cloyster. Noivern also forms a U-turn core with Dragapult, being able to generate momentum for the team. Dracovish and Dracozolt are strong wallbreakers that can take advantage of slower Pokemon thanks to their signature moves, Fishous Rend and Bolt Beak, allowing them to take on Hippowdon and Toxapex, respectively.</p> "

Using coverage along with its STAB attacks, it's able to take advantage of various matchups like Steel, Water, Dragon, and Ground. Fire Blast, Flamethrower, and Thunderbolt hit Steel- and Water-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Corviknight, Gyarados, and Toxapex for super effective damage. Fire Blast is preferred in order to deal greater damage against Corviknight, while Flamethrower can be used for the consistency. Infiltrator can be used for Substitute users such as Whimsicott and Hydreigon, while Clear Body is useful against teams that carry Sticky Web. Dragapult should generally try to find opportunities where it can wallbreak with little drawback, which is easy to do with its high Speed.</p> <p>Dragapult pairs well with offensive Pokemon such as Polteageist, Gengar, Mimikyu, and Aegislash to break past shared checks and sweep teams. For example, Mimikyu can work together with Dragapult to beat Dragon, while Polteageist and Dragapult can both pose a huge threat to Water. Choice Scarf Gengar can outspeed other Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Excadrill that Dragapult dislikes dealing with, and Aegislash appreciates Dragapult's early- to mid-game wallbreaking so that it can try to sweep teams late-game and can cover some of Dragapult's weaknesses using its Steel typing. Dragapult also appreciates defensive Pokemon such as Runerigus, Galarian Corsola, and Sableye. The former two can lay down entry hazards for it to have an easier time wallbreaking and serve as good pivots for Dragapult, while Sableye itself can use Knock Off, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp to soften up opposing teams. Froslass is a useful partner for Dragapult because of its ability to set Spikes, allowing it to wallbreak more efficiently, and its ability to deny opposing hazards with Taunt.</p> "

Draco Meteor is Dragapult's strongest attack that hits a variety of neutral targets hard while also being particularly useful for beating Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Duraludon, and Hydreigon. Shadow Ball hits Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Gengar, Mimikyu, Gardevoir, and Hatterene for super effective damage, making Dragapult great in the Ghost mirror matchup in particular. Fire Blast allows Dragapult to revenge kill Steel-, Ice-, and Grass-type Pokemon such as Excadrill, Weavile, and Venusaur with more ease. U-turn is amazing for grabbing momentum against forced switches or against bulky Pokemon such as Corviknight, Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Toxapex that give Dragapult trouble. Infiltrator is the preferred ability, as it allows Dragapult to revenge kill Substitute users such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon effectively as well as ignoring Aurora Veil and dual screens from Pokemon such as Alolan Ninetales and Grimmsnarl, allowing Dragapult to revenge kill Pokemon with more ease on their respective types. 4 EVs in Defense ensure that it never gets OHKOed by Jolly Cloyster's +2 Ice Shard.</p> <p>Galarian Corsola is an excellent teammate because of its ability to set Stealth Rock as well as serve as a defensive pivot for Dragapult. Stealth Rock is particularly good for putting Pokemon such as Weavile, Choice Scarf Charizard, Alolan Ninetales, and Chandelure in range of Dragapult's attacks as well as breaking Focus Sash against Pokemon such as Cloyster and Dugtrio. Chandelure is a good partner for Dragapult because of its ability to break down bulkier Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash and Corviknight with its strong Fire STAB attacks as well as use Substitute to take on Sucker Punch users such as Bisharp and Shiftry. Choice Specs Gengar and Aegislash are both wallbreakers that can beat bulky Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Toxapex as well as take on Fairy-types like Togekiss and Clefable for Dragapult. Swords Dance Aegislash can also beat Pokemon like Tyranitar and Snorlax for Dragapult. Mimikyu and Dragapult work together to take on Dragon teams effectively with their super effective coverage while Mimikyu can also beat Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Mandibuzz for it. Froslass is a decent teammate on hyper offensive teams because of its ability to use Taunt on Sticky Web setters such as Galvantula and Araquanid that hinder Dragapult's revenge killing capabilities as well as use Spikes to continuously wear down teams in conjunction with Dragapult's ability to force switches and grab momentum with U-turn.</p> "

Dragon Dance allows Dragapult to OHKO threats such as Diggersby and Zeraora and 2HKO Toxapex with Dragon Darts after a single boost as well as outspeed Adamant Excadrill in sand and Kingdra in the rain, and after using Dragon Dance twice, it can outspeed Hawlucha after Unburden. Dragon Darts is its main STAB attack and can severely dent any Pokemon that does not resist it. Phantom Force hits Pokemon that resist Dragon Darts such as Excadrill and Hatterene. Substitute allows Dragapult to avoid status moves from Pokemon such as Toxapex and grants it more opportunities to set up Dragon Dance. Sucker Punch can be used to gain an advantage over opposing Dragon Dance Dragapult and attack before Cinderace's Sucker Punch, Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak, and Rillaboom's Grassy Slide. Dragon Fang notably allows Dragon Darts to OHKO offensive Volcarona, but Leftovers is an option that gives Dragapult more opportunities to set up Substitute. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs alongside an Adamant nature allow Dragapult to move as fast and strike hard. 4 Defense EVs allow it to always survive +2 Jolly Cloyster's Ice Shard.</p> <p>Galarian Corsola is the best partner Dragon Dance Dragapult can ask for many reasons; the first is its ability to set Stealth Rock up, allowing Dragapult to serve as a setup sweeper more effectively. It can also cripple physical attackers such as Urshifu-S with Will-O-Wisp alongside Strength Sap, potentially provide Dragapult free turns to set up Dragon Dance through Cursed Body, and serve as a general physical pivot into Pokemon such as Cinderace for Dragapult. Mimikyu forms a physical setup core with Dragapult, as it can take on Dark- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, Urshifu-S, and Terrakion for Dragapult with its STAB and coverage moves in Play Rough and Drain Punch as well as revenge kill Pokemon such as Hatterene under Trick Room thanks to its ability Disguise. Aegislash provides a specially defensive wall that can pivot into Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-type attacks such as Duraludon's Draco Meteor, Primarina's Moonblast, and Avalugg's Avalanche thanks to its Steel typing. It can also act as a Choice Specs wallbreaker or physical setup sweeper, allowing it to take on Pokemon like Corviknight and Chansey for Dragapult. Dragapult appreciates Choice Specs Gengar's ability to punch holes in walls such as Mandibuzz, Galarian Weezing, Skarmory, and Tyranitar with its coverage moves. Choice Scarf Gengar, on the other hand, can act as a revenge killer against Pokemon such as Zeraora for unboosted Dragapult. Jellicent can, like Galarian Corsola, cripple physical walls with Strength Sap and Will-O-Wisp while also preventing slower Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex from setting entry hazards with Taunt. Alolan Marowak and Chandelure most simply can break through Steel-type Pokemon for Dragapult. Substitute Chandelure, in particular, can take on Pokemon, such as Bisharp, while Alolan Marowak is a strong Swords Dance attacker able to soften physically defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Braviary for Dragapult to sweep more easily.</p> "

      "overview": "<p>Dragapult is useful on a wide variety of teams for its great typing and Speed. Its Dragon / Ghost typing lets it switch into Pokemon like Kartana, Urshifu-R, and Heatran. It's also a great offensive typing, as Ghost-type moves are virtually unresisted in the metagame bar Pokemon like Incineroar and Porygon2, and Dragon-type moves hit many important targets like Kyurem-B and Zygarde. Its Speed allows it to outpace the vast majority of the unboosted metagame. These qualities allow it to handle many great Pokemon like the aforementioned Kartana, Urshifu-R, and Zygarde, along with other Pokemon like Rillaboom and Necrozma. Its Choice Specs set can apply pressure instantly, while conversely, its Dragon Dance set can end a game outright if given the freedom to set up. However, Dragapult is heavily relies on its Speed, and its lack of bulk can give it trouble with speed control and switching in. Both sets can also feel underwhelming at times, as the Choice Specs set has to make use of Dragapult's mere base 100 Special Attack, while the Dragon Dance set is reliant on getting boosts to become threatening and lacks reliable STAB moves. As a result, it can struggle to break bulkier Pokemon like Porygon2 and Amoonguss, and it falls easily to faster attackers like Choice Scarf Genesect and Dragon Dance-boosted Kyurem-B. Dragapult also loathes Tapu Fini, as Misty Terrain severely limits Dragapult's offensive pressure, and Tapu Fini can OHKO it after minimal chip. This weakness to Tapu Fini makes Kartana and Rillaboom prime partners for the drake. Kartana can counteract opposing speed control with Tailwind, and Rillaboom can change the Terrain and provide openings for Dragapult to set up via Fake Out. Blastoise is a good partner for the Dragon Dance set, as it packs both Fake Out and Follow Me. Diancie is also another good partner for Dragapult, as it handles Kyurem-B and Incineroar well.</p> ",

Behemoth Blade is preferred over Play Rough for preventing Pokemon such as Yveltal and Groudon from effectively using Dynamax defensively against Zacian-C while also reliably OHKOing Xerneas. Wild Charge OHKOes specially defensive Yveltal after minimal chip damage, deals with Ho-Oh, and devastates Kyogre. Close Combat provides good coverage for Ferrothorn and 2HKOes a weakened Necrozma-DM. Assurance deals great damage to Zacian-C's most reliable check in Necrozma-DM if it switches in while Stealth Rock or Spikes is on the field and prevents Lunala from reliably checking it. Zacian-C can alternatively run Swords Dance, boosting its already terrific Attack to break through physically defensive walls such as Zygarde-C, Giratina, and Necrozma-DM. However, this makes Zacian-C and its team more vulnerable to Ditto. Play Rough is also a decent pick, letting Zacian-C defeat Zygarde-C, Zekrom, and Giratina.

Xerneas also forms a great offensive core with Zacian-C; Xerneas is able to stall out Dynamax turns from Necrozma-DM with Substitute and 2HKO it with Thunder at +2, leaving it weakened so Zacian-C can KO it. In return, Zacian-C can take care of Ferrothorn. Gothitelle is another noteworthy pick on balance teams, as Zacian-C can lure in Necrozma-DM so Gothitelle can trap it and PP stall it.</p> "

Behemoth Blade is the preferred STAB move, since it's stronger and 100% accurate and deals more damage to Dynamaxed Pokemon than Play Rough. Wild Charge is essential coverage for targets like defensive Ho-Oh, Arceus-Water, and Primal Kyogre that resist Behemoth Blade. Close Combat destroys Ferrothorn and heavily dents Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon, two of Zacian-C's best switch-ins. Swords Dance allows Zacian-C to sweep once the opposition is weakened and revenge killers like Ditto have been eliminated, while also forcing the Dynamax from Necrozma-DM in order to beat it. Assurance along with Close Combat takes out Necrozma-DM on the switch after Stealth Rock damage. Crunch is an option over Assurance in order to still pressure Necrozma-DM when entry hazards are not present. Although Crunch hits said foe for the same damage as Close Combat, it has a chance of a Defense drop and doesn't lower Zacian-C's own defenses, which can be vital in preventing Necrozma-DM from reliably switching in to Zacian-C multiple times. It also targets defensive Lunala harder than Assurance and lets Zacian-C avoid a mind game with Ultra Necrozma. Substitute may be used to ease prediction against common counterplay to Zacian-C, and works particularly well due to Zacian-C's tendency to force a plethora of switches. Notably, it also shields Zacian-C from Ditto. Protect is useful for scouting Ditto and stalling out foes' Dynamax turns. Play Rough can be used in the fourth moveslot to break through defensive Zygarde-C, which checks Zacian-C otherwise. A Jolly nature is preferred with Swords Dance, as it can be used to Speed tie with opposing Zacian-C and outspeed Mega Mewtwo Y and +1 Necrozma-DM. Otherwise, an Adamant nature is preferred for the extra damage output, which notably allows Zacian-C to 2HKO defensive Arceus-Ground after little to no prior chip damage, and to put more pressure on Necrozma-DM.</p> <p>Ho-Oh is one of the best teammates for Zacian-C, as it checks Arceus-Ground and can scout Ditto fairly reliably. A good check to Primal Groudon like Arceus-Water, Arceus-Ground, defensive Zygarde-C, or Mega Rayquaza is appreciated, as it's one of the few Pokemon that can switch into Zacian-C and force it out. Wallbreakers like Primal Kyogre, Geomancy Xerneas, Mega Rayquaza, and Yveltal can help to break down checks like Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, and Ho-Oh, allowing Zacian-C to clean up late-game. Ferrothorn can switch into support Arceus formes and provide Spikes support, helping Zacian-C to pick up on more KOs. Ditto is Zacian-C's greatest nemesis, so setup sweepers that beat it like Yveltal, Arceus-Ghost, and Zygarde-C are appreciated, and cores that can pivot around a Ditto that has copied Zacian-C like Ho-Oh + Primal Groudon + Necrozma-DM are helpful.</p> "

Additionally, it effectively bypasses the effects of Dynamax, threatening foes such as Groudon, Zekrom, and Reshiram. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb has higher PP, can poison foes, and punishes Xerneas for switching in. It sacrifices Dynamax Cannon's coverage and ability to threaten Groudon. Dragon Tail can be used to phaze and deter Gothitelle, as well as setup sweepers such as Zekrom and Calm Mind Kyogre, but is fairly weak. Flamethrower nails Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Ferrothorn. Mystical Fire is a slightly weaker alternative that limits Calm Mind Kyogre for a good while alongside Toxic, heavily annoys Geomancy Xerneas seeking to set up, and generally weakens special attackers such as opposing Eternatus and offensive Yveltal. Toxic is most useful when running Dynamax Cannon, crippling Ho-Oh, bulky Yveltal, and Lunala, while also forcing Calm Mind Kyogre to use Rest. Toxic Spikes can situationally be devastating, especially against hyper offensive teams, as it puts sweepers like Calyrex-S, Xerneas, Zekrom, and Groudon on timers.

However, Eternatus's own popularity spells doom for the overall effectiveness of Toxic Spikes, and common Pokemon in Zacian-C, Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn are naturally immune to the move. Recover with Pressure lets Eternatus outlast every passive Pokemon in the metagame, including staples such as defensive Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh. The given EV spread maximizes Eternatus's special bulk while outpacing Adamant Marshadow.</p> <p>Eternatus is close to mandatory on most balance teams, as it's by far the best status absorber and the most reliable long-term check to Kyogre and Necrozma-DM. Pokemon that are weak to Kyogre such as Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Zygarde-C generally make for good teammates. Yveltal is a required teammate, being the only decent check to the hugely threatening Calyrex-S. Necrozma-DM can take on Zacian-C, a big threat to Eternatus. It also forms an entry hazard stacking core with Toxic Spikes Eternatus. Lunala is capable of taking on boosted Zekrom, Zygarde-C, and the extremely dangerous Groudon. In return, Eternatus can serve as a status absorber against the likes of Ho-Oh and opposing Eternatus. As Eternatus is easily capable of switching into defensive Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, bulky Yveltal, and Ferrothorn in the long run, Pokemon checked by them such as Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, and Kyogre make for great teammates.</p> "

Dynamax Cannon is a powerful STAB move that 2HKOes most Pokemon that don't resist it and hits Dynamaxed Pokemon twice as hard. Flamethrower targets Steel-types such as Zacian-C, Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn that resist Eternatus's main STAB move. Sludge Bomb OHKOes Xerneas, preventing it from setting up on Eternatus, and has a significant chance to poison foes. Alternatively, Meteor Beam allows Eternatus to punish Ho-Oh seeking to pivot into it, while also making Eternatus progressively harder to deal with due to the Special Attack boost. Recover lets Eternatus offset Life Orb recoil and take advantage of most Pokemon that can't 2HKO it, including walls like Ho-Oh, Ferrothorn, and support Arceus formes besides Arceus-Ground. It's also useful in tandem with Pressure to quickly drain the PP of opposing Pokemon. Life Orb gives Eternatus maximum wallbreaking power, letting it 2HKO support Arceus formes and specially defensive Primal Groudon after a small amount of chip damage, for example. Alternatively, Power Herb may be chosen if Meteor Beam is used, to allow Eternatus to OHKO Ho-Oh without letting Ho-Oh switch out.

These traits allow it to wall almost the entire defensive metagame, as well as Primal Kyogre, Calm Mind Arceus-Water, and Yveltal that has Dynamaxed. Toxic Spikes allows Eternatus to take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn, providing incredibly useful support by putting almost all grounded Pokemon on a timer. Moreover, the status ailment also forces Arceus formes into using Refresh and the likes of defensive Zygarde-C and Primal Groudon into using Rest, forcing the opponent to forfeit momentum. Eternatus notably walls every single relevant Defogger in the metagame, even being capable of outstalling Arceus-Ground's Judgment PP, which allows it to independently secure the entry hazard game in longer matches by stalling Defoggers out of Defog PP. Flamethrower lets Eternatus pressure Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Necrozma-DM that could otherwise take advantage of it by setting entry hazards, while also deterring Zacian-C from switching into it. Toxic pressures and forces out Pokemon that could otherwise stay in indefinitely on it, such as non-Refresh Arceus formes and Ho-Oh, while also punishing switch-ins that could otherwise take advantage of it, such as Zygarde-C and Mega Rayquaza. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb allows Eternatus to punish Mega Rayquaza, Yveltal, Xerneas, and Mega Mewtwo Y more effectively if they try to switch in while still sporting a high chance to poison Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes. Black Sludge gives Eternatus a form of passive recovery, which helps it more reliably outlast Primal Kyogre and support Arceus-Ground. Alternatively, Firium Z can be used in order to OHKO Zacian-C as it uses Behemoth Blade or switches in. If Firium Z is used, the alternative EV spread of 192 HP / 76 SpA / 196 SpD / 44 Spe must be used to guarantee the OHKO on Zacian-C. Shed Shell can also be used in order to avoid trapping from Perish Song + Whirlpool support Arceus formes, Mega Gengar, and Gothitelle, allowing Eternatus to completely wall them. The given EV spread maximizes special bulk while outspeeding Primal Kyogre.</p> <p>Eternatus fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate a reliable check to Primal Kyogre and useful Toxic Spikes support for breakers. Pokemon like Mega Rayquaza, Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, Calm Mind Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Yveltal especially appreciate Toxic Spikes, since their most common checks are grounded and will thus be on a timer from the moment they come in. Eternatus greatly appreciates a reliable check to Primal Groudon, especially Rest variants, which can otherwise threaten it with near-impunity. As such, defensive Zygarde-C and Arceus-Water both pair well with it. Eternatus is typically forced out by a wide range of offensive threats including Zacian-C, Mega Rayquaza, Xerneas, Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, Mega Mewtwo Y, opposing Life Orb Eternatus, Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, and the likes of Yveltal and Kyogre under Dynamax. A strong backbone that can cover these threats is therefore crucial. Necrozma-DM goes a long way in forming one by hard checking Zacian-C and soft checking Mega Rayquaza, Xerneas, and Mega Mewtwo Y. In return, it appreciates Eternatus's ability to PP stall Defoggers. The likes of Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Dark, and Tyranitar are all capable of easing the matchup against both Mega Rayquaza and Yveltal, with the former two also checking Dragon Dance Zygarde-C and the latter taking care of Life Orb Eternatus. Lunala and Chansey are interesting options to consider as well; Lunala hard checks Mega Rayquaza, Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, while Thunder Wave Chansey limits Xerneas, Life Orb Eternatus, and Calm Mind Kyogre.</p> "

It can even overwhelm and take advantage of defensive cores made of bulky Water-types like Slowking and Tapu Fini with ease. It has incredibly strong priority in its STAB Choice Band-boosted Aqua Jet, making it effective at revenge killing weakened faster foes like boosted Volcarona. Its STAB moves, while strong, are resisted by common walls such as Toxapex and Slowbro, which limits it as a wallbreaker in certain matchups. However, it can gain momentum by pivoting out of these into offensive teammates like Kartana and Tapu Koko for additional pressure. Urshifu-R only uses contact moves, so Surging Strikes can cause almost 50% in self-damage against Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet users like Toxapex and Corviknight, making them able to consistently wear it down; in addition, Static from Zapdos can be extremely limiting.

However, its lack of initial power, pivoting, and priority takes away a lot of Urshifu-R's normal strengths. A Protective Pads with four attacks set can also be used, letting Urshifu-R freely pivot with U-turn and use Surging Strikes without fear of contact effects. The power drop is massive, though, noticeably making it ineffective at breaking through Pokemon like Corviknight and Skarmory immediately, limiting it as a wallbreaker overall.

U-turn lets Urshifu-R keep up momentum on defensive switch-ins and provide wallbreaking opportunities for its teammates. Choice Band allows it to 2HKO many pivots such as Slowking, Skarmory, and Corviknight. A Jolly nature allows Urshifu-R to outspeed and revenge kill Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem, and Landorus-T at the cost of some power.

Ice Punch can be used over Aqua Jet, giving it a very hard hit on Dragon-types trying to pivot into and scout it such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Dragapult.

Heatran in particular appreciates free switch in from U-turn to fire off Magma Storm and trap foes, and, as Dragon- and Water-types commonly come into Heatran, this chips them down for Urshifu-R to break. Dragapult can invite Pokemon like Blissey and Mandibuzz that Urshifu-R can pressure, and together they can remove shared checks such as Tapu Fini, forming a terrifying wallbreaking core.

Its Speed enables it to outspeed common Pokemon such as Nihilego and Thundurus-T, and its good bulk and defensive typing let it check many dangerous threats such as Crawdaunt and Krookodile. The ability to heal status conditions and HP with Jungle Healing can allow Zarude to consistently pivot around defensive Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Aegislash. However, it often struggles to break defensive Pokemon, such as Celesteela, Buzzwole, and Salamence, due to them resisting Power Whip and taking minimal damage from Darkest Lariat. Zarude also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, potentially having to give up an important coverage move or the ability to heal off status conditions. Also, many teams run many Pokemon with a Grass-type resistance such as Kommo-o, Tangrowth, and Moltres, leaving Zarude with limited opportunities to click its strongest STAB attack. If it is running Choice Scarf, Zarude can risk being locked into an undesirable move, losing momentum. Flame Body from Moltres and Rocky Helmet from Amoonguss and Tangrowth can punish U-turn, forcing momentum to be sacrificed to use Jungle Healing.</p> ",
      "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Band allows Zarude to function as a powerful wallbreaker. However, the lack of Speed from Choice Scarf and increased prediction-reliance are problematic, and it still struggles to break through Buzzwole, Kommo-o, and Salamence. A Bulk Up set with Jungle Healing, Power Whip, and Darkest Lariat allows Zarude to deal heavy damage and potentially tank super effective hits. However, it has no room for any coverage moves, so it is still not capable of breaking through checks like Tangrowth and Buzzwole. Psychic Seed alongside Bulk Up + Synthesis on Psychic Terrain teams allows it to be a fantastic Krookodile counter, greatly benefiting its teammates by allowing them to spam their Psychic-type moves more easily. Zarude can also become a better setup sweeper by taking hits from Salamence and Tangrowth more easily. Taunt is an option that can completely shut down Chansey's recovery and prevent Roost from Salamence, but Zarude would have to give up Jungle Healing or valuable coverage. Encore on Choice Scarf sets can be used to punish setup sweepers such as Galarian Moltres and Dragon Dance Salamence so that a teammate such as Mamoswine can safely switch in and threaten them. However, it is very situational, and Zarude is forced to switch afterwards.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fast U-turn Users: Faster Pokemon such as Noivern and Choice Scarf Mienshao are able to put Zarude in a tough spot. It either has to take heavy damage from U-turn, or switch out, meaning that Noivern and Mienshao can pivot freely.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth take little damage from Zarude's STAB attacks, while Tapu Bulu resists both. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can threaten Zarude out with Sludge Bomb, with Tapu Bulu threatening it out with Close Combat, or set up on it with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Salamence, Moltres, and Galarian Moltres can switch into Zarude's attacks easily. Salamence can weaken Zarude's hits with Intimidate, Moltres can threaten a burn with Flame Body, and Galarian Moltres resists both STAB attacks. They all must watch out for Rock Slide, though.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types can often check Zarude, due to the Grass-type resistance and good bulk. Cobalion only fears the rare Close Combat and can nail Zarude with super effective damage, while Celesteela can potentially set up on Zarude with Autotomize.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Kommo-o, Buzzwole, and Salamence all take minimal damage from Zarude's STAB attacks, with the former two resisting both.

Choice Specs boosts Regieleki's decent Special Attack to greater heights, making its attacks harder to tank.</p> <p>Tapu Koko is a crucial teammate, as it provides Regieleki with Electric Terrain, which further boosts the power of its moves—especially Rising Voltage. Tapu Koko can also deal with Dragon- and Dark-type Pokemon for Regieleki such as Garchomp and Hydreigon as well as Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon with Grass Knot. Teammates like Zeraora and Alolan Raichu greatly benefit from Regieleki's wallbreaking capabilities, as it's able to blow past Pokemon that check those two such as defensive Zapdos, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, Blissey, and specially defensive Drapion. In return, Zeraora provides Knock Off support and can use its Choice Band set to form a wallbreaking core with Regieleki. Alolan Raichu, on the other hand, can capitalize on Regieleki's wallbreaking ability to clean teams late-game and take care of Ground-type Pokemon like Gastrodon, Swampert, and Hippowdon with Grass Knot, which Regieleki dislikes facing. Rotom-W and Zapdos provide a good defensive backbone and pair of Ground immunities for Regieleki to rely on while also providing Defog support to keep it healthy and not slowed down by Sticky Web. Defensive Zapdos with Static also checks problematic Pokemon like Grassy Glide Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu for Regieleki and takes care of them with Heat Wave. Air Balloon Magnezone can trap and beat certain checks to Regieleki such as Ferrothorn and Choice item Excadrill.</p> "

Regidrago's average-to-good bulk and Dragon typing lend it many setup opportunities against bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune, but also against passive walls like Registeel. However, even after a boost, Regidrago is slower than every common Choice Scarf user. The Speed raise from Scale Shot can prevent Choice Scarf users from revenge killing Regidrago after setup, but it's inconsistent due to its variability in power. After a Dragon Dance, Thunder Fang 2HKOes even bulky Togekiss. Substitute helps Regidrago set up by blocking Scald burns and Toxic. The passive recovery from Leftovers means Regidrago can use Substitute many more times throughout a battle. An Adamant nature is preferable to ensure the 2HKO on Togekiss with Thunder Fang after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Try as it might, Regidrago can't break through Steelix, Galarian Weezing, Sylveon, and Doublade. Luckily, Toxtricity can pick up the slack and blow past each one with relative ease. Fighting-types such as Guts Heracross, Bewear, and Pangoro can overwhelm Sylveon and Galarian Weezing while breaking Steelix and Doublade. Mienshao, Darmanitan, and Incineroar can safely switch Regidrago into the battlefield with U-turn. Darmanitan and Incineroar synergize particularly well with Regidrago, as they can bring it in against bulky Water-types for a setup opportunity. Disguised as Regidrago, Zoroark can lure Galarian Weezing, Sylveon, Steelix, and Doublade with coverage moves in Extrasensory, Sludge Bomb, and Flamethrower. Dragon Dance Regidrago fits well on dual screens hyper offense teams, as it can get multiple boosts with ease thanks to its titanic bulk under dual screens. One notable Pokemon commonly seen on dual screens hyper offense is Cloyster; after a Shell Smash, it can OHKO both Doublade and Galarian Weezing with Hydro Pump.

The Speed raise also makes it harder to revenge kill with faster threats like Noivern and Cobalion. Hammer Arm is Regidrago's best move to hit Diancie as well as Steel-types such as Steelix and Registeel. Thunder Fang is a near-guaranteed 2HKO on max HP Togekiss. Explosion is an alternative over either Outrage or Scale Shot, as it opens the door for Regidrago's teammates by either severely weakening or outright KOing Togekiss, Sylveon, or Galarian Weezing.

However, Glastrier's positives are offset by its atrocious defensive typing and glacial Speed, which mean it will typically only get a few chances to check threats per game and requires significant team support to shine. High Horsepower complements Glastrier's Ice STAB by hitting Steel- and Fire-types like Cobalion, Metagross, and Darmanitan.

Heavy-Duty Boots makes Glastrier significantly less reliant on entry hazard removers, but Leftovers is an alternative on teams with solid hazard removal.

Any of the given options can be mixed and matched to cover specific threats.</p> <p>Glastrier teams are often forced to run at least a few Pokemon with middling Speed, so reliable Speed control and revenge killers are required. Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Flygon as well as priority users like Golisopod, Durant, and Choice Band Metagross can remedy this issue. Mienshao and Zarude can also pivot on Flying-type switch-ins like Crobat and Togekiss for Glastrier to take advantage of. Similarly, Electric-types like Raikou and Xurkitree can scare out Water-types and lure in Ground-types for Glastrier. Togekiss pairs well with Glastrier, patching up its crippling Fighting-type weakness and can provide Wish and cleric support. In return, Glastrier can weaken Steel-types and ease the pressure on Togekiss to check Sharpedo and Flygon. Bulky Water-types like Milotic, Suicune, and Golisopod are Glastrier's biggest roadblocks, so Pokemon that take advantage of them like Raikou, Roserade, and Toxicroak are necessary. Spikes or Toxic Spikes from the likes of Golisopod, Roserade, and Dragalge can also help wear them down. Water-types of your own like Starmie, Volcanion, and Golisopod can serve as Fire- and Steel-type checks, with the former two providing entry hazard removal and Golisopod providing priority. Dedicated hazard removal is necessary if running Leftovers, so Pokemon like Togekiss, Noivern, and Volcanion synergize well with Glastrier.</p> "

Spectrier can also take advantage of Water and Ground teams, which lack good switch-ins to Will-O-Wisp + Hex. It can use passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Slowking, and Slowbro to set up with Substitute + Calm Mind, and it has good utility in Will-O-Wisp, which can force out physical attackers such as Garchomp and walls like Celesteela. However, Spectrier has very limited coverage, which makes it unable to take on Dark- and Normal-types such as Tyranitar and Porygon2.

Substitute blocks status from Pokemon like Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Heatran as well as Leech Seed from Celesteela and Ferrothorn, and is very good to use on predicted switches against Pokemon that fear Will-O-Wisp like Garchomp and Dragonite. Will-O-Wisp is primarily used on physical attackers such as Mamoswine, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Tapu Bulu, but it can be useful together with Hex to 2HKO walls such as Celesteela, Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Swampert. It also allows Spectrier to set up Substitute against defensive Tornadus-T's Knock Off and Mandibuzz's Foul Play. Hex goes well with Will-O-Wisp, as the combination allows Spectrier to beat bulky Pokemon like Celesteela and fast physical attackers such as Terrakion, Urshifu-R, and Garchomp. 52 HP EVs and 200 Defense EVs allow Spectrier to keep its Substitute up against burned Celesteela and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Galarian Corsola can switch into strong physical attacks from Pokemon like Barraskewda, Choice Scarf Terrakion, and Choice Scarf Excadrill.

Dragon Dance Dragapult is a great setup sweeper against Dragon and Electric type teams. Dragapult also helps with Pokemon that Spectrier has trouble against like Hydreigon and Zeraora, while Spectrier can take down troublesome walls for Dragapult like Toxapex, Avalugg, and Celesteela. Mimikyu is essential for using its Disguise to beat Dark- and Ghost-types such as Hydregion, Tyranitar, Zarude, and opposing Dragapult. Mimikyu's Drain Punch can also help take care of Dark- and Normal-types like Bisharp, Obstagoon, and Diggersby. Choice Scarf Blacephalon checks Pokemon like Excadrill, Zarude, and Choice Band Weavile. Gengar is very useful in threatening troublesome Dark-types like Tyranitar and Hydreigon with Focus Blast, Mandibuzz with Thunderbolt, and Grimmsnarl with Sludge Wave. It can also remove Toxic Spikes thanks to its part-Poison typing. Aegislash can use Swords Dance to beat the defensive backbone of Blissey and Porygon2 on Normal teams. SubToxic Aegislash can hinder walls such as Mantine and Zapdos, and Hex Spectrier greatly benefits from Aegislash using Toxic to inflict status onto opposing Pokemon. Its part-Steel typing is also useful against Alolan Ninetales, Rillaboom, and Tapu Lele. Albeit uncommon, Jellicent is a great answer to Kingdra's attacks that Spectrier has trouble taking on.</p> "

Dark Pulse is Spectrier's secondary STAB attack and grants it a Ghost / Dark typing; this typing only has one weakness and provides Spectrier with an important immunity to Extreme Speed. Nasty Plot increases its wallbreaking power. Will-O-Wisp boosts the power of Hex and hinders physical attackers such as Lycanroc-D, Landorus-T, and Rillaboom.

However, forgoing Swords Dance makes fighting Necrozma-DM more awkward, as Calyrex-I will be forced to take Rocky Helmet damage when attempting to wear it down. A bulkier version of a Substitute set can be run with Iron Defense, Body Press, and Glacial Lance alongside a 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe EV spread. This set has the benefit of being a sturdier check to Zygarde-C and Zekrom, though it struggles to overcome Necrozma-DM that can Dynamax. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to remove chip from Stealth Rock, allowing Calyrex-I to switch in more easily, although Leftovers synergizes well with Substitute.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Several Pokemon are able to revenge-kill Calyrex-I, such as Zacian-C, Marshadow, Calyrex-S, and offensive Yveltal. A healthy Zacian-C can take on Calyrex-I unless it’s boosted and behind a Substitute; Spectral Thief Marshadow can threaten it regardless of Attack boosts and Substitute. Calyrex-S and Yveltal should only be used to revenge kill if Calyrex-I isn’t behind a Substitute. Most of these Pokemon appreciate having the opposing Dynamax already used to minimize the risk of getting KOed instead.</p> <p><strong>Kyogre: Given its Ice resistance and neutrality to High Horsepower, Kyogre can usually switch in safely and damage Calyrex-I greatly with its STAB moves. With Scald, Kyogre can pressure Calyrex-I by threatening to burn it, negating recovery from Leftovers and drastically reducing its offensive power. Rest lets Kyogre heal when Calyrex-I chips it enough to threaten a KO. Even bulky Kyogre usually outspeed Calyrex-I, forcing it out unless it is behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Calyrex-I taking 25% from Stealth Rock means that it struggles when it’s repeatedly forced out. While Stealth Rock is the most dangerous hazard for Calyrex-I, Spikes and Toxic Spikes are also to be watched out for, as extra chip and getting poisoned can force Calyrex-I to rely on Leech Seed more often.</p> ",

Having a strong move for Dragon- and Ground-types is integral for forcing out Pokemon such as Zygarde-C, Eternatus, and Groudon. Substitute can be used on forced switches for easier setup aided by Calyrex-I's bulk. Leech Seed allows Calyrex-I behind Substitute to overwhelm Necrozma-DM over time. Calyrex-I's comparatively low uninvested HP increases Leech Seed's healing, helping it offset Substitute damage. Swords Dance boosts Calyrex-I's Attack to ludicrous levels when it is given the chance, which is often given the amount of switches it forces. As One can make it progressively harder to deal with Calyrex-I, although its Speed hinders its ability to outright sweep. A Jolly nature allows it to outspeed paralyzed Zacian-C and uninvested Pokemon with base 90 Speed such as Ho-Oh and defensive Groudon.</p> <p>Calyrex-I is best used on bulky balance teams that appreciate its ability to lure in and overwhelm Necrozma-DM and check dangerous wallbreakers in Zygarde-C and Zekrom in a pinch. Zacian-C and Xerneas are by far the best offensive partners, benefitting massively from Calyrex-I's ability to pressure Necrozma-DM. In return, both can threaten Yveltal and Marshadow. Calyrex-I appreciates partners that can slow foes down and check switch-ins. Zygarde-C is an excellent partner with Glare, allowing Calyrex-I to usually outspeed and gain free turns to set up with Swords Dance. It also deals with Marshadow lacking Ice Punch. As bulky Kyogre is Calyrex-I’s most effective wall, checks to it such as Eternatus and Kyurem-W are valuable, with the former sapping Scald PP with Pressure and the latter pressuring Kyogre with Freeze-Dry. Ferrothorn frustrates Kyogre with Spikes and Knock Off. Necrozma-DM is a useful partner as well, being a Thunder Wave user and a Zacian-C check. Calyrex-I benefits Necrozma-DM by using Leech Seed on Zacian-C switching in and offensively checking Zygarde-C. Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal are vital, as entry hazards heavily chip Calyrex-I every time it switches in.</p> "

However, Draining Kiss is very weak, Leaf Storm weakens Calyrex-S, and neither offers much over Trick. Baton Pass is another niche option, allowing Calyrex-S to effectively bait in Yveltal and Tyranitar for the likes of Zacian-C and Xerneas. Substitute is an option on Nasty Plot Calyrex-S to block Sucker Punch from offensive Yveltal, scout the foe's moves, and potentially stop Ditto from taking advantage of it. However, other moves like Psyshock and Baton Pass are generally more useful. Colbur Berry is potentially worthwhile when Dynamaxed to survive attacks from Yveltal as well as Necrozma-DM's Knock Off, hitting them back with +2 Max Starfall or Astral Barrage. Leaf Storm can KO Tyranitar after a Nasty Plot boost, but it has no other use and its Special Attack drop can be unfavorable. On Choice Scarf, Nasty Plot can be used over Aromatherapy for potentially sweeping after using Trick, which can be particularly effective as a Choice-locked Yveltal, Tyranitar or Blissey is far less effective at countering Calyrex-S. However requiring Trick to be used first makes this strategy quite unreliable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Yveltal, especially if specially defensive, completely shuts down Calyrex-S and can switch into any of its moves with near impunity bar Trick. Tyranitar can switch freely into all of Calyrex-S's attacks except the rare Leaf Storm and then force it out by threatening an OHKO with Foul Play. Tyranitar can then take advantage of the forced switch by setting up Stealth Rock or crippling a switch-in with Thunder Wave. Tyranitar is also vulnerable to Trick but continues to reliably switch into and force out Calyrex-S even after Trick. Yveltal and Tyranitar should also be wary of +2 Max Starfall, as it can OHKO them. Urshifu-S can force out Calyrex-S with Sucker Punch, but it cannot reliably switch into Astral Barrage, Leaf Storm, or Draining Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Normal-types: Porygon2 can tank many of Calyrex-S's attacks due to its good bulk, heavily damage it with Foul Play, and pivot into another teammate with Teleport if Calyrex-S switches out. However, Porygon2 dislikes being crippled by Trick, limiting its ability to use its moves with ease while losing its Eviolite. Blissey, Chansey, and Porygon2 comfortably switch into Nasty Plot Calyrex-S if it's lacking Psyshock. However, Blissey gets OHKOed by boosted Psyshock, Chansey gets OHKOed by boosted Psyshock after minor chip damage, and Porygon2 has to watch out for +2 Max Mindstorm.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Calyrex-S can be revenge killed by a few Pokemon. Ditto can come in after Calyrex-S gets a KO and threaten to reverse sweep. Choice Scarf users such as Kyogre, Galarian Darmanitan, Zacian, and opposing Calyrex-S can force Calyrex-S out. Marshadow can pick off Calyrex-S with Shadow Sneak. Sand Rush Excadrill under sand can also revenge kill Calyrex-S, and it can set up after forcing Calyrex-S out. Priority moves such as Yveltal's Sucker Punch and Marshadow's Shadow Sneak OHKO Calyrex-S, forcing it out every time they come in. However, not all Yveltal have Sucker Punch, so it is important to scout for it. Nasty Plot Calyrex-S can also situationally beat all of these revenge killers if it's running Focus Sash and is at full health, although this is not a reliable form of counterplay, and the rare Substitute handles Ditto.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh can safely switch into any attack, though is crippled by Trick. Cores featuring Ho-Oh and a Dark-type such as Tyranitar or Yveltal are incredibly hard for Calyrex-S to make progress against, as it can only cripple one foe with Trick.</p> ",

Additionally, thanks to As One and the ability to Dynamax, Calyrex-S has tremendous snowballing potential. Psyshock lets Calyrex-S damage Blissey and Chansey while also hitting bulky Eternatus harder than Astral Barrage. Trick notably cripples Yveltal — the loss of Heavy-Duty Boots greatly impacts its ability to switch into Calyrex-S — while also crippling Blissey, Chansey, Porygon2, and Tyranitar so Calyrex-S's teammates can exploit them. Aromatherapy allows Calyrex-S to take advantage of the numerous switches that it forces by providing useful team support as a cleric. Alternatively, Nasty Plot gives Calyrex-S a way to boost its damage output after Trick removes its Choice Specs. Choice Specs maximizes Calyrex-S's damage output, notably allowing it to OHKO fast Zacian-C after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Calyrex-S fits best on balance teams that appreciate its tremendous firepower and ability to revenge kill Zacian-C and can cover up its weakness to Yveltal. Tyranitar and specially defensive Yveltal make great teammates, soft checking most offensive Yveltal and helping Imposter-proof Calyrex-S.

Offensive Yveltal is also a strong teammate, as it and Calyrex-S share checks in Tyranitar and opposing bulky Yveltal. Thus, each can weaken the other’s checks, allowing either one to sweep late-game. After Calyrex-S uses Trick, Substitute sweepers such as Zekrom and Zygarde-C can set up on a Choice-locked wall. Calyrex-S greatly appreciates Knock Off support from Pokemon like Yveltal, Ferrothorn, and Necrozma-DM in order to force bulky Yveltal to take Stealth Rock damage, putting it in range of a 2HKO from Astral Barrage. Knock Off also reduces the longevity of opposing Tyranitar, Porygon2, and Ho-Oh. Additionally, Stealth Rock support is invaluable, forcing Yveltal lacking Heavy-Duty Boots to take chip damage every time it comes in.</p> "

          "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Calyrex-S is one of the most lethal setup sweepers in AG due to its amazing Special Attack and Speed tier, powerful STAB move in Astral Barrage, and strong ability in As One. It can use Nasty Plot on forced switches from Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Lunala, giving it better firepower to break through bulky walls such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and specially defensive Eternatus if lacking Psyshock. Draining Kiss turns into Max Starfall during Dynamax, letting +2 Calyrex-S OHKO specially defensive Yveltal and OHKO Tyranitar after some chip damage. Baton Pass lets Calyrex-S take advantage of switch-ins such as Yveltal and Tyranitar by pivoting out and passing its Nasty Plot boosts to other special wallbreakers such as Life Orb Yveltal, Xerneas, and Life Orb Eternatus. Psyshock is an option over Baton Pass or Draining Kiss to nail Blissey and Chansey and more immediately threaten specially defensive Eternatus. Life Orb significantly increases Calyrex-S's damage output, guaranteeing an OHKO on specially defensive Yveltal with +2 Max Starfall and dealing extra damage to bulky walls such as Ho-Oh, Eternatus, and Zygarde-C and offensive threats like Zacian-C and Groudon. Focus Sash is an alternative item to withstand an attack from threats like Ditto, Sucker Punch Yveltal, and Marshadow. However, Calyrex-S then has to be wary of Stealth Rock or Spikes breaking Focus Sash. Heavy-Duty Boots makes Calyrex-S immune to Sticky Web and tougher to wear down compared to Life Orb. It also pairs excellently with Baton Pass. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Calyrex-S to outspeed Jolly Zacian-C and Speed tie with opposing Calyrex-S.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Calyrex-S's best fit is on bulky offense and hyper offense teams, where it can find the right support to weaken its extremely few checks. Special wallbreakers such as Life Orb Yveltal, Xerneas, and Life Orb Eternatus can benefit from Calyrex-S's Nasty Plot boosts if it's running Baton Pass. Sucker Punch Yveltal is an especially strong partner, as it can prevent Ditto from completely destroying a team once it has copied Calyrex-S, while specially defensive sets can take boosted Astral Barrage and Imposter-proof any sets without Draining Kiss relatively easily. Teammates that can pressure Yveltal and Tyranitar for Calyrex-S such as Zacian-C, Xerneas, Marshadow, and Kyogre are appreciated. On hyper offense teams, Shuckle can provide Sticky Web for Calyrex-S, which allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Kyogre and other Calyrex-S, while Excadrill is a lead that removes damaging entry hazards and Sticky Web with Rapid Spin, which is especially helpful for Focus Sash Calyrex-S. Regieleki is a useful spinner as well, since it can force out threats like Yveltal and opposing Calyrex-S thanks to its STAB moves and unmatched Speed tier.</p> "

Astral Barrage OHKOes offensive Necrozma-DM and opposing Calyrex-S while heavily damaging Groudon, Zekrom and Zacian-C. Psyshock targets boosted Geomancy Xerneas, defeating it after significant chip, while enabling Calyrex-S to damage key defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Eternatus. Trick enables Calyrex-S to cripple its best switch-ins such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Tyranitar while thwarting major threats such as Dragon Dance Zygarde and Calm Mind Kyogre. Aromatherapy is useful because status is abundant in AG and Calyrex-S easily generates free turns to use it as it forces out Pokemon like Necrozma-DM.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Calyrex-S is one of the best countermeasures to offensive teams, especially Sticky Web teams. As such, it fits on a large variety of balance teams. In particular, teams weak to Geomancy Xerneas, Max Airstream Groudon, Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, and opposing Calyrex-S appreciate its presence. However, Choice Scarf variants of Calyrex-S find it even more difficult to break through the Pokemon's two main switch-ins, Yveltal and Tyranitar, so offensive teammates which can deal with them, such as Zacian-C, Groudon, and Xerneas, are appreciated. In return, Calyrex-S can threaten Necrozma DM for Zacian and Xerneas while crippling pivots such as Ho-Oh and Blissey with Trick for Xerneas. Ferrothorn, Calm Mind Kyogre, and Zygarde are appreciated too for switching into and taking advantage of Yveltal and Tyranitar. In return, Calyrex-S, can clear their status ailments, which can be especially beneficial for offensive Zygarde. Marshadow forces Calyrex-S out, so counterplay such as defensive Zygarde, Eternatus, and pivots such as Ho-Oh is appreciated. Yveltal can Imposter-proof Calyrex-S, preventing Speed ties.</p> "

Its ability in Mountaineer prevents Stealth Rock damage, so you can forgo Heavy-Duty Boots and dedicate your item slot to a damage boosting option like Choice Band. Earthquake is absolutely necessary for dealing with Pokemon like Toxapex, Melmetal, and Heatran that would otherwise stonewall Syclant. Ice Shard is valuable for picking off weakened Tornadus-T without risking a Speed tie and revenge killing faster threats like Dragapult, +1 Garchomp, and weakened Unburden-boosted Hawlucha, though one can opt to run Spikes instead to capitalize on the switches that Syclant forces. Triple Axel is an alternative option over Icicle Crash that offers a significant boost in damage; however, its inconsistency and its susceptibility to contact punishments like Rocky Helmet and Static mean that the tradeoff usually isn't worth it. Syclant can also choose to run Superpower over Earthquake to hit Equilibra and Ferrothorn super effectively, although Earthquake's coverage is still superior in most cases.</p> <p>Because Syclant is extremely frail and held back by many common bulky Water- and Steel-types, it relies immensely on its teammates to shore up its shortcomings as a wallbreaker.

Having teammates like Krilowatt and Nidoking that can take advantage of Toxapex and other bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini is also appreciated. Krilowatt is especially useful because it forms a strong VoltTurn core with Syclant, bringing it in on Pokemon like Blissey and Astrolotl, which are then easily forced out. Combining Spikes support from teammates like Astrolotl and Ferrothorn with these VoltTurn cores helps Syclant break past its grounded checks like Toxapex and Melmetal. Other common bulky Steel-types like Heatran can also give Syclant trouble if it's locked into an Ice-type move, so having partners like Slowking and Equilibra that can reliably answer them is greatly appreciated. Finally, Syclant benefits from having reliable pivots on its team because it can struggle to enter the game safely; Slowking, Landorus-T, and Zeraora are all good options that can also apply pressure to common Steel-types that are difficult for Syclant to break past by itself.

Flying-type checks and specially bulky Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Zapdos form excellent cores with Tomohawk, which can sometimes invite in powerful Hurricane users like opposing Zapdos and Tornadus-T. Finally, Dark types such as Mandibuzz and Tyranitar make good partners, as they appreciate Tomohawk's ability to check Fighting-types and lessen Tomohawk's weakness to Psychic-types and Dragapult; they can also provide Defog or Stealth Rock, respectively, and form potent hazard control cores with Tomohawk.</p> "

The third moveslot is usually dedicated to Stealth Rock or Rapid Spin for role compression, though not running Aura Sphere hurts Tomohawk's matchup against common entry hazard setters and removers like Heatran, Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Equilibra.

Its immunity to Water-type attacks provided by Dry Skin allows Mollux to also check threats like Dracovish and Pelipper. However, the downside to Dry Skin is that Mollux will take residual damage every turn under sun, so it won't be able to check Fire-type attackers. While serving as a wall, Mollux can also be very threatening because very few Pokemon can resist its two STAB moves and it can spread status easily thanks to Sludge Bomb and Lava Plume. Calm Mind allows Mollux to make the most of this asset, making it all the more threatening and allowing it to check Calm Mind Clefable. 8 Speed EVs allow Mollux to allways outspeed Adamant Conkeldurr.</p> <p>Mollux's key weakness to Stealth Rock forces it to run Heavy-Duty Boots, making it prone to Knock Off.

Tomohawk and Arghonaut prevent physical attackers like Terrakion and Colossoil from taking advantage of Mollux. Pokemon that struggle against Clefable like Hydreigon, Kyurem, Dragapult, and Mandibuzz pair well with Mollux, as Mollux counters it. Kyurem and Hydreigon are also good to punish Ground-types like Seismitoad and Hippowdon that annoy Mollux. Grass Knot Zeraora and Toxic Smokomodo are also good options to pressure Ground-types and can help Mollux to sweep.

That being said, given the right team support, Volkraken can turn into a relatively strong special breaker with the somewhat unique ability to pressure all three of Tomohawk, Equilibra, and Heatran at once. Furthermore, Volkraken's access to Analytic can make switching into it quite terrifying. Fire Blast and Hydro Pump is a near-unique STAB combination in the CAP metagame that can prove to be difficult for some teams to deal with, picking up 2HKOs on the common Tomohawk + Equilibra core. Scorching Sands is by far the best option for the third slot, as it 2HKOes Toxapex and is a roll to OHKO Krilowatt. U-turn is used over Flip Turn to avoid losing momentum against Storm Drain Gastrodon. U-turn additionally chunks Slowking more than Flip Turn.

Volkraken's ability to wallbreak is further amplified under rain, with nothing in the metagame other than Slowking being able to tank two Hydro Pumps in rain. Therefore, Pelipper and Barraskewda make excellent teammates for Volkraken. Entry hazard removal is key for Volkraken to operate well as it foregoes Heavy-Duty Boots for the power of Choice Specs, so Pokemon such as Equilibra and pivot Tornadus-T are important. Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Zeraora, and Melmetal that need the Tomohawk + Equilibra core to be pressured appreciate Volkraken's ability to dish out heavy damage to teams using this defensive backbone. Miasmaw, particularly the Taunt set, deserves a special mention as a teammate for its unique ability to deny Slowking and Toxapex Regenerator recovery. Finally, setup sweepers like Garchomp and Kartana that require chip damage on Pokemon such as Toxapex and Equilibra to win appreciate Volkraken's ability to force heavy damage on the opponent's team.</p> "

Slowking and Slowbro offer similar support with Future Sight + Teleport, a combination that has truly incredible synergy with Kerfluffle and is the only consistent way it can break past Toxapex. Another great Future Sight setter is Galarian Slowking, though it unfortunately can't use Teleport to always safely bring Kerfluffle in. Spikes support from teammates like Astrolotl and Ferrothorn is great for Kerfluffle, as it can struggle to OHKO opposing Pokemon but is still effective in repeatedly forcing switches; Spikes additionally help Kerfluffle break past its checks in the long run by forcing damage on Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex, which would otherwise be able to recover their HP through Regenerator. Slower wallbreakers that appreciate being brought in for free with Parting Shot also tend to have great synergy with Kerfluffle. Miasmaw stands out among them as being particularly effective, as it loves the chance to safely switch into Toxapex, Slowking, and Galarian Slowking to deny them their Regenerator healing and make them much easier for Kerfluffle to eventually break through.</p> "

Jolly is generally the preferred nature to outspeed Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Jumbao, Hydreigon, and Landorus-T, although one might opt for Adamant to 2HKO Clefable far more consistently.</p> <p>Pajantom is most appreciated on teams where it can significantly weaken or outright remove opposing Pokemon like Tomohawk, Landorus-T, and Clefable that would otherwise be in the way of its teammates. Zeraora and Landorus-T pair excellently with Pajantom, as they both struggle against all three of the aforementioned Pokemon, while other options like Melmetal, Tapu Koko, and Excadrill also appreciate Pajantom's ability to weaken or eliminate their checks. If Pajantom isn't running Toxic itself, then teammates with the move such as Tyranitar, Melmetal, and Toxapex are greatly appreciated for their ability to cripple Pajantom's checks. Equilibra is a great partner because it's walled by Pokemon like Slowking and Zapdos, which Pajantom easily takes advantage of; in return, Equilibra can remove entry hazards to keep Pajantom healthy and set Doom Desires to help it muscle past checks like Tomohawk, Mandibuzz, and Clefable. Future Sight support from Slowking or Galarian Slowking is also useful to let Pajantom break past Tomohawk and Toxapex, with these teammates additionally being able to switch into many of Pajantom's checks if it's ever forced out by them. Lastly, Pajantom loves having Spikes and Stealth Rock on the field, as it's highly effective at forcing switches, and the repeated chip damage on foes like Heatran and Ferrothorn helps it remove them more reliably, so teammates that can keep up entry hazards like Tomohawk, Heatran, and Ferrothorn are great partners.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This Pajantom set forgoes the sheer wallbreaking power granted by Choice Band for additional longevity and more incremental progress. Pajantom can poison its checks the first time they switch in and later trap them to stall them out with Protect and potentially Substitute. This strategy is mainly used to trap and remove Landorus-T and Tomohawk while still spreading poison to wear down opposing Dark-types like Mandibuzz, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon. Toxic Spikes can also be used to pressure grounded foes like Dragapult, Jumbao, and Arghonaut at the cost of coverage for Heatran and Blissey and extra poison stalling. Pajantom's EV spread lets it outspeed Modest Heatran and Adamant Rillaboom and has enough HP investment to hit a Leftovers number and survive Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball from full health, with the remaining EVs invested into Attack for stronger Spirit Shackles. Leftovers is crucial for maximizing Pajantom's longevity, but the lack of a damage-boosting item and additional coverage leaves this set especially weak to certain walls like Toxapex, Clefable, and Ferrothorn. Sets not running Substitute may choose to use Spell Tag over Leftovers to make up for this weakness and hit with strength more comparable to Choice Band sets, especially if you opt for additional Attack investment.</p> <p>Good partners for Pajantom include Pokemon that can take advantage of its ability to spread poison and remove Tomohawk from the field. Hex Dragapult is an effective partner because they can help each other overwhelm shared Dark-type checks like Mandibuzz and Tyranitar, with Dragapult also appreciating Pajantom's ability to consistently status its foes. Pokemon walled by Tomohawk such as Landorus-T and Rillaboom love the fact that Pajantom can remove it entirely from the game. Pokemon like Clefable and Equilibra that can set or remove entry hazards also appreciate Pajantom's ability to eliminate Tomohawk, one of the tier's best Stealth Rock and spinners. Pajantom also needs to be on a team with a good Knock Off absorber such as Toxapex, Tomohawk, or Clefable, as this set is especially vulnerable to Pokemon that use the move due to its reliance on Leftovers for longevity and its reduced ability to combat Knock Off users through offensive pressure.</p> "

Additionally, it is one of the best offensive countermeasures to Swords Dance Garchomp in the metagame. It also has a good matchup against most weather teams thanks to Trace, letting it copy Speed-boosting abilities from the likes of Barraskewda, Excadrill, and Arctozolt and potentially revenge kill these foes in addition to copying Regenerator from foes like Slowking and Slowbro.

Garchomp in particular is fantastic because Healing Wish lets it break down its checks early-game so it can sweep late-game more easily. Similarly, Fire-types like Heatran and Moltres are problematic, so Water-types such as Slowking, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini are helpful to have; Slowking can also safely bring Jumbao in against Dragon-types like Latios and Hydreigon with Teleport and provide it Future Sight support, making it harder to defensively answer.

Trace allows Jumbao to copy Slowking’s Regenerator so it can stay healthy and constantly threaten Slowking throughout a game. Trace also allows Jumbao to absorb Zeraora's Volt Switch and switch into most Heatran sets, both of which are useful to balance teams. Leaf Storm and Moonblast pair excellently, as the sheer power of Leaf Storm dissuades Moonblast switch-ins like Toxapex and Equilibra from coming in. Focus Blast is important coverage for Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal. Shore Up helps Jumbao stay healthy, as it is otherwise prone to entry hazard and life orb chip damage. A Modest nature allows Leaf Storm to guarantee an OHKO versus Slowking and a 2HKO on Toxapex as it switches in, while letting Focus Blast 2HKO Corviknight after Stealth Rock and Scizor after a small amount of chip damage. Timid may occasionally be preferred to outspeed the likes of Kyurem, Tapu Lele and Nidoking.</p> <p>Jumbao pairs well with Steel and Water-types, which cover its weaknesses to the likes of Melmetal, Scizor, and Volcarona. It pairs incredibly well with Heatran, each resisting every type the other is weak to. Additionally, Heatran can pressure Jumbao's Steel-type checks like Corviknight and Scizor and use Taunt to help weaken Blissey and prevent Slowking from instantly pivoting out with teleport as Jumbao switches in. Heatran can also use Magma Storm to trap and remove some of Jumbao's checks such as Toxapex and Galarian-Slowking. Jumbao also pairs well with Slowking, which has similar type synergy and can pivot Jumbao in safely with Teleport while additionally setting Future Sight, which makes Pokemon like Toxapex and Tornadus-T unable to switch into Jumbao’s attacks. Toxapex covers Jumbao’s weaknesses to Scizor, Astrolotl, and Weavile and benefits from Jumbao taking advantage of Slowking and Zeraora. Tornadus-T greatly appreciates Jumbao's ability to stave off Zeraora, and in return Tornadus-T can often weaken Jumbao's answers like Blissey and Galarian-Slowking with Knock Off.</p> "

          "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Much of Equilibra's strength as a team support option in the CAP metagame comes from its powerful Doom Desire and ability to compress multiple crucial roles into a single team slot, such as being a sturdy Ground immunity, Volt Switch blocker, and reliable form of hazard control. Doom Desire can force predictable and exploitable choices upon an opponent, and when used in tandem with wallbreakers like Dragapult and Rillaboom, it can often mean getting a guaranteed KO. Equilibra is also a stellar hazard remover with Rapid Spin due to its winning matchup against common Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T and Clefable. Flash Cannon is preferred for Equilibra's final moveslot as a means to beat Calm Mind Clefable, force out strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Kyurem, and immediately pressure Flying-types like Landorus-T and Tornadus-T. Alternatively, Pain Split lets it recover against common switch-ins such as Slowking and Blissey to better check strong wallbreakers like Dragapult and Tapu Lele in the long term. Aura Sphere is also an option for beating opposing Equilibra, forcing Corviknight and Skarmory to use Roost more often, and avoiding being trapped by Magnet Rise Magnezone as easily. Equilibra's EV spread is designed to outspeed Tyranitar, survive three Heat Waves from defensive Zapdos, and tank one Fire Fang from +2 Life Orb Garchomp, with the remaining EVs invested into Special Attack for stronger Doom Desires.</p> <p>Equilibra's plethora of valuable resistances and immunities combined with its ability to consistently remove entry hazards makes it very easy to find partners that appreciate its presence; Tomohawk in particular has exceptional defensive synergy as a physical wall that benefits from having Electric- and Fairy-types checked, while Equilibra enjoys Tomohawk's ability to deal with Fighting-types and strong physical wallbreakers like Rillaboom. Clefable is also relevant because it can soak up common Fighting-type coverage moves that bother Equilibra, while Equilibra in turn deals with the Poison- and Steel-types that threaten it such as Melmetal and Nidoking. Strong wallbreakers like Dragapult and Rillaboom as well as other offensive Pokemon like Zeraora appreciate Doom Desire's ability to invalidate many of their respective defensive answers. Pokemon weak to hazards such as Choice Specs Kyurem and Choice Band Weavile also enjoy Equilibra's consistency in spinning away Stealth Rock. Teams that rely on hazard stacking benefit from Equilibra's Rapid Spin not resetting their progress. Finally, it's advisable to have a reliable answer to many of the bulky Water-types that hold Equilibra back, especially Slowking; Rillaboom, Zapdos, and Jumbao are a few options that can keep the pressure up against many of these Pokemon.</p> "
