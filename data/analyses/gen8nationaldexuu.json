Nihilego is also a much better Toxic Spikes user, as it is much less passive and pressures common Defoggers like Salamence better. Aromatherapy provides another layer of support, but Will-O-Wisp and Flamethrower make Galarian Weezing a lot less passive.

        "description": "<p>Galarian Weezing's solid physical bulk, unique typing, and great utility options make it a sufficient defensive Pokemon, perfectly capable of checking a myriad of Fighting-, Dark-, Fairy-, and Grass-type Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Mienshao, Krookodile, Mega Altaria, and Zarude. Levitate additionally allows Galarian Weezing to switch into Ground-type foes and attacks like Swampert, Hippowdon, and Mega Altaria's and Salamence's Earthquakes, as well as avoiding Spikes damage. However, its lack of reliable recovery leaves it worn down easily. Its low special bulk also leaves it at the mercy of powerful special attackers like Aegislash, Nihilego, Moltres, and Rotom-H. Galarian Weezing also faces harsh competition from other defensive Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Galarian Slowbro, which have Regenerator and more offensive support options like Spore and Future Sight, respectively. Pain Split gives recovery but, while it works better due to Galarian Weezing's low HP stat, it is still unreliable. Galarian Weezing makes solid use of Defog because it can check Rhyperior, Krookodile, and Hippowdon, preventing them from reliably keeping up Stealth Rock. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical threats like Mega Altaria, Zarude, Buzzwole, and Rhyperior. Flamethrower is an alternative option to hit Steel-type Pokemon such as Scizor, Aegislash, and Skarmory, allowing Galarian Weezing to consistently keep the latter's Spikes off the field. Black Sludge is useful to compensate for Pain Split's unreliability. Rocky Helmet may be used to double down on chipping physical attackers like Mega Altaria, Zeraora, Swampert, and Buzzwole, but it makes Galarian Weezing even easier to wear down.</p> <p>Galarian Weezing fits best on balance teams, which appreciate its role compression of checking Dark-, Fighting-, and Grass-type Pokemon alongside removing entry hazards. Steel-type Pokemon such as Scizor, Aegislash, and Celesteela take Psychic-type attacks from Pokemon such as Galarian Slowbro, Azelf, and Reuniclus, and in return, Galarian Weezing handles Fighting-types like Buzzwole and Mienshao. They also check Nihilego, one of Galarian Weezing's best checks and one of the few Stealth Rock setters it cannot use Defog against. Dark-types such as Zarude and Krookodile also pressure Psychic-types, and they benefit similarly from Galarian Weezing checking the aforementioned Fighting-types. The aforementioned Celesteela, as well as other specially bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Slowking, and Assault Vest Tangrowth, helps Galarian Weezing take on special attackers such as Aegislash, Nihilego, and Moltres. Slowking in particular likes Galarian Weezing handling Zarude and Krookodile for it. Fire-types such as Moltres, Rotom-H, and Volcanion help take care of Steel-types like Celesteela, Aegislash, and Scizor, especially if Galarian Weezing lacks Flamethrower, and it handles Ground-types like Swampert, Rhyperior, Hippowdon, and Krookodile for them.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Colbur Berry allows Slowking to pivot out of Dark-types while also patching up its vulnerability to Pursuit and Knock Off, but it is very matchup reliant overall, and letting hazards undermine its pivoting capabilities is generally not a worthwhile trade-off. Toxic can be used to cripple other support Pokemon and walls like Rotom-W and Assault Vest Reuniclus, but it is hard to fit due to the importance of Slowking's other moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Zarude resists Scald, easily OHKOes Slowking with Power Whip, and can even heal off status with Jungle Healing. Galarian Moltres can set up on non-Thunder Wave Slowking and rip through it with +2 Fiery Wrath. Bisharp and Krookodile can even Pursuit trap Slowking in addition to threatening it with STAB Knock Off, although both should be wary of a potential Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Amoonguss, Tangrowth and Roserade can often come in on Slowking to make progress because Slowking can't directly threaten them with anything, barring Thunder Wave on Roserade. Most notably, these Grass-types scare it with the possibility of landing Sleep moves on it, poisoning it with Sludge Bomb, or using Knock Off in Tangrowth's case. Roserade can also freely set up Spikes or 2HKO Slowking with Life Orb Giga Drain. However, none of these Pokemon barring Assault Vest Tangrowth should be taking Future Sight.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Zeraora and Mega Manectric threaten Slowking with their respective STAB moves or break it down with pivoting moves. However, both fear Scald burns when switching into it.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types: While they must be careful around Scald, Bug-types such as Scizor, Buzzwole and Mega Beedrill can threaten to OHKO Slowking with their STAB moves if given the opportunity. Scizor and Mega Beedrill running U-turn even allows them to pivot out as Slowking switches to preserve momentum, while their access to Pursuit means that they can also land significant damage as it switches.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers: Pokemon like Dragon Dance Mega Altaria and Salamence can take advantage of Slowking's mediocre Defense stat to overpower it with boosted attacks, while others such as offensive Scizor, Bisharp and Tapu Bulu, can even do so without needing to set up. However, none of these Pokemon appreciate a burn from Scald or paralysis from Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Aegislash is easily able to threaten Slowking with Ghost-type STAB moves or use it as setup fodder, with Scald unable to break a Substitute from Substitute + Toxic sets. The more offensive variants of Aegislash such as Spell Tag and Swords Dance need to watch out for a burn or Thunder Wave while trying to take advantage of Slowking, however.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Even with Regenerator, Toxic forces Slowking to use Slack Off more and is also common on Pokemon that it checks or tries to gain momentum on, like Hippowdon and defensive Moltres. Knock Off users like Nihilego, Tangrowth and Deoxys-D can limit the number of Pokemon Slowking can switch into regularly with hazards up.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great special bulk, good defensive typing, and access to Regenerator, Slowking can consistently pivot into and check several dangerous special attackers such as Choice Specs Primarina, offensive Moltres, and Defog Salamence. This is very useful for easing the burden on its team to play around these threats throughout the game. Scald, besides being a STAB attack, has a burn chance to stop Dark-types such as Bisharp and Krookodile from getting too comfortable in attempting to Pursuit trap Slowking. It also potentially cripples other Pokemon like Scizor and Aegislash, which may try to exploit its passivity. Thunder Wave expands its defensive versatility against Pokemon like Nihilego and Galarian Moltres, which may try to set up on it. Crippling them saves Slowking from constantly relying on bringing another teammate in against them, which requires Teleport to do safely; and thus risking a foe attack. Future Sight can be used in conjunction with Teleport to build up momentum for its offensive teammates like Zeraora, and create advantageous scenarios for them by pressuring their usual checks such as physically defensive Tangrowth and Buzzwole. Heavy-Duty Boots lets it pivot without damage from entry hazards. The given EV spread allows Slowking to survive a Knock Off from non-Choice Band Krookodile while maximizing its special bulk and HP gained from Regenerator. A Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs maximize the odds of Teleport going last in mirror matches. A physically defensive spread can be used to help Slowking's team pivot around Mienshao and Urshifu-R more effectively, but Slowking's weakness to Pursuit and common coverage moves from these Pokemon, like Knock Off and U-turn, prevent it from doing this consistently.</p> <p>Slowking easily bringing in strong wallbreakers and scouting the Pokemon it can switch into is highly important to various forms of offense and bulky offense. Wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R and Bisharp enjoy the free entry from Teleport making up for their defensive shortcomings, in addition to Future Sight dissuading checks like Amoonguss and Buzzwole from switching in. Similarly grateful are the late-game cleaners commonly supporting these Pokemon like Dragon Dance Mega Altaria, Swords Dance Scizor, and Bulk Up Zeraora. Slowking is very weak to Dark- and Bug-type attackers in Scizor, Zarude and Krookodile, so Pokemon that can cover them like Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Galarian Weezing make for good choices, and they appreciate Slowking's ability to switch into Fire-, Flying-, and Psychic-type attacks respectively. Skarmory is especially notable, as its Spikes and phazing combine with Slowking's Future Sight to rack up chip damage on Pokemon that need to stay healthy, like Swampert. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can form nice Regenerator cores with Slowking and provide coverage against Electric- and Grass-types such as Zeraora, Mega Manectric, and Tapu Bulu. Fire-types like Moltres and Rotom-H can threaten Grass-types while appreciating Slowking switching into Water-types like Primarina and Keldeo. Finally, Slowking's initial passivity may leave it susceptible to getting overwhelmed by some of the Pokemon it is supposed to check, so a backup defensive teammate like Rotom-H that can take advantage of the moves Slowking forces Pokemon to lock into, such as Hurricane from Moltres or Moonblast from Primarina, can help.</p> "

Such a set can also use Pursuit to trap and weaken Pokemon such as Nihilego and Slowking for teammates such as offensive Moltres to take advantage of.</p> <p>Defog can be used over Swords Dance on the defensive set, as Scizor is a decent Defogger. However, Defog makes it more passive and sacrifices its versatility, locking it into being a defensive glue Pokemon. Buginium Z on bulky sets can be used to let Scizor lure in and KO certain switch-ins like Amoonguss, Rotom-W, and Bisharp after a boost. Protective Pads is also a very good item, bypassing Rocky Helmet and Flame Body from Skarmory and Moltres, respectively, but it is situational.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon and Coverage: Fire-types such as Moltres, Rotom-H, and Volcanion completely shut down Scizor, as they resist both of its STAB attacks and can OHKO it in return. However, if they lose their Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off, they may struggle to consistently handle it with Stealth Rock up. Scizor also fears Fire-type coverage from Pokemon such as Mega Altaria and Hatterene. It normally takes advantage of both, but Fire-type coverage can potentially KO it for getting too careless.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon: Skarmory's and Celesteela's great typing and Salamence's Intimidate completely shut down Scizor offensively, with all three taking any attack comfortably. Skarmory can set up Spikes, punish it thanks to Rocky Helmet, and use it as setup fodder thanks to Iron Defense and Body Press. While Celesteela isn’t as annoying, it can OHKO Scizor with Flamethrower and use Leech Seed on the switch. Finally, Salamence can threaten Scizor with Flamethrower. However ,Salamence and Celesteela must be wary of Knock Off, which makes them less reliable overall.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage and Burn: Scizor hates taking chip damage from Rocky Helmet users like Buzzwole and burns from Pokemon like Moltres, which can force it to use Roost more often. Burn is especially annoying because a weakened Bullet Punch makes it more difficult for Scizor to check Pokemon like Mega Altaria and Nihilego.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Urshifu-R, Rotom-W, and Jellicent are very good checks to Scizor. Urshifu-R resists both of Scizor's STAB moves and forces it out, while Rotom-W and Jellicent can burn it with Will-O-Wisp, preventing it from safely setting up. However, they all don't like Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Zeraora and Mega Manectric can outspeed and threaten Scizor, OHKOing it with Overheat in the latter's case, while resisting Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Bisharp and Cobalion resist both of Scizor's STAB moves. Both can also use it as setup fodder. Cobalion in particular can be very threatening if Scizor lacks U-turn because Justified punishes Knock Off.

        "description": "<p>Due to its good typing, solid bulk, and strong priority move, Scizor plays both defensive and offensive roles by checking and setting up on dangerous Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Nihilego, and Tapu Bulu. It also sets up on a lot of passive Pokemon like Tangrowth lacking Hidden Power Fire and Hippowdon. These setup opportunities, in conjunction with Bullet Punch, make it very threatening late-game when its checks are weakened. Bullet Punch gives good damage while revenge killing faster threats, such as Terrakion and Nihilego, and pressuring Fairy-types such as Mega Altaria and Hatterene. Roost gives Scizor some much-needed staying power, which helps it set up and check Pokemon like Aegislash and Mega Altaria more often. Knock Off is a great utility move, removing important items like Moltres's Heavy-Duty Boots and Skarmory's Rocky Helmet, and allows Scizor to threaten Aegislash. On the other hand, U-turn takes advantage of the many switches Scizor forces against Pokemon such as Zarude and Tangrowth, preserving momentum. U-turn can bring in partners like Volcanion and Rotom-H on Scizor's checks, such as Skarmory and Celesteela. Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers are comparably effective at keeping Scizor healthy. The given EV spread lets Scizor avoid a 2HKO from Krookodile's Earthquake, outspeed uninvested Alomomola, and, with the Adamant nature, always OHKO Nihilego with Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>This Scizor set fits best on offense and bulky offense teams, acting as defensive glue and a threatening late-game cleaner. Stealth Rock helps Scizor pressure its checks, especially when used alongside Knock Off to remove opposing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. Thus, Pokemon such as Swampert, Rhyperior, and Seismitoad have good synergy with Scizor, and they can all deal with Fire-type Pokemon, while Scizor is able to pressure Grass-type Pokemon like Tangrowth and Amoonguss for them. Some Fire-type answer is mandatory, as Scizor will struggle to beat Pokemon like Moltres, so Primarina, Rotom-H, and Rotom-W are also very good partners. If Scizor has U-turn, wallbreakers like Choice Specs Primarina and Terrakion appreciate the safe entry on Pokemon such as Salamence, Skarmory, and Moltres. Strong pivots like Urshifu-R and Mega Manectric can also form a VoltTurn core with Scizor, pressuring major roadblocks to it like Skarmory and Moltres, while Scizor can pressure Mega Altaria and Salamence for them in return. Aegislash is also an interesting partner, as it can cripple shared checks such as Moltres with Toxic.</p> "

Even without bulk investment, Scizor's good natural bulk and excellent defensive typing let it soft check a plethora of dangerous threats to hyper offense, such as Mega Altaria and Nihilego, as well as giving it multiple opportunities to set up. Bullet Punch deals a lot of damage against Pokemon that don't resist as well as patching up Scizor's middling Speed stat. Superpower allows Scizor to hurt Steel-types, such as Cobalion and Celesteela. Knock Off hits Aegislash and Slowking while pressuring Pokemon like Celesteela and Skarmory by removing their item. Quick Attack might seem underpowered as a secondary option, but it's a very good one nonetheless, as lets Scizor finish off weakened Steel-resistant Pokemon such as Urshifu-R, Keldeo, and Rotom-H. Dual Wingbeat can also be used in the last moveslot to threaten Pokemon that withstand its other moves like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Buzzwole. Life Orb allows Scizor to get some crucial KOs, notably allowing +2 Superpower to OHKO specially defensive Swampert and OHKO specially defensive Celesteela after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>This Scizor set fits best on hyper offense teams, as they can provide the support it needs. Entry hazard support is mandatory to help Scizor grab more KOs, such as the specially defensive Celesteela example above, so a suicide lead like Azelf or Krookodile makes a good teammate. Scizor also appreciates Pokemon that share checks with it, as, together, they can easily wear down the checks or even nail them with specialized lure options. Dragon Dance Salamence, and for example, can run Fire Blast to pressure Steel-types like Skarmory and Celesteela, which normally check both it and Scizor. Salamence can also deal with Fire-type Pokemon that even Quick Attack Scizor struggles to beat. In the same way, Necrozma can also lure in Steel-types thanks to Heat Wave. Dual screens support helps Scizor set up, making Grimmsnarl a good teammate. Azumarill has particularly great type synergy with Scizor, as Scizor can beat Grass-type Pokemon that Azumarill struggles against like Roserade and Tapu Bulu, while Azumarill can deal with Fire-type Pokemon like Moltres and Chandelure in return. Finally, Scizor appreciates other Pokemon that are able to deal with or weaken its common checks in Moltres and Skarmory, for example Meteor Beam Celesteela and Meteor Beam Nihilego.</p> "

Whirlwind forces out setup sweepers like Mega Altaria, Scizor, and Bulk Up Zarude. It also synergizes well with Spikes by forcing chip damage on switch-ins like Mega Manectric and Aegislash. Toxic is a solid alternative to Whirlwind, reducing the amount of times Defoggers such as Rotom-W, Moltres, and Salamence can safely use Defog. Body Press makes use of Skarmory's excellent Defense by threatening Zarude and Bisharp. Alternatively, Brave Bird is an option to immediately threaten Pokemon like Amoonguss and Urshifu-R. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn attempts from Urshifu-R lacking Protective Pads, Scizor, and Zarude, being especially useful at deterring the former's Surging Strikes.</p> <p>Skarmory fits best on balance and bulky offense teams as a solid check to physical attackers and a Spiker with Whirlwind to help Pokemon such as Urshifu-R wallbreak. Hippowdon is an amazing partner, as its Stealth Rock lets them form a great entry hazard-stacking core, especially since Hippowdon can consistently deal with and wear down Defoggers that threaten Skarmory like Rotom-H and Moltres with sand and Toxic. Hippowdon can also check Electric-types such as Mega Manectric for Skarmory, while the latter can easily check Grass-types like Zarude and Tapu Bulu. On more offensive structures, Swampert can perform a similar role by setting Stealth Rock and checking Fire-types, and Flip Turn also lets it safely bring Skarmory into Grass-types. However, Swampert lacks reliable recovery and gets easily worn down by status and hazards, making Hippowdon the superior choice in most cases. Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth can deal with problematic Water- and Electric-types like Primarina, Rotom-W, and Zeraora. Slowking, Rotom-W, and Moltres can deal with Fire-types that force Skarmory out like Volcanion and opposing Moltres. Since Skarmory has a poor matchup against common Defoggers such as Rotom-W and Rotom-H, Pokemon that can lure in and cripple them like Zeraora are appreciated. Zeraora can use Knock Off to remove Leftovers from Rotom-W and Heavy-Duty Boots from Rotom-H. Stallbreakers like Deoxys-D and Hatterene completely shut down Skarmory, denying its Spikes, so Dark-types that can pressure them like Bisharp are appreciated. Finally, late-game sweepers and strong wallbreakers like Urshifu-R, Primarina, and Zeraora enjoy Skarmory's Spikes constantly weakening defensive answers like Swampert, Scizor, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss, putting them in range of their attacks late-game.</p> "

This role can open the door for other Pokemon such as offensive Moltres to thrive. However, this set is extremely susceptible to being Pursuit trapped itself and will struggle to consistently damage the likes of Intimidate users like Salamence and Krookodile, as well as Moltres due to Flame Body and Rotom-W due to Will-O-Wisp. Similarly, Choice Specs can be used over Spell Tag or Ghostium Z for the extra power boost, notably allowing Shadow Ball to 2HKO Assault Vest Tangrowth and specially defensive Hippowdon after Stealth Rock, but this set is similarly to vulnerable to Pursuit trapping and revenge killing attempts due to lacking King's Shield. Furthermore, it's often unnecessary with how Toxic is already able to wear down these targets. A bulkier Swords Dance set with Leftovers and King's Shield can also work, as this allows gives Aegislash solid defensive utility while not being checked by the same pool of Pokemon, but it has an inconsistent damage output against bulky pivots, since it is very slow, easy to exploit, and fairly weak without a boost. Lastly, Autotomize + Weakness Policy can be used to give Aegislash a shot to sweep against weaker super effective moves such as Flamethrower from Salamence, since it can then outspeed and threaten to KO Pokemon such as Krookodile and Nidoking. This set is unreliable though, since it is almost always forced to take a hit beforehand in order to try and activate its Weakness Policy, and it's still easily being KOed by Choice Scarf users such as Zarude and priority moves from the likes of Bisharp and Azumarill afterwards.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Steel-types: Bulky Steel-types such as defensive Celesteela and defensive Scizor are especially bothersome for most Aegislash sets, since they are immune to Toxic, don't mind most of its attacks, and can then proceed to wear down Aegislash with Flamethrower or Knock Off, respectively. However, none of these Pokemon can take boosted physical attacks reliably, and Scizor will also struggle to take repeated Shadow Balls from Spell Tag or Ghostium Z variants of Aegislash.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Aegislash can't do much of note against Dark-types such as Galarian Moltres, Zarude, Bisharp, and Krookodile once they get in. It often runs Close Combat to punish them for getting too careless, but they cripple or nail Aegislash in return, staying healthy with Rest or Jungle Healing in the case of the former two. Choice Band Bisharp also stands out for trapping Aegislash with Pursuit, since Defiant will counteract the Attack drop from King's Shield, making Aegislash unable to scout its move and safely switch out beforehand. Krookodile can threaten Aegislash similarly while using Taunt to shut down setup or stalling attempts, but it must also be wary of switching into Toxic or any of Aegislash's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls:</strong> Mixed walls such as Assault Vest Tangrowth, defensive Moltres, Swampert, and Gligar all have the bulk and longevity needed to hinder most Aegislash sets from consistently making progress throughout the game, since these Pokemon can also threaten to cripple or KO Aegislash in return. However, most of these Pokemon can easily be knocked into KO range by Aegislash's offensive sets with prior chip damage, and the former three will also get worn down quickly by the combination of King's Shield + Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Burn and Knock Off: Since bulkier Aegislash sets often rely on recovery from Leftovers, burn or Knock Off can severely compromise it, making it much easier to wear down with constant attacks and Stealth Rock damage. To make matters worse, these threats can also be found on Pokemon such as Slowking, Nihilego, and Deoxys-D that Aegislash is otherwise free to take advantage of, making switching in a much scarier prospect.

Walls such as Tangrowth and Hippowdon can use Knock Off or set up entry hazards to increase the amount of passive damage that Aegislash can spread, and they also provide extra defensive integrity against possible answers to Aegislash, like Zeraora and Krookodile. Fire-types like Moltres and Rotom-H appreciate Aegislash wearing down specially defensive Ground-types like Hippowdon, Swampert and Gastrodon, and in return, they can handle Steel-types such as Scizor and Celesteela while pivoting Aegislash into their few counters in Nihilego and Slowking. Powerful wallbreakers, such as Life Orb Buzzwole and Life Orb Mienshao, can also handle Steel-types while providing extra coverage against the offensive Pokemon that don't mind this set, like non-Choice Scarf Zarude and Bisharp. Finally, Defog support from the likes of Rotom-W, Salamence, and Volcanion improves Aegislash's longevity and gives it more chances to set up Substitutes by taking Spikes damage out of the picture. These Defoggers also appreciate Aegislash consistently wearing down bulky pivots such as Assault Vest Tangrowth and Slowking in return.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Aegislash can sacrifice some of its defensive capabilities to become a terrifying early- and mid-game wallbreaker, easily entering the battlefield against the likes of Nihilego and Deoxys-D to cause havoc. Its near-perfect coverage and offensive item allow it to power through makeshift checks in Amoonguss and Scizor commonly used to switch around Aegislash. Close Combat is used to hit Dark-types that resist Shadow Ball, preventing Pokemon like Zarude and Bisharp from taking advantage of it. Toxic cripples other Pokemon like Assault Vest Tangrowth and Moltres, putting them into range of Shadow Ball and Never-Ending Nightmare, especially because King's Shield racks up poison damage. King's Shield is additionally valuable to limit revenge killing attempts from other offensive Pokemon such as Mienshao and Krookodile. Spell Tag is the item of choice on this set, allowing Shadow Ball to 2HKO Amoonguss and bulky Scizor trying to pivot into it with negligible drawback. Alternatively, Ghostium Z gives Aegislash access to a potentially devastating Never-Ending Nightmare, outright KOing bulkier Pokemon like Hippowdon and Swampert that have already taken a Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock, However, lacking Spell Tag stops Aegislash from threatening other pivots and reaching certain benchmarks consistently, which generally makes Aegislash more unreliable as a wallbreaker. Maximum Speed investment gives Aegislash the best possible chance at beating opposing Aegislash, as well as giving it the jump on other notable targets like Gligar and Seismitoad. A Modest nature is used as to not worsen Aegislash's impressive bulk, as Close Combat still hits Dark-types for reasonable damage.</p> <p>This set excels on bulky offense and balance teams that can afford to stay on the backfoot to provide Aegislash the openings it needs to get in safely and wallbreak, and they appreciate its good matchups versus certain threats such as Deoxys-D and Nihilego. Pivots such as Moltres and Zeraora are great options to generate momentum for Aegislash, as they can also pressure checks like Assault Vest Tangrowth and Swampert with STAB moves or Knock Off, respectively, greatly limiting their ability to switch into Aegislash. This set can still struggle to break through certain specially defensive Pokemon like Celesteela and Galarian Moltres, so strong physical wallbreakers like Urshifu-R and Mamoswine are much appreciated. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Swampert and Nihilego is very useful for allowing Aegislash's Shadow Ball to 2HKO Pokemon like Amoonguss and Hippowdon. Finally, late-game cleaners such as Dragon Dance Mega Altaria and Swords Dance Scizor should be used in order to take advantage Aegislash pressuring their common roadblocks in Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Aegislash's great attacking stats and solid defensive presence allows it to act as a potent mixed attacker. This set's longevity helps it survive attacks from a huge portion of the offensive metagame when its health is managed properly, with even Pokemon like Salamence and Tapu Bulu running super effective coverage struggling to consistently wear it down unscathed. Toxic cripples Pokemon such as Salamence and Krookodile attempting to switch in and weaken it. King's Shield, besides racking up heavy Toxic damage and maximizing Leftovers recovery, scouts otherwise dangerous attacks from Choice-locked Pokemon such as Primarina and Keldeo. Shadow Ball hits popular Pokemon like opposing Aegislash, Galarian Slowbro, and Skarmory, dealing solid damage and providing great coverage against the metagame at large. Close Combat punishes Dark-types trying to pivot into Shadow Ball or Toxic, like Zarude and Bisharp. Alternatively, Flash Cannon avoids dropping Aegislash's defenses, making it less vulnerable to revenge-killing attempts, while also allowing it to deal with the likes of Mega Altaria, Terrakion and Tapu Bulu better. However, it leaves Aegislash completely blanked by Bisharp and serves little additional use. 44 Speed EVs allow Aegislash to outspeed uninvested Scizor and Alomomola.</p> <p>This set fits best on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its unique blend of defensive flexibility and offensive capability. Since Aegislash is very reliant on Leftovers recovery, teammates that can absorb Knock Off for it such as Mega Altaria and Amoonguss make for good choices. Other offensive Pokemon such as Zeraora, Urshifu-R, and Mamoswine can whittle down or remove common roadblocks to this set in Celesteela and Galarian Moltres. Zeraora is especially notable, as it shares common switch-ins with Aegislash in Assault Vest Tangrowth, Swampert, and Krookodile, and it can use Knock Off or coverage options in Grass Knot and Close Combat to force in and weaken these switch-ins for it. Defensive pivots like Moltres and Slowking let Aegislash enter the field safely, preserving its HP while appreciating its ability to check Pokemon such as Nihilego and Terrakion in return. Finally, late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Mienshao and Nasty Plot Azelf enjoy having Aegislash to wear down and threaten bulky Psychic-types in Deoxys-D and Reuniclus, which would normally prevent them setting up and sweeping late-game.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Aegislash is a menacing wallbreaker and offensive terror on fast-paced teams. It can easily get going against the plethora of Pokemon that its typing allows it to safely set up on, ranging from the likes of Terrakion lacking Earthquake to Choice-locked Scizor. Due to its enormous bulk for a sweeper in Shield forme, Aegislash becomes very useful at supporting its team against dangerous revenge killers such as Nihilego and Choice Scarf Mienshao, helping to preserve the sweeping chances of other setup teammates like Meteor Beam Celesteela and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Shadow Claw deals good neutral damage against the majority of the tier at +2. Close Combat is Aegislash's strongest physical attack overall, gives Aegislash perfect coverage, and hits the Dark-types like Zarude and Krookodile that Shadow Claw misses out on. Shadow Sneak provides Aegislash with useful priority that stops Pokemon such as Zeraora, Azelf, and Azumarill from revenge killing it safely. Ghostium Z allows Aegislash to OHKO walls such as Hippowdon and Celesteela after a boost, somewhat making up for its terrible bulk in Blade forme by removing the need to take an attack from these Pokemon. It also KOes Pokemon like Assault Vest Tangrowth and defensive Scizor often sent to check special Aegislash sets. Air Balloon can be a very good alternative that gives Aegislash setup opportunities against Pokemon like Hippowdon and Rhyperior relying on Earthquake, although that set's lack of initial power can often leave much to be desired against other walls.</p> <p>This set can be a valuable addition to offense or hyper offense teams, providing a strong wallbreaker and setup sweeper with impeccable defensive utility against some of the archetype's biggest threats in Nihilego and Terrakion. Pivots such as Moltres, Rotom-W, and Swampert can help bring Aegislash onto the field safely, preserving its health to set up for it to take super effective hits such as Zarude's Darkest Lariat and Mega Altaria's Fire Blast in a pinch. Additional setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Rotom-H and Galarian Moltres appreciate Aegislash wearing down Pokemon such as Nihilego and Rhyperior for them to overpower late-game. Faster Pokemon that can hit Aegislash hard while not minding Shadow Sneak, such as Urshifu-R and Krookodile, are massive threats, so other offensive Pokemon like Mega Altaria and Tapu Bulu that can deal with them, make for good teammates. Both also appreciate Aegislash setting up on and wearing down shared checks in Tangrowth and Celesteela, for them to take advantage of afterwards. Tapu Bulu in particular stands out for providing Grassy Terrain, weakening Earthquakes and providing Aegislash with passive recovery to support its setup. Lastly, entry hazards can greatly benefit Aegislash; Roserade and Deoxys-D provide Spikes, and the latter alongside other options such as Nihilego and Krookodile can set up Stealth Rock. Both hazards secure more KOs and stop Skarmory from using Sturdy to phaze a boosted Aegislash. While Ribombee provides Sticky Web support to stop faster Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Nidoking from revenge killing it.</p> "
