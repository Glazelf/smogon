Note that it deals the same amount of damage to Necrozma-DM as Close Combat, and it risks activating Weakness Policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Substitute gives Zacian-C some insurance against Ditto, which can otherwise revenge kill it with a bit of chip damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fire Fang is rather weak, but it covers Shedinja and Ferrothorn with one move, though it does rather poorly in the rain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Solar Blade requires sun support from Groudon or Torkoal, but it allows Zacian-C to overcome its arch nemesis, Quagsire.</p> </li> </ul> <h1>EV Spreads</h1> <ul> <li> <p><strong>220 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 28 Spe with Adamant: This EV spread allows Zacian-C to outspeed up to Adamant Cinderace, survive Jolly Landorus-T's Earthquake—provided it lacks Life Orb, and maximizes its power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 108 Atk / 4 Def / 132 SpD / 28 Spe with Adamant: This EV spread allows Zacian-C to survive Choice Scarf Kyogre's Water Spout 93.7% of the time, survive Jolly Landorus-T's Earthquake from full health, and still outspeed Adamant Cinderace.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>92 HP / 252 Atk / 164 Spe with Adamant:</strong> This EV spread sacrifices a major amount of bulk to outspeed Jolly Cinderace. This spread is worth considering if your team has Stealth Rock support to chip Focus Sash Cinderace.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly:</strong> Maximizing Speed allows Zacian-C to outspeed Eternatus and Choice Scarf Dracovish but results in far less bulk.</p> </li> </ul> "

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Swords Dance may seem like overkill with Zacian-C's crazy strength, but the extra boost can stop offensive Steel-resistant Pokemon such as Kyogre, Zapdos, and Ho-Oh from escaping a KO!</p> </li> <li> <p>Despite not offering much extra coverage alongside Zacian-C's other moves, Behemoth Blade is essential for the extra damage against Dynamax users such as Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p>Close Combat is Zacian-C's most powerful tool against the majority of Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wild Charge prevents defensive Ho-Oh from walling Zacian-C. With Stealth Rock support, even defensive Ho-Oh won't be saved by Dynamax.</p> </li> <li> <p>Crunch lets Zacian-C get around Shedinja. It also deals the same amount of damage to Necrozma-DM as Close Combat, though watch out for Weakness Policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fire Fang lets Zacian-C beat Shedinja and Ferrothorn with one moveslot. However, it is fairly weak and not particularly effective against other Steel-types in rain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Substitute creates a serious loss in coverage, but it does prevent a potentially devastating counter-sweep from Ditto.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quagsire will usually give Zacian-C problems, but preparing for it is especially important when trying to sweep with this set. Pokemon with Grass-type attacks are usually a good choice against it. Using Groudon or Torkoal in combination with Solar Blade is also an option, though it's fairly easy to predict at Team Preview if using Torkoal.</p> </li> <li> <p>When using this set, take dual screens support in serious consideration, as, despite its decent bulk, Zacian-C has a hard time setting up Swords Dance against most of the metagame. Good teammates to consider include Lapras with its Gigantamax set, Regieleki, and Grimmsnarl.</p> </li> </ul> "
