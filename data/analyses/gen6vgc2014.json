  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar is a solid team option in VGC 2014 because of its ability to wall opposing Mega Kangaskhan as well as support one's own. Furthermore, Gengar's Mega Evolution's ability, Shadow Tag, prevents opposing Pokemon from switching. Gengar also has a great offensive typing with its Ghost and Poison-type STAB moves hitting almost everything common in the metagame outside Tyranitar for neutral damage. However, Gengar still has the defenses of a toothpick and will easily faint to any super effective hit, which is why most people opt against using it unless paired with Mega Kangaskhan.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Destiny Bond allows Gengar to bring down an opposing Pokemon once it is low on health. This can work well over Shadow Ball, but Mega Gengar then loses the ability to do direct damage to anything. Trick Room on Gengar can surprise an opponent and enable slower Pokemon to have a speed advantage, and it works well on Gengar because Gengar can not be stopped by Fake Out. Substitute + Black Sludge is a reliable combo for increased survivability, as it is a good means for recovery and defense. Gengar can always act as an offensive Pokemon with Life Orb, as it has a high Special Attack and Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Hydreigon OHKO Gengar with their powerful Dark-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Conkeldurr</strong>: Conkeldurr can take most of Gengar's attacks and benefits from Will-O-Wisp with its Guts ability, and it a huge threat with the potential of Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Gardevoir and Hydreigon can outspeed Gengar and deal a significant amount of damage.</p> <p><strong>Greninja</strong>: Greninja outspeeds Gengar and can inflict a huge amount of damage or even OHKO with attacks in conjunction with Protean.</p> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Pokemon carrying Lum Berry such as Garchomp and Scrafty can render Will-O-Wisp useless and proceed to attack without any risks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball hits most of the metagame for neutral damage. Will-O-Wisp allows Gengar to burn opposing Mega Kangaskhan as well as Garchomp and Mega Mawile. Protect is very important to stall out burn damage on opponents and allows Gengar to survive longer when a Choice Scarf Pokemon or a priority attacker is trying to chip at its Focus Sash. Taunt is recommended in the last spot to fully assist Mega Kangaskhan: it prevents Tailwind from Zapdos and, more importantly, Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and Rotom-H. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb does more damage to neutral opponents than Shadow Ball does and allows Gengar to actually hit opposing Mega Kangaskhan instead of just burning it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Max out Speed and power to Speed tie other Gengar if necessary and do as much possible damage with Shadow Ball. Common moves such as Rotom-W's Hydro Pump easily 2HKO Gengar, making any bulk on Gengar fairly irrelevant, and Gengar is carrying a Focus Sash anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Despite its poor defenses, Gengar is relatively easy to bring in due its three immunities. Gengar easily switches in on Mega Kangaskhan, the most popular Mega Evolution in the tier, and Gengar works fantastically to weaken or burn slower Pokemon that threaten one's own Mega Kangaskhan such as Mega Mawile and Garchomp. With that being said, Gengar is mainly good in VGC 2014 because it partners so well with Mega Kangaskhan, and if not using Mega Kangaskhan it loses a huge niche because Gengar is great at burning Mega Mawile and stopping Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-A.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Kangaskhan is practically a staple as a partner because of how well it is assisted by Gengar. Gengar has great offensive synergy with Garchomp, and it can KO Fairy-type Pokemon for Salamence as well. Quick Guard users such as Scrafty and Talonflame make for good teammates to prevent priority from blowing through Gengar. Furthermore, Talonflame can provide Tailwind support for Mega Kangaskhan and KO opposing priority users before they touch Gengar.</p>"
      },
      "Perish Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Gengar utilizes Shadow Tag to trap Pokemon, uses Perish Song, and then switches out before it KOes itself. Substitute helps stall turns of Perish Song, and it works really well with Mega Gengar's incredible base Speed. Protect is another move that helps Mega Gengar stall turns of Perish Song, and it has the added advantage of not lowering Gengar's health. Shadow Ball is the first choice in last spot because of its fantastic offensive coverage. Shadow Ball lets Mega Gengar finish off an enemy before using Perish Song against an opponent's last two remaining Pokemon, and it helps Gengar defeat a weakened enemy trying to double target it. Disable, on the other hand, can completely ruin Choiced Pokemon and works very well with Prankster + Encore users such as Liepard to make an enemy Pokemon completely useless.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are incredibly standard to maximize the niche of the set, which is to Perish Trap and effectively annoy opponents. Special Attack EVs are not necessary because Shadow Ball does enough to kill almost any neutral-damaged Pokemon under 25 percent health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Gengar is the fastest and therefore most deadly Perish trapper in VGC. Mega Gengar works great as a lead against Mega Kangaskhan to use Perish Song immediately because most Kangaskhan cannot KO it. If youâ€™re using Perish trap Mega Gengar the whole team should revolve around it. Mega Gengar is not meant to be slapped on other teams because unlike Mega Kangaskhan, it needs a ton of support to be used at its best.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gothitelle is the most obvious partner because it allows Mega Gengar to switch out after Perish Song while keeping the opponent trapped. Gothorita with Eviolite is another option but is inferior to Gothitelle. Politoed has access to Perish Song and also helps against sun teams, which is important because Heat Waves are very problematic for Perish trap teams. Furthermore, Politoed can get rid of sand, which Mega Gengar very much appreciates so it's not being chipped at behind a Substitute. Because Politoed is a popular partner, other Swift Swim users such as Kingdra work well so one's team is not completely reliant on Perish Song. Eject Button Amoonguss is a popular partner because it can use Spore and Rage Powder to protect Mega Gengar or get in Gothitelle for free after it is hit. Liepard has great base Speed and access to Fake Out, Prankster, and Encore, which can make trapping very easy for Gengar. Liepard can use Encore before Mega Gengar can use Disable, forcing an opponent to Struggle.</p>"

  "Greninja": {
    "overview": "<p>Greninja has an incredible base 122 Speed, which makes it capable of outspeeding nearly every viable Pokemon in the VGC metagame. Protean is one of the best abilities in the game as well, giving Greninja STAB on all of its attacks. On top of that, Greninja has a diverse movepool which allows it to hit most threats for super effective damage. However, Greninja is very frail, which means many things can OHKO it; it also loses easily to priority. While Greninja is definitely a fun Pokemon to use, it should fill an important role if it is used.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mat Block only works the first turn Greninja is on the field, and it protects one's team from all non-status moves that turn. However, unlike Protect, it does not have priority. Taunt is an option to stop moves such as Spore, Will-O-Wisp, and Trick Room, which can really help out Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferrothorn, Hidden Power Grass hits Azumarill and Rotom-W, and Extrasensory hits Conkeldurr. Choice Specs is an option to hit very hard, but Greninja then cannot take as much advantage of its fantastic ability, Protean.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rotom-W</strong>: Rotom-W takes neutral damage from all of Greninja's standard moves in VGC. It can then retaliate with a STAB Thunderbolt, or burn any of Greninja's teammates that switch in.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Choice Band Talonflame always OHKOs Greninja with Brave Bird. However, Focus Sash Greninja easily KOes Talonflame in return with Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr, Scrafty, and even Lucario check Greninja well. They can usually take a hit and retaliate back with a KO or threaten it with priority.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mawile</strong>: Mega Mawile hard counters Greninja because of its typing and bulk. Its Play Rough OHKOes Greninja, and Sucker Punch easily KOes Greninja after any bit of chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Rage Powder and Follow Me Users</strong>: Greninja cannot do anything against Pokemon that use Rage Powder and Follow Me. They can generally sponge a hit, leaving Greninja exposed to powerful attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is necessary over Scald because Greninja needs Hydro Pump's power to guarantee OHKOs on Gengar, Lucario, and 252 HP / 116 SpD Rotom-H. Hydro Pump also nets several additional KOs when paired with Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out including Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y with a very small chance to KO uninvested Mega Kangaskhan. Ice Beam hits Venusaur and Amoonguss super effectively, and it is Greninja's strongest option on this set for Ferrothorn. Rock Slide OHKOs both Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, while Dark Pulse hits Aegislash and Reuniclus extremely hard. Protect is necessary so Greninja's partner can KO a threat without Greninja being harmed. It is not worth replacing Protect with an additional coverage move because Greninja would become too exposed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Greninja's damage output and Speed. A Timid nature allows Greninja to outspeed almost every viable VGC Pokemon without a Choice Scarf. Life Orb is nice for power, but Focus Sash is usable for longevity. However, Focus Sash is almost always outclassed by Life Orb because of Tyranitar's popularity and its ability, Sand Stream.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>One needs to make sure that Greninja is not targeted by enemy attacks that will likely KO it. Greninja has great utility as a lead because it can scout for Choice Scarf users, though it generally needs to Protect turn one to protect itself against Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out. In addition, Protecting helps to find specific Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Salamence, which will help the Greninja player throughout the duration of the game. Greninja can also be used regularly if opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon have been eliminated.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, or Choice Band Talonflame are all great partners, as they can protect Greninja from getting KOed by slower Pokemon, as well as provide offensive pressure. Mega Kangaskhan is an especially good partner because it can Fake Out opposing Choice Scarf users that would otherwise outspeed Greninja. Greninja can also be used in hail teams by replacing Ice Beam with Blizzard, which has more power and perfect accuracy in hail, and Greninja can KO Pokemon that resist Blizzard, such as Aegislash, with Dark Pulse.</p>"

  "Meowstic": {
    "overview": "<p>With seven other Prankster Pokemon available, Meowstic has its work cut out for it to stand out for a spot most teams. However, Meowstic's support movepool is a significant mark in its favor, as it features very important moves such as Safeguard, Light Screen, Reflect, and Thunder Wave. On top this, Meowstic has access to Fake Out, which can buy a free turn on the first turn it is in the battle. Meowstic also has a good Speed stat, which can allow it to naturally outspeed other support and bulky Pokemon without needing investment.</p> <p>Meowstic is odd in that it only has access to Prankster as its ability if it is male. Its pure Psychic type isn't a good defensive typing, especially with Tyranitar and Aegislash being very common. Meowstic is often forced to run an offensive move to prevent it being complete Taunt bait, and this is unfortunate as Meowstic has a mediocre Special Attack stat and will be unable to deal very much damage to anything. Even with Prankster and its great support movepool, Meowstic often finds itself outclassed by other support Pokemon, as they have bulk and handle common threats more reliably.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Meowstic gets Quick Guard, which can be used to block priority moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and an opposing Meowstic's support moves. Similarly, Protect can be run to scout out a move or let Meowstic's partner deal with a threats. However, this will be at a cost of a moveslot which would otherwise be used for support, and, unlike Quick Guard, it only protects Meowstic. Leftovers can be used if Sitrus Berry is already used elsewhere on the team. However, it won't often prevent 2HKOs, making Mental Herb a generally better item. Confide can be used to lower an opposing Pokemon's Special Attack stat by one stage, potentially multiple times. Its effects even go through Protect. Despite this, it is still largely outclassed by Light Screen, as Light Screen halves the special damage done against your entire team rather than lowering the special damage output of only one of your opponent's Pokemon by just one stage. Rain Dance can be used to remove Mega Charizard Y's sun and Tyranitar's sand and also to support Pokemon like Ludicolo that aren't dependent on rain but still appreciate its presence. Equally, Sunny Day can be used to set up sun and simultaneously take down rain and sand. Meowstic can use Trick Room to reverse attack order and then continue to support its team from there. Trick, when used alongside a Lagging Tail or a Choice item, can be used to disrupt opposing strategies by forcing opponents to move last or get locked into a single move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Super Effective Moves</strong>: Strong attackers that can hit Meowstic with super effective moves that do more than 62.5% damage can 2HKO even through Sitrus Berry. The two which stand out the most are Aegislash and Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt completely shuts down Meowstic, forcing it to only use Psychic, which won't deal very much damage.</p> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore locks Meowstic into the same move it used last, potentially making it unable to support its team properly, if at all.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard</strong>: As Quick Guard now blocks Prankster moves, it can be used to block Meowstic's support moves. Talonflame is the most notable user of Quick Guard.</p> <p><strong>Safeguard</strong>: Safeguard prevents Meowstic from using Thunder Wave and Swagger against the opposing team, stopping it from fulfilling its primary role.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Given the presence of Will-O-Wisp, Safeguard helps protect your physical attackers from burns. It can also be used to buff your own physical attackers as it also blocks self-inflicted status, meaning that Meowstic can use Swagger against its partner and give a +2 Attack boost without confusing them, even if they do not carry a Lum or Persim Berry. Swagger also gives Meowstic a way away to confuse opposing Special Attackers and only give them a 48.5% percent chance including accuracy to successfully pull off their desired attack. The third moveslot can be used for Thunder Wave, which, in tandem with confusion, further limits opposing attack chance down to one turn out of every eight, and also halves its target's Speed stat, allowing potentially slower Pokemon to move before them. Dual Screens could be run decreasing the amount of damage taken by Meowstic and its partner, but running either Light Screen or Reflect separately is plausible as well in order to cover a weaker defense. Charm can be used to halve the physical attack of opposing Pokemon and can be used multiple times, decreasing incoming damage by a lot more than Reflect would. However, unlike Reflect, the opponent can switch out their Pokemon to reset its Attack stat, so the effect is not lasting. Psychic gives Meowstic an attacking option if it fears Taunt. However, it doesn't hit particularly hard. Fake Out could also be run on the fourth moveslot to get a free first turn and ease predictions as well.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread with a Bold nature is run to survive a Return from Mega Kangaskhan or a sun-boosted Heat Wave from Mega Charizard Y. However, you can run more bulk on either side, depending on the rest of the team. Sitrus Berry is Meowstic's primary item as it often turns 2HKOs into 3HKOs. Mental Herb should only be used if Meowstic fears Taunt and Encore. This allows Meowstic to use another support move on the next turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As a support Pokemon, Meowstic is intrinsically useful at all points of the game, and should be used to disrupt the opposing team in order to support your own. That said, there will be points where a more offensive approach is needed, and in those situations, knowing when to switch out is important. As Meowstic has little or no offensive presence, it is never advisable to run Meowstic alongside any other support Pokemon as you will only be able to deal very little direct damage against your opponent's side, all while also acting as potential setup bait.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physical attackers such as Mega Mawile, Mega Kangaskhan, and faster Pokemon like such as Aerodactyl hugely benefit from Meowstic's support. Safeguard and Swagger support together turn these already powerful threats into absolute monsters, allowing them to achieve multiple OHKOs all without fearing status such as burn and sleep. Fighting- and Dark-types also help take care of many of the Pokemon that threaten Meowstic. Such as Scrafty, Mienshao, and Tyranitar.</p>"

  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Gardevoir has carved a solid niche in the metagame as a specially attacking Fairy-type due to the relative lack of ones that are legal. This makes it a great Dragon-type check, most notably being able to beat the common 'double dragon' core of Garchomp and Salamence. Add on to this its overdose of supportive options and access to two great abilities in Trace and Telepathy, along with just enough special bulk to switch into special hits once or twice, and you have a one of the best Pokemon in the format. However, its lackluster physical bulk means that it struggles to take moderately powerful physical hits while also being unable to handle any common priority move outside of Mach Punch, and it is weak to one of the more common of said moves in the format, Bullet Punch, meaning that it really struggles versus Scizor and Mega Lucario. In addition to its nonexistent physical bulk, Gardevoir's stats are overall middling, with a high Special Attack, moderately high Special Defense, and rather low numbers in the rest of its stats, most notably its underwhelming base 80 Speed for an offensive Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gardevoir has a wide movepool, giving it a variety of other options that it can use. However, many of them are outclassed by the options listed or other Pokemon. You can use an Assault Vest set to reasonable effect, boosting Gardevoir's already good special bulk to very high levels while working well in conjunction with Gardevoir's high Special Attack stat. However, Gardevoir's inability to use its wide range of supportive options, lack of recovery, and lackluster Speed stat mean that this set isn't usually worthwhile. Thunder Wave can be used over Taunt, Trick Room, or Will-O-Wisp, but you are generally better off using Pokemon like Meowstic and Ferrothorn for Thunder Wave support. Ally Switch is a nice surprise if you want a psuedo-Follow Me, although the inability to spam it and how easy it is to play around makes it a relatively poor option. Babiri Berry is an option to allow Gardevoir to take Steel-type attacks from Pokemon such as Scizor, Mega Lucario, and Aegislash better onceâ€”as well as being a great option to get around Item Clause if both Sitrus Berry and Safety Goggles are needed on other Pokemonâ€”but Gardevoir has better uses of its item slot, and its effect is extremely niche on a Pokemon like Gardevoir.</p> <p>A Mega Gardevoir set with Round in conjunction with faster users of the move like Pyroar allow immense single-target power, but it is extremely team- and matchup-reliant, meaning that it isn't usually worth it. Other supportive options like dual screens and Heal Pulse can be used, but Rotom-W and Meowstic-M are better users of the former, while Clawitzer and Lucario are better users of the latter. Finally, Focus Blast or Hidden Power Fire can be used on the 'Choice Attacker' set to catch Steel-types, with the former also OHKOing 4 HP or 252 HP variants of Mega Kangaskhan, depending on what item it holds, but they are poor moves to be locked into due to the former's low accuracy and the latter's low Base Power, especially on a Pokemon as physically frail as Gardevoir.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Users of Bullet Punch such as Mega Lucario and Scizor can deal serious damage to Gardevoir. Similarly, Talonflame's 120 Base Power priority means that it can very easily dent Gardevoir sufficiently.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical attackers can take advantage of Gardevoir's nonexistent physical bulk, making Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Gyarados good counters.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Rotom-W and Mega Charizard Y have little difficulty coming in on Gardevoir due to their high special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out</strong>: Fake Out can very easily stop Gardevoir in its tracks and cause it to faint prematurely, making common users such as Meowstic and Kangaskhan good checks.</p> <p><strong>Protect Mega Gengar</strong>: Gengar can use Protect on the turn it Mega Evolves and then outpace and OHKO Gardevoir with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash</strong>: Aegislash can easily take any hit aside from Shadow Ball and deal heavy damage back with any STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn walls Gardevoir outside of a rouge Hidden Power Fire or Focus Blast and can OHKO back with Gyro Ball.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is the main STAB move that Gardevoir will be spamming, with a high Base Power, great typing, and a nasty 30% chance to lower its target's Special Attack stat. Gardevoir doesn't usually use its other attacks because Moonblast is so good, but it has a few other moves it can run to increase its overall utility and coverage. Psychic fixes its coverage versus Fire- and Poison-types, hitting the former neutrally and the latter super effectively. This is used over Psyshock due to a combination of Gardevoir needing all the power it can get and the relatively physically defensive nature of the metagame. Dazzling Gleam is nice to take out weakened opponents, as it gets chip damage on the partner of the Pokemon that is being KOed, and it is always nice to have when there are two weakened Pokemon on the field that are in range of being KOed. Additionally, Dazzling Gleam is great for breaking the Focus Sashes of Pokemon like Smeargle, and it OHKOes double dragons 100% of the time after a little prior damage when Gardevoir holds a Choice Scarf, while guaranteeing it without any prior damage with the boost from Choice Specs with the given EV spread. The last moveslot is entirely team-reliant: Thunderbolt hits Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y harder than Gardevoir's other options, although you must be cautious of the former's Brave Bird, while Shadow Ball allows Gardevoir to get around Aegislash and opposing Gardevoir effectively, although an Iron Head or Flash Cannon from the former is going to hurt a lot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>There are lots of possible EV spreads that Gardevoir can run, and the ones listed here are only a small number of the viable ones. The EVs that are on the main set allow Gardevoir to survive a Bullet Punch from Mega Lucario when at full health while outpacing all Mega Tyranitar variants either before or after a boost, depending on its item. If Gardevoir is holding a Choice Scarf, a spread of 140 Def / 140 SpA / 228 Spe can be used to outpace Noivern while always OHKOing Garchomp with Moonblast; a more powerful version of this spread (28 Def / 252 SpA / 228 Spe) can be used if you feel that bulk is not an issue, although Talonflame's Brave Bird will score a guaranteed OHKO. Gardevoir can run 84 Def / 252 SpA / 172 Spe with a Timid nature to outpace Adamant Gyarados before or after a Dragon Dance, depending on its item, although Talonflame will once again guarantee an OHKO with Brave Bird while Garchomp has a 12% chance to survive Moonblast from full health. When running Choice Scarf, a spread of 12 HP / 92 Def / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 148 Spe allows Gardevoir to outpace max Speed base 110s while having a 50% chance of surviving Adamant Life Orb Talonflame's Brave Bird from full health. As for Gardevoir's ability, Telepathy should be used if you are going to be using Gardevoir in a core with a user of Earthquake, Surf, or Discharge, but Trace should always be used otherwise due to its nifty, albeit situational, utility in giving Gardevoir the chance to copy powerful abilities like Parental Bond or the rare Competitive.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If possible, avoid switching Gardevoir in on anything aside from resisted attacks and weak or middling neutral special attacks. Use Gardevoir to threaten and KO Dragon- and Dark-types; mostly spam Moonblast unless the situation demands otherwise or it will give you an advantage in the long term to do something else.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with Intimidate are great, as they allow Gardevoir to take physical hits better, making Salamence and Scrafty good partners. Anything that is capable of beating Steel- or Fire-types such the aforementioned duo and Krookodile makes Gardevoir's life a little easier. Powerful attackers like Mega Charizard Y help Gardevoir break down bulky opponents more effectively due to its generally middling power. Ghost-, Fighting-, and Dark-types such as Aegislash, Scrafty, Lucario, and Tyranitar have good natural synergy with Gardevoir, as they break down the things that Gardevoir can't, while it beats the Pokemon that they struggle to beat with its STAB attacks. Mawile is a great teammate, as it allows you to bring in a Fairy-type when the matchup is out of Gardevoir's favor. Finally, if Gardevoir has Telepathy, users of attacks like Earthquake, such as Garchomp, are good partners to take advantage of it.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks have great neutral coverage together due to Psychic hitting the Poison- and Fire-types that resist Fairy while your choice of Fairy-type move hits Dark-types, which are immune to Psychic, super effectively. Dazzling Gleam is recommended as Gardevoir's Fairy-type STAB move as it hits Dragon-types on the switch regardless of which side of the field gets switched out, 2HKOing the common double dragons. This makes it more of a support move due to it easing prediction for Gardevoir immensely. However, Moonblast is also an option, as it is far more spammable than Dazzling Gleam due to its higher Base Power, while the high chance to lower its target's Special Attack is also a factor because it helps out teammates with low Special Defense stats. Psychic is chosen over Psyshock due to the physically defensive nature of the metagame. Will-O-Wisp is a great supportive option, as it gives Gardevoir a better way of dealing with Dragon-types when they are already in. Additionally, the utility of burning physical attackers is huge. Trick Room is a nice option to counter Trick Room teams if your team is particularly weak to them, or to set it up for teams that utilize it. On the other hand, Taunt can be used on fast teams that enjoy its ability to block the use of Rage Powder, Spore, Dark Void, Thunder Wave, and Swagger, although you must remember that it doesn't block Pachirisu's Nuzzle. Protect can be used over either of these moves, or it can be used over Will-O-Wisp if the team desperately needs either Trick Room or Taunt support.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EV spread allows Gardevoir to always survive Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird and fully invested Aegislash's Shadow Ball or Flash Cannon from full health, OHKOing 4 HP variants of the former after the recoil from Brave Bird 91% of the time. Additionally, it allows Gardevoir to always survive Mega Kangaskhan's Return from full health if it is holding a Sitrus Berry. Trace is usually preferred due to its great supportive utility, although Telepathy can be used if your team utilizes Earthquake. Sitrus Berry is the recommended item, as it allows Gardevoir to survive Mega Kangaskhan's Return, although Safety Goggles is also an option if you want to block Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder to cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp or Taunt opposing supporters.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set focuses less on trying to OHKO things with Moonblast and more on supporting the team and checking Dragon-types defensively, although it is still a nice perk if you do choose to run Moonblast. Burn physically attacking non-Fire-types whenever possible, and Taunt particularly disruptive Pokemon like Amoonguss, Smeargle, and Pachirisu as quickly as you can. Finally, aim to bring Gardevoir in on Dragon-type attacks if you can due to how well Gardevoir checks them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon which benefit from Will-O-Wisp support, such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, are good teammates for Gardevoir due to its ability to cripple physical attackers like Garchomp, as well as weaken Tyranitar's Rock Slides. Fighting-, Ghost-, and Dark-types have very good synergy with Gardevoir, making Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Lucario, Aegislash, and Scrafty good teammates. Pokemon that benefit from Trick Room or its reversal enjoy Gardevoir's presence, making Ferrothorn, Mawile, Garchomp, and Salamence good teammates. Speaking of Garchomp and Salamence, Dragon-types in general have very good synergy with Gardevoir due to how Dragon- and Fairy-types cover a lot of each other's weaknesses. Additionally, Pokemon that benefit from Dragon-types being eliminated, such as bulky Rotom-A and Talonflame, are good teammates. Finally, if Gardevoir has Telepathy, users of Earthquake like Garchomp are great teammates for obvious reasons.</p>"

  "Aegislash": {
    "overview": "<p>In Shield forme, Aegislash has outstanding 60 / 150 / 150 defensive stats, allowing it to take many hits and proceed to retaliate powerfully in Blade forme. On top of its natural bulk, Aegislash has a great Steel / Ghost defensive typing, and although Steel-types no longer resist Dark- and Ghost-type moves, Aegislash resists nine types and is immune to three. Thanks to its Ghost typing, it doesn't have to worry about Fake Out, thus easing prediction on your behalf. King's Shield, Aegislash's signature move, acts like Protect by blocking attacking moves, but lets through status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Taunt. King's Shield also halves an attacker's Attack stat when Aegislash is hit by a contact move. Aegislash has a STAB priority move in Shadow Sneak, which is beneficial in a metagame focused on Speed. Because it is so bulky, Aegislash is an ideal user of Weakness Policy, which allows it to double both its attacking stats when hit by a super effective move.</p> <p>Outside of switching out, King's Shield is the only way that Aegislash can change back to its bulkier Shield forme. However, the move is quite predictable and can set your other Pokemon up to be double-targeted. Furthermore, it lets status moves through, making Aegislash vulnerable to Will-O-Wisp and Taunt. The former weakens Aegislash's physical attacks and saps its HP, while the latter completely shuts it down, forcing it to switch or be KOed. Aegislash's viable movepool is small and this makes it quite predictable. A bad prediction can leave Aegislash in its frailer Blade forme, setting it up to be KOed by super effective moves, such as Fire- and Ground-type moves. Due to Aegislash's highly temperamental ability, it faces stiff competition for the role of the offensive Steel-type from Ferrothorn, Mawile, and Scizor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An alternative STAB option for Aegislash is Gyro Ball, which can be very strong against faster opponents. However, it is generally worse than Iron Head and Flash Cannon due to its inconsistent damage output. Rock Slide can be used, but it comes at the cost of coverage or priority, and tempts you to act recklessly against Fire-types, which hinders Aegislash's survivability. Aegislash gets Wide Guard and Destiny Bond, both of which are interesting support options. Wide Guard was buffed greatly this generation, as it no longer fails when used in succession. Wide Guard blocks Heat Wave and Earthquake, two of the most threatening moves to Aegislash, whereas Destiny Bond can be used to take down an opposing Pokemon. However, this may be difficult given Aegislash's low Speed stat. Head Smash is a powerful single-target move that provides additional coverage, but induces heavy recoil and suffers from the same problems as Rock Slide does. Hidden Power Ice can be used as well, but the move is very situational and is most likely a waste of a moveslot due to its low Base Power. Minimum Speed isn't a requirement, and with some investment, Aegislash can outspeed Mawile and Azumarill. However, Speed investment can be risky as it means that Aegislash might need to tank an attack in Blade forme.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Super Effective Moves</strong>: Super effective hits from Fire-, Ground-, and Dark-type Pokemon will either 2HKO or OHKO Aegislash in Shield forme, and definitely OHKO it in Blade forme. Mega Charizard Y can OHKO Aegislash with a sun-boosted Overheat, and with some bulk investment, doesn't take too much damage from Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt renders King's Shield unusable, forcing Aegislash to switch out or tank attacks in Blade forme.</p> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Equipped with an Assault Vest, Pokemon such as Ludicolo and Clawitzer can comfortably take Aegislash's special moves. Clawitzer can 2HKO Aegislash with a Mega Launcher-boosted Dark Pulse.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This is Aegislash's most common set, and for good reason, as it isn't completely dependent on using King's Shield every other turn. When behind a Substitute, Aegislash can attack on multiple turns in succession, and by correctly using King's Shield, it can maintain Substitute due to its great natural bulk. The attacking moves on this set are Aegislash's two main special STAB options. Running a fully special set might be advisable due to the omnipresence of Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate to check many of this generation's biggest threats, thereby limiting their impact on Aegislash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP allows Aegislash in Shield forme to take just about any move other than a STAB super effective hit, while the Special Attack EVs grant it more power. A Quiet nature boosts the strength of Aegislash's special moves and lowers its Speed, allowing it to attack after the opponent and tank hits in Shield forme. Leftovers improves Aegislash's longevity and can potentially allow it to get more than four Substitutes or stop it being 2HKOed. However, Aegislash can also run Weakness Policy to pick up extra KOs at +2.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set plays best towards the end of the match, as once Aegislash's checks and counters are removed, it can win matches by itself thanks to its great natural bulk. An ideal point to set up a Substitute is when facing Pokemon whose only means to hit Aegislash is with Sucker Punch, as this means it can get up a free Substitute unhindered. When Aegislash is behind a Substitute, King's Shield should still be used to weaken physical attackers and maintain the Substitute when appropriate, though it cannot be used twice in a row.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aegislash's main weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-type attacks are well covered by Garchomp and Rotom-W. Garchomp is better at clearing the field for Aegislash to come in later, as using Earthquake is counterproductive due to Aegislash's Steel typing. However, Rock Slide is very useful when it comes to removing Charizard from the field. Rotom-W supports Aegislash by weakening physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp and taking on many of its checks and counters with Hydro Pump and Thunderbolt. Dual screens support makes this set very hard to take down, as few attacks can break Aegislash's Substitute when it is in Shield forme. Dual screens also help to turn attacks from OHKOs and 2HKOs into 2HKOs or 3HKOs, respectively. Mega Kangaskhan has good offensive synergy with Aegislash, and can use Fake Out to help it set up a Substitute with greater ease.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>King's Shield is a must on all sets to allow Aegislash to capitalize on both its offensive and defensive stats. The move also allows Aegislash to halve an opponent's Attack when it is hit by a contact move. Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon are this set's main attacking moves. Shadow Sneak allows Aegislash to finish off faster weakened opponents, though the move is risky as it changes Aegislash into Blade forme at the start of the turn. Aegislash can run Sacred Sword instead, allowing it to attain perfect coverage in tandem with its Ghost-type moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs ensure that Aegislash will usually move last, allowing it to tank an attack in Shield forme. Maximum investment in HP and Special Attack allows Aegislash to take many of the common super effective hits in the format and hit back hard with a boosted move. For example, Aegislash can survive a Sucker Punch from both Mega Mawile and Mega Kangaskhan as well as a Crunch or Dark Pulse from Tyranitar. After Weakness Policy is activated, Aegislash can utilize a +2 Flash Cannon or Shadow Ball to take down many of the most common Pokemon in the format and finish off weakened threats with Shadow Sneak. On the other hand, Lum Berry can be run to shield Aegislash from a status move, giving it slightly more room for error with King's Shield.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aegislash is effective in all stages of the game due to its huge bulk and high offensive stats. This being said, Aegislash should not be brought in prematurely, as although it is bulky, it cannot shrug off multiple super effective or boosted hits. Once certain threats have been taken care of, Aegislash can run rampant through the opposing team. As a result, you will often find that Aegislash is most useful late in the game. However, if you think that the opposing team cannot deal with Aegislash, it can function as a devastating lead, severely denting opposing Pokemon and allowing the rest of your team to clean up later.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aegislash needs Fire- and Ground-types to be taken down before it can function successfully. Because of this, Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Garchomp are very good partners, as they all have good bulk and can take down the Pokemon that threaten it. Fighting-types such as Scrafty, Mienshao, and Conkeldurr are also good partners that can take on Dark-types.</p>"

  "Noivern": {
    "overview": "<p>Noivern is a very interesting and useful newcomer to VGC 2014. It is the fastest unboosted Dragon-type in the format, which makes it an excellent check to non-Choice Scarf Salamence, Hydreigon, and, most importantly, Garchomp. Unlike other Dragon-type Pokemon, Noivern's movepool gives it the ability to use a full support set successfully. Its ability, Frisk, is a very helpful ability to have in VGC so you don't get surprised by niche held items. Noivern's ability to support a VGC team and check other Dragon-types well is where it carves its niche, despite its sub-standard Special Attack when compared to other Dragon-types of the format. Noivern's bulk is also sub-standard, so it will usually have to rely on Focus Sash or heavy bulk investment in order to function properly. On top of this, Noivern also faces competition from Aerodactyl as a speedy support Pokemon and Salamence as a Dragon-type check. Despite this, Noivern does have a very distinct place in the VGC format. Its ability to check dangerous Dragon-types and provide speedy support is something no other Pokemon in the format can do.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Pulse is a 100% accurate alternative to Draco Meteor that doesn't have any negative after effects. However, it is pathetically weak when compared to Draco Meteor, and with Noivern's mediocre Special Attack and access to Super Fang, Draco Meteor is better. Flamethrower can be used to fry Ferrothorn and Scizor and do good damage to Bisharp and Mega Mawile, and it can be used to wear down Aegislash behind its Substitute when used alongside Infiltrator. Hurricane is a strong STAB option that most notably takes care of Amoonguss. It works best when used on a Rain Dance team due to Hurricane's bad 70% accuracy outside of rain and crippling 50% accuracy in sun. Roost gives Noivern a recovery option and gives it the excellent pure Dragon typing for a turn. Only use it on the bulky EV spread because otherwise it isn't worth the moveslot. Telepathy is almost entirely inferior to Frisk or Infiltrator, but can be used on Discharge teams if need be.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar limits Noivern to only one move by having Rock Slide or Ice Beam bring Noivern down to its Focus Sash and then having sandstorm finish it off. The best thing Noivern can do is use Super Fang on Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Mamoswine</strong>: Mamoswine limits Noivern to one turn with its priority Ice Shard or Icicle Spear. It will get severely crippled by Draco Meteor should Noivern attack it, though.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Talonflame limits Noivern to one move by 2HKOing it with priority Brave Bird. It does not like taking a Draco Meteor, though.</p> <p><strong>Aerodactyl</strong>: Aerodactyl outspeeds Noivern and threatens to 2HKO with Rock Slide as well as potentially flinching Noivern and its partner. Noivern can set up Tailwind if Aerodactyl isn't carrying Taunt to make use of two turns as a result, if it doesn't flinch. If Aerodactyl carries Taunt, then it can stop Noivern from using Tailwind altogether.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Having Noivern's partner paralyzed is a major problem, as it makes Noivern's Tailwind useless. Prankster Thunder Wave users are particularly annoying, especially Klefki, which is immune to Draco Meteor.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility Dragon": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tailwind is one of the best speed control moves in the game. It gives Noivern the niche of a supportive Pokemon and should be used no matter what. Draco Meteor allows Noivern to check Dragon-types, some of the biggest threats in VGC 2014. Despite Noivern's mediocre Special Attack, Draco Meteor is still a 130 Base Power move boosted by STAB and can be used to dent any Pokemon that lacks resistance or immunity to it. Super Fang is an excellent option to run alongside Draco Meteor, as its ability to halve an opponent's HP puts a lot of Pokemon into Draco Meteor KO range and it isn't affected by Draco Meteor's Special Attack-lowering side effect. It can also be used to set up KOs for Noivern's partner. Protect is almost a given on any VGC Pokemon that isn't carrying a Choice item, as it allows Noivern to block Fake Out so its Focus Sash isn't broken before it can even move. Taunt is used to shut down Trick Room setters other than Aromatisse, and can also be used to cripple Smeargle and other pure support Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment gives Noivern the ability to outrun everything up to and including Greninja while still having Draco Meteor do as much damage as possible. Focus Sash helps Noivern set up Tailwind, despite its subpar bulk, and allows it to check Choice Scarf Dragon-types as long as Noivern hasn't taken prior damage. A bulkier spread of 156 HP / 252 SpA / 96 Spe with a Timid nature still allows Noivern to outpace Garchomp and forgo a Focus Sash if the item is needed elsewhere, but the main spread is otherwise better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Always Protect against Fake Out users the first turn they are on the field. This guarantees that Noivern's Focus Sash will not be broken just for Noivern to flinch or fall to a double target. If you suspect your opponent has a Choice Scarf Salamence or Hydreigon, keeping Noivern's Focus Sash intact gives you another check to them. Set up Tailwind only when needed, as the move only lasts four turns in total, and two turns if your opponent has dual Protect users. Tailwind also allows Noivern to check the Scarf Dragon-types listed above even if its Focus Sash has been broken. Use Super Fang to bring Pokemon into the KO range of Noivern's partner or Noivern's own Draco Meteor. Using Taunt on Trick Room users is always a good idea. If you suspect a Fake Out and Trick Room lead from your opponent, Noivern should not be one of the four Pokemon you choose to bring.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with very strong offensive presences are some of the best partners Noivern can have. Strong attackers that can flatten key Pokemon in a single turn, such as Mega Mawile and Choice Specs Gardevoir, discourage and punish the opponent for double targeting Noivern in order to KO it through its Focus Sash. These Pokemon also benefit greatly from Noivern's Tailwind. Mega Kangaskhan deserves its own mention, as it has a ridiculous offensive presence from the moment it is sent out and can punish a double target on Noivern even greater than most with Parental Bond Power-Up Punch. Mega Kangaskhan also appreciates Noivern's ability to KO Garchomp and Tailwind doubling its Speed. Rotom-H loves having Dragon-types removed, especially Garchomp.</p>"

  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>VGC14, and by extension Generation VI, was none too kind to Dragon-types, nerfing Draco Meteor, introducing Fairy-types, and banning the premier Dragon, Latios. As if to fill the void, Charizard was given a new Mega Evolution that plays similarly to the Dragons of days old, with insanely powerful Overheats nuking any Pokemon that are not specially defensive (and even some that are), good coverage with Solar Beam, and reliable spread damage in the form of Heat Wave. As a twist of fate, its new ability Drought allows Mega Charizard Y to consistently defeat its long-time rival Blastoise, as well as more prominent Water-types such as Rotom-W and Politoed. Mega Charizard X was actually granted the Dragon-type and plays so differently from the more common Mega Charizard Y that it can turn a match on its head in the likely event that it can capitalize on that initial surprise. Dragon Dance allows Mega Charizard X to play similarly to Volcarona in VGC12, and although it does lack the spread damage option that made Volcarona so feared, it does enough damage to a single target to make up for this.</p> <p>As always however, there are some catches to using Charizard. While it's difficult to KO it with Thunderbolts, Rock Slide from any decently strong Pokemon can quickly clip Mega Charizard Y's wings, and given the wide distribution of the move, it can come out of nowhere and instantly KO Charizard. It's also incredibly dependent on the weather staying in its favor, which means after it Mega Evolves, Tyranitar and Politoed can easily come in, wall, and OHKO Charizard with their STAB moves. In the same vein, Mega Charizard X is easily checked by Intimidate and faster Dragons such as Garchomp and Choice Scarf Salamence. This, and the fact that it doesn't have any spread coverage outside of the significantly weaker Heat Wave, makes it easier to play around, even if the opponent is thrown off by its surprise Mega Evolution.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Charizard Y doesn't have much room to fit in moves outside of the third slot, so it's best if you look at your options in that sense. Fire Pledge is an odd option, but it can actually be rather viable when partnered with Venusaur's Grass Pledge to create a fiery field that does damage over time. This not only does heavy damage on the first attack, but allows you to get chip damage on important targets such as Rotom-W to comfortably OHKO them without having to actually attack them first.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice can deal with Garchomp and Salamence should you be using Wide Guard to grab a surprise OHKO on those two, as Mega Charizard Y usually doesn't have anything to really hit those two with. Dragon Pulse is significantly weaker but still does solid damage to those two as well as other Pokemon outside of sun. However, both Dragon Pulse and Hidden Power Ice are largely situational, as Charizard really shouldn't be trying to attack these Pokemon in these situations anyway; Mega Charizard Y is generally much less threatening outside of sun regardless of what third option you decide on.</p> <p>Sunny Day and Sky Drop are more supportive options and aren't usually a good idea considering how Charizard should be the one being supported, but if you consider an additional Fire-type move to be redundant, they may be worth your while. Sky Drop is basically a free Fake Out depending on whether or not Charizard is faster than whatever it uses Sky Drop on, as well as how heavy the target is. Sunny Day keeps the sun shining for more than five turns and, more importantly, it turns the tables on Rain Dance users such as Ludicolo and Meowstic that aim to set the rain after Charizard Mega Evolves. However, Sunny Day has limited use outside of these two scenarios.</p> <p>Naturally, Mega Charizard X is more physically oriented, so it has Charizard's physical movepool to toy with. Defensively, Mega Charizard X makes better use of Roost and Will-O-Wisp than Mega Charizard Y does, and it could run a bulkier set with an Impish nature that aims to check various Grass- and Steel-types such as Amoonguss and Aegislash without being as worried about being OHKOed by a stray Rock Slide. However, a bulkier Mega Charizard X does face competition from Rotom-H, Chandelure, and even Moltres for the role of a bulky Fire-type, each of which don't even require Mega Evolving and can therefore hold useful items such as Leftovers, Sitrus Berry, and Charti Berry.</p> <p>Offensively, Mega Charizard X has Rock Slide to hit Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y and a few other neat moves that get boosted by Tough Claws such as Shadow Claw, Steel Wing, and Brick Break, though it's hard to find a moveslot for any of these options given the impeccable coverage granted by its Dragon- and Fire-type STAB combination. It unfortunately doesn't have an alternate physical Fire-type STAB option, but it does have a few options for Dragon-type STAB moves in Outrage and Dragon Rush. While both of these moves are more powerful than Dragon Claw, the inherit inconsistencies of the 75% accuracy of Dragon Rush and the random targeting of Outrage make them weaker choices.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Weather Control</strong>: As Mega Charizard Y, Charizard is reliant on sunlight, if Solar Beam is any indication. Politoed, Hippowdon, and Tyranitar are natural enemies of Mega Charizard Y because of their abilities Sand Stream and Drizzle, although they are in danger of being hit with Solar Beam if caught inside the sunlight. Tyranitar is also capable of reinstating its own sandstorm via Mega Evolution while also threatening a 4x super effective Rock Slide, and it can even take advantage of Charizard's Protect with a well-timed Dragon Dance. Manual weather change is also effective. Rain Dance is an obvious choice given how it neuters both Fire-type moves and Solar Beam and grants Prankster users such as Meowstic-M and Sableye access to priority weather control due to its wide distribution. Kingdra and Ludicolo can also spare a moveslot for the move considering their alliance with Politoed, and they can often prove to be very useful should the team find itself having trouble with Charizard.</p> <p><strong>Rock Slide</strong>: Garchomp threatens with Rock Slide, can outspeed any Charizard thanks to its convenient Speed tier, can pack a Lum Berry for any potential Venusaur partners, and resists its Fire-type moves. Salamence is in a similar camp because it usually runs a Choice Scarf, although it often has to rely on the unreliable Stone Edge to pick up an OHKO. Basically, anything with a Rock-type move and a respectable Attack stat can threaten Mega Charizard Y, although after one Intimidate, any Pokemon that doesn't receive a STAB boost will often miss out on an OHKO or struggle to do so.</p> <p><strong>Type Advantages for Mega Charizard Y</strong>: Mega Manectric, Zapdos, and Rotom-H can threaten Mega Charizard Y with strong Thunderbolts, and in Rotom-H and Manectric's case, even take advantage of the sunlight with their own Overheats. Rotom-H also resists Mega Charizard Y's moves and occasionally opts for a pair of Safety Goggles, making it a solid check to Charizard / Venusaur leads. Other Pokemon that can tank Charizard's hits include Goodra and Chandelure. Goodra, like Rotom-H, can give Venusaur trouble with Sap Sipper, can deal consistent damage to Charizard, doesn't take much from Charizard thanks to its Dragon typing as well as its massive base 150 Special Defense, and can even prevent Charizard from using Protect against a Rock Slide, courtesy of its access to Feint. Chandelure can outright wall Mega Charizard Y with Flash Fire, leaving it free to either utilize the sunlight with its own Heat Wave, further boosted by Flash Fire, set up a Substitute, or set up Trick Room. Other notable Pokemon that resist Charizard's attacks include Hydreigon with its powerful Draco Meteor, Moltres with the occasional Ancient Power, and Mega Ampharos, which deals with Charizard in the same manner as Goodra.</p> <p><strong>Team Preview</strong>: Mega Charizard X can be a huge problem to deal with if you're caught off guard. This problem is compounded by the fact that Mega Charizard X can't be easily sniffed out on Team Preview, so it might be worth taking note of the opponent's team to look for clues as to which forme Charizard will take. A huge indicator of Mega Charizard X on Team Preview is Amoonguss, which would be replaced with a Venusaur if it were Mega Charizard Y, as well as the absence of Pokemon like Mamoswine and Scrafty, which are more commonly paired with Mega Charizard Y. Generally, Mega Charizard Y teams are usually much more focused around it with options such as Venusaur, while Mega Charizard X teams will seem looser with more commonly used Pokemon such as Amoonguss. Pay attention to Team Preview for any telltale signs of a Mega Charizard X, since checking it will be harder to do if you bring your Mega Manectric or Rotom-H and expect them to do the heavy lifting.</p> <p><strong>Type Advantages for Mega Charizard X</strong>: Faster Dragon-types such as Noivern, Choice Scarf Salamence, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon threaten Mega Charizard X after Mega Evolution and before a Dragon Dance. Noivern in particular is useful to Frisk Charizard's Charizardite to confirm any suspicions you may have as to its true forme. Garchomp is generally useful to check Charizard, although it has a hard time KOing Mega Charizard X, despite its super effective STAB Dragon Claw. However, if it can manage to get about 20-30% worth of its health chipped off, which can be easier if it's baited into a Flare Blitz or two, Garchomp can be a decent check to Mega Charizard X as well. While Mega Charizard X isn't reliant on weather, it does get handily checked by Kingdra, which can outspeed Mega Charizard X even after a Dragon Dance inside rain and can obviously OHKO it with Draco Meteor. Azumarill can wall Mega Charizard X thanks to its unique Water / Fairy typing and can 2HKO it with Play Rough or even take the opportunity to set up a Belly Drum and then OHKO it with Play Rough. Outside of these threats, Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Aerodactyl can still deal hefty damage with Rock Slide, even with only a 2x super effective hit and Mega Charizard X's greater Defense; they can also switch in on a Flare Blitz, though Dragon Claw will still deal good damage against the two, especially if Mega Charizard X can get a boost beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Speed control, although rare in VGC14, is a huge threat to Mega Charizard X. Trick Room in particular is not very kind to it due to its tendency to boost its Speed, making it easier to set up for Pokemon such as Mega Mawile or Mega Ampharos, which Charizard would normally check. The more threatening users are Slowbro and Aromatisse, as they resist or are immune to one of Mega Charizard X's STAB moves. Thunder Wave and Tailwind are also good options for speed control, with the notable users being Gyarados and Rotom-A for Thunder Wave and Aerodactyl and Talonflame for Tailwind. While Rotom-H can't do much by itself once Charizard is paralyzed, Rotom-W and Gyarados can at least chip away at it with Hydro Pump and Waterfall, respectively. Aerodactyl is always a good Charizard check, and with Tailwind, it forces Charizard to set up three Dragon Dances to outspeed anything during those three turns, allowing teams to more easily deal with Mega Charizard X, provided they can take advantage of those three turns. Talonflame doesn't necessarily need Tailwind to outspeed Mega Charizard X, but if it isn't in Brave Bird KO range, it might be wise to let the team deal a little damage beforehand. Choice Band Talonflame variants are also effective in checking Mega Charizard Y, although if either Charizard invests enough in bulk, Talonflame will be easily picked off due to its natural frailty and Brave Bird recoil.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Lastly, Intimidate is a good way to moderate how powerful Mega Charizard X can become and is a very welcome addition to any team, with other powerful physical attackers such as Mega Mawile and Mega Kangaskhan roaming the metagame. Salamence, again, can not only threaten Mega Charizard X with a Draco Meteor but can also offer Intimidate support. Scrafty can use Fake Out or even Taunt on Mega Charizard X to prevent it from setting up, and Gyarados can paralyze Charizard to prevent it from doing much of anything. Other Intimidate users such as Mega Manectric, Mega Mawile, Krookodile, and Staraptor can't really take Mega Charizard X's Flare Blitz or are hard to fit on teams, but any Intimidate user is worth bringing against Mega Charizard X.</p>",

      "Mega Charizard Y": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Heat Wave is a great STAB Fire-type move that Charizard can throw around without worrying as much about it getting blocked by Protect, and as such it's the main move it will be using. Solar Beam is equally important to make sure Charizard can threaten the opponent's weather changing Pokemon when Drought is activated, mainly Tyranitar and Politoed, as well as Rotom-W and various Rock- or Ground-types. The third slot is usually reserved for a more powerful single-target option such as Overheat to OHKO bulkier Pokemon that may give Charizard trouble such as Scrafty. To give an example of Overheat's power, with a Modest nature, Charizard is capable of OHKOing 252 HP Mega Kangaskhan. Overheat can be replaced by Fire Blast or Flamethrower to avoid the Special Attack drop, though you should double check to make sure you're not missing out on any important KOs that your team may depend on. Ancient Power is an interesting third slot option if you don't see any need for a second Fire move. With the added Rock-type coverage, Charizard is free to OHKO Talonflame and other Mega Charizard Y, as well as enabling it to deal decent damage to Rotom-H or nab a free +1 in every stat once in a blue moon. Finally, Protect is rather non-negotiable because of Charizard's crippling weakness to Rock Slide. Protect buys time for allied Chlorophyll Pokemon to use Sleep Powder or OHKO any threatening Rock Slide users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Solar Power is the preferred ability in the event of a mirror match, where Charizard can actually outdamage Mega Charizard Y with Overheat to pick up an unexpected KO. It's especially important when using Ancient Power because it allows Charizard to OHKO opposing Charizard in every scenario, bar bulkier variants and Mega Charizard X. If you're not concerned with any of this or plan to Mega Evolve right off the bat, Blaze is the superior option to conserve bulk in the mirror match. A Modest nature is preferred in order to attain important OHKOs such as on 252 HP Rotom-W and 4 HP Tyranitar with Solar Beam and the aforementioned 252 HP Mega Kangaskhan with Overheat. However, if you don't plan on trying to OHKO any of these Pokemon, it may be worth using a Timid nature to outspeed neutral-nature base 100 Speed Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Salamence and Mega Kangaskhan, which could save Charizard from powerful physical attacks or even a Rock-type move. The EV spread is rather simple, with 12 Special Defense EVs used to ensure Charizard isn't OHKOed by 252 Special Attack Rotom-A's Thunderbolt at full HP. Bulkier EV spreads are also viable, such as 220 HP / 108 Def / 12 SpA / 4 SpD / 164 Spe, which aims to outspeed Smeargle and survive Garchomp's Rock Slide, although the drop in power can sometimes be noticeable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Charizard maintains its Speed tier, it can afford to be conservative with Mega Evolving. For example, Drought's sunlight only lasts for 5 turns, so it's unwise to Mega Evolve on a turn when Charizard should Protect, unless a partner Chlorophyll user needs the sun to gain the Speed advantage. Additionally, Mega Evolving on the first turn can allow Tyranitar to come in and weaken Charizard, so it may be worth holding off on Mega Evolving if you see an opposing weather changer in Team Preview. Counting the turns of sunlight is also important because of Charizard's dependence on its weather, and is imperative if you plan on switching out relatively early after Mega Evolving to avoid a potential faster Rock Slide or to reinstate sunlight later in the game. Be sure to count the turns of sunlight and make sure you're not wasting them.</p> <p>It may be tempting to use Overheat, but unlike Draco Meteor, which has outstanding neutral coverage, Overheat is more easily punished by Rock- or Water-types. Be cautious of clicking Overheat if your opponent has a bulky Pokemon that resists Fire-type moves. If this seems a little too complicated, you can use Fire Blast or Flamethrower, but they may not OHKO certain threats that are important to your team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Charizard and Venusaur make an incredibly effective sun core. With the Speed boost Chlorophyll provides, Venusaur can put dangerous Pokemon such as Garchomp and Kangaskhan to sleep before they can move and deal chunk damage, allowing Charizard to finish them off with Heat Wave. It also deals with Politoed and Tyranitar nicely, although Tyranitar may carry Ice Beam or Fire Blast, and can help you keep the upper hand in those matchups.</p> <p>Garchomp and Mamoswine can form a solid core with Charizard that spams Heat Wave and Earthquake instead of Discharge and Earthquake. Garchomp is the better pick to use Rock Slide on other Charizard and reliably finish off Kangaskhan, while Mamoswine can pick off Garchomp without risking a Speed tie or trading Dragon Claws. Both do a great job at forming a fast, hard-hitting lead with Charizard, so choose the one that better caters to your team.</p> <p>Aerodactyl, Mienshao, and Scrafty can either stop Rock Slides or weaken them to the point where non-STAB Rock Slide will fail to OHKO Charizard. Aerodactyl and Mienshao both have Wide Guard and can also smack common Rock Slide users such as Garchomp and Tyranitar for super effective damage with Ice Fang and High Jump Kick, respectively. Scrafty can both Fake Out and Intimidate Rock Slide users, as well as do reasonable damage with Ice Punch and Drain Punch, although it will rarely OHKO its target without a boosting item or prior Fake Out damage.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Claw and Flare Blitz receive a boost from Tough Claws after Mega Evolving and are Charizard's main STAB moves. Dragon Dance is a given on a Dragon Dance set, allowing Charizard to outspeed and OHKO Pokemon such as Garchomp and Mega Manectric, which would normally give Mega Charizard Y trouble. Protect rounds out the set, allowing Charizard to avoid dangerous Dragon-type moves upon Mega Evolving or Rock-type moves before doing so.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Defensively, the EVs listed allow Charizard to survive a Choice Band-boosted Talonflame's Brave Bird as Mega Charizard X and an unboosted Hydreigon's Draco Meteor as regular Charizard.</p> <p>Offensively, after a boost, Charizard outspeeds common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-A and Mamoswine as well as naturally fast Pokemon such as Mega Manectric and Garchomp, while packing enough punch to OHKO the format's bulkier Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Manectric even after an Intimidate. Before a boost, Charizard has enough Speed to outspeed Timid Tyranitar and Smeargle and enough power to OHKO opposing Dragons with Dragon Claw.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is used for more power because Speed isn't much of an issue when using Dragon Dance. The only notable Pokemon Jolly Charizard would outspeed after a boost is Modest Choice Scarf Salamence, which is next to impossible to reliably scout. The fact that you would at best Speed tie with Timid Salamence and other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as other Charizard and Mega Kangaskhan before a boost also makes the extra Speed useless.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Charizard X stands out from other boosting Pokemon such as Swords Dance Garchomp and Dragon Dance Gyarados/Mega Gyarados because of its immunity to Will-O-Wisp. It also has a leg up from being able to masquerade as a special attacker due to Mega Charizard Y's popularity. It might be a good idea to let the opponent guess at Charizard's forme by not Mega Evolving when using Protect and only revealing its true colors when on the offensive.</p> <p>Because Charizard changes its typing, it might be a good idea to remain unevolved when setting up to better tank Dazzling Gleam or Dragon-type moves should your opponent figure out what Mega Evolution you're using, which tends to happen in best of three sets. Again, Charizard can survive different attacks with the given EV spread depending on whether or not it Mega Evolves, so make sure you've assessed the situation before clicking the Mega Evolve button.</p> <p>Despite the temptation to always boost before attacking, it really isn't necessary to do so in many common situations. Garchomp as well as some Salamence will most likely try to use Rock Slide if it doesn't have any reason to think Charizard isn't Mega Charizard Y, so Mega Charizard X's Dragon Claw will often pick up an OHKO provided Rock Slide doesn't score a flinch. Flare Blitz will OHKO Amoonguss and Aegislash, provided the latter doesn't use King's Shield, and so on. The real goal to keep in mind when using Dragon Dance is to outspeed faster, more frail Pokemon such as Mega Manectric and Aerodactyl, and OHKO bulkier Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Venusaur. If Charizard can achieve the necessary KOs without boosting, don't bother trying to boost. Don't get greedy with Dragon Dance. Know when you have enough Speed and Attack to deal with your enemies.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mienshao, Scrafty, and Aerodactyl make good teammates for Charizard focusing on creating free turns for Charizard to boost. Mienshao and Scrafty both have access to Fake Out and can scare Tyranitar into using Protect; they also have access to Taunt or Feint to prevent Protects and disruptive moves such as Trick Room and King's Shield so Charizard can freely attack. Aerodactyl offers a fast Sky Drop that can act like a Fake Out, but you have to be careful about trying to pick up Pokemon that are over Sky Drop's weight limit of 200 kg, such as Tyranitar. It might be worth checking with your PokÃ©dex before trying to do any heavy lifting.</p> <p>While Amoonguss doesn't help Mega Charizard X that try to mask themselves as Mega Charizard Y, it's a rather consistent option to consider if you don't care about trying to play pretend. Rage Powder redirects dangerous Dragon Claws and Draco Meteors, and Spore can create free turns. Rotom-W, Gyarados, and Ludicolo are some more Pokemon that do a good job at taking care of various Ground-types such as Mamoswine, forming a decent offensive core, and supporting Charizard. Ludicolo provides Fake Out pressure, while Gyarados and Rotom-W can weaken physical attacks with Intimidate or Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

  "Raichu": {
    "overview": "<p>Raichu is probably one of the best Fake Out users in the game. Raichu was one of those lucky ones that got a boost to one of their stats in XY, and for Raichu, it was given to Speed. Its new base 110 Speed allows it to outspeed most of the common Pokemon in the base 100 Speed tier and provides it with one of the fastest unboosted Fake Outs in VGC, though still slower than Pokemon like Weavile. Raichu also has access to Encore, which can lock your opponent into an unfavorable move, as well as other support moves like Nuzzle and Charm. Lightning Rod makes your team immune to single-target Electric-type moves, such as Thunderbolt and, most importantly, Thunder Wave. With Encore, Raichu can also lock its opponent into boosting its Special Attack via Lightning Rod. Furthermore, it has access to some decent attacking options, such as Hidden Power Ice, Thunderbolt, and Volt Switch, coming off its decent base 90 Special Attack.</p> <p>However, it misses vital KOs, particularly on Garchomp with Hidden Power Ice, and it is pretty frail, so it is probably going to go down to one or two strong hits. It also really relies on its Speed to support allies, so if it drops due to Trick Room, Tailwind, Icy Wind, or something similar, it can't function as well. It also faces stiff competition from Pachirisu, which has access to Follow Me to redirect most hits and has better overall bulk, and Manectric, which can actually do something with the redirected Electric-type moves and, with its higher Special Attack stat, actually has a chance to KO Garchomp. Also, Liepard can steal its thunder with access to priority Encore, limiting the list of Pokemon that can outspeed it to just Talonflame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nuzzle can be used on a more supportive set to spread paralysis; however, Pokemon such as Pachirisu are better at this. Thunder Wave is an alternative to this, as Nuzzle can break Raichu's own Focus Sash when hitting Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Rocky Helmet users. Fling can be used in tandem with King's Rock to get an extra flinch; Raichu's base 110 Speed allows it to hit most Pokemon before they attack, making it act like a second Fake Out. However, you then sacrifice your Focus Sash for the extra flinch. Feint is a nice support move that lets Raichu break Protect so an ally can hit and KO an opponent. It can also finish off an opponent with low HP and even make it so that an opposing Pokemon that Protects itself from its ally's spread move is still hit; an example is Garchomp using Earthquake alongside a Tyranitar. Charm lets Raichu soften physical hits and can let Raichu's allies set up and cause havoc. Tickle is like Charm, but it lowers the opponent's Defense too, allowing your physical attackers to do more damage. Safety Goggles can let Raichu hit around Rage Powder with Thunderbolt and Encore. This is useful for attacking Pokemon such as Azumarill, which often hide behind Amoonguss.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Speed</strong>: Pokemon that can naturally outspeed Raichu are probably the best at countering it, Aerodactyl being the best in this regard. It can use Protect against Fake Out, and proceed to use Rock Slide without having to worry about Encore. Even some Aerodactyl run Taunt, so they can shut Raichu down.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are large threats to Raichu, and without Hidden Power Ice, Raichu is helpless. Garchomp and Mamoswine are the best Ground-types used to tackle Raichu because of their high stats. Marowak gets an honorable mention due to its ability to redirect Raichu's Electric-type moves with its own Lightning Rod and use Bonemerang to KO Raichu even through its Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Electric-type moves</strong>: Pokemon with an Electric-type immunity completely defeat Raichu. Volt Absorb and Lightning Rod users, such as Manectric and Pachirisu, can break Raichu's momentum and cause havoc, and in Pachirisu's case, even redirect Encore. Even if Manectric Mega Evolves, it will still beat Raichu one-on-one, despite being unable to freely use its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is a key threat, as it shuts down Raichu's main support moves, making it so Raichu loses its momentum and either needs to switch or attack. Be wary of Volt Switch, however, which allows Raichu to quickly and seamlessly escape without losing momentum.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The main niche with Raichu is that its blinding base 110 Speed lets it use Fake Out before most other common Fake Out users. With its fast Fake Out, it can force the opponent into a hard decision, because a Fake Out lets Raichu's ally use an attack that could threaten your opponent. Thunderbolt is a strong STAB move that makes use of those Lightning Rod boosts, while Volt Switch gives a bit of flow to your team, allowing you to shuffle around and switch your Pokemon with ease, all while keeping your momentum. If Raichu is on a weather-based team, Volt Switch should be your main choice, as your weather could be cancelled while your setter and Raichu are out: in this case, just switch your setter out and Volt Switch it back in again to bring your weather back. This can catch opponents off-guard: for example, bringing back rain while a Mega Charizard Y is on the field severely reduces its power. The final move is a toss-up. Protect stalls out a weather or Perish Song turn or lets your ally clear out a threat. Hidden Power Ice gives Raichu the amazing BoltBeam coverage, letting it 2HKO Garchomp and hit other Ground-types hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread is simple. 28 HP EVs and 4 Def EVs allow Raichu to survive Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch, while maximum Speed investment is used to fire off Raichu's attacks as quickly as possible. The remaining EVs are put in Special Attack in order to maximize damage output, as Raichu will most likely run a Focus Sash and isn't really bothered by most strong attacks. The Focus Sash can let Raichu survive moves such as Garchomp's Earthquake, allowing it to KO the opponent next turn. Lightning Rod is the best ability by far, letting Raichu redirect all Electric-type moves and gain a Special Attack boost. When coupled with a fast Encore, this can make Raichu difficult for enemy Rotom-A and Zapdos to deal with. On a side note, if you use Hidden Power Ice, use the 31/0/30/31/31/31 IV spread, as this lets Raichu keep its Speed at the highest level.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>A very aggressive playstyle best fits Raichu's role. You have to keep up the pressure on your opponent; if an opening is available, take it. Otherwise, it can lose games for you. For example: if your opponent threatens to use an Electric-type move, switch Raichu in safely; if a Garchomp uses Substitute, Encore it. With high pressure tactics, you keep your opponent on their feet, and you can control the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Perish Trap Mega Gengar is a brilliant partner when Raichu carries Volt Switch. If Gengar uses Perish Song and proceeds to switch out, Raichu can use Volt Switch to bring Gengar back in. You can also run Raichu with a Disable user. This, in conjunction with Raichu's Encore, causes your opponent to Struggle and lose 25% of its HP per turn if they hit. Again, Mega Gengar is a suitable user of this move due to its Speed and ability Shadow Tag. Even if Raichu just Encores an opponent into using Electric-type moves, Mega Gengar traps it, forcing it to continue boosting Raichu's Special Attack stat. It can be one of the most destructive combinations out there. In addition, rain teams love Raichu around, because you can lead with it and another ally and proceed to Volt Switch into Politoed to set up rain. In addition, Electric-type moves can be redirected to Raichu, meaning that Water-types such as Azumarill won't have to fear those.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Kangaskhan is an incredibly straightforward and predictable Pokemon. However, its raw bulk, Speed, and power more than make up for this. Sporting a 125 base Attack that is further boosted by Parental Bond, it can fire off awe-inspiring STAB Returns that threaten to tear through even the bulkiest of opponents. It can also contribute to the team thanks to its access to the coveted Fake Out, which gives Kangaskhan utility in any stage of the match and has the added bonus of being able to hit Ghost-types if Kangaskhan stays in its regular form for one turn. Its bulk is easy to underestimate as well; with 105 / 100 / 100 base defenses, it can afford to invest fully into its offenses and still be able to tank most neutral hits, which is what Kangaskhan is going to be taking most of the time thanks to its sole weakness to the rather rare Fighting-type, which is more manageable than ever with many teams opting to include Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp users in their lineups.</p> <p>However, as previously mentioned, Kangaskhan can be quite easy to play around, as it often packs only one set of moves. The sad thing about this is that Kangaskhan really can't afford to deviate from its standard set without losing key factors that make it such a good Pokemon. This allows opponents to easily play around Kangaskhan with Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp or simply double target it in the very likely scenario that it doesn't have Protect in its moveset. To accentuate this problem further, Kangaskhan's spread moves such as Rock Slide don't hit twice with Parental Bond, effectively forcing it to stick with single-target moves and making it easy to Protect against. Don't let this deter you from using Kangaskhan, however; its combination of raw stats and just the right moves will always be something to look out for. Just be careful with it and don't count on catching anyone off-guard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hammer Arm can be used in place of Power-Up Punch if it would be more useful for Kangaskhan to OHKO other Kangaskhan and Tyranitar right off the bat rather than trying to boost and then KO them with Return, though outside of those two, it doesn't do much else besides lower your Speed two stages (which can actually be useful when used alongside Trick Room). Fire Blast is another situational move that can hit Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Mawile, and is actually rather powerful despite working off a base 60 Special Attack considering it receives the Parental Bond boost and isn't affected by Intimidate or burns. Crunch can be used over Sucker Punch because isn't stopped cold by non-attacking moves, allowing Mega Kangaskhan to comfortably target Ghost-types. However, both Crunch and Fire Blast suffer the same problem as Hammer Arm does; they cannot hit many other Pokemon for as much damage as the standard options do.</p> <p>Moves that can be used over Return are Stomp, Dizzy Punch, and Facade. Stomp and Dizzy Punch should mainly be considered for their secondary effects, flinching and confusing, but are barely ever used because of their inherent inconsistencies. It's worth mentioning Bite if only because you can use Return and Bite in the same manner that you would use Return and Crunch. Facade suffers from inconsistencies of its own; although burning Kangaskhan is a popular method of dealing with Kangaskhan and Facade ignores its effects and still hits for 140 Base Power, relying on your opponent to burn Kangaskhan is unreliable to say the least unless you plan on burning or poisoning your own Kangaskhan, which is unadvisable for obvious reasons.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: The most common and easy way to deal with Kangaskhan is the same as any other physical attacker: have an Intimidate user. Scrafty gets a special mention as an Intimidate user because of its Fighting-typing and ability to heal off damage with Drain Punch or OHKO Kangaskhan with the rare High Jump Kick. Other Intimidate users include Salamence, Gyarados, Mega Manectric, and Krookodile. Mega Manectric and Gyarados make a great defensive core that is more than capable of using Volt Switch to rack up Intimidate drops and steadily deal damage to Kangaskhan, often forcing Kangaskhan to switch out and let its teammates take free damage or stay in and attempt to recover lost ground with Power-Up Punch.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Will-O-Wisp is most commonly used by Rotom-W and Rotom-H, but Gourgeist and Trevenant can easily switch in on Kangaskhan and burn it while avoiding Sucker Punch by using other moves such as Leech Seed or Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types in general handle Kangaskhan well; Aeigislash can't burn Kangaskhan, but can easily set up a Substitute in front of it and comfortably tank Sucker Punches while it whittles away at Kangaskhan with Flash Cannon or Sacred Sword. Mega Gengar has a field day with Kangaskhan as it easily Perish traps, burns, or attacks Mega Kangaskhan as long as it's careful not to get hit with Sucker Punch, which will often KO it without Intimidate support. As previously mentioned, Trevenant and Gourgeist can easily wait out Kangaskhan but don't have much in the way of dealing quick damage to it, making them more suited to an endgame win condition rather than a straight-up Kangaskhan check.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon capitalize on Kangaskhan's only weakness with their powerful STAB moves. Lucario and Mienshao both have Inner Focus, allowing them to more comfortably OHKO Kangaskhan with Close Combat or High Jump Kick/Low Kick, though regular Lucario only Speed ties at best with regular Kangaskhan and Mienshao is woefully frail and can be OHKOed through Focus Sash with the second Return provided by Parental Bond. Mega Lucario can more reliably OHKO Mega Kangaskhan with Close Combat, as a Jolly Mega Lucario has to be burned or Intimidated twice in order to miss out on an OHKO on 4 HP Kangaskhan, and even then it has the option of using a specially oriented set with Aura Sphere. Iron Fist Conkeldurr is another Fighting-type that can comfortably OHKO Mega Kangaskhan with a Fighting-type move of choice or a Life Orb-, Helping Hand-boosted Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types are the most reliable Pokemon to tank multiple Returns. Scizor and Mega Scizor can take the opportunity to set up Swords Dance and 2HKO Mega Kangaskhan, though unfortunately neither can outpace it and Bullet Punch before being hit by Sucker Punch. While Mawile can't directly switch in to Mega Kangaskhan, if it's smart, it can come in, Intimidate it, and hit hard with a post-Mega Evolution Play Rough or Iron Head and take a pittance from subsequent attacks. Ferrothorn discourages Kangaskhan from hitting it altogether with Iron Barbs, which deals double the damage to Mega Kangaskhan because of Parental Bond, and can either deal heavy damage with Gyro Ball or sap its health with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: While it might seem silly, Rocky Helmet is an option to stack with Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs Garchomp's Rough Skin, as Kangaskhan will be stripped of a little over half of its health every time it attacks and opens up some interesting scenarios where Ferrothorn or Garchomp will switch in and instantly KO a weakened Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Double Targeting</strong>: Finally, if all else fails, you can simply opt to double-target Kangaskhan. Powerful beatsticks of the VGC14 metagame that can accomplish this (besides the Pokemon previously mentioned) are Mega Charizard-Y with Overheat, Hydreigon with Draco Meteor, or even Zapdos with Thunder. Be wary of doing so however; as you know by now, while Kangaskhan doesn't usually carry Protect, that doesn't mean that it won't.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard Mega": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Even if it's resisted, Return is your go-to move for dealing damage, capping out at 102 Base Power and working off Mega Kangaskhan's base Attack of 125, further boosted by Parental Bond. Fake Out gives Kangaskhan great utility and can help you set up or KO with your partner, as well as dealing heavy chip damage to help Return nab KOs. However, if you already have Fake Out support or feel Mega Kangaskhan should be more concerned with itself than with its teammates, Protect can be used in Fake Out's place to give Kangaskhan more longevity and, more importantly, make Kangaskhan less prone to double-targeting. Sucker Punch is mainly for priority, but is occasionally good for hitting Ghost-types when they decide to attack. Power-Up Punch makes Kangaskhan a deadly force to be reckoned with, allowing Return to 2HKO Pokemon that resist it, such as Mega Mawile. It also helps Kangaskhan recover from a burn it might have suffered or multiple Intimidate Attack drops, as well as dealing chip damage for it and its partners.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Scrappy is generally the more useful ability for regular Kangaskhan, allowing it to Fake Out Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Aeigislash or even Power-Up Punch them for a boost. However, Inner Focus can be useful to help a partner set up Tailwind or other such moves in the event that you need to get off a Fake Out (for instance, Talonflame might have to set up Tailwind against Tyranitar while Kangaskhan gets Faked Out by a faster user).</p> <p>Either Jolly or Adamant natures will work for Kangaskhan. As Mega Kangaskhan sits at base 100 Speed along with other threats such as Charizard and Salamence, it's usually best to go with a Jolly nature to get the jump on Modest Charizard and Salamence and at worst Speed tie with Timid ones. If you value consistent power over Speed ties, Adamant is the superior option.</p> <p>A bulkier EV spread is worth considering, but is usually unneeded. Thanks to Kangaskhan's natural bulk, a mere 4 HP EVs will allow Kangaskhan to survive the vast majority of common moves such as Salamence's Draco Meteor and Rotom-H's Overheat at full health. Another reason to consider a bulkier EV spread, however, is to underspeed other base 100 Speed Pokemon for use alongside Trick Room, or to make Kangaskhan more resilient when used alongside Tailwind.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If it isn't obvious by now, unless you're making use of Scrappy or Inner Focus, you should make a point to Mega Evolve as soon as possible. From there, use Return often and keep Kangaskhan from being burned by switching out, which also resets Fake Out, allowing you to apply pressure later in the match.</p> <p>You should be careful not to get greedy with Power-Up Punch boosts, especially when Kangaskhan isn't actively being supported with teammates threatening KOs or more simple support options such as Follow Me/Rage Powder. One use of Power-Up Punch at +0 will more than likely be all you need to power through opponents with Return and Sucker Punch, aside from Pokemon that resist Return, which are usually 2HKOed. Using Power-Up Punch often is not a bad idea when Kangaskhan is burned or has been Intimidated, however.</p> <p>When using Protect, try to bluff having Fake Out by using Return on the first turn and switching out soon after to seem like you're trying to reset Fake Out. Since most Kangaskhan don't Protect and are usually double-targeted because of this, Protect is best used as a surprise move late-game. Additionally, make a point to put yourself into a position where you can KO or incapacitate at least one Pokemon with your partner when Protecting for the best results.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The best ways to support Kangaskhan are to give it Pokemon that can easily switch with Kangaskhan and redirect and/or prevent Kangaskhan from being double-targeted. Amoonguss does all of the above, as it doesn't particularly mind being burned, can use Rage Powder and Spore, and does a good job of taking Fighting-type attacks. In the same sense, Salamence makes a good switch-in, softening later attacks with Intimidate and doing a good job of eliminating Steel-types with Fire Blast.</p> <p>Chandelure, Talonflame, and Rotom-H can OHKO Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Mawile and often do a good job of checking Ghost-types as the more popular ones have a secondary type that's weak to Fire. Talonflame gets a specific mention for its ability to use Tailwind, allowing Kangaskhan to outspeed problematic Pokemon such as Kingdra in the rain and Mega Manectric, as well as its ability to straight-up OHKO Fighting-types with Brave Bird. Other offensive Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Tyranitar, and the previously mentioned Salamence appreciate Kangaskhan's Fake Out and form a hyper-offensive lead and/or core to immediately apply pressure on the opponent and punish slower teams.</p> <p>Other Pokemon that take on pure supportive roles that work well with Kangaskhan include Klefki, Meowstic-M, and Smeargle. Klefki and Meowstic-M can prevent burns altogether with Safeguard and follow it up with Swagger for free Attack boosts or use Reflect and Light Screen to make Mega Kangaskhan even more formidable. Smeargle is viable once again in VGC14 thanks to Dark Void being unbanned. Kangaskhan can Fake Out a Pokemon to allow Smeargle to fire it off, allowing Kangaskhan to comfortably use Power-Up Punch next turn. Something to watch out for when using Smeargle + Kangaskhan however are the Lum or Chesto Berries that are commonly used to check Dark Void. Another thing to keep in mind when using each of these pure supportive Pokemon is Taunt, which can completely shut down your setups.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Pinsir is a very underrated threat in the VGC 2014 metagame with impressive offensive stats. It also possesses a useful ability in Aerilate, allowing it to use Normal-type attacks to deal a significant amount of damage to common Grass- and Fighting-type threats. However, Mega Pinsir has many weaknesses, including a 4x weakness to Rock-type moves, and Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate from enemies can limit its effectiveness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Frustration can be utilized over Return when Pinsir is at 0 happiness. In the rare case that the opponent carries a Ditto that Transforms into Pinsir, Frustration will be useless for Ditto because it will most likely be at max happiness. If Pinsir gets burned, Facade is a pretty good option that can take the opponent by surprise with its doubled Base Power. Stone Edge enables Pinsir to OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame while providing some extra overall coverage in conjunction with Return. Thrash is another powerful STAB move with 120 Base Power that can be used in place of Return, but you're unable to choose the target. Giga Impact is a very powerful STAB move with 150 Base Power that can deal a significant amount of damage to the target with the boost from Aerilate. STAB X-Scissor is also a fairly viable option if you want to hit Psychic- and Dark-types super effectively. Rock Slide is a good spread move if you want to hit both targets, and it even has a 30% chance of flinching them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Priority Brave Bird from Talonflame and Aerilate Return from opposing Mega Pinsir can OHKO Pinsir.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Bulky Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Zapdos give Mega Pinsir a hard time, as they resist most of its attacks while being able to heavily damage it with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Mamoswine with priority Ice Shard can deal a huge amount of damage to Mega Pinsir before it even has a chance to attack. Other Pokemon carrying Ice Beam can usually 2HKO or OHKO Pinsir easily.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Mega Charizard X and Y can deal a huge amount of damage to Pinsir with STAB Fire-type attacks and potentially OHKO, and bulky Fire-types such as Rotom-H give Pinsir a huge fit with a Flying-type resistance and a super effective Fire-type move.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Mega Aerodactyl can outspeed and OHKO Mega Pinsir with Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Intimidate or Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Pokemon with Intimidate lower Mega Pinsir's Attack stat, while Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-A halve Pinsir's Attack stat.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Prankster</strong>: Pinsir hates being crippled by the occasional Thunder Wave from Klefki or Meowstic-M, as its Speed advantage is taken away.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is a strong STAB move that is great for inflicting a lot of damage to Grass-, Fighting-, and the occasional Bug-types. It even has the ability to OHKO a common VGC 2014 threat in 4 HP / 0 Def Mega Charizard Y. Adding to Pinsir's already stellar offensive power with Return, Close Combat is great for coverage against Rock-, Dark-, and Steel-types such as Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Bisharp. However, Earthquake is another viable option for its coverage against Fire-types and Aegislash if you like being able to hit both of the opposing Pokemon hard. Priority STAB Quick Attack is useful for finishing off weakened Pokemon, while Feint allows Pinsir to bypass Protect while also allowing your partner to hit that target; STAB Feint can also act like Quick Attack in most situations as a way to finish off a weakened foe. However, Swords Dance can also be used in the third slot to give Pinsir a scary +2 Attack boost for a potential sweep of the opponent's entire team. Protect is a staple move in any Doubles metagame to disrupt double targeting and scout the opponent, and it allows your partner to take out a specific threat to Mega Pinsir while it is being shielded.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>236 Speed EVs in tandem with a Jolly nature allow Pinsir to outspeed Jolly Garchomp and positive-nature base 100s. 52 HP EVs with 28 Defense EVs enable it to survive Jolly Garchomp's Rock Slide with one turn of Rough Skin damage or Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Return. Furthermore, 52 HP / 4 SpD Pinsir survives a Fire Blast from Timid Salamence, and the remaining EVs are put into Attack for maximum offensive power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Pinsir is useful for dealing a huge amount of damage early in the game, but it's helpful to save Pinsir for a late-game sweep, especially if there's a threat it can't take out, because it can be easily defeated by certain Pokemon. However, if there is a threat to Pinsir present and you decide to stay in, use Protect to scout the foes while enabling your partner to deal some damage or take out that threat. Utilize Feint to break through Protect, allowing your partner to inflict damage against the Pokemon that used it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Pinsir is a great partner for Rotom-W, as Pinsir can take out Grass-type threats to it such as Venusaur, while Rotom-W takes out Fire- and Flying-type threats to Pinsir such as Talonflame. Pinsir loves Safeguard users, such as Meowstic-M and Klefki, because they prevent Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, which cripple Pinsir's effectiveness. Pinsir likes Fake Out or Rage Powder support to enable it to set up Swords Dance and decimate the opponent. Rage Powder also redirects incoming super effective attacks to allow Pinsir to attack freely without worrying about taking a significant amount of damage. Finally, Wide Guard users such as Aegislash prevent Rock Slide and Heat Wave from hitting Pinsir.</p>"

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Gyarados boasts a great Attack stat, which allows it to plow through physical walls after setting up. It also has nice coverage options with moves such as Earthquake. Furthermore, Intimidate is useful against opposing physical attackers, as it lowers their Attack stat. However, Gyarados does have its downsides; it is 4x weak to Electric-type attacks, and is also hampered immensely by status such as paralysis and burn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bounce is an option on normal Gyarados for a STAB attack, but it is unnecessary, and therefore not worth it. Bite can be used on Mega Gyarados for STAB coverage, though it is also generally unnecessary. Aqua Tail and Stone Edge can be used with a Wide Lens for powerful, yet accurate, moves. The issue with this is that there is still a chance to miss, and the moves typically have very limited uses that are not already covered by the other moves. Lastly, Splash Plate can be used for a minor power boost to Gyarados's Water-type STAB attack, but Gyaradosite, Choice Band, and Leftovers provide more utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn can wall Gyarados with ease, taking abysmal damage from Earthquake and Ice Fang while whittling Gyarados down with Leech Seed. If Gyarados has Mega Evolved, Ferrothorn can more easily defeat it with a Grass-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-W</strong>: Rotom-W does not care what any non-Mega Gyarados does, and it OHKOes with Thunderbolt. It can also leave hefty dents in Mega Gyarados as well.</p> <p><strong>Amoonguss</strong>: While Amoonguss doesn't like Choice Band-boosted Ice Fangs or Taunt, it can deal with any other form of Gyarados that lacks those moves.</p> <p><strong>Attack Drops</strong>: Will-O-Wisp neuters Gyarados, rendering it essentially useless. Intimidate does the same thing on a lesser scale. Non-Dragon Dance Gyarados become pretty useless after having their Attack dropped.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall is Gyarados's main STAB move, and it has a nice chance to flinch opposing Pokemon. Earthquake provides spread damage and is really spiffy after Gyarados has Mega Evolved and gained Mold Breaker, as it allows Gyarados to OHKO Rotom-W. Taunt allows Gyarados a ton of little options. You can Taunt Aromatisse through Aroma Veil, for example. Dragon Dance boosts Gyarados's Attack and Speed and puts a lot of pressure on your opponent to beat Gyarados as soon as possible.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread gives Gyarados enough Speed to outrun minimum Speed Rotom-W and maximum Attack, with the rest put into HP. A Speed creep is highly recommended however as most Rotom-A Speed creep. Gyaradosite is the item of choice so Gyarados can Mega Evolve which allows it to take on Rotom-W. Wacan Berry allows Gyarados to take a Thunderbolt from Rotom-W better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure to Mega Evolve conservatively. Switch in and out liberally for as many Intimidate drops as possible before you Mega Evolve Gyarados. Never stay in on an Electric-type unless Gyarados's Wacan Berry is still intact, if you decide to run that.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gyarados pairs up well with Pokemon that appreciate the Fighting- and Water-type resistances and Earthquake immunity it brings, such as Tyranitar. Pokemon that resist or are immune to Electric and Rock, such as Garchomp, are especially good partners. Rotom-H can take Electric-type hits and KO Amoonguss with Overheat, and therefore it is a good teammate. Amoonguss shuts down Rotom-W for Gyarados and provides a cushion for Gyarados to set up Dragon Dance under. Talonflame beats up the Grass-types Gyarados might have trouble with and is still immune to Earthquake after Gyarados Mega Evolves.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall is Gyarados's most powerful STAB move. Thunder Wave allows Gyarados to cripple faster foes. Earthquake provides decent all-field coverage. Taunt allows Gyarados to deal with Pokemon that like to play around with status and setting up. Protect can be used in the last slot to scout opponents.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP and Defense EVs allow Gyarados to survive hard hits such as Mega Kangaskhan's Return as well as Garchomp's Rock Slide. 252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Gyarados's Attack, allowing it to leave lasting dents in opposing Pokemon. Alternatively, 68 Attack EVs can be run to boost Gyarados's Attack a moderate amount in exchange for more Speed EVs to allow Gyarados to Speed tie with neutral-natured maximum base 58 Speed Pokemon such as Scrafty and outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Mawile. Alternatively, full Speed investment can allow for faster utility moves against threats such as Smeargle. If you choose to run 252 Speed EVs, be certain to run Jolly as well. Sitrus Berry can give Gyarados immediate health recovery once its HP gets low enough, whereas Leftovers provides residual HP recovery throughout the course of the battle. However, Leftovers should not be run unless Gyarados is using Protect, as it otherwise cannot utilize the item fully. Intimidate allows Gyarados to passively support teammates lacking in Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be certain to keep Gyarados away from Electric-type attacks, as it can rarely take any Electric-type attack. Use Taunt against Pokemon such as Amoonguss to prevent them from either sleeping one of your Pokemon or using Rage Powder. If running Protect, use it to scout if you're unsure of what the opponent is going to do.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate the Intimidate support go nicely with Gyarados, such as Mega Alakazam and Gengar. Pokemon that can remove the threatening Rotom-W, such as Amoonguss, make for good partners as well. Lastly, Pokemon that can remove opposing Amoonguss, such as Talonflame or Rotom-H, are good teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall is a good STAB move with a chance to flinch foes. Ice Fang hits Salamence and Garchomp very hard. Stone Edge wrecks Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Rotom-H. Earthquake can be used for a spread attack, albeit a slightly underwhelming one, in the last slot. Return can be used in the fourth slot instead for a 100% accurate coverage attack for Pokemon Gyarados would hit for neutral damage anyway, such as Rotom-W.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs maximize Gyarados's damage output. This set runs enough Speed to outrun minimum Speed Rotom-W. The rest is invested in HP for a boost to Gyarados's bulk. Choice Band boosts Gyarados's Attack, and Intimidate lowers the foe's Attack stat whenever Gyarados switches in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't be afraid to switch often for more Intimidates, as it will cripple some Pokemon and Gyarados is bulky enough to take attacks. Make sure to stay away from Rotom-W and other Electric-types, as they can beat Gyarados with one of their 4x super effective STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that deal with Rotom-W and Amoonguss, such as Ferrothorn, generally are good teammates. Example of these Pokemon include Amoonguss itself, Talonflame, Rotom-H, and Mega Charizard Y.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl has always served a considerable role in all VGC formats thus far by being the fastest support Pokemon around. This has not changed in VGC 2014, as it continues to pull off its old Tailwind and Rock Slide shenanigans, though Aerodactyl has found new ways to support its team. Sky Drop is a tool that has been unbanned in VGC 2014 and is one of the best support moves around. Aerodactyl just happens to be one of the best users of the move. While it's not new, Wide Guard also received a buff to where it can be repeatedly used without fail which is fantastic, considering Aerodactyl itself is weak to Rock Slide. Its old moves have also become considerably more useful. Rock Slide now has two very dangerous targets that it can OHKO in Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, so fast flinching potential is not the only thing Rock Slide can be used for. Lastly, Aerodactyl received a Mega Evolution in VGC 2014 that has much more bulk, power, and Speed than its base forme. Aerodactyl's old problem of being weak to common Electric-types still remains, even though Electric-types in the 2014 format are considerably different from 2012. Aerodactyl has subpar defenses in general, meaning it is heavily reliant on a Focus Sash or Aerodactylite. Talonflame and Noivern have also come along to challenge Aerodactyl's niche as a Tailwind user, although all three of them have other roles that keep them separate from each other. Overall, Aerodactyl is still a fantastic source of fast support and should never be underestimated when faced.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge is Aerodactyl's strongest STAB Rock-type move but its poor accuracy and Rock Slide's flinch chance and spread effect make Stone Edge a rather poor option in comparison. Iron Head can be used on Mega Aerodactyl to KO Choice Scarf Gardevoir but Mega Aerodactyl does not have the moveslot for a coverage move like this. Smack Down is an interesting STAB option for any Aerodactyl that can be used on a team based around Earthquake, but Rock Slide is preferred on most team builds. Rock Tomb is a spread STAB move with a guaranteed Speed lowering effect and can be used for Speed control. It is weak when compared to Rock Slide, though, and Aerodactyl already has a much more reliable Speed control method with Tailwind. Fire Fang is a usable Fire-type move to hit Mawile and Aegislash. Be careful when using it against Ferrothorn because Aerodactyl will break its Focus Sash on Iron Barbs and could be KOed in the same turn if Ferrothorn uses Gyro Ball. Fire Blast is also an option because of this. With good Special Attack IVs and a Special Attack hindering nature, Fire Blast does slightly more damage than Fire Fang will depending on the Pokemon targeted. It will also save Aerodactyl's Focus Sash should it attack Ferrothorn, allowing it to live the possible incoming Gyro Ball after. Both Fire-type moves are very difficult to fit on a set since there is hardly any room for coverage moves like them on either Aerodactyl set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Mega Manectric can outrun Aerodactyl and either bring it down to its Focus Sash or KO it, should it have taken prior damage. Mega Aerodactyl can outspeed Mega Manectric and can use Sky Drop on it to stall a turn although it will get hit hard by Manectric on its way down. Mega Manectric also Intimidates Aerodactyl, making Rock Slide and Sky Drop less powerful. All formes of bulky Rotom-A can all take a hit from Aerodactyl and either bring it down to its Focus Sash to set up a KO, or cripple Mega Aerodactyl with Will-O-Wisp. However, Rotom-H and Rotom-S lose if they flinch from Rock Slide. Choice Scarf Rotom-A variants don't need to worry about Rock Slide's flinch chance from Aerodactyl as they can outspeed it and they will still bring it down to its Focus Sash or KO it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mawile not only Intimidates Aerodactyl but it can also KO it or bring it down to its Focus Sash after it Mega Evolves with Iron Head. It can also bypass Rock Slide's flinch chance with Sucker Punch. Mega Mawile can easily set up a Substitute or Swords Dance on any Aerodactyl lacking Taunt or the rare Fire-type attack. Aegislash can easily set up a Substitute in front of any Aerodactyl lacking Taunt and can KO it or bring it down to its Focus Sash with Flash Cannon. Aerodactyl's rare Fire-type attacks do next to nothing to an Aegislash in Shield Forme. Ferrothorn can KO Aerodactyl much like the other two.</p> <p><strong>Swift Swim Users</strong>: Every single user of Swift Swim can KO Aerodactyl with their STAB attacks while outrunning it under rain.</p> <p><strong>Mamoswine</strong>: Mamoswine ignores Aerodactyl's Focus Sash by KOing it with Icicle Spear. It can also bypass Rock Slide's flinch chance with Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Sableye</strong>: Sableye bypasses Rock Slide's flinch chance with its ability Prankster, giving +1 priority to all of its non-attacking moves. It can shut down Aerodactyl's ability to use Protect and Tailwind with priority Taunt and burn Aerodactyl with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Rhyperior</strong>: Rhyperior can KO Aerodactyl regardless of its Focus Sash with Rock Blast. It is immune to Sky Drop and its high Defense coupled with its resistance to Rock Slide means Aerodactyl can do little to it. It is also a common user of Wide Guard which can block Rock Slide entirely.</p> <p><strong>Gyarados</strong>: Gyarados can Thunder Wave both Aerodactyl and its partner, making Tailwind effectively useless and almost ensure Aerodactyl can never set it up again. It Intimidates Aerodactyl and also KOes or brings it down to its Focus Sash with Waterfall. Gyarados does have a weakness to Rock Slide though, so it will lose if it flinches too many times.</p>",

      "Speedy Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Slide and Sky Drop are probably Aerodactyl's two best options for a support set. Aerodactyl's extremely high Speed stat means that Rock Slide will usually go before your opponents two Pokemon, making full use of Rock Slide's nasty flinch chance. Rock Slide also allows Aerodactyl to check Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and other weakened Pokemon that have a weakness to it. Sky Drop is an extremely irritating STAB move that gives Aerodactyl's partner a free one on one match up for a turn. Tailwind is one of the best speed control moves in the game. Aerodactyl is a very reliable user of the move thanks to its already ridiculous Speed stat and its Focus Sash. The Speed increase Aerodactyl receives from Tailwind also makes Rock Slide flinch fishing more potent. Protect is to block the annoying Fake Out that is used often in VGC 2014 so that Aerodactyl's Focus Sash is not broken before it can even move. The ability to Protect Aerodactyl for a turn is also very useful in many situations. Wide Guard is a supportive move that keeps Aerodactyl and its teammate safe from spread moves like Rock Slide, Surf, Earthquake and Discharge. Taunt makes Pokemon like Smeargle and Amoonguss next to useless and stops Trick Room setters from ruining Aerodactyl's potential Tailwind. Ice Fang is a neat coverage move to punish Salamence and Garchomp leads while also bringing Noivern down to its Focus Sash. Note that Aerodactyl's Focus Sash will likely be broken if it hits a Garchomp with Ice Fang.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are very straightforward in that they allow Aerodactyl to Speed tie with other Aerodactyl and Mega Gengar while also outspeeding everything below base 130 Speed, besides Choice Scarf users. The Attack investment is to make sure Aerodactyl will be hitting as hard as possible without a positive nature. Unnerve is a useful supporting ability that stops the consumption of common berries such as Sitrus and Lum Berry. However, Unnerve always goes first when announcing itself, so if you would rather scout for a Choice Scarf on Salamence or Gardevoir, then Pressure is preferred. A bulkier spread of 252 HP / 44 Atk / 212 Spe can be used if you wish to use your Focus Sash elsewhere on your team, but the Focus Sash variant is generally preferred.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When against Fake Out users, the safest play on the first turn is to Protect Aerodactyl and its partner if either of them are carrying it. This ensures your Focus Sash will remain intact for the turn you use Tailwind, Sky Drop, or Rock Slide. Note that Aerodactyl is hardly ever dead weight due to its ability to flinch opponents with Rock Slide and the support Sky Drop provides. Knowing this, don't play Aerodactyl recklessly if you don't need to. Use Sky Drop to give Aerodactyl's partner a free turn with an opponent that cannot do too much to it. This is extremely useful for set up sweepers since it removes the threat of a double target for a turn. It should be noted that Aerodactyl cannot use Sky Drop on Pokemon weighing over 200 kg. Gyarados and Rhyperior are Pokemon that come to mind in this weight bracket, although Aerodactyl should not stay in on Rhyperior and use Rock Slide on Gyarados. Sky Drop can also end Aerodactyl since it cannot Protect itself when dropping the opponent, so use the move wisely. Tailwind should be used only when needed since it only lasts three turns after it is set up. With that said, Aerodactyl should be saved until it is needed to set up Tailwind as the move allows many slower attackers to easily get the upper hand on their otherwise faster checks. If Aerodactyl is up against Trick Room without Taunt, it is generally in your best interest to leave Aerodactyl behind for the match due to Aerodactyl's naturally high Speed and Trick Room making Tailwind a monstrous backfire if used. If you do have Taunt though, feel free to Taunt any Trick Room setter that isn't an Aromatisse, as long as there are no Fake Out users along side the Trick Room user.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any slow attacker is a good partner for Aerodactyl due to its ability to use Tailwind, put an opponent out of play for a turn, and occasionally allow its partner to live another turn with a Rock Slide flinch. Bisharp and Kangaskhan are two perfect examples of beneficiaries from Aerodactyl's support abilities. Bisharp not only benefits greatly from the Tailwind Aerodactyl provides, but Assurance also turns into a 120 Base Power STAB move when an opponent is hit by Aerodactyl's Rock Slide first. Mega Kangaskhan isn't exactly slow, but it still greatly benefits from Tailwind, while it also enjoys the turn to Power-Up Punch while not fearing a double target due to Sky Drop. Sky Drop can give Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Gyarados, Mega Gyarados, Dragon Dance Scrafty, and Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar a much needed opportunity to set up. If EVed correctly, these Pokemon can KO their respective checks after setting up the same turn as Aerodactyl drops said check. Beneficiaries from Wide Guard include Mega Charizard Y and Aegislash as both of them are commonly targeted by spread moves. Both of them greatly appreciate Tailwind support.</p>"

      "Mega Aerodactyl": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Aerodactyl is the fastest unboosted user of Rock Slide in VGC 2014, which means just about anything your opponent can have will risk getting flinched if Mega Aerodactyl uses Rock Slide. Because Rock Slide also receives a boost from STAB and Mega Aerodactyl's base 135 Attack stat, the damage output is not bad at all, even with minimal Attack investment. STAB Rock Slide also makes Mega Aerodactyl Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y's biggest threat as it resists Gale Wings Brave Bird from Talonflame, outpaces both of them, and OHKOes both of them with a single hit, not to mention their partner will likely flinch. Mega Aerodactyl's Speed and Tough Claws-boosted Sky Drop make it a terror to face when paired with a set up sweeper or a powerful Pokemon that needs an opponent put out of play for a turn. Also, it eases prediction when targeting the Pokemon that Mega Aerodactyl has picked up since it cannot Protect on the turn it falls. Similarly, Mega Aerodactyl cannot use Protect when using Sky Drop on the opponent either and, unlike its support set, does not have a Focus Sash to save it from a potential KO on its way down. So, use Sky Drop conservatively. Roost is used to increase Mega Aerodactyl's longevity so it can keep flinch fishing with Rock Slide or supporting its teammates with Sky Drop. Roost makes Mega Aerodactyl a much larger pain to face in general. Protect is to give Mega Aerodactyl's partner a turn to KO or cripple Mega Aerodactyl's check or counter as well as being usefun in many situations. Taunt can be used to help Mega Aerodactyl against Smeargle and Amoonguss, and make them useless. Tailwind is a fantastic speed control move that a good amount of teams are based around. Wide Guard can save many of Mega Aerodactyl's teammates from the multitude of spread moves that are used.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are rather specific in that they allow Mega Aerodactyl to sponge a Choice Specs Thunderbolt from Rotom-A formes while in Sandstorm. It is also able to survive a critical hit Stone Edge from a Salamence with a hindering Attack nature. The Speed investment is used to outrun Talonflame before Mega Evolving and to outrun base 80 Speed Pokemon with a Choice Scarf, namely Rotom-A and Gardevoir, after. Unnerve has elevated priority when announcing itself, so Pressure is used instead to scout for Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Salamence before Aerodactyl Mega Evolves. Unnerve is also useless since it will become Tough Claws after Aerodactyl Mega Evolves anyways.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Aerodactyl has potential staying power, so make use of this staying power by using Roost and Protect at the correct times. Make sure that Mega Aerodactyl is in a Sandstorm when it is out as the Special Defense boost from Sandstorm is extremely noticeable and can save Mega Aerodactyl a lot of the time. When using Sky Drop, be sure to have planned out how you are going to keep Mega Aerodactyl safe when it drops the opponent since it predictably cannot use Protect this turn. Similarly, use the turn that an opponent is dropped to your advantage since the opponent cannot use Protect that turn either, leaving them open to a potential KO. This can also save Mega Aerodactyl if the opponent in question had the ability to KO it. Burns take a good chunk out of Mega Aerodactyl's survivability, especially when using Sky Drop, while also weakening it its two attacking moves. Keeping burns away from Mega Aerodactyl is pretty important, especially in a format full of Will-O-Wisp users. When Mega Aerodactyl has done its job and is left with nothing to do, it can always fish for Rock Slide flinches.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sand Stream is always needed when using Mega Aerodactyl in order to ensure that it gets the most out of its bulk investment. This makes Hippowdon and Tyranitar very good partners despite the weaknesses they share with Mega Aerodactyl. However, Amoonguss and Ferrothorn can help cover these weaknesses while also dealing with Mega Aerodactyl's most common counter: Rotom-W. Pokemon that require set up and powerful attackers enjoy Mega Aerodactyl's consistent Sky Drop support and the occasional flinch from Rock Slide. Hydreigon, Aegislash, Gyarados, Scrafty, Bisharp and many more fall under this category.</p>"

  "Ampharos": {
    "overview": "<p>This generation, Ampharos received a huge buff in the form of a Mega Evolution. Outside of Mega Ampharos's fabulous appearance, it also boasts the third highest Special Attack stat in the format, excellent 90 / 105 / 110 base defenses, and a secondary Dragon typing that allows it to check common Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, Rotom-H, and Rotom-W. Mega Ampharos's low Speed also makes it a powerful threat on Trick Room.</p> <p>Mega Ampharos's new typing does have its flaws though, for it is weak to the common Earthquake, but also to the common Dragon- and Ice-type coverage moves. While on the surface Mold Breaker might seem like a good ability, Mega Ampharos lacks any way to properly use it. As you can only use one Mega Evolution in battle, Ampharos faces heavy competition in this regard; its complete lack of versatility does it no favors either.  Because of Mega Ampharos's low Speed, the second lowest of any fully evolved Dragon-type, it is very hard to use outside of Trick Room. Additionally, it lacks a powerful STAB Dragon move, having to make do with the relatively weak Dragon Pulse.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ampharos can run Power Gem or Hidden Power Ground to hit Fire-types, Power Gem, however, doesn't generally improve coverage, while Hidden Power Ground won't OHKO defensive Rotom-H. Volt Switch can be run to switch out while dealing damage, it is worth noting that it should never be run with Substitute. Thunder Wave can be run if you want a form of speed control. Rain Dance can be run if you want Mega Ampharos to set up rain to support the team, and Thunder could also be run on rain as a more powerful STAB move. Ion Deluge, Eerie Impulse, and Electric Terrain are all interesting support moves, however gimmicky or situational they may be.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Typing Advantage</strong>: Mega Ampharos is weak to common Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ground-type attacks. A STAB Earthquake will definitely 2HKO, if not OHKO, Mega Ampharos, whereas stronger single target moves like Play Rough from bulky Mega Mawile will OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Outside of Trick Room, Mega Ampharos is slow and susceptible to being KOed before it can attack, even if it may mean double targeting. Trick Room can be shut down with Taunt or your own Trick Room setter.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur can wall Mega Ampharos and use Synthesis to heal off any damage. Tyranitar can soft check Mega Ampharos, if it is lacking Focus Blast. It is unable to 2HKO Tyranitar in sand and will be 2HKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam after sand damage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Ampharos's STAB attacks have great coverage, with very few Pokemon resisting both. Thunderbolt hits Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame among others, and Dragon Pulse hits Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Salamence. Protect is a staple on many Pokemon in VGC as it can be used to scout what your opponent wants to use or block an attack to allow Ampharos's partner to take on the threat. Substitute blocks attacks and all status moves and on a forced switch or with correct prediction. Focus Blast can be used to hit Tyranitar and Mega Kangaskhan, but the miss chance and otherwise unnecessary coverage can make Substitute a better option. Substitute is harder to set up outside of Trick Room, so Focus Blast might be preferable to hit Pokemon that would otherwise give Ampharos problems, like Tyranitar and Assault Vest Scrafty.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Defense investment is such that Mega Ampharos can survive a Life Orb Dragon Claw from Garchomp, while the Special Defense EVs lets Mega Ampharos survive a Draco Meteor from a Timid-natured Salamence. The Special Attack EVS ensures an OHKO against Garchomp with Dragon Pulse and Mega Charizard Y with Thunderbolt. Static is almost entirely useless, as Ampharos will be Mega Evolving for the additional power and bulk; nevertheless, the chance of paralysis if Ampharos switches in on a contact move is appreciated, though highly situational. Absolute minimum Speed is run to make Ampharos as fast as possible inside Trick Room. If you don't want to run Ampharos in Trick Room, an alternative spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 52 SpA / 76 SpD / 124 Spe with a Modest nature is recommended. with this spread, Mega Ampharos will still OHKO the aforementioned Pokemon; Salamence, will only have an 18.8% chance to OHKO with Draco Meteor and will never OHKO with a Timid-natured Choice Specs Dragon Pulse. The Speed EVs ensure Mega Ampharos outspeeds neutral base 60s, Aegislash for instance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>For Ampharos to be as effective as possible in Trick Room, it should Mega Evolve before Trick Room is set up. This is because Speed only changes on the turn after Mega Evolving, and Mega Ampharos should be as slow as possible. Substitute should be set up at the first chance; this can be done against the common Rotom-H and Rotom-W, neither of which can break Mega Ampharos's Substitute or outspeed it under Trick Room. Amoonguss falls into this category as well. By having a Substitute up when Trick Room goes down, Mega Ampharos ensures its usefulness for at least another turn. It is an absolute requirement that faster Pokemon that threaten the alternative spread are KOed before Ampharos comes in. When not running Trick Room Mega Ampharos should only Mega Evolve when it wants to go for a move other than Protect, as this allows it to be as fast as possible; Mega Ampharos's lower Speed is only factored in the turn after it Mega Evolves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trick Room setters are almost a necessity. Gardevoir, Gourgeist-S, and Aromatisse all get a special mention. Aromatisse threatens opposing Dragon-types even outside of Trick Room, Gourgeist resists Earthquake and can spread burn, and Gardevoir can both threaten Dragon-types and spread burns. Amoonguss can use Rage Powder to redirect attacks and support Mega Ampharos in setting up Substitutes, while the latter deals with Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, which threaten Amoonguss. Rotom-H beats Steal-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Mawile that can cause problems for Mega Ampharos. Aegislash can take Dragon-type hits while supporting Mega Ampharos with Wide Guard, blocking Earthquakes.</p>"

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>The notorious frog has returned for another year of VGC, yet is far from the dominant amphibian it was last generation. The poor guy lost its permanent rain from Black and White, and as such its main niche has been vastly reduced in size. However, in VGC where the games are so short, Politoed is still a very viable Pokemon regardless, with or without Damp Rock. In addition, although Politoed is comparatively frail, it still takes a strong super effective hit to take the critter down in one go. Politoed also has access to some great support moves such as Encore and Perish Song, although it lost Icy Wind and Helping Hand in this year's format. Politoed is capable of running a few different sets such as Choice Scarf and support, but most importantly, all of them still have its precious Drizzle, which is a colossal help to possible partners such as Kingdra and Ludicolo. Finally, Politoed's rain obviously ends Mega Charizard Y's sun and Tyranitar'ssand, which can really mess up an opponent that relies on them. In summary, while Politoed has indeed been nerfed since VGC 2013, it is still a viable Pokemon with some neat roles, and its effectiveness should not be underestimated.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Politoed has a few other options with possible moves and items. Politoed can run a Wacan or Rindo Berry to protect it against super effective attacks and hopefully give it a longer lifespan, or catch a would-be check not expecting it to survive. Choice Specs is also an option to get some real power out of Politoed while not making it completely useless in the process. Politoed can run Hidden Power Grass to catch Rotom-W off-guard or Toxic to stall out some threats such as Mega Kangaskhan. Last but not least, an offensive set with Mystic Water is usable because it still adds power to Hydro Pump without locking Politoed into a specific move. Alternatively, Rest with a Chesto Berry is an option on the support set over Sitrus Berry and a support move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Charizard Y</strong>: A smart Mega Charizard Y user will wait to Mega Evolve until Politoed comes in. Then, Drought will immediately cancel out Drizzle.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur just puts everything to sleep and spams Giga Drain. Amoonguss is the same, but to a lesser extent because it does not have Thick Fat, so it is more susceptible to Ice Beam. In addition, it can just Sludge Bomb the Grass-types that cannot be put to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Politoed cannot scratch Pokemon like Toxicroak and Heliolisk. They just absorb its Water-type attacks and set up.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Rotom-W is the important one. It really does a number on most rain teams, and is usually the strongest check against them on teams without Mega Charizard Y or Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Attack Accuracy</strong>: Hydro Pump and Muddy Water have shaky accuracy, and can make it hard to make a deep run in tournaments.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Smart players using Tyranitar can put up sand and seriously hamper Swift Swim spam.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Choice Band Talonflame destroys Pokemon like Ludicolo and Kingdra who make great partners to the little frog, and it almost OHKOes Politoed itself.</p> <p><strong>Goodra</strong>: Although it is rare, it is pretty much designed to wall rain teams. It laughs at special hits, and with Kabutops illegal in this year's format, rain teams lack the physical power they had last year.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The move you will want to be using most on this set is Scald. Scald is preferred over Hydro Pump for its reliability and the chance to burn dangerous physical threats. Ice Beam is the only other offensive move on this set, since the combination of Water- and Ice-type coverage is only resisted by some other Water-types such as Rotom-W and Blastoise, so it is sufficient for Politoed's purposes. Protect is a staple on this set, but remember not to stall with it because that wastes a turn of rain. The positive side, of course, is to help Politoed scout against enemy attacks. Finally, Politoed can run many different support moves in the last spot. Rain Dance overall has the most utility, setting up rain again if either Charizard Y and Tyranitar decides to jump in, but Encore shuts down a Pokemon that just used Protect, and Perish Song works great to win against the opponent's last two Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The 29 Speed IVs and Sassy nature make Politoed just slower than 0 Speed Tyranitar, which means that Drizzle will persist if both are sent out at the same time, but it still faster than relevant threats such as Mega Mawile. The EVs are designed to allow Politoed to survive Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam in sun, before rain gets back up, and Energy Ball from Life Orb Venusaur. An alternative, less bulky spread with 244 Special Attack EVs can be used to OHKO Garchomp with Ice Beam. Sitrus Berry is the preferred item because it increases Politoed's survivability. However, Damp Rock is an option if Sitrus Berry is already being used by another Pokemon on a team or if you value the eight turns of rain instead of five.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Politoed is most effective as a lead. This Politoed is slower than Tyranitar, so rain will be the prevailing weather instead of sand if they're sent out at the same time. However, against sun teams, it is recommended to put Politoed in the back in order to cancel out Mega Charizard Y's Drought after the Mega Evolution. The best plan with Politoed is to lead with it, then to safely get in your offensive threats as soon as possible to make the most of the rain. Politoed has a limited offensive movepool, so do not expect to kill something like Salamence with Ice Beam because it is incredibly obvious that you will attempt to do so.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A well-known and effective strategy is to pair Politoed with Swift Swim users such as Ludicolo and Kingdra, in order to have the edge on your opponent in terms of Speed. Furthermore, pairing Politoed with any other Pokemon that benefits from rain, such as Thunder Mega Manectric, Zapdos, and its frog friend, Toxicroak, is also a great idea in order to utilize those Pokemon to their full effect. Ironically, Fire-types such as Moltres are also good partners because they help deal with Mega Charizard Y. Furthermore, Moltres in particular can spam Hurricane and remove Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur for Swift Swim users like Ludicolo so they in turn can spam their Water-type STAB moves. Surprisingly, Ground-types like Garchomp can prove to be good partners in order to remove Water-immune Pokemon such as Heliolisk and Toxicroak. Ferrothorn is another great partner for Politoed because Ferrothorn's Fire-type weakness is mitigated by rain. In addition, Ferrothorn can whack Rotom-W with Power Whip, which completely walls Politoed. Amoonguss is another Pokemon that walls Rotom-W, and can put an opposing Pokemon to sleep, as well as support Swift Swim Pokemon with Rage Powder. Mawile is a cool option because it destroys Tyranitar; however, it sometimes has problems dealing with sun teams. Surf is always an option if you pair Politoed with Pokemon like Gastrodon, Heliolisk, and Toxicroak that appreciate being hit by Water-type moves. Most importantly, remember not to make a team completely dependent on rain. Drizzle is cool, but it will be very hard to consistently beat other weather teams if you are relying on rain in order to do so.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is the advised STAB attacking option on the Choice Scarf set because it is Politoed's strongest attack. However, Scald is a more reliable option if you are afraid of missing. Ice Beam is the best option in the next slot, as it hits Flying-types, Dragon-types, and Grass-types, and has overall great coverage with a Water-type move. Focus Blast hits Tyranitar and Ferrothorn hard, the latter of which resists Hydro Pump. Finally, in the last spot, Psychic can be used to get a nice neutral hit on Rotom-W and it is super effective against Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Alternatively, Encore can be used to stop a Pokemon that just used Protect, or Rain Dance can always be used to set rain back up on a predicted Charizard Y or Tyranitar switch-in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are exactly what you would expect of a Choice Scarf Pokemon in VGC. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Politoed to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed in conjunction with Choice Scarf allows Politoed to outrun everything relevant besides Mega Manectric. There are not many alternative options for the first three move slots, but the 4th slot should be whatever has the most utility on a team.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try not to lead with Politoed against teams that have other weather unless you are prepared to lock yourself into Rain Dance on turn one, just in case they also lead with a weather user and so nullify Drizzle. Always prepare to lead up against Rotom-W because it is the best common rain check besides Ferrothorn. Choice Scarf is less expected than the standard set with Sitrus Berry, so use this to your advantage and try and get some sneaky KOs early in the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>It's always a good idea to pair Politoed up with Swift Swim Pokemon such as Kingdra or Ludicolo, no matter what spread Politoed is running. Lum Berry Ferrothorn is always a good option as well, not only because it can dent Rotom-W, but also because super effective Fire-type moves aimed at it are weakened in the rain. Goodra can switch in on Grass-type and Electric-type moves that are super effective against Politoed, and it also has access to Muddy Water. Pokemon with Thunder such as Mega Manectric and Zapdos are good options, because they can easily remove opposing Water-types. Finally, Moltres is a good option to beat Grass-types with super effective 100% accurate Hurricanes in the rain.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Scizor, the Bullet Punching battle bug, is back for another round. With eight resistances, one immunity, and only one weakness, it can take many hits and retaliate with great power. Scizor has a few more obstacles in its path, though. Scizor now faces competition from Bisharp and Mega Mawile, both of which have more freedom to utilize their priority Sucker Punch as Steel-types no longer resists Dark-type moves. Scizor has the downside of being completely crippled by burns, which have become a more common method of stopping physical sweepers. Furthermore, Intimidate is more common as well, and even though it can be avoided, it is another obstacle Scizor needs to play around. In addition to these setbacks, Scizor is missing some of its stronger moves due to the VGC' 14 rule set. On the bright side, Scizor made the cut and received a Mega Evolution; Mega Scizor has better bulk and an extra 20 points in its base Attack stat, which strengthens its signature Technician-boosted STAB Bullet Punch. Despite some setbacks and obstacles, Scizor is still a premier Pokemon that can tear through opposing Pokemon before they even get a chance to attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scizor has a few other options in addition to what is listed on the set. As the Item Clause can be a pain, Scizor has three other viable item choices. Iron Plate can be used to bluff another item and it increases the power of Bullet Punch. Life Orb provides a boost to all of Scizor's moves, but cannot be used to bluff another item due to the recoil damage it causes with each attack. Lastly, Scizor can hold an Occa Berry, but it will still be KOed by most Fire-type moves unless it is in rain. Feint can break through Protect and deal some damage thanks to the Technician boost, but Scizor is better off utilizing stronger moves. As Superpower is not available, Brick Break can be used as an alternative coverage option, but it lacks power. Thief becomes a 90 Base Power attack after the Technician boost but once again does not make use of Scizor's offensive potential. Quick Guard can deal with priority moves but is not really worth a moveslot, especially on an offensive Pokemon like Scizor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Burning Scizor is usually the best way to stop it, as it cannot recover from the setback. However, Lum Berry can alleviate the status condition once.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Intimidate reduces Scizor's offensive prowess, though differs from Will-O-Wisp in that Scizor can overcome the Attack drop with Swords Dance, which takes up a turn.</p> <p><strong>Gyarados</strong>: Gyarados has Intimidate and resists both of Scizor's STAB moves when not Mega-Evolved.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type attacks are the most reliable in taking Scizor down. Due to its crippling 4x weakness to Fire, Scizor is likely to be KOed by any Fire-type attack, even if it holds an Occa Berry. Fire-types in general are also great at countering Scizor. Talonflame, Charizard, and Talonflame resist both of Scizor's STAB moves and can OHKO it with their respective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Manectric</strong>: Mega Manectric has Intimidate to weaken Scizor's attacks, resists Bullet Punch, and can OHKO it with Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-W</strong>: Rotom-W takes little damage from Bullet Punch and can burn Scizor with Will-O-Wisp or deal damage with Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-H</strong>: Rotom-H does not fear either of Scizor's STAB moves and can burn or OHKO Scizor with a STAB Fire-type move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scizor has fewer options this time around, but it's still great at what it does. Bullet Punch is the go-to attack for Scizor, as it has 90 Base Power after the boosts from STAB and Technician, making it an even stronger priority move than Extreme Speed. Due to its power, even Pokemon that resist Steel-type moves will take a good chunk of damage from it. As Bug Bite, Scizor's Bug-type STAB move of choice, is unavailable this season, Scizor must be content with using X-Scissor. Thanks to its typing, Scizor usually has no issue setting up with Swords Dance, which increases the power of its attacking moves greatly. The boost from Swords Dance can also be used to overcome any drops incurred from opposing Pokemon with Intimidate. For the last slot, Scizor has two good choices: Protect and Roost. Protect, a general VGC move, can be used to keep Scizor out of harm's way while a teammate deals with a certain threat. On the other hand, Roost heals Scizor and prolongs its time on the battlefield.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Scizor has two item options for this set. Considering that the sets for Mega Scizor and standard Scizor are currently identical, you can run Scizorite for the boosts that it provides. If you already have a Mega Evolution on your team, you can opt to run a Lum Berry instead, which can protect Scizor if a burn comes its way. Regular Scizor has good stats, so Mega Evolving it is not a necessity. If you decide to just stick with regular Scizor, it must run Technician as its ability. There is no reason to use either of the other abilities: Swarm is pointless as Bullet Punch is the main attack whereas Light Metal does not help Scizor in any notable way.</p> <p>252 HP EVs increase Scizor's bulk, allowing it to better tank attacks, while 252 Attack EVs along with and Adamant nature allow Scizor to deal as much damage as possible with its attacking moves. Running Jolly does not allow Scizor to outspeed anything noticeable, and is not worth the decrease in power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scizor should be used either as a lead or a late-game cleaner. If it is partnered with a Pokemon that can take care of its checks and counters, Scizor can make for a good lead, as it can possibly set up and wreak havoc early on. On the other hand, after the Pokemon that can stop it have been sufficiently weakened or KOed, Scizor can be a great late-game cleaner with its incredibly strong Bullet Punch. Regarding Mega Evolution, there is no reason to wait unless you are attempting to bluff having another Mega Pokemon. Scizor gets some nice boosts from its Mega Evolution and so should be Mega Evolved as soon as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar and regular Tyranitar make great teammates for Scizor and Mega Scizor, respectively. The sandstorm Tyranitar summons does not harm Scizor, can help wear down opposing Pokemon, and can be used to win the weather war. Tyranitar can also take care of the Fire-types that threaten Scizor. Water-types pair well with Scizor as they have decent defensive synergy with it. Rotom-W and Scizor cover each other's weaknesses nicely; one can deal with what threatens the other. Politoed makes a good partner as the rain it brings halves the damage done to Scizor by Fire-type moves. Another great partner for Scizor is Chandelure, as it can take care of opposing Steel-types with its Fire-type STAB moves. Also, with Flash Fire, it can discourage the opponent from using Heat Wave, as the move will give Chandelure a free boost to its Fire-type moves. Salamence makes a good teammate for Scizor as well, as it can take care of Steel-type Pokemon with either Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Furthermore, it has Intimidate to help prolong Scizor's time on the field.</p>"

  "Smeargle": {
    "overview": "<p>Smeargle has been one of the most feared Pokemon to face since the ruleset was first announced, as it was allowed to use one of the best (and arguably overpowered) moves on the doubles scene: Dark Void. This 80% accurate move puts both foes to sleep when it is used, and it is a powerful asset for Smeargle. This is backed up by a literally endless support movepool courtesy of Sketch. Add onto this its decent, albeit middling, Speed, and you have one of the best supporters in the format. However, Smeargle's bulk is nonexistent, and it lacks any offensive presence, making it complete Taunt bait. Additionally, its Speed is still middling, meaning that it can be outpaced by every common Taunt user while being too fast to be good under Trick Room. Finally, it faces stiff competition from Amoonguss and Pachirisu as a user of redirection moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Smeargle has access to every released move in the game outside of Chatter, but it struggles to use the vast majority of them effectively. Transform can make it scary, allowing for the possibility of double-Mega Kangaskhan, among other threats, as well as allowing Smeargle to absorb Spores, Sleep Powders, and Stun Spores from Amoonguss and Venusaur or scout for movesets. However, it is unreliable and it removes Moody boosts, meaning that it isn't usually worth it unless Smeargle has crippling stat drops, in which case Smeargle either is better off switching out or has probably fainted already. Wide Guard is an option, although Smeargle is generally outclassed by Machamp, Mienshao, and Aegislash as a user of the move. Sunny Day and Rain Dance could work to preserve Smeargle's Focus Sash and support Pokemon like Venusaur and Ludicolo, but Smeargle struggles to fit either onto its moveset, and the concept requires such a high level of prediction that it usually isn't worth it. Safeguard is an option for teams that are susceptible to Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, as well as ones which struggle versus Amoonguss and opposing Smeargle, but Meowstic and Klefki outclass Smeargle in said role. Smeargle has a large range of Speed control options in Thunder Wave, Nuzzle, Glaciate, Icy Wind, Bulldoze, Rock Tomb, Electroweb, Tailwind, Sticky Web, and Trick Room, but there are better Pokemon for speed control strategies, such as Talonflame, Aromatisse, Reuniclus, and Pachirisu. Smeargle has a variety of other support options, such as Helping Hand to power up its partner's attacks, Feint and Shadow Force to negate Protect, Magic Coat to reflect status moves (most notably Taunt), Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers, and Snarl to weaken special attackers like Aegislash, but Smeargle usually has better things to do, making these options inferior.</p> <p>As for alternate sets, Smeargle could use a Choice Scarf set to take advantage of a super-speedy Dark Void, but this is usually counterproductive due to Smeargle sacrificing all of its supportive potential and losing the element of mindgames. Mental Herb is an option if you're particularly afraid of Taunt, but Smeargle is far too frail to forgo Focus Sash. Finally, you could run a FEARgle set, which is a level 1 Smeargle with Trick Room, Dark Void, Endeavor, and either Dragon Rage or Extreme Speed, to weaken non-Ghost-types beyond repair, but it requires huge amounts of support and is ruined by an untimely Dark Void miss, as well as dying if something wakes up quickly and being walled by Ghost-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is Smeargle's greatest enemy. It completely neuters Smeargle, forcing it to struggle or switch out. Therefore, users of the move like Aerodactyl and Gyarados counter Smeargle well.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority attacks stop Smeargle in its tracks, as they can take it down with ease after its Focus Sash has been broken; this makes Scizor, Talonflame, and Conkeldurr good stops to Smeargle. In addition, Fake Out is especially potent as it breaks Smeargle's Focus Sash and forces Smeargle to flinch. Therefore, Mega Kangaskhan and Mienshao counter Smeargle.</p> <p><strong>Moderately Powerful Attacks</strong>: Pretty much any moderately powerful attack can bring Smeargle down to its Focus Sash. Therefore, every viable attacking move in the metagame aside from those that deal static damage checks Smeargle.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Immunities</strong>: Insomnia and Sweet Veil prevent the effects of Dark Void or remove its effects completely when its user is active, respectively. Therefore, Pokemon such as Slurpuff, Gourgeist, and Banette are checks to Smeargle. Additionally, Lum Berry and Chesto Berry allow their holders to wake up immediately and retaliate with an attacking move.</p> <p><strong>Safeguard</strong>: Safeguard protects its entire team from the effects of Dark Void, making common users such as Klefki and Meowstic good stops to Smeargle.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute blocks Dark Void, meaning that Substitute Aegislash is a good stop to Smeargle, although it requires a fair amount of prediction due to its low Speed.</p> <p><strong>Sand Stream and Snow Warning</strong>: Sand Stream and Snow Warning activate damaging weather, breaking Smeargle's Focus Sash and allowing it to be OHKOed. Therefore, Tyranitar, Abomasnow, and their respective Mega Evolutions stop Smeargle in its tracks.</p> <p><strong>Multi-Hit Attacks</strong>: Any attack that hits more than once defeats Smeargle. Therefore, Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Heracross, and Icicle Spear Mamoswine counter Smeargle effectively.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Talk</strong>: Sleep Talk allows its user to attack through Dark Void. However, it is incredibly rare because its only notable user is Talonflame.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dark Void is hands down the best move in the format. The ability to put both targets to sleep with a move that is relatively accurate is great utility. This constant threat of putting both of your opponent's Pokemon to sleep is the closest thing Smeargle has to offensive presence, and it is a great tool for Smeargle to use. This in conjunction with Follow Me makes Smeargle really disruptive to the opposing team; with the ability to redirect attacks away from its partner, it can aid setup or give a free turn to attack. Follow Me is a rare move in the format due to its poor distribution, with the only other Pokemon with access to the move being Lucario, Furret, and Pachirisu. This gives Smeargle a niche in being the only attack redirector that can put its targets to sleep without being ignored by Grass-types and Safety Goggles Rotom-H.</p> <p>Your choice for what to use in the last two moveslots comes down to the needs of your team. Fake Out is useful to flinch, immobilizing the target Pokemon and giving Smeargle another way of providing a free turn for its partner, as well as breaking Focus Sashes. However, Encore is a great way to lock opposing Pokemon into setup moves, letting Smeargle check Pokemon like Substitute Aegislash, Swords Dance Scizor, and Dragon Dance variants of Gyarados and Tyranitar. Additionally, it can be used to lock slower Pokemon into Protect, forcing them to switch out and waste a valuable turn in the fast-paced metagame. Spiky Shield is literally a better Protect, blocking all moves, getting chip damage when Smeargle is contacted, and being nigh impossible to lock with Imprison because of its low distribution. However, King's Shield lets Smeargle check physical attackers that commonly use contact moves, such as Kangaskhan, Garchomp, and Talonflame, as well as physically oriented Fake Out users like Mienshao and the aforementioned Kangaskhan. This, however, comes at the cost of the ability to block status moves, most notably Taunt. Also, it is important to note that Bisharp isn't affected by the Attack drop due to Defiant.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is chosen to maximize Smeargle's Speed while minimizing the damage Smeargle takes from Foul Play. Affecting Fake Out's power isn't important due to its low power regardless. The rest of the EVs are allocated in such a way as to maximize Smeargle's overall bulk. Focus Sash is the item of choice due to Smeargle's nonexistent bulk making the use of any other item unfeasible. Moody is the ability of choice because it can very easily make Smeargle a monster to face in just a few turns. However, it is a double-edged sword, as Smeargle can get accuracy, evasion, and Speed drops. Own Tempo could be used if you don't like this unpredictability, but confusion-inducing moves are incredibly rare, and the chance to make Smeargle monstrous is almost always worth the tradeoff.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Spamming Dark Void is counterproductive because it fails when used on already sleeping Pokemon, and the threat that Smeargle could use it creates mindgames that are removed if it only uses said move. Follow Me needs to be used with the same level of care as Dark Void, as the combination of said moves is what makes Smeargle so disruptive. Smeargle's support options allow it to give its partners free turns to set up or a free turn, so make the most of all the options Smeargle has. Finally, don't be afraid to use Spiky Shield if you are unsure about what to do. It is a great way to scout and see what your opponent's strategy is, and protection is all the more valuable on a Pokemon as frail as Smeargle. Spiky Shield also adds to the mindgames that Smeargle can play.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Smeargle is a valuable asset to more offensively oriented teams. However, it also needs support to come in safely due to its immense frailty, making Pokemon that are solid switch-ins or switch-outs such as Amoonguss, Garchomp, and Talonflame solid teammates. Smeargle's middling Speed stat means that it benefits greatly from Tailwind support, making users such as Aerodactyl, Noivern, and the aforementioned Talonflame solid partners. Common users of setup moves, such as Tyranitar, Scizor, and the previously mentioned Aegislash, benefit from Follow Me, Fake Out, Dark Void, Encore, and King's Shield aiding their setup. Similarly, frail attackers like Mega Lucario and Mega Aerodactyl benefit from Smeargle's ability to redirect attacks away from them.</p> <p>As for support that Smeargle itself benefits from, users of Quick Guard, such as Mienshao and Talonflame, are great partners to prevent the use of moves like Fake Out, Sucker Punch, and Gale Wings Brave Bird; similarly, Wide Guard from Pokemon like Aegislash and Machamp makes the mindgames that Smeargle can already create even more potent, and allows it to be less reliant on Follow Me. Pokemon with access to Drought or Drizzle, i.e. Politoed and Mega Charizard Y, respectively, are great partners for their ability to clear hail and sandstorm. Aromatisse's Aroma Veil is a great way of preventing Smeargle from being on the wrong end of a Taunt. Finally, other users of Fake Out provide lots of opportunities for Smeargle to use Dark Void, making users such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mienshao, and Mega Blastoise great allies, with the latter also benefiting from the Follow Me support keeping Water Spout at maximum power. This opportunity creation concept also applies to Amoonguss as it can redirect attacks away from Smeargle to fire off a Dark Void, as well as helping to preserve Smeargle's Focus Sash.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>With good Attack, Special Attack, and bulk, Tyranitar has a lot going for it. What's more, its ability Sand Stream induces sand upon switching in, which boosts Tyranitar's Special Defense. Sand is seen as a neutral weather, as it neither boosts nor weakens any types offensively; there is also a lack of Pokemon able to take advantage of sand in VGC. Because of this, Tyranitar is often used to take on opposing weather setters, mainly Mega Charizard Y. Tyranitar has an extensive movepool, which, along with its stats, allows it to play multiple roles, including that of a special attacker and a Dragon Dance sweeper. While Tyranitar's Speed may seem lacking when compared to its other stats, it is enough for Tyranitar to effectively use a Choice Scarf. Tyranitar is also blessed with an incredibly powerful Mega Evolution. With a base 164 Attack stat, Mega Tyranitar hits incredibly hard, and with massive 100 / 150 / 120 bulk, it can be very difficult to take down.</p> <p>It is important to know that most Dragon Dance-lacking Tyranitar should be special attackers due to the many Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp users in the metagame. Tyranitar's Rock / Dark typing leaves it with seven weaknesses, four of which are common. While Tyranitar's movepool gives it a lot of options, to effectively use them, Tyranitar must compromise STAB moves for coverage moves or vice versa, leaving it unable to win certain match-ups it otherwise could. Without a Choice Scarf, Tyranitar is relatively slow, leaving it vulnerable to opposing attackers. Most importantly, Tyranitar is complete setup fodder for Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tyranitar has a significant number of other options. Assault Vest can boost Tyranitar's Special Defense to the point where it is capable of taking Mega Lucario's Aura Sphere in sand. The additional Special Defense also lets Tyranitar better check weather, especially rain. Assault Vest Tyranitar requires slightly more team support, however, as it is unable to run Protect. Because of Tyranitar's low base Speed stat, it can perform well in Trick Room; if you want to run Tyranitar on a Trick Room team, simply opt for max HP instead of Speed investment and a Quiet nature. Go for Protect on the turn that Trick Room is set up, ensuring that Tyranitar will be able to make use of Trick Room. Flamethrower is a weaker but more accurate version of Fire Blast; it should only be used for this consistency, as the loss in power is noticeable. Tyranitar can make use of Choice Specs, which allows it to hit significantly harder than it could with Life Orb and make better use of a more reliable move such as Flamethrower, but it loses the ability to switch moves. Ancient Power is a very weak special Rock-type move which should primarily be used on Choice Specs sets, as it is unaffected by Intimidate and burns, so Tyranitar will be able to consistently OHKO Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p>Both Choice Scarf and Choice Specs sets can make use of Sleep Talk to allow Tyranitar to act as a sleep absorber and continue being useful even if it is put to sleep. Tyranitar can make use of certain Berries, most notably Roseli, Chople, and Shuca Berries, which weaken Fairy-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves respectively. While these Berries mean that Tyranitar can't make use of other potentially more useful items, they ensure that Tyranitar will be able to use at least one attack. A slow, bulky special attacking set with an EV spread of 252 HP / 148 Def / 108 SpA and a Quiet nature and Leftovers is possible, using the same moves as the special attacking set. However, this set is somewhat inferior to the Assault Vest set in its ability to take hits, though if used correctly, it can have better longevity. Tyranitar has access to Taunt, which can be used to shut down Pokemon that are reliant on non-damaging moves, such as Aegislash. Taunt can be hard to fit into sets, however, as Tyranitar is fairly reliant on its coverage moves. Tyranitar has access to Thunder Wave and Rock Tomb, two forms of speed control. Thunder Wave quarters the foe's Speed and has a chance to paralyze the foe and potentially prevent it from moving. Rock Tomb is a single-target damaging Rock-type move that lowers the foe's Speed stat by one stage, but this drop is lost after switching out. Snarl is a Dark-type spread move which lowers the foes' Special Attack stat by one stage. Snarl should be used for its support value rather than as a primary attack, as it is far weaker than other Dark-type moves, so it should only be opted for on bulky sets, like the Assault Vest set, which can afford the drop in power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Politoed induces rain. Though Tyranitar is normally slower than Politoed, Rain Dance is a common move on Politoed and ensures that the rain is set up against Tyranitar. Kingdra, a Pokemon that is common on rain teams, is capable of OHKOing Tyranitar in the rain. Rotom-W is able to burn Tyranitar, crippling physically offensive variants, and Hydro Pump does decent damage to non-Mega Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types, Azumarill in particular, can check Tyranitar. Azumarill can take any hit from Tyranitar and either retaliate with a Play Rough or set up Belly Drum. Gardevoir is capable of 2HKOing Tyranitar in the sand with Moonblast and can also potentially burn physical sets. Mega Mawile fears Fire Blast from Tyranitar, but won't OHKO it unless Tyranitar is a Choice Specs variant, and Mawile can OHKO back with Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types, such as Mamoswine and Garchomp, threaten Tyranitar with their powerful STAB Earthquake. Garchomp, however, must be wary of Tyranitar that invest enough in bulk to survive an Earthquake, as Ice Beam will OHKO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur can take any hit from special Tyranitar, and between Leech Seed, Synthesis, and Giga Drain, Mega Venusaur is capable of healing off any damage. Similarly, Assault Vest Ludicolo deals with the special sets, being able to recover health with Giga Drain or hit Tyranitar hard with Hydro Pump. Both of these Pokemon don't fare so well against Dragon Dance Tyranitar, however. Ferrothorn beats Dragon Dance Tyranitar, as it can OHKO non-Mega variants with Power Whip and OHKO +1 Mega Tyranitar with Gyro Ball. Ferrothorn also deals with Choice Scarf Tyranitar not locked into Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage Moves</strong>: Most physical Fighting-type moves can easily OHKO Tyranitar. Mega Lucario resists Tyranitar's dual STAB combination and can OHKO Tyranitar with either Close Combat or Aura Sphere. Similarly, Scrafty resists Tyranitar's STAB moves and can OHKO Tyranitar with Drain Punch, simultaneously healing off any damage it has taken in the process. Fighting-type coverage moves, such as Power-Up Punch or Hammer Arm from Mega Kangaskhan and the rare Sacred Sword from Aegislash will quickly dispatch Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Status conditions cripple certain sets, for instance the Dragon Dance set will have a hard time sweeping if it is burned. The Choice Scarf set, and to a lesser extent the Dragon Dance set, are rendered near useless if paralyzed, as they are hugely focused towards Speed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tyranitar usually opts for Rock Slide over Stone Edge, as it can usually OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame even with an Attack-lowering nature and it being a spread move. If Tyranitar moves before both foes, Rock Slide also has a 46% chance to get at least one flinch. However, because Rock Slide is a spread move, its damage output is reduced, and Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame can be EVed to survive the hit, so Stone Edge can be used to ensure that they are both OHKOed. Stone Edge has other advantages over Rock Slide; for instance, it can bypass Wide Guard and 2HKO defensive Sitrus Berry Rotom-H. Fire Blast is used to hit Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn and Mega Mawile, both of which would be able to beat Tyranitar otherwise. For Tyranitar's secondary STAB move, Dark Pulse is used, as it threatens Ghost- and Psychic-types and generally has good neutral coverage. Protect is an important move for Tyranitar, though Tyranitar has a high damage output, it is relatively slow and therefore requires its teammates to take down the foes that threaten it; Protect buys a free turn to allow for this to happen. Ice Beam allows Tyranitar to better check Dragon-types and can be used over either Fire Blast or Dark Pulse. Like Fire Blast, Ice Beam hits Grass-types for super effective damage, but Tyranitar loses the ability to deal important damage to Steel-types if Ice Beam is used over Fire Blast, and Tyranitar will lose reliable damage if Ice Beam is used instead of Dark Pulse. Alternatively, Tyranitar could use the moves Dark Pulse / Ice Beam / Fire Blast / Protect, which would allow it to have its desired special coverage, but it would lose its ability to counter Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>While Tyranitar could use a more complex spread, it primarily needs to hit as hard and fast as possible; the given spread achieves this. A Modest nature allows Tyranitar to hit harder; however, a Timid nature allows Tyranitar to outspeed a few other Pokemon, such as uninvested base 100s. Life Orb boosts the power of Tyranitar's attacks so that it can hit harder than it otherwise would. Tyranitar's ability Sand Stream automatically induces sand, which allows Tyranitar to check opposing weather teams. Unnerve has a low scope of use and Sand Stream is one of the main reasons to use Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>A lot of Tyranitar's utility is in its ability to shut down opposing weather teams; if the opponent has a weather inducer, it might be worth bringing Tyranitar in when the opponent's weather is set up. Because of Tyranitar's sheer power and coverage, it can be used to KO Pokemon to allow its teammates to have an easier time, making Tyranitar a decent lead option.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Talonflame is a decent partner for Tyranitar, being able to OHKO most Grass- and Fighting-types, many of Tyranitar's common checks. Talonflame can also be used to deal damage and ensure that Tyranitar can pick up KOs it would otherwise miss out on; for Talonflame to be able to perform this role consistently, it should run Choice Band to have the highest damage output possible. In addition, Talonflame can also set up Tailwind, which bolsters Tyranitar's otherwise mediocre Speed stat to the point where it can outspeed most other Pokemon. Rotom-W supports Tyranitar by being able to check Ground- and Water-types, which give Tyranitar problems, and spread burns with Will-O-Wisp. While Tyranitar can check opposing weather teams, it won't win these match-ups by itself; Rotom-H and Ludicolo can check sun and rain, respectively, while individually supporting Tyranitar. Rotom-H spreads burns with Will-O-Wisp and allows Tyranitar to run Ice Beam without hurting the team's overall coverage by running Overheat. Ludicolo, on the other hand, provides Fake Out support and is able to threaten Water- and Ground-types with its STAB moves. Aegislash beats Mega Kangaskhan and Fighting-types, which both seriously threaten Tyranitar. Aegislash also provides Wide Guard support, which blocks super effective Earthquakes. Trick Room setters, such as Gardevoir and Gourgeist-XL, can be used to support Tyranitar. Gardevoir beats both offensive and defensive Fighting-types and can spread burns. While Gourgeist-XL cannot beat Fighting-types offensively, it works great with Tyranitar because it can spread burns and is immune to Fighting-type moves.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Few Pokemon resist Tyranitar's STAB combination of Crunch and Rock Slide. Dragon Dance is the main reason to run physical Tyranitar, as it boosts both Tyranitar's Attack and Speed and solves two of Tyranitar's problems: its relatively low Speed and Intimidate's Attack drop. Protect is crucial to this set, as with Dragon Dance boosts, Tyranitar is likely to be double targeted to prevent it from sweeping; Protect blocks these attacks and allows Tyranitar's ally to remove the threat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar can use a bulkier spread of 180 HP / 12 Atk / 132 Def / 4 SpD / 180 Spe with a Jolly nature, which is never 2HKOed by Garchomp's Earthquake after Mega Evolving or OHKOed by bulky Mega Mawile's Play Rough. After going for Dragon Dance once, Tyranitar will be able to outspeed opposing Choice Scarf Tyranitar, as well as 2HKO Garchomp with Crunch. Tyranitar has the rare combination of enough weaknesses with good enough bulk to make use of Weakness Policy, which boosts Tyranitar's Attack two stages when hit by a super effective move. While Lum Berry gives Tyranitar no offensive advantages like the other two items do, it lets Tyranitar set up on Pokemon such as Rotom-H and Gengar, which would otherwise be able to burn Tyranitar with Will-O-Wisp. On top of that, Lum Berry improves Tyranitar's match-up with Smeargle, which can otherwise outspeed Tyranitar and put it to sleep with Dark Void. Lum Berry can also be used to remove the confusion from Swagger; Tyranitar can take advantage of this by having an ally, such as Meowstic, use Swagger on it, giving it the Attack boosts but not the confusion. A Jolly nature is almost required on non-Mega Tyranitar to allow +1 Tyranitar to outspeed Garchomp, as with an Adamant nature, +1 Tyranitar will only Speed tie with Garchomp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tyranitar can be played as a lead with either Amoonguss or Meowstic, as they can both aid Tyranitar with setting up. By leading with both Tyranitar and Amoonguss or Meowstic, there is a decreased risk of switching them in later in the battle. Tyranitar can also be kept in the back until the Pokemon which threaten it have been KOed, allowing it to sweep late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Amoonguss has access to Rage Powder, which redirects moves away from Tyranitar. This allows Tyranitar to set up without worrying about Will-O-Wisp from the common Rotom formes or super effective moves from Pokemon such as Gardevoir. Meowstic and Klefki can both set up Reflect, Light Screen, and Safeguard with Prankster, allowing Tyranitar to set up without worrying about status moves or taking a large amount of damage. Talonflame can OHKO most Fighting-types, Scrafty being the rare exception, spread Will-O-Wisp to shut down physical attackers, and use Taunt to prevent status moves from affecting Tyranitar. Aegislash is immune to Fighting-type moves and can block spread moves such as Earthquake and Dazzling Gleam with Wide Guard, aiding Tyranitar in setting up.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Slide OHKOes Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame even with a Timid nature. Stone Edge is a more powerful option which OHKOes Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame even when Tyranitar is burned; it also bypasses Wide Guard, ensuring that Tyranitar will get the necessary OHKOs. Both of these Rock-type moves threaten Fire-types in general. Dark Pulse is Tyranitar's secondary STAB move, hitting Ghost-types for super effective damage. Fire Blast hits Steel-types for super effective damage, which would otherwise be able to completely wall this set. Ice Beam OHKOes Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Salamence.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Tyranitar should run max Special Attack and Speed investment to ensure that it hits as hard and fast as possible. With Choice Scarf and a Timid nature, Tyranitar will outspeed max Speed base 115s. Alternatively, running 228 Speed EVs or a Modest nature ensures that Tyranitar is slower than Modest Choice Scarf Politoed, allowing Tyranitar to set up sand after Politoed sets up rain. With 228 Speed EVs and a Timid nature, Tyranitar won't outspeed base 115's Speed, but it will still outspeed Mega Lucario. With a Modest nature, Tyranitar will outspeed Pokemon with base 100 Speed but will only Speed tie with Garchomp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Tyranitar plays well as a lead to pick up a surprise KO at the start of a game, often ending up acting as a hit-and-run Pokemon. It plays well late-game, as it can easily pick off weakened Pokemon with its strong coverage moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Tyranitar requires more offensive support than other sets due to its lack of Protect. Talonflame can easily pick off Fighting- and Steel-types with Brave Bird and Flare Blitz, respectively; because Tyranitar can perform the latter role with Fire Blast, having Talonflame support means that Tyranitar can choose to be locked into a different move. Rotom-W can spread burns with Will-O-Wisp and generally threaten Water-types with Thunderbolt. Rotom-H and Ludicolo help Tyranitar beat opposing sun and rain setters, respectively. Aegislash and other Ghost-types are immune to Fighting-type moves and generally enjoy Tyranitar's coverage.</p>"

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo is synonymous with rain; although rain only lasts five turns, Ludicolo can sweep through entire teams in that duration. Its ability Swift Swim doubles its Speed in rain, allowing Ludicolo to outspeed most other Pokemon. Although Ludicolo's offensive movepool is small, it has all it needs. Its STAB moves Hydro Pump and Giga Drain threaten common Pokemon like Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Tyranitar for super effective damage. Dragon-types which would otherwise pose problems for Ludicolo, Salamence for instance, are OHKOed by Ice Beam. Ludicolo also has access to Rain Dish, which, alongside Ludicolo's good defensive typing and decent special bulk, can make it surprisingly hard to take down, especially when you factor in that most defensive sets use an Assault Vest. Fake Out is a staple move in Doubles, as it gives Ludicolo the option of stopping one of the enemy Pokemon for a turn.</p> <p>Regardless of the set, Ludicolo is dependent on rain, and thus Politoed by extension. Ludicolo has a mediocre Speed stat outside of rain, so many Pokemon threaten it; this is very limiting to teambuilding. As Ludicolo will almost always run the same moves, regardless of set, it can be very predictable. Although Ludicolo has good Special Defense, its Defense is lackluster. Talonflame's ever-present Brave Bird causes huge problems, as it can easily OHKO Ludicolo. Even with Ice Beam, Ludicolo has problems with common bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ludicolo has a large number of usable other moves. One of the more interesting options is Teeter Dance as it allows Ludicolo to confuse all of the Pokemon on the field. Couple this with Ludicolo's blistering Speed in rain, and you can greatly hinder your opponent, if only temporarily. Leech Seed gives Ludicolo an extra form of HP recovery as well as a source of passive damage against your opponent. When used with Rain Dish, Ludicolo recovers around 3/16 of its health each turn. With all of this recovery Ludicolo can use Substitute to great effect. This set should use Giga Drain and Ice Beam for coverage and a similar EV spread to the Assault Vest set, but investing less in Speed and more in Special Defense. Ludicolo can use a Coba Berry to aim to survive a Talonflame's Brave Bird, but it takes a significant amount of investment in bulk to survive the hit even with Coba Berry. Another item Ludicolo can use is the Absorb Bulb, which boosts its Special Attack when it's hit by a Water-type move; Ludicolo can also sponge Water-type attacks easily thanks to its 4x resistance. However, such a set is completely reliant on Politoed for its ability to both set up rain and use Surf to activate the Absorb Bulb, as it is notably weaker without it. All of this means that Ludicolo is far less flexible in teammates and generally far more predictable; the Absorb Bulb is single-use, so Ludicolo will lose its boost if it switches out, which discourages switching. Sitrus Berry can be used on the second set to restore some health. This may be favorable if you are running Swift Swim, as Ludicolo will have less recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Talonflame can comfortably OHKO Ludicolo with its priority Brave Bird, and it doesn't need to fear being outsped either. Although almost always an inferior option to Brave Bird, Tailwind renders Ludicolo's Swift Swim useless.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: In any weather condition other than rain, Ludicolo is quite slow and far easier to take down. Neither Tyranitar nor Mega Charizard Y are OHKOed by Hydro Pump in sand or sun, respectively. However, both take considerable damage. Although not as viable, Abomasnow is never 2HKOed by any of Ludicolo's moves and can easily 2HKO back with Wood Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Though not quite as relevant in VGC 2014 as it has been in the past, Thunder Wave is a good way of checking the offensive set as it neuters Swift Swim. The best user is Gyarados as it can shake off any attack that Ludicolo can use. Prankster Thunder Wave users like Klefki and Meowstic will always go for Thunder Wave before Ludicolo goes for an attack, but neither can take multiple Hydro Pumps. Trick Room is another way of counteracting Swift Swim's effects, but this is harder to set up as no single Trick Room setter can take all of Ludicolo's moves comfortably. In a similar vein, Tailwind doubles your team's Speed, in effect paralleling Ludicolo's boosts. This suffers the same problem as Trick Room as no user of Tailwind can take all of Ludicolo's moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss can take any move from Ludicolo and retaliate in some way. Amoonguss, however, must carry Sludge Bomb to be considered a check.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Hits</strong>: Finally, if all else fails, attacks like Mega Kangaskhan's Return and Mega Mawile's Play Rough can OHKO offensive Ludicolo, due to its poor physical bulk. These are only soft checks as neither enjoy taking a rain-boosted Hydro Pump.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swift Swim": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ludicolo's Water-type STAB moves are boosted 1.5 times by rain, taking them to dangerous levels. For instance, Hydro Pump can OHKO neutral Pokemon such as Mega Mawile and Mega Manectric. Surf is an alternative to Hydro Pump; it has the advantage of hitting both of the opponent's Pokemon, but unfortunately it also hits your own partner. On top of that, it is significantly weaker, not only due to its lower Base Power, but also from being a spread move. Giga Drain acts as a secondary STAB move that allows Ludicolo to beat Rotom-W and somewhat counteract Life Orb recoil with its recovery. Ice Beam complements Ludicolo's STAB moves, giving it perfect neutral coverage. It also allows Ludicolo to threaten common Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Salamence, as they are both easily OHKOed by it. Fake Out gives a partner Pokemon a free turn and generally eases prediction for you. With Rain Dance, Ludicolo can set up rain on its own; this could be of use against Pokemon like Tyranitar that can remove rain and survive a Hydro Pump in sand. Ludicolo can also use Protect in the fourth slot; this could be useful for scouting an opposing Pokemon's set or blocking an attack to allow Ludicolo's partner to take down the threat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs, Ludicolo hits as fast and as hard as possible. Ludicolo with a Modest nature only needs to run 204 EVs in Speed to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Garchomp. However, the extra 52 EVs in HP serve little to no purpose. A Timid nature could be used to outspeed Choice Scarf Salamence in rain and other base 100s. Life Orb is used to make up for Ludicolo's mediocre base 90 Special Attack, and Giga Drain's recovery mitigates Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ludicolo arguably plays best late-game, as it can easily clean up against weakened teams in rain. Hopefully, by this point in the battle, Pokemon which threaten Ludicolo will have been taken care of. Ludicolo can also function as a lead with Fake Out to ease first-turn predictions. Ludicolo can work outside of rain with its good coverage and typing. That said, Ludicolo is far more useful inside of rain as this augments its otherwise mediocre Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Politoed is almost required as a partner, as it automatically starts rain with its ability, Drizzle. As this set is less bulky, it might be favorable to run a bulkier Politoed with Rain Dance rather than an offensive set. However, Choice Scarf Politoed can be used to overwhelm the opponent by outspeeding them and hitting them hard with rain-boosted Hydro Pumps. Ludicolo's biggest weakness is Talonflame, as it will always move before Ludicolo with its priority Brave Bird. Because of this, Electric-types that can deal with Talonflame, such as Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, and, to a lesser extent, Zapdos, are all ideal partners for Ludicolo. Aegislash and Mega Mawile enjoy Ludicolo's presence as Ludicolo beats the Fire- and Ground-types which threaten them, while they can both take on physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan that threaten Ludicolo. Garchomp also deals with both non-Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Mega Charizard Y, the two most common weather inducers. Thanks to Ludicolo's Grass typing, it can take Garchomp's Earthquakes well enough to never be 3HKOed, allowing them to work well together.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Due to this set's more defensive nature, Scald is preferred over Hydro Pump for its perfect accuracy and chance to burn your opponent. That said, if you want more power, Hydro Pump is still an option, as the extra power is noticeable; for instance, Hydro Pump has a good chance to 2HKO Tyranitar in sand, something Scald fails to do. Giga Drain complements this set, acting as an inconsistent form of recovery. It also allows Ludicolo to threaten Rotom-W, along with other Water-types. With Ice Beam, Ludicolo is able to threaten the common Dragon-types in the metagame and potentially break through the bulky Grass-types that would otherwise stop it in its tracks. The fourth moveslot is reserved for Fake Out, which gives a partner Pokemon a free turn and generally eases prediction for you.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set uses the Assault Vest to boost Ludicolo's Special Defense with very little investment, allowing it to invest far more in Defense. With the EVs listed, Ludicolo can survive a maximum Attack Play Rough from Mega Mawile, which is one of the strongest neutral physical hits in the game. On top of that, a Jolly nature Garchomp will never 2HKO with Dragon Claw and has a decent chance to be OHKOed by Ice Beam. With the Assault Vest, Ludicolo is never 2HKOed by Modest Salamence's Draco Meteor, not considering the Special Attack drop. Rain Dish gives Ludicolo recovery equal to Leftovers each turn in rain, improving its overall longevity. With the Speed EVs, Ludicolo can outspeed the most defensive Rotom-W and threaten them directly with Giga Drain. Ludicolo will hit 214 Speed in rain thanks to Swift Swim, allowing it to outspeed most other Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although Assault Vest and Ludicolo's good bulk can make it difficult to take down and help it take on many Pokemon, it lacks Protect. Because of this, Pokemon that can deal with it must be taken care of before Ludicolo can come in safely. If, however, you feel confident enough, Ludicolo can function as a decent lead with Fake Out. This set is far less dependent on rain and can function well outside of it. It is worth noting that Ludicolo is far harder to take down inside of rain as it gets recovery from not only Giga Drain but also Rain Dish.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ludicolo appreciates Pokemon that can take on Talonflame, such as Rotom-W. If you aren't running rain, as this set isn't completely dependent on it, Rotom-H can make an excellent partner with its ability to beat the bulky Grass-types that Ludicolo has problems with. Politoed is always appreciated, as it brings the rain, which lets Ludicolo function at its fullest by either giving it recovery each turn or doubling its Speed, while boosting the power of Scald or Hydro Pump. Garchomp takes on opposing weather setters and generally has good offensive synergy with Ludicolo, as Earthquake hits Ludicolo for little damage, especially when considering the latter's recovery. Aegislash takes on Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Mawile, which would otherwise cause problems for Ludicolo, even with the investment.</p>"

  "Mawile": {
    "overview": "<p>In previous generations, Mawile was always a disappointing package of a Pokemon, with cool abilities and an interesting movepool but without the tools needed to use them due to its horrid base stat total. Gen 6 was awfully kind to Mawile however, giving it a very useful secondary typing in Fairy and a Mega Evolution that boosts its Attack to obscene levels with not only a stat boost but the coveted Huge Power. Life isn't perfect for Mawile, as its two weaknesses are both extremely common, it's painfully slow, and it's plagued by the common Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp, but it's more than powerful enough to pull its weight. Mawile is now a Pokemon whose useful defensive typing, possession of Intimidate before Mega Evolution, and Attack stat that makes Kyurem-B blush post-Mega Evolution has it sitting pretty as one of the ruleset's best Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mawile's typing occasionally gives it turns where neither opponent can do anything to it and a switch is fairly obvious. Mawile can take advantage of those turns by taking the time to use Substitute or Swords Dance and put some serious pressure on the opponent. Rock Slide provides Mawile with a way to maim Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame and damage Rotom-H, but it is very weak against most everything else. Intimidate is everywhere, so if you find enemy Intimidate drops to be a huge nuisance, you can experiment with Hyper Cutter, though you should really weigh the pros and cons before doing this because Intimidate is so fantastic. Finally, Mawile has little to damage Ferrothorn, so Fire Fang can be used. Just be aware you aren't getting much more that a hit on Ferrothorn using it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types resist Play Rough and Iron Head and can play around Sucker Punch. Rotom-H, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame are the biggest pains as they all have the potential to OHKO a max HP Mawile and can survive a Sucker Punch beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Like just about every physical attacker in the tier, Mawile is plagued by Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Gourgeist, and even the occasional Talonflame. Burning a Mawile is a big step in disposing of it. Still, even when burned, it's essentially operating with its regular base 105 Attack stat, so be cautious.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Mawile hates Intimidate from most any source. Enemy Mawile before they Mega Evolve are a pain, as are Gyarados and Mega Manectric. Even the Fairy-type-weak Salamence can get off an Intimidate, particularly on the opening turn, and then run away to safety. Krookodile gets a special mention as well, as despite also being weak to the Fairy-type, it threatens Mawile with a super effective Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Any Steel-type that doesn't gain a weakness to the Dark-type or neutrality to the Fairy-type or Iron Head from a secondary typing can manage alright against Mawile. Scizor and Ferrothorn (preferably with Iron Head over Gyro Ball) in particular are reasonable answers to Mawile. Just be cautious of the occasional Fire Fang.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon with Super Effective Moves</strong>: Even if they can't take a hit, Earthquake users such as Garchomp and Krookodile and things with alright Special Attack and Fire Blast can pose a major threat to Mawile, so long as they can outspeed it and survive a Sucker Punch.</p>",

      "Mega Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough is Mega Mawile's most powerful STAB attack and should be relied on primarily to lay down the hurt. Sucker Punch allows Mega Mawile to bypass its bad Speed for a modest hit if it can guess its opponent's moves correctly. Iron Head provides a secondary and 100% accurate STAB attack, making it very useful despite having rather poor coverage with Play Rough. Protect is too fantastic a move to give up, letting Mawile dodge double targets and allowing Mawile's partner to dispose of Pokemon that threaten it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Intimidate is among the best abilities in the game and makes Mawile a good team player before it Mega Evolves, cushioning physical attacks for both it and its teammates. The EV spread is simple; Attack is maximized with the rest dumped into HP to give Mawile the best possible bulk. Mega Mawile hits a breathtaking 344 Attack with maximum investment, but even with little investment, it can still OHKO frail threats and Pokemon hit for super effective damage. If you find the extra damage unnecessary, feel free to take EVs out of Attack, though be warned that you essentially lose two Attack points for every one you gain in another stat. Below are a few useful investment benchmarks. Use whatever sounds useful based off your other team members:</p> <p>Of course, Mega Mawile is very slow, so if you wish to use it alongside a Trick Room inducer, giving it a Speed IV of 0 and a Brave nature can work. Just beware that neutral-natured Amoonguss with no investment will be able to outrun and Spore Mawile outside of Trick Room if you do this.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't feel pressured to Mega Evolve as soon as Mawile hits the field. In fact, it's recommend you Mega Evolve only when you need to attack. Intimidate is a very, very useful ability, and preserving it throughout the game is very useful. On the subject of preserving your Mega Evolution, it's recommended you preserve Mawile until your opponent's most serious threats to it are seriously incapacitated or KOed. With its two major weaknesses gone, Mawile's power is something scary late-game.</p> <p>Mawile on its own, despite being so powerful, is still a slow Pokemon firing off single target attacks and it enjoys team support to operate at maximum efficiency. Trick Room is a welcomed form of speed control, as it allows Mawile to deal damage first without relying on the iffy Sucker Punch. Other forms of disruptive support like Rage Powder and Fake Out are also very welcome, narrowing the situation down for Mawile, if only for one turn with Fake Out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Salamence is an amazing partner for Mawile. The two of them generate frequent switch-in opportunities for each other and cover each other's weaknesses perfectly. Between the two of them, they only share four neutralities. Choice Scarf Salamence in particular can snipe a lot of the Pokemon that give Mawile trouble with its immediate Speed and power. Moreover, as both Pokemon have Intimidate, the combination can punish most physical attackers brutally. Rotom-H is a great answer to Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, which Mawile enjoys not having to deal with. Tyranitar also helps a lot against Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame with Sand Stream and Rock Slide, though neither Tyranitar nor Mawile are very comfortable around Garchomp. Aromatisse can set up Trick Room and make Mawile really dangerous. It also provides some valuable chip damage with Dazzling Gleam that pushes a lot of 2HKOs on things like Rotom-W into OHKOs. Despite sharing a typing, Mawile and Aromatisse actually have fair defensive synergy together. Finally, Amoonguss can redirect anything Rotom-W wants to do, allowing Mawile to operate in relative peace.</p>"

  "Manectric": {
    "overview": "<p>This season, Manectric has proven itself to be a top tier threat. Not much has changed for regular Manectric, but its Mega Evolution is an entirely different story. After Mega Evolving, Manectric becomes the fastest Pokemon in the tier with access to both Intimidate as well as a switching move in Volt Switch. Having decent 70 / 80 / 80 defensive stats (a slight boost from regular Manectric's stats) and only one weakness, Mega Manectric is able to take hits as well as dish them out. This season, being a special attacker is a gift due to the increased usage of Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp, and Mega Manectric's base 135 Special Attack makes it a force to be reckoned with. However, Garchomp, which also received a Mega Evolution, is prominent in the VGC '14 season in both its regular and its Mega Evolved forms. Its STAB Earthquake, especially with a Sand Force boost, makes it a big obstacle that Manectric has to deal with quite often. Furthermore, Manectric has a poor movepool, and usually has to choose from less than ten moves. Despite these drawbacks, Mega Manectric can wreak havoc to both unprepared and prepared teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite its scarce movepool, Manectric has a few other options. First off, Manectric can opt to run Discharge if it is partnered with a Ground-type, but this is usually unadvised as Manectric cannot participate as part of a DisQuake combo. Manectric can run Thunder, but the move is only viable in rain, as its shaky accuracy is not worth the risk otherwise. Lastly, Manectric has the option to run Hidden Power Grass instead of Hidden Power Ice, but the list of what it hits harder is slim.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rotom-H</strong>: Rotom-H resists every move that Manectric can throw at it and is able to KO Manectric before Manectric KOes it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Manectric is not that bulky and will most likely fall to Ground-type moves like Earthquake. However, Manectric may be able to survive if its opponent is weakened by Intimidate. As a general rule, if Manectric cannot OHKO its opponent, it will be KOed in return.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Like Ground-types, Dragon-types can be a pain to deal with. Unless Manectric carries Hidden Power Ice, Dragon-types resist any move it can throw at them, and can KO it with their naturally powerful attacks. Even if Manectric carries Hidden Power Ice, Goodra can take the hits due to its insanely high special bulk.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard Mega": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Although Manectric's movepool is small, the moves that it has access to are quite varied in typing. Thunderbolt is the main choice for Manectric as it is a strong Electric-type STAB move. Volt Switch is another option that allows Manectric to deal a good chunk of damage due to its high base Special Attack, and then switch out so it can reactivate Intimidate when brought back in. Manectric has two options for the next moveslot: Overheat and Flamethrower. Flamethrower is a strong Fire-type move that deals a lot damage without any drawbacks. Overheat, on the other hand, is stronger, but lowers Manectric's Special Attack, which is a price that it may be unwilling to pay. The third slot is dependent on personal preference. Hidden Power Ice is the main choice as it can remove Ground-types that usually wall Manectric, and comes in handy when dealing with Garchomp. Manectric can try Snarl, which deals damage and cripples opposing special attackers. For the last slot, Protect is a must as it provides all the useful utilities that come with it in double battles.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Most of the set is quite standard. Since this set is meant for Mega Manectric, Manectite is obviously the item of choice. The ability Manectric has prior to Mega Evolution should be Lightning Rod, as it allows Manectric to take advantage of Electric-type attacks. The other abilities are not useful, as Static is based on chance and relies on Manectric being attacked to activate, and Minus is completely useless.</p> <p>The EV spread is standard for special attackers and sweepers. 252 EVs in Special Attack are used to maximize Manectric's Special Attack, while the 252 EVs in Speed help to boost up its Speed. Lastly, both Timid and Modest natures are good on Mega Manectric. A Modest nature maximizes its Special Attack and is viable as Manectric already has a high base Speed, while a Timid nature helps it outspeed certain Pokemon prior to Mega Evolution, mainly Garchomp and Charizard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Manectric works nicely as a lead and can also keep momentum going with Volt Switch. If they have several physical attackers, it's recommended you lead off with Manectric and activate Intimidate. This is useful as after Manectric has Mega-Evolved, Intimidate will reactivate every time it is brought back into play. Using this, you can completely cripple opposing physical sweepers and render them useless. If your opponent's Pokemon are likely to fire off Electric-type moves, you should hold off on Mega Evolving since Manectric can take advantage of them with Lightning Rod.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Manectric has some really good teammates that can complement its versatility. Gyarados works very well with Manectric, as it can take care of Ground-type Pokemon that normally scare Manectric. In addition, they both have Intimidate, and a double Intimidate core severely hampers Pokemon that depend on physical moves. Another good teammate for Manectric is Amoonguss, as it does not fear Pokemon that normally target Manectric and can offer good support thanks to its access to Rage Powder and Spore. Ground-types are nice teammates and allow Manectric to spam Discharge, as they do not take any damage due to their immunity to Electric-type moves. Lastly, Politoed works nicely due to Drizzle, which overrides other weather conditions and raises Thunder's accuracy to 100%.</p>"

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<p>Salamence has quite a lot going for it in VGC. For one, its ability, Intimidate, weakens physical attackers on the switch-in. On top of that, Salamence also has decent bulk and combined with its Dragon typing giving it resistances to many common types, it will survive for a relatively long time for an attacker. Salamence has a respectable Special Attack and the movepool to back it up. Salamence's base Speed is 100, which lets it Speed tie or outspeed many Pokemon in the format.</p> <p>Salamence has a 4x weakness to Ice-type moves, though, which makes it easily OHKOed. Many of the Pokemon which outspeed Salamence, be this through Choice Scarf or higher base Speed, can OHKO it with their STAB moves. Although Salamence's movepool gives it all it needs, Salamence is quite predictable due to it not being too expansive; this is only worsened by Salamence's reliance of low accuracy moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower can be run over Fire Blast for increased accuracy; however, but it comes at the price of power. This drop in power is very noticeable as you Salamence loses out on 2HKOes on bulkier Pokemon. Such as Aegislash. Hidden Power Flying can be run as a secondary STAB move to hit Fighting- and Grass-types for super effective damage. However, it is weaker than Dragon Pulse. If you fear Dark Void Smeargle or sleep-inducing moves in general, Sleep Talk is an option on Choice sets to somewhat bypass these negative effects. A bulkier spread could be run, but know that what you are investing in bulk normally comes at the cost of Speed. Losing Speed for bulk isn't always advisable on sets with Choice items as Speed ties are generally very important to at least maintain for Salamence. Yache Berry or Focus Sash can be run to the same effect allowing Salamence to survive a hit before dealing out an attack of its own. Yache Berry is usually worse than Haban Berry given how much more common Dragon-type moves are, though. A Focus Sash can be used to allow Salamence to survive any move from full health, though given the presence of sand Salamence can often find itself being KOed at the end of the turn. A fully physical set could be run with moves like Dragon Claw, Earthquake, Crunch, Fire Fang, and possibly even Steel Wing and Zen Headbutt could be used to some effect, but the presence of Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate mean that it will end up hitting far less hard than the special sets very quickly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gardevoir</strong>: Gardevoir is hands down the best Salamence counter, as it can easily take any of Salamence's moves, being immune to its STAB Dragon-type moves and having enough bulk not to fear the coverage options that Salamence carries. On top of that it can easily OHKO Salamence back with its STAB Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mawile</strong>: Although Mega Mawile fears Fire-type moves that Salamence commonly carries, none of them can OHKO it, and even after the Intimidate drop, Mega Mawile can OHKO Salamence with Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can take any of Salamence's moves with relative ease and OHKO back with Ice Beam, while STAB Rock Slide will 2HKO most of the time even at -1 Attack.</p> <p><strong>Mamoswine</strong>: Mamoswine's STAB Ice-types moves can easily OHKO Salamence. Draco Meteor will do massive damage to Mamoswine, however. It is worth mentioning that at -1 Ice Shard does not OHKO Salamence.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash</strong>: Aegislash only needs to fear the 2HKO from Fire Blast. However, after a boost from Weakness Policy, Aegislash can OHKO at +2 with Shadow Ball or Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Mega Manectric</strong>: Mega Manectric can't shrug off Salamence's moves, but it can OHKO it with ease with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Faster Dragon-types</strong>: Faster opposing Dragon-types can potentially OHKO with their super effective STAB moves. This goes both ways, though, as Salamence threatens them just as much.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Both Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse are run, with Draco Meteor being run for picking up OHKOs against opposing Dragon-types and frailer attackers. Dragon Pulse is a more reliable STAB option that doesn't miss or result in Salamence's Special Attack being halved. The next move is Fire Blast to hit Steel-types, which would otherwise be able to take its Salamence's Dragon-type STAB attacks. It is also used to hit Grass-types like Amoonguss, which can take Draco Meteor, for super effective damage. The final moveslot is reserved for coverage moves, the choice of which depends on what your team needs. Rock Slide has a percentage chance to OHKO both Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame. Stone Edge can be run over Rock Slide to guarantee the OHKO on Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame and generally hits a lot harder than Rock Slide. Because of how common Rock Slide is, Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame are often paired with a Wide Guard user to block Rock Slides. Stone Edge has the advantage of hitting through Wide Guard as it isn't a spread move. However, it comes at the cost of accuracy and the loss of the flinch chance. Hydro Pump can be used with a Timid nature, as it also guarantees an OHKO against Talonflame, and hits other Fire-types harder coming off the more invested Special Attack.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Speed-boosting nature is run to outspeed and Speed tie with other Choice Scarf Salamence running Modest or a Speed-boosting nature respectively. The EVs on this spread are simple; their purpose to both maximize Speed and Special Attack so that Salamence hits as hard and as fast as possible. A Modest nature could be run for a slight Special Attack buff if your team doesn't fear opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Salamence is commonly played as a lead thanks to its high Speed, coverage, and Intimidate. Getting off an early-game Intimidate weakens your opponent's physical attackers before they have a chance to attack. The move that should be most used on this set is Draco Meteor, as it hits significantly harder than any other move Salamence has access to. Although there is a Special Attack drop, switching out isn't hugely detrimental as it gives Salamence another chance to activate Intimidate. The only times you will find yourself using Dragon Pulse are against weakened opposing Pokemon or when you can't switch to reset Salamence's Special Attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Kangaskhan provides Fake Out support, which is always appreciated. On top of that, it can take on many of Salamence's checks and counters such as Gardevoir and Tyranitar by simply overpowering them with its ability, Parental Bond. Although Salamence and it share many of the same weaknesses, Garchomp has great offensive synergy alongside Salamence, partlydue to Garchomp's ability to fire off Earthquake freely thanks to Salamence's Flying typing. Rotom-W and Rotom-H both provide Will-O-Wisp support, also dealing with Steel-types that can take a Fire Blast in the case of Rotom-H. However, Rotom-W has the advantage of not sharing Salamence's weakness to Rock. Steel-types like Mega Mawile and Aegislash both have good defensive and offensive synergy alongside Salamence. This is because they can take any super effective hits that threaten Salamence and also dish out a sizable amounts of damage to many of Salamence's checks and counters, Gardevoir and Tyranitar for instance.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Salamence's most powerful STAB move, and can pick up many KOs on common frail Pokemon or against opposing Dragon-types. While Draco Meteor is for power, Dragon Pulse is for consistency. It has the benefits of guaranteed accuracy and no effect on Salamence's Special Attack. Fire Blast is to hit the Steel-types that resist Salamence's STAB Dragon-type moves for super effective damage. As this set isn't running a Choice item and Salamence is a highly targeted pokemon, Protect is a strongly recommended move for not only scouting but also waiting a turn so your partner can take down the threat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Haban Berry is run to allow Salamence to survive a Dragon-type hit. Draco Meteor is then fired off against the opposing Dragon-type for super effective damage, usually for an OHKO. However, for those who want extra power, Life Orb can be used, on top of which a Modest nature could also be run to further maximize Salamence's Special Attack. That said, it is advisable not to run a Modest nature when not carrying a Haban Berry as you are then losing Speed as well as the ability to survive a super effective hit. The EV spread is again to make Salamence's Special Attack and Speed as high as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because of the immense usefulness of Intimidate to weaken physical attackers, Salamence is often played as a lead. This is done to to somewhat check other common leads such as Mega Kangaskhan. Unlike any of the other sets, this set carries Protect. Protect is played to ease prediction and scout for an unexpected coverage move, like Ice Beam on Tyranitar. On top of that, it gives Salamence's partner a chance to KO the opposing threat. Dragon Pulse should be used when using Draco Meteor is not recommended, for instance when Salamence is one of the last Pokemon on field and needs to maintain its Special Attack for some later use. It is also used when the extra power of Draco Meteor isn't necessary and the loss of Special Attack would be a unneeded hindrance to your team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Steel-types are problematic to Salamence even with Fire Blast, running Salamence alongside Fire- and Fighting-types to take on the Steel-types that can survive a Fire Blast is always a good idea. Other Intimidate Pokemon such as Mawile and Mega Manectric provide nice support and further weaken physical attackers; however,  be cautious of Pokemon like Bisharp that can utilize this to boost their Attack higher thanks to Defiant. Fairy-types, which are immune to Salamence's Dragon-type STAB moves, are weak to Steel-type moves. Steel also resists all of the types that Salamence is weak to. Steel-types thereby have both good defensive and offensive synergy alongside Salamence. Good partners are Mawile, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>As with the sets above, both Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse are run to give Salamence both a powerful and reliable STAB option. Fire Blast hits significantly harder than the above sets, and hits Steel-types for super effective damage which that would otherwise wall this set. Finally this set runs Hydro Pump to hit common Fire- and Rock-types for super effective damage and complement the rest of Salamence's coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Unlike the previous sets this set uses a Modest nature to hit as hard as possible. However, a Timid nature can be run to maximize Speed if needed. Choice Specs hits far harder than either of the previous sets, which also guarantees more OHKOs than any other set. This power is such that a Modest Choice Specs Salamence's Draco Meteor is the most powerful Dragon-type move in the format.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As stated, Draco Meteor is the hardest hitting Dragon-type move in the format, and because of this a lot of the time it is a good idea to just use Draco Meteor. As stated before, switching out to reset Salamence's Special Attack can be beneficial, as it also allows another Intimidate to further weaken physical attackers later in the game. If a Modest nature is run you must bear in mind that Salamence no longer outspeeds many Pokemon it did with Timid; however, the increase in power is very noticeable and you must play it to these strengths. As a lot of other Pokemon with a base Speed of 100 run an Attack- or Special Attack-boosting nature, Speed ties might not be lost. Do not bank on this, however. For instance Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y both commonly run a neutral nature.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tailwind is far more appreciated on this set than any other as it focuses more heavily on power than Speed. This extra Speed allows Salamence to take care of many of its old checks and counters. Fast Pokemon like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Mamoswine can take on opposing Dragon-types that threaten Salamence. Steel-, Fire-, and Fighting-types are also all welcome partners for Salamence as they care of Steel- and Fairy-types.</p>"

  "Roserade": {
    "overview": "<p>At a glance, it looks like there is almost no reason to use Roserade in VGC. Amoonguss and Venusaur are both Grass / Poison types that not only see much more use in VGC, but also have a lot of positive traits over Roserade. Amoonguss boasts much greater bulk, a 100% accurate sleep move in Spore, and Rage Powder to redirect moves; Venusaur has increased Speed in sun thanks to Chlorophyll and a bulky Mega evolution to take hits more easily. However, Roserade has plenty of advantages over these two. Firstly, Roserade has a Special Attack stat of 125, meaning it hits harder than both Amoonguss and Venusaur. It also has 90 Speed, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Gardevoir, and Chandelure and put them to sleep before they can attack. Its ability, Technician, gives a boost to Hidden Power, giving it a powerful 90 Base Power Hidden Power Fire to hit Steel-types. It also deals with Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Azumarill, and Politoed very well. However, Roserade does have quite a few flaws. While it isn't necessarily slow, it's not very fast either, and is still outsped by Pokemon such as Charizard, Salamence, and Mega Kangaskhan. It also has quite poor physical bulk, meaning it has trouble taking physical attacks. Lastly, Roserade does have slight four-moveslot syndrome, as it really wants to run Magical Leaf, Sludge Bomb, Hidden Power Fire, Sleep Powder, and Protect all on the same set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ice is a nice option for nailing Dragon-types, though the loss of Hidden Power Fire is almost never worth it. Giga Drain can be used to help recover HP, but it is weaker than both Magical Leaf and Leaf Storm and is usually used better by Venusaur, which has better bulk. Weather Ball can be used on rain teams for a powerful Water-type attack, though it isn't very helpful otherwise. Focus Sash is very helpful for being able to survive an attack at full health, as Roserade is frail. However, it has to give up Life Orb in order to do this, and sandstorm damage and priority attacks can easily pick off a 1% Roserade. Choice Scarf and Choice Specs are decent options for hitting faster or harder, respectively, but Roserade is usually outclassed by other Choice item users, such as Gardevoir. Natural Cure is a useful ability for being able to cure status when Roserade switches out, though the loss of Technician means it usually isn't worth it. Hidden Power Rock can be used for Fire- and Flying-types, though most of them outspeed Roserade and Sludge Bomb usually hits these Pokemon hard anyway. Lastly, Wide Lens can be used for a more accurate Sleep Powder, though the loss in Life Orb makes it an inferior option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Talonflame can easily OHKO Roserade with their Flying-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Charizard, Rotom-H, and Chandelure can all OHKO Roserade with STAB Fire Blast or Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Gardevoir can OHKO Roserade with a STAB Psychic-type move.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Mamoswine can OHKO Roserade with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: In general, powerful attackers that outspeed Roserade can take it out with relative ease. This includes Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Salamence, Hydreigon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Magical Leaf is Roserade's main STAB attack, as it doesn't have the drawbacks of Leaf Storm and is more powerful than Giga Drain. It also has the same Base Power as Energy Ball when Technician is factored in, though Magical Leaf has the added bonus of never missing. Leaf Storm is another option for a Grass-type STAB attack, and is guaranteed to OHKO the standard Rotom-W set. However, the Special Attack drop hinders Roserade's performance for the rest of the time it's on the field. Sludge Bomb is a good secondary STAB attack that does great damage to Fairy- and Grass-types such as Gardevoir and Ludicolo. Protect is a very viable option on Roserade, as it helps it avoid spread moves and punishes double targeting. Hidden Power Fire is a great move for Roserade, as it's powerful with a boost from Technician and hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn for super effective damage. It's also a better option against Grass-types that take neutral damage from Sludge Bomb, such as Amoonguss and non-Mega Venusaur. Sleep Powder is a great move in VGC, as it shuts down one of the opponent's Pokemon and is easily spammable due to the lack of Sleep Clause.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is the item of choice on Roserade, as it boosts its already powerful attacks and helps it distinguish itself from other Grass-types. Technician is an amazing ability that is helpful for boosting the power of Hidden Power Fire, making it from 60 Base Power to 90 Base Power. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment helps Roserade to be as powerful and fast as possible. A Timid nature further boosts Roserade's Speed stat, though a Modest nature can be used to guarantee an OHKO on standard Rotom-W with Magical Leaf.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure there's a reason you're using Roserade instead of something like Venusaur or Amoonguss. Roserade's higher Special Attack, Speed, and Technician-boosted Hidden Power Fire are all reasons it may find a spot on your team. Make sure to remember that Roserade isn't the bulkiest of Pokemon, and as such isn't made to take attacks. It is best to bring Roserade when you see a Water-type on your opponent's team, such as Rotom-W or Politoed. It's also wise to not bring Roserade if Fire-, Flying-, Psychic-, and Ice-types are common on your opponent's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that hate Water-types, such as Talonflame, Chandelure, and Mamoswine all appreciate Roserade's powerful Grass-type STAB attacks. Pokemon such as Garchomp and Mega Mawile also dislike Rotom-W, making Roserade a helpful partner for these Pokemon. Rotom-W and Rotom-H are helpful partners for Roserade, as they can absorb the Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-type moves Roserade hates. Tyranitar also makes a helpful partner, as it can absorb Flying-, Fire-, and Psychic-type attacks for Roserade quite easily.</p>"

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>Garchomp checks a handful of threats with its powerful Rock Slide and STAB Earthquake combination as well as with its STAB Dragon Claw. All of these features mesh well with other Pokemon too, allowing it to form beastly cores with other threatening Pokemon. Its amazing stat spread is rounded off by a stellar base 102 Speed stat, allowing to outrun most of the unboosted format, including notable base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y. However, because Garchomp is such a strong Pokemon in VGC 2014, almost every team will have a fairly solid answer for it. It hates the large amount of Intimidate and moves that inflict burn that float around the format. It is also slightly limited by the fact that its STAB spread move, Earthquake, hits its partner as well as the opposition.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute, used alongside Leftovers, turns Garchomp into one of the best ways to deal with bulky Rotom-H. Substitute's ability to block Will-O-Wisp is the main draw to using such a set. Garchomp can use many items to great effect such as a Life Orb, Choice Band, Dragon Fang, and Soft Sand. Rock Slide can always be changed to Stone Edge in order to avoid Wide Guard, but Rock Slide's flinch chance and Garchomp's Speed make Rock Slide worth it a good amount of the time. Swords Dance is a way to counteract Intimidate, but Garchomp will hardly ever find room for it. Garchomp has the ability to Mega Evolve, but it loses its fantastic Speed when doing so while only having power near the level of a Life Orb Garchomp. Sand Veil should only be run on Garchomp if Tyranitar is somewhere on your team, and even then Rough Skin is the better option. Fire Blast cooks Ferrothorn and Scizor should your team have issues with these two.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fast Super Effective Attackers</strong>: Choice Scarf Salamence, Gardevoir, and Hydreigon are the big three checks to Garchomp, while the occasional Noivern, Greninja, and Weavile are also trouble. They all outspeed and KO Garchomp with STAB super effective moves. However, all of these Pokemon need to watch out for Choice Scarf Garchomp to some extent or another.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Gengar, Rotom-A, or Gourgeist will take a hit from Garchomp, or outspeed it in Gengar's case, and burn it so that it is significantly hindered the rest of the battle. However, if Garchomp is holding a Lum Berry, these Pokemon need to hit two Will-O-Wisps in a row in order to check Garchomp.</p> <p><strong>Tanks with Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Mega Mawile, Azumarill, Mamoswine, and Sylveon can all take any hit from Garchomp and KO it with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage Moves</strong>: Hidden Power Ice is a fairly common coverage move that Garchomp hates. Ice Beam is a move that is distributed fairly well, so Garchomp should be wary of Pokemon with usable Special Attack that get this move, such as Tyranitar.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Garchomp's STAB spread move that is able to dish out a lot of damage in one turn and is Garchomp's primary weapon against metagame-defining Steel-types such as Aegislash and Mega Mawile. Dragon Claw is Garchomp's strongest move against a single target and does loads of damage to the popular Dragon-types in the format. It has very good neutral coverage with Earthquake and is also slightly stronger than a super effective Rock Slide, so keep this in mind against Rotom-H. Rock Slide is an excellent move that allows Garchomp to OHKO Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y while having excellent neutral coverage alongside Earthquake. Additionally, Garchomp's good Speed stat allows it to abuse the 30% flinch chance as well. Protect allows Garchomp to scout for a rogue Hidden Power Ice and give its teammate a turn to KO whatever is threatening Garchomp at the time.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment give Garchomp the ability to hit as hard as possible while still outrunning most of the format. Although Garchomp does have an incredible Speed stat, a Focus Sash is the preferred item, because Choice Scarf users and speed control methods that aim to take out Garchomp have become extremely common. A Rocky Helmet allows Garchomp to punish Pokemon for attacking it; Mega Kangaskhan especially hates the item because it attacks more than once with Parental Bond and takes a lot of damage from it and Rough Skin as a result. A Lum Berry allows Garchomp to take on bulky Will-O-Wisp users, namely the Rotom-A formes, a little bit better and makes it one of the best answers to bulky Rotom-H. Rough Skin is the preferred ability due to Sand Stream's nerf and Tyranitar's consequent decrease in prominence; it also punishes physically biased attackers, especially Mega Kangaskhan. The nature choice on Garchomp is quite the toss-up. Adamant Garchomp has the ability to OHKO the increasingly popular Hydreigon, has a slight chance to OHKO other Garchomp, and always OHKOes Salamence if Garchomp is unaffected by Intimidate. A Jolly nature allows Garchomp to outrun fully invested, positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Charizard and Mega Kangaskhan, and Speed tie, at worst, with other Garchomp. If a Focus Sash or Yache Berry is not used, an EV spread of 12 HP / 224 Atk / 20 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to nearly always survive Mega Manectric's Hidden Power Ice, and survive Zapdos's Hidden Power Ice all the time.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp is extremely prevalent and is something Garchomp should stay away from; this is less important if Garchomp is carrying a Lum Berry. Garchomp can perform well at any time during a game, but it will usually do better later in the game when there are less Pokemon that are built specifically to surprise KO or check Garchomp. Finding these surprises and methods of bringing Garchomp down while it is still safe in your party can give Garchomp the knowledge to play around such tactics. Using a Haban Berry or Yache Berry can change Garchomp's playstyle, as KOing Choice Scarf Hydreigon or Mega Manectric can be a real game changer.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garchomp is a Pokemon that will fit on a plethora of teams with different goals and strategies. In other words, it is silly to focus a team around it, due to its ability to fit just about anywhere. There are Pokemon that make using Garchomp easier, though, with Levitate users and Flying-types being notable due to their immunity to Garchomp's Earthquake. Garchomp forms a pretty neat core with Mega Charizard Y or Talonflame, can form a double dragon core with Salamence, and has fantastic offensive synergy with Gardevoir and other Fairy-types. Rotom-H can be used to absorb Fairy-type attacks aimed at Garchomp, while Rotom-W takes Ice-type attacks like they are nothing. Steel-types, such as Mawile and Aegislash, can also take Ice-type moves easily while also resisting Garchomp's weakness to Dragon-type attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Garchomp's STAB move with impressive damage output and spread effect. It allows Garchomp to heavily damage the opposition before being taken down by other Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Gardevoir. Dragon Claw is Garchomp's secondary STAB move and outdamages any move on the set against a single target when hitting neutrally. Rock Slide's primary targets are Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, but with Garchomp's already high Speed and the boost from its Choice Scarf, it can easily make use of Rock Slide's nasty flinch chance. Iron Head is the move you will least use on this set, as its only target is Gardevoir, which is OHKOed 90% of the time with no bulk investment.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred on this Garchomp because it allows Garchomp to OHKO 4 HP Hydreigon with maximum Attack investment while Timid Choice Scarf Salamence will be beating Garchomp anyways thanks to Intimidate. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Salamence if damage on it is crucial, but, as stated before, Salamence will usually beat Garchomp no matter what its nature is. Maximum Speed investment allows Garchomp to outrun max Speed Modest-natured Choice Scarf Hydreigon and gives it the ability to outrun and KO a Modest Choice Scarf Salamence if it comes in after Intimidate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Garchomp should be used as a surprise above anything else. It has the ability to damage its faster checks for its team members. The trick is to blindside your opponent with Garchomp's Speed and proceed to outrun and damage their Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Tyranitar, or Gardevoir. When Garchomp's surprise factor has been removed, it will usually take on another form of usefulness with Rock Slide. Using its Choice Scarf to augment its already nice Speed, this Garchomp one of the fastest Rock Slide users in the game and is able to potentially flinch a lot of Pokemon in the format. It can also clean up late-game with one of its STAB moves should the conditions be right. Remember that this Garchomp will be Choice-locked into the first move you pick until it switches. Because very dangerous Pokemon are immune to Garchomp's STAB moves, Garchomp has to be very careful so that it doesn't kill its team's game momentum, potentially letting an opposing threat nab a KO or sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This particular Garchomp is specialized in nabbing key surprise KOs and damage, so pair it with Pokemon that can take advantage of this. Tyranitar enjoys having Choice Scarf Gardevoir removed and Choice Specs or Life Orb Hydreigon enjoys having Gardevoir and Choice Scarf Hydreigon heavily damaged or KOed. Choice Scarf Garchomp can almost always get a large amount of damage off on opposing Garchomp, so a partnered Mega Kangaskhan only needs to touch Rough Skin once, at worst, to KO the Garchomp.</p>"

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Mamoswine lost a small niche in this year's VGC format without genies to KO, there are still many reasons to use this friendly mammoth. First and foremost, it is still the epitome of an anti-metagame Pokemon. Mamoswine has a superb base 130 Attack stat and an excellent offensive typing, with Ice-type STAB moves such as Icicle Crash being capable of OHKOing Amoonguss and Ice Shard being capable of OHKOing uninvested Garchomp and Salamence without Intimidate. In addition, it has an incredibly strong Earthquake that rips through Steel-types such as Aegislash and Mega Mawile, as well as Tyranitar. Mamoswine also has a nifty Electric immunity, and its ability, Thick Fat, gives it extra bulk to survive Fire-type attacks not boosted by STAB, such as Mega Manectric's Overheat. However, Mamoswine is still fairly slow at base 80 Speed, and with a low Special Defense, it is easily KOed by both Mega Charizard Y and Rotom-W, two very common Pokemon in the metagame. Finally, it is vulnerable to priority moves such as Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and to a lesser extent, Talonflame's Brave Bird.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be run with Icicle Spear to outspeed and destroy Focus Sash Garchomp. If you're willing to sacrifice more bulk and a moveslot, Mamoswine can run Freeze Dry with a Naive nature to OHKO Gyarados and 3HKO Rotom-W. Oddly enough, Mamoswine gets access to Reflect and Light Screen; it's hard to fit them in, but they can be a surprise for your opponent. Toxic is a decent way to cripple Rotom-W switch-ins. Rock Slide can be used as a way to hit Rotom-H and Mega Charizard Y, but sadly, Mamoswine is outsped by both threats, and Rotom-H might just cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Lum Berry isn't as useful as it is on most physical attackers since Rotom-W will usually go for a Hydro Pump. However, Mamoswine can use a Lum Berry with Icicle Spear to avoid Smeargle's Dark Void and have a shot at OHKOing Smeargle through its Focus Sash.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rotom-W</strong>: Rotom-W is Mamoswine's biggest counter. It's immune to Earthquake, resists Icicle Crash, and can OHKO with Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-H</strong>: Similarly to Rotom-W, Rotom-H resists Mamoswine's STAB moves and can burn Mamoswine with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Intimidate in general severely hampers Mamoswine's effectiveness; for example, Intimidate from Salamence gives it the opportunity to live an Ice Shard from Adamant Life Orb Mamoswine. Gyarados takes neutral damage from Icicle Crash and can smash Mamoswine with Waterfall. Scrafty's Intimidate and STAB Drain Punch can be very troublesome for Mamoswine.</p> <p><strong>Mega Charizard Y</strong>: Mega Charizard Y can outspeed Mamoswine and OHKO it with a STAB, sun-boosted Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Ludicolo</strong>: Unlike other Grass-types, Ludicolo isn't weak to Ice Shard, and it can outspeed and OHKO Mamoswine in the rain. In a similar manner, Kingdra can usually outspeed and slam Mamoswine with Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Conkeldurr and Scizor can hit Mamoswine hard with their STAB, super effective priority moves before it can Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room</strong>: Although Mamoswine isn't fast, it can have problems with Trick Room teams, as Mega Mawile, a common Trick Room threat, will easily OHKO it with Iron Head.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Shard is Mamoswine's trump card, allowing it to OHKO Garchomp and Salamence before they even have the chance to move. It's also great for picking off weakened foes. Earthquake is a powerful spread move that goes well with Mamoswine's Ice STAB, slamming foes like Mega Mawile and Tyranitar. Icicle Crash is Mamoswine's secondary Ice-type STAB attack; it's great for smashing Amoonguss, hitting Earthquake immunities, and for when Mamoswine's partner can't afford to use Protect or get hit by Earthquake. Icicle Spear is less reliable than Icicle Crash due to its multi-hit nature, but it can break through Focus Sash on Pokemon like Garchomp. Protect is Mamoswine's way of avoiding deadly attacks and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EV spread allows Mamoswine to outspeed 4 Speed Rotom-W, giving it a chance of taking out a weakened one. Mamoswine has plenty of options for items. Life Orb is among the best as it lets Mamoswine snipe more Pokemon with Ice Shard. It also allows Mamoswine to always OHKO Amoonguss with Icicle Crash and OHKO Salamence after Intimidate 81.3% of the time. If you are willing to trade KOs for longevity, go with Focus Sash; it allows Mamoswine to comfortably run more Speed instead of bulk. If you want a compromise between power and longevity, consider Expert Belt or Never-Melt Ice. The KOs aren't as appealing as Life Orb, but the lack of recoil can be a life saver in tight situations.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mamoswine's biggest targets are Salamence and Garchomp, and to a lesser extent, Amoonguss. However, it doesn't have to charge on with the Ice attacks right away. You can use the offensive pressure Mamoswine provides to predict a Protect or switch to your benefit. For example, it can attack the other target instead of Garchomp or Salamence, or have its other teammate hit a predicted switch-in. While Mamoswine can be a good lead to pressure Salamence and Garchomp, consider saving it for later in the match. Mamoswine can be at its deadliest when your opponent's team is worn down and ready to be sniped by Ice Shard and counters such as Rotom-W have fainted. Using Mamoswine later in the match also makes it less likely to be crippled by Intimidate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-W is Mamoswine's arch nemesis, so make sure your team can handle it. A good approach is to carry some Grass-types. Good examples include Lum Berry Ferrothorn, Venusaur, and Ludicolo. Mega Charizard Y can also be an issue with its powerful Solar Beam; fast Rock Slide users such as Garchomp are generally good answers to this. Mamoswine can be extra deadly when the team is worn down, so Fake Out users like Mega Kangaskhan and Scrafty, as well as residual damage from Tyranitar's Sand Stream, can do a good job of getting Pokemon in the KO range of Ice Shard. Assault Vest Ludicolo gets special mention for its Earthquake resistance, which can be handy in emergencies when Mamoswine has to use Earthquake. Always consider a Ground-immune Pokemon that can provide additional support to pair with Mamoswine, which can then use its deadly Earthquake more easily. Rotom-W can provide attack control with Will-O-Wisp and Light Screen and beat Gyarados; (semi-colon) Talonflame can provide Tailwind support and defeat Ludicolo; Salamence can soften physical attacks with Intimidate; and Mega Charizard Y can severely damage Rotom-W and Ludicolo, as well as other Mega Charizard Y if it's carrying Ancient Power.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W is one of the best Pokemon in VGC due to its amazing Electric / Water typing and ability Levitate, which gives it resistances to Fire, Flying, Ice, Water, Steel, and an immunity to Ground. Rotom-W counters multiple threats in VGC, such as Talonflame and Gyarados, and can burn Mega Mawile and Mega Kangaskhan. Its Electric- and Water-type STAB moves allow Rotom-W to hit multiple targets for big damage. Rotom-W has a fantastic movepool, which includes the extremely useful Will-O-Wisp, and works well on different playstyles to patch up your team's weaknesses. Unfortunately, Rotom-W's low HP hinders its reasonable defenses, and it's walled by Grass-types, so every competent team will have a plan to deal with Rotom-W.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Volt Switch can be used to safely bring in allies on a predicted switch. Choice Specs and Trick can be used to heavily damage opposing Pokemon and to cripple foes by giving them a Choice item, respectively. Hidden Power Ice allows Rotom-W to hit Dragon-type Pokemon such as Salamence and Garchomp hard. Discharge has less power than Thunderbolt, but has a 30% chance to paralyze and hits every Pokemon on the field. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple fast offensive Pokemon. Safety Goggles makes Rotom-W immune to Rage Powder and Spore.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Venusaur, Rotom-C, and Amoonguss can take Thunderbolt and Hydro Pump and then retaliate with their special Grass-type attacks; they don't mind Will-O-Wisp, either, as they are specially offensive. Pokemon that don't enjoy being burned, such as Ferrothorn, can carry a Lum Berry, however, and in Ferrothorn's case, OHKO Rotom-W with Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Double Targeting</strong>: Rotom-W can be KOed if both foes attack it with big hits, such as Mega Kangaskhan's Return, in one turn. There is the risk, however, of Rotom-W going for Protect, wasting that turn and allowing Rotom-W's ally to do damage or set up.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with good Special Defense that don't mind taking a Will-O-Wisp, such as Hydreigon and Gardevoir, can deal with Rotom-W well. Goodra is a reliable check to Rotom-W, as it resists Water and Electric and is a special attacker.</p> <p><strong>Fast Grass-type Attacks</strong>: Attacks such as Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam can OHKO Rotom-W if it doesn't invest enough EVs in the respective defensive stat.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Pokemon such as Excadrill and Mega Gyarados can't switch in against Rotom-W but can check it because Mold Breaker ignores Levitate, which allows their Earthquake to easily OHKO Rotom-W.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is a reliable STAB attack and hits opposing Water- and Flying-type Pokemon. Hydro Pump is less reliable due to its accuracy, but it's more powerful than Thunderbolt. Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-W cripple physical attackers and do something to Grass-types that resist Thunderbolt and Hydro Pump. Protect confers decent utility upon Rotom-W by letting it scout and avoid getting hit by multi-hit attacks. Light Screen or Reflect can give Rotom-W's team additional support if Protect isn't worth it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given HP and Special Defense EVs allow Rotom-W to survive Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam from full health, and Rotom-W can get back to a comfortable health range with its Sitrus Berry. The EVs in Defense allow Rotom-W to survive Mega Mawile's maximum Attack Play Rough. One point is invested in Speed because level 50 EV investment leaves Rotom-W with one free point. The rest of the EVs are invested in Special Attack to dish out harder hits with Thunderbolt and Hydro Pump. Speed creep is highly recommended with Rotom-W to win against opposing Rotom-W, but how much is up to you; when choosing how many extra EVs go to Speed, detract them from Special Attack first. If Rotom-W needs more power, switching to a Modest nature and taking EVs out of Special Defense to put into Special Attack is a viable option.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-W can switch in to start spreading burns with Will-O-Wisp and deal decent damage to any foe that doesn't resist its STAB moves. Rotom-W doesn't necessarily need to switch out at a particular part of the game, though reserving it to switch it into a move it resists is really useful. When in doubt, Rotom-W should use Will-O-Wisp, as its targets will likely predict a STAB move, so it'll entice obvious switches.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most Pokemon appreciate Rotom-W's support. Talonflame makes a great partner, as its ability allows it to pick off Grass-type Pokemon that Rotom-W struggles with, such as Amoonguss. Fake Out users, such as Mega Kangaskhan, can give Rotom-W an extra turn to burn a foe. Earthquake users without Mold Breaker can spam Earthquake without having to worry about damaging Rotom-W. Pokemon that enjoy Rotom-W's resistances to Flying, Ground, Water, Ice, and Fire make great partners.</p>"

If that wasn't enough, Conkeldurr is not allowed to have the elemental punches due to this season's ruleset. And if all Conkeldurr hadn't been cowering in fear already, they now are with the introduction of Talonflame. Despite all of this, Conkeldurr did gain a nice item in Assault Vest, helping to remedy Conkeldurr's mediocre Special Defense. Conkeldurr does still have many strong points that make it a fearsome sweeper. Base 140 Attack is nothing to overlook and when paired with 105 / 95 / 65 bulk, priority in Mach Punch, two great abilities suiting Conkeldurr's movepool, and reliable recovery in Drain Punch, Conkeldurr will get the job done. When all is taken into account, Conkeldurr is an offensive powerhouse in VGC.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Coba Berry can be used to allow Conkeldurr to survive a Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird at full health, but due to double targeting, this is not a popular choice. Brick Break can be used as it gains the STAB boost and breaks Reflect and Light Screen, but generally isn't used due to having a lower Base Power than other choices. Earthquake can be used as a spread move to take care of Pokemon like Aegislash, but due to Conkeldurr's high Attack, its teammate would take high damage. A Black Belt can be used to boost Fighting-type moves without losing health. Payback can be used as Conkeldurr is likely to move last, but it isn't worth the moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Talonflame OHKOes Conkeldurr with Brave Bird unless the held item is a Coba Berry, which is unlikely.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Like most physical attackers, the drop in Attack that Intimidate carries can be the difference between an OHKO or 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Gardevoir</strong>: Gardevoir does not fear anything that Conkeldurr can throw at it, bar the occasional Poison Jab, and can OHKO back with either a Fairy-type or Psychic-type STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash</strong>: The only real worry is that Conkeldurr has Payback, but this can be easily avoided with King's Shield. Although this is less likely, Aegislash might have to be wary of Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set is almost identical from last season, except Rock Slide is used for coverage instead of Ice Punch. With Rock Slide, Conkeldurr can now take out Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, if it can tank a hit from them. Mach Punch is used as a strong priority STAB move. Drain Punch is another strong STAB move that allows Conkeldurr to heal itself. Detect can be used to stall a turn out, a standard move in VGC. If you do not wish to go for Detect, you can also opt for Wide Guard in order to block the ever-so-common spread moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Conkeldurr has two options for the item slot this season. A Persim Berry will deal with any Swagger users that might be running amok, while Leftovers is a solid item for recovery each turn. The chosen ability is Guts because Will-O-Wisp now has a higher accuracy and is more commonly seen. Because of this, opponents will think twice before using it on Conkeldurr. This EV spread is used to maximize damage output while increasing overall bulk. Therefore, full investment in Attack and HP is chosen, with the last 4 points going into Special Defense. Lastly, Adamant is the nature of choice as it increases Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Conkeldurr is relatively straightforward in how it is to be played. First, make sure counters such as Talonflame are out of the way. After that, Conkeldurr should be free to go in thanks to its bulk and ability to regain health with Drain Punch. With Mach Punch, Conkeldurr is able to clean up or even completely take out Pokemon before they get the chance to attack. The only thing to really be wary of is Conkeldurr being double targeted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This standard set has a few team options that stand out. Scizor is a fantastic teammate for Conkeldurr because when two immensely strong priority moves are put together, the rate at which damage is coming out will be high. Another good teammate for Conkeldurr is Bisharp, as Conkeldurr doesn't have a way to deal with Intimidate. In addition to that, Bisharp has a nice STAB priority move in Sucker Punch. Lastly, Conkeldurr benefits from Rage Powder support given by Amoonguss. One Rage Powder can give Conkeldurr the chance to take out Talonflame.</p>"

Drain Punch is still an option but Hammer Arm fits better in a Trick Room set because it has a higher Base Power, is still boosted by Iron Fist, and lowers Speed even more. Drain Punch is still a good choice because it is a reliable form of recovery. Rock Slide is used for coverage against Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and other Flying-types. The last slot has two viable options. Poison Jab can help take care of Fairy-types while Detect is still a good move to stall turns out, which is useful when Trick Room needs to be set up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>There are two great item choices for this set. Life Orb increases damage output while Assault Vest can add survivability on the special side. Iron Fist is the chosen ability in order to boost Mach Punch as well as Drain Punch. However, this does make burns more of a worry. The EVs give Conkeldurr maximized Attack as well as added bulk. A Brave nature boosts Attack while lowering Speed, which is ideal for a Trick Room. 0 IVs in Speed will lower Speed even more.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Conkeldurr is a great revenge killer thanks to Mach Punch, so take advantage of that. Because its low Speed makes it move first, Conkeldurr becomes a fearsome sweeper, so make sure that when Trick Room is up, Conkeldurr will keep on attacking. The turn you set up Trick Room, make sure Conkeldurr uses Detect, granted you choose to run it. Make sure that Conkeldurr's counters are out of the way before bringing it in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to the fact that Trick Room is a huge part of this set, Conkeldurr's list of team options increases. Slowking is great as it can take care of Talonflame and set up Trick Room. Escavalier is another good Trick Room sweeper. Bisharp can keep Psychic-types at bay and has a STAB priority move. Amoonguss brings Rage Powder support and also benefits from the effects of Trick Room. Lastly, Aromatisse is a tanky Fairy-type that brings Trick Room and can support with Heal Pulse.</p>"

  "Scrafty": {
    "overview": "<p>This generation has been a mixed blessing for Scrafty. On one hand, Scrafty can now use Assault Vest, which greatly increases its defensive capabilities. This, combined with the fact that it is one of the only Intimidate Pokemon that has access to Fake Out, makes it a premier choice for stalling out setup sweepers, early- or late-game. However, there is one thing that has been introduced which severely hurts Scrafty: the Fairy type. Fairy-type Pokemon and moves are able to hit Scrafty for 4x super effective damage, and it can't do much back at them considering its lackluster offenses. Nevertheless, Scrafty should not be taken lightly, for it's still one of the best anti-lead Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Sitrus Berry is useful in prolonging Scrafty's lifespan, but Drain Punch heals plenty of damage already, and the times that Sitrus Berry does activate, it is usually too late to take effect. A Roseli Berry can mitigate the Fairy weakness, but many Fairies and Fairy-type moves would still KO Scrafty. Instead of Intimidate, Scrafty can run Shed Skin in order to manually clear itself of unwanted status. This is not recommended, as Scrafty is not intended to be a setup sweeper. Being afflicted with status will have no effect upon Intimidate or Fake Out's purpose. Moxie can be used to increase Scrafty's power, but it is generally inferior for the aforementioned reasons. Instead of running Drain Punch, High Jump Kick can be used for nabbing the OHKO on Mega Kangaskhan not invested in HP, as most of them lack Protect. Take caution when doing this, because with a shaky 90 accuracy, one miss might end you. Finally, Taunt can shut down support Pokemon and force Aegislash to switch out. That does, however, mean that Scrafty loses out on coverage moves and Protect</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: With its 4x weakness to Fairy-types, Pokemon such as Azumarill, Mawile, and Gardevoir can easily KO Scrafty in one hit, even when it is sporting an Assault Vest.</p> <p><strong>Conkeldurr</strong>: Conkeldurr is bulky enough to take a hit and strong enough to deal huge amounts of damage with Hammer Arm. It can then finish Scrafty off with Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Gyarados</strong>: Gyarados can spam Waterfall, and Scrafty isn't able to do much in return unless it runs Thunder Punch, which isn't recommended. Mega Gyarados, however, is not as problematic, since its typing changes entirely into Scrafty's favor.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: With priority Flying-type moves, Talonflame can easily 2HKO Scrafty after an Intimidate, and it doesn't take much damage from its coverage moves either.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate</strong>: Will-O-Wisp and opposing Intimidate, as well as any other move or ability that lower Scrafty's Attack, greatly hinder its offensive capabilities.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Fake Out": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This move lineup takes the best Scrafty has to offer and puts it all together for a nice Fake Out set. Fake Out is very useful at temporarily postponing the opponent's attempts to set up during the first turn, as well as stalling out passive damage from status and weather. Drain Punch is the primary STAB of choice, helping Scrafty prolong its lifespan while still dealing respectable damage. If a Fighting-type move is not the most optimal choice to use, Crunch is the secondary STAB that can hit Ghost- and Psychic-types.</p> <p>The last moveslot is down to what you prefer and/or what your team needs. Detect is the protection of choice, as it shields Scrafty from damage while is also able to escape many attempts at Imprisonment. If protection is not a concern, Ice Punch is the elemental punch of choice, covering Scrafty's Flying-type weakness and giving it nice overall coverage. Stone Edge can be used for handling Talonflame and Mega Charizard if they are a major concern. Lastly, Quick Guard is useful for blocking Talonflame's priority Brave Bird, although it doesn't have much use besides that.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV investment is fairly straightforward. Scrafty is fairly slow, and investing in Speed won't allow it to reach any significantly higher speed tiers; therefore, there is no need to invest in Speed. Most of the EVs therefore go into Scrafty's HP and Attack. However, there are also 12 EVs invested into Defense. This is to ensure that Scrafty can survive a Brave Bird from max Attack Choice Band Talonflame after an Intimidate. A Brave nature can also be used if you intend to run a Trick Room-oriented team.</p> <p>The choice of item largely depends on what is necessary for your team. A Lum Berry can help against the burns that limit Scrafty's power, and it is also a great answer to Smeargle. However, if status is not a problem, Assault Vest is a viable alternative for expanding Scrafty's special bulk. Keep in mind that running Assault Vest sacrifices the ability to use Detect.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scrafty, as the set name implies, excels at hindering the opponents with Intimidate and Fake Out. Therefore, using the aforementioned two correctly is strongly advised. It is important to know when to use Scrafty as an Intimidate lead and when to use it as a backup plan for physical sweepers. If you are anticipating one of the opponent's Pokemon to pack its own Fake Out, don't send out Scrafty first. The opponent will target Scrafty, and you will lose the Fake Out war due to Scrafty's low Speed. Likewise, it is important to know exactly which Pokemon should be held back with Fake Out. One wrong prediction, and Scrafty is essentially running only three moves until it switches out. Speaking of switching out, Scrafty can be switched in and out of battle multiple times if need be. This is especially useful if you want to use Intimidate and/or Fake Out multiple times.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scrafty is a naturally slow Pokemon, sitting at a below-average base 50 Speed, and thus Trick Room is a viable strategy to run. Pokemon that use it well include Aromatisse, Reuniclus, and Slowbro. Scrafty does not have the desired sky-high offenses, so Pokemon that can remedy this with high offenses of their own and benefit from Fake Out and Intimidate also make for excellent partners, with Mega Charizard Y, Mega Kangaskhan, and Choice Gardevoir being notable examples. Finally, Aegislash deserves a special mention, as it resists all of Scrafty's weaknesses and hits hard in return, while Scrafty covers its Dark and Ghost weaknesses.</p>"

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Aegislash and Tyranitar's prominence, Reuniclus's life in VGC14 is definitely not easy. Reuniclus can be compared to Aromatisse; they have similar bulk, and both are Trick Room setters. However, Aromatisse was blessed with two gifts in the form of its Fairy typing, an incredible defensive typing in this metagame, and Aroma Veil, which protects its allies from being Taunted or Encored. However, Reuniclus has its advantages over Aromatisse: namely, its greater raw power and Magic Guard. With Magic Guard, Reuniclus can use Life Orb without losing HP, as it becomes immune to any form of residual damage. Reuniclus has a ton of utility options as well, such as Helping Hand, Thunder Wave, Reflect, Light Screen, and some useful coverage moves such as Energy Ball and Shadow Ball. However, while Reuniclus's power is nothing to laugh at, it can sometimes miss out on some important OHKOs and 2HKOs, and it has a disappointing typing, both offensively and defensively. Reuniclus also lacks spread and priority moves. While it does have decent bulk, it can't take most STAB or super effective moves very well. Finally, it can be Taunted or Encored, unlike Aromatisse, and its poor Speed stat has no real use outside of Trick Room.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Reuniclus's movepool hasn't really got many other options. Snatch can be used to steal the effect of an opposing Pokemon's move. Focus Blast is a powerful option for the Life Orb set, but Reuniclus definitely doesn't like its low accuracy, as VGC is just too fast-paced to afford a miss. Additionally, the only notable target that is hit by Focus Blast is Tyranitar; almost everything else could be hit by Shadow Ball, Energy Ball, or Hidden Power Fire. Recover is an option, but in this fast-paced metagame Reuniclus will rarely be able to use it. Trick + Flame Orb is an interesting option that cripples a physical attacker and protects Reuniclus from status. Finally, Thunder is an option when Reuniclus is paired up with Politoed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore</strong>: Most Taunt and Encore users are faster than Reuniclus, so they can easily prevent it from setting up Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Aegislash is a notable Steel-type to really watch out for. If Reuniclus uses Shadow Ball on it, it may activate its Weakness Policy, which boosts Aegislash's offensive stats to insane levels. Aegislash can also make the most of Trick Room because it's quite slow. Other Steel-types that threaten Reuniclus include Bisharp and Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar and Hydreigon are immune to Reuniclus's STAB attacks and have powerful super effective moves to KO it with.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types, such as Aegislash and Gengar, have very powerful super effective moves to use against Reuniclus, but most of them, bar Aegislash, are frail and can't tank a Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority attacks such as Fake Out and Sucker Punch negate Trick Room, leaving it without effect.</p>",

      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room allows Reuniclus to outspeed most threats while active. It can also benefit a slow ally. Psychic is the main STAB move because it has higher power than Psyshock and hits both Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur hard. Psyshock, however, hits special walls such as Goodra and Florges harder, while dealing more damage to Amoonguss than Psychic. Shadow Ball offers good neutral coverage and hits Aegislash and Gardevoir. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferrothorn and Bisharp most notably, which resist Reuniclus's other attacks. Energy Ball hits Rotom-W, Azumarill, and Tyranitar, though Reuniclus is usually going to lose to the latter. Protect fills in the last moveslot because it's simply a great asset in VGC, as it helps scout the opponent as well as protect Reuniclus from any attack.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread gives more balance to Reuniclus's overall bulk than 252 HP EVs could. The remaining EVs are used to maximize Reuniclus's power. Life Orb increases its damage output even further, while Magic Guard negates Life Orb recoil and any other residual damage, such as that inflicted by sandstorm, whereas Overcoat still avoids sandstorm damage while making Amoonguss's Spore and Venusaur's Sleep Powder useless. The given nature and IVs guarantee that Reuniclus is as slow as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Trick Room is the most important aspect of this set, use it as soon as Reuniclus gets into battle. This Reuniclus is designed to wallbreak; it's not a sweeper, so don't let it take unnecessary hits and get KOed. This set requires team support to work well, as many common threats in VGC14 easily deal with Reuniclus. You can also send Reuniclus into battle after all Taunt users have been KOed or put under too much pressure to use it. Also, when needed, use Protect on the first turn so Reuniclus won't be hit by Fake Out. Switch Reuniclus in against moves such as Leech Seed, as switching Reuniclus in is simply too difficult otherwise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The first thing you should think of when considering a teammate for Reuniclus is a slow Pokemon, such as Amoonguss, Azumarill, or Mega Mawile. Fighting-types such as Scrafty are great teammates because they threaten the Dark-types that threaten Reuniclus. Scrafty also has Intimidate and Quick Guard, so it can lessen the damage output of Fake Out, or totally stop it, and Scrafty itself has Fake Out as well, stopping any potential Taunt user from hindering Reuniclus. Azumarill and Mega Mawile can also beat Dark-types. Another Trick Room setter is a good idea for a partner; Aromatisse is a good option, as its Aroma Veil prevents Reuniclus from being Taunted.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room allows Reuniclus and other slow teammates to move first in most situations. Psychic is preferred for its higher power, while Psyshock can be used to hit special walls much harder. Helping Hand is a support move that increases the power of an ally's move by 50%. The last moveslot can be used for more coverage in the form of Shadow Ball or for one of the screen moves, which help Reuniclus and allies take hits better. The choice of screen depends on your team's needs.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread balances Reuniclus's defenses so it can survive common attacks such as Tyranitar's Crunch and Aegislash's Shadow Ball and proceed to set up Trick Room. Sitrus Berry is the common choice for a recovery item in a fast-paced metagame such as VGC. Mental Herb can be used to stop moves such as Taunt and Encore and guarantee that Trick Room will be set up. Magic Guard keeps Reuniclus safe from any residual damage while Overcoat keeps it safe from Amoonguss's Spore and Venusaur's Sleep Powder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Remember that Helping Hand has increased priority; it doesn't need Trick Room to go up first. Also, if Reuniclus is running Reflect or Light Screen, set up Trick Room before either of those; in most circumstances, Reuniclus's partner probably will benefit more from Trick Room than they would from a screen whose duration is not boosted by Light Clay.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any slow Pokemon can benefit from Reuniclus's Trick Room. Frailer Pokemon could be used as teammates, as a screen helps mitigate their frailty. A teammate that can take care of Dark-types, such as Scrafty or Azumarill, is a necessity. Aromatisse is a good teammate, as its ability protects Reuniclus from Taunt and it takes advantage of Trick Room's effects.</p>"

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is a great support Pokemon due to its access to Rage Powder, which directs all foes' attacks at itself, and Spore, which puts the target to sleep. Amoonguss is able to shut down some of the best Pokemon in the tier, such as Rotom-W. However, many Pokemon in the tier can destroy Amoonguss, such as Rotom-H, Charizard, and Talonflame. Amoonguss has a weak offensive presence and multiple effects were added in XY that weaken Amoonguss's effectiveness, such as Grass-types' immunity to Spore and the introduction of Safety Goggles, which prevent the holder from being affected by powder moves and weather.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There are multiple other options that Amoonguss can use, such as Sludge Bomb, a reliable Poison-type STAB move which hits Grass-types and has a 30% chance to poison the target. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel-types such as Ferrothorn. Rest lets Amoonguss recover HP and rid itself of unwanted status. Coba and Occa Berry can be used to lessen the damage of Flying- and Fire-type attacks, respectively, which threaten Amoonguss. Synthesis provides a means of gaining back HP without having to switch out and can be useful in conjunction with Rage Powder when Amoonguss is continually taking hits. Energy Ball hits harder than Giga Drain and has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense; however, it does not heal Amoonguss. Hidden Power Ice hits Dragon-types harder than Amoonguss's other moves. Lastly, Clear Smog can prevent foes from setting up against Amoonguss, as it resets the target's stat boosts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Safety Goggles</strong>: Safety Goggles prevents the holder from being affected by Spore and Rage Powder, therefore allowing them to attack freely. This can cause problems for Amoonguss, as any Pokemon can run this item, and it can waste a turn when you don't expect a foe to be running it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt prevents Amoonguss from using Rage Powder, Spore, and Protect, locking it into only Giga Drain or forcing it to switch out. This prevents Amoonguss from supporting its allies.</p> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry lets foes take a Spore, giving the opponent one more free turn which it can use to hit Amoonguss or its ally.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Super effective attacks from Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Rotom-H hit Amoonguss hard and perhaps even OHKO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore puts the target to sleep and gives Amoonguss's ally leeway to set up or attack. Rage Powder redirects foes' attacks towards Amoonguss so its ally can attack or set up without getting hit unless it is a multi-hit attack. Giga Drain is a reliable STAB move which inflicts direct damage and helps against Water-types such as Rotom-W and Politoed. Protect keeps Amoonguss safe from its ally's spread attacks, buys time for Amoonguss to gain back some recovery from Black Sludge, and scouts attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Regenerator allows Amoonguss to heal back damage taken from attacks after using Rage Powder when it switches out, allowing it to switch in again later to rinse and repeat. Effect Spore is also an option if Amoonguss is primarily focusing on taking advantage of Rage Powder thereby giving Amoonguss's ally freedom to attack. However, Effect Spore is risky if Amoonguss goes for Spore a lot, as it could waste a turn if the foe gets paralyzed or poisoned because of it on the turn Amoonguss uses Spore. The given EVs allow for maximum overall bulk and a Calm nature allows Amoonguss to outspeed Pokemon that are equipped to operate in Trick Room while still being slow at the same time. A Sassy nature can be used instead, as it allows Amoonguss to minimize its Speed and therefore to go first against almost everything under Trick Room.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Amoonguss is very useful early-game when it can switch in and out to regain health with Regenerator. If Amoonguss's ally is a Fake Out user, the procedure is to have it use Fake Out, have Amoonguss use Spore on the foe which wasn't hit by Fake Out, and have Amoonguss use Spore on the other foe the next turn. Rage Powder should be used when the ally wants to either set up or to receive protection from moves such as Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave. Effect Spore helps with Mega Kangaskhan, whose ability, Parental Bond, gives it double the chance of getting statused.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Amoonguss works well with multiple Pokemon; however, it should avoid having an ally that is weak to Fire-type moves, such as Heat Wave. Kangaskhan is an amazing ally for Amoonguss, as its Fake Out lets Amoonguss use Spore with great comfort and Rage Powder prevents Fighting-type attacks, which Amoonguss resists, from hitting Mega Kangaskhan as it uses Power-Up Punch to raise its Attack by two stages. Rotom-W and Talonflame appreciate Amoonguss's ability to take Grass-, Electric-, and Water-type attacks for them. Trick Room users such as Aromatisse allow Amoonguss to go first and work even more effectively. Amoonguss's ally should make up for Amoonguss's lack of offensive presence.</p>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn has high defenses along with a fantastic defensive typing that grants it nine resistances and one immunity, allowing it to be one of the most capable walls in VGC. Ferrothorn's typing also gives it immunity to Spore and Sleep Powder and lets it take on Fairy-types. Ferrothorn's fairly high Attack stat allows it to hit with its powerful STAB moves, Gyro Ball and Power Whip, the latter having the capability to OHKO Rotom-W on the switch, though Ferrothorn does have to watch out for a burn. Ferrothorn's horrid Fire-type weakness is exploited by common threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame. Furthermore, Ferrothorn faces competition from Mega Mawile as a defensive Steel-type and from Amoonguss and Gourgeist as a bulky Grass-type.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rocky Helmet stacks with Iron Barbs and punishes physical attackers a great deal, though Ferrothorn prefers a defensive item. Sitrus Berry could also be used as an additional method of healing. However, it is usually more practical on a Pokemon such as Rotom-A because Ferrothorn really appreciates immunity to burns. A set of Thunder Wave / Leech Seed / Iron Head / Protect with a spread of 252 HP / 132 Atk / 108 Def / 4 SpD / 12 Spe with Leftovers lets Ferrothorn OHKO Gardevoir with Iron Head and survive two of Mega Mawile's Fire Fangs 81% of the time. Iron Head can be used for consistency, but Gyro Ball is all-around more powerful. Seed Bomb is more accurate than Power Whip but lacks power. Rest can be used for instant recovery and status relief, but it is unreliable because special Fire-type STAB moves OHKO Ferrothorn anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Super Effective Moves</strong>: Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-H, and Chandelure can easily OHKO Ferrothorn with their STAB moves. Fire-type coverage moves from the likes of Salamence and Hydreigon are also troublesome.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Other Steel-types such as Aegislash and Mawile do not mind Ferrothorn's STAB moves and some can even set up Substitutes to shield themselves from Leech Seed. Mawile can also hurt Ferrothorn's effectiveness via Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate Users</strong>: Salamence, Scrafty, and Mega Manectric all lower Ferrothorn's Attack stat and carry super effective moves to hit Ferrothorn hard.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Will-O-Wisp from other Grass-types such as Gourgeist and Trevenant slowly wears Ferrothorn down and neuters its Attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Power Whip is Ferrothorn's strongest STAB, KOing Rotom-W on the switch in. Gyro Ball hits incredibly powerfully thanks to Ferrothorn's pitiful Speed; it does have unimpressive coverage, however. Thunder Wave is able to cripple the majority of the fast-paced metagame. As a side note, never run Thunder Wave alongside Gyro Ball, because it reduces Gyro Ball's power. Substitute allows Ferrothorn to pull off SubSeed shenanigans and works well because of Ferrothorn's solid resistances. Leech Seed slowly wears down the foe, provides Ferrothorn with a source of recovery, and works well in tandem with Protect, which can scout for moves and accumulate Leech Seed damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EV investment is needed to make full use of Ferrothorn's base 76 HP. 204 Attack EVs and a Brave nature allow it to OHKO Rotom-W with Power Whip. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense to patch up Ferrothorn's lower defense. 0 Speed IVs allow Ferrothorn to maximize Gyro Ball's power and underspeed other Pokemon when Trick Room is set. Lum Berry shields Ferrothorn from Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp or cures sleep from Smeargle's Dark Void once. However, Rocky Helmet is also useful to severely annoy physical attackers, mainly Kangaskhan. One can run a more defensive spread with a Sassy or Relaxed nature. In addition, one can use 12 Speed EVs to allow Ferrothorn to outspeed paralyzed base 100 Speed Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ferrothorn should be switched in on moves that it resists, such as Mega Kangaskhan's Return or a Choice-locked Draco Meteor. Unfortunately, Ferrothorn's STAB combination is resisted by a plethora of Pokemon, so Leech Seed is generally the preferred move. It is smart to save Ferrothorn for the end of the match because an opponent can potentially be out of super effective moves by then, thus making Ferrothorn a win condition. Ferrothorn is really only OHKOed by Fire-type moves, so keep it away from them at all costs!</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ferrothorn appreciates Pokemon that resist its Fire-type weakness, such as Salamence and Gyarados, which also provide Intimidate support. Dragon-types such as Garchomp and the aforementioned Salamence appreciate Ferrothorn's Dragon- and Fairy-type resistances. Talonflame has fantastic synergy with Ferrothorn and beats Fighting-types that threaten Ferrothorn. Politoed resists Fire-type moves and weakens their power via Drizzle. Rotom-W also resists Fire-type moves, and it has access to Will-O-Wisp to burn Fighting-types. Gothitelle makes for a good partner because it can trap Pokemon that lack a Fire-type move and make it difficult for them to break through Ferrothorn. Trick Room support from the likes of Chandelure allows Ferrothorn to go first thanks to its low Speed.</p>"

Hex is a nice move for both sets, especially if you have a Prankster user that can spread status, such as Meowstic. Trick Room + Imprison is a nice counter to dedicated Trick Room teams.

Shadow Ball is Chandelure's strongest STAB move against a single target, though. Will-O-Wisp is used for inflicting burns and lowering the power of physical attackers that threaten Chandelure, such as Garchomp. Substitute is an alternative to Will-O-Wisp that helps Chandelure avoid damage and status. It is also great to use because Chandelure can practically get one up for free on arguably the 3 best Mega Evolutions in the metagame: Kangaskhan, Mawile, and Charizard Y, with all of its immunities. Trick Room is the last alternative to Will-O-Wisp, and if Chandelure is running it, give Chandelure 0 Speed IVs, run a Quiet nature, and move the Speed EVs to HP. Protect allows Chandelure to avoid taking damage from attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature is used to maximize Chandelure's Special Attack stat. Max investment in Speed and Special Attack is to hit hard and fast. Focus Sash gives Chandelure one guaranteed attack and sometimes even more. Flash Fire is better than Infiltrator, as it gives Chandelure an immunity to Fire-type moves so they don't break Chandelure's Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure to use Protect when necessary, such as when you know a spread move is coming. If Flash Fire is Chandelure's ability, use it to absorb Fire-type moves for Pokemon that have a weakness to the type, such as Ferrothorn and Scizor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Some of the best teammates for this set are Pokemon that enjoy Fire-type coverage, such as Mawile and Amoonguss. It also likes Pokemon that can avoid Ground-type moves, such as Rotom-W and Talonflame. Pokemon that have access to Wide Guard, such as Aegislash and Mienshao, also make for great partners. Lastly, if you are using Trick Room, then other slow Pokemon that can benefit from Trick Room, such as Ferrothorn and Reuniclus, would be good partners for Chandelure.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Overheat is Chandelure's main move on this set, as it can OHKO almost every non-bulky Pokemon that does not resist it, such as Mega Gengar and Klefki. However, it lowers Chandelure's Special Attack by two stages. Shadow Ball Chandelure's strongest Ghost-type STAB move and has no downsides. Heat Wave is a STAB spread move that is great for bypassing Protect and chipping the health of multiple opposing Pokemon. Energy Ball provides Chandelure with coverage against Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon, whose STAB moves deal super effective damage to Chandelure. Hidden Power Ice is an alternative to Energy Ball that covers Chandelure's Ground-type weakness, even though Shadow Ball does just as much damage to them, as well as hits Dragon-types, which resist its Fire-type STAB moves. Hidden Power Ice is great for surprise KOs on Garchomp and Salamence.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Either Flash Fire or Infiltrator can be used on this set, as both are efficient. Flash Fire gives Chandelure an immunity to Fire-type moves and boosts Chandelure's own if Chandelure is hit by one, while Infiltrator allows Chandelure's attacks to go right through Substitutes and dual screens. Maximum investment in Speed and Special Attack allows Chandelure to hit hard and fast. A Timid nature is necessary, as it allows Chandelure to outspeed most Pokemon when coupled with a Choice Scarf.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf, Chandelure is a sitting duck for Sucker Punch. Also look out for rain, which endangers Chandelure and weakens its Fire-type moves. You should make attacking frailer Pokemon a priority. As such, Chandelure's job is to take out fast attackers first, then bulkier Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Priority users, such as Meowstic, are good for taking out and crippling foe priority users. Pokemon that enjoy Chandelure's Flash Fire ability are bulky Grass- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn. Chandelure enjoys having bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, as teammates, as they can cover a lot of its weaknesses. Garchomp is a great teammate, as it can take out weather setters. Flying-type Pokemon, as well as Pokemon with Levitate, are good for avoiding Ground-type moves, which Chandelure is weak to. Chandelure absolutely loves Pokemon with access Wide Guard because it is weak to almost all spread moves.</p>"

  "Mienshao": {
    "overview": "<p>Mienshao has very good Attack and Speed, which makes it a dangerous Pokemon to come up against. Mienshao not only hits very hard, but also supports the team by using helpful status moves. However, Mienshao is very frail and has many checks and counters.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>U-turn is an option so Mienshao can scout the opponent's Pokemon and escape danger while doing a little damage. Life Orb is an option for Mienshao so it can do high damage to its targets. Reckless works great with High Jump Kick if you're trying to do huge amounts of damage. Taunt alongside Mienshao's Speed is another good option to avoid status moves such as Spore, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunder Wave. If you want to have a secure damaging attack, Feint is the way to go if you want to break through Protect, Detect, Wide Guard, Quick Guard, Spiky Shield, and King's Shield.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Mega Pinsir and Talonflame's priority attacks can easily OHKO Mienshao.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-types that can take any of Mienshao's attacks, such as Gothitelle and Reuniclus, are good checks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Aegislash is a huge counter to Mienshao because it takes little or no damage from all of Mienshao's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Sylveon, Aromatisse, and Florges can take Mienshao's STAB attacks and retaliate with their STAB Fairy attacks.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp and Protect</strong>: Especially from Prankster users, Will-O-Wisp can make Mienshao's Attack stat useless. Protect can get in the way of Mienshao's STAB High Jump Kick.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room</strong>: Trick Room makes Mienshao's good Speed a liability and makes Mienshao extremely vulnerable.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out is essential on any Mienshao set, as it plays a huge role in VGC. Fake Out almost always causes the foe to flinch, allowing your Pokemon to set up, avoid a dangerous attack, and get rid of Focus Sashes. High Jump Kick is one of Mienshao's preferred STAB moves due to its high damage output. However, a major flaw of this move is that Mienshao loses 50% of its HP if it misses or if the foe uses Protect. Low Sweep is the second best physical STAB attack because it has a 100% chance to lower the opposing Pokemon's Speed, which can be very useful for outspeeding Pokemon. Rock Slide provides great coverage against Flying-types, but Knock Off gives Mienshao a great way to attack Psychic- and Ghost-types. Removing the target's item as well is a great bonus. Quick Guard can be used to stop Talonflame's deadly priority STAB Flying-type attacks and other priority moves. Also, Pokemon with Prankster will be stopped by Quick Guard. If you're having trouble dealing with attacks that affect all the Pokemon in the field, such as Earthquake, Rock Slide, Discharge, Surf, or Boomburst, you can replace Quick Guard with Wide Guard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack and Speed EVs are used so Mienshao can hit as hard and fast as possible. 4 HP EVs are important because if Mienshao misses High Jump Kick two times without getting damaged, it will still have 1 HP remaining. Inner Focus works well to prevent Mienshao from getting flinched by Fake Out. Because Mienshao is so frail, it appreciates Focus Sash, which prevents it from being OHKOed by any attack. The nature is Jolly so Mienshao can outspeed anything below base 105 Speed, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This is a pretty standard offensive support set which allows Mienshao to hit hard and support the team as well. Focus Sash gives Mienshao a chance to take a free hit. Pokemon such as Garchomp, Zapdos, and Mega Charizard Y usually have spread moves, so keep Wide Guard in mind in these situations. Rock Slide and High Jump Kick allow Mienshao to KO Mega Charizard Y and Mega Kangaskhan, respectively. Mienshao can also help its teammates set up by using Fake Out on the first turn. Use Mienshao to check Bisharp, Mega Gyarados, Hydreigon, Liepard, Smeargle, Mega Charizard Y, Tyranitar, and Mega Kangaskhan for your team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mienshao works great as a lead and can give your team an early advantage with Fake Out so its teammates can set up or freely attack. Wide Guard and Quick Guard shield the team from multi-hit and priority attacks, respectively. Wide Guard helps Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y avoid Rock Slide, and Aegislash avoid Earthquake and Heat Wave. Quick Guard helps Pokemon that are weak to priority, such as Tyranitar against Mach Punch or Aegislash against Sucker Punch. If you need a fast physical attacker, Mienshao hits hard with its base 125 Attack and outspeeds many Pokemon with its base 105 Speed.</p>"

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<p>Bisharp is one of the premier Pokemon in the VGC 2014 format, and for good reason. For one, it is the only viable Pokemon this year that has the ability Defiant, which essentially reverses the effects of Intimidate, turning the -1 Attack drop from Intimidate into a +1 boost. A main reason to use Bisharp is because even if one does not choose it for a lead, it discourages the opponent from leading with an Intimidate Pokemon! Bisharp also boasts an impressive base 125 Attack, along with Dark- and Steel-type STAB, which in the VGC 2014 format is only resisted by Lucario, Houndoom, and ironically Bisharp. Finally, Bisharp carries two immunities to Psychic and Poison and resists several common types such as Ice, Ghost, Grass, Steel, and Rock. However, with all of Bisharp's fantastic traits it does not come without drawbacks. Will-O-Wisp, which now has 85% accuracy, has no problem burning Bisharp. In addition, Bisharp is weak to common Fire and Ground attacks and is 4x weak to Mach Punch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bisharp does not really have many other options for possible moves. It is fast enough to use Taunt to block status moves such as Rotom's Will-O-Wisp as well as Musharna's Trick Room, but that would mean dropping Sucker Punch. Bisharp can run Black Glasses or Life Orb for some additional power, and this is an alternative that does not lock it into a single move like Choice Band. If on a team weak to sun, Bisharp can use Stone Edge, which easily OHKOes Mega Charizard Y and works beautifully with Focus Sash. Bisharp can also run Brick Break, to hit other Bisharp, Lucario, and Tyranitar harder, as well as other Steel-types. Finally, Substitute is always an option over Night Slash to dodge status and take advantage of predicted switches. However, it can backfire because it allows your opponents to freely switch in Intimidate Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Pokemon like Rotom-A and Talonflame that are not too afraid of Bisharp's STAB attacks and can burn it are solid checks.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out</strong>: Fake Out users such as Ludicolo force Bisharp to Protect on the first turn, which exposes its partner.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan threatens Bisharp with both Fake Out and a 4x super effective Power-Up Punch.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake and Heat Wave</strong>: Pokemon such as Garchomp and Mega Charizard Y that do not fear Sucker Punch much can spam their super effective spread moves and successfully check Bisharp.</p> <p><strong>Bisharp</strong>: Other Bisharp counter Bisharp pretty well, especially with Brick Break.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Conkeldurr is a pretty reliable check with Mach Punch. Machamp can OHKO with Dynamic Punch or spam Protect or Bullet Punch until Bisharp is KOed. Lucario can set up on Bisharp and OHKO back with a Fighting-type move because it resists both of Bisharp's STAB types.</p> <p><strong>Hail</strong>: Residual damage from hail can neuter Bisharp's Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur and Mega Charizard Y</strong>: Venusaur and Mega Charizard Y can together put Bisharp to sleep and deal heavy damage with Heat Wave. Klefki and other Prankster users are beyond annoying for Bisharp as well.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard</strong>: Quick Guard can prevent Bisharp from spamming Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The most-used move on this set is Sucker Punch; it is predictable but important, as it lets Bisharp pick off faster Pokemon and forces opponents to Protect or switch. Iron Head is a staple attack that offers great coverage with Sucker Punch, as well as a nice 30% flinch chance. In the third slot, Night Slash offers more reliability than Sucker Punch, but Swords Dance allows Bisharp to boost its Attack to gargantuan levels without losing much coverage. Protect is used in the last spot for dodging Fake Out chip damage and its overall utility in doubles.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The ability of choice is obviously Defiant, which completely outclasses Inner Focus. EVs are maxed in Attack and Speed on the set because Bisharp does not need any bulk. An Adamant nature is preferred because Bisharp appreciates all the power it can get to 2HKO most Rotom-A. Focus Sash is the recommended item because it lets Bisharp play more recklessly and helps it survive spread moves such as Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave and Garchomp's Earthquake. Lum Berry is also an option because it gives Bisharp the freedom of destroying Rotom-W and protection from Liepard, Klefki, and Meowstic spamming Swagger. In addition, Bisharp is in a pretty interesting Speed tier, with a base 70 Speed stat. It can successfully run a Brave nature on a Trick Room team while also being fast enough to outspeed every VGC-eligible Pokemon under Tailwind. Finally, Choice Band is an option with a bulkier EV spread of 100 HP / 252 Atk / 156 Spd. With this spread, Bisharp will always survive one Jolly unboosted Garchomp's Earthquake and easily outspeed uninvested Rotom-A. Alternatively, a spread of 100 HP / 220 Atk / 188 Spd can be used to outspeed neutral-natured maximum Speed Tyranitar. The only difference in moves is to drop Protect for Brick Brick.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Depending on how skilled your opponent is, Bisharp is most effective as a lead, benefiting from Intimidate and immediately threatening a multitude of Pokemon with its powerful STAB moves. Sucker Punch is an incredibly predictable move so it needs to be used sparingly. In addition, try and avoid situations when Sucker Punch is required, as it can potentially provide a free turn for the opposing Pokemon to use Substitute or just switch instead. Bisharp does not fear King's Shield at all, as the drop is negated by Defiant, so it can just Night Slash all Aegislash. Finally, Choice Band Bisharp appreciates disruptive support such as Rage Powder Amoonguss to stop it from getting slaughtered by Fighting-type moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gyarados, Rotom-H, and Rotom-W are good partners because they resist both Ground- and Fire-type spread moves, which hit Bisharp for super effective damage. Rotom-H additionally checks Mega Charizard Y, and its Rock-type weakness is covered by Bisharp. Additionally, all Rotom formes can burn opposing Mega Kangaskhan, which can otherwise Power-Up Punch straight through Bisharp's Focus Sash. Other good partners include Fake Out support Pokemon so Bisharp can attack first-turn as well as Pokemon that benefit from a lack of Intimidate, such as Tyranitar and Mega Kangaskhan. Air Balloon Chandelure is also a cool partner for Bisharp, dodging all Ground-and Fire-type moves and usually burning Mega Kangaskhan without fear.</p>"

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>In the earlier years of VGC, Hydreigon was considered nearly uncounterable, yet it now has a difficult time maintaining this status. Hydreigon gained a 4x weakness with the introduction of Fairy-types, and consequently, it now has a harder time staying alive; its base 98 Speed, which falls short of the 100 base Speed tier, is even more problematic than it was in the last generation. Its Dark typing also brings extra Fighting- and Bug-type weaknesses to the table, including weaknesses to many priority moves such as Mach Punch. On top of all this, it's not the only Dragon available; Hydreigon faces stiff competition from faster and bulkier Dragons, including old rivals such as Salamence and Garchomp, as well as newer Dragons such as Noivern and Goodra.</p> <p>However, don't count Hydreigon out just yet. Thanks to its base 125 Special Attack stat, Hydreigon is the strongest specially-based Dragon in the metagame. Hydreigon is also able to hit Steel-types with its STAB moves, as Dark-type moves are no longer resisted by Steel-types, giving it great coverage alongside its Dragon-type attacks. Its typing and Levitate ability also give it immunities to both Ground- and Psychic-type moves, which combined with its above average 92/90/90 bulk and slew of resistances means it can take an attack or two along the way. Finally, Hydreigon is quite versatile and has a vast movepool, allowing it to run a physical or even mixed set to surprise its opponent if need be. Even though it's slower than its Dragon brethren, Hydreigon's raw power will not disappoint.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydreigon has a diverse movepool and can run a variety of moves to surprise its opponent. For example, it can run a mixed set with Stone Edge or Rock Slide to hit Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, the former OHKOing and the latter 2HKOing the two. It can also run a physical set with moves such as Acrobatics, Earthquake, and Crunch, but Hydreigon will unfortunately have to rely on the inaccurate Dragon Rush or the unpredictable Outrage for a Dragon-type STAB attack. Hydreigon also has a vast special movepool that it can work with, including attacks such as Earth Power, Focus Blast, and even Surf. Hydreigon can also run Flash Cannon to try to hit Fairy-types, but generally it won't do enough damage to be significant. In addition to having a movepool as vast as the ocean, Hydreigon can run a variety of items and EV spreads to perform a specific niche. The most notable is running Choice Specs to provide even more power for Hydreigon. It can also run Safety Goggles or Lum Berry to counter Mega Charizard Y and Venusaur teams by being immune to Sleep Powder. A Haban Berry with a spread of 236 SpA / 132 SpD / 140 Spe with a Modest nature can be used to tank a Timid Choice Specs Salamence's Draco Meteor so that Hydreigon can retaliate with its own Draco Meteor while still outspeeding invested base 70s. Lastly, a bulkier spread of 68 Def / 224 SpA / 216 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to survive Jolly Garchomp's Dragon Claw while still allowing Hydreigon to outspeed invested base 92s.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Hydreigon really cannot do anything against Fairy-types. Azumarill in particular resists both of Hydreigon's STAB moves as well as Fire Blast and most of its other coverage moves, fearing the rare Hidden Power.</p> <p><strong>Faster Dragon-types</strong>: Faster Dragon-types such as Salamence can OHKO Hydreigon before it can do anything.</p> <p><strong>Conkeldurr</strong>: Assault Vest Conkeldurr can easily tank a Draco Meteor and OHKO Hydreigon while healing back up with Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Specially defensive Tyranitar can take any move Hydreigon has in store bar a Life Orb Focus Blast and retaliate back with a Brick Break.</p> <p><strong>Mega Lucario</strong>: Both physical and special variants of Mega Lucario can 2HKO with Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave respectively, though they should be wary of Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Mamoswine</strong>: Mamoswine can 2HKO with Ice Shard and potentially OHKO with Icicle Crash, and like Tyranitar, it only fears the rare Focus Blast.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set uses Hydreigon's strengths to their fullest, particularly its unparalleled attacking power. Draco Meteor is Hydreigon's main STAB move and does a hefty amount of damage to the majority of the metagame. Alternatively, Dragon Pulse can be used over Draco Meteor if the Special Attack drop is unappealing, though the decrease in power is noticeable. Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's second STAB attack, giving it good coverage against the majority of the tier; between its two STAB moves, Hydreigon only hits Fairy-types and select Pokemon like Bisharp for anything less than neutral damage. Dark Pulse also allows Hydreigon to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Aegislash, which are OHKOed and 2HKOed, respectively, for super effective damage. Fire Blast hits Steel-types for super effective damage and is Hydreigon's best way of getting past them, as while Flamethrower is a more accurate option, it has less power and will not net an OHKO on Ferrothorn or Mega Mawile without a Modest nature. Protect is a useful utility move that allows Hydreigon to avoid getting double attacked.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Speed and a Timid nature makes Hydreigon as fast as possible, hopefully negating the impact of its awkward Speed tier, while Special Attack is also maximized for obvious reasons. If you are not concerned about Speed, Hydreigon can run a Modest nature instead to increase the power of its attacks even further. Life Orb is recommended in order to give Hydreigon an extra power boost, but if you're worried about Hydreigon going down too quickly, Focus Sash is another option.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even though Hydreigon's power is unrivaled, it still needs to play conservatively to overcome its weaknesses to Fighting-, Bug-, and Fairy-types, especially as Fairy-types can switch in for free on its Dragon-type attacks. If Fairy-types aren't on the field, then Hydreigon can be played more aggressively to try and obtain early OHKOs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Aegislash in particular are tremendously helpful in dealing with Fairy-types. The former is able to stall out threats such as Mawile with the combination of Leech Seed and Protect, and the latter is immune or resistant to all of Hydreigon's weaknesses. However, Aegislash must be careful in order to play around Mawile's Sucker Punch. Amoonguss pairs well with Hydreigon, thanks to its access to Rage Powder, to redirect moves aimed at Hydreigon towards itself, and Spore, to temporarily incapacitate the opponent's Pokemon. This means that it can provide Hydreigon with the free turns it needs in which to deal heavy damage. Any Rotom forme, especially Rotom-H, can provide Thunder Wave support to help Hydreigon overcome its awkward Speed tier; it can also provide dual screens support to help Hydreigon take hits more easily. With its access to Levitate, Hydreigon is a good partner with a Pokemon that spams Ground-type moves.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Equipping a Choice Scarf allows Hydreigon to bypass the ill effects of its base 98 Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed threats it otherwise wouldn't be able to. Draco Meteor is Hydreigon's strongest STAB move, and even without a boosting item it hits exceptionally hard off a base 125 Special Attack stat. Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's secondary, reliable STAB attack and can be used where Draco Meteor would be unnecessary. Fire Blast is Hydreigon's main way of getting through Steel-types such as Mega Mawile. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast, but without a boosting item, it will not do significant damage to its intended targets. Finally, Dragon Pulse can be used along with Dark Pulse, which makes Hydreigon better at cleaning up weakened teams. However, if Dragon Pulse is not needed to clean up teams, then U-turn can be used to switch out of bad situations while chipping away at the opposing Pokemon's health.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread with a Modest nature emphasizes power instead of Speed, because thanks to the Choice Scarf, Hydreigon will not be outspeeding much with a Speed-boosting nature that it couldn't without. If you are worried about Speed tying with opposing Choice Scarf Hydreigon, a Timid nature is a perfectly reasonable choice instead.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hydreigon needs to be played carefully around Fairy-types, as it could possibly be locked into a Dragon-type move on a Fairy-type. Hydreigon should ideally be used as a pseudo-revenge killer to pick off weakened foes. If the situation is unfavorable, Hydreigon should either switch or U-turn out into an appropriate counter to deal with the threat. Also, you should make use of Hydreigon's immunity to Ground-type attacks to safely switch into predicted Earthquakes. Finally, before using Choice Scarf Hydreigon aggressively, you should pick off faster Choice Scarf users that can knock out Hydreigon before it can move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Fairy-types are especially problematic, a Steel- or Poison-type partner should be used in order to deal with them. Bisharp is especially helpful as it can easily deal with the majority of Fairy-types in the metagame while also providing Knock Off support to remove Choice Scarf from faster opposing Pokemon. With the Speed increase granted by Choice Scarf, Hydreigon can function as a scout with U-turn. Because of this, Intimidate users such as Mawile are quite handy in order to weaken physical attackers. Gardevoir can aid Hydreigon by picking off faster Choice Scarf Dragon-types such as the common Choice Scarf Salamence.</p>"

  "Talonflame": {
    "overview": "<p>On paper, Talonflame looks like yet another mediocre Pokemon, similar the rest of its friends found in the early routes. However, Talonflame has a saving grace in the form of Gale Wings, which turns it into a premier Pokemon with its ability to destroy opposing Pokemon with powerful priority Brave Birds and benefit the team with its plethora of support options. However, the skies aren't completely clear for Talonflame, as it is weak to the common Water-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves that plague the metagame, has rather mediocre stats to back up its amazing ability, and has a movepool that is nothing to write home about, therefore limiting its options. However, don't let these shortcomings put you off from using Talonflame, as it is by far one of the most potent attackers and effective supporters in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Though it doesn't have the best offensive movepool, Talonflame has a very good supportive movepool and a few other offensive options to consider. Talonflame has a wide range of support moves that can go on the standard set, the most notable of which are Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Roost. However, these are generally outclassed by the options that are currently in the set. Overheat can be used on the standard set with a Mild nature and an EV spread of 172 Atk / 252 SpA / 84 Spe however, such a set packs a weaker Brave Bird and forces Talonflame to run Life Orb, which may be unattractive due to the recoil it induces. On the subject of Overheat, Talonflame has a range of special moves that it can use, such as Hidden Power - most notably Flying - Fire Blast, Flamethrower, and Solar Beam. Acrobatics can be used over Aerial Ace on the Choice Band set in case Talonflame is on the receiving end of a Knock Off. However, Knock Off is too uncommon to recommend preparing for, and Aerial Ace is stronger when Talonflame holds an item.</p> <p>A Charti Berry or Wacan Berry can be used with an EV spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe to guarantee that Talonflame can survive Brave Tyranitar's Rock Slide, even after Sandstorm damage, or Modest Rotom-H's Thunderbolt. Natural Gift can be used to give Talonflame a better way to deal with Rotom-W and Tyranitar in tandem with Liechi Berry and Salac Berry, respectively. While the former item could have utility if not used up by Natural Gift, the latter is mostly unnecessary, as the Speed boost is irrelevant to most moves bar Flare Blitz. Furthermore, Natural Gift can only be used once without access to Recycle or Harvest, two things that Talonflame lacks, so it isn't recommended. Lastly, Talonflame has access to Swords Dance and Bulk Up to boost its stats, but Talonflame isn't going to be around for long enough to utilize these moves well.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-W and Rotom-H are Talonflame's worst enemies, as it cannot do much damage to either of them with its STAB moves. Mega Manectric can deal with Talonflame well due to Intimidate, though it must be wary of a sun-boosted Flare Blitz. Mega Ampharos can tank Talonflame's moves better than Mega Manectric can, but doesn't have access to Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar resists both of Talonflame's STAB attacks, although it must be wary of Talonflame's U-turn, as it will 2HKO 92 HP / 124 Def Tyranitar 5.1% of the time. Furthermore, Tyranitar is vulnerable to double-targeting and could be KOed that turn. Rhydon and Rhyperior completely wall Talonflame, but they must be wary of one of Talonflame's usual teammates: Rotom-W. Aerodactyl gives Talonflame competition as a Tailwind user and can OHKO it with its STAB Rock Slide. However, like Rhyperior, Aerodactyl must be wary of Rotom-W.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Slowbro and Rotom-W can tank both of Talonflame's STAB attacks and retaliate with STAB Scald and Hydro Pump, respectively. However, the former must be wary of Talonflame's U-turn. Azumarill is capable of tanking Talonflame's Brave Bird and OHKOing back with STAB Waterfall or Aqua Jet, though the latter requires some prior damage. However, it must be wary of Rotom-W, which can OHKO with Thunderbolt. Gyarados is similar to Azumarill, though it trades Aqua Jet for Intimidate, making it an even better way to deal with Talonflame.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard</strong>: Quick Guard users such as Mienshao and opposing Talonflame play mind games with Talonflame, as they are capable of wasting its turn with Quick Guard and allowing a teammate to cripple or KO it.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Scrafty and Salamence, can weaken Talonflame and force it to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Moves</strong>: Pokemon such as Garchomp and Salamence often carry Rock Slide for coverage. They can often take a hit and OHKO Talonflame in return.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gale Wings is incredibly useful, as it grants Talonflame priority Tailwind and the most powerful priority move in the game in the form of Brave Bird. Brave Bird is Talonflame's main attack due to the priority it gains from Gale Wings, ripping through Pokemon such as Amoonguss. Talonflame's secondary STAB move, Flare Blitz, complements Brave Bird fairly well; the two moves form a potent combination resisted only by the Rock-type and a few other dual typings. Tailwind is a priority move that boosts the Speed of the entire team for a few turns. Protect is a staple in Doubles for its ability to scout the opponent's moves and protect the user from damage, especially important considering the ability to double target. Quick Guard can be used in the place of Tailwind or Protect as the utility it provides is incredibly handy on Talonflame. Quick Guard blocks Fake Out from the likes of Mega Kangaskhan, can give your teammate a free turn to move, and has been buffed in that it no longer fails when used in succession.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs enable Talonflame to hit with as much power as possible as well as outpace max Speed Mega Kangaskhan. As a result, Talonflame can block Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out with Quick Guard and utilize Brave Bird to nullify Sucker Punch. Talonflame can run max Speed to outpace every Fake Out user in the metagame excluding max Speed Raichu, which Speed ties with it, and max Speed Weavile, which outpaces it anyway. This also enables Talonflame to outpace most opposing Talonflame, which can be a valuable asset. However, maximum Speed investment is unadvised as Raichu and Weavile are too uncommon, and Talonflame can mess with opposing Talonflame with Quick Guard. The item of choice depends on what you want Talonflame to do: it can hold a Sky Plate for a little more survivability at the cost of power, or a Life Orb for the extra power, enabling a guaranteed 2HKO on 244 HP Bold Coba Berry Ludicolo with Brave Bird at the cost of survivability. An Adamant nature is run as there is no reason to run a Jolly nature, as Talonflame will use Brave Bird, Tailwind, Quick Guard and Protect most of the time.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Talonflame in early-game to support the team with Tailwind and Quick Guard. Make your move accordingly based around the lead match-up, using Quick Guard turn one when against a lead Kangaskhan, setting up Tailwind when you feel it is needed, such as when facing a particularly fast team, and using Brave Bird or Flare Blitz to deal with opposing threats such as Ludicolo and Scizor. As you can imagine, mirror match-ups consist of many mind games, so make sure to play conservatively in these situations, predicting your opponent's move and using your 45 seconds well. Misprediction might get Talonflame KOed, for example, by Garchomp's Rock Slide when it uses Brave Bird and the opponent uses Quick Guard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types such as Scizor and Aegislash have good synergy with Talonflame and can deal with the Rock-types that resist Talonflame's attacks. Rotom-W and Rotom-H can deal with opposing Talonflame as well as deal Mega Charizard Y, and the latter can take advantage of the sun that Mega Charizard Y summons. Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Aerodactyl can also deal with opposing Talonflame, and the former can also deal with Rotom-H. Amoonguss walls Rotom-W and threatens it with a STAB Giga Drain. Mega Charizard Y can summon sun, boosting the power of Talonflame's Flare Blitz and compensating its slight lack of power when it holds a Sky Plate. Talonflame and Garchomp create a terrifying offensive core with excellent offensive synergy; Talonflame covers Fairy-types and Ferrothorn while Garchomp covers Talonflame and Rotom-H.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is the move that Talonflame will generally be using most of the time due to its STAB boost and Gale Wings. Flare Blitz is mainly a backup move for when locking Talonflame into Brave Bird isn't optimal, and deals with Pokemon such as Scizor and Aegislash better than Brave Bird does. U-turn is useful on this set as it allows Talonflame to escape from a bad situation and is Talonflame's best move for Tyranitar. The last moveslot is mainly filler, but there are a few options to consider. Tailwind serves the same purpose as on the standard set, and can help bluff a non-Choice set. However, Talonflame is basically forced to switch out on the following turn after using Tailwind, so it will soon be clear that Talonflame is Choice-locked. Before setting up Tailwind, Me First helps Talonflame against Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, stealing Rock Slide and OHKOing them. However, the move is a little situational. Aerial Ace can also be used in the fourth moveslot as a recoil-free way of dealing with weakened opponents, but is very weak and forces Talonflame to switch out after using it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are to outpace opposing Talonflame and maximize its firepower. An Adamant nature and Choice Band augment Talonflame's offensive capabilities, turning it into a nuke that can spam Brave Bird with little worry. A Jolly nature is worthless, as Talonflame is mostly going to spam Brave Bird.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Brave Bird is most often the best move to use, though it should not be used recklessly. Write down the opposing team and refer to it whenever you are making decisions, as you will often find situations mid-game where Brave Bird is not the best move to use. Switch strategically to ensure that the Pokemon you are switching in takes as little damage as possible. An example includes luring a Rock Slide with Talonflame and switching into Garchomp to take the hit, allowing Talonflame to come in later and lock itself into the appropriate move. General decisions include using U-turn when Tyranitar is on the opponent's side of the field, using Flare Blitz when Aegislash or Scizor is a threat to your team, and using Talonflame's filler move when you deem it to be appropriate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-W and Rotom-H can deal with opposing Talonflame, and the latter can deal with Mega Charizard Y very well. Rotom-M, on the other hand, is a great Pokemon to deal with opposing Rotom-W and Tyranitar. Tyranitar can deal with Rotom-H, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard Y well, though it must be wary of Talonflame's U-turn and Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan can prevent Rock Slides and enable Talonflame to U-turn out safely and bring in a Pokemon with a better match-up against the opponent's Pokemon. Fake Out users can also give Talonflame a turn to set up with Tailwind or utilize another move. The combination of Scizor and Talonflame is effective, as Scizor can deal with the Rock-types that wall Talonflame and Talonflame can deal with Aegislash, which can cause problems for Scizor that lack Thief. However, Scizor is walled by Rotom-W and Rotom-H, and must be wary of the former's Will-O-Wisp and the latter's Overheat. Garchomp also makes an excellent partner, as it can defeat Rotom-H, though it must be wary of Will-O-Wisp. Amoonguss is capable of dealing with Rotom-W and Tyranitar as well as supporting Talonflame with Spore and Rage Powder. However, it must be wary of Crunch and Rock Slide from Tyranitar. Lastly, Mold Breaker Haxorus can 2HKO 252 HP / 44 Def Rotom-W and always OHKO Rotom-H with Earthquake.</p>"
