Follow Me lets Indeedee redirect attacks to itself, an essential strategy in 2v2 Doubles, to keep its hard-hitting partner alive for multiple turns; for example, it can stop Naganadel’s Draco Meteor from hitting Zygarde and give Zygarde the opportunity to KO back. Expanding Force is Indeedee's best attacking move for cases where extra chip damage might be useful in finishing off opponent. Helping Hand is used when Indeedee’s partner needs an increase in power to secure a KO on an opposing Pokemon; for example, it allows Choice Scarf Zygarde to secure the KO on Cinderace with Thousand Arrows. Protect is useful on Indeedee because the opponent will sometimes focus on Indeedee to eliminate the possibility of redirection, so Protect grants it extra survivability. It can also be useful to block a slower Rillaboom’s Fake Out in Grassy Terrain. Fake Out can be used instead of Protect as a way to prevent Flying-types from using their first move, which is useful against top tier threats like Tornadus’s Tailwind or Togekiss’s Follow Me, and also is useful for when the opponent prevents Indeedee’s Terrain with Pokemon like Iron Ball Rillaboom. Iron Ball can be used to make Indeedee as slow as possible, giving it the best chance that its Terrain will go up after Rillaboom, as Rillaboom loses power and Grassy Glide priority when Grassy Terrain is not active. Imprison can be used to prevent opposing Indeedee and Togekiss from using Follow Me.
