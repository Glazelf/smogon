Its convenient Speed tier, high Attack stat, and good coverage moves allow it to OHKO many prevalent Pokemon such as Pheromosa, Genesect, Naganadel, and Kyurem-B. Its typing allows it to deal with metagame staples such as Victini and Incineroar defensively. Secondarily, it provides utility by targeting the main redirectors in Indeedee-F and Togekiss, as well as negating foes' Berries with Unnerve—this is very important in 2v2 Doubles due to many Pokemon like Zygarde, Kyurem-B, Indeedee-F, and Togekiss using Berries. Crunch allows Tyranitar to OHKO the incredibly bulky Indeedee-F, while Stone Edge OHKOes Togekiss. Fire Punch allows Tyranitar to reliably OHKO Pheromosa and Genesect. Rock Slide also OHKOes Pheromosa while ignoring redirection, but in turn does less to Genesect. 252 Speed EVs allow Tyranitar to outspeed Pheromosa in Tailwind.</p> <p>Tyranitar's Unnerve allows Pheromosa to OHKO Chople Berry Kyurem-B and Tanga Berry Indeedee-F. Genesect is similarly able to OHKO Tanga Berry Indeedee with the help of Unnerve. Tyranitar's ability to OHKO two of the metagame's best Follow Me users helps teammates that struggle against redirection such as Dracovish and Naganadel. Tyranitar benefits from Talonflame's Gale Wings Tailwind, or from other fast Tailwind setters such as Naganadel, since Tyranitar outspeeds Pheromosa, Genesect, Kyurem-B, Naganadel, and Cinderace under Tailwind and OHKOes them all. Tyranitar pairs especially well with Talonflame, which can OHKO threats to Tyranitar such as Rillaboom and Amoonguss—a redirection user that Tyranitar cannot OHKO. Tyranitar also pairs well with redirection, since it has many common weaknesses. For this reason, Indeedee-F, Togekiss, and Amoonguss are all good partners.</p> "

Triple Axel is a stronger STAB move, bypassing the effects of Yache Berry to pick up the OHKO on Zygarde, but is less consistent due to its lower accuracy. Knock Off is another strong STAB attack, removing items on Pokemon that rely on them like Porygon2 and Cresselia, as well as threatening OHKOs on Mew, Metagross, Victini, and Indeedee-F.

Weavile can also be used well with redirectors like Blastoise and Togekiss, allowing it to easily hit Pokemon that will OHKO your redirector, such as Rillaboom and Metagross. Without redirection, Weavile struggles to handle Pokemon like Zeraora and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, as they will always outspeed and KO it. Other Pokemon that work well as teammates are Water-types such as Blastoise and Tapu Fini that help deal with opposing Fire-types, as well as Fairy-type Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Togekiss to deal with Fighting-type Pokemon. Another solid teammate is Galarian Zapdos, which is able to clear out Rock- and Steel-types, as well as dissuade Intimidate users such as Incineroar. Due to Weavile's poor bulk and defensive typing, it is incredibly weak to Pokemon that outspeed it. Pokemon like Regieleki, Zeraora, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele make it extremely difficult for Weavile to get any attacks off, so Weavile can also benefit from immediate Tailwind support from Talonflame, which can also help deal with Fire-, Steel-, and Fighting-type Pokemon, especially hitting Pheromosa with a priority Brave Bird thanks to Gale Wings.</p> "

Close Combat is Pheromosa's strongest move outside of the unreliable High Jump Kick, and it's easily able to OHKO frail Pokemon, even when not super effective. such as Zeraora and Nihilego. Bug Buzz is a secondary STAB move that is useful for Psychic-type Pokemon such as Indeedee-F and Grass-types like Rillaboom. Ice Beam provides coverage to OHKO Naganadel, Zygarde, and Landorus-T. 12 Special Attack EVs allow Ice Beam to OHKO Nagandel with the rest placed into Attack.</p> <p>Pheromosa's speed and strong Ice Beam allow it to deal with Ground-types for Regieleki and Naganadel for Genesect. The combination of Regieleki and Pheromosa is very dangerous, as their high Speed and power often leave both foes KOed before they can move. Genesect, be it running Assault Vest or Life Orb, can cover Pheromosa's bad matchups such as Choice Scarf Zygarde or Tapu Fini. The two complement each other due to their high damage outputs, and Genesect's substantial bulk covers Pheromosa's frailty quite well. Pheromosa struggles against redirection and Tailwind, as well as Pokemon with resistance Berries such as Tanga Berry Indeedee-F,and Chople Berry Kyurem-B. Redirectors such as Indeedee-F and Togekiss are good teammates, as they can also provide the redirection that Pheromosa desires while denying t foe redirection with Imprison. Talonflame is great to negate its Tailwind weakness by setting Tailwind themselves. Tyranitar stifles resistance Berries with Unnerve and also OHKOes redirectors in Indeedee-F and Togekiss, which pester Pheromosa.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Indeedee’s access to Psychic Surge and Follow Me makes it a premier redirection user in 2v2 Doubles. Psychic Surge allows it to block priority moves such as the ever-present Fake Out, giving its teammates a free turn 1. Follow Me lets Indeedee redirect attacks to itself, an essential strategy in 2v2 Doubles, to keep its hard-hitting partner alive for multiple turns; for example, it can stop Naganadel’s Draco Meteor from hitting Zygarde and give Zygarde the opportunity to KO back. Expanding Force is Indeedee's best attacking move for cases where extra chip damage might be useful in finishing off opponent. Helping Hand is used when Indeedee’s partner needs an increase in power to secure a KO on an opposing Pokemon; for example, it allows Choice Scarf Zygarde to secure the KO on Cinderace with Thousand Arrows. Protect is useful on Indeedee because the opponent will sometimes focus on Indeedee to eliminate the possibility of redirection, so Protect grants it extra survivability. It can also be useful to block a slower Rillaboom’s Fake Out in Grassy Terrain. Fake Out can be used instead of Protect as a way to prevent Flying-types from using their first move, which is useful against top tier threats like Tornadus’s Tailwind or Togekiss’s Follow Me, and also is useful for when the opponent prevents Indeedee’s Terrain with Pokemon like Iron Ball Rillaboom. Iron Ball can be used to make Indeedee as slow as possible, giving it the best chance that its Terrain will go up after Rillaboom, as Rillaboom loses power and Grassy Glide priority when Grassy Terrain is not active. Imprison can be used to prevent opposing Indeedee and Togekiss from using Follow Me. Tanga and Colbur Berries can be used to survive hits from threats such as Genesect and Incineroar, respectively, which allows it to provide another turn of redirection, giving its partner two free turns ideally. Indeedee’s EVs are designed to allow it to live a hit from a standard Helping Hand Nihilego’s Meteor Beam, with the rest in Defense.</p> <p>Indeedee is most commonly found on hyper offensive teams with strong attackers that can overpower both opposing Pokemon. Indeedee is often paired with Pokemon that can benefit from and use Expanding Force in its Terrain, such as Victini, which handles Steel-types such as Genesect and Celesteela or Metagross which can can use Weakness policy to take advantage of spread moves such as Heat Wave and Earthquake that are commonly used against Indeedee. Other teammate options are Pokemon that benefit heavily from a free turn, such as Zygarde, which can set up with Dragon Dance and take care of Indeedee checks Tyranitar and Incineroar, or Nihilego, which appreciates the redirection to usually KO one opponent with Meteor Beam. Indeedee’s teammates often bring coverage for Dark-types that are immune to Expanding Force, such as Incineroar and Tyranitar, or Steel-types that Indeedee cannot beat such as Heatran and Celesteela. Common Pokemon that fill these roles are Pheromosa, and Cinderace.</p> "

Dazzling Gleam hits Dark-types that are commonly picked to counter Indeedee. Trick cripples passive opposing Pokemon such as Cresselia or Gastrodon.

Indeedee benefits from fast teammates such as Cinderace and Pheromosa to bring powerful Fighting-type coverage for Steel- and Dark-types that will be able to survive Indeedee’s attacks. If Indeedee is not running Follow Me, it will usually need bulkier teammates that can survive without redirection such as Life Orb Zygarde to beat Incineroar, Tyranitar, and Steel-types or bulky Weakness Policy Victini to take advantage of Pokemon like Zygarde using Thousand Arrows. Other bulky Fire-types such as Heatran and Volcanion can also accomplish this goal. Diancie is also a good option, as it beats Incineroar and Galarian Moltres, which usually wall Indeedee, as well as providing support through Helping Hand.</p> "
