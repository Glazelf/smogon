It can also use more passive Pokemon such as Mareanie as setup fodder. Focus Blast lets Raichu break through special walls like Type: Null and Munchlax and targets Silvally-Grass and Vibrava, which take little damage from its other moves. Surf is usually preferred to Grass Knot, as it hits Stunfisk harder than any other move, but Grass Knot eases the matchup against Palpitoad. Lightning Rod is Raichu's best ability, as it lets Raichu provide its team with an Electric-type immunity and take advantage of Choice-locked Manectric and Silvally-Electric to gain setup opportunities. Volt Switch can be used to give Raichu a more prominent role early-game, Protect can be used to prevent priority users like Falinks and Fraxure from revenge killing it, and Knock Off can be used to cripple Eviolite users like Type: Null and Vibrava and make them easier to revenge kill, but it struggles to fit any of these moves over important coverage.</p> <p>Raichu fits well on entry hazard-stacking teams, as the chip damage lets it break through targets like Throh and different Silvally formes more easily. Roselia can handle Grass-types that Raichu struggles against such as Gourgeist-XL and Shiinotic, and other hazard setters such as Mareanie, Palpitoad, and Hippopotas can effectively answer priority users like Falinks. Due to its poor bulk, Raichu appreciates partners that can bring it in safely.

Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolt makes Raichu very difficult to switch into, with even Electric-resistant Pokemon like Gourgeist and Leafeon struggling to take two hits when entry hazards are up. Focus Blast lets Raichu offensively check Type: Null and Dubwool and is its best option for hitting Seaking and Vibrava, which otherwise easily block its Volt Switch. Surf notably prevents Raichu from getting blocked by Stunfisk and deals more damage than Grass Knot to Hippopotas. Alternatively, Grass Knot eases the matchup against Palpitoad, but it leaves Raichu unable to deal with Stunfisk. Lightning Rod lets Raichu take advantage of Silvally-Electric and Choice-locked Manectric, potentially boosting its Special Attack and making it even more difficult to switch into. Raichu can also run a similar set with Choice Scarf; however, the drop in power is fairly noticeable, and it is generally outclassed by other Choice Scarf users such as Manectric and Mr. Mime that can provide additional utility with Switcheroo and Trick, respectively.</p> <p>Roselia stands out as a great partner; not only can it provide entry hazards such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which can help Raichu break through foes like Gourgeist and Type: Null more easily, but it also takes advantage of Raichu bringing in foes like Shiinotic and Gourgeist-XL, which it can pressure offensively or use as setup fodder, respectively. It also greatly appreciates Raichu dealing with Vespiquen and Mareanie, which can easily remove its hazards, as well as Steel-types like Mawile and Klang. Galarian Mr. Mime appreciates Raichu bringing it in safely with Volt Switch, and it can pressure foes that Raichu struggles to break through such as Roselia and Gloom, as well as give it a better chance at cleaning late-game with Healing Wish. Fire-types like Heatmor and Raboot similarly benefit from Volt Switch and can pressure targets that Raichu invites in like Shiinotic and Silvally-Grass; the former can even take advantage of Manectric trying to check Choice-locked Raichu with Fire-type coverage. In return, Raichu pressures Water-types like Mareanie and Lapras. Palpitoad and Throh can provide a solid defensive backbone, being able to switch into potential revenge killers such as Falinks, Choice Band Fraxure, and Pikachu; the former can also easily switch into Manectric, which can otherwise take advantage of Raichu if it's Choice locked, and the latter also fits well on entry hazard-stacking teams, as it can use Circle Throw to further wear down the opposing team and make it easier for Raichu to perform its job.

However, it suffers extreme competition in this role from Pikachu, which boasts Extreme Speed and a greater offensive presence at the expense of some Speed. Fake Out lets Persian get extra damage on the foe without punishment and stall for extra poison damage, letting it follow up with Double-Edge in order to secure KOs on targets like the Silvally formes. Fake Out can also be used to pick off heavily weakened targets that have boosted their Speed, like Fraxure, in a pinch. Knock Off removes items from bulky switch-ins that otherwise disregard anything Persian can do to them, such as Mawile, Dusclops, and Hippopotas, and provides coverage for Ghost-types like Drakloak. U-turn lets Persian keep up momentum for its team, saving it from floundering against bulky foes like Stonjourner, Mawile, and Dusclops. Hypnosis can be used over Knock Off to better cripple switch-ins like Mawile but is unreliable due to its poor accuracy and leaves Persian unable to damage Ghost-types outside of U-turn. Silk Scarf is preferred in order to boost Persian's most important attacks without further cutting into its already limited longevity. Technician is vital in order to let Fake Out deal significant damage.</p> <p>Persian is a good fit for bulky offense teams utilizing Spikes, which help it gradually overwhelm its switch-ins with Spikes damage, Fake Out, and U-turn. Offensive Roselia is an effective Spiker that Persian can bring in on switchins such as Mareanie, Gourgeist, and Dubwool via U-turn to set up Spikes. Roselia can also utilize Sleep Powder to put shared checks like Mawile and Pawniard to sleep. Offensive entry hazard setters like Crustle and Pawniard help weaken foes early-game, and their hazards greatly aid Persian in its role as a revenge killer. Persian can form an effective VoltTurn core with teammates like Manectric, Raichu, and Raboot, all of which can cover Pokemon that can safely switch in on Persian such as Mawile, Stonjourner, and Pawniard. Silvally-Psychic can put offensive pressure on Fighting-types Persian struggles with, such as Throh, Falinks, and Hitmontop, while also threatening to set up and breaking down targets like Mawile to help Persian clean late-game. Mr. Rime can't switch in easily but can pressure Throh and Hitmontop, and its access to hazard control helps keep Persian from being overwhelmed by residual damage. Stacking other priority users like Pawniard and Falinks with Persian can form a powerful anti-setup core that takes pressure off Persian.

Magneton's average Speed also leaves it outsped by common offensive threats like Gallade and Magmortar.

Other pivots such as Passimian and Tsareena pair well with Magneton, since they create a momentum core and help to exert increased pressure on opposing teams.

Walls like Aromatisse, Weezing, and Gigalith serve as a safety net against faster Fighting- and Fire-types like Passimian and Magmortar that force Magneton out. The former also offers Magneton vital Wish support, while the latter two can wear its switch-ins down with entry hazards, status, and, in Gigalith's case, sand. Pokemon like Sandaconda and Ribombee provide Magneton with speed control in Glare and Stun Spore, respectively, which gives it more opportunities to wallbreak by making it harder to immediately threaten out.

This set fits best on offensive teams in need of both a revenge killer and a pivot. Bear in mind that Magneton doesn't need much support to function, meaning you should add it to teams that benefit from its talents rather than build around it. Magneton struggles with bulky Electric-immune Pokemon such as Lanturn, which is especially problematic given that many of its targets can easily fall back on them. As such, it appreciates having teammates like Tsareena and Whimsicott.

Mr. Mime also appreciates their ability to break through bulkier Pokemon like Mawile and Shiinotic for it to pick off. While Mr. Mime is decently fast, it is still outsped by Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Manectric as well as Flame Charge Silvally formes, so priority users like Hitmontop and Falinks or Speed-boosting sweepers like Rock Polish Stonjourner help take care of these threats. Defensive checks to these Pokemon like Palpitoad, Drakloak, and Pyukumuku also help Mr. Mime handle them. Alternatively, if Mr. Mime is running Trick, its ability to cripple special walls by removing their items allows other specially offensive Pokemon like Raichu and Choice Specs Glaceon to break through them better.</p> "

Defog and Pressure pair nicely together, as this means you can PP stall Toxic Spikes and Spikes from Mareanie and Roselia for the entirety of the game. Alternatively, Toxic Spikes cripples foes, while Aromatherapy lets Vespiquen function as a cleric. Vespiquen’s Speed alongside U-turn is excellent for slow pivoting, giving you ample opportunities to bring in wallbreakers.

Palpitoad is very notable as a partner; it resists Rock, checks Pawniard, and handles Fire- and Electric-types like Raboot and Manectric, while Vespiquen checks Grass-types in return. Vespiquen's reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots means it is not optimal to have its item removed by Knock Off unless you are using Acrobatics, so Knock Off absorbers like Rocky Helmet Mawile, Silvally formes, Colbur Berry Musharna, and Throh make it easier for Vespiquen to not be affected by Stealth Rock damage. Strong wallbreakers that can break Rock- and Ice-types, like Falinks, Silvally formes, and Stonjourner, appreciate the safety from slow U-turn pivoting; Vespiquen benefits from the removal of such Pokemon, since it makes it much easier for it to use Defog. Vespiquen does not appreciate Ice-type Pokemon like Mr. Rime, Glaceon, and Lapras; Type: Null, Mr. Rime, Klang, Throh, and Lapras are fine options for mitigating this weakness, using Toxic, pivoting, or phasing them out to deal with them.</p> "

Freeze-Dry allows Glaceon to threaten Ice-resistant Water-types like Pyukumuku and Corsola, and it's also Glaceon's best option against Lapras. Shadow Ball allows Glaceon to OHKO Galarian Mr. Mime and threaten specially defensive Mr. Rime. It also hits Klang and opposing Glaceon harder than any other move Glaceon can viably run. Water Pulse targets Carkol, though it doesn't have much use outside of that. Frost Breath can allow Glaceon to get past bulky Calm Mind and Cosmic Power users like Musharna and Gothitelle in a pinch, but the move is virtually useless outside of this one purpose and cuts into Glaceon's already limited coverage. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Falinks and Choice Band Fraxure as well as Speed tie with offensive Roselia. Glaceon could opt to use Choice Scarf to act as a revenge killer rather than a wallbreaker. Although this allows Glaceon to take care of +1 Adamant Fraxure and circumvent typical offensive checks like Silvally-Grass and Raichu, such a set severely reduces Glaceon's power and faces serious competition from Mr. Rime and Galarian Mr. Mime due to their higher Speed tiers, better coverage, and access to Healing Wish.</p> <p>Glaceon's low Speed and poor defensive typing make it very easy to offensively pressure, so it appreciates having bulky teammates to fall back on in the face of faster Fire-, Fighting-, and Rock-types. Vibrava gives Glaceon an easier time switching in by removing entry hazards with Defog and generating momentum with U-turn. It's worth noting that a lot of Pokemon that Vibrava baits in and pivots out against, like Gloom and Togetic, find themselves easily exploited by Glaceon. Mareanie absorbs Toxic Spikes upon switching in, can wear teams down with its own Toxic Spikes, and also softens up bulky foes that depend on their item, like Type: Null and Lapras, with Knock Off. Although Glaceon is strong, it lacks the coverage to bypass dedicated Ice-type answers such as Munchlax and Klang. Wallbreakers like Mawile, Hitmontop, and Flame Orb Throh help to remedy this issue, and they appreciate Glaceon taking on physical walls like Mareanie, Shiinotic, and Gourgeist-XL. Mawile also provides Stealth Rock support to put further pressure on teams, while Hitmontop removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Glaceon has an easier time breaking through teams with Spikes support, essentially 2HKOing Type: Null after Stealth Rock and three layers of Spikes. Roselia is a great Spikes setter, capable of incapacitating foes like Klang with Sleep Powder and making them easier for Glaceon to overwhelm. Pivots like Manectric and Silvally-Bug can give Glaceon more opportunities to switch in, with both examples doubling as late-game sweepers that can exploit the holes that Glaceon leaves in teams earlier on. These pivots can annoy Pokemon like Lapras and Pawniard, while Glaceon can threaten Palpitoad and Carkol.</p> "

Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Glaceon from being worn down by entry hazards, which allows it to more easily switch around and better preserve the health of it and its teammates. This immunity to entry hazards, alongside Glaceon's higher Special Attack and natural defenses, helps to separate it from Togetic, another cleric that similarly has access to Wish and Heal Bell. Although Glaceon has higher Defense than Special Defense, its poor defensive typing is easily exploited by many of the tier's physical attackers, including Mawile, Falinks, and Silvally-Rock. There are fewer specially offensive Pokemon that can do the same, and opting for a specially defensive set provides defensive teams with a secondary check to threats like Ludicolo and opposing Glaceon.</p> <p>Stunfisk and physically defensive Mawile appreciate having their lack of reliable recovery mitigated by Wish support, and in return, they can absorb Knock Off and check threats that Glaceon is vulnerable to, such as Pawniard and Stonjourner. Pyukumuku can also absorb Knock Off as well as wall setup sweepers like Falinks and Crustle that threaten Glaceon thanks to Unaware. In return, Glaceon can relieve Pyukumuku of any potential status conditions, which is especially useful for Rest variants. Stronger special attackers like Beheeyem and Raichu are capable of overwhelming Glaceon, meaning that it should never be the only special wall on balance teams. Other specially bulky Pokemon such as Type: Null, Dusclops, Vibrava, and Munchlax make for great partners because of this, with Rest allowing all three examples to soak up status conditions for Glaceon as well. Glaceon allows these examples to rely less on Rest by providing them with Wish support. Checks to Fighting-types are useful partners, since they can often switch into Glaceon with ease. Mareanie is a notable example, since it can consistently check Fighting-types thanks to both Recover and Regenerator, further wears teams down through Scald and either Toxic or Toxic Spikes, takes pressure off of Glaceon's team by absorbing Toxic Spikes, and stops setup sweepers like Falinks in their tracks with Haze.</p> "

Mesprit appreciates Pokemon that can punish U-turn, such as Rocky Helmet Druddigon and Coalossal, which can discourage Pokemon like Passimian and Togedemaru from freely pivoting versus Mesprit. Mesprit can also opt for a more defensively oriented spread that runs both U-turn and Healing Wish while foregoing Dazzling Gleam. However this set runs into extreme competition from Uxie, which is both faster and bulkier than Mesprit at the cost of being mildly less threatening due to its lower offenses and inability to bluff more threatening sets.</p> "

Mesprit is not the strongest wallbreaker around, so entry hazard setters such as Froslass and Regirock are advised to supplement its damage output. Weaker or non-boosting cleaners such as Dragon Dance Charizard and Tsareena are ideal Pokemon to make use of Mesprit's wallbreaking. Mesprit will also require a solid defensive core with blanket checks such as Palossand, Jellicent, and Weezing ready to cover the wide variety of threats capable of revenge killing Mesprit after minimal chip damage.</p> "

Furthermore, they can threaten specially defensive walls like Type: Null and Lickilicky, two foes that can pressure Swoobat with Shadow Claw and Knock Off, respectively. Swoobat is susceptible to priority Shadow Sneak from Gourgeist and Dusknoir, so answers to them like Unfezant and Morpeko make for good partners.

The aforementioned Sandslash as well as Defog users such as Drifblim and Silvally-Rock can help remove Stealth Rock, keeping Swoobat healthy to enable more setup opportunities.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Gothitelle faces competition from other Psychic-types like Musharna, Mr. Rime, and Beheeyem, with these Pokemon fitting onto multiple teams more easily. This is because of them being more potent offensively, more reliably checking Throh, having reliable recovery, and generating momentum in Beheeyem's case. In spite of this, Gothitelle can still function as a solid bulky setup sweeper due to its decent bulk with investment, Cosmic Power further augmenting its defenses, and Stored Power allowing it to make excellent use of the boosts it accrues. Teams lacking Dark-types can struggle with Gothitelle, since even specially bulky Pokemon and Psychic-resistant Pokemon, such as Dusclops, Type: Null, and Silvally-Psychic, take too much damage after enough boosts. Stored Power also bypasses Pyukumuku's Unaware, meaning Gothitelle can be a major threat to stall teams. Leftovers lessens the need to use Rest and provides Gothitelle with passive recovery, while Colbur Berry reduces the damage that it takes from Dark-type coverage against foes like Grapploct. Competitive exploits moves and abilities that drop Gothitelle's stats, like Defog and Intimidate, by boosting its Special Attack and making Stored Power stronger. Moves like Mean Look and Thunderbolt can be used over Sleep Talk to trap and set up on passive foes or hit Dark-types, respectively, though forgoing Sleep Talk leaves Gothitelle completely helpless while it's asleep. Weakness Policy allows Gothitelle to take advantage of super effective coverage like Knock Off from Throh and U-turn from non-Swords Dance Silvally formes. This is an especially viable option, since most opponents will go for super effective moves against Gothitelle given its bulk.</p> <p>Gothitelle fits best on bulkier builds, since its defensive nature and relatively low Speed would cost more offensive teams too much momentum. Dark-types like Pawniard and Galarian Linoone completely wall Gothitelle if its only attacking move is Stored Power. Fighting-types like Hitmontop and Throh are important teammates to have because of this, with the former also removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin and the latter wearing teams down through the combination of Circle Throw and Knock Off. Strong attackers like Silvally-Bug, Choice Specs Glaceon, and Nasty Plot Raichu can overwhelm Gothitelle faster than it can boost, meaning that teammates to pressure these wallbreakers, like Lapras and Roselia, are appreciated. Roselia can also pressure opposing teams with Spikes and Toxic Spikes, making it easier for Gothitelle to sweep. Silvally formes like Silvally-Bug and Silvally-Electric can also be useful partners, providing support through blocking Trick and Switcheroo from Mr. Mime and Manectric, breaking through foes like Mawile, and potentially removing entry hazards with Defog. In return, Gothitelle can absorb status conditions and set up on potential revenge killers like Manectric locked into Overheat. Pairing Gothitelle with Dark-types, notably Taunt Pawniard, can prevent a potential stalemate against opposing bulky Stored Power users like Musharna and Duosion.</p> "

Compared to its primary competitor in Lanturn, however, Jellicent brings to the table an excellent Ghost typing further enhanced by its myriad of supportive options such as Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Recover. Because of this, Jellicent is an effective switch-in to Fighting-types like Choice Scarf Passimian as well as an excellent defensive check to various physical attackers such as Kabutops and Silvally-Steel. Jellicent also provides teams additional utility by punishing Water-types or Choice-locked attackers depending on if it's running Water Absorb or Cursed Body. However, Jellicent can be rather passive due to its low offensive capabilities and reliance on status as the typical way of dealing damage. Furthermore, Jellicent struggles versus common special attackers such as Whimsicott and Galvantula, as many of them can comfortably switch in and typically are not overly bothered by Will-O-Wisp or Toxic.</p> ",

Hex is preferred as the sole attacking move on this set because it pairs well with its status moves versus bulkier defensive answers such as Lanturn. Colbur Berry is the optimal item in order to weaken Knock Off from the likes of Passimian or Gallade, but Heavy-Duty Boots can be used in order to be immune to entry hazards. Jellicent can also opt to not use an item, allowing it to switch into Choice Band Froslass, at the cost of some defensive utility against other threats. Gigalith makes a fantastic partner for Jellicent, as not only is it a good check to special attackers like Haunter, but with Sand Stream and hazard support, the residual damage Jellicent can spread with Will-O-Wisp and Toxic can severely cripple offensive answers like Whimsicott and Vikavolt. Conversely, Gigalith appreciates Jellicent's ability to reliably provide a Fighting immunity versus Choice-locked attackers like Passimian. Silvally-Fairy is also a fine partner, since it acts as a Knock Off absorber if Jellicent isn't running Colbur Berry and handles Dark-types such as Absol. Whimsicott makes a great offensive partner for Jellicent thanks to its ability to offensively check Sandaconda, Scrafty, and Absol, whereas Jellicent can check Charizard decently well. 32 Speed EVs allow Jellicent to outspeed Carracosta and Taunt it, preventing it from setting up with Shell Smash.</p> "

Its access to Volt Switch in combination with these traits also makes it a decent pivot. However, Galvantula's meager Special Attack hinders its overall damage output. Opting for Life Orb does make up for this, particularly if Galvantula runs Thunder, but doing so means forgoing Heavy-Duty Boots and limiting its staying power. Galvantula also faces competition from other Sticky Web setters in Ribombee and Vikavolt.

The move's accuracy is also boosted by Compound Eyes, substantially increasing its reliability. Energy Ball can be used instead to put more pressure on Rock- and Ground-types like Regirock and Palossand. Heavy-Duty Boots negates the effects of entry hazards, giving Galvantula an easier time switching around and annoying offensive teams. Alternatively, Life Orb can be used to bolster Galvantula's offensive presence, giving it a high chance to OHKO Pokemon like defensive Mesprit with Bug Buzz after Stealth Rock. However, losing immunity to entry hazards and taking Life Orb recoil both decrease its overall longevity. Slower wallbreakers and setup sweepers like Haunter and Nasty Plot Rotom-F very much appreciate Galvantula both slowing down potential revenge killers, like Choice Scarf Passimian, with Sticky Web and generating momentum for them with Volt Switch. Both of these Pokemon also benefit from Galvantula's ability to force damage onto shared checks like Gigalith and Lanturn, and can break through bulkier walls like Galarian Stunfisk and Palossand in return. Rapid Spin users like Tsareena and Kabutops can give Galvantula's teammates easier entry without removing Sticky Web, maintain momentum with their respective pivoting moves, and offensively check Pokemon such as Palossand and Charizard. Support from the previously mentioned spinners can also allow Galvantula to more comfortably use Life Orb.</p> "

U-turn is essential for Passimian's role as a pivot, because Passimian can threaten common defensive Pokemon and force them out, such as Scrafty and Gigalith. Likewise, Knock Off can provide item disruption versus would-be switch-ins that would fear nothing from U-turn such as Ribombee. Rock Slide is the preferable fourth move for its ability to check Flying-types such as Charizard and Scyther. Gunk Shot is a good alternative to have a reliable way to punish Fairy-types such as Silvally-Fairy. Passimian often relies on prediction, as several teams carry solid Fighting checks, especially if facing Pokemon such as Jellicent and Palossand. Therefore, Choice Scarf Passimian partners incredibly well with Vikavolt or Regirock on entry hazard stacking teams that greatly appreciate a fast Pokemon and revenge killer and need methods of deterring Defog. Regirock is able to switch in comfortably versus Fighting-resists such as Charizard, whereas Vikavolt pressures bulky Water-types and can complete a VoltTurn core in order to bring Passimian in safely versus Pokemon such as Gigalith.

    "overview": "<p>With unique access to the powerful Fishious Rend, Arctovish carves itself a niche as a powerful Water-type wallbreaker that can decimate all but the bulkiest Water-resistant Pokemon. Its solid coverage in Crunch and Psychic Fangs allows it to hit standard Water-immune Pokemon, such as Water Absorb Jellicent and Toxicroak. Its additional Ice typing offers coverage against Grass- and Dragon-types such as Tangela and Drudiggon, which can otherwise switch into Fishious Rend at least once and force it out. However, Arctovish has a bad defensive typing with weaknesses to common Fighting- and Grass-type moves, a weakness to Stealth Rock, and no relevant resistances, barring a Water immunity via Water Absorb. This limits its ability to get in and actually begin to wallbreak. It also relies on correct prediction to make progress and cannot do much versus bulky Water-types that aren't weak to its coverage, like Pyukumuku.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Crunch allows Arctovish to hit Jellicent, which can otherwise safely switch into both of its STAB moves even without Water Absorb and threaten to burn it. Psychic Fangs OHKOes Toxicroak and 2HKOes Poliwrath, which hold Water immunites thanks to their respective abilities. An Adamant nature gives Arctovish the most possible power, but a Jolly nature is useful for outspeeding Jolly Aggron. Arctovish hates entry hazards such as Stealth Rock on its side, so it should be paired with Defoggers or deterrents such as Charizard and Xatu. Charizard is able to bait in and cripple bulky Water-types with Toxic, making them easier to wear down, and switch into Grass-types such as Whimsicott, while Xatu can provide momentum with Teleport and extra damage with Future Sight. Arctovish loves entry hazards on the opposing side, though, to further chip down its checks, so partners such as Accelgor and Garbodor are recommended. Garbodor is also able to switch into Fighting-types such as Passimian. Offensive Grass-types such as Whimsicott and Tsareena are solid partners. They are able to threaten out bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Lanturn, while Arctovish is able to hit Fire- and Steel-types such as Charizard and Silvally-Steel, which both Grass-types can pivot it into.</p> "
