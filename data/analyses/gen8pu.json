Pokemon like Sandaconda and Jellicent make for good partners thanks to their ability to take on attackers that force Charizard out like Lycanroc and Basculin, respectively. On sun teams, Solar Power is an option, as it makes Charizard significantly harder to switch into. On such teams, it should forego Hurricane for Solar Beam and run Weather Ball in the fourth moveslot, and Choice Specs is an option over Heavy-Duty Boots.

However, it suffers extreme competition in this role from Pikachu, which boasts Extreme Speed and a greater offensive presence at the expense of some Speed. Fake Out lets Persian get extra damage on the foe without punishment and stall for extra poison damage, letting it follow up with Double-Edge in order to secure KOs on targets like the Silvally formes. Fake Out can also be used to pick off heavily weakened targets that have boosted their Speed, like Fraxure, in a pinch. Knock Off removes items from bulky switch-ins that otherwise disregard anything Persian can do to them, such as Mawile, Dusclops, and Hippopotas, and provides coverage for Ghost-types like Drakloak. U-turn lets Persian keep up momentum for its team, saving it from floundering against bulky foes like Stonjourner, Mawile, and Dusclops. Hypnosis can be used over Knock Off to better cripple switch-ins like Mawile but is unreliable due to its poor accuracy and leaves Persian unable to damage Ghost-types outside of U-turn. Silk Scarf is preferred in order to boost Persian's most important attacks without further cutting into its already limited longevity. Technician is vital in order to let Fake Out deal significant damage.</p> <p>Persian is a good fit for bulky offense teams utilizing Spikes, which help it gradually overwhelm its switch-ins with Spikes damage, Fake Out, and U-turn. Offensive Roselia is an effective Spiker that Persian can bring in on switchins such as Mareanie, Gourgeist, and Dubwool via U-turn to set up Spikes. Roselia can also utilize Sleep Powder to put shared checks like Mawile and Pawniard to sleep. Offensive entry hazard setters like Crustle and Pawniard help weaken foes early-game, and their hazards greatly aid Persian in its role as a revenge killer. Persian can form an effective VoltTurn core with teammates like Manectric, Raichu, and Raboot, all of which can cover Pokemon that can safely switch in on Persian such as Mawile, Stonjourner, and Pawniard. Silvally-Psychic can put offensive pressure on Fighting-types Persian struggles with, such as Throh, Falinks, and Hitmontop, while also threatening to set up and breaking down targets like Mawile to help Persian clean late-game. Mr. Rime can't switch in easily but can pressure Throh and Hitmontop, and its access to hazard control helps keep Persian from being overwhelmed by residual damage. Stacking other priority users like Pawniard and Falinks with Persian can form a powerful anti-setup core that takes pressure off Persian. Both examples also deter Defog with Defiant, making them good choices for teams utilizing Spikes.</p> "

Magneton can effectively take advantage of this thanks to its access to Volt Switch, putting opponents on the back foot while also generating momentum for its teammates.

However, the prevalence of Pokemon such as Lanturn, Lightning Rod Togedemaru, and Galarian Stunfisk makes walling Magneton easier for a lot of teams. Magneton's average Speed also leaves it outsped by common offensive threats like Gallade and Magmortar.

Other pivots such as Passimian and Tsareena pair well with Magneton, since they create a momentum core and help to exert increased pressure on opposing teams. These examples also threaten nuisances like Galarian Stunfisk and offer Knock Off support, while Magneton threatens physically bulky Pokemon like Weezing. Walls like Aromatisse, Weezing, and Gigalith serve as a safety net against faster Fighting- and Fire-types like Passimian and Magmortar that force Magneton out. The former also offers Magneton vital Wish support, while the latter two can wear its switch-ins down with entry hazards, status, and, in Gigalith's case, sand. Pokemon like Sandaconda and Ribombee provide Magneton with speed control in Glare and Stun Spore, respectively, which gives it more opportunities to wallbreak by making it harder to immediately threaten out.

This set fits best on offensive teams in need of both a revenge killer and a pivot. Bear in mind that Magneton doesn't need much support to function, meaning you should add it to teams that benefit from its talents rather than build around it. Magneton struggles with bulky Electric-immune Pokemon such as Lanturn, which is especially problematic given that many of its targets can easily fall back on them. As such, it appreciates having teammates like Tsareena and Whimsicott.

    "overview": "<p>Galarian Articuno is one of PU's best and most dangerous special attackers thanks to its high Special Attack and great offensive typing. Part of what makes Galarian Articuno so threatening is Future Sight, which can severely limit its counterplay. Furthermore, Galarian Articuno is somewhat versatile, capable of serving either as a pivot that wallbreaks for itself and its teammates or a Choice Specs user that can tear through many teams with its power and coverage. Both sets fit on similar teams, which can make it hard to predict what Galarian Articuno is going to do and play around it. Galarian Articuno even has a nice defensive presence because of its decent bulk and recovery, with its typing also providing it useful opportunities to switch in against foes like Tsareena and Mesprit. However, Galarian Articuno can only reliably come in on threats that are weak like Whimsicott or Choice-locked like Mesprit. This is because Pokemon like Weezing, Sandaconda, and Scrafty can either threaten it with status or super effective coverage. Galarian Articuno also struggles to break through bulky Rock- and Steel-types like Gigalith, Aggron, and Galarian Stunfisk, given its lack powerful coverage for them. Finally, due to its middling Speed tier, Galarian Articuno is outpaced and easily pressured by Pokemon such as Archeops and Basculin.</p> ",

Protect is a niche alternative to U-turn that stalls a turn after using Future Sight and allows Galarian Articuno to see what move Choice item users like Sneasel and Togedemaru will lock into. However, U-turn tends to be better, since it maximizes the pressure Future Sight puts on teams. Freezing Glare can be used over Future Sight for an accurate and immediately damaging STAB move, although it's noticeably weaker. Physical wallbreakers such as Hitmontop, Absol, and Trevenant appreciate Future Sight deterring their checks from switching into them and, in return, break through special walls like Gigalith and Articuno. Since many of Galarian Articuno's best checks are grounded, support from entry hazard setters such as Weezing, Ferroseed, and Froslass is very useful. These Pokemon have an easier time keeping their entry hazards up thanks to Galarian Articuno's Competitive discouraging Defog attempts, and the former two can also sponge hits from potential revenge killers like Archeops. Because of its weakness to Knock Off and reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots, Galarian Articuno should never be a team's only way to deal with Fighting-types. More reliable checks to them like Aromatisse, which can also eliminate status with Aromatherapy, are therefore important partners. It's worth noting that Heavy-Duty Boots Galarian Articuno can alternatively serve as a decent setup sweeper with Calm Mind, forgoing U-turn and opting for Freezing Glare instead of Future Sight. Such a set is more self-reliant, since it allows Galarian Articuno to more readily exploit the switches it forces.</p> "

U-turn allows Galarian Articuno to pivot against its switch-ins, but Shadow Ball can be used instead to hit Steel-types for neutral damage and more consistently threaten Psychic-types like Mesprit and opposing Galarian Articuno. Entry hazard control is important, since Stealth Rock prevents Galarian Articuno from freely switching in. Tsareena and Whimsicott are notable removers, since they both threaten common entry hazard setters like Gigalith and Regirock and can use Knock Off to soften shared checks with Galarian Articuno, such as Alolan Sandslash. Tsareena can go one step further by running High Jump Kick to eliminate unsuspecting Steel-types altogether. Another good example is Charizard, which pressures Steel-types and offensively checks faster Pokemon like Ribombee. Particularly, if it lacks Toxic, Charizard also enjoys Galarian Articuno overwhelming its primary switch-in in Gigalith. Setup sweepers like Scrafty and Silvally-Fairy appreciate Galarian Articuno giving them an easier time breaking through teams and finishing them off late-game. They also find Future Sight dissuading their checks and counters from switching in very useful, since this can translate to either a forced KO or more turns to set up.</p> "

It is also notable for having a decent matchup against spinners such as Hitmontop and Galarian Mr. Mime depending on its coverage. However, Solrock suffers from competition with other Stealth Rock setters such as Mawile and Palpitoad, both of which have a better typing and are easier to fit on teams. Mawile has access to Intimidate and plenty of really good resistances such as Ice, Grass, and Flying while Palpitoad has two great immunities in Electric and Water. Rock Slide gives Solrock a better matchup against common entry hazard removers like Mr. Rime, whereas Zen Headbutt is another option that helps against Fighting-types such as Throh and Falinks. Toxic can be an option over Will-O-Wisp to wear down bulkier Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL and Beheeyem, but in a lot of cases, Solrock needs the opposing Pokemon burned to check it easily. Colbur Berry can be used to check Throh, which it can't cripple with Will-O-Wisp, more easily. However, Solrock otherwise prefers the passive recovery from Leftovers.</p> <p>Solrock struggles a lot against Dark-types such as Pawniard and Thievul, so Fighting-types like Throh, Falinks, and Hitmontop make really good teammates for it. They also benefit from Solrock's unique typing, since they tend to struggle against Psychic- and Flying-types such as Defog Silvally-Psychic and Vespiquen that Solrock has no trouble checking. Falinks can offensively check Swords Dance Silvally-Psychic and Ludicolo variants thanks to First Impression. Offensive Grass- and Water-types such as Silvally-Grass and Basculin can easily pressure Solrock, so bulky Grass-types such as Gourgeist and Roselia are recommended teammates for it. Solrock can also switch into Fire- and Flying-types such as Raboot and Vespiquen for Roselia and Gourgeist. Although Solrock has good Defense, its Special Defense is bad, so special walls such as Dusclops and Type: Null work well as teammates, since both of them can switch fairly well into wallbreakers that pressure Solrock like Ludicolo and Glaceon.</p> "

It has access to Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, making it a solid choice for either a Stealth Rock setter or a defensive spinner, although it cannot threaten most Ghost-types. Its typing and Levitate give it important resistances to Poison-, Psychic-, and Rock-type moves, letting it pivot into these moves from Pokemon such as Weezing, Mesprit, and Aggron, as well as two important immunities to Electric and Ground; these make it a stop to Volt Switch pivots and Pokemon locked into Earthquake in a pinch, as it fares badly against most of them otherwise. However, Claydol is very passive, heavily relying on Toxic to maintain a presence. It is forced to choose between two STAB moves that are exploitable, meaning it can struggle against foes such as Golbat and Togedemaru depending on the move it chooses. Its typing is also a double-edged sword, with weaknesses to Grass, Dark, Water, and Bug, making it easy to exploit by Pokemon such as Tsareena and Absol, and many of the Pokemon it would like to check can run these moves. Claydol also lacks recovery if it forgoes Leftovers, meaning it can be hard to check what it wants to over a long match.</p> ",

Teleport allows Claydol to gain momentum against Pokemon it forces out such as Choice-locked Togedemaru. Alternatively, Protect and Leftovers give Claydol more recovery, increase Toxic damage, and scout opposing Choice-locked Pokemon. However, this gives it a worse matchup against Knock Off users such as Absol and Gallade due to the lack of Colbur Berry. The Speed investment is to guarantee outspeeding fully invested base 80s after a Rapid Spin, such as Gallade and Mesprit, crippling them with a Toxic before they can respond. Claydol likes to have defensive support from Pokemon that can handle special attackers like Rotom, Charizard, and Basculin. Lanturn can take hits from all of them and cripple them with Toxic, and Assault Vest Lanturn specifically can soak up general special hits for Claydol. Ferroseed is another option, functioning as a Toxic sponge that can also check Grass- and Water-types. In return, Claydol can reduce the chip damage Lanturn takes with Rapid Spin and deal with Ground-types such as Sandaconda for both of them. Claydol often best fits on more defensive teams due to its lack of recovery, supportive capabilities, and lacking offensive presence; as such, it appreciates the cleric and Wish support Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Audino can give it.</p> "

Roost gives Vespiquen a reliable recovery option, and allows for more chances to stall moves like Silvally-Psychic's  Multi-Attack with Pressure. Defog and Pressure pair nicely together, as this means you can PP stall Toxic Spikes and Spikes from Mareanie and Roselia for the entirety of the game. Alternatively, Toxic Spikes cripples foes, while Aromatherapy lets Vespiquen function as a cleric. Vespiquen’s Speed alongside U-turn is excellent for slow pivoting, giving you ample opportunities to bring in wallbreakers.

Palpitoad is very notable as a partner; it resists Rock, checks Pawniard, and handles Fire- and Electric-types like Raboot and Manectric, while Vespiquen checks Grass-types in return. Vespiquen's reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots means it is not optimal to have its item removed by Knock Off unless you are using Acrobatics, so Knock Off absorbers like Rocky Helmet Mawile, Silvally formes, Colbur Berry Musharna, and Throh make it easier for Vespiquen to not be affected by Stealth Rock damage. Strong wallbreakers that can break Rock- and Ice-types, like Falinks, Silvally formes, and Stonjourner, appreciate the safety from slow U-turn pivoting; Vespiquen benefits from the removal of such Pokemon, since it makes it much easier for it to use Defog.

Frost Breath can allow Glaceon to get past bulky Calm Mind and Cosmic Power users like Musharna and Gothitelle in a pinch, but the move is virtually useless outside of this one purpose and cuts into Glaceon's already limited coverage. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Falinks and Choice Band Fraxure as well as Speed tie with offensive Roselia. Glaceon could opt to use Choice Scarf to act as a revenge killer rather than a wallbreaker. Although this allows Glaceon to take care of +1 Adamant Fraxure and circumvent typical offensive checks like Silvally-Grass and Raichu, such a set severely reduces Glaceon's power and faces serious competition from Mr. Rime and Galarian Mr. Mime due to their higher Speed tiers, better coverage, and access to Healing Wish.</p> <p>Glaceon's low Speed and poor defensive typing make it very easy to offensively pressure, so it appreciates having bulky teammates to fall back on in the face of faster Fire-, Fighting-, and Rock-types. Vibrava gives Glaceon an easier time switching in by removing entry hazards with Defog and generating momentum with U-turn. It's worth noting that a lot of Pokemon that Vibrava baits in and pivots out against, like Gloom and Togetic, find themselves easily exploited by Glaceon. Mareanie absorbs Toxic Spikes upon switching in, can wear teams down with its own Toxic Spikes, and also softens up bulky foes that depend on their item, like Type: Null and Lapras, with Knock Off. Although Glaceon is strong, it lacks the coverage to bypass dedicated Ice-type answers such as Munchlax and Klang.

This immunity to entry hazards, alongside Glaceon's higher Special Attack and natural defenses, helps to separate it from Togetic, another cleric that similarly has access to Wish and Heal Bell. Although Glaceon has higher Defense than Special Defense, its poor defensive typing is easily exploited by many of the tier's physical attackers, including Mawile, Falinks, and Silvally-Rock.

Pyukumuku can also absorb Knock Off as well as wall setup sweepers like Falinks and Crustle that threaten Glaceon thanks to Unaware. In return, Glaceon can relieve Pyukumuku of any potential status conditions, which is especially useful for Rest variants. Stronger special attackers like Beheeyem and Raichu are capable of overwhelming Glaceon, meaning that it should never be the only special wall on balance teams. Other specially bulky Pokemon such as Type: Null, Dusclops, Vibrava, and Munchlax make for great partners because of this, with Rest allowing all three examples to soak up status conditions for Glaceon as well. Glaceon allows these examples to rely less on Rest by providing them with Wish support. Checks to Fighting-types are useful partners, since they can often switch into Glaceon with ease. Mareanie is a notable example, since it can consistently check Fighting-types thanks to both Recover and Regenerator, further wears teams down through Scald and either Toxic or Toxic Spikes, takes pressure off of Glaceon's team by absorbing Toxic Spikes, and stops setup sweepers like Falinks in their tracks with Haze.</p> "

Electric / Ghost is a near unresisted typing, bar some exceptions such as Drampa and Shiftry, all of which can be pivoted out against with Volt Switch. Defensively, Rotom resists or is immune to various common attacks from Pokemon such as Scyther and Passimian, although has to watch out for common coverage moves such as Knock Off. Rotom's Speed allows it to outspeed threatening breakers such as Nasty Plot Mesprit and Magmortar and for its Choice Scarf set to outspeed other common Choice Scarf users like Passimian and Mesprit. There are other Electric- and Ghost-types that give it competition as a Choice Scarf user, such as Togedemaru with its higher Speed and valuable Steel typing, and Haunter with its higher Speed and Special Attack alongside support moves such as Destiny Bond. However, Rotom's unique type combination and access to both Trick and Volt Switch make it a great option over the other two.</p> ",

While Mesprit is a solid wallbreaker and has the speed to beat out slower offensive and defensive staples like Tsareena and Weezing, it's still outpaced by a large portion of the metagame.

Furthermore, Mesprit's special coverage can be lacking at times, as Mesprit can struggle against Steel-types such as Aggron and Togedemaru.

Tsareena is a good partner because it can use U-turn to bring Mesprit in for easy setup opportunities on Pokemon such as Weezing.

Mesprit's best qualities are its good speed for a Stealth Rock setter and favorable matchup against several entry hazard removers such as Golbat and Hitmontop.

Few weaknesses and access to U-turn allow Mesprit to keep up momentum in a way few Stealth Rock users can, making it an ideal pick for more offensive teams. Its inability to deal much damage to special walls or Steel-types means that wallbreakers such as Trevenant and Charizard make for good partners. Mesprit appreciates Pokemon that can punish U-turn, such as Rocky Helmet Druddigon and Coalossal, which can discourage Pokemon like Togedemaru from freely pivoting versus Mesprit. Mesprit can also opt for a more defensively oriented spread that runs both U-turn and Healing Wish while foregoing Dazzling Gleam.

Basculin welcomes entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ferroseed and Mesprit, which enables it to increase its wallbreaking capabilities. Mesprit, in addition to the aforementioned Heliolisk, can also form a VoltTurn core with Basculin, giving Basculin additional opportunities to come onto the field safely.

Scrafty's typing also has its ups and downs offensively, as it is able to hit most of the tier neutrally, but Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Silvally-Fairy completely wall it if it is not running coverage.

However, the supportive capabilities of Toxic Spikes are generally preferred due to these Pokemon being uncommon, and Toxic Spikes is more useful during the early- and mid-game stages. Despite Chesto Berry usually being run to give Cofagrigus a one-time instant recovery option alongside Rest, running no item makes it harder to pressure with Poltergeist and Knock Off users such as Froslass, Gourgeist-S, and Passimian. The Speed investment lets it outspeed Galarian Stunfisk, and the remaining EVs combined with a Bold nature bolster Cofagrigus's physical bulk, which improves its durability and the damage output of Body Press.

Archeops fits best on offensive teams, and it should primarily be brought in via safe switches in to wallbreak or revenge kill threats such as Galarian Articuno and Magmortar, as its lack of defensive utility prevents it from getting many free turns otherwise. For this reason, partners with pivoting moves like Ribombee and Whimsicott work well with Archeops, and they form a pivot core if Archeops is using U-turn. Lanturn is another partner that can bring Archeops in safely, and it can absorb both Water- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Archeops as well as provide an additional check to Togedemaru. Froslass can help pressure many of Archeops's checks, like Palossand and Rhydon thanks to its access to Spikes, notably bringing walls like Jellicent into 2HKO range of Stone Edge.

This is because of them being more potent offensively, more reliably checking Throh, having reliable recovery, and generating momentum in Beheeyem's case. In spite of this, Gothitelle can still function as a solid bulky setup sweeper due to its decent bulk with investment, Cosmic Power further augmenting its defenses, and Stored Power allowing it to make excellent use of the boosts it accrues. Teams lacking Dark-types can struggle with Gothitelle, since even specially bulky Pokemon and Psychic-resistant Pokemon, such as Dusclops, Type: Null, and Silvally-Psychic, take too much damage after enough boosts. Stored Power also bypasses Pyukumuku's Unaware, meaning Gothitelle can be a major threat to stall teams. Leftovers lessens the need to use Rest and provides Gothitelle with passive recovery, while Colbur Berry reduces the damage that it takes from Dark-type coverage against foes like Grapploct. Competitive exploits moves and abilities that drop Gothitelle's stats, like Defog and Intimidate, by boosting its Special Attack and making Stored Power stronger. Moves like Mean Look and Thunderbolt can be used over Sleep Talk to trap and set up on passive foes or hit Dark-types, respectively, though forgoing Sleep Talk leaves Gothitelle completely helpless while it's asleep. Weakness Policy allows Gothitelle to take advantage of super effective coverage like Knock Off from Throh and U-turn from non-Swords Dance Silvally formes.

Strong attackers like Silvally-Bug, Choice Specs Glaceon, and Nasty Plot Raichu can overwhelm Gothitelle faster than it can boost, meaning that teammates to pressure these wallbreakers, like Lapras and Roselia, are appreciated. Roselia can also pressure opposing teams with Spikes and Toxic Spikes, making it easier for Gothitelle to sweep. Silvally formes like Silvally-Bug and Silvally-Electric can also be useful partners, providing support through blocking Trick and Switcheroo from Mr. Mime and Manectric, breaking through foes like Mawile, and potentially removing entry hazards with Defog. In return, Gothitelle can absorb status conditions and set up on potential revenge killers like Manectric locked into Overheat.

Thunderbolt devastates Water-types while serving as Meowstic-F's best method of hitting Dark- and Steel-types such as Pawniard, Thievul, Mawile, and Klang. Protect provides valuable utility, allowing Meowstic-F to block First Impression from Fraxure and Falinks while letting it scout for moves from Choice item users such as Manectric and Stonjourner and gain additional recovery if running Leftovers. Shadow Ball is a notable mention over Protect, allowing Meowstic-F to threaten opposing Psychic-types. Colbur Berry provides a one-time damage reduction against Dark-type moves, allowing Meowstic-F to potentially stay in against Pawniard and Thievul to retaliate with Thunderbolt while also reducing the damage from Throh's Knock Off and Falink's Throat Chop. Leftovers can be utilized over Colbur Berry to offer recovery, extending Meowstic-F's longevity. Competitive, in tandem with its naturally high Speed tier, allows Meowstic-F to outspeed and punish Defog from the various Silvally formes and other slower Defoggers such as Vibrava and Vespiquen.</p> <p>Fighting-types such as Falinks, Throh, and Hitmontop appreciate Meowstic-F removing Poison-types such as Mareanie, Gloom, and Roselia that limit their effectiveness. In return, they are able to eliminate Dark- and Steel-types such as Pawniard, Thievul, and Klang that trouble Meowstic-F. Steel-types such as Mawile and Pawniard can help Meowstic-F by offering Stealth Rock support, wearing down opposing foes, and by serving as soft checks to Bug-types like Crustle and Silvally-Bug. Setup sweepers such as Klang, Eiscue, and Thievul can benefit from Meowstic-F removing Fighting-types, letting them set up and sweep late-game. Entry hazard setters such as Crustle and Roselia appreciate Meowstic-F's ability to punish Defog from Silvally formes to reliably get up their hazards, providing valuable residual damage that can make up for Meowstic-F's mediocre Special Attack stat.</p> "

Aromatisse is reliant on Wish to keep itself healthy, forcing it to use Protect very often, which can be a huge momentum drain.

In return, Aromatisse can cleanse Drampa of status and give it easier entry with Wish support. Weezing and Jellicent can help provide a secondary Fighting-type check, better handling Triple Axel Hitmontop, and can check offensive breakers like Aggron and Swords Dance Qwilfish, respectively.

Chief among these qualities is Natural Cure, which allows it to more comfortably switch into status inducers like Quagsire and Glare Sandaconda. Furthermore, Trevenant can heal while attacking with Horn Leech, which isn't weather-dependent like Synthesis, and isn't weak to Stealth Rock like Froslass. However, Trevenant lacks the bulk and longevity necessary to make full use of these good traits. While it outspeeds most defensive Pokemon, Trevenant is still incredibly slow, which, combined with its frailty and poor defensive typing, makes it easy to pressure and limits its opportunities to safely switch in. Trevenant also faces competition as a Ghost-type wallbreaker from Gourgeist-S and Froslass, since both are faster, the former is more versatile with moves like Explosion and Flame Charge, and the latter offers vital utility in Spikes.</p> ",

Sucker Punch is another option that allows Trevenant to make up for its lackluster Speed, but it's prediction-reliant and not a good move to be locked into. While Frisk lets Trevenant scout for items and whether foes can be hit by Poltergeist, not being rendered useless by status thanks to Natural Cure is usually more useful. Using an Adamant nature maximizes Trevenant's damage output, but opting for a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed Pokemon like Jolly Aggron and Arctovish. Despite being incredibly strong, Trevenant can still struggle to take care of some physical walls like Tangela. Therefore, powerful special attackers such as Galarian Articuno and Charizard are good teammates. The former can also use U-turn to get Trevenant in safely and put immense pressure on Trevenant's answers with Future Sight, while the latter can remove entry hazards with Defog. Entry hazard support helps to wear down annoying physical walls too. In particular, Spikes setters like Alolan Sandslash can be incredibly useful, helping Trevenant guarantee 2HKOs against Pokemon like Ferroseed with Poltergeist. Avoid pairing Trevenant with Knock Off users, since they'll prevent it from as freely using Poltergeist.</p> "

Runerigus is also capable of being a setup sweeper to become less passive and take advantage of Pokemon like Toxic Regirock expecting to just wear it down. However, its typing leaves it vulnerable to common wallbreakers like Tsareena and Froslass. It also faces heavy competition from Palossand, which has similar defensive qualities and reliable recovery, although it lacks Toxic Spikes and is generally more one-dimensional. Cofagrigus rivals Runerigus as a bulky setup sweeper with its typing and is better at keeping up Toxic Spikes, as it can safely spinblock Tsareena. However, Runerigus is able to fit Amnesia more easily.</p> ",

Leftovers provides passive recovery, while Colbur Berry lets Runerigus switch into Knock Off users like Passimian and Sawk comfortably. Earthquake hits Magmortar and Charizard using Roost, but Body Press can be used for more damage against switch-ins like Tsareena and Scrafty while still hitting typical Earthquake targets like Regirock and Gigalith. Will-O-Wisp cripples Archeops and deters Swords Dance Silvally formes. Toxic Spikes lets Runerigus spread more status and support setup sweepers like Charizard and Gallade. Poltergeist is an alternative to hit Pokemon like Whimsicott and Ribombee as well as opposing Ghost-types like Haunter. Rest gives Runerigus some form of recovery and pairs nicely with clerics like Aromatisse and Lanturn that can reliably beat special attackers such as Charizard and Magmortar that Runerigus struggles against. Aromatisse can also deal with Scrafty and provides Wish support for it.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Runerigus is able to further push its defensive capabilities with Iron Defense and Amnesia to become a durable setup sweeper. Full Defense investment maximizes Body Press's power, but a specially defensive spread can be used to more comfortably boost against Galvantula and Charizard. Rest is Runerigus's only means of recovery and prevents it from being worn down by Toxic. Body Press allows it to capitalize on Iron Defense further and hit extremely hard. Leftovers provides passive recovery to lessen the need to use Rest, but Chesto Berry can be used for a free Rest and to have an easier time snowballing. Runerigus is completely walled by opposing Ghost-types like Froslass and Haunter with this set, so it benefits from Dark-types like Scrafty and Absol to pressure them. Weezing can spread burns to give Runerigus more setup opportunities and use Toxic Spikes to prevent Ghost-types like Palossand and Gourgeist from stalling it out. Fighting-types like Passimian and Gallade can check opposing Dark- and Ice-types like Absol and Arctovish and draw in bulky Pokemon like Quagsire and Sandaconda that Runerigus can use as setup fodder. Runerigus is also vulnerable to Pokemon such as Tsareena and Choice Specs Whimsicott that can break past it before it can boost high enough, so offensive checks to them like Charizard and Silvally-Steel are appreciated.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Eiscue's unique Ability in Ice Face and access to Belly Drum make it a threatening, albeit matchup dependent, late-game sweeper. Reversal is an 80-Base Power attack after Eiscue uses Substitute and Belly Drum, providing great neutral coverage alongside Eiscue's Ice STAB and letting it take down Steel-type Pokemon it otherwise couldn't, such as Mawile, Pawniard, and Klang, as well as Lapras. Zen Headbutt sacrifices hitting those target in order to cover Mareanie, which otherwise walls Eiscue. Liquidation is a niche option that deals more damage to the aforementioned targets before Eiscue is set up. Substitute provides Eiscue with protection from status and revenge killing, and lets it activate its Salac Berry after using Belly Drum, outspeeding most of the unboosted metagame even if Ice Face hasn't been activated and outrunning even the fastest boosted Pokemon, like Choice Scarf Manectric and Quick Feet Galarian Linoone, if it has been activated. Belly Drum brings Eiscue's otherwise mediocre Attack stat to ridiculous levels, making it vital to sweeping. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed investment is used to let Eiscue outspeed fast Pokemon like Leafeon and Silvally at +1 if Ice Face isn't activated.</p> <p>Eiscue fits best on offensive teams that can break through its defensive answers. If Eiscue isn't running Zen Headbutt, teammates that can take on Mareanie are absolutely vital. Good examples of these teammates include Electric-type Pokemon like Manectric and Raichu and Psychic-type Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Musharna, and Mr. Rime, the latter of which can also remove entry hazards. Roselia can use Spikes or Toxic Spikes to help wear down the opponent's defensive backbone, check Water-types, put opposing Pokemon to sleep to provide Eiscue with more setup opportunities, and removes Toxic Spikes, which would otherwise shut Eiscue down. If Eiscue isn't running Reversal, teammates that can take on Steel-types are important. Falinks and Hitmontop are good at pressuring foes like Mawile, Klang, and Pawniard offensively, with Falinks fitting very well on hyper offense and Hitmontop offering hazard removal and reliable priority. The aforementioned Psychic-types are also great options for wearing down Steel-types, as most teams rely on those Pokemon to take them on, with Mr. Rime, Mr. Mime, and Musharna giving Eiscue a safe switch and a second chance at setting up via Healing Wish. Pivots such as the aforementioned Electric-type Pokemon, Silvally formes, and Drakloak can be useful for getting Eiscue on the field safely against Pokemon that it threatens, like Roselia, or that can't bypass Ice Face, as is the case for most physical attackers lacking Knock Off. Stonjourner makes for a strong lead option on offense that can provide Stealth Rock support and threaten several of Eiscue's answers with Earthquake. Other setup sweepers, like Fraxure, Pawniard, and the previously mentioned Falinks and Raichu, are effective at softening the opponent's defensive backbone for Eiscue. Wallbreakers like Swords Dance Mawile, Throh, and Choice Band Fraxure are effective teammates for the same purpose, with the former two being able to use Knock Off on sturdy answers to Eiscue, like Mareanie and Klang, that rely on their Eviolite to function effectively.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>With unique access to the powerful Fishious Rend, Arctovish carves itself a niche as a powerful Water-type wallbreaker that can decimate all but the bulkiest Water-resistant Pokemon. Its solid coverage in Crunch and Psychic Fangs allows it to hit standard Water-immune Pokemon, such as Water Absorb Jellicent and Toxicroak. Its additional Ice typing offers coverage against Grass- and Dragon-types such as Tangela and Drudiggon, which can otherwise switch into Fishious Rend at least once and force it out. However, Arctovish has a bad defensive typing with weaknesses to common Fighting- and Grass-type moves, a weakness to Stealth Rock, and no relevant resistances, barring a Water immunity via Water Absorb. This limits its ability to get in and actually begin to wallbreak. It also relies on correct prediction to make progress and cannot do much versus bulky Water-types that aren't weak to its coverage, like Pyukumuku.</p> ",

Psychic Fangs OHKOes Toxicroak and 2HKOes Poliwrath, which hold Water immunites thanks to their respective abilities. An Adamant nature gives Arctovish the most possible power, but a Jolly nature is useful for outspeeding Jolly Aggron. Arctovish hates entry hazards such as Stealth Rock on its side, so it should be paired with Defoggers or deterrents such as Charizard and Xatu. Charizard is able to bait in and cripple bulky Water-types with Toxic, making them easier to wear down, and switch into Grass-types such as Whimsicott, while Xatu can provide momentum with Teleport and extra damage with Future Sight. Arctovish loves entry hazards on the opposing side, though, to further chip down its checks, so partners such as Accelgor and Garbodor are recommended. Garbodor is also able to switch into Fighting-types such as Passimian. Offensive Grass-types such as Whimsicott and Tsareena are solid partners. They are able to threaten out bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Lanturn, while Arctovish is able to hit Fire- and Steel-types such as Charizard and Silvally-Steel, which both Grass-types can pivot it into.</p> "
