    "comments": "<h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Astrolotl and Ceruledge</strong>: Specially defensive Astrolotl is Iron Moth's most common counter, stomaching even its sun-boosted Choice Specs Tera Fire Overheat and threatening to KO it back with Stomping Tantrum. In combination with a Poison-resistant Pokemon like Venomicon, Iron Moth can cede crucial momentum, providing the opponent with an opportunity for a comeback. Flash Fire Ceruledge is Iron Moth's hardest counter, being immune to Overheat and Fiery Dance,  resistant to Solar Beam and Sludge Wave, and able to strike back with a boosted Shadow Sneak. However, Iron Moth can run Tera Ground + Tera Blast specifically to circumvent these counters.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock wears down Iron Moth exceptionally quickly. This is particularly notable with its Choice Specs set, which needs to switch out often to reset Overheat's Special Attack drops.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Sucker Punch Kingambit and Extreme Speed Dragonite can prey on Iron Moth's weak physical defense. Kingambit must be wary of Tera Fairy Iron Moth, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes: Roaring Moon, Cinderace, Meowscarada, Greninja, and Psyshock Iron Valiant can pick off Iron Moth before it can respond.</p> <p><strong>Special Tanks: Clodsire, Skeledirge, Arghonaut, and Ting-Lu can easily tank most moves from Booster Energy Iron Moth, but they are 2HKOed by its sun-boosted Choice Specs Overheat with any prior damage or if it Terastallizes.</p> <p><strong>Rain Teams: Pelipper can override Jumbao's sun with rain, which weakens Iron Moth's best attacks. Floatzel and Quaquaval hit Iron Moth's weak physical defense.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Specs Iron Moth is the strongest wallbreaker available for sun teams. Its Tera Fire Overheat under sun can 2HKO Arghonaut and Skeledirge, two of the best special walls in the metagame, and still deal massive damage to frailer targets at -2. Solar Beam more reliably 2HKOes Arghonaut, Toxapex, and Garganacl so that Iron Moth isn't required to Terastallize to be effective. Fiery Dance lets Iron Moth snowball and end games once the opposing team has no remaining Unaware users and is sufficiently weakened. Sludge Wave 2HKOes Astrolotl and Dragonite and OHKOes Cinderace outside of sun, which could otherwise tank an Overheat and pivot around the weakened hit. Ground-type Tera Blast OHKOes Ceruledge, Astrolotl, Skeledirge, and opposing Iron Moth with a surprise hit.</p> <p>Drought Jumbao is a required teammate to set up sun. Healing Wish can help Iron Moth offset Stealth Rock damage and get into battle late-game. Other Protosynthesis users like Roaring Moon and Great Tusk fit fantastically alongside Iron Moth. Roaring Moon's Choice Band-boosted attacks complement Iron Moth's strong special attacks, and its U-turn can bring Iron Moth in safely against a Fairy- or Steel-type switch-in. Great Tusk can remove entry hazards and switch into strong physical attackers like Roaring Moon and Kingambit. In return, Iron Moth very easily switches into Jumbao, one of Great Tusk's hard counters. Eject Button Hatterene is a fantastic teammate that helps keep Stealth Rock off the field and give Iron Moth a crucial free switch.</p> "

        "name": "Booster Energy",
        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Booster Energy Iron Moth fits best on hyper offense teams where Booster Energy's one-time use can be easily justified. Although it faces some competition  from Quiver Dance Volcarona, its instant power and higher natural Speed tier gives it a niche over Volcarona. Fiery Dance allows Iron Moth to snowball quickly, while Sludge Wave forces Arghonaut and Garganacl to think twice before Terastallizing into a Fairy-type. Energy Ball 2HKOes Arghonaut, Krilowatt, and Garganacl, but Psychic maintains coverage against Arghonaut while pressuring Venomicon, Dragapult, and Clodsire harder. Ground-type Tera Blast allows Iron Moth to push past Skeledirge, Astrolotl, Clodsire, and Ceruledge, which would otherwise give it serious trouble. Dazzling Gleam is best when Iron Moth is Tera Fairy, hitting Roaring Moon and Dragapult more effectively. Tera Fairy allows Iron Moth to stomach Roaring Moon's STAB moves and Kingambit's Sucker Punch, removing them for a surprise KO. Agility helps Iron Moth sweep better, but it displaces a coverage move and is generally outclassed by Volcarona as a setup sweeper. Tera Grass is the best option, turning Iron Moth's severe Ground weakness into a resistance and boosting Energy Ball. An EV spread of 124 Def / 132 SpA / 252 Spe can be used so that Booster Energy raises Iron Moth's Speed, but the drop in power is noticeable. Booster Energy Iron Moth can also fit on sun teams to thwart typical counterplay to its Choice Specs set. Solar Beam should be run to OHKO specially defensive Garganacl at +1 and with Quark Drive active. However, Choice Specs is usually more effective against unprepared teams.</p> <p>Iron Moth fits excellently on hyper offense teams. Entry hazard setters like Meowscarada, Greninja, and Garchomp enable Iron Moth to net KOs more easily. Rapid Spin users like Caribolt and Great Tusk remove Stealth Rock to help Iron Moth leverage its good special bulk. Other hyper offense sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, Swords Dance Iron Valiant, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Scale Shot + Swords Dance Miasmaw tend to struggle with Jumbao, which Iron Moth can help deal with. Supreme Overlord Kingambit can clean up games after Iron Moth has broken holes and fainted.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Caribolt is a nuclear wallbreaker for offensive teams. Double-Edge with Galvanize can break through even the tier's most stalwart walls, 2HKOing Pokemon like Skeledirge and Garganacl with ease, especially once Caribolt Terastallizes. Horn Leech provides some modicum of recovery to compensate for Double-Edge's recoil. Rapid Spin both increases Caribolt's Speed, giving it sweeping potential, and supports teammates weak to Stealth Rock like Baxcalibur and Iron Moth, allowing them to forego Heavy-Duty Boots. Leftovers helps make up for Double-Edge's recoil alongside Horn Leech, while Magnet powers up Caribolt's Electric-type attacks even further. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Choice Scarf Jumbao at +1 Speed and Krilowatt at +0, but Adamant is an option to deal as much damage as possible, supporting its hyper offense teammates. Tera Grass is an option to turn Ground-types like Equilibra and Great Tusk into setup fodder, but Caribolt's main focus should be on wallbreaking as much as possible for its teammates.</p> <p>Caribolt is best utilized on hyper offense teams, which appreciate its incredible wallbreaking ability. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Iron Moth, Baxcalibur, and Venomicon-E appreciate Caribolt removing the hazard, allowing Iron Moth and Baxcalibur to run more offensive items over Heavy-Duty Boots. Other physical sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and Dragonite love Caribolt powering through Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Arghonaut; Roaring Moon pairs particularly well with Caribolt, as it can threaten the Grass-types like Jumbao and Amoonguss that give Caribolt trouble with Tera Flying + Acrobatics. This love is shared by special sweepers like Iron Valiant and Hatterene, which need Skeledirge off the table before attempting a sweep. Caribolt appreciates entry hazards weakening physically bulky Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu—which can beat Caribolt if it Terastallizes—into KO range of its attacks, so pairing it with a dedicated lead like Greninja or Meowscarada is suggested.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Equilibra's solid typing, great stats, and access to Rapid Spin make it one of the premier defensive pivots and entry hazard removers in the metagame. Bulletproof is the recommended ability, as it blocks Focus Blast from Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Jumbao and Shadow Ball from Ghost-types such as Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark. Alternatively, Levitate drastically improves Equilibra's matchups against opposing Ground-types, such as Clodsire and Garchomp, while also presenting more opportunities to clear entry hazards without worrying about taking Spikes damage. Protect allows Equilibra to scout the foe's moves and get additional healing from Leftovers, while Pain Split gives it an alternative form of recovery, lowering its reliance on Leftovers. Alternatively, Aura Sphere allows Equilibra to beat opposing Levitate Equilibra and improves its matchup against Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Colossoil. The given EV spread allows Equilibra to avoid an OHKO from Choice Specs Greninja's Hydro Pump, survive the combination of Moonblast into Close Combat from mixed Tera Fairy Iron Valiant, and outspeed Adamant Breloom after getting a Speed boost from Rapid Spin. Tera Flying flips Equilibra's matchups against Fighting-types such as Great Tusk and Breloom on their heads while allowing Bulletproof Equilibra to safely stay in against opposing Ground-types. Alternatively, Tera Water allows Equilibra to check Fire-types such as Iron Moth, Astrolotl, Skeledirge, and Volcarona.</p> <p>Equilibra struggles against Water- and Flying-types, so Electric-types such as Caribolt, Iron Hands, and Plasmanta make for great partners. Water-types such as Arghonaut and Rotom-W synergize well with Equilibra, since they can switch in on Fire-type attacks aimed at it; they, in turn, appreciate Equilibra's ability to absorb Electric-type attacks and pressure Jumbao, one of their greatest threats. Venomicon is one of the best defensive partners for Equilibra, since it walls many of the Fighting- and Ground-types that Equilibra struggles against such as Great Tusk; in return, Equilibra deals with Pokemon that Venomicon struggles against, such as Stratagem and Hatterene. Equilibra relies heavily on Leftovers for recovery, so it appreciates support from teammates that don't mind taking Knock Off, like Corviknight and Toxapex. Thanks to Equilibra's ability to consistently keep entry hazards off the field, it works well with teammates that are worn down by them, such as Snaelstrom, Iron Moth, and Loaded Dice Baxcalibur.</p> "
