        "description": "<p>Hisuian Arcanine serves as a formidable revenge killer and, if it's running Stealth Rock, entry hazard setter while also packing solid defensive utility thanks to having Intimidate before Mega Evolving, allowing it to soft check the likes of Weavile and Altarianite Regieleki. Altarianite grants Hisuian Arcanine access to Pixilate Extreme Speed, which lets it revenge kill common offensive staples such as Dragonite, Urshifu-R, and Hisuian Samurott. Stealth Rock lets Hisuian Arcanine set entry hazards and pressure hazard removers such as Corviknight and Metagrossite Great Tusk looking to come in. Stone Edge lets it threaten foes that resist its STAB moves, notably targeting Ho-Oh, Pinsirite Gouging Fire, and opposing Hisuian Arcanine. The given EVs let it outpace uninvested Solgaleo. Hisuian Arcanine struggles against bulky Water-types such as Arceus-Water and Toxapex, making teammates that can threaten them such as Raging Bolt, Raikou, and Zapdos appreciated. Other defensive staples such as Eternatus, Garganacl, and Red Orb Hippowdon trouble Hisuian Arcanine, so teammates that can reliably pressure these such as Landorus, Great Tusk, and Arceus-Ground are also appreciated. Defensive teammates such as Eternatus, Solgaleo, and Corviknight appreciate Hisuian Arcanine's ability to take on threats such as Magearna, Ho-Oh, and Weavile. Hisuian Arcanine dislikes entry hazards, so allies that can remove them such as Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Great Tusk are necessary.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its significant bulk, amazing typing, and access to U-turn and utility moves such as Defog and Roost, Corviknight functions incredibly as a defensive pivot and entry hazard remover. Sablenite makes Corviknight incredibly slow, improving its pivoting capabilities, and also gives it Magic Bounce, which can reflect hazards used by Pokemon like Arceus-Ground and Garganacl as well as Taunt from Deoxys-S, ensuring Corviknight can heal itself with Roost and keep its teammates such as Gouging Fire, Urshifu-R, and Raging Bolt from being chipped. U-turn helps provide momentum and allows safe switch-ins to frail attackers such as Nasty Plot Deoxys-S and Iron Boulder, which can threaten to sweep when positioned correctly. Brave Bird is used to deal decent damage against Fighting-types like Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos at the cost of recoil, while Body Press deals super effective damage versus the likes of Chien-Pao, Garganacl, and Iron Boulder but does less damage to neutral targets. Corviknight has a great matchup against many Pokemon, including Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Urshifu-R, thanks to its defensive traits and ability to bring in Pokemon like Hisuian Arcanine and Walking Wake to dispose of these threats. Some significant threats to Corviknight include Electric-types like Zapdos, Sandy Shocks, and Supercell Slam Regieleki as well as Fire-types such as Gouging Fire and Red Orb users like Landorus and Raging Bolt. Dragon-types like Eternatus and Arceus-Dragon are thus good teammates for their ability to handle the majority of Pokemon with these typings with ease. Corviknight can also be paired with Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, whose Judgment can threaten every relevant Electric- and Fire-type in the metagame bar Zapdos, which is threatened by Ice Beam. Additionally, Fire-types like Gouging Fire and non-Electric-type Red Orb users can be countered by Garganacl and Earth Power Arceus-Water.</p>"

Meteor Beam allows Eternatus to lure in and OHKO Ho-Oh while providing extra firepower, and Fire Blast threatens Steel-types like Corviknight, Magearna, and Solgaleo, whereas Flamethrower is a weaker but more consistent alternative. Sludge Bomb nails Fairy-types like Arceus-Fairy, Altarianite Dragonite, and Hisuian Arcanine, while Recover provides longevity, allowing Eternatus to have an easier time against revenge killers like Altarianite Regieleki and Metagrossite Urshifu-R. Meteor Beam and Power Herb's single-use nature requires Eternatus to be used with offensive pivots that can wear down the opposing team like Altarianite Regieleki, Red Orb Raikou, and Metagrossite Urshifu-R; in return, it can clean up the opposing team. Entry hazard users like Arceus formes, Hisuian Arcanine, and Hisuian Samurott make for great partners, wearing down Eternatus's checks like Galarian Slowking, Arceus-Ground, and non-Heavy-Duty Boots Lunala throughout the course of the game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great Attack, amazing Speed, and versatile movepool with powerful STAB moves, Urshifu-R distinguishes itself as a fantastic wallbreaker and offensive pivot. Ice Spinner hits foes that resist Urshifu-R's STAB attacks, such as Eternatus and Dragonite. Alternatively, Zen Headbutt can be used for better outs against Toxapex while still hitting Eternatus. U-turn allows Urshifu-R to switch out of bad matchups such as Arceus-Water and generate momentum. Metagrossite ensures that Urshifu-R can act as a fast pivot, outpacing foes like Eternatus, Scizorite Weavile, Lucarionite Walking Wake. Alternatively, Aerodactylite or Blue Orb can be used if another teammate like Galarian Zapdos is using Metagrossite to enhance Urshifu-R's wallbreaking potential, with Aerodactylite sets always 2HKOing defensive Eternatus with Ice Spinner and Blue Orb sets 2HKOing Arceus-Fairy with Surging Strikes, albeit at the cost of being outsped by the aforementioned Pokemon. Urshifu-R fits well with other offensive pivots, such as Raikou and Walking Wake, pressuring structures involving Pokemon like Eternatus and bulky Water-types like Arceus-Water and Toxapex. Setup sweepers like Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, and Lunala also appreciate Urshifu-R's ability to safely pivot them in. Urshifu-R is vulnerable to -ate Speed users, such as Altarianite Regieleki, Hisuian Arcanine, and Dragonite, so teammates that help in dealing with them such as Arceus-Ground, Galarian Slowking, and Solgaleo are appreciated. Urshifu-R also has difficulty in dealing with bulky Arceus formes, especially Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Water, so Pokemon that beat them such as Eternatus and the aforementioned Raging Bolt make great partners.</p>"

Volt Switch allows it to pivot out into these aforementioned teammates and chips Corviknight, Explosion allows it to chunk threats like Hisuian Arcanine and Dragon Dance Dragonite while ensuring that a teammate can always come in safely, and Rapid Spin removes entry hazards from setters like Hisuian Arcanine, Garganacl, and Arceus formes attempting to take advantage of Regieleki's passivity. 196 HP and 252 Defense EVs with an Impish nature allow Regieleki to survive two uses of Extreme Speed from Altarianite Regieleki from full HP if it sets Reflect first, and 4 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed base 149 Speed Pokemon like Absolite Walking Wake and Lucarionite Shaymin-S. Regieleki should always be paired with setup sweepers that appreciate it setting dual screens like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Meteor Beam Lunala, and Swords Dance Kingambit, notably allowing them to set up safely and making them harder to revenge kill. Defoggers like Corviknight threaten to remove the dual screens Regieleki sets, so partners that can threaten them or punish their Defog attempts like Dragon Dance Gouging Fire, Swords Dance Lopunnite Iron Boulder, and Kingambit, which notably has Defiant before Mega Evolving, are appreciated.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>With its nigh-unresisted STAB combination after Mega Evolving, incredible Speed tier, and useful utility options, Regieleki is one of Mix and Mega's most reliable offensive pivots and cleaners. Extreme Speed with Glalitite or Pinsirite gives Regieleki an Ice-type coverage move or Flying-type STAB attack, allowing it to threaten Pokemon like Arceus-Ground, Great Tusk, and Clodsire that would otherwise completely wall it and revenge kill setup sweepers like Dragonite. Explosion is a great one-time nuke that lets Regieleki to potentially OHKO Pokemon like Calm Mind Arceus formes and give a partner a safe switch in. Rapid Spin allows Regieleki to support teammates like Dragonite by removing entry hazards, but Supercell Slam can be for opted instead, giving Regieleki a powerful physical Electric-type STAB move against Pokemon looking to switch into Volt Switch like Solgaleo and Ho-Oh. The given EVs allow Regieleki to outspeed opposing Altarianite Regieleki. Regieleki can oftentimes struggle to muscle through physically defensive walls like Lunala and Arceus-Poison, so Pokemon like Arceus-Ground, Landorus, and Raging Bolt who can threaten these Pokemon are helpful. Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Galarian Zapdos, and Raikou can form powerful VoltTurn cores with Regieleki, as they threaten Pokemon like Great Tusk and Arceus that Regieleki can struggle against; in return, Regieleki can help chip away at Pokemon like Dragonite and Raging Bolt. While generally outclassed by Altarianite Regieleki, running Pinsirite or Glalitite on Regieleki is most common to free up a teammate like Dragonite or Hisuian Arcanine to run Altarianite. Regieleki's weaker Ice-type coverage means it is more reliant on Explosion and its Electric-type attacks to dent foes, but it has better overall coverage on most threats. Pinsirite Regieleki's Flying typing makes it more vulnerable to Stealth Rock, but its more powerful Extreme Speed easily punishes common Pixilate switch-ins like Galarian Slowking and Red Orb Landorus.</p>"

Body Slam is notably difficult to switch into due to its paralysis chance. Rapid Spin removes entry hazards and turns Great Tusk into a major threat by letting it outspeed nearly the entire metagame, only losing to Chien-Pao and Deoxys-S. Bulk Up turns it into a fearsome setup sweeper that can even beat non-setup Corviknight, while Ice Spinner hits opposing Greak Tusk and common Pinsirite users like Garganacl and Iron Boulder. The given EV spread allows Great Tusk to outspeed a Aerilate Dragonite, survive Adamant Aerodactylite Gouging Fire's +1 Flare Blitz, and OHKO Tough Claws variants of Gouging Fire with Headlong Rush. Great Tusk's incredible offensive and defensive utility means it often warrants itself on a variety of offense and faster balance teams, and so allows it to have a wide range of suitable partners. Pokemon that appreciate its ability to keep hazards off the field while being offensive menaces like Urshifu-R, Red Orb Raging Bolt, and Hisuian Arcanine warrant themselves as strong partners. Allies that resist Water- and Ice-type moves like Arceus-Water, Alomomola, and the aforementioned Red Orb Raging Bolt are also good teammates, being able to switch into or force out threats like Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao while having their own utility in the form of pivoting, hazards, status, setup, and Wish passing. Electric-types like Sandy Shocks and Raikou that can punish Flying-types like Corviknight and Pinsirite Garganacl that attempt to take advantage of Great Tusk's inability to dent them are also notable. Likewise, non-grounded, Flying-resistant Pokemon like Latiasite Magearna and Solgaleo that would otherwise wall Great Tusk can be accounted for with partners like Lunala, Scizorite Weavile, Flare Blitz Gouging Fire, and Red Orb Raikou.</p>"
