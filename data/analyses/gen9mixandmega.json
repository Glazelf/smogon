        "description": "<p>Regieleki acts as an excellent dual screens setter on hyper offense teams, allowing teammates like Meteor Beam Eternatus, Dragon Dance Gouging Fire, and Swords Dance Urshifu-R to set up safely. Volt Switch allows it to pivot out into these aforementioned teammates and chips Corviknight, Explosion allows it to chunk threats like Hisuian Arcanine and Dragon Dance Dragonite while ensuring that a teammate can always come in safely, and Rapid Spin removes entry hazards from setters like Hisuian Arcanine, Garganacl, and Arceus formes attempting to take advantage of Regieleki's passivity. 196 HP and 252 Defense EVs with an Impish nature allow Regieleki to survive two uses of Extreme Speed from Altarianite Regieleki from full HP if it sets Reflect first, and 4 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed base 149 Speed Pokemon like Absolite Walking Wake and Lucarionite Shaymin-S. Regieleki should always be paired with setup sweepers that appreciate it setting dual screens like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Meteor Beam Lunala, and Swords Dance Kingambit, notably allowing them to set up safely and making them harder to revenge kill. Defoggers like Corviknight threaten to remove the dual screens Regieleki sets, so partners that can threaten them or punish their Defog attempts like Dragon Dance Gouging Fire, Swords Dance Lopunnite Iron Boulder, and Kingambit, which notably has Defiant before Mega Evolving, are appreciated.</p>"
