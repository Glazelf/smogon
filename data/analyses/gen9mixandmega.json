Altarianite grants Hisuian Arcanine access to Pixilate Extreme Speed, which lets it revenge kill common offensive staples such as Dragonite, Urshifu-R, and Hisuian Samurott. Stealth Rock lets Hisuian Arcanine set entry hazards and pressure hazard removers such as Corviknight and Metagrossite Great Tusk looking to come in. Stone Edge lets it threaten foes that resist its STAB moves, notably targeting Ho-Oh, Pinsirite Gouging Fire, and opposing Hisuian Arcanine. The given EVs let it outpace uninvested Solgaleo. Hisuian Arcanine struggles against bulky Water-types such as Arceus-Water and Toxapex, making teammates that can threaten them such as Raging Bolt, Raikou, and Zapdos appreciated. Other defensive staples such as Eternatus, Garganacl, and Red Orb Hippowdon trouble Hisuian Arcanine, so teammates that can reliably pressure these such as Landorus, Great Tusk, and Arceus-Ground are also appreciated. Defensive teammates such as Eternatus, Solgaleo, and Corviknight appreciate Hisuian Arcanine's ability to take on threats such as Magearna, Ho-Oh, and Weavile. Hisuian Arcanine dislikes entry hazards, so allies that can remove them such as Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Great Tusk are necessary.</p>"

Good defensive stats and typing alongside the Regenerator ability means Galarian Slowking isn't in a rush to Mega Evolve often, as it can lean on its solid natural bulk to check Pokemon such as Eternatus, Lugia, and Regieleki, allowing Regenerator to keep it healthy throughout the course of a game. Galarian Slowking's movesets rely on Chilly Reception and Slack Off and typically include a reliable STAB attack like Future Sight, Psychic, or Sludge Bomb. Flamethrower annoys many Steel-types, and Toxic and Toxic Spikes are both very potent limiting tools for many bulky Pokemon such as Calm Mind Arceus formes and Ho-Oh. It also acts as the best Trick Room setter in the tier, though teams dedicated to that playstyle are very inconsistent. Galarian Slowking can use a wide range of defensive EV spreads, ranging from max Defense with a Relaxed nature to max Special Defense with a Sassy nature, of which the most common are mixed with an emphasis on Special Defense. The given EV spread survives a Metagrossite Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes after Stealth Rock without the need to Mega Evolve. Latiasite grants a Ground immunity through Levitate to dodge Spikes, Earthquake, and Ground-type Judgment making Galarian Slowking very reliable at its job, which is the reason Latiasite is the most versatile item on most teams. Sablenite can be used as a role compression Mega Stone that grants superior bulk and Magic Bounce but at the cost of trading Regenerator for the ability to block entry hazards. Sablenite's natural opportunity cost usually dissuades its use on Galarian Slowking, and other Mega Stones such as Manectite and Venusaurite can be used to fulfill a specific niche, such as an emergency use of Intimidate or resistance to Red Orb users like Lugia and Ice-type attackers like Calyrex-I, but these stones typically struggle to have a better justification for use instead of Latiasite. Galarian Slowking is susceptible to physical attackers like Hisuan Samurott, Solgaleo and Kingambit, so being able to use Chilly Reception to switch into offensive teammates like Great Tusk and Dragonite that threaten these options is ideal. Defensive teammates like Corviknight and Mandibuzz complement Galarian Slowking well, with the latter also being able to take on Ghost-types attacks like Moongeist Beam and Poltergeist from Lunala and Ceruledge, respectively. Ice-type teammates like Chien-Pao, Weavile, and Baxcalibur, which benefit from the snow from Chilly Reception, make for good partners; Calyrex-I in particular can also make us of Trick Room set up by Galarian Slowking to become a terrifying wallbreaker and cleaner.</p>"

Future Sight allows Solgaleo to heavily damage Poison-types like Eternatus, Arceus-Poison, and Clodsire over a period of time and combo with Fighting-types like Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos for incredible wallbreaking power, although Sunsteel Strike can be used to hit Arceus-Fairy, Garganacl, and Iron Boulder for super effective damage. Psychic Fangs is the final option for the third coverage slot to reliably hit the aforementioned Poison-types. Earthquake is recommended in the last moveslot to nail Fire-types like non-Pinsirite Gouging Fire and Hisuian Arcanine, Red Orb users like Raging Bolt, and, if running Future Sight, can consistently deal with the previously mentioned Poison-types. Flamethrower can be used to threaten Pinsirite Magearna, Corviknight, and Levitate variants of Excadrill, Magearna, and Solgaleo. Flash Cannon is an alternative to Sunsteel Strike that has more PP, but it cannot threaten Arceus-Fairy, Garganacl, and Altarianite Dragonite as effectively as Sunsteel Strike. Sablenite is recommended due to the utility Magic Bounce provides by bouncing backing entry hazards from Pokemon like Eternatus, along with the defensive stat boosts Solgaleo receives, although Venusaurite can be used to ease the matchup against Eternatus and Fire-types like Hisuian Arcanine and Iron Moth. A Relaxed or Sassy nature can be used depending on the team. Thanks to Solgaleo's ability to underspeed slow pivots like Corviknight and Magearna, cleaners like Gouging Fire, Arceus, and Raging Bolt appreciate its presence. Even with Venusaurite, Solagleo has difficulty with Fire-types such as Raging Bolt, Landorus, and Gouging Fire. Therefore, Blue Orb users like Archaludon that can deal with Raging Bolt, Pokemon like Latiasite Toxapex and Ho-Oh that can handle Landorus, and Pokemon like Garganacl and Arceus-Water that can take care of Gouging Fire can all form a potent defensive core with Solgaleo. Solgaleo is also forced out by Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott, Darkrai, and Weavile. Therefore, Pokemon that resist Dark, like Arceus-Fairy, Hisuian Arcanine, and Magearna, are beneficial. Ironically, Dark-types like Weavile, Hisuian Samurott, and Darkrai are also good partners for Solgaleo, as they force out Lunala for it. In return, Solgaleo provides the aforementioned Dark-types with Future Sight support to soften Arceus-Fairy and Altarianite Hisuian Arcanine.</p>"

Flamethrower can be used to deal with Steel-types like Corviknight, Magearna, and opposing Solgaleo, whereas Thunderbolt hits Hisuian Samurott, Mandibuzz, and Urshifu-R harder while still hitting Corviknight for super effective damage and Magearna and Solgaleo for neutral damage. Latiasite can be used to mitigate Solgaleo's weakness to Ground, helping it deal with foes such as Arceus-Ground, Great Tusk, and Earthquake Iron Boulder and Dragonite. Alternatively, Venusaurite can be used to remove Solgaleo's weakness to Fire, allowing it to deal with threats like Hisuian Arcanine and Ho-Oh. Solgaleo is a great glue on bulky offense and balance teams, being capable of switching into and taking down foes like Eternatus, -ate Speed users, and Arceus formes depending on its set, helping common partners like Urshifu-R, Gouging Fire, and Raging Bolt. However, Solgaleo cannot check Ground- and Fire-types simultaneously. It is also prone to being revenge killed by Dark-types such as Hisuian Samurott, Weavile, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit and Ghost-types like Lunala and Spectrier. Therefore, it appreciates teammates such as Arceus-Water, Arceus-Ground, and Eternatus when using Latiasite sets; Urshifu-R, Arceus-Water, and Corviknight when using Venusaurite sets; -ate Speed users like Hisuian Arcanine, Dragonite, and Regieleki for dealing with Dark-types; and the aforementioned Dark-types themselves for dealing with Lunala.</p>"

Sablenite makes Corviknight incredibly slow, improving its pivoting capabilities, and also gives it Magic Bounce, which can reflect hazards used by Pokemon like Arceus-Ground and Garganacl as well as Taunt from Deoxys-S, ensuring Corviknight can heal itself with Roost and keep its teammates such as Gouging Fire, Urshifu-R, and Raging Bolt from being chipped. U-turn helps provide momentum and allows safe switch-ins to frail attackers such as Nasty Plot Deoxys-S and Iron Boulder, which can threaten to sweep when positioned correctly. Brave Bird is used to deal decent damage against Fighting-types like Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos at the cost of recoil, while Body Press deals super effective damage versus the likes of Chien-Pao, Garganacl, and Iron Boulder but does less damage to neutral targets. Corviknight has a great matchup against many Pokemon, including Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Urshifu-R, thanks to its defensive traits and ability to bring in Pokemon like Hisuian Arcanine and Walking Wake to dispose of these threats. Some significant threats to Corviknight include Electric-types like Zapdos, Sandy Shocks, and Supercell Slam Regieleki as well as Fire-types such as Gouging Fire and Red Orb users like Landorus and Raging Bolt. Dragon-types like Eternatus and Arceus-Dragon are thus good teammates for their ability to handle the majority of Pokemon with these typings with ease. Corviknight can also be paired with Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, whose Judgment can threaten every relevant Electric- and Fire-type in the metagame bar Zapdos, which is threatened by Ice Beam.

Dynamax Cannon acts as a great secondary STAB move, letting Eternatus more reliably threaten foes that resist Sludge Bomb such as Great Tusk and Landorus, whereas Toxic lets it pressure bulky setup sweepers such as Lunala, Lugia, and Arceus formes looking to set up on it while also annoying other defensive switch-ins like Mega-Evolved Garganacl, Ho-Oh, and Hippowdon. Dragon Tail also halts bulky setup sweepers like the aformentinoed ones and Arceus-Poison while having the benefit of racking up entry hazard chip. Flamethrower threatens foes that resist Sludge Bomb, notably targeting Steel-types such as Magearna, non-Venusaurite Corviknight, and Solgaleo. Toxic Spikes is a niche alternative, letting Eternatus pressure teams lacking a Poison-type, although it is less common due to the prevalence of Eternatus and Galarian Slowking. The given EVs let Eternatus outspeed maximum Speed Lunala and Lucarionite Raging Bolt; alternatively, it can forgo Defense EVs for more Speed. Rocky Helmet is preferred on physically defensive variants, as it lets Eternatus punish foes such as Urshifu-R, Hisuian Arcanine, and Hisuian Samurott more. Black Sludge grants it more longevity, while Heavy-Duty Boots gives it a permanent immunity to entry hazards. Thanks to Eternatus's well-rounded stats and typing, it finds itself a place on almost all balance or bulkier teams, soft checking common threats such as Regieleki and Hisuian Arcanine. Specially defensive walls such as Ho-Oh, Mandibuzz, and most Arceus formes make great partners, as they can take on strong special wallbreakers such as Walking Wake, Landorus, and setup Solgaleo that Eternatus struggles against. Eternatus also pairs well with Latiasite Steel-types such as Solgaleo and Magearna, as they are able to take on Dragon- and Ground-types such as opposing Eternatus, Arceus-Ground, and Great Tusk. In return, Eternatus takes on Red Orb users such as Raikou and Raging Bolt, as well as Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos.

Recover increases Eternatus's survivability and lets it offset Life Orb recoil and other chip damage. Life Orb Eternatus is typically seen on more offensive teams looking for a solid wallbreaker. Pokemon that hard wall Eternatus like Blissey and Blue Orb Magearna and Pokemon that can use it as setup fodder like Iron Boulder and Calm Mind Venusaurite Solgaleo can give it a tough time. As a result, Pokemon like Great Tusk and Arceus-Ground that can deal with these threats are good teammates.

Alternatively, Aerodactylite or Blue Orb can be used if another teammate like Galarian Zapdos is using Metagrossite to enhance Urshifu-R's wallbreaking potential, with Aerodactylite sets always 2HKOing defensive Eternatus with Ice Spinner and Blue Orb sets 2HKOing Arceus-Fairy with Surging Strikes, albeit at the cost of being outsped by the aforementioned Pokemon. Urshifu-R fits well with other offensive pivots, such as Raikou and Walking Wake, pressuring structures involving Pokemon like Eternatus and bulky Water-types like Arceus-Water and Toxapex.

Its strong movepool, great stats, and solid typing let it act as a great glue Pokemon for many playstyles, ranging from hyper offense to semi-stall. Utilizing the highest base Speed stat in the tier, and Pixilate-boosted, STAB Rapid Spin, Regieleki is quite difficult to prevent from spinning. Regieleki is also the only Pokemon with both Extreme Speed and a pivoting move. Extreme Speed gives it significant revenge killing prowess by letting it move before anything besides +2, Speed-invested Dragonite while a speedy Volt Switch gives it the maneuverability to weaken foes while bringing in a defensive teammate like Corviknight. Regieleki can use Explosion to trade KOs with foes, Supercell Slam to hit targets like Ho-Oh and Galarian Slowking, or Tera Blast to 2HKO checks like Ampharosite Skarmory and Pinsirite Great Tusk. It can even forgo Rapid Spin for one of these options, but there isn't a much better hazard remover than it, and will only be fruitful if it's paired with other consistent hazard removal options like Pinsirite Great Tusk and Sablenite Corviknight. Maximum Speed EVs let Regieleki always at least Speed tie with opposing Altarianite Regieleki; alternatively, due to its ludicrous base Speed, it can afford to run more specialized EV spreads that forgo max Speed for Defense or Special Attack investment. For example, a 252 Atk / 68 Def / 80 SpA / 108 Spe spread lets it survive opposing Altarianite Regieleki's Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock, outpace positive-natured base 160 Speed foes such as Cameruptite Deoxys-S and Manectite Spectrier, outpace +1 Pinsirite Dragonite, and do more damage to its Poison- and Fire-type answers like Arceus-Poison, Galarian Slowking, Hisuian Arcanine, and Ho-Oh. Due to its spinning prowess, Regieleki is a great teammate to Pokemon that dislike hazards such as Dragonite, Gouging Fire, and Red Orb users like Raging Bolt and Raikou.

Regieleki should always be paired with setup sweepers that appreciate it setting dual screens like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Meteor Beam Lunala, and Swords Dance Kingambit, notably allowing them to set up safely and making them harder to revenge kill. Defoggers like Corviknight threaten to remove the dual screens Regieleki sets, so partners that can threaten them or punish their Defog attempts like Dragon Dance Gouging Fire, Swords Dance Lopunnite Iron Boulder, and Kingambit, which notably has Defiant before Mega Evolving, are appreciated.</p>"

Explosion is a great one-time nuke that lets Regieleki to potentially OHKO Pokemon like Calm Mind Arceus formes and give a partner a safe switch in. Rapid Spin allows Regieleki to support teammates like Dragonite by removing entry hazards, but Supercell Slam can be for opted instead, giving Regieleki a powerful physical Electric-type STAB move against Pokemon looking to switch into Volt Switch like Solgaleo and Ho-Oh. The given EVs allow Regieleki to outspeed opposing Altarianite Regieleki. Regieleki can oftentimes struggle to muscle through physically defensive walls like Lunala and Arceus-Poison, so Pokemon like Arceus-Ground, Landorus, and Raging Bolt who can threaten these Pokemon are helpful. Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Galarian Zapdos, and Raikou can form powerful VoltTurn cores with Regieleki, as they threaten Pokemon like Great Tusk and Arceus that Regieleki can struggle against; in return, Regieleki can help chip away at Pokemon like Dragonite and Raging Bolt. While generally outclassed by Altarianite Regieleki, running Pinsirite or Glalitite on Regieleki is most common to free up a teammate like Dragonite or Hisuian Arcanine to run Altarianite. Regieleki's weaker Ice-type coverage means it is more reliant on Explosion and its Electric-type attacks to dent foes, but it has better overall coverage on most threats. Pinsirite Regieleki's Flying typing makes it more vulnerable to Stealth Rock, but its more powerful Extreme Speed easily punishes common Pixilate switch-ins like Galarian Slowking and Red Orb Landorus.</p>"

Double-Edge has more breaking power and can heavily dent neutral foes like Eternatus, Galarian Slowking, and Arceus-Water, although Body Slam can be use if longevity is preferred, and the paralysis chance helps Gouging Fire's Speed. Flare Blitz hits Magearna and Corviknight, although Earthquake nails Raging Bolt and Raikou more reliably than any of Gouging Fire's other moves. Morning Sun gives Gouging Fire recovery in a pinch against passive walls like Ho-Oh, Galarian Slowking, and Lugia. The given EV spread allows Gouging Fire to survive Surging Strikes from Metagrossite Urshifu-R before Mega Evolving and outpace Iron Boulder after a Dragon Dance. Pinsirite is mandatory to flip matchups on Ground-types like Great Tusk, Arceus-Ground, and Landorus. Gouging Fire is extremely vulnerable to Stealth Rock after Mega Evolving, which makes entry hazard removal from Excadrill and Great Tusk and Sablenite users like Solgaleo, Corviknight, and Mandibuzz appreciated. Blue Orb users like Magearna and Archaludon can easily take any of non-Earthquake Gouging-Fire's attacks, so Ground-types like Landorus, Great Tusk, and Arceus-Ground are beneficial. Dual screens Regieleki is an amazing partner, as it makes set up easier and removes entry hazards via Rapid Spin. Gouging Fire also hates bulky Water- and Rock-types like Arceus-Water, Garganacl, and Toxapex, so Pokemon that can manage them, like Raging Bolt, Galarian Zapdos, and Thundurus, respectively, are beneficial. If Gouging Fire forgoes Flare Blitz however, it cannot break through Levitate variants of Solgaleo, Magearna, and Kingambit, so Pokemon like Raikou, Hisuian Arcanine, and Urshifu-R form great offensive cores with it.</p>"
