Glare spreads paralysis, warding off wallbreakers like Gengar and Melmetal and providing speed control for slower wallbreakers such as Tyranitar and Buzzwole. Alternatively, Clefable's deep movepool allows it to run a vast array of other utility options; Teleport can bring the aforementioned wallbreakers in with ease, for example, matching up better against slower threats like Galarian Slowking and Ferrothorn, which Glare is less effective against. Knock Off is also a good option, removing items such as Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots to drastically reduce the longevity of Pokemon like Heatran and Zeraora. Trick in conjunction with Sticky Barb can be used in a similar manner, albeit only one time. Clefable can use both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin on the same moveset for maximum role compression, although it loses any ability to deter aforementioned switch-ins like Gengar and Heatran in the process. The same holds true of both Aromatherapy and Wish, which are greatly appreciated by offensive tanks like Tornadus-T, Melmetal, and Heatran. VoltTurn cores with Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Aerodactyl greatly appreciate Rapid Spin Clefable only removing opposing hazards, while Spikes setters like Seismitoad can form a hazard-stacking core with Stealth Rock Clefable. Skarmory and Ferrothorn are also very notable hazard setters, as they can handle physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar and Aerodactyl that punch through Clefable with ease. Similarly, Clefable struggles to take on strong special attackers like Keldeo and Rotom-H, so specially defensive teammates like Assault Vest Toxapex and Slowking are recommended.</p> "

Rapid Spin offers entry hazard removal and bolsters Clefable's Speed stat, notably letting it outpace Choice Band Tyranitar after one boost and positive-natured base 95s like Obstagoon and Kyurem after two. Rapid Spin also invites in many hazard setters Clefable can boost against like Mudsdale and the aforementioned Gastrodon; since it pressured hazard setters, Calm Mind also makes it easier to keep hazards off the field. Glare is used to hinder threats like Fire Lash Cinderace and Nidoking that Clefable may force in after garnering boosts. An additional coverage move such as Flamethrower, Stored Power, or Thunder can be used instead to more immediately pressure Fairy-resistant walls such as Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and non-Assault Vest Toxapex, making Clefable a more independent sweeper but reducing its utility. 12 Speed EVs are used to outpace uninvested Tyranitar. Clefable pairs well with bulky Pokemon like Skarmory and Toxapex that benefit from its offensive presence, and in turn they can set hazards to wear down foes and switch into strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar and Urshifu-R, that force Clefable out. Clefable is hard stopped by Toxapex carrying Haze or Clear Smog, and without Flamethrower it can't meaningfully damage offensive Fairy-resistant Pokemon like Melmetal and Excadrill, so teammates that can remove or weaken these threats such as offensive Rotom-H and Rocky Helmet Ferrothorn are greatly appreciated.</p> "

Spikes synergizes excellently with this strategy, as Ferrothorn can use the threat of boosted Body Press to force out common entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Tornadus-T. Strength Sap allows Ferrothorn to further challenge physical attackers that may otherwise muscle through Cotton Guard boosts. Alternatively, Anchor Shot can be used instead of Spikes, trapping Pokemon like Hippowdon, Clefable, and opposing Ferrothorn that may otherwise exploit an unboosted Ferrothorn to set up hazards. Ferrothorn makes great use of Leftovers's passive recovery, notably using it to avoid a 2HKO from Aerodactyl's Brave Bird. Chople Berry can be run to let Ferrothorn lure in Fighting-types like Urshifu-R, Buzzwole, and Terrakion. Ferrothorn fits best on balance and offense teams that require a blanket check to physical attackers, and their offensive cores can make full use of Spikes chip damage and weaken foes into range of Body Press. VoltTurn Pokemon like Rotom-H and Thundurus-T are therefore great options, as are strong wallbreakers that can remove Heavy-Duty Boots, like Tyranitar and Weavile. Rapid Spin users are also appreciated for removing opposing hazards without removing Ferrothorn's Spikes, with Sylveon and Calm Mind Clefable being two particularly notable examples that also offer a Fighting resistance.</p> "

Dracozolt is appreciated by slower defensive teammates like Seismitoad and Skarmory for outspeeding and KOing opposing threats. Because Dracozolt relies on sand to perform effectively, a Sand Stream Pokemon like Tyranitar and Hippowdon is necessary. Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Knock Off users like Tyranitar and Tornadus-T can wear down Ground-types, with Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots to rack up Spikes damage, making them easier for Dracozolt to break through. Pokemon like Rillaboom and Rotom-Wash that can switch into Ground-type moves and offensively threaten Ground-types are also valuable, especially since Dracozolt's average defensive stats make it struggle to take hits. Dracozolt is also vulnerable to getting worn down by entry hazards on top of Life Orb recoil, so it appreciates entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Clefable. Excadrill is also a notably good partner for Dracozolt, as they both enjoy sand with Sand Rush and Excadrill can weaken opposing Ground-types for Dracozolt to finish off and vice versa.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With high Attack and Speed, Urshifu-R serves as a powerful offensive threat with STAB moves like Surging Strikes, which pressures walls like Hippowdon, Buzzwole, and Mudsdale while ignoring Defense boosts. Close Combat lets Urshifu-R threaten Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Melmetal, as well as broadly damaging Water-resistant foes like Hydreigon, Rotom-W, and Seismitoad. U-turn allows Urshifu-R to escape defensive Pokemon it struggles to break through, like Toxapex, while maintaining momentum. No Retreat can be used instead to turn it into a sweeper. However, since Urshifu-R will be unable to switch out after using No Retreat, it is wise to make sure defensive checks like Haze Toxapex have been removed beforehand. Urshifu-R has several options for its last moveslot: Taunt can stop opposing setup sweepers like Reuniclus or prevent Urshifu-R from taking a status move, Aqua Jet allows Urshifu-R to revenge kill weakened foes, notably Aerodactyl, and Thunder Punch gives coverage against Pokemon like Gyarados and Slowking that otherwise don't fear it. Using Protective Pads keeps Urshifu-R safe from chip damage from Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet users, which is especially helpful against Ferrothorn, which could otherwise switch into Surging Strikes and chip Urshifu-R with every hit. Urshifu-R supports teammates like Thundurus-T and Rotom-H that struggle against Tyranitar and Ground-types. It benefits from teammates like Heatran and Rillaboom that can pressure opposing Grass- and Electric-types. Entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Seismitoad can help weaken checks such as Buzzwole. Due to its lack of recovery, Urshifu-R also benefits from entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Tornadus-T to keep it from getting worn down when pivoting. Urshifu-R can also be used on rain teams, where teammates like Pelipper and Kingdra benefit greatly from its ability to remove Ferrothorn.</p> "
