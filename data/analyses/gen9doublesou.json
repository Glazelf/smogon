Dragonite also has excellent coverage, allowing it to hit any Pokémon that aren't afraid of Extreme Speed, such as Gholdengo and Iron Treads. Dragonite’s Dragon/Flying allows it to take attacks such as Chi-Yu's Heat Wave and Palafin's Jet Punch while also granting it immunity to Earthquakes from Garchomp and Great Tusk. Tera Normal also allows it to survive threatening Dragon- and Ice-type attacks. Inner Focus lets Dragonite avoid Attack drops from Intimidate and flinches from Fake Out. Dragonite is most commonly paired with Chien-Pao, as Sword of Ruin lowers the Defense of foes, allowing Extreme Speed to deal more damage. This pairing is preferred by offensive teams but can fit on other archetypes appreciate Dragonite's power and priority. Due to Dragonite's heavy dependence on Extreme Speed, Pokemon that can block priority moves such as Farigiraf, Tsareena, and Indeedee-F limit its effectiveness. Dragonite also struggles against Pokémon with high physical bulk that can take an Extreme Speed and threaten it in return such as Great Tusk, Iron Hands, Amoonguss, and Garganacl.

While Heatran boasts an innately good defensive typing, Tera Grass allows it to turn its common weaknesses to Ground and Water into resistances, letting it match up better against the likes of Landorus-T and Palafin-H. Heat Wave is a spread STAB attack that chips away at foes, notably 2HKOing Amoonguss. Flash Cannon is Heatran's best way of hitting Fairy-types, as it OHKOes Diancie and 2HKOes Flutter Mane. Heavy Slam OHKOes Flutter Mane but is generally less reliable because it can be weakened by Intimidate and does less damage to Diancie and opposing Tera Grass Heatran mirror. Tera Blast hits Water- and Ground-types super effectively once Heatran has Terastallized, notably OHKOing Great Tusk and 2HKOing Bulk Up Palafin-H. Earth Power hits the Fire-types such as Volcanion, Chi-Yu, and opposing Heatran that otherwise resists all of Heatran's attacks. Heatran's base resistances let it take common Fairy-, Ice-, and Steel-type attacks such as Flutter Mane's Moonblast, Chien-Pao's Ice Spinner, and Gholdengo's Make It Rain much better. After Terastallization, Heatran matches up better against Palafin-H, Volcanion, and Iron Hands at the cost of receiving more damage from the aforementioned attacks. Heatran has a lot of defensive responsibilities on most teams, so Terastallization should not be used too frivolously. Heatran commonly finds itself in Fire / Water / Grass cores with Rillaboom and Palafin, as they complement each other offensively and defensively, with Rillaboom eradicating Water-types and Palafin punching through Fire-types. Iron Hands is a common Heatran partner that can pressure Palafin and Volcanion with Wild Charge and Chi-Yu and Tera Dark Kingambit with Drain Punch.

Garganacl is difficult to break for many Pokemon, but it matches up notably well into Fire-types such as Chi-Yu and Arcanine, Flying-types like Dragonite and Iron Jugulis, and Amoonguss due to Purifying Salt. As one of the best Wide Guard users, Garganacl can block the format's many powerful spread attacks such as Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Chi-Yu's Heat Wave, and Armarouge's Expanding Force. Iron Defense lets Garganacl play as a potent wincon instead, increasing its Defense whilst simultaneously strengthening its offensive presence through Body Press. These sets can be very difficult to take down, though they often rely on using up Terastallization to be most effective. Garganacl's abysmal Speed means it will usually be relegated to moving last. Rock typing also leaves Garganacl with countless weaknesses, including to Water-, Steel-, and Fighting-type moves, meaning common Pokemon such as Palafin, Gholdengo, Iron Bundle, Iron Hands, and Great Tusk all significantly threaten it. Amoonguss is one of the best partners for Garganacl, being helpful against several of the aforementioned threats, while Garganacl checks Fire-types like Chi-Yu in return, with redirection support and healing being especially critical for Iron Defense sets.

Drain Punch is a reliable means of recovery in addition to Leftovers while also hitting popular Dark-types like Kingambit and Chien-Pao, as well as common Water-resistant or immune foes such as Rillaboom and Volcanion harder.

Palafin's base forme has poor damage output and bulk, so it is often ideal for it to lead and pivot out immediately to activate Zero to Hero. This is so crucial to Palafin's functioning that it is very telegraphed and easily exploitable with powerful attacks directed at it. To cover for this, Palafin may lead together with a Fake Out user or a redirector to reduce incoming damage. Bulk Up Palafin pairs well with partners that can remove Psychic Terrain, use Fake Out to generate free turns for Palafin to set up, and extend Palafin's longevity. Rillaboom fulfills all of these roles, with Grassy Terrain granting additional passive recovery. Cresselia is another good partner, as its Lunar Blessing heals Palafin and cures burn and poison, which would otherwise severely limit Palafin's offensive output or the turns it can stay on field. Amoonguss's Rage Powder redirects threatening attacks such as Iron Hands's Wild Charge, removes Toxic Spikes that reduce Palafin's longevity, and provides a major source of recovery for Palafin with Pollen Puff. Iron Hands is a Fake Out user whose Electric-type attacks eliminate opposing Water-types that resist Jet Punch. Grimmsnarl can also increase Palafin's bulk and create setup opportunities with its dual screens. As Amoonguss effortlessly walls Palafin and undoes its progress with Clear Smog, Palafin requires partners that deal with it effectively, like Heatran, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p>"

Iron Bundle has excellent speed control with Icy Wind, which, when combined with its high Speed, can easily ensure that it and its allies outspeed the enemy team. However, Iron Bundle is a fairly fragile Pokemon, especially against powerful special attackers such as Chi-Yu and Gholdengo.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Iron Bundle can run Encore over Icy Wind or Protect, easily locking most Pokemon into a move such as Protect or Fake Out thanks to its high Speed. On a snow team with Abomasnow, Iron Bundle can run Blizzard as a powerful spread attack, and it also can maximize its damage output with Tera Ice. Snow also boosts Iron Bundle's Defense, making it particularly more effective against priority spam teams with Dragonite and Palafin. 252 HP and 64 Special Defense EVs can be used with Assault Vest to survive an Overheat from Choice Scarf Chi-Yu, and Iron Bundle still has above 152 Speed EVs left for outspeeding Meowscarada. 40 HP EVs allow Iron Bundle to avoid a potential OHKO from Chien-Pao's Sacred Sword if Chien-Pao lacks a damage-boosting item, so an EV spread of 40 HP / 216 SpA / 252 Spe on less bulky sets could be used instead.</p>",

It functions well against fast Focus Sash Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and Meowscarada, both dealing damage to nullify the Focus Sash and lowering their Speed, which allows Iron Bundle's ally to KO the foe.</p> </li> <li> <p>Protect is used to predict and avoid attacks that threaten to KO Iron Bundle, extending its longevity. It can also help Iron Bundle stall out Trick Room and Tailwind turns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Water increases the power of Hydro Pump and gives Iron Bundle a better defensive typing against Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Chi-Yu and Gholdengo. Tera Ghost avoids Fake Out and Extreme Speed, letting Bundle act more freely. Both Tera types also reduce the damage taken from Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p>Booster Energy activates Iron Bundle's Quark Drive, making it among the very fastest Pokemon in Doubles OU.

However, it doesn't help Iron Bundle preempt foes or take hits, making it far riskier than other items. Life Orb's recoil damage can also put Iron Bundle into KO range from Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> </li> </ul>"

    "overview": "<p>Chi-Yu poses itself as one of the most menacing special attackers in DOU, with its high Special Attack, near unresisted STAB combination, and Beads of Ruin allowing it to hit the majority of the metagame extremely hard. Beads of Ruin also not only indirectly makes Chi-Yu hit harder but also empowers its special attacking teammates, with Iron Bundle and Gholdengo in particular being excellent partners due to their ability to either overwhelm shared checks like Ting-Lu or outright beat some of Chi-Yu's checks, such as Garchomp for the former and Glimmora for the latter. Furthermore, Chi-Yu has very good Speed, allowing it to naturally outspeed a considerable portion of the metagame. However, Chi-Yu is not without glaring weaknesses, as its HP and Defense are absurdly low, which leaves it vulnerable to common priority moves such as Palafin's Jet Punch and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. In addition, despite Dark / Fire being a good type combination offensively, it leaves Chi-Yu vulnerable defensively, as its weaknesses to Ground-, Rock- and Water-type moves in addition to Stealth Rock compromise its ability to switch in and fire off more attacks. Finally, Pokemon such as Glimmora, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp have the ability to potentially switch into Chi-Yu and threaten it out, with Ting-Lu's Tablets of Ruin being a particular annoyance due to it offsetting Beads of Ruin. However, it is important to note that Chi-Yu's strength is still to the magnitude that it can 2HKO all the aforementioned Pokemon under the right circumstances.</p>",
