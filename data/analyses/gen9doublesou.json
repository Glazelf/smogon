    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is the tier’s premier redirector, sustaining its teammates with Pollen Puff and neutralizing foes with Spore. Its defensive prowess, coupled with Regenerator, provides it the sustainability to soak up hits while supporting its team. Due to its effectiveness, Amoonguss finds itself on a large variety of team styles, from Trick Room to hyper offense. Setup attackers such as Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Swords Dance Iron Hands appreciate its redirection and healing capabilities, and they make up for its near-nonexistent offenses. Amoonguss's Grass / Poison typing provides resistances to key attackers such as Palafin-H and Iron Hands but leaves it weak to Fire- and Ice-types like Chi-Yu and Chien-Pao. Further, its passivity diminishes its utility against status-immune Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Garganacl. Finally, opposing Grass-types such as Meowscarada, Abomasnow, and Tera Grass Iron Hands and Safety Goggles users such as Farigiraf and Sylveon are immune to Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, invalidating its support options.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With Covert Cloak, Amoonguss can turn the tables on Fake Out users and put them to sleep as well as reliably check Garganacl by ignoring its Salt Cure. Rocky Helmet punishes contact attackers such as Dragonite and Palafin-H and KOes Maushold after 8 hits of Population Bomb. Occa Berry allows Amoonguss to survive a Heat Wave from Choice Specs Chi-Yu and Eruption from Charcoal Torkoal. Eject Button can be used to switch into or redirect an attack and then pivot to a frail attacking teammate. None of these items complement Amoonguss's bulk as well as Sitrus Berry, however. Clear Smog allows Amoonguss to check setup foes such as Swords Dance Iron Hands and Iron Defense Garganacl. Foul Play can be used to hit strong physical attackers such as Choice Band Dragonite and Garchomp.</p> ",

  "Garganacl": {
    "overview": "<p>With solid defenses and access to reliable recovery, Garganacl can perform well in a utility role or with setup in Iron Defense. Its biggest selling points are its unique move and ability: Salt Cure offers valuable passive damage, synergizing well with its natural bulk, while Purifying Salt provides a useful immunity to status moves such as Spore and Toxic. Garganacl is difficult to break for many Pokemon, but it matches up notably well into Fire-types such as Chi-Yu and Arcanine, Flying-types like Dragonite and Iron Jugulis, and Amoonguss due to Purifying Salt. As one of the best Wide Guard users, Garganacl can block the format's many powerful spread attacks such as Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Chi-Yu's Heat Wave, and Armarouge's Expanding Force. Iron Defense lets Garganacl play as a potent wincon instead, increasing its Defense whilst simultaneously strengthening its offensive presence through Body Press. These sets can be very difficult to take down, though they often rely on using up Terastallization to be most effective. Garganacl's abysmal Speed means it will usually be relegated to moving last. Rock typing also leaves Garganacl with countless weaknesses, including to Water-, Steel-, and Fighting-type moves, meaning common Pokemon such as Palafin, Gholdengo, Iron Bundle, Iron Hands, and Great Tusk all significantly threaten it. Amoonguss is one of the best partners for Garganacl, being helpful against several of the aforementioned threats, while Garganacl checks Fire-types like Chi-Yu in return, with redirection support and healing being especially critical for Iron Defense sets. Garganacl also appreciates teammates that can check Gholdengo, especially if not using Wide Guard, so Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Arcanine, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit are other desirable additions.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Other defensive Tera types are also usable depending on team needs. For example, Tera Poison still provides a Fighting-type resistance but doesn't gain the Dark-type weakness that Tera Ghost does. This means after Terastallization, Garganacl will still be good against Chi-Yu and gains immunity to Toxic Spikes, at the cost of not losing its Ground-type weakness. Tera Water is another alternative, offering helpful resists against Water-types like Palafin and Steel-types like Gholdengo.</p> ",

  "Iron Hands": {
    "overview": "<p>Iron Hands is a slow but exceptionally bulky and strong physical attacker, as well as one of the best Fake Out users in the tier. It fits best on Trick Room teams that benefit from its low Speed but also has enough bulk to compensate for its slowness and perform adequately on any team that appreciates the safe turns that Fake Out can provide. Iron Hands most commonly holds an Assault Vest to patch up its lower Special Defense stat and comfortably endure and trade attacks with its enemies. Another popular set foregoes Assault Vest to enable the use of Swords Dance, turning Iron Hands into a fearsome setup sweeper. With either set, Iron Hands is a reliable and well-rounded Pokemon that matches up decently into much of the metagame, although it does need to be wary of a few commonly encountered threats. Amoonguss, the tier's most common and bulkiest redirector, walls both of Iron Hands's STAB attacks and can survive two of its Ice Punches. Despite Iron Hands's massive bulk, a few especially hard-hitting Pokemon like Great Tusk and Armarouge have the offensive capability to break through it with ease. Finally, Iron Hands needs to be wary of priority blockers like Farigiraf, Indeedee-F, and Tsareena when using Fake Out.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Iron Hands can be made even bulkier by shifting some or all of its Attack EVs into HP and Defense. Moving 64 EVs into HP allows the Assault Vest Iron Hands set to survive two boosted Shadow Balls from Modest Nasty Plot Gholdengo, as well as one Overheat from a Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu. In addition to the 64 HP EVs, an additional 48 EVs can be moved into Defense to allow Iron Hands to survive two Extreme Speeds or Dragon Claws from Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite, as well as one Headlong Rush from Adamant Great Tusk. Iron Hands can also invest 124 EVs in Speed to outspeed Garchomp under Tailwind but should retain at least 100 Attack EVs and an Adamant Nature when doing so to ensure Ice Punch OHKOes Garchomp. Tera Fire can be used to prevent burns from Will-O-Wisp users like Arcanine while also providing a STAB boost to Fire Punch. Heavy Slam can be run as a coverage move if Fairy-types such as Sylveon are a concern. Finally, Belly Drum can be used in place of Swords Dance as a higher-risk, higher-reward Attack-boosting move, but losing 50% HP in the process is a high price to pay for a Pokemon that prides itself on its bulk and longevity. When using Belly Drum in combination with a Sitrus Berry, ensure that Iron Hands's HP stat is an even number so that Sitrus Berry activates after the 50% HP drop.</p> ",
