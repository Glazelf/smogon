    "overview": "<p>Thanks to the sheer power of Tera Normal Extreme Speed, Dragonite is one of DOU’s biggest threats, threatening to KO a large portion of the metagame. Dragonite also has excellent coverage, allowing it to hit any Pokémon that aren't afraid of Extreme Speed, such as Gholdengo and Iron Treads. Dragonite’s Dragon/Flying allows it to take attacks such as Chi-Yu's Heat Wave and Palafin's Jet Punch while also granting it immunity to Earthquakes from Garchomp and Great Tusk. Tera Normal also allows it to survive threatening Dragon- and Ice-type attacks. Inner Focus lets Dragonite avoid Attack drops from Intimidate and flinches Fake Out. Dragonite is most commonly paired with Chien-Pao, as Sword of Ruin lowers the Defense of foes, allowing Extreme Speed to deal more damage. This pairing is preferred by offensive teams but can fit on other archetypes appreciate Dragonite's power and priority. Due to Dragonite's heavy dependence on Extreme Speed, Pokemon that can block priority moves such as Farigiraf, Tsareena, and Indeedee-F limit its effectiveness. Dragonite also struggles against Pokémon with high physical bulk that can take an Extreme Speed and threaten it in return such as Great Tusk, Iron Hands, Amoonguss, and Garganacl. Additionally, Dragonite is greatly hindered by Stealth Rock, which nullifies Multiscale and limits its longevity.</p>",

While Heatran boasts an innately good defensive typing, Tera Grass allows it to turn its common weaknesses to Ground and Water into resistances, letting it match up better against the likes of Landorus-T and Palafin-H. Heat Wave is a spread STAB attack that chips away at foes, notably 2HKOing Amoonguss. Flash Cannon is Heatran's best way of hitting Fairy-types, as it OHKOes Diancie and 2HKOes Flutter Mane. Heavy Slam OHKOes Flutter Mane but is generally less reliable because it can be weakened by Intimidate and does less damage to Diancie and opposing Tera Grass Heatran mirror. Tera Blast hits Water- and Ground-types super effectively once Heatran has Terastallized, notably OHKOing Great Tusk and 2HKOing Bulk Up Palafin-H. Earth Power hits the Fire-types such as Volcanion, Chi-Yu, and opposing Heatran that otherwise resists all of Heatran's attacks. Heatran's base resistances let it take common Fairy-, Ice-, and Steel-type attacks such as Flutter Mane's Moonblast, Chien-Pao's Ice Spinner, and Gholdengo's Make It Rain much better. After Terastallization, Heatran matches up better against Palafin-H, Volcanion, and Iron Hands at the cost of receiving more damage from the aforementioned attacks. Heatran has a lot of defensive responsibilities on most teams, so Terastallization should not be used too frivolously. Heatran commonly finds itself in Fire / Water / Grass cores with Rillaboom and Palafin, as they complement each other offensively and defensively, with Rillaboom eradicating Water-types and Palafin punching through Fire-types. Iron Hands is a common Heatran partner that can pressure Palafin and Volcanion with Wild Charge and Chi-Yu and Tera Dark Kingambit with Drain Punch. Heatran has no form of recovery, so it appreciates teammates that can extend its longevity, such as Cresselia with Lunar Blessing and Amoonguss with Pollen Puff.</p>"

Its biggest selling points are its unique move and ability: Salt Cure offers valuable passive damage, synergizing well with its natural bulk, while Purifying Salt provides a useful immunity to status moves such as Spore and Toxic. Garganacl is difficult to break for many Pokemon, but it matches up notably well into Fire-types such as Chi-Yu and Arcanine, Flying-types like Dragonite and Iron Jugulis, and Amoonguss due to Purifying Salt. As one of the best Wide Guard users, Garganacl can block the format's many powerful spread attacks such as Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Chi-Yu's Heat Wave, and Armarouge's Expanding Force. Iron Defense lets Garganacl play as a potent wincon instead, increasing its Defense whilst simultaneously strengthening its offensive presence through Body Press. These sets can be very difficult to take down, though they often rely on using up Terastallization to be most effective. Garganacl's abysmal Speed means it will usually be relegated to moving last. Rock typing also leaves Garganacl with countless weaknesses, including to Water-, Steel-, and Fighting-type moves, meaning common Pokemon such as Palafin, Gholdengo, Iron Bundle, Iron Hands, and Great Tusk all significantly threaten it. Amoonguss is one of the best partners for Garganacl, being helpful against several of the aforementioned threats, while Garganacl checks Fire-types like Chi-Yu in return, with redirection support and healing being especially critical for Iron Defense sets. Garganacl also appreciates teammates that can check Gholdengo, especially if not using Wide Guard, so Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Arcanine, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit are other desirable additions.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Bulk Up Palafin builds upon its natural bulk and Attack, letting it function as a strong priority attacker who uses its Defense to brazenly set up and become a threatening sweeper that is difficult to KO for common physical attackers like Chien-Pao, Landorus-T, and Kingambit. Jet Punch circumvents common speed control and is threatening against the frailer metagame, notably OHKOing Chi-Yu and Landorus at +1. Drain Punch is a reliable means of recovery in addition to Leftovers while also hitting popular Dark-types like Kingambit and Chien-Pao, as well as common Water-resistant or immune foes such as Rillaboom and Volcanion harder. Tera Grass provides an immunity to Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, as well as resistances to Grass- and Electric-type attacks such as Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Iron Hands's Wild Charge, which would otherwise OHKO Palafin. Palafin's base forme has poor damage output and bulk, so it is often ideal for it to lead and pivot out immediately to activate Zero to Hero. This is so crucial to Palafin's functioning that it is very telegraphed and easily exploitable with powerful attacks directed at it. To cover for this, Palafin may lead together with a Fake Out user or a redirector to reduce incoming damage. Bulk Up Palafin pairs well with partners that can remove Psychic Terrain, use Fake Out to generate free turns for Palafin to set up, and extend Palafin's longevity. Rillaboom fulfills all of these roles, with Grassy Terrain granting additional passive recovery. Cresselia is another good partner, as its Lunar Blessing heals Palafin and cures burn and poison, which would otherwise severely limit Palafin's offensive output or the turns it can stay on field. Amoonguss's Rage Powder redirects threatening attacks such as Iron Hands's Wild Charge, removes Toxic Spikes that reduce Palafin's longevity, and provides a major source of recovery for Palafin with Pollen Puff. Iron Hands is a Fake Out user whose Electric-type attacks eliminate opposing Water-types that resist Jet Punch. Grimmsnarl can also increase Palafin's bulk and create setup opportunities with its dual screens. As Amoonguss effortlessly walls Palafin and undoes its progress with Clear Smog, Palafin requires partners that deal with it effectively, like Heatran, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Flutter Mane is one the strongest Pokemon in DOU thanks to its fantastic Speed and Special Attack, as well its Fairy / Ghost typing that offers practically unresisted STAB coverage on the metagame. Moonblast and Shadow Ball are Flutter Mane's strongest attacks, threatening substantial damage into nearly every Pokemon in the tier. Dazzling Gleam is a source of reliable spread damage that Flutter Mane can use late-game to clean up heavily weakened foes or to provide the chip damage its teammates need to secure KOs.</p> </li> <li> <p>The HP and Defense EVs allow Flutter Mane to survive a Tera Dark Black Glasses Kingambit's Sucker Punch. The Speed EVs with the Timid nature provide enough Speed to outrun Tornadus, as well as making Protosynthesis boost Speed. When Booster Energy activates Protosynthesis, Flutter Mane will outspeed all unboosted Pokemon with the exception of the uncommon Regieleki.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Fairy can be used to amplify the wallbreaking power of Flutter Mane's Fairy STAB attacks. It can also be used to gain a resistance to Dark-type attacks, most notably Sucker Punch from the Dark-type powerhouses Kingambit and Chien-Pao. Tera Ghost allows Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball to get the OHKO on Basculegion-F and opposing bulky Flutter Mane. Defensively, it allows Flutter Mane to lose its commonly targeted weakness to Steel-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flutter Mane's Ghost typing can often be very valuable for its immunity to Normal-type attacks, particularly against Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite that are looking to lock into Extreme Speed, so it's sometimes valuable to preserve this and avoid Terastallizing Flutter Mane into a pure Fairy-type.</p> </li> <li> <p>As Booster Energy is a consumable held item, it's important to be careful about when Flutter Mane is brought in for the first time, to take advantage of the Speed boost. This means leading with Booster Energy Flutter Mane is often ill advised against teams with fast Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and common Choice Scarf users like Basculegion-F, as it may need to preserve the Speed boost until the right moment to pressure these fast Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Against bulky teams with slower Pokemon, Flutter Mane can usually afford to be less cautious with the timing of its Booster Energy use, as it will outspeed many Pokemon without its Protosynthesis active. However, it is very notable that with the Speed boost Flutter Mane is capable of outspeeding many of these slower Pokemon even when they are supported by Tailwind, which can be key tool in these matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p>With the damage output of this set being lower compared to the common Choice Specs, Booster Energy Flutter Mane isn't often getting OHKOs. This means it trades poorly with some of the tier's bulkier Pokemon such as common Assault Vest users like Rillaboom and Iron Hands, if they're still healthy. Because of this, Flutter Mane often wants to come in on weakened foes to pick them off safely using its Speed advantage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mane can find a spot on practically any style of team. Common checks to Flutter Mane include bulky Fairy-resisting Pokemon such as Volcanion, Heatran, and Amoonguss, which can comfortably take Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball. The former two often aim to respond with their Steel-type attacks, while the latter can shut down Flutter Mane with Spore. One option to handle these is Landorus-T, which threatens the Fire-types with a super effective Stomping Tantrum and shuts down Amoonguss with Taunt. With Stealth Rock, Landorus-T can also significantly weaken Volcanion each time it switches in and chip other foes to put them in Flutter Mane's KO range. Landorus-T's Intimidate also helps Flutter Mane take physical attacks better, as it has very low Defense.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chi-Yu is another strong partner for Flutter Mane. Chi-Yu's Beads Of Ruin boosts Flutter Mane's damage output, as well as Chi-Yu threatening Rillaboom and Amoonguss with powerful Fire-type attacks. In addition, Chi-Yu can use Snarl to make Flutter Mane extremely difficult to take down with special attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Two other attack options are Hex and Icy Wind. Hex, as an alternative to Shadow Ball, can be used on teams with abundant status options, such as Glimmora's Toxic Debris, Amoonguss's Spore, and Thundurus's Thunder Wave. Icy Wind on the other hand is a dynamic speed control option with which the high Speed Flutter Mane supports its slower teammates.</p> </li> </ul>"

Iron Bundle has excellent speed control with Icy Wind, which, when combined with its high Speed, can easily ensure that it and its allies outspeed the enemy team.

Snow also boosts Iron Bundle's Defense, making it particularly more effective against priority spam teams with Dragonite and Palafin. 252 HP and 64 Special Defense EVs can be used with Assault Vest to survive an Overheat from Choice Scarf Chi-Yu, and Iron Bundle still has above 152 Speed EVs left for outspeeding Meowscarada. 40 HP EVs allow Iron Bundle to avoid a potential OHKO from Chien-Pao's Sacred Sword if Chien-Pao lacks a damage-boosting item, so an EV spread of 40 HP / 216 SpA / 252 Spe on less bulky sets could be used instead.</p>",

  "Iron Hands": {

    "overview": "<p>Iron Hands is a slow but exceptionally bulky and strong physical attacker, as well as one of the best Fake Out users in the tier. It fits best on Trick Room teams that benefit from its low Speed but also has enough bulk to compensate for its slowness and perform adequately on any team that appreciates the safe turns that Fake Out can provide. Iron Hands most commonly holds an Assault Vest to patch up its lower Special Defense stat and comfortably endure and trade attacks with its enemies. Another popular set foregoes Assault Vest to enable the use of Swords Dance, turning Iron Hands into a fearsome setup sweeper. With either set, Iron Hands is a reliable and well-rounded Pokemon that matches up decently into much of the metagame, although it does need to be wary of a few commonly encountered threats. Amoonguss, the tier's most common and bulkiest redirector, walls both of Iron Hands's STAB attacks and can survive two of its Ice Punches. Despite Iron Hands's massive bulk, a few especially hard-hitting Pokemon like Great Tusk and Armarouge have the offensive capability to break through it with ease. Finally, Iron Hands needs to be wary of priority blockers like Farigiraf, Indeedee-F, and Tsareena when using Fake Out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Iron Hands can be made even bulkier by shifting some or all of its Attack EVs into HP and Defense. Moving 64 EVs into HP allows the Assault Vest Iron Hands set to survive two boosted Shadow Balls from Modest Nasty Plot Gholdengo, as well as one Overheat from a Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu. In addition to the 64 HP EVs, an additional 48 EVs can be moved into Defense to allow Iron Hands to survive two Extreme Speeds or Dragon Claws from Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite, as well as one Headlong Rush from Adamant Great Tusk. Iron Hands can also invest 124 EVs in Speed to outspeed Garchomp under Tailwind but should retain at least 100 Attack EVs and an Adamant Nature when doing so to ensure Ice Punch OHKOes Garchomp. Tera Fire can be used to prevent burns from Will-O-Wisp users like Arcanine while also providing a STAB boost to Fire Punch. Heavy Slam can be run as a coverage move if Fairy-types such as Sylveon are a concern. Finally, Belly Drum can be used in place of Swords Dance as a higher-risk, higher-reward Attack-boosting move, but losing 50% HP in the process is a high price to pay for a Pokemon that prides itself on its bulk and longevity. When using Belly Drum in combination with a Sitrus Berry, ensure that Iron Hands's HP stat is an even number so that Sitrus Berry activates after the 50% HP drop.</p>",

        "description": "<ul> <li>Roaring Moon has grown into the role of DOU's premier offensive Tailwind setter, using its blazing Speed to provide both damage and team support.</li> <li>Booster Energy lets Roaring Moon outspeed every other Pokemon in the format besides Booster Energy Iron Bundle. This ensures Roaring Moon is able to set Tailwind before being KOed and may even allow its partner to KO opposing threats instead.</li> <li>Breaking Swipe offers survivability for Roaring Moon and its partner as well as chip damage that can break the Focus Sash of Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle.</li> <li>Acrobatics is immediately activated when Booster Energy is consumed and offers strong damage, nearly matching Roaring Moon's best STAB options, Throat Chop and Dragon Claw. With Tera Flying, it becomes Roaring Moon's best damage-dealing option, threatening massive damage on Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Great Tusk.</li> <li>Throat Chop can be used over either Breaking Swipe or Acrobatics as a consistent STAB option that hits Indeedee-F and Armarouge for super effective damage.</li> <li>Roaring Moon's defenses are decent, but both Dragon / Dark and Flying have notable weaknesses, especially to opposing Ice-types like Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao; Protect gives Roaring Moon the opportunity to avoid these attacks while its partner removes such threats. Protect can also be used to stall out field effects like weather, Trick Room, and an opponent's Tailwind.</li> <li>The listed EVs will boost Roaring Moon's Speed with Booster Energy. If an Attack boost is desired instead, 32 HP EVs can be moved into Attack.</li> <li>If being used on sun teams, Life Orb is preferred as the item. Sun will activate Protosynthesis without consuming Booster Energy, keeping Acrobatics at a measly 55 Base Power. Keep this in mind while facing sun teams as well.</li> <li>Taunt is an option to prevent opposing forms of speed control such as Tailwind and Trick Room.</li> </ul>"

While it's simply good outside sun, there are very few things that can switch in on it in sun.</li> <li>Draco Meteor is Walking Wake's strongest move and can slam common Water-resistant Pokemon such as opposing Walking Wake and Palafin.</li> <li>Flamethrower is a strong sun-boosted coverage move that deals super effective damage to Pokemon like Amoonguss and Kingambit, which otherwise resist Walking Wake's STAB moves.</li> <li>Protect keeps Walking Wake safe against faster threats and through field effects and should always be used with Life Orb. Choice Specs Walking Wake should run Dragon Pulse as a consistent Dragon-type STAB option to lock into.</li> <li>Tera Fairy is chosen to remove Walking Wake's weaknesses to Dragon and Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry. Tera Dragon can also be run to increase Draco Meteor's damage and grant Walking Wake an important Electric resistance against Iron Hands. Tera Water greatly increases Hydro Steam's damage while removing Walking Wake's weaknesses to Dragon- and Fairy-type moves.</li> <li>The EVs listed boost Walking Wake's Speed in sun. If a Special Attack boost is desired, move 8 EVs from Special Defense into Special Attack.</li> </ul>"
